I ,, I \ I CXVI, No. 1 :J College Plans ,For Februa:ry Gym Opening Contractors To Finish Four Months Early BY CHRISTINE HONG Plans for the opening of the Alwnni Gym have undergone the initial stages as the college awaits to take occupancy of the renovated building this month. The Alunmi Gym contractors, Sweet Associates, will complete the year and a half project towards the end of January, four months earlier than the proposed contract completion date, according to Vice- President for Finance and Administration John Hauser. Ha11ser added that once the college regains occupancy of the building, the committee planning the Gym's opening will set a date for the event sometime in February. The committee, headed by Vice- President D'Andrea, intends to plan an opening that is aimed to the campus community. Said Hauser, \Our first priority is to the students, one hundred percent. Its (the opening's) purpose is to introduce the new building for college use. What we expect is that the opening will be a campus affair.\ Rumors on the delay of the opening of the Gym have ~en circulating the campus smce the return of the student body from winter break. However, state Hauser and president of Sweet Associates, Robert Fortune, these are unfounded. Said Mr. Fortune on behalf of Sweet Associates, \While there were a few break-ins and stolen tools, they did not set back the project. We are pleased to be scheduled for completion four months before the contract date as well as to be able to present the college with a building of high class.'' When asked if there were any reasons why these rumors were formed, Fortune answered that he had \no idea where they came from.\ Once the contractors of- ficially 'hand' the Gym back over to Union, it will first need to gain approval from the New York State Health Department on the quality of the s~g po()l's water, which according to the Sweet Associates' president, is a formality. And while the Alumni Gym is now expected to be c~mplett:d ahead of time, Carnegie Hall JS still under major construction under the supervision of B11nkoff Contractors. Hauser commented that it is not possible to pinpoint a date for the completion of the college's only student center; however, he noted that its completion is guaranteed for the 1917-1988 academic year.

Approves General Education Plan 40% of Faculty Opposed Gado Initiates Petition BY DEBRA B. HONIG A faculty vote indicating 00 percent in favor of the proposed curricular reform influenced the Academic Affairs Cotmcil to approve the General Education Plan late November. This vote, however, has not hindered fervent opponents in an effort to form a committee that would investigate alternative plans. The plan, which goes into effect for the class of 1991, in- volves the requirement of two \Applied Science and Technology\ courses, a literature course, and a more structured set up between the Humanities and Social Science courses. For example, if a student were to choose Major American Authors as his literature class, then he would have to take American History for the coinciding time frame. According to Professor of Modern Literary and Historical Studies Manfred Jonas, \ ... It at least makes a stab at coherence and n1oves somewhat away from the grabbag aspect of what we now have.\ After a great deal of con- troversy among both faculty and students, the AAC had altered the composition of the original proposal. According t() Chairman of the Faculty Theodore Bick, \The vote was an indication of the faculty's wishes, though the Academic Affairs Council could go along with what it wants. In this case, they just incorporated the changes brought up by the faculty.\ But in fact, it is this mere \in of the already existing general education requirements tbat a number of faculty members object to. According to Professor of English Frank Gado, it is this \patchwork\ of ideas that will cripple any ef- forts for a solid education. He says, \What we have now is a smorgasbord, instead of a variety of well-planned meals. \ Effected by fall term Con· cordtensis investigation, new fire safety alarms were in· stalled in each West College dormitory bedr()om during winter break. These sensors are a combination of centrally connected heat detectors and locally active smoke alarms. The College has aded quickly in order to fulfill requirements of both New York State and Schenectady County law. While West 1s the only dorm to have this new system, Director of Campus Operations Jack Hill says the College will \continue making the installation as we can and we are now making plans for Fox and Davidson.\ lran-Contras Scandal Casts Shadow On Presidency Professor Gado is now in the process of rounding up 30 faculty member signatures, which would allow the matter to be brought to a general meeting for a thorough airing. Presently, 29 faculty membErs have signed this petition. In agreement with the Faculty Constitution, the vote is not valid until 30 days have passed without the presentation of 30 signatures. A discrepancy, however, lies in the wording c, f this Constitution. because Gado and Secretary Byron Nichols are uncertain if the \dead time\ over winter break should count in the 30 day limit An informal meeting was held Thursday, January 8 by Fire Marshal Barry Watkins to educate West residents of the operation of the addition to their rooms. However, only seven people attended, and Cliff Wood, head of Safety and Security would like to see more interest on the part of the students. Such lack is \what bothered (him) the most.\ Following the September 29 Davidson Dorm fire in which major damage was prevented by Safety and Security officers and the Schenectady County fire department, it was discovered that Union was not complying directly with the written law of the state and county. The New York State 1985 session laws (Chapter 683 • Multiple Dwellings and Residences - Requirement of smoke detectors) contains an amendment passed in August 1985 that reads \In ... sorority and fraternity houses, college and school donnitories . . . at least one smoke detecting device shall be located within each room used for sleeping purposes.\ As local ls.w remains consistent with state law,.Schenectady County's City Council Ordinance 81-37, Sec- tion 11-46 states HOne smoke detector a1ann device shall be BY KRISTINE BURNHAM Editor's note: This article is an summary and analysis of important events that CJccurred during winter break with the purpose of clarifying the rapid and often confusing sequence of developments in the story~ Looking back over the events of November and December 1986, one must note the speed with which the ''teflon presidency\ has been deeply scratched. The so-caUed Iran- contras arms scandal has brought forth many factual questions-what was s~ld, when was it sold, who was mvolved, what did they know, and when did they know it. In turn, those questions call into question the Reagan Administration's policies in the Middle East and Central America. The scandal has also prompted the inevitable comparisons with Watergate and raised allegations of wrongdoing on the Administration's part. Current investigations and inquiries reach into the highest echelons of government. The history of the situation is, briefly, as follows: Marine Colonel Oliver North was in 1986 working for the National Security Council under former National Security Advisor Robert McFarlane. At this time, Col. North seemingly arranged a transfer of anns to Iranian \moderates.\ These transactions were made in order to better relations with these persons in the hope that they would be able to help free hostages being held in Lebanon. The income from these arms sales (it is believed that these events were munerous) was then transferred to a numbered Swiss bank account. This money, according to Attorney General Edward Meese III, was transferred to the contra rebels fighting in Nicaragua. The real questions about these events begin with two Reagan policy cormnitments, firstly the Administrations negative position on dealings with countries that openly promote terriorism. Iran is one such a coWltry. In fact at the time the story broke, Secretary of State George Shultz was in the midst of a campaign trying to convince allies of the US not to sell arms to Iran. It has also been noted that because of recent history Iran would be tlle last coWltry the US would be expected to deal with. The second policy question is that of the Reagan Administration's policy in Nicaragua. Reagan's support ()f the contras is well documented. Continued on page~ Prof. of Modern Languages, William Thomas of the AAC says that if the petition g<les through, there are three possible outcomes. The faculty could either reject the AAC's decision, send it back to the AA.c for further alterations, or reaffirm its vote. In a notice to the faculty, Jonas wrote, \I believe, however, that there is over- whelming evidence to suggest that nothing better-indeed, nothing at all-would emerge from further consideration of the issue.\ Gado insists that Jonas has been too political, in an effort to ''maximize the number of brownie points he can get.'' Gado also believes that a combined effort between William Zwicker and Christie Sorwn has prevented him from offering his ideas to the sub- council, because they feel that his ide.Js are too radical.

The question tba.t must be raised is what, in fC!ct, did high- level aides know a!ld what did the President kno-w?

On one lu\od, if t.hese events were the reslllt of upper level knowledge llllc:l approval, the duplications beh.avior of the administration is blatant. On the other hand, if Col. North acted on his own accord with only the knowledge of a few others, one must then wonder what other Congre:ssional ad- ministrative bure;iucrat could be .doing without approval. The investigations as o:f yet have revealed little or 110 insights, primarily because key wit· nesses such as C()l. North and former National Stecurity ad· visor Admiral Jdl.ll Poindexter have asserted their fifth amendment right 0of not giving testimony that !Day later be self-incriminating. The question has been raised as to whether or not to grant~tll men 4runWlity from prosecution. It is believed that such a decisi()n would not be reached for at l.east a month or two. This illliDrmity would include all tllo~e things discussed. Howevex, if other things were brot~gllt out later, even if North discllSsed them following their disc()very, the new evidence W()uld be ad- missible evidence. At this time roth houses in Congress have crEated Special Select Committees t() look into this unfolding stor-y. These two conunittees Will ·~ building on investigations tllat began in the last session b:v various in· vestigating committees. Because nf the r~H~a.t number of committees that Vlouid have jurisdiction over t.his case, it is widely believed that such a system of two select com- mittees will be efficient and lllnre centralized In: addition to the Committee Investigations, the- President himself responded to the growing outcry and appointed a special independent legal counsel to investigate any wrongdoings. This would in· elude trying to determine when · the . transactions took place because recently a law was enacted restricting arms sales to \terrorist\ countries: The law, although believed to- be a long time Reagan ad- ministration policy, was -only made illegal relatively recently. As tar as the funds them- selves, the contras have denied receiving them. H not for Attorney General Meese's admission to such a transfer, there would be little evidence of such a maneuver-as the funds have not yet been traced. There is speculation that the money ~was sent to Honduras where us- supported contras are based, but again the actual funds have not been found. . And finally as far as the Lebanon hostages, during the time frame of the story two hostages have been released, three new ones have been killed whether Iranian pressures aided in the releases or not, the US bargaining position has been considerably weakened by the selling of arms to a country that is involved in terrorism. Domestically, the teflon facade of the Reagan Administration finally had something stick. It stuck in fact so well that there was a significant drop in Reagan's previously .overwhelming popularity. However, \the popularity percenta-ge now,· although low for Reagan, is fairly good for a president in his sixth of seventh year in office\ says Political Science professor Clyde Wilcox. Undoubtedly the Reagan Administration has been hurt by this scandal. It remains to be seen what the continuing in- vestigations show-yet cer- tainly some answers will reveal the path to set more questions. Because of the overwhelming popularity of President Reagan, the institution of the presidency has maintained much of its strength throughout this crisis. Since both Houses in Congress are now controlled by Democrats, a significant power shift may occur in Congress' favor because of the weakening of the executive branch. However, the Democrats must realize the importance and strength of the instit!ltion of the presidency and will therefore GERMAN LANGUAGE TABLE Every FRIDAY 12:30 · 1 :30 p.m. HALE NOUSE probably hesitate before seriously damaging the presidency. Such damage wollld weaken the US for years to come. Mr. Reagan has two years left in his term and although this crisis has :been quite a blow, it remains tiJ be seen if history's opinion of tile administration will be lowered. According to Deall Massa they left the house with ''.significant damage.'' This was .

The smoke sensor, as demonstrated by Mr. Watkins, produced a continuous shrill beep wh~n inhaled upon with two lungfuls of cigarette smoke. This soWld ceased v.rben clean air was manually waved through the agent. This alai'!Il is only produced locally. However, if a fire were to o«:cut, both parts of the system would: ideally respond within dose range of each other. Nt\Jver- theless, students are instructed to inform Security of any· emergency. These photCJCell detectors utilize a light so11rce with a mirror that is elec- tronically monitored and reads the intensity of the light present. When either smoke or dust in the smoke detecting chamber reduce that light, .. an alarm sounds. The heat p()ltion of the detector has a .pie<:e of soldered metal that, wben melted, is disconnected from the instrument and an alarm is then centrally sounded. · / Watkins pointed out that if the smoke detectors were tiecl into the general system, there W()uld be six to eight fire drills per night, which would desensitize students from .respo11ding quickly to the alarms. He feels that this detector is the \most compatible and cooperative means of complying with state law and comfortable living in the dorms.\ Security resear- . ched their choice well.

On one hand, if these events were the result of upper level knowledge and approval, the duplications behavior of the administration is blatant. On the other hand, if Col. North acted on his own accord with ()nly the knowledge of a few ()thers, one must then wonder what other Congressional ad- ministrative bureaucrat could l>e doing without approval. The investigations as of yet have revealed little or no insights, primarily because key wit- llesses such as Col. North and former National Security ad- visor Admiral John Poindexter have asserted their fifth amendment right of not giving testimony that may later be self-incriminating. The question has been raised as to whether or not to grant lsoth men immunity from prosecution. It is believed that such a decision would not be reached for at least a month ()r two. This immunity would include all those things discussed. However, if other things were brought out later, even if North discussed them following their discovery, the new evidence would be ad- missible evidence. At this time both houses in Congress have created Special Select Committees to look into this unfolding story. These two committees will be building on investigations that began in the last session by various in- vestigating committees. Because of the great number of committees that would have jurisdiction over this case, it is v>idely believed that such a system of two select com- mittees will be efficient and more centralized. In addition to the Corrunittee Investigations, the President himself responded to the growing outcry and appointed a special independent legal counsel to investigate any wrongdoings. This would in- clude trying to determine when · the transactions teok place because recently a law was enacted restricting arms sales to \terrorist\ countries. The law, although believed to be a long time Reagan ad- ministration policy, was only made illegal relatively recently. As tar as the funds them- selves, the contras have denied receiving them. If not for Attorney General Meese's admission to such a transfer, there would be little evideace of such a maneuver-as the funds have not yet been traced. There is speculation that the money was sent to Honduras where US- Sllpported contras are based, but again the actual funds have not been found. And finally as far as the Lebanon hostages, during the time frame of the story two hostages have been released, three new ones have been killed whether Iranian pressures aided in the releases or not, the US bargaining position has been considerably weakened by the selling of arms to a country that is involved in terrorism. Domestically, the teflon facade of the Reagan Administration finally had something stick. It stuck in fact so well that there was a significant drop in Reagan's previously overwhelming popularity. However, \the popularity percentage now, although low for Reagan, is fairly good for a president in his sixth of seventh year in office\ says Political Science professor Clyde Wilcox. Undoubtedly the Reagan Administration has been hurt by this scandal. It remains to be seen what the continuing in- vestigations show-yet cer- tainly some answers will reveal the path to set more questions. Because of the overwhelming popularity of President Reagan, the institution of the presidency has maintained much of its strength throughout this crisis. Since both Heuses in Congress are now controlled by Democrats, a significant power shift may occur in Congress' favor because of the weakening of the executive branch. However, the Democrats must realize the importance and strength of the institution of the presidency and will therefore GERMAN LANGUAGE TABLE Every FRIDAY 12:30 • 1:30 p.m. HALE HOUSE probably hesitate before seriously damaging the presidency. Such damage would weaken the US for years to come. Mr. Reagan has two years left in his term and although this crisis has been quite a blow, it remains to be seen if hlstory's opinion of the administ1·ation will be lowered. According to Dean Massa they left Ute house with ''significant damage.\ This was Photocell Smoke Detectors Made \Tamper-Proof\; Wiring System To Prevent False Alarms Continued from page 1 and alerts Security's central alarm system. The smoke sensor. as demonstrated by Mr. Watkins, produced a continuous shrill beep when inhaled upon with two lungfuls of cigarette smoke. This sound ceased when clean air was manually waved through the agent. This alarm is only produced locally. However, if a fire were to occur, both paris of the system would ideally respond within close range of each other. Never- theless, students are instructed to inform Security of any· emergency. These photocell detector:; utilize a light source with a mirror that is elec- tronically monitored and reads the intensity of the light present. When either smoke or dust in the smoke detecting chamber reduce that light, an alarm sounds. The heat portion of the detector has a piece of soldel\ed metal that, when melted, is disconnected from the instrument and an alarm is then ce11trally sounded. Watk:ins pointed out that if the smoke detectors were tied into the general system, there would be six to eight fire drills per night, which would desensitize students from responding quickly to the alarms. He feels that tllis detector is the \most compatible and cooperative means of complying with state law and comfortable living in the dorms.\ Security resear· ched their choice well. This system is both safe and durable, with a life expectancy of mere than 15 years. The approximate cost of boths the actual device and labor is $75 according to Hill. vantages to this type of detecting device. It is run by 110 volts of electricity and prevents the possibility of removal of batteries, thus having a clor- mant system. Tampering tabs are located on the instrument so that any vandalism results in direct notification of the Security department. The College continues to make the installation of the new alarm system to be a priority: each bedroom in both Fox and Davidson should be equipped by fall term. Other dorms and fraternity and sorority houses will follow. Plans are made for the system in West to be disabled and cleaned over the summer. Hill stressed that an addition to the fire safety system has been made, not a renovation. When asked about the response of the students, he stated \I would think they'd be happy with it, because it's an . . . irn- nrovement on the buildings and (ho_peful!Y) 90-95 percent will never be affected by it.\ Two students will be selected to spend the 1987- 88 academic year sttldying at a German University with a scholarship provided by the Federation ~f German-American Clubs in the Federal Republic of Germany. Normally, only students who will be juniors next year are eligible. Other basic requirements include a strong academic record and a good working language of the Gennan language.

Derek Sanderson's story is not much different from some of the other people in the public eye whose lives have been rUined by drugs and alcohol. Fortunately, he was able to survive his. bouts with addiction and is alive to tell us hiS story.

The next year San- derson joined the Boston Bruins and won the Rookie of the Year award in 1967. He was known as 1 a flashy, hard-checking player who had the ability to score · · goals as well. He was the . quintessential example of the · type of player that coined the phrase \the Big Bad Bruins\ as '· they were known in the early · 1970s. The team managed to capture · the Stanley Cup in 1970 and again in 1972. Sanderson was one of the most-often photographed players with his then fashionable mustache and long, flowing hair. At that time, the World Hockey Association was signing N.H.~., players to big contracts and Derek, along with other superstars including Bobby Hull and Wayne Gretzky, jumped into the new league. Sanderson was the world's highest paid athlete in 1973, but an injury cut his season short. The W.H.A. was a fledgling professional hockey organization at that time. Sanderson rejoined the Bruins and he was later traded to the arch-rival New York Rangers the following season. It was then that histroubles with drugs and alcohol began. As he was wining and dining w.omen in the New York limelight, he began drinking more heavily and would bt\eak · out a ¥z gram of cocaine or more. \It gives you a false state o1 mental security. You lie and con yourself,\ Sanderson said. \I thought I was better in bed and in the social scene.\ Sanderson's message now is simple: stay away from drugs.

It's just a fear of being unaccepted socially, sexually, etc.\ One day his former teammate and friend, Bobby Orr, an N.H.L. great, paid him a visit and checked him int() a hospital. It was there that Sanderson learned of his addiction to drugs and alcohol and attempted to overccme this· through rehabilitation. He made a comeback in 1978 with the Pittsburgh Penguins but didn't fully rid himself of llis ability to keep away from speed and cocaine. He returned to a drug rehabilitation center and was forced to retire from professional hockey. He was confined to a wheelchair and can only walk today with the aid of crutches and a cane. Because of his extensive use of steroids and ·other drugs he has faced five hip transplants and now has two artificial hips. Three years ago Sanderson returned to the city of Boston to assist Mayor Flynn in assessing drug problems in the schools. He is in the process of im- plementing a drug and alcohol education and awareness in the public schools and eventually wants to introduce his program to the college curriculum. Sanderson will be speaking on Monday at 7:30 p.m. in Memorial Chapel and his message is one worth listening to: \It is never possibte to be cured from alcoholism or drug addi<.tion, only arrested.

CONCORDIENSIS, fanuary 15,1987 PageS FEATURES M.I.T·. Pr·ofessor Offers Solution • By ALEX STEPHENS Does a solution for the· great debate among academicians -concerning the pertinence between science and the humanities exist? Or is it . another Ma1•xian connict that may only be tesolved by con~ frontation? Well, despite how facetious. this may sound there . is a strong underlying struggle that is even being ,perpetreted here at Union. One · pm;sible solution was presented on Monday by Mildred S. Dresselhaus, a · professor of 'Electrical Engineering and Physics at M.LT. as well as a member of the National Academy of Sciences andaformer president of · the American Physical Society. Her current research focuses on the electronic ·and structural ·modifications of graphite through intercalation, ion-implantation, and rapid laser irradiation. The hour long lecture took .place in the music room of the library, which was filled. with roughly 70. people mostly professors and faculty. 'J;he topic she discussed was of a program called \Interface which she and. twl) other M.I.T .. professors ereated as an ex\ perimental program for fresh- men in place of their required seminars. Her inspiration basica~ly stemmed from a profound sens~ of inadequacy she feels befalls students who only concentrate on one subject, i.e., a science major who receives little or no hmnanities and vice versa. The need she saw at M.I. T. was due to ,a strong lacking in humanities, since 90 percent of all students are involved in the sciences and because of the demand of these studies, humanities gets the . \last place on the agenda.\ The goals of the seminar were to \develop an appreciation between science and technology and society.\ In doing -so .~he hoped to motivate students into a broader education with a lecture and make quality pr- sentations. Something, she said,. students have very little .ex- perience in and which becomes \the first thing you have to do\ when you get into the outside world. To make her progvarn more appealing she asked that studentsonlyvolu,nteer and that it should meet once a week following a group dinner in the dorm. This; casual environment, the lack of a grade; no doubt, added a relaxing ingredient for the students, allowed the students to meet informally with a .professor for the purpose of a class but also allowing them a chance to get to know a member c;if the .. faculty, A situation that is quite difficult at larger schools. The actual format was that of a congressional committee with .Professor Dresselhaus as the head. Two students each week were called · upon to make presentations to the committee and tben those topics would be discussed. An added touch of realism was provided from her own personal expeiences in Washington in front of -actual ·committees. The idea was enthusicasticaUy received ·by each student and a near perfect attend~ce resulted. The basic \guts\ of the course leaned 'Strongly on science and a technical backgroundrequiredfor M.I.T., but the pivotal' portion was a push to examine the societal aspects and .political impacts of certain scientific achievements 'and endeavors. Among the topographical items discussed were .. energy, the space ,rogram, defense and professional ethics. Because of her consulting position with a wau Street based C<!mpany she was able to give students actual government· documentation of these topics, sometimes prior to their official release. This ~appealed immensely to the students, she said. Time was also allocated to the discussion jj of the scientific ·and societal ~... advancements concerning ~ A.I.D;s, teenage pregnancy and :s drugs in our culture, She pushed ~ the students to not only examine ~ each subject scientifically, but a:. probe the problems through >- philosophical questioning. The ~ purpose, she said, was not to S develop solutions to these '§.. complex problems put to be made more aware of them. Students in Bath, England The one subject she feared would bethe least interesting to students was that of professional ethics. As it turned out, the students took an added interest in the subject, Following the lecture· there was a short question and anm swer period. that had potential to be anything but short. Professor Dresselhaus was well schooled in the prevention of pontificators, although she often lacked a degree of patience concerning legitimate questions. The idea of \lnter-- face,\ she said, could be offered anywhere and many of Union's faculty eagerly inquired about its feasibility and applicatiQn here. But there was an air of uncertainty on whether or not it could be done with the same success·: yet in Union's own environment such programs are inherent in certain academic areas. According to Professor Dresselhaus: \Everyone can do something · that you're interested in. With a little effort and imagination you can bridge the gap between the two types.'' Ba'thing By MARJORIE HOFFER Early in October the Union group met together for, the first time. We waited for our ''families\ to collect us:: Feeling like an orphan, I sat in ~he room anticipating the arrival ·Of my \mother\ Mrs. Woodgate who I pictured to be a widowed little old lady. Well, Dillys arrived along wlth one of her daughters to .fetch the three of us students who were living with her. That was the b~ginning of my dissolution of England. Hardly a little old lady, Dillys was a vigorous woman who ran a tight ship. She \hoovered\ like a mad woman and had a strong business sense. Unfortunately, she was not very nice (and at least I may add not typical of most of our host families). I expected too many similarities between England .in the United States. Just because we speak somewhat the same language means very little. The British and the Americans are very different people as I was soon to find out. Not surprisingly the Americans mostly clung together. Due to our clear complexions and wearing our unfashionable polo necks under our jumpers, we were easy to spot anyway. The Europeans - hate Reagan. That was another blow. I thought that as allies we all thought that Ron was sort of a dude. But not so. The British would be some mention of the Royal family. Prince William received as much publicity as Thatcher. Pages of the newspapers would be devoted to the description of Di's outfits on her Royal tour of Arabia. Fergie turned on the· Christmas lights on RegentsStreet(but did not get as large a crowd to observe her as Joan Collins did). . The British adore Dallas. Though I come from a family very similar to the Ewings, it was important to convince the English that most of the Americans live in more modest situations. One day at lunch, as I was digging into a jacket potato, the waitress upon hearing our Yankee accents announced to us that Patrick Duffy's parents were killed. I think she thought she had told us that the equivalent in- formation as if the the state of California had just sunk Wlder water. Sometimes we wondered how the British live past fifty. They drink beer like it's -soda, they smoke cartons of cigarettes, conswne infinite amounts of \sweets and butter every piece of bread regardless of the fact that it might be going on top of a roast beef sandwich. An enterprising orthodontist would make a fortune setting up practice in the UK, braces anyone? . knowledge and concern for both science and non-science majors. Also, due ·to the technical em- phasis of the school, she wanted the students to be aware of not just a one-study science program but of the importance of a broad scientific background and its applications. . \As .a scientist you need depth,\ said Professor Dresselhaus, but also · a fundamental knowledge of other basics that you may need in the future. Another goal, and one of the most noticeably - successful ones of the program, was toteach the students how to Professor Mildred S; Oresselhaus Of M.l. T. . are very politically aware, and Americans are comparatively unaware. When the few students who actually ap- proached us met one of the two Nancy's on the trip, they asked if one was named after \Nancy Reagan hahahah .... \ The joke around England was that Maggie and· Ronnie were having an affair. (But who is Maggie?). Every night on th~ news there We may not have been in Japan, but as Americans we were tourists. Sometimes this fact behooved us. For example, I felt less conscious about asking questions whether it be for directions or for the plat- form nwnber in the railway .station. It was easier to get theater tickets and I think I got treated better in shops. However, near the end of the tenn, I was sick of people staring at me talking to my friends and there were days when I wanted to fake an accent jqst so I would blend in. Getting used to the British way of liff. was difficult. The in· convienences ranged · fron freezing bedrooms to not bein! able to get diet coke at restaurant.

Page6 CONCORDIENSJS, January I 5, 1987. FEATURES:. A Look. at Japan ·First .Impressions By CATHY BEDNARIK Student participates in f.amily life. Perspectives on Asia it was 9:36 a.m. on August 22, 1986 and after 49 hours of traveling time my plane finally touched down in Japan. Myself and about 200 Asians were herded toward immigration. I breathed a sigh of relief to see that under the Japanese writing was English. There were very few other times when I ex· perienced that same joy. There were two sections at im- migi\ation \ALIENS'' and \DOMESTIC.\ So of course I waited in the \DOMESTIC\ line until someone pointed out that indeed I was an \AllEN.\ Whether I liked it or not, for the next four months I would have to see myself in a new light. On the other side of i.J:nmigration and customs, a representative from Kansai Gaidai University was waiting to meet me. He easily saw my blonde· head swimming in a sea of blackness and rescued me from drowning. Driving from. the airport to the University I felt like a child who was seeing Disneyland for the first time. Everything was different. By CATHY MARKES and SUE CHANG Leaving your land of citizenship call create all sorts of new feelings and ideas about what kind of place \America\ is perceived to be. Through faraway eyes, this is a country of wealth, individual freedom and opportllllity. With such different regional climates, a population of all races and nationalities and no traditions which are truly \American this nati()n is usually visualized to be an entit:y far different than what most of us know it to be from firsthand experience. Since \America\ is well known for leisure and vacation, it sometimes becomes a synonym for \Disneyland.\ As two students who recently · experienced the culture of East Asia-China and Japan-we feel that the attitudes of the Chinese and Japanese about America. were interesting to note. Not only do they give us a broader knowledge of foreign lands, but they also enable us to see ourselves in a new and different light. Both in China and Japan, we felt a certain. positive attitude toward the U.S. This did not always mean, however, that we were treated kindly as foreigners. It seems that the Chinese and the Japanese have a sort of infatuation with America. That is, they like the ideals this com1try represents and because most have no true idea of what America is really like, they think we live in a sort of Garden of Eden. The Chinese, especially, see the U.S. as a nation of great material wealth, so this also proves attractive to them. In Japan, the idea that we have space for all these rnaterial.possessions appears to be more unbelievable than the wealth itself, since Japan is also quite a prosperous nation. · The Japanese were also .:lnvious of the great amount of leisure time American have. Most Japanese have very little vacation time, since most company employees work about sixty hours in a six-day work week. It is uncommon to tak.e a day off for either vacation or sickness. In China, the availability of leisure time did not seem to be as desirable. Workers were not observed to be very hardworking, and leisure time was readily available. The Chinese felt no qualms about taking days off and did not seem to be par- ticularly__ satisfied with their jobs. This was perhaps a result of the assignment of all Chinese employees to their positions of ~ employment. c: their geography was not too . incredible when we first arrived. Of course, all participants 011 the tenus abroad to China and Japan had different encounters with the people, ideas and culture of these two nations. We do not pretend .to speak authoritatively on our ex- periences, but merely want to raise awareness of the nations in which we studied. East Asia seems to be a great mystery to most American, and we believe there is a need for WIG derstanding between the U $. and the Eastern Asian nations. To my surprise, I was to stay in · a dormitory for the first week. Conveniently, I brought none of the essentials·, i.e. bathrobe, washcloth, or towel. So off I headed to the store. The store was a fair distance so the One problem we discovered ~ about how the Chinese and o Japanese conceptualized the U.S. was their Lack of geographical knowledge with respect to the 50 states. We were lucky enough to say \We go to school in N.Y.\ because in general, New York, California, and .Hawaii were the only states the Chinese and Japanese had ever heard of. They also had problems realizing just how large a land mass we live on: Peace Park up close. \If we visit California for a week, can we drive to New York to see you?\ Of course, this is understandable, because maps tend to disguise large distances fairly well and our · of Hiroshima: A Place to Never Forget By JULIE LIEBMANN November 10, 1986 In coming to Japan I knew r would have many new ex- periences, each rewarding in.its ·own way, and even some which would provide obstacles for me to overcome.

I , began my ho.utney on the right hand side of the road and soon discovered that cars were constantly headed straight for .me. I decided then that if ever I was to die via a car, it would be in Japan. I switched sides ·and found biking a little easier but not much. The reason being that the roads are the width of a single lane American street but with one interesting catch, the traffic is two ways. Adding to this danger factor, the Japanese driver must be declared in· competent before he is issued a license. I made it to the .store physically unharmed .. and mentally distraught. Once inside the store, much to my surprise, no one (and I mean no one) spoke English. After about an hour of wandering I .finally found a towel and a washcloth. Like everytbing else in Japan, they were half the size and tWice the price of American goods. But I needed a shower so I had no choice. The ride back to the donn was a breeze and I felt a great sense ~of ac- complislunent. The shower wa~ the best thing that happened to .me in almost three days. Walking back to my r<~om I realized two things: 1.) It was so hot and humid in Japan that I was al-ready sweating and needed another shower, 2.) I was all alone in a dormitory with a Japanese · couple Who spoke no English.

Though two of the students from Union developed close relationships with the British, I regret to say most of us did not have many British buddies. I wish that I could idealize and say that we are all the same people. But we don't even share the same sense of humor. Perhaps the most important fact I learned by being away is hat we are very different. I felt American for the first time in my life. But that is one of the best parts. I found out more about this country by seeing it in perspective. The British live in a very small world in every sense. '!bey· }lave little pints of milk,. they drive little cars, and live in little houses. The social structure is unbelievably strict and seems terribly archaic. However, life in England places a lot less demands on people. They don't have the same .pressuure to always be working ahead; to keep making more money and improving their statusquo. The U.K. is a much more united country than we are. It is also a much · more civilized environment and people have a much greater respect for authority. Imagine a country where· the policemen do not even carry guns. The subways are as safe as the train stations. It was amazing that I once spent two hours in Pad- dington station without once being approached by a disgusting character. I can't say that I miss my British family. I do miss some of the characters of Bath such as the lady· at the laundrette, whose establishment I frequented as I ~:hauled my laundry up and down the hill. And the man who ran the newsstand where I bought numerous packs of chewing gum at 11 pence a pack. It took me about five weeks to really \I agree with Prof. Gado on the problems of .a big budget surplus per year. Why don't they cut down our tuition! Seth Katz, '90. appreciate the British. I was very -l'ethnocentric\ when I arrived in England and I did not even realize it. Pretty soon . l found myself queing for the loos that were engaged, I was minding the steps and the gaps and eating too many sweets. Ten weeks might have been too short a time for some people to be on a term abroad, but I was quite happy when my plane landed in Newark. Of course, I have not yet received my grades. Nonetheless, a term abroad is honestly the exa perience of a lifetime. Every day I leame<J something new. The education in the classroom was infinitismal to the in- formation outside. I learned to appreciate other people's worlds, . and savour mY own. One of the greatest aspects of our education system is the ability to study abroad. For those who can, the learning is unique and incomparable to any course offered in the catalog. A .~ong.

Full schedule to be printed next issue. By ADAM EMERSON and ROB BLEIFER Hello, welcome back, Happy New Year. Okay enough with the formalities. Did you miss us'? Well, we didn't miss you but we get our GPA's boosted for writing these stupid articles. You all probably felt a certain void in your life during the winter break. That should gradually disappear as you begin reading our column again (or maybe it was our articles that gave you the void in the first place). Anyway, our break was very peaceful and en- joyable. We returned to our respective asylums. It was extremely relaxing (that's what heavy sedation does to you). But don'tfeel bad. The food was great and ·our parents had weekly visiting rights. Seriously though, it's school once again, time to hit those slopes ( uh books, yeah that's it).. Don't get us wrong. We don't enjoy skiing. We have to, it's our thesis topic. In any case, on the first Friday back we found ourselves doing some in- vestigative research at Jirniney Peak. Along with our advisor and assistant, Courageous Kat, we boarded a nearby ski lift to experience the day's first ascent. Rob became very distraught, when his ski boot slipped off halfw~y up the mountain. Fortunately, a ski 'patrol's head broke the fall of the ski and Rob was spared rental costs for the day. The first run was a bit rusty. But you never forget. It's a little like riding a bike, having sex, or falling off a horse. Needless to say, three \challenging runs on the bunny hill gave us quite an appetite. Courageous Kat suggested a small snack of nachos with cheese, potato skins, pizza, burgers, fries, QWTitos, chili, cookies, and some chicken noodle soup. Rob, however; didn't think the noodles would sit well. But the rest stood. What was missing? Of course, a few pitchers of courage on tap. \Lite Adam said. \We dan't want to get filled up.\ Meanwhile, back at the ranch, after having blown up the house, Aunt Martha was Buckle Up toasting marshmallows over the smouldering remains of herliving room. After a quick warmup run foUo~ing lunch, it was time for Lu«:ifer's Leap. We approached it hEsitantly. The sign read, \Danger: COURAGEOUS skiiers only.\ \What luck!\ •. Ro.b bellowed. \I had two pit· cher;s of it myself.\ iliurageous Kat made her way down the mountain first. Her grace afld tight ski, pants morE than made up for forcing an emtire ski school off the side of tbe mountain. Rob sped off ne:xt and ·encountered a small pr~blem when a large tree It's the Law! jumped in the middle of his path. He later agreed that an extra pitcher of courage would have gone, nicely with l1is slice of humble ·pie. Adam folllld the incident all too amusing and fell to the ground in his hysterics. Unfortunately the vibrations from his fall set off an avalanche and wiped out the ledge and half the parking lot. The three of us were then irivited to leave the m().untain., asked never to return again. So Captain Crash, Avalanche Adam, and Courageous Kat drove off into the sunset, proud of the day's accomplishments. As a ski enthusiast ol)ce said, j'No guts, no glory.\ Bil.t as we like to put, \Much. beer, no fear,\ Happy Skiing! · Be kill)!

Anne Carl '88 Japan Computers For Everyone To tl'ie ~ditor: This letter is in response to the cornputer questionnaire we were a.sked to fill in at registr-ation. I took advantage of the comments section, but . feel it worthwhile to V(Jice my sentim.ents publicly.

I do all my W'()r\k on a computer, and despite some of my grades, I be1iEvre it has enhanced my abilit~ to think and explain th(lse tb()ughts clearly.· ·- N.()~ tbat the college has proliJicied for all of the dorm roo~J~S oa campus to access the central computers, also recently upgraded, I thought the next step, that of providing a computer unit, or even just a terminal .for each campus room, would, in addition to the free standing terminals around the campus, truly provide an atmosphere best suited to what should be a computer literate college community. There are some practical reasons for the College to outfit each room with a computer. Providing a computer would ·mitigate a student's need to purchase one that in only a few years would be rendered ob- solete. A terminal access to the central computer would enable the student to learn to use a comp11ter, become comfortable with it, and exploitive of the power it can offer. By learning to use the computer, the student's work will no doubt be aided and enhanced. After graduation, a more computer- knowledgeable person will be a betteF consumer an<i user of computers.

CONCORJJIENSIS. January 15, 1987 Page 11 LETTERS Fi~ancial t\id: Top Prio:rity To the Editor: In contrast to the 'federal government's efforts to slash student fi:fiancial aid, Governor Cuomo in his State of the State address reiterated New York State's commitment to making higher ed11cation accessible to all high school graduates, regardless of their financial means. At a time when the changing economy requires more and more highly educated citizens, we are appalled by the federal government's short~sighted approach and commend the Governor for his vision. New York State is undergoing the most difficult and far-reaching economic restructuring the state has eltperienced since the onset of industrialization. Over the next decade the nwnber or jobs requiring a college degree will increase by 45 percent- three times the growth rate projected for all jobs in the economy. Specifically, we are very Tenure Prof. To the Editor: A great tragedy has befallen Union College. Our institution which boasts of its excellence in academia is losing one of its best professors. I am writing about Professor Barbara Markiewicz, assistant professor ofpsychology, and the college's decision not to grant her tenure. If you are as shocked as I am at the decision against her tenurability, you must be wondering what can be done to correct this grave error. The first step has aleady been made: Professor Markiewicz has requested a reconsideration herself. This request has opened up her case once again. 'lhe Faculty Review Board (FRB), which is made up of five faculty members, will soon meet on the issue of whether or not she should be granted a recon- sideration. · .t\ft;er speaking with members of the FRB and with Vice president DaAndrea, it seems that the best possible form of student input would be to send a letter to the president stating your opinions on her abilities as a professor. When directly questioned, Professor Ludwig, chairman of the FRB, agreed that many voluntary student letters might be considered as evidence, although he would not be definltivein his answer. Vice pleased: with the Governor's proposal to restructure the Tuition Assistance Program (TAP). 'lbe TAP program has historically allowed financially needy New York State citizens access to a college education. However, because the awards have not kept pace with in- flation, there has been a con- tinuing erosion of applicants. To address this problem the awards for all students must be increased. We would also like to com~ mend the Governor for his recognition of the State's higher education research institutes which serve as centers for economic development. These centers have done much to attract new industries into the State. Sincerely, C. Mark Lawton President Commission on Independent Colleges and Universities Markiewicz! President D'Andrea added that \It's not the volume of letters, it's the quality.\ If you Iiave had Dr. Markiewicz as a professor or feel that you can evaluate her contribution to Union College, then you might be able to do something about this serious situation. I cannot persuade you to do anything you do not wish to do. However, I believe that many of you will not need any persuasion, just as 1 had none'in writing this letter. If you do wish to write, you don't have much time. The FRB cannot delay their meeting to wait for voluntary letters, and they plan to meet any day now. Therefore, if you choose to write, de so as soon as possible.

COMMENTARIES PAUL SCHOP ••• From the Albany Desk New Faces on 1987 Last week marked the opening of the 210th session of the New York State legislature. Although last November's election results produced little change in the partisan makeup of either house, this session will undoubtedly be much different than last year's. The reason for this difference is the change in the Assembly leadership. After Stanley Fink surprised many observers with his retirement announcement last spring, a vacancy was created in the Speaker's office. After months of discrete political bargaining, Melvin Miller was chosen by the 94 Assembly Democrats to su~ ceed Fink. He was officially installed as Speaker last week. Miller's new position affords him the use of power un- matched by the leader of any other state legislative chamber. For instance, as Speaker, he · chooses not only who will serve on each committee, but also who each committee's chair- man will be, how large each Assemblyman's office budget will be, and how large his or her staff will be. Such power can either enhance or destroy an Assemblyman's career. Prior to his election as Speaker, Miller served as the chairman of the very powerful Codes Committee, which oversees all changes in the state's crimiiW. laws. Miller bas promised t() .be even more independent of Governor Cuomo than his predecessor was. Considerillg the faettbat in 1984, Fmk helped to Lead the fight against Cuomo's 2l·year- old purchue age bill, in a year in which that bill WIIS the governor's mast desired piece of legislati()n, tuomo may face some difficult legislative roadblocks in tbe future~ In the Senate last week, there was also a change in leadership. Stanley Lmdi:ne was sworn in on New Year's Day as New York's Lieutenant G()vernor, thus making llim the Senate's President, an.d techni<:ally its leader. Lundi!l's Senate duties, like those of tlle vice president, are very minimal, and they consist of voting to brealt ties. A tie in the Se11ate is e:xtremely rare, since rnost Senat()rs vote according to a straight party line and the Republicans have 36 to 25 seat edge. Warren Anderson, who has lleen the Senate's Maj()rity Leader since 1973, will continue to :hold that post throughout this ter-m. Inaugurations were not the only official functi(ms per- formed in Albany last week. Governor Cu()rno also gave his annual State of the State speech, in wb.ich he o11tlined his 1987 legislative agenda. The governor vaguely descr~bed several new programs, such as a plan to provide a full day of public school for 60,000 econonncally dbadvantaged four-year-olds, where they would receive proper health care. Other proposals included new ethics in government legislation, and a proposed cap on state spending, which was over $40 billion last year. Clearly, the most important section of the governor's speech was on how to \lSe the $1.7 billion in new tax revenue that the state will receive courtesy of the new federal tax laws.

T·he Nott • • • lr·on Maide·n 'gnite RPI Fieldhouse Hilary: Tann- Ta~£her & fnmposer f$y JAN GOLDSTEIN ''Th·is is The Ho,use'' ByMAJUORIElHOFFER Thanks to Professor Huggins whotook note of the .group while she . was doing research in Washington, DC, the Union College community was witness to a remarkable production. of •&This Is The House\ on Tuesday night. The play was written, produced and acted by two incredible women, Rebecca Rice and Janet Stanford~ Rice and Stanford both have strong interests and backgrounds in , the theater, created their own company, The Human Bridge Theater in 1984. The purpose of tbe theater is to literany bridge ideas and feelings from actor tc;» audience and even within the ,performance itself. Rice, the more dynamic force on stage, is a black woman who comes from a lower class background, as opposed to Stanford, a skilled actress as well, who is white and comes from a wealtheir llome. With the interest to do a play about women, when Rice and Stanford collaborated, the on).y universal themes found were pregnancy and violence towards women. Because a play has already been done on pregnancy, Rice and Stanford chose the challenging task of writing a play on the latter subject. A lot of the material for • 'This Is The House'' came from the authors' research done at battered women shelters. Though many people try to communicate social themes using theater as a medium, r'arely are the results as moving and gripping as Rice and Stanford's drama. They suc- cessfully portray women who are victims to violence. Through a variety of sketches, different characters react to many tupes abuse from men. Due to the nature of the topic the performance was not only intense, and somewhat depressing but remarkable in the sense that most members of the audience could identify with Jl~BRIANFEBGUSON ! Eigbt thousand screaming metal maniacs packed·.into the BPI Houston Field. House to witness the .awe$Qme spectacle oflronMaidenlive. The concert was only the fourth show on the North American leg .of their \Somewhere on Tour'' road show ;md the .band wasat their peak for the first sellout crowd of the tour. at least one of the situations protrayed. ·So, although the majority of the scenes were hopefully foreign in terms of , actual. experiences of thi's particular audience-Rice and Stanford had so much energy and skill as actors that they were able to clearly portray the pain, agony and suffering ex- perienced by their characters~ Thus, the audience was able to respond with sincere anger that built up during the per· fonnance. This ~e play has also 'been helpful to other As ·the lights went down, a ·: spaceman floated above the ~owd while a blimp. emerged . trom stage left and a starsbip · battered women whose lives are infinitely worse than the characters' in the production. Unf9rtunately the drawbacks to this type of drama have hurt the .publicity of the play. Stanford and Rice realiZe that the intensity of the subject matter deters a large portion of a potential audience. As well, the majority of the audience was, and invariably is, women. Men perhaps !!.~ed to see the production more importantly than women do, however, the purpose of the performance is not to reform 'men, for the ac- tors are aware of the im- possibility of this task. Instead, they hope to make the survivors of violence feel proud of their achievements. The Battered Women's cause reeives little funding and even in conjunction with-the arts, Rice and Stanford are therefore unable to further their message. It is terribly unfortunate that a production with this much talent and social consciousness does not receive more publicity. For it is rare that Theater does so snc- cessfully reach out to our emotions to this extent. Far from being overdramatic (they do not even have a piece on rape), trite, or ridiculous, ''This I.s The House\ combines wonderful acting with insight and truth to create a powerful and moving drama that goes deep intc. the minds of the audience. from stage right, in keeping ' with the fururistic • 'time · travel'' theme of their new : alblJIIl. \Somewhere In Time\.

The play was written, produced and acted by two incredible women, Rebecca Rice and JaHet Stanford. Rice and Stanford both bave strong interests and backgrounds in the theater, created their own company, The Human Bridge Theater in 1984. The purpose of the theater is te literally bridge ideas and feelings from actor to audience and even within the performance itself. Rice, the more dynamic force on stage, is a black woman who comes from a lower class background, as opposed to Stanford, a skilled actress as wetl, who is white and comes fr0m a wealtheir home. With the interest to do a play about women, when Rice and Stanford collaborated, the only universal themes found were pregnancy and violence towards women. Because a play has already been done on pregnancy, Rice and Stanford chose the challenging task of writing a play on the latter subject. A lot of the material for \This Is The House\ came from the authors' research done at battered women shelters. Though many people try to communicate social themes using theater as a medium, rarely are the results as moving and gripping as Rice and Stanford's drama. They suc· cessfully portray women who are victims to violence. Through a variet)· of sketches, different characters react to many tupes abuse from men. Due to the nature of the topic the performance was not only intense, and somewhat depressing but remarkable in the sense that most members of the audience rould identify with • • • at least one of the situations protrayed. So, although the maiority of the scenes were hopefully foreign in terms of actual experiences ef this particular audience-Rice and Stanford had so much energy and skill as actors that they were able to clearly portray the pain, agony and suffering ex- perienced by their characters. Thus, the audience was able to respond with sincere anger that b11ilt up during the per- formance. This same play has also been helpful to other battered wmnen whose lives are infinitely worse tban the characters' in the preduction. Unfortunately the drawbacks to this type of drama have hurt the publicity of the play. Stanford and Rice realize that the intensity of the subject matter deters a large portion of a p0tential audience. As well, the majority of the audience was, and invariably is, women. Men pel~haps need to see the production more impertantly than women do, however, the purpose of the performance is not to reform men, for the ac- tors are aware of the im- possibility of this task. Instead, they hope to make the survivors of violence feel proud of their achievements. The Battered Women's cause reeives little funding and even in conjunction with the arts, Rice and Stanford are therefore unable to further their message. It is terribly unfortunate that a production with this much talent and social consciousness does not receive more publicity. For it is rare that Theater does so suc- cessfully reach out to our emotions to this extent. Far from being overdramatic (they do not even have a piece on rape), trite, or ridiculous, \This Is The House\ combines wonderful acting with insight and truth to create a powerful and moving drama that goes deep into the minds of the audience. Jayne Cortez at Union l:y MARJOR.IE HOFFER The Winter Improvisation Series opens this week with a performance of Poetry and Music. Jayne Cortez, a renowned poet will he joined with three musicians: Denardo Coleman on drwns, Bernard ~~ix on guitar, and Ai Mac- dowell on bass. Cortes, who is currently living in New York City I and uses this location for the subject matter of some of her recent works), has had her work published in a variety of journals, magazines, and an- thologies. She has lectured throughout the United States, Europe, Latin America, and the Carribean. A recipient of many awards, most recently Cortez has received the 1986 National Endowment for the Arts Fellowship in Creative Writing. Her subject matter con- centrates on the struggles of both blacks and whites. Cortez: has also participated in the Uni•;ersity of Iowa \Readings Against Reagan\. One of the reasons why Cortez's poetry receives so much attention is the fact that she combines it with music to intensify the sound. And, in fact, she had made three recordings, done two films, and even produced a video, \Jayne Cortez in Con- cert\. The following performances in the series are: Words & Mus1c featuring composer- performer Julie Kabat and Mitchell Korn on Friday, January30. Dance & Music with Lakshmi, Bharatanatyam Dancer and T. Viswanthan on flute and voice, on Friday, Debruary 13. And, finally, Minstral Donals Heller, a puppeteer. will present a show of Theater and Music on Friday, February 27. All concerts begin at 7:~9 p.m. in the Performing Arts Studio in the Arts Building and admission for all events is free of charge. lron Maiden 'gnite RPI Fieldhouse By BRIAN FERGUSON Eight thousand screaming metal maniacs packed into the RPI Houston Field House to witness the awesome spectacle of Iron Maiden live. The concert was only the fourth show on the North American leg of their \Somewhere on Tour\ road show and the band wasat their peak for the first sellout crowd ofthe tour. As the lights went down, a spaceman floated above the crowd while a blimp emerged from stage left and a starship from stage right, in keeping with the fururistic ''time travel\ theme of their new album \Somewhere In Time\. The: curtain drew back and the band appeared, launching into the title track from the new album. The stage itself was impressive, featuring sleek chrome risers on either side of the drum kit and a giant back- drop resembling the cover of the new albwn. The band members (Bruce Dickinson- vocals, Steve Harris- bass, Dave Murray and Adrian Smith· guitars, Niko McBam- drims) were extremely excited for the show and sounded in- credibly tight, especially considering that it was only the fourth show. The crowd mat- ched them, being especially rowdy. After only the second song, a chant of \Mai-Den! Mai- Den!\ started that was so loud Dickinson could only step back and wait for it to subside. The song selection featured some of Maiden's finest material, as they burned through renditions of \Two Minutes to Midnight\ \Stranger in Strange Land\ \Wasted Years\ \Hallowed Be Thy Name\ \Phantom of the Opera\ and \The Rhyme of the Ancient Mariner\. During \Heaven Can Wait\ the band's 'mascot' and visual centerpiece \Eddie\ lurnbered on stage. Twelve feet high and now resembling \The Terminator\ he and Dickinson engaged in a chaotir, explosive gun battle. The show's closer, \Iron Maiden\ saw a· :nuge \Eddie\ head arise beneath the drum riser and lift it 2CI· feet into the air while two hu~e hands rose up and grasped menacingly at tbe front of the stage~ The members appeared for a riotous triple barrel encore • featuring the controversial Maiden classic, c\I'lle Nwnber of the Beast\ \Run To the Hills\ and a seeond. encore of their first-ever :;ingle, \Run- ning Free\ which featured a crowd competition singnalong. In all, the set covered 13 songs, 7 of which clocked in at over seven minutes long. Musically, there is no metal band around today tllat can come close to matching Maiden when it comes to instrumental skill or song-writing ability. Their songs are extremely incricate and the lyrics reflect an intelligence tllat few gands, metal or not, can match. The fact that the songs . are as complex as they are and are still delivered by a band con- sidered to be one of the world's hardest is quite a feat. Any skeptics need only to listen to MaideD's 13-minute masterpiece, \Tile Rime of the Ancient Mariner\ their adaptation of Samuel Taylor Coleridge's epic poem, to realize the talent and musical depth of the band. It is no wonder that the Harmony Encyclopedia of Rock said of them, \Iron Maiclen offer sonic assault, but heavy metal is a tag which is too limiting for a band with interesting lyrics and a melody or two between the riffs. Critics who dismiss this band's hard rock miss much ex- citement and gQ()d music.\ Opening for Iron Maiden was metal's newest guitar god, Yngwie Malrnsteen, and he, himself, did not disappoint a crowd that was awaiting a blistering six-string assault. His backup band, however, was far inferior to Malmsteen's talents. Vocalist Jeff Scott-Soto was especially eisappointing, possessing no charisma and ARTS Hilary Tmm ..

Ms. Tann's musical endeavors go far beyond the gates of Union College. Ms. TaJlll is a composer whose works are beginning to be performed around the nation. She also edits the newsletter of women com· posers, studies conducting and takes lessons on the Japanese flute. Hilary Tam treats music with respect. Hilary Tann began writing music at age eight and has been writing ever since except for a brief period oovering her first marriage. She was raised in a small coal mining valley L11 the south of Wales. In 1972, Ms.nTann came to the United States in order to accept a fellowship frc>m Princeton University. Later. she received a PhD in Composition from· Princeton. Presently, Ms. Tann is married to jazz musician, Jeff Presslaff. Ms. 'l'ann drives to Berlin, NY to st11dy conducting every two weelcs with teacher Edgar Curtis. Curtis is an emeritus professor of music at Union and a previous music director of the Albany Sym· phony Orchestra. Union College is lucky to have a professor like Hilary Tann on their staff. remaining unirltElligible during most of the show. For the most part, Malmsteen's songwriting ability falls far short of his playing ability, and his lyrics are laughable. Only one song, ''I Am A Viking., displayed any real potential. On the instrumental \Far Beyond The .Sun\ however, Malmsteen was amazing, and when he took center stage for his solo, he achieved a level of guitar ability the likes of which this reviewer has never heard, surpassing even one Eddie Van Halen. Malmsteen needs only to improve his songwriting and to find a way to better in- corporate his incredible talent within his song structure to achieve superstardom. ·.·····.···.N·I···NGs·· H ·A·' ··P· ·-P·· :.·E· ' .. ·.··,. : ...... ···· .. ···· ...•. : •. •• - -. .- •• - .;.

CONCORDiENSIS, January 15, 1987 Page 13 THE ARTS· 11 Papa John\ Phillips Jan and Buddy By MARK BOLSON and JASON GREEN The ·show was scheduled to ~gin at 7':30. My driver and oo.nfidan.te, c. F. Greim and I rUShed out of the house at abo11t 6:45' and resigned ourselves to the· fact that we had probably missed the first four or five songs of \Papa John'' Pbillips a-nd his pick-up l,>and at Saratoga 1 s famed .Caffe Lena. Th.e elements and time . were against us, but when Green pulled the radar detector out from under the seat, I knew we stood a chance of arriving on time, Not surprisingly we found ourselves at the front door of ,the cafe on schedule. \Papa John,\ the patriarch of the Mamas And The Papas took the stage an hour later. My first impressions of . Caffe · Lena had prepared me to expect and even enjoy the delay. The in- formal ambiance of the club becomes immediately apparent when greeted at the door by.tbe infamous proprietor, Lena Spencer. Lena chatted amiablY with the audience as they fned in, helping them to their seats and snaring stories from ber r}ast as a philanthropist. for young folk musicians~ The Caffe Lena, the oldest coffee house in the country, is uniquely northeastern, with its hardwood floors and hearty good cheer. Lena directed us to table 18, just left of the stage. Once seated, we ordered hot tea to nip the winter chill in our bones and waited for the show to· begin. The lights dimmed and Leria was led to. the stage, to iritroduce .. the .. evenmg's'. per- formance. Instruments in tow, the band appeared from the back of the Caffe. There was no mistaking Papa John, sporting his bright sparkling smile and long, white~ wavy mane, ninibly manuevering. his 6'4'' frame through. the crowded tables to the stage. Warned by Phillips that the night was going to be a family night, we. were en• tertained by his sU:-year-old daughter, Bijou, who helped her fatber in introducing his show to the eager audience. After a sltort greeting, the band went into their first song, ''California 'Dreaming''. The pick-up band conSi$ted of three musicians from Saratoga and Papa Jolm's fdend . and lawyer, Walter, on the bongos. Despite the fact that the band had.only been together for three nights the· soWld was excellent. The members ·of the band were well atuned and played off each other· brilliantly, each song highlighting. various members. There was usually some playful bickering .before each song as to which key it was in. Papa John was a quarter .of the way thr,ough one song before he realized he was in the wrong key. The band appeared puzzled as they fumbled about to keep some sort of tune and were relieved when Phillips finally realized his mistake. It was a treat to see a man who played S!JC~ an influenti!ll role in the sixties perform m such an intimate setting. HiS wit and charm shone through when sharing stories of his past with the audience. Papa John played old favorites such as \500 Mile~:!~', \M.e . ~d ,M:y -pncltf, . and the classic \.Callforma Dreaming.... But the show was \Get· Close\ with The Pretenders By JULIE STEINBERG The latest albwn by Tbe Pretenders entitled, Get Close is their first release since their hit album, Leandng To Crawl of several years .ago in 1982. During those four years, changes occurred within The Pretende~:s which altered the band's sound. Newcomers to the band are Blair Cunningham, T.M. Stevens and Berni.e Worrel leaving Chrissie Hynde as the only original Pretender, with the addition of Robbie Mcin- tosh. enhanc~::u Wlth a more rhythmic beat whiCh can be heard in \Dance''. Although this new sound adds an interesting twist to the Pretenders, the beat of - 0 >- <ll Q) +- '- :::;) 0 u classic songs such as· ''Brass in Pocket\ \Talk of the Town\ and \Middle of the Road\ is sadly missed. The style of \How Much Did You Get For Your Soul?\ has such a soul beat it sounds as if James Brown should be singing it instead of Chrissie Hynde. · Chrissie's creative talent can be seen in the lyrics of \My Baby\ which is one of the 'better tracks on the album. Also in- cluded' on Get Close are the hit single ''Don't Get Me Wrong\ and Jimi Hendrix's song \Room Full of Mirrors\. Get Close, the fourth alb~ by The Pretenders has shown drastic change in the . band's musical style. Get Clo11e is available on Sure Records. also peppered with new songs he has written for such artists as the Beach Boys, the Rolling Stones· and Madonna. His in• fluence as a ,songwriter is as great now as it was in the six- ties. Unfortunately, Phillips forfeited the rights to many of his songs such as \500 MUes\ which, .in retrospect, turned out to be an extremely poor financial decision and thus, many of the evening'~ songs were dedicated to his lost revenue. C. F. Greene and I enjoyed the performance and highly reconunend the Caffe Lena for anyone with an interest in folk music. The .intimacy of the Caffee and the diversity of the performers provides for a wonderful evening of en- tertainment. Call Caffee Lena at 583·1916 for information on upcoming performances.

' u ii:' '- ·ro E at tbe Movies The Morning After starring: Jane Fonda and Kurt Russel directed by: Sidney Lwnet R-rated A large majority of us know what it is like to awaken with no recollection of our previous night's endeavors. Jane Fonda, obviously, can only pretend to understand this common phenomena and attempts to do so in her new filin: The Morning After. .Fonda portrays .Alex Steebergen, a has-been actress, who wakes up in. bed next to a strange man with a knife in his chest. Fonda cannot account for her last night's activities due to her habit of procuring alcohol induced blackouts. After realizing she has no idea where she is nor the identity of the corpse lying next to her, Fonda displays momentary horror. She seems to regain her self composure within minutes. The entire film makes light of the fact that Fonda greeted the new morning in a bed drenched with blood next to a dead man with a butcher knife pr~truding f~om his chest. When Fonda dec1des to deal with her ordeal she calls her husband (only in the platonic sense of the word) for advice. Before telling him about her situation they chat for a spell. He advises h~r to ;call her l~wyer due to her p~\St history of v10lence. The baffling mystery of the film is ... Did Alex murder the stranger or was she framed?. Fonda attempts to go into hiding and somehow lands in the front seat of an ex-cop's car, Jeff Bridges. Not only is Jeff Bridges an ex-cop but he is an ex-cop with a knack for detective work. He falls in love with Fonda and sets out to prove her innocence. Jane Fonda does not make the transition from aerobic queen to eccentric lush with much conviction. Jeff Bridges plays his part of red neck ex-cop quite well. Bridges' character portrayal is the only bright part of the film. The music in the film continuously suggests that something dreadfully hoJ:rible is just about to happen. Nothing really does happen until the last two minutes, when the entire mystery is suddenly solved. Buddy was able to solve the mystery after the first ten minutes of the film, which is a sure indication of the en- tertainment value of The Morning After.

So- ~------------------------------------~ \;\View from the Bridge in Albany\ By NANCY G.RUNDMAN Arthur Miller's ''A View From The Bridge\ is playing at the Capital Rep. Theatre in Albany until February l. This show should not be missed. This small theatre lends itself to encapture the audience. One feels as if the actors are almost touching you. \A View From The Bridge\ is a tragedy of a family's downfall brought about by one man, Eddie Carbone and his blind obsession With his adored niece, Catherine. This family was torn apart when Beatrice Carbone had her two cou8ins come to live with them. The cousins, Marco > c: Ill .0 ;;( c: a Q) Ck: ci. Ill u - 0 > <f) Q) - I.. ::> 0 u and jealousy is apparent the first night the cousins came to the house. He saw a change in Catherine; she was innocently flirting with Rodolpho. Eddie finds Rodolpho \not right\: he sings while he works, cooks, sews, dresses, spends his money as soon as he makes it, and has the audacity to have blonde hair, which was unheard of in the Italian section of Brooklyn in the 1940's. Eddie and Catherine change throughout the play, while Eddie becomes more and more angy and irrational, Catherine grows and becomes more in- dependent. She is struggling to grow up and free herself of Eddie, without hurting him. shows the difficulty in breaking away from someone who had done so much for her during her · life. She is naive and innocent and does not realize the af- fection Eddie feels towards her is not fatherly but the feelings of a man who is in love with a woman. Diane Martella does a wonderful job in her protrayal of strong, yet broken down women who is fighting to try to keep her family together. Although she knows Eddie is obsessed with his niece and no longer is attracted to her, she still loves him and stands by him. Rafael Ferrer's beautiful features lent themselves wen to his character of Rodolpho, a young and interested man who Michael Fischetti is starring as Eddie Carbone, the Sicil!ari-American lo~gshore~an, .and Jen- nifer van oyck is catherine, his niece and the object of h1s uncomprehending pass1on, rn Art~ur Miller's classic drama, A VIEW FROM THE BRIDGE ..

The reply was that this war had been a traumatic loss of innocence for America, and that this in~ nocence could only be lost once. After reading Sheltered Lives, by Frank Milburn, it appears that innocence can be lost at least a second time. Milburn appears to be a direct literary descendant of Hemingway. His style of writing is very similar to Hemingway's, with its. short, simple, and yet extremely powerful sentences, that leave 7-8 of the plot entirely to the reader~s imagination. The plot revolves around David Winant. David is a Harvard undergraduate from one of the· North Shore's wealthiest families. Unfor- tunately for the Winants, npt only have they been blessed with money, but they have also been cursed with many problems. Rather than face these problems, David decides to run away from them by enlisting in the Army in the fall of 1963. The plot then advances to the winter of 1965. We see David coming home to Long Island, where he must begin to reconcile not only · with his immediate past, the twelve months that he has just spent in Viet Nam, but also with the problems that had forced him to enlist. His first problem is his mother. Once an active, athletic woman, she is now dying from the complications of thirty years of alcoholism. Another problem is the war that is raging between his father and his sister, Emily. The war was a result of his father's lack of attention toward his daughter, and his preoccupation with his bank, and his lover, Chantal. Desperate for attention, Emily countered his aloofness by embarrassing him, most · spectacularly by having an affair with. the neighbor's groom. The groom turned out to be an arsoni;rt and a thief, who seUii:e.to his employer's stable, which resulted in a stampede of thoroughbredS across the Long Island Expressway, and a tragic accident that left five horses dead and traffic backed up from Glen Cove to Montauk. In addition to his family problems, David must also reconcile with his feelings toward his longtime girlfriend, Elise M!)rneau, Chantal's daughter. He must also come to tenns with the feelings that he has toward Jane, the Widow ot Allen, his best friend in Viet Nam; and the mother of Allen's child. By the end of the book, David has solved all of his problems, although he is undoubtedly unhappy with many of the solutions. There is hope, however, that out of the ashes of this solution, that he will be able to find happiness in his adult life. Sheltered Lives is Milburn's second novel. At 183 pages, it is short enough to be read as one ni~ht's entertainment, and well written. enough to be remem- bered for many nights af- terwards Union COllege Departmen1 of the Arts Poet!:llo M!!.!!P POET JAYNE CORTEZ Denardo Cqleman, drums Barn Nu1, guitar AI MacDo*en. bass FRIDAY.

I 1 CONCORDIENSI:S, January 15, 1987 Poge/5 . . .. SCIENCE,.HEALTH, AND TECHNOLOGY Doing It In Private By A. J. HELFAND Pobre, pobre pre•meds. Now aside from soaring education< costs, cut-TIUWAT competition and endless hours of work, it appears as th<n~gh the llio-tech boys will be snatching away a good part of their market in a few years. By 1988, it has been estimated that almost 2 billion dollars will be diverted from your future peers to new Bio· technological firms. Aah, I Call see it now, all those easy bucks, $85 for a strep throat, $100 .for a :pregnancy test, et cetera, all down the drain. Well hey, the gravy train was bound to lose steam sometime. Th,e culprit? New high-te~h, do it at home detection kits which may diagnose everything from strep throat to gonorrhea, are now available over the counter at the drug store. Thoagh thE)se tests can't totally side..step the doctor, since he is needed to write prescription~ (might want to replace some of those tongtie depressors with more pens boy.s), who knows what the future holds'? Over-the-counter antibiotics perhaps? Of course physicians are just about as happy with this situation as dentists were when fluoride was added to water and toothpastes. Charles Smitben, of New York . Hospital-Cornell Medical Center, asks, \What if someone only tests for. one disease and doesn't know the S!illle symp- tom could signal an even more serious disorder? Or what if patientstryto treat themselves. >J Charles is obviously mtaware of how rnany people practically kill themselves in an effort to avoid the doctor's office. Besides, eventually one test-kit .and a drop of your blood and urine will ·test for everything fro:m a cold to lung c~ncer. Not to mention, who do you think is diagnosing your inore simple tests anyway, E1nstem? under-paid,. over-worked lab technicians are responsible for thousands of tests each day, leaving you to believe mix- ups and errors must be made. The first home detection test was introduced in 1977 by the Warner-Lambert Company. The e.p.t., home pregnancy test, brought a great deal of relief to rabbits around the world, for a woman need only mix urine with a reagent and wait.for a brown ring t.o form to 'lmow whether or not she's pregnant. The new test kits are basically \smart test tubes.\ They. are compact, disposable units containing a test tub with reagents, a microprocessor and a one-time battery. The kits are designed for maximum ac- curacy and simplicity. The tests for stre.p throat and ur~ary tract infections involve drop- ping throat swabs or W'ine, into the test tube and allowin~ them to incubate for a few hours. At the pre-de~ermined ~iLpe, : a The Protein/Cho.lesterol Crunch Hig}l-p_rotein foods may keep you alert, but they can also · reduce life expectancy. Many protein-rich foods-red meat, dairy products and bacon--are r'ich in saturated fats and cholesterol. While the body uses cholesterol to · make· cell membranes and adrenal and sex hormones, Americans consume more fat than necessary-a single egg exceeds . a day's needs. According to t.he National Institutes of H:ealth (NIH), elevated blo()d cholesterol is a direct cause of heart disease. · Cholesterol enters the blood stream in packets called LDLs, low-density lipoproteins, composed of fat with a protein coat. When an LDL passes a cell that needs cholesterol, the cell's LDL receptors grab it. Unused cholesterol may end up clogging arteries. The good news is that high- density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL), manufactured by the liver, scavenges unused LDLs from the blood and artery walls for excretion. A healthy HDL-to-LDL ratio is vital. According to Basil Rifkind, chief of the NIH's Lipid Metabolism and Atherogenesis Branch, staying away from fatty foods will decrease LDL.

This \home assist kit\ for men can detect gonorrhea. The \patient\ puts a specimen of discharge on a prepared slide, mails it to a lab and receives the results over the phone using a code number. Medical Fronteirs, the Dayton, Ohio based firm responsible for this _product guarantees anonymity. This has raised a few eyebrows due to Ohio laws requiring all cases of venereal disease to be reported. The good point about anonymity is that it might get some of the 50-55 percent of the cases that go unrep()rted diagnosed ~nd treated. A microchip in this kit reads the color density of a throat swab incubated with reagents. A blinking light indicates the diagno·sis. Abortion In The Future By JOHN BERGERON Recent advances in fetal medical technology have allowed doctors to save premature babies as young as 5 tnont.hs old. This was not possible 14 years ago when the Supreme .Court legalized abortion for fet-uses that are not yet viable, or not yet able to survive outside the womb. In this decision, individual states were ;given the power to ban aborti()ns of fetuses that could survive outside the womb with or without artificial help. Today, viability is considered to be at 24 weeks, 4 weeks earlier than viability at the time of the Supreme Court's ruling in 1973. So w.hat happens if dramatic advances in medicine . occur that allow a fetus to- survive after only 12 weeks? Suppose fetuses could someday be supported by artificial gesticulation from the time of conception. Would abortion be illegal? Because the Court's decision is based on the viability of the fetus, this decision could eventually be an anti-abortion decision, These medical advances are not right around the corner, but their possibility cannot be denied. If viability were decreased by only another 4 weeks, tt.E>n abortions because of fetal de~~f:is would be hin· dered. Whim ai:. amniocentesis is performed to check for mental or central nervous system defects, the results are not available until the 2oth week of pregnancy. The hypothetical reduction of viability to the 2oth week would allow little or no time for the woman to abort her defective fettis if she wished to do so. The group most likely to get late second trimester abortions, young teenagers, could be affected by any decrease from the current 2.4th week. These teenagers tend to deny their pregnancies out of fear lliltil the pregnancies are physically evident to them- selves and others. It is important to understand the Supreme Court's decision of viability of the fetus in its own context. Although it is not stated in the Court's ruling, it is most likely that they meant that a viable fetus is one that has most or all of the physical develop- ment of a baby and possesses the same emotional and in- teractional characteristics of a new-born baby. In the future, the law must be clarified as to whether its intent was to let medical technology decide a woman's right to an abortion or the commonly understood but unwritten intent to let the woman have the right to decide for or against an abortion throughout a sub- stantial of her nr\'<Tng I -

The next day, Kurt collected 24 points a·nd 5 rebounds in limited play due to the full game rout over Con- necticut College.

From here, Uni()n kept its lead at double figures in rolling to its third straight win. Kurt Fox scored 19 points and grabbed 15 rebounds to pace Union. Joe Romer chipped in 15 points to the winning cause. The Dutchmen came back the next night and bested host R. r. T. 71 ;.59 to claim the championship.

Only dter 40 grueling minates of regulation play, one overtime period and a last second, fall-away, desperation 23~foot jumpshot, was Nazareth able to claim a 71- 68 victory. The Dutchmen got off to another slow start, falling behind 14-5 after six and a half minutes of action. They could get no closer the rest of the half as Nazareth maintained its nine point lead, to go in at halftime leading 38-29. · The second half was another story.

By ANDREW MILLER With a Perspective on Sports is a column that will attempt to pat people and events into . f<lcus. Its purpose is to make y<m the reader see, feel, ao.d think. It will transport you to a scene, make some judgments, and Mpefully stir some reac- tion. Seeing people first, games second, in a new and fresh angle, is this column's aim. 'This week's Perspective on Sports issue deals with character, and What better character to .talk about than Brian Bosworth. Bosworth, a man known for his vicious defensive play and unusual hairstyles, has made the news again. Unfortunately, this notoriety is not the result of his usual, or unusual, on-field antics. This multi-talented and multi-quoted 6-foot-2-inch, 238 pound linebacker has stirred up a controversy within the National Collegiate Athletic Association that has brought the issue of drug regulation to a head. Bosworth, winner of the Butkus award for the nation's olltstanding inebacker, has been a strong propOnent .of the NCAA's drug crackdown. Ironically, the Oklahoma linebacker was the first big name involved in the banning of more than 20 college football players for the use of steroids. The NCAA instituted drag tests for the first time this· year for championship events and some bowl games in an effort to prevent. the use of more than a hlUldred bannetl generic drugs. The banned drugs ranged from marijuana and cocaine to anabolic- and oil-based steroids. Eosworth tested positive for anabolic steroids which he claimed were tal,en back in March of '86. The steroids were prescribed to Bosworth .by a medical doctor for a shoulder injury sustained in athe '86 season ending victory over Penn State in the Orange Bowl. Bosworth and the other temporarily banned player~ point deficit with 3:29 remaining in regulation, but held Nazareth scoreless the rest of the period while converting two fast break lay-ups. The second bucket, by Neil Winawer with 0: 03left, sent the game into overtime. . Two .field goals by Doug Gregory and Ken Levine put Union ahead 66-62 with 3: 50 t(} play. But Nazareth countered with 6 unanswered points to take a 68-66 lead. Joe Romer's 1 16-footer tied the score With 58 seconds left to set up Joe Convertino's winning shot. Kurt· Fox once again led Union with 16 points. Doug Gregory (14 p()ints and 8 rebounds), Neil Winawer (11 points and 12 rebolUlds) and Joe Romer (10 points and.6 rebounds) all added to the Dutchmen effort. A week ago Tuesday, Div. II LeMoyne College made a visit to Memorial Fieldhouse. This was Union's first game after a four-week lay-off: Nonetheless, this rather long break from playing seemed to have no effect on the Dutchmen, as they matched the much taller D()lpbins point-for-point throughout the first 20~minute stanza. As the teams left the floor at intermission, Union clung to a 36-35 laed. To .begin the last half, the Dutchmen increased their advantage. They were up by- a 51·47 count with 13:25 accepted their punishments, but they questioned the NCAA's policies on banned drugs, the r~ght to test, and invasion of privacy. The questioning of these policies brings u,p many in- teresting points of judgment. As a citizen in this country, it is · against the law to use marijuana and cocaine. It is not against the law to use steroids. Yet, the NCAA allowed an in- disclosed number of marijuana and cocaine users who tested positive to play in the holiday football bowls and other college championship series. In con- trast, they barred numerous athletes who tested positive for steroids, a drug that takes 9-10 months to clear one's system- unlike pot which takes ap- proximately 30 days. Has the NCAA taken to punishing the innocent and pr()tecting the guilty? Although steroids are said to have, if taken improperly, harmful side effects including the develop- ment of liver tumors, there has been no documented case of one football player, college or pro, who has suffered any ill effects from taking steroids. Ask the same question about users of cocaine and marijuana and the number of cases run in the hlUldreds in the NFL alone who have needed to seek treatment in the past five years. \Thy has the NCAA taken steps to cover up the trail of illegal drug users? The problems of invasion of privacy and the right to test have been legal smokescreens the NCAA has used against themselves in their reasonings to ban and disclose names of athletes who tested dirty for illegal drugs. Smoothing out the footprints of · illegal drug users in college sports is a tactic used by the NCAA to cover up the seriousness of drugs in college football, and college athletics in general. B()sworth, although breaking the NCAA statute, was a big name pawn used in the media. game of fighting drugs in America's future generations. remaining, when the bottom fell o11t. LeMoyne went on an 18-4 rlUl, turning a four point deficit into a 65-55 lead. This stretch was keyed by two 3-point baskets by Pete Jerebko. Union was able to hang tough and with six minutes to go only trailed by 6. However, after trading baskets for the next couple of minutes, the Dutclunen found themselves faced with the same deficit. They managed to close the gap slightly, but it was just to() little, too late as the Dolphins won the game 70-67. K11rt Fox pwnped in 22 points and Torn Beck added 12 in the losing cause. DUTCHMEN NOTES ... Entering their game with Middlebury on Wednesday night, the Dutchmen were led in scoring by Kurt Fox (18.1 ppg), JoeRomer (11.8) and Tom Beck (11.2). Fox was also the leading rebounder (8.3 rpg), followed by Romer, Doug Gregory and Neil Winawer (all at 5.1 rpg) ... One qllite interesting statistic is that ()f the six players seeing the m~st playing time, only Ken Levine is shooting below 48 percent from the field.

The banned drugs ranged from marijuana and cocaine to anabolic- and oil-based steroids. Bosworth tested positive for anabolic steroids which he claimed were taken back in March of '00. The steroids were prescribed to Bosworth by a medical doctor for a shoulder injury sustained in athe '86 season ending victory over Penn State in the Orange Bowl. Bosworth and the other temporarily banned players point deficit with 3: 29 remaining in regulation, but held Nazareth scoreless the rest of the period while converting two fast break lay-ups. The second bucket, by Neil Winawer with 0: 03left, sent the game into overtime. Two field goals by Doug Gregory and Ken Levine put Union ahead 66-62 with 3:50 to play. But Nazareth countered with 6 unanswered points to take a 68~6 lead. Joe Romer's , 16-footer tied the score with 58 seconds left to set up Joe Convertino's winning shot. Kurt Fox once again led Union with 16 points. Doug Gregory (14 points and 8 reboWlds), Neil Winawer (11 points and 12 rebounds) and Joe Romer (10 points and 6 rebounds) all added to the Dutchmen effort. A week ago Tuesday, Div. II LeMoyne College made a visit to Memorial Fieldhouse. This was Unim'l's first game after a four-week lay-off. Nonetheless, this rather long break from playing seemed to have no effect on the Dutchmen, as they matched the much taller Dolphins point-for-point throughout the first 20-minute stanza. As the teams left the floor at intermission, Union clung to a 36-35 laed. To begin the last half, the Dutchmen increased their advantage. They were up by a 51-47 count with 13:25 accepted their punishments, but they questioned the NCAA's policies on banned drugs, the right to test, and invasion of privacy. The questioning of these policies brings up many in- teresting points of judgment. As a citizen in this country, it is against the law to use marijuana and cocaine. It is not against the law to use stereids. Yet, the NCAA allowed an in- disclosed number of marijuana and cocaine users who tested positive to play in the holiday football bowls and other college championship series. In con- trast, they barred numerous athletes who tested positive for steroids, a drug that takes 9-10 months to clear one's system- unlike pot which takes ap- proximately 30 days. Has the NCAA taken to punishing the innocent and protecting the guilty? Although steroids are said to have, if taken improperly, harmful side effects including the develop- ment of liver tumors, there has been no documented case of one football player, college or pro, who has suffered any ill effects from taking steroids. Ask the same question about users of cocaine and marijuana and the number of cases run in the hundreds in the NFL alone who have needed to seek treatment in the past five years. Why has the NCAA taken steps to cover up the trail of illegal drug users? The problems of invasion of privacy and the right to test have been legal smokescreens the NCAA has used against themselves in their reasonings to ban and disclose names of athletes who tested dirty for illegal drugs. Smoothing out the footprints of illegal drug users in college sports is a tactic used by the NCAA to cover up the seriousness of drugs in college football, and college athletics in general. Bosworth, although breaking the NCAA statute, was a big name pawn used in the media game of fighting drugs in America's future generations. remaining, when the bottom fell out. LeMoyne went on an 18-4 rWl, turning a four point deficit into a 65-55 lead. This stretch was keyed by two 3-point baskets by Pete Jerebko. Union was able to hang tough and with six minutes to go only trailed by 6. However, after trading baskets for the next couple of minutes, the Dutchmen found themselves faced with the same deficit. They managed to close the gap slightly, but it was just t'Oo little, too late as tht: Dolphins won the game 70~7. Kurt Fox pumped in 22 points and Tom Beck added 12 in the losing cause. DUTCHMEN NOTES .. Entering their game with Middlebury on Wednesday night, the Dutchmen were led i!l scoring by Kurt Fox (18.1 ppgl, Joe Romer (11.8) and Tom Beck (11.2).

Both external aBd internal factors have con- tributed to China's rapid economic change and its sub- sequent political unrest. The external factors include China's 'Great Leap Outward', its at- tempt to acquire Western technologies by bringing in Western ideas and techniques and by sending students abroad to study. A great internal factor shaping reform is the in- troduction of marketization to the Chinese economy. Both factors have brought exposure to other societies and their ideas to Chinese students. This ex- posure in turn has caused the students to want greater political freedoms and equally greater control over their own situations. Admission to Chinese in- stitutions of higher learning is extremely difficult. According to a recent editorial in the New York Times, \only 4 percent of the nation's 12.8 million high school seniors managed to find places in universities and ·colleges\. With such fierce competition, it is surprising that students would be willing to join demonstrations and risk ex- pulsion from the universities. Stuart Odell, a junior who participated in Union's Term Abroad Program in China, remarked that the Chinese students ''seem extremely appreciative of the op- portunity\ and that he and the other Union students in the program were \extremely surprised\ to learn of the protests. Professor Thurston, a history professor and the Resident Advisor of the Term Abroad Program in China, found the Chinese studen.ts to be \very interested in the concept of democracy and Western ideas and values.\ He also added that if China wants \to continue to modernize and develop economically, political reform is inevitable.\ Professor Bruce Reynolds of the Economics Department agrees, but cautions that \if they (the students) push too hard, they might jeopardize the progress made so far.\ Professor Thurston states that the students want political reform muc.h more rapidly than the government does, and this impatience has caused a political instability that may retard China's economic growth. in Implementation of Program By DAVID GULLIVER An investigation of the planning of Union's new telecommunications system shows that the plan was carefully conceived and executed; however, college administrators admit that the implementation and presen- tation of the system to tile students was poorly handled. Although technical problems have been minimal, student discontent about phone rates, and the cost of the system has not yet met with a response. A meeting between the resident advisors and John Hauser, vice- president for finance and ad- ministration, was criticized by the students present for again leaving the major questions . unanswered. Finally, this in- vestigation of the system also shows that it would be possible to separate charges for phone line and data line service, and that separate charges are in use at least one other major college. When discussing student opinion on campus, Dean of Students Joseph Mammola agreed that students were justifiably upset with \a number of key problems\ that lo.. C!J ..0 :::> lo..

Dean of Residence Life, David Wood. Planning The Pl1one-Data System De8.11 ()f Residence Life David Wood was on the planning committee for the telecom- municCJtions system (with Vice- President Hauser, Diane Winkler, Jack Hill of campus operations, former director of comp11ter services Wayne Holt, and Jirn O'Gorman, a con- sultant from the ELRA group of N. Y.C. ), and he provided the following history of the selec- tion of the system. In the fall of 1983, a committee formed to make a ''preliminary assessment\ of Union's needs . That original committee also included Gordon Decker, the director of development, and two stuclents, Bill Bashant and Chris Siler. (Both students have since been graduated from Union and could not be reached for comment.) That group, relying primarily on Holt and O'Gorman, wrote a proposal of what Union wanted for a system. The proposal was unavailable for review at the time of tllis writing. In the fall of 1984 they sent the proposal out to various com- panies as a request for responses. The College received about 20 replies; that number was narrowed down to about six \reputable\ firms by O'Groman who, in Wood's words, ''really knows what he's talking about.\ Since students were then on winter break, the smaller six-person committee listened to proposals from the companies and was dissatisfied with all of them. Over the course of the next year the committee met with the various companies, asking them to modify their proposals, and making visits to sites where the companies in question had already installed phone-data systems. The planning group decided to go with a modified NYNEX proposal about a year ago. Individual Data UneDispute The decision to wire each room for a data connection to the central VAX computer has been questioned. The original large committee, Wood said, decided \to wire each room if feasible.\ Wood said that he considered the \cluster idea,\ which places a group of ter- minals in one place in a dor- mitory for general use, but the colleges he contacted with such a system all \regret not wiring each room, because the clusters are overcrowded toward the end of a term.\ Director of Computer Ser- vices David V. Cossey, Assistant Director Louis P. Tremante and Technician Walter Cook discussed the elements of the data system. (In a future issue of Concordiensis, Computer Services will provide a listing of how to link up with the VAX, what extra equipment may be necessary for com- patibility, and what free soft- ware is available to students to facilitate VAX use.) They reminded students that the phone and data lines are Continued on page 3 {':·'-' ·''-, January 22, 1987 Ail-s Night Study Vandalized Prevention Measures Considered By CHRISTINE HONG Between 11:00 p.m. Friday night and 9:00 a.m. Saturday, an account of vandalism oc- curred in the Schaffer Library All-night Study, which ac- cording to Ms. Ann Seemann, Director of Schaffer Library, is enough to bring about a reconsideration of the status of ail-night study. The damage, which wa<;; discovered by a library staff member Saturday morning, included ap- proximately six study carrels which were 'broken to pieces' as well as upturned tables and trash strewn throughout the room. Although it 1s not possible to verify, it is suspected that the damage was caused by Union students. If so, said Ms. Seemann, \It is up to tile Dean of Students to take action (if the perpetrators are caught).\ One of the possibilities that the library is considering to prevent such occurrences from hap- pening is the assignment of a security member to the study area; however,accordingto Ms. Seemann, this requires ad- ditional money from the college. Already the college must provide for the repairs to the all-night study whieh were enough to close that area of the library for more than three days. Ironically, the vandalism occurred a day after Ms. Seemann had addressed a letter in Concordiensis to the cam- pus thanking them for the increased awareness and action to keep the library in a satisfactory condition fall term. When she heard of the news this past weekend, she foWld herself \disappointed\ that students \resort. to trashing institutional property on the weekends.\ r. \:: E Vl ttl u u CJ D (!) ex: -,..

In pW'suit of this task, the .office would be responsible for identifying or helping to define areas where research germane to that planning is needed, to carry on that research or to guide or assist others, and to provide consultation on planning and research efforts.'' News From the Financial Aid Office On October 17, 1986 President Reagan signed into law the llill that reauthorizes the Higb.er Education Act of 1965 and ex- tends the life of the Title IV federal student aid programs. These programs include Pell grants, Supplemental Education Opportunity Grants (SEOG), National Direct Student Loans (NDSL), Guaranteed Student Loans (GSL), and College Work..St11dy ( CWS). The new bill biings about some important cha11ges in student aid of which you should be aware. As of October 17, 1987~ all Guaranteed Student L()an applicants are now re~uired to demonstrate \need' to be eligible for a GSL. PreviollSly only those with an Adjusted Gross Income over $30,00() had to demonstrate \need.\ This means that now you will have to fill out the Financial Aid Fcmn (FAF) to apply for a GSL even if yoW' family's income is 1l!lder $30,000. Also, the originatioon fee has returned to its prev,ious level of 5 percent. Loans disbursed recently should reflect this change. Also effective immediately are increased loan limits under the PLUS and Supplemental Loans for Students (SLS replaces ALAS) progra.trlS of $4,000 annually and $t0,000 cumulatively. The Nationa~ Direct Student Loan _(NDSL, program has been renamed the Carl Perkins Loan and loan limits have also been increased to $4,000 for the first two years of undergraduate study and $9,000 for those who have completed two years of un- dergraduate study. Loan consolidation is also reactivated for student borrowers with at least $5,000 in outstanding student loans. As of January 1, 1987 some other important changes take effect. These include a new independent student definition and new Guaranteed Student Loan limits. Students wishing to establish financial in· dependence must pass one of the following tests: a) be 24 years old by December 31st of the award year; b) be an or- phan, ward of the court, a veteran, or have legal depen- dents other than a spouse; c) be a graduate or professional student who will not be claimed as a dependent for income tax purposes by a parent or guardian in the first year of the award year; d) be a single undergraduate student with no dependents who was not claimed as a dependent by a parent or guardian for the two years preceding the award year and who can demonstrate financial self-sufficiency with an annual total income of $4,000 or more; or 3) be a student for whom the Financial Aid Officer makes a documented deter· mination of independence by reason of other unusual cir· cumstances. The old definition will no longer be in effect after January 1, 1987, but still holds true until then. The Reauthorization Act increases the annual and cumulative GSL loan limits for undergraduate and graduate student~. Students may borrow up to $2,625 for each of the first two years and up to $4,000 for each subsequent year of un,; dergraduate study to a cumulative total of $17,250. Graduate students may now borrow up to $7,500 per year for a cumulative total of $54,750 including undergraduate loans. Finally, .some other changes will take effect later in 1987 and 1988. These include a change in the interest rates for first-time Guaranteed Student Loan borrowers after July 1, 1988. Students in repayment will pay 8 percent for the first four years and 10 percent for the sub- sequent years of repayment. As you may have realized, these changes will have far- reaching effects on student aid. If you have any questions or concerns about this or the ef- fects of the Reauthorization Act, please contact the Financial Aid Office at 371).9123. We will be happy to discuss with you the impacts of this major _p_iece of legislation.

Because of the drenching rains, I had to come very close to the Wall in order to read the names. I wasn't much concerned with them for I had not known any of them. None of my relatives had fought in Vietnam and my only recollection of the war was hearing Walter Cronkite report the strange names that were the sites of Southeast Asian cities. I had read a few ef the names but what I was more concerned about was the feeling that the Memorial gave me. · had Visited the black polished walls with 58,000 names carved on them. The Memorial chose to remain as unpolitical as possible however, this was 'largely impossible for it commemorates the nation's most divisive war. Many of these pe<1ple were real; they did mean a lot to their friends and family and personal mementos and artifacts were left to them. Some of these are so difficult to understand: rocks, ceramic sculptures, autographed baseballs, and others which suggest that there was an in- dividual reason for why each one of these people should have not died in any war.

Jeffrey Van Detta, Winthrop Thurlow, $d David Wollin, with the support of professors Martha Huggins, James Underwood, and Thomas Warger. The first issue con- tained seven articles,. including one from Clark University in Worcester, Massachusetts, and was created to provide a forum for student research and writing. At this point, the Undergraduate Review was funded solely by the Union College Internal Education FoWldation. The second issue of the Undergraduate Rivew, in the Spring of 1984, was planned by Van Detta and Thurlow, with professors Warger and Huggins as advisol'S. This issue, also supported by the I.E.F. and Union's chapter .of Phi Beta Kappa, contained six articles, including one from ~verford College and one from Bryn Mawr. ,. The third and fourth issues, in Spring of 1985 and 1986 respectively, contained a larger total number of papers and two foreign language papers. The publication is now receiving submissions from Hamilton College and Skidmore. By 1985, the editorial board of the Undergraduate Review had added staff for clerical work, and was receiving support and advice from Dr. Thomas D'Andrea, Vice President for Academic Affairs. The current ~tor of the Review is Karen Larvamway. . The·Undergraduate Review is · now accepting submissions for · . its 1986-87 issue. Creative writing and editorial essays are not. accepted.

This has been seen in the fact that companies have· been can- celling recruiting visits. At Boston University, four com- panies have cancelled tehir visits. 'lbe reason for this, according to one sociologist, is that universities are exceeding the demands of the labor market in the numbers of their graduates. · The University of Houston reports a ''sharp downturn in the demand for computer science, finance and engineering majors.\ $100,000 Grant for Summer Research .Union has been awarded a '100;000 grant from the Surdna Fo1n1dation of New York for student summer research in the basic sciences under the close supervision of faculty mentors.

Sunrise at Huangshan, giving the hand gesture of \We're in There.\ A Separate Journey By LORI RICHARD Can you picture three Union College students trekking through the Himalayan mountai.ns; living among Bhuddist monks, and yak.:. herding nomads? Sounds more like a part for Indiana Jones. Well, last month, Matt Hopkins, James Sawyer, and Lawrence Rosenthal met these and other challenges as they made their way through the ancient far eastern lands of Tibet and Nepal, finally crossing over into India. The adventurous threesome met their greatest challenge while en route to a village in Tibet. Within just a few miles of their destination, they were forced to abandon their jeep. The road leading down the mountain into the village had collapsed-the only way down was by foot. Matt, James, and Lawrence describe walking downhill on a dirt path in the middle of the night,.-with heavy bags-and holding flashlights in your teeth to guide you-as quite · an \interesting experience.\ Matt,- James and Lawrence are now safely back at Union, but when asked if they would do · it again, all have to say: Yes! They would do it in a second. ByALISON ABRAM$ Since I returned from China, all of my friends and relatives have been asking just one question... \So how was China?\ I'm sorry to say that that question cannot be an- swered in even as much as 10,000 words. In all honesty, I don't think that it can be an- swered in words, period·! Yes, photographs help a little to explain what I saw; however, they don't do anything to help · explain what I felt. How can I describe what-it felt like to walk on a path where Confucius once walked? Or what it felt like to be standing in the middle of Tiananmen Square, the place where so much of China's history is now falling apart? To write this artiCle is· pmbably the most monumental of tasks that I have attempted to conquer in a long time. Again, in all honesty, I don't want to answer \that\ question because that would be like telling you \who dunnit\ before you opened the book. The mystery of China has no one solution-it's up to the reader to find his own. So, instead of solving the puzzle for you, I'll share some of my stories that, I know, will prevent anyone from putting this book down. As the _train pulled out of the Shanghai station, I still didn't feel as .if I were in China. Yes, every person within a sone hundred mile radius had straight black hair and dark, slanted eyes; and, yes, they seemed to stare at my blue eyes for what seemed to be an eternity. Still, I was not con- vinced. After an hour or so on the train, the attendant pulled the rickety cart through the aisle saying ever so quickly, \Ni yao bu yao cha?\ (Would you like some tea??) I thought # to myself, \Hey wait a minute, does she really think I un· derstand what she's .saying?\ I caught myself smUing as -I began to see what a fascinating adventure this was goin~ to be. r pressed my face agamst the glass and tried to take it all in- acres upon acres of rice fields with a single six:-inch bike path zigzagging as far as my eyes could see. I feltlike I was riding right through the pages of a National Georgraphic magazine. · The train pulled into Nanjing, my home for the next three months. I use the word 'home' for a specific purpose: to describe what I felt, and still feel, towards this ever so distant co11ntry. Rather than to describe . what I saw with my own eyes, I will try to paint a picture of what I saw in theirs. For a person who has never been. to China, it U; extremely difficult to imagine whY. the Chinese are such a J?UZ2:ling people• To \see\ China IS not to ride around in an air .. conditioned bus when it is ninety-five degrees outside and there is a young boy pulling a two-hundred pound cart of bricks right outside the win- dow ... It is nD1 staying in a Western style hotel where one has all the comforts of home at his fingertips, when the people have to use ration coupons to buy their food and are not permitted to own a private car.

All three agree that their return trip was anything but commonplace; and when asked to recount the experiences of their two week journey along the Khatmandu- Lhasa Crossing (the one main road from Tibet to Nepal), the tale sounded somethmg like another episode of \Raiders\. The American in China At the outset of their journey, the three spent a short time in Lhasa, the capital of Tibet, and from there they continued on in a rented land rover. On the way, as the jeep went crashing through rivers and winding around shaky mountain roads. They had a chance to get a closer look at the Tibetan people and their unique culture, as well as t() take in Tibet's beaUti:ful landscapes. Matt, James, and Lawrence were impressed with the friendlmess of the Tibetan pe()ple, and were fascinated with the Bhuddist practices. All three admit that of all that they saw, it is most difficult to express the beauty of the Tibetan landscape. The departure from Tibet required a nine k:Uometer trek through \No Man's Land\ across the \Friendship Bridge\ into Nepal. One highlight of the trip was a bus ride into the jungles of Khatmandu where an anxious bus driver took off while the three were still on top of the bus loading their bags! James says of the experience, \lt was great riding up there\ and Matt agrees, \Es~cially when the rain stopped! It really was beautiful when the SWl came out.\ By SUZANNE LACHELLIER Traveling around other countries, I have found it in- teresting to discover what people think of my country, of me as an American and to observe my own reaction to new people and th~ir c!Jlture. With the canyon that exists between our culture and. China's, it was of special interest to observe \the American in China\ through myself. Two incidents which occurred during my stay . in China were very revealing of my attitude towards the Chinese and theirs towards the U.S. I was particularly sur- prised to lind my reaction so often negative and their view of the States so naive. I had the opportunity of hearing their views when visiting a Chinese family around the third week of the term. A conversation developed over dinner and it became evident that the two older men present were tryi.ilg to send their younger brother to he States 14 to stuc;ly\. They wanted help. Could I give them the name of a professor who Wlluld sponsor him to go over and help with laboratory research? Perhaps at another university? I repeatedly tried to explain that tbis coUld n<Jt be done. It is not so easy to get job$ in the U.S., I c~uld not impose upon a professor by asking, he would have no ·place to stay... The reaction surprised: \But America is the land of imo migrants, of oppc>rtunity; why don't they make it easier ·for us to enter?... We have to get visas. They should welcome us ... no jobs~ I thought America had too many jobs!\ I was baffled that someone could expect so much of the U.S. I have met with admiration, jealousy, hatred even, for the States, but never such ex- pectations. I was irritated by their view of the States as a cushion for them, should they not be satisfied in their own country, a place that should give them a job, a home ... I had never met with someone who placed such demands on my C()Untry. The Statue says: \Give me · your poor, your tired ... n perhaps we asked for it. I felt quite defensive by the end of dinner. Why should the . U.S. be expected to open her doors wide when they have only cracked theirs open and reserve the right to shut them at any time? I soon ~covered though, that my expectations of the Chinese were as Wtrealistic as I found their demands to be. I must set the scene for this next incident in order to explain the extent of my frustration. The Chinese tend to push, shove, and elbow anyone who is an obstacle to their entering the bus. Old men, children, women with babies- no one is spared the scramble into the bus. It was on a bus that this next episode occurred. · I got on the bus and a student pushed by me to get the seat ahead of me. I ·smiled to myself and sighed -patiently. Suddenly, an .older woman stood up and offered me her seat, She wore a pin which identified her as a . teacher. She had seen my reaction and guessed what I was thinking before I even realized how contemptuous I had been. Seeing a teacher offer me her seat and instinctively obeying the C<Jnfucian respect for the educated which is em- bedded in an Chinese, the student quickly rose and offered me her place instead. The whole fuss was finally settled when we managed to squeeze everyone. in the back seat of the bus. Embarrassed by my attitude, I thanked the teacher. I felt as though she could read thmugh me and was pained by my view of her people- I was troubled by my narrowmindedness. I ex- pected the Chinese to live up to the sterotype of the quiet, af- fable Asians and they weren't; because they didn't act as I wanted them to, I dismissed them as S()mewhat less civilized. It took this small altercation on a bus. to make me see the mistake· I was· making. This point was the source of much of my frustration in dealing with the Chinese. I was expectbig from them, rather than ac- cepting them as they are. This may seem to be a foolish mistake, but the Chinese culture is \so foreign and dif· ferent from ours that I daresay it is a mistake easily made. One CiUUlOt expect them to have the same values and etiquette we have in the West One must learn to see the world through. their frame of reference in order to Wtderstand these truly different people. UnitedStates.ln short, to \see\ China is to become a part of China. · To become :a part of China is not .as easy as . it sounds. Foreigners are still a mystery to many Chinese pe<>ple. Throughoutmy stay ·in Nanjing, I often asked students what they th9ught of Americans. \Ricb \competitive \promiscuous\ were some of the more widely d t . H · \1 k \ use erms. · owever, uc y, \great and \free\ were also frequent responses. At least · every othet· week, a student would. ask me, \Do you have a car?\; \Are you rich?\; ''How many rooms do you have in your house?\ These questions seem ridiculous to one who has nevel' seen. china; but, truth- fully, I wasn't so shocked after I had been ex:posed to the daily living. For a Chinese person to buy at v. set may require up to two years of saving. To have a private car- is impossible uriless, of course, one .has connections with a high-ranking ca:ulre. A Chinese home, consisting of one room, serves as an eatingroom, a working room, a sleeping room, a bathroom, a kitcnen, and a social room-sometimes it must acc()mmodate up t<> six people. There is a Chinese saying \guo yi tian, .suan yi tian\ (get through the day and forget it). This feeling was more prominent· during the days of the cultural revolution, but not surprisingly, I heard it more tl!an once during my stay. I, no doubt, felt the people's depression very strongly. Their attitude is. 'Ullderstandable-they are bored; they forget each day as quickly as it .co~es,- 1 op,ce . read a- letter ·on the eqitonal · page of the English. newspaper from an ordinary Chinese student. She complained that she was sick and tired of going through the same routine day atter day atter day, that sne desired the social life that she heard about from the foreigners, that she wanted to direct her own life rather than having someone direct it for her. Her feeling is not an urt· common ()ne among the young people in China. Her feeling explains why the recent protests are becoming an almost daily event. Personally, I do hope that the protests are answered 11nd that the .peQple are given what they deserve- freedom. The Chinese culture has so mum to offer to the rest of the world. Isn't it time that it should be shared? My views are strong. My heart is broken a little bit more each time. when I think of that lady on the corner who Will be selling peanuts for the rest of her life. Btlt most of all, my mind has been rewarded and my desires to understand that mysterious country have not waned. **** WELCOME CHINESE ·sTUDENTS ~ TO UNION **** .. . ..-; .. ·;;~

! ., CONCORDIENSIS\ January21,1987 P~ge7 . A TERM IN CHINA Sketches On Li:fe in Union College By CHINESE EXCHANGE STUDENTS It may be a bit too hasty to lay out our impressions about a different and foreign culture· and people on the basis of one's two months' experienees. But our life in Vnion, though short and campus-bound, .really provokes an urge to share our impressions and enjoyment with our American friends. This is the major purpose of this article~ · From the very first night we stepped onto the Union ·groWldS, we predicted with delight that we had fallen into the hands of the nicest. people, who are warm, friendly, sincere and ready to give · help. We have been living . in an atmosphere full of friendship and good will · during these two months, full of pleasant and cherished memories. When we arrived at Albany Airport, after almost two days eXhausting air jour .. ney, allourfatique was gone the ·moment we were greeted cordially by Vice-president D'Andrea, Prof. Thomas,. Prof. Fazier, Prof., ReYnolds and other professors from Union. In the first week the college arranged several upperclass students to Show us aroun4 the campus and help us fit in with the campus. life. Our first Christmas in America added much flavor and excitement to our life during the winter break.:__decorating Christmas trees, singing Christmas carols, meeting people, talking, eating, playing-all of these display the concern and friendship of the. people wh() wanted to help us avoid \cabin fever\ and home- sickness. We -got so many invitations to dinner that we r~ally wished · we had bigger stomachs, and the consequence is terrific-all of us have gained weight. We have also learned a lot about American culture and customs, which will help us get ' over the culture shock .and facilitate our life and study here. At Union, what has impressed us most is the high efficiency of work, teachers' enthusiasm and tenacity on research and students' diligence at study. Teachers here usmilly teach several courses a term and meanwhile do a lot of research work. It is very common to see t-eachers work late in the night, and many of them just spend their holidays and weekends working in the office. To out great surprise we find our former views on American students are not borne out by our acquaintance with the Union students, who make the same efforts at .study as the students in our university, some working even harder. During review and examination period yol,t can hardly see any student in the dining hall Without books before him on the table. A.part from the heayy learning taSks, most students benefit from a work-and-study program by working several hours a week, and we believe their working experiences in the vacations is helpful to their future careers and life in the society too. We are also quite surprised at the great munber and. variety of student clubs, which not only provide sufficient en- tertainment but bring students' intelligence.J.!Iid ability into full play. ' Talking about American food. proves to .be an easier way to open a conversation. We are often asked by American friendS, \Do you like American food?\. To tell the truth, we really had some problems in the first week. 0~ $tomachs, so used to heated food, often ccbubbled\ to \protest against\ the flowing of cold drinks and foodt and confronted with 'li big variety of food we often did not know ·which was which and what to take. But it did not take us long to get accustomed to American food, and some foods have even won us over due to their high content of prCJtein, vitamins and other suostanees human beings need for a healthier body. We plan to learn one or two American recipes, with the intention of introducing some American food to our relatives and friends in China. Visiting New York City enabled us to .see the famous cosmopolitan City from a difm ferent angle. Skyscrapers, gorgeous malls, flyovers, and cars are symbolic of :n1odemity, but. on the other hand, bring some undesirable effects. Chinatown, · to our great amazement, bears. so much resemblance to Shanghai .that we immediately felt at home. But once we almost got lost in the labyrinth of subway stations, which seemed in• congruous with the rest of the' city: unclean platforms, gloomy-looking carriages and odious smells. The walls of the subway cars, covered with all kinds of scrawlings, ·matched very well the rwnbling so1llld the cars uttered. It was a great pity that we did not have enough time that day to pay our respects to the Stat1,1e of Liberty, but our regret was decreased at the sight of the numerous pictures of ·Lady Liberty in the State Museum in Albany, some extremely wen done. The State Musewn lives up to its r(lputation as a living education centre where ,people can learn a great deal about American histoey, development in American industry and the Am~rican people's Uf(l in earlier periods as well, In one section were exhibited early American vehicles, among which fire brigade wagons looked so splendid that . they attracted many visitors and also made them wonder about their actual purpose .. Several stat~es and pam~ings of modern art m the Empire State Plaza stirred our interest to a high point. We racked our brains trying to make out what theY meant 1 but to no avail. They seemed to be open to countless interpretations. We wish we were able to reach the correct one. · Now with the coming of the new semester 1 we are fully occupied with courses. But we will still keepup less systematic pursuit so as to learn more aboutthe US society. Before we end this article, we'd like to take this opportunity to express our hearty thanks to Union· College, to all of those who have given us much consideration and help, and may our friend· ship. grow along with the development of the exchange program in the New ¥ear and the years to come!

It squeezed through the gaps in my closed window, and under my heayy cotton quilts to berate me with words I don't understand. Then there is music which sounds hauntingly familiar, but the rhythmn, the harmonies, it's all wrong. And still, I don't know the words. The chill as my feet hit the bare concrete floor shakes me from my stupor and sends me toddling toward the bathroom. This grey morning the wall switch for the light is siiilply decorative, as is the bathtub. And the toilet. As I wash with water from my thermos bottle, I remind myself not to use the last flush of the morning. But in the disorienting darkness of the \ \bathroom\, I forget. And so begins another day in China. · ''Stranger in a Strange Land\ I missed the hot shower hours, so I'm doomed to wear yesterday's grime and coal dust Wltil I can trek to the shower building for evening hot water hours. So donning my rumpled \Mao-wear\, replete with neon longjohns and black cotton slippers, I trudge down the six flights and slip across the mud toward class. Seated at my hard wooden stool in the furniture warehouse-classroom, I wrap my fingers around a covered mug of tea in search of wannth and distraction. A sturdy old Chinese woman paces the aisles between our slant top desks. She speaks no English. Pointer in hand, she motions me to ~o to the blackboard where I can t for the life of me remember how to draw the characters I'd practiced several hundred times the night before. My American clasmates support one another as we go through the abnost comical paces of writing and :re-writing characters, of spitting out syllables we can't replicate or distinguish from one another. ByMATr HOPKINS \Strangers in a strange land\: is P\robably the most frequently used quote by the Union students who spent this past fall term in the Peoples Republic of China. For most people, a cursory knowledge of Chinese history and an average imagination is all one needs to envision how strange China and the Chinese seemed to us during our brief stay there. However, just a few days after entering the country, we realized that the Chinese were not nearly as strange to us as we were to ·.them. The phenomenon of exotic and strange cultures clearly is the result of limited experience. Likewise~ with · expe.rie11ce comes. a loss of cultural naivete. The Union students who went to China arrived with a slightly above average knowledge of life in China (provided by video ta~s,. selected and suggested readings as well as encoWiters with Chinese and ·Chinese American.s )_. Nevertheless, we were still overwhelmed upon arrival. I was surprised to see how the reactions to us of the Chinese we encountered were so greatly exagerated and com- pounded by _an almpst virtual lack of experience With any and all westerners. The aver11ge American, while having little real kno.wledge of life in China, can draw on other experiences abroad or at horne in the \melting pot\ that help c:on- vince· him how different people really can be and thus how different life in China could be. The average Chinese however, has no such experience. There are few books and movies tbat accurately depict life in the West and even fewer op- . portuilities to travel ~broad.. This creates a situation where for the most part only the in .. tellectual elite are prepared to cope with foreigners. The resUlts of this are inqeed biz.. zare. Unabashed stares are the most common exampie and are at first very unnerving. Chinese cities are crowded places and having everyone within twenty feet stare at you is hard to get used to. This places something · of a burden on foreigners to avoid excedingly distractive clothing or actions which can easily result in bicycle ac- cidents and pedestrian mishaps caused by total absorbtion in some crazy foreigner. Wbile I have been to other countries where my hair (red), skin (pale), height (6 ft. 3) and nationality have attracted stares, I fo~d those that I received in China to . be quite Wlique. In these other situations any show of discomfort in- variably ledto a kind of backing off, as if my audiences were saying \Oh look, he's em .. harassed, the show is over.\ Never did this happen in China. My embarassment O(lly led to bigger and bolder crowds. It was as if people lacked even enough experience to believe that I was human, after all I didn't have black hair and I was far too tal,l and pale. I believe that very few Chinese wouJd be so naive as to openly deny my 'membership to the human race, but the Chinese have traditionally seen them selfs as the first race under heaven, an the rest of us are . . . well, not J Chinese. This lack of experience constantly manifested its self when we bro.ught out our cameras. As we tried in vain to capture every day Chinese life on film, we were constantly, yet thoughtfully being advised not to waste film on the \ordinary\. We soon learned not to waste our breath explaining that their \ordinary\ was very different from our \ordinary\, and that that is what the folks back home would want to see. They would simply smile and say \Of course, of course\ only to begin offering the same advice five minutes later; They simply did not have enough experience to really believe and understand the reality of our oh so different lives .and backgrounds. This phenomenon of Chinese being tourists in their home town is quickly becoming a thing of the past. Like people of any country, the Chinese learn very quickly. With every Chinese that goes abroad and every westerner that travels to China, the Chinese develop a greater and greater un- :,derstanding of the world and the peoples around them. The 11 students that travelled to China are very grateful to our hosts at Nanjing Normal University and to Union college for making it possible for us to see and be a part of these changes. After nearly three hours of tedious repetitio.1, our group of twelve goes to the foreigners cafeteria for lunch. Our table, which was assigned to us and is separate from the other foreign students', is covered with saucers full of grass clippings. So it's another instant-noodles- in-my-room kind of day. My intestinal instincts tell me to resist buying a steamed dumpling on the street putside the school gates. But the sweet potatoes baked in barrels full of coals are always safe and Continued on page 8 Need Money?

My, my, Hey, Hey.\ By MAGGIE BOrr~o If you have a genuine interest in the options available on the job market for psychology inajors with career objectives or you juSt enjoy hearing fir· sthand accounts about how others have arrived at their current employment situations, February 4th is definitely a date to put aside. Students from both the Psychology Club and members of Psi Chi have worked hard at organizing Union's very .first \Psychology Career Day.\ Beware-don't let the title fool you! This is not an event just put on for Psychology majors, rather, all - are welcome and indeed all who participate are bound to be~efit from the ex- perience. Representatives from a wide range of psychology related fields will come to Union to share their knowledge. Some of the occupations to be discussed Include matketing and com- munications, special education, employee relations, con- sultants, psychotherapists, hospital administrators, and even a lawyer is scheduled to attend. All representatives were involved at the un- dergraduate level in psychology. The diversity of jobs they managed to obtain is testimony to the successful applications, aside. fro;n traditional occupatiOns m clinical psychology, . to which the field is currently turning. In fact, uA lot of the people who are coming to talk about what they do are ex-Union psychology majors,\ stated Professor Markiewicz. \They are from a variety of fields and are coming not only to share their experiences but als9 to provide guidance to students on how to get where theS' are now.'' Daniel. F. Bush from the Psychology Department at Villanova University will be the keynote speaker. His lecture, concerning Physician-Patient Communication, is a hot topic in psychology today. . All throughout the day var1ous other speakers will lecture informally on what they do on the job and then the floor will be opened to questions. In such a relaxed atmosphere, students should have the opportunity to ask the questions they n-eed to know in order to get into the fields of their choice. Students instrumental in the organization of thi$ entirely student run activity include members of Psi Chi, . par- t;lcularly vi~resldent Dawn Chupey, and the Psychology Cluti especlaBy Prealclent Dan Gordon. ''Tbe repreaentatlves to come are from fields of in- terest partieular to the students,\ stated Dawn. \Hopefully pnce initiated successfully this .first year it Will become an cngoing event of which students will anticipate annually.\ Peter Trolio, Assistant Dire«or of the Career Development Center, also feels that, ''The most important aspect about this activity, · although geared toward students with a background in psychology, eCincems the fact that there will be a wide range of careers !!Overed enablmg students from any background to benefit fmm stopping by.\ The slogan Clf this promising event, \Weloome to the Rat Race\ reveals the more in· novative manner in which students .are encouraged to participate.

FortWlately, he is in a position to. do somethin~ ~bout hiS clirios1ty. By combmmg a tape of North and South, Book ODe, with the NBC Nightly News, he bas uncovered plots which the special investigating committees probably never will. The following is the nation's rnost engrossing · miniseries since. The Thorn :Birds, North and P•indexter, Book One. The story begins m the·Ovai Office on July 6 1 1985. \Merry Christmas, · Mr. Pl'esident,\ shouted Reagan's closest .friends ·and advisors. . ·~~ Aw, · gee, ·guys, ';f01l ·really shouldn't have,\ sa1d Reagan. \Nonsense Ron.

'\Well Ollie, it's been a · tradition with Reagan for the· last twenty-five years. Ever since he turned sixty, he's been worried every s~er that he won't live to see another Christmas. By. celebrating it now, he figUres that h~ wan't · miss it if he dies between now and December 25,\ said Admiral John. Poinc:lexter. Just then, famed con- servative philanthropist H.

Despite this low profile, the Union College Fencing Club has been extremely successful in its endeavors. In fact, the club's men's foirteam has never been defeated since its revitalization by the current president in 1985. Most recently, at a tour- nament held at RPI in which eight fencing teams including University of Massachusetts, University of Connecticut, and SUNY New Paltz participated, Union's men's foil team managed to remain undefeated as they took first place in the team foil competition. Much of the credit for this victory and the way the club has been performing must be given to the club's president Dan Choi. His record of 6-1 at the RPI meet helped push Union over the top for the impressive win. other major contributors at the R{>I meet were Charles-Olivier Boch and Andrew Fraser who shre the majority of the coaching in this club. In addition,· at the United States Fencing Association Tournament held at Vassar College in October, individual fencers from Union fought relentlessly against many of the best fencers in the region. Frank Schricker of Union placed second overall in the men's sabre competition, while Dan Choi advanced to the semi- final round in the men's foil competition. As a result of Dan Choi's outstanding record at these competitions. he was selected to join a Capital District \all-star\ team that would travel to Canada's Carleton University in Ottowa on November 7-9. There, Dan . represen.ted Union well by winning 11 out of 12 bouts he fenced. other members of the club with strong showings in recent competitions include Ken Orosz, David Lewis and Stefan Einarson. One interesting thing is how fast beginners in this fencing club progress. A\Qout 80 ~rcent of the club members . started here, and despite its physical and mental demands which include formulating tactics within one twentieth of a second, the club's novices develop quickly as they become a crucial part of the team's continuing .success. At a l.\ecent novice tournament, Sampson Lee who has been fencing for less than a year took third, while Andres Marein-Efron and Mike Millett took twelfth and thirteenth respectively in a pool of 20 fencers. Although the coaching is done only by the club members, the novices here develop much faster than other area clubs with legitimate coaches. The new fencers, Judi Philipson, Wiljon Beltre,. Barbara Pond, and Eric Frish- man, along with tne ex- perienced non-senior members of the team makes the future of the Union College Fencing Club look extremely pro~sing. If you would like to take a \stab\ at this exciting sport, contact Dan Choi at 370-6953, or Andrew Fraser at 386-4235.

This syndrome, chronic Epstein-Barr virus, results in a disabling fatigue in which the victim is prone to chronic infections. It is often confused with other illnesses such as flu, pituitary tumors, thyroid disorders, low blood sugar, premenstrual syndrome, and multiple sclerosis. effects. This past October, a team at the ·National Cancer Institute announced th,at they had· isolated a new herpes virus, HBLV, that destroyed the ·body's infectlon.:fighting B cells.

In Oregon, some patients ex- perience balance problems which restrict them to a wheel chair. Many of the victims feel better for a few weeks only to relapse. By STEVE KONLIAN The development of a new laser marks the beginning of a bright future in the treatment of millions of people threatened with blindness from glaucoma. The m.ost interesting aspect of this new laser is n~ in its 'ef- fectiveness' but rather in its size. The entire battery· operated system is the size of a suitcase and can be carried to remote areas to treat a tupe of glaucoma that afflicts millions of people in Asia, Africa, the Middle East, and Latin America~primarily · under-de· veloped nations. The laser was developed by Dr. A. L. Robin at the Johns Hopkins University Hospital. He conducted field tests on the laser last year. The system is designed so that parapro-fessionals can be trained ·tel quickly diagnose the conditi<ln and treat it 'With the laser. Glaucoma is marked by in- creased pressure within the eyeban that can damage the optic dis]( and optic nerve and cause bliradness. Glaucoma is usually treated by using larger, more expensive lasers in hospitals. Dr. Robin's system, developed' by Coherent Inc. of Palo Alto, costs $3fi;OOO and treats glaucoma by usl:ng laser beams to bore tilly holes tm:ough the colored part of the eye, relieving pressur.e. caused by a build-up of fluid behind the pupil. The procedure, ealled an irodotomy 7 was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration last November for the treatment of angle- closure glaucoma, which is more common in the Third World than in Western nations.

During the final week of last tenn, the College released a set of phone rates that outraged students. The administration reasoned that since we were paying for both data and phone service, students should be pleased at the bargain they were receiving. The Telecommunications System features separate lines for phone service and computer link~ups .. However, the vast majority of students simply aren't using the data line, and weren't pleased for paying an announced amount of money for a system they didn't use. The result was a petition to determine exactly what we were paying for and to change that if it did not reflect actual student use. The College has drawn an analogy between the newly installed phone system and the other facilities such as the pool and the athletic fields. rhe comparison is - a false analogy. It is nearly impossible to determine which few students do not use those facilities; they are enjoyed by nearly all at some point. Few students are actually using the data links to the main computer. The College's next excuse is that it won't determine the separate cost of the data line and the number of students using it. That, too, is untrue. According to the Director of Computer Services, all the data facilities and equipment are separate from the phone, or voice, equipment. A separate cost, and therefore separate data line rates, can be determined. Our neighboring school, RPI, already charges separately for the data line use. The final excuse, so often heard from Vice President Hauser, is that such a charge would be \cost-prohibitive.; \ that is, no student could afford to use it and it would discourage use. The charge at RPI is $17 monthly. Such a charge would be comparable to a course's equipment, material, or lab fee. The charge may even be substantially less here, and in any case, the College could help defray the cost. If the administration will determine and release this figure, as it easily could, we could see how much we're paying for using-or not using-. the data lines.

Instead of directing these unexpected funds back into the endowment of the general budget, they could be wisely spent on improving the current educational and social climate at the College. Although it is important to maintain the goals of the future, the College cannot afford to continue to neglect the here and now.

Having local data storage and printers, Microcomputers offer the student more control over their computing environment. And Personal Computers can be tied directly into the VAX via the · school-provided hardware link and commWlications software, if necessary. G~;mp~\i&gt}J.Mitovs Spnrts Editor ·. · · · · Assoc.

Page 13 LETTERS:. ·COMMENTARIES Journalistic Pr·actice Questioned To the Editor: ~egrettably, your January 15 lead st,ory Qn tile new general .educatton plan approved by the facUlty depart$. in various ways from tbe canons of respansible journalism. · ~t is improper to quote me in such a manner as to suggest- contrary to facto•that your reporter had solicited my views, and irresponsible to print Professor Gado 1 s absurd assessment of my motives for entering the curriculwn debate without even a \Professor Jonas could not be reached for comment;'' .In fact, of course, I could~and. should-have been reached, in which case it might -~ have been possible to Identify: me correctly. Professors Sorwn and Zwicker can surely speak for the:mselv:es, · but responsible journalistic prac.ti.c~ would have required solic1tmg their .responses to Profes$0r Gada's charges as well. Manfred Jona.'l Curriculum, Administration Wallowing in Mediocrity To the Editor: It is understood by all that a serious reform .of the present curriculum iS needed, .and yet in the search for a new ·educational plan, what has been passed by a sixty percent majority ()f the faculty 'and rubber stamped bythe A.A. C. is a plan whOse coherence resides in tb.e tunnel visioned approach to education of its supporters. If ooe were to liSten to Professor Jonas' assertion of over-. whelming. evidence that there could be \nothing better-indeed nothing · at · all\ that would emerge from further con- sideration ·of curriculum reform, it would he reasonable to assume that this plan characterizes the apex of modern educationaf thou~ht. To the contrary, the fact IS that many of its supporters appear to waffle on whether it is ·the proper course to pursue, ana even Jonas, who seems to be the most vocal supporter of the proposal, has described it as a \stab at coherence.\ What is befuddling is how a faculty could vote on a proposal so vaguely barren of any specifics. It has not been shown whether or not the propOsed tracks of courses can be taught by the present faculty, nor )las it . been shown that merely hiripg twelve additional faculty. is the proper solution. Under our present syst-em that has developed over tirne, the faculty has generally been unable to maintai11 acceptable office hours. While administrators insist otherwise, class sizes have nevertheless increased dramatically. The spectrum of courses once available have since been radically limited. In a world of. ever increasing knowledge, how is it th~t topics · of reeo,gnized value and interest hav.e been eliminated? Where .is it .proven in thiS new plan that these issues, whose ignored demise has characterized the diminished value of a Union educ~tion, · w-ill be resc11Scltated? Becau.$e of the ~School~ s inability to mana~e the needs,of our familiar cutncular plan, where should any of us find confidence in the weak• kneed insistence that this pl8I1, both ()n paper and in reality, will provide the necessary .ingredients Qf a liberal•arts education. . The plan characterizes what, in my :time at Union, has . ap- peared to be the Ad- ministration's fear of tran- scendingmedtocrity. It's easier to be mediocre, and certainly less ex:pensive. Thus, while our tuition rates increase at the same rate as comparable schools; which as last week's edit()rial .proved, are far more seleeti.vethan is Union, it really isn't surprising to find that the College .has consistently run a budget. surplus, this year ex- ceediD.g $2.3 million dollars. Where do ·other schools spend that money that we don't? Are they staffed more adequate}y th.an are we? Do they provide· w1der ranging courses? .Are their classes SIJJ,aller? Shouldn't we find out before settling ourselves into · the rut of mediocrity that the Ad- ministration iS familiar and comfortable with? Through all of this harangue over the curriculum, con· struction, budget s6rpluses 1 and eventhe latest outrage over the phone system, What appears to be the bottom line tragedy is the proven ineffectiveness of the Morris presidency. In managing the College, the President has gone .to great lengths in increasing Union's ·endowment.to a respectable and workable level, yet those wbo carry out policies in his name have done grievous damage to Union's potential. tn light of the recent revelations of President Reag~n's overtures to iran and the subsequent undermining of his credibility .to lead the nation, we can find parallel im- plications in President Morris' in!Jistence 011 ·retaining men in high positions of authority whose inability to inspire, and lead, has paralyZed the College. Trust in their judgment has all but vanished throughout . our community, and consequently, this mistrust has poisoned the College's ability to reach beyond what is simply ~ood to that which is the best Umon can be. It doesn't appear likely that anything .of substance will ever be attained so long as this vacuwn of leadership exists in the Morris .Administration. As students, we have an implicit responsibility to look to the futW'e needs of the College and of those who will follow in our footsteps. The decision to pl,ll'sue a new curriculwn must be a thoroughly researched one that embodies the best interests of a liberal arts education. Anything less is unacceptable. Let~s hope the A.A. C., including student representative Gavin Morton, exerciseS' its in- dependence and acts wisely. After all, that iS what it exists for, and in the familiar absence of administrative leadership as well as the absence of any real consensus among the faculty, its decision must be to reverse course, slow do\Vll, and take the time to truly evaluate the ef- ficacy of this general education proposal. Sincerely, Jason Green '87 SAT's · - _Do They Matter? To the Editor: Your editorial of January l5 was both silly ar;1d inap- propriate. So Union is not \the cream of the crop\ by virtue of its admiSsion's policy. Is that the real problem with this school? Does the fact that our students have lower avero.ge SAT scores differentiate us from the schools that made the list? Does the goal that you set of making thi~ list mean anything-should it? sCb()l)ls (both above and below us on the list) protest apartheid and have active groups representmg such 'extremes' as communists and homosexuals; Union remains stagnant in an atmosphere of apathy and conformity. In this way, Union students ignore real issues and facts of life such as the homos.e:mal community that Will affect us both now and in ow- future as members of soeiety'. Similarly, do Union students care that the ad- miniStration has adopted a wishy-washy policy towards South Africa? Or do they care instead about the more recent smoke detector scandal that seemed to attract equal in- terest? Tne fact that Union stmdents have comparatively low SAT scores to those 46 schools should not relegate us to a position of complacency. SAT's do not represent ina tellectual curiosity or tolerance of new. ideas, only our pen.KJnal conscience can bring that out. would be merely a group of \smart career minded men and women instead of the \dumb\ ones we now are. I can't say I would take any more pride in a Union full of homogeneous SAT whizzes than what we have now. What I would be proud of is a place where a college campus means something again. Where each student would feel free to act as they like and to say what they feel with the Administration's help and assistance. It is the great irony of this school that the more time we :;~pend here 'learning,' the more closed minded we become. The opo posite should happen; we should. experiment, challenge and participate. Union has, as you mention, positive points and I have ~njoyed most of my time here. Yet 1 do not share in your goal. My goal would be to see a change of attitude, not in composition, of the students. We don't have to raise standards to attain improvements, just consciousness. : PAUL.SCI.IOf .•. From the Albany Desk The Mayo_r Sp:ea;ks SChenectady ·is the largest city in New Yor:k State to have a woman mayor. For those un~ familiar with this city's politic$, her name is Karen Johnson. She has served as mayor since 1984, and she is the first Democrat to hold that office 'in over 25 years. This week, From the Albany Desk spoke with Mayor Johnson, who discussed Schenectady'$ future, and Union College's place in it. Q,) Are there any special plans to spur economic growth in Schenectady this year? f...) ~ere are many projects that will be ccming to fruition this year. One of these projects iS the former Two Guys store on Lafayette St. It i& currently being renovated, and it will house the .offices of MAO Design, a company that designs nuclear submarines under contract for GE. It is scheduled .for completion in August 1987. Also in that section of Schenectady, the Holiday Inn on Nott Terrace is ,currently un- dergoing a $4 million renovation. The Koala Inn, just across the street from the, Holiday Inn, has recently been purchased and it too is being renovated. When completed, the Koala Inn will house a new restaurant. Downtown, the Barney Square apartment house just opened. We have another major project planned for downtown: a 15-story office building with a 750 car ga!age. Jn order to begin construction, we must have at least four ·floors completely leased. So far, we have com· pletely leased two floors, and we are optbnistic about leasing two more soon. There have been a constant stream of improvements ·such as these. We have. given a new business across the street from the old Two Guys a loan. We are working to develop GE's Building 350, a 39,000 square foot building on the comer of Nott Street alld Erie Blvd. We are also working with some of the laid off GE workers, by helping them to establish businesses. Our toughest problem has been to help the unioniZed workers whose skills may be obsolete in today's marketplace. . We have aS;rong county-wide development. staff.

Since last June, we have been losin~ £Orne of these gains to th.e GE layoffs. Thoe community has been frustrated by these layoffs. The~e is nothing that we can do to stCJp them. There has been a more intense effort to diversify -Schenectady's ~conomy. We are currently training about 100 citize11 ombudsmen who will sell Scbemectady as a place to establish businesses to people both in this city and outside it.

. Page 14 CONCO!fDIENSJS, January 22, 1987 I Critics of England Take a Bath Bath Defended To the editor: This letter is in response to the article last weel: entitled ''Bathing.,. We would just like everyone to see a different and more positive view of Bath. First of all, we think. it is ~ portant to mention w. hat a beautiful city Bath is. It is an extremely historic eity dating back to the Roman times. The Romans discovered the hot springs of Bath and the curative properties of these ~Baths at- tracted people from all over. Bath developed int& a city of leisure. From the &man times to the present, Bath has played ait hnportant role m the history of England. It served as an aristocratic and social center in the 1800's. Today, Bath is filled with great .shopping, pubs, restaurants theatres, and numerous other means of en· tertainm~t. Bath is a great place for a term abroad not only because it is filled with activity, but because l.t is a suburb of London. It is only an hour and fifteen minutes by train to London, so taking day trips, spending weekends, and just going in for the night are no problem at all. We lived with the Woodgates, a family of four, iiNllarge house on a hill, but that is not unusual for Bath is filled with hills and we found that we had no choice but to buUd up the muscles in our legs. We found living with the Woodgates easy and comfortable. The two little girls in our family were very sweet with their British accents. We learned to love 4 o'Clock tea and wish that Amerlc&.s would take a break from the 9 te5routine to enjoy the finer sweets in life. Although the English don't. consider hot showers and heat ~important as we do, we found that being a bit chilled was a small price to pay for spending a tenn in England. . The University of Bath has &proximately 4,000 un- dergraduates who carry on as typical coDege students. In ord~r to make British buddies we had to make the effort. Once we: did this, we fomtd that there was a great social life at Bath. Besides having· a pub and. movies on campus, the various clubs and teams were con· stantly sponsoring parties at pubs and nightclubs· in town. The rugby social club sponsQred a boxer short and baby wear party. AU over town one would spot a 6 foot ol, 210 pound guy in a diaper sucking beer from a baby bottle. We found that, unUke the Am~ricans, the English aren't inhibited and will do anything for a good time. One of the greatest ad- vantages of living in Bath is that it was easy to visit all of the famous and historical places in England. We took day trips to visit friends at Oxford·, saw a Shakespeare play at Stratford u.pon Avon, sat on rocks at Stonehenge that dated back to 2000 B.C., visited the su.pposed burial sight of King Arthur, paid a visit to the different homes of the royal family, and so much more. On weekends, one could easily find themselves in Scotland, Ireland, Belgium, Amsterdam, France, the possibilities are endless. Where else would you be able to fly to Paris on Friday, find yourseU in Brussels on Sunday night, and atten.d a medieval banquet in Wales on Monday. We found that there were m~my differences .betweea the Americans and the British, ·and that madethe.experienc~ all the bet~er. British hll{llor is som.¢bing that one must .. get used. to. We must say that we fomd it quite intPQSSible to sit thro.1lgh. a comedy Sllch. ·as \Spittirag Images\ o! \F~ulty Towers\ 'Without gett.mg qwte a felV chuckles. As for the et\ijng ha~its in Britain, all we can say is :take an American and an Englisbm.an, pu.t them both on a scale:t and you Will find that the .American will probably weigh mC~re \stone\ than the El)gli$h· man·. Perhaps this is due to exeessive pizza binges and Mci>onalds ·runs rather than an Englishman's over buttering of bis bread. The British are quite a ci-vilized group of people and it was a pleasant surprise to find that people actually waited in queues (lines) and were more th8ll happy to help us when we needed directions. To the editor: I would like to submit this · opinion beCause I am very concerned with the· negative feelirlgs I had after reading last week's article on the term abroad to Bath, Engl&Qd• I believe that .it presented a · very unencouraging and negative view of Great Britain.

To the Editor: In the 15 January issue of Concordleosls we were treated to yet another Frank Gado front page. This time he is the victim of a vicious coup instigated by Bill Zwicker and Christie Sorum. Anyone who knows. these two also knows what a couple of dastardl~r, conniving schemers they are; who among us would stop short of calling them the arch-enemies of education? Are they part &f the faculty that Gado attacks for lacking vitality in general? The most impressive part of Union College is not the Nott Memorial, nor the plans for Carnegie, nor even the com· position of the student body; the singular most impressive thing that places Union above other schools is the dedication and intellectual quality of the faculty. Intellectual quality without dedication trickles down to the students in dribs and drabs of facts without making students enthusiastic; dedication without intellectual quality is virtually useless to students. In my three years here, I have found; through my own observations as well as through discussi&ns with other students, that an overwhelming majority of our f~culty is conscientious, intelligent, and accessible. Very few make a mockery of an acadeiJlic career by embracing politics and neglecting their real roles. I don't know Professor Jonas personally, bu.t Gado's allegation that Professor Jonas is trying to \~e the number of brownie points he can get\ is nothing more than malicious babble, in place of any substantive argument. What kind of person publicly slanders a coll~ague in this manner? Brownie points, I think, are irrelevant here, because Professor Jonas has been here as long as professor Gado; both are well past tenW'e; both have a relatively similar amount of security in their positions. So why the need to score \brownie points,\ as Gado so professionally puts it? I would be interested in learning Professor Gado's reaflons for not requiring students to take courses in literature or technology. He neglected to explain. tilis in his last public appearance. What kinds of courses, then, should students take? Are literature and technology both irrelevant to the world around us? I say they are not. Nor do they exist to punish students with a strict curriculwn; they exist in their separateness to form a wholistic view of the complex world around us. I would hope that a lot of students gain at least something beside& college credits from a wide variety of courses, whether it's a. .space tecllllol~gy class or a course on the metaphysical poets. To suggest that this is not so is pessimistic intellectual gar- bage. Furthermore, professor Gado calls the Preceptorial a \hoax\, claiming that it is a joke to expect people outside of the English department to be able to teach writing skills. I have news for you, Professor Gado: the ability to write does· not stop at your doorjamb. I had a Math professor for prec~ptorial-Bill Zwieker, in fact, Bill hap~ns to have a strong background in English. I suspect that most of the.pl'()fessors here bad to write d()doral dissertations-a great deal of writing, no matter what field a professor belongs to. By md. large, Ph.Ds aren't 'handed Ollt like lollipops in a doctor'S office; they are earned through years of diligence and obtained as a result of a meritorious pl-ece of thinking and writing. Y()u're right, Professor Gado: not every professor here is actually trained to teach writing; but many are able to te:acl:l it regardless of trainiJlg. If you hope to improve the P1eceptorial program; you sbnply h:ave to cull out those. wbo are not sufficient for the task. I have a feeling you won't hi!ve to dispense of as many as YCIU think ycu will. F'or all your talk of what's bEst for students, have ycu ever a.:tually sat down with a significant number of .students Uld discussed your ideas? Or is it merely convenient to make us btelie'Ve that you are figllting for o11r good, in order tc ri~ yourself .o:f yet another fact1on that might hoUnd you? Why don't y:ou ask some of us about the iss11es? What are you afraid of fin.dng? 'l'hat not all.ofus share rour zealous contentions? At any rate; there really is no rued for Professor Gado'S eonsistent mud~slinging at everyone in sight. Respect is something you. earn; colleagues ba'Ve to trust one another. Does a11yone on this faculty have: · aiHolute confidence that his or her 11ame will not appear in the next issue of Concordtewds with Frank Gado's defamatory remarks aU over it? Where there is no trust, respect cannot tie bad. ·~ Sincerely. JoyE. Runyon I ...... Social Committee is planning: - '.·' .:.. WINTERFEST '87 Febr:uary 13-15 - Valentine's Day Dinner ..

. Page 16 CONCORDIENSJS, Jannary 22, 1987 . ·' THE ... ARTS ~- . Romeo ~et Juliette at ProctQr' s By MARJORmBOFFER The Ballet de Rl:\ance' stopped for one night's pe:ftormance at Proctor's, Thtusclay night. The ballet versibn of Shake- speare's play, \Romeo and Juliet\; was dance:dto Berlioz's symphony as DpJ>Osed to the usual music of 'l~llaikovsky or Prokofiev. Openlng the per- formance th~ ·dancers presented a C()IIJrful scene where the two :families, the Montagues and .the Capulets, fight with one ;another. The beginning chorEography was criticized by my 11.eighbor to be a bit sloppy, how~ver, r thought it was rather exdlillg and bold. The scenes that followed were highlighted by tbe Mercutio's solo, danced by tile chic David Astie. Astie dan~ed with such strength and IJ(nre1·, that when the Queen Mal) dance was presented, it seemed boring in contrast. Gray · '\eredon with his vast background of in- ternational achievements, did an excellent job choreographing the ballet. For, though I found the pas de deux dl!ll, my neigh- bor thought it marvelous, and I knowing very little about ballet should trust her opinion. On the other hand, most scenes were lively and enjoyable. Juliet, looking like an anorexic victim escaped from the hospital was danced by Elisabeth Ameil. She did a splendid job, especially because she looked so meek and fraU and incapable of even walking on her toothp~ck legs, let alone dancing on them. Nonetheless, the Ballet de France's performance was very appealing~ Founded only two years ago, the company is an ensemble of forty exce~ional French dancers. On thell\ ten- week tour of the United States, · it is unfortunate· that the per- forman,ce at, fro~or'::~ was. a one ntght stand.

This also happens to be the single and video and to me; it is the blistering guitar solo by Nils Lofgren (Miami Steve's replacement) that is the centerpiece .here. lt seems through thiS song that Bruce is becoming more concerned with current events, especially U.S. involvement in Central America, which he views as a parallel to the Vietnam War and which make \War\ seem like a · Central America protest an· them. \Seeds\ is a new song, and one that was performed almost nightly on the last tour. It is the story of an oil field worker who lost his job due to the bust in the oil· industry and now he and his family have fallen on hard times. I~ is a song that could have been on \'Nebraska\, but with the full band behind him,. the emotional response in the listener is bound to be greater. It is trl,l]y one of the gems of this collection.

A vow not to sing it again, maybe? Who knows? I know, though, that it sorely miSsed. My final complaint is that not enough cover tunes and recorded, but unreleased material appear on it.

By MARJOlliEHOFI'Elt The ,ooet J~yne Cortet ,()pened the Winter Improvisatio11Series last ,Friday night to a slloeless audience. Accompanied by bass, drums and sa)(apb.one, Cortez read- her po.ems ill an interesting rhytlunic beat. The beginning of the perfc.rmance was actbally hindered. by the instrumental backgrourad which overpowered Cortez's voice. However, the combination of the voice and the instrliiJlental beat provided a unique and individual sound. Corte~ often varied the emphasis ·placed on certain words repeatedly wjthin the poems. The subject matter of the poetry demanc:led the strong sounds that the J»et and band were capable of delivering. At times it was hard to believe that such a well dressed person was delivering this poetry. For the imagery often became very cr11de and repulsive. The poems~ on the whole, reiterated the messages of a social critic. Defense· spending, nuclear waste and individual struggles seemed to be main · subject rnatter or metaphores offe.red in the poems. If appreciated solely for the unique fonn of prese11tation and sensation, Cortez .offers an experience ,for everyoJJe, Yet, her .following, I would imagine to be a liberal one in beliefs. Understandably renowned, Cortez lifts poetry to new heights. Regardless tlut some· may not enjoy such depressing subjects, she allows pe<>ple to feel the rhythm in poetry. This was a worthwhile ex:perience for everyone to·appreciate. The improvisation series began with a new sensation.

Remnants of this holocaastare sUil evident in the Soutn. An independent film· maker, Ross McElwee, who was odgin:ally from. the South, was so ob~essed with Shennan that he applied for and received a $9;000 grant to complete a movie aoout Sherman's march. McElwee began his project in 1981 lo<lking at the lingering effects: ·df Sherman's bloody \March. to the Sea\ dW'iilg the Civ.j:i War . on present day society.. When McElwee's girlfrierld left him, he was Q.evastated. Yet this calamity inspired him to redesign his docwnentary into a personal film wlrlch details his own journey in search of romantic love in the South. McElwee's travels through Savannah, Atlanta, Columbia and Charlotte become a personal calamity of his · failing relationsllips with women. Accompanied· by his camera in search for another woman, McElwEe met and had brief · interludes (not sexual) with a dizzy a<Jtress, an aspiring rock singer, a hermit-like linguist, a Mormon folk singer, a mature interior designer and a few old girlfriends, McElwee's tragedy of not finding a woman turns out to be a comedy that is hilariously funny. At one point in his travels, McElwee falls in love with a woman who with her husband lives on a deserted island. The relationship is ended when McElwee runs out of money and must go back to the mainland to make money to buy more film. When he returns to the island the woman has reunited with. her husband and McElwee is stuck sleeping by himself in a tree house. In a \home movie\ style, McElwee captures the idiosyricracies of •• I':-~·': I -~ An··~ . . Stach lor Love . these Southern women and everyone else he comes into contact with. In a Woody Allen style, McElwee's own character is both pitiful, yet ingenious. The movie, ·\Sherman's March,\ is taking Washington by storm. Premiering at Washington's Biograph Theater, its engagement has already been extended, It is not certain whether this smash comedy will make it to the theaters of Schenectady or even to Albany, but if it does, it should not be missed.

I bet all you sports ·fans out there thought that after the baseball .playoffs and World Series were over that you would finally get some studying done and come down from that two week high you had been on. .Think again. You probably thought that immediately after the World Series ended it was time to catch l1P on your favorite football team and begin to put all other things behind you, including studying on Sunday between 12:30 and 6:30. I know right now some. of you are saying, \I studied on Sund1:1y no matter who was playing.\ Well, I'm sure there are many of you who did study «Jn Sunday for the most part of the day, but can you seriously look yourself in the eye and say, \never once did I .get up when I heard people yelling, never once did I stop in to watch a game for J'ust two minutes which turne into about a 45.\ If you consider yourself a true sports fan, there is no way that you can say this to yourself. Now that the football seaS()n is almost and and once Get to Know Your Coach In Bill Scanlon's first 13 years as the head varsity basketball coach at Union College, the Dutchmen cage pro~am has produc~ an impresstve record of 189-128 for a winning per- centage of .596. In 13 seasons, Coach Scanlon has produced more victories than any other coach in Union's proud 88-year- old basketball history. Three times his teams have reached the 20.win .plateau (the only three 26-win seasons in the college's history),. and,his eight winning seasons is also tops among the 21 men who have been at the helm of Union's program. In each of his first 13 years, the Dutchmen have won 10 or more games. Overall, Union has produced 30 teams that have hit double figures in victories during tile course of a season. Twice during his career at Union, Coach Scanlon has been· named the New York State \Coach of the Year\ (in 1973-74, his rookie campaign and again in 1982-83). He has guided his team into the ECAC Tour- nament five times (winning the title in 1974-75 ), and his squad of 1982-83 became the first Union basketball team to be selected to the prestigious NCAA Tournament. Union basketball has not had a losing season · for the last seven years. But,, despite the fact that the Dutclunen lost its two big men from the 16-11 ECAC Tournament team of 198485 (Kevin Bartlett and Ken D'Orazio), the 12-i2 finish by last season's squad was a bit of a disappointment. The Dut- chmen went into the last two games of the season needing a win in order to qualify for their secondastraight trip to the ECAC event. However, the team lost to Binghamton (70-67 at home) and LeMoyne ( 80-68 on the road) thus ending the hopes for the tourney bid. The Dutchmen's inability to win on the road again haunted the team in '85-86. Union, which 14•23 away from Memorial CONCORDI~NSIS, January 22, 1987 :NOllN THE BOX SCORE Mark Zimmerman ).'()U are looking forward to studying, thiillt ahead ohvhat is to come. After the Giants win the Super Bowl you will begin to . watch a few .gasketball and h()ckey games. Although the late winter months at\e ad· nlittedly a bit slower in the sports world, 110 sports fall can overlook the 'Stanley C11p,. the NBA finals or the NCM final four which as of now,· Union basketball, with its impressive l\ecord is making a rllD for. Well, it seems that even after these championship games are over everything just starts over again with spring training and the sort Right now, manr of you al\e probably thinkmg to )l()urself how this sceJtario I have described is your amtobiography and it ID<!Y be. Following sports is a year long eadeavor which is well worth the while. So, when it's the middle of February a!ld you have a huge Calculus test the next day, but you jiiBt ~an't seem to pull yo11rself away from the NBA game .. of the week, d()n't 're not alDne; Field House the last three years, ha8ll't had a seaoon in which the read reCC>rd was above .500 since the 7-3 mark established during the 1932-a:l campaign. It was that year that the Dutchemn were invited to their first-ever NCAA Tour- nament and set the school record for wins in a season with its 21·5 mark. \I think tile so-called road jj:nx has beeome m()re of a mental block for tiS, \ said Scanlon. \'l'his year we have to win a couple of early road games in order to get the idea that we can't win on thE) road out of our heads.\ Aside from the pr()blerns on the road, Scanlon is very op- timistic about the 11pcoming year. Of the ,dozen losses, eight were by eight pvints or less and two were in overtime. A 1962- graduate of Shenen- dehowa High School in 11earby Clifton Park, and a 1966 graduate of Springfield Conege, Coach Scanlon played three y-ears of vusity ba!lketball while at Springfield and was also on the freslunan h()op and fresllman soccer squads. He began his coachillg career at Holyoke Community CCllege ln 1968 and posted a two-year record of 24-13. Coach Scanlon was the Union freshmBll coach from 1970 .until 197? where he .posted a 39-10 recoru.

However, the team lost to Binghamton (70-67 at home) and LeMoyne (80-68 on the road) thus ending the hopes for the tourney bid.

Well, it seems that even after these championsllip games are over everything just starts over again with spring training and the sort Right now, many of you are probably thinking to yourself how this scenario I have described is your autobiography and it may be. Following sports is a year long endeavor which is well worth the while. So, when it's the middle of February and you have a huge Calculus test the next day, but you just can't seem to pull yourself away from the NBA game of the week, don't fret, 're not alone. Field House the last three years, hasn't had a season in which the road record was above .500 since the 7-3 mark established during the 1982-83 campaign. It was tbat year that the Dutchemn were invited to their first-ever NCAA Tour- nament and set the school record for wins in a season with its 21·5 mark. \I think the so-called road jinx has become more of a mental block for us,\ said Scanlon. \This yEar we have to win a couple of early road games in order to get the idea that we can't win on the road out of olll' heads.\ Aside from the problems on the road, Scanlon is very op- timistic about the upcoming year. Of the dozen losses, eight were by eight points or less and two were in overtime. A 1962 graduate of Shenen- dehowa High School in nearby Clifton Park, and a 1966 graduate of Springfield College, Coach Scanlon played three years of varsity basketball while at Springfield and was also on the freshman hoop and freshman soccer squads. He began his coaching career at H()lyoke Community College in 1968 and posted a two-year record of 24-13. Coach Scanlon was the Union freshman coach from 1970 until 197? where he posted a 39-10 recoru.

The case in point, and this week's column topic, is· the sudden interest by the NCAA in a college football national championship game. Well, what a surprise? After the success ofthe Fiesta Bowl in which Penn State beat Miami for the National Championship, that august body has decided to re-evaluate their position on deClaring a national champion. This surely comes as a shock. The Fiesta Bowl featured two unbeaten teams to detennine the National Championship, on a Friday night, and carried a nation-wide Nielson rating of 15.1, a windfall for the NCAA and their problems with dwindling television revenue. The NCAA claims they are merely responding to public interest in regards to changing the bowl picture. The problem is the public interest is not such a groundswell of enthusiaSih for a playoff system. But rublic sentiment aside, the rea · issue comes down to ratings.

If the' NCAA does come through with a championship game, it rarely will find all the pieces to the puzzle of national rating success in place as they were for the '87 Fiesta bowl. There are numerous other barriers to a successful champbnship game. The major television networks will resist competitive bidding, as it did wit~ a college basketball package. Also, the networks would not act unless they could be assured it would not downgrade the vaiue of existing bowl ,contracts which in- cidentally run to the year 1995. Television aside, there is another logical reason not to implement a championship game: it is unnecessary. Who needs it, beside NCAA coffers? In five of the last six years, the championship has been decided on the basis of existing bowls, the only exception coming in 1982 when a national champion was decided by a unanimous vote of the two wire services. So why push for a title game? I'd be willing to wager money andpower'have something to do with it. There is large support for the new system from in- dependent schools-who envision large TV profits which they get to keep themselves, unlike conference schools. But the major effort comes from the governing board of the NCAA. If the NCAA can establish and direct a championship series, it can take a small portion of TV revenues off the top for its own operation and dictate which schools participate and receive the I'est of the money. That is a display ofpower 1 and that is one man's opinion. .C:...·

In five of the last six years, the championship has been decided on the basis of existing bowls, the only exception coming in 1982 when a national c}Jampion was decided by a unanimous vote of the two wire services. So why push for a title game? I'd be willing to wager money and power have something to do with it. There is large support for the new system from in- dependent schools who envision large TV profits which they get to keep themselves, unlike conference schools. But the major effort comes from the governing board of the NCAA. If the NCAA can establish and direct a championship series, it can take a small portion of TV revenues off the top for its own operation and dictate which schools participate and receive the rest of the money. That is a display of power, and that is one man's opinion. --

~- Skating Dutchmen Needed ~in Over l\ljd~le~ury ~ January 22, 1987 Dutchmen Run Record to 7-4 Ski Team~ Captures 3rd'PiaceTrophy,Outof 20 By MARK VANBUREN During the past week the Union College men's basketball team was involved in two surprising games. A week ago Tuesday,. the Dutchmen traveled into the depths of Vermont to take on Middlebury College. The nemesis of the Dutcbmen (the road game) was again a factor as they were beaten rather handily, 84-61. The game, on paper anyway, appeared to be anything but one of the more challenging games of the seaSQn ·for Union. The Panthers, while not ~ bad team, just didn't match up well to the Dutcbmen, either talent-wise or height-wise. The game started off very slowly, with both teams showing signs of sloppiness. Union grabbed a three-point lead, 11-8, when Neil Winawer canned two free throws just three and a half minutes into the game. The Panthers charged right back and scored 11 of the game's next 19 points·to knot the score at 19 when Pat Tarpey connected on a 3~point field goal with 10:28 showing on the clock. On their next two possessions, Middlebury upped their margin to 24-19, due in part to two un· timely Union turnovers. Torn Beck then capped off a 7-2 Dutchmen spurt with a 3-point basket to again tie the game 26· 26 with 4:21 left in the opening period. The next five. Un~on possessions resulted m. five missed shots and enabled Middlebury to go ahead 31-26 at the 2:34 mark. A Neil Winawer offensive rebound basket, along with a three-point play by the aforementioned Dutchman, once again brought the teams even, 31-31, with just 1:57 left before intermission. Fifty-four seconds later the teams were deadlocked once more at 33. When the Panthers' J.T .. Thompson scored on an of·. fensive ti~in, three. seconds before the half ended, 1t enabled Middlebury to lead 35-33 as the teams entered ihe lockerrooms. Althollgh Union had remained close 011 the scoreboard, one could sense they were not reany in the game. This feeling became even n1ore evident as the secCJnd half began. With just over four minutes having been played9 Middlebury had i& creased. its lead to eight points, 49-41; and with 13:00 showing on the clock, they led 56-41. Neil Winawer's three-point play, four minutes later closed the Union deficit to 66-50. Tom Beck's 19·f()oter closed the margin to eight points, 60-52, with 6:16 remaining in the contest. However, less than three minutes later, Middlebury had upped its lead to 7o.fi6. At this point~ the Dutchmen were .forced to f()ul their opponents, who converted 12 of 17 free throws in thefinal3: SO to ice the victory. Neil Winawer paced Union with 25 points and 9 reboWlds, while Tom Beck and Kurt Fox acldecl15 and 12 points respectively. The Dutchmen rebounded from that loss to come back and snap a .-game St. Lawrence winning streak on Saturday, 89- 78. Tom Beck's lay~up !{ave Union a 19-Ulead at the 16:16 mark of the initial half, capped a scoring spurt that saw the Dutchmen take a lead that they would not relinguish for the rest of the game. Union held its largest lead of the period, 33-19, after Kurt F()x made good on a fast-break lay-up with 9:20 to play bef.ore halftime. Neal Genaway's free throw three minutes later cut the St. Lawrence deficit to eleven points, 38-27, but that is as close as they would get the rest of the half. From here, Union out- scored the Saints 14-12, to take a 52-39 lead at the intermission. This advalltage was quickly extended in the opening minutes of the second hall to 63-45 with Joe Romel.\'s 15-foot jumper.

The men's and women's teams captured third and fifth place finishes respectively at the Syracuse Invitational Meet held at Mount Toggenburg in Tully, N.Y. The third place finish by the men brought home a team trophy for the first time in quite a few years. Chris Hurcomb '88 and Mark Haughton '89 led the men's team in both the slalom and giant slalom competitions. Chris had an excellent Invitational finishing fourth, one place away from an irl- dividual medal, in the slalom and fifth in the giant slalom.

Chaos By R. REED WHIDDEN Students have often had serious problems with course legislation, signing up fer classes only to later find them closed. The political science and economics departments have a solution to this problem. It is impossible to give everyone their ideal schedule, but these two departments have developed a system that helps to reach that goal. Each course they offer is a card course. This means that for every course offered by these departments a student must sign up for it and pick up a card once that student has been placed into that course. They first ask students wanting to take a course in political science or econom.ics to fill out a form that tells which they would like to take and put them in ranked order from most preferred to least preferred. With these forms the depart- ments can keep a record on students who sign up for courses. When they must decide who will be let into a course they can go to these forms and see who wanted what first. What also helps them to decide who will be let in is the student's major and the class year of the student. For example, if a course has a limit on it (that is the number of students allowed to take the course) of, say, 20, and 30 people sign up for it, the department heads will look to see who is most qualified by those criteria. An'Jther aspect the forms are good for is reference. If the department is forced to give a student a choice which is not his first, the department can go back and take this into con- sideration when that student asks for his first choice again. If the student cannot get that course the first time perhaps he can get it for the next term. However, students usually get their second choice, if not their first. This system does have its drawbacks, though. It creates . a lot of extra work for the department heads. There is a lot of paper. work involyed in pre-registration, and this pre- pre-registration makes even more. Secondly, if a student does sign up for a course, and he · gets his card, that student must return the card if he decides not to take that course. However, many students do not do this. Those who do not do this make it harder for those who are on a waiting list for that course. If there are students on a waiting list and the class is not full, because the card has not been returned, the students on the list will not get in. Otherwise, this Continued on page 2 I £ .E (/) C!l 8 ~ (!) a: £ 0 0 _c Q_ Julie Mountain and Mark Webster. student trustees, report on the trustees meeting_ Trustees Approve Increases In Tuition, Finattcial Aid Effect of Student Loans Undetermined ByL()RILEON The Board of Trustees ap- proved an overall 7.35 per- centage increase in tuition, room and board charges for 1987-88 at their meeting last Wednesday in Manhattan. A 7.8 percentage increase for the College's Student Financial Aid budget was also passed at that time. The dollar increase in financial aid provisions is $388,000 to complete the $4.6 million proposed aid budget. The Trustees' report states \It is expected this increased aid will keep us competitive. The financial aid package offered is an important factor in the student's decision as to which college he-she selects.\ The tuition for next year is $10,965: average housing (a double room, including monthly College phone rental charges) will cost $2,036 and a 19 meal plan $1,900. The total of $14,901 to $13,881 for this year. These figures do not take fees, books and personal expenses into account. Nin~teen percent of the $1,020 revenue per student is allocated to the financial aid budget along with 11 percent of the College's proposed operating costs. These com- bined funds are distributed in grants, loans and through the work study program to about half of Union's students. which could affect his or her choice of career and delay decisions of marriage and childbirth. Sufficient in- formation on such trends will be available within four to five years. One comment of the report was that \recent trends are not encouraging, because the number of well-paying jobs for young people has dropped significantly sin<:e 1~7?. That decline coupled with rismg debt and the growing number of borrowers is 'disturbing.\' Director of Financial Aid Ellen Frishberg feels differently: ''I don't hear about great dislocations for students trying to find jobs.\ The feedback she received through other finan- cial aid offices is mostly ancedota1, though, and she realizes that it may be in- complete. Complaints have. b~en vo.i~ed against the ever-r1smg tmtlon charges, but no realistic alternative is available, ac- cording to Ms. Frishberg. If financial aid were increased, students would be asked to pay Continued on pa~e 2 Present at the meeting were the two student trustees, Julie Mountain 'B7 and Mark Webster '88. They explained that the Board heard reports from its seven subcommittees throughout the day. These subcommittees include Budget and Audit; Finance; Buildings, Grounds, and Equipment; Student Affairs; Academic Affairs; College Resources; and Awards and Nominations. Mountain is a member of the Budget and Audit and Student Affairs subcommittees, and Webster s·erves on the Academic Affairs and Student Affairs subcommittees. The Student Affairs sub- committee reported on several issues. The first was the move of Delta UpsilOfl fnmr Potter House at the end of Fall term, 1986. The building was renovated and consequently some students in five person suites were able to move into the new housing. The telecommunications system was also discussed. Dean of Students, Joseph Mammola, on behalf of the administration, stated that the College had recognized the concerns of the students and had also recognized the problems with billing procedures. Because there was no three month shakedown period before the academic year started, service charges were not included on the fall term housing bill. Mammola cormnented that in general there have been no problems with the system. Mountain stated \The College has recognized the students' opinions and concerns,\ while Webster commented \The administration acknowledges a lack of communication on their part concerning this issue.'' The SAC also reported on the status of the General Education I The focus of current national attention has been the loans taken out by undergraduate students. The congressional report \Student Loans: Are They Overburdening a Generation?\ covers this topic, :E but recognizes its limitations as E the generation in question has not yet matured to the point of supplying conclusive data. \Researchers who have tried to determine what level of debt is manageable have come to no consensus according to the report,\ states the Chronicle of Higher Education. However, it is not uncommon for a student to graduate with $10,000 in loans Photo of th~ W~ek: The snow-blanketed campus as seen from the much-needed Alumni Gym. Plan. The student trustees brought up the fact that a letter was sent to the AAC from the Student Forwn recognizing the proposal and the amount of time and effort that went into producing it. However, it was noted that some faculty members were against the proposal and that the main complaint from this group is that the present proposal is not \dynamic.\ The construction progress of Alumni Gymnasium and the new College Center was discussed. It was stated that Alumni Gym, with the new pool and handball and racquetball courts, should open some time in the middle of February. Unfortunately, the College Center opening date has been pushed back once again, now with a possible completion date of June 1. The Budget and Audit sub- cormnittee presented the 1987- 1988 proposed operating budget. Included were a 7.35 percent increase in tuition and a 7.8 percent increase in financial aid. The proposal was voted on, and all of the Trustees present were in favor except for the Student Trustees, who ab- stained from voting. As Mountain explained \The Student Trustees abstained from voting on the budget in- crease as it included a sizeable increase in student financial aid. We felt that by voting no to the budget increase it would mean that we were against the 1987-1988 financial aid budget as well.\ The increase in tuition represents an increase in faculty pay (merit-based) and benefits, and the fact that three mm·e faculty members will be added in the 1987-1988 academic year. In conclusion, several other issues were discussed in brief. The College Resources su!r committee announced that contributions made to the College were sizea~le ~ast year and tried to predict If future generosity would be affected by the new tax laws. Also, the fate of the Nott Memorial was discussed. The College, in anticipation of its bicentennial celebrations in 1995, hopes to complete much needed renovations of the Nott by then and is looking for possible sources of funds.

Chapel Hill, N.C. ~ I.P.-\The new alcohol policy will definitely change the nature of on-campus soc.ial events,\ according to Dr. Wayne KlUlcl, director of University of North Carolina Housing. \Everyone is going to have to be willing to work together under RHA (Residence Hall Association) guidelines. In .some cases, the policy may have to be worked out on a hall-to-hall basis.\ \Students cannot expect to be allowed to drink if. they are not 21 years old\ Fred W. Schroeder, dean of students, said. No one who is 21 years old will have any privileges taken away from them, bur they will be expected to act responsibly and lUlder the guidelines of the law,\ he said. The policy not only outlines who may drink, but also where they may drink. Properly registered students of sufficient age and their guests of suf- ficient age will be allowed to drink in two outdoor locations. Students may drink on Ehringhaus field with the written appmval of the Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs. They will be allowed to drink aleohol in the areas im- mediately outside residence halls. This is restricted to members of the residence hall and their guests and· requires the written ·approval of the director of university housing. Other areas where alcohol can be consumed on campus are as follows: At planned residence hall social events at which the alcohol provided is done so llnder guidelines that have been .a(iopted ·by RHA. The event 'must also \be approved in writing by the director of 'University Housing; At planned social events .explicltly and directly spon- ~ored by the Student Govern- ment or the Graduate· and Professional Students' Federation at which the alcohol provided is done so under guidelines_ adopted by the :ltudent Government or the Graduate and Professional :Students' Federation.

Kuncl said, \In order to get a feel for how to make that decision it would have to be dealt with a few times.

Apologetic: Everyone is sorry. But not in a remorseful way. Everyone would like to be informed and get involved if they had the time, the energy, the gumption. Everyone is sQrry about that. Reason and Metaphysics: The only .reason to 'get in- volved' as the saying goes is to affirm your human status in a Universe largely filled with inanimate stuff and Nothing and what kind of a reason if that? There are obvious ad- vantages to avoiding their ranks, so I will suggest one possib_le recourse: separate Talk of the Town yourself .from the inhuman Rest by Definition. Leibniz held that the. difference between human and brute is the difference between Reason and Dumb Instinct. Whereas hwnan action is meditative and discriminate, animals are governed solely by the dictates · of Nature and Environment. Leibniz never visited U.C. campus so we will forgive him his gross error because it seems clear that few students here are ever tllougbtfully \active.\ For the most part, we leave the initiative to other forces greater than llS-ilike, for one, there's a PQWer more awesome than ... Who would blame us for sub- mitting our destiny to an Intellect-greater-than-which- calll1ot-possibly-be-jmagined? Not me. No sir. Let's See: I can think of one other metaphysical· priority at stake here. If you actively engage in the day-to~day motions of your world (the U.C. commllllity to begin with), then you have, in a sense, brought yourself a little closer to God or Nature of whatever Supremacy have y-ou. It's simple really-you have participated in the Per- fecti()ll of the Universe and, in so doing, have snatched a little perfection you can uneqlliv()cally call your own. Wow! What a. Boom that is! SeDJe: Use it, that's all. If metapbysics is ' not your bag (and l understand this), you might consider materialistic investments--$60,000 ·is an exorbitant sum · of money fritter away these four years with()ut having the say as to ho-w its spent. $$$ is a precio11s inanimate stuff that amoliilts to Nothing if yo11 don't act th()llghtfully, that's all. _ Moral Sense: As. imminent as. the tllreat of nuclear destruc- tion is: t() the world, the clanger of U.G losing its last bit of resemblance as a place for students appears before us now. Every-one is sorry. I know that. But it hasn't helped us to make U.C. a better school or the World less likely a place for Holocaast. Concordiensis recently asked: \What do you think is the most effective organization on campus and why?\ Mos:t Sense: The best way to delivel' an appeal witll the necessary impact to really bash people into awareness or ab- solute unconsciousness is to entrust the job to someone at once silly and deadly serious.

Apologetic: Every()ne is sorry. But not in a rem()rseful way. Everyone would l:ilte to be informed and get involved if they had the time, the e!Lergy, the gumption. Every()ne is sorry about that. Reason and Meta!)h~sics: The only reason to 'get in~ valved' as the saying goEs is to affirm your hwnan stat1ls in a Universe largely filled with inanimate stuff and Nothing and what kind of a I:\e~son if that? There are obvi()U:S ad- vantages to avoiding their ranks, so I will sug~est one possib_le recourse: separate Talk of the Town yourself from tlle inhuman Rest by Definition. I .. eibniz held that the difference between human and brute is the difference between Reason and Dwnb Instinct. Whereas human action is meditative and discriminate, animals are governed solely by the dictates ()f Nature and Enviromnent. Leilmiz never visited U.C. carnpus so we will forgive him his gross error because it seem.s clear that few students her~ are ever thoughtfully ''adive.\ For the most part, we leave the initiative to other forces greater than us-like, for one, there's a power more awesome than ... Who would blame us for sub- mitting our desbny to an Intellect· great er-tllan·which- cannot·possibly-be-imagined? Not me. No sir. Let's See: I can think of one other metaphysical priority at stake here. If you actively engage in the day-to-day motions of your world (the U.C. community to l>egin with), then you have, in a sense, brought yourself a little closer to God or Nature of whatever Supremacy have you. It's simple really-you have participated in the Per- fection of the Universe and, in so doing, have sn.atched a little perfection you can unequivocally call your own. Wow! What a Boom that is! Sense: Use it, that's all. If metaphysics is not your bag (and I understand this), y_0u might consider materialistic investments--$60,000 is an exorbitant sum of money fritter away these four years without having the say as to how its spent. $$$ is a precious illan.imate stuff that amounts to Nothing if you don't act thoughtfully, that's all. Moral Sense: As imminent as the threat of nuclear destruc- tion is to the world, the danger of U.C. losing its last bit of resemblance as a place for students appears before us now. Everyone is sorry. I know that. But it hasn't helped us to make U.C. a better school or the World less likely a place for Holocaust. Concordiensis recently asked: \What do you think is the most effective organization on campus and why?\ Most Sense: The best way to deliver an appeal with the necessary impact to really bash people into awareness or ab- solute unconsciousness is to entrust the job to someone at once silly and deadly serious. I could never be both so I refer you to Douglas R. Hofstadter: \Social Alternatives Committee for the numerous social alternatives since closing the Pub and Skellar. Jeff Lipsitz '87.

' Marc Graver and Rob Goldrna11. \The Greek life - they are the social life ()f the Campus. Chris [)eBacco .. The Disobedi-Ant The story of the Disobecli-Ant is very short. It refused to believe that its powerful im- pulses to play instead of work were anything but unique ex- pressionsof its very unique self, and it went its merry way, singing \What I choose to do has nothing to do with what any- ant else chooses to do!

A popular breakfast and lun- chtime establishment, Peter Pause is renowned for its friendly hospitality, quick service, and gosh darn satisfyingly wholesome meals. The atmosphere is informal which means that one need not wear one's Sunday best-jeans and clodhopper boots are the norm. It is a pleasure to review this restaurant as we are regular and very satisfied customers. During our last visit, we chose the ravioli with cheese and the tuna salad sandwich. Everything, as always, was very good. The ravioli came with Peter Pause's world famous fresh Italian bread. One cal also order one's sandwich on this bread. May we also recommend the eggplant parmesan sandwich which, incidentally, has been rated number one by Union College's Eggplant Lover's Society. An inside source has revealed to us that the break- fast and lunch specials are the most popular items on the menu. Another perennial favorite is the chicken par- mesan. However, if you remain indecisive after perusing the menu, you may want to ask Joni, the waitress for her opinion. All in all, a ()OSY spot that is within walking distance from your classes. dur rating scale is a:s f()liows. We consider three catel!ories (service, food quality- and ambience) on a scale ()t from 0 to 4, 0 being the lowest 8.11d 4 the highest. We apologize for not exploring the diner sce11e as promised last week,. d11e to technical difficulties. We really will review a valid Scbe11ectady diner next week (and it ~on't be Brandywine).

(Union College 1986-87 Handbook). The Liberal Learning program allows students to take courses outside their own major field of study which are specifically designed for non-majors. One of the more popular science liberal learning courses in Bio-62, World Agriculture, taught jointly by professors P. Tobiessen and C. George. The course description reads as follows, \Human nutrition and population considered within the context of global agriculture, giving particular attention ~ the origin and character of deomesticated plants and animals, the diversity and utility of agriculture, allocation of agricultural products and the problems of effective transfer of agrotechnology.'' The course was designed 9 years ago by professors Tobiessen and George because they noticed that the Union College student body was basically suburban and not wen acquainted with the food cycle, nutrition or agricultural ethics. They feel that now more than ever, agricult~e is turning into a major world political issue. Most Americans do not :!lee agriculture as a problem because American food production is not representative of the world as a whole. Nutritional needs and demands of the world's population are quickly closing in on our ability to produce adequate food supplies. This is one of the major issues stressed in the course. Aside from classroom teaching, the professors have Interfaith dialogues planned This term the Religious Programs Office will present two interfaith dialDgues, starting with \Essential Beliefs and Practices .of Judaism and Christianity,\ on Thursday, Jan. 29. The second, \How Jews and Christians Respond to Contemporary Ethical Issues,\ will take place on Tuesday, Feb. 24. Both programs will be held in Fox Lounge at 7:30p.m. To initiate and guide each dialogue, a guest panel from various Jewish and Christian communities have been invited to attend. designed a field study program in which Union College students gain firsthand knowledge of four local fanns. Professor George said \We are one of the few humanities colleges able to teach a course like this because we have such easy access to local farms.'' Professor Tobiessen added \It is im- portant that students un- derstand the complexity of the decisions farmers face and realize that fanning is a dif- ficult and challenging career choice. The field studies include a dairy farm, a corn fann, a poultry farm and a trip to a grain elevator in Albany. In the last few weeks of the course there is a sllift to \Future and Ethics in Agriculture.\ At this time, professors from other depart- ments give lectures in their own field as related to agriculture. The course ends with a \mini United Nations\ in which each student is asked to represent a country and everyone discusses the most beneficial ways to allocate agricultW'al resources both nationally and globally. When the professors were asked what they thought was the best feature of the course they both agreed that tbey love to teach Bio 62 because each year the course changes with new agriculture legislation and world situations. They both find it a challenge to adapt their teaching to the ever cbanging face of world agriculture.

In the past taking advantage of ooth OPPortunities in the same year was itn.,. possible. Now a new _program has changed this. On a limited basis, students interested in becoming a Resident Advisor and .going in a fall or winter term abroad may do so. A student going on a fall tenn abroad may look forward to retutning to Union as an R.A. for winter and spring. Tlie student participating in a winter ter.m abroad can take advantage .of the Resident Advisor experience in the fall term.

HELFAND Brilliant strides in medical technology aremade every day. Illnesses once fatal are now treatable with over-the-counter medication. One of the most astonishing advances in medical technology is the ability to tr.ansplant the body's power plant, the heart. You would think that such . a miraculous operation would bring nothing ~ut joy; this is not the case. For with great ad- vances, come great respon~ sibilities, the largest being to the general public. For in- stance,· if a member of your· family desperatelY needed a new heart Within two weeks, in order to live, you woUld just ·assume that since the. operation .was both possible and quite · .successful, that it would be done, you·'d get a huge hill .and everything would be all right, right? The only problem is that there are not enough hearts to go around. Patients may have to wait for months · until the appropriate heart is finally located and made available. What's being done Well,. have no fear, super- technology is here. In tbeir quest for the artificial heart, doctors and engineers have filled a void with their life prolonging 'bridges of life. With artificial pumping devic.es, including the Jatvik artificial heart, doctors are saving the- lives of patients waiting for hearts. • In the past year and a half, at least 40 Americans in dire need of heart transplants have been put on prosthetic heart devices that either replace their own hearts., or take over for diseased organs untll hearts ar~ located. Bridge devices, as they've come to be known, are so effective that some medical centers without federal permission to · use them are developing their own . bridgMo-transplant pumps. The jury-rigged devices are centrifugal pumps, put together from the conventional heart-bypass machines used in all open heart surgery. So far, only 15 medical cen- ters around the country, have offiCial permission from the FDA to use artificial hearts or heart assist devices as bridges for transplantation. There are presently two artificial hearts and three assist devices available .for use. The difference between the two is that the artificial heart requires removal of the di$eased organ, whereas the assist device just takes over for the failiqg ven- tricle by pumping blood in and out. Unfortunately, the artificial hearts · are of little use to women. Although a mini-Jarvik has been designed for women, it's too large · for most. J;Joth women on mini,-Jarviks have . died. · The artificial heart is not as effective an interim device as are the prosthetic ventricles that simply tak€ over the heart's pumping. The most widely Ul!led are the Pierce- Donachy prosthetic ventricles which lie .outside the body with tubes running into the major heart vessels. Of 21 patients on the devices so far, 14 were given human heart transplants, some after surviving on the prosthetic devices Ior two and three weeks. Of nine patients who were put on the Jarvik-7, eight eventually underwent the transplantation and six are still \ I I I I I Protthetlc right VM1I1k:le alive. Prosthetic ventricles: The heart is left in witb. tile Pierce-Donach.y devices, and blood flows through pumps outside the body. Arrow shows blood flow. Some believe that the advent of thes~ life-prolonging devices will cause an· even greater shortage of hearts than already exists. This may be the case, but there is a.Iso the possibility that this greater need will produce the ultimate artificial heart. u.s.

By JOHN BERGERON We have all seen that fluorocarbons from aerosol cans are destroying the earth's layer of ozone. However, nitrous oXide (laughing gas). is the ·primary chemical precw·sor in the atmosphere to , nitric oxide, which is· respon- · sible for 7ll percent of the destruction of · the . stratosphere's ozone. Atr firSt, scientists worried over the use of nitrogen fertilizers and the burning of fossil fuels as origins of the pollutant but now deforestation is considered to be a large donor of nitrous oxide to the . atmo.sphere. The clear-cutting of timber increases. the production of nitrous o)dde by SC)il bacteria._ The nitro:(ls oXide, which is very .soluble ia water, dissolves into the soU water and flows to a pond or seep where it is emitted into the air. Although deforestatiol! pro b!ibly does increase the earth's emissions of nitrous oxide it appears that onlY'. young forests ·have a .significant effect on emissions. Older forests already have such . high nitrous oxide emissions · that clear-cutting timber has no discernable effect. . The resUlt of this excess of - nitrous oxide is a loss in the ozone layer and botli ·of earth's P<)les.have only a minimal layer above them. The South Pole's ozone layer has thinned out e,ach September through October for· the past several years. The Arctic re~ion has a _ bole one-third the s~e of the Antarctic's cavity. The North Pole's depletion takes place from October tllrough February. The largest drop in Arctic ozone, .occurring in February, :is 2.6 percent per year; which is half the rate of the Antarctic region's ozone loss. These two holes differ in their positio~s above their respective poles. The Arctic hold is over Spitsbergen, Norway. a .high pressure .zone which is 700 miles away from the North Pole. There is a glut of ozone over a low-pressure region in Alaska. The Antarc• · tic's cavity is affected by huge circular wind patterns over the pole. The area of largest ozone depletion is directly over the South Pole and is surrounded by a highly concentrated ing of ozone. The ozone holes are at their largest during the coldest part of the year. Because the ozone missing in the Antarctic hole ends up in a ring around the hold it seems that the ozone is just getting blown around. The total amount of ozone in the Southern Hemisphere appears to stay almost constant.during one year but year after year of small losses will add up. SCientists recently made the first ob- servation of a global drop in · ozone. A drop of 3 percent in only 6 years. This could have serious consequences because they had predicted a loss of 8 percent over the next century. \ * SUPE:RDANCE• FOR' MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY IS COMING IU FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 27th 10:00 p.ms - 2:00 a.m. ·call- 381-4293 or 370-6118 for info.· \ ., The B:iology Department and Biology Club · Present 1 1he Myth of the Inflexible Invertebrate: The Assembly of a Simple Nervous System'' Tuesday, February 3, 1987 4:30P.M.

Page 10 CONCORDIEN$18, January 29, 1987 Fo~J al { fmon CollqJe 1877 ------------ ------~.·~ A c·ommercial Success It is a sad commentary when a city must proclaim as its two ffi{}St recent revenue producing additions to be .an off- track betting facility and the expansion of one more stop on the Amtrak line. Yes, the Imperial Racing Center, located at 325 State Street (opposite tbe Schenectady Gazette building and in the heart of downtown) seems to epitomize the emphasis of Schenectady's recent economic expansion. Furthermore, the addition of a 3:2!i stop from New York at the Schenectady railioad station was hailed recently in local papers as providing a spurt in the city's economy. What Schenectady needs is real commerce and that is where Union can help. After all, we won't be attractive as an institution if we are located in an aging, unemployment- filled industrial town. Union could turn the dormant Girting Center into a Science and Engineering Industrial Complex. We couJd invite companies' to build research and development centers on oar land and turn the area into a mini-Route 128 or Silicon Valley. The positive effects of this building project would be felt by all parties concerned: 1) the students would benefit from the use ()f these facilities in research and the possibility of future employment 2) the faculty would be able to do extensive work in these facilities and we would continually attract a fine new group of science and engineering professors that would emphasize both teaching and research 3) Union would .become more attractive as a science and engineering institution with a strong liberal arts background 4) the corporations would be able to t11rn big profit margins due to their low rent and use of our scientific community 5) Schenectady and the Capital District would reap large benefits from the real commerce that would be produced here. Other schools such as Princeton, Stanford, an~ R.P.I. have built ind11strial complexes such as the one we are proposing. The complexes have helped move those in- stitutions into the future.* R.P.I.'s George M. Low Center \aims to attractinvestments from private industry see.king to promote new ideas and new products, using the brain- power of the technological institute.'' R.P.I. stands to earn $2.4 million in revenues each year on top of the benefits to students and faculty. . Certainly bold steps would have to be faken to make this project wo-rk, butthen again, that's what-sometimes makes a great institution. Other problems such as zoning laws would have to be ironed out, but Assemblyman James Tedisco who Sllpports the idea, felt confident that these could be altered considering the financial state of the city and its desire for commercial activity. *Courtesy of Schenectady Gazette. Getting tt All Together 1'he lines of comwtication at Union could use con- siderable improvement. Lev~ls of trust and cooperation between the Administration and the campus community ba:ve reached an unproductive low. Severai recent developments have contributed to this at- rnosphere:.postponement and \repostponement\ of con- struction deadlines, lack of response to such issues as the telecommunications system. This distrust is further elevated because the administration does not clearly define their goals and the purpose behind those goals. It is the general belief of the Administration that these issues are too complicated for our comprehension. Their reluctance to release a defined version of the budget is an example of this problem. Furthermore, when the information we receive from various administrators is contradictory it becomes more difficult to trust or sympathize with the Administrators' position. The Administration's conflicting statements concerning the telecommunications system provide a telling example of this. Dean of Residence Life David Wood, said on January 19, 1987 that \When an organized and concerned group of students make a request for in- formation, the college has an obligation to respond to them.\ In a recent interview, How£!ver, Hauser said that the decisions C()ncerning the telecommunications rates had already been finalized and at this point student opinion would have little effect.

Pa1!e 16 CONCORDIENSIS, January 29, 1987 F'oUIUkd at I :mon Collq:c 18 ... ';' ------------- ----~--- A Commercial Success It is a sad commentary when a city must proclaim as its two most recent revenue producing additions to be an off- track betting facility and the expansion of one more stop on the Amtrak line. Yes, the Imperial Racing Center, located at 325 State Street ! opposite the Schenectady Gazette building and in the heart of downtown) seems to epitomize the emphasis of Schenectady's recent economic expansion. Furthermore, the addition of a 3:25 stop from New York at the Schenectady railroad station was hailed recently in local papers as providing a spurt in the city's economy. What Schenectadv needs is real commerce and that is where Union can help. After all, we won't be attractive as a~: institution if we are located in an aging, unemployment- filled industrial town. Union could turn the dormant Girling Center into a Science and Engineering Industrial Complex. We could invite companies to build research and development centers on our land and turn the area into a mini-Route 128 or Silicon Valley. The positive effects of this building project would be felt by all parties concerned: 1) the students would benefit from the use of these facilities in research and the possibility of future employment 2) the faculty would be able to do extensive work in these facilities and we would continually attract a fine new group of science and engineering professors that would emphasize both teaching and research 3) Union would become more attractive as a science and engineering institution with a strong liberal arts background 4) the corporations would be able to turn big profit margins due to their low rent and use of our scientific community 5) Schenectady and the Capital District would reap large benefits from the real commerce that would be produced here. Other schools such as Princeton, Stanford, and R.P.I. have buill industrial complexes such as the one we are proposing. The complexes have helped move those in- stitutions into the future.* R.P.I.'s George M. Low Center \aims to attract investments from private industry seeking to promote new ideas and new products, using the brain- power of the technological institute.\ R.P .I. stands to earn $2.4 million in revenues each year on top of the benefits to students and faculty. Certainly bold steps would have to be taken to make this project work, but then again, that's what sometimes makes a great institution. Other problems such as zoning laws would have to be ironed out, but Assemblyman James Tedisco who supports the idea, felt confident that these could be altered considering the financial state of the city and its desire for commercial activity. *Courtesy of Schenectady Gazette. Getting It All Together 1'he lines of comunication at Union could use con- siderable improvement. Levels of trust and cooperation between the Administration and the campus community have reached an unproductive low. Several recent developments have contributed to this at- mosphere: postponement and \repostponement\ of con- struction deadlines, lack of response to such issues as the telecommunications system. This distrust is further elevated because the administration does not clearly define their goals and the purpose behind those goals. It is the general belief of the Administration that these issues are too complicated for our comprehension. Their reluctance to release a defined version of the budget is an example of this problem. Furthermore, when the information we receive from various administrators is contradictory it becomes more difficult to trust or sympathize with the Administrators' position. The Administration's conflicting statements concerning the telecommunications system provide a telling eKample of this. Dean of Residence Life David Wood, said on January 19, 1987 that \When an organized and concerned group of students make a request for in- formation, the college has an obligation to respond to them.\ In a recent interview, How~ver, Hauser sa:id that the decisions concerning the telecommunications rates had already been finalized and at this point student opinion would have little effect. To improve this situation the Administration could do several things. Instead of waiting for students to bring complaints to them they could solicit student opinion. They could present their goals to the community in through media such as the Concordiensis or WRUC. Then they should provide students with the time and opportunity to respond to their plans. The Administration is not alone in their responsibility. The rest of the campus must also make an effort to work harder. This could be accomplished by an increased effort on the part of the Student Forum, to strengthen the connection between the Administration and the community: through open meetings throughout the campus. Representatives should provide an open two-way connection between students and the administration. What happened to the Forum's election promises of direct con- tact with the students?

Nevertheless, a small mnn:ber ·of colleges have managed to attract. mote ap- .plicants· without sacrificing quality. (My aSSUJl1ption is that either 1) an increase in the quality of our poQl of applicants accompanied by stability in the number of applicants or 2) an increase in the s~e of our pool of applicants accompanied by stability in quality would result in an improvemerit in the' quallty of · students actually entering Union.

Both involve the goal of providing students an environment which challenges them to develop their abilities to the fullest extent and stimulates· them to develop a, lifEtime habit of exploring . anc;l learning. Changing the curriculum is one, but only one, means of reaching towards this g()al. Should we revise the eur:ritulum and fail to work to . bring about changes that reinforce tile latent desire to learn that r~ides in even the most jaded ::otudent, then the best curriculum wiU fail.

Furthermore, such a structure !!ould help us to address the ~sue- of how the College can improve life outside the classroom .a't Union so that it contributes more effectively- to the goals implieit in the idea of general educati'on. In conclusion, I turn to the Concordy's \c:ream of the crop list.\ In his l~tter-to-the-editor in your January 22 issue, Mr. Manly raises the important issue of the validity of the SAT scor.es . as a meas\We of the qu~lUY.

And so where doesthat leave the list of 46? Without question, the list contains many QUtstanding institutions. But it also illustrates the dangers of a slavish devotion to the SAT as the measure of quality in American higher education. Lists of quality based on average SAT scores are in part a reflection of the American infatuation with lists of \10 best,\ or \25 best\ or \46 best,\ an . infatuation given a new outlet by publications such as USA Today. Most such .lists are about as useful as the list of 100 (?) top college presidents carried earlier by Concordy. ,Anyone familiar with certain names on that list could only laugh - or cry. Despite what I say above, the Concordy is to be commended for raising any issue that relates to Union's ability to continue to attract good students.

A second purpose is to underscore tbe idea that we who are already here bave both the opportunity and the respon- sibility to. address: the question ofthe quality of the educational experience at Union. Union has the good fortune to have many students who have great stores of intelligence, energy and commitment to academic and career success. The task of the faculty and the administration is to work to ensure the kind of environment in which those students .can experience the benefits of a liberal arts education in all ,the richness that the term connotes.

From the Albany Desk A Program Worth Noting This week, From the Albany Desk will neither feature an interview with a politician, nor address a major issue. Instead, this column will be dedicated to a group,of devoted students and faculty who are participating in a .program that has greatly influenced the internal workings of the New York State legislature. That program is our own political science. depart- ment's Albany Internship Program. This program was established over fifteen years ago. At that time, it was the only internship program in existence in the state legislatl;lre.. Its success inspired both the Senate and the Assembly to sponsor their own internship programs. Today, these programs draw over 200 college students to Albany, where they help to create legislation that effects the lives of every New York State resident. Union'S program differs from the legislature's program in two important ways. First, Union's program is only. a part-time internship. Participating students spend approximately 12 hours each week working in· their offices. These students must also take two courses here on campus, and attend a weekly lecture every Friday. The legislature's program is a full time internship; much like the term in Washington. Its par- ticipants spend about 40 hours per week working in their of- . fices. · The second major difference is that Union's program is a . volunteer program. Students receive no pay for their office work. Instead, they. receive one course credit for each of the two tenns that the program runs. Tile legislature's interns, . however, are paid for their services. This year, the Albany Internship Program is being directed by Professor Wilcox. Wilcox is in his first year of teaching at Union. He has had experience running internship programs, having previously · directed one in · Washington, DoC. Wilcox feels that Union's program does offer some ad- vantages over the legislature's program. For instance, Union's program lasts until early JUne, whereas the other program ends about one month earlier. This allows our interns an op- ·portunity to observe the legislature during its very active, end-of-s·e ssio n, legislative calendar clearance days, period. Many interns find it difficult to be assigned challenging work in their offices. This is due to the brief length of tfrne that a Union intern spends in Albany each week. The fact that most offices have at least one full·time in- tern, and many have several full-time staff people, only makes it harder for a Union intern to receive a choice project. Wilcox recognizes this problem. He offers this advice to the interns, \Take menial jobs at first, but pick out something interesting that the full.,time intern, or someone else in the office, is doing, .and ask your legislator if you can help with. that project.\ He also advises his students to pay close attention to their first assign- ments, as these will determine if they are to receive additional responsibilities. Although he has been with the program for only a short time, Wilcmc feels that the program has been a success. One of his responsibilities is the placing of students in legislative offices. Wilcox has foWld that there have been many offices where interns have done well in previous years, such as Senator Franz Leichter's and Assema blywornan .Kathy ~olan~s, that are happy to take another Union student. Another successful aspect of Union's program has been its ability to place students with special skills and interests in offices where they can most effectively utilize their talents and knowledge. This year, according to Wilcox, the program was able to place a bilingual student in an office with a large Spanish speaking constituency, and another student, who is a t.egistered nurse; in the office of the Chairman of the Senate Health Committee. From the Albany Desk wish~s this program continued success both in thiS year and in future years.

Additional steps are now under consideration by the Committee and will likely be subject to broader discussion within a short time. In par- ticular, the Committee will be considering a package of specific steps designed to im- prove the quantity and quality of applicants in our pool.

Perhaps more important, I believe that more faculty have given serious thought to curriculum in this debate than in the two or three such debates I have seen here in the past.

Many interns find it difficult to be assigned challenging work in their offices. This is due to the brief length of time that a Union intern spends in Albany each week. The fact that most offices have at least one full-time in- tern, and many have several full-time staff people, only makes it harder for a Union intern to receive a choice project. Wilcox recognizes this problem. He offers this advice to the ifl.terns, \Take menial jobs at first, but pick out something interesting that the full-time intern, or someone else in the office, is doing, and ask your legislator if you can help with that project.\ He also advises his students to pay close attention to their first assign- ments, as these will determine if they are to receive additional responsibilities. Although he has been with the program for only a short time, Wilcox feels that the program has been a success. One of his responsibilities is the placing of students in legislative offices. Wilcox has found that there have been many offices where interns have done well in previous years, such as Senator Franz Leichter's and Assem- blywoman Kathy Nolan's, that are happy to take another Union student. Another successful aspect of Union's program has been its ability to place students with special skills and interests in offices where they can most effectively utilize their talents and knowledge. This year, according to Wilcox, the program was able to place a bilingual student in an office with a large Spanish speaking constituency, and another student, who is a x:egistert>d nurse, in the offke of the Chairman of the Senate Health Committee. From the Albany Desk wish~s this program continued success both in this year and in future years.

Platoon: The War On Film .By ALEX STEPHENS Jacqueline Stone said of her · son Oliver upon his return from Viet Nam in Ul68 that he had changed, \he was a· different boy\. Now, almost twenty years later, Oliver Stone has recreated the experiences of . one of the 2. 7 million Americans who fought, died and returned from the Viet N am War. \Platoon\ is a powerful and poignBnt film that will probably not alter any of its viewer's mentally, but will certainly make hhn or her think. It is playing to sold out theaters everywhere and is being claimed as the most accurate depictionofthewarin VietNam and quite possibly of any war in our history. \Platoon\ transcends the fear and anxieties that producers may have felt about making such a film. The project took Stone ten years to actually get on the screen. It is not the first fUm to depict the war and its effects; attempts such as the patriotic approach of John WaYI!e in \The Green Berets\ Michael Cimino's drama of the bonds of life long friendships in \The Deer Hunter\ and Francis Ford Coppola's world of chaos in \Apocalypse Now\ all sought to show how the war was, but only as a dramatic and violent backdrop, not as the subject alone. At the opening of the film when we first meet the . young Chris Taylor (Charlie Sheen) stepping off a cargo plane we sense his fear. That fea~: is always there, ubiquitous, unless replaced by stronger emotions. There are' no moments of cin.emagraphic shock when something leaps out at you, .no doubt people had their share of that in \Aliens\.

Y ~ we can see and . sense· Chri$' fear and partly understand it, but deep down, it's. an esoteric ·feeling. Probably the only people who can genuinely relate and fully comprehend .much of \Platoon\ are those who have been there and known that internal paradox and fear.

Yet this accurate depiction of the war is only. part· of ''Platoon's\message. The other equally meaningful analysis of war is the loss of innocence. It occurs through the delivery of the young Chris Taylor as the two leaders of the platoon, Sgt. Elias (William Dafoe) and Sgt. Barnes (Tom Berenger), battle for his soul. The question that even the least attentive viewer must ask, as does Chris, is which one to personify in order to survive. Elias is a Jesus Christ figure, \a crusader\. He's brave, skilled in the jungle and, most importantly, just. Barnes is ruthless and for- midable. His deeply scarred face is an illustration of a man who, although shot seven times before, refuses to die. He is the figure of Death, thriving on war. Both are struggling to control the platoon, dividing it into factions following one or the other. The first outward confrontation· occurs just after Barnes has savagely executed a Vietnamese woman in a small village containing · arms and amunition.

When Pryor steps off the stage and attempts to act, he loses the vitality that makes his humor unique. I Will refrain from further comment on this film in order to focus ori the, brighter side of the motion picture in- dustry. D . My recommendation for the week is: SOMETHING WILD R-Rated Cine 10 Northway Mall starring Jeff Daniels and Melanie Griffith The formula of this film is unique and the acting is well done. The plot centers around a conservative young businessman who is somehow lured into cahoots with a free- spirited young woman. He works in the city, wears a three piece suit, and lives in the suburbs, whereas she has no interest in employment, wears silver studded bracelets, and lives out of her leopard-skinned interior convertible. He accepts a ride from her after lunch and later finds himself in a hotel room, naked, handcuffed to the bed, on the phone with his boss trying to explain why he can't make it back into the office that afternoon. Everything is going well lUltil Griffith's deranged ex-boyfriend shows up. \Something Wild\ is quite original and entertaining due to its mix of comedy, violence, drama, and sex. A or should I say \little Brat,\ he needed a big brother to make 'him suffer the consequen~es whenever that little drwn got on my nerves!

All films are in Gertnan, but are shown with English subtitles. 1f you have never seen a German film, please leave the evening of February 9 open and come and · enjoy some excellent selections from the German cinema! , . By JULIESTEINBERG Peter Gabriel has done it again with his l'atest albwn, So. . His artistic talent manages to outdo itself as time progresses. Songs like \Biko \Solsbury Hill,\ \Games Without Fron- tiers,\ and \Shock The Monkey\ all display Gabriel's continual musical genius, and So provides many additional songs of equal caliber. Kate Bush uplifts his spirit with her sweet sounding voice. The politkal fervor that is revealed in \Red Rain\ is similar to that of \Biko and reminds the listening audience of Gabriel's concern and op-- position to negative political activity. Peter Gabriel's ability lets him voice his opinion concerning a topic as strong as that of \Red Rain,\ but then turns one hundred and eighty degrees as he melodically sings of love in \In Your Eyes!' His soothing voice captures the listener as he sings: \In yoar eyes I see tbe light and the heat ... I want to touch the light and the heat I see in your eyes.\ But the most memorable perfQ.rmance is undoubted! y Peter Gabriel's duet with Kate Bush as they combine talents to sing \Don't Give Up.'' The lyrics are those with which everyone can relate. As Gabriel sings of life falling apart before him and nothing going rigl:lt, Kate Bush uplifts his .spirit with her sweet sounding voice and encouraging words: ''Don't give up you have friends you're . not the only one ... don't give up.\ A:lso on 8() are the hit songs ''Sledgehammer' 1 and \Big Time/' Special appearances include .Stewart Copeland on drums ancl Kate Bush, Jim Kerr, and Voussou N'dour on vocals. A. remarkable performance lly Manu Katche on drums sho11ld not go unnoticed. · Peter Gabriel is a man and an artist with · diversified talent who appeals to . a variety of listening audiences. His separation from Genesis really Wlcovered his best work and gave him the chance to perform it for an audience that is less pop-oriented than what Phil Collins has now developed Genesis into.

CONCORDIENSIS, January 29, 1987 Page 13 Film Review ... The Tin Drum By CHRISTOPHER SEMENUK On Monday, January 26, the secend in a series of four German films organized by PrGfessor Kellenter of the German Department was shown in SS 016. The film The Tin Drmn, produced by Volker Schlondorff, was an adaptation ·Of Gunther Grass' novel which was awarded an Oscar as best foreign language film. The film showed the audience a segment of 20th century German history which few of us are very familiar with. The film is portvayed through the eyes of a young boy named Oskar, who refuses to grow and accept both the ugliness of his family en- viromnent and the bigotry of his society which is slowly being engulfed by facism. The movie gets its name from a toy drum that Oskar receives on his third birthday. Incessantly playing the drllm and never taking his hands off it becomes Oskar's way of protesting the changes occurring in his family and the changes brought upon society by the influx of fascism. The film displayed much ugliness threugh the actions and appearances of the actors and through the personal and emotional problems that they encountered. The film begins and ends with the same scene of a desolate gray landscape. Perhaps this showed that the hardships and the ugliness that Oskar had witnessed and protested against so vehemently by playing his drwn, could not be changed by him Qr anyone else. Oskar endured these troubled times by distancing himself from their effects, but in the end they never seemed to vanish. The changes inflicted upon his family and upon his en- vironment were there to stay and rwming away from them would not change a thing. The message came across loud and clear, but after an hour and a half of this almost three- hour movie I began to wonder when the next batch of popcorn would be ready. V alker Schlondorff was beating a dead horse. Perhaps he has seen Ghandi one too many times. After listening to Oskar beat his little toy drum throughout a large portion of the mavie-it seemed like forever-I finally cheered when he was beaten up by a gang of neighborhood youths. The rest of the acting was exceptionable and at times reminded me of the afternoon soap operas. The ending brought with it no real reward for those who followed the entire movie looking for hidden messages, but it could have been livened up for those of us who began to wonder if we'd make it home in time for David Letterman. For those who were able to endure the lengthy production, The Tin Drum provided interesting entertainment and provocative symbolisms. Schlondorff could have made the production much shorter and still have gotten the same point across in an hour and a half. As for \little Oskar,\ or should I say \little Brat,\ he needed a big brother to make 'him suffer the consequences whenever that little drum got on my nerves! The next film in the series is also by Volker Schondorff, called The Sudden Fortune of the Poor People of Kombach. It will be shown February 9, at 7:30p.m. in SS 016. All films are in German, but are shown with English subtitles. If you have never seen a German film, please leave the evening of February 9 open and come and enjoy some excellent selections from the_ German cinema~ THE ARTS Jan and Buddy at the Movies One should examine my credibility .prior to observing my theatrical recemmendation. Why even. acknowledge the opinion of a person whose ar- ticles on occasion reflect illiteracy and whose days are spent in the cempany of a mutant canine? Often the writer cannot be liable for what ac- tually is printed. My article last week was missing a few very valuable lines. Due to the ab- sence of these lines the article made little sense. The reason I feel inclined to mention this printing erratum is simply because it unjustly reflects on both myself and my prestigious proofreader. As to my everatl credibility to evaluate movies one must formulate his or her own opinion. If anyone actually does read our subjective cinematic views each week they would begin to think that Buddy and I pur- posely set out to view only ridiculous films. We have a tendency to choose the worst of films and hence end up satirically ripping them to shreds. This act has not been premeditated though; it has occurred naturally. As a result of the number of movies aimed to entertain the minds of the moronic, Buddy and I have become extremely critical and pessimistic each time we enter the theater. Last week Richard Pryor's new film facilitated our process l>y accurately summing up the state ef the movie in its own title, ''CRITICAL CON- DITION.\ Pryor seems to have trouble being amusing unless he is standing on a stage in a white suit uttering a monologue chock-full of profanities. When Pryor steps off the stage and attempts to act, he loses the vitality that makes his humor unique. I will refrain from furtller comment on this film in order to focus on the brighter side of the motion picture in· dustry. D My recommendation for the week is: SOMETHING WILD R-Rated Cine 10NorthwayMall starring Jeff Daniels aad Melanie Griffith The fcnnmla of this film is unique a.nd the acting is well done. The plot centers around a conservative young businessman who is somehow lured int~ cahoots with a free- spirited young woman. He works in the city, wears a three piece suit, and lives in the suburbs, whereas she has no interest in employment, wears silver stlldded. bracelets, and lives out ()f her leopard-skinned interior C()nvertible. He accepts a ride fr()rn her after lunch and later fi.rl<Ul himself in a hotel room, nalted, handcuffed to the bed, on the phone with his boss trying to explain why he can't make it back into the office that afternoon. Everything is going well until Griffith's deranged ex-boyfriend shows up. \Somefhing Wild\ is quite original .and entertaining due to its mix of comedy, violence, drama, ~nd sex. A Peter Gabriel • • • So By JULIE STEINBERG Peter Gabriel has done it again with his latest album, So. His artistic talent manages to outdo itself as time progresses. Songs like \Biko \Solsbury Hill,\ \Garnes Without Fron- tiers,\ and \Shock The Monkey'' all display Gabriel's continual musical genius, and So provides many additional songs of equal caliber. Kale Bush uplifts his spirit with her S\H'd sounding \Oi('r. The politkal fervor that is revealed in \Red Rain\ is similar to that of \Biko and reminds the listening audience of Gabriel's concern and op- position to negative political activity. Peter Gabriel's ability lets him voice his opinion concerning a topic as strong as that of \Red Rain,\ but then turns one hundred and eighty degrees as he melodically sings of love in \In Your Eyes.\ His soothing voice captures the listener as he sings: \In your eyes I see the light and the heat .. .I want to touch the light and the heat I see in your eyes.\ But the most memorable performance is undoubtedly Peter Gabriel's duet with Kate Bush as they combine talents to sing \Don't Give Up.\ The lyrics are those with which everyone can relate. As Gabriel sings of life falling apart before him and nothing going right, Kate Bush uplifts his spirit with her sweet sounding voice and encouraging words: \Don't give up you have friends you're not the only one ... don't give up.\ Also on So are the hit songs \Sledgehammer\ and \Big Time.\ Special appearances include Stewart Copeland on drums and Kate Bush, Jim Kerr, and Youssou N'dour on vocals. A remarkable pedormance by Manu Katche on drums should not go unnoticed. Peter Gabriel is a man and an artist with diversified talent who appeals to a variety of listening audiences. His separation from Genesis really Wlcovered his best work and gave him the chance to perform it for an audience t:hat is less pop-oriented than what Phil Collins has now developed Genesis into. I have to say that So is my clloice for Best Album of 1986 with Peter Gabriel as Best Male Artist, and neither one shO>uld be overlooked!!!

Although the films available are not the most recently released, the series includes many renowned and Oscar winning titles. With a desire to introduce students to German films, the ones Kellenter chose are very serious and intellectual. The German Cinema has made new strides since 1930, when Ger- man films formerly received a lot of recognition. Abo11t 15 years old, the \New German Cinema\ is internati<mally reputed. The five most in- fluential filmmakers in Ger- many were born during or right after the war. They are very critical of society and deal mainly with German history and what led up to the Nazi era. In Germany, these types of films are not wide commercial successes. For the German people today are products of one of the wealthiest countries, and are not concerned with the serious and depressing hap- . penings of the \past.\ In response to this apathy, the new breed of filmmakers want to shock their audience. Through themes of homosexuality, portraying outcasts of society- older women and younger men- the films try to convey the uses of power and oppression. As Kellenter points out, the artists \have a fascination with the negative and destrictuve elements in ourselves.\ There was a time when literary works were often made into pictures. In fact, two of the fihns in the series are adaptations of novels. Dealing with grotesque and shocking situations, the \New German Cinema\ is incredibly innovative. Often, the fihns are quite depressing, for that is the clear intent. For example, the first film in the series, Fassbiner's \Why Does Herr R. Run Amoke?\ is an extremely stylized picture. It is slow moving and deliberately boring. The purpose of the film is to show the hopelessness and futility of life. Granted these themes are not generally popular, Kellenter's students were on the whole appreciative of the meaning and depth that the fihn offered. This week's showing ''The Tin Drum\ is one of he Oscar winners in the series. The following feature, Schlondorff's \The Sudden Fortune of the Poor People of Kombach\ is a historical drama dealing with the subject of morality. The final film, another Schlonforff master- piece, \Young Torless\ is the recipient of many awards. This adaptation of a novel portrays a young boy growinging up in a boarding school. All of the movies have something special to offer the audience comprised of students, faculty, and members of the Schenectady community. Anyone with an interest in German and especially History should by all means take advantage of this rare opportunity to see some of the most exceptional cinema produced. Sponsored by the department of Modern Languages and Phi Beta Kappa, the German Film Series provides the College with a unique glimpse of German History. Hopefully, this event will give rise to an International Film Festival. Meanwhile, Professor Kellenter has gone to an applaudable effort to bring to Union a different kind of en- tertainment. j

Included in the record is a poster size lyric sheet in six languages. Musically, this record is out- standing. Joe has too many influences to mention-as do his band which he hired solely for this record. Side one begins with a theme of expansion. \wild Wet\ en- courages people to ~ove on and explore things-but Joe throws in a western theme (and guitar). The title track con- tinues that idea \It's a big world-so much to do! - And Plenty of room for me and you.\ On side two, Jae .gets in- ternational with tunes like ''Shanghai Sky''. He even recognizes the 4oth anniversary of the end of WW II in \Forty Years\. \Where I come from- They don't like Americans much - Think they're so loud, so tasteless, and so out of touch\. Joe feels that the Allies have last touch since the end of the war. By side three, the record zooms in more on an individual. Joe sings about his \Hometown\: sometimes when the music stops -I seem to hear a distant sound - of waves and . seagulls, football crowds and church bells - and I want to go back to my hometown.\ \Jet Set\ looks at class differences and \Man In The Street\ romanticizes simplicity. The sound quality of this record is excellent and the compact disc is undescribable. Joe is one step ahead of a lot of commercial garbage that is currently polluting the air- waves. Listen to this record and rejoice when Joe sings in \Right and Wrong'': Stop everything - I think I hear the president - the pied piper of the tv screen - is going to make it simple - And he's got it all mapped out - And illustrated with cartoons - Too hard fon clever folks to understand.\ -Recorded six months before the Iran-Contra exposure. t• t:J li\ ~ li\ 10)1q1Glllll L lWOO~OOLmL:!J ~~· IN THE PUB II THURSDAYS TWO SHOWS a:oo & to:oo ~~a ~~ t:::I''R 1 1 11 *i''l'! ~~~ R~ ALCOHOL AVAILABLE (J t AT LATE SHOW. , .. ll ~ .J;K,~UST BE 21 W /1.~-~ r- Oliver Stone's Platoon Continued from page 12 actual experiences. In a small village he emptied a clip at the feet of Vietnamese man because he would not stop smiling, just as Chris does at the true point of his loss of in- nocence (yet then Chris rescues a young girl fram being raped by two of the platoon's mem- bers, another moment in Stone's 15 month stay). A member of Stone's platoon cracked open the head of Vietnamese man and then related to everyone how great it was, much in the manner that the character of Bunny (Kev·in Dillon) does following Chris' release of anger. Filmed in the lush jungles of the Philippines, \Platoon\ shows the anonymity of war, that luck is more important than all out skil:l. Stone spoke of his experiences as being j-ust that, \combat\, he said, \is totally random\. The final firefight has Chris in a foxhole in the middle of the night as they attempt to protect the U.S. force's basecamp (Stone ap- pears as a Hlajor in a bunker of THE ARTS CABARET: Back and BeHer Than Befo:re By JASON GREEN Starting this Thursday night, Union College will be treated to a new improved and exciting transfarmation of Cabaret. Reminiscient of those days in Carnegie, Cabaret will be moving to The Pub II for two shows every Thursday night. The shows, scheduled for 8:00 and 10:00 will proVide an ample opportunity for the students and faculty to enjoy student per- formances in a more ambient atmosphere than was provided in Old Chapel. Better yet, the camp). As a multitude of NV A soldiers begin to surround them and move in Chris becomes a killing macbine, reflecting a singlehanded at- tack done by Elias earlier. It is a nightmarish scene as bombs and flares illuminate the jungle and screams and gunfire fill the air. It finally ends when the commander of the operation regretfully gives the order for the U.S. jets to bomb within their designated perimeter. The dreamy state is carried into the morning when Chris awakes, bloody and burned, and resolves the self-perpetuating dilema between the factions of the because there will be two .shows, the first show will be open to everyone, while the 10:00 show will be exclusively for those over 21, and alcohol will be available for those who wish to imbibe. It's an old tradition to provide alcohol at Cabaret, and we are grateful to Jan Gray and Lorraine Marra for making it possible once again. Act I will feature Wendy Richards and Dave Provost, and during the second act, Wendy will join Jeff Winter and Jim Havard in a performance sure to rock the roof off of the . Nott. platoon and himself. There are other underlying messages in \Platoon\, such as racism against the black members and doubt about the validity of the war itself. The last words of the film belong to Chris' naration. \We weren't fighting the enemy\ he says, \we were fighting ourselves\. It is difficult to take this statement as anything but melodramatic. Yet, as a vet himself, Stone experienced the traumas of the war, the battle in the jungles and in his mind, but also the traumas of returning to his country that only just recently accepted the outcome.

Page 18 -CONCORDIENSlS,. ]tlnuary 29, 1987 A large portion of Union College's student body parw ticipates in varsity and junior varsity sports. However, have you ever stopped to think about why these athletes participate in their respective sports? Well, after myself and many of the people that I know began to participate in sp()rts I started to wonder what the reasons for this were. After all, Union College is not knClwn for its easy academic work load. With this in mind, I asked around trying to find the reason for people wanting to give up a great deal of their .study time as well as social time. Regardless of what the sport is, college sports take up a great deal more time than do any_ high school sports. I asked each athlete the same brief question. \Why do you play on a team at Union College?\ The answers that were given varied. Some people said that playing a sport was the only sure way that they could keep in shape. A great majority of the athletes I asked said that college is more than just books and classes. Sports is an escape from constant studying. It is a time to take your mind off academics and let loose for awhile. This response seemed to be a very common one. Yet, there was one constant answer which each and every person agreed upon. For many high school athletes, continuing to play in college is expected of them. Former basketball NOT IN THE BOX SCORE. Mark Zimmerman player, senior Tim Diemoz said that he had played basketball all his life. When lle went away to school it seemed only natural that he would continue to play. It was as if it was expected. Junior Steve DeBalso, who also plays basketball agreed with Tim. Steve said-that not only does he enjoy the sport a great deal, but it's a habit at this point. Other athletes, many of whom were standouts in high school had parental pressure. One football player responded that playing foot ban was the only way to keep his father happy. Although the student loves playing football, for him it is also a habit that he bas built up over his lifetime. Athletics really is a habit as well as a love. Many athletes who were stand()uts in high school seem to feel as if they must play in college to keep up others' expectations of them. Although there is n(}thing wrong with this, athletes should really sit down and think before deciding to play a collegiate sport. At college tbe pressure is double that of high schClol. In addition, those peo~le who were local stars at home find that they are nothing more than a typical player at <:ollege. After all is said and done, it is really up to the athlete himself to decide whether he-she wants to play.

Page 18 CONCORDIENSIS, January 29, 1987 A large portion of Union College's student body par- ticipates in varsity and jWlior varsity sports. However, have you ever stopped to think about why these athletes participate in their respective sports? Well, after myself and many of the people that I know began to participate in sports I started to wonder what the reasons for this were. After all, Union College is not known for its easy academic work load. With this in mind, I asked aroWld trying to find the reason for people wanting to give up a great deal of their study time as well as social time. Regardless of what the sport is, college sports take up a great deal more time than do any_ high school sports. I asked each athlete the same brief question. \Why do you play on a team at Union College?\ The answers that were given varied. Some people said that playing a sport was the only sure way that they could keep in shape. A great majority of the athletes I asked said that college is more than just books and classes. Sports is an escape from constant studying. It is a time to take your mind off academics and let loose for awhile. This response seemed to be a very common one. Yet, there was one constant answer which each and every person agreed upon. For many high school athletes, continuing to play in college is expected of them. Former basketball N~OT IN THE BOX SCORE Mark Zimmerman player, senior Tim Diemoz said that he had played basketball all his life. When he went away to school it seemed only natural that he would continue to play. It was as if it was expected. Junior Steve DeBalso, who also plays basketball agreed with Tim. Steve said· that not only does he enjoy the sport a great deal, but it's a habit at this point. Other athletes, many of whom were standouts in high school had parental pressure. One football player responded that playing football was the only way to keep his father happy. Although the student loves playing football, for him it is also a habit that he has built up over his lifetime. Athletics really is a habit as well as a love. Many athletes who were standouts in high school seem to feel as if they must play in college to keep up others' expectations of them. Although there is nothing wrong with this, athletes should really sit down and think before deciding to play a collegiate sport. At college the pressure is double that of high school. In addition, those people who were local stars at home find that they are nothing more than a typical player at college. After all is said and done, it is really up to the athlete himself to decide whether he-she wants to play. However, no matter what the reason for someone' s decision to play college sports, it should be their own decision and no one else's. _...-: ..

~. I [ d q l. __ j' i • f ' - CONCORDJENSIS, January 29, 1987 Page 19 Athlete of the Week . . . I - By .DOUGLAS LLOYD For Union sport fans there can be no doubt as to v.rho this week's.Atblete of tbe Week is. It goes to senior Duane Joyce of the skating Dutchmen who bas been the main ·scoring power over the last four games, of which the Dutchmen have been victorious in three. The recently awoken Dutchmen offense has been led by Duane (with eight goals and 15 assi,sts ), a four- year starter on defense for Coach Morrison. Duane began creating .scoring ~ opportunities and putting the puck in the net when Union traveled to Worcester, MA to play Holy Cross; where he scored four assists in the 'losing effort. Last Wednesday, the Middlebury Panthers traveled to Schenectady where they were trounced, 10-2, with solid play at both ends and Duane collected one goal and three assists for his s{lcond straight folll'-point effort. Duane continued his streak this past weekend at Lady . Swim·mers Open Season On· A High Note! Await New Pool By MARTY PHIPPS The' women's swim · team opened up what may prove to be _ its best season yet on January 20 in .a meet against Utica College. This is the largest team in the history of women's swimming at Union, with eleven swimmers.- Our increased size gave us depth, which is necessary for a strong team. Although Union lost the meet at Utica, we had some very good swims. Union's opening relay team took a first place, which was followed by a strong showing in the 100()-yeard freestyle. Lisa Pizzato and Joy Cybul, both freshmen, took first and second place respectively. Lisa also took ffrst in the 200 Individual Medley and the 500 freestyle, while Joy finished third in the 500. Kathy Kaveny (90) took first place in the 100 Fly, Wendy Steinberg (90) .finished second in the 100 back, and Donna Gardiner (87) was second in the 200 free .. Cindy Curtis set a new Union record with a 1:19.75 in the 100 breast stroke a time that gave her a second place.·union finished off the meet with a first place tie in the closing relay, and then going out to a great Greek restaurant with the Millett fiUJlily. Theteam'traveled to Norwich University on Saturday, January 21. Again, Union won. the opening relay. other first placefinisheswere Joy Cybul in the one Meter diving, Lisa Pizzato in the 500 free, and Cindy Curtis in the 100 breast. Second place finishers were Joy Cybul-1000 free!it;yle,. Wendy · Steinberg-~200 free and 100 back. Jamie Lipster-50 .free and 100 free; Lisa Pizzato-200 I.M., and Jen Nolart-100_ breast. Another second place finiSher was Kathy Kaveny, whose 1:()6.36 in the 100 butteiily set a new Union record. Coaches Magee and Morrison were both pleased with the women's performance; which 1$ expected to improve even more cnce the new pool is ..open. bl;Jane Joyce Buffalo where he earned one goal atld two as~ists m the 6-3 Friday night win for the Dut- chmen. It didn't stop there, as Duane helped lead tile team to another 6-3 vict()cy with two go&]s and two more assists at Geneseo. AU totaled, Duane has notched 15 points ( 4 goals and 11 assists) in his last four games aJtd has helped the Dutchmen g~t on track offensively and dEfensively forthe stretch to the playoffs. Duane's effoJ.ts have also been acknowledged by the E:CAC as he was named the Ea~t·.West Defenseman of the Week for his outstanding per- formance.. Duane, along with Melson Said and Gary Temush all take five-game scoring streaks into last night's game a~ainst Plattsburgh.

Dutchmen Run Well At Plattsburgh Qy the MEN'S'TRACK 'rEAM ·on Saturd~y, the Union College track teams trekked north for the Cardinal Classic Invitational meet at Platt- sburgh State. The women's team captured tilird place out of six teams, while the men came away with fourth out of nine. Perhaps Unlon's biggest challenge came from b()redom, as the meet dr~gged for over · seven hours. Despite the length of the meet., 1m wever, there were several exciting races and fine.perform.a11ees turned in by the Dutchmen. Plattsburgh State~ won the women's meet handily with 205 points; while Albany State barely edged Union for second place, 94-90. The depth of the women's team was a big iactor in their success, as they -often . sc()red two or t:hree runners in an event desl)ite having a lack of first places. The Lady Dut- chemn's only JiliDS came from the 4x440 yard relay which . clGcked 4: 30.~, and Julie Halpern, who sprinted to vic- tory in the .300 meter dash in 46.2 seconds. Halperil; a senior, also . added a third -place in the 55 meter hurd!~ (9.41 second$) and fourth place .in the shot put (7 .76 meters) and high jump ( 4 feet, 4 inchEs). Sophomore L9rie Anderson continued her outstanding indoor campaign With a fourth place in the nigh jump ( 4 feet 4 Inches), and fifth places in the 55 meter hurdles (10.4 seconds), shot put (7.51 meters) and 80() meters (2:40). Also having fbte meets were sophomore Lynn~ Erdman, whose time of 1:34 was good . en()ugh for seco11d place in the MOmeters, and .freshman Sir ley C11gle, who uncorked a time of [)7. 6 seconds in the 400 meter dMh. Cagle foll()wed up that second place finish with another iil the high jump, as she vaulted 4 feet 4 inches. 'l'he University of Vermont was victorious in the men's meet, as their 181 points topped St. Lawrence's 119, Plattsburgh State's 100 and Union's 41. The Union men, like the women, could only m11ster one in- dividual victor-y. That win came from Junior Jeff Barker, who continued to turn heads with his t1·iumph in the 500 meter dash. Barker led wire to wire as he blazed to a time of 68.7 seconds. Ji'reshman Jeff Simkins also SC()red in the. 500, as he added a fourth in that event to his fourth place in the highjump (6feet 0 inches).

It is a one-point ballgame, 17- 16. There ,is one second ·remaining in the game. A timeout has been called by the offensive team .. The ball is on the opponents' 32-yard line. The fate of the Super Bowl hangs in the balance of a small European's foot. The two teams take to the field, and the television networks break back from their 600,000 dollar -cornmercials. The culmination of a year's worth of hard work for both teams comes down to the kick of the ball. The snap is down, the kh;k is up, and the silent crowd watches as the ball starts to hook to the left. It is a high, towering kick, well above the height constraints of the field goal posts. The ball sails above the upright, over the net, and into the crowd. All eyes are fixed on the back judges. The signal is delayed as the two referees confer with each other · as to the correct call. After being joined by the other referees the signal is made. The kick is ruled good, and the logo of the winning team is displayed on the screen with the Vince Lombardi trophy and the graphics proclaiming the new NFL champions. But wait, the players are still on the field and the referees are again con- ferring. The kick has been challenged and the controversy has been sent to the instant replay booth for review. This scenario, although fic- titious, iS quite a realistic possibility. The replay of- ficiating crew, who is fed replays through a closed net- work cable hook-up, is now the sole determinant of the outcome of the . game. The men in the network van: work furiously to produce reverse and other angle shots to aid the com• mittee' s decision making process. A decision in this game, after a 12-minute delay, based on the available replays at the time has ruled in favor of the referees' call and the play stands. l.4lter, after the game when all angle shots are \ available, it was seen.. that the referee's call was in error, and the ball clearly passed wide of the uprights. A fallacious NFL .champion remains, as a result of a just rule stating that a call can only be overturned at the time of tbe game by the replay officials. On paper, the instant replay rule looks like a genuinely helpful technol()gical advance in aiding the referee in his at- tempt to ()fficiate a fair game. But this is one technical ad- vance that belongs more with · the Snoopy electric toothbrush than in professional football or · any other athletic contest for that matter. , There are numerous un- deniable reasons .for discon- . tinuing the \experimental use\ of the instant replay. Replay With a Perspective On-Sports A-nd.rew Miller reviews involve delays. There is no way around it. In a decade in which professional football owners are trying to shape the game of football into a form more conduCive to television network needs, the im· plernentation of the instant replay appeal seems to go against one of the networ-ks' biggest complaints, the length ·of the game. NFL games alreadY average over three hours apiece, this coming on a Sunday of doubleheader action on two of the three major net- works. Unwarranted delays just increase the already tediotlll viewing in unexciting games and set back the regular net- work television schedule by hours. A major network com· plaint centers aroWld the fact that these delays cannot be turned into commercial time. The coverage must continue, for a ruling could come at any time. Most rulings average 2-3 minutes, but some like the Detroit vs. Minnnesota game took 14 minutes. Super Bowl XXI brought extensive national attention to the problems involved with instant replay use. A Jon Elway pass to receiver Clarence Kay was ruled incomplete by the official. The play was challenged and sent to the replay booth. After a 2-3 minute delay the replay was said t() be inconclusive and the call stood. Minutes later a new angle was shown to the audience which clearly proved that Kay did, in fact, make the catch. The in· correct call thwarted a first half Denver drive and forced the Broncos to punt. It may not haye been the deciSive play in the game but it did shift the m<>mentum and give the Giants the ball. It also showed that the 11 instant replay machines are not always accurate. The dif• ferent angles either are not available on certaiQ. plays, d11e to poor camera wot:k, a blocked view, lighting problems (etc.), or take too long to be processed and are not available for reple. y use. Keeping these problems in mind it seems the replay rule causes more controversy than clarity. Technical and judgmental problems aside, the major problem with the network supplied replays is obviously the unnecessary and un- mistakeably significant role .of the network. When television beeomes the key determinant ill an athletic contest something has gone astray. What ever did football do before the instant replay, or television for that matter. Now this technological monstrosity iS bemg introduced to college basketball. In its first few weeks it has already af· · fected the national rankings with its robbing of number one UNL V of a victory over Oklahoma and its top spot in the polls. In this day and age in which technology is taking over the world, replacing humans at jobs, and altering the way we live, let's give fQotball and athletics back to tlle people, return the decisions back to the referees, and start brushing by band. This is one man's opinion.

.! i ,; ' ,! By DOUGLAS LLOYD F\or Uni()n sport fans there can be no doubt as to who this week's Athlete of the Week is~ It goes to senior Duane Joyce of the skating Dutchmen wh() has been the main scoring PQWer over the last four games. of which the Dutchmen have been victorious in three. The recently a woken Dutchmen offense has been led by Duane (with eight goals and 15 assists), a four- year starter on defense for Coacb Morrison. - Du.ane began creating scoring · opportunities and putting tbe puck in the net when Union traveled to Worcester, MA to pla:y Holy Cross, where he sc()red four assists in the losing effort. Last Wednesday, the Middlebury Panthers traveled to Schenectady where they were trounced, 10-2, with solid play at l>oth ends and Duane collected one goal and three assists for !lis second straight four-point effort. Duane continued his streak this past weekend at Lady Swimmers Open Season On A High Note! Await New Pool By MARTY PHIPPS The women's swim team opened up what may prove to be its best season yet on January ZO in a meet against Utica College. This is the largest team in the history of women's swimming at Union, with eleven swimmers. Our increased size gave us depth, which is necessary for a strong team. Although Union lost the meet at Utica, we had some very good swims. Union's opening relay team took a first place, which was followed by a strong showing in the 1000-yeard freestyle. Lisa Pi2zato and Joy Cybul, both freshmen, took first and second place respectively. Lisa also took first in the 200 Individual Medley and the 500 freestyle, while Joy finished third in the 500. Kathy Kaveny (90) took fir'st place in the 100 Fly, Wendy Steinberg ( 90) finished second in the 100 back, and Donna Gardiner (87) was second in the 200 free .. Cindy Curtis set a new Union record with a 1:19.75 in the 100 breast stroke a time that gave her a second place. Union finished off the meet with a first place tie in the closing relay, and then going out to a great Greek restaurant with the Millett family. The team traveled to N()rwich University on Saturday, January 21. Again, Union won the opening relay. Other first place finishes were Joy Cybul in tlle One Meter diving, Lisa Pizzato in the 500 free, and Cindy Curtis in the 100 breast. Second place finishers were J.oy c,bul-1000 freestyle, Wendy Steinberg-·200 free and 100 back. Jamie Lipster--50 free md. 100 free, Lisa Pizzato-200 I.M., and J en Nolan-100 breast. Allother second place finisher was Kathy Kaveny, whose 1:06.36 in the 100 butterfly set a new Union record. Coaches Magee and Morrison were both pleased with the women's performance, which is expected to impr()ve even more once .the n>€w pool is open.

It didn't stop there, as Duane helped lead the team to another 6-3 victory with two goals and two ffi()re assists at Geneseo. All totaled, Duane has notched 15 points ( 4 goals and 11 assists) in his last four games ami has help.ed the Dutchmen get on traclt: of£ensively and defensively f&r tile stretch to the playoffs. Duane's efforts have also been acknowledged by the ECAC as be was named the East-West Defenseman of the Week for his otltstanding per· formance. Duane, along with Nelson Said and Gary Temush aU take fiv,e-game scoring streaks into last night's game against Plattsburgh. The native ~f Pembroke, MA was last year's fourth leading scorer and has already outdone his personal best in assists With 15. Duane is a brother of Psi Upsilon and majors in economics. Co11gratulations to Duane and tile skating Dut- cbemn on their recent suc- cesses. Dutchmen Run Well At Plattsburgh By the MEN'S TRACK TEAM On Saturday, the Union College track teams trekked north for the Cardinal Classic Invitational meet at Platt· sburgh State. The women's team captured third place out of six teams, while the men came away with fourth out of nine. Perhaps Union's biggest challenge came from boredom, as the meet dragged for over seven hours. Despite the length of the meet, however, there were several exciting races and fine. performances turned in by the Dutchmen. Plattsburgh State· won the women's meet handily with 205 points, while Albany State barely edged Union for second place, 94-90. The depth of the women's team was a big factor in their success, as they often scored two or three runners in an event despite having a lack of first places. The Lady Dut· chemn's only wins came from the 4x440 yard relay which clocked 4:30.2, and Julie Halpern, who sprinted to vic- tory in the 300 meter dash in 46.2 seconds. Halpern, a senior, also added a third place in the 55 meter hurdles (9.41 seconds) and fourth place in the shot put (7.76 meters) and high jump (4 feet, 4 inches). Sophomore Lorie Anderson continued her outstanding indoor campaign with a fourth place in the high jump (4 feet 4 inches), and fifth places in the 55 meter hurdles (10.4 seconds), shot put (7.51 meters) and 800 meters (2:40). Also having fine meets were sophomore Lynne Erdman, whose time of 1:34 was good enough for second place in the 500 meters, ami freshman Sirley Cagle, who uncorked a time of 67.6 seconds in the 400 meter dash. Cagle .followed up that second place finish with another in the high jump, as she vaulted 4 feet 4 inches. The UniveTsity of Vermont was victorious in the men's meet, as their 1Bl points topped St. Lawrence's 119, Plattsburgh State's 100 ancl Union's 41. The Union men, lik:e the women, could only muster one in- dividual vi~tory. That win came frorn Junior Jeff Barker, who continued to turn heads with his triumph in the 500 meter dash. Earker led wire to wire as he bla.2ed to a time of 68.7 seconds. Freshman Jeff Simkins also scured in the 500, as he added a fourth in that event to his fourth place in the high jwnp (6 feet 0 inches). Also scoring for the Dutchmen were senior Mike Reed, whose strong finish in the 1500 meters got him fourth place, and Steve Hayes, who chipped in a third place in the 300 meter dash (38.2 seconds) and a fifth place in the 55 meter dash (6.80 seconds). Union coach Russ Ebbets also donned his track shoes on Saturday, as he cruised to a fifth place finish in the 800 meters for On ['he Road Track Club (OTR). Ebbets and OTR will be spons~ring an open meet this coming Saturday at the field hou.se. The TAC- sanctioned meet should prove exciting as it will feature many of the top area high school runners as well as a strong college field.

January 29, 1987 Offense On Track, Skaters Win 3 Straight By GAVIN MORTON The Union College hockey team has finally got itself in gear with three wins in a row including its first two road wins of the year. Last Wednesday night could have been their best effort of the year as the Dut- clunen excelled in every aspect of the game and totally dismantled the Middlebury Panthers 10-2. Ron Kinghorn, back in goal for the first time in two weeks, made several big saves in the final period after the Panthers had scored on their first shot. Kinghorn stopped 24 of 26 shots and turned in his best per- formance in recent memory. Middlebury scored in the first and third periods before the Dutchmen had their best third period of the year, scoring four more goals. Gary Ternush had his second straight three point game, including his thirteenth and fourteenth goals of the year. Duane Joyce had four points for the second game in a ,_ c; a a 'll :,.: - <i >- .0 0 +- 0 .!: Q row and was one of eight Dut- chmen who had single goals. The two most excitillg plays of the game were when Nick Baratoff was launched into the Panther's bench and disap- peared, but, not to be outdone, Keith Robertson scored his first goal of the year on a great in- dividual effort. Keith carne out of the penalty box to r-eceive a pass from Dan Gcmld and pr-oceeded to split tile defense and make a nice move on the Middlebury goaltender- to give the Dutchmen a 6-1lead. The Dutchmen played the University of Buffa}() IJext and after a long bus ride had their problems against t.he Bulls. After the first period the score was 1-1 but could have been more as Nelson Said and Gary Ternush sent the pucll through the Bulls' crease six times on one power play. In the second, however, Union Frl•st1man ( 14) Nick Bar a loll Winning the puck in the corner. got its power play on track and scored four of their goals with the man advantage. The Dut- chmen outscored Buffalo 6-3 with the help of Dan Gould's first goal of the season ami Duane Joyce's three pGints including a goal in his fourth consecutive game. Dan Gould's improvement has earned him more playing time as Charlie Morrison uses him on both the power play and penalty killing units. The Dutchmen then traveled to play Geneseo on Saturday night and after another slow start the Dutchmen found themselves down3-1 early in the second period. Again Union stormed back, this time with five straight goals. In defeating the Ice Knights 6-3, the Out· chmen extended their longest winning streak ()f the season to three with Ron Kinghorn ear- ning all three wins. Kingh()rn was outstanding in the game making spectacuar saves in tile first and third periods. He finished stopping 42 of 44 shots. Duane Joyce has been the real story for the Dutchmen as he had his third four point night in four games and · has had 15 points over that stretch.

Hoops Continues To Win By MARK VAN BUREN The Union College men's basket ball team played three games in the past week, going 2- 1 during that stretch. The Dutchmen lost to Plattsburgh and then beat Rochester and Hobart on consecutive nights to improve their re.cord to 9-5. To begin the three-game stretch, Union hosted Platt- sburgh in the second game of a four-game homestand. Platt- sburgh carne into the game with · a 6-3 mark, losing only to such formidable teams as Potsdam St., Hamilton and Castleton St. Plattsburgh raced out to an early 16-11 lead at the 13:12 mark as Guy Garrow converted a three-point play. The Car- dinals increased this margin to seven points, 20-13, just two minutes later on an 8-foot jumper by former Div. I standout Holman Harley. Plattsburgh retained a slim lead, until a 12-6 spurt with 2: 30 left before halftime, increased the Union deficit to 46-35. This Plattsburgh run was highlighted by two 3-point field goals by Harley and David Campbell. The Dutchmen trailed by the same 11 points at the half, 48-37. The Cardinals started the second half right where they left in the first half. They upped their lead to 6247 with 11: 54 to play in the game. Union was able to close the gap to 77-65 on Torn Beck's 3-pointei' with 5:51 remaining. However,· Platt- sburgh came right back and extended its lead to 86-67. At this point, the Dutchmen scored 14 of the game's next 17 points, to creep within seven points, 88-81, with just 1: 13 left in the contest. Union's run was keyed by four Joe Romer baskets. The Dut- chmen could get no closer, as they were outscored 12-2 the rest of the way, and had to settle for a 110-83 loss. Five players reached double figures for Union, led by Joe Romer (19 points), Neil Winawer (17), Tom Beck (16), Kurt Fox: (15 and 9 rebounds) and Doug Gregory (10). Friday night Rochester in- vaded Memorial Fieldhouse. Union gained the first sub- stantial advantage of the game, 14-10, on Joe Romer's l()...foot jumper, 8 minutes into the contest. An ensuing 7-2 run upped the Dutchmen lead to 21- 12 as Tom Beck hit a 3-point field goal at the 9: 55 mark . Union maintained this 9-point advantage for the rest of the first half and led at halftime, 33- 24. Rochestet· opened the second half by cutting the Union margin to 33-29 on two baskets by Adrian Smalls. The teams traded heops and then at the 15:21 mark:, with the Dutchmen leading 35-31, a bench-clearing brawl broke out. In the melee, Union's leading scorer, KQrt Fox, was the victim of a sucker pWich. As a result of this, he suffered a gash above his right eye that required 12 stitches. Both Fox and Rochester's Neal Augustine were ejected from the game. Union responded with six unanswered points to grab a 41-31lead with 11:29 showing on the clock. The Yellowjackets managed to cut Union's lead in half, 54-49, at the 3:10 mark, when Jonathon Jones made one foul shot and Adrian Smalls converted the offensive rebound on his second shot.· A Doug Gregory lay-up and four straight Joe Romer free throws gave UniDn a 60-49 margin. From here, Union went on to post a 69-56 victory. Joe Romer paced the Dutchmen with 19 points. He was followed by Tom Beck with 17 points and 9 assists and Doug Gregory with 12 points. Union came back the next night to romp over Hobart, 115- 105. The first half began with both teams trading leads of one or two points. Hobart opened up the biggest lead of the first half, 35-31, with 5:54 remaining, on Mike Masino's three-point play. However, for the last 4: 03 of the half, the Dutchmen outscored the Statesmen 17-6, to take a 52- 45 advantage as the teams entered their lockerrooms at the intermission. The Dutcbmen built their lead to 66-55, just 4: 18 into the second period. Union gradually in- creased its advantage, and with 7: 21left in the contest, led 86-69 as Kurt Fox sank two free throws. At the 3:00 mark, the Dutchmen still held a 16-point advantage, 101-85, as Mark Trudeau made good on a pair of free throw attempts. Hobart hit three 3-point baskets in the final minutes, b11t could only dent the Union lead, as the Dutchmen held on for their ninth victory of the season. Neil Winawer led five Union players in double digits with 25 points. Doug ~ Gregory and Kurt Fox con- tributed 20 points each and 8 and 7 rebounds, respectively to the winning cause.
