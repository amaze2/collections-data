Repair Costs Plague Aging Greek Houses By DOUG LANDON Editor-in-Chief At its April 16 meeting, the Board of Trustees approved a measure requiring the per- formance of any improvements needed to make privately owned residences on campus in accordance with National Fire Protective Association Life- Safety Code. The ruling, if unheeded by any of the six fraternities at which it is directed as of September 1, will prohibit the occupancy of the respective houses. The fraternity houses which have been determined by Fire Marshall Barry Watkins to be in need of fire and safety repairs are Psi Upsilon, Alpha Delta Phi, Delta Phi, Phi Delta, Chi Psi, and Sigma Phi. Watkins, along with Director of Security and Safety Clifford Wood and Director of the Physical Plant Jack Hill, has reviewed the findings and presented the officers of each fraternity with ~ \priority form,\ listing the unprovernents necessary for the . opening of the 1983-84 academic year. Foreseeing that some of the fraternities might have dif- ficulty financing the renovations, the Administration has devised a two-option loan plan whereby the Greek organizations may borrow $2 from the College for every $1 they raise on their own, to a loan maximum of $20,000 per house. A floating interest rate of two percent lower than the prime lending rate of Schenectady area banks ( c\urently 10.5 percent) would be charged. Option No. 1 of the loan program would involve transfer of title to the house from the fraternity to the College, and the house would then be leased to the fraternity. Dean of Students J,oseph Mamrnola points out several advantages for the fraternity under this plan. Gifts from alumni and friends would be tax: deductible for the donor, a status unavailable to those presenting gifts to organizations in privately owned dwellings. Fire and liability insurance premiums, though still paid by the fraternities, would be substantially reduced as part of the umbrella policy if the College owns the house, ac- cording to Marnmola. Also, if the buildings are owned and operated as part of the College housing program, they may eventually qualify for property PARENT'S WEEKEND SECTION INSIDE!, tax exempt status, saving the fraternities $4,000 to $6,000 annually . The second option provides for the fraternity to give a first mortgage to the College for the term of the loan. In this case, all three financial advantages would be unavailable. Within the next two weeks, representatives of the frater- nities are expected to meet with Hill, who will assist in the recommendation and con- tacting of contractors as well as offer advice in regard to work that can be performed by members of the organizations. John R. Hauser, Vice President for Finance and Administration, stresses that \the College is not anti- fraternity,\ and is not in- terested in ownership of the houses in question. Noting that transfer of title to the College is only one solution, Hauser ad- ded \our only concern is for the saf~ty of students who reside in those houses.\ He indicated that the loans will be available as soon as applications are submitted by the fraternities and processed by College at- torneys. \We have a model set of documents ready,\ he said.

Daro Beninatia, Technical Director of the Nott . ' Safety . of Alps E~amined By GAYLE ROSENFELD Staff As of late, Union has placed considerable priority on meeting fire regulations in the various buildings on campu~ . This policy was pursued recently in Union's .fraternities and sororities and has now made its way into room 204 of Butterfield Hall. Although Jack Hill, Directo:J; of Campus Operations, commented that he \doesn't consider iL a safety hazard,\ attention is presently being targeted towards this room. 1lle question of safety in the Alps arose when faculty membev Da:ro lleninati Wished to stage a play in this locale becauseof.scheduling problems with the Nott Memorial. Beninati' was told by Barry Watkins, Union's Fire Mar- moved further down the hall from where they reside now by May 2, Also, \plans to make some modiftcatiolls to the room over . the summer'; will be proposed and discussed with the department chairmen who use the Alps, mentione<:l Hill With these ideas, the Alps shoUld reach greater capacity without sacrificing safety standards . Repairs Plague Greeks - shall, that the Alps would nqt be a safe place for a large crowd unac<:.,ustomed to ,its setting. As Hill put it, \we. feel it would present more of a safety hazard to people .not knowledgeable of the room.\ 'lbe awkwardness and incline of the steps could prove disconcerting to the newcomer. One question remains as to why the Alps were being used by large classes when safety regulations were being neglected? Hill stated that there · ''have been .• stricter ~afety regulations_ enacted since the room was built.\ Hill included that Butterfield Hall is a complete masonry building, thus, \the possibility of fire is Continueclfrom page 1 far as we're concerned, they're handling it well. Mammola seems like an hone!)t, straight- forward guy.\ Adding that ''the programs are reasonable,\ Rogers did question the College's motives, saying \they appear to want a little. more control. Why won't they give us back the houses once we've repayed the loan?\ He expects Psi Upsilon brothers to do some of the work on the 45 year old house themselves, and anticipates borrowing.\ a good $10,000.\ All 35 chapters of Psi Upsilon plan to convene at Unjon this August to celebrate the fraternity's 150th anniversary and Rogers said, \it was a . question of necessity for us.\ He also looks forward to increased alumni contributions now that they can be tax deductible. Chris Sullivan, president of Phi Delta Theta, explains that his fraternity is presently persuing a $00,000 loan from its national organization at six percent interest, although the formal application has not yet been submitted. He said that fire safety improvements at the house built about 1919 are estimated at $23,000 and total repairs including insulation and storm windows would cost $35,000;. \It just doesn't seem like. the Administration is being very cooperatlv.e;\ SuHivan said. \Why should you turn over the ownership .of your house for a loan?\ He added that Phi Delta Theta at present does not have $10,000,. but if it does decide to borrow it WOUld choose \option No. 2. The brothers are ''dead~ set against\ turning title over to the College. Sullivan also disapproves· of the loan format, noting that the interest rate from the national organization is 2.5 percent lower than that from Union. \The College, in a sense, is acting as a bank,\ he added, swnming up the loan program as a \raw deal.\ Sullivan remains optimistic, though, stating that \:I'm pretty sure we'll get the morley.\ Tenney Browne, president of Alpha Delta Phi, believes there . exists a \possibility\ of his fraternity turning title over to the College, but stresses., \We don''t have to do that for the fire hazards that need to. be fixed. We want to fix a lot of other things in this old house.'' Browne co:rnmented that the loan plans .comprise a ''very fair\ program. Anticipating no real problems with the fire and safety repairs, Browne added, \We're definitely· going to get them fixed.\ Mammola emphasizes that the College is serious about the required repairs, which include battery-operated safety lighting., outward opening doors, and the removal of walls built around safety exits. \If the cotrections aren't made, (the houses) will not be permitted to open,'' he said, adding that \if there is a fire, liabilities in- crease if you have not followed Safety codes.\ Mammola is confident that the houses can make ~rrangements for the improvements, and wishes to make it clear that ''the College's primary purpose is to insure the safety of the houses, · . and that they are as safe as any house can be by September 1.\ Hill noted that it Tecently came to his attention \that there ate some improvements to be made in\ the Alps to en- sure a larger seating capacity with improved safety precautions. As it stands, full seating capacity .in the Alps ~s 270 while current class size in the room averages 150-160. However, orlly after some large display ~ases in front of the Alps' doors are moved will safety capacity reach 180. These cases will have been very .negligible. '· 1 · Hill stressed that he does not consider ·the 'building a fire hazard; however, he is diligently complying with the strict safety regulations set forth and with Union's following of them as closely as: possib.e The Administration hOpes that the Alps may prove even more useful to fhe campus by providing a large. safe lecture room which Union seems to need.

May 5,. 1983 Administrators Respond By ROBERTA RUBINSTEIN Reactions to Catheyine clinton's resignation wer~ initially of little consequence. However, the statements that Clinton later made public were not received in the same vein. serious charges made by a prominenl member ·Of this community are oftPn nnt tak~n lightly. . . . . . . A number of AdlniJUstrators than What their actual percent .is of the total teaching faculty. (Women faculty repr~sent 11 percent of the total teaching faculty.)\ Kaplan went on to say that, \Of this total null1ber of the teaching faculty who have received the highest merit, twenty percent were women.\ Clinton, her decision and her comments were of a professional and not a personal nature. The Administration and the c~pus commuility can do little more than speculate on this. In regard to the charges that Clinton made, D'Andrea's final remark was that, \A serious examination of the past se:veral years will reveal solid progress on (the concerns of ') \ women. and women faculty me.mbe~s have responded: to Clinton s accusation. Although noone wishes to be drawn into a confrontation,. both D'Andrea and Kaplan have agree(! to make a statement ln regard to the issue · at hand. These Administrators have made clear that they consider Clin- ton's description to be a \misrepresentation . of the facts.\ According to D'Andrea, \Professor Clinton's charges that the Faculty Review Board, the Administration, and even the faculty as :a whole are guilty of indifference, disdain and malignant neglec:t are .entirely without foundation.\ He ex• plained that, ''Pr.ocedures h.ave been developed m appropriate committees, o(ten as a result of initiatives from the Administration, and · with the consent of the faculty to assure fair treatment in all personnel cases.'' He continued to explain that, \These procedures are serving us .well, althm,tgh their existence does not guarantee that problems may not aristl or that human fallibility bas been eliminated. The important point is that we have mechanisms ·for detecting faculty faulty prac- tices and correcting defects if they occur.\ In addition to this, Kaplan commented on the PEW awards that Vice Pnesident D'Andrea recently distributed. These .awards ate specifically designed to help facUlty in. the pursuit of scholarship.· Of the five awards given out, four were given lo women. These Adlninistrators believe that the facts .. speak· for· themselves. Both D;Andrea and Kaplan feel that there is clear evidence that tne women faculty have been treated fairly by the Administration. This is not to suggest, however, that the environment here is perfect for ,women-nor is it perfect for men for that matter. What it. does suggest is that the administration is willing to work with problems as they Loan Defaults Increase arise. · · (CPS) ~ The U. S.. Depart- ment of Education should be \realistic\ by bracing itself for an increasing number of students defaulting on their federal student loan ,payments this year, says a top official with tbe American Council on Education (ACE). 'With this s.ummer's job market likely to be the worst since World War II --campus job placement experts are predicting that even engineers and computer science grads will have a tough time finding work -many grads si.J.n,ply may not have the jobs, and thus the income, to begin repaying their student loans, ACE spokesman Bob Aaron says. The default rate on Guaranteed Student ·Loans has risen steadily since 1978, from 1Q.3 percent to 12.3 percent, according to the Dept. of Education. Dean Kaplan has explained that, \Although there have been some individual problems at the department level, the Administration has always tried to act fairly.\ She ex- pressed her belief that the Administration is supportive of women, commenting that, \over a three-year period, a higher; pe:vcentage of women faculty have received merit In short, D'Andrea expressed the feeUng that ''Professor Clinton's role has been that .of gadfly- and e:very commUnity probably needs one to prick our consciences from time to time- but the careful, unglamorous work of developing policy and pr0cedures, , fair to everyone, has been done by others. He alsQ wished to add that he believed Professor Clinton had misquoted him in her interview last week. CUnton stated, '' ... as (the Vice President} said in the recent issue of the Con~ cordiensis, (he) has \taken care\ of the problem of sexual harassment with the new policy.\ Dr. D'Andrea wished to make clear that this was a misrepresentation on the part of Professor Clinton. Somewhat in the _same vein was a comment niade by one woman faculty member, \Perhaps Catherine Clinton's personal concerns have distorted Q her represen- tation of campus issues and campus policies.\ According to National Direct Student Loans defaults, on the other hand, have been edging downward for the last five years, from a high of 17.7 percent .in 1978 to 15.4 percent last year.· More aggressive collection Anyone interested in ushering for Commencement, please contact Michael Andolina, Office of Student Affairs, Extension 6061. • Singles Lottery: Senior Lottery: Junior Lottery: HOUSING LOTTERY INFORMATION May 11,6:30p.m. Stage II May 17,6:30.p.m. Stage II May 24, 6.:30p.m. Stage II rD's, lottery cards and all roommates are needed when a room-suite is selected, · · ' THE SINGLES LOTTERY The seniorwith the,lowest lottery number (no.

But as the job market for college grads deteriorates this year, default rates . could shoot up .again, Aaron advises. ''Is it realistic to expect a student with $10;000 worth of debt not to .default in today's job market?\ he asks. ''After all, with the kinds of jobs and salaries available, many students will be lucky just to keep their heads above water.'' Even searching for a job could take months, he points out, \and when you're starting a career there are certain start- up costs .:.moving expenses, clothing and other expenses- that have to come before repaying a loan.\ But the number of grads filing for protection under bankruptcy laws could increase if the economy doesn't improve, says ACE policy analyst Elaine El- Khawas. Right now the number of grads who escape repaying their loans by declaring bankruptcy is around one percent, El-Khawas says. \Most of those are genuine hardship cases,\ she notes. Some are more desperate than other$. In December, a federal court turned down a former Wright State University student who wanted to repay the school just one percent of the amount she still owed on her loan. After 36 months, she would have paid back a total of $14.82: The court decided the former student, who is now a teacher who co-owns some real estate in Ohio, hadn't shown \good faith\ when she proposed: repaying so little. In what is perhaps a more typical case, however, a California federal court recently relieved a former San Diego State student of her loan obligation because the woman's nervous disabilities and hearing l()sses have prevented her from holding a job for long. Students can't apply for bankruptcy protection until five or more years after the originally become due, Department of Education spokesman Duncan Helmrich points out. \We're not really making any projections on. whether the job market will raise the number of defaults,\ Helmrich says. Even with the predicted tight job market, \they'll still have nine months to find jobs before loan repayments have to start.\ Moreover, \most defaulters have jobs and just have a ·'the government-gets-paid-last attitude;\ claims Virginia Powell, a U. S. attorney in Philadelphia who has gone after a number of loan deadbeats there. U. S. attorneys in Philadelphia, Cincinnati and Los Angeles have gone as .far as towing away the cars of student loan defaulters. And the Education Depart- ment last fall installed a new computer to help track down the estimated one million former students who still owe back loan payments. Such efforts won't unfairly punish \real hardship cases,\ Powell says, \as long as they · keep in touch with the relevant agency and work out some kind of deferment plan.\ Dr. Joseph Sisco ls a leading e?'pert on the Middle East. ln 1973, as principal advisor to Secretary of State Henry Kissinger,. he participated in negotiations ending hostilities to the Yom Kippur war. And in 1970 he was instrumental in warOing off the Syrian 'invasion of Jordan and in that year personaily negotiated the Egyptian-Israeli Cease Fire ending the \war of attrition.\ As a specialist on the Middle East, who rose to become Under secretary for Political Affairs, the number three post in the State Department ahd the top career post in the Ser· vice, he often negotiated directly with Gamal Nasser, Anwar Sadat, Go.lda Meir, Moshe Dayan, Abba Eban, Yitzhak Rabin, and King Hussein.

Reported cases of AIDS include persons with Kaposi's sarcoma who are under age 60 years and- or persons with life threatening opportunisti~ infections with no known underlying cause for inunune deficiency. Over 450 persons have died from AIDS, and the case fatality rate ex- ceeds 60 percent for eases first over one year previously.

A survey to assess current and future usage of the College's computers is presently being distributed amongst Union faculty and students. The survey is the work of the Academic Affairs Council's Sub-Council on the Academic Cllrricular Use of Computing Equipment and Services. The survey has three major purposes. Firstly it conducts an inventory of current computer usage and indicates the ways in which the computers. are em- ployed. Secondly, it examines the projected e:s;pansion of current types of usage. And thirdly, lt forecasts what new directions use of the computer curriculum could or should take. The Sub-Council hopes that there will be a maximum participation with the survey. This is a chance for all students and faculty members to voice their opinions as to what direction the use of computers should take and to evaluate the current sitaation. Faculty surv~ys are being distributed and students surveys can be obtained .at the Student Activities desk or in the output room ·Of the Computer Center.

BENSON The ''Great Debate\ between G. Gordon Liddy and Timothy Leary was not quite What many expected. Charles T:idmarch,. professor .of Political Scien~e who moderated the debate 1s among those who were discontented. Professor Tid- march said that at first he thought the debate would .be an \intellectual circus.\ However, he ended up being \disap- pointed in the quality of the exchanges between the two people. When Professor Tidmarch was asked to moderate the debate, he was interested in the idea of being able to ask questions of the two speakers. He felt that in the hour-and-a- half allotted for the debate he could draw the two to speak on the i\Ssues. However, when Leary and Liddy arrived, they made it clear that the debate would begin with their planned opening statements about how they first met and on the issue of debate--\The State vs. The Rights of the Individual.\ The preliminary .points lasted fifty minutes, which left Professor Tidmarch with forty minutes in which to ask only six of his twenty questions .. Both Liddy and Leary befieved they were doing something. educational . for the audience. Professor Tidmarch thought, however, they did not actually ·Confront each other on issues and did not convey their opposing theories well to the audience. Leary even admitted before the debate that he was intimidated by Liddy and did not enjoy debating. Points made by Leary-such as the need for more mutual respect between men and women--on the question of pornography left little room for Liddy to counter. Liddy com- mented that the Tet offensive in Vietnam was a political. fiasco for the Viet-Cong. Leary should have refuted ·this remark, Professor T~dmarch said. \l assumed they would really go after each other,\ he added. \We were taken.'·' Professor Tidmarch stated that he respected Leary and Li-ddy for theil' \survivor's instinct,\ but disapproves of what each has done. ''They · are,\ he said, \both ethical dwarfs.\ Timothy Leary and G. Gordon Leary have been putting on the show, \The Great Debate,\ for over a year and a half, said Professor Tidmarcb. It is time they stopped. United Jewish Appeal During. the next two weeks, the United Jewish Appeal will be running its educational and financial campaign. UJA sponsored the Jewish Awareness Week at the beginning of the term and is now turning its efforts to its goal of helping Jews throughout the world. Presently th~ agency provides health, welfare, and rehabilitation services for the needy, aged, handicapped, and destitute Jews in 25 countries throughout the world, in places such as Russia, Eastern Europe, , South Africa, Asia, North . Africa, Israel, and the United States. Approximately half . of the funds raised by UJA is allocated to Israel and is disbursed there by the United Israel Appeal (UIA). The UIA is engaged in helping new immigrants receive transportation to Israel and then helps in absorption. Funds are also spent on establishing new rural set- tlements throughout Israel (with the exception of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip). The ~genc_y also provides and fmances various health ser- vices, educational programs, and housing programs. These .funds to Israel are essential since the defense needs are necessarily such a large part of the Israeli government's budget. There is not much left over for social needs and UJA fills the financial gap for these essential social programs. It should be noted that UJA funds are never used for political or military purposes, rather they provide for human needs. On a worldwide basis, UJA aids Jewish immigrants resettling in countries other than Israel, helps support destitute Russian Jews, and engages in various social programs throughout countries with Jewish populations. Throughout our 4i000-year history, it has always been an obligation and commitment (a mitzvah) to care and to provide for those less fortunate than ourselves. With this in mind, the United Jewish Appeal will be asking for donations to help finance its worthwhile programs. Over the next two weeks, there will be solicitors on campus explaining the needs and commitments of the United Jewish Appeal and we ask your moral and financial support in helping Jews around the world.

Q, Dr. T.imothy Leary ''Freedom of the 1 nclividual\ G. Gordon Liddy 'The PoweroftheState\ ''The Great Debate'': L.eary 0 - Liddy 0 :By MARCY BURSTINER News Editor Last Thursday, 350 people carne to Memorial Chapel to see \The Great Debate.\ G. Gordon Liddy, who masterminded Watergate~ was to fight tooth and nail against the leader of the counsciousness movement of the '60s, Timothy Leary. The topic of the debate was \the Power of the State v. Freedom of the IndividuaL\ Even before Thursday the debate piqued the interest of the chronically apathetic Union campus. One student commented that it was to be a \fight . between the fascist and the freak.\ Unfortunately the debate did not tum out to be a struggle between two bitter enemies. Another student put, \It was entertaining, yet shallow because it was predictable. They didn't fool me for one second.\ The two have debated 18 times prior to coming to Union, even so, when they finished their debate, there was a tremendous round of applause from the audience. Liddy and Leary first met 18 years ago when Liddy was \a young ambitious district at- torney.\ He conducted a drug raid on the mansion in which Leary was residing with his . wife and a group of researchers studying \the use of light and sound in its raw energetic at>. stract form.\ Liddy arrested him for possession of marijuana; a charge Leary refuted. Since then, the two men have gone their separate ways. Liddy served on former President NiXon's special investigative unit known as the \Plumbers directed the Watergate break- in, and subsequently spent four and a half years in prison for his activities. Leary, on the other .hand, became known as the \High Priest\ of the 1960's, became director of the Psychedelic Research Project at Harvard University, and coined the phrase \turn on, tune in, and drop out.\ Liddy wearing a black leather jacket, leather boots, and faded denim jeans, began the _debate by commenting that \in- dividualists state that the only reality is the individual\ He went on to say that the collec- tivist position, especially the Marxist is equally extreme. \Society is determined not by individual consciousness, but by total production.\ .He believes that \man has a dual nature . You will .realize you cannot . achieve your dUf.ll- your in· dividual existential ends by yourselves You must cooperate with others.\ He then discussed the distinct difference between law and morality. He claimed that people often group the two together even though they are \intrinsically \different.\ Morality, he explained, springs from the individualistic side of nature, whereas law is derived from the .societal side. \Law is an order of society,\ he continued, \which is en- forceable, which gives a claim upon certain behavior on the part of others ... The individual good is just the achievement of the individual's . human existential ends ... The common good transcends the individual good. It is on that foundation that I argue the position having to do with power of the State,\ he declared. Leary countered Liddy's speech by commenting, \who can knock words like the common good? •. But that's not what we're talking about- we're tallting about tights of in- dividuals over power of the State.\ When our founding fathers had signed the Declaration of Independence, th~ aim of the state they were creating was to support and to produce life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, Leary said. At this point, Leary paused, stepped over to the edge of the stage, smiled and repeated, \The pursuit of happiness- how about that?\ \The State has no power whatsoever,\ he stressed, \except such power as we free individuals loan it.\ Freedom he said is one aspect of in~ dividuality. He emphasized, howe.ver, \I am not in any way suggesting anarchy.\ Rules and regulations are all necessary. You can only be an individual if you respect the rights of other individuals. He then noted · that i'depression and pessimism is growing in this country. We've gone back to Cold War mania depression. During World War II there was little or no political dissent;. everyone volunteered. At the end of the war, however, something happened. -Nagasaki and Hiroshima .. \We knew then that we could never again have a World War.\ American used to be a symbol of youthfulness, utopian thinking, romance, and great heroes, Leary said. For 200 years the world has looked up to America as a place to grow- where individuality and tolerance flourished. The young .. people of today, he pointed out, don't see this anymore when they look at America. He said he would like to go back to the 60's attitude of turn-on, tune in, and drop out. \Drop out is a basic American tradition,\ he remarked. He claimed that it only signified that an individual does not conform to the demands of s<>ciety. Addressing the audience. he said, \Yoa out there have the country in your hands ... You don't realize your strength.\ He advised that everyone strive to protect and to cherish America ideals of individuality. ·Liddy rebutted Leary~s statements by commenting that, \Mr: Leary's remarks were cheap.\ He pointed out that the military \serves a basic human need.'' Without the militqry, pursuit of happiness would be futile. Leary then countered, \I am not. against the military.'' He feels, -'however, that ''the defense.of our country is much too important to turn over to the armed forces.\ He described the military as \men drilled in,- trained in, and sworn to protect - a system of regressive democracy.\ Charles Tidmarch, professor of political science, serving as moderator, asked whether- the mil!tary dr-aft represents slavery or whether it is merely a minimal obligation of the citizen. Liddy conceded that \conscription amounts to in~ voluntary servitude.\ However, he explained, since the State transposes individual good, service to the country con- stitutes a minimal obligation. \No way you can hope to oppose the will of the Soviet Union with the kind of voluntary service we now have.\ Leary, of course, disagreed with this notion and stated that if survival of the nation were at stake, conscription would not be necessary. ''Reality is the issue here,\ he went on. If the Reagan Administration tries to enforce the draft now to protect the interests of the Bectel Industry inSaudia Arabia, uyou better believe there will be resistence to the draft.\ Professor Tidmarch then asked under what circumstance may the government regulate sexual behavior such as prostitution or hOmosexuality. Leary claimed that \when a government thinks it can regulate the most personal aspect of our lives, our serual behavior- I mean, give me a break.'' In theory, Liddy conceded. Continued on page 13

to OONOORDIENSfS 1 May 5 .. 1983 Page 7 p - ::::: FEATURES Colloquia on Homosexuality By FEATURES STAFF For the next two weeks, the Union College Departments of .Classics,. History, Philosophy, and Sociology, along with the International Education Foundation are presenting two colloquia on homosexuality. Many departments are involved in the two colloquia becall$e issue.s concerning homosexuality are taught in a number of departments. For inStance, many of the writings used in Classics Courses deal with homosexuality. There was a time in history where homosexuality was .a sexual preference among members Qf the upper class. The moral ,and philosophical implications -of homosexuality are also studied in Philosophy courses. In ad- dition, homosexual issues are of important. concern in politics and sociology. It is a topic of broad based interest. Due to the number of . ~ . departments involved, it is important that professors have a clear understanding of homosexuality, and of what .they may be teaching, It is the purpose of the seminars to make students more· aware of the large homose:ll:ual com- munity across the nation. In addition,. it is ~loped that . students at Union who are homosexual will feel that they are not neglected, and are trying to. be better understood. According to Prof-essor Sorum, any student that plans to be a doctor, lawyer, or other profession inwhicll contact with people is involved, should at- tend the two colloquia because ev.entually they will come into contact with homosexuals during their careers. Concerning the changes in attitudes concerning homosexuality among a number of diSciplines, the discussion -of these issues is a very timely event, As an example of how opinions are - The Internal Education Foundation And The :pepartments of Classics, History, Philosophy, and Sociology Of , UNION COLLEGE Are Pleased To Anno~nce Two Colloquia On HOMOSEX UALlTY Homosexuality: Historical Perspectives MAYS -Lillian Faderman, Californ:ia State, Fresno-- Lesbia-n Images in Turn of the Century America--S p.m., SS016 . .

All across the nation issues considering homosexuals in housing, em- ployment, and privacy are being discussed. Only within the last few years being f,l· homosexual has stopped being a qrime, and is now regarded as being a matter of choice. Homosexuality is an issue that will be recurring in literature and politics and it is hoped that this series being developed by a number of different depart- ments here will better equip both £aculty and students to deal with issues with a better understanding.

By .J. L. KOSHEL Staff In a new book called Real World 101, go-getters James Calno and Jeff Salzman reveal the tactics that made them really rich- and even happy. Calno and Salzman, ages 25 and 28 respectively, appear to be experts on techniques for professional advancement. Just when you thought Dale Car- negie and Dr. Norman Vincent Peale had explained everything from how to be assertive to how to hurdle life's obstacles, comes Real World 101. Chock full of advice for those embarking on their first career, Real World 101 attempts to be preparatory in ways that the authors feel college is not. Training in professionalism is what Real World 101 claims to offer;Unless one has learned on a summer job or an internship how to think, act, and perform like a professional, and how to get credibility from professionals, Real World 101 may serve a purpose. Like'all books of this nature, however, Real World 101 is purposely written to be inspirational and to instill a positive feeling in the reader, making him or her feel the book was wortth the $8.00. Among the countless number of pointers that Real World 101 has to offer, there is probably something beneficial for every college graduate and if one is totally confused about how they should act in the \real world\ this book can certainly be a guide. But the old saying still remains: \Some of us got it; some of us... \

·. I, Page 8 OONOORJ)IENSlS:; May 5, 198S <llll11fllrbirnsis --~---Pourukc/ al (Inion Coller,e 1877~·~-~-- Leery of Debate Did we expect too much? Probably so. Isolated in a small upstate New York city, we couldn't wait to listen to such big-tim.ers as Gordon Liddy and Tjmothy Leary debate. The reality is, however, that tne speakers have been conducting similar, if not identical, debates around the country for some time, and their .polish and enthusiasm are beginning to fade. Liddy and Leary represent overworked cliches of decades past, and no longer inspire crowds as they probably did in their heydays. That is the price one must pay for ~a.iling to update one's image as times change. Typical issues were discussed, and anyone with knowledge of the opposing positions prior to last Thursday was at best motivated to slip out of the Chapel during intermission. Opinions were kept mellow, and the \debators'' seemed to agree more often than not. probably because they are tired Of arguing. The vicious acoustics o£. Memorial Chapel did not help matters any. It appeared that even Dr. Leary could not hear most of the conversation. The next time we have prominent politicos or social pioneers scheduled to descend on the campus, assess the situation beforehand. By all m·eans attend the lectures, but give some thought to whether a pillow would be more useful than that notepad. Good Luck Greeks Once again the problem of finances is plaguing our fraternities. Six houses face the possibility of finding their doors barred in September if costly fire. and safety repairs are not made. The Administration has made the decree, but appears to be backing its resolution with something solid: cash. The mandatory repairs cost up to $25,000 per house. and it appears the Administration realizes that demanding the fraternities to finance these improvements alone over a four month period is unrealistic. But is the loan program bait for a catch of the day known as a \tighter grip?\ Administrators assure us that this is not the case, though some brothers of the target houses remain skeptical. Yet, who can argue with anyone who believes fire safety in student residences is important? We can only hope the intentions of both · factions are honorable, a.nd that all six fraternities continue to thrive. Most of the .presidents appear confident that they will. Hi Mom & Dad Dorm vacuum cleaners have been running all week. Area dry cleaners have been swamped with business. Flowers bloom in the garden and new grass pushes its way through the carefully raked son. WELCOME P .ARENTS! The festivities planned for this weekend are the cuimination of many late nights of hard work on the part of a very dlligent committee. Events condUcive to the integrated enjoyment of students and their parents have been planned with enthusiasm and pride. For the first time, this year parents will have the opportunity to attend special Saturday afternoon classes held by some of our most dedicated faculty. This is a key eKample with which to substantiate the claim that Union professors really do care. We give yo11 a .few special social treats. · The Moimtebanks play, concert band and lecture by · renowned columnist Jack Anderson should prove to be culturally and intellectually stimulating. Various athletic events are interspers·ed throughout Saturday and Sunday, and will hopefully instill some school spirit. Top. off the days with a Dutchmen's Night dinner, a calorie-laden Late Night Bite, and the weekend movie, \My Favorite Year.\ Attend the receptions, performances, worship sessions and meals. If life really does exist in Schenectady, it is during this weekend. Keep :ln mind, parents, that it's all for you. This place won't look the same for another year. Enjoy it. We're glad you're here. .LETTERS Dutchman's Night A ~ucc.ess To the Editor: The manager of the Dutch Hollow Pub asked us to dinner, and we came. The clear broth was light; the vegetables were just right; the dessert was aU right. As I'd just returned from a Middle States Commission accreditation v.isit to Albright College in Reading, Pa., I was in the mood to evaluate Union, too. The mood was nice for a Saturday night, and th~ st11dents, too, seemed all bright. Thanks, Gary Salemo. My 11· year-old son needs to practice his composition, so I'll ask him to write another Jetter.

It gave us great satisfaction to see that somebody noticed the efforts that made 100 watts a reality. You are to be commended. There were, however, a few minor errors which must be pointed out, if only to set the record straight. First and foremost, the Dean of Students has not \offered. the station $3,300 from the college budget.'' To be exact, there is a 100 watts fund set up by Dean Kellet in 1979 which still exists and will. be utilized by the station. Dean Mammola has offered his full assistance .oin obtaining any necessary funds, Commentary: By A. J.

Page 8 CONOORDIENSIS, May 5, 1983 <lln11fllrbirnsis Fourokd at limon (oll~t 1877 ----~------- ------------ Leery of Debate Did we expect too much? Probably so. Isolated in a small upstate New York city, we couldn't wait to listen to such big-timers as Gordon Liddy and Timothy Leary debate. The reality is, however, that the speakers have been conducting similar, if not identical, debates around the country for some time, and their polish and enthusiasm are beginning to fade. Liddy and Leary represent overworked cliches of decades past, and no longer inspire crowds as they probably did in their heydays. That is the price one must pay for failing to update one's image as times change. Typical issues were discussed, and anyone with knowledge of the opposing positions prior to last Thursday was at best motivated to slip out of the Chapel during intermission. Opinions were kept mellow, and the \debators\ seemed to agree more often than not. probably because they are tired of arguing. The vicious acoustics of Memorial Chapel did not help matters any. It appeared that even Dr. Leary could not hear most of the conversation. The next time we have prominent politicos or social pioneers scheduled to descend on the campus, assess the situation beforehand. By all means attend the lectures, but give some thought to whether a pillow would be more useful than that notepad. Good Luck Greeks Once again the problem of finances is plaguing our fraternities. Six houses face the possibility of finding their doors barred in Septern ber if costly fire and safety repairs are not made. The Administration has made the decree, but appears to be backing its resolution with something solid: cash. The mandatory repairs cost up to $25,000 per house, and it appears the Administration realizes that demanding the fraternities to finance these improvements alone over a four month period is unrealistic. But is the loan program bait for a catch of the day known as a \tighter grip?\ Administrators assure us that this is not the case, though some brothers of the target houses remain skeptical. Yet, who can argue with anyone who believes fire safety in student residences is important? We can only hope the intentions of both factions are honorable, and that all six fraternities continue to thrive. Most of the presidents appear confident that they will. Hi Mom & Dad Dorm vacuum cleaners have been running all week. Area dry cleaners have been swamped With business. Flowers bloom in the garden and new grass pushes its way through the carefully raked soil. WELCOME PARENTS! The festivities planned for this weekend are the culmination of many late nights of hard work on the part of a very diligent committee. Events conducive to the integrated enjoyment of students and their parents have been planned with enthusiasm and pride. For the first time, this year parents will have the opportunity to attend special Saturday afternoon classes held by some of our most dedicated faculty. This is a key example with which to substantiate the claim that Union professors really do care. We give you a few special social treats. The Moi:mtebi:mks play, concert band and lecture by renowned columnist Jack Anderson should prove to be culturally and intellectually stimulating. Various athletic events are interspersed throughout Saturday and Sunday, and will hopefully instill some school spirit. Top off the days with a Dutchmen's Night dinner, a calorie-laden Late Night Bite, and the weekend movie, \My Favorite Year.\ Attend the receptions, performances, worship sessions and meals. If life really does exist in Schenectady, it is during this weekend. Keep in mind, parents, that it's all for you. This place won't look the same for another year. Enjoy it. We're glad you're here. .LETTERS Dutchman's Night A Success To the Editor: The manager of the Dutch Hollow Pub asked us to dinner, and we came. The clear breth was light; the vegetables were just right; the dessert was all right. As I'd just returned from a Middle States Conunission accreditation visit to Albright College in Reading, Pa., I was in the mood to evaluate Union, too. The mood was nice for a Saturday night, and the students, ti:JO, seemed all bright. Thanks, Gary Salerno. My 11 ~ year-old son needs to practice his composition, so I'll ask him to write another .letter. Sincerely, Jean Pelletiere Library Director To the Editor: Last weekend I went to a free Dinner at the pub (I didn't I admit have high e~pectations) and found it quite good. I had the fruit cup veal parmasian and apple pie all superb and there was no bad after taste Danilo Pelletiere WRUC Reacts to ''Surge'' To the Editor: Thank you for giving the radio station excellent exposure in your front page article and editorial last week. It gave us great satisfaction to see that somebody noticed the efforts that made 100 watts a reality. You are to be commended. There were, however, a few minor errors which must be pointed out, if only to set the record straight. First and foremost, the Dean of Students has not \offered the station $3,300 from the college budget.\ To be exact, there is a 100 watts fund set up by Dean Kellet in 1979 which still exists and will be utilized by the station. Dean Mammola has offered his full assistance in obtaining any necessary funds, Commentary: By A. J.

By JON TITUS Listening to Robe~:t S. Kumsle speak here last week was a rare opportunity to hear the silent and oppressed black majority of South Africa express .its pain and sorrow. Black Africans ha:ve shown courage in pursuing their freedom and thus .ha:ve won many allies in America~ Nonetheless, American in- vestment buttresses the apartheid system of South Africa. Several hi.Uldred U. S . corporations currently sup- plying critical capital, sophisticated technology, and vital equipment to .South Africa for profits. . Twenty-six million people live in South Africa. Only four million (the whites) are citizens. Three million coloureds (mixed race) and Indians (Asians} fall into a non- citizen category. The nineteen million Africans are considered outright foreigners. The total U.S. investment in South Africa is over $6 billion. Amerfc~l is the largest foreign investor in South Africa after Great Britain. However, ·our share of foreign investment in South Africa has been steadily increasing. Oil is the only resource that South Africa must totally im- port. Because of an OPEC oil embargo against South Africa, U.S. oil companies supply oil to South Africa. Coal, however, is abundant in South Africa and U. S. corporations are helping South Africa expand its coal-to- oil facilities to increase energy independence. Apartheid makes South African coal mining costs extremely cheap at $4-5 per ton compared to $20 per ton in America. South Africa has bought mines in America, Closed the mmes, putting miners out of work and thereby increasing their coal sales to Anlerica. Computers make it possible for five million whitesto control 22 million non-whites. U.S. computer companies, prin- cipley IBM, control 70 percent of the South African Computer market. IBM sells computerstto South Africa's Department of Defense, Department of Prisons, and Atomic Energy Board. · American corporatjons dominate the transportation sector of the South African economy. General Motors has been established as a keypoint industry by South Africa. GM documents indicate the iden- tical interests between U.S. corporations and the South African government. GM. would fully cooperate with South African troops in the event of civil unrest.· GM has proudly stated that their South African plants can be converted to war production. U.S. aircraft companies have supplied South Africa with planes which have been converted into military use. Bank loans from U.S. banks, especially Citibank, . have allowed the South African government to bankroll apartheld. Several U.S. corporations are involved in direct nuclear collaborations with South Afiica, supplying needed assistance and technology. Many U.S. corporations are not even paying their black employees the South African absolute poverty wage. The average monthly wage for :black miners is $175 and for white miners is $1,056. Black Africans make up 72 percent of the population but are forced to live on 13 percent of the land. $82 is expended per capita year for the education of blacks, whereas $833 is expended per capita for whites. The infant mortality rate for blacks is about 200 per lOOOandfor whites is 12 per 1000. These few statistics illustrate the poverty and oppression suffered by South African blacks. Fur- thermore, the South African Constitution legitimizes this oppression by giving blacks absolutely no rights and allows the police authority over blacks. Things have not gotten better in South Africa. Indeed since the Sharpesville Massacre in which 69 Africans were gunned down, repression has increased. The apartheid regime has tightened its pass laws and other means of .control while using increased foreign investments to build up white police and military .~ protection. The presence of the U. S. corporations and increased investment bas not facilitated social change, but has allowed the growth of the repressive /apparatus of the apartheid state. While some think that divestment will damage the economic status of blacks, it will more likely send a message to the South African govern- ment to begin to increase rights to blacks and thereby hopefully avert the massive bloodshed which is otherwise inevitable. The total endowment of Union College is$50million, 80 percent of the endowment is invested under contract by the Fiduciary Trust Company. The other 20 percent is· invested in trust funds of other banks, usually because the donator set up certain stipulations upon the money. The Union College Finance Board established guidelines for investment, such as no high risk investments, a minimum income of 5;5 percent and how the money is to be divided up between stocks and mortgages. Fiduciary handles in• vestmen~s for organizations which have divested from South Africa and will do this with the Union College endowment under a directive from our Finance Board. Approximately 16 percent or 8 million dollars of Uniori College's endowment is invested in eorporations which invest in South Africa. This is an investment in racism. Wall Street financial finns have stated that divestment can be . conducted without financial loss. Some investors, such as the State of Connecticut, have actually increased their profits through divestment. Six states, many cities (in- cluding New York City), and universities, churches, and pension funds. too munerous to name have divested from South Africa. Union College should be among these. · The Union College en- dowment is. invested in South Africa through the following corporations: The figures are the dollar amounts of the Union en- dowment invested in that corporation: Qeneral Motors. (1,446,000), Kodak (656,000), Coca-Cola (256,000), Abbot Laboratories (234,000), Johnson and Johnson (389,000), Merck (666,000), IBM (1,606,000), Hewlett-Packard (449,000), Dow Chemical (319,000), General Electric (386,000), Caterpillar (734,000), Dupont (550,000), Ford (110,000), Xerox (499,000), John Deere (50,000), Dun & Brad- street (6,000) for a total of $8,256,000. The other $42 million is invested in other ways. To reiterate, Union College can divest at no financial loss and perhaps even at a profit. Let's end the investment in racism.

Things have not gotten better in South Africa. Indeed since the Sharpesville Massacre in which 69 Africans were gunned down, repression has increased. The apartheid regime has tightened its pass laws and other means of control while using increased foreign investments to build up white police and military protection. The presence of the U. S. corporations and increased investment has not facilitated social change, but has allowed the growth of the repressive , apparatus of the apartheid > state. While some think that divestment will damage the economic status of blacks, it will more likely send a message to the South Mrican govern- ment to begin to increase rights to blacks and thereby hopefully avert the massive bloodshed which is otherwise inevitable. The total endowment of Union College is $50 million, 80 percent of the endowment is invested l:lllder contract by the Fiduciary Trust Company. The other 20 percent is invested in trust funds of other banks, usually because the donator set up certain stipulations upon the money. The Union College Finance Board established guidelines for investment, such as no high risk investments, a minimum income of 5.5 percent and how the money is to be divided up between stocks and mortgages. Fiduciary handles in- vestments for organizations which have divested from South Africa and will do this with the Union College endowment under a directive from our Finance Board. Approximately 16 percent or 8 million dollars of Union College's endowment is invested in corporations which invest in South Africa. This is an investment in racism. Wall Street financial firms have stated that divestment can be conducted witllout financial loss. Some investors, such as the State of Connecticut, have actually increased their profits through divestment. Six states, many cities (in- cluding New York City), and universities, churches, and pension funds too munerous to name have divested from South Africa. Union College should be among these. The Union College en- dowment is invested in South Africa through the following corporations: The figures are the dollar amounts of the Union en- dowment invested in that corporation: General Motors (1,446,000), Kodak (656,000), Coca-Cola (256,000), Abbot Laboratories (234,000), Johnson and Johnson (389,000), Merck (666,000), IBM (1,606,000), Hewlett-Packard ( 449,000), Dow Chemical (319,000), General Electric (386,000), Caterpillar (734,000), Dupont (550,000), Ford (110,000), Xerox (499,000), John Deere (50,000), Dun & Brad- street (6,000) for a total of $8,256,000. The other $42 million is invested in other ways. To reiterate, Union College can divest at no financial loss and perhaps even at a profit. Let's end the investment in racism.

Page 10 OONCORDIENSIS, May 5, 1983 .. THE ARTS Journey: Business As Usual By LARRY LIEBERMAN Although I frequently com- mission features for this page, rarely do I get a chance to sit down and write. For those of you who know me, Journey will seem like an unlikely group to begin with, but please don't sell me (or therri) short. Like it or not, Journey has become America's most loved rock 'n; roll band-a record company president's dream. No other contemporary band enjoys the success on both youth oriented and adult contemporary radio that Journey does. Maybe that means that they're boring enough to appeal to the age groups that don't better or don't care, or maybe it's just good business. The packaging and marketing behind Journey is nothing less than perfect, and the folks at Columbia Records should be congratulated. If there were any doubts before the release of the group's previous album, ESCAPE, their critics are certainly qUiet now as sales of that albmn approach the 6 million mark. The success of ESCAPE allowed Journey to complete a coast to coast sell out tour of arenas, complete with corporate sponsors paying undisclosed millions for the privilege of having their product associated with the group. It has become quite an ac- complishment to sell out arenas in 1983. Journey is one of only a handful of groups which has succeeded in luring kids out of arcades and into concert halls. Sparse crowds have been plaguing promoters for some time now, and there does seem to be some truth to the theory that kids would rath~r zap away at Defender than sit through a show, Some time ago an in- novative video game designer realized this and created ESCAPE, the best selling video game in which the player must safely escort the members of Journey to their limousine, dodging photographers and autograph seeking fans. Recognizing their continuing accomplishments, we must- believe that· F_RONTIERS, Journey's latest album and tenth for Columbia Records, will be a monumental success, adding even more merit to the group's superstar status.

Friday, May 6 - 8:30 p.m. · Cabaret Rm. Journey At The Egg-.- Nightingale, the new musical by Charles Strouse, will open at the Egg in Albany May 13, in an original production by the resident company of t~e Empire State lnstitute for the Performing Arts. Best known as the composer of music for Broadway hits- including Golden Soy_,_ Applause, and the award winners Bye, Bye, Birdie and Annie--Charles Strouse has moved in somewhat of a new direction with Nightingale. He wrote both the music and the lyrics for the new work, which is based ol1 Hans Christian Andersen's classic tale_ \The Emperor's Nightingale.'' There is very little spoken dialogue and, as ESIPA's music director George Harris describes it, the seore departs from . ''the Broadway music idiom\ wit]l the story told throughout in musical terms. Directed by Joseph Balfior, the new production is designed in a \chinoiserie\ style, evoking an aura of ancient China rather than a realistic Chinese period. Costumes are designed by Patricia von Brandenstein, scenery by Stuart . Wurtzei, choreography by Shela Xore&os, and lighting by Ed Effron. _ · A storyteller (Joel Aroeste) relates the tale, set in long-ago China, of an Emperor {Gary 0. Aldrich) who hears of a drab little grey bird whose glorious singing brings happiness to all who hear it. The nightingale (Betsy Normile) is captured and taken to the palace, where she agrees to sing for the em- peror . alone. Without freedom, though, the nightingale languishes and is .replaced by a mechanical bird (Heather Bee 'Chest!lut), whose repetitious song soon annoys everyone. The nightingale eventually returns of her own free. will tQ sing a duelling duet with Death ( Caren McGee-Russell), who has come to take the Emperor. Romance blossoms between the Emperor - and a poor maid (Jeanne Vigliante) and in the end, un- selfish love and artistic freedom triumph. · Following a preview per- for~ance Friday, May-13, at 10 . a.m., Nightingale will open with a matinee Sunday, May 15 at 2 p.m. There will be morning performances at 10 a.m. Monday and Wednesday through Friday, May 16 and 18 through 20. · Evening per- formances are scheduled at 8 p.m. Friday and Saturday, May 20 and 21. An additional matinee has been scheduled at 2 p.m. Saturday, May 21. The Saturday evening per- formance, May 21, will be in· terpreted for the hearing- impaired.

On the Tuesday before last the Court Gestures .put on their first perfonnance. The shOw 'Yas met with an overwhelmmg response and tickets were gone by noon that day. The free tickets and beer may have been a motivator for some but after seeing the show I'm sure everyone would agree that 'it was well worth the price of a cabaret ticket. The performers used. no script; the. only segments preplanned were partic.ular skits, anci even those took off in any direction the actors felt would be humorous. The \gestures\ did spoof~ on fraternity parties, soap operas, Fort Lauderdale, the New York Times, 1940's movies, and television snows such as Password and Star Trek. The show was hilarious. The P,erformers' high energy level and quick ability to anticipate each others' actions cohveyed a feeling of unity and made the comeqy show a success. Two particularly funny routines made use of lip sync and freezes. In lip sine two actors would be on stage while two off stage would provide the dialogue. The actors on stage would perform any routine (no matter. how ridiculous) that went along_ with what was spoken by the off stage actors. The \freeze\ technique is fast- paced, creative ·and very humorous. Two or more actors begin a skit and when one of the others gets an idea he yells 'freeze' and the action stops. This actor runs on stage, taps the person who he is replacing and then begins the skit again 'in a totally different direction. The talent of these performers was made evident by their quick ability to pick up on a new idea every few seconds and carry it off successfully. These innovative per- formances have brought a new type of comedy to Union which .is fast•paced and spontaneous. The next scheduled per& formance of the Court Gestures ·is on May to in the Cabaret Room. The cast includes Scott Bloom., Anna Tucker, Michael Zevlon, Marcie Wilder, Craig .Shalmi, Rudy Green~ C.J. ' Zaruba and Chris Hand in charge of writing and lighting, and Bonnie Rosenberg as stage manager. Tickets can be picked up at Student Activities. This is one show not to miss. \Court Gestures\ Anna Tucker and Scott Blum .Mayfest. '83 By LARRY LIEBERMAN This Saturday afternoon, May 7, SUNY Albany's Concert Board is presenting their out- door spring concert, Mayfest '83, featuring U2, Eobert Hazard, and David Johansen. of Life\ and \Change Reac- tion\. Having earned the reputation as the Frank Sinatra of Rock 'n' Roll, Hazard's contribution to the line-up should not be underestimated. Lecturers Speak at ·Union U2's latest album on Island Records, WAR, includes the singles \New Year's Day\ and \Sunday Bloody Sunday\ and is their strongest to date. The band has quite a following in the Capitol District, but it remains to be seen whether their club oriented performance can captivate an outdoor audience. The greatest performer who never made it, David Johansen, will open Saturday's show. These aren't the happiest of times for David Jo'. CBS has finally dumped him from their roster after years of trying to get his career off the ground. Don't let this fool you though, Johansen continues to be one of the most animated live acts touring, Saturday's per- formance is a guaranteed winner. Author Raymond Carver will give a talk and read from his work at Union College on May 9, 1983. Mr. Carver ·is the author of three books of poetry, mcluding At Night the Salmon Move, and several collecti~ons of short fiction, including Will You Please Be Quiet, Please?, which was nominated for the National Book Award in 1977, and What We Talk About When. We Talk About Love; His most recent volume, Fires, is a collection of poetry, essays, and stories. Mr. Carver's work has appeared in The New Yorker, Antaeus, Esquire, and man.y other journals. Knopf will issue a new collection of his fiction in 1983. Mr. Carver is Professor of English at Syracuse University, where he teaches in the Creative Writing Program. Mr. Carver will speak on the contemporary short story at 3:30 in the Humanities Lounge and will read from his fiction at 8:00 in the Hale House Lower Lounge.

Alibozek led the attack for Union four hits, in- cluding three doubles, and Wood chipped in with three hits. Andy Dreher reached on an error, Ed Moriarity singled home Wood with the tying run. Then with two out, Tom Barrett ripped a single to left scoring Dreher with the winning run. Union hurler Mark Gietek pitched out -of a ba~es~load.ed jam in the seventh to secure the victory. Cietek turned in the second fine perforl11ance by the staff on the day as he yielded eight hits and thre.e · runs in picking up the win. Freshman Tom Barrett, in his first start, had two hits and two RBI's while Ed Moriarity added two hits.

Union played a hard game against Castleton but was unable to overcome their hitting strength.

Sports .Staff This past weekend the Union Rugby team found itself in its third tournament in three weeks. this one being in Albany. In the first game, Union went up against a physical club team from Babylon; Long Island. On the opening kick off, the Babylon wing picked up the ball and darted down the field for a quick score. The stunned Union side immediately realized this game would not be easy to win. With fhe starting ruggers out of the line up, Union had its work cut out for itself. Following Babylon's try, Union controlled the baU, won most of the rucks and mauls, and continually knocked on Babylon's door. Union spent much -of the first half within the opposition's five-yard line trying to srash through a stalwart defense, but to no avail. Walt Fredrick and Tim Carnicle tried blasting across the goal line only to be stopped by sensational defensive ef- forts. Going into the second half, Union still trailed ·4-0. The team alleviated its frustrations early by running and tackling aggressively. The tide soon turned. Doug Maumgarten picked up a loose ball and springed down the field throwing move after move. He ended up in the end zone knotting the xcore at four apiece, After the score, both teams began to play with .greater intensity.. Union soon found themselves in the end zo'ffe again-this time on a pretty play be Ed Hart who drew four . -- Babylonians toward him, then alertly, .. he passed the ball out to a breaking Steve ~tterson who darted infor Union's second score .of the afternoon. Keith Dean drilled the point after through the uprights making the score 10..4. Union continued to, roll. Hard hitting by John Tierney, Jim McNeil, Jr. and Walt Fredrick among many others, frustrated Babylon which led to maf}y breaks for Union's club. On one hard hit the ball popped into the hands of Aaron Schleifer who passed it to Steve Patterson who went in for his second try ~of the afternoon. Dean made the point after, ending all the scoring .. The final: Union 16; Babylon 4. The second game was just as physical as the first but against a much,more e~perienced club side. Berkshire ·· Rugby Club beat Union in this one 19-4 (they late~r went on to win the tour- nament). Despite the score there were many highlights in this game. Tod Fobare playing . his first game had many penetrating runs; while Jeff Beatty played- an unusually aggressive game at second row. Rob Israel scored Union's only try in this match on a well• executed play. The ball flew quickly down the line and out to the wing. The serum _ quickly followed. With short. quick passes, Israel got the ball back, broke into the open and scored. The point after just barely missed. Union plays at home this Saturday against its long~time rivals Albany Law School. The match on library field will be more exciting. The action starts at three o'clock,·BRING YOUR· PARENTS!

The NHL, MISL and NBA are in the middle of respectively ex:citing . championship playoffs while major league baseball an.d the United States Football League are well into their respective. regular season campaigns. This is always a. time .of great discussion and controversy for the many Union students that follow professional sports. Everyone has their own opinion and I am ni> different than the other guy. So fqr you many fans that haven't been keeping abreast of the pro sports scene, here's a few comments and observations that should give you a little help if you wish to jump in on an ~rgument amongst your friends. What's Bruin-The Be!'{n Town skaters have proved during thi's year's campaign to have one of the best squads in the NHL. Harry Sinden 1:1nd company have put together, over the last few years, an organization that could work as · an effective blueprint for the few floun- dering organizations in the NHL. The Bruins run a low budget operation that puts a great deal of empha.sis on player development and thoughtful use of the draft. Unlike the Islanders or the Rangers, the Bruins have risen to the top ofthe NHL without the use of a huge amount of money .. The Penguins and the Devils of the NHL should call Professor Sinden and hope he's got roorn in his sufnmer school. As good as the Bruins are, I r~ally think the Islanders are that much better. The Bruins seemed to peak during the season and unfortunately for . Gerry Cheevers' squad the Islanders seem to be peaking right at this juncture in the playoffs.' They've been in this same position for the last three years and know what it's like to carry that cup up . high over their heads~ More Stanley Cup-Out in Edmonton, the Oilers are making believers of many in the hockey circles with their average of siX goals a game . . whHe only giving up two lam- plighters a game to the high- scoring Chicago Black Hawks. Andy .Moog is playing great in between the pipes for the Smythe Division champs. Many Eastern hockey fans haven't seen the Oilers play that often and never expected them to be playing the type·of playoffs that they ate. Loolt for the classic Stanley Cup Finals match-up between the high~scoring Oilers f,lnd the tough defense that either the Islanders or Bruins can put out on tbe ice for sixty minutes. Hoop 1 Scoop--This reporter was amazed at tbe four game sweep of the Celtics by the Bucks. The Bucks are proud to hoast that they are the only team ever to sweep the Celtics in a. four game series. The Bucks played hungry and continually · won the battles under the boarQs.. The big difference in the- four game sweep for Don Nelson's Bucks was their success in nullifying .the Celtics' tough transition . game.

The Force has reached the semi-finals of the playoffs for the first time and owns the home field advantage. And what an advantage that is! Each time they step. on the field in their series vs. Baltimore they will set another record for attendance at an MISL game. · Last week the Force defeated Baltimore in front of a crowd of over 19,000 fans.

After boosting hopes of an undefeated season, the tennis team was dealt three lethal blows thi!'l week. They lost to RPI, 5-4, to Albany State, 9-0, and: to Colgate, 6-3. The team's record was set back to 8-3 • The optimistic team ventured te RPI with hopes of an easy victory. But as a result of poor play and' close defeats, the team experienced its first loss. However, fine singles play was rendered by Dave Patalita, Steve Eskenazi, and Bruce Goldsmith. The only victorious doubles team was that of Steve Eskenazi and Colin Green and with only one more win needed to. cli,neh the match, Union lost two close three-set doubles matches. The disgruntled team· then traveled to Albany where it was soundly hammered into defeat. Neither Goldsmith, Eskenazi, nor Rick Molot could dent the tough Albany squad. Special mention must go to Dwight Moore and Steve Eskenazi who played tough three-set matches. The well~seasoned doubles teams all fell short of victory in what can only be termed as very bad tennis. The dismayed squad was the.n visited by Division One Colgate, the toughest team Union has Dave Katz and the rest of the tennis team are looking to rebound against Middlebury and Oneonta and finish 10-3. . played in the past few years. and Oneonta to finish 10-3.

As the team enters the last week of the season there is once again a glimmer of optimism. The team has forgotten its untimely losses and looks · forward to beating Middlebury ' The Continentals came out swarming in the third period and had two quick goals before Union could regroup. The teams exchanged three more goals in the period, making the score 9- 7. E'bbets Off to Moscow Union seemed on the verge of making a comeback at the start of the fourth period, cutting the margin to 9-8. Both defenses played outstanding for the next several minutes, but then Hamilton scored a heart- breaking tenth goal, and soon an eleventh to put the game out of reach. Union had some outside chances of coming back towards the end, but missed on their opportunities. ByGAC-SID Sports Staff Russ Ebbets, Union College's track and cross-country coach for both the men's and women's programs, will leave for Moscow on May 29 for a two- week graduate ·course on coaching. Ebbets, a 1977 graduate of Union, is taking the course through Concordia University of Montreal. \This is a great opportunity for me and will complement the work I did on my masters thesis,\ said Ebbets, who ob- tained his MEd in Physical Education Administration from Norwich University in May of 1981. Ebbets' thesis con- centrated on Olympic Development Programs of East Germany and the Soviet Union. While in Russia, Ebbets will study the Organization and Administration of. Sport in the USSR, Elementary and Secondary Physical Education, Sports Boarding Schools for Elite· Athletes, and the Application of Biological and Medical Science to Sport. In just two years as Unjon's head track and cross-country coach, Ebbets has turned the programs into consistent winners. This spring's outdoor track team is currently un- defeated with a 5-0 record while the indoor season ended with a 6-2 dual record. Ebbets, who was the head track and cross-country coach at Bishop Gibbons for both boys and girls from 1977 until 1980, will return to Union on June 13. .•.

PARENTS' WEFJKEND 1983 Union College Glee Clubs 1982·83 0 ... 0 :1: Q. ~ .rt: Glee Club to Perform By ELLENM.MILI.S Women's Glee Club- Union College has been a coeducational institution for over a decade, but it is only within the last nine years. that a Women's Glee Club has existed . here. The Men's Glee Club has · long been · known in college music circles, but the Women, despite their short bistory, have already established a fine reputation for themselves. Each year has brought more talent, enthusiasm, exposure, and, consequently, recognition · to the organization. At present, the Women's Glee Club is a small but dedicated group of approximately thirty members. Under the musical direction of Hugh Allen Wilson, the group rehearses twice. a week to maintain the high quality of their sound and to increase their solo repertoire. The cuhnination ofthese weeks of rehearsal comes as a chance to sing ~fore a live audience. . The concerts, both at home· and away, are the highlights of the year and in the past the Club has ·performed in such places as the White House and St. · Patrick's Cathedral in New York City. More recently, the Women and the Men traveled together to Washington, D.C. in March to perform at the . majestic Washington Cathedral. The Women then continued solo to Virginia where they joined the Washington and By BARRY GILMAN Men's Glee Club .:-:The Union College Glee Club, founded in 1869, is now in its twentieth year under the direction of Professor Hugh Allen Wilson. The 1983 Parent's Weekend Concert marks the close of a very successful season. In November, the Glee Club traveled to Wellesley, Massachusetts, to join the Wellesley College Choir in a performance of several works Lee University Glee Club for a concert including the Te Deum by Antonin Dvorak. Performances of major choral works are .nothing new for the Women's Glee Club, for in additiontothe Te Deum, they have sung Haydn's Missa Sancti N!colai, Handel's Messiah, and many · other pieces. For example, last winter in Wor- cester, Mass., the Women combined with the Worcester Master Singers and the Union Men's Glee Club and presented an acclaimed performance of the Verdi Requiem, under the direction of F. John Adams. This past winter the vy omen performed' a well received _solo concert in Memorial Chapel, featuring A Ceremony of Carols by· Benjamin Britten. Although the Women's and the Men's Glee Clubs perform together at least twice a year (Homecoming and Parent's Weekeod) the majority of their concerts are performed in- dependently of each other, usually with .groups from other colleges. The Women have enjoyed successful concert exchanges with many men's choruses, including those from Cornell, West Point and RPI. They have also had the privilege of singing with the choirs of Simmons and Wellesley in \A Festival of Women's Voices.\ Participation in the Women's Glee Club offers its members a chance for fun, travel, and creative expre:;;sion. Rehear- sals and concerts provide a release from a.cademic .pressures and an opportunity to interact with other young women and men in a relaxed and informal atmosphere. Many meJIIbers nave -sung in choral groups ttwougbout high school and have chosen to continue their interest in singing here at Union. But, despite the .experience of many of the women and the high quality of their performances; membership in the Club is not exclusive. In fact, .any female member of the College com- munity is welcome to join, as the only requirements· ate a desire to sing and a. dedication to the group. Several fine singers will be graduating in June, so new voices are needed .for next year ana anyone who is interested in joining' may , conta~t Jennifer Cornell, or Liz MacKenzie for more in· fonnation.' - The 1M2-83 school year has been a g<)od one for the Women's Glee Club, and they are looking forward to . celebrating their tenth an- niversary next year. Since 1974 the Women'.s \Glee Club has steadily improved itself, and they should take pride in their past accomplishments and anticipate a successful future among the ranks of the best Women's College Glee Clubs in the nation~ by contemporary composer hosting the Wellesley Choir, Benjamin Britten.

Presiding over this panel will be Presi$lent Morris who will make a few brief opening remarks .. and then turn the discussion over .t& .the four panelists. Vice-President D'Andrea will discuss possible calelldar changes at Union· including the proposed switch from the trimester to regular semester system. · Professor Alan Taylor of the Math Department who is a member of tlte Sloan Com• mittee will discuss the Sloan Foundation grant, and the cirriculum changes it rnay bring about in the future. At the end of last year the college received the $250,000 grant from the Alfred P. Sloan foundation, to implement a program making education in applied mathematics and technological and compnter literacy an integral part ()f its curriculum. Union is one of only 10 colleges in the country to receive a grant of .. this . magnitude from the Fcun• Friday Night: dation. The Sloan grant Will be used at Union to ·support · a workshop . for training . faculty who teach the current Fresh· man Preceptorial; to develop, implem~nt, and evaluate a new quantitatively based ·offering that could become a course requirement for all freshmen; ~ and to develop new, quan- titat~ly rigorous courses in applied mathematics, computer literacy' and technology that fulfill the college's Liberal Learning requirements. Professor Thomas Werner of the CUE (Committee on Union Education) will discuss possible new cour~e requirements. According to Professor James ~ndetwood 1 Cha;ir- person of lhe CUE COmmittee, the purpose . of the Committee \is to e;Jtamine those portions of Union ·Education that do not relate directly to themajor. One of the questions currently being considered is whether or not Union should , ch;uige the curriculum in any way to im- prove the Union students' education outside the major. Recently the committee recommended that starting next year every freshman should be required to take the Freshman Preceptorial, rather take the time to enjoy your day in your own special fashion. Above all, I look ,forward to seetng you at the reception and wish .for you a day. of wann fellowship as a member of the Union College community. Sincerely, JohnS.

Prize Day Ceremony \ By JEANINE VIVONA Jack Anderson Prize Day, a ceremony held e-ach year during Parents' Weekend, is the only event,- other than grauation, at which students and parents can watch the presentation of awards to Union's outstanding students. present awards acknowledging scholarship, community ser- vice, and activities. The winner of the Watson Tra veiling Fello~ship will alsc be in- troduced at thiS time. Who is the most trusted and best read newspaper reporter in the nation? This question was put by President Reagan t() his private pollster, Richard Wirthlin, who conducted a nationwide survey to find the answer. His report .to the president: columnist Jack Anderson. No other reporter is rnDre widely denounced, damned or deplored. Yet none other can claim a following as massive or as loyal as his. The worse the times . get, the greater his popularity grows. He is viewed by millions as the chatnpi()n of the helpless agaii:lst the mighty, the duped against the dllpers. The downtrodden and the derelict look to AnderSDn tQ plague the great malefactors w~o are· beyond their humble reach. ''Anderson etpqses tbe !lad guys and does the st<~ries no other reporters have the g11ts, contacts or determination to do,\ says former White Bouse press secretary Ron Nessen. ·Anderson regularly exposes graft in high places~ impD~t and trivial. He prints inside accounts of secret Cabinet and committee meetings. He takes swipes at the pomposities of the powerful and the antics of the political. He has access to top- secret communications .and doesn't hesitate to pt~blish excerpts that he believes the public has the right to read. The government; he charges, uses the secrecy stamp to censor the news. Some of his revelations ·have rocked Washington. The<Jdore Fl. White, the chronicler of presidential politics, describes Anderson as \an unguided missile, with multiple warheads likely to strike anywhere.\ After Drew Pearson's. death in 1969, Anderson continued alone to battle the powerful interests, influence elections, block appointments, prick myths, shout the unspeakable and reveal the hidden side of life in Washington. But he was never really alone. He ex~ 't ··_-.~ panded the staf~ from four to twenty and increased the number of subscribing newspapers from 600 to 1,000 • He also broke .into radio and television. And he became the eyes and ears in Washington for the mass-circulation Sunday magazine, Parade. Anderson has been the sub- ject of thousands of news stories, book reviews and editorials. \The smartest thing Pearson ever did was to hire Jack Anderson,\ declared the Chicago Tribune on May 6, 1979. Concurred Newsweek magazine on .May 28: \Anderson (was) on. the job before (his) line of work came to be knoWn. as in·. vestigative reporting.'' Anderson was born ill Long Beach, Calif., but brought up in Salt Lake City, Utah. He served as a Mormon missionary bet- ween 1941 and 1943 and the rest of the war years as a cadet officer in the merchant marine, and then as a civilian war correspondent. Anderson joined Drew· Pearson's staff in 1947 and took. over the column when Pearson died in 1969. Prizes recognize outstanding achievements in the Arts, Sciences, and Engineering, and acknowledge outstanding con~ributions to the College in the areas of athletics and community service. The PJ;'esident's Commission on the status of Women at Union College will be awarding prizes to freshmen and senior women for community service, academics, and athletics. The Panhellenic Council and the . Intrafraternity Council will This year, the ceremonies wiD take place at 11 :00 a.m. on Saturday, May 7, in Memorial Chapel. The Chairman of Union's Board of Trustees, Arnold I. Burns, will be on hand to welcome those wbo attend, and Dr. Morris, the President of the College, Deans, and other College Administrators will award pr~es whose value total thousands of dollars. At the conclusion of the ceremony, a printed list of all prizes and their recipients will be distributed to the audience as they leave Memorial Chapel. --~~·~~~~~-~~ ~ .

Career Development Center Concert Band SurviveS The programs of tbe Career Development Center are ba~ed on the premise that career planning is an on-going process- -part of the student's total educational experience. Students are therefore en~ couraged to make use of the career services during all four of their college years. Services include appointments with one of the career counselors, workshOps, panel discussions, lectures, on-campus company recruiting and credential files. To explore a variety of career opportunities, students can use the resources in the career library; visit alumni-ae during Career Observation Days; speak with employers during the annual Career Festival; attend programs on different fields presented by alumni-ae and employers; and obtain relevant work- experience through summer jobs, in- ternships, and-or volunteer positions. ., Students ready to begin job hunting can attend workshop's on resume writing and in- terviewing with practice in- Humor: terviews videotaped for in- dividualized feedback. Seniors can participate in on-campus recruiting.. AU students can make use of the alumni-ae listings in the Center for· in- formation., advice and referrals from Union graduates. The library of the Career Development Center contains extensive resources of career info rma.tio n, company literature and graduate school materials. lnf()I'IIlation is also available on full-time em- ployment opportunities, summer jobs, internships, fellowships andvolunteer work.

'I'he concert will mark the second of three concerts to be given by the band this year. It will represent the combination of help and support from many sources. To fill in the different secti.Qns, guest musicians from local b.igh schools, and even some :musical parents will perform. \We've been lucky,\ says a member, \we've gotten support from all over; the comnurnity, parents, Student Forum, and the administration.'' All this help has been necessary because the Concert Band, establishedlast year, has had to contend with a lack of equipment and reJ::tearsal time, a limited nJ.IIIlber of musicians to draw from, ·and most of all not being known on campus. The concert band was v~ry much the result .of a great deal of effort on the part of Kevin Angus. A junior, Kevin is an engineering major whose musical talents are well known on and off campus; Kevin is a member of the Jazz Ensemble., the \Blues Brothers,\ and this term will be performing in the band, for \Not Like Dreams Do,'' also being presented this weekend. Kevin, who grew up locally, was ableto use his contacts with local musicians, high school music directors, and campus .personnel, to help get the band started. This term Kevin relinquished · his post as president hoping that the organization he was so in~ strumental in creating will have a life pf its own. The post will be filled by Mitch Miller, . a newcomer to the campus, but ~quaUy dedicated to the band.

In addition,. you don't have to clean up your room; you don't have to buy the books for the term .and crack the binding, wbich lowers the reBale value by 78 percent; and most important, you don't have to wake Up at 9:30, hearing your father complain that \you've slept the day- .away.\ Still, I can't wait to spend the summer relaxing on our new lout).ge chair on the corner of 86th · and LeXington.

Moderating the discussion will be Psychology Prcfessor Barbara Markiewicz, wl:10 is married and has <lhildren. The goal of the panel is \to provide encouragement and reassuranc.e,\ Markiewicz said, \for the families coming to campus.\ With their children off at college, women are more lik~ly to consider getting back into the work force, she said. \Careers and marriage are not incompatible,\ but it is difficult to get started again. Other members of the panel will be Joanne Tobiessen, director of Union's Career Development Center, Sociology Professor Terry Weiner.., and Physics P1·ofessor Kenneth Schick.

It is a good way to play your instrument for fun and there are a lot of musicians who whould have fun playing in a band again. It's too bad that people get disappointed because the band isn't as large or as competitive as their high school's. Given a few years, the band is going to be a strong campus activity.

They are very good and don't worry- they won't play just \old stuff\ but will play songs from the 40's to the 80's to satisfy everyone's tastes.

I I I I I ·I . I I I I I I I 1 I I I .... York May 12, 1983 Reknowned columnist Ja~k Anderson tright), with his son Rodney '85 and President John Morris, enjoy the reception in Hale House Friday evening folLowing his lecture. Anderson Predicts Rocky Political Future By DOUG LANDON Editor-in-Chief A crowd gathered in Me~orial Chapel Friday evenmg to welcome and hear the words of renowned coll!ffillist Jack Anderson, the ~ahon's most widely read Journalist. Anderson, the father of freshrnan Rodney Anderson, not only served as Parents' W, eekend speaker, but did so wtthout his usual stipend. The speakers forum sponsored the event. In 1947 Jack Anderson went to Work for the column. of Drew Pearson, which· he inherited in h 1969 .. An investigative reporter, e ts often associated and credited with the uncovering of Political scandals, and has earned a Pulitzer Prize for his reporting. Following an introduction of Ander~on's history and ac· ~omphshments by Associate ~ofessor of Economics Bruee w·tYnh olds, the speaker Qpened 1 • a few anecdotes which ~cetve~ hearty applause from ~ audience, ·and then moved q~kly_into the area of politics. ca f_ermg his predictions on ndldates for the Presidential ~~e now only 17 months away, ersonsaid~e expects Ronald Reagan to run for reelection, and that the President \has left a wake· up call for 1984.\ In the event that Reagan decides to retire, -Anderson sees Vice President George Bush ''ahnost certainly\ as the Republicans' choice .. Bush, whom Anderson described as having \charisma· flashes,\ has maintained both a low profile and loyalty to his administration, and placed many of his own people in key positions. The columnist believes Bush. is competent and experienced, and, specifically, more competent than Reagan. Walter Mondale is presently leading the Democrats,. and the former Vice President is, in Anderson's words, his I?arty•s \answer to Sominex. You could take sleeping pills or. read his speecbe$ . and get the same result.\ Former astronaut John Glenn, second in line on the Democratic side, \would make a very fine.... neighbor ... the sort of fellow you would like to borrow a lawn mover from, (but) I .suspect he has been in ·space too long.'' · In the liberals' corner., ''the YU:l Brynner of polltics\ Senator Alan Cranston of California, according to An~ dersQn, is also competent .and , experienced, but \I don't see pun setting the party on fire., · The most qualified Democratic candidate, and one of the least talked about, said Anderson, is Senator Ernest \Fritz\ Hollings of South Carolina. \His problem is that he sounds like Jimmy Carter.\ He and George Bush ''seem to be the most qualified candidates on each side.\ Election Statements Pagess .. s During the question and answer session which followed the lecture, Anderson was asked about the prospects of former Independent candidate John Anderson, whom he ad- mitted was qualified but \got the Presidential bug\ and began compromising. Bringing up the recent reports on American education that concluded we are falling behind in technological ad- vances, Anderson implied he is simultaneously concerned about the future. \We are hurdling intcithe future at such break-neck speeds that I fear our arrival before we're ready.\ He points out that the process of advancemeQt becomes more rapid with each new development. \Some of the skills that you are teaching at Union will be obsolete before the students are able to practice them.\ Anderson believes \we are governed by politicians with myopic visions. The problems that we face require painful solutions, and politicians don't like painful solutions.\ The United States is the number one technological, industrial, economic and agricultural power and one of the two military superpowers. He believes we should be able to cope with these changes in advancement, but instead the Japanese are overtaking us because of their structure. \We are rich in resources, they are poor in resources,\ he added, noting that they must import oil and food while we 'have these necessities in abundance. The major difference, Anderson explained, is not that they are Sinarter or more in- novative than we are, but rather that \in Japan, industries get together to pool resources, and the government sponsors it,\ while government in the United States inhibits industry with red tape and regulations. Research is subsidized in Japan, and this practice has allowed Japanese industries to overtake ours, first in cameras, second in automobiles, and now in computers. About the ra~ for computer advancements, Anderson commented, \this is a competition we had better not lose, and yet we are losing it.\ Comparing President John Kennedy's successful treatment of the Cuban Missile Crisis to the present situation in the Persian Gulf, an area Anderson considers the \jugular vein\ of the Western world, he implied that we must be cautious and judicious in our policy. He sees the Soviets as being \in the best position to grab power\ in Iran when Ayatollah Khomeini's seat becomes vacant, an inevitable situation. The Soviets now have a 56 Wlit invasion force on the Iranian border. Anderson is \not so sure\ they will allow the deplyment of United States contingency forces in Iranian southern provinces; oil supplies Continued on page 2

The talk, sponsored by the History Department, is free and open to :he public, and will begin at 8 p.m. in Memorial Chapel. In 1973, as principal advisor to Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, Sisco participated in negotiations ending hostilities to the Yom Kippur war. In 1970 he was instrumental in warding off the Syrian invasion of Jordan and negotiated the Egyptian-Israel cease fire ending the \war .of attrition.\ Sisco rose to become un- dersecretary for political af- fairs, the nwnber three post in tne State Department, and negotiated directly with Gamal Nasser, Anwat Sadat, Golda Meir, Moshe Dayan, Abba Eban, Yitzhak Rabin, and King Hussein. He is currently head of Sisco Associates, a consulting firm in Washington, and serves as a foreign news analyst for Cable News Network, ABC. Sisco's lecture is the second of the Anwar Sadat Peace Lecture Series, established w.ith a gift from Union alumnus Fredric S. Miller of Wayne, N.J., to help promote an understanding of the contemporary Middle East. The talk was originally sche-duled for Feb. 7 at Union, but was postphoned because of inclement weather.

Gaburo is a graduate .of the Eastman School of Music and holds a doctorate from the University of Illinois. He has revolutionized his musical scores to incorporate movement, environment, and verbal and visual elements into unified multimedia per• formances. The basis of much of his recent work is his theory of music as language and language as music, which he calls compositional linguistics. Gaburo has received numerous honors, among them Ful:bdght and Guggenheim Fellowships, an award from ASCAP, Thorne Foundation, UNESCO, the George Gershwin Memorial Award, and the Sagalyn Orchestra Award. His non-degree studies include work at the Conservatorio di Santa Cecelia in Rome, at Tanglewood, and the Princeton Seminar in Advanced Musical Studies. Recently he directed Harry Partch's The .BeWitched for the BerHn Theatre Festival. DuPont Grant A $7,000 Du Pont College Science Grant in Chemistry has been received by Union College, College President John S. Morris announced. The funds, .according to Professor Robert Schaefer, chairman of the department, will be used primarily for the purchase and maintenance of instruments. Schaefer said other grant projects will include publication costs, student participation at symposia, and faculty travel. Du Pont funds have been received· by Union's Chemistry Department each year since about 1949. Approximately 40 colleges annually are included in the Du Pont program.

Cost is $4 to Union students, and $6 to off- campus students., On June 30, the Annual Fund officially ends for the 1983-84 year. This year marked the 70th anniversary of the annual fundraising drive. According to Paul Rieschick, Director of the Annual Fund and a graduate of the class of '74, an estimated $1,800;000 will have been raised by June 30. Last week, from May .2.:5, the , student phonathon, signifying the last stage of the fund drive, w?S heJd in the Banquette room of Carnegie Hall. Teams of students phoned both alumni and parents of undergraduates from all over the country. Prior to the start of the phonathon, Rieschick .set this year's goal at $40,000 even though last year over $49;000 was raised. The Annual Fund had been going so well up to that point, he explained, that he did not feel there were very many \good cards\ left. By 1 ' good cards\ he referred to the phone numbers of Alumni who typically contribute generous . amounts each year, He was .pleasantly surprised, however, when students managed to pull in $59,215 from over 16,000 definite pledges. This amount does not include the offers. of contributions from alumni who preferred not to specify any exact amount. The phonathon is set up as a competition as incentive to students to raise increased , contributions. Teams of eight students, with two students manning the phones per night, compete in three separate categories. Prizes are given for greatest number of new donors - those alwnni who had not contributed the .previous year, increased number of pledges, and increased dollars. The three team winners were \The Zoo Crew, .. \TheNankins and \Michelle Hudson's Team.\ No one team was permitted to win a prize in more than one category. In addition prizes were given out each night to individual students for the above categories. In twelve individual student winners were Roslyn Hodes, . Tori Foundas, Jennifer Lane, Dan Wagner, Andy Wax, Marcy Wilder, Kathy Zuckerman, Abagail Lyons, Jeff Rhudin, Tim Orcutt, Jennie Lea, and Beth Whitehurst. \It was the best phonathon in /HOUsing Lottery co-ed Residence nalls '.fest College 2nd Floor 3rd Floor 4th Floor Money raised through the Annual Fund goes, ·he ex- plained, towards decreasing the '''operation budget'' of tbe College.

HANO News President Morris, in response to suggestions made by department heads,.has deCided to abandon the possibility of switching Union back to the semester system. The change had been · suggested by the Committee on Union Education as part of a report to iJBprov-e the quauty of general education at the college. program would still end a week or two earlier than usual. It was suggested that although we stay on the trimester, preceptorial could extend 14 weeks instead of ten, extending into the first month of the next term. It is the president's feeling that changes can be m&de without changing the w)lole system. The com- mittee can then spend more time on important educational issues than issues of the calendar. President Morris responds to proposal to change trimester system. The ·report also .included a suggestiQn for a strengthened preceptorial course, a writing center, more emphasis o.n writing throughout the curriculwn, and the develop- ment ·of 'great ·ideas' courses, The semester system that the CUE suggested included a 32 course graduation requirement, a six course teaching load and a .possib)e . reduction ru1 the number of courses required for a major. · E~ciences tne expenses. of enlarging the laboratories would be substantial. Because there would be onJ,y two terms a year, more students. would be taking labs at the same time, creating a need for more lab space: In addition, Union's term abroad program would be hurt. Because it is just one trimester~ ~only 3 coul'$es, students, such as engineers, who have very tight requirements can still afford to take off one term to study in another country, Students can. also go to two different countries · and still spend pal't of their year on campus .. With a semester system this would not be possible. Tenure Policy Examined In response to this report, President Morris sent a letter to all the department heads, asking them how such a switch would affect their departments. The purpose of sending out the letters was to receive input from the different departments and to find out particlilar ad- vantages and disadvantages that a ·semester system would bring to each department. The responses were to he read and considered, bu:t not to be taken as a vote. . Several professors were in favor of the semester program, especially those teaching preceptorial, because the trimester creates very dense classes , ·and a great deal of material and assigi1Illents must be completed in a very short period of time. In addition, Union's off based schedule whichstarts and ends late could be improved in a semester system. The department heads also brought out various problems involved in changing to a sem~ster program. In ~ the Many of the arguments for and against the semester system.given by the department heads are a result of personal preference and valid arguments can he made on both sides. In switching to a semester system the calendar suggested by the CUE would not fulfill the rigid N.Y. state requirements. Changes woUld have to be made in complying with these stan- dards, whereas the trimester has presented no problem. It seems to be the opinion of the president that although there are substantial individual arguments to change to a · semester system, as a whole there is not that much dif· ference in the two systems, and the energy and · expense that would go into changing the existing prqgram does not seem worth it. - In addition, many -of the difficulties in the trimester program can be resolved without switching . over to a semester. F{)r example, a split winter term has been suggested in which Fall tenn would begin . right after Labor Day and continue until Thanksgiving. Winter term would begin after Thanksgiving for two weeks until winter break. There would be a longer spring break and the Fox - No.rth Side By JAY BARUCH As.sociate News Editor The tenlire .policy at Union College differs from most colleges and universities in the . United States. Prof. Peak, head of the Faculty Review Board (FRB) as well, as a physics professor, pointed out that there are two degrees of tenure, the status of a tenured professor and the status of a tenurable professor. Prof. Peak stated that these two levels are merely two different names for tenured faculty. The distinction lies in that the school sets a quota of 60 percent for professors that may receive tenure on the faculty. The Faculty Review Manual states that ''tenure commits the college to permanent em- ployment for as long as the position to which · the ap- pointment is made continues to exist.\ A professor becomes eligible for tenure after sbf; years. The professor then undergoes tenure review. If the professor passes tenure review he or she achieves the status of tenure ability.

Prof. Peak stated that ''tenurability sounds like extended jeopardy, but it is more relaxed than it sounds. A tenurable professor has all the privileges ·of tenure, it's just that there is a possibility that his contract may not be renewed after four· years.\ The process by which a professor receives tenute is tedious. Normally, when a professor first comes to Union he-she is given the status of an assistant professpr. The professor is subject to a preliminary review after the third year. \If he passes the third year review, the chances of achieving tenure are ex- cellent/' said Professor Peak. There are three areas which are scrutinized when a professor is being examined in tenure ·review and in the third year review; teaching; scholarship, and service to the college. A professor's teaching ability is evaluated through the end of term evaluations, comments from former students and alumni and current Students' written statements. Peer review from fellow professors and examination of the professor's coilrse syllabus and other written assignments in the course also play an im- portant role. · For scholarship evaluation, the professor's publishing or creative works are examined. In disciplines. such as engineering, the professor's activity in consulting is examined. The professor's work is _not only judged by the members of his own depart- ment, but his work is also revieWed by two outside, ililo partial referees to get a dif- ferent perspective of the work. Those referees are editors of journals or other neutral scholars who try to make a judgment as to the '~quality of mind\ of the professor. By examining the scholarly work Prof. Peak stated that they are looking for specific evidence as the the \quality of mind\ of the professor. He commented that they are \looking for eVidence to show that this person has a com- mitment to the profession and evidence to show ongoing ac- tivity of scholarship that will continue.\ Vice President D'Andrea stated that \we just don't want to know if they can do it (create or pub-lish scholarly work) part of their whole life. But whether they will continue to do it, or whether they are interested in their work only to keep a job.l't The final criteria, com• mittnent of the college, is less important than the previous two. \Tenure is not an at- tendance prize,\ said Professor Peak. D'Andrea stated that \mostly we are looking for teaching ability' commitment to creative work, and quality of mind, which is bard to judge.\ The tenure process is initiated the spring before the year of review. ''At this point we examine course evaluations, various other relevant material, the department's vision of the future, the curricula needs, and whether the professor is in the main- stream of the department,\ stated Prof. Peak. The Faculty Review Board then appo'i nts an ad hoc committee to investigate the professor. The committee consists of four members, one from the candidate's depart- ment, one member of the Division but not the Depart- ment, one member of the center from tbe other diVision, and one member from the other center. The ad hoe committee e:lQ!mines published papers as well as other evidence of professional scholarship. In addition,\ they solicit outside ,opinion through student in- terviews on the candidate's reputation. The C«>mmittee recommends the candidate either positively or negatively to the five senior members of the FRB. Accompanied with the recommendation is a report with a narrative describing the procedures of investigation and what they (ad hoc \Committee) \found. The FRB then brings the ad hoc committee before them to defend their report. The FRB then makes a decision using the information presented to them. The FRB in turn makes a recommendation to the Vice- President, who then makes a recommendation to the President. The final decision is made by the Board of Trustees. Usually, the recommendation of the FRB is carried through unchanged to the Board of Trustees. ''There is strength in the recommendation,\ stated Peak. Of the 144 possible tenure track positions at Union, 81 professors are tenured and 20 are tenurable. These figures can be broken down further to show that of the 17 tenure track female professors, 3 are tenured and 115 tenurable. The lack of women tenured can be e~lained because only until recently ( witbin the last ten years) have women been teaching here at Union. Prof. Peak pointed out that \of the · three years that I have been on the FRB, there were eleven tenure cases and ten were successful. In this time period, two women came up for tenure review and both were suc- cessful. (Prof Wineapple · and Prof. Ginsberg). In addition, nobody failed their third year review.\ Dr. D'Andrea stated that \tenure review is so strenuous -because the quality of teaching cannot just be good enough, it has to be better than good enough for Union.\ rn 'C .. 10 .t::. .\1.

Administration ;:~.nd the Union College Community as a whole. It should be a forum for discussion of the various issues which arise before the student body. Lastly·, it shQuld be ef- ficient in the manner through which it accomplishes its ob- jectives. Castelli telligently (!onsider and resolve problems as they arise. The President, as the leader of the Forwn, .should and could guide the Forum in ac- complishing this goal. By proper use of the rules, the President may also make the Forum's consideration of these issues more effective, .if not more efficient. Through the College Governance System, the Forum has the means to achieve what I propose; by the judicio.us use of the Forwn's committees ( COC and Finance) as well as the Forum's representatives on various policy fQrming councils (e.g., Academic Affairs Council, Student Affiars Council, the Board of Trustees) the President can lead the Forum in assuming a much more active role. In conclusion, I hope that I may be given the opportunity to achieve these goals with the Forum. Finally, I urg.e everyone, please, to participate and vote in the elections on Tuesday, May 17, from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. at Carnegie Hall. As President of the Student ____ \\\\\ _____ _ Forwn I would like to ac- complish these goals. It is my hope that the Student Forum can become active in all aspects of Union College life as a positive influence for the student body.

The formerly non-existent bylaws are on the verge of completion. Furthermore; we have guidelines regulating -the ~ ~ creation and funding of various clubs and organizations. In addition, we finally have a Dean of Students who will come back for the following year. These changes, among several others, did-not occur overnight. Rather, each new Formn built on and added to the doings. of the previous Forums, a process which will continue next year. I have been a part of this gradual change for three years, having served as Fresh- man, Sophomore, and currently oJ'IJIJIIJI Class Representative. In ll.ehr addition, I have been a member of the Student Affairs Council for the last two years, being directly involved with such important issues as the Party Policy, the Alcohol Policy, and the rewriting of the Student Conduct C.ode.

The Student Forum has given me an understanding of what goeS on your suggestions and let the Board of Trustees know how you feel. · Since I was involved in student governtnent in high school, I am experienced. I feel that I would be a mature and responsible representative for you. Because of my experiences as an orientation advisor and gatesman, I have learned a lot about Union. I want to get more involved. I know that I could be a strong liaison between you and the Board of Trustees. Please give me the chance to prove that to you. and administrators, something a successful President MUST be able to do. I understand how the Student Forwn works, but more importantly, how it does not work. . With its sound foundation, Student Fo~um can take a new, active role on campus.

Tim Smith While hounding members of the Class of 1984 for signatures earlier this week, I was often asked why I was running for Senior , Representative. QUite simply: because I think that students at Union have lost their voice in campus decisions. To be sure the handful of students on the Student Forum have input, but what about everyone else? It is shocking that so few students know what Student Forum has done this past year. Where did .the Forum spend the , certain that the conscientious reader of these statements will have long ago grown tired of reading such details.)

I have no need for such self-adulation, nor would I presume to give you so little credit by expecting you to cast your vote for Senior Representative based upon the number of titles, offices, and memberships. that a candidate has held. I ask you to cast your vote for me because I am confident in my ability to serve all of our best interests. I do not do things \half-assed\ and have little tolerance or use for those who do. I've never run for an dffice at Union before because · I've never seen this attitude . exhibited by past SGA's. This year's SGA has shown .that competence can be restored to student governance.

Dianne Pavacic Presenting myself to you in 150 words is like trying to squeeze 38 people into a Rich- mond single. It gets to the point wher.e there is confusion, misunderstandings, ideological arguments ... Well, Since 150 words is the limit I, being the editor of this godforsaken rag, must abide :by it. Pavacic In short on September 19, 1981, I entered Union. I have been an R.A., Editor of Co•~ cordiensis, and involved in numerous organizations. Sure, Union has its problems- it's certainly not a paradise- and yes, I must admit I've criticized many an operation. going on here. However, I've always lived by the notion that if you don't like something, stop complaining and do something about it! A stronger, more supported student government can do wonders for tbis campus. I'm willing to make a commitment, will you? Cast your vote on Tuesday. Well, I promised 150, so thanks for your con- sideration. I am involved in a number of campus activities which puts me into direct contact with many students. I know what needs to be changed. I know which policies need to be r~ evaluated. My recent suggestions to the Finance Committee have already been heeded, indicating my ability in these matters. With your vote, I hope to make this a regular occurance. RisaSchwed I have decided to run for Junior Representative because I feel that I can help solve some of the problems that Union is facing and initiate new programs to improve the school. Some of the problems toward which I would direct my efforts ip.volve student apathy con- cerning the school government, the lack of diversity in Union social life, and the frequent insensitivity of the ad- ministration to the student's needs and wants. Schwed To get the student body more involved in the functioning of the student government, I would propose that the Forwn publicize its meeting tinlles as well as the fact that all are encouraged to attend the meetings. As for the last problem, if a change in policy is being considered, such as the closing of the Pub and Skellar on certain nights, the proposed change should be put before the student body for a vote. This Simon To be more specific, at this point I would like to mention that during this year I worked closely with the Residence Life · Office staff in an attempt to solve several pro~lems in the · Davidson dorm (garbage pickup during weekends, return of the washers and dryers in Davidson North,. disciplinary problems, etc.), I also had the pleasure to work with our new Dean of Students, Mr. Joseph Mammola and to discover that he is very receptive to any reasonable suggestion, and furthermore, he is very efficient in solving any problem. I also proposed custodial &ervit!e in the Residence Halls during the weekends, an issue which is being looked into by the director of the physical plant, Mr. Jack Hill. According to Mr. Hill, these services are most probably to be introduced next year. As a Junior Representative I propose to do the next things for the beginning: 1. Improving the social life on the campus by offerln.g students more alternatives than the ones already existing. 2. Represent the Junior Class in any arisen issue, in front of the college administration,. authorities and Student Forum. 3. Be available and open to any reasonable suggestions coming, from my class in par- ticular, and from other students in general. Franklin Schneider way, e':en if this \:ote does.not determme the policy, at least 4. I am also open for radical sug-gestions as long as they are constructive and reasonable. Given the fact that I am already familiar with the Union College Administration as well as with its policies and views in different areas, and given the fact that I am already involved in many activities on this campus, I think I will be able to influence those views and make the voice of .the Junior Class heard on this campus. If the members of my class support me during the elections, and if they will provide me with proper feedback and in- formation during my term in the Student Forum, I will make or cause that many changes will be made on the Union College campus .. Schneider · The pmpose of the Junior Repre&entative is to serve as liaison between the Junior class and the Student Forum. It is the responsibilitx of the representative to voice the opinions of his classmates. Also, the . ~tudent ~orum is directly connected wtth the Finance Committee, which is resPQn- sible for distribution of activity funds. The Student Forum is faced with many challenges next year, such as the creation of by laws and an improved system of distributing the campus the administration will be more aware of how the students feel. I believe that I can do a good job of representing my class. I've had the experience ana I have the enthusiasm; with your support I can put them to work. Please remember to vote on Tuesday, May 17.

However, An<Jrew George ;f!~ be~g u::~~~e:cebyco:~ mittee and having my first taste When I began telling my of dealing with people on a one classmates that I was planning to one basis, I am anxious to to run again ·for the Student serve a full term starting in Forum, the first question I was September. asked was... \What have you The Student Forum has man;y · · done for the freshman class?\ problems to tackle next year, My response of, \nothing\ was the most recently publicized is a surpnse to them but the truth the continually increasing gap to me. ($100,000 this year) between money demanded by student activities and expected income; I feel as an experienced sophomore representative, I could help find solutions to this problem. and others which will be presented to the Forum. I f hope you will give me this op- portunity. George Union College is a community of people working together to benefit the entire surroundings, not a particular group of people. Many of you have joined fraternities, sororities, team sports, extra-curricular ac- tivities, and academic groups. You have found that your in- teractions deal not only with members of the freshman class but with upperclassmen, coaches, faculty, and alumni; all of which constitute the Union community. The job of a Student Forum representative is to work with members of the connrnurdty to formulate ideas and policies for the interest of all. To be truthfulwithyou, I have not found the Student Forum my most rewarding experience at Union. My short three months on the Forum has been a time of listening and learning, and the lack of \hands on work\ Josh Greene Hi, my name is Josh Greene and I'm running for sophomore class representative. My main reason for running is that there are many ways by which life at Union College can be improved upon. Socially, I feel that the advantages of a small school atmosphere are not being utilized to their full capacity. In · addition, there will always he academic changes that should Greene be made both in the curriculwn and the techniques used in teaching the courses .. ~ If elected,. I can't promise that these needed changes will take place overnight, but I can say that I will use tny position to help ·make our time at Union · more enjoyable, both in an academic and social sense. My name is Ben Haftel, and I am running for the office of Sophomore Class Represen- tative. Through involvement with various campus organizations, I have developed a sense of . the needs .of the student population, especially those ofmy Class, and I feel that my own· interests, mirror those of my fellow stmtents. As a Student Forum Representative, l could, by supporting the stands favored by the majority of my classmates, effectively represent the needs and in- terests of everyone. One of the changes I would like to see would be a refreshed feeling of ,College Spirit that is lacking on campus. One of the · reasons for this lack of unity is apathy within the student body. Students are content to sit back and watch things happen in- stead of taking an active role. When circwnstances occur that are not to the students liking, many people sit back and complain. I feel that this sen- '\timent is reflected in the Studept Forum; quiet, passive, and in the background. I would .like to see an active and open Student Gov¢rnment, where each and every student can feel that his or her interests are being well represented. With an active and vocal Student Forum, tha:t not far forgotten feeling of unity and pride can be re-estabUsbed on the campus~ OPENS FRIDAY, MAY 13 M A THEATRE NEAR YOU.

'There are great plans for ad\ ' ditions to Union, such as a new student center; but these things can only come about with the . help and support of the e11tire student 'body!!' Haftel· Sharon Levine First of all I would like to thank the entire freshman ciass for having elected me as your freshman representative. My experience as freshman representative has enabled me to attain a greater un- derstanding ·Of the methQds and procedures necessary for a well functioning student· govern- ment. In order to take ftrll ad- vantage of the benefits offered by a ··small campus, it is essential that communication is maintained between ad- ministration and students at all times. · l have enjoyed representing the class of 1986 and would like 1 to continue to do so in the future, however this is only possible . · with your support. I ask you, the class of 1986, ta once again put your confidence .behind me and vote for Sharon Levine for Sophomore Representative~ Rosser 'John Rosser My nameis John Rosser and I am running for the position of sophomore representative. My past experiences in student government have taught me that it is much easier tQ ·make empty promiseS than to carry them out. For this reason I am only going to promise one thing; Levine to try my hardest. to improve _______ .._ ___ the quality of student life at Chris Siler . As I was considering running for the position of- sophomore · representative, I asked myself the following questions: What should a sophomore representative be, and, how .good would I be as one? A sophomore representative should .represent the en- thusiasm and determination of the class of which he .is from. The good class representative is one who does not need to be told what to do but sees where in- volvement is needed and takes a part in it. Very important is fulfilling the role of represen- ting the· class not only for it as a whole, but also with the in- dividuals in mind. If I am elected I feel I will do .a very good job in these respects. I will become involved with the ad- ministration and making decisions favorable to our class, but I will remain open to . any_ input from individuals. What our class needs now is unity which I know I can help bring · about. If the class of '86 wishes to make its matk in the great history of Union College· 1 it must get into action now.· It's first move can be made at the elections on Tuesday . . . .by v~ting in some good leaders. Vote for me and I won't let you down. Uniop. Student government is designed to give the students a voice in the decisions which affect them. Withyour support I can be that voice. As . your representative I will strive to see that our class's better in- terests are not neglected. I would like to Wish all my opponents good luck and thank you for carefully selecting your student representatives. Remember; one Person cannot make our sophomore year· a success· - it takes pride in our school, class spirit, and a lot of hard work. With your help we can make the next three terms a year to remember. Siler . . ' '. . ' . . ·.. ~ - '. . .' ' . ' . ' . . . . '. ' ' . ' ' ' .

FEATURES Dr. Ruth- Good Sex and Everything Dr. Ruth Westheimer, whom The New York Times labelled \Grandma Freud, ' 1 is a psychologist specializing in human sexual behavior. In the course of her clinical work and private .practice she was ap- palled by the widespread public ignorance c;~f tne most basic sexual information. Out of a deep belief in the \importance of sexual literacy in an age of unpreced'ented sexucal .freedom,'\ she created the only call-in radio show to offer sexually explicit ·information. Since its debut on WYNY -FM in 1980, \Sexually Speaking',.. h~s risen to No. 1 in its time slot. DR.RUTH'SGUIDE TO GOOD SEX offers facts to the sexually perplexed. According to Dr. Ruth, \misinformation is not restricted to the lower Classes or the poorly educated, A coll~ge--educated person is as likely as.a high school.graduate to ask me if a vinegar douche is an effective contraceptive.\ Because of the prevalence of such sexual myths,. Dr. Rutb feels it is important to remind people \not to have sex without contraception unless they want babies and are ready for them. Not to make love to their sisters-in-law. Not to 'let it all hang out' -that can land you in the police station ... Not to do anything unwillingly . . . It is your body and your life-and that goes £or male virgins as well as female ones . . . Not to offend your family or religion if you can reasonably avoid it- and often you can.\ Dr. Ruth illustrates her forthright adv-ice with anec- dotes, quoted conversations and letters from her radio listeners. She talks about the real problems Of real people-from basic sexual questions, like \Which contraceptive should I use?\ or \Where can I find a partner?\ to .problems that I need more extensive solutions, I like ''I have been married for years and never had an orgasm'' and \I ejaculate as soon as I engage in sexual in- tercourse.'' In her frank, sometimes whimsical and always engaging manner, Dr. Ruth never fails to be a source of pragmatic advice. For example, she instructs the man who fantasizes about animals that he is \normal\ but to keep the animals in his fantasies. She Davidson .. Fox Outdoor Party! Live Band Food! Good Times! · May 21 ~X points ·oUt that \partners can share such fantasies just like Leda and the god who made love to her as a lovely swan.\ In another case, she tells a young man to go to the movies :when he complains that \his girl friend couldn't get enough sex, was wearing him out.\ She reassures him that ''you don't have to go crazy to have a good sex life.\ For Dr. Ruth no question is too outrageous and no problem unsolvable. With compassion, humor and insight, Dr. Ruth grandparent or a young single, gay or legally married, whatever 1 do your own thing-- but to learn all you can about sex because it is part of your life, a part that can turn into misery or make you very, very gloriously happy! And ignorance about sex leads no one into the land of heart's content.\ Dr. Ruth Westheimer holds a doctorate in education from Columbia University, a master's degree in sociology from the New School for Social or .. Ruth Westheimer,author of Dr. Ruth's Guide To Good Sex, will speak at Union on May 25th. emphasizes healthy sexual attitudes as necessary for mental and emotional well being. When a 21-year-old gid, worried about having sex from the age of 14, called Dr. Ruth, she explained that the girl can say no if she doesn't want to have sex, that she should get \used to the word until it's as easy as saying ''three tokens, please.' \In another instance a young moter was anxiety- ridden about her three-year-old- daughter, who masturbated with a blanket. Dr. Ruth soothed the mothee' s fears with the information that mastur- bation is common in young children and will lead to a healthy adult sex life. A young couple's break-up over the use of peanut butter as an aphrodisiac and the more serious problems of couples who have no sex lives at all are among the topics dealt with. DR. RUTH'S GUIDE TO GOOD SEX also includes recipes for couples bored with their sex lives, specific exercises to enhance sexual enjoyment for both partners and a sexual I.Q. quiz. Dr. Ruth'.s crusade for \sexual literacy\ has suc- cessfully educated many Americans about the problems and potentials of their own sexuality. \Most of all I tell people 'Do.' Whether you are a DELTA CHI Research, and a. degree in psychology from the Sorbonne. She is an adjunct associate professor in the Human Sexual Teaching program at New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center and a consultant at New York University-Bellevue Hospital Medical Center, Division of Geriatric Medicine.

If their appearance this past week is their best for this year, however, we've got some problems. Granted, the weather has not been conducive to the flourishing of plants and grasses, but rain and snow do not deposit obtuse backhoes next to the Admirtistration Building.

Co-Op Controversy · To the Editor: A great--injustice has been committed against eighteen students, because of in- competence at some level in the Residence Life Office. We are referringto the Smith House co- op lottery. According to stated (oral and written) policy, each contending group was to have submitted a list of eighteen names to the Residence Life · Office by 12 noon sharp this past Monday. We, being the members of one of the groups .in contention for the house submitted our list before the deadline to the Residence Life Secretary. The list was accepted with nothing being said to us about any · possible deadline extension. Later that afternoon, three of us checked with the office for a decision as to which group won the house which was to be an- nounced after four o'clock. We were told by the secretary tnat the decision would be an- nounced the following :JilOrning. Our curiosity was aroused and we hypothesized as to why the announcement was held off until the next day. According to a well founded rumor, the deadline had been extended for the benefit of another group. We were not informed of this alteration of policy. The following morning we checked with the office as to the decislon upon Smith House. We were informed we. did not win the house, for the group which had received the extension had accumulated more points than us. We feel that had we had the additional time, we also would have been able to acclll'nulate additional points. In addition to receiving the unforturtate news, we had scheduled an ap\ pointment with Mr. Dave WoQd to discuss the matter. At the meeting we were in- formed that yes, \a mistake was made,'' and that the deadline was extended for the other group. In .light of this \mistake 1 \. Mr. Wood proposed that the deadline be e~tended for both groups until Wed· ' nesday morning, 9 a.m. sharp. We reluctantly agreed to this. As of press time, we do not know if we have won the. house. We would first like to state that we do not place any blame upon the second group, t\1.~~ were simply misinformed. As for members of the Residence Life Staff, we cannot un· derstand how they were misinformed. The spirit of the lottery, from which the college itself has profited, has been neglected. Whatever the out- come, feelings on either side will be hurt. We write this letter in the hope that next year a mix- up like this will never reoccur. Sincerely yours, One of the Smith House Groups L-etter From The President To the Student Body: N.though it may seem like winter outside they tell me it's Spring Term-spring Term of my senior year. They tell me I can graduate in a few weeks - that is; if I hand in my thesis and pass my Liberal Learing F course; Be that as it may, I thought I might take a moment to express some thanks and concerns', and offer some words of encowagement for those I have shared the year with and those who will remain at Union and carry on, for yet another year. The many student leaders involve.d in Un~on's smorgasbord of cl11bs and ac- tivities must be praised for the time and energy they have devoted. Likewise, the mem- bers of the Student Forum should be commended for their dedication and patience to a sometimes thankless job. The planks have been set in place to mend the rift between the clubs and the Forum.,· and it ·is my hope that the building process will continue. I thank those of you who have worked side by side throughout the year and. encourage tho~e who have sat on the sidelines, to jump into the action. I do not want to rehash the issue of student apathy, or lecture about involvement, .rather, I would, like to share ·what I have learned. Put simply, it is easy to sit back and complain, . but is · far more rewarding to get involved and work toward a change. When you have a chance, pick one of the 60 activities that interests you and find out mote about it. This week,. however; you can get a start on the coming year. Read the statements of the candidates, and listen to them speak as they pace the dorms campaigning. They have elected totake the initiative and tun for office, all we have to do is choose a c~ndidate and vote! Respectfullyyours, < I.S.L.

The show is the result of a ect which combined block g and introspective g\'\\\'\\· Each print is a one-of-a- original-carefully thought and executed. · On May 4, around 4:30 p.m., •\'v\'\'\\\' stole one of the prints. and several others were in the 1 uLLuuutb working, and students h:;morc 'looking at the show just the piece was taken (these students testify that it there at 4:20). At 4:40, a member as~ed me if I had a print. It was then I made my distressing organized, the exhibit is now incomplete. I cannot replace the piece. Secondly, the time at which it occurred and the specific intent (the pins were left stuck neatly inta the wall) leads me to believe that tile thief was a member of the academic community who had seen the show before, knew which pie~e he wanted and when to take it. Does an incident like this mean that artists must take the risk of losing work if they want to exhibit? I don't create art to have it sit in a closet; I create because I have something to share. If I didn't think that people could get something from my work, I wouldn't exhibit. ''Live'' shows of original work are educational experiences for both the artist and the observer. I assumed that people in an academic community would have respect for my work-respect enough to look and not touch. I guess I was wrong. An arts.department that can't trust the campus community enough to share its products is not a complete department. How can we claim to be a liberal arts college when we allow actions like these, which stifle creativity, to occur? My show is .my personal way of reaching out into a ,_community which until now has fostered rny ar- tistic growth. It is a shame that one person's disrespect has to spoil my attitude towards a place that I have felt proud and privileged to belong. In closing, I ask anyone who knows of the whereabouts of my print to return it to its place on the wall. I doa't care who took it- I just want it back. A part of me is gone and I didn't give anyone permission to take it. That specific print is very special to me. Please return the print and with it some of my faith in this campus com- munity. Sincerely MariaT.Pa Co-Op Controversy To the Editor: A great injustice has been committed against eighteen students, because of in- competence at some level in the Residence Life Office. We are referring to the Smith House co- op lottery. According to stated (oral and written) policy, each contending group was to have submitted a list of eighteen names to the Residence Life Office by 12 noon sharp this past Monday. We, being the members of one of the groups in contention for the house submitted our list before the deadline to the Residence Life Secretary. The list was accepted with nothing being said to us about any possible deadline extension. Later that afternoon, three of us checked with the office for a decision as to which group won the house which was to be an- nounced after four o'clock. We were told by the secretary that the decision would be an- nounced the following morning. Our curiosity was aroused and we hypothesized as to why the announcement was held off until the next day. According to a well founded rwnor, the deadline had been extended for the benefit of another group. We were not informed of this alteration of policy. The following morning we checked with the office as to the decision upon Smith House. We were informed we did not win the house, for the group which had received the extension had accumulated more points than us. We feel that had we had the additional time, we also would have been able to accumulate additional points. In addition to receiving the unfortunate news, we had scheduled an ap- pointment with Mr. Dave Wood to discuss the matter. At the meeting we were in- formed that yes, \a mistake was made,\ and that the deadline was extended for the other group. In light of this \mistake Mr. Wood proposed that the deadline be extended for both groups until Wed- nesday morning, 9 a.m. sharp. We reluctantly agreed to this. As of press time, we do not know if we have won the house. We would first like to state that we do not place any blame upon the second group, tb.~~ were simply misinformed. A.s for members of the Residence Life Staff, we cannot un- derstand how they were misinformed. The spirit of the lottery, from which the college itself has profited, has been neglected. Whatever the out- come, feelings on either side will be hurt. We write this letter in the hope that next year a mix· up like this will never reoccur. Sincerely yours, One of the Smith House Groups Letter From The President To the Student Body: Although it may seem like winter outside they tell me it's Spring Term-spring Term of my senior year. They tell me I can graduate in a few weeks - that is, if I hand in my thesis and pass my Liberal Learing F course. Be that as it may, I thought I might take a moment to express some thanks and concerns, and offer some words of encouragement for those I have shared the year with and those who will remain at Union and carry on, for yet another year. The many student leaders involved in Union's smorgasbord of clubs and ac- tivities must be praised for the time and energy they have devoted. Likewise, the mem- bers of the Student Forum should be commended for their dedication and patience to a sometimes thankless job. The planks have been set in place to mend the rift between the clubs and the Forum, and it is my hope that the building process will continue. I thank those of you who have worked side by side throughout the year and encourage those who have sat on the sidelines, to jump into the action. I do not want to rehash the issue of student apathy, or lecture about involvement, rather, I would like to share what I have learned. Put simply, it is easy to sit back and complain, but is far more rewarding to get involved and work toward a change. When you have a chance, pick one of the 60 activities that interests you and find out more about it. This week, however, you can get a start on the coming year. Read the statements of the candidates, and listen to them speak as they pace the dorms campaigning. They have elected to take the initiative and run for office, all we have to do is choose a candidate and vote! Respectfully yours, I.S.L.

'83 OONOORDIENSIS, May 1B, 1983 Page 11 l:apital News JJy JACK ANDERSON ·r and;JOESPEAR WASHINGTON - Another person involved in. the bizarre case of CIA renegade Edwin Wilson has turned up ·ciead: His name is Waldo Oubberstein, and he is believed to have- committed suicide after federal .prosecutors charged he had sold secrets to Libya. Yet the government has been less than forthcoming with the details of · the Dubberstein af- fair. Intelligence soi.U'ces say he was not just another Defense Department bureauc-rat. In fact, Dobberstein was the Pentagon's top analyst on the Middle East befflre his retirement. That means he had access to both Israeli and Egyptian Intelligence, as well as our own, including sensitive -information from inside the Soviet Union. As a key liaison between Israeli, Egyptian and U.S. ino telligence,. lie was thoroughly trusted by the Israelis, who relayed their information, through Debberstein, to the Defense Intelligence Agency. Pentagon sources, mean- · while, say the Israelis didll't learn of .Dubbersteili's alleged espionage activities until after the news reports. They are extremely alarmed. Dubberstein allegedly sold U.S. secrets to Libya after the Libyans had established a close worki~g relationship with Moscow. The Israelis want to know if these secrets were then p~ssed to the Soviets~ And if so, d1d Dubperstein compromise Israeli intelligence operations inside tl1e Soviet Union? Sources close to Wilson say they do not believe Dubbersteih sold secrets that compromised Israeli intelligence. But a larger question remains: II ow could an analyst hold such a sensitive position in U.S. intelligence for four decades and betray this trust undetected? Again, sources close to Wilson say that Dubberstein, like Wilson, worked at lea'St in part with the quiet acquiescence of U.S. intelligence officials. But with Dobberstein's death-he's the third person involved in the Wilson investigation to die under strange circumstances- the answers to these questions may be forever buLied, at least until other renegade in- telligence agents are un- covered. STRAIGHT TO THE POINT: There were few surprises in President Reagan's address to a joint session of Congress. In the nationally telev:ised speech, the president urged Congress to adopt his policy on Central America .. What is more ·revealing is what the president didn~t say, those eleventh-hour change's ordered just before .show time. We've had access to several secret draft copies of the Latin American speech.

POST OFFICE BOONm DOGGLE: A Postal Service plan last year to offer satellite service overseas froni a handful of U.S. cities hasn't .fared as well as officials had hoped. ln fact, sources tell us the new '-.service attracted only 6,000 customers in 1982, due to tough competition from private couriers. The wise 'business decision, of course, would have been to cancel .the service. This was proposed in a closed-door Postal Service Board of· Governors meeting several months ago. Postmaster General William Bolger told the board, \We ought to cut our losses and drop out.\ Instead, officials quietly expanded the service, from just a few cities to more than 250. · PLO IN TROUBLE: The P a 1 esti ne Lt bera tion Organization has been wracked by infighting and bickering among its diverse leaders. But that's not the least of the group's problems. Intelligence sources 'say the PLO is qui.c.kly running out of money. Its. Arab allies are none too eqger to chip in. For example, Iraq, citing financial problems stemming from its war with Iran, has yet to pay $40 million it has promised. For that matter, neither Iran nor Libya are contributing. Even Syria has refused to support the PLO, although some funds have been provided to pro-Sytian factions.

Rebels Trying to Ove~hrow Nicaragua's Leftist Sandinista Regime? By MARCIA LIFSHITZ, PAULEPSTEIN, . BRUCE MARLOWE The Reagan Administration's current policies toward Nicaragua should raise some obvious questions: Why do we feel it is our responsibility, as North.Americans, to impose our vision of democracy on Central America? How, in good con• science, can we support a \secret war\ against a government who, according to Amnesty International,. American Watch, and the Human Rights division of the Organization · of AmeriCan States has reversed many of the Human Rights violations of the previous (American backed) Somoza regime? How .can the United States justify its historical, and continued, support of Latin America's elite rulipg classes while consciously neglecting the needs of the majority? The roots of United States interventionism ln Latin America can be traced back to about 1824, with the inception of the Monroe Doctrine. The Monroe D()ctrine began as a preventive measure against extra hemispheric involvement in the Americas but grew into a vehicle for U. S. hegemony, as the United States passed through various phases of in· ternal growth, and was able to involve itself abroad. The depletion of easily ac· cessible natural resources in the United States by the 1940's, combined with the strain of the war effort, created a U.S. economic dependence on Latin America's natural resources. However, since the 1950's and the Cuban revolution, U.S. intervention in Latin America has taken markedly a different stance. Our programs are now aimed at the maintenance of governments that we deem politically stable, and that will ensure both our political and corporate interests. U.S. intervention in Nicaragua began in 1855, when William Walker, U.S. joiltnalist had hi.Iilself elected President .of Nicaragua with the backing of the News Accessory Transit Company, and President Franklin' Pierce. In 1909, U.S. Marines landed on the Bluefields of Nicaragua to carry Juan J. Estrada to the presidency, In 1926, the Marines returned to Nicaragua to quell a revolution against the pro U.S. government. U.S. troops left Nicaragua in 1933, and their role was assumed by the U. S. created National Guard. The government of Anastasia \Tacho\ Somoza was one of the most cruel and corrupt regimes to ever desecrate Latin . America. With our support, the needS\ of the Nicaraguan people were supplanted by the desires of an urban elite, and foreign market. Cash crops were grown at the expense of staple crops, two percent of the population owned 50 percent of the arable land. The National Guard acted as bot,h Somoza's personal police force and anny, en- forcing inequality and repression. In 1972, the diver- sion of internationalt•elief funds for the victims of the Nicaraguan earthquake, into Somoza's family's private bank account polarized political opinion within Nicaragua .. The middle class no longer sup- petted Somoza's antiquated policies, and began to push for a more liberal solution. By this time, the F.S.L.N. (Sandinista Coalition) had begun consolidating support for a rev,olution among the Nicaraguan people. The death of liberal leader Pedro Joaquin Chamarro in 1978, at the hands of the National Guard, crystali.zed revolutionary fervor within Nicaragua, and in July of 1979, the triumphant Sandinista Coalition gained control of the Nicaraguan government. By labelin·g Nicaragua a Marxist-1.eninist State, the Reagan administration chooses to ignore the fact that most of the internal economy (80 per- cent of the agriculture and industry) remain in private hands. By claiming Nicaragua to be a major human rights violator, the current ad- ministration ignores human rights improvements that have taken place. Nicaragua is the only Latin American nation to ever have invited the Organization· of American States to investigate its human rights policy. The Reagan administration chooses to forget that the Dandinistas did not summarily execute the National Guardsmen, but after individual trials, released hall and did not execute nor torture the other half. The Catholic , Church, increasingly divided in its respflnse to the Sandinista revolution, continues to be a major cultural force within Nicaragua. The Nicaraguan illiteracy rate fell from 50.35 percent in 1978 to 12.07 percent in 1982. Other progressive changes include a revision in the health budget; :373,000 Cordobas were spent in una, while 1,231,000 were spent in 1981. Despite these improvements, the United States continues its campaign of threats and in- tervention against Nicaragua, at both the economic and military levels. In 1981, the U.S. cut off vitally needed wheat loans to Nicaragua claiming that Nicaraguans were . sup- plying arms to the Salvadorian Guerillas. The same day as the cut-off, the State Department itself claimed that Nicaragua had halted all flow of arms. In defiance of U. S. law, the ad~ ministratbn continues to allow para-military camps in Florida where anti-8andinista forces train. In early 1982, the U. S. blocked a $30 million loan from the inter-American bank to Nicaragua. The State Dept. has repeatedly announced con- tingency plans for an invasion of Nicaragua. In October 1981, joint U.S.-Honduran Naval maneuvers simulated a naval blockade of the country and U.S. warships were stationed off the coast of Nicaragua. Despite repeated efforts by the Nicaraguan government to seek an accomodation with the United States, the Reagan administration has refused to enter into talks. The U.S. government must realize that Nicaragua poses no military or economic threat. What the U.S. administration .fears is that Nicaragua may set an example to the poormajorities elsewhere in Central America, who still suffer tyranny similar to that which the Nicaraguans endured under Somoza. Change is possible, and the Sandinistas can help to teach us all that there could be more than two models of development, (U.S.- Soviet) : That a nation can combine grass-roots par- ticipation with profound structural change. Although the U.S. govern- ment accuses Nicaragua of shipping. arms to El Salvadore, this claim remains un- documented. However, U.S. involvemE,lnt in attempts to destabilize the Sandinistan government, have been ad- mitted to by Reagan himself. Misinformation, directed toward the American public in an effort to stereotype the struggles in Central America as a titanic struggle between the U.S. and the U.S.S.R., have clouded our views concerning Central America. In fact, the vast majority of arms and assistance that are reaching Central America originate in VVashington. · While supporting govern- ments in El Salvador and Guatemala, notorious for their indiscriminate slaughter, the Reagan administration singles out Nicaragua as a target for verbal and military threats, international isolation, and a $19 million CIA covert operation. Our tax dollars pay for these activities. As citizens of the United States, we must condemn our nation's part in this injustice. All people have the right to self- determination, as we proved in 1776. We must allow the Nicaraguans to practice their right.

Wait, don't get nervous-they are not from another planet. They are student security, and they are here for your benefit. Chris Chadwick, assistant director of Security and Safety, and two student security managers, Dave Silversmith and Don Salvatore, supervise the 35-40 students who work consistently to provide the rest of the student body with some peace of mind. These college-employed students perform a number of duties. They serve as security guards in North College and Richmond, maintain the security of several campus buildings, and provide a highly- visible foot patrol, which is a deterrent to crime. Any male w:ho has tried to enter North or Richmond between8:30 p.m. and 7:00a.m. knows that he can't do so surreptitiously. First, he is asked for his I.D., and then is announced to whomever he is visiting. This may seem very annoying at first, but it is a service that most girls welcome. The reassurance of knowing that strangers are not roaming the halls is well worth a little inconvenience. And because the guards are fellow students, the hostility or animosity which might be felt towards a uniformed professional is avoided. When securing buildings, the students, ~rmed with flashlights and walky-talkies, check to make sure that win- dows are closed, doors are locked, and that no one is inside. If a problem arises or if something looks suspicious, the student security guard im- mediately calls in to security and a regular officer will respond to the scene. Student officers rarely take an active role in resolving the problem, as it may be dangerous. Foot patrol, too, is mainly a preventive measure, designed so that anyone planning a crime or something devious is aware that security officers are about, and are alert to any suspicious behavior. The time when this service is most important is during school vacations, when no one else is around. This is the must vulnerable time for the school to be infiltrated by outsiders, and by being highly visible, student security acts as . a deterrence to any foul play. \Student security is a very valid and profitable service,\ stated Chadwick. \They are the eyes and ears of the SE;lcurity Department.'' By employing students, the Department of Security and Safety helps to defray its costs. But that practice is profitable in another area-that of relations between staff and students. By in- teracting, the students and the officers get a chance to un- derstand each other. This is beneficial to both sides-the officers gain a better insight into what the student body is like, and the students have the opportunity to relate to the officers as people, rather than as authority figures. Thus, there is a better relationship between the two groups. . Other services provided by student security are handling crowds at special events ana directing traffic. Also, during such emergencies as broken water pipes, student security is there to prevent accidents. The student body response to student security had been less than favorable. When asked, the two student managers replied that the main problem was that there is a lack of awareness. Most students don't realize that student security exists. Everyone appreciates the services provided, such as building checks, but does anyone know who is respon- sible? Next tillle you return from vacation and your stereo is still in your room, you will know whom to thank. Stoneboat Club- ByTOMWEBB and JA:NEWEBB Once again the end of the concrete canoe racing season is here, with the UniQn College Stoneboat club emerging as the most highly rated. club in the Northeast and probably the best in the East. The club was able to compete in only two races this year due to weather and finances. Yet in those two races they were able to compete against the best in the Nor- theast. The first race was held in Akron, Ohio and was hosted by the University of Akron. This race was called the biggest concrete canoe race ever and allowed us to compete with schools we have never com- peted with before. Due to the traveling distance only one boat and crew were able to attend. This hampered us in the final standings because points were added up on a team basis, not on a per-boat basis which favors a two-canoe team. Yet this small team managed to take second place overall · behind Akron which had two boats. Union's boat however beat both of Akron's boats in points on a one- to-one basis. The team made all the finals and placed as follows:Men's Sprint Second Place (Rich Frost and Rod Mclain); Men's Distance First Place (Rod Mclain and Dave Kornorny); Women's Sprint and Long Distance Third Place (Jane Webb and Roberta Stein) ; Faculty Sprint First Place and Long Distance Second Place (Shamir Pasha and Tom Webb); Faculty Sprint F!rst Place and Long Distance Second Place (Shamir Pasha and Tom Webb); Mixed Relay First Place (Rod Mclain, Dave Kornorny, Rich Frost, Roberta Stein, Jane Webb, and Shamir Pasha) ; for a total of three first place awards, two second place and two third place awards. The second race was held in Echo Lake Park, New Jersey. The race was hosted by the New By N. B. BLANK Staff lillian Faderman, professor of English at California State University at Fresno and author of the novel, Surpassing .the Love of Men, spoke on \Lesbianism in Turn of the Century America/' last Thursday. This lecture was the first of two collC>quia on .homosexuality presented by the Internal Education Foundation and the Departments of Jersey Institute of Technology and took place Saturday, May 7. The race turned out to be a cleansweep by Union. The club was able to r-ace both canoes this time. Any team entering two boats was broken up into canoe No. 1 and canoe No, 2 for the scoring of points. Union's No. 1 boat made all the finals while the No. 2 boat only made the mixed division final. Union's No. 1 boat, ''HMS T. K. Jewell\ named after the clu'b's faculty advisor, Professor Jewell, took first place in all of the finals and 56 out of a possible 60 points to win the £irst place overall trophy. All four races were won by large margins, and the superiority of the crews and boats was very apparent. The following students paddled their boat into first place: Men's Division, Rod Mclain and Ken Sipperly; Women's Division, Roberta Stein and Jane Webb; Faculty-staff, Professor Jewell and Shamir Pasha; Mixed Division, Earle Stokes and Roberta Stein. Union's No. 2 boat, paddled by Doug Mac- fadden and Jane Webb took third place in the mixed race final All totaled, Union took home five first· place trophies. (including overall first place), and one third place trC>phy. The remaining members of the Stoneboat Club who helped make this race Union's best ever were: Allisa Addler, Pam Jewell, Mark Ingalls, Guy James, Les Wolkoff, and Tom Webb. Due to the overwhelming success of the Stoneboat Club this year, a new showcase for the trophies will have to be obtained. The present showcase is located on the first floor of Butterfield Hall. The Stoneboat 'Club is looking for new · mem- bers for next year to replace this year's seniors. Membership is not limited to engineers, and all students are. encouraged to join. Interested students should cont~ct the Civil Engineering Office, Butterfield Hall. The Circle of Controversy presents: \The Crisis ·in the Mid-East'·' an intervi.ew with ·Dr. Abdul Baaklini Professor of Political Science at SUNY Albany Tune in·to WRUC 90.9 FM Tues., May 17, 8 p.m. For the news that af,ects you today! Classics, History, Philosophy, and Sociology, and will continue through tomorrow. Ms. Faderman first read from a chapter of her novel entitled \The Last Breath of Innocence.'' Substantiating her theories through magazine a·rticles of the period, Fader- man .said that there was. more openness in discussing woman- woman relationships at the beginn~ng of the twentieth century than during the post• World War I period. Sterotypes preve~tteq women .frolll suspicion of homosexual relationships, Faderman eJ!;• plained, for women were non- sexual, and those who \trana sgressed\ would be identifiable superficially because af physic.al appearances. Articles expressing emotions between women, Faderman continued, were often attr,ibuted to the literary style· of the day, the ''rhetoric and sentimentality of the age.'' Faderman's hypothesis centers on the post-War period, when she saw women's relationships becoming suspect. She noted that as women gained economic freedom during the war they became liberated from many stereotypes. As women saw themselves as individuals, they could free themselves f~om the demands of heterosexual relationships. Contrasting with earlier magazine articles, Faderman deScribed post.;War articles on same-sex love as negative Qr vague, if articles were printed at all. In fact, as time passed, articles. seemed to show an attitude that women were taki;ng their pursuit of in- dependence too far.. Art mag~zines seemed to . be the only type wlllch dealt , with lesbian love af this .time. When mentioned in other sources, this love was often described as a sickness. Only in the, last decade, Faderman· said, with the rise of the feminist movement and the emergence of more feminist magazines, did a more open attitude appear. .However; Ladies Home Jotir'mll and St. Nicholas,, a children's magazine, once liberal with their views regarding same-sex love, have become. conservative magazines. Through the rise of tile feminist movement, many women began to identify with each other and \realize their own importance,\ Faderman concluded. As they sympathized with each other, the movement became more unified. Fader- man also commented that love between women may have been the genesis of the movement. The Gay Minority By LORI FAVATA Staff John D'Emilio of Columbia University spoke on \The Making of an American Homosexual Minority,\ last Friday. / He defined a homosexual as someone who experiences strong and primary . emotions to someone of the same sex. He went on to say that homosexuals recognize this attraction as something dif- ferent,. seek others who are like themselves, and attempt to structure their private lives around being with others of the same sex. D'Emilio traced the treat- ment and attitudes toward homosexuals since the time of colonial America. During this period, homosexuals were faced with the threat of legal punish- ments . such as fines, public whipping or banishment· from the colony. The evidence of homosexual individuals was presented in newspaper ac- counts, diaries, and personal correspondences. Families at this . time provided for them- selves which made it difficult for a man or woman to detach themselves from the family system and survive. At the turn of the twentieth. century, America went from being an agricultural~based society to a capital-based one. A wage labor system began which changed the· structure from a family making a living tC> in- dependent indi=lliduals working on their own. D;Emilio uses this development to help explain why there are more gay men than women. Men were out in the labor force before women, which gave men the opportunity to live outside the family. The o1lly way women coUld live independently was if they had an education. According to D'Emilio, capitalism created a social context where it became possible for people to live their lives for 'themselves based· on sexual desires. Homosexuality has gone from ,being considered a deviant act to an individual identity some men and women take on, to today's view of homosexual~ as they comprise a complex . and urban subculture in this society. He concluded by commenting on the tremendous changes that have recently taken place fDr homosexuals as well as f()r heterosexuals. More women have entered the work force and divorce has increased . Heterosexuals are now facing som~ of the same problems as homosexuals and it may be feasible that our rigidly defined sex roles and attitudes towards sexual activity may be changing dcastically in the future.

They both believe in the importance of the College's relationship withthe community. Therefore, they feel it to be very important to improve the facilities at Proctor's because, as President Morris said, ''Proctor's is a place where important things can happen.\ D'Andrea is scheduled to appear before the Panellenic board and also the Student Forum in or.der to get the students involved with the camf)pign. A flyer will also be sent to. the faculty and ad- ministration. Along with the many donations that have already been made, Mr. Carl has donated the new house curtain. As actor Hal Holbrook said,._ ''Proctor's is a wonderful treasure you :can't replace with . any price.\ Mr. AI Danzig's same sentiments can be felt in his statement, \Proctor's is vital,. alive and has a strong heartbeat!' It therefore seems evident that this fund drive is necessary and if all goes well Will be very successful. The reputation and notoriety of Proctor's is widespread. When Mayor Dorsey met with actor George Burns in Washington, D. C., George Burns said, \Oh you're from Schenectady. Is Proctor's still there?\ Keep your eyes out for ''The Court Gestures''· lmprov. at its best with (Top left C.J. Zaruba, Rudy Green, Anna Tucker, Craig Shell mi.

Internships at -the Egg The Empire State Institute for the Performing Arts is holding auditions for in- ternships for the fall 1983 semester, September to December, on May 18 from 12:00 to 5:00 p.m. The internship is designed to offer teachers, college students, and high school seniors adademic credit for a semester's work at ESIPA. Working as full-time members of the Institute staff, the interns participate in all phases of activities of a professional theatre company. During the semester, interns take part in crew work on sets, costumes, lighting, or theatre ad- ministration. They attend classes and workshops in ac- ting, music, movement, voice, and education, and are ec- nouraged toaudition for parts in the resident company's full- scale productions. Applications and audition appointments may be obtained by calling (518)474-1199 or by writing to Arlene Leff, Intern Program Administrator, ESIPA, Empire State Plaza, Albany, New York, 12223. Minority Scholarship Program A new program offering scholarships for minority students was announced today by Patricia B. Snyder, Producing Director of the Empire State Institute for the Performing Arts,. and Lloyd Oxford, Executive Director of the Urban League of Albany. Mrs. Snyder explained that four scholarships will be awarded each (two per semester) for students· to participate in the Internship Program at ESIPA. Students considering careers in theatre arts will work with A:r:lene Leff, administrator ~of the program, becoming involved in technical, administrative, educational, performing, and promotional aspects of the Performing Arts Center (the Egg) at the Empire State Plaza . The ·Urban League will identify applicants and pre- screen candidates for placement auditions conducted by ESIPA. For their work, interns receive academic credit from their home campuses or schools. Mr. Oxford expressed the hope that students would be drawn not only from the capital area but from around the state, through the Urban League's seven other New York af- filiates. \This is certainly a step in the right direction,\ Mr. Oxford said. \We hope it will be a springboard for generating more interest and participation in the performing arts profession by minority youth. The intern scholarship program may be a catalyst in designing and implementing other kinds of cultural programs an<l we hope it will also encourage· and stimulate individuals to become actively involved in the per- forming arts in the capital district.\ . The first recipients of the scholarships are expected to begin the program during the fall semester. u• 0. .c 0. > .... Ill ~ > .0 0 .... 0 .c c.

Page 14 OONOORDIENSIS~ May 12J 1983 THE ARTS U2 tCelebrates 0 ~n By RICHARD BlEGEN . Last Saturday, May 7, was May-Fest at SUNY Albany. There were two prevailing elements in tfie air: a feeling of ultimate joy, and a fear of impending doom. Both of these themes were closely tied to SUNY's academic schedule, where graduation is just around · the corner. This only made it more fitting for a concert ap- pearance by U2, the romantic band from Ireland with a new political message. The preparations were im- maculate. Rumor had it that 20,000 people had purchased tickets for this Mayfest Celebration (SUNYA's version of Camp Union). Each ticket holder was entitled to unlimited amounts of beer, hot dogs, brownies, and soda. Mother Nature cooperated as well, giving us the best day of the yearto date. It was the one-hour delay before the first act for -which the organizers could be faulted. The opening act was David Johanson, whose most recent appearance in the Capital District was at the 1982 Camp Union. Little has changed in his repertoire since then with the exception of a .sarcastic stanza of \Pass the Dutchie\ in the middle of his \Let's Just Dance\ medley. When he left the stage after forty-five minutes, I didn't hear anyone call for an encore. Johanson was followed by Phi1;51delphia's Robert Hazard, who looked like a combination ofRik Ocasek and Jonah Lewie. Hazard opened with his bouncy dance tune \Hang Around With You.\ and the audience was Review- hooked. People . got up and danced for the 'first time, and his band maintained the in- tensity. His popularity peaked when he played his hit \Escalator of Life.'' Although he didn't play an encore, Hazard now has several new fans in the Capital Distnct. Twenty-five minut.es after Hazard left the stage, it was time for the main ev.::-nt. U2 hit the stage, and opened with \Out of Control\ one of their first singles (and a mainstay at the SkeUar jukebox}. Their lead singer, Bono Vox, has a beautiful voice, and by the end of the first number he had mesmerized the crowd. · U2 played a few more songs from their first album, Boy, and then moved on to their latest album, War (Island Records} .. During the song ''Surrender,\ three white flags were raised.on the stage, and they remained there for the rest of the concert, except ;for the occasions when Bono marched with one. These flags of surrender are U2's political statement. Because there is so much beauty and joy in the world, there is no war worth fighting, and they urge surrender. That is why the album cover of W.ar contains a picture of a beautiful boy rather than tanks. After \Surrender the band played more songs from War. Adam Clayton, the bassist, joined Bono in touring the whole stage, while the Edge, playing lead guitar, was content to stay in one place and play brilliantly. Bono climbed atop the .speakers on both sides of the stage and announced \I love you\ to the crowd. After playjng such Marianne Faithful By LARRY LIEBERMAN · Suddenly it seems that the only women in Rock 'n' Roll are !Dindless li~tle nymphs playing m those nifty, happy-g<rlucky mini-skirt bands. Singing about boys, clothes and dances, these groups have reduced their members to smiling idiots. Fortunately, a few women continue as refreshing ex- ceptions to this trend. Joan Armatrading's material has always been independent and thoughtful, her latest albwn, THE KEY, is no ex- ception. Currently enjoying sen- out, superstar status in England, Americans should expect to be hearing much more from her in the coming months. Perhaps the only female per- former to emerge as even more outstanding and exciting. than Ms. Armatrading is Marianne Fathful. ' At the end o£.1981, Ms. Faith- ful broke her silence after qulte a checkered past. Bouts with drug abuse, personal.problems, ' . and associations with Mick Jagger had set her back, btil only temporarily. A contract with Island Records promised her a new future, and DANGEROUS ACQUAINT- ANCES was released. The album is a study of relation- ships, what they offer and how they let you down. Her latest effort, A CHILD'S AD- VENTURE, is much bolder and intricate, addressing the relationships which individuals have with themselves. A CHILD'S ADVENTURE is hauntingly beautiful, there's no mistaking the fact that its songs are quite personal. What make the album !)O special is that the listener knows this and respects Ms. Faithful's honesty. The theme of the album is generally · desparate, With choruses like \Running for our lives - At least we're pretending we are -- Running for our lives - We never get very far.\ However, we get the feeling that the crisis has .passed and a promising future lies ahead. Thursday, May 12th ·at 8:45 arid 10·:45 Featuring- The Nutmegs '- Chris Gayno.r.and Friends AI bony popular songs as \Two Hearts Beat as One\ \Seconds\, and \Sunday Bloody Sunday\ U2 left the stage. But they weren't finished yet. To encore, they played their · three biggest hits, \New Year's Day'',. \Gloria'' and \I Will Follow\. During the encore Bono kicked a football. forty yards into the crowd, and danced onstage with an at- tractive SUNY co-ed. They left the stage, !lnd came back again for one mere encore. The song was \Forty\ from War, and then it was over. U2 had conquered Albany. Conc~rts·Workshops- Theater Ga·bu·ro: Artist-in-Resid:en·ce The Arts Department is proud to announce that Dr. Kenneth Gaburo will be Artist-in- Residence on campus from May 9 through May 20. An ln.- ternational figure. of almost leg.endary stature in ex- perimental mu$ic and theater, Gaburo will participate in a variety of activities during his residency here. Four arts department courses in music and theater (Arts 142, 149, 52, and 92) will benefit from Gaburo's discussion-present- ations. In .addition, a unique mixed-media workship in music, theater and video will be open to the college community. The first -meeting will take place Thursday, May 12 at 6:30 p.m:. in the new Arts Depart- ment Kreusi Gallery. A public performance, scheduled for Friday, May 20, 8:00 p.m. in Arts 202, will inclu(le work developed during the workshop as well as recent work by Gaburo. Students and faculty are invited to meet with Dr. Gaburo every day from 12:30 - 1:30 at the gallery where he will show and talk about his work. Dr. Gaburo's residency at Union is supported by .a grant from the Internal Education Foundation. Since 1959, Dr. Gaburo has become increasingly involVed with integrating several usually distinct arts into his musical compositions, stimulated by research in the nature of language and linguistics. Trained as a musician, in composition, conducting, and piano, with. degrees from the Eastman School of Music and a doctorate from the University. of Illinois, Gaburo has revolutionized his musical scores - to incorporate movement, environment, verbal, and visual elements into unified multi~media per- formances. Concurrently,· he has developed a theory of music as language, and language as music, which he calls com- .positionalllnguistics. This is the basis of much of his recent work. · As_ a uniqu~ly in~egrat~d department; the Union Arts department is fortunate to have enlisted th_e cooperation of an artist with such diverse in .. terests and talents. A teacher from 1949 to 1975, Gaburo riow devotes most of his· time to composition and performances. Members of his New Music Choral Ensemble, currently in its fourth version, include, mostly graduate students in music at the University of California, Dan Diego, where he was a faculty member from Union College Department of the .Arts presents AMERI·CAN -BUFFALO A_ Play by.

Defea·t Hobart , Base·ball Cont_inues Slide By BLACKNESS Sports Staff The baseball team continued its season .. long slide last week dropping three of four games to bring their record to 3-~~1. The defeats came at the bands of Albany State and Rochester, and the Dutclup.en managed to split s. doubleheader· with Hobart. Albany took. a hollow victory over the Dutchmen last Tuesday as the Danes held a 3-1 lead when the contest was called due to rain. The game had gone six inpings which made it Gfficial. The Dutchmen collected five hits while Ted Cannon held Albany to just OIJe, but the Danes scared three runs in the third withQut the benefit of a hit. Four Union errors handed Albany their runs while the Dutchmen, in absorbing their seventh loss, managed only one run on an RBI double by Ed Moriarty. On Friday, the Dutchmen traveled to Rochester and dropped yet another one run decision~ this time, 7-6. Led by the heroics of Joe Wood, Union forged to a H lead after six innings .. Wood accounted for all five runs with a two-run single in the first and a three-run opposite field homerun, his third tater ·of the year, in the sixth. After George Oberstadt's RBI single in the seventh, Union found itself tied 6-6 entering the ninth inning. While the Dut- chmen · came up empty, Rochester banged three singles to.f{)rce across the winning run. Erratic fielding again 'killed the Garnet, as seven Union errors spelled defeat, The following afternoon Union facecl Hobart in a twinbill which turned into a baseball fiasco. Boththepi:tchingand tbe defense left much to be desired on both sides as Hobart smashed their way t() a 15-7 win in the first game, and the Dutchmen came back and crashed to a 20-11 victory in the second. In fourteen innings, Union hammered oat thirty hits and twenty-seven runs, while Hobart collected eighteen hits, twenty-one walks and twenty~ six runs. The two teams were tied going to the bottom of the third (5-5) in the first game, when Hobart scored nine runs to put the game out of reach. Andy Dreher led the OUtclunen at- tack with four hits including a homerun and a double. Tom Barrett and Pete Cohan chipped in with two hits apiece. The Dutchmen turned the tables on Hobart in the second game, breaking a three game losing streak with a 20·11 win. Union banged out twenty hits in- cluding three homeruns, one each by George Oberstadt, Ed Moriarty and Charlie Hickey. Union scored five runs in the third and eight runs in the fourth to build up an early 15-4 lead. Don Rowe.. who entered the game in the fourth for the Dutchmen, pitched well in relief and picked up the win. Ober- stadt, . John Morretti, Tim Alibozek, and Ed Moriarty aU had three hits for Union. Andy Dreher added two hits in the s~cond game to give him:six hits on the day including two \doubles and a homerun.

W ·- Lax Lose to State Champs By EMILY HAFT Sports Staff This past weekend, Union College hosted the New York · State Women's Lacrosse Championship. The Union varsitx team entered the tourney with high expectations only to be pitted against Cornell University, seeded mnnber one, in the first round. At 8:30, Friday morning, the two teams met in an exciting and enthusiastic game. The Union laxwornen held Cornell scoreless for the first fifteen minutes of the first half and then permitted 12 goals thereafter. Emily Monossen and Cay Lynch both had v~ry good games and were the scoring strengths for Union. The team netted four goals by the tough Cornell goalie and attempted several others. Con~idering Cornell's size, ten times that .of Union, the Dut- chwornen fared very well. The expectations for the game were at first very negative. Playing a strong school such as Cornell would seen-· to bear imminent and embarrassing defeat. However, Union rose to the occasion and impressive defensive work from Beth Meyer, Carolyn Gilbert and Sue Ensel helped. The attitude of the team was the boosting power needed to meet the powerhouse and the of- fensive zone certainly displayed this with unyielding efforts. Bomiie Faulkner and Kathy Furst made a fine showing as well. Holly Howard, usually an offensive strength, played in goal and her athletic skill permitted her to perform well there. After a final score of 12-4, Union went on to face Wells College in the afternoon con- solation round. Having played Wells before, Union was somewhat more confident but the intensity of the morning game was not there. A tired team of Dutchwomen finished their participation in the tournament, losing to Wells, 5- 12. The tournament continued through the ·weekend, ending with an exciting match between Colgate and Cornell. Cornell remained on top throughout the game· and defeated Colgate 10-4 to win the title of State Champion. The consolation tournament was clinched by St. Lawrence. Union's performance against Cornell is to be commended. The talent of Union's Iaxwomen was a fair match for the size of the undefeated state champs. JRugby...

SP'ORTS S.ports Talk With SCOTI' WYKOFF Sports Staff BY SCOTT WYKOFF Sports .staff Varsity sports get all the press coverage here at Union. Each week students run from class on Thursday mornings to pick up the latest Concordy and read about the fortunes of Union's many intercollegiate teams. Upon reading these articles and after taking in a few assorted games, one realizes that only a select minority of the Union community competes at the intercollegiate leveL· Where are -all thos.e firte high school athletes that upon entering Union call it quits for varsity sports. Sitting around in dortns or fraternities, we have all l').eard the same stories over and over again. \Boy I remember when I was all-county in prep school and scored 100 points in a game· my junior year!\ Or even the more popular, \I could start on the football team if I wanted' to.'' The question still stands, where are all these great athletes when it comes time for Varsity team tryouts. A good bet is that many of them are running around campus feverishly attemptng to get a team together in time for the intramural roster deadlines. Union students are blessed with one of the largest and most comprehensive in- tramural programs for any school of our size. Union's strong intramural program gives students the chance to compete on the athletic fields while enjoying the thrill of competition that many students miss from their \all- days in high school. Everyday of the week at Union some type of intramural event is going on. Each night during the fall and spring the million dollar athletic field is lit while teams battle for the ever- coveted championship t-shirt. During the winter the fieldhouse never gets to rest as intramural teams compete around the clock in an attempt to release much of the energy and frustration that surrounds in- dividuals at a northeastern college in the winter. There are basically two breeds of intramural athletes at Union .. The hard~nosed, young has-been athlete who thrives for the taste of athletic competition that they once enjoyed. They throw on their old high school uniforms or the ones stolen from Union prior to their retirement and hit the field of play with the intensity of an E.E. during finals week. The antithesis to these intramural victory machines are the everyday student Dutchmen that just enjoy going out for an hour or two a week with friends and having a good time without a whole lot of intensity. Often times the level of competition in the A division of many leagues ·reaches amazing heights. In train ural hockey, basketball and softball championships, for example, are mapy times more exciting to watch than the varsity counterparts. Spirit, comraderie and just plain fun can all be .had by participating on an intramural team of any level at Union. The many league organizers, referees and supervisors spend many hours making sure every aspect of Union's fine intramural program is running smoothly. If it was not for the dedication of these students, students like you and me would not be able to enjoy. all the benefits that one receives by participating on either an intramural team or in one of the many special events. Many awards each year are given out to top varsity athletes on campus. Just last week at the school award ceremony a number of Dutchmen athletes were honored for their dedication and performance in their respective sports. Also each week, the sports staff picks a worthy recipient for the Miller Athlete of the Week award. Today I would like to name my \Sports Talk Intramural Athlete of the Year.\ A lot of thought has gone into my decision and I have finally come up with a winner. His name is Charley Phillips and he represents Delta Upsilon on the intramural circuit. A day never goes by without Chuck slipping into his jockstrap and shorts and participating in an in- tramural event. Phillips stands for desire, he stands for discipline, he stands for diligence and above all else he stands for what an individual can achieve while participating in Union's strong intramural program. Congratulations to Charley and all those who make me proud to say that in- tramurals are alive and well and living in Schenectady.

ByD.D. · Sports Staff On Tuesda,y, May 3, the Union College men's varsity track team closed out its duel meet season with a meet against Albany State, RPI, and Hart· wick. Albany won the meet, scol'ing 89lh points, Union was second with 63% points, RPI finished third by tallying 50 points, and Hartwick was fourth only managing 4 points. The meet raised the Dutchmen dual meet record to 7~1 for the season. Four Union competitors picked up first place finishes: Winston Britton won both the 100 meter dash (10.9) and the · 200 meter dash (22.9). Dennis Contois won the 800 meter run (1:54.8), while Ed Arnheiter won the 3000 meter steeplechase (10:07.7), and Todd Lafayette won the long jump (6.65ro.). A number of Dutchmen earned second place' points: Gary Wenner in the pole vault (13'0\) Lynwood Wade in the shot put (13.91m. ), Billy McRoberts in the 5000 meter run (15:39.6), and Todd Lafayette in the triple jump (13.37m.). In addition, the 1600 meter relay team of Dave Stanland, Dave Dellehunt, Winston Britton, and Dennis Contois crossed the line in second place with a time of 3:26.1, Third place finishers for Union included Phil Gist in the 400 meter dash (51.3), Dave Dellehunt in the 800 meter run (1:57.4), Scott Remillard in the discus throw (41.84m), and Bob Bertagna in both the long jump (6.38m.) and the triple jump (12.58m.). Rounding out the scoring for Union were Mark Dunn in the discus throw (39.90m.) and Scott Remillard in both the hammer throw (40.l2m.) and the shot put (13.40m.). Friday, May 13 the trackmen will travel to Colgate University to compete in the New York State Track and Field Cham- pionships; the meet will be a two-day event, featuring the best competition in the state.

In fact, in their last two games vs. RPI and Colgate, Union was 'rounced by scores of 12-2 and 14-5, and I bet that didn't put a 'mile on Coach Meagher's face! ... \No it didn't, and I'm sure he .1lso didn't like the fact that in both games his team was outshot by an average of 25 shots, and for youngsters out there at home, that's no way to win lacrosse games.\ · \That's true, Johnny, butlet's give some credit to goalie Steve Koscs, who has been a key to Union's success all year. In both games, the defense unex- pectedly had so-so per- formances, and he had to pick up the slack. But lacrosse is a team sport, and one man can't do it alone.\ \Well put. Yet a major factor in the RPI game was the field condition. Union's used to playing on artificial turf. and even in the rain the conditions are never too sloppy. Union just wasn't able to adjust to the RPI mudbowl, and the fact that they weren't able to practice on grass beforehand didn't help.\ \Jolmny in fact I'm going to go out on a limb here and say that if the game were played on the turf, Union College would have won. I mean, they had a 2•1 lead for a while in the first period when the grass was still relatively hard, but when things got soggy, Union fell apart.\ \Yes the Dutchmen did look befuddled out there, but one thing we've yet to mention is the fine play of the attackmen. They've been getting bad press· from the mass media, but they played valiantly against two big, physical defenses.\ \As you know, Johnny, Union's attackmen have been the key to the Dutchmen's of- fense this year, as they are any year, but at times couldn't put the ball in the net.\ \That's pretty good insight, Gary .. For you kids at home it should be noted Lhat Union's middies played a major role in the team's success this year, notably Steve Myers and Mark Marro. Unfortunately, th~y, along with every other Dut- chman, couldn't keep up with RPI in the mud and after taking control of the game by halftime, RPI cruised to their 12-2 vic- tory.\ \Colgate is a different story, Johnny. I don't think the Dut- chmen could have beaten them on grass, turf, or on the moon. They are playing their best lacrosse in years, and ended their season-with an 8-5 record, as opposed to Union's 5-8. Koscs kept Union itt the game at one point with some stellar goaltending, as Union trailed by as little as 7-4. But, as I stressed before, the key to lacrosse is playing as a team.\ \That's right. For you kids at home out there, teamwork is important, and the Dutctunen didn't have it in all '{>hases of their game throughOut the year. As it. turned out, Colgate was able to take advantage of this ih the fourth quarter, shutting down Union while putting five gc;>als in the net.\ SPORTS HAPPENINGS May 13-14 Baseball May 14at Hartwick 1:00 May 13 Alumni 7:00 Men's Lacrosse Rugby May 14 Albany Old Green 11:00 TenDis Splits ByS.E.

Union 20, Albany Low 10 Ruggers Defeat the Law by Russ Backbouse Sports Staff Union tied the \Law\ at 4-4 after twenty minutes with an exciting forward try by Doug Baumgarten. Serum-half Steve Paterson broke from the base of the serum on (me of his many penetrating runs, leaving the Law defense in disarray before getting the ball back to the pack who continued the forty yard surge, touching down in the comer. This style of play set the mood for the rest of the game. ·The pack played hard and (fol\ the most part), intelligently, dominating their opposition in both the serums and the line- outs. The good clean possession led to an attractive type of rugby featuring much open running, and slick ball handling which made for an entertaining game for the crowd as wen as the players. . As usual Union started slowly and our arch-rivals capitali2ed on some sloppy play taking a ~ lead. Union equalized and soon after took the lead with a try by Andy Klumpp who replaced John Wilber who left . the field with a broken collarbone. Sympatny and congrats on a good seaso!l for the A-side. The fly~half broke weak side and lured the opposing outside· centre bef()re passing the ball to Walt Fredericks who also drew 'his man before putting the wing in the clear to touch down for a .tty, in his debut game for the A team. Baekhouse was sue .. cessful witlt the conversion kick giving Union a 10-4 lead, which Albany narrowed to m~7 before halftime with a long penalty goal. The second half was a one- sided affair. With the wind in their favor, Union never con· ceded a score and ran in two more tries, one by the forwards and one by the line. Indeed the scoremay have been higher had it not been for some erratic refereeing. which appeared to favor the away team. Tbe first score of the half came from a forward rush in which the ball passed through four or five pairs of hands giving senior Wayne Godlin the first try of his career, a fitting reward for his co:mnlltment during that time. In sharp. contrast, the other try was claimed by an athlete who has been playing the game for only two weeks-Tod · Fobare--who seems to be a natural athlete, succeeding at every sport he tries. Russ Backhouse broke through the defending line, gave a long pass to Walt Fredericks who took the ball another 30 yards before putting Tod into a scoring position. Another penalty goal by Law ended the scoring: Union 20, Albany Law 10. The home side looked the best yet this season. The forwardS played' consistently well as usual and the backs had their best game of the season, linking and rutll$g well as a Unit.

Dr. Joseph $isco, a leading expert on the Middle East, delivered an address in Memorial Chapel on Monday. Statesman Optimistic On Mideast ·Issues By JAN BARAN 'News Staff On Mon(lay, May 16, the history department Sponsored the second Anwar Sadat Peace Lecture. This lecture, given by Dr. Joseph Sisco, a former state department negotiator, was entitled \The Middle East: Will U.S. Policy Succeed?\ In intorducing Or. Joseph Sisco, Professor Berk of the history department ·stated that there is \no greater champion of peace ... Dr. Joseph Sisco.\ In 1973 as principal advisor to Secretary of State Henry ~iss~~ger, he played a sigmflcant role in the n~gotiations ending· the Yom Ktppur War. Dr. Sisco also was ~sttumental in warding off the mvasion of Jordan by Syria. Later in 1980 he personally negotiated the Egyptian-Israeli cease fire. Dr. J cseph Siscof in his hi opening statements, described s relationship With Anwar Sadat. He stated that \Anwar S~dat was a very dear and close friend.\ He also indicated that Sadat was a unique man in that he had f()und an inner serenity and self-confidence. Because ·he had . been depicted as an S emotlOnal hot-head, the United tates Administration was amazed that his \self- confidence would be expressed in a leadership toward progress and toward stability in the Middle East.\ Sadat believed that peace would not be found by relying upon the Soviets, but by relaying upon the Americans. Dr. Sisco described the perspective 1n which one should view the United States-Middle East relations when he ex- pressed Sadat's belief that \all the eards are in the hands of the United States.\ This viewpoint was based on the fact that only the United States has been able to achieve results through negotiations. The United States has also been the only power acceptable to both ~ides. The Soviet Union, on the other hand, is only friendly with one side and therefore exercises a \diplomacy with one arm behind its back.'.' Dr. Sisco · indicated that few people in the Middle East would appreciate a peace based on the Soviet ef- forts; but many would welcome a . peace negotiated by the United States. Dr. Sisco then focused on current 'situations in the Mideast. He indicated that there have been two critical events, the Lebanese war and the creation of fresh op- portunities for the U.S. in the war's aftermath. Besides the .possible restoration otpeace in Lebanon, this war, according to Sisco, has meant new op· portunities for U.S. diplomacy. Because the P.L.O. no longer Fitzhugh Ludlow insert inside has an independent base in Lebanon and received only :• 'rhetorical support from the Arabs,'' the Americans can play a larger role in the peace process. The difference between the Lebanese war and Sadat's initiative in 1973 is the role of the Lebanese government. The crucial point, according to Sisco, is that \the Lebanese have agreed on not only a cease fire, but on security arrangements and the actual termination of a state of war between Lebanon and Israel. tt 'l)le Lebanese have also kept the Arab states highly informed about significant events. This has helped to create a situation, according to Sisco, where many of the diverse Arab states are presently urging Syria to get out of Lebanon. Although Secretary of State Schultz has achieved, through diplomacy, a Lebanese- Israeli agreement on the with- drawal of extraneous forces, Sisco pointed out that neither the United States or Lebanon will -urge the Israelis to with- draw unless the Syrians and the PLO withdraw simultaneously. The role of the Syrians in implementing this agreement will be a crucial one. The Syrians, led by Hafez Assad, will want a settlement with Lebanon comparable to the one received by Israel. Dr. Sisco feels ''we are weeks away, if not months, from . any . im• plementation of this withdrawal agreement.'' In order to implement this agreement, another American shuttle is required. Because the Syrians are , highly dependent upon Soviet ' assistance, they want to keep King Hussein, the 'leader of Jordan, out of the negotiating process. The United States, however, has a relatively misunderstood, but extremely significant, leverage in bringing Hussein into the negotiatlons. \The reason why Assad has been trying to prevent, and with some degree of success, Hussein joining the peace process is that he feels that if he is more isolated than he already is, that this will tend to foreclose . . . a negotiation . . . on at least the partial return of the territory surrounding the Golan Heights,,. Dr. Sisco explained. Assad tltus \wants the United States involved\ in the negotiating process to balance the Soviets and to attain con- crete results. Later he mentioned the im- plication ofa Lebanese war. Dr. Sisco's personal belief is that by the end of the year all ex- traneous forces will be with- drawn and that a plan can be implemented in 1984. A second implication of the Lebanese war is the relationship of Israel and Jordan. Both states have cooperated together and neither one desires a West Bank set- tlement that could e potentially harmful to either Jordan or Israel. ~s cooperation will also diminish the likelihood that a Soviet-Cuban missile base could be established. Recently, the Arabs have tried to show a semblance of Continued on page 4

Daniels or take one of his classe·s. If they had, such thoughts would immediately be discarded, for Professor Daniels is not merely a teache.r of Political Science, but an Aid Issue • 1n Limbo (CPS)~The recent rush of court rulings. and regulations changes have left financial aid officers around the country confused and \in limbo\ over just what they're supposed tod<J about asking male aid ap• plicants if they've registered with the Selective Servke System. \We're really in limbo,\ says M.J. Holmes, aid wrector at West Georgia College. \We're trying to follow policy, but the hard part is keeping up with the latest policy to follow.\ Right now, we're telling students we will not require submission of (the registration compliance) statement, but I won't say that's what will be final,\ echoes Lamar Fowler, administrative vice president of Hillsdale College in Michigan. Likewise, \the system office has told us we are not to ask, advertise or account for people who don't sign the compliance form, even though it'·s printed on the front of this year's Pell Grants (application),\ says Larry Dreyer, UCLA's aid director. But at the same time, the U.S. Department of Education has warned that, pending the out- come of a court case in Min- nesota, it may later ask aid offices for the names of people who apply not but don't fill out the compliance forms. The Education Department has also told aid officers not to withhold federal aid from students who don't sign the compliance forms, for fear withholding aid might violate a temporary injunction imposed March 10 by a federal court in Minnesota. Judge Do.nal Alsop tem- porarily stopped enforcement of the law linking aid and military registration until he could issue a ruling in a lawsuit brought by six Minnesota students against the government over the law. A'lsop' s ruling is eXpected in May, when he may either lift the injunction or make it per- manent. In the meantime, the Education Dept. has softened several key regulations of the law, some of them designed te help save it regardless of what Alsop rules. Originally, the law charged campus aid officials with en- forcing the law and forwarding the names of people who wouldn't sign on to the govern- ment. \But after questions on the burden it might create for colleges, that has been changed so that the burden of verification will fall on the Education Dept. and the Selective Service for the first two years,\ says spokesman Andy Pepin. · If the judge allows, the department will still make students sign a \certification of registration compliance, form ·when they apply for aid. Then the department, under the new regulations, would randomly select male ap- plicants' forms, cross check them with Selective Service records, and finally track down students they find to have misrepresented their registration status. Pepin isn't sure what. will' happen to those violators, but thinks they'll probably be forced to repay their aid money, plus interest. The department has already told aid · officers around the country \notto withhold federal student aid or the processing of forms\ while the temporary injunction is in force. But there are plenty of cat- ches. Even if Alsop per- manently enjoins the aid-draft law, Pepin says the Education Dept. will argue its new regulations have effectively amended the law, Which would therefore no longer be subject to a permanent injunction, And if Alsop lifts the tem- porary injunctionJ ''students who refused to sign the . cer- tification of compliance will be asked to come back into their financial aid offices and sign a statement that they've registered,\ Pepin says. \The Education Dept. is being forced to say two different things out of both sides of their mouths,\ says Dennis Martin of the National Association of Student Financial · · Aid Administrators in Washington, D.C. \One is that they have changed the rules, and the other is warning colleges not to do anything until the injunction is settled.\ Congress is now considering extending the day the law .goes into effect from this July 1st to February 1, 1984, to give schools a chance to plan around the Minnesota decision. · t, The Parents' Week~nd Committee deserves a lot of credit for its phenomenal job in organizing Parents' Weekend two weeks ago.

Final Professor Daniel.s is best known .about .campus for his unusual ways of delivering his final exams. \About a dozen years ago, I serendipitously attached a nut and bolt to the short answer portion of the examination which I was in the habit of caUlng 'nuts and bolts.' ~he students reacted quite favorably,... This event occurs each spring term in the Civil Liberties Class~ Some of the other deliveries include such schemes as exams in cakes, balloons, brought in by a hearse, an armored car, and by police officers with real arrest warrants. He personally ·feels that the best was in 1976 when he had the exams delivered by an Army National Guard helicopter. Each year he tries to come, up with something in keeping with the class chemistry. Student Participation Among Professor Daniels' comments and suggestions for Union is the idea of a debate team. In speaking of the' student . government he · said that it see~s to be ''responsive and responsible\ but that he would. like to see students asking more que,stions instead of sitting passively by. Passivity is not a trait valued by Professor Daniels, as one can see by h~ving any sort of contact with him. His active involvement is of tremendous value to the Union conununity.

Panhellemc Compromtses On Sorority Issue. BySHBRRY WEITZEN News Staff The Greek life ex;pansion for women at Union has become a real possibiUtY Since a new roposal was. passed .by the ~anhellenic Council, and ap- proved by Dea~ Mammola and president Morr1s. The' proposal is in regard to the fourt~ sorority that sophomores, Shari Midoneck and Nora Kremmer, and freshmen Caren Gel~ and Edna Falk, have been trymg to start this year. . . . The proposal states . that .af formal · fall rush in .1983 is successful for e~ch of the three existing sororities, then tnree to five national sororities will be invited to visit Union in mid- January, 1 1 964. By a good formal rush, the Panhellenic Collncil' means that based on how many seniors will be graduating from each house, a quota df around twenty women must pledge each of the three sororities. lf a number around twenty is not reached for each house, the Panhellenic Council and the Administration will have to re- .evaluate the situation, and · possibly wait ·before a fourth sorority can be formed. Jane Wood, the advisor to the Panhellenic Council, expres~ed her confidence that an· will' gQ well in formal rush, and the .possibility of the forma !lou of a fourth sorority seems feasible. If enough woiQen go through rush, and there is sufficient interest in Greek life, then; Donations S·oar (CPS)....-Thanks largely to \an ironic effect\ of Reaganomics, donations to colleges boomed to a record $4.86 billion in 1981-82, ac- cording to a study by . the Council for Financial Aid to Education .in New York. In all, colleges took in 15 percent more in donated money than they did in 198o-81, despite the worsening economy at the time., the· council's Joan Lund- .berg says.- · Corporate giving alone neared $1 billion for the first ·· time ever; but much of the total h 'ft , came from \non-cas g1 s like computers. Individual· giving also in- · creased .. The biggest single .gifts. were to Harvard ($77 million), and Washington 'University in St. Louis ($38 million). Both gifts came from the same man.: Edward Malli.nckrodt, Jr. \Reaganomics have had an ironic effect on people,\ ex:- plains Schwartz, pre~ident of the American Association of Fundraising · Councils, which helps non-profit agencies raise money. \There's been so much coverage of federal cutbac~, it's led to an explosion of awareness of the .. pli,ght of nonprofit (groups),\ lie says. Lundberg found that cor- porate .foundations have helped keep giving up even while the economy has been down. More than 600 firms \have foun- dations. established to coor- dinate their support of colleges. ln good years, they put money into it, and in bad years they take from their .assets to. keep the grant patterns up~'' Unofficially, the largest gift ever given a public college was stock worth about $100 million from the Pennington Oil , Foundation to Louisiana State. The family foundation. of Coca- Cola baron Robert W. Woodruff, donated $100 inillion in Coke stock to . Emory University in 1980. It was the largest single gift to· a private school. \As long as it's orily two or three lean years, it's okay (for foundations to sell assets to keep donations up),\ Lundberg says. \You get too many lean years in a row, I think that it might mean trouble.\ She's particularly worried about oil company foundations, whose parent energy firms have · been suffering declining profits over the last two years and now must cope with an ongoing oil glut. · \1983 is going to be the in- teresting year,\ Schwartz adds, \because corporate profits across-the• board fell ·off 24 percent last year, and in our . experience there's a lag time (between the profit per- formance and giving) of up to 18 months.\ Indeed a survey by the Conferen'ce Board, a business research firm in New York, released last year found that only six percent of th~ 4~7 firms it surveyed planned to mcrease ponations for 1982. Wo<!d felt, there is a need for this additional sorority. A Panhellenic re,presentative stated that the Council also wants to sapport the new sor()rity as long as interest exists. · Midoneck felt that the pr()posal was a fair one .. \Vo()d expr.essed her thoughs on what the future of the new soterity was if the conditions of the proposalwere met. Three to f.ive:nationalsororities would be invitedto Union in January. The nationals :would have , to be, pleased withthe number of girls interested for them to want to colonize. Woodsaid that at least 50 women would have to show interest. Once the sorority colonized, the .National would brihg in a :National team and possibly cl>llegiate members from nearby C()lleges, to conduct interviews, and choQse women fo~ the new . chapter. The :National would probably select a· variety of women, with dif- ferent interests so the group wo1.1ld be heterogenous. Wood felt that about .20 to 25 women would be chosen at first even if lOll were 'interested. This way, the group would be small enough to work with and tJtgarlize. Wood also stressed the National must be strong and coDUI1itted, sending advisors to Union in order to organize the colony. The mor:e committment from the national organization, the IllOre :smoothly the for· mation will proceed. Wood stated that there would be no housing for the potential sorority in the near ~future. Tnere !is no feasible place to house a group of woniert Without displacing men or independents andthere is also a problem with ~ousing. Wood felt that in the long run the possibility of ; getting housing was good but, right 11ow, although the Ad- ministration is willing to give a new sortJrity housing, it is just no.t possible. . .An information session for all women that are interested in the formation of a new sorority will be held ort Tuesday, May 31 frorn 7:30 to 8:30 p.m. in Old Chapel. .Representatives from Ute Panhellenic Council,. Jane Wood, and sisters from all three sororities will be there to talk aboat what it is like to be in a sorority. Founding sisters . of Trj.,Delta ·will be there to . tell wbat it was like to be part of the colonization of a new sorority and what it entails. Any one interested should attend. Studer:rts Shari Midoneck and Nora Kremer plan to start 'new sorority. Girlins Center Buyer Sought By GAYLE ROSENFELD News Staff Duringthepast year, the 49-50 acre Girling Center has been up for sale by Union. The decision Vice President of Finance and Administration John Hauser to sell this land arose when a committee of alumni, faculty, and Administrators was ap- pointed by President Morris to examine the importance of Girling to Union. This group \concluded really that it wasn't an essential piece of real estate,\ said Vice Pr¢sident of Finance and Administration John Hauser. Upon that decision and Morris' approval, the college placed the property on the market. The center was picked up on an option by a partnership group . out of Rocklyn, New York. With an option, this party was able to put down a designated amount of money while it considered its plans for Giding. In return, Union could not sell the land to anyone else. However, before a party can buy land , the town of Niskaylitla, where . Girling is located, must ap_prove any plans as .regarding the use of the center. Also, it must be used \within the laws and regulations of the connnunity,\ added HaW~er. In addition, he mentioned that even Union would \have to go to the town of Niskayuna for approval\ of Girting's use by the college. These are the provisions of the option. · However, the Rockland County group wished to develop manufactured ranch homes on a permanent foundation which was opposed by the town. Therefore, last November, within the option's regUlations, this p~rty canceled its opti?n. :As Hauser put it \the opposltlon (in Niskayuna) showed itself very clearly so they chose to withdraw\ even though a formal denial of use was not relayed to the developers. Since November, Girting still has been on the market, but it has only been in the last two- three months that Union, once again, has aggressively pur- sued a sale. The property is appraised at a value of $300,000; however, currently there exists a depressed real estate market so Union woUld probably not receive said amount. Either way the college could secure a hefty sum while alleviating itself of the annual maintenance .fee of the land. Unfortunately, the absence of this land in the college's hands could inhibit various functions held by the campus community on the property. The freshmen OI:ientation picnic, Delta Phi suitcase party, and the Sigma Chi clambake will have to relocate themselves. For• tunately, this problem has not . arisen as of yet. RA Training Program Underway By JUDIE STEINHARDT News 'Staff During the first two weeks of April, the resident advisors for the 1983-84 year wer~ sele~ted by the Residence Life Office . Each student selected must now go tbrough a training .program which began this past Sunday and will continue prior to the start of the fall term. was not being able to find an R~ when you needed one. Morns stated he believes it is very important to always hav~ ac- . cess to an RA. He explamed, \We could offer a better service to the community by utilizing resident advisors in that capacity.\ According to William Morris, the Assistant Director of Residence Life, the program is improying every year thr~ugh rJ) trial and error. He .explamed :e- that some changes . will be ~ made, but he is generally a. pleased with the way the t program has developed. .. ~ ~e major change that wtll be .>- takmg place in the RA program :g for next year will be a way to '5 contact an RA Hseven days a a . Week,twenty-fourhoursa day.\ William Mo~tis,. ~ss1stant In the past, the biggest problem Director' of Res•dence Life M:{)rris discussed how a ,resident advisor may be p~t on .probation it he-she does not ap()ear to be fulftlling his responsibi~tie~. In this c~se an RA isnot .. d1snussed, but g1ven a contract containing the minimum requirements he-she has ·to carry ,out within a . specific length of. time. It is not umtsaal for this to happen once or twice a year. Morris emphasizE¥{ that the BA .prog:ram has seen st~ady improvement. He e:xplamed that when Dave Wood, the Director of Residence Life, first cam'b to Union, \it was like Fort .Apache.;~. I~provem~~t~ have been iii housmg by utiltzmg the RA. program. Sine~ . Dave '\V()od'savrival, RA trammg has increased to a full five days. For 2¥~ days they are taken off campus to the A.di1·ondacks. 'There they are taught coun· seling skills such as effective, active listening arid \how to make an effectiv.e referral.\ This .is neeessary when an RA believes someone from their floor needs to be referred to the counseling center, the health center, the campus ministries, etc. They are also taught how to recognize a depression. Tbey then come back to campus for 2lh more days to learn the rules and regulations, and to meet the Administrators. Morris remarked that the training is difficult and includes inuservice ~raining. sessions which t.ake place twice in the fall and twice ,in the winter. They learn various skills at these meetings, such as first aid, and conf\ict mediation and resolution. ln addition they have speakers; for example: a speaker on alcohol and other drugs. They have fifteen minute meetings every week. Each resident advisor is asked to stop ~ - .. - <.~. ....... \' .. - ............... --- ...... - ...... ,.,. .......... ,.. .. ~ ~ ·- ................ \' .. -in at one of the Residence Life offices every day. E\Tery RA must have both an educational· and a social program for his floor. Morris believes that the most difficult ·part of being an RA, however, is having to wa~ the line between being a peer, a friend, and ~ authority figure. He com- mented that the Head Resident Advisors have the \most challenging position an un- dergraduate can have at Union College.'' An HRA is required to have an overall idea .of the entire residence hall and at the same time be \a resident ad;, visor to the resident advisors.'' Their position is \similar to a professionals.\ They have even more training, more meetings, and more responsibilities than the RA' s. They have a full seven days of training. Morris desc'ribes them as a \really dedicated group. n

Coutinued from page 1 unity in contrast to their earlier division. The division that ·still remains, however, means that Hussein can only get a. \de facto acquiescence of those Arabs committed to co-existence.\ Another factor in the Middle East is the relevant role of· the United States and the Soviet Union. The vital interests of these countries in combination with the inter-regional tension have made this the ''most dangerous area in. the world.'' Dr. Sisco argues that the Soviets are not pushing the Syrians into war even though they· have urged them to be stubborn on the Hussein issue. The ~ovi~ts would not push theSyrtans mto war, according to Sl~co, because either the Syrians would face defeat · beeause of little Arab support or a Syri:an-Israeli war would mean the unwanted direct in- • volvement of the U.S.S.R.

Diocese of Albany . Because of the lack of publicity, and the lack of in· teraction with the campus as a whole, many students do not realize the. functions the Campus Ministry performs. Reverend Nevin feels that the Campus Ministry bas little additional support service,. and this has been one of the dif· ficulties up until now. Accor· ding to Father Cox, students _ come in \uneven trickles,\ and the nex:t step is to achieve greater student contact; The Campus Ministry has had minimal success in Bible studies and sm.all prayer groups. The Campus Ministry is here, however,. to help students deal with any kind of personal problem. Students can simply \shoot the bree~e.\ or discuss serious, troubling problems. Many.studerits do not realize the Campus Ministry is available to help them; there is a lack of awareness; Reverend _Nevin also . expressed concem about whether students feel com· fortable with the Campus Ministry, and will decide to take advantage of it, even if the students know about the Campus Ministry~ Reverend Nevin realizes that students cannot be. forced to come, but students should be made aware of the service the Campus Ministry provides, and not be afraid to take advantage of it. In the future, Father Cox is hoping for more social and religious activities. Discussion groups and improved prayer and Bible stu<}y ·groups are among the possibilities. Reverend Nevin believes that the Campus Ministry shOuld \grow out ·of the lives of the people on campus,\ but students and faculty must first · realize that the Campus Ministry can help out in specific things, and also help to develop various activities. Because the Campus Ministry is concerned with such things as nuclear war, and our environment, Reverend Nevin believes that the Campus Ministry can be an \added perspective.\ Another long range goal is for the Campus Ministry to contribute. to the whole quality of life for students, including learning, dorm life, or anything that contributes to college life. \Eiie Wiesel is much more than just a writer. He is a symbol, a bariner, and a beacon.\ Elie Wiesel: -The Washington Post Soul On Fire Elle Wiesel will be speaJdng in :Memorinl Chapel on Thur- sday, May 26 at 7:30 p.m. Adnrlsslo:n is free for students and faculty. His talk is spon· sor~d by the Jewish Student Union, the Speaker$ and P·olitical ForUJl1S, and the Schenectady Jew.fsh Com- mll1lity. E:lie Wiesel Is acclaimed as one of the most gifted and sen:sitiYe writers of· our time, and an outstanding voice for the universal hUinan conscience. His lectures are recognized as cultlll'\al events, eX.periences of emotional depth and in- tellectual challenge. Mr. Wiesel, who has been called a modern-day ''Wan- del\'ing Jew,'' was born in 1928 in the town of Sighet in Tran- sylvania, Hungary. He was still a cllild when he was taken from his home and sent first to the Auschwitz concentration camp and then to Buchenwald. After the Holocaust, he was taken to Paris, where he lived and worked as a journalist and writer. He is now married and the father of Shlomo Elisha, and he a11d his family live in New York City for most of the yeart spending the balance in Paris and Israel. Mr. Wiesel's recent novel, 'rhe Testament (Summit Eo4JkS), which in its French original version won the 1980 Prix Livre-Inter and Prix des Eibliothecaires in Paris, deals with ibe purges of Jewish in- tellectuals under Stalin. Earlier books include A Jew Today, The Trial of God (both Random House), the autobiographical Night, and the novels Dawn, The Accident, The Town Beyond the Wall, The Gates of the Forest, Beggar in Jerusalem, and The Oath. The Jews of SUence is a personal report on the plight .of SoViet Jewry, while his play, Zelmen, or The Madness of God deals with the same theme. His works also include Legends of Our Time, One Generation After, collections of essays and stories, Souls on Fiie: Portraits and Legends of Hasidic Masters, for which he was awarded the Prix Bordin .of the French Acadeln,y; and Messengers of God: BibHcal Portraits and Legends. His newest book Somewhere a Master (Summit Books) con~ tinues the exploration of Hasidic literature begun with Souls on Fire. Mr. Wiesel is· a recipient of many honors, including the National Jewish Book Awards by the Jewish Book Council in 1964 and 1973, the Jewish Heritage Award for Literature in 1966, and the 1968 Prix Medicis for Beggar in Jerusalem. The holder of honorary doct~rates from many academic institutions, Mr. Wiesel is Andrew Mellon Professor in the Humanities at Boston University. He serves presently as Chairman of the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Council. litE RATHSKELLAR PRESENTS: lNTERNATIONAL BEER NIGHT Featuring the finest brews around the world countries represented: Germany Holland Norway Denmark czecl1eslovakia Eng.l~nd Phillipines Australia Canada Mexico Italy Japan Monday, Mmy 23, 1983 - 8·1 0 p.m. $6.00 per person No one'1.1 __ ~der the C.ge of 19 will •• allowed admittance

Page 6 CONCORDIENSIS, May 19, 1983 FEATURES -- Profile: Robert Rasmussen The Class of '87 By DAVE FITZGERALD Features Staff It may be one of the least noticeable affices at the college, but the Office of College Resources, headed by Vice President Robert Rasmu8sen, is a very important office to the future of the college. Housed in Lamont House, the Office of College Resources consists of the offices of Alumni Affairs, Development, and Public Relations. One of the main purpose.s of aU three of these office§' is to keep alumni, friends of the college, foun- dations., and corporations constantly informed of what is going on at the college. physically it is still fun- damentally the same place. In the movie, faculty and students speak honestly about how they 'eel about the college. It has not .mly been a .success in terms of havingpeople.getto know Union better again, it has also won four national awards. Other ways that the college attempts to keep the public informed of what is happening is through the bi-monthly magazine, Union College. Also about one thousand important friends of the college receive a copy of the Chronicle each week. The Office of Public Relations also sends out a great number of news releases to newspapers in areas in which Robert Rasmussen, Vice- President of Col.lege Resources. According to Vice President Rasmussen it is important that people realize that, \Union is one of the best colleges in the country.\ Vice President Rasmussen is a career professional in educational institution ad- vancement. He is a graduate of Cornell University, where he worked for a number of years in the Office of University Relations after being in the service and working for a few years in private industry. Rasmussen came to Union because it represented a challenge to him. Union offered to him the opportunity to work for an institution that clearly had goals that it wanted to meet. One of the biggest p;rojects that the Office of College Resources is currently involved in is the Campaign for Union. This campaign is the first comprehensive campaign to increase annual fund gifts and to increase the endowment at the same time. The .objective of the campaign is to double the endowment by 1984, which in 1977 was thirty million dollars. To continue the kind of education that exists at Union today, there needs to be an endowment of considerable size to support it. To continually improve the facilities and kind of education at Union, the en- dowment must be continually growing. One of the best votes of confidence in the College comes each year in the form of financial support from the alumni. Union is in the top one percent of the country of alumni that contributes to tb,e college each year. The movie \A Union of People\ is. also a major ac- complishment of Mr. Rasmussen's office. The mov'ie was made to help alumni and friends of the college to see that although it may have changed / students live. According to Rasmussen the college in general receives very good news coverage. · Recently the college was cited in Time magazine as an ex- cellent institution. One reason why we do nat receive more coverage of this type is that being an excellent educational institution is Union's job. Most people and places do not receive heavy news coverage for doing their job. It is a known fact that Union is an excellent institution and news peopie are usually looking for something less well- known than that. A sign that Union is becoming better known is the interest that foundations have begun to show towards Union. Receiving funds from foundations is a highly competive area, which forces Union to compete ·with other fine institutions. Union has to be · a special place and the foun- dations must realize this for Union to receive grants. One thing that Union does not need to do to attract attention according to Rasmussen is advertise in newspapers and journals. Rasmussen feels tllat institutions that need to ad• vertise are in trouble. Union has a good national reputation and this has been achieved. through academic excellence and not advertising. How the college's resources are used and the planning process that is undertaken before any fund drives are undertaken was a topic that Rasmussen discussed at length. All .projects that are undertaK:en at the college are discussed and studied very carefully. Projects are never initiated at the Office of College Resources because somebody thinks they would be good fund raisers. All .projects caome from the campus community and are designed to provide the greatest service to the greatest number of the campus community. Vice President. Rasmussen feels that the greatest change that has occured at the college since he has been here is a change of attitude that both faculty and students have about the college. There is a growing feeling of self-confidence on this campus. This feeling can be seen in the way that planning is handled. The administration of the college has t}le confidence to plan ahead. I.f they were not confident in the College's academics, students, and alurtmi, planning on the scale that has been . done in the last few years would be impossible. A number of changes are proposed for the ·college in- cluding a?llew student center. If confidence in the college did not e;Kist, such ambitious changes would not be· undertaken. Already, planning for the College's bicentennial is un- derway. Vice President Rasmussen feels that this will be a very special event If the belief that there will not be a tricentennial did not exist, most of the current planning would not be underway. Rasmussen feels that Union is avery good place to be. If Union were not as good as it is and if its goals were not as well defined, his job would certainly not be as pleasant. He must travel nearly fifty percent of the time and talk to a great number ·Of people each year. _If Rasmussen did not believe in Union and its purpose, he probably would not be so suc- cessful at his job. One thing that Rasmussen stresses is that people should keep in con~act with the college and make visits often. Basically if you needed to define the most important aspect of Rasmussen's job, it would be to keep people informed about the college. \I think we could stand on the assumption: if we share our college with our alwnni and friends, the result wiil be positive.\ The college is shared a number of ways, which include the stress on interviews for perspective students and the Homecoming and ReUnion activities. that are. held each year. Vice President Rasmussen feels that Union has much to offer and showing this to people will help Union keep its good reputation. 1 The post of Vice President of College Resources is a very important one. College resources are vital to the college right now and in the futtil'e. A large number of people are very interested in the college and part o£ this interest is due to the hard work that Vice President Rasmussen and his staff have done. . . BySTEVE PiRANO Staff Well, it's that time of the year again. High school seniors are hearing where thtlY w~re ac- · cepted or rejected. It is also a hectic.tiine of year for the Union College. Office of Admissions. Joanna Broda, of Admission, was \pleased in terms of hOw next year's class is shaping up\ and ''highly opttmistic about the class of 1987. '' The information obtained is approximate. E}\act figures have not b.e~n comvH~d yet,. and won't be fmtshed until next fall. · \Everyone at Admissions was anticipating a difficult year. This ye~r marked the first year that the graduating senior class had decreased sub· stantially. We were all very nervous, but we are now en• couraged,\ according to Broda. This year, 3,204 applications wer.e submitted and 1,264 were accepted. Approximately 570 incoming freshmen are an. ticipated though. ''Other colleges are starting to g 0 to their waiting lists which' could vary the final total. But we are hoping to get 40 percent Qf those acc~pted,\ Broda stated. Compared to last year, this year's statistics 'are promising. Last year, 3,065 applied, 1,315 were accepted, and 560 enrolled. In other words, the acceptance process was more selective because there were more applicants and fewer acceptances this year. Then again, achievement scor:es are n()t yet ready fQr comparison, and no conclusions can now be drawn from the present data. Also, tbe male-female distribution will be ap- prox:imately 62-38, Which is more imbalanced than the class of 'SIL The Class of '87 will contain 20 6-year . meds, as usual, but it will also contain four 6-year law students which is Union's largest number in quite a while. Currently, the Admissions office is doing a lot of cleanup work. Files have to be sorted Information compiled, and s~ on. But they are confident that the cla~s of 1987 will carry on Union's tradition of greatness. Union College Announces SUMMER PHOTOGRAPHY ARS22 120022-51-52 $450 & $100 fee Photography I (A). .

·\- .. · 001\lOO:RDimNSIS, May 19, 1983 Page 9 THE ARTS Review: Mountebanks 'DREAMS' Don~t Always By·GLENNS. KRUTOFF Arts Editor The musical theatre is the most popular theatrical form in the United States.. This is because, if it is not wtiolly in- digenous to this country, it's the form that we do better than anyone else. The British are tough com- petition, but when Andrew Lloyd Webber was asked to compare the Broadway production of Cats to the original London pr()duction, he said that the New York com- pany was much better becuase, ''only in the U.S. are per- formers trained to Sing well, dance wen, and act well, simultaneously.;' This is why to most people the \Musical\ is the apex of American theatre and why to write one is a notable achievement. The Mountebanks production of Not Like nreams Do represents the collaboration of four stu, dents - Julie Baretz (book}., Joel- Beckerman (music), John Cozzi (lyrics), and Bambi Schl51uch { direc- tion). These four, as well as the company, deserv·e ,spec.ial recognition for their energy and dedication to ·,such a project amid the pressures and responsibilities of their lives as students. The ·cast was basically good and not without its standouts. As . the. protagonist, Michael Jordan, a man caught between his altruistic dreams and the harsh realities of the \cor- porate jungle,\ Rop Quish was captivating. Although not possessing a legitimate stage voice, he managed weU in his songs. They were not· what made his performance memorable. Quish is a com- petent actor and very-charming on stage. His combination of maturity, sensitivity and Davidson- Fox Party Saturday; May 21 1 P.M. Live B~and Franks 25¢ Good Times! Good Times!

The scene in Michael'.s .apartment - due in great part to g&od writing - was ex.ceptionally entertaining and effective. - As Michael's siblings - Susan and Mark - Tracey Kaufman and Mike KMrt were very good, also. The two were blessed .with the best - and perhaps the only - true s:ong in the score·; unimaginatively titled ''Susan's Sortg;\ Klein was very. amusing in his on-stage antics and, amid an ensemble of mediocre singing, proved the strongest voice. As Michael's secretary, E:aren, Diane Sadak was an interesting characte~. As an actress she is very poised and slightly overly~theatrical. . Of the three elements involved in musical theatre performance ~ acting, singing and dancing - Sadak is clearly most inclined to act well. . Bambi Schlauch should be congratulated .for uniting this group and .presenting a relatively good production of a workshop-type piece. . From my critique; thus far, one would expect to see this producth;m on Broadway in the near future. This, however, is surely not the case. The flaws in Not Like Dreams Do are not to be blamed on the cast, who have tried their best with much of the material. The flaws lie in the show's. conception and .protagonist, his girlfriend, his brother and sister, his parents, his secretaries, a few executives, and v.arious others. There seems to be a conceptual tug-of-war between an e1!:amination of Michael's conflict and those of the other characters. As a result, con- flicts. are resolved too quickly and easily, and songs - par- ticularly \Susan's Song;'' and \Thousands of Mornings,\ sung by · Miss Sadak - while ex- pressing the feelings of these song is also, unfortunately, reprised. As a whole, the lyrics in the score are too wordy. The \ music., which is often quite interesting and well .. played ·by the fine pit orchestra, is basically unmelodic. l doubt that anyone left the theatre whistling atune from this show. It will, of course, be argued that this project was meant to be some sort of revolution in musical theatre. It is purported to be a musical \drama\ not a musical \comedy.\ It is, in The only disjointed acting performance was given by Mitch Bernstein. During the epic musical number, \The Boss's Montage,\ Bernstein portrayed an aging exec;:utive unable to keep up with a shrewd ambitious crop of young executives. This- part of his performance was good. However, in later appearances on stage, he becomes a senile geriatric. Senility is plausible, but his characterizatio·n disintegrates into a mere . im- personation of the doddering fool made famous by Tim Cc;mway on the Carol Burnette Show. Other members of the ensemble were good and in- cluded: Lisa Alonzo, Rudy Green, Melinda Phillips, Bambi Schlauch, Eric Ruben, Rob Fast, John Cozzi, Carla Cogan and Karen Schick.

The three are highly talented. One could not expect, however, that their first show would be flawless. The · basic probl'em with their creation is that they try to cram too much into it. The play only runs a little over an hour and within that time they try to develop the characters of the . ' . ~ . . ' ' - ' ' . .

In musical theatre, songs and dances, as well, are used to convey that which cannot be done with mere dialogue. Songs must grow out of scenes, not replace them. The problem of shoving to.o much into little also occurs in most of the songs. In the \Boss's Montage,\ par- ticularly, too many words are crammed into too little music. This, combined with mediocre singing and an unfortunate war of tempos between conductor and performer~,_ results in an almost incomprehensible song that is unentertaining. Thi$ fact, merely a pastiche of \odds and ends.\ · The show asks the musical question, \What happens when dreams fail and reality hits?\ It never answers it. Instead, it merely glosses it over with a cliched, \we are all victims of the system,\ idea. Despite the · disjointed flaws in the play, the written dialogue is usually good and effective, though at times a bit artificial. Miss Baretz' s dialogue suffers under the undue pressure of art un- motivated score. When one leaves the theatre after seeing Fiddler on the Roof, for example, one feels sad, moved and pensive. After Not Like Dreams Do, one is not quite as moved. The Breakers This Saturday and Sunday, May 21 and 22, the Ever After Dance Company will bring some of the most exciting new choreography, based on \Breaking Union. Breaking is done to \Rap\ music ~ both the dance and the music are new folk art forms evolving in Black and Hispanic neigh- borhoods in New York ·city. Breaking originated on the streets as a kind of gymnastic competition. Breakers dance in teams. Each individual takes his turn, trying to outdo the preceeding dancer with mor~ impressive movements in a continuous flurry of rapid footwork, seeking to gain ad~ miration from his teammates and opponents.. It is a com• petitive art which involves daring physical movements taken from dance, gymnastics, and the martial arts in routines that last 10-30 seconds. Ms. Julie Fraad, artistic director of the Ever After Dance Company saw in Breaking an exciting new kind of movement to work into more formal choreography. She began working with a group of Breakers during the summer of 1982. As a choreographer, she sought to develop a form · of urban dance; as a social worker-, she saw Breaking as a creative outlet for adolescent ambition and a source of pride. Ms. Fraad gave expert Breakers · the opportunity to perform at Police Athletic League carnivals and in public schools throughout the city. She believes that the recognition and respect that the Breakers receive from their peers and from wider audiences as a result of these performances has led them to channel their energies into perfecting their art rather than into destructive street behavior. The New York Times, NewYork'Magazine and the Village Voice, among others, have praised the work of the Breakers. Thanks to financial support from the Minerva Committee, Dance Club, Arts Club, Black and Latin Alliance of Students, and the English Department, and the organizational efforts of Professor H.C. Tharsing and the Dance Club, the Ever After Dance Company will be' giving a performance Saturday, May 21, at 8:00 p.m. in the Memorial Chapel, and a lecture- demonstration on Sunday, May 22, at 2:00p.m. in AB 202.

One must realize that the staff of this newspaper does not have telepathic powers to predict such happenings, and often remains in the dark if not specifically told. When pertinent information is omitted from our pag.es, .a negative shadow is cast on our image. Desiring nothing of the sort, we urge any member of the campus cornml.mity who has a hot tip, advertisement, or any other information in which others might be interested., to d:rop it in campus mail and-or give the office a call. Also, if your leak to the pvess warrants an article, please understand that our staff is, regrettably, limited in size, and we sometimes find ourselves with more potential 'Stories than reporters. With this in mind, Oc:mcordiensis welcomes articles on events written by the people involved. Remember, this paper is funded by student activity funds and all students have the privilege of participation open to them.. As long as the article is coherent, and in good taste, we will use it. - Check With the appropriate editor to make sure your notice or article was received. Then, complain and condemn if we fail to publish it. But before you do, be sure the fault lies with us, not With you or· \someone on the committee\ who forgot to teU us. Impure Democracy You hold in your hand the last word on apathy for the year. At the risk of dwelling on the topic, must we assume from Tuesday's elections that we'll have very few complaints against- next year's Forum? Though elections were held in what is probably the place on campus most frequented by students, slightly more than one-third of us bothered to cast our votes. The single positive feature of this turnout is that it is higher than recent Presidential election turnouts for people in our age group. At Union, though, you know the candidates personally and we bring the polls to you. Should any inefficiencies, arguments, delays or scandals within the Forum and its allocation of funds occur next year, as they have routinely ,in the past, will complaints eminate only from the minority who voted? Afraid we can't be naive enough to assume that. The runoff elections are tomorrow. This is your last chance to be forgiven. Finally, whoever the victors, let's give them our support. Those who made the effort to run are a credit to Union. They probably even vote.

Union is a less-than•ideal place to work or study if one is a wom~n, as is much of the world. That does not justify main,. tenance of the status quo. Ratner than merely being willing to work on problems as they arise, thtf administration Should be actively and aggressively pursuing the goal of creating a supportive en- vironment .for a class of people vital to making this campus attractive to a worker-student pool whic,h is increasingly female. Professor Clinton's resignation is a serious loss to the women (if not to the ad:.. ministratots) on this campus. A superb scholar, a dedicated teacher, and a committed social Union College. As a result of her .activities, women on this campus are beginning to communicate with each other, and they are discovering what looks like a pattern of unfair and unequal treatment which in some cases' can only be judged as discriminatory. In. an ldea~ world, there would be no need for a \gadfly\ to remind administrators of their obligations. Obvio,usly,· however, there is such a need here. For the sake of the College, I hope some depart-. ment - or .some one - soon has. the foresight to recognize the needfor, and thecourageto hire and to .support, a gadfly the likes of Catharine Clinton again.

The problem revolves around the Washington correspondent for Tass, the Kremlin~s official news agency. He is allowed to sit in the press. gallery along, with ,correspondents of every other foreign news o~:ganization. But according to Sen. John East, R-N.C., the Tass man in Washirigton isn't just a run-of- the-mill newspaper reporter. In a confidential letter last month to Sen. Charles Mathias, R•Md., the chairman of the Rules Committee, East said the Tass eorrespondent \is in fact an officer or agent of the Soviet intelligence service, the KGB.\ ·East pointed out that the Voice of America is not per- mitted to send a representative to sit in the Senate press gallery .. And East thinks that's silly: \I do not believe that it is appropriate fpr a Soviet spy to enjoy the privileges of . the Senate .press gallery which should be reserved for legitimate members of a free pr~ss. \Nor do I believe that it is appropraite for an arm of the Soviet propaganda. machine such as Tass to have representatives at all in · the press gallery of the · Senate, especially since the Voice of America itself has never been granted such privileges on the grounds that- it is a g<>vernment news . agency. Tass is also a government news agency, yet it has full press credentials in the Senate, even though some of its employees have long been known to be intelligence officers under cover, or to have cooperated -closely with Soviet intelli:gence.n East wants Mathias to revoke the press privileges for the Tass correspondent.· Mathias has referred the matter to the FBI. Meanwhile, 50 senators have signed a letter asking the Rules Committee to let the Voice of America send someone to sit in the Senate press gallery. The letter -points out that the Voice of America is required by law to be an accurate and objective source of news. It also points out that Congress gives the Voice of America . n~arly $140 million a year to do its job. In sum, the letter observes, the Voice of America should at least be granted the same privilege of listening to Senate debates as the Senate grants the- Kremlin's propaganda • organization. UNGER'S DILEMMA: Another of President Reagan's appointments is in serious trouble~ He is Sherman Unger, the president's first nominee to the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals. Unger is currently general. counsel at the Com- merce Department. The American Bar Association's committee on judicial appointments has turned thumbs down on Unger. The~ 15-member committee is asked to pass judgxrient on everyone nominated to be a federal judge. The vote against Unger was unanimous. According to our source, · he was rejected for \poor judicial temperament and lack of personal integrity.\ Unger has refused to comment on the ABA committee's vote. But he'll obviously have to answer questions about it at his confirmation hearing later this month. We don't know what specific faults the committee found with Unger, but we do know .he's been investigated several tunes for violation of travel regulations at the Commerce Department. He has also. been accused of intimidating his s~aff. in the general counsel's office. We reported· almost a year ago on Unger's high-flying travels at taxpayers' expense. He flew first-class when there were cheaper seats available, · and he once stopped off for a three-day visit to a California fat farm while on an official trip. We also reported that Unger had spent $1,442 of the .p11blic's money on a fancy stand-up desk after he broke his arm. He explained that he had to stand up to work while his arm healed. The bar association com· mitt'ee has obviously come up with even more serious charges against Unger. HEADLINES AND FOOT- NOTES: Classified intelligence reports warn of a Cuban baildup in Nicaragua. It's known that Cuban military cadres are advising the Sandinista regime, but now there are reports that Cuban troops have arrived to help the government put down the revolution.

Another report put the figure at 2,000. . - The FBI's contract for janitorial services expired in early May, and the bureau's employees were forced to clean up after themselves.

COMMENTARIES .\ ~ - Campus Feminism By BOBBI COHEN Director of the Women's Resource Center Tina Oakland says, \Most college women think the (women's) movement has worked. Girls don't think they need a movement. They think society is fair.\ I f.ind that this is true of most of my friends and acquaintances at Union . And our educated and liberated men concur. Women, according to the popuiar belief at Union, have in fact, because .of their sex, better chances at securing jobs and admission to graduate schools. What is not known is that wl}ile many women will be offered jobs in the fields of engineering, computer technology. and the sciences, at · high starting salaries, there wi:ll be less chance -~or them to advance their careers once they secure these positions. Union women will have to continue proving their worth long after our men will have established theirs. The battle will just begin when our coeds graduate. It is a long upward climb from there, and such setbacks as prejudice and discrimination still exist, whether you have encountered them thus far or not. Feminism is defined as a theory, or active movement, of social equality for the sexes. In its best form here at Union it seldom goes past theory. This is an amazing gathering of minds, a group of people whose at- titudes and ideas will influence many. If we treat the idea of feminism as an unimportant issue we are perpetuating the inequalities that exist. For those of you that seriously believe that the movement is an issue of the past I must point out the fact 'that the ERA did not pass. It was something that should have been simple, not at all controversial. I doubt that any of you would argue with me that women should have a constitutional guarantee of equal rights under the law. Those of you that argue that the movement goes too far must remember that all movements have their excesses. Supporting feminism does not include supporting radical feminists' statements. At the worst, feminism must be espoused on the personal level, if you do not want to go so far as the political level. But when 80 percent of all women who work hold down ''pink-collar\ jobs and get paid about 59 cents of a man's dollar, the question is not should you get involved, but how involved should you get. This question concerns all of us, including college students. The majol,\ity · of 'American college . students now are women, and yet the faculties instructing us are still mostly male. Here at Union we have only four women who hold positions as high as that of associate professor, where we have 50 percent female students. feminism on campus has not been, up til now, considered an important, or even very in· teresting, subject. People are forgetting what the fight is all about, assuming that it is over. We have not yet emerged victorious. There is still a long way to go. Whatever your personal f,eelings as to what men and women shoul(l be, for themselves and each other, social equality of the sexes under the law must be .sup- ported. This is not an argmnent, I think you will all agree, but a fact. DUELING OPINIONS SHOULD THE UNITED . STATES COMPROMISE FOREIGN POLICY OBJECTIVES IN WESTERN EUROPE IN ORDER TO STRENGTHEN NATO UNITY?

The entire week, from May 23 through 29, will become an outer-space adventure for the whole family, with young minds encouraged to soar. Schools across the state are already involved in preparations, making huge banners and other works of art for display, and thousands of people are expected to create their own. masks and head- dresses to turn themselves into out-of-space visitors to a fan- tastic Parade of· the Planets on Saturday, May 28. At one end of the Empire State Plaza, A Bride from Pluto, Gian Carlo Menotti's one- act extraterrestrial family opera, will be performed daily Monday through Saturday in the Main Theatre of the Egg.

Sports Staff This term'~ intramural boxing tournament was the highlight of the special events this year. Ample recognition should be given to the par- ticipants. There were three exciting bouts for an those who decided to attend. In the opening match, Carl Aiken, last year's champion, Scored a unanimous decision over Bob Stratton. The fight was scat- tered with blood while both fighters slugged it out in the end. 'I'he next bout saw Dave Schuman overtake Mark Armstrong who decided to fight at the last ininute. Dave's ex- perience overcame Mark's determination in anothey grueling battle. The surprise of the tournament'occurred when Brad Nicholson defeated three- time championJeffFiegelson in the heavyweight division. Jeff never seemed to get untracked as Brad hustled around the ring determined to revenge last year's loss to Jeff. Each match was full of excitement and good boxing. Special thanks go to Coach Ebbets, Coach Montana, and Pete Brown for judging, Joe Clinton for refereeing, Russ Wenner for tinling, and Gary Wenner for announcing; Each winner will receive an in- tramural spotlite trophy to cherish for the rest of his life.

Cqngratulations (/) to Andy Dreher. Andy DrE?her Rugby 'A' Wins Two - By-RUSS BACKHOUSE Sports Staff The Union Ruggers had two games this week. On Wed- nesday the A and B sides beat Hamilton College at Hamilton 23-6 and 12-0 respectively, and on Saturday the A's beat Albany Old Green RFC 24-0 while the B's lost 38-6. This boosts the A team's record to 9-3·1 with one game remaining against MIT in Boston. De~~ite the impressive scores, both teams played poorly on Wednesday as the ball was dropped frequently and Union played as in<Uviduals rather than as a team. 'Tries came from AaronSchlieffer (2), Russ Backhouse, and Tod Fobare. The game against Old Green was a much better affair. At half time, Union led by a narrow margin of 4-0. Both sides missed two or three penalty goals, and Doug Bal,lillgarten came close to .scoring on two occasions as he broke from the serum on 60 to 70 yard runs. In the second half, the team from Albany began to tire in the 80 degree heat, and Union's superior strength was evident. Within five minutes, breaks by Fobare and. Backhouse led to tries and the result of the game was no longer in doubt. The rest of the points came from tries by Fobare and Baumgarten, while John Tierney astounded everyone with a 50 yard sprint outpacing three men before being brought down inches from the lines. Other good per- formances came from Dave Beal, Mark Soloway, and Steve Paterson. Robert Appointed ByGAC-SID ..... Sports Staff Charlyn Anne Robert has been appointed to the Union College coaching staff effective July 1, 1983, it was announced by Union's director of athletics, Richard Sakala.

In the fall this reporter commented upon occasion 011_ the fortunes of Unio~'s best football team in years. Interspersed amongst my winter articles were many references to Skating Dut- chmen hockey and Dutchmen Hoop squads. This spring we've picked up Sports Talk and read about such interesting subjects ranging from spring training in Arizona to the intramural front. Touchirlg all these bases over the last year I've failed to. write about those athletes here at Union that are often over· shadowed and taken for granted. You rarely see stan· ding room only crowds at their games and often must dig deep in:to the back pages of local papers to find their respective results. If you have not guessed who I am talking about, they are the many women athletes that represent our school at the intercollegiate level. In the fall Union fields Dut- chwomen teams in soccer, volleyball, tennis, field hockey, and cross country. Women's field hockey enjoyed one of their best recent campaigns and a gal named Holly Howard had a lot to do with it. Holly was a four year letterwinner and captain of last fall's 7-6 squad. Like many of the star women athletes on campus, Holly doubles as a star on another Dutchwomen team. She holds Union Lacrosse scoring records for single season and career. Holly was honored recently with the Senior Athletic Prize. The award is given annually to that senior who has done the most to promote sports for women at Union. Holly is most deserving of this award and will be sor..ely missed in Schenectady next fall. Both the 'Dutch women Tennis and Cross Country teams are becoming powers in the state. Runners like Inge Stockman and netters like Julie Miller have played major roles in the advancement of these two very promising programs. Having just mentioned Julie Miller's name, I will be repetitive in also mentioning that she too- doubles as a two sport athlete at Union. In the winter Julie graces the fieldhouse court for the Dut- chwomen hoop squad. Only a junior, Julie has started in each of her first three years at Union. Much like Holly, Julie was also recently presented with the Eastern College Athletic Conference Medal of Merit. The award is handed out each year to that junior woman athlete who combines talent on the field with excellence in the classroom. Julie still has a year to go and who knows what she has lying ahead in her future as a Dutchwoman.. Another standout that deserves mention when talking Union women's basekt ball is junior Cay Lynch. Cay has been the team's leading scorer over th~ past three years and shows a career mark of 803 total pofuts. Cay is also one of the very . few three sport athletes at Union. In the fall she tries her hand at field hockeY while in the spring she give· lacrosse a go. Cay recently wa~ awarded with the Athletic Promise Award. This is a very coveted award given out to an underclasswoman each year. Names like Howard, Stock- man, Miller and Lynch are all synonymous with excellence in women's sports at Union. Just like their male counterparts, they go out daily to put in the long gruelling hours of practice needed to field competitive teams. Just like Union's Dut- chmen, these Dutchwomen give up valuable time that could be spent both academically and socially because of their desire to excel on the fields of com- petition. But unlike their male counterparts, these women athletes gain little or no recognition for the fine job they do. :Sure we publish weekly , articles on the fortunes of the I many women's teams but seriously, how many of the campus community really take the interest one step further and go out one afternoon· to patronize their Dutchwomen. Even off the fields of com- petition, girls are continually working to help upgrade women's sports at Union. Funding for women's athletes at Union is even less of a priority to the school than that of the meager funds dished out each year for many of the non- \Top Three\ sports at Union (football, hockey and basket- ball). Because of this reality girls like Holly Howard are leading the Way for the many fund-raising events and ser- vices sponsored by the girls each yea:r. One would have to say · that a gal like Brenda Hugick would have to stand for the true dedication of many of the women athletes at Union. Brenda, amazingly, has earned her varsity letter for four straight years in volleyball, basketball and softball. I bet you didn't know that before reading Sports Talk today. The 1983 Lacrosse MVP Steve Myers scored 17 goals and dished out 14 assists in his senior season.

Despite the disappointment of a below .500 season, the Dut- chwomen accomplished many _things this season including being the first Union team ever to host and participate in the New York State AIAW cham- pionships, Union, seeded eighth in the AfA W event· the weekend of May 6, played an outstanding game in losing to No.1 seed, and eventual champion, Cornell, 12- 4. It was the first time in the history of women's lacrosse at the Schenectady College that the squad had ever played a team higher than Division III, The 1983 season was one in which the Dutchwomen came close to victory on many · oc- casions, but were unable to come up with the big play. The team lost five games by four goals or less. \I thought we played well at times, but we certainly lacked consistency,\ said sixth-year coach Martha Morrison. \Overall I thought we had some great individual per- formances. However, they just were~'t enough to make up for the weak spots we had.\ One of the brightest stars for the Dutchwomen,. this season, and for .the past feur season~, was senior attackwoman Holly Howard. Howard led the team in goals for the fourth con- secutive season as she scored 32 despite playing a total of three games in. goal. The economics major, who holds the College's single-season record with 44 goals set in 1981, ends her brilliant career with a Union- record 147 goals. Another senior, Emily Monosson, completed het finest season in the past four years as she tallied 21 goals. The rest of Union's graduation losses will be ~on defense where seniors Ber- nadette Albanese, Sue Bloomberg, Sue Ensel, Mary BethFoisy, andBethMeyer will be leaving starting positions. Next year's attack will be anchored by junior Cay Lynch, who in her first full season on the varsity scored 23. goals. Lynch stole the limelight in the AJAW tournament when she scored five .of Union's total goals. Preshman Bonnie Faulkner and sophomore Kathy Furst both had fine seasons while the College's top female freshman athlete, Rebecca Clemente, split time between the v~rsity and junior varsity squads.

Celehration Toombs ( 1828) was Secretary of State for the Confederacy and Seward (1820) was Secretary of State for the North. Toombs became the chief clerk for Jefferson navis and soon after the war resumed a law practice. Seward left a more notable mark in history. He was governor of New York, United States Senator, Secretary of State. and (his most famous accomplishment) was responsible for the purchase of Alaska. his birth and paternity were both carefully and successfully concealed. He was graduated from Union in 1832. Early in his life he inherited a considerable fortune which enabled him to travel extensively. It was said that no other American of his period knew so many European notables as Wikoff. His interests were many-- politics, diplomacy, journalism and theatre--· so that he never found time to concentrate on any , one. The Reminisences of an Idler ( 1880), his most important literary production, included many charming anecdotes and profound observations of his life prior- to 1840. He wrote of his years at Princeton, \I doubt if I could have learned less if I had been allowed- to linger four years longer in Princeton, and to bask in idleness under the lofty shade of the fine old campus, the pride of the college,'' so much for the academic quality of Ivy League schools.

Page C In Honor of Mrs. Perkins FHL takes great pride in honoring • 'one of the striking figures in the college world,'' Anne Dtmbar Perkins;. In what year was she graduated ·from Union? Sbe was born in Natchez, Mississippi, in 1835, so her graduation certainly did not occur during Union's short history of co-educational study. Mrs. Perkins· (as she is 'affectionately· known) \lived on the college ei:unpus for a long time-- almost sixty years--and ~he remembered figures and scenes in the history of the College that _have become historical and almost legendary.'' This involvement and knowiectge; a~ well as her lasting contribution of her Garden (right next door to the Skellar) make.s her - noteworthy enough in the eyes of FHL to be honored on his great day~ It is not what you know but who you know in this world that matters, and this is no exception in Mrs. Perkins' case. She was the wife of • 'one of Union's most loved and respected professors\ · (Professor Maurice Perldns) as well as the mother-in-law of Professo'r Hale (of Hale House fame} with whom Mrs. Perkins res.ided after the death of her husband. Other famous acquaintances of. hers who' had buildings named after th.em include the famous Dr. Nott and his wife (who didil't have a building .named a-fter her, but managed to get a dUpl'icate house to that of the President ··s (the current Administration building) built so that she wou1d :not have to move after .ner hu:sband's death), Dr. Potter, Dr. Webster, Dr. Raymond, and her friend in gardens, Dr. Jackson. She witnessed the College's recovery in the post-Civil War reconstruction period, including the divided loyalties of two Union alums--both .of the Civil War Secretaries of State were Union · graduates. Remarkably enough, she was still an active member of. the campus community during its cele,bration of Union's centennial. But what of Anne Dunbar, Perkins, the woman? ·As summarized in a previous tribute to her, it was said that \Mrs. Perkins was a woman of very striking character. She had very great- powers of appreciation of the beautiful in life, both of such things as could be seen and felt and the more spiritual things of life. She loved to surround herself with beautiful things and her parlors and her flower garden were an index of her taste and will be remembered by all who knew them. She cared deeply for all sorts of artistic things, especially painting and poetry; she had read much and travelled a great deal so that, as --she had a remarkable memory, she had a broad .acquaintance with the art, one might say of the world. These powers and opportunities joined to her remarkable powers of imagination made her a most striking and agreeable companion, for she was interested in a very wide range of subjects and coUld talk well on many things. Her perception and appreciation in these matters, as well ~s in those of art, were deep and vital and she was always ready to defend or explain tpe faith that was in her. All in all a very remarkable woman . . . '' and one that FHL honors with great pride. So join with FHL in celebrating with him the memory that still prevails of the love fpr life that was Anne Dunbar Perkins.

It is a > •• . ' weekend of activities, fun and reminiscing, which culminates on Sunday with the actual commencement exercises. This year's Re-Union Weekend runs from Friday, June 10 until Sunday, June 12. Classes .in increments of five years are invited, starting with the class of 1978 and going back to 1973, 1968, 1963, etc., all the way to the oldest returning alumni, Milton Wend, from the class of 1913. The planned ac- tivities. are varied, and many are open to the current seniors for participation. The weekend will begin with an Alumni Golf Tournament at 9:00 a.m. Friday. At 1:30 p.m. that same day, Minerva's Race will be run, beginning at Garis Field. This is a. pair of foot races, also open to seniors, on the Union College Cross Country Course, either one or three miles long. Special alumni prizes are awarded at the finish line of the three-mile run · ac- cording to the person's year of graduation. All finishers of either race will be rewarded with a Minerva 1 s Race T-shirt. Also, during the day, a campus tour will be conducted and \A Union of People\ will be shown at 3:39. That evening, Class Re- Union Dinners will be held for each represented class, and later that evening is an Alumni Gala-Fest at the Girling C~nter. After Saturday morning's Estate Affairs Breakfast- Seminar is the Re-Union Class Photographs at 10:00 a.m., where the alumni dress in the costumes that they will be wearing in the parade to .follow. Immediately after the photographs is the Alumni Parade which begins on Alexander Field. Marching is by class, and seniors are invited to march, traditionally in graduation robes and caps. Trophies are given for the highest number in the parade (the Anable Cup), the highest percentage of alumni returning which will be determined by the number of living alumni (the McClellan Cup), and the best costume (the Van Voast Cup).

Page 2 CONCORDIENSIS, May ~.6, 1983 Win Thurlow Elected Student.Body President By JUDIE STEINHARDT News Staff On /Friday, May 20, junior Winthrop Thurlow was elected president of the Student f()rum for the 1983-84 year. His ,plat- form reflected an interest in the student body as a whole and its interaction with the various campus institutions. Thurlow explained that he views Union as a three-part entity which consists of faculty, ad- ministrators, and students. He believes \the Student Forum is the body from which the students speak.\ Aware of the need for more student input into the Forum he plans on utilizing his positien as president to get more of the student population to voice their ideas. · Thurlow seeks to use the Student Forum to diminish some of the apathy among student$ and make them more aware of the issues that affect them. He has several Ideas on students, faculty,· and ad- ministration,'' Thurlow remarked. Heseees the Student Forum as the place in which anyone, from. every aspect of campus life, can have something to say about the system of rwming the school. With~n the Forum its~lf, Thurl()W wants to build on the improvements mad¢ by this year's presiclent, Uene Lan- dress. He says, \In the past, the Student ·Forum has been torn Coul-ses Cut Nationwide \The only way we can he effective is if we all work t()getller. That includes students, faculty {CPS) Freshman Uarty Szumsky figured he was lucky to get into a filled-to-capacity film class at tlte University of Illinois. But when he showed up for the first class session at the beginning of this term, he found out the course had been axed at the last minute. About 500 other students at Illinois similarly found them- selves locked out of scheduled foreign language, business and technical writing courses. In all, over 30 courses vanished. They vanished not because of low enrollment or a shortage of teachers. They vanished because the Illinois State Government abruptly made the university give back $7.1 million to try to balance the listing state budget. And it's happening at many schools across the country this spring, especiaUy now as students pre-register for fall term. With state budge.t cuts con- tinuing and more course cut- backs promised for the fall, registration at many public colleges this season is more of a zoo than normal, various ad- ministrators are reporting. Even choosing courses and following degree. plans have . become highly uncertain ac- tivities, students are com- plaining. \As funds get tighter, more and ·more institutions are having to eliminate certain courses of study, and sometimes without a lot of notice,'' observes J.D. Conner, head of the American Association of College Registrars and Admissions Officers. At. the University of New Mexico, for example, course cutbacks and rumors of nnore cuts to come caused mass confusion at summer registration and fall pre· registration the last week of April, reports the Daily Lobo, the student newspaper. UMN Dean Julian White, recalling one student who pitched a tent outside the , registration building to assure himself of getting a rare course . he needed, conceded there was \initial confusion\ over war- nings that students would have to check later to see if some of the courses they formally got are eventually cancelled. · Students trying to register recently at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln also ended up confused and frustrated. University of Delaware ad- ministrators are equally con- cerned by students who are \over-registering\ for classes, apparently to compensate for classes that may not exist by the time they return in the fall, says Provost L. Leon Campbell. \We really don't know what the fall schedule will look lik~,\ he admits. ''It's a constant problem.\ · Such student wariness comes from experience. \Many students were ad- vance-enrolled for courses last semester/' says Illinois Admissions Director Gary Englegaun, ''and then suddenly they were told, 'Wait a minute, you don't have a class any more.' That can connplicate things a little.\ For Szumsky, \It came down to picking a course I didn't hate. 'Ballroom Dancing' was not exactly my first choice.\ \There's been a kind of rippling effect as the number of students waiting for a par- ticular course swells,\ points out Edward E. Sullivan of the· university's Humanities school. \B] turning away students one semester, you put them in with all the other students who are waiting for a course, and soon you have a serious bot- tleneck,\ he says.

But most schools are try'ing to help students survive the course crunch and registration con- fusion. ''.Every school I know is making every allowanee it can to help students through this,\ Conner summarizes. It is, in any case, a far cry from the registration problems ,of a decade ago. \I recall in the sixties and seventies when it wasn't a question of money,\ Delaware's Gouldner says wistfUlly. \It was a question of how many instruetors we could get and how many courses they could teach to meet the needs of so many students.\ how to do this: £ifst, to get more input from the dorms, he would like the president of the dorm councils from each dorm to attend Student Forum meetings. He would also like to . hold some of the meetings in the dorms. themselves in order to encourage student par- ticipation. Another idea is to have the president of each of. the fraternities attend meetings. A last idea is meant to keep students updated on the ac- tivities of the Student Forum-- that is, publicizing the at~ tendance and voting records <Jf their representatives on the Forwn in some way. Thurlow greatly emphasizes this · need for a more \cooperative effort amang aU students of the school.\ · '.'The only way we can be effective is if we all work together. That includes apart by lack of unity. This year was atime of pulling together .. . the time has come to move ahead _ . . \ He wants to ·com- plete the job of uniting the Forum, which was. successfully begun this yar. His policies calling for cooperation include the members of the Student Forum as well as those of the student body. Thurlow's goals for the Student Forum predict an increase in student par· ticipation which has been. lacking for a long time. When asked about the possibility of drawing up the long awaited by-laws to the student government con- stitution, Thurlow stated, \I think it is imperative that we start the new year with .by-laws .. It is my hope to run the forum in a very s.tructured manner and without by-laws we really-won't have a structure with which to work.\ Bienni.al Report on Affirmative Action at Union Col.leg~ (Summary) by Margaret H.

Athletes Disappointed . ' By MARCY BURSTINE,R NewsEdJtor 11 The .banquet and awards system for Block U is not a budgeted item,\ replied· Dick Sakala when asked ·why there would he no athletic banquet this year. The question arose after a number of . athletes became upset when they were notified that no awards ceremony would . be held. Sakala, director of the Athletics Department, stressed that no money from the athletic budget ever goes towards B.Iock U. added on, brings. that figure to over $3,000. Depending on the nuniber of people attending the banquet, sueh a ceremony could cost anyWhere from $1;500- 2,500. 1 '[ don't think .it ·penetrated into the minds of students that we have to earn the money for the awards and banquet,'' Ms. Morrison remarked. Monosson, and Holly Howard. Although two other students, Juniors Sharon Pearl and Gary Wenner also helped out con- siderably,. it was evident on the most part that \interest just wasn't there.\ \They didn'.t realize ... what the situation really was ... until they see figures in black .and white, until they see the bill, they cannot picture how ex- .pensive it is,'' she explained.

It is a f:undraising service organi~ation designed to recognize student athletes, Union, he ~ommented, is one of ·Very few scMols left in the country that still have. awards ·ceremonies at tbe end of the This year the Block U society faces a '''CONSIDERABLE DEFICIT,'' Sakala pointed out. He added:, hOwever, that this is not the first year that .a deficit existed. ~ \'Last year we struggled to get through the year,\ he · explained. Ms. Morrison added that two years ago the society .also faced budget problems. ''I think people think there is more money coming in tl;:lan there is,\ .she replied when asked to answer rumors that Block U funds had · been misplaced. Such charges are ''false,\ she declared. ''There has been no fund to misplace.\ Salaka added, however, that he does not wish to put the blame on the athletes. He realized that the games' and team practice are · time con- suming. He pointed out that the _ athletes work hard to earn their awards and letters and it may be unrealistic to expect them to then go out to raise money for these same awards. The .result was that the athletic department and the Block U Society had to choose between the award or the .ceremony. Housing Problems year. \\ An enthusiastic .group of athletes became involved in fundraising when the Block U Society was ~revived, Sa~ala explained. ''We defined the awards system,'' They decided at the time what qualifications would determine letter and award winners. In addition, they became involved in fun· draising activities. \Expensesbegan to outweigh income,\ he further explained. Apparently more and . more athJetes become eligible to receive awards each year, as the number of athletes in- creases. In addition, inflation makes the job of raising money. everi more difficult. The awards alone cost ap- proximately $3,000 each year, explained Martha Morrison who coaches the women's field hockey and lacrosse teams. This ye;:~r ~.the watches cost about $1,700 and there were 39 seniors- eligible to win them. The figure each ye~ar, she went on, depends on how ·many athletes qualify. The cost of the blankets and le~ters, when ''The money just doesn't come in to . begin ,with,\ she reiterated. She poirited out that bake sales generate about$30 a week and for three ten week terms. the most the society can earn is $900. Concession stands at basketball games can earn the enormous sum of anywhere fr.om $5-40 and: the ice hockey benefit game can generate about $280. . \We're lucky ifwe made $12• 1500,\ . she remarked. \I don't think the athletes realized it . . . we told them we need money or the banq11et and awards would be in jeopardy.\ Questionairres were sent out to all athletes in the beginning ~f the year and only ten percent were returned. Meetings were held, she con- tinued, but at the most seven people attended. Only four students consistently attended. These students, Ms. Morrison remarked, were Seniors Susan · Ensle, Bernie Albanese, Emily C.onduct Figures Released By MICHELLE NOVELLE News Staff According to Dean Michael Andolina, the Conduct Com• mitte.e has been ve:ry successful in handling cases such as sexual hartassment, physical assault, •and agression. A recent statement was published by the Executive Committee of_ the Faculty which strongly recommends the fo11owing course of action in .cases in- volving physical assault on campus: We must remind ourselves that there is no place at Union for individuals or groups who seek to distinguish themselves by physic~l intimidation of others. Without hesitation,. therefore, Union College must~ place. under sharpest censure any member of its eorrununity who seriously threatens physical harm to others; anQ., without hesitation, the College must remove from membership in the community any member who has more than once seriously threatened to commit physical harm. As the elected representative of a faculty charged by the Board of ·Trustees with the repsonsibility to 'cultivate an intellectual and scholarly atmosphere on the campus,' we. urge that the following policies be adopted immediately. \Any individual .student who .has more than once seriously threatened phys~cal assault shall be sununarily expelled. First offenders against this . principle of conduct shall be subjectto a substantial fine and placed. on strictest probation. Any group of students whose actions have more than once presented the threat of physical assault shaJl be subject to the strictest disciplinary action that the College can legally apply to a group. Groups which commit a first offense shall likewise be subject to fine and strict probation, as will groups which tolerate or ignore acts of violence committed on the group•s premises. Although the above statement deals primarily with physical assault on the campus, Dean Andolina stated that the vast - majority of cases are minor infraction such as passing meal cards to friends, underage drinking, and not exiting a building during a fire drill. The punishment for these various cases ranges from probation to suspension. Suspension can be as minimal as a term or as long as a year. In the past there have been very few cases of expulsion. The conduct code has been revised so that the punishment meets the crime, whether minor or major. A list of this year's statistics . for the conduct curnmittee has been made available. SEE BOXES, PAGES 2 and 3 Union is a small college, Ms. Morrison emphasized. Unlike a large university such as UCLA, people here ''do not get hot and bothered about basketball or w9men's field hockey ... \ The athletic department does n9t like to keep hitting the college community for money.'' Unfortunat~ly, she continued, students are ·not from the local area and students are reluctant to raise money off campus. This year marks the last for the fundraising efforts of Block U. According to Sakala, an attempt is being made to budget the cost of the awards into an organization known as Friends ofUnion Athletes (FUA). It is an organization made up of alumni and parents and was designed as a booster organization to encompass all sports. \I can't guarantee there will be enough (money),\ Sakala added. He commented that although he will try to continue the awards tradition in the future, it could not be guaranteed. ''In today's economic climate it has become more difficult for schools to continue giving out awards.'~ ByLYNNHANO News Staff The housing problem ap• parent in recent years in the crammed conditions of five person suites for freshman and the. lack of housing for males will soon be remedied by the addition of · 51 doubles in the basements of Fox and Davidson dorms. There will be 25 rooms located in the north. wing of Fox and 26 in the south wing of Davidson. Dave Wood, from residence life, says the rooms will be made to accommodate the students. The average square footage of the rooms will be 238 square. feet (14 x 7), similar to the rooms in South College. Construction of the rooms will begin immediately after graduation and all heavy construction and landscaping will be completed by opening day in the fall. The rooms will be ·ready for occupancy by winter term. The two wings will be all male primarily because of security measures (rooms located at ground level are easier to break into) and because of the need for male housing. The first people to be designated to live in the new rooms will be the fifth person in freshmen suites. Those freshmen who return their housing contract late are - usually put in as a fifth in a suite. There will also be upper classmen consisting of transfer students and students coming back from terms abroad. Wood says that he has been working with the architects to create· nice rooms that \promote a positive student life.\ The entry way will be the same as the rest of the building and there will be a stairway off the main lobbies. Both floors will have a bathroom and a furnished lounge. They will be clearing away the dirt on these sides of the buildings so that the rooms will only be partially underground. They will have large windows 2lh by 5 feet, much like those in South, but they will be the kind that crank out. The rooms are well designed and will include flexible furniture and com- fortable lounge back desk chairs. There will be a built-in bulletin board in each room. The closets will be ]arge .and like most rooms throughout campus the colors will vary. Mr. Wood emphasized that these are the first rooms in which the students comfort and well being are being carefully considered in the construction. The Administrztion hopes that these basement rooms will alleviate the housing squeeze facing male students.

Page 4 OONOORDIENSIS, May !6, 1983 Class of 1847 Hears 1St Valedictorian Speak Editor's Note: In 1847, Joseph Sweetman of the class of l797, the first valedictorian to graduate from Union, came back 50 years later to speak to the graduationg senJors. In his speech, excerpts of which are printed below, he de~crlbes how the College had chauged, and be 'descr.lbes the f'lrst com- mencement exercise. Fift.y years ago! Schenectady was· then an ancient town. But few of the monuments of its antiquity remain. One who was familiar here at that time would now see but few things which have not been changed, and find but few people he could recognize as former acqu~tances. In the interval, the aged have passed away and a new generation has risen up. Old structures have disappeared and new erections occupy their places. Some things remain, and must continue till time shall be no more. The Mohawk still glides smoothly along in its wonted channel; but we no longer see on its banks ti:Ie ferrying place for the scow, nor the batteaux moving ,on its surface for he \far west.\ The hills around the city hold their station, but the hand of culture has been there and drawn its lines and produced its forms. The city is not what it was when we were here in the early days of Union College. Its limits are extended, its population in- creased, its appearance and usages changed. The location of the stone college was near the eastern extremity; the house, though riot then built; was contemplated, and it was thought its site would be beyond the noise and business of the -City: at that time only a few scattering houses were further east. The grounds now occupied by the Colleges on the hill, were but imperfectly cultivated and served principall¥ for pasture lands, abounding in fern, brambles and · simHar productions. The west part of the city has since that tiine been burnt down and rebuilt; Albany- street (now State-street) .has assumed almost an entire new form, and large additions have been made on the south. The interior part of the city, especially in the vicinity and along the borders of the canal, is altogether new-formed since the period te which we allude. The Dutch style of building was then cenunon throughout the city. The end of .the house .faced the street, unornamented save by a few figures to designate the time of its erection, placed high up near the junction of the long steep sides of the roof'; At the door for entrance was a plain stoop, accommodated with a seat at each end, and generally filled with social occupants in the summer evenings. The whole appearance bespoke convenience, was in- viting, and seemed to. say-this is the place of comfort, come and share in its enjOyments. The Dutch language wa$ commonly spoken in the domestic circle and the Dutch forms and manners and usages preserved great purity. The first Commencement was in May, 1797. The place of holding it, the old Dutch Church, now demolished, oc- cupying a position in the centre of the street, east of the Mohawk Bank. There, within its massive and venerable walls, sparingly receiving the light from without through the small squares of glass, on a cloudy and chilly day, the first Wed- nesday in May, 1797, was celebrated the first Com- mencement of Union College. But it was May-day and the \Seniors Graduate! Continued from page 1 Alumni Council Awards will also be made at this time. Alumni gold medals for special service will go to Joseph T. Donnan '23, Richard W. Angle '38, and Norton H. Reamer '58. Neal W. Allen Jr. will receive a Faculty -Meritorious S(lrvice Award, and an Alumni Council Appreciation Award will go to Mary P. Van Loan. That afternoon there will be an Alumni Picnic for all at the Girling Center. Also in the af- ternoon, a chimes concert will be held and \A Union of People\ will be shown again. At 5:30 the Re-Union Glee Club concert will be given in an anniversary. celebration for Hugh Allen Wilson. That evening, for dinner, the Steamship Round Buffet will be served at West College Dining Room. Reservations are suggested. Saturday evening is the Saturday Night Affair at Achilles Rink, with en- tertainment and dancing. Seniors and their parents will be the guests of the Alumni Office. Tickets are available at the Alwnni Office. The weekend culminates Sunday morning with a Bon Voyage Breakfast Buffet at West College Dining Room. After breakfast, the Com- mencement of the Class of 1983 will begin. All in all, this will be a weekend that will last in- the memories of the graduating seniors, as well as bring back memories for Union's many fine alumrii.

Staff The Career Development Center, prev-iously known as the Career Placement Center, has undergone new and innovative changes under the guidance of Joanne Tobiessen, Director of the Center. The Career Development Center focuses not only on helping to place seniors in their prospe<;tive jobs, but can also be of great assistance to :freshman and sophomores. Too many students do not realize what a great help The Development Center can be, especially to students who are undeclared,. and are un- certain of what the future holds for them. The Development Center can be thought of as a neutral explorer; without being pressured or pushed, one makes a self· .. assessment of himself in order to determine one's values, abilities and interests. Occupational skills such as communication, inter-personal, organizational, analytical and to a lesser degree numerical skills are _important to have, and the Development Center helps to determine the skills one is strongest in, and those which need to be further develoQed. -one's values_ are also deter- mined, and students who were unsure of career possibilities are now able to see a wide range of careers open to them. The Career Development Center helps students to explore these possibilities, and to develop the needed skills. The key to future success is to start developing important skills as freshmen, in order to broadly develop oneself, and to make oneself into a good candidate for future jobs. College Digest is a general information· and reader's service magazil::te. Jts appeal is to a sophistiC-ated, well- educated, well-informed audience attuned to cqllege issues. Each issue is composed of articles on a wide variety of subjects of specific and general interest, appealing to men and women, chosen to produce a balanced table of contents covering colleg:e;related topics in a concise form. Guide to Career ·Development The Career Development Center is a very helpful resource and one which should 'be better used. Many times students feel pressured into choosing a certain career, and thus are unable to see the many options and possibilities open to them. The Career Development Center also offers students much written information about different careers, and students are. encouraged to come over and read up on possible careers. The Career Development Genter sponsors career ob- servation days, in which students can speak to and ob- serve people working in a possible career choice. The Center also has a complete listing of alumni and their ~ careers, and students can contact them in order to find out more about a possible career. Students also gain valuable experience through internships and summer jobs, and the Development Center also helps students with this. ·.

In a lively, highly readable style, the Guide provides a summary discussion of pertinent iss11es, drawing on case studies of people already well placed in a variety of professions. It also contains up- to-date reference material on the future outlook for a wide range of occ11pations which have been identified as \hot\ prospects. A number of experts have offered their opinion.

The Guide is intended to serve as an introduction to the Dewar's Proflles of Americans at Work, a. series of reports now in preparation. Each Profile will focus on a single career, presenting the opinions . of ac- tive professionals in the field of their work, training and career paths, as well as lifestyles and aspirations. In this way the reports will document a living, highly focused sense of what working in each profession is like and what values it may have for those seeking entry at the present time. The first Profile of Computer Professiollals will be released shortly. Others underway or projected will focus on careers in finance-business, health care, education, com- municattons and other fields, assessing employment op- portunities and satisfaction levels· in each. The Center and all the materials bear the name of Dewar's \White Label\ because, according to Mel Winarsky, president of the importing company, ''Dewar's has long been committed to acknowledging the • ac- complishments of noteworthy, young professionals. It is, therefore, natural to extend our association in this public ser- vice direction, providing a career guidance assist to those seeking it.\ All Those interested in For those who already know Where they are headed, The Career Development Center can suggest ways to help build the skills in which they are weak in order to become a stronger candidate. · Everyone-not just seniors- should take advantage of the valuable services which The Career Development Center offers.

Volunteers Recognized Leisel Golden anrl Heather Mart en will be honored Thursday, May 2fi by the Schenectady c;irls Club at its annual Volunteer Recognition Dinner. Each will receive a Certificate of Appreciation for their work in the club's Com- puter Literacy Program. Leise! has been volunteering since September 1982 while Heather started in January 1983. The program was recently given the Girls Club of America's \Outstanding Program of the Year\ award at their annual convention. According to Sue .llarden, Computer Program Director at the Schenectady Girls Club,. \It is the volunteer effort of dedicated people like Leisel and ~ Heather who make the program successful.\ The biggest challenge for Harden was matching the class schedules to Union's. \If Leisel said she could make it only ()n Friday afternoons,'' Harden continued, \I would have a class set up for her on Friday afternoons.\ But that was a small price to pay for \the satisfaction of their presence,\ Harden added. \As college students and· women with technical interests, Leisel and Heather provide excellent role models for the girls they meet. We are very f()rtunate to have them around,\ she said. Earlier this year, I eisel, and Heather arranged a field trip to Union's Computer Center. This was a great op- portunity for the girls t.o compare their mini computer experience to the world of the large main-frame. The Girls Club has TRS-80 Color Com- puters. Recent studies have shown that young girls do not compete with boys for \computer time~\ Yet the exposure to computer use at an increasingly early age means that the future programmer and analysts are starting their coursework in kindergarten, not in high school. If girls are not en- couraged to participate, they will not be prepared to compete in the computer field when they are adults,\ Harden com- mented. Unlike most computer programs for children, the Girls Club's computer class are within the reach of low-income families, thus widening the scope of availability. The class sessions at the Girls Club run parallel to Union's tr-i-mester system. \We are always seeking in- terested individuals who care to s·hare themselves with youngsters for an hour or so per week,\ Harden said. Those interested should contact her at the Schenectady Girls Club at 374-9800. JUNIORS: We would like to know your opinion.

' OONOORDIENSIS, May $6~ 1988 Page 7 THE ARTS Theatre....- American Buffalo Reviewed By ROBIN MOLELLA $taff This weekend the, Nott was again alive with the soun{ls of Mama. If between Fox- Davidson, F'lji Island, and Theta Delta Chi's Southern Rock Party, you mtssed American Buffalo; you missed. some of the best acting on campus, and certainly the best student direction I've seen .. The production was mounted to fulfill the Directing II course requirement. It was directed by Tom Rice and starred Ken Altman as Walter Cote, also known as Tea ell; Lenny J{atz as Bob, ap.d James G. Motolanez as Don Dubrow. American Buffalo, bY David Mamet,. is set in a junk shop in present day Chicago. It is essentially a character study with little plat. What activity does exist. is centered around Review- plans for a robbery. The dialogue is extremely rough, the play includes vic;Jlence,the purpose is unclear, and the first act is slightly boring·. Over all the play was not among the best productions done at ·Union. On the other hand, it is not difficult to see what many critics have found laudable in Mamet's work. The play is a glimpse of reality, however sordid that reality may be. It examines humanity in its lowest form, expostng the needs and weaknesses of the characters, and allowing the audience to realize that these needs are not unique 'tQ the characters but rather ,part of hUinanity itself. The best part of the play are the char.actei\S' themselves .. Mamet has succeeded in creating characters tbat are believable, and human. Tom Rice has done a wonderful job of casting the show, using actors talented in their own rights, but also able to complement each other. Ken Altman should be credited with one of the best performances he's given while at Union. His talents will be missed next year. Neith.er Jim Motolanez or Lenny Katz has been extreme1y active in past productions but it would be a pleasure to see more of them both in the future. It will be a great loss. to Union to lose Tom Rice, when he at- tends New York 'University in the fall to further deve}Qp nis talents. He is wished the best of luck. · In closing the Union Arts Production of American Buffalo was a tribute to all involved. Hopefully all of us will be as successful in our final projects. Ken Altman starred in American Buffalo Student Recital After graduation in 1984, she plans to attend graduate school in the field of psychology. •Adult Fairy Tale, Quite Grim' On Wednesday, June!, at 7:30 p.m. Jill Bercow and Marcelle Diarnandis will present a joint piano recital. They will be performing works by Schumann, Scarlatti, Scriabin, Schubert and Albenix. The program also includes a Mozart sonata for four-hand piano. The concert will be held in the Arts .Building room 202. Both Jill and Marcelle are students of Pola Baytelman. Marcelle Diamandis has been active in the arts at Union. In addition to playing the piano, she is a member of Union's Dance Club. Her most recent performance was at the Parent's Weekend Dance-Arts Festival, for which she both choreographed and danced several numbers. Also, Mar- celle is a member of the Sigma Delta Tau Sorority. She is now a student in the Six Year Medical Program and will be attending Albany Medical College next fall. By ROBERTA RUBINSTEIN ArtS Editor It is rare that a relatively unknown auther comes out with a novel which can· move even the unemotional reader. Robert Cline's The Tattooed Innocent and the Raunchy Grnadmotber can do just that. It is a book which touches the senses on a level which some may find unco~f?rtabl~ .. ~_Beginning by convmcmg us of the innocence of the Imlocent and the raun- chiness of the Grandmother, Cline sets the reader' up for emotional blackmail. Who can resist the naivete of a neglected child? And who can remain unaffected by a lecherous grandmother? As for. the other characters; they are equally affecting. J. Humphrey and Lucette are hauntingly morbid. They are both thought to be the parents of the grandson that grandmother Millicent unintentionally drives into the depths of insanity, Though none of these charac- ters are tbe Innocent nor the Raunchy, they are helplessly drowning in both of these qualities. The tragic lives of Cline's characters painfully remind us of the tragedies in our own lives. In this sense the message becomes inescapable. If the character's dialogue is not in itself enough to com- municate the necessary emotions, the pitiful cir- cumstances surrounding their lives can do the trick. And if this still is not enough, the novel is filled with scattered comments made by the author himself: \Try to Jove my darling, reader. Try!\ -or \I sense dark undercurrents ... But•they need not affect you, Reader! Reach toward your dreams! Forge on! Think happy thoughts.\ - Toward the end Cline explajns, \Reader this has been a book of dreams - without which life Is nothing ... - And-don't worry about those people. I just made them up anyway • except for their filth. I'm really sorry about their filth.\ Although sometimes distracting, these additional communications of Cline's help to stress the significance of each character's life. Explaining that a character's thoughts cannot always convey the necessary messages, Cline ·attempts to defend his somewhat interruptive epilogs. But there is little need for such defense. Perhaps these un- traditional asides do not serve Union ,College Film Committee Fall 1983 Schedule WEEKENDS 9-16 - 9-lli-Blltch Cassidy and the Sun- dance Kid-7, 9, 11 9-23-9-25-48 a:ours-7, 9, n 9-30-10-2-The Chosen-7, 9,11 10·7 -10-9-Tootsle~7, 9,11 10-14 ·10..16-Gallipoli-7, 9, 11 1Q..21-1Q..23-8tarWars-7:30 1 10 1.0-28 •lft3~TheHunger-7, 9, fl 11-4·11-lh:jophie's Choice-7, 10 lHI- 11·13-Annie Hall-'7, 9,11 11-18 • 11·20--The Pink Panther Strikes · Again-7, 9,11 TUESDAYS 9-2Q-AmericanGraffiti-7·, 9, 11 9-27-Buddy Holly Story..:7, 9, 11 10-4-Tarzan the Ape M;m (1932)-7, 9,11 10·11-Meatballs-7, 9,·11 10-11!-URGH!

Jill also enjoys a variety of activities ranging from reading and writing, to work on the Freshman Record. Mountebanks-. There will be a reception following the performance. None of this is to suggest that the \Quite Grim, Adult Fairy Tale\ is flawless. A mixture of experiment ancf descriptive filth (which only sometimes needs apology - Are you certain . of its necefisity, Mr. Cline?), Cline's work sometimes fails. The-reader may find himself- herself becoming angry at the . autlror. Why must this be so tragic? Why must this be so filthy? Wby, indeed, must this be· so painfully real? As Cline himsel( recognizes, ''there's enough unhappiness in life without putting more into books. 11 Well, Readers do not always ask for \life through rose colored glasses,\ at least not in books. However, to bear a character into the depths of sorrow and then make his life more miserable with each passing ye~r, offends the senses to an even greater degree than the raunchy sex. Perhaps a little less blackness and a little. more rose. color might have been equally as effective and somewhat more satisfying. This is not to suggest an ending to the effect of, \and they lived happily ever after,\ but one must recognize the many alternatives between extremes. ''Two Very Good Plays'' In short, tragic and intense, Cline's is a brutal, sensitive, moving must for the reader with an open mind. Warm and inspiring, I will reread the novel. It is a two hour encounter well worth each minute. Oh yes. Oh yj:ls. Union College Coffeehouse presents: OWL WOOD Friday, May 27 8:30$1.50 Don't miss the last \Miss Margarida is a ball buster! 11 She is also a side- Splitter and a big belly laugh. This one woman play, produced on Broadway with Estelle Parsons in the title role, is being done in the Nott tonight, Friday and Saturday as part of two one- act plays. Lora Nelson is Miss Margarida, and she is very good. The subtitle of the play is a \Tragicomic Monologue for an Impetuous Woman.\ The emphasis here is on the comic. Miss Margarida is your eighth grade school teacher. She is everybody's eighth grade school teacher. The only problem is that she does not teach in a manner befitting eighth grade. She teaches in a manner which is part mother, part prison guard, and part prostitute. When she teaches Biology she threatens to do what every little boy wanted their teacher to do-take off her clothes. She teaches Math in a fashion that leaves you breathless. The play which was written by Roberto Athayde, is directed by Daro Beninati who does an admirable job in view of the fact that there is just one character. The audience is the class and Coffeehouse . . . . as such participation may be required. \Where's Emmitt?\ is the second part of this double-bill and is as good as \Miss Margarida's Way\. This is also a one character play. But it is a dialogue instead of a monologue. Adam Storke plays Johnny Cavanaugh, an actor, and Chris Gaynor is The Voice. Their interplay is amazing, especially so since Mr. Gaynor is ·off-stage and can only be heard 1 hrough a speaker. The play takes place in a room with a bed. A very simple set for a very, very complex . play. It deals with Johnny Cavanaugh's inability to separate reality from the roles that he has played, and his replaying of various charac- ters. It is a psychological drama that requires intense con- centration because each line tells you something more about Johnny Cavanaugh. This play was also directed by Mr. Beninati, who was also the playwrite. This is the first. time that it has been repr 'duced anywhere. Even if you are looking for- ward to seeing all the bands for Camp Union you should take time out some night to see these plays. They are free. However, due to the nature of the plays, which include violence, nudity, and profanity, no one under the age of 17 will be admitted without parent or guardian. of the l:. ·~f'.E .._ ____ te._·r.m_.!.-! .__.....,. ~: ~t!Ef~: '?' ... : . . . - . . ·, . . . . . . . .

Why after eight long playing recordS, several singles that brushed the charts and years and years of hard touring work they haven't blossomed into formidable pop stars is a question Research might soon tackle. It's certainly not their fault. This band plays everything! . · They're delightful on stage and on record; they run throu,gh a myriad of styles, starting with early New Orleans j'azz a~d R&B, chugging into rockabilly withOut batting an eye, then messing with the Beach Boys on their own surf, and in the end, meshing folk; atonal jazz, country· western .tumbler bits, novelty tunes -and kiddie-wink songs with .startling morning freshness. My best typewriting friends would gladly throwtheir old Royals out the window to join a band like this one, justfor the sheer fun and pleasure of playing and singing like NRBQ. Start with the old records-if ·you can find them in cutout slot$ or used record stores-and work up to the new ones.

Some have called it a pop masterpiece. It is. Now they'l'e on Red Rooster Records, distributed by Rounder-those great folks who brought ycm George Thorogood. Their last two LPs :for Rooster, Kick Me Hard and the brand new Tid· dlyw.htks, show no signs of stagnation, either. They rock 'li' roll steadily, and the spry and -sitty nuances from keyboard player Terry Adams and the group's wacky tabacky horn section, The Whol'e Wheat Horns, turn up surprising progressive jazz ideas, from Monkish vamps to cool sax squawks. Plus, their innocent approach to the whole ()f American popular music is always imbued with that rock 'n' roll :magic John Sebastian was. trying to tell stranger~ about. NRBQ's long-awaited mid- west debut the weekend of October 23-25 down in the overheated Whole Coffeehouse at the University proved that there are still unexpected rewards for the diligently patient..

As one of the most long standing student activities, Concordiensis must go on record as being .appalled at a serious example of ineptitude on the part of our student government--the failur:e to produce a most needed set of bylaws. Had th:ings gone according to schedule, the byla,ws would have been completely prepared a. full term ago. We have seen one stall after another, excuse on top of excuse. As a result, another year ends with no student activity guidelines other than the traditional h ear.say that has governed us for too long. The Forum is forced to make decisions based on what has always been done, but with no concrete document for supporting itS actions. How long can we continue to operate like this? lf tll..e U.S. Supreme Court began enforcing laws that existed only in the minds of the justices, would we not revolt? The creation, approval and implementation of bylaws must be the number one priority for the newly elected Forum. A constitution gives a government its basis for existence. Open Dorm Doors The orientation committee has to return to Schenectady well in advance of the date the freshmen arrive, and has apparently cast aside consideration for upperclassmen who don't happen to be part of that unique group. Non-freshmen, at somebody's whim, shall not be allowed into their residence halls until the Monday after 'orientation begins. Th~s proclamation imposes a great deal of inconvenience on parents who must · drive students and all their paraphernalia to Schenectady. Since some people still work a five day week, they will have to take that Monday or Tuesday off, rather than being able to bring their son or daughter back to Union on the weekend. This policy, though probably designed to help freshmen better integrate into the campus life, could not be worse for upperclassmen. Parents already pay $12,000 a year. An extra day off from work or a· night's motel bill jus~ might be too much. LETTERS --~--------~~i~--~--------~--------~--------~~----~------~---- .. Clinton Speaks Out · To the Editor As a member of the Women's Commission and faculty sponsor of. the Women's Net- work for the past three years. I have witnessed a number of eases involving violence against women. I believe the Dean of Students Office has handled individual cases in .a respon- sible and effecti.ve manner. ·However, over the past eighteen Jnonths a series of incidents (attempted. rape resulting in crimiilal.charges being pressed, .a screaming woman iulprisoned : behind a locked, guarded· door, lind now this past weekend .multiple Injuries resulting from \pranks\) have led me t.o believe that the Administration must take a sfr()ng · stand . . . . . . against violence and threats of violence fostered 'on this campus. This stand cannot ..be simply empty rhetoric, but decisive action to demonstrate to the campus comR1unity that any individual or group Which fosters such behav.ior will be expell~d. Various investigat-ions and .hearings may be iinportant preliminary steps to remedying the situation, but the Administrati(m has a respon- sibility not simply to report inddents and violations to tbe national headquarters of local ch.~pters of organizations found· guilty of improper conduct, but to kick such organizations of£ CaiJ1PUS. The current climat.e cf violence can no longer be chalked up to \fraternity ·hlJiriks'' bUt must be put into itS' proper context. If· any group· is . .unwilling to abide by the rules · <1f the . college, then. thE,it organization forfeits its rigllts. Women pay the same tUition as men and female un· . dergrad~ates should m,>t be subjected to the barrage of slurs, threats and assaults pouring forth from cettain quarters of the campus. The d~mage .(bot~ psychPlogic~l and phystcal) 1s not merely to these individual women, but the · entire co'llege community suffers. We need action, proof of commitment, not mor.e promises, policies, memorandums or meaningles~ words. Catherine Clinton, From The Presid,ent-Eiect · To the Editor: Now that the invigorating challenge and exhausting grind of the Student Forum elections is over, a number of things come to mind that would seem to appropriate to say. The period between election and the taking of office is a time that should be spent setting goals, planning . priorities and acknowledging those people who played important roles during the campaign. Please permit me to do a little of each now. Firstly, let me thank all those who were supportive and helpful to ,me · during the campaign. l:lad it not been for your support, I would not be in the fortunate position that I find myself in today. Let me also apologize to everyone that I pestered ad nauseum to get out P . . ICDIC Criticized Again To the Editor: I am writing this letter as an addition to, or perhaps as a clarifier for, a letter that ap- . peared in last week's Concordy regarding the Sigma Chi Clambake. This extremely _popular, greatly anticipated picnic, aside from being \tasteless tacky and disgusting\ was . the greatest display of blatant sexism and the most overt act of degradation of women I've yet to witness within the Union College, commwlity. I am not wholy blaming Sigma Chi, for if the women of Union had. refused to compromise themselves by participating in such \fun and games\ as \pass the orange and the bottle between the legs\ and \belittle your girl friends by blindly spraying whipped cream at them as they lay prone beneath you,\ then there would have been no such occurrences. What is utterly inexcusable to me though above and beyond the sexist and•or sex:ual events that my fellow students par- ticipated in; was the bonus points which the judges allotted to the team with the biggest breasts. To me, this is an abomination. It' is even worse than the \baby bottle chug,\ in which women from each team compete. against one another to see who can m()st rapidly empty a baby bottle of its· ibeer, a char:mjng even in and of itself, and even mote appealing to witness when accompanied by and vote~ If it is any consolation to you all, rest assured that I won't be asking .for your votes again (in the near future). · More importantly, let me also ta:ke a moment to acknowledge Larry Castelli and Gary Lehr •. I was indeed honored to be a _ candidate among such well- qualified and sincere op- ponents. I could not. have run against two more hard-working and dedicated individu~ls. My only regret is that the Forum will be lacking their much needed input next year~ Turning now to next year's Forum, let me say just a few words. I am encouraged by what i see as a renewed spirit and concern among students at Union. The seeds of student participation and awareness have been pi anted. ft is my hope that next year's Forum will encourage a renaissance of • student activism. Difficult decisions face us all and it .is only through discussion and debate that viable solutions can be found. 1\ll!lY 1983-1984 sound the death knell for that millstone around our necks- apathy. · -· Finally, let me turn to you, the college community. Student government is only as good as- · its participants. The goals and aspirations are ours. Let me send a call to very student, faculty member and ad- ministrator. Please feel free to come to me or any member of the ' Forum with your com- plaints, concerns and frustrations. Let's work together for a better Union.

The Clambake itself is a wonderful thing - a .giant pic- nic, with good music, sun and fun, and reasonably priced clams. My objection lies in the Derby Day activities, which are unnecessarily sexist. I should think. there are other w:ays to raise money than through . making women look and act ridiculous. As . it stands, I feel · that Derby Day should no longer go under the guise of \good clean fun for charity,\ · for while it may benefit a local charity, .it is setting the women's movement spiralling backward in time. oThank you very much, • Ftenee Haber • • • And The Rebuttal ., .. To the Editor We are writing this letter in regard to the subject of the . Sigma ChiClambake. A student wrote into this publication criticizing th~ events that en- .tailed the 15th Annual Charity Clambake. - .... Once again I am disappointed by a fellow student's haste to · criticize such a worthy event without knowing the whole stol'y. Well, Ihope.to inform the campus community ()f the full story that the criticizing student ofone week ago failed to relate. As mentioned early in her letter , her criticism, ''focused on the .. . ideas and accompanying .at- titudes that were the basis of .what took place\. . We, the Brothers of Sigma Chi are ,proud to be able to put on the longest-running campus- , wide party for the enjoyment of . all who wish to attend. The main purpose of the Bake is to raise money for local and national charities. This year, because of · the har~ work and ensuing . success of the Bake, we will be able to donate over $1000 to the Wallace Village in Colorado for the mentally retarded. How could such an event raise so much money for charity? \ One answer is the in-· volv:ement of over . 160 girls . in the Derby Day Events. The criticizing student gave a fine description of many of the field events that girls participated in at the Bake. Sure, these events stray a bit away from those at your neighborhood church picnic, but to all tnose who , enjoyed competing in them they were a great way to go out, nave a good time and raise money for those who are not as fortunate as ourselves. Last year we only had 10 teams for Der:by Day. This year we had to expand the size of the squadS while also increasing the number of teams to 18. These girls all enjoyed the competition and we ask our critic of one week ago, \what's wrong with a little harmless fun?\ 'Our critic also failed to mention that all the girls on Derby Day teams sold raffle tickets throughout the week for the raffle held during all the fun at the Girling Center. Amazingly these gals raised over $1500 in their raffle sales efforts. We do ADMIRE this! Our Chimbake gave students the opportunity to get off campus for a few hours and enjoy themselves. So many times the routine and pressures of school get in the way of people's attempts to just relax and enjoy the spring. If it is \cool'' to have some harmless · fun while raising money for . others less fortunate than ourselves then I am glad that this event gave over 1;000 students the chance to be \cool'.'. And in reference to your criticism of the names for the teams of girls. They were all chosen by the girls par- ticipating on each team and were all chosen 'in good clean fun. Our critic seemed to believe that the 15th Annual Clambake did not reflect our school in a way that she approved of. We raised over $1000 for a worthy cause; we put in many long hours so students were able to enjoy a wonderful day under the sun and possi~ly release some of the energy that many of us have had with the poor spring. If this all resulted in a less than enjoyable .time for members of the campus commurrlty vve apologize and also wonder what our critics define both im- pressive and admirable. The Brothers of Sigma Chi New Direction For Orientation· · 'I'o the Editor: · This year, probably no other Union College Committee faces · a challenge as difficult as the Orientation Program. The • Orientation Committee designs, implements, and directs the overall Orientation Program. In the Fall, the ·New· York State mandate on legal drinking creates an entire Freshman Class that is ineligible to drink legally. Coupled with a \dry Orientation is the prospect that · the Annual Picnic at Girling · Center will be lo.cated on campus. The Committee ~ill usher in a new era of Orten- . tation at Union With its proposed schedule of activities. . 'This year's theme, \Discover . Union--A Tradition of · Excellence\ stresses new · ideals, such a~ class awareness . and unity, a stronger- sense of Union and its history and- . tradition, a better knowledge of , Schenectady and what it can offer, and an understanding of personal and , college ex- pectations. With these goals in mind, the focus of Orientation is directed toward the Freshmen and Transfers themselves. For· many years, Orientation was viewed as a great chance for upperclassmen to co~e ~P early, attend the ptcmc,. socialize, and enjoy the program. With the support of the Administration, Dean Mammola, and David Wood, Associate Dean of Residence Life, the Committee is at- _ tempting to persuade up· perclassme'n not to return early. Saturday and Sunday activities will be oc,cupied with specialized competitions that will culminate in the singling out of one group as \Orientation Group. of the Year.\ The relaxed mingling of up~ perclassmeri of years past will be. phased out. Alo~g with the absence of Student Recital alcohol. it is the hope of the Committee that upperclassmen will recognize the fact that there is little to return early to- and for those who still want to return early, in the future we urge you to apply {or an Orientation Advisor next Spring. , Orientation '83 ushers in a new age to Union College. A student body divided by dif- ferences in legality could present problems. The Com- mittee is working diligently to ensure that problems never occur by providing a smooth transition into campus life to the incoming student. With the support and understanding of the upperclassmen, the ob- jectives of the Committee will be greatly facilitated and the class of '87 will enjoy the best Orientation ever.

Gonzo entitled \Can We Free Schranasky?\ in which the author demanded to know why anyone in his or her right mind would choose to fast for 24 hours for Russian dissident Anatoly Schranasky. The purported doctor professed that he was unable . to un- derstand how an action such as this one could possibly elicit any · response .from the Soviet authorities and consequently deemed it .ineffectual and a waste of time. Unfortunately for the good doctor, he has failed to recognize and diagnose the affliction which has clearly wormed its way deep into his own intellect; the disease I refer to is called apathy. Regardless of the hunger strike's success I feel D.r Gonzo is making a grave mistake when he suggests that to speak out for a cause one believes in is a waste of time. It is precisely this attitude which contributes to· the indifference and political dormancy with which our campus is so riddled. But do not fear, doctor, for you are not alone; the 66.2 percent of the student body which chose not to cast votes for their student government are silently behind you, speaking loudly of them· selves by saying nothing at all. Do not sigh heavily yet-the situation is worse than it ap- pears. Despite vvhatever shortcomirigs it was reputed to have had, the recent Moun- tebanks production was written, directed, produced and acted entirely by students of the Union community. The Nott Memorial Theatre, which holds approximately 114 people, was at least half-empty for four of the eight shows that Moun- tebanks produced. If filled to capacity, those 456 students which would have attended those performances would have comprised less than 23 percent of the student body; sadly, the modest heights of that per- centage were never even hinted at. The fact that the students, faculty, and administration of the college chose not to turn out and support the Mountebanks effort is a long black streak on Union's plexiglass reputation. The absence of a qualified in· terest in politics, the arts, culture, and social issues is a serious detriment to the quality, depth, and relevance of our education. The occasional movie, colloquim, or speaker which attract an admirably sized audience are not enough to redeem Union of its blatant lack of concern for any issue ex- ceeding the realm of grade point average or salary. The complaints about the apathy on our campus are not singular; the problem has been recognized and addressed on numerous occasions by students and faculty. However, a comprehensive solution is ·nowhere in sight. It is easy to guilt people into admitting their indifference, but individual recognition is not the answer. It is with this in mind that I most delicately ' propose two ideas which, by affecting every in· dividual in the student body, would conceivably elicit a response to apathy, were they, in fact, implemented. The first issue conserns the fraternity-sorority issue at Union. Although these organizations have their own intrinsic values and un- doubtedly serve the co~unity both socially and charttably with an occasional party or fundraiser, they are in truth elitist organizations . which inevitably serve primarily th~ir own members. Although Umon proudly boasts of giving birth to several fraternities which have grown lo national pro~rti~ns, tbe needs these orgamzatlons once filled are no longer vital ones. I mak'e no attack on the members of the Greek organizations themselves-the apathetic students are by no means concentrated in fraternities and sororities. However, by merely existing, these clubs detract tremen- dously from class unity and student activism. Once an in- dividual pledges his allegiance to a fraternity or sorority he or she makes a commitment of time, loyalty, and interest which serves the organization itself, and not the campus community as a whole. House activities follow grades on the priority list, and unfortunately the list ends. after that all too often. By eliminating the Greek system entirely the substantial percentage of Union students who partake in fraternity or sorority activitieswill be able to channel their energies toward the student body instead of away from it. Those who feel the esprit de corps one gains by belonging to a fraternity or sorority is an important aspect of the college experience, may choose to participate . in organizations which resemble Princeton's eating clubs. Membership is selective and the social element is stressed, but there is no principle organizatiQnal obligation requested from. the ~embers other th~n their presence at meals and parties. The release from this quality time bloc of a good number of Union students would ultimately help in transforming our campus from a political and cultural graveyard to an active, thriving college community. __ My second proposal is a much different one; to understand its relevance vve must dig to the root of the problem of apathy to see what feeds it. We all attend a fine, expensive college; the essentials of a good education plus the extras have not been denied to us now that we are students preparing for careers. No one has dangled the carrot labeled sports, clubs, or soCial .activities before our noses and made us vie for it. We simply pay a sum called \stude~t activities fee\ each term, and 1t is anted and distributed to those who wish to take advantage of its existence. The stud!;mts who take an active role in deter- mining how the money should be spent are to be congratulated on their concern and interest- but unfortunately many other students are too busy or preoccup,ied with 'other things' to be members of the clubs they Continued ,on page 12 Commentaries Represent the Views of the Author and not the· Editorial Board of Con- . cordiensis .

Tilis letter states that up- perclassmen will not be allowed to return to campus next fall until Monday, September 12, at 9 a.m. In the past, up- perclassmen were allowed to return to campus on Saturday. This change was made in order to devote the first two days of Orientation exclusively to, freshmen. According to a member of the Orientation Committee, there · have been .problems with up- perclassmen attending ac• tivities planned exclusively Jor freshmen. All freshmen are specifically billed for · these activities through a freshman Orientation fee. Although we can understand as a special time for freshmen Sunday in the late afternoon. to be together, we feel that this This would alleviate the in- new policy causes great in- convenience to parents, yet · p l convenience to. both up- insure that Saturday and most . . · 0 . · . . perclassmen and their parents. of Sunday would be reserved for ' - ' ' . r. . .

The wealth of student activities on campus is taken for granted as a per- manent fixture, no matter how much interest is shown by the studeHt body. Commentary Rebuked Enough is enough. What would happen next year if the Student. Activities budget was eliminated and no money was delegated to any student organizations? I would like to offer an answer. Initially, the campus would be barren of all extra-curri·culat activities siiply because the ~lubs would be rendered. immobile due to lack of ~funding. All those organizations which have grown accustomed tQ ~ a cash flow would cease to exist, their members discouraged at the thought of accomplishing anything without money. However, what would even- tually .happen would be that those students who are inherently concerned en.-,ugh about their interests would discover .a way to do things without money-if one desires something desparately enough he or she will be imJ?eded by nothing. Of course, they would be limited at first, but the groups Which would manage to offer something to th-e campus community would be a welcome interruption to the desolation of complete inactivity, Not only would the dubs find a resurgence of membership, but ·f believe also a renewed interest and active participation on the part of 'everyone who belongs, for there is nothiQg so ap- preciated as that which has been. sorely missed. To eliminate student activitie·s ftmd4Ig would be, in effect, to stQp serving meals and force the college commupity to cook for itself once it .grows hungry enough; food always tastes :better pn an empty stomach. Our bellies have .never growled at Union--hence we suffer from acute. apathy. . .. To the Editor and Wayne Godlin: I recently received a copy of April 21st Co:ucordiensis. In this issue, as I'm sure you recall, there was a brief article which you had written concerning the Middle East. As the specific issue you dealt with, the delivery of F-16s to Israel, has been resolved in the manner y()U see appropriate, many would consider the matter closed. I, however, do not correspoqp. to that thought process. If you could fjm:l the time., I realiz.e that the letter arrives as finals approach, I would appreciate your reading a few points of criticism I have written - not on your proposal, but rather on the argwnent- tative line you chose to follow to prove yourself. In the opening paragraph it is stated . that the policy of ·withholding F-16s to Israel shows a \lack of consistent logic and seems extremely shortsighted.\ As you did not specify in · which theater you wanted us to view this policy, I was forced to assume that we should deal with this individual policy in the scope of g~neral United States Middle East policies. It then becomes a matter of defining United States policy objectives in the Middle East. If you will allow me, for the sake of simplicity, to define United States objectives as two- fold. The first is to establish and maintain stability within the region. The second is to limit Soviet expansion into the area. If these two assumptions are agreed upon, then the policy of withholding delivery of the F- 16s to Israel is not as ludicrous as you describe it. You are correct in your ob- servation that the current military buildup in Syria is of a - magnitude never before wit. nessed. This, however, does not necessitate that the United States increase Israel's military capability. Your reading that the Administration is willing to tolerate this, and is even promoting this, is truely unfounded. -Syria has typically been out of the. United States sphere of influence. President Reagan's recent Peaee Proposal completely ostracized the Syrians from all stages of negotiations. To the gaze in wonder as the Soviets rush to fill the void created by United States negligence is truly shortsighted. As the United States saw it fit to offer Syria nothing in peace, it is no sur- prise Syria sought refuge in her military might. The delay in delivery of the F- 16s was, as you stated, a move to entice King Hussein to the negotiating table. You describe the tactic as fruitless (as it was), but your reasoning is wrong. King Hussein is a sur- vivor, he will not tak_e a single step until he is fully aware of Pis final destination. The United States' action of delaying shipment of the F -16s was designed to show Hussein that the United States was willing and able to apply pressure to Isreal, to force her to make concessions, if Hussein would take the step to the negotiating table. The problem lies in the fact that the United States was not capable of forcing Israel to make any concessions in Lebanon. To Hussein, this was clearly a sign of the United States weakness, and lack of commitment to the very negotiation process which he was being asked to participate in: If the United States was not capable of forcing Israe·l to act in a manner appropriate to the United States, how could Hussein be sure of future United States capability in the region? While you are correct that · there is a force wishing to '~subvert\ peace effects in the Middle East, you point the finger at the wrong culprit. The Soviet Union has but one in- terest in. the Middle East, that is to increase her influence in the region. Peace or not is secon- dary to the Soviets. The regime acting to sabotage peace in the Middle East is that of President Hafez al-Asad of Syria:- This, however, is only to be expected. The United States has con\ sisten tly ignored Syria in a11 diplomatic actions of peace in the area. As I previously alluded to, Syria has nothing to gain by the peace proposed by the United States, and in fact will actually suffer H the Reagan Plan is acted upon. (Syria's main .strength lies in the fact that she is the sole \radical'' supporter of the Palestinian cause and the struggle against Israel. This pillar of strength will be removed if the Palestinians. agree with Jordan to negotiate with Israel.) As such it is not surprising Asad is against the current plan. · Finally you give three func- tions the delivery of the F-16s would serve.· The first function of proving the capability of stopping Soviet expansion in the Middle East must be taken in the light that Andropov has ch;~arly stated that Syria is the \red-line\ of Israeli- United States influence in the Middle East. This enables us to realize that the Soviet Union is staking its influence in the region on Syria, not Lebanon. It is doubtful that the Soviets en- tertain thoughts of influencing Lebanon, for Lebanon has always taken steps to exclude itself from Soviet Actions in the Middle East. - Your second proposed func- tion truly lacks logic. In order for Israel to withdraw from Lebanon, she must be made aware of the negative results of staying. If the United States objectives include stability in the region, _then the Israeli invasion must be viewed as a negative event. To establish the stability desired Israel must be forced to withdraw. This can only be done by the withholding of goods, both military and economic, not by providing them. Finally, to get Syria to with- draw from Lebanon will require the same· actions by the Soviets, that an Israeli withdrawal will require of the United States.

Rye's played an important role as an assistant coach to Bill Scanlon since 1976. He graduated from Union in '74 al)d began his involvement with the Dutchmen hoop program as an undergraduate manager. Also a devoted. baseball fan,. Rye acted asgeneral manager of the N.Y. Mets Class A minor league team out on the west coast. Paul will leave the College and enter seminary school. Speaking for all those who have had the. pleasure of being associated with :Paul while at Union; good luck wherever your fortunes may take you and thanks for the fond memories you will leave behind. · Off-season Acquisitions-With .final deposits hav·ing already been handed in, it looks as though Union will be blessed with a fine crop of student- athletes in the class of 1986. Most ·· excited about the prospects of a fine freshman class are head football coach AI Bagnoli and head hoop ro~ntor Bill Scanlon. With the recent fortunes_ of Dutchmen football, Union has been able to draw players away from many of the teams that have taken players away from Union in past years. The basketball team's recruiting has gone well and Coach Scanlon hopes to dress fifteen new players when the team hits the courts for tryouts in the fan: It makes the job of recruiting much easier for th~ respective coaches when your teams finish as the top squads in the east, as Union's footb~ll and basketball teams did during the 1982-83 campaigns. Sportsline-Just last Monday night Bill Scanlon sat behind the microphOne and took listeners' calls on WRUC. We all ap- preciate the effort made by the coach . and hope some of his associates follow his §uit. Dutchmen athletics will be receiving a lot of exposure in the Capital District starting nex:t fall. With the increased power of WRUC and its ex- panded Sports Department, fans from all over the Capital District will be able to tune into 87.9 and listen to every single home and away football and hockey game and: almost all of the Union basketball games. If you are. interested In joining the .sports staff at either this publication or the radio station just drop me a line. On D.raft--Soon Dutchman baseball and basketball star Joe Wood will be looking for his name amongst those players picked. up by major league tearns in the June pl~yer draft. To be eligible for this early summer draft a prospect must be a graduating high school senior.·· Those college players that are eligible must either be 21 years old or have a junior class standing. Wood will be a senior next year and no matter what happens with his ensuing base.baU career, he will return to the court for the hoop squad. '82-'83 Highlights .... The most sparkling and impressive performances over the ,past year were turned in by Union's fine football and basketball teams. AI Bagnoli'spigskinners finished the fall as the top Dfv. III team in the east and only looks to improve for next year. The Dutchmen hO'op squad returned the excitement of college. basketball back to Schenectady en route to the most wins m Union history. The returning players are excite<;{ about returning to the NCAA tourney next winter and win- ning the whole thing. · '82-'83 Low Water Points- Both the Skating Dutchmen hockey team and Dutchmen baseball squad battled through disappointing seasons, as both were expected to do much better than they did. As we all remember, the Skating Dut- chmen hockey teamcamedown to the stretch run of the season with a great chance of going to the playoffs for the first time in five years. But fate was not shining on the skaters as they went on the rQad for the last four games of the year and came out of the stretch with a 0• 3-1 mark and no invitation to post season play. Nothing went right all year for first year coach Audino's team. The weather never cooperated once and the . Dut- chmen continually had to contend with indoor practices, rainouts and rescheduling. The squad was never able to get into the routine needed to win games with such a short season. Until next year, have a great summer and return to Schenectady in the fall with a lot of spirit and interest for Union sports! ••.•••••••.•••••• - •••.• ,. . . .. ·. . . • SPO·RTS:LINE : : LiveovertheAir : • e Monday · .

Page B DlSTORDIENiSIS, May B6, 198~ WRUC Executive Board WRuc·s~eks More Power By JEFF MITCHELL The ex:ecutive board of .\VRUC, in response to wide campus support for their in- crease in power to 100 watts, has.. decided to step up plans for further _power increases. \It's great that we are now able to send signals as far as Albany,\ Rich Beigen, general manager of WRUC, remarked. \However. we feel the stationcan d1• more. With a liitle help from student activity funds we should be able to increase our wattage to 50 times that amount. We want it so that people in Little Rock, Arkansas will be able to listen to WRUC.\ Beigen seemed confident that the station will be able to· ac- complish this goal by June of next year. \We are already working out plans for 'Circle of Controversy' to be syndicated nationwide,\ he said en- thusiastically. The WRUC ex:ecutive board has received the support of the Administration for their new power increase plans. Paul · Rieschick, Director of the Annual Fund in Lamont House, remarked that such a step would probably \do wonders for increasing alumni donations ... when our graduates in Bloomfield, Illinois, for in- stance, hear the voice of their alma mater over the airwaves, the bucks will just pour in.\ Dean Nourse, Director of Admissions, also seemed pleased with the idea. It is expected that wich such a move free concert tickets to all board to bring the radio station into members and <Usc jockeys, our near professional standings, season tickets to the Islander applications to· the College will games, and our trimester bOard double. meetings in Jamaica/' The only problem with the When asked why WRUC had plan,. in fact, is that of funding. been allocated money from Belgen, howeve.r, seemed student activity futtds for. the confident that with the help of three trips down to the Island, the Student Forum and with Ilene Landress admitted that it some transferring of line items, . had been an error. \It was an enough funds will be found.

Students Carry Firearms Due to this year's rash of crimes and thefts on campus, Director of Campus Security and Safety Cliff Wood described the new revised security arrangements for nex:t year. A proposal, approved last week by the Planning and Priorities committee, outlined the new administrative policy on campus security. \We are tired of taking responsibility for student safety, Wood declared when asked about the new firearm code. \If students continue to walk alone across campus at night from party to party they are just asking for trouble.'' The new code, Wood explained, allows students to carry firearms on campus for pur- poses of self-protection. Permits for rifles, pistols, knives and other such self- protection weaponry, he con- tinued, will be issued upon request with appropriate student identification. In reply to the concern of many mem- bers of the faculty, he stressed that strict guidelines Will be followed so as to decrease the chance of disturbances on campus. Among these guidelines are the limitations that students may only bear arms on campus and must not conceal firearms beneath clothing. The new code has many benefits, Joseph Mamm.ola, Dean of Students, remarked. Because students will be better equipped to defend themselves,. thesize of the security forces on campus can be reduced. \Students are always com- plaining about poor lighting and the inefficiency of our security guards. It's about time they realized that they must s_houlder some resonsibility. These students are no longer children; it's about time the Administration stops babying\ them,\ Mammola added. In keeping with new alcohol policies on campus, Manunola wished to add that anyone caught drinking while armed will have his or her permit revoked. This clause of the new security code, known as OW A, will hopefully discourage minors from drinking, for many students will consider sobriety less of a sacrifice than the risk of being helpless at night. Wood ·added that with the passage of the proposal the Administration is not sanc- tioning the use of firearms. ''We hope students will restrict use of protective devises to emergency situations;\ Wood's concern comes as a result of the bullet hole found shot through the head of Chester Arthur's statue in front of Jackson's Gardens.. ''I think . the culprit was mixing poor Chet up with that awful McKinley fellow, not realizing that Chet was the 21st and 'not the 25th President,\ Wood remarked. \It's an understandable mistake; sometimes students just get a little too carried away with their studies when they try to recreate tbe past,'' Professor Manfred Jonas of the History Department explained. Wood also commented that an additional provision for the proposal is directed towards those students on financial aid. Students. who qualify will be provided with college-owned firearil1S and other types of protective equipment upon payment of a ten-dollar deposit. \The Administration does not wish to be accused of discrimination,~· Wood ex- plained. \This way everyone on campus will be on equal footing and it is predicted that crime incidents on campus will be reduced 75 j)ercent.\ President's Commission: Status of Men IJy MACH 0. MANN Due to the growing fear that women might soon be treated as equals at Union College, the President's Commission on the Status of Men was created. The purpose of this c.ommission is to insure that thft men of Union College never lose their superior attitudes. It seems that some poor, misguided souls have been .seen treating women as they would their male friends. Due to this growing trend, th,e commission bas. been set up to take disciplinary ac- tion against any such incidents. Hidden video cameras have been installed · in· dormitories, fraternities and sororities to mak~ sure men are staying on \top\ of things. Any man caught out of position will be forced to Perform certain tasks to snap them back into reality. The first item on the agenda is to set a date for \Men's Month.\ It is ridiculous to allow women to have something men don 1 t. During this month, there will be numerous guest speakers lecturing on such topics as: \How to stop your woman from thinking'!; ''Breaking~invirgins - ·in 3 easy steps\; and \The art of telling pretty Iies:for immoral purposes.\ The commission encourages all REAL men to attend these. lectures. These plans are aU part of the Co:mrnissiori's effort to keep women in their place-.( Between the sheets). It is about time that women learn that men's ''needs'' cum first, that they are here solely for the pleasure . of men and have no right to make\· demands of any kind. The Commission for the Status of Men will not allow for the equality of the se;X:es~ Many women m~y be suf- fering from_ the dillusion that they deserve \more right~. But this would contradict the tradition of Union as well as the wodd. 1\l·EN OF UNION UNITE! Keep your women. in chains! In closing, the Commission wishes to announce the first annual ''Banana-Story Lun- cheon Colloquium.\ All men· with the wildest, most abusive tales of their sexual encounters will be asked to give .a brief description of their eXperience.

Page B DIBTOBDIENSIS, May B6, 198:1 WRUC Executive Board WRUC · S~eks More PoWer By JEFF MITCHElL The executive board of .WRUC, in response to wide campus support for their in- crease in power to 100 watts, hasdecided to step up plans for further power increases. \It's great that we are now able to send signals as far as Albany,\ Rich Beigen, general manager of WRUC, remarked. \However. we feel the station can do more. With a little help from student activity funds we should be able to increase our wattage to 50 times that amount. We want it so that people in Little Rock, Arkansas will be able to listen to WRUC.'' Beigen seemed confident that the station will be able to ac- complish this goal by June of next year. \We are already working out plans for 'Circle of Controversy' to be syndicated nationwide,\ he said en- thusiastically. The WRUC executive board has received the support of the Administration for their new power increase plans. Paul · Rieschick, Director of the Annual Fund in Lamont House, remarked that such a step would probably \do wonders for increasing alwnni donations ... when our graduates in Bloomfield, Illinois, for in- stance, hear the voice of their alma mater over the airwaves, the bucks will just pour in.\ Dean Nourse, Director of Admissions, also seemed pleased with the idea. It is expected that wich such a move free concert tickets to all board to bring the radio station into members and disc jockeys, our near professional standings, season tickets to the Islander applications to the College will games, and :our trimester bQard double. meetings in Jamaica.'' The only problem with the When asked why WRUC had plan, in fact, is that of funding. been allocated money from Beigen, however, seemed student activity fut~ds for. the confident that with the help of three trips down to the Island, the Student Forum and with Ilene Landress admitted that it some transferring of line items, had been an error. \It was an enough funds will be found.

Students Carry Firearms Due to this year's rash of crimes and thefts on campus, Director of Campus Security and Safety Cliff Wood described the new revised security arrangements for next year. A proposal, approved last week by the Planning and Priorities committee, outlined the new administrative policy on campus security. \We are tired of taking responsibility for student safety, Wood declared when asked about the new firearm code. \If students continue to walk alone across campus at night from party to part;y they are just asking for trouble.\ The new code, Wood explained, allows students to · carry firearms on campus for pur- poses of self-protection. Permits for rifles, pistols, knives and other such self- protection weaponry, he con- tinued, will be issued upon request with appropriate student identification. In reply to the concern of many mem- bers of the faculty, he stressed that strict guidelines will be followed so as to decrease the chance of disturbances on campus. Among these guidelines are the limitations that students may only bear anns on campus and must not conceal firearms beneath clothing. The new code has many benefits, Joseph Mammola, Dean of Studentst remarked. Because students will be better equipped to defend themselves, the size of the security forces Qn campus can be reduced. \Students are always com- plaining about poor lighting and the inefficiency of our security guards. It's about time they realized that they must spoulder some resonsibility. These students are no longer children; it's about time the Administration stops babying them,\ Mammola added. In keeping with new alcohol policies on campus, Marnmola wished to add that anyone caught drinking while armed will have his or her permit revoked. This clause of the new security code, known as DW A, will hopefully discourage minors from drinking, for many students will consider sobriety less of a sacrifice than the risk of being helpless at night. Wood added that with the passage of the proposal the Administration is not sanc- tioning the use offirearms. \We hope students will restrict use of protective devises to emergency situations.\ Wood's concern comes as a result of the bUllet hole found shot through the head of Chester Arthur's statue in front of Jackson's Gardens. \I think . the culprit was mixing poor Chet up with that awful McKinley fellow, not realizing that Chet was the 21st and ,not the 25th President,\ Wood remarked. \It's an understandable mistake; sometimes students just get a little too carried away with their studies. when they try to recreate the past,\ Professor Manfred Jonas of the History Department explained. Wood also commented that an additional provision for the proposal is directed towards those students on financial aid. Students who qualify will be provided with college-owned firearms and other types of protective equipment upon payment of a ten-dollar deposit. \The Administration does not wish to be accused of discrimination,\ Wood ex- plained. \This way everyone on campus will be on equal footing and it is predicted that crime incidents on campus will be reduced 75 percent.\ President's Commission: Status of Men By MACH 0. MANN Due to the growing fear that womemnight soon be treated as equals at Union College, the. President's Commission on the Status of Men was created. The purpose of this c9mm:ission is to insure that the men of Union College never lose their superior attitudes. It seems that some poor, misguided souls have been seen treating women. as they would their male f,riends. Due to this gmwing trend, the conunisslon has been set up to take disciplinary ac• tion against any such incidents. Hidden video cameras have been installed in dormitories, fraternities and sororities to mak~ sure men are staying on ''top\ of things. Any man caught out of position will be forced to perform certain tasks to snap them back into reality. The first item on the agenda is to set a date for \Men's Month.\ It is ridiculous to allow women to have something men don't. During this month, there will be numerous guest speakers lecturing on such topics as: ''How to stop your woman from thinking\ ; \Breaking-in virgins · in 3 easy steps\; and \The art .of telling .pretty lies for immoral purposes.\ The commission encourages all REAL men to attend these lectures. These plans are all part of the Commission's ,effort to keep women in their place-(Between the sheets). It is about time that women learn that men's \needs .... cum first, that they are here selely for the pleasure of men and have no right to make' demands of any kind. The Commission for the Status of Men will not allow for the equality of the sexes. · . Many women m~y ,be suf- fering from the dillusion tllaf they deserve more rights. But this would contradict the tradition of Union as well as the world. MEN OF UNION UNITE! Keep your women in chains! In closing, the Commission wishes to announce the first annual \Banana-Story Lun- cheon Colloquium.'' All men, with the wildest, most abusive tales of their sexual encounters will be asked to give .a brief description of their experience. Bananas will be provided-or you can bring your own.

Director of .Residence Life, Dave Wood, said that ''not only will this move help alleviate the over- crowding · in the dorms,. but those students assigned to the President'S House will have a unique opportunity to Jive in rooms where the carpet is not threadbare and. where maids will clean up itfter them.\ · ' There are still minor arrangements that have to be worked out before next Sep- tember. Wood said that one student would be living with President and Mrs. Morris in their room. One proble,Itr that Wood is conc.erned about is whetherto \find a small.student who could fit between President and· Mrs. Morris should he opt. to have a loft built.'' President Morris said that . he is partial towards the loft. In opposition, Mrs. Morris said that she would rather \bag the loft and use the wood to build a bar.\ If this matter remains unresolved come early September, one member of the administration who prefers to remain anonyrrious, stated that \the decision will probably be left up to the Board of Trustees.\ The remaining students will be distributed amongst tne rest of the house. Dave Wood said this can be done qUite easily and . the only problem he foresees is when the Morris' children and grandchildren come to visit. Besides that, President Morris said that he will try to retain a dorm-like atmosphere. \I am going to arrange parties :with other dorms and I expect to ·be · competitive . in intermurals.''

As . a . result of certain in• conveniences, i.e. stairs and firedrills at West, they aecided to. return to their house.

The fresh- men living in the President's House will eat there, but the President and his wife will eat at West on the Union College meal plan because the school pays for them. Mrs. Mofris was excUed about the idea of going out .for dinner all the tirne but she fears that in their absence the fresh- men will have food fights. President Morris said that he_ knows that he and his wife can handle shaving cream fights, the water balloons, and the smoke bombs and he said that he won't feel uncomfortable ·until he and his wife are thrown into the shower with their clothes on. When asked what they are looking forward to the most next year, President and Mrs. Morris emphatically replied, ''the Fox-Davidson- President's House Party spring term.\ CAMPUS NEWS BRIEFS Gates Found Thes.e cumbersome,. yet evasive, Jackson's Gardens gates have reappeared after nearly two years.

To the Editor: With NORMAN BmNBACH Dear Mr. Birnbach, I tried following your suggestion, but I don't tbink it's doing any good. My boyfriend still wants to have sex with me for religious pUI'poses no matter how much acid I put in his kool- aid! What do I do? Dear Frige, Signed, Frigid in Fox In a country that covets religious freedom and the pursuit of happiness, you make me sick. You unAmerican prude! Don't you realize that you're denying your boyfriend to practice his religion! What you should do, you comniunist lesbian, is let him have sex with you-as long as it's for religious purposes. That's the only way you'd be fit to stay in this country! .. Dear Dr. Birnbach: Well, I thought I should let you know, Doctor. I finally had my breasts reduced. The abuse I was getting from my floor- mates was too IJlUCh. But, surgery hasn't helped! They still teased me-even after the surgery, which reduced my size 44 tripleD to a 12A (the surgeon sneezed in the middle of the operation). Afterwards, my Jean Carney- /\1\ike Klem roommate told me what people. really hated about me. You see what they hated about me was that I wear polyester~ It wasn't my breasts after all! Signed, No Longer Busting Out AllOver Dear No 1..0nger Busting, Oh well, you didn't mention the polyester. Dear Doctah: How yoo doin? I haft dis problim. I tawk poifektlee, but weh I. tipe, I sownd like a guy from Brooklin. Wat do I do? My mudder sez dat, you kno-I shood ax yoo. Yoo understand wat I say? Sined, Take kair, man, Rocko, yoo kno, like Rocky wit a 0? Dear Rocky with an 0, Millions .of well-educated people are afflicted with the same dreaded disease you have. There is no cure. It only gets worse. Soon, you will . be dressing as though you live in Paramus, New Jersey. Soon, you will like the music of AC- DC, K.C. and the Sunshine Band; you will understand tile lyrics of Johnny Cash~ Perhaps the only way to live with this is to put acid in your kool·aid. Dr. Birnbach To the Editor: There's been a lot of con- troversy lately concerning the Reagan Administration's new ''S<fual\ law--legislation mandating that ()rganizations. which supply minors with birth control devices are required to notify the legal guardians of the minot. This law is grossly unfair and does a disservice to society and me in .particular~ Who do they think they are? This will absolutely put a damper and quite possibly a box of pampers on my sex life. By denying my girlfriend the right to obtain contraceptives without the knowledge of her parents, you infringe upon her inalienable rights as a human being to make honest, mature decisions. The government says they are enacting this law because minors, they claim are not mature or responsible enough to make s.ych an im- portant decision. Tbat is utter nonsense! My girlfriend. Jilly, age 13¥.!, has been making such mature The campus was rocked this week with the scandalous news that Jean Carney is engaged to marry two men. The men in her life are senior Rob Qttish an.d junior Mike Klein. It seems that Carney, also a senior, had been keeping company with Klein. A few weeks ago, Klein proposed marriage and Miss Carney agreed. During the rehearsal of the recent production of the new Barefz-Beckerman and Cozzi musical, Not Like Dreams Do, Carney began seeing her leading man, Quish. The flir- tation developed into a serious romance and it appeared that Klein was to be left out' in the cold.· To make matters worse, J E 2 decisions for tile past two years.

It .appeared that the Carney- Klein wedding was off when Miss Carney began wearing a large engagement ring given to her by Qui~h.
