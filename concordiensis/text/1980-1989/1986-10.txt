Both Elevens Have Been Losing This Season Rivalry Began In 1886 Dutchmen Have Won 26 Times To Engineers 5; Records Negligible Tomorrow Reprinted fr~m Concordiensis of October 25, 1935 By DONALD B. MILLER Union or R.P.I.? This is the question which will be. up- ... perrnGst in the mind of every person in an expected capacity crowd at Alexander Field tomorrow afternoon when the Trojans and the Garnet oppose each other in their 35th en- . counter. Each team will be seeking its first victory of the season-victory which for R.P.I. would mean the avenge· of last · year's 18-6 defeat by Union, victory which for Union would mean the cuhnination of a three game losing streak. Behind this game stands a rivalry which dates back to 1886, when R.P J. emerged as the first winner of the long series which now stands in Union's favor with 26 wins as against 5 for her rival. But no tradition or record can hope to forecast the winner of tomorrow's game, for all are tossed aside in this battle royal which is one of the highlights of capital district football. Over at Troy, Coach Henry Kumpf has been drilling his charges with grim deter- mination-determination that this game shall see the breaking of the Cherry and White's thirteen game losing streak. His team will boast five lettermen whose average weight· in the line ranges in the vicinity of 190 pounds, somewhat higher than the Union figure. Included in this array of beef and brawn are Warwick and Davison, sturdy tackles, who tip the scales at 205 and 214 pounds respectively. Playing beside these man- mountains are Knapp, 199 pounder, and Smith, a let- tennan from last year's team, whose weight is li,sted at 170. The pivot man of this tentative lineup is Bawnann, while. the forward wall is flanked by Dugan and Eckhardt, two veterans whose ability is tried and sure, >< R.P .I. Backfield The Quarterback oost is held by Gavetti, another· letterman, whose understudh is McKinley. Captain Devitt Ward and Andrews form the passing combination of the aggregation. and hold down the halfback berths. Rounding out the team is Powers, veteran hard-driving fullback whose relative light- ness, 165 pounds, does not hinder his aggressiveness in the _ least, as was proven in the R.P.I.-Union contest last year when he bucked the Garnet line time after time for consecutive gains. This backfield com- bination has an average weight of about 150 poWlds, a little lighter than the Union ball . carriers, whose approximate average is nearer 160.

The Subcouncil has been analyzing the present Liberal Learning program since fall term 1985-1986 following the September 24, 1985 discussion, \Core Curriculwn vs. Distribution.\ The twelve page report outlines the recommended requirements that WGuld replace the present Liberal Learning program, if passed. While drawing up the proposal, the committee drew up recommendations that woUld meet three considerations: one, . to, , pro :vide that · all· Union ·stud¢nts will gain a . strong knowleclge ·of Western history and culture as well as the skill required to investigate other civilizations; two, to create a general Education program that Will cai\ry on its original in- tegrity ~fthe requirements over time; and three, to retain the \effective elements\ of the present Liberal Learning program. The overall goal of the report is ''to promote cohere11ce within each in- dividual's undergraduate education.\ Under the ,proposals for General Education there would be 15 courses required (eleven in the ease of ellgineers) t to fulfli:ll the program's goals as opposed to Liberal Learning's 12 required COW'SeS.

Another \extraordinary increase\ was in the area of Financial Aid: That department received a 13 percent increase from their previous year's budget for several reasons, Cutbacks in federal aid forced Union to fill in part of the gap. More upperclassmen applied for first-time financial aid than have done so in the past. Finally, Union accepted more minority students than ever, who, according to Hauser, generally require more financial aid. Two other sections of the budget, Operating Supplies and Expenses and Capital Acquisitions, combined for a 5 percent increase. This com- pensates for inflation and rate hikes in energy and water as well as assuming the renovations in West College and other dorms~ It also i:ncludes the work in academic buildings (Social Sciences and eventually' in Hwnanitl.es) and ·physical plant . activities such as repaving and grounds im- . provements. Hauser reiterated that the current classes at Union are not paying the bill for the College Center and Alumni Gym. Foundation grants and gifts fund a large portion of those projects and loans, repayable over a 25 year. period cover the rest. of the expense. A new expense was $240,000 paid to two new investment management firms, Sanford Bernstein and Townley Capital Management of New York City. Hauser explained that as the size of the endowment reached a certain point, it became ad- vantageous for Union to hlre firms that specialize in certain .. s•«ur~;~~~.n. '.· ... - .... ·: ' -. .... ,' <· - ... areas of investing. Another . firm, Fiduciary Trust Co., is still utilized. Hauser added that these \more aggressive en- · dowment man3,gers have raised Union's endowment to $80,000,000 as of June 30, 1986 .. The income from the en- dowment now stands at about $3,800,000 per year or about · $360,000 more than last year. The budget for this year requested an increase of 7.2 percent over the expenses of the past year or about $2,540,000~ This increase was covered by $200,000 from the annual fund (gifts), $150,000 in grarits from the New York State Bundy . Program, $360,000 from the endowment, $80,000 from various sources, and an ad- ditional $1,750,000 from tuition, room and board. Causes of Acid Rain Analyz,ed: .

The mattress was actually thrown out the bedroom window by the firemen so that it could smolder itself out. The fire was prevalent \not very long\ before the bells were set off, Wood said, although the Residence Life is still waiting for the official report from the dire department (who is also waiting for an official report to come back from the State Police laboratories, which could take a few weeks). Although there are many rumors as to the cause of the fire, it is still UliknDwn. \It appears to be non- electrical,\ Wood stated, especially as there were no evident circumstances in the room to suggest this.

The State of New York is also forced to analyze the expected effects of this transition and adapt its tax: policy to function in the ·new environment. Mr. Mauro's presentation will examine the options which New York State faces. It will consider issues ranging from the treatment of capital gains and partn~rship losses to the elimination of state and local tax payments and the tax exempt bonding authority of state and local ._governments. Mr. Mauro has served in various policy analysis positions for the state legislature since 1969. He has held the position as Secretary of the Ways and Means Committee since 1983. Mr. Mauro is a Union graduate· and holdS ··an MBA ··. from the Maxwell School; Syracuse University. This past summer Union College joined a consortium of previously all-male colleges with newly established women's studies programs. The con- sortium, funded by the Ford Foundation, includes Colgate University, Columbia University, Amherst College, Dartmouth College, and others. AT THE During the 1986-87 academic year, the planning P.hase for a potential women s studies curriculum at Union will be directed by Martha Huggins, associate professor of sociology. During this e;K~ ploratory period, several proposals will be advanced and the possibility of a women's studies academic concentration in the form of an in- terdepartmental major. will be considered.

Tbe Sox were already Eastern Division champs and deser- vedly so, after moving out to an early lead and never pulling the traditional fold, despite injuries aml personal problems on the team. outstanding players. They are th,e two premier hitters in baseball this year and un- doubtedly ·will be for many years to come. Both men represent the proud tradition of their teams and both men possess the integrity one should expect from such a player. aching to get on the field and refute the critics, but he knew that his physical health in the upcoming post-season was far more important than his wounded pride. The series dicillave meaning to one player-- Yankee first baseman Don Matt~gly. He was six points behind Boston 1 s Wade Bqggs in the race for the American .Leagu~ batting title. Mattingly needed a nine .for eleven perfonnance over . the 'Yeekend to catcb. Boggs. The figures were definite because Boggs' average was flxed at .356-he could not play, sideUned with a pulled hamstring mw;cle. So, you have to wonder, even now that it is all over, what they were thinking as the weekend serie$ began. Mattingly, the competitor that he Is, must have been thinking of doing his best, as always; and if his best pulled ' Mattingly would understand, and that's why he would not criticize his rival. When Sunday arrived and he needed a 6 for 6 day at the plate, he should have been more aggravated than ever, He merelylet his ability speak. He did not go 6 for 6, but he did his best and went out with style and a .352 average. He left the fans with something more, however, In his first at-bat, leading off the first inning, he quickly picked up two strikes. But on the sixth pitch he drove the ball over the Red Sox bullpen, 400 feet away. With that hit he impressed the feeling that it could be done; and even .if he did not, he would still have style and class. Assistant D.ean of Students Robert Massa explains I iquor liability. -off a batting title, so be .it- although it was unlikely. Boggs would think likewise in the Yankee's position-but he was not. He was being vilified by the press in. New York and elsewhere. _He h,ad faced emotional difficulty earlier in the year after the death of his mother, but this was entirely different. His character was under attack for the same qualities it was nwst often praised: his selflessness. Boggs has nothing to prove-he had a firest-class season that wotild not have cr.wnbled in a four- game series. He must have been liquor l~nsurance Doubles; Could Cripple Greek Socials The New York Daily News screamed \Chicken\ in their sports headlines, since Boggs' absence would leave his average stable and would force Mattingly to perfonn his inl· possible task. Both Boggs and Mattingly are . . . TEST YOUR STRENGTH. QUITTING. IT COULD BE THE TEST Of YOUR LIFE. Boggs would understand, and would have wished tllat he could play, even if it meant finishing second himself. That's what a player of their standard feels. But Boggs will not have to brood about finishing the season on the bench-.his stung pride will have a chance to rebound this week in the playoffs for which he waited interminable painful days. And if Boggs excels, Mat- tingly will cheer loudest of all. By JASON FElNGOLD Since the drinking age went up last year, there have been some repercussions in other areas as well. Due to the high number of non-legal drinkers on this campus, there is now a stress on insurance for fraternities and sororities to carry host liquor liability in- surance. This year is the first year in which the Greek organizations are required to have insurance, although many had. some already. According to Assistant Dean .of Students, Robert J.

The premiums ·of the in- surance depend on the physical size of the house and its location, but not 011 the number of members~ As a · result, a house may have high premiwns but not a lot of members to pay for it. Some houses may have bery strong national organizations, but in order to help fund s11ch parties will still have to cut into their ·budgets. Mo~t likely, it will come down to a question of how often a house can throw a party. \One alternative,\ suggests Rob Wofchuck, president of Delta Chi, \is to lower the coverage to $500,00, which is what most houses are used to paying.\ ~ .\What could happen in the..:..., , future,\ says Rob Blinkoff, · president of Kappa Alpha, \is that only thDse houses that have more support from their national organizations, their alumni or their members will be able to SUliTive.\ A house must have insurance to maintain themselves at all whether they are on or off campus or whether they have a hollSe or not. \Houses with fewer members will probably have a harder time providing the necessary coverage,\ states Dean Massa, but he adds, \The school will do everything it can to help the fraternities and sororities obtain insurance.\ j '•- , I

PageS CONCORDIENSIS, October9; ·J986 · FEATURES The Art of Procrastination Talk of tbe ·Town ByWENDYZIMMEJ;tMAN Procrastinati()n, a word that pops up time and time again in one's college career. With midter'!ls approaching, this seems l1ke a good time to ad·. dress this ever present problem. As stated in the dic- tionary to procrastinate is \to put off intentionally and habitually and for a reason held ~o ~ reprehensible (as laziness, mdi:fference to responsibility).\ Now, althoughlamjust a jlmior and have only experienced what I am about to discuss for two years, I feel that the extent of my experiences make m~ en!)ugh. of an ex:.pert to take a teacher-like position. . To begin, all students at Union, be them freshmen or senior, have experienced the torture of procrastination. Some know fully well what they are going through when the torture begins, but I realize that some may say ''What, me procrastinate?\; yes, you. Some people just aren't' for- tunate enough to realize what is taking place. For instance, a computer science-math major when forced with a big test may decide to pu.sh studying aside· instead opting to write a per:, sonal.program. These students · probably view this type of ac- tivity as almost beneficial when in fact · this is a type (as demented .as it is) of procrastination. In every day Union lingo, procrastination is \blowing. off your work (no ma.tter .how necessary it is) for something better to do.\ Now one must realize that when you are deep in the motions of true procrastination, the concept of \something better\ gets a bit distorted. Let me eYnand on this. ~ .. Have you ever noticed that when anyone has a big test, papel\ project or anything as enjoyable as the above men- tioned approaching, their room is incredibly clean? This is a classi<! case of procrastination. H you remember those three or four times during the year when you throw away month old Domino's pizza boxes from under your bed, find crumpled up dirty clothes that you were convinced were gone forever and cbange the sheets that have been on your bed for the last three months, you will find that they all fall around or sometimes· on the morning of such things as the above mentioned. This may seem pretty unusual to a lot of you, but believe it or not I'm starting with the most tame and working · my way up to the most outrageous. lUlother cornrnon forn1 of procrastination is as deceiving to the pedormer .as to the people aroWld them. This is the old \Well.I'll blow this off but I'll ,go to the library and do my other work!'' Now at first this seems to be a pretty practical way to go, a sott of trad.e off. But in reality, nothing is ever done, and · in this instance double the· amount! The usual. course of events is .such.: going to the library fully equipped with a knapsack (full of books, of course--most likely ac- comnanied l>y a Wallm.lan and a few tapes), and .comfortable clothing, psyching yourself up for a long night of hardcore studying--you approach the door. In reality though, this is what happclns: yo.u walk in just as plannecl,. but all of a sudden something clicks in your b1;ain and instead of seeking out a q!Jiet corner ·you immediately p1ck up the sounds of familiar voice~ engaged in conversation. Of course you find them and proceed to sit down to talk. You epd up staying until · closing tlffie (11:00 p.m.) with an oc- casional trip out for candy or popcorn, promising, and stating out loud \O~K. this is it, when I get back I have to start working!\ procrastin.ation involves the use of the telephone. As I mentioned before the calendar method will show that j11St about the same t~e your room is clean, your friends that you have not talked to in montils and your parents (gods knows when the last time you talked to them was) will have received phone calls from you. Yes it is true, check it out, you will end up staying on the phone with your friends for hours, catching up on those months of no contact, and as always, your parents will say things like \To what do I owe this unexpected pleasW'e?\ Or the ever popular \What do you need mon.ey?\ Needless to say, the parental calls will only last five minutes or so, which forces you to resort to ... yes another type of procrastination. I myself have done such things as taking Chopper runs (Price Ch()pper for those who do not know the lingo). Some may say, so w.nat\! Hut my Chopper runs entail a- bit more than the usual. This is the course of Tuesday, Oct. 14 At 8:00 P .. M. In The Nott Memorial First Half Solo By -Professor Thomas Ross Second Half Combined W'ith Jeff Presslaff On Piano and Thomas D'Andrea on Drums events: First I do my ehopper runs 'sans argel\t' (without money for those of you who don't take French). This is so l>ecause the \Bulk Bins\ pFovide me with all the chocolate . covered peanuts, .¥&M's and ch~ese twists, my little heart desires; and sooo cheap! In any case by the time l · .get home I feel so full and. loaded down that some type of exercise is called for, UJ>ually a .nice jog around campus . .Many (){ these jogs have been at odd times such as 2:30 and 5:00. a.m., this usually . lets .me' pll«lCrastinate for l:i full24 hours· because by the next day I feel so.· .sick from the night before it1 takes me until the next night to recover. Sometimes; though, procrastination can be very ha2ardo11s to your health. I know, !t sounds strange but it happened to me and it comd very well happen to you. Last wrnter term, one blustering windy night I had. just exercised (more procrastination) and decided that to prolong my delay of work I would hang up a poster that I had been meaning. to put to use. This poster in particular, was to be hung on the ceiling. I decided to hang it by _standing on my desk. I miscalculated arid ended up in a heap on the floor, with a broken hand. (Needless tcJ say tbere were three people present, so I wasn't em- barrassed or anytlling! In any case I was treated to a whole term of procrastination! So be advised, procrastination can be fun, ·but avoid situations that might endanger your health. The C4lncordy recelltly. a$ked: ''What should be done with the Nott?''

Lymphocytes are manufactured in the bone marrow and are processed either through the bursa (B- lyrnphocytes), or through the thymus gland (T:..Iymphocytes).

With the help of the Brothers of Beta Theta Pi, the American Red Cross conducted an extremely successful blood drive on October 1, 2, and 3. Beta's efforts were the outcome of a concerted effort to increase their involvement in campus activities.

By scheduling the donors in an efficient time table, the impressive response was channeled to insure smooth execution of blood donations.

CONCORDIENSlS, October 9, 19fl6 Olnnrnrbtrnsis- FCJunbJ at lfmon Co/leg~ 1877 ----~------- ---~---- Honoring The Goddess of Wisdom Over the past year, one of tne most interesting and intriguing additions to the cultural life of the College has been the Minerva Hour. Instituted last fall, this series of lectw:es has br011ght a ve-ry diversified group of speakers to Union. Held .betweenll:30 and 12:30 in either SS016 or the music room of Schaffer Library, we would like to say these lectures give students., faculty, and mem- bers of the campus community a ''dose of education from the outside wo1·Id\ on Wednesday mornings. The College must be commended for implementing this lecture series, which has been done in ex:cellent taste. Speakers are r~imbursed for their expenses and given an honorarium of $250. As Jack Maranville, assistant to the president and director of the Minerva series has stated, \the Minerva Committee is adamantly opposed to 'circuit speakers'.\ This enables the committee to secure speakers who are genuinely interested in speaking and spending a day at Union. The attractiveness of this series has been speakers who come from many different fields and are able to give in£01·mal, poignant talks on their subject of interest. Some of tpese outstanding people who have spoken throughout the past year in the Minerva series include Howard Simons, former managing editor of the Washington Post, Reverend Howard J .. Hubbard, Bishop of the Roman Catholic Diocese in Albany, Telford Taylor, chief prosecutor at the Nuremberg Trials, and most recently, Pat Riley, coach of the Los Angeles Lakers. The members of the committee hope to establish this \hour\ as a time when most students and faculty are available and can 11ttend a short, informal lecture of interest. Next year, with Gel-Time scheduling changes in effect, the Minerva Hour will be moved to Tuesdays at 11:30 when all.students and facultywill be free. The Minerva Committee has also used the hour to reinstitute Fom1der;s Day and the Opening Convocation. In SUIJ.liilation, the Minerva series has been a culturally and intellectually rewarding experience for those who have attended, and has added to every day college life here at Union. Some of those who will speak in future Minerva lectures include Blanche Cooney, creator of the Phoenix (an anti-war sentiment quarterly that appeared in the 1940's and later again in 1970), and Patricia Schroeder and Barney Frank, both members of the U.S. Congress. J:i'or a \d{)se of education from the outside world,\ attend the Minerva lectures at 11:30 on Wednesday mornings. ToBeOr Nott To Be .... \ ... Nott Memorial will not remain long as Union's chief land- mark unless immediate action is taken to arrest deterioration and to find more suitable llSes for it. The roofs are beyond patching: they must be replaced . .Already much of the plaster work is beyond retrieval. If the present activities within the building are not carefully monitored, they could result in its accidental destruc- tion. . Pestruction, whether by neglect or abuse, would pose a serious loss not only to Union College but to the nation's cultural patrimony.\ This deplorable condition of the Nott was reported by architect, John I. Mesick in The Nott Memorial: A Historic Structure Report, in 1973, thirteen years ago. Since that time this process of decay has continued to consume the building at an alarming rate. In 1972, the Nott was added to the National Register of Historic Places as a buildlng of national significance. This enables it to be eligible for federal preservation grants. Obviously the College cannot allow the NDtt to decompose to a state of rUin. It woUld be. a worthy project to set a goal .to CDmplete the restoration of the Nott in time for our bicentennial in 1995. Assuming that restoration will take place, it is necessary to plan what will be done with this building. · Artbistory Professor Mendelsohn stressed the importance of perserving the architectural integrity of the structure in a way that preserves visibility of the interior as its architect, Edward Tuckerman Potter, intended it to be seen. In past years, the Nott has served a variety of functions. When it was completed in 1875, it was used as a reading room and a museum. In 1903 Andrew Car- negie helped fund the renovation of the Nott and its library. When Schaffer Library was completed in 1961, Moontebanks moved into the building. Several years later, the bookstore moved into the basement. Many suggestions have been made concerning the use of the Nott. The theater could remain in the building, possibly 11tilizing the upper levels as a museum for the Union archives and special arts collections. It could house administrative offices, or some type of reading room. The advantage of Nott's central location should be used to further unify the campus. If the Nott is to.be restored, now is the time to begin the process, before it deteriorates any further, or falls to the ground.

Jan Gray-Our skellar serv~s beer! ·COMMENTARIES~ PAULSCHOP From-the .Albany Desk An Analysis of Apathy We are now less than one month away from Election Day. Every day, th~ amount of space that the local newspapers and television news programs devote to coverage of the 198(). campaigns increases, as does the frequency with whiclt political commercials appeal on local television and radio stations. I£ this is to be taken as a ·sign that the local community is expressing an ever increasing amount of interest in the 1986 campaigns, then can it also be said that the Union College community is mirroring this interest? · In an effort to answer this question, Concordiensis asked three individuals who are knowledgeable about political activity at Union what their views were. After carefully· ·evaluating their responses, it appears that Union College is · fairly apathetic about th~s year's elections. The following are some of the responses that were received during in- terviews that were conducted with Ms. Lori Zwicker, the Student Coordinator for the Capital District for Cuomo,. Prof. Clifford Brown, of the political science department, and Brian Kelly, President of the Union College Young · Republicans. Ms Zwicker visited our campus last Thursday: to help organize a Students for Marb Cuomo group at Union College. Although the turnout was smaller than expected, Ms. Zwicker did not feel that Union was a more apathetic campus, politically, than some of tbe other schools in the area. To quote Ms. Zwicker, \When one compares Union College with other schools in the area, they have more volunteers, but they're much larger. SUNY Albany, for example, has 60 students volunteeriitg for Cuomo, but SUNY Albany is eight times the size of Union.'' The next person to be in· terviewed was Prof. Brown~ who was able to add to this study the perspective of having Spent many years teaching at colleges, and of having worked on a Presidential campaign at a national level. · Prof. Brown had the following opinjons about political apathy at Union College: \Is apatlly bad? Compared to what? Students today are more politically apathetic than they were in the mid '70s, and cel- tainly much more than .ih the late '60s or early '70s. In tbose days, there were many students involved in both parties' Presidential campaigns.'' \Six years ago, I was in- volved nationally with John Anderson's campaign. There was a great deal of student involvement all over the country. But that was a Presidential campaign.\ It might be that students are not inspired by either candidate in this year's gubernatorial election. Why should they work for Cuomo, who raised the drink~g age, a move whicll has caused so, much confusion .on this campus. On the other hand., why should they work for Andy O'Rourke, whom few people know ·and who has yet to . establish a major presence. The final interview was with Brian Kelly, . who has been active in Republican politics in New York State since 1983, when he began to organize young Republicans at Union College. He felt that there was qpatlly at Union, and that it had several causes. He cited the fact . that a large number of Union students are not from New York. He felt that the 1984 Fresidential campaign, from the primary battles between Gary Hart and Walter Mondale, to the cmmting of the final ballot on Election Day was, to use his words, \sucb:.an overwhel!ning force, compared to other campaigns.\ H.e felt that because the 'fl4 campaigns were so exhausting, that students tod~y were now some:whaUired of politics, and were therefore not as interested in the 1986 electio'ns asthey had been in the elections of two. years ago. One additio11al fact()r cited by Kelly as a contributor to apathy ·at Union College was a reluc- tance on the part of'engiil.eers to become involved in politics.

Instituted last f~J;U, this series of lectures has brought a very diversified group of speakers to Union. Held between11:30 and 12:30 in either SSOlti (If\ the music room of Schaffer Library, we would like to say thEse lectures give students, faculty, and mem· bers of the campus community a \dose ef education from the outside world\ on We!lnesday mo~nings. The College must ·be commended for implementing this lecture CJeries, which has I:Jeen done in excellent taste. Speakers are reimbursed for their e:xpenses and given an honorariwn of $250. As Jack Maranville, assistant to the president and director of tb.e Minerva series has stated, ''the Minerva Committee is adamantly o~po.~ed to 'circuit speakers'.\ This enables the committee to secure speakers wllo are genuinely interested in speaking a:lld spending a day at Unil)n. The attractiveness {)f this series has been speakers who come from many different fields and are able to give infol'mal, poignant talks on their subject o:f interest. Some of these outstanding peoplE who have spoken throughout the past year in the Mi11erva series include Howard SimoRs, forme11 managing editor of the Washington Post, Reverend Howard J. Hubbard, Bishop of the Roman Catholic Diocese in Albany, Telford Taylor, chiEf prosecutor at the Nuremberg Trials, and most recently, Pat Riley, coach of the Los Angeles Lakers. The members of th.e committee hope to establish this \hour\ as a time when most studEnts and faculty are available and can attend a short, informal lecture of interest. Next year, with Gel-Time scheduling changes ill e~fect, the Minerva Hour will be moved to Tuesdays at 11:30 wl1e11 all students and faculty will be free. The Minerva Committee has also used the hour to reinstitute Forn1der's Day and tile Opening Convocation. In summation, the Minerva series has been a culturally and intellectually rewarding experience for those vvho have attended, and has added to every day college life here at Union. Some of those who will speak in future Minerva lectuies include Blanche Cooney, creator of the Phoenix (an anti-war sentiment quarterly that appeared in the 1940's and later again in 1970), and Patricia Schroeder and Barney Frank, both membEiS of the U.S. Congress. For a ''dose ()f education from the <>utside world,\ attend the Minerva lectures at 11:30 on Wednesday rn()rnings. ToBeOr NottTo Be. • • \ ... Nott Memorial will not remain long as Union's chief land- mark unless immediate action is taken to arrest deterioration and to find more suitable uses for it. The roofs are beyond patching: they must be replacEd. Already much of the plaster work is beyond retrieval. If the present activities within the building are not carefully monitored, they could result in its accidental destruc- tion .. ,Destruction, whether by r1eglect or abuse, would pose a serious loss not onl:y t() Union College but to the nation's cultural patrimony.\ This deplorable con.dition of the Nott was reported by architect, John I. Mesick in Tlle N ott Memorial: A Historic Structure Repor-t, in 1973, thirteen years ago. Since ttat time this process of decay has continued to consume the building at an alarming rate. In 1972, the Nott was added to the National REgister of Historic Places as a building of national significance. This enables it to be eligible for federal preservation. giants. Obviously the College cannot all()W the Nott to decompose to a state of ruin. It woul~ be a worthy project to set a goal to complete the restoration of the Nott in time for our bicentennial in 1995. Assuming that rest()ration will take place, it is necessary to plan what will be done with this building. Arthistory Profess()r Mendelsohn stressed the importance of perserving the architectural integrity of the structure in a way that preserves visibility- ()f the interior as its architect, Edward Tuckerman Potter, in.tended it to be seen. In past years, the Nott has served a variety of functions. When it was completed in 1875, it was used as a reading room and a musewn. In 1903 Andrew Car- negie helped fund the renovation of the Nott and its library. When Schaffer Library was completed in 1961, Morn1tebanks moved into the building. Several years later, the bookstore moved into the basement. Many suggestions have been made concerning the use of the N ott. The theater could remain in the building, possibly utilizing the upper levels as a museum for the Union archives and special arts collections. It C()uld house administrative offices, or some type of reading room. The advantage of Nott's central location should be used to further unify tlle campus. If the Nott is to.be restored, now is the time to begin the process, before it deteriorates any further, or falls to the ground.

Aside from the long hours of preparation for our 5 hours of classes each day (beginning at 8 a.m.), we would like to believe we're making significant con- tributions to campus life at Nanjing Teachers' U! Each one of us has contributed in his-her own way: Lawrence Rosenthal has brought California to the campus ·with the university's first Ultimate Frisbee team; Matt Hopkins has been declared a national monument; Ethes \van Gogh\ Mangray has delved deeply into Chinese calligraphy; May Cheung has quickly risen to be one of China's leading Tai Ch'ih masters; Stuart O'Dell and his yo-yo have been amazing crowds from Shanghai to Tibet; Suzanne Lachelier has already broken many a Red Heart; Sue Change has. kept us abreast of Schenectady news with Freddy's daily letters; Alison .Abrams is already chalking up the points on her bicycle permit- -after the hit and run of a Chinese juvenile; Chris Hart- mann follows a close second with his numerous bicycle pa·rking violations; Margot Salisbury, asi.de from turning many Chinese heads with her blond hair, has greatly roistered the local economy with her daily shopping sprees; and, James Sawyer says hello. Our Chinese hosts have welcomed us and treated us with the utmost of hospitality. We would hope that the 4 Chinese exchange students coming to Union will encounter an equally warm reception. We'd like to thank all those who worked hard to put us here. We'll try our hardest to make a finn foundatian on which all future exchanges· can grow.

Jan Gray-Our skellar serves beer! COMMENTARIES. PAUL SCHOP From the Albany Desk An Analysis of Apathy We are now less than one month away from Election Day. Every day, th~ amount of space that the local newspapers and television news programs devote to coverage of the 1986 campaigns increases, as does the frequency with which political commercials appear on local television and radio stations. If this is to be taken as a sign that the local community is expressing an ever increasing amount of interest in the 1986 campaigns, then can it also be said that the Union College community is mirroring this interest? In an effort to answer this question, Concordiensis asked three individuals who are knowledgeable about political activity at Union what their views were. After carefully evaluating their responses, it appears that Union College is fairly apathetic about this year's elections. The following are some of the responses that were received during in- terviews that were conducted with Ms. Lori Zwicker, the Student Coordinator for the Capital District for Cuomo, Prof. Clifford Brown, of the political science department, and Brian Kelly, President of the Union College Young Republicans. Ms Zwicker visited our campus last Thursday to help organize a Students for Mario Cuomo group at Union College. Although the turnout was smaller than expected, Ms. Zwicker did not feel that Union was a more apathetic campus, politically, than some of the other schaols in the area. To quote Ms. Zwicker, \When one compares Union College with other schools in the area, they have more volunteers, but they're much larger. SUNY Albany, for example, has 60 students volunteering for Cuomo, but SUNY Albany is eight times the size of Union.\ The next person to be in- terviewed was Prof. Brown, who was able to add to this study the perspective of having spent many years teaching at colleges, and of having worked on a Presidential campaign at a national level. Prof. Brown had the following opinions about political apathy at Union College: \Is apathy bad? Compared to what? Students today are more politically apathetic than they were in the mid '70s, and cer- tainly much more than in the late '60s or early '70s. In those days, there were many students involved in both parties' Presidential campaigns.'' \Six years ago, I was in- volved nationally with Jolm Anderson's campaign. There was a great deal of student involvement all over the country. But that was a Presidential campaign.\ It might be that students are not inspired by either candidate in this year's gubernatorial election. Why should they work f()r Cuomo, who raised the drinking age, a move which has caused so much confusion on tltis campus. On the other hand, why should they work for Andy O'Rourke, whom few people know and who has yet to establish a major presence. The final interview was with Brian Kelly, who has been active in Republican politics in New York State since 1983, when he began to organize young Republicans at Union College. He felt that there was apathy at Union, and that it had several causes. He cited the fact that a large nwnber of Union students are not from New York. He felt that the 1984 Presidential campaign, from the primary battles between Gary Hart and Walter Mondale, to the counting of the final ballot on Election Day was, to use his words, \such an overwhelming force, compared to other campaigns.'' He felt that because the '84 campaigns were so eKhausting, that students today were now somewhat tired of politics, and were therefore not aJS interested in the 1986 elections as they had been in the elections of two years ago. One additional factor cited by Kelly as a contributor to apathy ·at Union College was a reluc- tance on the part of engineers to become involved in politics. To quote Kelly, \In 1984 1 I had a hard time recruiting engineers. Many had said that their professors, advisors, or alumni had advised them not to get involved in politics, because it could hurt them when they applied for a job.\

What a show. · Steve played first, dazzling the audience with a vast repertoire. His talent on both guitar .and piano was top-notch. His set was so incredible that it is n!IW impossible to remember the songs, but he did James Taylor proud. Midway through his show, Steve was joined on stage by cabaret veteran Jim Havard who sang a duet with Steve that really shook the place to pieces. The two were really cooking as the audience p()unded the tables and howled with delight. Y()u couldn't get Steve to stop playing, and Jim, no fool by any standards, just kept singing along. It was a bit of music history at Union College, sure to become legendary. Left in wonder by Steve Sander~ the s~o~ pu! Ol}- by Becky ~a~~?-)t_;{Jabonf1 andincredif.ily-pe · ·, · d. Wl~ a voice! What a guitar player! She played favorite songs from her childhood, and teased the audience, on their feet by that time, to join in if they knew the . words. She certainly lit the fire on that night. Later on during the show she was joined by another Cabaret workhorse, Melanie Miasterson (spelled correctly this time, Huh Mel?) who accompanied Becky in beautiful harmony. Confessing that both were G<Jdspell fans, the audience was treated to some wonderful renditions of tunes from the show, Becky and Melanie just happier than could be as they belted them out. It was quite a show, and no doubt these performrs will be back. In closing, the Cabaret club wishes to thank Josh Yohay, living all the way out on Carrie Street (377-6771 for those interested) for coming in at a moment's notice and setting up the sound system for us.

Have you ever noticed that the most amusing and often only amusing scene of a mQvie is shown ill the preview. 9ften after viewing this seen~ one voyages to the theater in hope of witnessing an hour or so of humorous entertainment. More often than not the word \disappointment\ is an ap- propriate summariZation of this experience. Crocodile Dundee, starring Paul Hogan; does not reflect this phenomenom completely though it comes rather close. Paul Hogan portrays a crocodile hunter (or poacher whichever you prefer) from Australia who is lured into New York City by a woman reporter. Dundee has never been out of Australia, hence he is completely oblivious to the obscurities of city life. The film focuses on .Dundee's antics in the big city\( of course, the scene that provokes the most laughter can be viewed for free,·minutes Steve Sanders plays the guitar . ~- before seeing another cinematic presentation). Another un- derlining theme of the movie deals with the attraction that obviously exists between Dundee and the chic reporter. The audience quickly perceives the destined relationship of these two opposites due to the innumerable ''meaningful glances\ that are being thrown around throughout the entire. picture. Crocodile Dundee is a worthwhile source of ligbt entertainment for the carefree movie goer .. B t .. Jesus Christ Superstar at Proctor's By NANCY GRUNDMAN Jesus Christ Superstar depicts the last seven days in thoe life of Jesus Christ. The method by which we experience these days is anything but traditional. This rock opera, wllich during the early 1970's was a controversial avant- guard version of the story of Jesus, came to Proctor's Theatre in Schenectady, under the direction of Scott Harris, featuring a now 1980's style story-line. The music is by Andrew Lloyd Webber and the lyrics by Tim Rice. The tour is produced by Candlewood Productions, which is a five-year and not-for-profit arts organization. The set, which is extremely simple with only a raked floor of glass panels, give the stage a barren yet high-tech look. With prop use at a minimum, it gives the character a chance to use their improvisational abilities. The props are brought on and off the stage when needed. This minimizes excessive externals and focuses the attention ori the W<lnderful performers and their music. Paul Avedisian starred as Jeau Christ in the Candlewood Production of Jesus Christ Superstar. Avedisian appearing with his contemporary hair style, clean-shaven face, baggy pants, purple tee-shirt and striped jacket gives the ira- pression of Jesus being of the Don Johnson genre. We see Jesus as being a man of today rather than a man of the past. Avedisian, convincingly plays his role as Messiah. He is able to carry the burden of his power that has been placed upon him by God. Aved!sianmotivates his mood swings, that are caused by his dealings with dissident disciples and his relationship with God, with considerable ease. Judas Iscariot, played by Michael S. Proctor gave a high powered performance which entranced the audience. Judas opens the play singing the solo, \Heaven on their Minds,\ giving a warning about the consequences of Jesus's plight getting out of control. Proctor's physical appearance accented his devilish qualities of a man consumed by jealousy. In the end, however, we see Judas as being an ordinary man rather than a devious traitor. He, like the other apostles, is only human and not as strong-willed as Jesus. We see evidence of this ib Peter's denial of being an apostle. At the Last Supper, Jesus questions the loyalty of his apostles and tells them that they will forget him after he dies. Humor was entwined in this otherwise serious scene with the display of Doritos and Ruffles as the entree for the Last Supper. The. comic relief continues w1th Thorn Goff who is hysterical in his version of King Herod. He is disgustingly fat, dressed in Hawaiian shorts and an unbuttoned Hawaiian shirt, surrounded by his bathing beauties, with· a cocktail in hand. As a whole, Jesus Christ ~ Superstar was a play that should not have been missed. The performers were excellent! Their voices explo!.led across the theatre. Judas' innovative insight is whether or not Jesus woUld have been more suc- cessful in a time when mass- communication was available. The answer is that the reactions of . the authorities and the masses in contemporary time are the same as those in ancient time. This fast-pacad production was indeed a success. The audience hummed the music an the way to their cars. Paul Avedisiar\ as Jesus Christ

CONCORDIENSJS, Octo/Jtr 9, 1986 Page 13 Record Review • • • Revenge Is Sweet By JULIE STEINBERG The latest album by the Eurythmics, Revenge, brings forth their progressive 80's style. The sound of Dave Stewart's guitar,. when com· bined with Annie Lennox's powerful voice, conveys a crisp sound to the listener's ear. Annie's diverse style .of singing is quite obvious as she changes from the opening outburst of Missionary Man to the soothing melody and lyrics of The Miracle of Love. Doing an outstanding backup per· fontiance is· singer Jon,iece Jamison whose Aretha Franklin•style voice adds extra life to the opening song, Missionary Man. The album bas many high points, aside from the band's raw talent,. such as Missionary Man, When Tomorrow Comes,. and The Miracle of Love to disgUise the occasional lull as in the ca$e qf Thorn In My Side. Stewart and Lenn(lx seemed to have been at a loss for words whU.e writing Revellge, because there is quite a bit of repetition in the lyrics, and the chorus seems overextended as to fill space. The Revenge balld is made up of Patrick Seymour on keyboards, Jiinmy \Z'' Zavala Oil saxophone and harmonica, Chucho Merchan Oil bass, Clem Burke on drums, and J()niece Jamlson on backup vocals.

If You cannot AHend, Call Joy At 372-0890 The Unionaires By MARY JO CONLEY We, as students, have always been ti>ld that teachers are people to!>, with lives outside of academia. But does that include profess.ors? Or, for that matt~r, admimstrators and offtce workers? At U11ion the answer ·· to these questions is an ern-· phatic \yes\! · The Unionaires provides the people who keep Union on it's feet with the chance to let it all hang out. What are t~e Unionaires? They are an m· 'formal music group whose members .include professors; maintenance workers, office staff and even a\dministrators; including George Richards of the Personnel Department. .In fact, everyone on .the campus can be jnvolved except the undergraduate students. What does the Unionaires repertoire consist of? Mostly what is described by member Marquerite · Potochney as \light\ music. This means the music is mostly snow tunes and uplifting-though . not nece~arily religious-;--so~gs~ So don't expect the ¥mona~es to tockout Qn songs like David Lee Roth's \Yank-ee .~ Rose.\ According t~ Ms. Potoclmey t~e . Unionaires has a \therapeub~· value, providing a break in the day'' and send~g it's m~mbe~s back to work With a songm their hearts.. · The Unionaires practice ifi · the rehe~~l room of the ;\rts building. So far, they have only performed orice in public-at the Staff :Association Spring Lt.incheon at Hale House last spring. However, the Unionaires do want .to put on a holiday show to be presented at Old Chapel. Anyone who feels the Unionaires may be for them will be glad to know that the group is· looking for new members. If you are interested, the Office of Graduate and Continuing Studies sponsors the group. The Unionaires are also -willing to perform at school functions. This is certainly not the last time the campus will hear of the Unionaires. They are definitely going-to be more in the spot- light in the near future, especially with their interest in becoming an on-campus per- fol'Qling gtoijp.

Sam Kinison has been one of the hardest working comics in the business this past year, but it wasn't always like that. When Sam was a child growing up in Peoria, Illinois, . his· father was a minister at his: church.

The Traveling Troupe will present \Scenes ·in Motion\ in four locations around campus later - this month. An ·idea was put forth by lllennbers of ~ountebanks to organize a set of scenes or short one-act plays to involve more students in theatre and to provide entertainment for the campus community. Three directors, Jerri Clark · Director of the Student Center, Randi Goldstein '88 and Tony Palone '87 expressed an interest in the Troupe. Auditions wete held in September and eighteen . students were cast in five scenes.

There were a few players wllo had better seasons than others bllt in most cases, not by mucll. The players that stoodabovEtheothers were Montreal's !l:'im Raines, Philadelphia~s· Mike Schmidt, Houston's M.ilte Scott and Los Ang-el e::!il'' Fernando Valenzuela. !tames ended up the season hittiilg a .334 which was good en01ugll ~o wili him the batting crowt. · He had the league's higltest on-base per- centage (.413~, stole 70 bases and he hit 35 doubles and 10 triples. In Philadelphia, Mike Schmidt had anotber out- standing ye8!1'. lie again led the league in horne r1111s with 'IT, he batted a respectable .~, led the league in RBl's with 119, crossed the !Plate f1 times and had an on•base percentage of .390. Mike Scott of the western divisional champs had an outstanding sea&on on the mound besides leading the league in strikeouts and E.R.A. with 306 and a 2.22 respectively. Scott pitched one no hitter and almost collected his second at the end of the season. Although his no hitter was not the pret- tiest sight to see, it was a no- hitter, and he ended up the season with a questionable 18-10 record. Fernando Valenzuela had one of his best seasons yet for the Dodgers. He ended· the year with 242 strikeouts, second only to Scott, his E.R.A. was a respectable 3.14 and his record was a league.leading 21-11. Outstandingly, 20 of those games were complete. Unfortm1ately, both Scott and Valenzuela are pitchers and it will be hard for either of them to win the MVP. The · contest therefore is between Mike Sch- midt and Tim Raines and depending on how Gary Carter does in October, he might be in contention also. Mike Schmidt will take the National League Most Valuable Player award this year, simply because he has played better than anyone else in' the league and the fact that he plays almost this weU every year should not hurt him. Don Mattingly and Mike Sch· rnidt are my choices for their leagues' most valuable players. They both, in my. opinion; demonstrated that they wer-e the most useful in their service to their respective teams. If the sports writers who will choose the winners see it differently, maybe they, too, should get out their dictionaries. Siena's Comeback Thwarts Union By CHRISSRERIDAN It's been a l()ng time since Union's Men's Rugby Club lost two matches ill a row. That long time ended last Saturday when the ruggers :fell to Siena by the misleading ~e~re of 12-7. \It was a real t()ugh game,\ felt Jeff ZOirn. \It could have. gone either W~ay.\ It could have, in factt do11e just that. Zorn would know, e~nsidering he was the one that SC()red the first try of the gBmle,. rUillling through and around Siena's defen~e. And with .a cheer from the crowd, Uni()n pllt four points up ·on the board...;£ our points more than the defending fall cham- pions had. 'l'he extra point was missed and the score stood at 5- 0. The firslt half ended with Union ahe!ad by the same margin. The second half began with Siena going downhill (due to the slop.e .~f the field) and charging iru f()r their first try of the game to tie tllings up, 4-4. When going for the extra point to put thern up 6-4, Siena's kicker rna-de the mistake of walking tow.rarclthe ball to fix its position witlll)ut asking per- mission of the referee-putting the ball in play. And, for the second time ip two weeks, Union's hoiDker Dave Blee ran toward the l:lall and kicked ·it away from the dumbfounded Siena player to spoil the extra point. Now, wii.th 1he score tied, Union marched uphill towards Siena's try-zone. When a penalty was called on Siena, about 30 meters from the goal, Union called on Pat DiCierbo to go for the penalty kick. DiCierbo didn't let his team- mates down, and hit the three- pointer to put Union back up, 7- 4. Still marching up the field, Union started again bringing the ball t()wards Siena's goal when Siena regained possession and booted the ball down to Union's end. The ball rolled, and bounced downhill all the way past Union's trynzone into the street, calling for a serum- down, 5-meters from Union's goal. Siena ended up scoring the try but missed the e~ra point, 8-7. · \It seemed (in the second half) that whenever we mar- ched the ball to their end, they'd just kick it and it would roll all the way down to our end,\ Zorn said. He continued, \We drove them down the field .... there's no question in my mind that we outplayed them all game.\ Siena \scored\ again near the end of the game when one of their player-s ran out of bounds to avoid a tackle and then ran back in for the try. The touch- ·judge didn't see the rugger's body g() out of bounds, therefore, the try stood, making the final score 12-7. \We were lacking basic in- tensity,'' DiCierbo said. ''I think that's the reason they scored their tries. We could have played a smarter, more intense game.\ Zorn felt that the reason for Union's Joss didn't have anything to do with con- ditioning. \We .had a lot of improvement on the week before. We were in a lot better shape. Stamina was not tbe reason we lost.\ Perhaps even a greater loss than the game was the loss for at least one game, and perhaps, the season, of eighth· man Jeff Albrecht. With about ten minutes left in the game, ~lbrecht and one of Union's k:ey runners, Steve Delano, collided• -putting a disoriented Delano on the sideline, and a light-headed Albrecht saying \no matter what, I'm not leaving the game.\ With the true spirit of a Union rugger, Albrecht got to his feet and was right in on the very ne~ tackle. However, the very ne~ tackle put a Siena knee to Albrecht's recently smacked head, and the intense rugger went down for perhaps the first time of hif': career. Albrecht was brought to the hospital, and released. He will definitely be out for Union's homecoming match against Arsenal City this weekend, however, Albrecht, labeled by some as the \best rugby player in Upstate New York\ could possibly be back in the lineup for Union's last three matches. Delano, who suffered a C()ncussion in the collision, will also be out this weekend, b11t he, too, may be back for the reet of the season. ' Crew Captures Mayor's Cup 8y Ml\.lt.K Bl:JRTON and DAVm JONES This past ~aturday the men's varsity 'heavyweight crew fought higll '\Vinds and rough water to ~apture the Mayor's Cup for the second. straight year at the Head of the Mohawk Regatta. -rile victors crossed the finish linE ahead of New York Athletic Cl11b followed by OARS of Albany, Skidmore and the Union varsity lightweight crew. Unioll's heavies covered the three-mil~ course in 17 minutes and: 6 seconds, a full26 secOnds alleacl of .NY AC. Coach Ciovacco ;St..ated, \I am sur- prised we odfd so well. We have done very little physical training in preparation for this race and tile other crews have trained ftOr · months to get reEJdy.\ The Varsity Heavyweight Eight consisted of .John Wyatt, David Jones, Rich Chandler, John Lovisolo, Greg Clark, Mark Burton, Ted Eveleth, Dave Sveden and coxswain Joe Murphy. Tom Sartini, Kevin Rampe, Dave Greenlaw, Andy Bick, ·Chuck Lane, Steve Tulevich, Dave Gascoyne, DJ Straker and Coxswain Chris Geib rowed in the Varsity Lightweight boat. Schenectady Mayor Karen Johnson was on hand to present the trophy and mugs to the winners at their new location near Rexford Bridge. In other races, Union took second in the Open Fours race and, later in the day, John Ciovacco and Rich Chandler turned in an impressive victory in the Double Sculls race. Said Ciovacco of Chandler, \He's so powerful through the water ... he rowed us to victory, I just steered!, Earlier in. the day, coach Ciovacco came in second in the men's open single sculls. Also, the men's novice bclat rowing in their first regatta, finished the race with great poise, after completing the three-mile course. Crew Notes: Victory ran in the family Saturday as both of John Wyatt's parents competed in and won single scull races. As of Tuesday, Union is still on the waiting list to get into the Head of the Charles, on October 19. This means that it is unlikely that they will get a chance t() compete. However, the cre\V will be racing at the Head of tile FiSh in . Sarat.oga Springs oil November 1st.

There were a few players wbo had better seasons than others but in most cases, not by much. The players that stood above the others were Montreal's Tim Raines, Philadelphia's Mike Schmidt, Houston's Mike Scott and Los Ang-eles' Fernando Valenzuela.

He had the league's highest on-base per- centage (.413), stole 70 bases and he hit 35 doubles and 10 triples. In Philadelphia, Mike Schmidt had another out- standing year. He again led the league in home runs with 37, he batted a respectable .290, led the league in RBI's with 119, crossed the plate '11 times and had an on-base percentage .of .390, Mike Scott of the western divisional champs had an outstanding season on the mound besides leading the league in strikeouts and E.

Siena's Comeback Thwarts Union By CHRIS SHERIDAN It's been a long time since Union's Men's Rugby Club lost two matches in a row. That long time ended last Saturday when the ruggers fell to Siena by the misleading score of 12-7. \It was a real tough game,\ felt Jeff Zorn. \It could have. gone either way.\ It could have, in fact, done just that. Zorn would know, considering he was the one that scored the first try of the game, running through and aroWld Siena's defense. And with a cheer from the crowd, Union put four points up on the board-four points more than the defending fall cham- pions had. The extra point was missed and the score stood at 5- 0. The first half ended with Union ahead by the same margin. The second half began with Siena going downhill (due to the slope of the field) and charging in for their first try of the game to tie things up, 44. When going for the eKtra point to put them up 6-4, Siena's kicker made the mistake of walking toward the ball to fix its position without asking per- mission of the referee-putting the ball in play. And, for the second time i~ two weeks, Union's hooker Dave Blee ran toward the ball and kicked ·it away from the dumbfoWlded Siena player to spoil the extra point.

Siena ended up scoring the try but missed the extra point, a-7. · \It seemed (in the second half) that whenever we mar- ch~d the bal} to their end, they'd just kick it and it would roll all the way down to our end,\ Zorn said. He continued, \We drove them down the field.... there's no question in my mind that we outplayed them all game.\ Siena \scored\ again near the end of the game when one of their players ran out of bounds to avoid a tackle and then ran back in for the try. The touch- . judge didn't see the rugger's body go out of bounds, therefore, the try stood, making the final score 12-7. \We were lacking basic in- tensity,\ DiCierbo said. \Ithink that's the reason they SC()red their tries. We could have played a smarter, more intense game.\ Zornfeltthat the reason for Union's loss didn't have anything to do with con- ditioning. ''We had a lot of improvement on the week before. We were in a lot better shape. Starnina was not the reason we lost.\ Perhaps even a greater loss than the game was the loss for at least one garn.e, and perhaps, the season, of eighth-man Jeff Albrecht. With about ten minutes left in the game, Albrecht and one of Union's key runners, Steve Delano, collided- -putting a dis(Jriented Delano on the sideline, a11d a light-headed Albrecht saying \no matter what, I'm not leaving the game.\ With the true spirit of a Union rugger, Albrecht got to his feet and was right in on the very next tackle. However, the very next tackle put a Siena knee to Albrecht's recently smacked head, and the intense rugger went down for perhaps the first time of hi~ career. Albrecht was brought to the hospital, and released. He will definitely be 4lut for Union's homecoming match against Arsenal City this weekend, however, Albrecht, labeled by some as the ''best rugby player in Upstate New York\ could possibly be back in the lineup for Union's last three matches. Delano, wbo suffered a concussion in tlle collision, will also be out this weekend, but he, too, may be back for the reet of the season. Crew Captures Mayor's Cup 8y MARK BURTON and DAVID JONES This past Saturday the men's varsity heavyweight crew fought high winds and rough water to capture the Mayor's Cup for the second straight year at the Head of the Mohawk Regatta. The victors crossed the finish line ahead of New York Athletic Club followed by OARS of Albany, Skidmore and the Union varsity lightweight crew. Union's heavies covered the three-mile course in 17 minutes and 6 seconds, a full 26 seccnds ahead of NY AC. Coach Ciovacco stated, \I am sur- prised we did so well. We have done very little physical training in preparation for this race and the other crews have trained for months to get ready.\ The Varsity Heavyweight Eight consisted of .John Wyatt, David Jones, Rich Chandler, John Lovisolo, Greg Clark, Mark Burton, Ted Eveleth, Dave Sveden and coxswain Joe Murphy. Tom Sartini, Kevin Rampe, Dave Greenlaw, Andy Bick, Chuck Lane, Steve Tulevich, Dave Gascoyne, DJ Straker and Coxswain Chris Geib rowed in the Varsity Lightweight b()at. Schenectady Mayor Karen Johnson was on hand to present the trophy and mugs to the winners at their new location near Rexford Bridge. In other races, Union took second in the Open Fours race and, later in the day, John Ciovacco and Rich Chandler turned in an impressive victory in the Double Sculls race. Said Ciovacco of Chandler, \He's so powerful throllgh the water ... he rowed us t() victory, I just steered!\ Earlier in the day, coach Ciovacc() came in second in the men's open single sculls. Also, the men's novice boat rowing in t:lleir first regatta, finished the race with great poise, after completing the three-mile course. Crew Ntltes: Victory ran in the family Satt~rday as both of John Wyatt's IJarents competed in and won .sirlgle scull races. As of Tuesday, Union is still on the waiting list t() get into the Head of the Charles, ()n October 19. This mea11.s tllat it is Wllikely that they will get a chance to compete.

Steve scored his fifth and sixth goals of the season in Union's biggest game yet this season. His first goal gave Union the lead, 1-0, with 7% minutes left in the first half, knocking .home a .crossiJlg pass from RichEngdahl. With the score tied at 1-1 in the second. half; Steve scored again.

Well, it's something like Soccer 1 BeatsiAitiGny' ·By MARK ZIMMERMAN Last week, the Union varsity soccer team hosted local rival, Albany State for an action packed half of soccer. The second half would have also proved t'! be an exciting one had Albany State decided to stay for it. With 47 seconds remaining in ·a tied and extremely ig.tense · game, the Albany State C()/lch took his players off the field and headed for home. This gave Union a forfeit victory and upped the team record to a very respectabl-e 5·1-1. Union .tbreatened to score several times during the first half with an excellent attack up the left side, led by jwior Dave Tewksbury. However~ each time they self-destructed by ·not capitalizing on nwnero11s op- portWlities. Albany made no threats until well into the first half. With 11 minutes to go in the half, forward, Tihan Presbie of Albany was viciously knocked to the ground. Fifty•seven seconds later, after taking a moment to catch his breath, '·Presbie got his revenge. Standing just inside the penalty line, he received the ball from the left side, and shoUt io: f()r a score to put Albany on board first. At that point things became quite intense. Union brought·th~ ball downfield, · Tewksbury dribbled into the. left corner looking to make a pass \With Albany State player Mike Jasmin defending. The two players foaght for the ball. Jasmin fell to the ground. As he did so, he pulled down Tewksbury with him for wllich Tewksbmy was not pleased. As the· Albany pla,yer got up, he physically jumped on top of Tewksbury. This led to a fight between those ·two players. Meanwhile, both benches cleared .and minor scuffles were developing ·in other plac::es. After ten or so minutes of bedlam, sanity was restored The Albany player was issued a red card and dismissed from the game While Tewksbury remained in the game. This led to the Albany coach becoming quite enraged as to why both players had not been ejected instead of just the Albany player. Yet the decision was not reversed and play continued. During the next few minutes, Albany was issued several yellow cards, many of them coming on very questionable calls. With time winding down in the half, Union forward, Bob Crandall received a pass from the right side. He i.tnmediatelyturned to the goal, and with a powerful kick scored the tying goal. Emotions were quite strong ()n both sides at this . point. However, at this point, the Albany coach approached Bob Magee of Union and stated that he would be taking his players home at the half. Coach Magee asked him to finish the game, but Coach Schieffelin had already made up ~s rnin. d. With 47 seconds left m the half, .Albany was issued one ad- ditional yenow card. At this point, the Albany coach, once again enraged by the referee's decisions, told his players to leave the field. After waiting the officil:!l amount of time, the referee called the game a forfeit. When asked about the game, Coach Schieffelin of Albany said, \Union. is definitely the I:Jest team that we have faced this seasort. I have . nothing against Union, but I'm not letting my players get pushed arotmd by the refet·ee.'' While the victory was not in the . classic style of winning, Union will take it. If the team plays up to its potential for the remainder of the season, there .is no telling what they could accomplish this year; ~hat. In the American League this year . there were several baseball players whose achievements are worthy of recognition. At the top of.the list are the league's two leading candidates, Boston's pitching ace Roger Clemens and New York's own Don Mattingly. Clemens ende.d up the year with a 24-4 record, an E.R.A .of 2.48 and.238 strikeouts. His statistics alone are very· impressive-, but nm,~nougll 1 tuwmhim'tli~·MVP:· What is enough, though, is the fact that Clemens saved the Red Sox from falling out of first place after the all star break. When the Red Sox went 3-13 after the break, Clemens owned all three victories. Every time the Red Sox began a losing streak, , Clemens was called upon. He always managed to get the victory and start the Red Sox on their winning ways. In addition, who can forget his record breaking 19-strikeout performance against the Mariners. Clemens' only competition for . the award should be Don Mattingly. · Mattingly had another spec- tacular year both on the field · and · in the batter's box. His statistics on the year were by far the most impressive in the league. He ended up the year second in the batting race with a .352 avg., drove in 113 runs, hit 31 home runs, crossed the plate 117 times, led the league in hits with 238 and, most _importantly, to him, he broke a 59-year-old record, previously held by Lou Gehrig; by hitting a .league- leadihg 53 doubles. On the .field, Mattingly played near perfect ball at first base and even at third. That;s right, third base. When Yankee third baseman Mike Pagliorulo was injured and needed a rest, Mattingly crossed over anc;l played third for three games and committed only one error. Both of these baseball players had truly outstanding seasons . but .you also cannot ignore the outstanding seasons of · such players as Minnesota's Kirby . Puckett, Boston's Jim Rice and Cleveland's Joe Carter. Puckett batted an impressive· .328, third only to Mattingly and Boggs and · was second in the league in both · runs and hits with 119 and 223 respectively. In Boston, Jim Rice had a year that was good enough to help him lead his. team to a divisional title. Rice 'batted .321 and knocked in 110 runs. He hit 39 doubles· and picked up 200 hits.

The Engineers scored the first three times they had the ball. WPI took a Union punt at its own 43 and marched the 57 yards in eight plays. For· tunately for the Dutchmen, their offense was also on track. Followillg the kickoff, Union drove 82 yards in 10 plays with Junior tailback Todd Walker .soorillg from 11 yards out.

'l'he questions ranged from \What is the woman's role in Nicaragua?\ to \How has it changed under the Sandi.nistas?\ and \What are the Cont.ras?\ \It is Wlderstood,\ said Ms. Rocha, \that most (North) Americans really do not understand my country and the plight of my people.'' And it must be granted that this is a true statement. The questions that seemed to be the most basic elicited the most enlightening responses. Thus, the question \What are the Contras?\ was a question that most Americans need answered. When asked, Union Professor Byron Nichols of political science responded by saying that the Contras' (or counter- revolutionary forces) are former. supporters of the ousted ~moza regime, and that they for various reasons do not support the present. Sandinista leadership. Many of these combatants may have supported the revolution at its outset but once they realized that this revolution would not · give them the power that they wanted; they became Contras. . U.S. support of the Contras stems from U.S. support of the. Somoza government. The Somoza family was placed in power in 1934 while U.S. Marines were occupying the country. It is the belief in Washington that a stable, sympathetic government is necessary in Nicaragua in the face of the growing trend toward communism and increased Cuban and Soviet influence in the region.

Present at the assembly of board members were Student Treastees Mark Webster ('88) and Julie Mountain ('87). Discussed at the meeting were topics including student affairs, academic affairs, finances, budget, college resources, and building and grounds. The trustees addressed two major student affairs issues. The first concerned the five- person suite situation. The reason for this fact was that an additional 35 more freslunen decided to choose Union as their college than was anticipated. According to Dean of Admissions Kenneth A. Nourse this fact shows that Union's reputation is definitely growing. A second topic addressed was the insurance problem facing fraternities and sororities. Insurance premiums for these institutions have skyrocketed due to the fact that they are such high-risk groups. Not many insurance companies are willing to cover them, but the college is helping out by looking into some agencies who will provide insurance at lower rates. At the next Board of Trustees meeting in January the insurance problem report will be submitted and decisions will be made then. Another area discussed was academic affairs. The proposals for changes in curriculum requirements and the liberal learning program were brought to the board's attention. These proposals will be brought before the Academic Affairs Committee and will be voted on in two weeks. College Finances and the budget situation were not under consideration but will be further discussed at the January meeting. The College's resource situation ( ie: South Mrican investments) was also called to attention.

Contra, Sandinista Movements Defined First .. Hand at Rally By KRISTINE BURNHAM Editors' Note: Due to the nature of the Nicaraguan situation, it is impossible to cover each aspect of the revolution. This article explores one point of view from a local speech by a Nicaraguan citizen and analyzes it with the help of outside commentaries. It is also the intent of this article to clarify the development of the Contra and Sandinista movements In Nicaragua. Last Thursday evening, October 9, a surprising number of people braved the cold, damp weather to hear, first hand, what is truly occurring in Nicaragua. Estela Rocha, a 29 year-old teacher, spoke through an hiterpreter to a crowd of approximately 50 at the Emmanuel Baptist Church on Nott Terrace. Ms. Rocha spoke as a teacher, a mother, and as a citizen of Nicaragua. She felt that it was her duty to come to America to talk to \North Americans\ to try to explain to them what she had seen and experienced in her country. Ms. Rocha herself had participated in the 1979 overthrow of the U.S.-backed Somoza 'dictatorship. Under the present Sandinista regime, she has worked in the widely successful National Literacy Campaign (in a rural coWltry such as Nicaragua, it is common for literacy rates to be extremely high). The campaign was quoted as having reduced illiteracy from over 50 percent to just 17 percent. Today, Ms. Rocha works in Esteli, Nicaragua, tracking both children and adults. The evening was highly emotional. When speaking of the revolution, there was a smattering of applause from the audience. When Ms. Rocha spoke of the actuality of the sitttation in her native land, most all those present were listening intently. The crowd itself was a cross-section of eld~rly and high school students as well as those who were obviously social militants. This was an opportunity rarely seen in t()day's society-a person coming to America with the eJq>ress purpose of telling the truth as she perceived it. The majority of the evening was spent in a question-answer session. The questions ranged from \What is the woman's role in Nicaragua?\ to \How has it changed under the Sandinistas?\ and \Wbat are the Contras?\ \It is understood,\ said Ms. Rocha, \that most (North) Americans really do not Wlderstand my country and the plight of my people.\ And it must be granted that this is a tme statement. The questions that seemed to be the most basic elicited the most enlightening responses. Thus, the question ''What are the Contras?\ was a question that most Americans need answered. When asked, Union Professor Byron Nichols of political science responded by saying that the Contras. (or counter- revolutionary forces) are former supporters of the ousted Somoza regime, and that they for various reasons do not support the present Sandinista leadership.

The Forum.delineated the system by which students' ideas could be added to the proposal and discussed possible problems that might arise from the program. In addition, the different subcommittees described their efforts involving the Delta Upsilon eviction and complaints about the library. See related article on Wesleyan University's Liberal Learning Review, p. 3 The Student Forum will gathel' opinions at an open meeting this Sunday (see relate-d article, p. 1, col. 5 ). Those suggestions will then be passed on to the Academic Affair:> Committee (AAC), who will doecide which suggestions have merit and then revise them in written form. Steve Moss, president of the Student Forum, said, \Short motions are more likely to be accepted than a long, ten-page type of commentary.\ According to Moss, the Curric-ulum, if approved, will be implemented depending on when the necessary new faculty can be hired and upon how soon faculty can modify courses to the new \slant\ of the curriculum. The AAC will make that decision. One question raised at the meetin.g was if the changes will require more new faculty members than the 13 already planned. If the proposal is passed, with possible modifications, the College will know where to allot new positions. Gavin Morton, the Forum's vice-president for academics, noted the new emphasis on history and mentioned that the history Continued on page 3 ~· ~-;·.a;-~ Student Input Process Explained By ALISON WILLIAMS Within the next two weeks students will be able to voice their opinions about the proposal of the new liberal learning program.

The undergraduate students presently using the liberal learning program will be given a choice between either program. The opinions of the students are important whether they choose the new system or the old system. If the Dresent students at Union agree with the proposal, they will greatly influence the incoming freshman who will be required t() use the new program. The program is to benefit the education of the student. ''Many students have learned to beat the system and avoided taking certain courses and still fill their liberal learning requirements,\ said Professor Zwicker, head of the liberal learning committee. The new system will stop this for a while until it has to be revised again. Professor Zwicker said that students have come to him after graduation and told him how they had beat the system, but MW they regret it. Any student wishing to voice his or her opinion may do so by bringing ideas, preferably in written form, to the Oct. 19th meeting or by contacting any member of the Student Formn. It is important that they have some input on how the students feel for they will represent the student body to the faculty who will be meeting to discuss the proposal. This new proposal must be accepted by the faculty. They will be voting on it November 5.

The meetings were Nichols, Rocha Discuss U.S. Impact on Contras In the area of building and · grounds tbere were three areas mentioned.

Gym and the Stud:ent ' Center. The gym should be · uneventful, but covered a Wide variety of topics. Since this was the year's first meeting, reports on the various issues were the general norm. Jan11ary's meeting is shaping up to be a more significant session. Continued from page 1 when Somoza was ousted in 1979 and the Sandinistas came to power, they patterned their revolution after the Cuban -revolution. Today, Cuban influence is seen throughout Nicaragua. When asked if the Cuban influences have propelled U.S. action against the Sandinistas and helped the \Contra\ cause, Professor Nichols replied that there is a definite military threat perceived by the presence of Cubans in Nicaragua; there are definitely advantageous military positions in the country. Additionally, U.S. ideological conservatives perceive the Cuban presence as a communist threat at \America's backdoor.\ There is also the question of Soviet aid. Again, Nicaragua is patterned after Cuba. Cuba received approximately 3 billion dollars a year in Soviet aid; yet their economy is in a shambles. Nicaragua has not done much better. Thus, the early gains of the Sandinistas have been frozen by the lack of competence in dealing with economic matters. Ms. Rocha reflected her' views on Cuban involvement when she explained that the Cubans were in Nicaragua helping to defend Nicaragua against invasion and aggression. Ms. Rocha echoed the request of the Sandinista regime for Americans to go themselves to see what is really going on in Nicaragua. Professor Nichols stated that this was a conunon event. The Sandinistas have enough popular support that they don't need to hide anything. Again, in mirroring the Cuban revolution, the Sandinistas have widespread support that Professor Nichols estimates at 70-80 percent of the population. The figure is low at this time because those middle class businessmen and political refugees haven't begun their exodus (as they did from Cuba). revolution would die.\ Rocha said that through her dose contact with Jhe Sandinista youth, she has fowtd that they do not see the U.S. youth as enemies, but paWils in the games of politicians asleep as they had been prior to the revolution. This attitude, this sleep, that America finds itself in is truly undeniable. \Most people, when informed of the true situations in Nicaragua, find themselves wondering where U.S. support actually C!>mes from,\ stated an observer at the lecture. In fact, recent events have led to the serious questioning of American actions in Nicaragua and all of Central America. The U.S. CIA is directly involved in direct actions against the people of Nicaragua,\ Ms. Rocha stated in reference to the downed U.S. budget cargo plane and the capt_ure of Mr. Hasenfus. Most people, when informed of the true situation • . . find thems.elves wondering where U.S. support comes from. When asked a bout the possible implications of the Hasenfus affair, Professor Nichols stated that the Sandinistas could use the Hasenfus ·affair for the furthering of their own position. Nichols put forth that the best course of action that they could take would be to put the American on trial and convict him and, then, expel him from Nicaragua, thus enunciating their position and furthering their human rights standing. However, there has been a decided lack of wtderstanding of the Hasenfus affair on the part of Americans in general. Because causes and actions in this case are so hazy, the Administration may avoid a major catastrophe with regard to public opinion. The public, it seems, is ready to accept Regan's rhetoric about his support of \. . • ordinary Americans fighting their personal battles for freedom The Sandinista youth • • • do throughout the world.\ not see the U.S. youth as Another recent incident enemies, but as pawns in the regarding specific occurrences games of politicians • • • with regard to Nicaragua is that of the Veterans Fast for Life.

It is undeniable that the situation in Nicar-t~gua is a confrusing one, but. lecturers such as Ms. Rocha shed new . light e>n the subject. Those who look may find a diverse group of individuals coming out beyond their personal positions and taki11g stands against U.S. involvement in Nicaragua. . Sister Joan Vlaunof St. John the Baptist church has signed the Pledge of Resistence and has said \that \With regard to the situation in Nicaragua,\ you ~ann.:~t believe in the inhmnanity of a person versus anoth.er person. She also said that ' 'it is very hard to take a stand with the Contras.\ Professor Nichols went even further when he said, \U.S. forei~n ·policy in Central America is completely mispLaced.\ ThiiS, it is plain to see that there are people who share Ms. Roch.a 's convictions. And beneath the layer of 1 sleeping' Ame:ricans is a gro11p, though not completely organized, that as in!lividuals will take a stand for Nicaragua and its people.

TABLE EVERY FRIDAY 12:30- 1:30PM HALE HOUSE Paul Haake, professor of chemistry, called the plan \a definite step backward for general education in science,'' because students will have more requirements outside of the sciences. Some professors think it will be difficult to define \mode of inquiry\ courses since some departments house subdisciplines and some modes of inquiry exist, in more than one department. William Trousdale, associate professor of physics, said of the rule requiring students to take their six mode of inquiry courses in separate departments, \It isn't clear to me that it's better to take for instance, Physi~s 101 and Chemistry 101 instead of Chemistry 101 and 102.\ The recently rejected (by the faculty) proposal on general education would have established new \expectations\ for students beginning with the Wesleyan class of 1991. The compromise proposal rejected by the faculty wstS the original EPC proposal plus a requirement that students take one additional course outside their major and cluster divisions. Under the current system, students are expected to take at This Week's Events ' Thursday, October 16 Geraldine Murphy, EPC Chair and professor of Englisll, said that new courses would not be necessary because she knew of about eight or nine English classes already in the Course Book which would qualify as \mode of inquiry\ courses. Tololyan responded, ''We're going to re-label some course.s and say 'now we're going to make damn stu\e you take them'. That's not Genera] Education reform, that's shuffling numbers and paper.'' John Bonin, professor of Economics and an EPC member, responded to concern about students forming clusters and then later deciding to major: in that area. \We imagine a cluster as primarily built up in the last two years,\ he said. \A student might have to grapple for a couple of courses in the last two years (but not the entire cluster).\ One professor commented oil the claim made by some proponents of the proposal that the new expectations would lead to innovation in the curriculum. \To talk about new courses is an absurdity,\ she said. \We generate new courses through our research interests (not on demand).\ 3:45.

CONCORDJENSIS, October 16~ 1986 PageS FEATURES Drinker's Exclusive Talk of the Town By KRISTiNE ROBINSON and MAL\ ENZER Good day, drinkers! Once again, we greet you with the . hopes of making your lives more lively ana enjoylible. So we will not open. our recipe files and turn our thoughts to the written page. However, before we become overly engroSSed in thiS scholarly activity, we have an official aimollncement to relay from the Executive Board of the Lushitivity Council. As this is the .fifth week •of the rather improbaj;)l~ exiStence of this column, we feel it .is time to initiate a contest of sorts. We would like you, . our - devoted readers, to submit written, tested, and precise recipes to tbe Lushitivity Council. These will be recreated for judging by the liquor lab staff, which is · underg()ing intense retraining at the moment. But we'll explain that later. The rules are important, and they are as fullows: 1. All contestants must be at least 12-oopst...;21 to enter. 2. All entries must be made by full time Union College students only. 3. All entries must be fully tested. 4. Names of conteStllJlts must be included with each entry. 5. Full descriptions of taste, appearance, and origin mnst be ine..luded with each recipe. The winning drink shall be used iri an upcoming article, with .full recognition and dedication to the contestant. ANDTHAT'SNOTALL!!!

That's right, this is NOT a major breaktlu:ough discovery of the liquor lab here on campus. After the troubles encoUntered last week with our staff's inability to present us with a proper lush•like formula, we have issued an intense r& training session for our lab-ites, and in the meantime are borrowing from the wealth of Wisdom available to us through this wel established lush institution. I guess that was the history. Pretty boring, huh? Well,. at least now that that's out of the way. we can tell you how to make the drink. we just hope it helps kill those \studying blues\ (as if we'd actually know what those were).

All entries must be submitted no later than Saturday, October 25 to either Box 191 .or 2065. Now, if you think we are doing this because we are out of drink ideas, well, you're totally wrong. We simply feel that it would be a waste not to draw from the wealth :Df alcoholic geniU$ on this campUs. AND NOW for the Drink of the Week. With respect to the upcoming midterro wee!k, we have chosen a drink we feel fits the mood of many studiers. Now, we know you .are going to .take this totally the wrong way, but, frankly, we just don't care, The name of this week's drink is the ORGASM, and you can take that in any context you choose. If you want to be perverted, that's fine, but just picture the stress release of the typical throat or digit head during a 'study break, and this choice will make a bit more sense. Regardless, the definition of this title is \a much sought after experience,\ and we feel the drink fully deserves this name. Unfortunately, the Lushitivity Council has no claim on this drink. Credit must be given where it is due. So, as we hang our heads, may we admit that . WELL, here's how to make an ORGASM: mix 1 ounce of heavy cream with lh ounce each of creme de cacao, amaretto, triple sec, and vodka. See how it gots it's name? We suggest you force feed this to the most annoying throat you know. Complete stress release is guaranteed. Then you can study, too. If you so choose, that is. THERE. Now, tell us, was that really so painful? Sorry if we . offended (or excited) anyone. But, lik~ we said, it really just doesn't make much difference to us. Remember to submit those entries. Most bars should be suffering about this time m the term, so be creative, and have fun. Now, don't forget, .everybody: keep smiling and studying (?), and never go to bed sober. \To see the college produce . a curricUlum and attitude in . the conununity that would • endorse the intrinsic value of the liberal arts as the basis of all education, including pre~ ·professionalism education.'' ·Prof. Ludwig, Dept. of PbHosophy • \To see greater dialogue between the faculty and the students both of a scholarly and personal nature in more infonnal settings.\ Prof. Kaplan, Dept. of Sociology. .New York Times Reporter Fails to Satisfy Union Audience By COLIN INGERSOLL On October 8, New York Times economics reporter Kenneth Gilpin III came to lecture at Union College during Minerva Hour. The lecture which took place at 11:30 a.m. was held in the Music Room in Schaeffer Library. Mr. Gilpin lectured for the first 20 minutes which was then followed by a 45- minute question and answer period. Mr. Gilpin ·graduated from Union College in 1972 with a B.A. in English and political science and was a member of the Psi Upsilon fraternity. He then proceeded on to Jolms Hopkins University. where he received a master's degree in international relations .. Following Johns Hopkins University, he worked at the World Bank in WashJngton, D.C. Afterwards he became the assistant editorial director at the Journal of Commel:'ce. Six years ago Mr. Gilpin was recruited by The New Yerk Times where he is presently an economics reporter. Mr. Gilpin was asked to talk about how the business section is put together and what kind of work goes into it. He talked for roughly 20 minutes on the specific details and daily schedule for that section, which was not quite what the students and professors at Union College had expected. Mr. Gilpin is one of 40 reporters out of a 90 mem.ber staff who work on the business section. He · then proceeded to give a detailed outline on what went on on a daily basis, discussing different Times editorial meetings taking place, what times reporters had to haye stories in .by, and how newsbeats were distributed among reporters. After talking for 20 minutes, Mr. Gilpin opened up with a .question-and- answer period. Both students and professors posed questions concerning actual economical situations where students directed their questions t()wards newspapering in general,,and specifically about Tb.e New York Times. One question that was asked was whether The New York Times really only served the wealthy people. However, as these questions were posed, it was apparent that he couldn't really provide cleat decisive answers that satisfied the crowd. It seemed that the lecture given by Mr. Gilpin was not w.hat students .and professors expected. The lecture was attended primarily by professors, and the students who did attend were ones that llave .a strong interest in the newspaper industry and would like to pursue it. Though there was a large turnout, the lecture did not appear to be that beneficial to students except for those interested in pursuing the field.

Students mingled up and down an. aisle made of 44 tables bordering the two basketball courts, .stopping at various stations to chat with the representatives of a variety of companies and learn about occupational opportunities, the application. process and to gain a general insight. The event also provided the companies with an excellent chance to spark student interest as well as recruit in an informal atmosphere.

This special fast day provides college communities the Wlique opportunity to unite their financial support in the fight against.world hunger. Oxfam America is an international, non-sectarian, non~profit agency .. that funds self-help development projects and disaster relief to poor · coWltries in .Mrica, Asia, and Latin America. Oxfam America also prepares and distributes educational materials for Americans on issues of development and hunger. The agency supports projects which work to increase self-reliance in local grassroots groups. (whose main concern is learning how to harvest their own food), and it gives special attention to women and disadvantaged minorities. The need for this fast is very clear when one considers some alarming facts on world hunger and poverty. At least fifteen million children die of hunger- related causes every year, and the numbers keep increasing. Another five hundred million people live in abject poverty. Oxfam America's goal is to help these people. With your support and help on November 6, Oxfam can realize its goal. You can support Oxfam's efforts to combat the hunger problem in one of two ways. If you are a student on the meal plan,. you may pledge one or all of your meals that you would normally eat on Thursday, Nov. 6. The college Food Service will, through a rebate plan, donate to Oxfam the equivalent cost of the meaJ(s) you choose to miss. If you are not on the meal plan, but still want to support the \Fast for World Harvest/' cash donations will be accepted at various locati()ns throughout the day (Nov. 6 ). For those of you on the meal plan, it is eKtrernely important that you sign up Monday and Tuesday (Nov. 3 and 4) with Oxfam volunteers who will be stationed at West and Old Chapel dining halls during ltmch and dinner hours. You must sign up before the 6th in order to give Food Service proper notification with regard to the number of meals you want credited to Oxfam. All Union students, faculty, and staff are urged to participate and to support this agency that aims to help others in the midst of harsh suffering.

College Gaming Association is proud to announce that we will be hosting the Ceuncll of tile Five Nations gaming convention. At about this time last year, the U.C.G.A. hosted this event for the first time, and enjC)yed such success that we· had to do it again, this year on October 24- .26. the convention had become too large for their limited facilities, and. an alliance between the two clubs was formed. The Schenectady Wargamers proVided the experience and the prestige, while we supplied facilities and .manpower. Last year, we played host to a gathering of about 225 garners from all parts of the United States and Canada. And, while we anticipate this year's attendance to be somewhat smaller, the experience gained last year will help to make this an even more exciting and First, for those of you who don't know , us, a little backgrC)und on the U.C.G.A. We are a group of about forty students :who share an interest in rolDplaying, strategy, and wargames. Once a week, our members get together for Open Gaming Night, where members get .a chance to .. try out new games, or introduce friends to old favorite games, Most· popular among these are games such as Advauced Dungeons & 'Dragons, Chatnpions, Starfleet Battles and Wnminati, but the variety .of games is almost endless. Many of our members have also developed their own game systems, and the club provides an . excellent opportunity for playtesting. We also publish a new.sletter of game-related articles and fiction twice each term, in which members give '\'learned discourse\ and \expert opinions\ on some topic in which .. they take , a special interest . .t\.nother important function of the club is to get players into smaller groups for the pW'pose of campaigning, or running a weekly, contintJing game. U!_stly, the U;C.G.A. holds several spe~ial yearly events, most notably the Winter Tournament and Spring Alumni Classic, and, of course, the upcoming convention. · smoothly .. rmt convention. include showings of many famous Dr. Who episodes, .as well as several classic fantasy and science-.fiction films. There will be an auction of gaming .goods, memorabilia, and ~collector's items. On Saturday, there will be a costume competition, with winners being selected in categories such as ·Fantasy costume, Literary Character, and Medieval Replica. Sunday's highlight will be a judging of miniatures painting, inclUding military, historic, and fantasy diQramas. Last, but certainly not least, on -saturday, we will be visited by Wendy and Richard Plnl, creators of ElfQlJest the internationally famous and critically acclaimed graphic fantasy saga ..

' - -- National Collegiate Alcohol Awareness Week (October 20..25) __ How much do you really know about drinking? As campuses around the country gear up for the third National Collegiate Alc~hol Awareness Week (October 2().;25), the scores frgm the secf!nd are just gettmg posted. Grades have shot up, though they're stdl not passmg: 59% of Americans can pass the E.A. T. (Equivalence Aptitude Test), up from 17% just four years ago. Pas~ing means knowing the simple ~ut crucial formula (and you don't need a calculator): The most common servmgs of beer (12 ounces), wine (5 ounces) and spirits (1¥4 ounces) contain equal amounts of alcohol. Why is passing the ~.A.T. and participating in Awarenes Week so im- portant? To be responsible, we need to know facts 1 not:myths ~bout alcohol. All those prep courses won't help the student wno gets behind the wheel thinking he's had \just a few beers.\Far too many accidents are caused by such misinformation. Maybe that's why 50% of all driving fatalities are caused by drunk drivers. And why two-thirds of all those arrested for DWI \just had beer.'' · Knowing some other common sense college survival tips may also save lives during the school yea~. supportive place where writers can talk to other writers about the process of composition,\ said Professor Alan Nelson, Dir~ctor of the Writing Center. Mrs. Sandy Langley, Assistant Director of the Center, emphasizes that the Centeris for all writers, not just weak ones. \The staff's capacity to help covers a broad range-not just English papers. The job of the Writing Center is to help students communicate points clearly and effectively.\ she said. Students who need help writing a lab or political science paper are strongly encouraged to use the Writing Center. \We · teach a writing process here,\ Nelson said. \Writers in any · major and class year may seek help.\\ He added that the Center is not only for students but also for anyone who needs help with writing. The Writing Center has several infonnative reference materials concerning technique· and style for st11dents to use. The Center also has a handbook, A Sbort Guide to Notes and Bibliography, which explains the standard form of documentation for · Union College. Nelson hopes that students will not use the Center as a last resort in a crisis situation. He said that quick granunatical \fix-ups\ will not help a student learn to write more effectively. · Students will develop a greater understanding of tne writing process by visiting the Writing Center on a regular basis. Langley stresses that the student tutors working at the Center are not all English majors--comp11ter science, political science, economics and Spanish are represented as well. In fact, one of the students is able to help students with · Spanish papers, slle said.

Former college president Dixon Ryan Fox stated, in his ,book Union C.ollege: An Unfinished History, ''A college does not belong to the living generation, save that for the time they own its opportunity. It is nearer the mark to say that the, living generati()n of students and teachers belong to the college .. Individuals who come by this opportunity, must take on an obligation of trust. They may use the college, but they must not use it up. More than that, every .good member adds to the strength and richness of the college tradition; for as has been observed, that tradition is tbe sum of the achievement of those who have lived a:nd worked in . it.\ (p. 8). . Therefore, each member of the college community contributes to the character and tradition of the College. Their interests should be· considered in detel'Illining the decisions made concerning the future of Union. The Administration must use their oversight to weigh the diverse requirements of the College and promote coherent long term goals. To effectively serve the needs of the College, the Ad- ministration must consult the various members of the , College Community. It is the responsibility of the members of the Colle_ge to educate themselves on the issues that concern them. and present intelligent arguments for these interests. Are we adhering to these standards in the treatment of the proposed curriclum changes? Union Must Save Its Fraternities and Sororities The message has been sent to Uni()n's 22 frater- nities and sororities that rising insurance costs could threaten their existence on campus. In perhaps the most exciting of the \strictly business\ happenings - that occtlfred · during Homecoming weekend, Assistant Dean of Students Robert Massa called together alumni members of Union's Greek organiz~tions to discuss the problem. Next year, Union's inst~rance company has demanded that each of the fraternities and sororities on campus post a $1 million bond of liability coverage. Clearly it will be in1possible for many of these organizations to either find or afford the cost of this type of insurance. In some cases, it wowd cost up to $10,000 to pay for this kind of coverage. It seems hardly likely, however, that Union can allow the insurance crunch to spell doom for its fraternities and sororities. There are two different solutions to this problem. Either fraternities and sororities join together to form a C()-{)p and find an insurance plan that will cover them all; or the College will have to subsidize the costs of insuring these groups. One can make a good case for asking Union to pay- the tab. Firstly, if the fraternities and sororities went bankrupt, the social life at the College- would take years to restructure. These organizations support a good majority of our social atmosphere. Additionally, the houses are excellent places for students to live closely together and learn from each other within the frame work of a social organization. It would be hard to imagine a Union College without the fraternities and sororities that scatter its campus. However, it is unlikely that the organizations can attend these costs. Many of the weaker groups can barely manage financial co~ditions at the present time. Thus, it is essential to their very existence for the College to finance its f1·aternities and sororities over the hump of today's insurance crisis.

Please, Mr. Hauser, you can certainly do better than that. Everyone says that you seem to be a bright guy, diligent and the whole deal. So why do we have to put up with the humiliation of being told that you could not use an extra sheet or two of paper to tell us the specifics. Is Union College rwming low on paper? Mighty unlikely. Hauser went on to say that the current students at Union are not paying for the College Center and Alumni Gym. His memory must be short. In a copy of last year's budget given to Dave Reisman, '87, on the condition that it not make its way to the Concordiensis on pain of death, Hauser explained that the $2,000,000 surplus from the budget had been applied tCJ the costs incurred by the construction of the two facilities. When questioned as to whether or not students could be refunded from the surplus Which had obviously- come from their pockets, HaW!er replied that the money had already been spent. Imagine that! ! Why would a College borrow money on a long~term basis at low interest rate and n()t invest it while it used available funds for short-term costs. r'm not an economist, but it smells pretty fishy to me. Ifi'mwrong, I am sure a copy of the budget, printed in the Concordiensis, wollld be the best way of proving it. I would appreciate the humiliation.

CONCORDIENSIS,~October ia, 1986 Page 13 ' ¥ • THE ARTS Sam Kinison • • • L_ ... ouder Than Hell . . - . - ByCARA TABACK. A crowd, reminiscent in behavior qf registration, Winter term 1985, gathered early Friday night in front of Memorial Chapel in anticipation of seats as close to Sam -· Kinison as theY could possibly find. Seats near the front are always most desirable for they provide a better cllance . of being abused from the cl\owd by the comedian (a masochistic American .characteristic .in itself) equally as much as they provide a good view. The -crowd forced its way against uilopen doors for at least a half an hour and. finally .it burst through the one solitary open door to scramble for the best pews. The enthusiasm refused to fade as it became obvious that the sbow would not begin at 8:00 as· scheduled. A 'wave' started in the right · hand balcony and circled the building manytimes after g-reat effort to get coordinated. With background music of Genesis, two crowds of people, seated across from each other, began chanting \Tastes Great\ and \Less Filling~' back and forth to big cheers from the remainder of the crowd. The \first gig\ on the 'Louder Than Hell' tour began with special guest Carl- LeBeau, a balding comedian with a pony tail and a black and red leather vest with a pair of.dice sewn on. He relied heavily on Visuals during his short routine as he· used full conunand of the stage to act like a six foot fly and to reenact a humorous skit about belng in a broken-down car, getting out and trying to thmnb a ride, all to no avail. His choice of language reminded one of Sean Penn's Jeff Spicoli in the movie Fast T~es at Ridgemont High, with his 'What's up, elude?' diction. Fifteen minutes and a new J]liCrQphone later, out strutted Sam Kinison, the man everyone had been waiting for, the history teacher in Back · to• School'. Dressed -in black sweatpants, beret and long leather coat he struck me as a combination of John Belushi, George Thorogood and Ozzy Osbourne. He began by saying that, \sexuality is wierd\ and how he knows no women who are into 'the commitment thing', as if all men longed. solely for conunitment, He did say that he has a hard time mingling· after his shows, · obviously so as he proceeded on · with his 'advice to men in the audience, about the women they love,' talk. of AIDs-he \doesn't grasp the gay movement.

The Undergraduate Review wiU soon be issuing a call for papers, and the editorial board hopes to broaden its readership, faculty support, and student participation this year. come Rock Hudson died and Richard Simmons doesn't even have a cold?\ ... The crowd became sort of hypnotized by his talk of AIDS as Kinison handed his drink up to D'Agostino and Brian McNamara in the balcony, the crowd yelled \AIDS\. Kinison laughed and joked about how \they find thirty to forty new diseases every year.. They should stop looking.\ He moved on to discuss sex education, something that \women get a lot of and that guys must do on their own instinct and reflex. A woman won't tell a man what she likes but she'll tell everyone else.\ Comedian Sam Kinison The Jerry Lewis Telethon was puzzling to him because it raised two hundred million dollars and. there 'is still no cure for muscular dystrophy.' Kinison never let the audience forget that he had been married twice. \How could he not do dr11gs after that?\ He is \lucky to be alive. You've seen married men in malls, pushing strollers, with looks on their faces like they envy the dead.\ After being marri(ld twice he felt qualified to be a 'tour guide in Hell.' After the picture he painted of women, it was surprising to think that he had praised commitment in the beginning of his show. His extremely high· pitched voice, whicb left my ears ringing and which was awfully difficult to understand at times, appropriately lent to the title of his tour-\Louder Than Hell.\ After he left the stage the first time and many people started filing out of Memorial Chapel, just as quickly as they had entered but more orderly, I, too, left. My ~ars had been ringing more than I cated to endure and I had heard enough of Sam Klnison. Organ Show at Proctor's By JASON GREEN Proctor's Theatre kicked off the first of this year's series of Theatre Organ Pops Shows last Sunday with the theatre's Organist-Artist-in-Residence .Allen Mills in a delightful. afternoon of musical favorites with \Goldie the theatre's Golub Mighty Wurlitzer Theatre Organ.

There are only three other such prestigious positions in the rest of the country. Since coming to Proctor's, Mills has directed and appeared in 32 Proctor's Productions. His most popular production each year is his Christmas Show, always a sen out and booked this year for three perfonnances. In addition to his work at Proctor's, Mills has appeared throughout the country in Dedicatory Recitals of new and re-built organs and with groups such as the Philadelphia Orchestra.

Talking to the audience after each song, giving a guided tour of the organ and explaining how it could play the drums, xylophone, glockenspiel, and even horses hooves, not to mention car horns, police sirens and every noise short of the mating whistle of sperm whales, Mills formed a relationship with the audience which kept the show's mood light and enjoyable.

CONCORDIENSJS, October 16, 1986 Page 13 THE ARTS Sam Kinison . . . Louder Than Hell ByCARATABACK A crewd, reminiscent in behavior of registration, Winter term 1985, gathered early Friday night in front of Memorial Chapel in anticipation of seats as close to Sam Kinison as they could possibly find. Seats near the front are always most desirable for they provide a better chance of being abused from the crowd, by the comedian (a masochistic American characteristic in itself) equally as much as they provide a good view. The crowd forced its way against unopen doors for at least a half an hour and finally it burst through the one solitary open door to scramble for the best pews. The enthusiasm refused to fade as it became obvious that the show would not begin at 8:00 as scheduled. A 'wave' started in the right hand balcony and circled the building many times after great effort to get coordinated. With backgroWld music of Genesis, two crowds of people, seated across from each other, began chanting \Tastes Great\ and \~ss Filling\ back and forth to big cheers from the remainder of the crowd. The \first gig\ on the 'Louder Than Hell' tour began with special guest Carl LeBeau, a balding comedian with a pony tail and a black and red leather vest with a pair of dice sewn on. He relied heavHy on visuals during his short routine as he used full command of the stage to act like a six foot fly and to reenact a humorous skit about being in a broken-down car, getting out and trying to thumb a ride, all to no avaiL His ch&ice of language reminded one of Sean Penn's Jeff Spicoli in the movie Fast Times at Ridgemont High, with his 'What's up, dude?' diction. Fifteen minutes and a new microphone later, out strutted Sam Kinison, the man everyone had been waiting for, the history teacher in Back to School'. Dressed in black sweatpants, beret and long leather coat he struck me as a combination of John Belushi, George Thorogood and Ozzy Osbourne. He began by saying that, ... sexuality is wierd\ and how he knows no women who are into 'the commitment thing', as if all men longed solely for commitment. He did say that he has a hard time mingling after his shows, - obviously so as he proceeded on with his 'advice to men in the audience, about the women they love,' talk of AIDs-he \doesn't grasp the gay movement.

The· crowd was probably one of the most diverse ever to attend a concert-it ranged in age from kindergarten students to grandparents. They all had one thing in common: a love for the Monkees.

Viewers of the first run in syndication make ~P the second generation. The third, and'lllost recent generation are those people who first became aware of the Monkees through MTV. the show opened with the Monkees coming onstage to a recording of their theme song; when the record began to skl.p, Peter got a giant sti~k of dynamite an<l blew up . the phonograph. This was only the beginning of an hour of nostalgic music and slapstick homor th~t typified the '6Bs TV show. OVerall, they played 20 of their biggest hits. \Goin' Down\ provided Mickey with an opportllDity to. do his Jame$ Brown unitation,. while {I Auntie GriZalda\ gave Peter his only chance to sing lead. \Daydream Believer\ introduced merely. as 7 A, proved that even in his forties Davy Jones can still melt the hearts of girls old .and yoUng. The da,dly melollic ''Shades of Gray\ allowed the three musicians to share lead vocals. \Then And Now\' the oniy n~w song in the set, as well as the oniy number perfonned without Davy, was greeted with cheers of recognition and enjoyment. \I'm A Bleiver\ closed the regular set. After a roUSin§ encore of \Listen to the Band' and \Pleasant Valley .Sunday'', Davy, Mic;key ai)d Peter left the stage arm-in-ann to the mUsic of the \Monkee's Theme\. Herman's Hermits, Gary Puckett, the Union Gap, and the Grass Roots all performed 20- minute sets of their classic material. Unfortunately, ·their .constant mentioning of the Monkees made their sets seem like glorified commercials. Overall, this was perhaps one of the best shows that has played. the area in a-long tinle. It took the audience back .to ''a time when girls liked boys and boys liked girlsaa (in the :words'of Davy Jones). The show also proved that '60s pop has a place in the world- of '80s rock. l

Overall, they played 20 of their biggest hits. \Goin' Down\ provided Mickey with an opporttmity to do his James Brown imitation, while \Auntie Grizalda\ gave Peter his only chance to sing lead. \Daydream Believer\ introduced merely as 7 A, proved that even in his forties Davy Jones can still melt the hearts of girls old and yoWlg. The dadly melodic \Shades of Gray\ allowed the three musician,s to share lead vocals. \Then .hld Now\' the only new song in t:be set, as well as the only nllll1...ber perfonned without Davy, ~as greeted with cheers of rec()goition and enjoyment. \I'm A Bleiver\ closed the regular ,set. After a rousing encore <()f ''Listen to the Band\ and \Ple~sant Valley Sunday\ Davy, Mi-ckey and Peter left the stage lll'lll-in-arm to the music of the \Monkee•s Theme\. Heriila.n •s Hermits, Gary Puckett, the Union Gap, and the Grass fuots all performed 20- minute sets of their classic material. UnfortWlately, their constant mentioning of the Monkees made their sets seem like glol'ified commercials. Overall~tJlis was perhaps one of the best sllows that has played the area in a ·long time. It took the audience back to \a time when girls liked boys and boys liked girlsaa (in the words of Davy Jo11es). The show also proved tltat '60s pop has a place in the Y\'~rld of '80s rock.

I i C.f)NCORDIENSJS, October 16, 1986 Athlete· of. the·week By DOUGLAS LLOYD Timely and plentiful are gootl adjectives to describe this week's winner when speaking of her scoring chara~teristics. Yes, senior Lillian Tyree bas proved both descriptions true, in being a major factor ·m the field hockey team 1 s success. This is why she is this week's \Athlete ·of the Week\. The field hockey team (7 -4) is coming off two. wins in which Lillian has netted five goals. A week ago today, Lillian helped. make Dutchman llistory by scoring an ovef:tlme goal against Williams Co]ege giving Union their first victory ever against ~the Ephmen in field hockey. Williams had been the number three ranked team in New EJ}glan.d, thus it was a fantastic upset for the . Ullicll:\l Tyree Dutchmen and a memorable goal for Lillian. This· overtime goal also ended a three game losing. streak. For :H(Jmecoming, Lillian decided to give the eager crowd an extra special treat by scoring all. ·Of Union's goals in ••• win by score of 7~-0 the 4.0 shutout. The big games, however, do·not stop there. At the end of September, Lillian notched the first of her overtime winning goals by sending one home at Wells. On the season, the 3'2\ forward has scored seven goals to tie her for first on the team's scoring list. Lillian, a Watennill, NY resident, has started for Uni()n throughout her four•year ·career. Lillian was chosen to the All-League field hockey team when a senior at Southampton and curre11tly majors in Computer Science and Math. Once again, congratulations to Lillian on .making the Union record books and for her timely and plentiful scoring this year for the Dutchmen. Union Liquidates Arsenal City By JEFF ALBR.ECHT After losing their frist two games of the seaS()n, a little doubt . arose concerning the effectiveness of Union's Men's Rugby ·Club. After last weekend, however, any doubt that may have arisen no longer exists. Union's first victory of the season was a 7.2-0 liquidation .of Arsenal City, a men's cJub from WatervUet. The astronomical score was created by · 14 · tries and eigbt conversions, including four tries by wing-forward Jodi Perkins. \We hit thelll hard early and for the rest of the game they were afraid to bit,~' explained Union co..captain Rob Sharp. \Oltr runners were a lot faster than they were. We just ran around them.\ Delano. Ho<1ker-kicker Dave Blee, who hit all eight of his conversion attempts, made his first one t() put the ruggers up, 10..0-still early in the game. After every Union sco~e, Arsenal City would kick off, Union wollld march the ball down the field and score again. Things were no different in this case, when wing . Jeff Zorn fought thrCJugb a crowd, and dove in the 1ry..zone to put Union up, 14-0. Zorn, running with his football style, ran head down the whole way into the try-zone. \All day he would run with his head down,. and when he saw a set of feet, · he'd cut,\ commented Perkins on Zorn's running. the halftime score at 34-0. Perkins, who ended the first half scoring, began the second half with a weakside run off of a .penalty play for four more, and a hat-trick. Delano hiked the score up to 42 after taking a pass from Dave Morrison in. Sheridan scored his second ()f the day when he fell on the ball in the try zone after Union's serum walked the ball over the line from about five meters out. Blee converted and the score was 48-0. Sheridan scored again after picking up a Steve Konlian grubby and outracing the defense down the field .for aaother try. Blee hit the conversion and the ruggers were·up, 540. After a 50 meter run by Delano, the ball was passed back to Perkins who ran in his fourth goal of the game. Blee · · · - Continued on page 18 C!tnnturltirnsis SPORTS Charlie Slotnlk Looking at S.p.orts Unlike professioaal football which needs the help of the high- tech industry to .effect the outcome of games by supplying instant· replays t() referees, professional baseball players are often able to change the outcome of their games by merely turning !their caps around. In the late i.llnings of a baseball game, when a team needs rwts, often referred to as a rally, the players in the dugout will turn tbeir caps to one side oftheir bead. When this is done the baseball cap transforms into a rally cap. By no means was this a creation of Abner Doubleday, nor did we impoit it fr(}m the Japanese as we d() our cars, stereos, and VCR'fl~ The origin of the rally cap istraced all the way back to the SJl~ing of 1985 during the college W()rld series in Omaha, NebrSlllta, the same Omaha that pmd11ced Wild Kingdom. At the College World Series, the University ()f Texas baseball. team turnEd their caps either around, o~ to the side in hopes of igniting 2' rally. And with the initiation of this new concept the rally cap was born. · Since that day wllen the rally cap was formally introduced to Americans on national television via ESPN, the rally cap has unde~g~ne several innovations. There are now many different r.alJy caps, used by various teams, at critical times during a game. There is the classic rally, turning one's cap to one side of the head. The reversible rally, turning one's ca!) completely inside out. The fdcl.ing rally, pushing the back of()ne's cap in, and then placing the cap on the top of the head. The duck rally, turning the bill of the cap up, and then placing a ball in between the insignia on the cap and the bill. And .finally, the Sahara rally placing a towel over the top of the cap, so that the player resembles an Egyptian Phat\oah. All of these different styles are used for the same purpose, to ignite a rally. Furthermore, there are certain guidelines to· the use of the rally cap. First, only exciting teams are allowed to don the magic hats. Cm.:rently, the New York Mets and H()uston Astros are the treams that have implemented them ·the most. Second, they are only to be worn in thd dugout while the team is at bat. They are not to be worn in the bullpen, and are primarily reserved for utility players or pitch~rs not in the game. Last Tuesday, in game five of the National League championship sel'ies between the New York Mets and the Houston Astros, the score was tied, 1-1. Both teams had won two games in the best of seven series, and the winner of this game would only need one· more victory to advance to the w:orld series. The Mets with only three hits all day put on their rally caps in the bottom of the loth, but still couldn't muster a run off the Astros. In the 11th, the Mets still hunting for an extra inning run, put on the duck version. The result-three men up, three men d<!wn. Then in the bott()m of the twelfth inning, the Mets sat in the dugout with their appropriate Sahara rally apparel, With Wally Backman second base and one out, the Astros walked Keith Hernandez to pitch to Gary Garter, who was. batting .046 in the championship series. Carter singled up the middle, and the Mets came one game closer to reaching their Oasis. Skeptics Beware! The scoring opened up in the first five minutes ·()£ the game. Union ~g Steve Delano got his first of two tries 011 the day by taking an Arsenal City kick and carrying it into the try-zo,ne. The conversion was missed and Union was up, 4-0, very early in the game. Sharp mentioned that not .only the \line b11t the serum as well was very successful in rwming with the ball. Perkins showed this in Union's second try of the game~ The wing forward got his first of four when he ran in_ !t pass from The next time Union got the ball, eigllth man Chris Sheridan, Sc()oped up a Perkins brubby ~~ kick along the ground) ~d ran it in. for his first ~areer try. Fullback Pat DiCierbo got into the action, after taking a pass from Sheridan on the very next play · . and ran it in for four more. Blee · again made the conversion. Unfortunately for Arsenal City, Zorn got the ball again and zig- zagged in and out of the defense for his sec4!nd try of the game. Again, Blee hit the conversion. NL Series Proves To Be A Thriller The first·half scoring ended after Perkins took a Zorn r· ass around the left band Side o the try-zone for his seeond, setting Women's Fi_eld Hockey defeated R P .I, by the score of 4·0. By MARK ZIMMERMAN The Mets beat the Astros Tuesday on a Gary Carter single in the 11th inning. It broke . a tremendous slwnp by Carter who was batting only .0~ at the time. The game was a very important one for both teams because it would break the tie at two games apiece going back to Houston. The Mets fell behind in the series after the first game on ,the exceptional pitching of Mike Scott. Scott recorded a record 14 .strikeouts against the National League's premier hitting team and beat Dwight Gooden by a 1- 0 count. It was a f~rly uneventful game hitting-wise as was Game Two in which Bob Ojeda won, 5-l. However, the tide of the series changed in game number three. Down 4--0 in the 6th inning, Gary Carter drove in a rWl on an error by ·shortstop, Craig Reynolds. With runners on first and second. Oartell Strawberry stepped to· the plate. Afte~ runnhig the count to 3o2, Stra\Wilerry took the next pitch deep Into the Met bullpen, tying the game. Yet, the game was only beginning to get exciting. Afte~ the Astros took a fairly secure one rwtlead into the ninth, Lemy Dykstra got up to the plate with Wally Backman on seC!ond base. Dykstra drove the third pitch over the right field wall for the win and a 2-1lead:in the series. Yet again, Houston came back with Mike Scott and tied up the series at two apiEc:e. In this gaJ.lle, Scott set the record for strikeouts in a playoff series. Then, the crucial game of the series was played after a one- day rain delay. The fifth game w~Isa pitching duel between the best of the new and the best of the ()id. Dwight Gooden faced Nolan Ryan. At the end of nine, the score was 1- 1. Houston had nine bits to only two by the Mets. Yet, one of those two hits was abome run to right field by Strawberry that just turned fair by in:ches. The game went int() the bottom of the twelfth behind masterfUl pitching by relievers Jesse Orosco and Charlie Kerfeld. However, the Astros blew the game with· two crucial mistakes. Wally Backman jwnped aboard on an error by third baseman, Denny Walling. After an attempted pickoff by Kerfield that went into right field, Baclanan stood on second. Hernandez was put on and up came Gary Carter. Carter's series average stood at .048 and he was 0 for 15. But, Carter proved his worth to the Mets. On the second pitch he drove the ball up the middle for a hit and the victory. Thetwo teams will now travel back to Houston for the sixth and seventh games. Should the Mets clinch the National League, it would mark the first time since 1973 that they have appeared in the World Series When they 'ost to Oakland in seven games. SUPPORT UNION SPORTS ·- - -

After the opening kickoff, Union rambled for 63 yards and the first touchdown of the game. On his first possession Shepherd collected 51 of the total yards and the march was capped by sophomore fullback Steve Hayes when he crossed into the end zone on a six yard run. Freshman Bob Anderson then booted his 18th PAT of the season and his first of five for the game. On their third possession of the game, the Dutchmen brought the score to 14-0. Shepherd capped the 75 yard drive that took five minutes and 16 plays, with a seven yai\d run. With the end of the half approaching, coach Bagnoli replaced starting quarterback Tim Valachovic with freshman quarterback Jim Poirier of Schenectady. With 7:57 left in the half, Poirier ran arotmd the left end bringing the score ()f the game to 21-0.

The Dutchmen face Williams in Williamstown this Saturday. By RICH GOLDMAN T}Je Dutchmen football team wasn't the only team to beat RPI last weekend. Although Union did not play their best game of the season, they came out ahead 2-o. The Dutchmen came out flat and the gaine went back and forth. Union's defense kept R. P .I. off the board. Almost halfway through the first half, R. P .I. had a goal disallowed on an offisdes call. The game remained scoreless until 4:40 left in the half. Jeff Barker scored his first goal of the year on a reboWld that hit the post on a shot by Bob Crandall. Crandall headed the ball on a corner kick and Barker\ was there for the rebound. In the second half,. Union scored seven minutes into the half on a goal by Steve Hartman. ThiS goal was on a penalty kick that was awarded to Union because an R.P.I. player committed a tripping foul in the penalty area. Union played better in the second half and held on. to beat the always troublesome Engineers who had beaten Union oil the previous two homecomings. A little later after the Union goa~ Dave Tweksbmy of Union and Dave Wright of .R.P.I. were ejected from the game. Wright pushed Tewksbury who then swung-at Wright. No fight took place but both players were ejected. It was Wright's second major offense of the game .. Both players are also not allowed to participate in their next game so Tewksbury is not allowed to play against Siena on Wednesd~y the fifteenth. Goalie Jon LaDuke tallied his fow1h shutout of the year while Union raised its record to 7.;1·1 and R.P.I. fell to 4-6-1. Even with the win, Union lost a ranking in both the national and NYS poll.

On his first possession Shepherd collected 51 of the total yards and the march was capped by sophomore fullback Steve Hayes when he crossed into the end zone on a six yard run. Freshman Bob Anderson then booted his 18th PAT of the season and his first of five for the game. On their third possession of the game, the Dutchmen brought the score to 14-0. Shepherd capped the 75 yard drive that took five minutes and 16 plays, with a seven yard run. With the end of the half approaching, coach Bagnoli replaced starting quarterback Tim V alachovic with freshman quarterback Jim Poirier of Schenectady. With 7:57 left in the half, Poirier ran around the left end bringing the score of the game to 21~. The next time Union touched the ball they breezed on a 51 yard march capped by Palumbo on a three yard run making it 28-0. As the third quarter rolled around Union began to replace their starters with second and third string players. Union then closed out its scoring on another run by Bryan Palumbo when he crashed into the end zone on a one yard run. With two seconds left, R.P .I. put the final points of the game on the board when quarterback Tom Wood threw a nine yard pass to his receiver in the end zone. R.P.l. 's other points came on a 55 yard breakaway run by Captain Ryan Fishcer. Defensively for Union, senior All-American defensive back Alex Rita had another fine day with four tackles and three punt returns for 39 yards. Craig Aron collected five assists and one of the team's six sacks, while defensive backs Dale Bajcer and Tim McLees had their second interceptions of the season. The Dutchmen face Williams in Williamstown this Saturday. . . . ; . Soccer Wins 2-0 By RICH GOLDMAN The Dutchmen football team wasn't the only team to beat RPI last weekend. Although Union did not play their best game of the season, they came out ahead 2-0. The Dutchmen came out flat and the game went back and forth. Union's defense kept R.P.I. off the board. Almost halfway through the first half, R.P.I. had a goal disallowed on an offisdes call. The game remained scoreless W1til 4:40 left in the half. Jeff Barker scored his first goal of the year on a rebound that hit the post on a shot by Bob Crandall. Crandall headed the ball on a corner kick and Barker was there for the rebound. In the second half, Union scored seven minutes into the half on a goal by Steve ~artman. This goal was on a penalty kick that was awarded to Union because an R.P.I. player committed a tripping foul in the penalty area. Union played better in the second half and held on to beat the always troublesome Engineers who had beaten Union on the previous two homecomings. A little later after the Union goal, Dave Tweksbury of Union and Dave Wright of R.P.I. were ejected from the game. Wright pllShed Tewksbury who then swung at Wright. No fight took place but both players were ejected. It was Wright's second major offense of the game. Both players are also not allowed to participate in their next game so Tewksbury is not allowed to play against Siena on Wednesday the fifteenth. Goalie Jon LaDuke tallied his fourth shutout of the year while Union raised its record to 7-1-1 and R.P.I. fell to 4-6-1. Even with the win, Union lost a ranking in both the national and NYS poll. ....... c '· - ·'..!i{. ·.:-:;,~~.:,>\ :. <·.:-,·:.c..' ·<<iN'i.}}!\j;o'(K\J'ii<d ;'M; ~,:·,. :: :.',~b~t~~ j,:_:;~,1' .

REED WH1DpEN . The Soard of Trustees met October 9 and lO to discuss, among othe,- things, divestment in South Mrica. The trustees approved a new social policy that was the product of a committee formed last year~ This committee was formed when there was much controversy over apartheid in South Africa. The cormnittee's purpase was to review Union's social policy on investments in companies in South Africa. At a future time the committee was to present any findings .mfl.a .. proposal. They did so in June of 1986. The committee last year had three choices for its proposal. They could recommend no change in. the policy, partial · divestment, or complete divestment in the companies. Complete divestment could go either one of two ways- complete divestment at one t~e or over a period of time. Partial divestment would be based on the Sullivan Principles. The Sullivan Principles are basic guidelilles for the companies in South Africa to insure fair labor practices. The committee, at that time last year, was Contiqued on page 2 Josh Waldman, sophomore representative, inquired as to why a new liberal learning program was needed at all. Steve Moss, president of the student forum and a member of the Subcouncil on . the Curriculum that prepared the proposal, e:q>lained that \the current liberal learning system was created ten years ago and those standards no longer apply.\ Moss gave as an example how all history courses now give a liberal learning \D\ credit, althoUgh they may only focus on a narrow tilne period and therefore do not give the originally intended broad-based education. Democrats Recr..,it Students Moss also. cited the \A\ credit as another area for chwe. The current system allows a choice of three courses from the areas of fine arts and literature, two from one department and· one from the other. That can allow students to avoid writing courses and therefore does not meet initial intentions. OVerall, Moss said, the. major problell\ with the present system is that \the original goals are no longer being adhered to.\ Geri Mackey, junior representative, agreed that ''some revisions should be made to disallow dodging\ but that the current proposal is ·~too specific.\ At this point it requires eleven courses in specific departments, four of which must be \linked and four more outside of the student's major (for specifics, : see box on p. 3 }.

It is likely that there Will be terminals on Stu,dents Play Vital Role In Union Academic, Social Policies By DEBRA B. HONIG The academic and social affairs at Union could not successfully exist without a type of fonnal backing, namely that of student committees. Often the goals and purposes of . these committees are not well . understood. Here they are · highlighted. With a clear-cut purpose, the Academic Affairs Council exists to designate and examine academic policies. The 16 members of the Academic Affairs Cotmcil, whkh includes Dr. Thomas D' Andr~a and Dean William Daniels, tackle issues brought up at Student Forum meetings. According to Gavin Morton, the Student Forum representative of the Academic Affairs Council, topics of discussion include the Liberal Learning Policy, Gel Time, academic honesty, the new faculty allocation, and the subcouncil on writing. Students on this committee have one-quarter of the vote, and according to Gavin, \It's good that we have students on the committee, because the professors and administrators are not the ones who take the courses.\ Even though the decision of the committee is not the final word, the conunittee's opinions and presentations have definite impact. In an effort to make life in general at Union all he more comfortable, the Student Affairs Council is willing to .. analyze issues concerning living conditions and policies on the use of facilities. According to Kim Quirk from the Student Affairs Council, topics range from the noise level in dormitories to the lack of study space. Kim said, \We bear t~e problems, and we find tbe people who should fix those problems!\ In ot;her words, the purpose of the Student Affairs COuncil is ooth to air opinions, and to make the administration aware of problems. An unusual committee, for the benefit of the student according to member Elissa Cohen, is the Standing of Students SubcoWlcil. Activity in this subcouncil does not start lllltil there is official record l)f a student's academic danger, in other words,. obtaining lower than the minimum index of 2.0 in all courses. According to Union's Academic Register, ''An exceptionally weak record in a single term or a failure~ to improve after warning may result · in suspension or dismissal from the college.'' This is when the Standing of Students Subcouncil would step in. The Subcouncil would · examine the student''B record, and would determine what actions the college should take. Elissa said, \There are extenuating circumstances, and not studying or not putting in the time is not always the reason for . academic problems.\ The Finance Committee, with Chairman Steve Lipsky, allocates and monitors the student activity fund. Steve explained that the committee determines a club's budget by examining its past activities and the role it plays on campus. In fact, the committee keeps tabs on how valid the budget request is by weekly meetings with the club leaders. {See 1986- 87 Club Bucigets below right.) Only by peeping one's head out the window at a fraternity party is Dne likely to . see examples of non-alcohol related activities Dn campus, organized on behalf of the Social .Alternatives CoJI)Ii:llttee (SAC). . Several major events of this year will include an MDA Superdance and a dinner- theatre nigbt for charity. SAC's latest contrib.ution to the social atmosphere was Casino Night in West College, in which the rnoney corning out of the students' pockets went toward the ·American Cancer Society. As one of the most recent additions as a committee, the SAC welcomes enthusiastic ·people and new ideas so that it can expand its program. Presently joining Chairman John Zuk are some 15 other students. According to Director of Student Activities Lorraine Marra, the Student Activities · Committee came int9' play approximately two years ago, . when the drinking age was changed from 18 to 21. Although many students feel that . this change has not put a damper on dr.i,nking on campus, the Social Alternatives Committee tends to promote its non~alcohol related activities because of the variety they provide in Union's social life. The Social Conunittee is also concerned with student social life, however it plots and plans for long-lasting social options, such. as the Pub II, Open Mike Night and WinterFest. According to Mrs. Marra, \Since winter seems to be a very dull time, many of the students I ask have no place to go.\ The Social Committee is working to rectify this s.ituation. These are just a few of the committees at Union that keep ties between the students and the policies. According to Mrs. Marra, ''Our aim on campus is to help you do what you really want to do.\ Winter Term Preregistration The procedures for winter preregistration will be the same as those used for last fall term. Preregistration will occur in Silliman Hall and each student has been assigned a specific time to preregister. Preregistration materials {the \Preregistration Course Request Form\ and a list of courses) will be available at the .Registrar's Office beginning Friday Oct. 24. Students should review the course listing, consult with their advisers,. and select the courses they wish. It would be advisable for students to have a fourth and fifth choice in mind in case one of their first three choices· becomes unavailable. TO PREREGISTER EVERY STUDENT WILL BE REQtiiRED TO HAVE THEIR ADVISER SIGN THEIR PRE REG I STRATI ON FORM. IF THEIR ADVISER IS UNAVAILABLE, A STUDENT SHOULD CONSULT WITH THE HEAD OF THEIR ADVISER'S DEPARTMENT. Some courses are available only with the permission of the department. These arc referred to as \list\ courses and arc indicated on the course listing by an ast~risk. Lists for these co •rses will be posted by the department5 on Wed. Oct. 29. Students should sign these lists to indica1e an interest and then should return to the departments on Fri. Oct. 31 to find ou.t whether or not they have been admitted. Those admitted to a list course must get a reservation card from the department. NO ONE WILL BE ALLOWED TO PREREGISTER FOR A '\LIS.T\ COURSE W.ITHOUT SUCH A CARD. THESE ARE THE ONLY COURSES THAT REQUIRE SUCH CARDS. Preregistration tor an independent study or research will require written permission of the supervising faculty member. The date and time for each student's appointment is printed on the label affixed to the \Preregistration Course Request Form.\ Students may not preregister prior to their assigned time. Preregistration will conclude on Fri. Nov. 7. Additional cour$e changes may next be made during the Drop/ Add period at the start of the winter term. Students will be admitted to Silliman Hall at the time printed on thei.r \Preregistration Course Request Form\ (this form, filled out AND SIGNED BY THEIR ADVISER, must be brought to preregistration). Once inside they should verify that the courses they desire are not closed. If one or more courses are closed, they should select new ones and correct their preregistration form. Then, they should see a staff member who Will preregister them. Students who do not plan to return to Union for the winter term, except graduating seniors, must give notice of their plans to the Dean of Students. Potential De.cember and March graduates should inform the Office of the Registrar of their plan'> to finish their studies at the end of the .fall or winter terms. eve(y .floor ofthe library as well. as several at the present location of the c~Wd catalogue. Ultimately, Seemann explained, circulation artd other segments of the library will be a11tomated. It is hoped that eventually students and facUlty will be able to access the • catalogue from terminals · in dol'lll rooms or offices. The Library Automation Committee has been working diligently for several years on this . project but has not yet selected the system that will be used. According to Seemann, \The del~y comes because no one system is exceptional, and becallSe.the needs of the College and the sUpport of the calllpus · computer .center have to be · taken into account.\ The card · ,catalogne will go . On line sometime during j;he ·1987-88 scho()l year. Other · colleg.es and universities have similar computer-based systems. Marty medium-sized academic libraries such as Union's are currently developing plans for the implementation of such a system. Commented Seemann, \I don't tbink that we're particularly · behind · as compared. to other schools of our size.\ The .serials Information System (SINS), which was a pilot project to educate the campus about what it was like · using computer .terminaJ.s to ,ind journals and periodicals; has been a success, accqrding to · Seemann. Terminals are · located near the present card catalogue and receive much use from the campus cormnunity. In -conchtsion, Seemann stated, ~·we are very enthusiastic about our move tow-ards library automation . The new system. will make a . great deal of difference to the ' c~,Unpus and wijl be both fun and . efficient to use.\ Trustees To Release Divestmel)t Decision Next Term Continued from page 1 supposed to be .leaning in .favor of tile partial divestment choice · based on the · Sullivan Principles. Their dilemma was over social consciousness and the maximtim funding by the companies of Union COllege. With ,all this in mind, the committee presented its · proposal to the Board of TrllStees, which they approved at their last meeting. The policy essentially states the following: (1) After much and careful discussion, Union Will divest its stock in those companies reluctant to· adhere to the Sullivan Principles or th()Se that sell government . goods used in the inforcenient of apartheid. · (2) In those companies that Union holds stock, the college will urge them to work against. apartheid or withdraw from South Africa.· (3) Union decided against complete divestment believing that it ·would not bring about any real change in South Africa, it might be in danger of losing funds from the companies, and for Union, it would be an unsuitable .political tactic .. From which companies Union chooses to divest their stock-if any- is unknown. A list of companies will be examined and by January those companies not adhering to the Sullivan Principles will be considered for divestment. Until January the committee will critically examine the actions of companies in South Africa to see which route they take-supporting apartheid or supporting the Sullivan · Prineiples. If Union does divest in January remains to be seen. 1']

Here they are highlighted. problems, and we find tbe people who should fix those problems!\ In other words, the purpose of the Student Affairs Council is both to air opinions, and to make the administration aware of problems. An unusual committee, for the benefit @f the student according to member Elissa Cohen, is the Staro.ding of Students Subcouncil. Activity in this subcouncil does not start until there is official record of a student's academic danger, in other words, obtaining lower than the minimum index of 2.0 in all courses. According to Union's Academic Register, \An exceptionally weak record in a single term or a failure to improve after warning may result in suspension or dismissal from the college.\ This is when the Standing of Students Subcouncil would step in. The Su.bcouncil would examine the student''S record, and would determine what actions the college should take. Elissa said, \There are extenuating circumstances, and not studying or not putting in the time is not always the reason for academic problems.'' on behalf of the Social Alternatives CoJ).1IIlittee (SAC). Several major events of this year will include an MDA Superdance and a dinner- theatre night for charity. SAC's latest contribution to the social atmosphere was Casino Night in West College, in which the money coming out of the students' pockets went toward the American Cancer Society. With a clear-cut purpose, the Academic Affairs Council exists to designate and examine academic policies. The 16 members of the Academic Affairs Council, whkt. includes Dr. Thomas D'Andrea and Dean William Daniels, tackle issues brought up at Student Forum meetings. According to Gavin Morton, the Student Forum representative of the Academic Affairs Council, topics of discussion include the Liberal Learning Policy, Gel Time, academic honesty, the new faculty allocation, and the subcouncil on writing. Students on this conunittee have one-quarter of the vote, and according to Gavin, \It's good that we have students on the committee, because the professors and administrators are not the ones who take the courses.\ Even though the decision of the committee is not the final word, the committee's opinions and presentations have definite impact. In an effort to make life in general at Union all he more comfortable, the Student Affairs Council is willing to analyze issues concerning living conditions and policies on the use of facilities. According to Kim Quirk from the Student Affairs Council, topics range from the noise level in dormitories to the lack of study space. Kim said, \We hear the The Finance Committee, with Chairman Steve Lipsky, allocates and monitors the student activity fund. Steve explained that the committee determines a club's budget by examining its past activities and the role it plays on campus. In fact, the committee keeps tabs on how valid the budget request is by weekly meetings with the club leaders. (See 1986- 87 Club Budgets below right.) Only by peeping one's head out the window at a fraternity party is one likely to see examples of non-alcohol related activities on campus, organized As one of the most recent additions as a committee, the SAC welcomes enthusiastic people and new ideas so that it can expand its pt·ogram. Presently joining Chairman John Zuk are some 15 other students. According to Director of Student Activities Lorraine Marra, the Student Activities Committee came into play approximately two years ago, when the drinking age was changed from 18 to 21. Although many students feel that this change has not put a damper on drinking on campus, the Social Alternatives Committee tends to promote its non-alcohol related activities because of the variety they provide in Union's social life. The Social Committee is also concerned with student social life, however it plots and plans for long-lasting social options, such as the Pub II, Open Mike Night and WinterFest. According to Mrs. Marra, \Since winter seems to be a very dull time, many of the students I ask have no place to go.\ The Social Committee is working to rectify this situation. These are just a few of the committees at Union that keep ties between the students and the policies. According to Mrs. Marra, \Our aim on campus is to help you do what you really want to do.\ Winter Term Preregistration The procedures for winter preregistration will be the same as those used for last fall term. Preregistration will occur in Silliman Hall and each student has been assigned a specific time to preregister. Preregistration materials (the \Preregistration Course Request Form\ and a list of courses) will be available at the Registrar's Office beginning Friday Oct. 24. Students should review the course listing, consult with their advisers, and select the courses they wish. It would be advisable for students to have a fourth and fifth choice in mind in case one of their first three choices· becomes unavailable. TO PREREGISTER EVERY STUDENT WILL BE REQUIRED TO HAVE THEIR ADVISER SIGN THEIR PREREGISTRATION FORM. IF THEIR ADVISER IS UNAVAILABLE, A STUDENT SHOULD CONSULT WITH THE HEAD OF THEIR ADVISER'S DEPARTMENT. some courses are available only with the permission of the department. These are referred to as \I ist\ courses and ar-= indica ted on the course I isting by an astP.r isk. Lists for these co •rses will be posted by the department~ on Wed. Oct. 29. Students should sign these lists to indicate an interest and then should return to the departments on Fri. Oct. 31 to find out whether or not they have been admitted. Those admitted to a list course must get a reservatign card from the department. NO ONE WILL BE ALLOWED TO PREREGISTER FOR A \'LIST\ COURSE WITHOUT SUCH A CARD. THESE ARE THE ONLY COURSES THAT REQUIRE SUCH CARDS. Preregistration for an independent study or research will require written permission of the supervising faculty member. The date and time for each student's appointment is printed on the label affixed to the \Preregistration Course Request Form.'' Students may not preregister prior to their assigned time Preregistration will cor:~clude on Fri. Nov. 7. Additional course changes may next be made during the Drop/ Add period at the start of the winter term. Students will be admitted to Silliman Hall at the time printed on their \Preregistration Course Request Form\ (this form, filled out AND SIGNED BY THEIR ADVISER, must be brought to preregistration). Once inside they should verify that the courses theydesire are not closed. If one or more courses are closed, they should select new ones and correct their preregistration form. Then, they should see a staff rnember who will preregister them. Students who do not plan to return to Union for the winter term, except graduating seniors, must give notice of their plans to tlile Dean of Students. Potential December and March graduates should inform the Office of the Registrar of their plans to finish their studies at the end of the fa II or winter terms. every floor of the library as well as several at the present location of the card catalogue. Ultimately, Seemann explained, circulation and other segments of the library will be automated. It is hoped that eventually students and faculty wiU be able to access the catalogue from terminals in dorm rooms or offices. The Library Automation c~~ttee has been working dHigently for several years on this project but has not yet selected the system that will be used. According to Seemann, \The delay comes because no one system is exceptional, and because the needs of the College and the support of the campus computer center have to be taken into account.\ The card catalogue will go on line sometime during the 1987-88 school year. Other colleges and universities have similar computer-based systems. Many medium-sized academic libraries such as Union's are currently developing plans for the implementation of such a system. Commented Seemann, \I don't think that we're particularly behind as compared to other schools of our size.\ The Serials Information System (SINS)., which· was a pilot project to educate the campus about what it was like using computer . terminals to find journals and periodicals, has been a success, according to Seemann. Terminals are located near the present card catalogue and receive much use from the campus community. In conclusion, Seemann stated, \We are very enthusiastic about our move towards Hbrary automation. The new system will make a great deal of difference to the campus and will be both fun and efficient to use.'' Trustees To Release Divestment Decision Next Term Continued from page 1 supposed to be leaning in favor of the partial divestment choice based on the Sullivan Principles. Their dilemma was over social consciousness and the maximu'm funding by the companies of Union College. apartheid or withdraw from South Africa. (3) Union decided against complete divestment believing that it would not bring about any real change in South Africa, it might be in danger of losing funds from the companies, and for Union, it would be an unsuitable political tactic. With -all this in mind, the committee presented its proposal to the Board of Trustees, which they approved at their last meeting. From which companies Union chooses to divest their stock-if any- is unknown. A list of companies will be examined and by January those companies not adhering to the Sullivan Principles will be considered for divestment. Until January the committee will critically examine the actions of companies in South Africa to see which route they take-supporting apartheid or supporting the Sullivan Principles. If Union does divest in Jan nary remains to be seen. The policy essentially states the following: (1) After much and careful discussion, Union will divest its stock in those companies reluctant to adhere to the Sullivan Principles or those that sell government goods used in the inforcement of apartheid. (2) In those companies that Union holds stock, the college will urge them to work against - Finance Committee Budget f PLEASE N!~~?~~~~~~ of~:~&:i!:;:!~ear a total of ; $43(),69$ In requesis were made for $2Mt.od00.

Scott Elkind has used the position ·of general manager to encourage actions pursuant to his personal interests as opwsed to the best interests of WRUC. Elkind refute$ the allegations as follows: ''The executive board .agreed at the September tO meeting not to have a meeting the folloWing week because the station would not be on the air, as new disc jockeys would be in training.

In ·general, Elkind contendS that the allegations in the petition \are weak and trumped up\ and tha~ the petition itself was initiated \behind my back by people I should have been able to trust.\ Morgan, however, feels the petition was necessary because \It was the consensus of the other members of the executive board that Elkind can not be worked with and should be removed.\ Morgan's view is shared by Tatge, who stated that \He (Elkind) was doing the station more harm than good~\ Srdonavic feels that \His lack of presence at meetings and the station has hindered the progression of the executive board.\ · Elkind answers the allegations of low visibility on his part by stating that ''Most of my job in running the station iS done peripherally, and I have not missed an executive meeting until now\ (due to the two week inactive period).

Gavin Morton added that if the AAC is not ·. ready bY that date, they will · request that the vote be delayed. Morton also reminds students that further comments may still be made through contacting any member .of the AAC. The impetus for change, according to Dr. Willard Roth, Associate Dea.n of Undergraduate Studies, ~arne from several sources. Dean Roth accounted for tbe transformation of the siX-year program into the seven-year with the input that the former . program received from its students as well as from the Union faculty. Furthennore, the dropout rate from the program of 20 PE!rcent (one out of five) the past two years brought only further support for a change in the program. Wilen asked if there was any additional pressure from Albany Medical College to lengthen the program, he commented that there was no pressure from .them. In fact, he added, when he originally proposed the program between Union and Albany Medical College approximately 10 years ago, it was to be a seven-year program; it was Albany Medicalthatthoughtit would be too unique and,· hence, would not be competitive with other colleges; Union complied. Nearly a decade later, Union's seven-year program is back and is still just as unique; it is the attitude towards the seven-year program that is different. In the past, the six-year medical program often received criticism from the faculty and student body as well as from the six-year meds themselves as being 'unreasonable' and 'detrimental to the students'. Commented a former six-year medical student, \It is detrimental to the student; there are too many pressures from the faculty and the parents. Once you have the acceptance letter, it's hard to let go of it, so you keep pushing yourself academically and in order to succeed you have to lock yourself away, leading to the biggest problem with the six-year program; they (the six-'year medical students) don't contribute to the college. Seven is definitely better than . six.\ Some of the major additions to 'the new medical program, besides the change from a six- year to a seven-year program, are the required thesis that each student will have to write the winter and spring terms of their junior year, no summer session before their sophomore year, and more electives that will allow for a possible term abroad during the school year as well as provide more depth in the seven-year med•s liberal arts major. Said Dean Roth, \Under the fotmer program, we felt that students were not achieving the goal of a liberal arts education at Union. It was academically undesirable to crowd so many science cour- ses; students were able to memorize but not learn.\ With · this, the 20 freshman . seven- year medical students can concentrate on their major with more courses as well as a two- term thesis while taking their medical scbooJ requirements. When asked if there was a chance that the seven-year program would not be competitive with RPI's six-year program, Dean Roth commented that there has been already overwhehning response to the program by prospective students. And concerning those who have already chosen Union's seven-year program (in theclasso£1990) over.RPI's six- • 'year have done so because 'they prefer to have a liberal arts education and environment where they can join extra- curricular activities and college sports. This seems to agree with seven-year med Andi Goldberg, '90. \The program allows me to find time for more extra- curricular activities, like intramural volleyball, as wen- as manipulate a term· abroad into my program.\ Taj Mulukeutla, '90, added that the seven-year program attracted her because it is unlike most medical programs nationwide. She, like most stuaents,feelsthat two years are not enough in college. Said Taj, \For me it wasn't the time factor, but the guaranteed place in medical school.\ The nationwide trend for medical programs seems to be moving towards lengthening the programs and, according to Dean Roth, to even reduce the number of these programs nationwide. Union College (in conjunction with Albany Medical College) has seemed to catch this rising sentiment towards a 'fuller' education; hopefully, according to Ms. Ann K. Fleming, Associate Dean of Admissions, this will attract more illterested students m the \rather unique and satisfying\ medical program. Commented Dean Roth, \My personal opinion is that this is one of the finest programs there is; students are able to get a full degree and achieve adequate intellectual development.\ All upperclassmen interested in part-time internships in the New York State Legislature through P .s. 76-78 in the Winter and Spring Terms are invited to an informational meeting.

Seven is definitel:y better than six.\ Some of the major additions to' the new medical program, besides the chang~ from a six- year to a seven-year program, are the required thesis that each student willllave to write the winter and spring terms of their junior year~ no summer session before their sophomore ye~r. and more electives that will allow for a possible term abroad during the school year as well as provide more depth in the seven-year med's liberal arts major. Said Dean Roth, \Under the former program, we felt that students werenot achieving the goa~I of a liberal arts education at Union. It was academically undesirable to crowd so maay science cour· ses; students were able to memorize but not learn.\ With this, the 20 freshman seven- year medical students can concentrate on their major with more courses as well as a two- term thesis while taking their medical school requirements. When asked if there was a chan<!e that the seven-year program would not be competitive with RPI's six-year program, Dean Roth commented that there has been already overwhelming response to the program by prospective students. And concerning those who have already chosen Union's seven-year program (in the class of 1990) over RPI's six- year have done so because 'they prefer to have a liberal arts education and environment where they can join extra- curricular activities and college sports. This seems to agree with seven-year med Andi Goldberg, '90. \The program allows me to find time for more extra- curricular activities, like intramural volleyball, as wen- as manipulate a term abroad into my program.\ Taj Mulukeutla, '90, added that the seven-year program attracted her because it is unlike most medical programs nationwide. She, like most stucfents,feels that two years are not enougn in college. Said Taj, \For me it wasn •t the time factor, but the guaranteed place in medical school.\ The nationwide trend for medical programs seems to be moving towards lengthening the programs and, according to Dean Roth, to even reduce the number of these programs nationwide. Union College (in conjunction with Albany Medical College) has seemed to catch this rising sentiment towards a 'fuller' education; hopefully, according to Ms. Ann K. Fleming, Associate Dean of Admissions, this will attract more interested students :n the \rather unique and satisfying\ medical program. Commented Dean Roth, \My personal opinion is that this is one of the finest programs there is; students are able to get a full degree and achieve adequate intellectual development.\ All upperclassmen interested in part-time internships in the New York State Legislature through P .s. 76-78 in the Winter and Spring Terms are invited to an informational meeting.

,. I CONCORDIENSIS~ Oct(Jber 23, 1986 PageS FEATURES The People's Court· of Appeals Talk of the Town The · Conc-erdy recently asked: ByPAULSCHOP Last week, M. Herman Davis'l! «;!reatlve television series was preempted by the baseball .playoffs. This week, however, he is back with a new show aimed at the btttgeonjng syndication market. The shllw is a combination of .saturday Night Live and The People's Court. The show opened as the People's Court traditionally does, with an introduction of the plaintiff, who in this case was an attractive blonde named 'Bambi Jean Baker:, and the plaintiff, pathological liar Tommy Flanagan. · Mr. Flanagan ha:; been acc\!Sed ()f harboring a vici()u$ dog whom Miss Baker has alleged attacked ber witho11t · provocation. \Miss Baker, please begin your case,\ said Judge Wopner •. \0 judge,\ said Bambi, breathlessly. \Two weeks ago/' sai~ Bambi in the same tone, ''I was sitting home alone. It was a hot, sultry night, the air was so wet and heavy that everyth~g I had on was clinging tightly to my body. Even after I slipped into my nightgown, I still had this feeling.\ ''That's when I knew that I pad to get out of that house. Even though it was late, I couldn't sleep. So I put on my robe and I .stepped out on rny potch, hoping desperately to catch a breeze. I remember seeingafullmoon through some thick fog. l also remember hearing a long, low, gutteral moan. It was a deep growling sound. At first I thought that .it was .one of my neighbors trying to ex:cite me. Then I turned around and I saw this huge set of teeth glistening in the moonlight. I couldn't see anything else because of the fog and the darkness, but I knew that they belonged to some animal.\ \The nex:t thing I knew, someone had knocked me doVIll. I could feel his hot breath .on m)' neck as he ripped my nightgoWll off with his powerful jaws. I managed to turn aroWld arid; saw that it was Buttercup, Nr. Flanagan's Doberman, who was attacking me. I've always been afraid of him. Well. I Are you inte1·ested' in learning how to meditate? Meditation helps wph a II the stress of mid- . terms, senior theses\ personal relationships\ etc ... ; If you're curious, just drop by and get a quick lesson. If you're already practicing, come and· joi.n the group. Thursday at 4:30 In Milano Lounge Meditation Study Group fought him off with my electric leaf blower, and I managed t9 get inside; lock the door, and clean mY wotmds.\ ''Do you have any evidence, Miss Baker?\ asked the Judge. ''Yes, I do.'' She then produced a badly shredded black lace teddy and a matching ~eethrough robe. \Do you see what that animal did to me.\ She alsq produc'ed a hospital bill for the treatment of her dog bites and pictures of her scars. \Mr. Flanagan, what do you ]).ave to say?\ . \Well .first of all, Judge, this woman .is lying. I don't even own a dog. AnY-way, Buttercup isn'tevena Doberman. He's the siZe of a cat. Yeah, tluit's the · ,ticket, he's a cat, my wife, Morgan Fairchild'$ ~at.\ \Judge said Bambi, \he's lying.\ ''Miss Biker, please do not interrupt. Rusty, bring in the dog.'' A few seconds. later, Rusty brought the biggest Doberman in captivity i,nto the. courtroom. When he broaght the dog to the defe11dant, it was .obvious from the dog's response that he was the c;i()g's owner. . \This dog seems to know you, Mr. Flanagan,'' said the Judge. \It's because of the liver in my pocket,\ said Flanagan. \You have liver in yotu;' ·pocket. Why?\ \I I was planning to donate it. Yeah, that's the ticket, I was going to donate it for an organ transplant.\ . \You can't transplant that kind of liver.\ . ·\Well I was going tc donate it to, to starving kids. Yeah, I was going to feed poor, hungry, homeless orphans with it.\ \Well anyway, that dog was lying when he said he knew me. I'll prove my credibility. I have three c}laracter witnesses. I would like to }lave Finocchio, Nixon, and Spiro Agnew testify as to my honesty and integrity.\ \Mr. Flanagan, you can't have character witnesses in this court. Anyway, I'm curous, how do you know Nixon.\ ''I worked for him. Yeah, Nixon and Agnew in '72. That was the ticket.\ \What did you do for him?\ ''l, I sold his friend, G. Gordon. Liddy, some electrical tape. The stuff he used at the . Watergate.\ \1 can believe that. But I do not believe that you know Agnew.'' \Why?\ \Because nob()dy's heard from him in 13 years•\ After a brief commercial break, the Judge re11dered hiS verdict. He sided with the plaintiff. He als() rendered this decision. ,., Mr. Flanagan, in my opinion, you have tried to deceive this court with your continuous barrage llf lies.

Although the club was officially started last year with the ·writing of the constitution, it is this year that activities are being organized. The club does not operate only for those fluent or even somewhat proficient in the Spanish language, but for anyone interested in any aspect of Spanish or Latin .American culture, language, or politics. The first few ·meetings drew few interested stadents, but by officer elections attendance and interest increased. Four officers were elected and the year's bud~et proposal was submitted immediately. With the help of academic advisor Professor Qualtere, and the newest member of the Spanish department, Professor Moyano, ideas for activities and events began to flow. El Circulo Espanol has a variety of social and intellectual activities planned for the 1986-a7 academic year. For example, various foreign films with English subtitles for those unable to wtderstand Spanish, writing and acting out a Spanish skit to preview on Parents' Weekend, videos as well as a guest lecturer from The Mary Knoll Fathers concerning topics such as the conflict in El Salvador, oppression in Mexico, Bolivia, Columbia, and Paraguay, and eve11 graphic visual video tours .()£ several Latin American countries. Also on the agenda will be combined activities, such as fund raisers, with other clubs. Depending on the budget, a trip to a Spanish theater·in N.Y.C. might become a reality, if not for this year, for next. AU events are open to interested people. A lot of hard work has gone into the planning and reorganization of El Cil'culo Espanol, and the reslllt is a club striving to be intellectually aware of the Spanish world.

I \, ., :\ L .I I CONCORDIENSTS, October 23, 1986 PageS FEATURES The People's Court of Appeals Talk of the Town The Concordy recently asked: ByPAULSCHOP Last week, M. Herman Davis's creative televisian series was preempted by the base bail playoffs. This week, bowever, he is back with a :Aew show aimed at the burgeoning syndication market. The show is a combination of Saturday Nigllt Live and The People's Court. The show opened as the People's Court traditionally does, with an introduction of the plaintiff, who in this case was an attractive blonde named Bambi Jean Baker, and the plaintiff, pathological liar Tommy Flanagan. · Mr. Flanaga'l has been accused of harboring a vicious dog whom Miss Baker has alleged attacked her withOut provocation. \Miss Baker, please begin your case,\ said Judge Wopner .. \0 judge,\ said Bambi, breathlessly. \Two weeks ago,\ said Bambi in the same tone, \I was sitting home alone. It was a hot, sultry night, the air was so wet and heavy that everything I had on was clinging tightly to my body. Even after I slipped into my nightgown, I still had this feeling.\ ''That's when I knew that I had to get out of that house. Even though it was late, I couldn't sleep. So I put on my robe and I stepped out on my porch, hoping desperately to catch a breeze. I remember seeing a full moon through some thick fog. I also remember hearing a long, low, gutteral moan. It was a deep growling sound. At first I thought that it was one of my neighbors trying to ex:cite me. Then I turned around and I saw this huge set of teeth glistening in the moonlight. I couldn't see anything else because of the fog and the darkness, but I knew that they belonged to some animal.'' \The next thing I knew, someone had knocked me down. I could feel his hot breath on my neck as he ripped my nightgown off with his powerful jaws. I managed to turn around and saw that it was Buttercup, Mr. Flanagan's Doberman, who was attacking me. I've always been afraid of him. Well, I Are you interested in learning how to · meditate? Meditation helps with a II the stress of mid- terms, senior theses, personal relationships, etc ....

The stuff he used at the Watergate.'' ''I can believe that. But I do not believe that you know Agnew.\ \Where is your favorite place to go off the campus grounds?'' \Do you have any evidence, Miss Baker?\ asked the Judge. Interviews and Photographs by Dave Gruber \Yes I do.\ She then produced a badly shredded black lace teddy and a matching see through robe. \Do you see what that animal did to me.\ She also produced a hospital bill for the treatment of her dog bites and pictures of her scars. \Mr. Flanagan, what do you have to say?\ \Well first of all, Judge, this woman is lying. I don't even own a dog. Anyway, Buttercup isn't even a Doberman. He's the size of a cat. Yeah, that's tne ticket, he's a cat, my wife, Morgan Fairchild's f:!at.\ \Judge said Bambi, \he's lying.'' ''Miss Baker, please do not interrupt. Rusty, bring in the dag.\ A few seconds later, Rusty brought the biggest Doberman in captivity into the courtroom. When he brought the dog to the defendant, it was obvious from the dog's response that he was the dog's owner. ''This dog seems to know you, Mr. Flanagan,\ said the Judge. \Why?\ \Because nobody's heard from him in 13 years.\ After a brief commercial break, the Judge rendered his verdict. He sided with the plaintiff. He also rendered this decision. \Mr. Flanagan, in my opinion, yau have tried to deceive this court with your continuous barrage of lies. I therefore am finding you in contempt of court as well as guilty of perjury. Under the revised statutes that the writers have given me this season to base my decisians on, I hereby am sentencing you t~ death. Case closed.\ The show concluded with Mr. Flanagan being dragged bodily out of court, while angrily protesting this decision. Doug llewellyn interviewed him at this point.

The infamous Adam and Rob Hello again, Union drinkers (we are referring to the 21 and over crowd, ·Of course). Here we are, as usual, for your liquor entertainment. As we're sure you've beard by now, this is Alcohol Awareness Week. We hope you are all very aware of alcohol. And have you heard? West and Old Chapel are providing us with mixers this week. Isn't that friendly? It's probably the most useful thing we'll get out of the whole $600. It's too bad the .paper doesn't come out until Thursday, because we wish we could tell you on Monday (that's today for us) what to put in Jan's Mixers each day. WELL, for starters, all of us here at the Lushitivity Council recommend \bringtng\ a pitcher of the \Mouthwatering Libation'' back with you each day. Now, maybe you'll want to bring a large duffel-like jacket :w.ith you to dinner, but WE didn't tell you to do that. So all you (21 year old) freshnien, NOW is the time to master the age-old art of boi?-\owing dishes, silverware, holiday decorations, or anything edible you may once in a while findfrom West. For you ambitious types, we recommend gracing your walls with some of those artsy-fartsy framed posters of the mess hall. Sorry, Jan, didn't mean to disillusion you!! ! Since this is the very first Alcohol Awareness Week that any of us have participated in, we are actually making history here. So, since there is no historical story yet to tell, we've decided to give you a couple of questions to ponder during this creation .period. What is the alcohol content of ? (fill in your favorite liquor). How mq.ch of this elixer does it take to in~ke you bozzed? Drunk? Out Of control? Heave? Take a trip to Ellis? Which of these stages makes you feel the best atthe time? An hour later? The next morning? ·The next night? Ever? What is your tolerance relative to your height? Weight? How much you've eaten? How quickly you've consUQ:led? So, all of you chug champions (i.e.:rugby players), novice chuggers, mello:w drinkers, moderate drinkers, light drinkers, dweebs: take these profoWld thoughts into consideration. Wednesday: Blueberry Ask Adam and Rob Smoothie; 2 oWlces of Caracao p.W.g. By ADAM EMERSON andR()B BLEIFER We would like to make a formal .ap()l<Jgy to the Union College C()rnmunity for our extreme selfishness. Over the .past three years we've gathered an abm1dance of wisdom and knowledge. It was not until recently that we realized that it was only our close friends who were fortunate enough to benefit from our advice. It is our pleaslll\e to present this week's column which will attempt to educate you on some of life's fuzzier points. This week's questions come from students and professors alike. We hope they're helpful. Q1) Dear Adam and Rob, I am a science professor and quite frankly I am awed at the stupidity ()f my students. How can I find the patience to get through any more lectures? 1) Is it pcssible that you've mistaken stupidity for drunkenness? If you're who we think you are, maybe . you should follow your students' example. It might make class more enj()yable. Q2) Dear A.dam. and Rob, I am a Fox basement boy and have this question: Do you walk to work oT carry your lunch? A2) We chew gmn. Q3) Dear Aclam and .Rob, I am a freshman and am curious tCJ know why there is foreplay. A3) Beca11Se a triple play isn't enough and a fiveplay is too demanding on the male. Q.4) Dear .Adam and Rob, Is Goofy a dog? A4) No, it's just a face you make during kinky sex. Q5) Dear Adam and Rob, Who invented liqUid soap and why? A5) We had to do a little research on that one. Actually, Chester Arthur and P.J. Palmolive made a senior project of it duririg their . Union days after dropping the soap in the shower became a pain. ~ Q6) Dear Adam and Rob, Do I ha-ve to read your article to have my question answered? A6) No, and thank you for your question. The ned series of questions come from people more astute than we (wait that's not possible). Well, nevertheless, they are questions that, at the moment, we find UNANSWERABLE. 1) Wb.at is Minnie Mouse's malden. 11ame? 2) Why do we park in a driveway and drive on a parkway? 3) Why do we pay tolls on a freeway? 4) How long does it take to freeze a cat in the average freezer? This question is only temporarily unanswerable as we are working on the answer.) We hope this week's column has been informative. Please feel free to stop us on campus if you have a question on your mind or send questions to Adam and Rob, Box 1428. Now, since we have a little extra room: Pete, Beth, Lisa, Tanya, Rachael, Francie, Ken, Todd, Topcat, Nancy and Ron, Underdog, Rocky, and Bull winkle. This week's dedication is Okay, we just deCided to extend the dedication. Since I personally don't feel like inserting this in some new disc position, we'll just have to take care of this right here.

She Minerva This Week The Minerva Committee, this week, presents· John Marchi, a Republican state senator from Staten Island and chairman of the Senate Finance Com- mittee.

FEATURES Club Reviews Blfi BRIJ THERI-IIfi liSTERS ollcllel)ectlltll Co11,ty By MICHAEL GLOWACKI Big Brothers-Big Sisters• Union College volunteers are an integral part of Schenectady's big Brothers~Big Sisters organizati9n, · comprising almost half of the volunteers. Union is fortunate to have two types of programs. The first is the \.traditional'' Big-Little relattionsh~p, where a Union volunteer \adopts\ a younger child. The two share time and experiences together and are tr~sformed into Big and Little Brother or Sister. The second p.rogram is a group interaction, that usually meets on Sunday. In the group system the .Big is not \assigned'; one Little, but can interact with many. Both programs · are equally rewarding. Union's program also has activities that are coordinated with the Schenectady BBBS organization •. There are several jointly organized picnics and trips. One such trip. last year was to Riverside Amusement Park. There are also seasonai activities including Christmas parties and hay rides. To cap ·off the year there is usually a sit- down dilmer for all involved with the program. · The fun times are great, but it is the relationship between Little and Big that is truly rewarding. It has beensaid that with a little time and energy a Big will help his Little grow and experience the true meaning of friendship. However, it is. not only the Little who grows and learns, it is shared. For anyone intereSted in finding ,out more about the program ·please call or write: BBBS, 924 Albany St., Schenectady, NY 12307 or phone 374-4523. Photo Club The presidentrs house.

Well, the Photo Club has the facilities to make your memories come back to life. Yes, the Photo Club .maintains a darkt()om that is available 24 hours a day, seven days a week with facilities to develop, print The Idol is Union's literary arts magazine. It contains collections of poetry, short · stories and essays. This last is an addition to what has previously been-accepted in The Idol. This year, editors Joy Runyon and Kerrie Ticlmore have ambit~ous plans to make The Idol more than \just\ the college literary magazine. We hope to organize student poetry readings and workshops which and mount black and white photographs. And for those of you who have never used a darkr()om, we can teach you the joys and frustrations of developing your own pictures. The photo club does more than maintain. a darkroom, though. We also present slide shows at cabarets, sponsor photo exhibitions for.events like Parents Weekend, and The Idol will provide a useful and <important service to those writers who would like feedback and the opportunity to expose their work. In addition. to this, we will be sponsoring visiting poets and hope to collaborate with the arts and muf'ic departments to produce visaal interpretations . of creative work. Currently, we are accepting submissions of poetry, short stories, and essays Philosophy Forum on Terrorism By LORI LEON Last spring Diane Stubbins '87 and Judi Philipson '87 discussed reviving the Philosophy Forum on campus. They put their ideas into action this term with the help of Felmon Davis, their faculty ' . advisor. The main purpose of the Forum is to promote discussion and (consequently) awareness of the many aspects of thought (.for ex·ample, politic~:~l and sociological issues, taken from a philosophical viewpoint). They want to involve professors on campus, ' with the possibility of utilizing other resources. The first discussion series will take place in two parts: both will be at 7:30 p.m. in Davidson Lounge on Tuesday, October 28, and Tuesday, November 4. The series is focusing on terrorism. and how we perceive it. The 'first discussion will.be based on the ·question ''What is terrorism?\ and the second will ·cover \What terrorism means to usD·why terrorism?''' lt should be stressed that this is to be an informal gathering · in which all students (not just philosophy) are encouraged to attend and share their views.

Greenhouse Theft By L YNNDlJFFY and JEFFR,EY AUERBACH Someone has been stealing plants from the Union greenhouse l Located behind the psychology building, this glass enclosw-e provides a suitable environment for -biology experiments, faculty greenery, and seedling cultivation for gardening purposes. Since the beginning of the school year however, many of these botanical .projects have been stolen on a regular basis. Moreover, no thefts occw-red during the summer break ... Dick Luniewski, Gar- filening Supervisor for Union, :said the robbers entered •the greenhouse by smash- :ing the glass near the door. Most of .the plants they took measured five to six feet in height and were of considerable weight. Consequently, transportation was necessary to remove them from the campus grounds. · Some professors keep rare and ex:pensive plants in this facility. For _example, Professor 'Huntley lost a substantial portion of his federally regulated plants imported from England. Financial as well as sentimental concerns are at stake. Regardless of where suspicion has fallen, a solution must be sought to deter future vandalism. generally learn from each other's photo experiences during meetings.

At an hour's drive · southwest on Interstate 88, I found myself at the small liberal arts school accompanying my tamily to visit my brother for the school's Parents Weekend. . Although somewhat diversified, a ·lot of emphasis is placed on. the arts at Hartwick, the C()ncrete wall at the entranceway is covered with \artistic\ graffiti, which is ritually painted over by the administration and then ritually embellished with. more graffiti. Large steel three dimensional sculptures adorn the t.op of the grass hill in front of the large circular arts building. Besides academics and the regular patronizing of the rnore than 50 bars in Oneonta, 1mown as \going downtown\ the Hartwick student .body loves their soccer. As football and hockey are to Union, such is soccer to Hartwick. The Division I team lost t() American University last year · in the semifinals in Washington, DC. A suspicious four .in the morning fire alarm in the team's hotel was said to be the cause of their loss. Their field is carved out of a steep slope at the highest elevation of the school, in itself a signifier of the almost spiritual value that is att11ched with the game. The crowd at this particular game was comprised of families gathered to watch Hartwick challenge Penn State, so it was somewhat subdued in the editorial remarks that have become a tradition. Several students respected the company and kept their remarks clean but still audible enough tb.at they could be heard at the bench on the opposite side of the field. On regular occasions, however, the fans arm themselves with Up Up '4 fruit and hurl them at the visiting team's goalie. (Heaven help the goalie who decides to throw a projectile back.) Away With Arthritis National Balloon launch Please Give!! Canisters Are Located Throughout The Campus!! Balloons Will Be Launched During the Half-Time of ~he Middlebury Football Game On November 1, 1986 All Proceeds Go To The / Arthritis Foundation!! Thank You The city of 20,000 is equipped with perhaps the most conservative and enforcive police force who arrest students as well as others for having an open container on the street, a large amount of suspected drunk driving, and for swearing in public. These guarders of justice were out in full force at the game as a deterrent of any embarrassing scenes that might befall the school during the special weekend. The score was tied at one to one at the end of the first half. Several minutes into the second half, Hartwick scored and the crowd roared with cheers. Seconds later Penn State scored on a similar style goal but declared a \cheap shot\ from the fans on the hills. A group of students dressed in such a way as to appear as throwbacks to the sixties chanted an Irish song consisting entirely of \Here we go! \. The show by the students was actually enjoyed by the . parents. Tlle two teams had battled it out but to no avail. Yet with thirteen seconds to go, the atmosphere would turn solemn. Hartwick's keeper rushed a Penn State attacker to the left of the goal who kicked the ball cross net and was headed in by another attacker. Moans of despair and disbelief fell over the crowd and made its way dOVIrl. the hills of Hartwick. But, as friends parted for dinner with tbe family, the words are, \Going downtown? See you there.\ No doubt to lament the team's loss. = ..... .... I1J Ill >- (]) c ..... I.. ::::> 0 u >- .Q 0 0 = a.

Page8 CONCORDJENSJS, October 23, 1986 ------·~-- Foun<kd at { fnion Collqf~ 1877 ---~· General Education Curriculum Goes Unnoticed Does the College community understand what the General Education Curriculum is? For that matter do we even care? We had better care because if we don't--show concern about fun- damental changes in the structure of education at Union, who will? Complaints have been made in the past that students have been excluded from the· decision making process at the College. However, when ~tudents are given the opportunity to influence decisions, and fail to show interest, they have no right to object to the changes made. Last Sunday five students, excluding the members of the Student Forum, attended the open Forum meeting at which the Proposal for· a General Education curriculum was discussed. Maybe the 2,000 or more students who weren't able to spare an hour of their time Sunday night are curious to know what they missed. The purpose of the General Education Curriculum is to ensure that Union students receive a well-rounded general education and educational breadth, while main- taining relative freedom in course selection.The Subcouncil suggestions for the proposed General Curriculrun are outlined on page 3 of Concordiensis and a copy of the proposal is available at the cir- culation desk at Schaffer Library. Students who wish to comment on the General Education Curriculrun can contact Lisa Clark, Michael Hiller 7 Annemarie Loftus, and Gavin Morton. Talk to them and pick up a copy of the proposal.

Proctor's: Revitalizing Union's Social Life In 1977, Proctor 7 s :<~Theatre in downtown Schenectady was taken over by the City for failure by its owner to pay back taxes amounting to $200,000. The theatre was shut down and scheduled ·for demolition. It was then that the theatre was taken over from the City by a group of concerned citizens and civic leaders which later became known as the (ACTS) Arts Center and Theatre of Schenectady, Inc. On January 3, 1979, the newly renovated theatre which. had been showing X-rated movies two or three years earlier, reopened for a sold out performance of \Blackstone the Magician.\ In that year, five shows were performed in a \demonstration\ season. Since that time, Proctor's Theatre has once again become the most successful contributor to Schenectady's cultural arts scene. Presently, the theatre promotes approximately 70 shows a year and has a budget of $4.5 million. However, because of the expensive costs of running the theatre and recruiting touring Broadway shows, Proctor's faces a deficit ofover $300,000. The nonmptofit theatre needs the support of Union students and the campus community. Executive director of Proctor's, Dennis Madden says that \many of Proctors' shows are targeted at old people ranging from ages 40-Florida or 40- death.\ However, \the theatre is desperately in need of enticing the younger audience.'' In the past, Proctor's has promoted such shows as Bill Cosby, Billy Crystal and Spyro Gyra, but the theatre maintains that it wants to attract Union students to many of the other fine shows that play there. On a campus whose social patterns have changed drastically over the past year, Proctor's is simply being overlooked as a source of entertainment by Union students and even faculty members. For example, they should be interested in attending such upcoming shows as \Amadeus\, \The Tap Dance Kid\ and \Cats\. Even such lesser known shows as the Pilobolus Dance Theatre, The Flying Karamazov Brothers, and the many chamber and symphony orchestras that perform there should entice more of a Union crowd. Moreover, as Proctor's Public Relations director Audrey Hughes says \it is very laudable that the College has (subsidized the price of tickets and) provided for a low-cost entertainment package\ for its students. Many of Proctor's performances only cost Union students $4 to attend. The message from Proctor's: for the price of a movie, why not take a chance on . a live performance-· you'll probably enjoy it.

For that matter do we even care? We had better care because if we don't show concern about fun- damental changes in the structure of education at Union, who will? Complaints have been made in the past that students have been excluded from the decision making process at the College.

WRUC's Elkind Recall Urged To the Editor: We are writing in reference to the recall of the General Manager of WRUC. A vote on the recall of General Manager ~cott Elkind is to take place on Wednesday, October 29. The opposing sides of this petition are currently engaged in lobbying for support. As a result of this, false rumors have been circulated. Scott Elkind would like to have the world think that the success of WRUC is a per.sonal accomplishment To quote one of Scott's supporters \How can you change perfection?\ · What Mr. Elkind neglects is the other personalities that have made many contributions to WRUC's success. People such as Rob Gary, Evan Schwartz, Jeff Dinces, and others. Mr. Elkind would also have the WRUC conununity believe that this recall petition is a personal attack by John Morgan. We maintain that is very much false. In order to . have a recall, 25 percent of the voting membership must sign a petiti()n to this ·effect and the petiti()n easUy C!ontains one- third of the voting population. The petiticm has _ also been attacked on the subject of the signatures largely belonging to freshmen. Upon examination, the petition contains only five freshman signatures. Another false rumor is that this action is delaying the effort of WRUC to achieve 1000 watt status. I can guarantee as technical manager that this is not true in any capacity. As WRUC boardmembers we Wlderstand that Scott has done a good job in hiS positions of the past.

WRUC Article Misinterpreted To the Editor: Jason Green does have some valid points in his letter printed in last week's Concordiensis (Budget Specifics Requested).

I disagree, however, with the way Jason centered on a very minor feature of the article: the fact that the College sent only a one•page letter to parents describing the reasons for tuition increases. The problem is not that Union is concerned with paper costs or mailing costs but that to explain things further than he did in the letter (which was well written) would necessitate printing a lot of statistics that most people, I believe, would not bother reading. The statement that Hauser was limited by length restrictions was my way ·Of simplifying what I thought was obvious-any letter covering all the st'tistics and reasoning would be ridiculously long, and as we all know, the longer and more dull a piece of writing looks, the less likelY. it is that we will want to read 1t.

PagelO CONCORDIENSJS, October 23~ ,lfJJS6 Prof. Tom Ross Prof. Ross Invades The N.ott By DIANE STUB.BINS The Nott was filled near capacity as a casually dressed Dr. Ross set the mood for the evening toting a child's colorful xylophone onto the stage. Sporting a beret ai)d a sweatshirt, the musician began with an explanation of the threefold purpose of his musical presentation. The first reason was his own introduction as a member of the Union faculty. The second pW'pose was the demonstration of the ESQ-8- track synthesizer recently acquired by the Union music department. Lastly, Dr. Ross' performance was intended to be a celebration of soUlld. By \soWld Dr. Ross meant more than traditional lyrics or music. He meant the appreciation of typically non• musical sounds as well. Ross produced a variety of sound makers, including bird whistles, children's laser pistols and toy pianos. His first piece, entitled \The Doctor Is In\ utilized some hanging instrwnents such as chimes, pipes and pans that were ever present on stage. R()SS weaved around the set up on stage \playing\ the instruments with At Proctor's British Invasion By A.HELF AND & F. KONLIAN The British are coming, the British are coming! Well, actually they've come and gone. On Oct. 15, 1986, Proctor's theater was proud to present t~e British Invasion 'l'our 1986. Th1s blast into the past featured the Searchers (Love Potion No. 9), Gerry and the Pacemakers (I Like It), Freddie and The Dreamers (You were made for me), Mindbenders (Groovy Kind of Love), and Chad and Jeremy (Yesterday's Gone). Before coming onto stage, each group rolled some of their favorite vintage footage, all destined for the M'l'V archives. Wbat followed next was a dazzling look into rock music of a set of drumsticks while accompanied by prerecorded sollllds on the synthesizer. 'In between numbers Ross carried on an animated dialogue with the audience. It was apparent that he was very comfortable, and his relaxed manner was greeted with a warm reception from the audience. At one point~ a generous member of the audience ran on stage to off(lr a beer to the thirsty· perfolTller. :Many of Ross' pieces required aumence participation and this audience was more than willing to oblige. Tne audience even included a few pre-schoolers wllo contributed their \goo's\ and \ga's\ to the presentation. O!le of these numbers, \Hippie . Bl11es\ was my favorite of Dr. Ross' pieces. Ross introdttced the song with the note that the word \hippie\ was a West African term meaning \tOo see cle!ll'ly.\ The mellow piece w~s performed on the acoustic gllitar and, like several other pieces, had a vocal without words. It was well receivecl, as were the other parts of his p..-esentation. Clearly, Ross accomplished all three of. his original aims and entertamed tlte crowd with a unique mwical sltow.

Well, what if this little black \\Yoman accidentally became illVDlved in internati()llal espionage and foWld herself having secret rendezvous' on Blue Velvet is being shown exclusively at Crossgates and after viewing it I figmed out why .. Remember the Hardy boys, two teenagers who never seemed to do anything else but travel around solving mysteries. Weij: imagine one of the Hardy boys with a death wish and sexual appetite that tolerates sadomasochism. Now that we have accurately described the main character, let us examine the plot. This young man discovers a hwnan ear on the ground while taking a leisur'ely walk. He brings this ear .into the police department and is told that they will now handle the situation. No, no, no this young man cannot accept that and is driven by his love of mysteries to investigate the case of the missing ear by himself. Waitt He does need some assistance and hence recruits ·the police detective's daughter. By D..YSSE FEINGOLD In spite of the p-ublicity that this week's cabaret did have, the crowd was very small and sligbtly less enthusiastic than usual. I consider midterm week the primary factor responsible for the lack of attendance. The performers were not affected by the audience's size; this quaint environment helped· to create a personal bond between performer and viewer. All three artists had a particular group of supporters· present; the atmosphere lent itself to the performers mingling with the audience. T. Walsh, a newcomer to cabaret and to emceeing, made quite an impression on the audience. His funky clothing set the stage for the dynamic act to follow. Although T · partially disrobed prior to his juggling act, his initial outfit was a black top hat with a bright plaid jacket, slacks and pink and black zebra striped sneakers. Several tricks set T Walsh's performance apart from the ordina:c-ily entertaining juggler's act; He involved complex tricks such as rolling the ball down his back while he continued to juggle, eating and juggling meat simultaneously, and juggling exceedingly large pins in a limited space. T Walsh is welcomed on this stage at any time and for any occasion. The first act featured Sbaun Connolly and Dave Provost, performers wbo have earned their place on the cabaret stage. This week's act consisted of music from the Greatful Dead, Bob Dylan and some original music. Shaun .and Dave each opened with a solo performance which included an original piece. Shaun played one of his favorite songs, incorporating a calipso strum and some severe changes in vocal dynamics. Meanwhile, Dave, who wore his classic attire, introduced his solo as \a song about a possessive ~irl.\ With an introduction ·like tliit how could .people not listen intent1y. Dave established his usual cCJmmand of the stage early. A noticeable difference between the two perf()rmers is that Dave's original music seems to focus (In people, specifically girls, while Sham's seems to be about the environment, specifieally ·the ocean. Dave whe> always prefaces his pieces, introduced this one as \a song for someone I once knew - b11t now she's dead.\ The s~m~'s lyrics mention the word rain; the music also seems to recreate a thunderstorm.· This thunderstorm is an appropriate mechanism for \turning (his) wholeworldgray.\ As an added bonus Bob J{atzm!lll, the 2nd Act's performer, accompanied Dave and Shaun with his harmonica. During cabaret,. :B.ob began his act by making l\'eference to his crib sheets which are on the adjacent · stool. B()b' s performance was not at all disturbed by his infreq11ent glances at these note:s. Actually, his act was so well received possibly because of its spontaneity and informal presentation. The most notict!lable thing about Bob was tlt.at he was excited to be perfol'l1.1ing! His excitement and interest in his work transcends an(! radiates to the audience. Before · simply breaking into S()ng, he explained the specifie meaning that the song bad tD him. This personalized.his act :and created an affinity between :himself and the audience. Bob 1 s program was different from that of Shaun's and Dave's. In general; he plays music of Elvis Co:~teno, Paul Simon, and blues tlllles. Bob was his own three man band this evening. He played the acoustic guitar, Ws harmonica and also sang. An()ther noticeable quality tlbout Bob is his strong expression.

His projection was good and his enunciation was superb.

Some of the touching lyrics are \I · remember evenings trembling close to you\ and \trying to go to school is like trying to tame a lion.\ These lyrics vividly describe two common emotions.

Remember the Hardy ooys, two teenagers who never seemed to do anything else but tr ave! around solving mysteries. Well irn.agine one of tile Hardy boys with a death wis:h and sexual appetite that tl)lerates sadomasochism. Now tllat we have accurately describt:d the main character, let us examine the plot. This ymmg man <h::icovers a human ear on the ground while taking a leisurely walk. He brings this ear into the police department and is told that they will now handle the situation. No, no, no this young man cannot accept that and is driven by his love of my-steries to in·vestigate the c11se of the missing ear by himself. Wait! He does need some assistance and hence recruits the police detective's daughter. By IL YSSE FEINGOLD In spite of the publicity that this week's cabaret did have, the crowd was very smalll and slightly less enthusiastic than usual. I consider midterm week the primary factor responsible for the lack of attendance. The performers were not affected by the audience's size; this quaint environment helped to create a personal bond between performer and viewer. All three artists had a particular group of supporters present; the atmosphere lent itself to the performers mingling with the audience. T. Walsh, a newcomer to cabaret and to emceeing, made quite an impression on the audience. His funky clothing set the stage for the dynamic act to follow. Although T partially disrobed prior to his juggling act, his initial outfit was a black top hat with a bright plaid jacket, slacks and pink and black zebra striped sneakers. Several tricks set T Walsh's performance apart from the ordinarily entertaining juggler's act. He involved complex tricks such as rolling the ball down his back while he continued to juggle, eating and juggling meat simultaneously, and juggling exceedingly large pins in a limited space. T Walsh is welcomed on this stage at any time and for any occasion. The first act featured Shaun Connolly and Dave Provost, performers who have earned their place on the cabaret stage. This week's act consisted of music from the Greatful Dead, Bob Dylan and some original music. ShaWl and Dave each opened with a solo performance which included an original piece. ShaWl played one of his favorite songs, incorporating a calipso strum and some severe changes in vocal dynamics. Meanwhile, Dave, who wore his classic attire, introduced his solo as \a song about a possessive ~irl.\ With an introduction like th1s how could people not listen intently. Dave established his usual command of the stage early. A noticeable difference between the two performers is that Dave's original music seems to focus on people, specifically girls, while Shaun's seems to be about the environment, specifically tile ocean. Dave who always prefaces his pieces, introdaced this one as \a song for someone I once knew - but now she's dead.\ The song's lyrics mention the word rain; t:be music also seems to recreate a thunderstorm. This thunderstorm is an appropriate mechanism for \turning Chis) whole world gray.\ As an acided bonus Bob Katzman, the 2nd Act's performer; accompanied Dave and Shaun with his harmonica. During cabaret, Bob began his act by making reference to his crib sheets which are on the adjacent stool. Bob's performance was not at all disturbed by his infrequent glances at these notes. Actually, his act was so well received possibly because of its spontaneity and informal presentation. The most noticeable thing about Bob was that he was excited to be performing! His excitement and interest in his work transcends and radiates to the audience. Before simply breaking into song, he explained the specific meaning that the song had to him. This personalized his act and created an affinity between himself and the audience. Bob's program was different from that of Shaun's and Dave's. In general, he plays music of Elvis Costello, Paul Simon, and blues tWles. Bob was his own three man lland this evening. He played the acoustic guitar, his harmonica and also sang. Another noticeable quality about Bob is his strong expression.

His projection was good and his enWlciation was superb. Bob not only played current music such as \Allison \Fools in Love,\ and \Post Acid Blues,\ but he played music to which the audience could relate. Some of the touching lyrics are \I remember evenings trembling close to you\ and ''trying to go to school is like trying to tame a lion.\ These lyrics vividly describe two common emotions. This was Bob's first performance of the season, but from the audience's reception of him, I expect to see Bob performing frequently.

The play recounts the passionate love affair between Mrs. Elsie Lansing Whipple and handyman Jesse Strang, which ended at Gallows Hill with his hanging for her husband's murder. Author Sidney Michaels created this intriguing play about the prestigous Van Renssalaer Lansing family who resided at Cherry Hill for 176 years, in celebration of historic Albany's Sooth birthday. The play begins in the fall of 1826 with a scene in the home at Cherry Hill, where most of the family are busy chatting and doing chores. Everyone is concerned with financial matters and marriage except for beautiful Elsie who is our drinking with her former schoolmate, Margaret (Gitty) Sanford,, and flirting with a stranger ,they just met and who walks tltem home. This begins the lustful affair between Jesse Strang (alias Joseph Orton, also called 'Doctor') and Elsie which leads to murder and Jesse's hanging. Elsie is a very attractive woman who is only happy ,when she drinks brandy and smokes opium. The third scene of the fourth act takes place in the kitchen where Elsie, on an opium high, believes she sees the devil in the fireplace because she has been told by her servant (former slave) that she will go to hell. She drags her flowing hair into the fire and burns to death. Elsie Lansing Whipple is played by Catherine Cooper who bas performed on Broadway in \A Chrous .Line\ and appeared in daytime serials. Kevin O'Rourke acts the role of Jesse Strang; be has been in the film \Tattoo\ and the CBS series, \Kate and Allie\. Supporting actors are Sylvia O'Brian as Maria · Sanders Van Rensselaer, Ian Egas as Little Abe, Louise Stubbs as Dinah, David Bunce as Abraham, Tanny Mconald as Caty, Joseph Larrabee-Quandt as Calvin Pepper, Jeanne Vigilante as Margaret Sandford and david Combs as John Whipple. The play was . based on a family, especially its beautiful house that remains as a public museum'- The stage was a three story mansion that resembled the true (.'berry Hill home and gave the play the perfect backdrop. Scenery included effects such as the falling of autwnn leaves and flashes of lightning, which added to the very polished performance. \Possession: The Murder at Cherry Hill'' is a great drama that can be seen in the Main Theater of the Egg in Albany through October 30. And So It Goes ... SPECIAL CONTRmUTION By DEBBIE DICLEMENTI Fordham University Brenda Starr .... well, not exactly. If you are going to pursue a career in iournalism, you may have glamourous, preconceived notions but Brenda is a cartoon, after all. There is better literature that will give you some idea of what your career may actually be like: \And So It Goes .... Adventures ln Television\ by Linda Ellerbee (Putnam; $16.95). There is a common belief that experience is the best teacher. Someone else's is even better, however, because you have the opportunity to learn with the benefit of hindsight but without the hwniliation of trial and error. Ms. Ellerbee writes about journalism with unparelleled honesty and humor. This is probably not what the aspiring journalist wants to read at first but it is better. It is the truth. Ms. Ellerbee begins her nwnble but hmnorous accomtt with her childhood. dreams of wanting to be a reporter. She ends up like many young womeiJ of her day. however, dropping out of school to marry and raise babies. College was not the route to her success, struggle was.

She writes of returning to her literary roots, spending 48 hours in a hotel, reading the entire course book list for Journalism 101. She pll$ses the Associated Press test and gets the job. A job she later loses after sending out a personal letter over the wire services. Everybody has a few embarrassing moments in life, but Ms. Ellerbee has made a career of them. The main element that gets her through, gets her ahead, sets her apart and makes this book so special is her unfailing sense of homour.

A Night At The Ballet ByDAWNCHT,JPAY and LISA POSKANSER On Saturday, October 18, at Proctor's Theatre in Schenectady, several hundred people assembled to watch the State of Kentucky's Loui$ville Ballet Company give an enchanting, simplistically elegant performance. The troupe was energetic, enthusiastic, -well syilchronized and very entertaining. The first piece, \Symphonic Variations\ pQrtrayed the dancers as ivory figures against a midnight blue backdrop. The earth tone costumes were reminscent of leaves. The synchronized movements were well-spaced against a. backdrop that hid nothing. It was as if each dancer became .a chord in the melody moving only when their chord was struck. The troupe's second piece involved four male dancers and one ballerina who portrayed the \main character\ of \Lark Ascending\. The male dancers wore skin colored tights with · bare chests, while the ballerina - wore a pale blue satin letoard and tights. The simplicity of the costumes captu.red the innocence of the aark's first ascent. This gentle and eerie piece was ,quite effective at portraying the angel-like mystique of a bird's fir$t flight. After a. brief inte.rmission, the troupe returned to give a lively spoof of an American lady meeting famous people on a luxury cruise. The piece, entitled \The Grado Tour\ indeed, gave ''grand\ highlights from the roaring twenties by· includi,ng such people as George Bernard Shaw, Noel Coward, and Gertrude Lawrence, the \vamp to end all vamps\~ Theda .Bara, Mary Pickford. and Douglas Fairbanks, Alice B. Toklas and Gertrude Stein.x 'Ole piece was charming and eiitertaining, With seemingly more acting than dancing being performed. One of the funniest parts had George Bernard Shaw chasing the vamp, Theda Bara, and getting a lot more than he bargained for! The ballet ended on a Ught note--the awkward Carol Burnett-type American lady had her dreams come true as the ~lO's version of \Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous\ cast saw her off at tlie conclusion of the cruise. This last piece was an entertaining complement to the simplicity of the first two and left the audience with that alHmportant warm, happy- ending feeling. All in all, the Louisville Ballet gave a brief, but satisfying performance for the Proctor's audience. One of the Jazziest Places in Schenect,ady By KARENDELOYE Ever feel like travelling back to the era of jazz bands and mellow blues for just one night? Or, even further, have you ever wanted to sit in and become a member of one of those bands, creating the atmosphere for others to enjoy? Then the Front Street Cafe on Erie Bou{evard has everything you have always wanted, offering jazz and blues entertainment on Tuesday and Thursday nights from 9 to 1 a.m. The Front Street Cafe is a small but highly recommended restaurant and night spot. The entertainment on Tuesdays and Thursdays allows you to hear very good area jazz and blues bands, and the audience is more than welcome to participate. Ail open sit in with the bands is encoW'aged. You may even find a novel, Linda Ellerbee frequently ends up with pie on her face but never on her backside-always ()n her feet. There is more, of course. The success and failure of \Ovemightn and what it's like for a woman in the business. From stories about the campaign trail, to the White House, to other journalists, to her partnership with Lloyd · yourself accompanying a Union student or perhaps the administration (Dr. D'Andrea has often joined in to play the drums). The Front Street also offers a light menu consisting of sandwiches, steamers, and other munchies. Pitchers of beer are $4.50, chips and crackers are usUally free. Aside from the entertainmen~, the Front Street Cafe is a very good fine food restaurant. The menu includes daily fresh fish specials, outstanding veal dishes, Chateaubriand, as well as Shrimp Scampi. The prices are reasonable. All credit cards are accepted, personal checks as well with identification. When that Tuesday night on campus is slow, or you're in the mood for some good, live music, try the Front Street Cafe. It's very close ·and very entertaining. Dobbins; to getting there, to being there, to trying to get out, Linda Ellerbee never cheats her reader with just the successes of her career.

John Cougar Mellencamp and producer Don Gehman are able to coerce the introspective lead singer Michael Stipe to open up and reveal himself. The once mumbling Stipe has evolved into a swirling poet who treats the listener to his twisted perceptions. This musical evolution of R.E.M. has occurred while leaving the original signature. of the band intact. Stipe's often ominous· vocals are backed by Peter Buck's unmistakable jangling guitar and Mike Mill's subtle bass playing. Outstanding songs on the record include 'Hyena,' an old R.E.M. concert classic; 'Superman,' a great cover of an innocent 60s tune; and 'Begin The Begin' where Stipe admits to R.E.M.'s following:. \Clear you look to me for reason-But it's not there-I can't even rhyme\. This is really the first R.E.M. record where the words to the songs are somewhat audible. The band has even gone as far as to scrawl some of the lyrics on the inside jacket- if you can read the handwriting. With repeated listenings, this record remains fresh and exciting. In fact, the songs improve as new soWlds emerge and the listener catches him- herself madly snapping fingers and tapping .feet and possibly even figuring out what these songs are about. Professor Schor's talk drew on French p5ychoanal,ytical and feminist theory. She chose the works of three nineteenth century French women writers to illustrate her ideas about . representation of men in women's fiction.

The Unionairs is a singing group made up of people assoCiated with the College. At this most recent rehearsal, approximately fourteen singers were in attendance, but this was due to a large number of conflicts that afternoon. The group got down to business quiCkly, but · an air of lightheartedness permeated the session. The practice began with a round and then continued with Five Foot ~o, Efes of Blue, which started out slightly weak, but became stronger as the singers moved further into their element. After those two pieces, the Unionairs began work on The Joy of Christmas which they were seeing for the first time. This sight reading went well, in part due to the familiarity of the carols Whicb make u,p the piece. There were a few problems with some of tbe higher notes, but these problems disappeared after a couple run-throughs. Moving on, the group sang Lcok to tile Rainbow a piece which took advantage of the voice blend tlie Unionairs possess. Finally, as the final piece before the rehearsal ended, the Unionairs did a run through of Flying Free. Flying Free appears to be one of those songs you know if you've had either band or choral experience, but you never remember the details. Overall, the rehears! seemed to go well, and it was mentioned toward the end of the hour that their goal was to hold a \song fest\ of sorts on the 17th of December in Old Chapel. I would strongly recommend that an effort be made to hear the Unionairs; they have a lot of potential • which is being realized more during every rehearsal. really refusing the system of representation which was boWld up in male narcissism. That man, she said, felt jouissance (bliss) by being a spectator of his own desirability as he watched the princess look upon his portrait. Schor focused op the tmdermining of this (fhallic power which is dependent upon visual representation. By comparing the work of the three female novelists, she demonstrated the treatment of this theme in French women's literature. AfterwardS, Professor Schor fielded some probing questions from members of the audience. She also discussed the vast amount of work yet to be done in her field. Schor described the task of feminist critics like herself as a continual process of re-evaluating existing literature. She recalled writing papers for undergarduate courses, then seeing her own views change o.ver time with her increased exposure to feminist criticism. Hopefully, presentations such as Professor Schor's, can aid faculty members here at Union to bring new perspectives to the courses.

Art & Nature A slide-show lecture on Medieval Gardens was presented in the Arts Building on Tuesday, October 14, by Ms. Claudia Lazzaro. The slides used in the lecture consisted both of photographs taken in Florence, Italy, and blue-prints of the different plans of the various gardens. The sixteenth-century gardens displayed an \ideal marriage of art and nature,\ as the gardens were carefully planned out to have geometrical patterns sim.Uar to those of ideal cities. A garden consisted of beds of flowers, fruit trees, and groves of largertrees which were usually evergreens.

The Steinmetz Memorial Lecture Endowment Fund was started ln 1925, two years after his death, to honor Steimnetz's accomplisbments and to allow for lectures by eminent scientists · and engineers. occur today. However, Dr. (Haever showed that pathological science occurs today. \ Up Or On The Rocks Dr. Giaever immigrated to Canada from Norway in 1954 to work with Canadian General Electric's Advanced Engineering Program. He joined G.E.'s Research and Design Center in 1958, two years after immigrating to the USA. He received the Nobel. Prize in pbysics inl973, is the author of 67 papers, and has received 29 U.S, patents. Dr. Giaever's talk, titled \Pathological Science 2\ discussed how scientists sometimes reach incorrect results to fit desired conclusions and how these fab:;e conclusions are accepted. willingly by other scientists which can cause delays · in the true scientific discoveries. Dr. Giaever referred. to Pathologi.ca} Science as \sick\ science or \science that is not so\. He began his talk with an example from the 19th Century. Soon after X-rays were discovered by the Germans, Blondlot, a French scientist, claimed that he had discovered N-rays. He said that if a brick was left in the sun, and then put In 1963, a Russian scientist named DerjagUin discovered what he called Poly-water, This was water that had the characteristics of . a 'plymer such as plastic. Although .it was made up of water, it could be used as a plastic. U.S. scientists easily accepted this ·dicovery. The Wall Street Journal .reported that soon all furniture could be made from Poly-water. Eight years after )lis dil!lcovery, Derjaguin admitted that he was wrong. - Dr. Giaever said that discoveries that do not agree. with accepted laws of science such as N-rays, sliould be questioned because the nsitory of science shows that scientific discoveries follow a relativelJT smooth path which back up accepted laws. Giaever remarked that current .aspects of science such as astrology, ESP, faith healing, anc.I psychokenesis should be questioned as topics of pathological science. He said it is remarkable that in a cmmtry with such a high state ot technology we can still easily accept ideas that contradict accepted sclence. He presented an article from a newspaper in which a woman had just won a million dollar lawsuit because she Claimed that she had lost the power of ESP after having, a CAT-scan. Giaever stressed that questionable discoveries should be .scrutinized instead of blindly accepted. He said that cross checking of theories in tlie scientific community is necessary so that study is not wasted on false assumptions. Dr. Giaever added that this By STEVE KONLL\N The 21-year\'()ld drinking law may be the most controversial issue on Union College this fall. The social life on campus has deteriorated ~nd there is a growing discontent among the student body. I myself am against both last December's increase to twenty- one and the college's administration policy in handling the issue. However, I must admit that there are cases of alcohol abuse on campus. Yet, I believe that if the students are more informed about alcohol and its effects, then we will have a new weapon to combat the school's coined response of \liability\. In this article I will present various facts about alcohol to set straight some of the conunon myths. Let's say it is Friday night and you and a group of your friends decide to have a few cocktails in the room to start the night. Here are a few facts that will invluence your choice of beverage.: 1) A twelve ounce beer, a five ounce glass of wine, and an ounce and a quarter shot of liquor all contain the same amounts of pure alcohol; 2) Switching drinks over the course of the night will not affect your blood alcohol content. As for feeling sick or throwing up from mixing, it is usually caused by the mix of non-alcoholic ingredients; and 3) If you want to slow down the effects of the alcohol, then drink slowly while eating beforehand, and snack as you drink. Also, in deciding what to drink, remember that wine and beer are absorbed less rapidly than straight liquor. Diluting alcohol with water will slow absorption, while mixing it with carbonated beverages may increase absorption into the circulatory system. Sobering Up Contradictory to television, there is no way to. sober up quickly. It takes time ,to metabolize the alcohol in t~ bloodstream. A cold shower, black coffee, oxygen, or exercise will have little effect.

There is much more to learn about alcohol and its effects (such as .becoming an exp~rt in mixGlogy). Don't get me wrong, I am not implying that you preach the 19th Amendment; but hDpefully, knowledge about alcohol will lead to a greater awareness. Have a good night! Prof Georg,e Gives Talk By STEVE KONUAN Biology Professor Carl George and a representative from the State Department of Environmental Conservation will present an information session on the $1.45 billion Environmental Quality Bond Act. Professor George will speak on Wednesday, October 29, at the Price Chopper Community Room, Eastern Avenue. He will discuss the potential impact of the bond act in the Schenectady area. in a dark room, the brick gave off N-rays which were barely detetcable and interestingly, these rays did not obey any law of physics. Because the French did not want to be left behind in the race for s.cientific discoveries, they gladly accepted Blondlot's discovery without question. This discovery was accepted until a few years later a scientist named Wood asked Blondlot to perform the experiemnt for him. Blondlot di:d so, and because he could not see in the dark room, Wood removed the prism used to diffract N-rays in the experiment. When Blondlot performed the experiment again, he obtained the same results unknowing that the prism was missing. This ended _. the belief that N-rays exist. Of course, this happened a century ago and poor scientific processes such as this may not open debate can be seen in current scientific projects sucll as \Star Wars\ where the scientific community . is definitely split on the program's actual merits. Handy Drug Fact Sheet: By DAVE PADDEN In 1943, the chemist Labert Hoffman, while working with derivatives of lysergic acid, indluding D..J:ysergic acid diethylamide, experienced vertigo and blurring of mental alacrity. He checked his observations by ingesting 0.25 mg. of the compound and again found himself beset by a syndrom of hallucinations, depersonalization, and ver:tigo. The recognition that an extremely small quantity of a chemcial could produce the sy;mptoms of mental intoxication that had features in conunon with schizophrenia, supported the long latent concept of a biochemical basis of mental disease. In the experimental psychoses produced by D-lysergic acid methylamide tartrate (I.SD-25) persons can describe their symptoms and yet ·retain a knowledge that ~they are drug induced. Contact with reality is not lost. The amazing feature of the acti9n of ISD-25 is its potency. In this respect it vies with certain of the vitamins and hormones. The administration of as little· as lmcg.~kg. will elicit the hallpcinogenic effect. LSD-25 appears to block critical inhibitions. There are likely specific blocking effects on the sympathetic No.· 2 LSD intracortical circuitS and-or sympathetic projections to and from the telencephalon. Cortical visual areas are involved; giving rise to imagery and light hallucinations. Auditory and gustatory effects are also noticed. The most careful study was made by Katz et al. (1966). In nonnal volunteers who had no knowledge of the nature of the drugs administ~red, the following behavioral states were observed after administration of LSD-25: a moderately euphoric state characterize~ by feelings of elation but not entirely devoid of tension and \jitteriness\; a dsyphoric state of tension and \jitteriness~' loss of control and feelings of ambivalence, of happy, relaxed feelings, but at the same time tense, fearful, \jittery\, and afraid of losing control of themselves. These three states 'were differentiated reasonably . well and the condition of ambivalence was the most striking of the I.SD-25 effects, It also seems to affect different personalities in different ways and the response was found to be influenced by the experimental sit1ii4tion. A subject under the influence of LSD-25 , loses his ability to concentrate on a specific, significant sensation e.g., pain. His attention span is short for any single sensation and there is a kaleidoscopic change of feelings, of disaster, delightful 1 images, a gregarious sense of well being which may be followed quickly by other sensory ·impressions. The psychic impact may last for as long as two weeks in some in- dividuals. Perhaps no other drug has stimulated as :much .public concern and legal debate as I.SD-25. Its abuse led to tlle decision · to terminate tlu production by tlle manufacturer. ·Suicidal attempts, convulsions, uncontrolled aggression a11d ego-shattering panic reactiCJns have been r~ported. In addition, chromosomal changes in human leucocytes produced in vitro by LSD-25 have been reported (Cohen· et al., 1967). Drug dependence may be induced, and on the whole the danger of promiscuous use ()f LSD-25 is ql!ite real. Next week, we'll start the weekend early with a special Halloween addition of the handy drug fact sheet. Until then, star calm and have ·a pleasant tomorrow .•.

Let's put it this way .... in their· last two games, Union·has.outscored their opposition 1()().{). AddingUnion's 28 points from their shutout victory· last Sunday over RPI,- to their 72; racked up against Watervliet the Saturday before, the total reaches the enormous scDre of· 100 points-unheard of in just two gam.es of rugby. Union scored· early in. the game on. Sunday, abo11t 10 minutes into the game, when. rookie Perry LeVY weaved in and out of RPI defenders for a try, his second of the year. Dave Blee converted the try for two points, and Union was up., 6-0. Later iii the second half, Union brought the score upto ten wpen eighth-man Chris Sheridan took the ball out of the serum 011 the five-meter line, · ran around weak side, and dove in to the try-zone. Because of the difficult angle of the conversion, Blee miSsed it, and at half time Union was ahead, 1().(),. -\ Never letting up, Union came right back at them in the second half. Tom Michael had a nice rWl of his own up through the middle of defenders and f{)rced. his. way into the try•zone t() put Union up by 14, and then the score reached 16-0 after Blee made the extra .kick. Soon after, Michael got his Second try {)f the game on a 50-meter run down the right sillieline set up by a blistering L\UD by prop Tom ChristianS()n 'Wbl> ran with the ball for abo11t 15 meters before passing off tv Michael.

The ball was apssed dOcWJl the line into the hands of ~lleridan who cut · inside heading· for the try-2:one, but when he Jkeard a shout from his left, he tilr'ned to see that John Baker, too., was wide open and passed .b~ck to Baker who ran it in foe bis first career A- team try. After the conversion was hit, the -wllisUe sounded and Union won tlieir second in a row-this oae by a final score of 28-0. \They were a gutsy team,\ felt prop Scbtt Phillips, \but they basicl~ lacked the finesse 'that we ·hall.\ Union pla.:ys their fifth game of the seasott at Hamilton this weekend.

However, lte felt, if the line loses inte111;ib' during practice a loss is po:slrible.

The Killer B's, too, were victorious, this match was won by a smaller margin, 4-0. The. game was back and fort)l until Union got a break down by RPl's try-~i>ne. After RPI recovered a line-out in their own try-zone, an Engineer rugger tried to boot the ball out of play, but instead, lined the ball forw-ard into the eagerly awaiting arms of Union freshman Ed Vassallo, who dove forward for his first try. Freshman Moe Kauff missed the conversion from a · difficult angle, and the rest of the game was scoreless-the final was Union, 4-0. In the second half, however, Union added a couple of players to their injured list. Vassalo took a shot in the chin and ended up having to leave the game for the hospital where he received several stitches. Another player that Union will miss for a while is wingcforward, Steve. Bordonaro, who received a blow to the left side of his forehead. After being driven to the hospital, Bordonaro came back 12 stitches heavier with a note saying he'll be out of the lineout for two weeks.

However; these two teams, who have emerged as the champions of their respective lea~ues have become instantane!)us rivals. Part of the blarnef<II\'·this new rivalry cari pr-obably be attributed to the New York Yankees. Yankee f.;ans and Red Sox fans have hatecd each. oth~r forever, or at lea:.st since the Red Sox traded :&abe Ruth to the Yankees in the em-ly 1900's •. The dislike amongst the players · and fans from each city still continues today as. 8()ston fans remain frustrated with Bucky Dent's home run ill 1978, and Boston players ar~ still angry with Yankee fans for having to retrieve Jim Riee\s stolen cap earlier this season .. As a result of tlljs bitterness between the Reel ~bx and the Yankees, many Red Sox fans are taking their h.atred and frustrations out 011 the Mets. · The Red Sox have not.won a , world series since 1~18, and by winning this year, 1lle Red Sox will accomplish far .more than just bringing a world championship to Boston, for they will once and. for all conquer New York. The two cities, located only 225 miles apart attd an hour's shuttle ride away~ are rivals in more than just baseball. In football, the Patri()ts and Jets have become enemies as both compete in the S&lle division. Although the Bruins and Rangers are no lo11ger in the same division, tile Bruins' victory in th~ 1972 Stmley Cup still is savored by 'Bostonians. The Celtics and Knicks were · fiercely competitive in the early 1970's, then in 1984 both teams met in a divj~ional playoff; which the Celtics won in seven games, but New Yorkers got\ revenge last Chris1mas when the Celtics gave away a 25-point lead to the Knicks, and allowed the Knicks to win in double overtime. ___ ----. - some .of their own reasons for wanting to heat each other .as well.· The Red Sox general manager, Lou Gorman worked in the Mets' front office before coming to Boston. Gorman bas made some fine acquisitions .for tb'e Red Sox, but nevertheless is still not considered a geniliS like his Met cowtterpart, Frank Cashen. Also, enhancing this match up is the trade the two teams made last winter. The key players in the trade were the Red Sox sending left-handed pitcher Bob Ojeda to the Mets, and in exchange the Red Sox obtaining Calvin Schiraldi. The deal has helped lx!th teams in their quest for supremacy. Ojeda won 18 games for the Mets this year, and Schiraldi has become the Red Sox ace relief pitcher. However, before the mid-season emergence of Schiraldi, most people thought this trade was another Red Sox blunder. And now, one of these two players is sure to help eliminate his ex- .teamn:Jates. . The Red Sox jwnped out to an early lead in the series, and Bostonians felt temporarily vindicated. But, the Mets have been a comeback team all season, and with their e:xPlosive offense, and tremendous pitching depth, the Red Sox must not let up if they are to finally conquer the Big Apple.

Yes, the Dutchmen are undefeated, and while such a performance is usually indicative of overwhelming power, the Dutchmen are not steamrolling ahead. Thus, the title of this article is called \First and Ten.\ Why \First and Ten\ one may ask? Well, for all of you who ar ~ not up on \gridiron\ terminology, \first and ten\ is the start of a possession or is the eff·~ct of achieving another possession instead of giving the ball away. Union did win 21-0, but during the entire game it seemed as though things were just not \.clicking.\ In fact, they were not. Neither Tim Valachovic nor jim Piorier could quite get the Dutchmen in a \groove\ until the fourth quarter. It . was as though ~e Dutchmen had the hall on the1r eight yard line with a third down and one conversion ahead of them, and in fact, the Dut- chmen did get the first down' and a new beginning. Saturday, the Union Dutchmen will put this atrochious victory over Coast Guard behind them and embark on a new mission. So, appropriately titled \First and Ten'', the Dutchmen are faced with another chance. Union only gained 300 total yards (60 of which came on punts and kick off returns) while Coast Guard gained 240 yards. This would not be bad if Union did not average 350 yards per game and only give up 196 yarrls per g~e. After several exchanges of fumbles, the Dutchmen started scoring at 7:57 of the first quarter. Darrell Shepherd scored on a 5 yard run to cap off a six play-30 yard drive. The next two and one half quarters were characterized by punt after punt after punt. Union scored again on a 1 yard run by fullback Ryan Mason in the fourth quarter and then again with a 76 yard drive capped off with a 21 yard strike to Mark Stachowiak, The game was not a total disaster. To begin with, Jim Piorier did play fairly well. He was 5 of 8 for 86 yards, 1 touchdown and no interceptions while Union's defense stopped Coast Guard on their goal lille . when linebacker Marc Paqlli.n · recovered a fumble on the f()W' yard line to permit Unioll's • defense to achieve their second • shut out. This week the Dutchmen will face a much improved Williams College ball club. I do mot • .anticipate the Ephmen giving Union any trouo1e, out umon must begin tbe quest for the National Champi~nship this· week. A new psyche must be developed and Union's offense has to \click.\ The Dutchmen will probably go undefeated again this year but I hope they do with the schedule they have. It is going to be a different level of football come the playoffs, with 3 time defending champi~n Augustana ranked aroWld 11th in the nation. There is a lot m()re competition in the Division III arena. Not to despair, Union fans. There is no .doubt, at least in my mind, that the Dutclnnen are ready to roll. The players realize their lousy performan<!e last week and so do the coaches. Coach Bagnoli may be the best coach in the nation and will somehow motivate his team. Look out Williams! I ! Freshman Norm Hale No. 25, controls the ball for the 9·1-1 Dut- chmen. No. 98 Freshmah Greg Hallas makes the stick. The Dutchmen ct.efense recorded it's 2nd shutout in 6 games.

It was as though ~e Dutchmen bad the ball on their eight yard line with a third down and one conversion allead of them, and in fact, the Dut- clunen did get the first d()wn' and a new beginning. Saturday, the Uni()n Dutchmen will put this atrochious victory over Coast Guard behind them and embark on a new mission. So, appropriately titled \First and Ten\ the Dutchmen are faced with another chance. Union only gained 300 total yards ( 60 of which came on punts and kick off returns) while Coast Guard gained 240 yards. This W()uld not be bad if Union did not average 350 yards per game and only give up 196 yards per game. After several exchanges of fwnbles, the Dutchmen started scoring at 7:57 of the first quarter. Darrell Shepherd scored on a 5 yard run to cap off a six play-30 yard drive. The next two and one half quarters were characterized by punt after pW!t after punt. Union scored again on a 1 yard run by fullback Ryan Mason in the fourth quarter and then again with a 7S yard drive capped off with a 21 yard strike to Mark Stachowiak. The game was not a total disaster. To begin with, Jim Piorier did play fairly well. He was 5 of 8 for 86 yards, 1 touchdown and no interceptions while Union's defense stopped Coast Guard on their goal line when linebacker Marc Paquin recovered a fumble on the four yard line to permit Union's defense to achieve their second shut out. This week the Dutchmen will faee a much improved Williams College ball club. I do not antieipate the Ephmen giving Union any trou01e, out umon mu.st begin the quest for the National Championship this week. A new psyche must be developed and Union's offense has to \click.\ The Dutchmen will probably go undefeated again this year but I hope they do with the schedule they have. It is going to be a different level <>f football come the playoffs, witl13 time defending champion Augustana ranked around 11th in the nation. There is a lot more competition in the Division III arena. Not to despair, Uriion fans. There is no doubt, at least in my mind, that the Dutchmen are reacly to roll. The players realize their lousy performance last week and so do the coaches. Coach Bagnoli may be the best coach in the nation and will somehow motivate his team.

CXVI,No.S Curriculum Changes Will Necessitate More Faculty ·D'Andrea Feels 9 Professors, ~~Reshaping\ is Enough By MELISSA STEWART If the General Education Curriculum proposal is passed as it now stands, there will be a need for a change in course offerings. Th~ most obvious of these is an increase in the number and variety of history classes available to students. An increase in the number of classes seems to imply a need for new faculty. It is estimated that as many as six professors may be added to the history department. It is also likely that more professors will be needed to teach literature courses in both the English and Modern Languages Departments. There has been a con- siderable amount of uncertainty as to whether or not the present plan of hiring 12 new professors over a course of four years will satisfy the needs of the new program. Dr. Thomas D'Andrea, vice president for academic affairs, feels that it will not be necessary to deviate from this plan. He says that \reshaping is all that is needed,\ since only three of the 12 positions have been filled at this time. According to him, there should be no problem because although there will be a need for new courses, other classes will be eliminated. For this reason, most of the shift can be handled by present faculty. He also says, \Some classes will become more popular, but the work load of professors should not increase since the nwnber of students (attending Union) will remain the same.\ The possibility of a need for new professors was also taken into consideration when hiring professors for the present academic year. Many of the professors hired are visiting professors. While some were hired to fill the positions of professors on temporary leave, others were hired due to an- ticipation of somewhat different needs in the future. Once the General Education Curriculum is either passed or rejected, there will be an attempt to hire permanent professors.

The controversy over the lack of debates among the guber- natorial candidates apparently was on everybody's mind. One of those who expressed an opinion on this subject was Bill Barnes, the party's candidate for Schenectady County Sheriff, who said, \I definitely think that Cuomo should debate O'Rourke. It's healthy for the American way of life and government that two can- didates debate.\ The governor is not the only incumbent who has been reluctant to debate. According to Barnes, three local Republicans who are running for reelection this year have refused to debate. Said Barnes, \The NAACP invited all of the candidates up to the Hamilton Hill Boys Club for a debate. Only the Democratic can- didates showed up. They were myself, Carolyn Micklas (the Democratic challenger to Assemblyman James Tedisco in the 107th District) and Paul Perillo (the Democratic challenger to Senator Hugh Farl~y in the 44th district.) The Republican incumbents didn't come. They received both a written, mailed invitation and a telephone invitation.\ Also present and expressing an opinion on this subject was New York State Secretary of State Gail Shaffer. Shaffer feels that this issue has not affected Cuomo's standing in the pools. Said Shaffer, ' 'I don't think many people are following this or any other issue. There has been a great deal of lethargy and apathy among the voters. Even this debate issue has not produced much interest.'' Shaffer has done a great deal of campaigning for the governor. When asked if the polls are accmately reflecting Cuomo's popularity, Shaffer replied, \I have never believed in polls. People put too much credence into thern. In 1982, for instance, if we had looked at the polls we would not have bothered to campaign, because Koch had a rWiaway lead going into the primary. 1 do think that Cuomo will win by a large margin.'' According to Shaffer, the Cuomo campaign's biggest problem is, voter apathy. Shaffer said, \The only thing that would diminish his margin is voter apathy.

Student Center Nears Completion Interior Designer Begins Work By LORI RICHARD On Friday, October 24, the director of the Colle~e Center and Student Activities, Jerri Clark and . the college center committee held a meeting with the architect and contractor of the College Center. At present, Carnegie Hall is known only as a construction site~an area of confusion located somewhere· between the Arts BtPJ.ding. and the Social Sciences Building. Such a familiar scene has this become, in fact, that one needs to be reminded of the ultimate purpose of the constant com- motion: the emergence of the new coll~ge center. According_ to Ms.bClark, architect Gordon Burton gave no definite answer as to when the center would actually be completed. Ms. £lark did say 1 however, that the report was very positive, stating no problems with the project as yet. Burton informed that all construction plans are on schedule and that if the project . continues to run smoothly, the center is due to be completed sometime in the spring. .Also present at Friday's meeting was Coco Raynes, · a graphic designer from aosttm. Ms. Rayn,es used this first meeting as an opportunity to set · down some basic objectives for the interior design of the •. Jer.ri Clark, College Center Director, is working with interior designer. building. Ms. Clark explained that one of the major goals Will be to create a \crossroads\ at the entrance level of the center. This would be a large ar.ea of open space which would act as a natural meeting place for students to congregate day and night. Ms~Rayneswill return to Union in the next few months m. an attempt to get a better feeling . for the students at Union; hopefully, this will aid her in creating an atmosphere conducive to Union students . Ms. Clark stated that there is still a lqt of wor:k to complete on the center with Windows and newly added skylights that will make the building brighter and . more spacious. Furthermore, Ms. Clark feels. that the center's nearby location to Jackson's . Gardens will provide an ideal s.etting for both work and relaxation. · The 1986-87 school year marks the .final stage in the iong- awaited completion of Union's new college center, a facility which in addition to housing the new student mailroom, and the new upperclassman contract dining hall, will provide an automatic teller machine, a 210. seat theatre for films and l~ctures, and a snack bar. Other features of the building will . include a twcrstory bookstore, . numerous work and conferenee rooms, as well as study and media lounges. The debate controversy was not the only concern discussed by the candidates who were present on Monday. Carolyn Micklas has placed economic concerns at the top of her agenda. \The most important issue is the economy. Tedisco mentions opportunity zones. They will not be effective in Schenectady. Only 16 percent of the city's residents will be eligible to participate. The program does not apply to the GE workers who have lost their jobs,\ said Micklas. Co:ntroversiai\Gel Time''Pianned for'87 College System Rehauled to Fit Program \I think • . • that O'Rourke has no chance of winning. He's a nice guy, but he's far behind.\- Rep. Sam Stratton Micklas also feels that Tedisco has overemphasized another issue. \Tedisco is vulnerable. He is a one issue candidate. That issue is missing children. This issue is not very relevant to Schenectady County, where there has never been an abduction of a child by a stranger. The FBI recently reported that only 67 children in the US were abducted by strangers last year.\ Micklas continued, \Even one child abducted by a stranger is too many. However, the focus· on this issue is misdirected. What about the missing children lost because of drugs, alcohol, or teenage pregnancy, . and Schenectady County has a · · high rate of teenage pregnancy, or those who leave this city because of a lack of jobs?\ Micklas has held numerous positions, including a seat on the Schenectady school board, the Planned Parenthood Board of Directors, and · the Schenectady County Democratic Committee, in addition to her job at Union College's Institute of Administrative Management, before choosing to run for the Assembly. Adding a national perspective to the evening was Congressman Sam Stratton, who is running unopposed for a 15th term. When asked whether he felt that President Reagan would make a campaign ap- pearance in New York, Stratton replied~ \I think that he'll be concentrating OQ other races. I think; obviously, that O'Rourke has no chance of winning. He's a nice guy, but he's far behind. D' Amato .Is rwming strong. Reagan will be concentrating on the West, where the farm By JOANNE McANDREWS Dwight Wolf, Registrar of Union College, recently outlined the provisions of the new class sche!iule called \Gel Time\ which will be implemented Fall term 1987. Initially, the <;:ommittee on Undergraduate Educatioll (CUE) made a recom- memlation that the prese11t class schedule be examined. They carne up with a proposal that became known as \Gel Tim~\. Last year, the proposal was brought before the Academic Affairs Council (AAC) and the faculty and was appr()ved by both groups. After some discussion, the · AA.C decided to delay the .proposal's implementation until the fall CJf 1987 due to the number <>f changes that were occuring on campus at the time, i.e., coJJ- struetion on campus, the raising of the drinking age, and other.s. After Gel Time is in effect for two years, it will be reviewed by the ~.ampus community. Why was Gel Time approved by tile AAC and the faculty despite student feelings against it? Wolf stated, \The majority of the faculty felt that educationally it was sound and desirable. remember, most of the students here have never experienced such a system, · while the faculty have, if not while teaching at other schools, then certainly d!lring their undergraduate years. Much of me student opposition may have been because they were worried .about the two hour classes under Gel Time. But, we have a nwnl>er of such courses now.'~ The reasoning behind Gel Time is. as follows. Presen.tly, classes meet four (or five) days a week (in the case <lf matllematics)-this does net leave much time from one class meeting to the next for students to asshnilate the haterial and · prepare for the' next class. Under the new schedule; there will be time between class meetings for students to complete assignments, so that the n~w material presented will \gel\. but certainly there will be some problems when we actually do it for the .first time. For Gel Time to work we will need to ensure a fairly unifonn distribution of courses.\ Concluded Wolf, \I have heard a lot of people who seem to be worried about Gel Time, I really don't think that this will cause any dramatic changes. Many other institutions have this schedule. Students may end TYPI,NG· DOLLARS A gift. certificate There will be two different \slots\ when classes will be held. Some classes will meet Monday, Wednesday, and Friday for 65 minutes and others will meet Tuesday and Thursday for 100 minutes each time. classes will begin at 9 a.m instead of 8: 30, and Calculus classes will have a small amount of time added to them. Because of the way that the schedule will work, Tuesday and Thursday morning labs will be available. Wolf commented, \This is a side benefit. Under the new schedule we will 6e able to offer seven lah periods a week instead of the present six. This will· result in better use of the lab space.\ . up liking it because it will give them more time to prepare for classes. I hope that people will give it a chance.\ Buy a gift certificate for a fri.end. It's worth free typing done for theFfl. $5.00 and up. Call 346- 0344 or Ext. 6130. Another advantage to the new schedule is the Tuesday and Thursday morning block of time from 10:4o-12:50 which will not have any classes scheduled during it. This so-called \Common Time\ will be a time during which College com- mittees can meet, and con- voc~tions, speakers, and events such as the Minerva Hour can be held conflict-free. Gel Time will make exam scheduling easier. Another plus is that it will eliminate the problem of courses overlapping with each other. It simply can't happen under the new schedule. Wolf sees few problems with the implementation of Gel Time. \We've oper~ted on our present : schedule for 20 years. Thus, at first, Gel Time will require more coordination. There is a certain amount of inertia in any college, which makes change difficUlt.'' Last year, a dry run of Gel Time was conducted to insW'e that ther.e was enough classroom space at the right times. \That schedule' worked, RIIIARCH PAPEBI· 16,278 to choose from -all subjects ·Order Catalog Today with Visa/MC or COD ~ .. 800•351·0222. in Calif, 1213) 477;s226 Or, rush $2.00 to: Research AUiatance · 113221daho Ave. #21J&,SN, los Angeles, CA90025 . .Custom research also avaliaQie-alllevels: .

At present, Carnegie Hall is known only as a construction site-an area of confusion located somewhere between the Arts Building and the Social Sciences Building. Such a familiar scene has this become, graphic designer from Boston. Ms. Raynes used this first meeting as an opportunity to set down some basic objectives for the interior design of the in fact, that one needs to be reminded of the ultimate purpose of the constant corn- :E motion: the emergence of the E new college center.

Ms. Clark did say, however, that the report was very positive, stating no problems with the project as >- n 0 - 0 ..c: a. Jerri Clark, College Center Director, is working with interior designer. yet. Burton informed that all construction plans are on schedule and that if the project continues to run smoothly, the center is due to be completed sometime in the spring. .Aiso present at Friday's meeting was Coco Raynes, · a building. Ms. Clark explained that one of the major goals will be to create a \crossroads\ at the entrance level of the center. This would be a large area of open space which would act as a natura~l meeting .place for students to congregate day and night. Ms.Raynes will return to Union in the next few months in an attempt to get a better feeling for the students at Union; hopefully, this will aid her in creating an atmosphere conducive to Union students. Ms. Clark stated that there is still a lQt of work to cmnplete on the center with wiNdows and newly added skylights that will make the building brighter and more spacious. Furthermore, Ms. Clark feels that the center's nearby location to Jackson's Gardens will provide an ideal s.etting for both work and relaxation. The 1986-87 school year marks the final stage in the long- awaited completion of Union's new college center, a facility which in addition to nousing the new student mailroom, and the new upperclassman contract dining hall, will provide an automatic teller machine, a 210- seat theatre for films and lectures, and a snack bar. Other features of the building will include a twoastory bookstore, numerous work and conference rooms, as well as study and media loWlges. The debate controversy was not the only concern discussed by the candidates who were present on Monday. Carolyn Micklas has placed economic concerns at the top of her agenda. \The most important issue is the economy. Tedisco mentions opportunity zones. They will not be effective in Schenectady. Only 16 percent of the city's residents will be eligible to participate. The program does not apply to the GE workers who have lost their jobs,\ said Micklas. Controversiai\Gel Time\Pianned for'87 College System Rehauled to Fit Program $$$$ $$$$ \I think ..• that O'Rourke has no chance of winning. He's a nice guy, but he's far behind.\- Rep. Sam Stratton Micklas also feels that Tedisco has overemphasized another issue. \Tedisco is vulnerable. He is a one issue candidate. That issue is missing children. This issue is not very relevant to Schenectady County, where there has never been an abduction of a child by a stranger. The FBI recently reported that only 67 children in the US were abducted by strangers last year.\ Micklas continued, \Even one child abducted by a stranger is too many. However, the focus on this issue is misdirected. What about the mtssmg children lost because of drugs, alcohol, or teenage pregnancy, and Schenectady County has a · high rate of teenage pregnancy, or those who leave this city because of a lack of jobs?\ Micklas has held nwnerous positions, including a seat on the Schenectady school board, the Planned Parenthood Board of Directors, and the Schenectady County Democratic Committee, in addition to her job at Union College's Institute of Administrative Management, before choosing to run for the Assembly. Adding a national perspective to the evening was Congressman Sam Stratton, who is running unopposed for a 15th term. When asked whether he felt that President Reagan would make a campaign ap- pearance in New York, Stratton replied, \I think that he'll be concentrating on other races. I thJnk, obviously, that O'Rourke has no chance of winning. He's a nice guy, but he's far behind. D' Amato 1s running strong. Reagan will be concentrating on the West, where the farm By J()ANNE McANDREWS Dwight Wolf, Registrar of Union College, recently outlined the provisions of the new class schedule called \Gel Time\ which will be implemented Fall term 1987. Initially, the Committee on Undergraduate Education (CUE) made a recom- mendation that the present class schedule be examined. They came up with a proposal that became known as ''Gel Time\. Last year, the prop<Jsal was brought before the Academic Affairs Council (AAC) and the faculty and was approved by both groups. After some discussion, the AAC decided to delay the proposal's implementation Wltil the fall of 1987 due to the number of changes that were occuring on campus at the time, i.e., con- struction on campus, the raising of the drinking age, and others. After Gel Time is in effect for two years, it will be reviewed by the '-!amp us conununity. Why was Gel Time approved by the AAC and the faculty despite student feelings against it? Wolf stated, \The majority of the faculty felt that educationally it was sound and desirable. remember, most of the stt1dents here have never experienced such a system, · while the faculty have, if not while teaching at other schools, then certainly d],lring their undergraduate years. Much of tlie st11dentoppositionmay have been \)ecause they were worried about the two hour classes under Gel Time. But, we have a number of such courses now.\ The reasoning behind Gel Time is as follows. Presently, classes meet four (or five) days a week (in the case of mathematics )-this does not leave much time from one class meeting to the next for students to assimilate the haterial and prepare for the· next class. Under tbe new schedule, there will be time between class meetings for students to complete assignments, so that the new material presented will \gel\. There will be two different \slots\ when classes will be held. Some classes will meet Monday, Wednesday, and Friday for 65 minutes and others will meet Tuesday and Thursday for 100 minutes each time. classes will begin at 9 a.m instead of 8:30, and Calculus classes will have a small amount of time added to them. Because of the way that the schedule will work, Tuesday and Thursday morning labs will be available. Wolf conunented, \This is a side benefit. Under the new schedule we will be able to offer seven lab periods a week instead of the present six. This will result in better use of the lab space.\ Another advantage to the new schedule is the Tuesday and Thursday morning block of time from 10:40-12:50 which will not have any classes scheduled during it. This so-called \Common Time\ will be a time during which College com- mittees can meet, and con- voc~tions, speakers, and events such as the Minerva Hour can be held conflict-free. Gel Time will make exam scheduling easier. Another plus is that it will eliminate the problem of courses overlapping with each other. It simply can't happen under the new schedule. Wolf sees few problems with the implementation of Gel Time. \We've operated on our present schedule for 20 years. Thus, at first, Gel Time will require more coordination. There is a certain amount of inertia in any college, which makes change difficult.\ Last year, a dry run of Gel Time was conducted to insure that there was enough classroom space at the right times. \That schedule worked, IISEARCH PAPIRB 16,278 to choo11e from -all subjects Order Catalog Today wtth Vosa/MC or COD 800-351-0222 ; in Calif. 12131477-8226 Or. rush $2.00 io: Research Assistance 113221daho Ave. #205-SN. los Angeles.

Many other institutions have this schedule. Students may end up liking it because it will give them more time to prepare for classes. I hope that people will give it a chance.\ TYPING DOLLARS A gift certificate Buy a gift certificate for a friend. It's worth free typing done for them. $5.00 and up. Call 346- 0344 or Ext. 6130.

Adam and .Rob With · Thoughts on Halloween By ADAM EMERSON Blld ROBBLEIFER This week we've decided to address one of our favorite holidays, Daylight Savings Time. We wrote a really great .. · article on it too, but it was rejected after we were ine formed that it was not a real holiday. Distressed from this news but fortunate to have gained an hour, we had ample time to write on our filth favorite Living • 1n The American Zoo holiday, Halloween. Of course our other three favorites are Flag ·Day, Nixon's Birthday, and Arbor Day (that's Tree Day to you and me). Halloween has been an ex- citing day for all of us since we were kids. Although we're in the prhne of our manhood now (take the hint ladies), we see no reason why we shouldn't be able to relive the ambivalence of our youth once again. So, with fun and frivolity in mind, we've spent the week planning a festive Halloween. We of course plan on beginning the day's festivities with some trick-or- treating with some of our young doid friends. We love going By.MIKEPASQUALE Righteousness. That's all we ever seem to hear from our ever-present politicians. these days. The Democrats always label themselves as the defenders of the poor and weak; Republicans c.onsider. them- ~.Selves_'the la~t bastion of true Americ'ati ideals. Both consider each ·other's position morally untenable. God help us. I think this country is finally going Schizophrenic! . Our friendly neighborhood Democrats are defenders of all that is right and just-and they don't seem to ever let us forget it. It has been quite a while since I haven't heard a · Democratic candidate for any ' ()ffice proclaim him or herself as the good guy and the op- position as the basic bad guy. Yes, he or she always seems to support everybody's rights. He or she is always a feminist, ~ways for equal opportunity, a,lways for the }><lor an~ old and the downtrodden, ·calling ,these · poeple the true base of America's g~eatnesss. Gee, what a nice bunch of guys and gals these Democrats are. They're again:st prayer in school, and think religion should be separate in a pluraliStic society. They believe that the present administration is spending too much money on defense and too much of our soldiers' tilne in areas where we shouldn't be. They say the administration is undermining American principles. I guess these are even \)&triots. Wouldn't George Washington be proud? - Then we have, of course, our friends the Republicans. They decided to choose the elephant for the mascot because, you see, · they never forget. They've never forgotten it was the Democrats who've gotten us into all four wars this century- the Democrats who alwayS tax and tax to support government; it is the Democrats who are undermining American prin- ciples and the Republicans who are preserving it. Sounds familiar, doesn't it? It is the .. Republicans who are right arid just (according to themselves, .of course); because they support big' business; which is the base of American greatness. (Hamilton would love this stuff.) They're for prayer in school because they believe in a pluralistic society, religion should be freely wherever, whenever. Yes Republicans too are believers in s~aration of church and state. They are also patriots beCause they support large defense and the deployment of American forces where and when needed. These guys are American and proud of it-not like those squeamish Demccrats! Where pray tell, is this going to end? I think that we can basically assume that both Democrats or Republicans are righteous (or more accurately, sell-righteous). After all, they both support the base of America's greatness (whatever it is), separation of church and state, and they're definitely patriotic. These guys are mother, apple pie, and baseball all the way-but the question of who's right still remains. Well, you can decide that one · for yourself. Personally, I'm so confused I'm going to see my psychiatrist tomorrow. But before I go, I will say this- wouldn't it be nice if both our high and mighty parties woUld get off their respective high horses and start putting ideals in action for the people instead of yelling at each other? There must be a happy mediwn. If these guys woUld only take the time to look at it, maybe then being righteous wouldn't be so terribly confusing.

She said that he would not compromise his thought and Vision. By ITAL YTEAM ABROAD '86 FLORENCE-Ciao, amtcl. Saluti da Firenze. How's Schenectady? We're having a great time over here and thought we'd wr-ite to rub your noses in it. No, seriously, to all our for· mer friends: thanks for the multitude of letters, we found out the other day that the Florence post office has recently begun construction on a special Union College annex to handle the sudden influx of correspondence. We have been here for three weeks now and we're feeling quite at home in the Renaissance City. We are all eating very well and make hi- daily excursions to Vivoli for ice cream. Howeve ... , there are some exceptions to this: Mary O'Sullivan, Anita McMahon and Chris Telesa were fed a great Italian delicacy called \Russian Salad,\ a dish con· sisting of mayonnaise with a few scattered carrots and hotdogs. Reading Italian menus has proved to be somewhat like playing Russian roulette. You really take your chances when you ordEtr something unknown. Ingrid Koch folllld out that the guessing game can be quite dangerous. One day at Casalinga, she ordered \Zampa otherwise known as boiled pig's trotter:. It looked fresh out of the formaldehyde jar. To top it off, Colleen Quinn increduously reached over to touch it when it atTived at the table just to ''make sure it was real.\ It was. Florence is truly a living museum and the art is magnificent. We are learning a lot about Renaissance art. This learning occurs for two reasons: 1) it's much easier to study a work of art \face to face\ and 2) we've been forced to read not a few books by the professor-in-residence, who shall remain nameless. Majorie Blakel:v spit in the face of this academic terror~ and took off for Oktoberfest on the day before oW' ten p,age \Summer Reading Exam ' in Art History. As it turned out, we all should have gone because mOst of us received disap- pointing grades. Oh, well. Some others here have the \travel bug.·~ Liz Melamed and. Bill Craig have been away from Florence just about as long as they've been llere. Bill left obligated to attend his brother's weddJng· in North Car:olina on the first weekend of the term. Liz, well, she opted for the rainy skies of London-we've yet to find out why. The Florentines are gooli people and tlley have a great deal of patienc~ with non-Italian speaking people like us. Even the pigeons show us signs of affection which they \drop\ all over the place. Amy Rosenthal was the object of one pigeon's such affection as was Lonni Miller. Just like the statues in front of Palazzo Vecchio! On a fashion note: we've discovered the best way not tD look American. You just need to wear sweat outfits with stupid American sayings. Dressed in clothes which read \BOSS\ and \COLD\ and \BEVERLY' InLLS SKI TEAM\ the Italians really know how to sport tbe Ameriean look. The only question we have is ''Where were· we when this was the fashion back home?\ We have actually found the shopping here to be quite suitable to our liking .. As Professor Thomas says, \Union will go anywhere to go shop- ping.\ So, we figured, why not shop where the shopping is best.: a Firenze! Ask Tom RizzD and Tony Corsello, they'll ten you all the great shops to hit. They're the hot new item around here-they've taken to prolonged shopping trips whicii result in matching items of clothing from oxfords to boxer: shorts. Diane Mehta has surprised us all and has turned into quite the little shopper! She may, in fact, single-handedly cause the disappearance of the San Lorenzo mercato. Coming in close second are Rob Uzzo and Rich Rho who were spotted early one morning outside Benetton. waiting for the doors to open. Mary Talarico has learned a new way to bargain with the Italian merchants. She bought a belt last week.for 16,000 lire and two .kisses on. the cheek! And speaking of kisses on the cheek, a waiter in the town of Ravenna took a liking to Saraii Calderini and, as she paid the bill, he gave her a big smack oa the cheek. Her face has also been admired by the \fran- cobollo man'' at the post office. Yes, the Italian men are living up to their reputation and · they certainly .learn young here! Gail Diamond was \goosed\ by two 12-year old boys while walking through the market one day. Wendy Allen took it upon herself to learn the art of grape harvesting. She learned quickly because she had three lDng- haired Italians to teach her I If anyone is interested, she,ll be giving a seminar on \The Subtleties of Wine\ in January. A true Italian Stallion has his . , eyes on Pam Dzikowicz. He calls himself Francesco and does not speak English. Meanwhile,. Pam's Italian is not so good. What's that they say about the \universal language?\ On the flipside, ;Mickey- Bradley is cohabitating with a fish-net stocking clad and tatooed, 35 year old divorcee named. Francesa (his Italian mother). She has been seen riding her moped through the streets of Florence singin~, \Oh Mickey. You're so fine ... ' And, speaking · of mopeds, well, suffice it to say that we're all intact and still alive. And, if you think that unmotorized bikes aren't bad, they are just as bad. Imagine Chris Larsh cruising to school on a bike fully equipped with basket and bell, and the pedestrians are worse still, they're so pushy'. Some mebriated Italian left a memento for LiZ Karazim in the instant photo booth. One late night, while out carousing, Liz stepped into a \technicolor yawn.\ What fun that was! As long as we're talking about drinking, we seniors over here feel compelled to tell our fellow classmates that SENIOR DRUNK CLUB is alive and well and living in Florence. We can· it CIRCLOL LA UREANDI UBRIACH and our preliminary meeting place is the Tabacchi by the Duamo. There you can buy a two liter bottle of wine for five dollars. We were told not to buy any wine that costs Wlder · $1.50. Thank heavens for cheap wine because a beer here is astronomical. (Actually, we've · that shape opinions.' Mrs. Cooney a gray-haired majestic· woman described her husband's quest for peace, freedoiJl, and social justice in the United States and throughout the world and these feelings which stirred his impetus for the creation of The Phoenix. Mrs. Cooney . explained her husband's \life in community; his love for literature.\ James Cooney responded to the voice of D.H. Lawrence. His editorial in 1970 . which reminisced about the begin· nings of the magazine proclaimed Lawre.nce's \furious. stand agai.nst the vileness of conscription and war, his loathing. of politicians and generals, his mockery of dictators and thier debased masses of followers, his revlllsion against private profit and the enslavements of money and his ·exposure of the spreading plight of our automated society illuminated The Phoenix throu~hout its entire earlier course. ' Henry Miller was its European editor; Lawrence's writings ap.peared posthumously and Jean Giono's \The Refusal· to Obey\ was published between 1938-40. Mrs. Cooney explained how her husband strived to produce an \international eclectic, community of self-sufficient artists.\ The focus of The Phoenix was pacifist resistance · to the war and promoted the idea of a conscientious objector. In 1940 the family moved from Woodstock, New York where The Pho.enix was published, to southern Georgia. Mrs. Cooney Continued on page 7 · declared with pride that she The family returned to the North to find a \new ·group of kindred spirit.\ They stood against the Vietnam War and the draft board. The times were ripe again. The · Phoenix reappeared again in 1970 using the same letter press-a Kelly B pur· chased in New Haven for $75. Mrs. Cooney joined the staff at the Smitll College library and . s9me_ of the. students . helped print the_ magazine for its revival editions. Mr. Cooney wrote that the girls proclaimed the motto .of The Phoenix in song: ''Not for our glory, but for thine our Lord.\ Mrs:. Cooney's husband had courage. She ~aid \it's a gift, Jimmy had it/' and that he was a s~bol for temperament of a unitary vision. Finally, Mrs. Cooney told a story of someone that spoke at a memorial service for Mr. Cooney after his death one year ago. It was a man who told of the time when he was a young boy and wanted to build a mechanical horse. Mr. Cooney gave the yoWlg lad a saddle. He thought that anything was possible. Mrs. Cooney, along with the help of Professor Gado, is working to get .the remaining volumes to complete the Schaffer Library collection of The Phoenix. If works published in The Phoenix are a reflection of the lives of the Cooneys, the collection will certainly be worth reading.

CONCORDIENSJS, October 30, 1986 · (llnnrorbitttsis ____ FDfllfllnJ a/. tln1011 0.11~ 1817 ___ ~ The Great Union Smoke-Out \'Over 35 million Americans have qllit smoking for a very good reason. Evidence accumulated in recent years has now proved beyond doubt that what was once considered merely a bad habit is a major threat to the health of this country. Cigarette smokers have 70 percent more heart attacks than nonsmokers. At every age, there are more deaths among cigarette smokers than among nonsmokers. Cigarette .smoking is now as important a cause of death -as the great epidemics of typhoid, cholera, and tuberculosis in the past. ..___ More than 320,000 will die prematurely this year of diseases linked to smoking. That's as many Americans as have been killed in all the wars fought in this centw·y. Worldwide, even the most con- servative estimates of avoidable deaths caused one million a year. And, it Surgeon year from such as deaths be con:s1<1e of the U.S. die this conditions of these As ed is not new to So why don't we person on the staff of and we would like to gi you do smoke: \Listen. In the body and it's your decision. We don't kid by thinking you won't smoke just because we say you shouldn't. But don't kid yourself by smoking just because some friends say you should or becaase y()u think it looks cool. Every cloud may have a silver lining-· but this just doesn't apply when it comes to cigarette smoke.\ Smoking damages your lungs with evecy puff .. And as if that weren't enough, it makes your hands shake; .. your heart work harder, turns your teeth yellow, and fills your· lungs and blood with poisonous carbon monoxide. It polutes you worse than air pollution or smog ever would; and in time, it causes cancer. Even just one cigarette isn't exactly what you would call harmless. Union is a place that educates us. Solet's get smart. We want to wipe cigarette smoking out in our lifetime. *Statistics provided courtesy of the American Cancer Society. Criticizing the Curriculum Many criticisms have been voiced concerning the General Education Curriculum. The purpose of this system is to ensure that Union students receive a well- rounded general education and educational breadth, while maintaining relative course freedom. ~owever, the requirements suggested for this program seem to defeat its purpose. Students will be required to complete a two part history sequence in conjunction with two related literature courses, or a literature and civilization combinationo These three - re- qll!red courses are limited to a s~ecific period in history. Students must complete the two history courses by the end of their second year. Professor Christina Sorwn, who is a member of the Subcouncil on the Curriculum, believes that there will not be a problem with staffing these new classes. She stated that history may get one new tenure position. With approximately 500 Freshman attempting to enter into the three possible history tracks, it seems likely that many students will· be shut out of their desired history. course. Even now students are often shut out of courses they want. This problem will only get worse if more tenure positions are not created. Suppose a student was shut out ()f their history sequence. They would be pressured by the time limit on the history requirement to begin another history sequence. This would force them into following a different, three course sequence. The General Education Cw-riculum is riddled with technical problems. Instead of revolutionizing the cw-riculum, the Colle~e should concentrate on improving the eXisting Liberal Learnin& program. Liberal Learning reqwrements could be enforced, a$Suring that stud.ents 3:ttain a ba~anced education. The credit categories which are destgnated·to classes could be reevaltiated and if necessary, courses could be restructured. These changes would fulfill the ~urp~se of t!te ~~neral educatio~ curriculwn without ilrastically limiting co~se select1on freedom. . . This would also avo1d many of the complicatwns and problems involved ·in introducing a new, un- polished system. • -\ • --~ w-- ~-· .. ---w-·- • ~- -- -- LETTERS Forum Condemns First-Amendment Abuse To the Editor, The Student Forum, in response to a slanderous per- sonal appearing in the October 16 issue of The ConcordJensis, wishes to express its opinion of the matter.

He implied that my focus was skewed, that the real problem was not in Union's un- willingness to release the budget data, but rather was in the indifference of, people, specifically the parents of Union students, to the specifics of the budget. Gulliver's statement that the printing of a lot of ~atistics, as though there was no substance to them or interest in them, would simpJy not be read by our parents or by ourselves smacks of an in- credible ignorance. Gulliver, in defending the school's failure to release the data ~n an upfront way to the entire Union community, rests his case on the saving grace that the letter mailed to our homes was \well written.\ Although the statement frustrates me by its lack of persuasion, I am at least amused that Dave found it necessary to try to convince people that the Vice-President was at least capable of com- posing a letter that people could look at and take pride in the fact that Union chose to emfioy such an able man. I .know do? My biggest gripe with the letter, however, is Gulliver's arparent wafflin. g on the issue o releasing the budget to everyone. He begins by saying that he would like to see the budget printed in Con- cordiensis. He later says that if that is -unacceptable, the Concordlensis staff would be able to preview it and publish selective pieces of the budget. Furthermore he tells us that if we are really, really interested in finding out the specifics of the budget we could talk to the three members of the Planning and Priorities Coiillllittee who have initial input to the budget. All of this is unacceptable and gives too much credit and trllSt to the school. I know that in my town, where peo~le 'P.ay ta:x~s to live there and enjoy 1ts servt<!es, the yearly budget is publlshed in the local paper and becomes a matter for discussion. Here at Union, we pay a tuition, C()n- siderably higher than lccal taxes and deservedly so. Nevertheless, who knows what we are really paying for? If the school has its way, as Dave Gulliver is only two willing to go along with, we will not lle entitled to know how our scb()ol operates. By that ignorance, we are incapable of makin~ sllb- stantive suggestions wdllout individually petitioning ttie Vice-President's office for tllat information. That does nothing for increasing awareness or encouraging input. It stifles tllat process and is unacceptable. I encourage the Concordiensls to take a firm stand, and demand privately and publicly that the budget be printed for the C()D- sumption of all: Sincel\'ely Jason Green'87 Proposed Curriculum Too Narrow To the Editor: \The proposed General Education Curriculum is meant to ensure both a sound general education and educational breadth. To. achieve the first, the students select eleven courses ~rom a specified list of courses; to achieve the second, the students select four courses restricted only by their major and division.\ This is how the new proposal is prefaced and I have some conunents which I hope can add to the discussion. My initial response to the proposal is that it certainly will make pQssible a more c<ilierent education; however, in looking at the History, Civilization and Literature course requirements, I wonder if this pro~sal will achieve-its ~oals. I can t help but think that mstead of creating wen rounded in- vidivuals, students under this new. plan will graduate with a rather limited and narrow understanding of a particUlar period of history, a particular 'culture within that period, and the particular kind of economic~ political and religious thought of that culture within that particular historical period. While such an intense un~ derstanding of .one particular segment or history in mat).y of its aspects may be a beneficial tool in understanding other periods, I am not convinced that this narrowness is consistent with the spirit of a liberal arts education which, at least in my own mind should prov-ide an umbrella . of knowledge, touching, all areas of thought throughout all time. This sounds too idealistic., yet I . think that this new prop()sal fails to ad· dress this. Having studied in Japan, I am disheartened by the proposal's fantare to emphasize the value of the study of Eastern Cultures.

For Bryan, On behalf of his friends on the Union College Soccer team, in dedication of his memory and to the piece of hinl that lives within us all ... While soccer is a chance for all (}{ us to exhibit our special talents that we have acquired over the years, I don't think any of us will argue that it is the feeling of \togetherness\ that exemplifies the uniqueness of playing a team sport. Working together, as a unit, we have strived to achieve our goals, however, through that unity, we have also become friends that we can count on, both on and off the field every day, during pre- season's grueling runs; our daily practices on Garis field, and throughout our regular and past seasons' games-we work as a team, both for ourselves and for each other. That's why, when we first received word of Bl\yan's death, we could do nothing more than weepand remember the joy and happiness that he had given to our personal lives and to the team's character. A piece of our strong link that had held us together all year l()ng would no longer contribute llis warmth, kind-heartedness, skill, and dedication that he had offered throughout his three years of Union College Soccer. Both on and off the field, Bryan was more than j.ust a ''teammate;.\ he was a friend. A friend that found happiness in life and brought happiness to those who ·encountered his presence. While it is now apparent that Bryan can no longer physically be present with us at ever-y moment-through every practice and every game-it is this memory that will flourish within the hearts and nrinds of us all. And, with that :reflecticJn of Bryan, present within o11r unit, we will gain more strength and more \togetherness\ than ever before. Thus, we chose not to ponder on Bryan's death, for that is not the way to thank him for all tb.e joy he has given us. Ratlier, we recollect and remember tb.e good times we shared together as a team, with Bryan as part of that team. The endless days of pre-season practice, fighting for the good shower in the locker room, the various \fat-ass\ jokes, and who could forget \BAKED POTATOES!\ Eaeh and everyone of us has his own separate memories of Bakes, and that's what's important to remember. He was the happiest that any one individual could be, and although his death is a struggle with reality for all of us, our conunittment to happy memories will help to aid in tb.e pain and suffering confronting all that knew him. And with those memories, the beautiful qualities which Bakes possessed will be magnified to the point in which a piece of Bryan Baker will live within us all. While ongoing jokes are one of the distinct characteristics of this team as a unity, none can be more appropriate than the one that surfaced during this year's pre-season. Often times in the locker room, before games or whenever we were together, same one would ritually start off by saying \whete's Bakes? ... \ Then someane would respond \there he is .... ,\ as Bakes smiled, giggled and smirked, knowing what the next line out of an of his teammates would be ... \Ah shoot, Bakes is here ... Who told Bakes anyway?\ Ironic and unfair as it might seem, while the locker room antics were just a spoof ... Who told Bakes anyway? May his soul rest in peace, and may we all offer our sincerest condolences to his family and loved ones who will miss him dearly. We'll miss him a lot. Sincerely, His friends and teammates of the Union College Soccer team Budget Issue Important to All To the Editor: In his respon5e (Article Misinterpreted) pr-inted in last week's Concordiends, I think that David Gulliver is guilty, not of misinterpretation, but of a weakness in pur5uing what I believe to be an important matter of principle.

Tonko (0-105), gave his analysis of the local economy and some possible ways to improve it. This week. Assemblyman Tonko, who represents parts of Schenectady County as well as Montgomery an.d Schohaire Counties, will discuss his views of both the gubernatorial and . senatorial elections that will take place next Tuesday. Q.) Your district is both urban and rural. Do you feel that Governor Cuon1o will carry the same percentage of the vote across your district, or will he do much better in some places than in others? A.) I think that he should do fairly well throughout the district because my sense is that he has addressed his ad- ministration to serving the needs of a wide cross section of people. In my district, he has helped the dairy farmers by supporting my prompt payment bill. Also, there have been changes in the state's education law con· cerning aid to local school districts. We 11Sed to use only property wealth in detennini.Qg aid to education. Now, we use both income and property values, which has increased the amount of aid received by schoels throughout the 105th district. He is a strong leader. As such, that image affects an voters, whether they live in a rural, suburban, or u1ban setting. All can appreciate having a strong leader as governor. He has constantly t ernpered his gubernatorrial policy with a concem and a sensitivity for improving the quality of life. This is a positi~Ve appeal. Many of his programs have em- phasized fairness, safety, and justice, and this is an important part of his appeal. Q.)

(psilocin changes to psilocybin in the body). Psilo(!ybin and, in smaller quantities, .psilocin have been founci in about ninety mush11~om species, and more are constantly being discove-:red. Several varieties of mushr{)!oms witb ballucinogenic propert1es have been used for centuries by Mexican Indians in religioliS rites and ceremonies. Psilo«!;p-JJoe me:xicana and StrDpbaria cubensis (Psilocybe cUbe11:sis) are probably the most importJlnt; others are Pana.e~lus campanulatus, Panaf3ol~s cyanescens, and Psll<Jcylle semilanceata (known in thE Pacific Northwest as \libeMy caps\). In 1958, our good friend Dr. Albert lloffman who had ,syn- thesized LSD isolated pslloe;ybinand lat-er synthesized it. In pore form psilocybin is a white cxystalline material, . but it may also be distributed in crude mushroom preparations conitn~n in intact dried mushr()!()ms or as- a capsule containing a .powdered material· of ailyeolor. It is usually taken orally- _l,)ut may be injected, and doses :gellerally vary from 4 mg. to 5 mg., although 20-60 mg. is not WlllSUal. Th.e potency of psilocy-bin . li~s som~where betw~n that of rnescaUne and I.SD ~lld the effects may be quite slriJ.ilar to that of l.SD. The sacre-d mUshr()Oms effects normally begin 20-30 minutes after ingestion and the duration ·of action may last from six to twelve hours. Peak effects are usually felt in one hour and include visions, often perceived from great - heights. Physiological effects include increased pulse rate, respiratory rate and body temperature, dilated pupils and elevation of systolic blood pressure. Larger does, 12 mg. or more; can produce dizziness, lightheadedness, abdominal discomfort, numbness of tongue, lips or mouth, nausea, anxiety and shivering. One may feel mentally and physically relax:ed, and sometimes feelings of arutiety or elation may coexist. With larger doses individuals may experience difficulty in thinktng and concentrating, visual distor- tions and other changes in perception. Although very ~imllar t~ LSD, ~he experience 1s sometimes sa1d. to be more .strongly vis~al, less intense, and more euphoric, with fewer panic reactions and less chance of paranoia. Drug users often prefer it, especially in the natural mushroom fonn. · It is difficult to estimat.e how much psilocybin is available to users. Some may be. extrac- ted from mushrooms for street sale an~ some may _'be synthesized. One should be aware though,. for much of what is sold today as mushrooms is merely commercial shrooms laced with LSD or PCP.

Science Quickies By STEVE KONLIAN Every now and then we are able to find a development in the world of science that is . actually interesting to the average per$on. Since this week is Halloween, a traditJonal American holiday, I thought that as a little treat from me to you, I woUld list a ntunber of interesting discoveries recently uncovered in the scientific realm. ' 1) According to Emory University researchers, a Georgia man with heart disease played scientist for a day. He had noticed that the nitrate skin patches that he was wearing on his chest to control heart pain · gave him a .headache, a kriown side effect of the drug. However, he noticed that his head didn't ache if he wore the patch on his leg. So, to go a step ' further, the man rubbed a used patch on his penis and. within five minutes he became sexually aroused and had sex:ual intercourse with his wife. Several minutes later she reported that she had \the worst headache of her life.\ TWo conclusions about topical nitrates were drawn from this case: 1) they have an ability to induce vasodilation and resulting erection, and 2) they are absorbed through the mucous membranes of the vaginal wall$. 2) Have you heard the saying, 'c Almost everything today causes cancer\? Well, you can. add various Jn,olds to the list. More specifically, the · mold FUSARIUM found in corn- . bread, millet, and wheat flour has been linked to a high in· cidence of esopageal cancer. The area of study was several regions of the People's Republic of <lUna. ~earchers found that the FUSARIUM strains conunonly foWld in the re~ion's food, can convert nitrates m the local water supply and com- poundS in the food staples into nitrosamine precursors. Most nitrosamines are potent car- sinogens, especially in animals. 3) Cysticercosis is a disease caused by eating the eggs or larvae of the pork tapewonn (Taenia sollum). Though rare in the United States, globally it is the most common parasitic disease affecting the central nervous system, even inducing a form of epilepsy. However, researchers recently reported a simple method for killing and T. . soluim in commercial cuts of pork: storage of the meat for four days at minus five degrees celsius, or for minus twenty- four degrees for a single day. 4) According to researchers associated with the National Eye I:nstitute, using lasers on the eyEs of diabetics with masc;ular edema, a swelling of the key- focusing area of the ' retina, canprevent a significant loss of vision in 200,000 Amerii.can.s in the next five yeal.\s. Lasers are already used in diabetic retinopathy to destro:y tbe abnonnal blood vessel:; t:bat gr-ow over the retina~ The new research ex- tends ille benefits of lasers to vessel growth in the macula. TheF'e is such a. great wealth of titllllating topics that I could grace ::,V()U witll but I think that the oonanza above is enough for any H:alloween. One last fun fact: r:nak.e sure you check all your ca11dy 'When you come back frcm trick-or-treating. Look fo--x odorous chemicals, vari()ll!l fungi, and unusually shapEcl cashews.

ByCONCER.TCOMMITrEE This Mollday, November 3, Memorial Chapel will be filled with the c:ool, folk-rock sounds of Suzanne Vega. This is the second time that Ms. Vega will be performillg in tne area as she was at R.P.I. last winter and sold ()Ut in a matter of hours. She is t()uring to support her self-titled album which has been extremely well received by criti~s and music af- ficionados alike. To get an idea of what she is all about, con- sider the follcwing quote from Robert Llo1d oi the L.A. Weekly: \Think of the best moments of Paul .Simon, rell- dered b:y Laurie Anderson crossed with Terre Roche and you are ne>t .far out of the neigh- borho()d. ,., Her lyrics tell stories and she, at times, seems to act more like a poet than a singer. Ms. Vega's lyrics are like Bob Dylan's when Dylan was still strummming an acoustic guitar. They are sharp, concise words that, although the listener can follow along with the story, there still remains a lot to be left to the imagination. Suzanne Vega has been well received throughout her tour and no doubt will be well received here. · She ·will be perfonning material from her forthcoming albwn as well as, hoepfully, the song which was on the 'Pretty in Pink' sound- track, Left of Center. No doubt that those who at- tend this show on Monday will enjoy one of the musical ex- periences of a lifetime. Warming up for .Suzanne will be Artie Traum, a solo acoutstic guitarist whose new . album, Cayenne, is billed as \spicy new music for acoustic guiiar\. His work on the guitar combines traditional classical and Latin roots with an interesting \fusionistic\ style to produce what has accurately be~n defined as \Spicey\. Although he makes extensive use of a backup band on his albwn, he will appear solo as the warmup for Miss Vega. He has demonstrated excellent technical ability with the guitar on his album, and even without a backup band, he should be able to provide what will surely .be an enjoyable acoustic music experience. Tickets for the concert, which will be held at Memorial Chapel, are on sale now-at. the Union College box office. Ticket prices are $4.00 for students and faculty and $6.00 for the general public. Doors will open at 7·: 00 p.m. with Mr. Traum taking the stage around 7:30 p.m .. Preview of Crimes of the Heart Mountebanks ByJOYCYBUL The performing arts group at Union, the Mountebanks, will be presenting the play \Crimes of the Heart\ by Beth Henley and directed by Mary Boone, in the Nott Memorial Theater on October 30 and November 1, 4, G, 7, and 8. · The olay consists of ·six performers: Claire Cousineaue, Kerrie Ticknor, Jessica Adelson, Robin Thompson, Meserve Platt, and Steven Brown. Respectively, they portray the characters Lenny Macgrath, Meg Macgrath, Babe Botrell, Chick Boyles, Doc Porter, and Barnett Lloyd. Cabaret By JENNIFER ASH Slld LEE ANN SCHMIDT Entering Old Chapel last Thursday- night we felt excited by the prospect of a different form CJf Cabaret entertainment. Dave Prl()vost and his guitar were not on stage, instead Cabaret was hosting the final perf~rmance of \Scenes in Motl()n\ by the Mountebanks Traveling Groupe. The purpose of this innovative travelmg troupe is to \bring the Nott to you\ anci strip up enthusiasm for the tbeatre arts. Fourteen members of the cast were nEw to Mountebanks whicli would seem to indicate that interest in theatre arts is experiellcing a revival at Union. The Mountebanks Troupe performEd five short skits for a well-attended and enthusiastic audience. ''Blolldes'', the first skit, depicted a boy . meets girl situatioll. Thls dialogue lacked the th()ught provoking quality of the latter skits. \Blondes\ was fonowed by an excerpt fmm Plaza Sllite by Neil Sim?n· Both Michael Hiller and Katte Bo)ld; who played the parts of Sam and Karen Nash, ~ave superb performances. Thell' teamw<?rk enric:hecl the dialogue, ~llowl!lg tlle audience to empathize With their pei'S()nal coDfUc.ts. The mood chmged abrup~y wlth l>raculats dramat1c lllgbt tbrou,gh the audience wbiClh Wlbered in -the· skit \Count Dracula\ by Woody Allen. Jonathan Gerstman's convincing bat-like movements and co:rtlic timing filled the audience with laughter. On a more serious note, the next skit, \Tell Me Another Story\ by Jean Lennox Toddie, dealt with the progression of a mother-daughter relationship. The stage direction of this play enhanced its meaning. The interaction of the actors, Olivia Listzw an and Leslie Shamil2adeh, and the division on the set, the wall, created an effective atmosphere. The .final skit was an excerpt from another Woody Allen work, \Mr. Big\ end involved ''one man's search for the all- powerful .being.\ Overall, the evening was a success. The enthusiasm of the cast indicated that we can look forward to a year of positive exposure to the theatre .arts at Union. Crimes of the Heart Mountebank$ Technical Crew By LIZ SEWARD As anyone who has recently been paying attention knows, Momttebanks is just about to begin performances of Beth Henley's play, Crimes of the Heart. Anit, while you are ap- plauding the performances of those on stage, give a hand to the people behindthe scene. For the people backstage are the glue holding the entire production together. The technical crew is in· volved in all aspects of the show and its performance. Crew people have control over lighting, making sure .sound levels are consistent all over the theatre, controlling any necessary sound effects and building, moving and main- taining the set. Yet there is even more beyond this. Other people in the crew are involved in costuming, make-up, finding any nec~ssary props . nDt already possessed by Mouns tebanks and controlling the timing of the production. The latter falls under the jurisdiction of the stage manager, a member of Mountebanks with back-stage. experlence and enough will to keep people mder control when something goes wrong. The plot revolves around the changes in the lives of three sisters over a period of a few days after a terrible tragedy occurs for one of them. Each of the sisters grows and learns more about herself from the other two. Claire Cousineau (Lenny) says, ''I really enjoyed working with the people-they're all very talented, and this should be an excellent show. It's definitely worth coming out to see!\ Tickets went on sale Monday, October 27, at the Nott Memorial Box Office. They can be purchased. . at any time during the day,.nd cost $3.00 for students, $4.00 for faculty and $5.00 for adults. On all per- formance days, the curtain will rise at 8:00 p.m. So, come on out! goes wrong. Anyone interested in working backstage during a production, or just interested in Moun• tebanks should contact Claire Cousineau at 384-4093, or just drop by the Nott and see who's around. Crimes of the Heart will be performed at the Nott October 30 and 31, and November 1, 4, and 6-8. Be sure to mark your calendars and remember the people who made · it all possi~le-the teclmical crew.

Cabaret By JENNIFER ASH and LEE ANN SCHMIDT Entering Old Chapel last Thursday night we felt excited by the prospect of a different form of Cabaret entertainment. Dave Provost and his guitar were not on stage, instead Cabaret was hosting the final performance of \Scenes in Motion\ by the Mountebanks Traveling Groupe. The purpose of this innovative travelmg troupe is to \bring the Nott to you\ and strip up enthusiasm for the theatre arts. Fourteen members of the cast were new to Mountebanks which would seem to indicate that interest in theatre arts is experiencing a revival at Union. The Mountebanks Troupe performed five short skits for a well-attended and enthusiastic audience. \Blondes\, the first skit, depicted a boy meets girl situation. This dialogue lacked the thought provoking quality of the latter skits. \Blondes\ was followed by an excerpt from Plaza Suite by Neil Simon. Both Michael Hiller and Katie Boyd, who played the parts of Sam and Karen Nash, gave superb performances. Their teamwork enriched the dialogue, allowing the audience to empathize with their personal conflicts. The mood changed abruptly with Dracula's dramatic flight through the audience wbich ushered in the skit \Count Dracula'' by Woody Allen. Jonathan Gerstman's convincing bat-like movements and comic timing filled the audience with laughter.

' ., i .t l l l Jan and Buddy at the Movies Buddy and I ·were not able to attend the movies this week. Instead we sat back and Feflected on our many pilgrimages to the theaters of the Capital Region. Our thoughts led us fo for:mulate an assessment of the Capital Region's theater options. Let us exannble each entertainflnent establishment according· to proximity. We will begin with the HeUman Theater which is located directly across from the SUNY-Albany campus on Washington Avenue. This to me is a long way to dtive just for the movies. Of course~ I do it considering the pricE) is sup. .posed to be two dollars for students at all times.. The reason I question the lieiJnlan's pricing policy is that I just happened to venture· there the evening the price was jacked up to five dollars per person .. This night was a premiere opening therefore my five dollars en- titled me to unlimited crackers $nd cheese (much like: the ones I received at West dining hall freshman year on the nights when they pulled out the tablecloths) and a 25-minute delay to the movies' start. lt is unfair of me to criticize the HellmanJ'ust because I decided to atten on the night of a benefit. Anyway, the popcorn at the Hellman is quite good and the clientele amiable. Last · week's Metroland mentioned that there are rumors that the Hellman might be converted into a SUNY A dorm. Next on my list is Crossgates Cin~m.~ J~ ... J: r~~l~z,~ tJ],a.t\ Crossgates l5 ·not Ii;lli~n closer than the Helhnan, but con., sidering my driver constantly misses the correct turn to the· Hellman, Crossgates .is quite a shorter journey for me .. The fee for a movie at Crossgates .is $3.50 for students at all times except matinees. A key at- tribute of Crossgates is their Sweetheart Special-five dollars for a large PQpcom and two large sodas. You actually only save fifty cents though the word \special\ ma)tes you feel as if you're .saving a bundle. I recommend ·this theater because it's clean and has a wide selection of films at varying times. On weekends it iS crucial to purchase your tickets in advance due to the crowds. One major drawback of the late show is if you arrive early to buy.tiekets, the rest of the mall is closed. Crossgates. is a nice mall though it does not warrant enter.taining Wina dowshopping, in other words, it is no Fifth Avenue. Cine 1.;&, located where the Northway meets Route 5 is an enjoyable place to view a movies. This theater is coma fortable and also has bargain rates for students. Cine 1-8 is in a great location because it is directly across from Macy's and right next to another smaller mall. The cinema is not connected to the maU which is a nice way to avoid the people wh,o· feel compelled to hang out there 24 hotlrs a day. The popcorn here is mediocre. It is said that come December, C~e 1-8 will t1lrn into Cine 1-10, tl1erefore, we can loo~ forward to a large sel~ction of films without having to always go to crossgates. . . _Despite the time or day, the price at Cinema 7, located on· Route 7, is always a dollar. I have never been there when there were more than 12 other people in the theater. Hence, if you desire privacy, for a cheap price, this is the place to go. The movies are often a little out- dated. If you misaed that movie that looked kind of ridiculous but you still want to-view it-:ju.st wait-it wUI play at Cinema 7. Let US not forget the worlda renowned Mohawk Mall Cinema·. Last year, during their period of construction, one was faced- with the challenge of finding the. entrance and then finding the correct cinema tb,r()~gh a rn~.ze ~f h,a:Uways. Well~ that 'is aU in · the · past because now Mohawk is all renovated and shows seven films daily. What makes this cinema so attractive to the Union College student? Well, Mohawk is not far fr.om campus and every Tuesday until June is dollar night. The early show on dollar night is W!ually quite crowded. If you have qualms about sharing. your popcorn with people irl black Twisted Sister tee-shirts and synthetic leather vests, then I advise that you hold off to the late show. On a regular night the price is around $4.50. Of course, the movie viewer's closest option is the Social Science building Tuesday, Friday or Saturday night. The price. is always one dollar. But Dad ... No One Writes Like That Any.more By DAWN CHUPAY Notes in the Octavo Singers' program revealed that the fact that much of Johann Sebastian Bach's music was lost because his sons thought it was too outdated to preserve. Perhaps after considering the elder Bach's fame today as a great composer, one might hesitate to throw out Dad's old socks or jackets. Somethings must seem to gain ·value with age. The Octavo Singers performed both the father and son Bachs' works ·last Suhday in Memorial Chapel. The group consisted of 76 singers under the direction of George G. Moross. Many of its members are music educators, music students, or professional musicians. The high degree of talent in the group was evident as they performed J.S. Bach's ueantata No, \ and Carl Phillip Emmanuel . Bach's \Magnificat\. The per~ fonnance included a variety of solo and choral .parts. The featured professional soloists were outstanding in their knowledge of the music's style. Their voices were clear and not overdone· with opera-like quality. Also included in the program were sever~l pieces written for harpsichord and organ. If you think writing intricate Bach melodies and counter melodies is difficult, try writin~ them for two keyboards! Umon's own professor of mUsic, Hugh Allen Wilson, performed these pieces witli the Octavio's organist, Elinore Farnum. The duo displayed tremendous . teclmique while complementing each other very well. At the conclusion of the two-- and-a-halfmhour concert, the audience had been saturated with the uplifting church music composed by the Bachs.

Slides of paintings from the high renaissance were the highlights of the lecture.

This canvas is called the \picture plane\ and is analagous with the human mind. This analogy comes about by the possibilities f!lr distinction and differentiation.

The per· spective drawing's vanishing point represents infinity; in this painting, Christ's head lies on the vanishing point, and so it represents the infinite center of the universe.

Jan and Buddy at the Movies Buddy and I were not able to attend the movies this week. Instead we sat back and reflected on our many pilgrimages to the theaters of the Capital Region. Otu· thoughts led us fo formulate an assessment of the Capital Region's theater options. Let us examine each entertainment establishment according to proximity. We will begin with the Hellman Theater which is located directly across from the SUNY -Albany campus on Washington Avenue. This to me is a long way to drive just for the movies. Of course, I do it considering the price is sup- posed to be two dollars for students at all times. The reason I question the Hellman's pricing policy is that I just happened to venture there the evening the price was jacked up to five dollars per person. This night was a premiere opening therefore my five dollars en- titled me to unlimited crackers and cheese (much like the ones I received at West dining hall freshman year on the nights when they pulled out the tablecloths) and a 25-minute delay to the movies' start. It is unfair of me to criticize the Hellman just because I decided to attend on the night of a benefit. Anyway, the popcorn at the Hellman is quite good and the clientele amiable. Last week's Metroland mentioned that there are rumors that the Hellman might be converted into a SUNY A donn. Next on my list is Crossgates Cinema 12. I realize that Crossgates is not much closer than the Hellinan, but con- sidering my driver constantly misses the correct turn to the Hellman, Crossgates is quite a shorter journey for me. The fee for a movie at Crossgates is $3.50 for students at all times except matinees. A key at- tribute of Crossgates is their Sweetheart Special-five dollars for a large popcorn and two large sodas. You actually only save fifty cents though the word \special\ makes you feel as if you're saving a bundle. I recommend ·this theater because it's clean and has a wide selection of films at varying times. On weekends it is crucial to purchase your tickets in advance due to the crowds. One major drawback of the late show is if you arrive early to buy tickets, the rest of the mall is closed. Crossgates is a nice mall though it does not warrant entertaining win· dowshopping, in other words, it is no Fifth Avenue. Cine 1-8, located where the Northway meets Route 5 is an enjoyable place to view a movies. This theater is com- fortable and also has bargain rates for students. Cine 1-8 is in a great location because it is directly across from Macy's and right next to another smaller mall. The cinema is not connected to the mall which is a nice way to avoid the people who feel compelled to hang out there 24 hours a da3l. The popcorn here is mediocre. It is said that come December, Cine 1-8 will turn into Cine 1-10, therefore, we can look forward to a large selection of films without having to always go to Crossgates. Despite the time or day, the price at Cinema 7, located on Route 7, is always a dollar. I have never been there when there were more than 12 other people in the theater. Hence, if you desire privacy, for a cheap price, this is the place to go. The movies are often a little out- dated. If you missed that movie that looked kind of ridiculous but you still want to view it-just wait-it will play at Cinema 7. Let us not forget the world~ renowned Mohawk Mall Cinema. Last year, during their period of construction, one was faced with the challenge of finding the entrance and then finding the correct cinema through a maze of hallways. Well, that is all in the past because now Mohawk is all renovated and shows seven films daily. What makes this cinema so attractive to the Union College student? Well, Mohawk is not far from campus and every Tuesday until June is dollar night. The early show on dollar night is usually quite crowded. If you have qualms about sharing your popcorn with people in black Twisted Sister tee-shirts and synthetic leather vests, then I advise that you hold off to the late show. On a regular night the price is around $4.50. Of course, the movie viewer's closest option is the Social Science building Tuesday, Friday or Saturday night. The price is always one dollar. But Dad ... No One Writes Like That Anymore ByDAWNCHUPAY Notes in the Octavo Singers' program revealed that the fact that much of Johann Sebastian Bach's music was lost because his sons thought it was too outdated to preserve. Perhaps after considering the elder Bach's fame today as a great composer, one might hesitate to throw out Dad's old socks or jackets. Some things must seem to gain ·value with age. The Octavo Singers performed both the father and son Bachs' works last Sunday in Memorial Chapel. The group consisted of 76 singers under the direction of George G. Moross. Many of its members are music educators, music students, or professional musicians. The high degree of talent in the group was evident as they performed J.S. Bach's \Cantata No.\ and Carl Phillip Emmanuel Bach's ''Magnificat\. The per- formance included a variety of solo and choral parts. The featlll\ed professional soloists were outstanding in their knowledge of the music's style. Their voices were clear and not overdone with opera-like quality. Also included in the program were several pieces written for harpsichord and organ. lf you think writing intricate Bach melodies and counter melodies is difficult, try writin~ them for two keyboards! Umon's own professor of music, Hugh Allen Wilson, performed these pieces with the Octavio's organist, Elinore Farnum. The duo displayed tremendous technique while complementing each other very well. At the conclusion of the two- and-a-half-hour concert, the audience had been saturated with the uplifting church music composed by the Bachs. The concert ended in a rousing choral performance of Gloria Patri from \Magnificat\. If the walls of the Chapel are still standing, it might be nice to consider seeing this group when they return in the Spring.

The English Concert was fonned by Trevor Pinnock in 1973. It has toured throughout Britain, Australia and Europe. The Union College show is (a unique one, since the program being performed here is only being performed at one other stop in the American tour.) The English Concert's goal is to recreate Baroque music in all its splendor. To this end, the thirteen string players use replicas of authentic period instruments and were trained in the baroque bowing style. A recording of the complete or- chestral works of Handel and Bach was released by the English Concert in 1984. In 1988, Mr. Pinnock will make his debut at the Met, conducting a Handel opera. Trevor Pinnock, a foWlder of the Concert, is an acclaimed harpsichordist. Local audiences had the opportunity to see him perform this summer at Tanglewood. Simon Standage is the principal violinist and a founder of the group as well as being a professor of Baroque music at the Royal Academy of Music.

Starting pWlctually a~ 8:00 p.m., the Elektric Band played a short but_ very impressive set, going from fast fusion to slow ballads. Throughout the set each band member took turns at solos, that were recognized by the audience with the hearty ap- plause. The Elektric Band's extensive use of synthesizers and electronic instruments enhanced their fre&form fusion style. The Chick Corea Elektric Band put on a very impressive show, and should be watched for in the future. . Spyro Gyra took the stage at 9:30 and played a strong a~ hour set. Continuing on their Breakout tour which started at Union College last May 31 (Camp Union), the band has added more to their stage show. Since the last time these two reviewers saw the band, they have implemented the use of fog machines, black lights, and motorized lights, all con- tributing to a new stage presence. Starting with the song Double Take, Jay Beckenstein came out and. played a short saxaphone solo after which the rest of the band joined in. They then played Incognito, a very progressive song off the album of the same name. Tom Schuman, the keyboardist, then took center stage to perform his song, \Schu Blues,\ which had the band and the audience clapping with en- thusiasm. The band also played classics such as Catching the Sun and Morning Dance.

A -Menage A Tour - Guthrie, Bromberg & Sebastian by JAY M.GROSSMAN The place: the Palace Theater in Albany The event: Arlo Guthrie, David Bromberg and John Sebastian A nearly sold out crowd was treated to a special evening as the menage a tour (asSebastian described them) performed for almost three hours. Whether they performed individually or together Guthrie, Bromberg, and Sebastian brought the crowd to its feet several ilines during the performance. If you were a 50-year old fan of Guthrie's father Woody, or a 16- year-old high school student from Linton, this show was .for you. Furthermore, unlike many major rock concerts today, the three '60s holdovers had a message for their audience: to live ·life, think about music, condemn the actions of those in South Africa, and that we should not tum the war on drugs into a witch hunt. Sebastian, the most re- spectable in appearance of the three in pin-striped jeans and a cotton shirt, opened .the con- cert with the theme song to the hit TV series \Welcome Back Kotter.' Sebastian originally perfonned this song for the show. He appeared ori stage · · 'th hi · ust' 't smgmg WI s aco .... _lc gw_ar, which was hooked up to an amplifier. Sebastian followed with \Nashville Cats\ an upbeat coWltry-western tune which enlivened the crowd. Sebastian's strong points were his quips . in between songs. He told about life on Bleecker and MacDou:gal: Streets in the Village with Arlo and David and of the influences of Sam Hopkins and Mississippi John on his music. Sebastian then switched to his electric guitar for \Snowbound a song dedicated to the winters of Albany and ''Jug Band Music.\ He returned to his acoustic guitar for \Lovin' Spoonful,\ \Sporting Life,\ an audience request, and finished with \What A Day for A Daydream,\ which he proclaimed that \Somebody paid to hear this tWle.\ David Bromberg excited the crowd when he came out wearing his .leather jacket, glasses and beard and per- formed \Anytime You Warma Leave, Get Up and Go.\ Bromberg played one more solo tune called \Dying Crap- shooter's Blues,\ and then invited Guthrie and Sebastian on stage for ''Beer Parlors on Main Street.\ Guthrie played keyboards and Sebastian was on harmonica. Bromberg's style wa;; much like a gospel singer wh.~se voice could be heard in the back row and played his guitar at 78 rpms. His guitar picking was done with fervor an<l one cannot imagine how he did not break a few strings during the perfonnance. \Midnight Hour Blues\ featured the three stars of the performance in solo pieces which showed the musical talents (){ each of them. Bromberg's final two songs, \Sharon\ and \Testify 'bout My Lov~\ were his · best. \Sharon'• was an upbeat, energizing song in which Bromber,g's talents were maximized. Bromberg's voice is strong lllld in this song about a girl who is wanted by everyone in the audience inft eluding Bromberg, he plays chords which sould like the girl who is wlrlning for him.

The viewers ranged from screaming teenie- boppers to grandparents with a majority .of the audience falling in the middle, yet all dancing and singing. All in all, it was great to see that bands like this are still around and that Chicago is continuing their classic sounds that we are all so familiar with as they promote their newest album \Chicago 18.\ 1/'J .,_ 1/'J ..... I.. <( >- +- Q) I.. ro > - 0 Singer Arlo Guthr1e supported by Bob Williams on guitar, J eJ;rY Olivery on drums, Danny Felinka on bas~, and Abe Guthrie, his son an<! a third generation performer on the synthesizer. Guthrie then played \City of New Orleans,\ a classic of his whicb has been performed by ma11y others. Arlo was on acoustic guitar for that song and he now was front stage center. In a family tradition, Guthrie o11ce again became the great storyteller. He sang about when America was first discovered, men such as Rubin Clamso had to sing songs to keep themselves from being eaten by gillllt claws. Guthrie made the audience join in on this fairy tale as he sang with a \clampoon\ in hand. The song was creative anc:l silly, but it seems that GutiHie might have thought this ~ne while engaging in some illicit drugs. The storyteller then proceeded to tell of the time wllen he was on drugs and flyin~ into Los Angeles only to be met by a narcotics agent at th<l gate. He segued the story into ••coming Into Los Angeles\ another crowd favorite. Guthrie proclaimed that we should not come into an age when \a kid was put into jail for having a joint in his pocket.\ Bromberg then returned to join Guthrie on stage for \Gates of Eden\ and \Last Train to Glory.\ Guthrie finished up with his father's classic \This Land is Our Land'• which he joked that he had learned in the sixth grade. The crowd enjoyed this song more than any other and it was augmented tremendously by the fact that Guthrie added his own verse dedicated to the people of S<>uth Africa. For his encore Guthrie Rlayed \All Over The World and \Am82ing Grace\ to which he added a verse that said \We must learn to live like friends and bombs should never fall.\ \Amazing Grace,'' Guthrie said, was written by John Newt()n, a slave ship captain who decided to turn around his ship that was full of slaves heading for America. The show sas very en- tertaining and since the three men. tour frequently it is one that perhaps everyone would want to see.

THE ARTS Kee~plng Up w1t·h the Jones' One To One • • • By JULIE STEINBERG Howard Jones once 'again proves his mu~Jical ingenuity with his latest albwn, One To One. On this third albwn Jones continues to delight his listening audience with his advanced style of music and lyrics. One To One shows how he bas added a \funky\ style to his already known musical genius. Similar to that of Human Lib and Dream Into Action, lloward Jones' creative talent gives him the ability to write both the music and the 'lyrics for One To One as well. Jones expresses ideas that are qllite realistic. to the listener: love, desire, destiny, and eqlllllly as real, the feelings o'f loneliness and violence. In \Don't Want To Fight Any More,'' Howard Jones makes a direct statement for peace as his lines prove: \Don't want to fight any more, don't want to cry any more ... one nation, .one family, no limitation, 110 enemy ... \ His third album also shows Jones \stealing the show\ as he once ~gain practically siglls and plays all instruments without outside assistance. But Jones seems .far from self-centered as he includes some of the hottest namef! in the music industry to accompany him: Nile Rodgers on guitar, Steve Ferrone on drums, Martin Jones on bass, and backup vocals by Afr()diziak. One To One like Human's Ub and Dream mto Action is available on Elektra records. The first single off the album is entitled \You know I Love You ... Don't You.\ Schenectady Symphony Orchestra Begins Another Season ·By EDLIN The Mets and Red Sox; were playing game No. 6 but the Schenectady Symphony Orchestra went on to open their season last Saturday with a program to please every taste. Credit should be g,iven to Charles Schneider, who became the symphony's music director in 1981. This semi-professional or- chestra has improved tremendously under Mr. Schneider, who is also music director of the Catskill and Utica Symphonies. The brass and especially the woodwinds sounded exceptionally keen although the strings could have used a bit of tidying up. The question is., where were the Union students who were not watching the game or at a party? The evening's program opene'd with George Handel's often overplayed :work, the Royal Fireworks Music .. Mr. Schneider took this neo- classical piece at a tempo which the musicians found com- fortable and the audience found refreshing. There was good distinction stylistically between the movements of the piece and Mr. Schneider demonstrated cool control at every moment. Perhaps the highlight of the evening· was Findlay CQckrell playing Geor;ge Gershwin's Piano Concerto in F. This dif- ~icult and sonJ,ewhat jazzy piece m a concerto fonn really had the audience's attention in a tight grip. Mr. Cockrell played from memory and took on the many diffic11lt passages with ease while keeping in style with the music; there was a constant sense of eKcitement. The trumpet sol() in the second movement sollllded uneasy and at times soUllded as if. it were going to fall apart. The trum- peter is usually a good player but I guess n..er:vousness got the better of him. Nevertheless, the winds were exceptionally neat and it would ile a pleasure to hear them play their passages again. The orchestra and conductor proved to be a good complement t<> Mr. Cockrell's superb playillg; . The evening concluded with the Second Symphony of Alexander BCJrodin, the Russian chemist. Tills was somewhat new to the audience who were probably more accustomed to Beethoven, M()zart and Braluns but it was a fantastic work full of melodies, drama, moodiness and energy. The orchestra carried their role very nicely although one might wish for a more convincing performance or more attention paid to in- tricate details of the piece such as tone qaality and in· terpretation. The violins were good but were a little sloppy and inarticUlate at a few passages. They are all good players but it does little good when they do not play the same way all the time. I think all they need is some diseipline to rescue them from the torment of overly scrupulous critics. Needless to say, the brass and winds played very well. The audience, however, could have showed more enthusiasm. It was amusing how everyone sat quietly, not knowing that the Boroclin had ended until the conductor asked the musicians to stand. It does wonders for musicians to know that they a:re appreciated and that they are playing for an enthusiastic audience. In many ways, it helps the musicians in being mor-e attentive in their per- formance. The orchestra could use more publicity on campus and the coDege community are fo.f- tunate to have an ensemble like this at such availability. There were only two Union students in the audience (it's not hard to spot them in a small crowd) and both unreservedly enjoyed the performance. three more concerts will follow in the season and the programs promises to be fun-featuring great solo artists-·certainly worthwhile! Music of Japan In a short recital of Japanese music. will take place next Wednesday afternoon in Milano Lounge. Ronnie . Nyogetsu Seldin will play the haunting, meditative, solo music of the Zen ~radition called honkyoku. · He will talk about the music and play tbe shakubachl, a vertical bamboo flute.

The concert is co- sponsored by the Arts Depart- ment, Phi Beta Kappa, and the Study and Meditation Group of Union College. All are welcome .

CONCORDl£NSIS, Qc_toher 30, 1986 Page 19 Athlete of the Week By DOUGLAS LLOYD Co-winners of the ''Athlete of the Week~' are appropriate this week as bothMike VanHorn and Ryan Mason played key roles in Saturday's narrow vvin over Williams in football. The final score, 2!).-16, came about from some key defensive plays by Van Hom and some fantastic rlliming by Mason. Mike VanHorn, a sophomore defensive tackle, made the key play of the game as he .blo~ked an attempted quick-k1ck and then fell on the ball for Union's • a • IIOW J J.J .• J first points of the ga~e, cutting the Ephmen lead to 10.7, after the extra point. Besides making this key play, Mike was in, on 13 tackles for the Dutchmen. Mike, at 6'3~' and 235 lbs., majors in biology and hails from Rochester, NY, where he pl~:~y:ed at Brighton H.S. Ryan Mason, a freshman fullback from Wayne, NJ, ran :right through the Williams defense for his first collegiate 1M-plus yards game: Ryan amassed 109 Yards on just 12 (!arries for Union for an average of nine yards a ca~y, inc~uding Soccer. Superiority Continues By RICH GOLDMAN The Union Men's soccei\team played last Saturday and Monday and won both games. On Saturday, tile team beat the University of Rochester whq was ranked fifth in the New York region with an 11-2 record and who was one of Union's tougher opponents. The final score was 2-0. . The first half was evenly .played and the shots were limited by both teams. The score at half-time was 0-0. ~ Union dominated hf the s~coiid half. The first goal was scored by Jim Monks and was assisted by Rich Engdahl with 31:41 remaining in the game. Engdahl kicked a long ball off a direct kick from midfield. Jim Monks ran on to it in front and kicked it in past the goalie who was coming out to cut dwon the angle. The second goal w~s scored by Steve Hartman, hiS Crandall who scored. Crandall scored another one with 3 :42left in the half assisted by Steve Hartman as Crandall ran on to a pass by Hartman. After one half, the score was 3-0., In the second half, Union got two quick goals 20 seconds apart. Vassar put another one in their own net, 4:30 into the half as the ball bounced around in front. Crandall then finished the scoring by completing his hat trick With under five minutes left in the game. Wilk assisted on tlle goal as Crandall knocked ID ~ ~~Qollfld off a Wilk shot. Union out shot Vassar, 38-3. Jon LaDuke and AI Tragasar combined for Union's fifth shut out in a row and ninth win in a row. In the last five games, Union has outscored its op- ponents 21-o. The team has three more games left, all on the road. The playoff selections are announced this corn1ng Monday. If the team keeps winning,· they will still be playing soccer after this week. one run for 38 yards. Ryan also · ran for his first colleglate touchdown en 1:oute to Union's seventh win in seven games. Ryan {6'1\ 225 lbs.) attended Wayne HiJls High School and looks like he has a place in the offensive back:field for the Dutchmen for a few more seasons. The outstanding play of both Mike VanHorn and Ryan Mason made it an easy ,choice for co- award winners and each should be congratulated for their job well done in tile tough win over Williams. Flanigan and Cole Continued from. page 20 their victory, the team bus broke down on the Northway and there Todd and Curt slept through the night. They had to cancel their game and take a fine but it wasn't that bad, they escaped the dreaded 12 hour trip for a.t leasta week or: two. The Slapshots play 56 total games including 28 hom~ games at the RPI Fieldhouse m Troy. The tickets for a game are $7 and their next home game is tonight at 7: 30 t>;m. as Slapshots hosts the Carolina Thun- derbirds of Winston-Salem, North Carolina.. As of now the . league consists of 5 tellJils: Troy Slapshots, Carolina Thun- derbirds, Utica Comets, Erie Golden Blades, and the Virginia Lancers. It is believed that there will be an addition of 3 teams to the l~ague for next season's play. The Union mudent tumout was very impressive for the opening game and it was greatly appreciate<\ by Todd and Curt; the fans were equally appreciative for their fine play. ·tenth of the season. Hartman and the goalie went for the ball in front and collided. The ball came free and Hartman recovered and put the ball in before the goa:lie could recover. Rugby On a Roll Union raised its record to 10-1- 1 while Rochester went to 11-3. Union goalie Jon LaDuke got his fourth shutout in a row. The team showed why they are ranked in tbe national top twenty. On Monday, Union (10-1-1) played.Vassar (7~·1) and won, 5-0. Now Union is 11-1·1 and .... Vassar is 7-7-1. This game was the most difficult of the season because of the death, Sunday, of junior Bryan Bakker. Bakker is from the Poughkeepsie area and he died' in a car crash Sunday afternoon. Bryan played sweeper apd was probably going to replace Gu.y Claveloux: next year as Qlavel<>ux . is graduating; This year, Bakker had done an ex- cellent job coming in to give Claveloux a rest. A week ago Saturday, he scored his first goal against Plattsburgh, which is something a fullback doesn't usually do. The loss .of Bryan is a devastating blow to the team. The team will miss him. On Monday, the t-eam wore a black armband in memory of their friend and teammate. The first goal of the game was an own goa1 which is one where a team puts the ball in its own net. The goa:lie came out to clear a ball and it hit one of the defensemen and went in at 2:41 into the game. Twelve se<Jonds later, Bob Crandall -scored -the first \Of his hat tricks. Doug Wilk pass~ the bBif iil front to By CHRIS SHERIDAN One hundred and thirty-one points ago, Union's men's rugby club was looking .at a bleak, 0-2, start of their season. Three weeks later, the ruggers have a 3-2 record, outscoring their opponents, 13h3, in their last three games. This total was rung lip after last Saturday~s 31- 3 blowout of. Hamilton. UniDn began their scoring ·when Perry Levy ran for a try from about 15 meters out. With the conversion successful ·by Dave Blee, Union was ahead, 6- 0. Hamilton came back in the first half with three points on a penalty kick, the only points scored on Union in their past three games. . Union's:fullbaek PatDiCierbo · hit a penalty kick of his own, tl)e . first of many good plays he'd mak:e durin.g the game. Leading 9-3, 'Wing Steve Delano. showed his incredible speed mth a 15-- meter run around the left hand sid~blowing by aU of the defenders to .put the ruggersup, 13-:1. Blee converted once more from a difficult angle to make it 1~. - Levy.got his second try of the game soon after with a burst of speed~ bot the conversion was missed. Then, with the ball deep in their own end,. DiCierbo booted the ball the length of the field to give Union perfect field position for another try: About a minute after, DiCierbo made . his :way intb the try-zone for his first try foJ. the season. Blee again made tile kick to give Union tqeir 25th point. Levy got his third and final try of tl)e game after picking up a looseJball and fighting his way into tlfe right ltand side of the try-zqne. DiCierbo connected on the estra two points and the final whistle blew with Union up, !.U-3. Qne of the major reasons for Union's success versus aamilton was the superb klcking of DiCierbo. Everytime the balL was iii Union's end, DiCferbo connected on the kicks perfectly to give Union great .,.;field position. .Along with tlie kick~ DiCierbo totalled nine points· on the game-a try, conversion, and 'a penalty kick! Union faces Plattsburgh this . coming weekend at home in a difficult match. Plattsburgh, who hasn't lost yet this season, · is looking for the fall. cham- pionship. The ollly team that stands in their way now is Union, who, if they play their game as best as the/ can, have a good chance ,() upsetting Plattsburgh, Injured Jeff Albrecht, who has been out of the lineup since the Siena· game will not be bact to play this season. This, along with the loss of Steve Lipsky dae to a torn tendon in his foot, is a tremendous loss to Union's squad. Qinncnr~iensis SPO R Charlie Slotnlk Looking at Spor,ts By CHARLIE SLOTNIK FLUSHiNG, NY -\Baseball Like It Oughta Be\ is the slogan in front of Shea Stadium, the home of the world champion New York Mets. And sure enough, the baseball season ended just as it \ought\ to have, with the Boston Red Sox losing yet another critical .game, and extending their not-winning streak to 69 years. The Red Sox have not won a World Series since 1918, and could possibly never win . one again. Last Saturday night, lead\ng 5-3 in the 10th inning of the sixth game, the Red Sox came as close to bringing a world championship to Boston as any Red Sox team in recent history. The Red Sox needed only one more out, and the Met batter at the time, Gary Carter, had two strikes on him when he singled to ignite a three-run Met rally that ended any hope of Boston winning a world championship. There was a seventh game two days later that would decide the championship, but this was a mere formality because as every Boston fan knows, no Red Sox team is capable of winning the big game. And sure enough, a 3-0 Red Sox lead through six innings WDuld soon transform into a 6-3 Met lead after seven innings, and an eventual8-5 Met victory. Once again, the dreams of a world championship for Red Sox fans would still be mere dreams, for the reality of second place had finally set in. This was not the first year the Red Sox had come close to winning a world series, only to fall short in the end. In 1946 the Red Sox had Ted Williams, the best hitter in baseball. The Red Sox were tied; 3-3, with the Cardinals in the bottom of the 8th inning of the seventh game when with two outs, Enos Slaughter scored from first base to give the Cardinals the lead and the championship. The Killer B's weren't as fortunate as the A's were. Hamilton scored early in the game with a 3-point penalty kick from mid-field.

The Red Sox jwnped out to a 3-0 lead, and a championship was within sight. But soon enough, the Reds tied the score, and then went ahead, 4-3, in the top of the ninth inning on a Joe Morgan single to win the championship.

Bostonians believed a sweep was inuninent, and that the Red Sox had finally rid themselves of a 68-year-old curse. But for the Red Sox neither a two-game lead in the world series, nor a two-run lead with two outs in the loth inning is not really much of a lead, for in the end, the Red Sox always come up short.

Ryan (6'1\ 225 lbs.) attended Wayne Hi).ls High School and looks like he has a place in the offensive backfield for the Dutchmen for a few more seasons. The outstanding play of both Mike VanHorn and Ryan Mason made it an easy choice for co- award winners and each should be congratulated for their job well done in the tough win over Williams. Flanigan and Cole Continued from page 20 their victory, the team bus broke down on the Northway and there Todd and Curt slept through the night. They had to cancel their game and take a fine but it wasn't that bad, they escaped the dreaded 12 hour trip for at least a week or two. The Slapshots play 56 total games including 28 home games at the RPI Fieldhouse in Troy. The tickets for a game are $7 and their next home game is tonight at 7:30p.m. as Slapshots hosts the Carolina Thun- derbirds of Winston-Salem, North Carolina. As of now the league consists of 5 teams: Troy Slapshots, Carolina Thun· derbirds, Utica Comets, Erie Golden Blades, and the Virginia Lancers. It is believed that there will be an addition of 3 teams to the league for nellt season's play. The Union student turnout was very impressive for the opening game and it was greatly appreciated, by Todd and Curt; the fans were equally appreciative for their fine play. The first half was evenly played and the shots were limited by both teams. The score at half-time was o-o. Union dominated in the second half. The first goal was scored by Jim Monks and was assisted by Rich Engdahl with 31: 41 remaining in the game. Engdahl kicked a long ball off a direct kick from midfield. Jim Monks ran on to it in front and kicked it in past the goalie who was coming out to cut dwon the angle. The second goal was scored by Steve Hartman, his tenth of the season. Hartman and the goalie went for the ball in front and collided. The ball came free and Hartman recovered and put the ball in before the goalie could recover. Rugby On a Roll Union raised its record to 10-1- 1 while Rochester went to 11-3. Union goalie Jon LaDuke got his fourth shutout in a row. The team showed why they are ranked in the national top twenty. On Monday, Union (10-1·1) played Vassar (7-6-1) and won, 5-0. Now Union is 11-1-1 ancl. Vassar is 7·7·1. This game was the most difficult of the seaso!l because of the death, Sunday, of junior Bryan Bakker. Bakker is from the Poughkeepsie area and he died in a car crash Sunday afternoon. Bryan played sweeper and was probably going to replace Guy Claveloux next year as Claveloux is graduating. This year, Bakker had done an ex- cellent job coming in to give Claveloux a rest. A week ago Saturday, he scored his first goal against Plattsburgh, which is something a fullback doesn't usually do. The loss of Bryan ii a devastating blow to the team. The team will miss bhn. On Monday, the team wore a black armband in memGry of their friend and teammate. The first goal of the game was an own goal which is one where a team puts the ball in its own net. The goalie came out to clear a ball and it hit one of the defensemen and went in at 2:41 into the game. Twelve seconds later, Bob Crandall S!!ored the first of his hat tricks.

Three weeks later, the mggers have a 3-2 record, o11ts(ming their opponents, 131·3, in their last three games. This total was rung up after last Saturday's 31- 3 blowout of Hamilton. Union began their scoring when Perry Levy ran for a try from about 15 meters out. With the conversion successful by Dave Blee, Union was ahead, 6- 0. Hamilton came back in the first half with three points on a penalty kick, the only points scored on Unim in their past three games. Union's fullback Pat DiCierbo hit a penalty kick of his own, the first of many good plays he'd make during tile game. Leading 9-3, wing Steve Delano showed his incredible speed with a 15- meter run around the left hand side-blowing by all of the defenders to put the i'llggers up, 13-3. Blee converted once more from a difficult angle to make it 15-3. Levy got his second try of the game soon after with a ~urst of speed, but the converston was missed. Then, with the ball deep in their own end, DiCierbo booted the ball the length of the field to give Unioll perfect field position for another try. About a minute after, DiCierbo made his way in'o the try~zone for his first try :of the season. Blee again made the kick to give Union tqeir 25th point. Levy got his third and final try of t:tie game after picking up a loose .)ball and fighting his way into tlfe right hand side of the try-zQne. DiCierbo connected on the estra two points and the final whistle blew with Union up, .~1-3. Qne of the major reasons for Union's success versus Hamilton was the superb kicking of DiCierbo. Everytime t.b.e ball was in Union's end, DiCierbo connected on the kicks perfectly to give Union great field position. Along with the kicks, DiCierbo totalled nine points on the game-a try, conversion, and a penalty kick. Union faces Plattsburgh this coming weekend at home in a difficult match. Plattsbw-gh, who hasn't lost yet this season, is looking for the fall cham- pionship. The only team that stands in their way now is Union, who, if they play their game as best as they can, have a good chance of upsetting Plattsburgh. Injured Jeff Albrecht, who has been out of the lineup since the Siena game will not be back to play this season. This, along with the loss of Steve Lipsky due to a tom tendon in his foot,. is a tremendous loss to Union's squad. <!rnncnrlliensis SPORT Charlie Slotnlk Looking at Spor,ts By CHARLIE SLOTNIK FLUSHING, NY -\Baseball Like It Oughta Be\ is the slogan in frm1t of Shea Stadium, the home ef the world champion New York Mets. And sure enough, the baseball season ended just as it \ought\ to have, with the Boston Red Sox losing yet another critical game, and extending their not-winning streak to 69 years. The Red Sox have not won a World Series since 1918, and co.uld possibly never win one again. Last Saturday night, leading 5-3 in the loth inning of the sixth game, the Red Sox came as close to bringing a world championship to Boston as any Red Sox team in recent history. The Red Sox needed only one more out, and the Met batter at the time, Gary Carter, had two strikes on him when he singled to ignite a three-run Met rally that ended any hope of Boston winning a world championship. There was a seventh game two days later that would decide the championship, but this was a mere formality because as every Boston fan knows, no Red Sox team is capable of winning the big game. And sure enough, a 3..() Red Sox lead through six innings would soon transform into a 6-3 Met lead after seven innings, and an eventual 8-5 Met victory. Once again, the dreams of a world championship for Red Sox fans would still be mere dreams, for the reality of second place had finally set in. This was not the first year the Red Sox had come close to winning a world series, only to fall short in the end. In 1946 the Red Sox had Ted Williams, the best hitter in baseball. The Red Sox were tied, 3-3, with the Cardinals in the bottom of the 8th inning of the seventh game when with two outs, Enos Slaughter scored from first base to give the Cardinals the lead and the championship. The Killer B's weren't as fortunate as the A's were. Hamilton scored early in the game with a 3·point penalty kick from mid-field. On ton of In 1967, the Red Sox were predicted ta finish fifth in their division, but with a cast of characters that included Carl YastrzemskY, Jim Longborg, and Tony CGRigliaro, the Red Sox won the American League Championship and the right to play Bob Gibson and the St. Louis Cardinals in the World Series. Nevertheless, the im- possible dream Red Sox lost again in seven games to the superior Cardinals as Bob Gibson beat them three times. Then in 1975, the Red Sox dramatically won the sixth game of the world series in the 13th inning to force a seventh game with the Cincinnati Reds. The Red Sox: jumped out to a 3-0 lead, and a championship was within sight. But soon enough, the Reds tied the score, and then went ahead, 4-3, in the top of the ninth inning on a Joe Morgan single to win the championship. Boston fans went horne disappointed once again. Despite all the bad luck Red Sox teams have experienced in the past, many Red Sox fans and players believed this world series would be different. At first it appeared the Red Sox might upset the Mets as they beat them in the first two games at Shea Stadium, and took a 2·0 lead in the series home to friendly Fenway Park. Bostonians believed a sweep was imminent, and that the Red Sox had finally rid themselves of a 68-year·old curse. But for the Red Sox neither a two-game lead in the world series, nor a two-run lead with two outs in the 10th inning is not really much of a lead, for in the end, the Red Sox always come up short.

Flanigan was second in scoring last year for the Dut- chmen and was awarded the MVP award for his never en- ding hustle in the corners and his ability to be in the right place at the right time. Todd is undoubtedly a late bloomer as the 23 year old continues to improve with every shift on the ice. His year round training (he has spent the past two summers playing hockey in Minnesota J and work ethic has enaabled him to impress first, Union Coach Charlie Morrison and second, Coach Joe Selenaki of the Troy Slapshots. \One of the players I'm most surprised with is Todd Flanigan,\ Selenski said. \I really wasn't looking forward to him putting forth the. type of effort he's putting in and· to impress me with his abilities. as much as he has.\ Todd, a Troy native, recently signed a Z5 week contract with the team which will keep him busy until March. Curt Cole, last year's co- captain with Tom Hodgins, was tied for second in scoring with Flanigan and was an obvious leader and hard worker fat Union. Curt, a resident of Naples, Florida, came back to Schenectady to finish up his requirements for graduation and for the most part just stumbled onto the Stapshots organization. Now, he too has signed a contract and begun his professional career. With the personal ch·ive and an attitude of never settling for second best leaves the possibility for Curt to move on to bigger and better hockey teams. Curt is one of the few members of Union's 100 Club with an accumulated 113 points over his 4 year varsity career. Their professional careers The tri-match began against Mount Saint Mary's with a victory of 15·7 and 15·11. In the first. game, a shy but striving freshman, Olessa (Yogi) Butenko, started and played an amazing game as a back court began on an upbeat but tbe reality of the low budget of tbe A CHL was soon evident. In his first game as a pro, Todd scored 2 goals and had an assist for 3 points in the 8-5 victory over tbe Utica Comets. Curt, a natural forward, played stellar defense on Saturday and looks to be a scoring force from the blue line for the Slapshots.

Dean of Residence Life David Wood a lle.viate futur-e housing problems. H·ousi.ng Shortage Confronted Report Criticizes Residence Policy By SANDY ROTH The Committee on Residence Life was created in the fall of 1985 to examine the housing situation at Union College. It was founded in recognition· of the failure .of the college to • provide a sufficient amonnt of . adequate housing. According to. the report, Union knows there is a housing problem, but they have not acted quickly enough to rectify the situation. As a result, people must live in lounges, five-man suites, triples, or move off campus. More freshmen are attending Union this year than in previous. classes. There are 544 in the class of 1990, while tbe class of 1989 and the class of 1988 had 532. This causes a shortage of rooms. Freslunen are residing in five man suites in Davidson and Fox. This makes for crowded living conditions. Space to move is minimal. The students say they \bump into things'~ and have no room to walk. . In recent years, floor lounges have been converted to student rooms. Four loooges in West ·College, one in Bronner House, three in Richmond House and ·, one in South College have been contimially occupied. Accor- ding to the report by the Housing Corrunittee, academic research has found that students without a places to go Continued on page 2 Sharlet parallele(! the Daniloff-Zakharov sitllation with two similar incidEnts in Soviet-American history-. First, in November, 1963, in re~:ponse to the US arrest of a :lligh. :level Soviet spy, a visiting professor at the University of Moscow fr()m Yale University, Frederick C. Barghoorn we~s set up and arrested for estti()nage. The professor was freed, and the Soviet spy did not :return to the Soviet Union lliltil 1971. Again in 1974, a similar Sl:!enavio occurred. The United States arrested a high level Soviet spy. S()on after, the Soviet Union responded by setting an American businessman, F. Jay Crawford, and chargi!lg him with espionage. The American was released first, aJtd in ex- change for the spy, the Soviet Union released several dissidents to the West. Professor Sharlet feels that a similar resolution will be reached in the Daniloff case. He listed four possible diS£!Ldents that could be released There are Ida Nudel and V1a.dmir Slepak, who have bee11 refused the right to emigrate oor many . years. Third, there ~ David Goldfarb, a geneticist. He is considered a dissident llecause he refused to set up DalliJ()ff for the KGB several years earlier. Fourth, there is Dr. Y1ui. Orlov, re11owned physicist and hllfilan . rigllts spokesman arrested in 19':n. Except for Orlov, they are all Jewish. 1uef:;day, after Danil()ff was released and on llis way · home, Sharlet commeJtied on the nature of the release.

Delta ·upsilon Controversy Reaches Local Media Housing , Protest Rumors Abound By DAVID GULLIVER The recent recision to e\~ict -Delta · Upsilon · evok~d c1:1n- · troversy that reached local newspapers and raised several questions important to Union students. Tbe rumors that fraternity members would walk off the football field or remove their Union football helmet decals were reported in the Albany Tinles-Uniou and the Knickerbocker News. On campus, more rumors abounded about the future of the fraternity and their house. \They love to have the publicity of the football team. Now they turn around and do this to us.'~ .-Mike GargioJo The initial reaction of the . Delta Up.silon was, un- derstandably, resentment. Quarterback Mike Gargiulo said, in a Sept. 26 Knicker- bocker News article, ''We do mt want to play for this school-we want to play for this f<lotball program ... The love to have the publicity of the football team. Now they turn around and do this to us.'' The article also mentioned the planned protest which in- volved remilving the decals commemorating Union's ·-centennial ·football season, at eith~r the Colby game (Sept. 27) · or at the homecoming game against RPI on Oct.ll .. The .paper also quoted Gargiulo as saying, \If our house walks off this football team, there won't be much of a football team left.\ Eleven Delta Upsilon members either start or see much playing time. By the time of the Colby g~e, tempers seemed to have cooled. There was no walkout; nor were there any helmets without decals. Sean Duffy, president of Delta Upsilon and a starting defensive tackle, said in the Sept. 29 Schenectady Gazette, \We definitely made a mistake bringing football into it. Now we have to start thinking sensibly about it and try to do something produc- tive.\ Coach AI Bagnoli said, \We talked in great length that you cannot use football as a vehicle to express your displeasure with something that has to do with administrative policy.\ Both the college adM ministration and the Inter- Fraternity Council still Continued on page 3 \,------------------------------~--~~--~~ !Bloodmobile in Fox Lounge Oct. 1-3.

Another goal of the 21 Club is to throw parties for other fraternities; for example, Alpha Epsilon Pi, Gamma Phi Beta and Alpha Phi Alpha as well. If a fraternity or sorority sponsors a party, they will no longer be liable for insuring the event, because the school will have professionals working the door and the bar. This year each fraternity and sorority must furnish at least $1,000,000 worth of insurance and the premiums are from two to $10,000 per term per house. This might be an incentive for them to sponsor all-campus parties at the 21 Club. The fee for using the 21 Club would be about $70 and the money would go right back into the 21 Club to fund its normal program. This is also a lot cheaper than having parties at nightclubs or hotels. According to Morton, the project has received a great deal of support from Dean of Students, Joseph Mammola and Jan Grey, Director of Food Services, and it might make a big change in the 21 Club this year and make it a place to go at night.

'fbe White House was upset, according to Sharlet, because a bump on the road to the smrunit was unnecessarily created. The question of what is achieved by this entire ex:ercise was also answered by Sharlet. H.e explained that for the Soviets, the Daniloff-Zakharov situation, -as it has been resolved, would first boost the moral of U.S.- based Soviet spies because the Soviets did not allow one ()f their own to just be a.rrested without drawing significant attention to him-her. Secondly, as previously stated, the Soviets know exactly how the U.S. feels about the summit and its importance. Thirdly, as a by-product, the Soviet-based Western press corps may also be intimidated by the action , against Daniloff-an extremely outspoken journalist. The event will also affect the standings of the leaders of each government. Sharlet noted that the KGB has dictated recent Soviet foreign policy. Now, Gorbachev will attempt at the Iceland pre-summit meeting to ''re-establish control and reassert politics over in- telligence.\ Likewise, President Ronald Reagan will attempt to put the 'best face' on his handling of the situation. This is a crucial election year with 22 Republican Senate seats under contention. The party must look at strong as possible, so Reagan will play down the 'swap' or compromise idea.

He added that it would be used for independent housing \for the foreseeable future .. at least through 1987-88.\ Wood noted that at the beginning of winter term there will be more people returning from Terms Abroad than there will be leaving, and Potter House will help that situation as well. If demand for rooms by overcrowded students is high, Residence Life will conduct a lottery for the available rooms. The rooms in Potter House are the least expenisve on campus and cost only $587 per term, and a student's contract would be adjusted accordingly.\ Potter House will be used for independent housing \at least through 1987-88\ -Dean Wood Dean of Students Joseph Mammola commented that the disciplinary decision was l:lased solely on past violations of s.chool policy and that neither the housing situation nor football entered into the decision.

The fraternity was informed that it needed to comply with the IFC criteria· in order to receive recognition by them and the Union Administration. Said Steve Moss •s7, AE Pi vice- president as well as Student Forum president, \We made some mistakes initially, but once the Administration and the IFC informed us of the proper procedures for campus recognition, we began working along with them, according to the guidelines.\ Since AE Pi has just received their charter, they are eager to gain campus housing for the fraternity, but do not foresee any immediate ac- commodations on campus opening up for them. Matt Halperin '87, president of AE Pi, commented, \TheJJ. again, if something opens up and we're next in line, we'll be in- terested.'' Presently, under Union Acbninistration policy AE Pi is in line behind two othe~ Greek societies. Alpha Phi Alpha and Gamma Phi Beta for on-campus housing. In order for AE Pi to receive recognition by the IFC, they had to fulfill six requirements. Among some of the projects that the fraternity chose for their requirements were t«l donate a total of $1000 to thE Cancer Foundation, American Red Cross, Kings Arms Nursing Home, and Schenectady Community Center, as well as visiting the Kings Arms N ur· sing Home last year to offer their time and services. Another requirement for IFC recognition was a successf11l rush and pledge program. Last year, AE Pi recruited eight pledges, and this year is looking for a pledge class size that will be competitive with other campus fraternities. AE Pi als<J prides itself in that it em· phasizes and supports the Greek system as a whole. \Even though we've only been on campus f()r two years, we're a tight kni.'t group and we're looking to make a positive impact on Union College,\ said Michael Aronoff '88, member· at-large of AE Pi.

Daniloff Incident Complicates U .S.-Soviet llelations Continued from page 1 administration's contention that there has been no swap.\ He predicts that the Reagan Administration will call the releases of Zakharov and Orlov a swap, and portray the Daniloff release as a separate action. He adds, however, that both the Soviet Union and the United States realize that Zakharov's release was triggered by Daniloff's arrest, and that the Soviet Union knows their strategy worked. Although the U.S. will receive a prominent physicist and humanitarian, Sharlet said, the Soviet Union is getting the better deal in the long run. As the Daniloff case relates to the imminent summit between President Reagan and Soviet Premier Gorbachev, Sharlet explained that the Soviets were able to test the United States.

Burning the midnight oil may be necessary. That's because there are better than 2500 software packages available for them- more than for any other calculator. Burning the 2:00or 3:00 or 4:00 AM oil is absurd. Especially when an HP calculator can get the a n~wers you want -in time to get a good night's sleep. For instance. our HP-15C Professional Scientific Calculator has more built-in advanced math and statistical power than any other calculator. Our HP-41 Advanced Scientific Calculators have even more potential. There's even a special plug-in software package {we call it the Ad vantage Module) that's designed to handle the specific problems an engineering student has to solve in his, or her, course work.

CONCORDIENSIS, October 2, 1986 PageS Adam and Rob Go To Wall Street By ADAM EMERSON and ROBBLEIFER As senior year kicks in,, Adam and Rob realize it is time to start preparing a job search. What better way than a financialtripto Wall Street? So, with a 7:00 a.m .. d~parture planned for Friday moming, we decided to enjoy a .peaceful · Thursday night. For our sake, Slapshots had us bounced at 2:00 a.m. in!!i;ead of ou.t usual 4:00a.m. Guess we'dhavE;Lto go to bed earlier than normal. When we arriv(;ld home, we were exhausted. A good ni,ght's sleep was certain. However, probably from excitement, sleeping was difficult. Or maybe it was because our rooms were spinning. . New York City. Boy were we surprised when we gQt job proposals right outside the building.! Unfortunately, Rob refused to wear the funny hat and Adam didn't want to sell knishes. But with new en- thUSiasm we joined the rest of the group for the first speaker. We were pleasantly greeted with a tray ftill of coffee and sweet rolls~ Our bellies were quickly satisfied but Rob was sorely disappointed when Adam started stuffing sweet rolls in his socks .for the way home. Too bad the icing stuck to his ankles. Who ever heard of a hairy sweet roll? By the end of the first lecture, bunger had struck us again. Fortunately, lunch was awaiting us atop Prudential Bache. Enjoying a fine assortment of cold cuts with a delightful view -of the Brooklyn Bridge,. we decided working in the Big Apple would be a dteam come true. Then we got the bill. So, while everyone else enjoyed an informative lecture; Adam and Rob scraped pastrami and cole slaw off plates in the kit- an eating extravaganza. French fries, onion rings, steak bogies, burgers, pizza, bagels, and most importantly, a little herring. With .no alka seltzer to be fow1d we resorted to drinking a couple· of sixes to settle. our stomachs. Finally it was time to go home~ For a special treat the bus driver decided to pass Yankee Stadium on the way home. Fortunately, there was a home game about to start; and we got to enjoy the first three innings sitting, in traffic. If it werenft for the late hoqr, the driver would've hit a rest stop outside Albany for Adam and Rob to grab a quick snack. . In retrospect, it was a most \filling\ day, It was so filling, in fact, that we were barely able to split a Domino's 12-cut when we got home. As far as New York goes, we think it's a gosh darn neat place with some· of the finest cuisine in the land. Therefore we conclude that it's a good city to work in, but don't forget to pack a lunch for the day. FEATURES · · ..::z: C 0. 1'1 't s~ e 9\/ OvAd 'fh-~ /).,. If do\' ·t f-~~ \- . . .

Herman Davis, that most creative of television viewers, discovered that he could c(fmbine the plots of any two shows, simply by playing a tape of onl! while another was playing live. So it was no surprise when, last week, h~ played a tape of How the Griucb Stole Christmas with a Sunday morning talk show interview with Governor Cuomo and produced How the Grinch Stole New Y eat's Eve, The story goes something like this: Remember the Grinch, who tried to steal Yuletide cheer? You must have seen the special, They repeatitevery year. But what may be even harder to believe, Is that when he failed to steal Christmas, He set his sights on New Year's Eve. TEST YOUR SKILL. For days he pondered, couldi1 't sleep, only pace, His mind stuck on this goal, How can I wipe that Lang srnitk from every underclassman's face? One day while pacing he heard a Miller commercial. His mind came to rest, Like a producer after an excellent rehearsal. \ Why ,I'll steal their beer, that'll kill their fun. I don't care if they hate me, No one votes who's under twenty-<>ne. And I won't takejust their beer, But I'll take their wine, vodka. and Scokh And if they think I'm kidding, Well, just let them watch. So he raced from the Capitol and visited every tavern and bar, Not just the ones that were close, But also the ones that were far. And he gave every bartender and bouncer Uris proclamation of state, Do not serve anyone under twenty-one. This is a matter I will not discuss or debate. And if you think I'm kidding, jllSt out for a fling, Just make my day, serve a minor, I'll have you sent to Sing Sing. At one minute ere twelve the Grinch turned on his TV. Ah, millions of sober ltiddies tonight. Now that's a sight rm dying to see. But he was disappointed to say the least. For instead of sobriety, All he saw was a Dionysian college age feast. How this came to be is easy to guess, Everyone who had been legal for a few months, Had kept their old false ID, just like an American Express. And they still showed their age, the figure still was untrue, Only now it wasn't nineteen. · Now it read twenty~two. And our neighbors to the Nortll, Well, their age had gone up just a tad. Vermont's legislature had included a grandfather clause, So the kids wouldn't think them all bad. When last seen the Grinch was skulking away. And he was heard t{) be mumbling How can I ruin Valentine's Day 1 QUITTING. IT COULD BE THE TEST OF YOUR LIFE. Well, we'lllet the Grinch mus~ till his plans become firm.

Paf,!:e 8 CONCORDIENS/5;, October2~ 198~ Olnnrorhirnsis Follllfkc/ al limon Colleg~ 1877 ------~----- -----~- Was the Administration Justified? What Should D.U. Do? Last Wednesday, the arnmnistration handed down the decision to evict Delta Upsilon fraternity from their residence in Potter House. The issue has been intensified by the presence of strong opinions on both sides o£ the case by members of the campus community and the outside media. However, it is important to return to the original set of problems in order to determine whether the administration was, in fact, justified in its action. What did D.U. actually do to . deserve this fate? Most of us know that the decision to evict D. U. was reached after they had broken the social probation that they were placed on, by holding their traditional party after a preseason scrimmage on September 6, against St. Lawrence. This is an important element of the decision, though it is the recent actions by the fraternity that put them in the probationary position to begin with. According to the Dean of Students Joseph Mammola, \Just over the past year, there were a number of serious violations of the College's conduct code by individual members of the D. U. ft;aternity and by the group acting as a whole. The members of D.U. are aware of those in- cidents. These incidents resulted in the College's placing the fraternity on social probation last spring. The incident at the beginning of this year constituted a clear violation of tbat probation. I would prefer not to discuss these incidents in public at this time because they would undoubtedly embarrass the fraternity further.\ Thus, it is these incidents and others before them that have caused the administration to act in this manner. When questioned further, Mammola stated that there were six serious incidents discussed over the past year and that several of them involved instances where the brothers responsible could have been arrested and prosecuted. It is clear that the decision to evict D.U. from the College premises stems from several outstanding factors that al'e present in the minds of the Deans and the President: a) the incidents of the past year involving all present members of the fraternity; b) the actions of the fraternity as a whole over the past three-four years; c) the unwillingness of the fraternity to correct these problems using administrators, faculty members, and fraternity alumni members; d) the image of the fraternity as the \trouble makers\ on campus. In short, the ad- ministration became \fed up\ with the ;fraternity and decided that _ it wouldbe better if tijey were n9t living together onJhe College - campus. The decision to evict Delta Upsilon from their residence at Potter House was a correct one. At Union College, how can we justify allowing a group of student to live together who consistently refuse to live by the rules of the campus and society? How can we condone the actions of this fraternity and allow them to repeat these illegal infractions year after year? Additionally, it is apparent that the members who claim that they are innocent of these infractions (i.e. sophomores) were very involved in the offenses of the past year. D. U.: things will only change if you prove that they _:will change. However, it is also clear that the Delta Upsilon fraternity is not alone in its .. guilt. The hazing incidents that have occurred at Zeta Beta Tau and Theta Delta Chi over the past two years were at least as potentially harmful as D. U.' s most serious offense over the past year. Although one of those fraternities was put on social probation, it appears that the administration did not come down as harshly on them. Certainly an image was painted of D.U. by the Deans and· that is why they were dealt with in this fashion. This facet of the administration decision is not justified. The case of the Delta Upsilon fraternity is not closed. Although it appears that the administration will stand firm in its decision, the fraternity can appeal the decision in the following way. Firstly, since D.U. has not lost its charter, the members of the fraternity can show the administration that their decision was incorrect by reestablishing a strong fraternity that is worthy of a spot on campus. The fraterruty shoUld continually recruit new, worthy members that are willing to stand up for each other and what their charter represents. Their members should condemn any illegal infractions within the fraternity. Most of all, they should remain active in the College community and promote their cause. Living on the College grounds as one fraternity-sorority has become a privilege. Let us hope that two years from now, Delta Upsilon's sophomore class can come together to reestablish a strong D.U. on the Union College campus. Automation Concordiensis-what are we all about? The role of the paper is to inform the college community of the issues that affect their lives. There are more than twenty dedicated editors that are in- strumental in putting the paper together each week. Editors' jobs include assigning articles, editing articles, and laying out the paper. Unfortunately, much of their time is spent in completing menial tasks such as battling with archaic typewriters that barely function. It would be more beneficial if this time could be spent on improving the quality of the paper .. Most college newspapers have advanced into the age of computerized word processing. We at Concordiensis are embarking in the venture of automation. By the end of this year we hope that by integrating these technological advancements, we can upgrade the quality of our p.aper. This improvement would enable us to better serve the college com~ munity.

CONCORDIENSJS, Ocwber 2, 1986 <!Lllltfllrbirnsts Fourukd at lruon C'ollt(!.t /8,\';' ------------- --------- Was th~e Administration Justified? What Should D.U. D·o? Last Wednesday, the administration handed down the decision to evict Delta Upsilon fraterntty from their residence in Potter House. The issue has been intensified by the presence of strong opinions on both sides of the case by members of the campus community and the outside media. H<l\\lever it is important to return to the original set of problems in order to determine whether the administration was, in fact, justified in its action. What did D.U. actually do to .deserve this fate? Most of us know that the decision to evict D. U. was reached after they had broken the social probation that they were placed on, by holding their traditional party after a preseason scrimmage on September 6, against St. Lawrence. This is an important element of the decision, though it is the recent actions by the fraternity that put them in the probationary position to begin with. According to the Dean of Students Joseph Marnmola, \Just over the past year, there were a number of serious violations of the College's conduct code by individual members of the D. U. fraternity and by the group acting as a whole. The members of D.U. are aware of those in- cidents. These incidents resulted in the College's placing the fraternity on social probation last spring. The incident at the beginning of this year constituted a clear violation of that probation. I would prefer not to discuss these incidents in public at this time because they would undoubtedly embarrass the fraternity further.\ Thus, it is these incidents and others before them that have caused the administration to act in this manner. When questioned further, Mammola stated that there were six serious incidents discussed over the past year and that several of them involved instances where the brothers responsible could have been arrested and prosecuted. It is clear that the decision to evict D.U. from the College premises stems from several outstanding factors that are present in the minds of the Deans and the President: a) the incidents of the past year involving all present members of the fraternity; b) the actions of the frater-nity as a whole over the past three-four years; c) the unwillingness of the fraternity to correct these problems using administrators, faculty members, and fraternity alumni members; d) the image of the fraternity as the \trouble maket·s\ on campus. In short, the ad- ministration became \fed up\ with the fraternity and decided that it would be better if they were not living together on the College campus. The decision to evict Delta Upsilon from their residence at Potter House was a correct one. At Union College, how can we justify allowing a group of student to live together who consistently refuse to live by the rules of the campus and society? How can we condone the actions of this fraternity and allow them to repeat these illegal infractions year after year? Additionally, it is apparent that the members who claim that they are innocent of these infractions (i.e. sophomores l were very involved in the offenses of the past year. D. U.: things will only change if you prove that they :wm change. However, it is also clear that the Delta Upsilon fraternity is not alone in its guilt. The hazing incidents that have occurred at Zeta Beta Tau and Theta Delta Chi over the past two years were at least as potentially harmful as D. U. 's most serious offense over the past year. Although one ofthose fraternities was put on social probation, it appears that the administration did not come down as harshly on thein. Certainly an image was painted of D.U. by the Deans and· that is why they were dealt with in this fashion. This facet of the administration decision is not justified. The case of the Delta Upsilon fraternity is not closed. Although it appears that the administration will stand firm in its decision, the fraternity can appea:l the decision in the following way. Firstly, since D. U. has not lost its charter, the members of the fraternity can show the administration that their decision was incorrect by reestablishing a strong fraternity that is worthy of a spot on campus. The fraternity should continually recruit new, worthy members that are willing to stand up for each other and what their charter represents. Their members should condemn any illegal infractions within the fraternity. Most of all, they should remain active in the College community and promote their cause. Living on the College grounds as one fraternity-sorority has become a privilege. Let us hope that two years from now, Delta Upsilon's sophomore class can come together to reestablish a strong D.U. on theUnionCollegecampus. Automation Concordiensis-what are we all about? The role of the paper is to inform the college community of the issues that affect their lives. There are more than twenty dedicated editors that are in- strumental in putting the paper together each week. Editors' jobs include assigning articles, editing articles, and laying out the paper. Unfortunately, much of their time is spent in completing menial tasks such as battling with archaic typewriters that barely function. It would be more beneficial if this time could be spent on improving the quality of the paper. Most college newspapers have advanced into the age of computerized word processing. We at Concordiensis are embarking in the venture of automation. By the end of this year we hope that by integrating these technological advancements, we can upgrade the quality of our paper. This improvement would enable us to better serve the college com- munity. Technological improvements have been seen throughout the campus, and now it is time for them to arrive at Concordiensis.

However, on further thought, we realized · that the only purpose that would serve wowd be to antagonize people. While we believe that there do exist reasons for our punishment, this _is not the issue. Rather, the question that should be asked, is whether or not Delta Upsilon · shoutd be allowed to occupy a house and reside as such on campus. To begin, one must consider the fraternity's campus history. We ;1ren't going to make. ex- cuses or explain every incident; let us ju~ sayf it's been pretty bad. Although .this is·so, things must be viewed in perspective. The present brothers of Delta Upsilon cannot change what past brothers have done. The 'bad boy' image that DU's have amongst the members of the administration has been built over the last decade or so. Senior brothers remember their freshman year when the brothers had no respect for their house or the members of the campus community. This attitude even carried over into sophomore year. Even so, roughly two years ago, things began to change We feel these changes were even sensed by the rest of the campus com- munity. One thing in particular is that we had a pledge class of 22, none of which were involved in building up that 'bad boy' image that we were labeled with. We even called upon some local alumni to become irtvolved in changing the fraternity into a respectable one. Last spring, as well as fhe . surnrner, the brothers and our trustees worked hard to lay down a firm foundation for the workings of our fraternity. We payed b!lc.k much of our debt to the school, invested $5,000 in the house and laid down strict guidelines by which the fraternity was to be run. These guidelines were put together into a neatly written and well prepared packet that was brought to Dean Massa for review. We've been getting comments from students such as, \Why now? You .guys are so dif- ferent.\ We told Dean Mam- mola that we can't understand why· now that our fraternity is doing a total turn around has the administration decided to punish us so severely. · As some may be unaware, let us address recent events that have led to our punishment. We know that the main reason our fraternity was put on social probation last spring was because of a party we held on · May 3. While it was unregistered, we feel that this infraction deserves further -clarification. Ten days before the party, our social chairman went to register the party, but Dean Massa refused our request stating that it was \contrary to t}le requirements of the Delta Upsilon Alwnni Corporation\. Our President met with Dean Mass and in- formed him that the above mentioned policy was no longer in effect. Dean .Massa disagreed and refused to grant us a party permit. We felt that we had gone through the correct procedures and then been un- justly denied. Strongly standing on this belief, we went on with the party to find out over one week .later, that Dean Massa had heard of the party from one of his informants and had placed us on probation. However, this was not the issue that caused the sanctions to be placed upon us. Dean Massa had -informed us to make sure to keep our noses clean for the rest of the spring term so that everything could cool down over the summer. We did. -Going on thiS assumption, we, the brothers, returned to school this fall. We then went ahead to plan our traditional end of football camp gathering. Unless a football player, one has probably never even heard of this party. It has been a tradition to hold a party for football players and coaches after the St. Lawrence scrimmage to celebrate the end of two weeks of double sessions. We.did noi feel that it was a problem having·this party being that it was strictly for football players and coaches, as always, and had never caused any trouble whatsoever; So, when secUrity arrived to ask us to \keep the music down\ we did. We certainly were not expecting that an hour later they would return to tell us that they had called Dean Massa. Dean Massa arrived and tald us to \Close it down\. , Within 15 minutes the party was over. Dean Massa savv the president of the fraternity Sean Duffy, standing outside not letting people in. We felt that this was very unfair, and Sean went to speak with Dean Massa about . it. Trying to fit meetings in with · football .practice was difficult, ' and Sean foWld himself sitting , in the waiting room and then having to run to practice because tbe Dean was toa busy. Sean was persistent because he (as do the rest of us) strongly feel that under the cir- cumstances we handled the situation rather well. In .closing 1 we would like to stress a few major points. Firstly, if an unregistered party was the cause of our eviction, we apologize. It was certainly not done to test the ad- ministration or try to get away with something. It was simply done to award all of the dedicated players, most of whom coincidentally reside at Delta Upsilon. Secondly, we find it very hard to understand why it is the past, not present • actions of the brothers that is affecting us so intensely, and subsequently causing this crisis. Please realize that it is this past · that we have con· tinually ~ought hard to put . behind us\ It is a past with 22 . new brothers have since con- . tributed to help change for a better future. While a decision has been made, we ask the administration to re-evaluate • this matter. A stigma is a hard thing to remove and takes a lot of time and dedication. This is what we are asking for. As we · have told Dean Mammola; we . will do anything to prove that we are trying incredibly hard to By CURTIS M. COLE I think there is a problem on this campus! It involves. the school's policy for handling social conduct problems. The present process is as follows: after the problem in- cident, the individual or organization has a choice of either going in front of the Conduct Conunittee, which is made up entirely of students, or having the administration. solve the problem via the Dean of Students Office. If the problem offender decides to go in front of the student Conduct Committee, the problem is reviewed and the Conduct Committee offers a recommendation to the Dean of Students. After that, the Dean has the final say in tile in- Cident. In almost all cases, the Dean has accepted the recommendation of the Com- mittee. However, this is the step of the policy that r bave a problem with. Let's draw an analogy between social and academic issues. I feel social problems should be handled the same way as academic problems. Because, let's be honest, college is a two-fold experience, both academic and social. Why should these problems not be solved tbe same way? The Committee on Academic Standing works in the following way: After a student is put on Academic Warning, he must achieve above a 2.0 GPA the next term. If he is un- successful, he may be put on Special Academic Warning. At that point the student must reach above a 2.0 for two con- secUtive terms. If the student - r - - - falls below a 2.0 in one of those terms he is subject to the penalty of a two.-terrn leave of absence from the school. However, at this point, the student may appeal to the Standing of Students Committee if there are special extenuating circumstances. His appeal is heard by the Committee and the Committee decides on his condition. 'I'hey can either keep l}im in school, or send him on vacation. This is where I feel the Conduct Committee is short of the necessary power. The Conduct Committee should have the sole power to decide on the condition of the offender at this point; instead, the ad- ministration has the say in these situations. True, the Conduct Committee can send a recommendation to the Dean, but the Dean has the discretion of the final decision. To make this change, I propose that the Conduct Committee be changed so that the panel consists of students administrators and professors: and works in the same way as the Standing of Students Committee, ie., it should have the final say in conduct matters. Presently, the Conduct Com- mittee consists only of ten students. I feel the decision nnaking process will be 01uch more effective with a panel made up of students, ad- ministrators and professors. This proposal will be presented shortly to the Student ·Forum and I would appreciate any support. Curtis M. Cole is the former president of the Chi Psi Fraternity. Dinner/Cabaret Cancelled , change.

Dear Editor: I woUld like to elear up some misconceptions found in a well- intentioned, albeit faultily reasoned, editorial entitled \False Advertising''. This article suggests that the Admissions Office has chosen to represent the 'average\ class size at Union by the median because it better suits their purposes. However, perhaps a brief lesson in statistics will clear up this question. There are three ways to describe the \average\ of a distribution or population: the mode (the most frequently occurring case or category); the medtan (the middlemost score or the 50th percentile) ; and the arithmetic mean (what most people refer to as average). To compute the arith- metic mean you take the scores or measures (class sizes), add them together and divide by the number of cases (or classes). This would give :YOU the average number of students per class. If we did what your editorial suggests and divided the total number of classes by the total number of enrolled students · that would tell us the munber of classes offered per student enrolled--a meaningless statistic. More to the point, however, the three n1easures of central tendency are used more ap- propriately in different situations depending upon the scale of measurement, the type of distribution and other fac- tors. In a symmetric distribution the three measures coincide, but when the distribution is skewed they differ. When a distribution is skewed it means that extreme scores are altering the \averages\. Since the median is less affected by extreme n1easures than is the mean, it is generally the appropriate measure of central tendency in a skewed distribution. Causual reading of an introductory statistics book will bear this out. For example, \If the distribution of the variables shows gross asymmetry of the distribution) the median may be the preferred statistic, because regardless of the asymmetry of . the distribution it can always be interpreted as the middle value\ (Fe·rguson, G.A., Statistical Analysis in Pshychology and Education, (5th ed.), 1981). Therefore, the Admissions Office is using the proper statistic since we know that the distribution is quite skewed. If it were not, the mean and median would be closer together. Finally, the way that a new freshman can interpret this is to note that in half of the classes at Union there are more than 13 students, and in half there are less than 13. That seems pretty straightforward to me.

We did not feel that it was a problem having this party being that it was strictly for football players and coaches, as always, and had never caused any trouble whatsoever. So, when security arrived to ask us to \keep the music down\ we did. We certainly were not expecting that an hour later they would return to tell us that they had called Dean Massa. Dean Massa arrived and told us to \Close it down\. Within 15 minutes the party was over. Dean Massa saw the president of the fraternity Sean Duffy, standing o1:1tside not letting people in. We felt that this was very unfair, and Sean went to speak with Dean Massa about it. Trying to fit meetings in with football practice was difficult, and Sean found himself sitting in the waiting roorn and then having to run to practice because the Dean was too busy. Sean was persistent because he (as do the rest of us) strongly feel that under the cir- cmnstances we handled the situation rather well. ln closing, we would like to stress a few major points. Firstly, if an unregistered party was the cause of our eviction, we apologize. It was certainly not done to test the ad- ministration or try to get away with something. It was simply done to award all of the dedicated players, most of whom coincidentally reside at Delta Upsilon. Secondly, we find it very hard to understand why it is the past, not present actions of the brothers that is affecting us so intensely, and subsequently causing this crisis. Please realize that it is this past that we have con- tinually fought hard to put behind us. It is a past with 22 new brothers have since con- tributed to help change for a better future. While a decision has been made, we ask the administration to re-evaluate this matter. A stigma is a hard thing to remove and takes a lot of time and dedication. This is what we are asking for. As we have told Dean Mammola; we will do anything to prove that we are trying incredibly hard to change. To us, it is worth persistently fighting to keep the house that is very much a part of us all. As it stands now, because of the forced disban- ding of all the brothers at the end of the term, it will be near impossible to keep up our constant collective efforts to bring Delta Upsilon to its desired level, a fraternity that will be restored and respected on campus. Sincerely, The Brothers of Delta Upsilon Fraternity Admissions Advertising Accurate Dear Editor: I would like to clear up some misconceptions found in a well- intentioned, albeit faultily reasoned, editorial entitled \False Advertising\. This article suggests that the Admissions Office has chosen to represent the 'average\ class size at Union by the median because it better suits their purposes. However, perhaps a brief lesson in statistics will clear up this question. There are three ways to describe the \average\ of a distribution or population: the mode (the most frequently occurring case or category); the meruan (the middlemost score or the 50th perceatile l; and the arithmetic mean ( what most people refer to as average). To compute the arith- metic mean you take the scores or measures (class sizes), add them together and divide by the munber of cases (or classes). This would give you the average number of students per class. If we did what your editorial suggests and divided the total number of classes by the total number of enrolled students that would tell us the nmnber of classes offered per student enrolled--a meaningless statistic. More to the point, however, the three measures of central tendency are used more ap- propriately in different situations depending upon the scale of measurement, the type of distribution and other fac- tors. In a symmetric distribution the three measures coincide, but when the distribution is skewed they differ. When a distribution is skewed it means that extreme scores are altering the \averages\. Since the median is less affected by extreme measures than is the mean, it is generally the appropriate measure of central tendency in a skewed distribution. Causual reading of an introductory statistics book will bear this out. For example, \If the distribution of the variables shows gross asymmetry of the distribution, the median may be the preferred statistic, because regardless of the asymmetry of the distribution it can always be interpreted as the middle value\ (Ferguson, G.A., Statistical Analysis in Pshychology and Education, (5th ed.), 1981). Therefore, the Admissions Office is using the proper statistic since we know that the distribution is quite skewed. If it were not, the mean and median would be closer together. Finally, the way that a new freshman can interpret this is to note that in half of the classes at Union there are more than 13 students, and in half there are less than 13. That seems pretty straightforward to me. Sincerely. Rudy V. Nydegger, Ph.D. Assaciate Professor • • • Gu~st Commentary More Power for Conduct Committee By CURTIS M. COLE I think there is a problem on this campus! It involves the school's policy for handling social conduct problems. The present process is as follows: after the problem in- cident, the individual or organization has a choice of either going in front of the Conduct Conunittee, which is made up entirely of students, or having the administratioN solve the problem via the Dean of Students Office. If the problem offender decides to go in front of the student Conduct Cammittee, the problem is reviewed and the Conduct Committee affers a recommendation to the Dean of Students. After that, the Dean has the final say in the in- cident. In almost all cases, the Dean has accepted the recommendation of the Com- mittee. However, this is the step of the policy that I have a problem with. Let's draw an analogy between social and academic issues. I feel social problems should be handled the same way as academic problems. Because, let's be honest, college is a two-fold experience, both academic and social. Why should these problems not be solved the same way? The Committee on Academic Standing works in the following way: After a student is put on Academic Warning, he must achieve above a 2.0 GPA the next term. If he is un- successful, he may be put on Special Academic Warning. At that point the student must reach above a 2.0 for two con- secutive terms. If the student r falls below a 2.0 in one of those terms he is subject to the penalty of a two-tenn leave of absence from the school. However, at this point, the student may appeal to the Standing of Students Committee if there are special extenuating circumstances. His appeal is heard by the Committee and the Committee decides on his condition. They can either keep him in school, or send him on vacation. This is where I feel the Conduct Committee is short of the necessary pawer. The Conduct Committee should have the sole power to decide on the condition of the affender at this point; instead, the ad- ministration has the say in these situations. True, the Conduct Committee can send a recommendation to the Dean, but the Dean has the discretion of the final decision. To make this change, I propose that the Conduct Committee be changed so that the panel consists of students administrators and professors: and works in the same way as the Standing of Students Colllinittee, ie., it should have the final say in conduct matters. Presently, the Conduct Com- mittee consists only of ten students. I feel the decision making process will be much more effective with a panel made up of studtmts, ad- ministrators and professors. This proposal will be presented shortly to the Student Forum and I would appreciate any support. Curtis M. Cole is the former president of the Clli Psi Fraternity.

Among the most important of all reflexes is the one that controls the con- traction and relaxation of ar- teries to maintain a steady blood pressure. Thus, when the a utolilomic nervous system becomes imprecise blood flow to the brain is often temporarily reduced, and standing up from a reclining position may then be sllfficient to make a person feel clizzy (synonymous to a \head rush'' in people of our generation). One can see that getting out of the bed in the morning might be downright dangerous. After having negotiated the perilous journey from bed to breakfast table, people with this so-called autonomic failure face yet another hazard: after eating t11ey are vulnerable to faintness and collapse because blood flow is diverted to the digestive organs and most likely the autonomic reflexes will not kick-iu as they should again. However, according to the New England Journal of Medicine, August 29, 1985, caffeine seems to improve matters. Two hundred and fifty milligrams of caffeine--the equivalent of two cups of coffee- -were quite effective at reducing the fall of blood pressure observed .in a group of patients inclined to autonomic failure after a meal. Hence, the authors suggested two cups of coffee with breakfast for these patients. However, they recommend that coffee not be taken for the rest of the day, since too much use only tends to blunt the effect of caffeine. Breakfast was selected for treatment owing to the fact that it usually causes the worst symptoms. Whether this two cup ap- proach will work for everyone with this form of the after· breakfast blues, or work con- sistently, still remains a mystery. However, it is a simple treatment and worth a try--sugar and cream still remain optional.

Octobl!r 2, I ()86 at Proctor's Theatre • • • -Biloxi Blues By KATHY STEINBACH and JULIE STEINBERG Proctor's Theatre was proud to present Neil Simon's ''Biloxi Blues\ on September 22 and 23. In 1985, Biloxi Blues was the recipient of the Tony Award for Best Play. Biloxi Blues continues to tell the adventures of Eugene MmTis Jerome, a stereotypical 18 .. year-old Jew from Brighton Beach, Brooklyn, New York. Eugene leaves home for the first time because he is drafted into the U.S .. Army to fight in World War II. It is here that Eugene hopes to fulfill his four ambitions: to become a writer, to lose his virginity, to fall in love, and to stay alive. Eugene's platoon buddies vary in background and religion, which makes for ·conflicts and misun- derstandings. Joe Wykowski is a tough talking, morally straight Pole who declares himself platoon leader. Donm- carney is a friendly WASP whose biggest problem is not being able to make up his mind. Roy Selridge is a loud-mouthed guy whose main concern is women, whereas James Hen- nerey's is in men, which causes him to be discharged from the Army. Arnold Epstein, another Jew, is differentfrom his ,peers and refuses to lower himself to the standards of a· soldier. Commanding the platoon is Sargent Toomey: a regular Army man who strongly believes in discipline. Throughout the play, Eugene keeps a secret diary whicb covers daily events and his intimate feelings for his platoon, his sergeant, and Daisy Hannigan-his first love. This diary. or as :E:ugene prefers to call it, \his memoirs\ is how he intends to become a writer ill the Artny. Starring intllerole of Eugene is William Ragsdale who .aJ.:£() portrayed Eugene in Brightm Beach Memorirs, tlie predecessor of Eilon Blues. He has most recently appeared as Charlie Brewster in the motion picture, Fright Night. Biloxi Blues is directed by Gene Saks, who has staged all recent Neil Simon plays, and was named 19115 Tony Award winner for BElst Director. Biloxi Bluesis a light comedy with a message. It shows a young man's :forced maturation into manhood as he faces· tlle Army and the war, and his v1ill to survive.

A Unique Look At a Unique Culture Comes to Proctor's By SHELLEY SZYMKO This past Friday Proctor's Theatre hosted an ex- traordinary artistic heritage of India, in Festival of India 1986. Over thirty performing artists presented classical Indian dance and music encompassing Hindu, Moslem and Buddhist mythology, and spiritual legends. The program created a hauting mood of sensual spirituality, prominent in dances such as the Odissi, Purulia Chhau, and Kalaripayattu. Odissi was a classical dance that is sculp- turesque and is achieved through a complex vocabulary of body posture and stance. Madhavi Mudgal pel'formed the dance and her training under several outstanding gurus brought her the sensitivity and discipline needed for the Odissi. Madhavi's artistry has been witnessed in all the major cities and cultural festivals of l!ldia and she teaches at one of the premier institutes o£ music and dance in her country. Another dance, Purulia Chhau was a masked dance-drama frCJrn the district of Purulia in n~>r­ theastern Inclia. This primitive form of tribal dance carried tbe message of good over evil. The performance showed two op- posing forees locked in mortal combat, an<l the masks worn by the dancers had distorted facial features such as blazing bloodshot eyes and wide dilated nostt·ils. This popular dance is demo.nstrated by several hundred dance tr<Jups throughout the Eastern half of India. The most exciting part of the perfo1·mance was the traditional Indian ma11ial arts form, Kalaripayyatu, a fencing technique which transforms combat into a perfect syn~ chronizat i()n of movement. Beginning Kalaripayyatu students performed with . a simple stick, the cheruvadi, and then experienced students used more dangerous weapons in- cluding spears, swords, and daggers. One weapon, the urumi, or belt-sword, a four to nine foot sword, was very spectacular to watch and was extremely difficult to maneuver because of its flexibility and sharp edges. Qawwali, a fonn of devotional singing, differs greatly from the Odissi, Pur11lia Chhau, and. Kalaripayyatu. Its ·er~gins go back to the 13th century Moslem traditi~n of music, ':\\fi,;:- songs induced a state of ecstatic devotion and praise to the prophet Allah. Mohd.

The magician, Jim Snack, was tame, but refreshing with his acts of magic, which most of us could figure out without an Acme Home Magic kit. He even performed the e-ver-popular and mysterious rnetamorphisis trick for which Harry Houdini was so well known. One moment we viewed Jim Snack atop a locked and barred trunk con· taining his partner, and the next we saw his. partner (ironically enough the famous clogger himself, Ira Bernstein) in that position with Jim now tied and handcuffed within the trunk. The audience members turned to each other and asked the common question, \How' d he do it?\ Bob and I felt it unfair to mention the trap door obviously located on stage (all right, not obviously located, but you cert:;tinly knew it was there). The saving grace of the show was the five-man mime- comedy,juggling troupe, The Wright Brothers. Their antics, both funny and original, made the show almost worth seeing. We especially enjoyed their final act. Accompanied by the theme song from \Chariots of Fire'', the comical group hilariously mimed runners engaged in the heat of com- petition. Granted it is nice to see that people are still doing vaudeville (and Proctor's recently built a replica of a vaudevillian awning with 6621ight bulbs).

One of the best horror movies in some time, that, believe it or not, really is better than the original. · _ As Seth Brundle, the \mad\ scientist, Goldblum again proves that he is one of the best actors on the screen today. He is experimenting with telepor- tation because he suffers from motion sickness. The ex- periment goes wrong and he begins transforming into a fly from the inside out. 'Through it all, Goldblum never lets BrWldle lose his humanity. Looking beyond his grotesque features, the audience really feels for him as he reaches out for help, or tries to keep his girlfriend from getting hurt. Cronenberg, whO seems . to have really grown since his he has not lost much from his ·performing style. Sprinkled throughout the two-hour forty- minute set were some classics like \Piano Man\ \Scenes From An Italian Restaurant\ and \Vienna\. Some new ones included \Tis The Time\ \Baby Grand\ \You're Only Human\ and a jazzier version of \Big Man On Mulberry Street\. He also rocked the house with the last five songs on the set: \Only The Good Die Young\ \It's Still Rock and Roll To Me\ \It's Just a Fantasy\ \You May Be Right\ and closing up with \A Matter Of Trust\. After saying goodnight and leaving the stage for a few minutes, he and the band carne back to play \Uptown Girl\ \Tell Her About It\ \Big Shot\ \Keeping The Faith\ and .finally ended with \This Night Will Last Forever\. When it was all over, I do not think there was one person who did not feel that they got their money's worth. It was good to see Billy Joel back. Welcome back, Billy. ultimate gross-out \Scanners\, intertwines a truly touching love triangle with truly horrific effects~ and a suspenseful story line to keep the audience at the edge of their seats. Unfor- tunately, at times they are at the edge of nausea from some extreme effects. Davis as the journalist who falls in love with the scientist and John Getz as her obsessive ex-lover and editor, add strong support. But the stars of the picture are Goldblwn and the effects, which some may find ()ffensive. Just don't eat a big meal beforehand. On the basis of the strong acting, directing and storyline with the only drawback being the extreme scenes, give it an A-. ..

Cabaret which haq no publicity and no sound system until one hour before show time could leave its audience literally dancing in the aisles? Well, folks, that's what id did! Cabaret began at 10:15 p.m. last Thursday night with a rather subdued but large audience, and ended ap- proximately two hours and fifteen minutes later with a rambunctious group of people. Who says that music cannot effect the character and soul of an individual? Performers Jim Havard, Melanie Mathason, Jeff Winter and newcomer Steve Sanders entertained a full house on September 25. As these perfonners rotated, Jeff with Jim. Jim with Melanie, various musical combinations were heard this evening. These frequent switches between different duets and solo per- formances made for a diverse and more interesting program. The M.C., Jason Green, was inspirational and entertaining from the beginning. In order to uphold a tradition, he opened this week's Cabaret by inviting the freshmen on to the stage. He briefly questioned one girl as to her name and hometown, but actually it was not at all a ''humiliating\ experience. Jason recognized all classes, freshmen through seniors. This was an effective technique to initiate excitement for this evening's entertainment as well as this new year at Union. Cabaret began with Jim and Jeff playing \Rambling Man\. This dynamic opening clenched the audience's attention and set the stage for the next song. The old blues tune called \Stormy Monday\ was generously a,p- plauded. A harmonica from the audience assisted the artists on this piece. \Pinball Wizard\ demonstrated Jeff's incredible mastery of his instrwnent. He succeeded in keeping the original song's fast pace. His vocal accompaniment was well synchronized. This audience was especially excited by Jeff's music by The Grateful Dead. The crowd slapped their legs and used the tables to mimic a drum beat. OO's and ah's came from the audience. A student com- mented,. \I like it, he's really into it.\ Steve Sanders made a brief but memorable appearance. He played two songs, one by Loggins and Messina and one by Simon and Garfunkel, on guitar and piano respectively. He was given an encore and played his third song, \Desperado\ on the piano. Melanie and Jim were up next. Jim accompanied Melanie Jeff Winter and Jimmy Havard who opened with a Carole King song~ She sang with confidence and certainty. The presentation was far superior to her early version of it during Freshman Orientation. She also s('lng a Stevie Nicks song, one of the older songs -in her repertoire. She then tried a Janice Joplin song with a new form of ac- companiment. She asked the audience to clap and used this '- CIJ .0 :::l '- •<:!) CIJ > ro Cl >- .0 0 .... 0 :c Q. as her back up. The performance came to a close with music by the Grateful Dead, Van Morrison and Led Zeppelin.. At this point -the crowd became quite rowdy. They sang along and danced in the aisles.

Complete with garage- like stage and accompanying sound effects, men in mouse suits scurrying around the stage, and an angry next-door neighbor complaining about excessive volume levels, Young made it clear to all that he was there to have a good time and to make as much noise as possible in the process. Touting them- selves as the third best garage band in the world, Young joined with his band of the seventies, Crazy Horse,. and showed that even after recent excursions into computer-generated music, fifties-style rock and country music, he could still r.eturn to the hard-driving fold~rock style that made him so successful with Buffalo Springfield, Crosby, stills, Nash and Young and finally in his solo career. With only a brief intermission, Young and Crazy Horse played for nearly three hours, com- bining old classics with selections from his newest album, Landing on Water. As expected, these newer .songs were less popular with the crowd and the concert dragged a bit towards the middle when Young played a long series of these newer tunes. This lull was more than tempered by the energy Young put into his performance especially when it came to his older music. The show started with a . driving · version of Mr .. Soul,and Young quickly went into Cinnamon Cirl and When You Dance I Can Really Love. Later, Young played impressive versions of Powderfinger and the perennial favorite, Down By the River. The audience was especially pleased when Young donned his acoustic guitar and settled into the folk classics, Heart of Gold, The Needle and the Damage Done. Young even sat down at the piano for the in- spiring crowd.favorite, After the Goldrush. Several times during the Show, Young emm ployed the dramatic talents of an angry neighbor who com- plained that the loud music was unlawful noise pollution, but much to his chagrin, Young and Crazy Horse climaxed the show with deafening versions of Like A Hurricane and My My, Hey Hey (Into the Black). This last song was especially moving as a screen showed pictures of dead rock stars (including John Lennon, Jim Morrison, Janis Joplin, and Jimi Hendrix:), while Young sang the famous line, \Hey Hey, My, My Rock and Roll Can Never Die\. If there was one negative aspect to the whole affair it was the police enforced no alcohol no loitering policy, but even they could not diminish the en- thusiasm eV'eryone felt upon seeing the return of Neil Young and Crazy Horse to the stage. ,, 11 '1 l _, i l

By NANCY GRUNDMAN and JUUE,STEINBERG The Nott, which lies at the center of Union's campus is one of only five sixteen-sided buildings in the world. It was named after Dr. Eliphalet Nott, who was the president of Union College for 62 years. During his presidency, Union attained the reputation of being one of the four most well-known colleges in the country. The Nott was initially intended to become the Schenectady County Library. Today, it is the site for both the bookstore and a theatre. The Nott, which can be seen from almost any location on campus serves as a symbol of Union's commitment to tradition and its heritage. As uniquely beautiful as the Nott is from the outside, it is equally as breathtaking on the inside. For those Union· students who have not had the motivation to see the inside of the Nott on their own or with friends to witness a Mountbanks production, hopefully these two pictures will encourage students and facu1ty alike to attend productions in the Nott and take advantage of this unique monument.

Union overpowered New Paltz in the first two games with a strong offense set up by Rocky Ghezzi. Rocky, who joined the team after pre-season, has now found - herself in a starting setters position due to an arm injury received by Shelley Pino at the Green Mountain Tournament earlier this season. Union was defeated in the third game against Newr Paltz, but rebounded to squeeze out a third win to clinch the match. Scores were 15-6, 15-9, 10-15, and 16-14.

By. CHRIS SHERIDAN .. After four years without losing to rival Albany-State, Union's Men's Rugby Club's streak was broken. Last Saturday's game ended with Union behind 6-0. \It was the firSt time the line and the serum played together in a game .situation,\ explained Union's serum-captain Rob Sharp. ''Although we have excellent athletes on the team, it takes more than three weeks of practice before .a team jells and plays as one. We only lost by one try. It was a close game.\ · Sharp also mentioned that injuries had an effect on the game. There were sever~l - pli:(vers :Playing with minor injuries, and prop Tom Christianson had to sit out the game all together because of a back-injury. . Line captain Steve Konlian added that Union \played a hard .zame. It was a toW!h loss to take. Albany has a ~ood team, but we basically beat ourselves.\ ·' Eighth man Jeff Albrecht felt that endurance was a key factor in the loss. Jeff Zorn agreed. \We were out of shape and if we ever lose again it won't be because of that.\ Union had their chance to score, but missed four penalty kicks (at three possible points each) during the game. The lhside·Center Captain Steve Konlian breaks for the open field at Albany. · game was deadlocked at a 0 ,point tie until less than three minutes left in the game when Albany ran the ball around the right side of the field for the only try; of the game. After a suceessful extra point attempt, the game ended soon after 6-0. Also, the Upstate Rugby U!tion assigned referee .never sl1owed up to the game so both teams agreed to have an ex- Albany State player referee the game. ''He did the best he could do~\ Sharp said, however his best wasn't very good at all. In fact~ a lot of controversy over the game arose from several very questionable calls in Albany State's favor. . _ Despite the loss, Sharp felt very optimistic about the team's match next weekend against a very strong Siena squad. \We'll be a much dif- ferent team this coming weekend,'' he stressed. On a higher note, Union's Killer B team destroyed Albany in tile B game. Union won that contest 12-7. '''I'he freshmen played with intensity not usually seen in players, playing in their first game,\ said Howie Segal. Urlion scored first in the first half when Tom Michael ran throllgh a crowd on the left side and brought the ball to the middle of the field for a try. Larcy Grob converted the try to pnt Union up 6-0. In the second half, Albany came up with a try, h(Jvrever, when they attempted the conversion, the kicker took tVIo steps forward and stopped, p-utting the ball in play. Dave Blee,. replacing injured Larry Grob at serum-half earned the heads-up-play of the game when he charged the ball and ;booted it :t<l the sideline, spoiling Albany's 't!hance to tie the game. Blee continued to tor- mellt Albany when, later in the half, he ran the ball straight up the middle from 10 meters out for the try. Blee converted his own try to put Union up 12-7, and insuxe the victory.

CONCORDIENSIS, October 2, 1986 P'a~e 19 - Athlete of the Week By DOUGLAS LLOYD Congratulations gp to junior running back Darrell Shepherd for his performance last Saturday and his ensuing award as \Athlete of the Week.\ In last week's romping at Colby, Darrell led. the way with 123 yards, averaging 7.2 yards- carry. Until last week, tbe rushing duties of Union's offensive backfield had been spread out, .e not truly allowing any one of _g them to shine. However, at a. Colby, Darrell was given his ~ chance with 17 rushing op- portunities and shine he did. Darrell Shepherd Darrell, a 5 ft. 11 inch 180 lb. Managerial EconGmics major, had previously been averaging 35 yards-game and with this 123 has since raised it to 65 yards- game raising his yardS per carry to 5.8. DarreU leads all other Union rushers by at least 100 yards with 196. Darrell spent his freshman year in the defensive backfield and it was not until last year that he was put back into his favorite positian-tailback. DarreH starred back home in Buffalo at Canisius High School where he was chosen as an All- Catholic running back in his junior a,nd senior yeat·s. Volleyball· 'Sets' Right By JANE HACKETT and BARBARA BRADY With record crowds of over twenty fans jamming the field house last Tuesday, the Union volleyball team battled for victory over New Paltz in a best of five game match. Union overpowered New Paltz in the first two games with a strong offense set up by Rocky Ghezzi. Rocky, who joined the team after pre-season, has now found herself in a starting setters position due to an arm injury received by Shelley Pino at the Green Mmmtaia Tournament earlier this season. Union was defeated in the third game against New Paltz, but rebounded to squeeze out a third win to clinch the match. Scores were 15-6, 15-9, 10-15, and 16-14. Union contin.ued its un- defeated home season (of two games) with the \in by 1:00, out by 2:00, Green Mountain in 3\ victory on Saturday. The first game was a shut out ( 15-0) and their next two games were very close to shut outs as well, with scm;es_ of 15-4 and 1543. Union -~olleyball is on the road today with matches -- ~gainst Williams and North Adams at North Adams. The last home game for the season is next Wednesday (October 8) against Skidmore at 7 p.m. in the fieldhouse. Come early-there may not be enough seats! Ruggers lose A Close One By CHRIS SHERIDAN After four years without losing to rival Albany State, Union's Men's Rugby Club's streak was brokEn. Last Saturday's game ended with Union behind 6-0. \It was the first time the line and the serum played together in a game situation,\ explained Union's serum-captain Rob Sharp. ''Although we have excellent athletes on the team, it takes more than tilree weeks of practice before a team jells and plays as one. We only lost by one try. It was a close game.\ Sharp also mentioned that injuries had an effect on the game. There were several players playing with minor injuries, and prop Tom Christianson had to sit out the game all together because of a back-injury. Line captain Steve Konlian added that Union \played a hard £arne. It was a tou!lh loss to take. Albany has a ~ood team, but we basically beat ourselves.\ Eighth man Jeff Albrecht felt that endurance was a key factor in the loss. Jeff Zorn agreed. \We were out of shape and if we ever lose again it won't be because of that.\ Union had their chance to score, but missed four penalty kicks (at three possible points each) during the game. The Inside-Center Captain Steve Konlian breaks for the open field at Albany. game was deadlocked at a 0 point tie until less than three minutes left in the game when Albany ran the ball around the right side of the field for the only try. of the game. After a successful extra point attempt, the game ended soon after 6-0. Also, the Upstate Rugby Union assigned referee never showed up to the game so both teams agreed to have an ex- Albany State player referee the game. \He did the best he could do,\ Sharp said, however his best wasn't very good at all. In fact, a lot of controversy over the game arose from several very questionable calls in Albany State's favor. . Despite the loss, Sharp felt very optimistic about the team's match next weekend against a very strong Siena squad. \We'll be a much dif- ferent team this coming weekend,\ he stressed. On a higher note, Union's Killer B team destroyed Albany in the B game. Union won that contest 12-7. \The freshmen played with intensity not usually seen in players, playing in their first game,\ said HGwie Segal. Union scored first in the first half when Tom Michael ran through a crowd on the left side and brought the ball to the middle of the field for a try. Larry Grob converted the try to put Union up 6-0. In the second half, Albany came up with a try, however, when they attempted the conversion, the kicker took two steps forward and stopped, putting the ball in play. Dave Blee, replacing injured Larry Grob at serum-half earned the heads-up-play of the game when he charged the ball and booted it to the sideline, spoiling Albany's chance to tie the game. Blee continued to tor- ment Albany when, later in the half, he ran the ball straight up the middle from 10 meters out for the try. Blee converted his own try to put Union up 12-7, and insure the victory. <!rnncnriliensis SPORTS Will the foot ball team stiU be good without quarterback Mike Garguilo this year? Willthe Delta Upsilon footba:ll players quit the team after getting their hoWle taken away? Thus far this year, these have been the mest discussed sports topics on campus this year, and as a result there has been very little discussion about actual olav on the field. However, the Union College soccer team's perlonnance on the field last Satmday in their 2- 0 victory over the No. 1 ranked team in New York, Binghamton St. should spark some interest away from the gr-idiron. In each of the past three years Dutchmen soccEr teams have been to the NCAA playeffs, been ranked in the top 10 nationally, and won exactly 12 games. Essentially, what this means is this year's seniors are not used to losing soccer games. But the 1986 season did not start out the way Coach Bob Magee anticipated. In their first game against Lynchburg College (VA) in the Blue Ridge Tournament Union was blown off the field 7-2. Tile next day the Dutchmen played Keene St. (NH) in the consolation game of the tournament and escaped with a 1-0 victory. In their next two games Union needed overtime to beat a mediocre Cortland St. team 2-1. Then, three day's later after jumping out to a 2-0 lead over Kings Point, the Dutchmen left Long Island with only a 2-2 tie. The game was particularly frustrating bec:ause Union outshot King's Pl)int 31-3. \At that point in the season we didn't know what was wrong. We knew we had a good team, we just were not playing well,\ said junior fullback Dan Pittenger. Union finally played well beating rival Hamilton 3-0 prior to the Binghamton game, but still their was uncertainty among team members as to whether this year's team would be as successful as the 1984 and 1985 team. Before the season, Coach Magee felt despite the prior success, talent and experience of this veteran l~B6 team, there Charli:e Slotn!l'k Looking at Sports were still many uncertainties. \I have seen too many veteran teams fall on their faces because of otJtside distractions. Many of the seniors have to worry al»out a thesis, completing their graduation requirements,. and finding a job. There are a lot of concerns by these young men that often break their con- centration while on the pl~ying field,\ said Magee. Binghamton entered Satu.rday's game as the top rated team in New York state with a 7-1 record, while Union boasted only a 3-1-1 record .. 'This game would prove whether the dutchmen were capable of beating the top teams in New York as they had in year's past, or would have to be content with only beating average squads. From the beginning of the game Union dominated. ''We knew what we had to have. It was a matter of intensity-, and carrying it to them, we dominated early and made them change their game f)lan,\ said Magee. \I think Vle're finally on a roll. The team has come together and is playing the brand of soccer they are capable of.\ This was to be the game in which the Union soccer team would prove that content was not a word in their vocab11lary. Bob Crandall and Steve llart- man scored 10 minutes into the first half; which set the pace of the game, and gave Union it's margin of victory. Despite the unsteady play of the team at times, there bas been one player who has been brilliant this year. Junior g{)alie John LaDuke has won all f()ur of his starts, and has only allowed one goal. Uriion is currently ranked :lrd in New York and 17th nationally. But the Dutcl1rnen cannot be content. Sunday they travel to Waltham MA. to play 13th ranked Brandeis.

Union changed the Continentals' undefeated status with a 3-0 victory. The field was muddy from last week's rain and traction was lacking. Union dominated play in the first half, however, and seemed to be adjusting to the slippery field. Union outshot Hamilton 8-0 in the first half but there was no score. Union exploded with 3 goals in the second half. The first goal was scored with 28:30 left in the game. Jim Monks scored the goal assisted by Steve Hartman on a headball from a crossing pass in the right corner of the field. The secondngoal was scored only 15 seconds later with 28:15 left by Steve Hart- man assisted by Dave Tewksbury. Tewksbury made a pass in the middle and Hartman knocked it in. The final goal was scored by Jim Monks, his second of the day, unassisted with :49 remaining in the game. Monks took the ball on a Hamilton defenseman's pass, dribbled in, and shot from about 25 yards out past the. anns of the diving Hamilton goalie. On the play, the Hamilton team thought an offsides call should have been macle and the team stood.stillleaving their goalie to fend for himself. However, the play was ruled good and Monks recorded his second goal. Union outplayed Hamilton the. whole game. The Dutclunen outshot the Continentals 25-1. The defense played very well and sophomore goalie Jon LaDuke · notched his second shutout of the early season and the first of the week. Hamilton's record after this game waS' 3·1 while Union became 3-1-1. On Saturday. the Dutchmen played SUNY Binghamton who were ranked first in the New York region and fifth in the nation. This was an important game for both teams and especially to tile Dutchmen. The Dutchmen needed it to move up in the rankingB and Binghamton needed it to stay where they were. Union came out fired up and scored a quick goal only 5:19 into the game. Bob Crandall scored the goal Wlassisted as he took a direct kick that went past the goalie. Again, Union dominated its opponent and scored another goal near the end of the first half. Steve Hartman scored. with 10:06 left in the half with an assist going to Howard Fiedler. Hartman beaded the ball in off a Fiedler cross from the lest side of the field. Union outshot the Colonials 10-1 in the. half while controlling the game. The halftime score of 2-0 stood. Union continued to play well for the rest of the game. The Colonials. tried to get back into the game but the defense led by Dan Pittenger's superb play in the air and goalie Jon LaDuke stood strong. LaDuke made three saves (all in the second half) and recorded his third shutout of the season. Union outshot the Colonials in the game, 15-9. The intensity of the game was shown in three warning cards for each team. 1'he Dutchmen needed this game and got it. Union imm proved its record to 4-1-1 while Binghamton ·dropped to 7-2, making Union the 3rd bestteam in N.Y.S. and seventeenth among Division III schools across the nation. F'or those of you who will be in the Boston area this weekend, Union will be pl~ying the always tough Brandeis Judges at Brandeis in Waltham, MA. The game is Sunday, October 5 at 3:00 p.m. so stop by before you come back to 5chool and support the Dutchmen soccer team!. ... defeat Colby Dutchmen Only Get Better By CHRIS SHERIDAN Last year U ended in heorics when Union defensive end Craig Aaron blocked a WPI punt, and safety Steve .Alves ran the ball 54 yards for the touchdown and the 12-9 victo1·y. However, when Union travels to WPI, in Worcester, Massachusetts this Saturday, WPI will be certainly putting their greatest possible effort into the game. WPI; who hasn't beaten Union since 1977, recently had their two-game win streak broken by Tufts last weekend, 24-ll>. Tim Valachovic, who replaced junior quarterback Mike Gargiulo when he broke his foot in the preseason, has led the Dutchmen by hitting 30 out of 59 passes (50.8 percent), racking up 420 yards (140 yds. per game j and five touchdo\\'11S in their first three games. Valachovic completed 9 of 15 passes for 154 yards, tiu:ee touchdowns and no In- terceptions wbile only playing in the first and third quarters, to lead the Dutcllmen to a 44-6 rout of Colby last Saturday. Union's first drive of the game came quickly against Colby. The Dutchmen charged down the field 61 yards in eight plays, capped by a seven-yard touchdown pass to junior tight end Mark Stachowiak. In Union's very next possession, Valachovic eal'lled his laurels by hitting Matt Smith (averaging liJ.O yards per catchon the year, and had four catches against Colby). with a 53-yard pass for a 13-0 lead. Not ·letting up at all, Union con- tinued to -dominate on the next kickoff when Aaron recovered a Colby fwnble on the 30. The Dutchmen drove to the six, but that was as far as they could go. Freshman Bob Anderson hit his first collegiate field goal from 23 yards out to put. Union up by 16. However, it wasn't only Union's offense that was qominating. The _Dutchmen defense sacked Colby's quar- terback 11 times for 61 total yards lost. The score jumped ~o 23-0 when senior defensive back Alex Rita intercepted a pass and traveled 48 yards for the score. Rita had seven tackles in the game.
