After jumping out to a 14-2 mid-season record, which in· eluded two tournament championships (Manhattanville . and . Capital District), the Dutchnien dropped games to Hamilton and Hartwick and thus had to win au of their . remaining games in order to ensure a NCAA bid. Union faced · up to the task after beating RPI and Clarkson last week, which were their 4th and 5th victories in eight days. Coach Scanlon stated that \the boys were - mentally and physically fatigued at the end of the Our Town Review, p. 7 noticeable is the play of the back-court captains Joe Clinton and Joe Wood. Joe Clinton is as valuable to the Dutchmen squad as any player could be to his team. He has run the offense with great judgment and execution, taking tbe fast break when it's there and settiitg up when it's not. Clinton averages 14.6 points and over 7 assists per game and his tbnely bombs from the corner never fail to bringthe crowd to their feet. He ;s third on the all·time scoring list with 1,242 points, and holds three assist records (single game of 15, single season of 176 and career of 550). Backcourt mate Joe Wood is leading the Dutchmen in scoring tbis seas.on with a 19.7 points per game clip. Woody is one of the best natural athletes at Union. His quickness has allowed him to make 56 steals and got~ the foUl line 177 times, which is more than the next two Dutchtnen combined. Together Clinton and Wood make up one of the finest back-court duos in all of Division III. But Coach Scanlon contends that the key to the team's great success has been the play of the big men. \Don't get me wrong, we wouldn't be where we are now if not for the guards, but we knew they would be great. There was some question as to just how well the big men would play.\ The \big men\ are sophomores Ken D'Orazio, Kevin Bartlett, Jim Doherty, and Senior Jeff Feigelson. They have all come through in their prospective roles. A steady performer and fine shooter 1 D'Orazio has been a consistent double digit scorer averaging 13.9 points per game. Ken also led the team in rebounding and blocked shots with 226 and 52 respectively. D'Orazio can hurt a team from inside or outside as he has one of the best jmnp shots on the team. Feigelson, ·Doherty and Bartlett are the unsung heroes of the team. Although not a scoring power, Feigelson quietly contributes by setting devastating picks and grabbing clutch rebounds. In speaking about Feigelson Coach Scanlon said \opposing teams fear him.\ Jitn Doherty and Kevin Bartlett are also vital to the team's success. Doherty is third on the team in steals and assis a and has come through with clutch foul shots in waning moments on more than one occasion. Bartlett is the fourth lea<Ung' scorer on the team averaging just under ten points per game. As the sixth man, Kevin brings quality play when be comes into the game. Also noteworthy is Brian Laux who has been playing with a lot of confidence. Possibly the most deserving but least celebrated member of the team is assistant coach Bob Montana. Montana, who came from Hamilton College, \knows the role of an assistant coach,\ stated Scanlon. \He has a tremendous knowledge of the game and has a great rapport with the players.\ This is the Continued on page 11

Soviet Jew.ry Students' Strike ByJUDIESTE~RDT Staff On february 23, thirty Union 3tudents went on a hunger strike for eighteen hours to protest the imprisonment of Soviet Jews, ~pecially Anatoly Scharansky, an imprisoned .. dissident who had been on a hunger strike himself for many months. The hunger strike was takj.ng. place at many colleges and universities around the United States at the same time. According to a press release, the protest was organized by the University Service De~ment of the.American Ziomst Youth Foundation in conjunction with the Student Coalition for Soviet Jewry's Washington lobby efforts. · According to the American Zionist Youth Foundation, Scharansky was arrested on March 15, 1977, by the Soviet secret police. He was im- prisoned because he was not afraid to speak out against the oppressive government; he publicly accused the govern- ment's propagandists of anti- semitism. His wife had emigrated to Israel and he had applied for a visa himself, but his efforts only ·made him into an even more conspicuous target. For years before his arrest he had been under the surveillance of the KGB. His arrest was merely the culmination of a long- series of harassments. He was detained in prision for nearly a year and a half awaiting trial. In July 1978, he-was officially charged with \treason\ and \anti-Boviet agitation and propaganda.\ He began his thirteen-year sen- tence at Christopol prison. treatment of Soviet Jews by their· own govermnent. According to the press release., oil February 23, over 800 students were lobbying their Congressmen while others were staging demonstrations in front of the Soviet Embassy in Washington, D.C., as well as at other Soviet outposts in the United States. The fast and the demonstrations were meant to attract attention to -Scharan- sky's situation and the cause of Soviet Jewry. Campuses also placed person-to-person collect calls to the Soviet Embassy in New York asking to speak to Anatoly Scharansky. The embassy did not accept the ·calls, of course, but they had to notice them; every campus was assigned an how;' i11 which they had to keep on placing the calls so it was a constant reminder to the Embassy making them aware of strong American disapproval of Soviet maltreatment of their own people. Angel Speaks • 1n Editor's note: According to UPI news release,· Lisa Sliwa, wife of Curtis Sliwa was arrested a)ong with a Guardian Angel patrol leader In a dispute With a transit cop In a New York City subway station this weekend. Sliwa charged tba* the angels were victims of pollee harassment but the ptillce clalm that Sliwa. and. the P3trolleader harassed the transit oHicer. By MARCY BURSTINER ·News Editor Every once in .a while, an individual-arises from the mist .of mediocrity into the media spotlight by elaiming to have the solution to a seemingly insolvable problem. Curtis Sliwa, who, through the efforts of the Union College Spea~ers Forwn, spoke Friday nigfit in Memorial Chapel, is one such individual Sliwa, once a mere manager of a McDonald's restaurant· in New .York City, is now the leader of The Guardian Angels, what some .people call a vigilante group, and \Vhat other opponents claim is a neo-fascist youth organization. Sliwa began by explaining, in a thick New York accent, that he developed the concept of Guardian Angels from.the need for \simple common-sense answers\ to the problem of what he describes as \the number one exported product\ of New York City- crime. He realized that there seems to be more of a problem with crime now than there had been in the 30's· and 40's. He ex- plained that thi!!l is not because there iS now more policemen then, than there are now; he attributes it to \the me philosophy\. People it seems, have the attitude \to hell with everyone else.\; they are not criminals, they are basically good at heart, yet they refuse .to become involved. Back in the . 30's, he went on, upon seeing a crime being committed, there would have been 30 or 40 people in the area ready to \tear the (criminal) litnb from lirilb.\ He also attributed the problem with socialization .factors such as television, magazines, and the family that push for a \(acade of success.\ Young .people are taught that whether they are wealthy or poor, they must look like \a pro\. Parents also stress the attitude of ''take what I can now because if I don't someone ·else Will.\ . . . . Sliwa felt that the only solutiontothe problem of crime was . to fight this· \me · philisophy\ and r~establish what he coined the ''we and us philo~ophy\ in which 11 tbe . community is its own protec- tor.\ These pun:ks reqllzfJ they won't get an education ••• A II they want Is fo ' feefllke they are .number one. ''What I did was I took a lot of different philosophies... I tried to take all the successes that I had experienced in volunteer services since tile age of 14, a little bit . of the workings of a Gandhi, a. little bit of the workblgs of a King ... threw it ali together and came up with the Guardian Angel concept. . He took young people,__ mostly blacks and: hlspanics, ca:rrying no. weapons, ·and. wearing only red berets and t-shirts, \utilizing the law that already. exists- a citizen's right to make a citizen's arrest upon sighting a felony crime\ and tried to tackle· the problem that- neither the police, the politicians; or the sqcial workers could handle. .. Chapel From a small group of 13 people, the Guardial} Angels has grown to an organi~ation compri$ed, according to Sliwa of 4000 \angels\ in 41 Americari and three·Canadian cities. He e~lained that al~ough the public was very receptive to the Angels at · first, the organization has received a great deal of opposition. He commented that people believe that both he and the Angels sound too <good to be true. They ask \isn't it a one-person concept? Isn't it a vigilante .Qrganization? Isn't it a fascist organization?\ Sliwa refutes these claims though-.:. .by ··ex- plaining that the · Guardian Angels is , an interracial organization and that ther~ is no bond between members 'other than the fact that ·they patr.ol together for eight hours per week. . \Cults sQI'Vive by taking kids out of the family settings.;.. and most come. from suburQ&n, middle class backgrounds and are educated ... We work with blacks and HiSpanics... We d()l)'t offer therapy.\ Each Angel · wol;'ks a minimum of eight hours lper week, and they are trained frequently in · abandoned buildings or pubUc parks. \The program is geared so that if you have to deal with nothing- you do.\ Applicants are selectively screened; only one out of every six candidates are accepted, and they must have no criminal record. He claims that . contrary to _stereotypes-- many Guardian Angels are not trained in the martial arts, there are mem- bers of all ages and cultural backgrounds and a large per- centage of the membership is female. · - ''We want peop}e who . are cool, calm, and collective,\ he · went on. They must be a.ble to stand verbal abuse anc;l worlt with interracial groups.

Scharansky has not been permitted to see any member of his family since January, 1982._ Because an his ties with his family and the outside world have been severed, he began a hunger strike on September 27, . 1982 in protest, which he ended recently. He was in poor health to begin with, and is now very near death. People in the U.S. are protest~ a~ainst such Union's part in the protest had stronger implications than disapproval of the treatment of Soviet Jews. Although it only involved thirty students, it signifies a possible changing attitude among students. Union students have- always been generally apathetic towards political issues. The hunger strike was a big step towards greater awareness of political problems and what we can do to let the world know how we feel. Julie Baretz, who led the hunger strike at Union, said, ''The reason that we participated in the hunger strike was not only because we would be adding to the effect · of the nationwide protest, but also because we feel it's very important that the Union community shows an interest in these issues not only by reading about them, but by participating in them~\ Hopefully, the hunger strike will change the situation for Soviet Jews, like~Schara,nsky, and at the same time make students realize that there is a way to afffect policies by. ap- plying their own pressure. respectfut ly subm i:lited, Larry Castelli, Chairperson Committee on Committees 1982-83 SPRING TERM.REGISTRATION PROCEDURES ~ .

Morris has agreed to serve as chairwm of a local citizens' task force, which has been organized for the purpose of studying the feasibiHty of consolidating certain g!)vernment services within Schenectady County. Concern over projected losses in both federal and New York State revermes to localities which fund pubiic services has fostered a need to 1lllalyze the efficiency of the City and County governments. Noting one Specific State proposal that would cut these funds by $1.26 million, Morris· said \ad- dressing and overcoming these aid losses and resultant fiscal problems will require that unique and bold approach be found for delivering local services more efficiently.\ Executive Associate to President Morris, Dr. Jack Maranville, said that Morris will begin his analysis olr jectively. \President Morris had no preconceived notion\ that anything should be con- solidated, r,taranville added. Consolidation at this stage, according to Morris, ''may represent an .approach for providing necessary services with potential for greater ef- ficiency and at lower unit co~s.\ ·The task force will focus specifically on services in the City of Schenectady and the five townships within Schenectady Countv. Mbrris has alreadv sen.t a letter to elected and appointed officials, inviting them to meet with him individually or in small groups. Members of what will eventually be a nine member panel include Kent Dixon, .Union alumnus and chief executive officer of Northeast Savings; Richard Kinnard, vice president and general manager of the General Electric Large Steam. Turbine 'Divisioni Katherine Rozendaal, who setves on many civic . groups; the Rev. J. Dean Dykstra, pastor of the First Reformed Church and a member of the city Housing Commission, and Judy Jacobs of the League of Women Voters. · The Schenectady Chamber of Comin.erce made the decision to conduct the study, and put it in the hands of a citizens' group. Maranville believes the Chamber selected Morris to chair the body because of his background in education and his status as a \responsible citizen in the community.\ \We really want Dr. Morris' independence, his lack of association with other bodies,\ said William T. Westcott, executive vice president of the Chamber, \He was our firSt and best candidate for this kind of study.'' Maranville emphasized that Union, as well as the surrounding community, will benefit from the Grganization of this task force. Pointing out that the College uses local gov.ern- · ment services, he concluded that, \to run a good college, it is important to have it in a good environment.'' order to rid ourselves of this refutation of ~previous attitude, it must be arguments stressed the fact s d · d · 1 acknowledged by Americans that the problem does not tu ent F ·n .

The wide variety .of weapons could help Ull to be le~s vulnerable to a first-strike capability. The number of weapons can be reduced, he suggests, as long as the variety remains inta~t. The third stage of the debate was a final refutatiQn of all arguments presented within their full -context. Professor Weiner first argued that if the United States wanted a \quick- fix\ solution we would not appear to be weak because of our stronger arsenal and flexibility within our triatic system. He also indicated that if the Western Europeans want the protection of their soil then they cannot r.esist the deployment of nuclear weapons there. Finally, he made it clear that a battle with small. bombs would not ·end With small bombs but very large ones. Tb.e scale <!f I weapons cannot be easily controlled because the 01argDn .of error~· is far greater with nuclear weapons as . opposed, to conventional ones.

Finally, · Professor Lewis proposed a hypothetical, example which became the basis of further arguments. and questions. If th~ Soviets were to attack Los. Angeles; for example, would we respond in kind by attacking a Soviet City or would we launch a full-scale attack? PJYofessor Weiner stressed that future responses can only be indeterminant at this point, but he personally feels that we would probably unleash an attack. Professor Lewis, on the other hand, suggested that we would probably attack a. similar city. · NOTICE: Recommendatlons_ .relating to the Third Year Evaluation of Professor Thomas Warger, Assistant Professor of French, are now being· a.ccepted.

Because of the natural gravity of the situation we 'took the building to Traffic and Pet Court How else were we going to collect. the hundred thousand or so dollars the theatre owed us in fines? We had to pay for our vacations somehow ... besides all of this trouble could have been avoided- all the Nott had to do was put up an 'Unloading' sign.', And so the Nott Memorial was brought to trial. As with Traffic and Pet Court policy, the ac- cused is allowed a maximum of three witnesses. Chosen to speak for the Nott were Eliphalet Nott, Chester A. Arthur, and former hockey coach Ned Harkness. Former college president Nott summed up his testimony in the following way, \It was such a nice building when it first came. Back in the old days nobody really cared about' the legality of its presence anyway. Look how it fills· up the space in Library Field. And now this - maligning my namesake. It is· just too much! ! ! \ Due to an extreme case of rigor mortis, ex-President (U.S.) Arthur could not make it, though he expressed his regret. However, that man o~ respectability, Ned Harkness, did ap-eear, delivering a for- ceful speech. \illegally parked - - hogwash! ! I recruited Joseph Jacques Ramee in France, outside the country - It was totally legal!! We had four undefeated seasons, an op- portunity to make Division I in Architectural Competition. But NOOOOOOOO! It just was not good enough! ! \ ' As mentioned before, the Nott faces many stiff charges.

Equal Pay ]for Comparable Work By LORI FAVATA S~ff It has been determined, through psychological studies, that for many women \VhO work, their relationship with their co- workers is more .important than the prospect of getting ahead. Po~ible explanations for such preferences are typically based on people's stereotypical at- titudes. Women do not possess as strong a drive as men or women ate happier when in the home raising children .. Working women have traditionally been paid less than men. Right now the wage dif- ference stands at 59 cents an hour for women compared to $1 for men. On February 22, Lois ijaignere iVisited Union to discuss the issue of equal pay for comparable work. Since 1960 the number of women in the work .force has practically doubled. Out of 4.27 job classifications more than · 50 percent of the women who work can be found in only 20 of these jobs. Most of the:se women are in positions traditionally con .. sidered to be female. For men, ~upying these same positions often means · starting at the bottom and rapidly moving up. ·Female job ladders start lower and end lower. A female college graduate today can elt])ect to make almost as much as a man with a high school diploma. How does one determine \comparable worth\? In tnaliy companies job evaluations are .used to assign job worth poin~s. Points . are designated . in relation to the skill and effort neceSsary to perform -a par- ticular job, Results on. such procedures have shown that women have been continuQusly underevaluated. ' The old excuses for these differences . carr no longer be tolerated. Mariy women who work do so out of economic necessity. They are. faced with either lower· payi.ng female dominated positions or higher' paying jobs in male dominatec;t occupations with little chance for advancement. Women are now expreS&ing interest in wage .differences between men's and w9rnen's jobs·. They are questioning the present evaluation system w~ich determines that truck drivers shol,lld. be paid more than secretaries, liquor store clerkl8 more than teacners, and hoUse painters more than registered nurses. · Women · haYe -been discriminated agairu!t for far too long. It is tilne for others to realize that because a job. has been tr.adittonally_ done by · women does not mean that it is n~cess~rily 'a job which is ' iriherently worthless, The \Equal EmJ?loyment Opport~nity Commission. is c~rently in- vestigating the possibility of deYeloping . bias-free / job evaluations. Leaders :must be made aware · of possible for- thconting changes in their methods of deternrlning job worth and actual-wages. The issue will not be settled until guidelines. for falr · job evaluations can be dete~mined.

Opening February 26 and ru.nning through March 20, HOMESTEADERS is a moving drama about five modern day pioneers whose search for frE:edom and self-sufficiency leads them to Alaska in the wake of the turbulent late 60's. The season will conclude ()n a joyous note with Thornton . Wilder's Puljtzer Priz~winning classic, THE SKIN OF OUR TEETH.

In the past, Seminar Missed To the Editor: the Idol has been painted by fraternities and sororities, but all in good fun.

That people would yse these symbols is sickening; their appearance on the Idol, whether painted by students or not, however, lessen the likelyhood of their occurance by refusing totolerate bigotry ..

Page 10 O~NOORDIENSIS~ ,March 3, 1983 COMMENTARIES. Some ·Complaints To the Editor, I would like to take issue with the political cartoons published the last two weeks in Con· cordtensis, as I believe that they . are irresponsibly deceptive. Last week, your cartoon depicted a Russian, preswnably Yuri Andropov, speaking from a podium built on the bones .and skulls of a great many ''yellow rain\ victims. The cartoon insinuated that even if the · ~.oviet Union didn't use nucle.ar weapons, they would still murder thousands of. .people with chemical and biological warfare. While the .premise of the Soviet Union using those illegal weapons is probably true (although not conclusively !>roven), it only tells half the · ~1tory. Last year President Heagan announced that the U.S. was going to produce and use chemical and biological weapons also. Furthermore, how many are going to die from being exposed to dumping grounds like Love Canal that go lJnnoticed by a scandal-ridden EPA. It is clear that this car- toon, despite its probable good intentions, does a disservice to its readers .. Two weeks ago, David Neiblum wrote a cartoon portraying Secretary of the Interior James Watt shooting a deer. While we must all applaud the fact that a Union College student cared enough about an issue to take a stand in Con· <l!ordlensis, the final product is I once again incomplete. Not only · does James Wa. tt. willingly destroy wildlife areas, but his · programs . are an economic disaster. The Dep1,1rtment of Interior i.s supposed to manage · 1,1ll government owned lands,· but Watt has given away so· much land that the market values have been driven to the floor. in simple terms, Watt has created a land glut that will cost taxpayers millions of dollars in· unclaimed government revenues. Showing Watt as mere'ly a deer h-unter is analagous to portraying Hitler as merely a bigot. · Finally, I would like to respond to Tim MeN erny' s letter from a week ago. It would;· do little good for ·the .fUm • committee to stop showing pornographic films, because students would simply go elsewhere to · satisfy their desires. Rather, it w:Quld be more productive to take ad- vantage of the film committee's control over their audience by showing a five minute anti-rape film before each showing, or at the very least, giving out some pamphlets to viewers as they enter. After all, it doesn't do us any good to pretend that rape doesn't exist, when we can do something about it. The History department offers a course on the Holocaust for this very same reason.

Soviets Violate Salt Il By JACK ANDERSON and JOE SPEAR WASHINGTON - On Feb. 8, the Soviet Union launched a new missile for the second time in four months. The test launch violated _ three specific provisions of the SALT II· treaty. lt is a faGt that SALT II .:ha.s never been ratified. But 'both the Ulli,ted States and the Soviet Union have informally promised to abide by it. F.or example, the United States is putting identifying devices· on B-52 bombers that carry nuclear cruise mis$iles. That is one of SALT Il's requirements~ But the Russions' missile test blows SALT n sky-high. We can tell you the exclusive details of that missile launch. They ar,e in a CIA report that's so tightly classified it ~k~ . top-secret look like a- letter from Aunt Harriet. The new Soviet missile has been dubbed '':PL-5\ by U.S.· intelligence·experts. This is why its launching violated the SALT II treaty: - Ti is an improvec version of the Soviets' SS-16 missile. And the SS-16 was specifically banned by SALT II. ....,.. The new Soviet missile violates the §ALT II clause that allows eacli country to have only one new landbased missile. The United States is counting the MX missile as its· new one. But the Russians alread:y laUnched a new missile ·last Oct. 26. As it happened, the test was a failure~ But still, Soviet Ambassador Anatoly Dobrynin told the State Department it was their one new missile. The one that was launched on Feb. 8, therefore, would be a second missile under SALT II terms. -The third violation involves encoding the radio signals from the missile. This means that u.s. trackers can't read the missile's transmissions to tell if it is in compliance with SALT II. Putting all of a missile's radio signals in code is forbidden by the treaty. Intelligence sources told my associate Dale VanAtta .that this is the first time the Soviets. l:}ave pulled that little trick-at least, it's the first time they've put 100 percent of their missile's transmissions into code. How the Kremlin's. apparent violations ·Of SALT JI will be viewed in the White House is not yet clear. But it may mean that President Reagan will no longer jnsist tb.at .tbe Pentagon observe the provisions of the unratified SALT II treaty; ELDERLY VICTIMiS: ·There is a whole class of Americans who . feel particularly vulnerable to the criminals in our midst.

Some of them are not as sharp mentally as they used to be. And they suffer .from another disadvantage: They are survivors of an age when life . was simpler,· when Americans helped one another instead of trying to rob and cheat their neighbors. Unfortunately,. senior citizens' fears are borne oQ.t by the statistics. Investigators for Se. John Heinz, R-Pa-., asked law-enforcement officials around the country for facts about crimes against the elderly: States and in· vestigators report: \Overal consumer and economic frauds directed at the elderly are wide~.pread and pervasive, touching nearly- every aspect of senior citizens' lives .. \ ln fact, more than 80 percent of the law-enforcement experts who responded to the congressional· questionnaire said the elderly are more frequently defrauded than the general population. What are -the top 10 frauds perpetrated against the elderly? According to the survey, it's appalling but true that .quackery and other medical frauds head the list. Obviously, this is ~ area where older Americans are most vulnerable. . · Next on the list of frauds are home repairs, bunco sChemes and insurance swindles. Then come land and investment · frauds, nursing home rip-offs, automobile cheating and .-last but not least- funeral frauds. It's slgnificant that the congressional survey concluded that many of the schemes used to bilk older Americans involve use of the mails. Yet oil the last day of the lame-duck session of Congress last year, Sen. James McClure, R-Idaho, singlehandedly blocked a bill that would ·-have given the Postal Service greater power to go after mall fraud. Fortunately, thfl bill bas been introduced in. the new session of Congress. And Sen. Heinz is sponsoring a bill that would compensate c~ime victims; inCluding tlt.e elderly.

Other members of the team also did well in their last race. Craig Valenti, who came to the team late in the season with less racing experience than most of the other members, also irn· proved his sfandiilgs. Brian Walters finished.9th in the Giant Slalom ,and 7th in the Slalom. Brian is one of the most ex- perienced members of the team; he h~s raced well all season and provided the team with coaching as well as in• spir~tion. ·nave Ross finished his second season in 19th place in the Giant Slalom. The-women's ski team came very close to bringing a trophy home. Sally Carrie and Carol Yerden both skied well~ The only two female skiers are hoping that next year will find more women at Union who are interested in competitive skiing. That's it for this season! - Special thanks to Jim Schaeffer for a fun season and to Carl Aiken, better luck next season. We missed you.

Women :Finish Strong B:fL.A.F~ Sports Staff Exhausted, sore, waterlogged and victorious, these are ·some of the words that can be used to describe the women swimmers upontheir ret~n from the State Champicmsh1p meet. After three days of swimming at SUNY Stony Brook, the four women, Babs Boutwell, Tricha Bowering,. Lisa Freed and Sharon Pearl, had reason to be proud. . · Overall, the Union swimmers beat about five other squads. For a team of four up against teams of twenty or more, tbis is quite a res~table finish .. The relays als9 did well, especially the 800 yard freestyle relay. This particular relay shaved over 10 seconds off their best and placed in the top 10. The other relays also bettered their, times. All qualified for the consolation (top 18). Individually · the s~ers managed to do quite well. All dropped their personal best times either in a relay or an mdividual event. Freed swam quite wen in the· 200 backstroke, dropping her time t-wo seconds. This was good enough to place her 9th overall in the event. Freed also swam the 100 apd 50 yard back in which she ~h~d inthe top 18 in both. She also did her best times ever in the 400 and 800 free relays. Sharon Pearl also did some of her best times in the relays. Swimming individually, she swam well in the 50 back, as well as the 500 freestyle. Pearl swam a very strong 500, placing highly in her heat. Tricha Bowering also had very good times especially in her 200 leg of the 800 free relay. Bowering also swam in the 100 and 50 free events whicli also were the two mo·st popular events. Bowering -finished in the top 25 for these events, a very impressive feat since over forttwere entered in each. Bowering also did per .. sonal best times in the 400 medley relay, helping to put that relay among the top, 18 teams. · Although Boutwell did not swim individually, her times were again her best of the year. She dropped her time a few seconds in ahnost every event, malting it a very successful meet for Boutwell. Overall, the women made a very good showing at the states. They have a lot to be proud of for a team of only four. They did better than expected. They are looking forward to next year when the times should continue to drop. Hopefully, they will also have a few more women to add depth to the team. Look for even better. performances at next. year's States! Support Union Sports SPORT·S Sport.s Talk With SCOTT WYKOFF Sports Staff . As the winter term- winds down, one of Union's two maj~r winter teams prepares for 1ts \second ·season\ while another Dutchmen squad has put the .. pads and skates \on ice\ until next fall. Both Union's varsity basketball· squad and Skating Dutchmen hockey team had hoped t 0 be involved in their respective playoffs at . this juncture in the year. Hoops .realized their pre-season goal and takes a 20-4 regular season record and a five-game winning streak to Potsdam, N.Y., tomorrow to represent Union College in the NCAA Div: III Basketball Tournament. The Skating Dutchmen hockey team failed to realize their playoff aspirations and finished the wi.hter campaign last week with an 8-lo-2 record and an 0-4-l mark in theW. last five games of the seasin. Two teams, with two very in~resting but contrasting stories behind their end--of-the- season fortunes. Coach Bill Scanlon's Dut- chmen basketball team enjoyed the finest regular season in Union College history. Their 20- 4 record has only been matched twice in Union history and those team.s did it with the help of two wills from the ECAC .Upstate N.Y. Tournament. Hoops' next chapter in their storybOok season will be written tomorrow night as Scanlon's squad will seek revenge against Hartwick in the NCAA's first round contest. Union is seeded second wllile Hartwick is third. The Dutchmen began back in the fall with the goal of reaching the NCAA playoffs for the fitst time in Union basketball history .. They went out an.d won the Capital District Tour• nament in the first week of the season by handing then nationally-ranked Albany State a three-overtime setback. The early season momentum continued on into the Manhattanville Tourney a nwnber of weeks later and the Dutchmen defeated nationally ranked St. Andrews ill the first round en route to the tourney championship. Observers looked and tried to explain why Union basketball · was enjoyillg such success. They talked of the veteran backcourt of Clinton and. Wood and all the leadership, both on and off tlie court, that these two gave the squad. Observers also called attention to the · emergence on the Dutchmen's front line of D'Orazio, Doherty, Feigelson, and supersub Bartlett. They were the question roark prior to the season and they have emerged as a major force· that other opponents had. to reckon w;ith. . The Cinderella story rf;ln mto some choppy wtter early in February and the Dutchmen found themselves on a bus riding home from Hamilton having just lost their second game in the last two days. The Hamilton loss matched with the heartbreaker to Hartwick earlier in· the week put the playoff goals of Scanlon's squad in jeopardy. They realized that to make the NCAA's that they had to go out and win all of the remaining five regular season games. Union didn't play their best ball of the season but they did manage . to come out on top in each .of these five games down the wire. Joe Clinton seemed to sum up the situation best as he explained the five game streak in terms that, \I feel everybody showed a lot of guts.\ Guts seems to .be the best word to explain why the Dutchmen hoopers find themselves in Potsdam tomorrow fii.ght with a date with possible destiny. Who knows? At the opposite pole from Union's storybook basketball finish was the end of the season collapse of Union's Skating Dutchmen.· At the start of the y~ar, publications like the Eastern College· Hockey Newsletter predicted that \there's too much talent in Schenectady to miss the (ECAC) playoffs.\ Morrison's Skating · Dutchmen squad played hot and cold for the better half of the first .part of the season and hovered around the .500 mark until the end of January. Sparked by the hot play of both senior center Bra<i Nicholson and freshltuin goalie Wayne McDougall, the. Sk.~ting Dutchmen went on to wm f1ve of their next six games through the home ice thrashing of Western Division leaging Plattsburgh. At that juncture fans of all kinds were not just talkb1g playoffs, but also \hOme ice advantage.\ The playoffs were a long way off and the Skating Dutchmen had oilly one regular season home game left, then it was on the road again for a four game series that would make the difference between the playoffs and another year of just falling short. Ironically, on the same.night that Union's hoop team lost to Hamilton on the road, the Skating Dutchmen also fell victim to a Bowdoin squad at Achilles, 54 in overtime. Unlike the basketball team, the Skating Dutchmen were unable to reboWld quickly from the OT loss and went on to lose on the road to both Elmira and North Adams. The playoff picture looked dark as the Skating Dutchmen travelled to New Haven the next Saturday. Most believed that Union couldn't leave New Haven with .anything but a win to · keep the post- season hopes alive. Union ended up tying New Haven, but this tie coupled with North Adams and Middlebury losses that same night, put the Skatillg Dut- clunen back into the driver's seat for the ECAC .playoff drive. Charlie Morrison commented onthe situation as he remarked they \gave us some breathing room and we had another op- portunity.\ That \other opportunity\ would be the next Tuesday as Union went back on the road to Hamilton to play a team that most reasoned shouldn't even have been on the same ice with Union's Skating Dutclunen. But nobody Informed Hamilton of this and they erupted for five first period goals en route to a 7- 6 upset win that ended up to be the final nail In the coffin for Union's hockey playoff hopes. Morrison described the Dut- chmen'stl-4-1 skid ill terms that, \instead of fillding ways to win,· we were finding ways to lose~\ In retrospect, this last winter ended up being a very exciting season for Union athletics. For basketball, it resulted in · tomorrow night's first round NCAA tournament · ,aame at Potsdam vs. Hartwick. For the Skating Dutchmen, 1982-83 win be a season to forget and the ., task will be for Union's Skating Dutchmen to come back next year with their heads held high. These two contrasting stories go to .show one how unpredictable college sports really are.

The team got a bye in the first round and then shutout RPI's second team as Moore and Eskenazi won in singles and Antiles and Patalita at doubles. After a disappointing 2-1 loss to RPI's first team, Union met undefeated Williams needing a win to force a tie. Eskenazi and Patalita (who was undefeated throughout the entire tour- nament) swept through their doubles match, 104, and Antiles lost a tough 10-8 decision at second singles, leaving it all up to Dwight Moore at first singles. Moore came through, over- coming cramps and a tou~h Williams opponent, lG-7. This created a tie between the two squads which was broken by three 12-point tie-breakers. Again Moore and Patalita- Eskenazi were victorious, each winning their tie-breakers 7-5 and bringing home the tour- nament trophy to Union. This victory marked the first 0 time in many years that Union \b has beaten archrival Williams, ii ·which has won the tournament ~ the previous two years. The o2 team now looks forward to the spring campaign with coach A1 'my game is still improving' Bagnoli at the helm. Sophomore forward Jim Doherty attempts to tap in rebound against Capital District rival R.P.I. The Dutchmen defeated the Engineers by a score of 59-44. Feigelson played injured. The Garnet five will have to stop Tim O'Brien who scored thirty- one points in their last outing including the winning basket in the final seconds. Hartwick was also one of the few teams that outrebounded the Dutchmen this year. Scanlon will be looking to his big men for more \boards\ strength. Scanlon fe.els good about the tournament and believes that his team is ready to play. The winner of the Eastern Regionals plays the winner of the Mid- Atlantic Regional a week from Saturday. The team is healthy and as far as they are con- cerned the pressure is off, Everything appears to be goiiW their way but Coach Scanlon IS leaving no stone unturned. In a phone conversation with the bus company during our interview, Scanlon was overheard to say \Make sure we have Lou. We always win when he drives.\ Final NYS Division Ill Coaches~ Poll 1.
