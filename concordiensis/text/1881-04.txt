Oon1e loyal men of Eighty-one, And raise a joyous strain, We'll sing of pleasures that are gone And those that yet remain. Our four years' course is almost done- So swift has been its stride, That those who couldn't §_afely run were sometimes forced to rride. CHORUS. Uome, classmates, gather round, Our course is nea1ly run, Lift high the cup, and whoop her up! Hurrah for Eighty-one! We've played a little, worked more yet, Had troubles from the first, Eut, as we're Smliors we'll forget, And foolish bubbles burst. Our gladsome days will soon be o'er, From Union we'll depart, Though College life may be no more, We'll still be one at heart.-OIIo. :Bright glea1ning like a beacon star·, Is graduation day. Our \first degree,\ as viewed afar, Drives every care away. When we to U uion bid adieu, With duties fully done, In Alma 1\f ater's grand review She'll praise .old Eighty-one.-Cao. And when in wecUock joys we stand, And sons for learning wnit, We'll lertd each hopeful by the hand Straight to ''the old blue gate.\ Recalling then our times of joy, \V e'll say iu tones of fun- \ Your class 1nay honor Union, boy, Bnt not like Eighty-one.\ CHORUS. Three cheers for Eighty-one! Ancl ere the echoes die, We'll pledge ns all, to oft recall Olcl Eighty-one for aye.

MACDUFF.'S DESIRE FOR REVENGE. Of all the victin1s ot Macbeth, Macduff is the only one, who, to use a modern express- ion, \got even.\ This is perhaps accounted for by the fact that the other objects of Mac- beth's hatred \Vere not left in a condition to permit of their getting even. I should not, in this particular, overlook the humble efforts ot Ban quo, though the pleasure of occupying your ad-versary's seat, and of causing his hair to stand on end, can hardly be called a re- compense for twenty trenched gashes in the \'vithin my sword's length set him; if he 'scape, Heaven forgive him, too,\ 1neaning that if he is defeated, Macbeth is right, and that he will not only forgive Macbeth, bat will pray God to forgive him. Reveng~ had cs>me to be Macduff's creed. It was not Macbeth's death simply that he desired, but Macbeth's death at his hands. It was a sacred duty which he O\ved to his murdered wife and children. His grief had not been of that violent, short-lived charac- ter, which wastes itself in outward manifes- tation, but of that deeper sort w hie h changes the whole nature, and the determi- head.

A college course furnishes a good ground- work of accurate kno\vledge, and students are usually well enough informed as to the subjects which it covers; but their literary -knowledge is not so extensive and complete ·as would naturally be expected fron1 the fact of their living in a literary atmosphere and associating \vith those vvhose interests are centered in that line of thought and \\Vork. This is due in part to the waste or poor man- agement of tin1e, but principally to desultory reading-to carelessness or ignorance in re- gard to what is read. In view of the great mass of .reading mat- ter which is within reach of everybody, it be- comes necessary to have some definite prin- ciple in the selection of the material upon quiring a vivid conception of historical scenes. and events, and ~hey should perhaps be read in connection. Any subject which is particularly interest- ing or of working value it is \Vell to inves.ti- gate, just as it is beneficial to pursue a study beyond the col lege text book. So far, the advance is direct and easy ;. ·but now con1es modern, or rather present litera- ture-those books which are now· publjshing, or have been during the past few years.

Select the artic-les for reading with care, and do not spend too much time on them; the ideas there expressed are not unapt to be false and afterwards refuted. You own judgn1ent ought to decide as to their worth,-but that brings in another and even broader subject. Newspapers are too n1uch read. The only use {or them is to learn political events or important occurrences of the present time. These can ~asily be ascertained by a few minutes spent in glancing over the headings·. Their literature and trivial ±unn y or '•instruc- tive\ parts should be studiously a voided,- because of their harm to the rnemory if for no other reason. Funny remarks and hu- morous works of any kind are not so neces- sary to human existence as is comtnonly supposed. In conclusion, do not fill your brain with weak scribblings \Vhen you have about you the masterpieces of genius. Read standard works, historical \vorks, and pursue special investigations according to inclination; spend enoug-h tirne on magazines to be abreast of current thought; and enough on newspapers . to know the principal points of interest in conversation, and those which will produce important results in the future.

In spite of this modesty the iW£rror is a capital paper--one of the n1ost interest- ing exchanges we have seen lately. lt is full of short, readable sketches, has good lo- cal, exchange, and college columns, and its clipping-s are excellent. If the p.resent nun~­ ber is a fair sample of the Mz'rror if is only necessary for it to adopt the form of tbe ma- _jority of the college journals to take a high position arnong them. The only thing vve feel like criticising is the alliterative heading of so me of its columns-Silver Siftings, Risi- ble Realms, &c. Such. headings are out of date.
