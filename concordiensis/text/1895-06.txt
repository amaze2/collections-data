As I now remember, the raid of John Brown at Harper's Ferry, his capture,. trial and executio}ft, did not cause a ripple of excitement ~mo1~g the students at Union. In the ·Presidential campaign of 1860, resulting in the election of Mr. Lin- coln, we had two parading clubs, about . , equal in numbers, ''The Wide A wakes\ (Republican) and ''The Little Giants\ (Democrats). Both clu b.s were well drilled, and with torches and uniforms we took part in all the parades of our re- spective parties in the cities around Dorp. The clubs presented a fine appearance, conducted then1selves with decorum, and received favorable· comment from the press. Following the election of Mr. Lincoln soon came the convention of the South- ern States, with their resolutions of secession and organization into a Confed- eracy. The newspapers both North and ·. South waged a wordy warfare, which it · is unnecessary to repeat. At this time there weTe at Union about seventy-five · students in the different classes from the The eleven crack athletes from the U njversity of California, and their mana- ger, came up from New York:, where tbey bad been participating in the Mott Raven games, Sunday.

They were brought out of hiding. Flint lock, long, smooth bore, tTiangular bayonet, rusty, probably would kick backwards as effectively as they would shoot forwards, but they were fighting guns nevertheless. So a 1neeting was called in the South Colonade of those who wanted to drill and learn how to fight. About sixty or seventy of us responded, signed a roll and elected the following officers,. viz: Cap- tain, Prof. Elias Peissner; 1st Lieuten- , ant, Chas. N. ·odell, '62; 2nd Lieutenant, N.. B. Schwerin, '63, and .a full 'line of non-commissioned officers. Thus were the Union College Zouaves born. Red flannel trousers and caps, blue jackets, belts and small haversacks constituted the uniforms of the dandy eo1npany. dirt fly; but we learned scarp and coun- terscarp, and parapet, traverse and enl- brasure, and dragged by hand the brush for the abatis. Crowds came fron1 town every evening to see us drill upon the campus. We were pretty good boys and obedient soldiers, but once in a while we broke over. I well remember one even- ing a large crowd of citizens were watch- ing us and we did elegant work. Then Captain Peissner put us in the pasture facing the river for skirrnish drill. The Captain, with the Bugler, stood on the terrace; te-ta-ta-te-ta-right and left deploy, forward, rally hy fours, rally on the centre; rally on the reserve-we did it nicely and on the jun1 p; again came de- ploy and forward, then the Devil broke loose, and with a yell like wild .Arabs, disregarding the bugle sounds, we charged forward, breaking all order of formation and semblan~e of discipline.

We sullenly returned, and would not forn1 line for the officers.. How he lashed us-. English and German, commingled. But soon he straightened us out;. we made apology and all was serene. Probably not a dozen of those watching knew. we had been guilty of a breach of discipline. 'The Spring term closed; separation caine, never to be re- united; and from the play of soldier many soon faced the reality of war. I have no mea,ns of ascertaining how many of our Zouave company enlisted for the war. Of the officers, Captain Peiss- ner and Lieutenant Schwerin were killed at Ohancellorsville, 1st Sergt. Butler was · \'~ounded at Gettysburg. Lieutenant Odell was Oaptajn in the 119th N. Y. Infantry. Of the other officers I an1 not informed. The class of '62 had on its roll all told 135 names, 42 of whom joined the Union service either in the army or navy. Of these Barclay, Esselstyne, Gebhart, McConnell and Nicholas were killed or mortally wounded in battle. While Cor- bin, Crounse, Graham and Roshong died of disease incidental to camp and field. And thus did Union rally to arn1s in '61. At the last college meeting considerable business of importance was transacted. The following men were nominated: For assistant manager of track athletics, Terry, '96 ; Olowe, '96 ; for assistant man- agers of football team, Canfield, '97; Todd, '97. As the nomination of an alumnus for the advisory board, to serve for one year, was necessary, A. J. Dillingham was chosen. Derby, '96, presented the constitution of the musical association, which was adopted unanirnously. TlJe CatiQ p;lay at t~e l.liJiversity of §yra\US~· On 'l,hursday evening, May 1:6, -the University of Syracuse ''brought out\ tl:te Trinummus of Plautus. The per- formance vvas given in the B,astable The- atre in the presence of a ''full house,\ w hieh numbered among its audience not only many leading citizens of the town itse~f and members of the University faculty and student body, but also not a few representatives from more or less distant institutions of education and learning. The play was rendered by members of the Senior Class - two of the1n young women, for Syracuse rejoices in co-education. The parts taken by the young ladies, however, though well done, were not burdensome, as they belonged to the prologue only, or, rather, in them- selves made up the prologue. Women seldom appeared on the ancieut. stage. Their parts were acted by men, and in the Latin comedy consisted of a very few lines, and in some instances of none at alL In the Trinun1mus there are no feminine parts whatever. The women of the play exist only in the imagination. The old men utter wise saws at the ex- pense of their wives, and the young men fall in love. But neither wives nor maidens are presented tq th€ eyes of the audience. The characters are eight in number. Four elderly gen,tlemen, two youths, a slave and a SJcophant or swindler constitute the cast, and it would be difficult to say which of tl1ese was best enacted at Syracuse, so well had the stu- dents, each and all of th en1, been trained both. in the acting and in the delivery of the lines.

Subscribers wiU greatly oblige the n1anagement by remit- ting at once. SoME of the faculty and Schenectady ladies are at work upon a centennial souvenir newspaper which will be pub- lished just :previous to .coinn1encement week. The paper will be replete with interesting data concerning the college, and will be fully illustrated with views of the buildings and grounds, 1nany of which have never been published before. In a word, the paper will be a valuable sou- venir of the centennial. A copy should be in the possession of every Union man. AT LAST -the annual catalogue of the university is out. It is a 208 page vol- ume, bound in the usual manner, with the same contents as previous issues, with the exception of the notice of some impor- tant changes in the curriculum and gen- eral regulations. From the college roster we learn that there are 49 Seniors, 51 Juniors, 49 Sophomores, 99 Freshmen and 15 Eclectics, 1naking a total of 263 students in the college. In the medical school there are 199 students, in the law school 36, and in the school of pharmacy 47, making a total of 545 students in the university. THE team of general athletes fron:t the: University of Cahfornia, which our own sturdy 1nen will have the pleasure of . meeting on the Ridgefield oval to-morrow, has a brilliant record of victories ~ .. hich it will not be in our province to ditn, strive as we may. However, we will thoroughly enjoy meeting California, and we hope to contest the several events in a manner that will make the meet interesting to the spectators, as well to our opponents. Apropos of the subject,. we are positive of two things: we could have beaten VV.,..illiams, we cann:at beat California. And the question arises as to whether it wou~d be more profitable to us to defeat the for1ner, or be ourselves defeated by the latter. Oerta:i11ly it \Vould have been a great pleasure to us to have worsted Williams, especially so since they .always have an excuse fo.r not 1neeting us unless the winning- points are ten to one in their favor. But when the practical advan- tages of association with such a team aS' we will meet to-morrow are considered, all doubts as to our preference are dis- pelled, and we are compelled to admit that an easy victory is not to be con1pared with a graceful defBat.

Since Williarns withdrew from her agreement to 1neet our track and field .team in the annual dual gaines n1uch discussion has arisen as to what .should be Union's ·Course with respect to baseball. The 1natter appea·1s to me vm·y much in this Inan- . ner: We knew that we we>uid beat \\Villian1s in track athletics; so did they. They know that · they will beat us in baseball'; so do we. Undoubt- · edly their action in track athletics was prompted by their foreknowledge of what tb·e issue of a · rneeting would be ; and it will be exactly that same foreknowledge that will prompt Union's action in baseball, but it wHl be a different action. Union . wHl go down to Ridgefield on June lst resolved to put up as good game of ball as she knows bow. The day will go to Willian1s, and she will return to the Berkshires that night with the sati.sfaction of having ''done a big thing,\ and Union will return to the l\fol1awk with the satisfaction of having ''done tl1e square.\ So [ say, and I voice the unanimous sentin1ent of the student body, \no not tit for tat.'' The Fresh1uen celebrated their recent athletic victories in a Inarvelous n1anner a week ago Friday night. Judging fro1n the enthusiastic, nay wild, , expressions of detight that burst in rapturous · peals frorn the Inelodious esophagi of the jnbilants, and ~roke with ever-increasing reverbf'rations against the adan1an tine ears of the few spectators, they were very happy. Someone has said soule- wbere that to be good is to be happy. Would that the rule worked the other way. \Judge\ Brown and \Count Spaghetti\ or, speaking collectively, the Heavenly Twins, were there. The ''Judge\ is always eloquent, and, conditions being favorable, he is n1ore so. Con- ditions were favorable; hence, he was 1nore so. The '·Count\ is never a bad fellow, even though · he is ·encuntbered with an empty title-but that is only sveaking of the title. Cheer up, Spaghetti! Here are two lines which I dedicate to the ''Count\: The chink of the glass and the guzzle of beer Are very bad sounds for young Freshmen to hear. And to the \Judge\: EVERYTHING IN THE LINE OF FlU~]\TI]JU~E, BEDDING, Cl!~PE'lF~, C,U~lF;Rl]\TS, ElF(). SPECIAL FUICES WILL BE . . . . . . • . . . . QUOTED TO STUDENTH' TRADE.

THE CONCORDIENSIS. 11 THE BASE ball gan1e with Willian1s, Saturday, closed the season·; not sohappily as it might have, but not otherwise than the 00NOORDIENSIS prophesied ... · 'True, we would rather have been proven a false prophet upon this particular occasion, but it was not to be. Taken all in all the season has been a suceessful one, for it has n1arked :a decided step in advance in base ball a:t Union. We have played better gan1es against stronger tea1ns than at any previous tirne, and -vvhile there was no pennant. to V\rin, we were playing to put the coUege in a higher class.. We feel that this has been done; thus the season closes. Owing to the ability of Manager Allen the team has been better managed than· ever before; while to Captain Howard belongs the credit that it was the best trained. THE University of Pennsylvania .Courier say~ the trouble with Princeton is that she has a bad attack of colic ca u.sed by eating too much California fru:it. We also ate so1ne of the same fruit, but it failed to distres·s us. .In fact it proved a very palatable dish for a very hot day. The dual meet closed the season of general athletics, and, thanks to Captain Twiford and Manager Barnes, very auspiciously too. The energy djsplayed by the manager in securing a meet with California at the eleventh hour, and after he had been so unfairly dealt with at the hands of Williams, does not surprise us. We have always held that he has done more for track athletics at Union than any one other man. As to the captain, he has the satisfaction of having won the entire confidence and commendation of . the student body. We could have had no better captain. SINCE OUR last issue :sorne important elec;tions have been held upon the several athletic teams. In1mediately after the Willia~ns gar11 e the baseball tearn elected Chas. L. Enders, '96, captain for the ensuing year... The election was a close one, Sullivan, '9·6, being almost an equal choice. Enders prepared for college at the Hart- wick seminary, where he played l>all fot' two years.. Upon entering college he won for himself a place upon the 'varsity nine his first year. Since then he has covered first base every season, always pu~tting up a steady, reliable game. Enders ±sa hard player. He uses his head at all tirnes, and is never ''out of the gam~e. ,, With the proper support he will doubtless captain the strongest base ball tea.rn that has ever V\-rorn the garnet. At a recent n1eeting of the Athletic .Advisory Board the names of Walter L. Terry and Ohas. L. Olowe were submitted by the student body as candidates for assistant Inauager of the track team. Undoubtedly either candida:te would cred- itably fill the office but after due deliber- ation Mr. Terry ·was chosen. Walter L. Terry,_ '96, is a graduate of the Walton high school, where he took an active interest in athletics. During his connection with the college he has closely identified hirnself with the foot- ball team, playing centre rush a large part of last season. In the managernen t of general athletics he will doubtless exhibit the same business and executive ability which has characterized -his efforts in the many offices of trust he has enjoyed. The other appointn1ent was that of Paul Canfield, '97, as assistant n1anager of the· football team. Seniors are now resting.

T'HE EDITORIAL speculation in the last . nu1nber of the University of Pennsyl- h •t· f The May number of the Harvard Monthly con- vania, Courier as to t e compos! lOll 0 tained an excellent editodrul, an abstract from the inter-collegiate team which may be .· whieh I publish below, deerning it particularly sent abroad this su mnJ:er, wiil prove inter- · opportu.ne for this nu1nber. esting reading to Union men. ''In the 1uatter of muphasis our college papers force the outer world inevitably to believe that ''The possibility of the inteY-collegiate athletics are the \Iuost iu~portant interest the tea1n going abroad, or we rnig.bt even say student has, and invariably take pre .. ·edence of the probability for the unofficial advices matters acade1nic and intellectual. ·Thus the papers give otl1ers a picture of· ourselves which ~received have been very favorable-·1nakes • many of us feel to be, while not exactly :false, too speculation as to its compo:Sition most · much out of drawing to be just.

Thus composed Pennsylvania vvould have six representatives, Yale and Har- vard five each, California two and Union and Dartmouth each one. Should Yale withdraw there would be little difficulty · in supplying the places left vacant. Derr could as well represent America as Rich- ards, while Cady would not be missed in the hurdles. Hickok would he the most serious loss, although Knipe and Edgren could do well enough to win without him. To Cross, of course, the sa1ne applies. Sheldon would be a valuable man but Ramsdell with Stickney and Rogers would fail but little of his perforn1ance so that he also 1nigh t be dispensed with. The team thus con1posed would outclass the team last year sent abroad in all the track events, and on the field as well, save only in the broad ju1np. Ameri:ca should be ably represented by such a team.\ An interesting geological expedition was made to the Helderbergs on. Friday and Saturday, May 24- and 25. The party vvas con1posed of Messrs. Bayles, Craver, Blessing and Prof. Prosser. Three large boxes of fossils were secured. A large 1894 fossil which the party was unable to bring home was discovered, in the shape of a good sized snowbank lying in a hollow of the rocks. Prof. Prosser purposes making an extended trip to Clarksville, on the southeastern slope of the mountains. The result _of these expe- ditions will some day be seen in the col- lection that is being made for the museum. The Athletic Advisory Board has made the following appointments ; Manager of track and field athletics, W. L. Terry, '96 ; assistant n1anager of the football team, Paul Canfield, '97.

And I don't believe there was ever a co-ed who could • endure me-unless, perhaps, it was the L~ittle Oo-Ed-so there was certainly no love [ost on either side. Why I should ·. have acquired such a decided dislike to my sorors in runiversitate is beyond me. I think I must have been born prejudiced against them. I can remember hovv my ! uncle used to tell stale jokes about them, :, over which he would laugh imrnoder- :: ateiy; whereat n:ty mother would cease ·her knitting, a11d vow that no daughter . of heTs would ever darken the portals of a co-educational college. She used to say that she would run the educational risk of safely bringing up her daughter at home. But Isabel was taken from us before she had finished at the village school, and so the \risk\ was never run. I bave always had a suspicion tl1at n1y moth~r's aversion to anything in the shape of a co-ed was prompted by her fear lest her only son should becon1e smit- , ten with the seductive 'viles of that st:Donger calibre of thP. gentler sex, and not return to the homestead when his course was finisbed. ·To be sure, I was a first and only son. Like all only sons, ! very much spoiled from over-indulgence; i: ': and, like all first ones, to such an extent ·; experimented upon by too fond parents that I often wonder that even a Little ! Co-Ed could have foundanything worthy of admiration in me. My mother need have had no fear of the captivating co-eds, for upon the day of my matriculation there wasn't an attractive girl in the institu~ion.

Myers is also a member of the 'Varsity foot b,all t~am and the '96 base ball team, and justly deserves the honor of being the best all-round athlete in college. Without the knowledge of his friends, Ed. Sweetland, '98, entered the half-mile race in the athletic sports of the Arbor Athletic Club, at Pleasure Island, on Decoration Day.
