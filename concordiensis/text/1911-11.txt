-, r - The Concordiensis VOL. 35. NOVEMBER 1, 1911 N:O. 5 UNION LOSES TO HOBART Better Playing of Hobart Coup 1 led with Union's Ill Luck Results in l 0·3 Game at Geneva --~--- By W. Earl Weller The bad luck that has been pursuing Union's foot- ball team all the season was again in evidence last Saturday at Geneva, the Garnet losing to Hobart by the score of 3 to 10~ The peerless \Christy\ in his re- cent basebaU stories 1nade free use of the word Dewey Scores on D·rop. Kick Union's three points were earned a ]ew minutes later. A twenty yard gain by Sarvey around. left end br-ought the ball to Hobart's thirty yard line. A skin tackle play and a straight Hne buck left th€ baH still on the thirty yard line. Dewey signaled for a drop kick. The line held for what seemed an in. terminably long time while Dewey carefu:l1ly gauged tbte distance to the goal. Finally two of the Hobart men filtered through the line, but Dewey was ready and the ball rose right under the arms of one of the would be \breaks\, meaning thereby those small incidents of blockers and went over the cr:oss bar for as pretty a the game that are as likely to favor one team as the field goal as one will ever see_ other. Football affords about ten times as many chances for these aforesaid \breaks'' as baseball and, if we except the single fumble that gave Union a chance to score in the Wesleyan game, there has not been a single instance in the whole season thus far that has broken in favor of the Garnet. The ball has al- ways insisted on bounding the wrong way, passes and kicks have developed some most peculiar kink at the very last moment, and men have been injured when they were needed the most, until it is a wonder that the team has not developed a case of the most malig- nant demoralization. On the contrary the team has battled to the very end, each man showing a spirit n1uch to be commended. Bayless Scores Touchdown The team, because of the lack of experience that comes only in actual games, is slow in getting started. This ~lowness accounts for Hobart's first touchdown,· During the course of the game the blue and gold team gained about 175 yards, nearly 100 of these yards he- inz gained in the first five minutes of play. Twice during this brief period Hobart pushed the ball towards Union's goal until only a few feet separated it from the counting line and twice the Garnet line held and recovered the ball on downs. After the line had thrown back the Hobart attack the second time, Sarvey dropped back for a punt from behind his own goal line. The kick started in the best of shape and landed on Union's thirty-five yard line. Bay less, be- hind fine interference, carried the ball back over the line for a touchdown. During the next two periods the game was even up. Wood and Barmore were the only oRes who could make any ground for Hobart, Bayless being able to do nothing with the Garnet line. In tb.e second period of the first half Dewey injured his shoUilder. He pluckily fought it out until the end of the period, bat had to give way to McDermott at the beginning of the second half. This injury to Dewey is only another instance of the ill luck that has been Union's con.stant com- panion this season and with Fairbairn out of the game is probably as serious a thing as could well happen to the Garnet team. McDermott ran the tean1 with lots of vim for the two periods that he was at the heln1 and played the hardest sort of a game h~imself. Riley Stops Touchdown Storey, Morgan and Hokerk aU had a chance to show their mettle and they aH ~made good. Storey and Morgan are going to be heard from before they grad1.iate and Hokerk gives every pro-mise of develop- ing into a first class lineman. \Ned\ Riley 1nade a nervy tackle in the last period, spiUing Barmore w htn a touchdown seemed but a matter of seconds. It was . p·erilously near to being a flying tackle, but apparently escaped the notice of the officials_ Hobart's Second Touchdow:n Hobart's second touchdown was on one of those \breaks\ that were tnentioned in the early part of the present chapter. Bayless tried an onside kick. The ball went high and hit the g1·ound inside the 20 yard zone. Sarvey was standing with h.is back to the Ho- bart goal either waiting for the ball himself orwaiting

8 THE CONCORDIENSIS to form an interference for Coward. Bayless, foUow· ing the kick and before the baU had touched t:h:e ground beyond the twenty yard limit, pushed Sarvc.y out of the way breaking up Union's play and giving Barm<n~e -the opportunity of dropping on the ball with- in a few yards of Union's goat From the sidelines the play seemed iHegal. Two straight bucks took the ball over. Sidte'line Ruiles Ignored Several times during the course of the game the of- ficials were obliged to stop the game and ask the spec- tators to leave the field of play, the side lines being utterly ignored. There was also a decided tendency to violate the rule that prohibits coaching from ~the side lines. Had the rule been enforced Hobart would have been penalized somewheres in the neighborhqod of a mi:1e and a half on a rough guess. The teams lined up as follows: HOBART UNION Hotchkin Starbuck, Storey left end Robbins SeUnow left tackle Skinner Jasoloski left guard . Mac Cain Vedder center Van :lngen Hokerk, Page right guard Warner Ulrich right tackle Hall Morgan, Riley right end Wood Dewey, McDermott quarter Barker Sarvey left half .Barmore Coward right half Bayless. Wood full Time of periods-12 minutes. Touchdowns-Eay- less, (2). Field goals-., Dewey. Officials-Foley (C()r- nell) referee; Wilkinson (Syracuse) umpire; Kane (Physical Director, Geneva High School), field judge; Sparks (Bowdoin) head linesman. ~ DRs RICHMOND SPEAKS AT HIGH SCHOOL EXERCISES On Saturday Dr .. Richmond spoke at the laying of the corner stone of the new Schenectady high school building. His subject was \Design in Education.;' On Wednesday evening he will deliver an address before theo Yale chapter of Phi Beta Kappa on \Jacobite Bal- lads of Scotland.\ UNDERCLASS FOOTBALL ELEVENS SUCCESSFUL The sophomore football team defeated the Amster- dam high school team in a game October 20th by the sco:re 6-0. The use of several oi the varsity's trick plays netted great gains for the sophon1ores throughout the game. The freshman team went to Troy October 21st and played the Lansingburg high school eleven, winning by the score of 6-0. The game was played at Rens- selaer Park in a drizzling rain which made it espec- ially hard to do much straight football work. Last Saturday the team Jirlayed the Gloversviile high school on the campus. The score was 45-6. Friday, November 3d, the team will go to Williams- town to play the Will'iams Ccllege freshman team. In football scrimmage between the freshman team and the varsity scrubs last Monday afternoon, Frank Smith, the freshmen's fast full back had his knee fractured. Thomas C. Rankin has been elected captain of the freshman track team. He is organizing the men of ability in track work,in order to be in the proper trim for the inter-class meet on November 7th . H ALBANY DEPARTMENTS TO BE ON THE CAMPUS SATURDAY In spite of the fact that there is to be no official University Day at Union this year there will be a large number of the students of the Albany departments on the campus Saturday to witness the football game with Rochester. This was the day upon which the an- nual University Day functions were to be held, but owing to the fact that many of the students will be at home to vote it was thought inadvisab!e to make the event as big a function as usual. However, a general invitation has been issued to the law, medical, and pharmacy students and it is expected that there will be a hundred or more on the campus. The football managen1ent has announced that there will be no admission charged for the visitors from the Albany departments. The freshman parade is to be held at this time, starting from the,campus-for its line of march about the city at two· o'clock.'· There will be a parade about the campus and photographs of the individual stunts and a large group picture will be taken by White, the college photographer, and the Gazette photographer. The entire student body as well as the members of the Albany departments will be expected to be in line for the parade.

RICHM;OND AT YALE Dr. Richmond left last Tuesday night for New York. There he held a confere11ce with Mr. Post the archi- tect for the new gymnasi ttm and left later on Wed- nesday for New Haven. Wednesday evening, Dr. Richmond addresses the Phi Beta Kappa society of Yale University on the 'Subaect: ''Jacobite Ballads of Scotland.'' While in New HaVren the president is the guest of Prof. Reed of that university. Thursday Dr. Richmond meets with the trustees in New York to con- sider some details of the new gymnasium movement. ~ THE SOCIAL ;£VIL DISCUSSED Dr. James Peterson, a p:tominent New York phy- sician and one who. has, made a study of social con- ditions, gave an interesting talk at chapel Monday noon upon the subj,ect of \The Social Evil\. Dr·. Peterson spoke \straight from the shoulder\ as he ex- pressed it, and gave a brief bl.,lt comprel'!ensive ac- count of one of the nation's most vital subjects. The facts brought out in the course of his remarks were astounding to one unfamiliar with present conditions and the students were greatly impressed with his in- formation. As a correction for the social evil Dr. Peterson said that education is the basic method. H 200 TO GO TO HAMILTON The student body was urged at college meeting to .. . . . attend the Hamilton game at Clinton, November 11th. Cards were signed by each student stating whether or not he would go. About one hundred and seventy- five have signed the cards to go, but it is expected that the number will ·be raised to at least two hun- dred.

McCormick, '14. - Publication Office - The New-Hes-Mor Printing Co., Schenectady Railway Waiting Room Building, 420 State Street The questiQn of the renewal of Union athletic relations with the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute of Troy has again come up for consideration by the student authorities ·of the respective institutions. In an interview with two stuqept_ ·:members· of the athletic council of- the Institute the Tro- jans' side of the recent controversy, which, by the way, was foolishly carried on through the newspapers, was learned. It was through ignorance of the existing conditions between Union~and R. P. 1.~ it is claimed, that the mana- ger of the latter's track team endeav.ored to ctrrange a meet date with Union. Shortly after, an unauthorized story appeared in the Knickerbocker Press, which aroused indignation among the Rensselaer students. This was fol- lowed by an erroneous story in the Troy Times, which gave an alleged inter- view with a member of the Institute athletic council. The Times' story appeared to be a ncom.e-back at any cost\ article and reflected ,discreditably upon Union. The HinterviewH is explained by the student quoted as being a ·. ~. d story obtained by a Times' reporter, who mingled incognito among a group of R. P. I. students while they were discussing the situation. The sen-

THE CONCORDIENSIS ... ----·- --····-- -.:_ -··--· · ____ - ---··-. ·······--===-========= sational facts thus .gathered were construed to represent an interview. Thus the matter stands and the question is now, ~~shall athletic rela- tions with the neighboring institution be renewed?H There is one argument for so doing, namely, that: it would be a financial advantage for both institu- tions. But is there another argument in its favor? The recent newspaper articles, correct or incorrect, ·cannot hide the intense feeling of hostility towards Union that exists among R. P. I. students. Reasons, which cast reflection upon Union's stand in regard to the severed relations, have been spread abroad by Institute men and these are simHar to those expressed in the Times' story. Again, R. P. I. students, witnessing games on the campusy have noticeably supported Union's opponents. Union students have been rightly incensed at such exhibitions of uncalled for enmity and they took their stand in the matter when two years ago they unanimously defeated a motion to renew relations with R. P. I. Under existing conditions would it be wise to renew the relations at this time? Would not athletic contests result in exhibitions of poor sports- manship? The R. P. I. students themselves admit that it would not be ~~safe\ to begin renewed relations with a football game. They suggest a 1nilder form of athletics, such as a track meet; but with the possible ex- ception of track would there ever be a time when feeling would sufficiently be quelled to permit athletic contests to be carried on in a sportsmanlike n1anner? That Union is not alone in her feeling that severed athletic relations with R. P. I. are wise is shown by the fact that another institution, one of Union's annual opponents, is considering the breaking of relations with the Troy institution. Does it seem advisable to drop one game from each of Union's athletic schedules to take on a contest with R. P. I.? R. P. I. has presented its side of the matter. Union's side is known to every student. It is evident that there is intense antagonism existing·.~ between the two institutions. The renewal of relations will bring only ·a: financial gain and there are many reasons, obvious to one who looks into the matter, why relations should not be renewed.

Crane Again! ---- Do College Students Drink? !hose charges of intemperance against college students, lodged by Mr. Crane of Chicago, caused no little stir, but the de- nials were so prompt and emphatic that we may already consider the incident closed. Nevertheless, in order to make assurance doubly sure, we have secured a few interviews on the subject from au- thoritative sources. \It is outrageous,\ said a well-known Harvard Freshman. \Drink is absolutely unknown at Harvard. There may be an occasional student who receives a little unfern1ented grape juice from home, but even this is rare and is discountenanced, not only by the faculty, but by the stu- dent body as well.\ -A Sophomore at Yale who is noted for his extreme caution was equally empha- tic as to the situatign in New Haven. Ile said: \I will adp.:ti t that there was a time at Yale when we sang drinking songs, such as 'Give Us a Drink,. Bartender,' but it was only in fun, and no bartender ever paid the slightest attention to it. There is no case recorded where a Yale student, either ·drunk or sober, ever entered a saloon, and l doubt if many of them, lin- guists though they be, know the meaning of the word stein.\ One of the oldest living undergraduates at Princeton was seen and induced to talk for pubiication. ''Perfect nonsense,\ he said in disgust. \l cannot believe that Mr. Crane was in earnest. I will not say there is no drinking at an at Princeton, but the better class of students do not in- dulge. Of course, it is well known by so- ciologists that poor people are intemper- ate. Princeton is probably no exception, and I have heard that those students wbo have to work their way are drunk most of the time. The rich students, however, are atstemious. Indeed, I may say they are excessively abstemious.\-Life. AND AT UNION Yes, the small colleges may also claim surprising temperance in the use of liquor. At Union it is be- lieved that an imperceptible per cent of the students indulge at all, and these are ·men who have doubtless been reared 1n families where intoxicants have been used on the table. For the prevention of student in- temperance there was recently a gathering of Sche- nectady ladies, gentlemen, and bartenders, which amended the local liquor dispensers' by-laws· to read that only malt liquors may be given undergraduates and further that not more than one-half liter of such intoxicants may be bought, charged or received free by one student during each of the college terms. 0 MUSICAL CLUBS The musical club will probably be smaller than usual this year as there will be only six men to a part. This arrangement makes it possible for the dub to take more extended trips. The main number of the program will be \Bar- carolle\ from the \Tales of Hoffman.\ The \Rosary\ will also be sung and \Home Sweet Home\ will prob- ably be the closing selection. The latter will be ren- dered at the suggestion of Dr. Richmond in honor of • its author, John Howard Payne, class 1810.

PROF~~· HOFFMAN'.S IMPRESSIONS up-to-date r.epresentative but perhaps the most promi~ OF' THE CONGRESS OF RACES nent leader on the floor of the congress was Dr. Felix [From the Schenectady' Gazette] Dr. Frank :S. Ho-ffman of Union College, who has recently returned fron1 the Congress of races in Lon- Adler, professor of social ethics in Columbia U ni ver- sity, New York city. He gave a most impressive ad- dress on the subject., 'The Fundamental Principle of don, was interviewed last night by a representative of Inter-Racial Ethics' in which he took the position that The Gazette in regard to the impressions he received at that epoch-making event. He said in part: \The congress met in London the last week in July under the auspices of the University of London. Lord Weardale was president and among the vice-presidEnts were: The Archbishop of York, Lord Morley, Lord Curzon, Lord Avebury, the Speaker of the House of Commons, the Lord Mayor of London, and the heads of all the British universities. \Over twenty races were represented and a major- ity of the members of the permanent court of arbi- tration at The Hague were officially present. The object of the_ -congress was to discuss in the light of modern science and the modern conscience, the gen- eral relation existing between the people of the west and the ,east with a view to encouragingbetween them a more perfect understanding, a more friendly feeling and a heartier co-operation for the progress and peace of the world. Representatives of the chief races of the world met . together on terms of equality, which has never happened before in human history. The idea of the brotherhood of the peoples of the globe has never before had such a concrete realization. \It may be truly said that the nations of the east are vieing with each other to advance along the same lines as people of the west. All are seeking to pro- gress in the same system of science and essentially the same ideas of education, politics and of commerce. ''Lord Weardale's speech of welcome was given In both English and French to a company of over 2,000 people gathered together fro1n all quarters of the earth. Most of the addresses were given in English but many spoke in the language of their own land, an interpreter translating their speeches into English af- ter they had ceased. The 1nastery of the English lan- guage by many of those coming from non-English speaking countries was a great surprise to everybody present. Some of the finest speeches by men fron1 such countries as Norway, Finland, China and Japan were given in English with a grace of diction that would be the envy of any orator of our own day and 'the app·eai's to sentiment and to the progress of dem- ocracy were not in themselves safeguard against war.~ 'It was not peace in itself we should keep in view, but the objects to be secured by peace. The ideal prin- ciple of international relations, he maintained con- sisted in the proper organization of these velations. The exchange between different types of culture should serve to bring to light weak points in each and ought to lead to their mutual improvement. The civilized nations of the earth -should treat backward races with more humanity and intelligence not for the benefit of those races alone but for the sake ·of the whole -of mankind. It was the duty of the civilized man to make a careful study of the -customs, manners, laws and religions of the people to whom they sot1.ght to bring the blessings of modern civilization.' \Another very prominent speaker at the congress ~as Zangwill, the fan1ous writer who speaking for the Jews strongly advocated the policy of England and Germany should unite together in making a horne un- der the Turkish flag for the Jew in his original birth- place, 'For,' said he, 'nothing would more hasten the world.'s peace and establish in the . heart of the old world a bridge of civilization between the east and the west.' \Mrs. Anna Bessant, one of the n1ost unique and co1nn1anc·ing personalities of our day, made a most impressive speech in favor of better social intercourse between the English and the Hindoos, which she claimed would be a solution of many of the crying ills of India. The black people had a vigorous and able representative in the person of Professor W. E. B. Du Bois of Atlanta University. His subject was \The Modern Conscience in Relation to Racial Questions.\ Dr. DuBois is a n1ulatto and as he himself said the descendant of five generations of mulattoes. He claimed that it was the modern world that had dis- covered or created the problem of color and that the time is not far distant when the problem will disap- pear.' The Manchester Guardian, one of the principal papers published in England, said of his address a day country. after its delivery; 'It was so simple that an intelligent ''O~e of the most prominen~ men in the congress . child could have followed the argument, yet ithandled was the Chinese ambassador to the court of St. James. so clearly the fundamental issue that no specialist The young Turkish party was admirably represented who heard it could have refused his tribute of ad- by a very able delegation. Persia also had a modern miration. As a piece of exposition, as an example of

UNlON.'S .OPPONENTS The conference lasted for a week meeting twice each day. Receptions and ·garden parties we:ve of daily occurrence. The most brilliant reception was given by Mrs. Elmer Black of Chicago, in one .of the largest hotei:s of London, where were present r:epre- sentatives of the most aristocratic families of England, as well as. men of science and learning and influence from all walks of life. Dr. Hoffman concluded by saying that \this meeting was the first of a series of congresses to be held with a view of advancing a more c,emplete understanding of the aims and ambitions of the different races of the earth.\ \The one common note in all of the meetings of the congress was, said he, \that the world is one and whatever difference may exist in race and color, all are to be recognized as members of one common human family with common aims and.' common as- pirations.\ NEW ROADS ON CAMPUS There are several new changes in the eampus to be made before next spring. A new macadam road ex- tending from the Payne memorial gate to the college office is to be commenced at once. A cement side- walk, six feet wide is to be built extending from the Blue gate to the north end of south college. 'Dhe road which now runs to the south end of south college is to be extended in front of the building and around south colonade. This road will be built just inside the row of elm tr.ees which stand at the south end of the foot- hall field and will extend to meet the new macadum road from the memorial gate. This change will make the roads around north and south colleges correspond to each other.

FOR ROCHESTER ------- Riley and Sarvey star for Union but the Garnet is unable to make a score-- On- side ·kick used for gains by 'Union . Yards gained by rushing First downs Distance Pun ted Forward pass tried Forward pass ~uccessful Ground gained by forward pass Penalties Rochester Union 258 yds. 14 81 yds. 7 235 yds. 380 yds. 8 7 3 43 yds. 55 yds. 3 54 yds. 60 yds. By W. EARL WELLER Right halfback Brown's wonderful kicking defeated Union's eleven on the campus on Saturday by the score of 12 to 0. Eight times in the course of the four periods the Rochester team brought the ball within kicking distance of the Garnet goal and four times Brown lifted it over the bar. Rochester appar- ently had a shade the better of the Union eleven, but it is more than doubtful that the bl~e and gold team could have pushed the ball over for a touchdown. Twice during the game there were periods when it looked like a touchdown, once for Rochester and once for Union. Rochester's big chance to cross Union's line came in the last period when the visitors crowded the ball to Union's fifteen yard line only to lose it on downs. Union's one chance came early in the third period, when an on-side kick and a forward pass brought the ball within ten yards of Rochester's goal. The Union backs could. not put it over and Rochester S)on h:td the leather out of the dangerous territory. Brown the Star Brown was, of course, the bright star of the game because of his kicking ability. Three out of the four goals scored by the Rochester halfback were just a team.. RHey smashed plays that came his way and was given up as a bad job by the Rochester quarter. Twice at least his 117 pounds sailed blythly into the perfect interference of the Rochester attack to nail the runner for a loss. He also covered all sorts of ground under kicks and recovered a couple of on-side kicks for :respectable gains. Sarvey was Union's principal ground gainer. In the third period he dodged through the :tine after receiving a forward pass and carried the ball forty yards into Rochester territory. The Garnet Solve Plays A double pass in the first quarter came near to re- sulting disastrously for Union, the whole line and the larger part of the secondary defense being drawn over to the right on a fake while the real play was going around the left. That was the last time that a trick play had any chance of working, double passes, fake kicks and forward passes all looking alike to the Union defense. Union Uses On-side Kick Union made good use of the on-side kick gaining a majority of its distance by the use of this play. Throughout the game Rochester gaine::l a total of 266 yards, while Union gained 251. Rochester tried eight forward passes, succeeding three times for a total of 43 yards. Union tried the forward pass seven times and also succeeded three times for a total of 54 yards. The visitors were penalized eight times, the distance aggregating 85 yards, while Union suffered six penalties for a total of 55 yards. All penalties were for technical -offences and not for rough or dirty playing. Union punted considerably more than the Rochester team the totals being Union 380 yards, Rochester 235 yards. The teams lined up as follows: Rochester (12]. Union (0). Left End G. Long, E. Long Riley, Storey Left Tackle little short of the marvelous. One of the goals was Koegler (Capt.) Sell now (Capt.) scored on a drop kick, the kicker standing on Union's 45 yard line or only ten yards inside Union's territory. Gay The Ro<;hester ends also played high grade football.

If certain men feel that the R. P.

Let the Union boys exert an influence i<or good outside their own sphere. Perhaps they can teach us a few things along the line. In a word, Mr. Editor, the renewal of athletic relations could do no harm and the chances are in favor of doing much good. Yours truly, ONE INTERESTED EDITOR'S N OTE:-Further discussion of the matter especiarlly relative to this letter is found in an edi- :torial in this issue of THE CONCORDIENSIS. ~ SMOKING A PRIVILEGE· ' NOT A RIGHT A signifi.can t sign sometimes appears in public places: \Gentlemen will not smoke here; others must not.\ Unfortunately, all smokers are not gentlemen; and of late years men who smoke without regard to the comfort of others have so greatly increased in numbers that it is not surprising that an organization has been forn1ed to limit smoking to places where women and non-~rnokers are not disturbed by it. Formally in this country smoking was regarded as a privilege and was indulged in in public places only where it was specifically permitted; now it is regarded as a right and is indulged in in public in all places EDITOR OF C()NCORDIENSIS:-lt has be2n n1y pl2asure to read yaur editorial regarding the renewal of athletic rElations with the RenssElaer Polytechnic Institu.,te. 'To be frank I belie-ve you are taking a wrong stand in this matter. It would seen1 by your article that a little newspaper controversy and the stand taken by a most insignifica~t minority of R. P _I. men are to decide this question. But such should not be the case, It is my pleasure to be personally acquainted ~ith a nun1ber of these students of Troy where it is not specifically forbidden. We have ex- changed the old attitude of consideration for women in this 1natter for the indifference to the comfort of wcrnen which r;revails in scme :r;arts of Eurcpe. In public buildings, hotEls, railway and ferry stations, dining cars, and many other places where the majority do not smoke clouds of tobacco smoke offend and dis- tress w01nen and disgust smokers who have the in- stincts and habits of gentlen1e11. In large restaurants there are rooms set apart for smokers, but of late years no public room is safe from their encroachment. It is high time rigorously to define smoking as a privilege, not a right. and better men I have not n1et. They are men who rank as leaders in their in 3titute and by such JJn.en rather tha1Q by an unsportmanlike and harml2ss few shoul::l Renssel~er be judged. I have no doubt Mr. Editor but what a certain per cent of such 1nen could be found at Union. Talking with several Pcly- technic 1nen 'I learned that they were most anxious to see athletic relations renewed. Such a base reason as financial ga:ins to the respective schools was not mentione<L It was their opinion as well as 1ny own that closer relations between two schools so closely situated ·C()Dld not fail to better both. Perhaps it would bene::fit the engineers more than the classical students :in_asmuch as they- would be brought in contact witll the R. P. I. beys.

THE CONCORD1BNSIS ~ttinu ctno ~· .J. ~· J\fq1£tir '~elations In the current issue of THE CON:CORDIENSIS is a communication from one who favors the renewal of athletic relations between Union and Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. In his tetter the writer seems to err in a fundamental point, doubtless due to the [act that he has a few personal friends in the Troy institution. Instead of the attitude of the \most insignificant minor~ty of R. P. I. men\ it is the attitude of the significant majority that is to be considered. If the attitude of the minority were held by the majority there would be a second reason for renewing relations. There are a few men ~t the institute who consider the affair in the right light but the attitude of the students in general is such as to make athletic contests between Union and R. P. I. nothing short of disgracefuL We agree with the writer when he says that the newspaper articles helped to decide the matter. Even though the press reports are incorrect there is some foundation for them and the feeling underlying the articles is but thinly veiled. We take exception to the writer's conception of \financial gain\ in renewed relations as being base. Both institutions consider this an impor- tant factor, but it is not wise for Union to let this one argument influence action in the matter. Union would not presume to insult the Troy institution by taking the attitude as suggested by the writer, that ren_ewed relations would afford an opportunity of showing R. P. I. men how to be sportsmanlike. There has been shown no advantage to be obtained by renewed relations and the arguments for not renewing relations remain. Union should not drop one of its annual opponents to take on a contest with an institution that another college is considering breaking with because of unsportsmanlike treatment at·the hands of an R. P. I. team. With Other Colleges Stanford has just cele- brated its twentieth anni- versary. McCaa, coach of the New Hampshire football team, has been called back to his alma mater, Lafayette College, and will leave for there as soon as his successor at New Hampshire is appointed. The Daily Californian has started a . cam1Jaign for the widespread learning of the University songs, and prints on the front page '\Boola.\ The tune is an exact dupli- cate of the Yale \Bo()la\with a slight variation in the words. Virginia has successfully used the honor sysie:m in exams since 1842. Because they had to part with their much beloved mus- taches, the seniors at ·Alle- gheny have put out a fare- well number of the college paper which is called \Whis- kers.\ One thousand of the Uni- versity of Kansas students are self-supporting. The sophomores at Colum- bia have adopted a class hat. A freshman won the cross country run at Columbia. Edward L. Perkins has given $24,000 to Williams. 11

.! 12 THE CONCORDIENSIS SONGS FOR HAMIL TO'N GAME Following are the list of \swipes\ that will be used at the Union-Hamilton gan1e. They have been printed on pamphlets and distributed by the Press Club. Every student should learn them before Satur- day and not a copy of them should be seen at the game. TuN.e-· .

Robert, Robert, con1e be sensible! Trash from you is indefensible. Life you've seen, and thought a bit of it; Treat of that and make a hit of it!

The members dined at Silliman at noon and in the afternoon attended the regular meeting in the chapel. Th<:.re was a very good attendance and over a hundred people thrcnged to the old college hall. The program was filled with enjoyable and educational features and was ccnsider- ed a thorough success. The meeting was opened by Dr. Richmond, who gave the address of welcome. Prof. George Dwight Kellogg, Ph. D., of the college faculty, read a forty minute paper on \Classical Studies as an Aid to Liter- ary Appreciation.\ He showed how much the modern school of learning is in debt to the now ancient langu- ages of Greece and Rome and how essential it is for a scholar who would be thoroughly the master of history and literature to first assimilate and comprehend as well as enjoy the beauty of these two rich reahns of literary effnrt. \If among other things,\ said Prof. Kellogg, \education has for its function the inducting of the younger generation into the accumulated traditions of the race, then in a liberal education, the combined thought and life of Greece and Rome as expressed in their monuments and literature must ~occupy an Im- ·portant place.\ -- - - ---- -- ----- ------ --- Principal Oscar D. Robinson, the first president of the club, was eulogized by Morris Block of the Albany High School, and Prof. John Ira Bennet, A. M., spoke of the late Sidney G. Ashmore. The club inspected the building and took in the freshman parade and then went over to the football field and witnessed the game with Rochester. g SOPHOMORES VICTORIOUS IN ANNUAL UNDERCLASS SPORTS The annual underclass sports were held Wednesday afternoon in spite of the intermittent showers that swept across the campus before a biting west wind. The sophomore class was victorious, winning by a total score of 75 points to the freshman's 25. The football game between the two classes was the event of the day and was won by the second year men. The score was 6 - 0. The touchdown was made in the first period and was made possible by an intercepted forward pass that was tried by the freshmen in the first few minutes of play.

The· Concordiensis VOL. 35. NOVEMBER 15, 1911 NO.7 HAMILTON DEFEATS !UNION, Ind·ividual Playing -- RUey played the hardest sort of a game at end, Buff and Blue Outplay the Garnet Team.. Hamilton breaking the interference mos~ effectively. Wood also Uses Straight Line Work. Un.iou. Trie& Forward played a good gatne on the defensive. Fairbairn ran Pass the team well and more than ou tpunted Knox. The By W. Earl Weller Hamilton earned a 19 to 0 victory over Union at Clinton on Saturday. The Union line that so success- ful'ly withstood the Rochester attack melted and crambled before the dash and speed of the buff and blue backs. Hamilton tried very few trick plays, de- pending almost entirely on straig:llt line work and an occasional end run for their gains. Union on the other hand because of the sturdiness of the Hamilton- ian defense used the forward pass and the on-side kick considerably. Hamilton. Takes a :Brace Captain Kn~x gave a pretty exhibition of leadership in the first period. A couple of long gain:; by Union ' had brought the ball deep into Ham.ilton territory and the blue and buff team was on the very verge of de- moralization. Knox realized the fact and was every- where back of his line, steadying first one man and then another until the tean1 cmne cnce more into its own. Not one person in twenty-five probably saw the in:;tance and yet it was one of the vital things of the gan1e, one of the things that 1nakes football worth while. Hamilton Line Impregnable Hamilton all through the season has been watching Sarvey. The preval.::nt idea was that the l~ft half of . the U nic n tean1 was the n1an to be guarded against. 'The whole blue defense was built around this theory and it worked. Sarvey played 11ntil he could scarcely stand, but he was not givEn a chance after the first period. His line could not tnake hol2s for hin1 through the Hamilton line and on end run3 he always found l1is way blocked by at least two of the secondary de- fense who were playing way over towards the end of the line. On a couple occasiqns when Sarvey did man- . . . . . age to slip through the , line he more than justified Hamilton's idea that he wa~ a dangerous man with the ball. Union team was so decisively outplayed, however, that the little quarter had small chance to show any re- sourcefulness in directing the attack. The absence of Dewey and Starbuck from the game was a decided handicap to Union. Both n1en started in the game but were unable to continue. A Lesson for Union The one lesson that Union may and should learn from the game is that the garnet team must have a backfield. Huthsteiner, Hepsberg and Smith of the freshman team will help out next season but more are needed and it is up to every loyal son of Union to bring back sorneone of whom the college can be proud, someone ·who may fit into that backfield. Union has every honest advantage to offer a high school man, good fellowship, a good curriculum and traditions and a history of which any ccllege may justly be proud. We want good teams and good teams are only made possible by good men. The good men are available, it only needs a little loyalty and spirit on the part of the undergraduates to get them here. Now is the time to begin \rooting\ for the 1913 tean1. The teams lined up as follows: HAMILTON Position UNION left end Leavenworth Riley left tackle D. Root Wood left guard Thon1pson Sell now center Fear Hokerk right guard Potter Veeder right tackle Laforce Ulrich right end Eddy Storey quarter Knox Fairbairn left half Robinson Sarvey

After the Stevens game the Kappa Alpha, Psi Upsilon and Delta Upsilon fraternity each enter- tained their friends at dinner and afterwards at an in- formal dance. On October 28 th.e Alpha Delta Phi held an informal dance at the chapter house. The Pyramid Club held a dance at the boat house on Fri- day evening, November 3. The Sigma Phi gave an informal dance on Monday evening, November 6, and the Chi Psi held a tea after the Rochester game and an informal dance on the following Monday evening.

FOREIGN CLASSES STARTED The Christian Association has started the first of its foreign classes under the auspices of the Lithuanian Educational Society, a social organization. Two classes have been organized, one in English taught by Hutch- ens with Hauenstein as substitute, the other in civics and history taught by Untermyer with Ker as substi- tute. Both classes meet on Monday and Wednesday evenings at the club rooms of the society on Windsor Terrace. A class in arithmetic will be forn1ed in the near future, but its teacher? have not yet been defi- nitely decided upon. Last year there were several classes for Lithuanians and they have been the most enthusiastic about the work. Classes are soon to be formed for other nationalities, however, especially for the Italians and Poles- ATHLETIC RELATIONS WITH R. P.

The· N ew-Hes-Mor Printing Co., Schenectady Railway Waiting Room Building, 420 State Street The attention of THE CONCORDIENSIS has been brought to the mat- ter of failure on the part of the managements of athletic teams on The Hill to recognize privileges usually accorded editorial representatives of local papers. Several instances of lack of newspaper courtesy on the part of ticket sellers, which have resulted in embarrassing situations for the re- porter, have been brought to our notice. Such occurrences should not take place, for aside from the fact that it is not the part of gentlemen, if this can be subordinated, it is not for the best interest of the college to offend news- paper men in the slightest degree. There is what we might call an unwritten law, which defines the pre- rogatives of a rp_ember of the editorial and reportorial staffs of a newspaper as almost without limit in regard to admittance to public places without pay. Of course the pass system controls this matter to a degree; but a too limited distribution of passes leaves room for the· rights of reporters to be

THE CONCORDIENSIS asserted. This last point is the origin of the unfavorable criticism on tbe part of local newspaper men. A local theater provides the papers a minimum of thirty-six passes a week, and the aver.age circus aUows from sixty to a hundred passes, and at the same time they are paying double rate for advertising, which amounts to a large sum of money·actualiy paid into the newspaper offi.ce. City ath- letic teams give an average of ten 1iasses-.to.locai contests and the manage- ments always admit free any rep:r:esentatives of the local papers without a . - pass. In addition they expend money for newspaper .-advertising. The Union football management issues eight passes for each g~eto~~ocal . morning paper. , ; \ ( ....

The first two periods were covered play by play and a brief summary of the remaining periods with sev- eral of the more important plays in detail completed the story. Besides the compre- . r'l.. hensive story on the game the paper contained sched- ules with scores of Hamil- ton's and Union's football season, the Union-Hamilton football scores since the be- ginning of relations, the train service to Schenectady, and matters of general interest relating to life at Hamilton. The paper contained four pages and carried no adver- tisements. The board of editors are to be congratulated upon their enterprise and success. Only those directly connect- ed with newspaper work can appreciate the amount of work necessary to write the story, put it in type, proof- read it and run it off on the press in order to have it on sale at the close of the game. The magazine section of last Sunday's Albany \Knic- kerbocker Press\ contained . a l?ng article on Dr. Stein- metz.

14 THE CON 1 CORDIENSIS DR. RI.CHMO·ND ADDRESSES EDUCATIONAL CONFEREN1C'E Dr. Richmond delivered an address at the Educa- tional Conference at New York University on Novem- ber lOth. His subJect was: \The University and th.e City.\ The address in part follows: \The very presence of a university in a city is an asset. Something flows out of a good man which in- fluences a community for the better, this a}:} unc<>n- sdously and without any effort of his own. So it m1:1st be of a body of earnest men whose business in !lime is th~ unveiling and the imparting of truth. Every uni- versity has a character as every man has. AU uni- versities are not equally good. We call them aU good as we call all women fair-speaking uncriticaHy-the wish being father to the thought. \But a really good university is something more and something better than anything it does, and no one will ever know the strength of its silent influence nor the depth of the secret needs to which it is daily ,l!flin- istering. This we might call the passive aspect of uni- versity in.fluence. But this is not enough. It wiU not do for a university to sit like Simon Stylites oN his pillar. A college must come off its perch, so to say, and become part of the crowd. It must throw itself into the swarming life that seethes and struggles and suffers and toils in the factories and shops and ,h_ornes of the city. A university is no longer a close with sweet cloisters and shaded retreats for the quiet scholar. The seit geist has driven us out and wisdom must now stand in the market places and cry aloud in the streets. This upon the whole is good for us and yet there is one capital danger which always confronts an institution of learning which starts out with the de- termination to be useful to the community in some so called practical way. There will be a tendency to come down to the level of the comrnunity rather than to lift the community to its own level. This is the broad and easy way which leadeth to destruction. It is so hard to level up and so easy to level down. Car- dinal Newman remarks somewhere that while the christian church has been purifying the world the world .~as all the time been corrupting the. charch. The same thing is sure to happen in the close con tact of a university with the common life of a city. They will react upon each other. A university should be- ware of the easiest way. It is not the business of a university to give people what they want. We have seen what that kind of philosophy comes to in the degradation of the yellow journal. It is the business of the university to teach people to live the best. Farmers tell us that the way to make a cow a good milker is to keep on milking her. This is the process of elicitation. Conversely,. the way to make people want good things is to keep feeding them good things. \A university should always hold itself high-Dem- ocracy is not vulgarity. There is a democracy of learning, but it is really a kind of aristocracy. It is democratic in that it is open to all men. It is aristo- cratic in that on[y the best ever become free citizens; and again because it .is ruled by the best among the best. \Most of the early universities grew out of the de- mand o:fi some specific need. It was the needs of the human body which originated Salerno the oldest of all. It was the needs of men as related to each other in a civil organism which originated Bolona. It was the eternal needs of the human spirit in its relation to the universe that originated Paris.\ And so merr were furnished for the three professions of Medicine, Law and Theology-once justly called the learned profes- sions. In our own country as you know, our oldest universities were endowed by their founders for the training of young men for the gospel ministry. Today only an insignificant number of men go out from these institutions into this anachronous but still reputable calling. Does the community no longer need minisM ters or is it just that people do not hanker after them as they used to in the simpler days of our Republic. Anyway, times have changed; learned professions have become trades and heavy hands have battered in the gates and even threatened Minerva on her own shrine. These changes have come because there has been what we call a demand for them but a demand does not always rise out of a real need. My own feel- ing is that the universities have pandered altogether too much to cheap popular demands. They have con- sidered wants rather than needs. The people, as we call them, are much like children-they like sweets best, and sometimes they cry is they. cann_9/ ~et them, but a wise mother does not give her children many sweets and neither should a wise Alina Mater. A very important function of a university is to make people want what they need. It is the crux of ·an teaching, as every teacher knows. A college professor who can make an undergraduate want books more than he wants beer should have a place in your Hall of Fame. A university that could do this for a community would merit the praise of the whole world. We may assume certain things in the life of any city. In business the standard of efficiency will be higher than the standard of hopesty. In society the manners will be better than the morals; and in politics there will not be much (Continued on page 16)

The cup is to be used year after year and will doubtless bear the numerals of the class winning the series each year. Details as to :how many games will be played between each dass, dates and rules concerning the series have not yet been announced. Each class is urged to ·elect its team manager at once and to start interest and work toward creating good class teams. As soon as footbaU season is finished, more definite plans, rules and details concerning this new movement will be made known.

It will not generally have succeeded in breeding in them the love of truth as such nor in confirming them in the ele- mental virtues. When it comes to the question how is a university to study the needs of the city it serves? I should answer in general by coming close to the life of that city. More specifically, by bringing the life of the college into closest possible contact with the life of the people in their social and political and church relations. The study and compiling of statistics is something of a snare. The life IS more than card catalogues.

, I '' ~ . ' The Concordiensis ---- -~-- ------- --- VOL. 35. NOVEMBER 22, 1911 NO.8 ~UNION DEFEATS MIDDLEBURY IN LAST GAME OF SEASON Fairbairn Scores Only Points on Field Goal. Review of the Season Shows T earn Lacked Interference. Outlook Bright for 1912 Team --- By W. Earl Weller Union closed a disastrous football season on Satur- day, with a 3 to 0 victory over Middlebury. The lone points of the game were scored by Fairbai~rn, on a pretty drop kick from the twenty-five yard liRe. The field was too muddy to permit of any brilliant playing but the game as a whole was well worth watching. Union outplayed the visitors most decisively in the first three periods and Fairbairn's kick came as a fit- ting climax to a series of good plays. In the fourth period, however, Middlebury's backs developed a burst of speed and played rings around the Garnet team. As mentioned above, Union has had a most disas- trous season, six defeats and one tie out of a season of eight games. It is a record that leaves to the review-:- er, especially since he happens to be a Union man, a most disagreeable task. It is a case of performing an autopsy where one had hoped for a celebration. The details of the seascn are known to every \Concordy 1 ' reader, so let us dispense with what would be useless repetition and start boldly at our task. Perhaps the best way is to take the different position-s and to dis- cuss the manner in which they were filled. Let us start with the ends. The ends of a football tea1n are the scouts of the little anny of eleven. On the1n devolves the duty of chasing down punts, recovering on-side kicks, re- ceiving or breaking up forward passes, as well as smashing the plays aimed in their direction. The position calls for great speed and unlimited nerve. Both these characteristics are possessed by Riley, Starbuck, Storey and Morgan. In Riley and Starbuck Union has a pair of ends that will compare favorably with the ends of any team that Union has faced this season. Riley has played the steadiest sort of a game. He has always been dependable and his playing at times has been little short of brilliant., , .Union has every right to be proud of \Ned\ Riley's 117 pounds of nerve and grit. Starbuck made good in the very first period of the very first game. He is a wonderful end and Union is destined to sing his praises more than once in the next three years. Storey and Morgan have demon- strated on every opportunity that they have the abil- ity. Storey shows a trifle mo:re speed in solving plays than Morgan while the latter carries more weight and is a bit more effective against heavy interference. Further than this, these two are very evenly matched. Except on wet fields where their lack of weight was the worst sort of a handicap, Union's ends have more than held their own. Now for the line. The line has been erratic at times but for the most part has played a hard, scrappy game. At Middletown Captain Sellnow and his mates on the line stood the battering of the heavy Wesleyan backs more than creditably. It was the same in the Rochester and Hobart games,. but at Clinton the light- ning attack of the Buff and Blue backs tore Union's line to tatters. It is hard to pick any man from the line as a star. The b:=tter a line plays the harder it is to say \This man deserves the credit\. Sellnow, Jaso- loski, Vedder, Paige and Ulrich, the first \string'' of linesmen, have stood or fallen together. Such is ever the fate of the n1an on the line. He is a cog in the machine and retributicn for the dns of any one man is visited itnpartially en the whole line. Early in the season the right wing of the line was weak but it came into its own at Midc:letown and ever since play- ed even up with the left end. Hokerk, in the few chances the season has offered him, has shown to good advantage and will fit most beautifully into Vedder's position at centre on the 1912 team. Titus, a 1915 man, although he did not get in to any of the games this season) is a n1an worth watching. Now to turn the microscope on the back field. Sar- vey, Dewey, Coward, Wood, McDermott, Starbuck, Fairbairn and Davis have all filled back field positions frmn tin1e to time. Of these, Sarvey, Dewey and Fair- bairn undoubtedly made good. In more than one gan1e this\'season the opposing defense had been care- fully coached to guard against Sarvey. His speed, nerve and dodging ability have n1ade him one of the best backs that ever wore a Garnet jersey and his

8 THE CONCORDIENSIS hard and accurate tackling have made him a most dangerous man on the defense. Dewey has been a :fit running mate for Sarvey and only needs a trifle more of aggressiveness to make him another wonder. The injury to Dewey's shoulder was most inapportune and his absence from the game was a material handicap in the Rochester and Hamilton games. By far the most serious thing to happen to Union's chances was Fairbairn's injury in the first game of the season.. It not only robbed the Garnet of the services of this dashing little player but really left the team without a quarterback. McDermott, who had run the 1910 tean1 every whit as skillfully as Fair- bairn, unfortunately dropped a punt in the St. Law- rence game. The disturbing influence of this misplay -more properly, mishap-coupled with a bad shoul- FRANK CADY SELLNOW 1911 Football Captain :t. der, the result of a practice scrimmage, kept MeDer- mott from playing his customary game and it was not until the team faced MidciL;bury that he showed his real worth. This put it up to the coaches most strong- ly to develop a quarterback. A quarterback is not de- veloped in a week or in a month. Starbuck was tried but he did not fit. Dewey was worked over into a quarterback and a new system of play was devised. Just as it was beginning to work Dewey was injured. Fairbairn went back into the game but his enforced idleness had not done him any good and he was not as effective as he would have been had the experience of the whole season been behind him. Wood, Davis and Coward all had a chance at fullback. All three played a strong defensive game but were not aggres- sive enough on the offense. Wood shows every sign of developing into a good fullback. He is fast and showed especially good form in the Middlebury game. The great fault with the tea1n this season has beefl. the ilack of effective interference. The team has fought with every ounce of its strength up to the very last second of play on the defensive and opposing teams have not found the Garnet goal Hne an easy proposition to cross. But on the offense Union has been woefully weak. Time and time again it has at- most brought tears to the eyes of the loyal rooters on the side lines to see Sarvey and Dewey waste them- selves against opposing lines. The coaches have worked hard to develop an interference but somehow it has seemed as though this bit of footbal:I lore has been beyond the Garnet squad. The team has suffered greatly in the past years be- cause of the lack of continuity in coaching methods. One year the squad would get used to the tactics and methods of one coach only to face a new coach the next season. This meant not only new methods to learn but old methods to forget. It is since:ve ly to be hoped that the services of Mr. Kuolt can be secured for next season. The writer has seen every game played this season and is honestly of the opinion that a Union tean1 never played with greater spirit than Captain Sell- now's 1911 team. They have fought to the last ditch. Every bit of football 1 uck has broken against them and yet they have gone into each game and played with the spirit of a winning team. INTERCLASS BASKETBALL A series of interclass basketball games wiU be play- ed on the following dates preliminary to the interclass championship tournament for the W. B. Joseph trophy. The dates of this preliminary series are as fellows: Thursday, November 23-1912 vs. 1915. 1913 vs. 1914 Saturday, November 25-1913 vs. 1915. 1912 vs. 1914. Monday, November 27-1914 vs. 1915. 1912 vs. 1913. The chief purpose of this prelitninary series will be to bring forth any possible material that might be used for the varsity. The final tournament for the silver c1:1p will be played during the winter term. All varsity men will be barred from playing in either series of games. Paul Hauenstein has been elected manager for the 1915 team and is working up interest in the ·movement among the freshmen. )

) THE CONCORDIENSIS 9 BASKETBALL SCHEDULE AND VARSITY MATERIAL The basket ball season has commenced. Early last week Captain Fairbairn called for candidates and about twenty put in an appearance at the first night of practice. Three of last year's team will be in the game and from the squad and Albany departments the other openings should be easily filled. Clowe of the medi- cal department will be a candidate for center, having played that position a few seasons ago. Shell, Dewey, Davis, Sarvey, Beaver and Scully will make a lively fight for positions on the garnet team. Following is the schedule prepared by manager Pat~ terson. It is considerably longer than that of last year and includes several fast teams which. Union did not play last season. Schedule january 6-W est Point at West Point. January 13-Syracuse at S:henecta::ly. J anua:ry 18-St. Lawrence at Schenectady. January 20-Rochester at Schenectady. January 24-Williams at Williamstown. January 27-M. I. T. at Schenectady. February 2-Syracuse at Syracuse. February 3-Colgate at Hamilton. February 10-Wesleyan at Schenectady. February 17-Rochester at Rochester. February 24-Pratt Institute at Schenectady. March 1-New York University at Schenectady. March 9-Colgate at Schenectady. ~ TRACK SCHEDULE The dates, upon which the different track meets with other institutions will occur, are as follows: May 11, a dual meet between Hamilton and Union at Clin- ton; May 18, the Union interscholastic meet, (this meet is open to all high schools and preparatory schools); May 25, a dual meet between N.Y. U. and Union at Schenectady; May 30, theN. Y. State inter· collegiate n1eet. The Troy meet will be run off in February about the time of Washington's birthday. g ALUMNI NOTES Mr. C. E. Akin of Johnsonville, a member of the Class of 1877, was r;:}cently elected District Attorney ()f Rensselaer County ()ll the Democratic ticket. Mr. Akin is one of Troy's best lawyers and one of Union's 1nost loyal alumni. He is a member of Phi Beta Kap- pa and of the Delta Upsilon fraternity. DEBATING NEWS At the time these notes are handed in, the exact wording of the question for the Allison-F()ote debate has not been decided. The subject, however, will be for and against the Sherman Anti-Trust Law. The debate will be held in chapel on December eighth. Both the Philomathean and Adelphic Debating So- cieties have held their try-outs for the teams; Philo- matheans on November thirteenth, and Adelphics on November fourteenth. The results in the former so- ciety were: Speakers-] ames H. Potter, '12; Allan B. Mann, '12; Theodore W. Hanigan, '13. Alternate-· Arthur D. Mann,. '12. For the latter society the speak- ers will be Roy W. Peters, '12; Kenneth E. Walser, '12; Donald A. Coulter, '15. Alternate-Charles Male, 13. Professors Hoffman and McKean acted as judges. It was finally decided on Noven1ber fifteenth that the wording of the question for the triangular league debates will be: Resolved, That the Sherman Anti- Trust Law should be repealed. This year the Ham- il ton debaters will come to Schenectady, while garnet representatives meet the Colgate team at Hamilton. As usual, each home team will argue for the negative. The subject for the contest with St. Lawrence will be the same as that of the triangular league. Much in· terest will centre in this initial trial of skill with St. Lawrence. The debate will be held at Canton. 0 GYMNASIUM COMMITTEE REPORTS SUBSCRIPTIONS The ~ub-committee of the B::>ard of Tntstee~ which has the completion of the gymnasium fund in charge met on November 10 at the University Club, New . York. The committee is composed of Messrs. Anable, Bailey, Hanson and Cameron. President Richmond was present. It was decided to complete a fund of $75,000 by additional subscriptions, by the first of June, if possible. Two subscriptions, of $5,000 and $1,000 respectively, were reported. The plans ~r the gym- • nasium have been practically completed by Geo. B. Post & Sons, who built the Payne Gate and who have the campus improvements, at present under way, in charge.

Publication Office The New-Hes-Mor Printing Co., Schenectady Railway Waiting Room Building,· 420 State Street m~e ~rplltkr's ~tffirultirs mW Jlfailings The reporter's side of the \story\ is never heard. He bears in silence while the public censures his every move. That the papers publish at times incorrect statements, exaggerated and imagined, is true; but if those who are in possession of facts would give the reporter correct information many of the misestatements now made in the press would be avoided. As it is those who know the facts are silent and those who know nothing of the facts talk, and from the latter the reporter must gain his knowledge for a story. The unavoidable mis-statements are made and the possessors of the facts, who could have made a correct story possible by telling what the.y knew, criticise. Exaggeration may again creep into a newspaper story by a change made ·in the reporter's version by someone higher up in effort to be sensational. The reporter in the best of faith has written as accurate an account of an event as his powers of gaining the facts permit and perhaps at the request i : n· l .

.• ,,; \ THE CONCORDIENSIS .of someone has stated uncolored facts, which might have been elaborated into a sensation. The copy reader, going over the copy, scents a sensation with his trained nose for news and thereupon so reconstructs the story that even the reporter fails to recognize it as his work. The story appears and the reporter is again the martyr to his calling. Though there is much to be said in defense of reporters it is undeniable that the pubHc has cause for criticism at times, when distorted and incor- rect statements appear in the paper. If the source of the error cannot be traced to either of the foregoing causes the reporter is at fault. \Journalis- tic imagination\ like the poet's license, is a legitin1ate and in fact necessary qualification of a reporter. However, this means of coloring stories is often- times abused, especially by young reporters. Too free use of the imagina- tive element in journalism is as pernicious as the absolute absence of it is uninteresting. Then again the new reporter's eagerness to make ''some- thing out of nothing\ thereby showing the editor his ''ability('', is another point wherein the reporter errs and the public suffers. However, it might safely be said that the censure of the reporter is more often unjust than just. He is dealing with a prejudiced public, which in general affords him little assistance in getting down to actual facts. That the college reporters should be tactful and use the greatest judg- ment in the publication of college news is undeniable; but it is impossible for them to withhold facts concerning student body action if they wish to remain members of the newspaper staffs. A matter that has been aired be- fore a gathering of all the students can seldom be hushed up and the details will leak out one way or another and find their way to the newspaper. If such news is withheld from a reporter's account and turns up from another source the reporter is severely criticised. To have all news authorized be- fore published is impracticable. First live news would be delayed; secondly, the story would get out from other sources, and thirdly, the newspapers would not allow it. All that can be done to have satisfactory reports appear in the local and vicinity papers is to urge the college reporters to be accu- rate, to be reserved, to be tactful, and to use judgment when writing college news. In justice to the 1911 football management it should be said that the editorial in last week's CoNCORDIENSIS headed \Courtesy Towards the Press\ did not refer to it directly. The instances cited occurred at athletic con- tests previous to the present football season. 11

12 THE CONCORDIENSIS THE SEN:TIMEN:TS OF AN ALLEGED SOCIALIS~ I am what you would call an aesthetic socialist; that is one of the higher few that get the fat things; or in other words, we know a chump when we see him. My chances to become President .of the United States of America is fine, and every wop and hod- carrier atnong us has the same swell chance. Person- ally I will barter mine for a nickel. Just a few days shy of November we heard a fine line of overheated air from a fine looking fellow with his hair parted in the .middle, and draped nicely over his listeners. He was a self made proposition, sole- leather, hand-stitched, four-ply with rivets around the edges and all that sort of thing-to hear him teH it. Of course all that our gang is out for is the kale, if you know what that means. In other words we want to gather in. as many Hebrew diplomas as we can and carry as few. bricks, and toss up as few shovels of loam out of a ditch as possible. The fellow that decorated the stump, told us he was a good fellow and that we were good things and that we looked it. Also that we ought to get paid for that fine quality. Don't misjudge me, I know better. The world owes me a living but I know that the only way it can be collected is with arguments backed up by a piece of lead pipe. The bunch I travel around with expect, when our new Mayor takes office in January to run through life on ball-bearings. That is, there are fellows with cement heads that think they can have a spring mat- tress instead of a tick bag of excelsior. Some of the car burglars in our crew think that the bobbies wHl use padded clubs. Mike McSwivel has got the hunch that he wont have to wear things any more in winter that will scratch him. He is going to order from a catalogue. He is figuring up how much more beer he can get for a nickel than before. His thinker never gets the fun- ny thought about the big section of his nickel that will be covered by the silvery waters of the Mohawk. One o-f my bright pals tipped me off that when we got a socialist mayor on the throne that I will ·make twice as much money as I am making now. Well he muffed that over his left shoulder. Because I haven't earned a red cent since the head of our family locked up his desk and started for the Pearly Gates. It would take me a summer or two to buy many ocean liners by getting twice what I am earning now. However I haven't any little chicks crying around for automobiles, or strawberries in winter, and all my friends drink beer, so :a couple of ones in my hip poc- ket always keeps me off 1ny uppers. ln January Everybody knows we have our man m the grand old hall of the City of Schenectady. Being of a nosey disposition I 1nade a little excur- sion through the executive offices. I didn't .go into the fellow's office that got the laurel wreaths last Novem- ber. I just moseyed around to see the ordinary brains. My, what an improvement in the City Hall. It looks kind of punk from the outside, but once you take a slant at the inside you will agree with me that now, it is an ideal place. A cool pitcher of the amber tonic on every desk. Nic~ long cigars laying all around (three fors). There was a poor simple looking thing in there the same day trying to sel:l six dollar fountain pens for 50 cents. They couldn't see him for a 1ninute. One fel- low with a silk hat and a soft collar said \Don't try to get away with any of that funny stuff around here. No kiddin' us see. We can make our cross with a pencil just as well as with one of those new things.\ I took a look around at the bunch. You know a bird's eye slant at 'em. Birds don't get dizzy but be- lieve me I can imagine how the North Pole feels when it sees the Aurora Borealis. I can stand suits, shirts and neckties that have big stripes, if the stripes all go the same way, but when they start in with red and green plaids, good-night. Right away I had a sort of sea-sick, Oceana Roll feeling all over. In another office that I pulled up at, one big big tin- can with his kicks upon the typewriter was getting off a lot of fog in broken English about his son Bertrand, ne Hans. Bertrand had just bought a bungalow, he said, with a Porte Gochere attachment. He thought the place looked like a small town railroad station, himself, but just the same it was the swell thing and that ended it. The tin-horn beside hin1, one of the small fry, started in lying about the shampoo he drank for breakfast. He e~plained that he didn't know just how to pronounce that word, but the last part ought to have the sound of \o\ in fish. I thought I had enough looks for one day so I made for the gate. I am. not kicking about the way things are going to .end up. I'm willing to take a chance; Steve Brodie did. If the worst comes to the worst I got railroad fare. \MIKE\ 1914 '

THE CONCORDIENSIS 13 FRESHMEN UNMOLESTED DURING ANNUAL BANQ,U·ET. Rensselaer Inn, Troy, is the scene of frosh feast. Dozen blue-coats guard ~entrances and surprised sdphs do nothing. For the first time in yeais the annual banquet was held with absolutely no molestation by the sopho- mores. The event took place Saturday night at the Rensselaer Inn, Troy. That the f~ast was held so eady in the term was largely responsible for the sur- prise that even th~ upperclassmen feit when the date and time for the banquet was quietly passed around a day 'Of so before. The inevitable rumor of the possi- ble \pulling off\ of the event Saturday was not credit- ed by the second year ;men, who concluded that this was one of the several \fake\ banquets that generally preceede the \real thing\. What further strengthen- ed this opinion was the fact that one of the fraterni- ties was to give a danae Saturday evening. That the \fake\ was to be well carried out was seen by the sophomores when 1nany of the freshmen began leaving the hill bef()re lunch. Another fact that worried the sophs was the conspicuous absence of the first year 1nen at the football ga1ne in the after- noon. But this did not sufficiently warn the sopho- mores to cause them great anxiety. It was shortly after the game that authentic news of the affair finally spread beyond the freshmen and upper classes, but even at this time the place for holding the ban- quet could be ascertained. It was nearly six o,clock when the telephone wires to the fraternity houses and dormitories carried the hurredly repeated information that the frosh were banqueting at the Inn at Troy.

They w~ere not entirely disappointed for on one or another of the cars a few stray firstyear m.en were discovered. These were treated to involuntary but costless, financially speaking, haircuts. Outside of this harmless fracas the banquet proceeded in peace. The sophomores re- lnained at the Inn throughout the evening but a dozen bluecoats, two at each entrance, sufficiently quelled any rebellious spirit on the part of outsiders. The banquet ticket holders and sophomores mingled freely in the grill, which is always neutral ground.

14 THE CONCORDIENSIS BIBLE STUDY CLASSES The Bible Study groups on the campus are now well under way. The groups are meeting at the various fraternity houses and at Silliman Hall. The Normal Class under Dr. Kellogg meets in Silliman Hall every Tuesday afternoon at five o'clock. The subject of study this winter will be \Lessons in the Life of Jesus Christ\ by Bosworth. The leaders wiU all have copies of the book but it is optional with the classes, the only thing required being the reading of St. Luke's gospel during the course. The various groups and their leaders are as follows: Kappa Alpha-Cavert. Psi Upsilon-Finley. Delta Upsilon-La Barron and Folensbee. Chi Psi-Potter. Alpha Delta Phi-Walser. Beta Theta Pi-Fischle. Phi Gamma Delta-Dr. Hoffman. Pyramid Club-McKnight. Silliman Hall (neutrals)-Cavert. g DRAMATIC CLU!B PROSPECTS The outlook for a Dramatic Club this year is very bright. Although a coach has not been definitely de- cided upon, it is more than probable that the club will be directed by Simeon J. Leake of Albany, who for the past two years has coached the Schenectady Dramatic Club so successfully. Dr. Hale has been appointed as the faculty adviser and he has given the club permis- meetings start at one o'clock and are led by the mem- bera of the Association Cabinet. It is rumored that a new degree has been ,es- tablished at Union for the benefit of Garnsey, La Barron and Hawley. The deg:ree is G. C. (Grass Cul- turist). .~ .~ You cross the street amid a tnad rush of automo- biles, wagons, bicycles and trucks, and breathe a sigh of relief when you reach the sidewalk. When the torrent bursts upon the weary traveler, the lightning flashes in the sky and the thunder rolls, he seeks the nearest shelter and looks out upon the storm, contented and indifferent. When war impends and nations confront each other in hostile attitude, the great heart of a fearful people longs for peace; and when arbitration and mutual con- ciliation settle the difficulty and dispel the gloom of war, prayers of gratitude arise. The hundreds of millions of happy and contented people in the United States thronging the workshops, filling the factories, running the rail ways, have grown sullen, sour and discontented, because they have lis- tened to the muck-raker, the yellow journalist and the demagogue. Yet peace, prosperity and happiness are all to be found on the sidewalk. Have the people forgott.:n it?
