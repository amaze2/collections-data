The many and varied re- ports have mentio:ned names in \high\ places in the same breath with dark and dangerous talk of graft, dirty politics, and other sim- ilar foul deeds far too heinous to mention .at this time. The rum- blings concerned the subcommit- tee of the Junior Prom Committee in charge of co•ntracting for flow- ers, namely the Flower committee headed by a student, whom for convenience we shal1 call B. Mr. B. and commltttee, after deliberation, awarded the flower contract to a local florist, whom for convenience we· shall call X. Another local flori'st, who.m fo'r convenience we sl:).all call Y, de<;lded that the con- tract had not been awarded on a fair basis and therefore placed an advertisement in the Concordiensls through the efforts of a Union stu- del1t, whom for convenience we shall call' Z. At this point, .Mr. B \blew hi~ top\. He was; to sa,y the least, slightly perturbed. He felt that Y and Z were deliberately trying to compromise his arrange· ments with X. This, said B, was not playing fair, and told Z how he felt in the matter, after givirtg another student, head of a student publication, whom for convenience we shall call Q, the worl{S for even daring to publish Y's advertise- ment. SOMEWHER IN TU~ MELEE, we were informed that all was not right in the flower committee. We heard reports o.f clirty work at the green h\)use. Messers B and X were implicated. So we looked around to see what was what, ar1d in the course of events, talked to B, Q, X, Y, ·z, and a mem'ber of the college administration, whom for convenience we shall cali L. From all of these sources we man· aged to Jearn that things were not as we had been toJd by Y and Z, that there had been no illegal or underhanded dealings between B and X, and that L and Q were dis- gusted with the whole business. AFTER DUE consideration and much study of the problem, we derived the following law to fit the situation, name 1 y that YZ:::: XQLB, when g is a constant such that the effeCts of Y are totally nullified under all conditions of Z, Q, L, X, and B.

Dr.· Hickok's remarks wer.~ followed by appro- priqte -and sincere speeches by several members of thE) organization, when candidates for office were proposed. A committee of eight, two from each class, was then appointed by the President, at a request of the asseciation, to draft a constitution; such com- mittee consisted of members of ;;~II classes .. llie future proceedings of this organization, and a complete list of names of members will appear on ot1r subsequent sheets.

No one knows exactly what the final scQre w~s. Coach and shortstop Tom Hoffman says that his team was edged· out ·by 12~1. However, it may have been 15 according to pitcher Bill K'l'ltz. The one run is certaip, however. . Representing the faculty were Bill K;etz, .pitcher; Hal Van de Car, catcher; Perry Schlesinger, first base; Harvey Marrc~ •. sec- ond base; 'Tom Hoffman, short-· stop; Ben Livingston, third base; · Howie Scheffer, .short field; Winny Schwartz, left field, and Sol Nudelman, center field. The next contest is scheduled · Tuesday a;gainst the Calverts on Nortj:l Libr!l.I'Y Field.

After routing Hamilton last Saturday, the Garnet' rolled over Rochester University on Alexander Field Wedn.esday,, 83-43, .for their third straight win, and now await their ·big meet with :RPI next Saturday at Troy. Engineers Strong According to Ketz, the Engineers are just the team which can ruin Union~s chances for their second · straight undefeated season. RPI is strong in the events in which. the Dutchmen have sho'll'll· weak- nesses this year. The half-mile and two-mile events shape up as real contests. Newt Culver alid Bob Garlock could be the winged foot- ers upon whom Union's hopes ·rest. Rochester Beaten The Dutchmen were again paced by Culver and Ken Whalen, each of whom tct>k double wins in the triumph over Rochester. Culver won the half-mile in 2:03;9, just breastlng the tape ahead of the loset•s' Yc•ungman. In the mile, Newt led a Union sweep as Ray Bellanger and Townsend MacCoun followed in the time of 4:43.9. Whalen continued to better his shotput distance~ with each meet as he hea veQ. the 16 pound Iron ball 46 feet 1% inches. Whalen also hurled the discus 120 feet 3 inches, a poor performance compared to·· his shotputting. Impressive Victolies Bob Garlock and Jack Miiford continued to scove impressive vic- tories. Garlock turned In his best clads totaled a lllJiagev 13 points out of a possible 72 In the run- nlng events, ten of which are at- tributed to Palmer who won poth dashes. The Garnet took a total toll of eight of the 14 first places. Jack Milford hit a high for thfs season at 12' 6\ in the pole vault. • Fred Oyer returned to the squad to aid in the high jumping by' taking a second place. Ken Whalen clinched a win in the shot put. with a 46' 114\ heave of the weighted missle, and followed with a close second in the discuss with 122 feet. Art Hagor scored two second placings in the broad . , jump and the javelin. Running Events On the cinders Belanger led · MacCoun and Ketcham to a clean sweep in the mile and took third behind Bob Garlock and Abe LRk- sh!n in a sweep of a 10:31.3 ·two . mile. Newt Culver sparked an.- . other sweep in the 880 with the able assistance of Keever, LaMay and Loomis. Bob McQueen and Ray Lawton bettered their usual good perfovmance · by garnering first and second in a 16:0 high hurdles and a 25.9 low tiurdles. Palmer of Hamilton wc•n the 100 yard dash In 10.2, just barely nos- ing ·out Captain Ollie Personeus. Ollie also took second in a 22.5 second 220 yard dash.

M ARY JANE gives ~he tele:phone in her house a real work-out. But we're not worried a bit. We know Mary Jane's telephone is going to keep right on delivering good service year after year. ' Because the Bell System puts a lot of time, thought, and testing into making telephone equipment as rugged and trouble-free as possible. Tests are constantly under way at the Bell Telephone Laboratories. There, for example, new types of telephone instru- ments are put through a schooLof hard knocks. Dials and other parts are given strength and wear tests. Even the bottom of the telephone_ set has been designed and checked to make sure that it will QOt scratch or stain furniture .. Such tests-on little things as well as on big things-help give you the world's best telephone service at the lowest possible cost. • Near absolute zero, matter does strange things . . • AT 4 5? degrees below zero I1.. Fahrenheit, liquid helium be- comes a \superfluid.\ That is, it loses its viscosity: if it were set in motion like coffee spinning in a cup, part of it would theoretically continue to spin forever. It also becomes a \super-wetting agent, meanin-g it will creep up a con· tainer' s sides, flow over the edge. Other types of matter develop \su- per-conductivity.\ If, for example, a:n electric current were set in motion in a closed loop of columbium-nitride below IS degrees, it would in theory flow indefinitely. These are some of the facts of cryo· genies- the study of low-temper(l ture phenomena ·-into which a group of young General Electric scientists are directing their investigations. Although their studies are in only the earliest stages, the facts of this nether world of temperature have aroused enough interest that with the building of a new Re~earch Labpra· tory, a $250,000 unit h~s been espe· cially constructed for their work. Through- its emphasis on research and creative thinking, through en· couraging fertile minds to follow their own imaginative bent and hy imple· menting their. work with tlte best available facilities, General Electric remains a place \where interesting things are happening,\ and stays in the forefront of scientific and engineering ·development. r:foa tWit~ ra em~~ m_ GENERAL ELECTRIC BELL TELEPHONE SYSTEM •· t ( 1 (

Seems the Concordy knew what was happening alrrost as so-on as did tlie administration and faculty themselves. When contacted, the president said. that he thought the proceedings of faculty meetings should be striCtly confidential, since the faculty would not be inclined to give their opinions if students had access to the proceedings. We theoretically agree that faculty meetings should be ccnfidential, but in light of the president's r.ematks, we wonder what some people are afraid of. Congressional lnvestiga. tion, perhaps.

MARTIN SIEGEL, Issue Editor Plaudits We want to commend Jackson Davis for the play performances which h€ has directed this year. They have been of high quality and deserve for Davis praise which he has not received heretofore. We have been especially pleased over the year with the sensitiveness with which even the minor roles have been portrayed in the four productions which the :Mountebanks have given. A large share of the success of these minor chat'acters goes to the director. The final test of a play director is the per- formance wnich is put on before an audience. In performance, Davis has left little to ~ desired. .. Public Relations The Agnello concert was an outstanding example of student resourcefulness and the success of the concert both from a musical and a public relations point of view shows once again the good job students can do when given the freedom. We would like to add laurels to those given by Agnello to Lot Cooke, for his excellent public relations job on the concert. If you were at the concert Wednesday you un- doubtedly noticed the large number of towns- people here and their enthusiasm. This was due in large part to the efforts of Cooke. For a week prior to the concert stories ap- peared in the local papers, each different and stimulating. Cooke wrote them practic- ally alone. Besides this, he put out a pro- gram for the affair which was one of the best publication jobs here in years. Efforts such as Cooke's create more favor- able publicity fot• Union College indirectly than any direct attempts to woo the public could.

The Reader Writes Dear Editc•r: We wish to thank the residents of Seneca Lodge for the cooperation they have given us in order that we might make available a place of residence for the weekend for \independent\ prom dates. We would also like to thank the administration for its co- operatic·n and assistance, and the chaperones for the many hours spent in the dormitory. We hope that in opening Seneca Lodge to independent dates this past weekend, a precedent has been set for future prom weekends. SENECA LODGE STEERING COMMITTEE Dear Editor: I have just returned from hearing the Lau- rentian Singers C•f St, Lawrence University give a concert in the Union College Chapel combining their voices in a perfect blend under the excellent dirction of Wesley E. Smith. Much to my disappoint- ment, there were only 150 people attending the con- cert, which according to the program was sponsored by Union College. Yet ·Conly 35 were Union students and there were no members of the Union College faculty there to at least represent the college. If this is the way our college welcomes guests, I think it would be much better not to have them.

Some 100 students have already expressed their interest in the. pro- ject by pledging over $450 and pay- ing in cash about $100. Suggestions as to the selection of the foreign student have included that a stu- dent should be chosen from Russia or from a Russian dominated country such as Czechoslovakia. At the present time however possibili- ties have narrowed down to selec- tion from three European countries Czechoslovakia, Denmark and Ger- many. The veterans HELP group has chosen a German veteran as its selection. Omega the recently formed chapter of this national service fraternity here at Union has pledged its sup- port of Newcomer's group. GOOD FOOD?

The agency would be run entirelv bv students and the same fifteen percent. coimnis:sion would be given to the nmn selling the ad. The desir- allility of the agency to the adverth,;er is s~lp­ posed to lie in being aule to sell .a packet of advertising giving. the advertiser a choice of percentages l.letween the various publica- tions; for example, 6w.; Concordiensis, 2i> ~} Idol, 1 O~r Gat:net, etc. The agency, indiredly, could become an- other power gToup on campus and could con- ceivably limit the freedom of the pulllications by neat manipulations of advertising.

The recent report,;:,on \The State of Union\ gave us an overdose when they stated a $13;700 loss incurred by Bill South's \Empol')ttm.\ It really .strains the imJ;~,gination. 'there has C•ften been talk about an inV€!Stiga,tion of the Bale House situation but all efforts in that direction seem to have gone the way of the A.V.C.'s attempt last year.

Frankly, we are pretty damn glad we've had material to print every Friday afternoon, though we rather wish something sensational would happen Thurs- da~: evenings as we pound out filler. Now comes uur long unhparcl wail: why can't you guys do something different, unusual, and do it at the right time?

What we'd like is Tom Elliot abscounding with the Rathskeller funds, or Freddy Wyatt out of a job . .i\laybe Jack Weiss making Phi Beta Kappa is absolutely impossible, but it might make for good copy. A passionate con- troversy over religion would be interesting, but we couldn't print much. Most of us heretics are a closed mouth lot. Could Bailey Hall burn down, or E. S. C. Smith find gold in the bounding brook? Do you suppose J. J. Anderson would run for Congress, or H. W. Bibber finally be granted an electrician's license? Never. We chug along with proms, elections, letters, week old news that everybody knows before we hear about it, and count on Joe Enzer to fill at least t\venty inches for us. Will an existentiali::jt call the student body to action? Will some staff reporter find prexy dead drunk in :\Iilo's? Hardly. Will the rivalry ever Dutch shoes ever match the Gung llo eig-htl>all that pulled a loaded .-15 in dden~e of Hltw Gate over RPI weekend'? \\' e doubt it. \\' e were cun:;iucring running a feature on Clif Bnmn putting new king pins in some ,·chicle or other, but an engineer who could Luth understand the procedure and \vrite the story could not be found.

For myself, i.t is -of c<m-rse especially so; but more than this do I feel it a time for thanks. Much of this I hope to do personalily and so this letter is, so to ::;peak, my msurance policy aga,inst the change of in- gratitude. L hope the premium will suffice, for it has much to cover. I have already spoken in some detail about the personal beNefit m1d general gaiH which an exchang~ scholarship has to offer. Hct·e, then,. I must proffer my thanks for the hospitaHty and kindness that have been. ever present for me \out-of-hours:\ to tl~e Dean and .:'ih·s. Ihmtley; to the students at whGse homes I have been a guest: to Professors Carl Niemeyer and RoiJert llieks who received the bt·unt (>Jf mv intolerant and callow criticism~ dul\ing the Yl'<H' with 'miraculous sang- froid; and above all fur the warm frieNdliness of the ~tudent body in general which in some ways makes me <-!1·ead my return to the formality of my more inhibited native land. Next year thet·e will IJe t\vo exchange students: from St. Andrews and at St. ANdrews, from UNion and at Union. Two more men not of divided loyalties, but of a larger loyalty; of loyalty to an idea; an idea that we n-.ay sneer at with clever cynicisBl, but nevertheless an idea which is becoming more and n1ore real year by year. An idea of union, not politic, but spontaneous; of under- standing and Not mere tolerance. 'Fhe reaction is proceeding; an exchange student is the catalyst and a student body the reagent. Both are necessary. In conclusicm then, as I said, this is a letter of gratitude; unfulfilled gratitude, it is true, bl:lt none- theless real for all that. My home address and St. An- drews address are at the bottom of this letter. If any of you are in Scotland, let me know. The beer will be warm, the v.:eatl,er damp and the food strange. Perhaps company mtght make It more palatable. Certainly, I shall try. Sincerely, C. Graham Martin \Hamewith Kilmacolm, Renfrewshire; Scotland.

WILLIAM T. PAPPAS Ain't It The Truth? Getting out a newspaper is no picnic. If we print jokes, people say we are silly. If we don't, they say we are too serious. If we stick to the office all da;~r, we ought to be out hunting up materiaL If we go out and try to hustle, we ought to bP on the job in the office. If we don't print contributions, we don't appreciate genius; if we do print them, the paper is filled with junk. If we edit the other fellow's write-up, we're too critical· if we don't, we're asleep. If we clip things from other papers, we are too lazy to write them ourselves. If we don't, we are stuck on our own stuff. Now, like as not, some guy will say we swiped· this from some newspaper.

Bundschuh ran the mile in the very fast ti.me of 4:33.4 and slowed down to win the' 880 in 2:06. Coach Clare Grave's Garnet golf squad will close their season to- n:orrow in a return match with Hamilton at Clinton. The golfers P\'Pnc<1 up their TPcord at 3-3 last TI!Psd~y by downing Albany State for the second time, 8\2-'h, after dropping a return match to R.P.I., 5-4, at Troy last Friday. ThP g-o!fPrs opened their season with Hmr.ilton at home, d'ropping thP n:at~h by an 8-:1 score. How- f'Wr, a grPat improvement has been seen since then,. and the \Grave Diggers\ may very well win tomor- row. Both Captain Dan Baskous and Allan Doyle have yet to be defeated in a match. In the Albany contest Coach Graves made full use of his twelve man squad. Winning their matches were Ben Swan, Dan Baskous, Joe Behan, Shelton Jackson, and AI Mulligan, while Pete King halved. Coach Graves ,plans to start his Union took only two firsts, the shotput and a tie for the high jump, compared to last year when they snared eight. blue ribbons. Ken Whalen, heaving the 16 pound iron ball for the last time at Union, won the shotput with a toss of 46 feet 5 5 1. inches. Last year, Whalen won both the shot and the discus, but in assisting football coach John McLaughry this .Spr.ing, Whalen has not had as rnuch .tiine to· prac- tice.

Stern, a major in mathematics,: has been active in other fields than the academic. He has received a block \U\ and 'a lifetime athletic pass for ·his two years' service as manager of the tennis team, and has also served o~ the Concordi- ensis and Garnet staffs for two years. A member of the Cosmo- politan Clu)l, Stern has been seCI·e- . tary of the group. He is also a member and former president of Phi Sigma Delta fraternity. BORN IN GERMANY twenty years ago, ·Stern came to the United States with his parents when he was seven.. His present home is in Manhattan. He at- tended Br.ooklyn Technical High School, 'graduating third in his ci.ass and receiving prizes in Eng- lish and social studies. Upon gradu- ation from high school, Stern ap- plied to several colleges, and, ironic- ally, was not accepted by RPI, one of the schools to which he applied. At Union, Stern has carried two scholarships throughout his college career, enabling him to attend without paying tuition. Stern's present plans include three or four years of graduate work at Princeton, the first year of which has already been financed by a full tuition scholarship. He has also been awarded by Union College half of the Catlin Prize for graduate 'Study, amounting to $500, and the $1400 Charles A. Coffin Fel- lowship offered by the General Elec- tric Company. After his graduate training, Stern expects to do re- search work in industry, or, as a second choice, college teaching. Be- fore entering Princeton next fall, he will spend the summer working for the Bureau of Standards in Washington. . THOSE WHO KNOW Frank GOOD FOOD?
