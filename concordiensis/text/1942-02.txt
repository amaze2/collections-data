Tommy Dorsey's Orchestra for Junior Prom is the first choice of the campus \by a coHntry mile\ ac- cording to the poll of fraternity and neutral groups conducted yes- terday by the Prom ·Committee. H. Melville Messenger, '43, com- mittee chairman, in anflmmcing the results of the poll, said that no other band W:J.s even close to Dor- sey in the count of ballots made last night, which, although not yet complete, was con~lusive. Traili~g Dorsey by a considerable margm, but at the same time holding posi- tions high above all other bands wer·e the orchestr·as of Charlie Spivak and Hany James, in that order. Dorsey's SU:IDremacy over the other bands listed in the poll, which included most of the \top\ ;bands of the present day, was tremend- ous, Messenger indicated. All but three houses chose him unanimous- ly for the Number One spot on thei-r ballots. Besides the three bands already named, only thooe of Alvino Ray a11d Gene Krupa received sufficient support to merit any mention at all. Dorsey If Possible Messenger said that he would leave for New York either today or t;:.morrow, and that his work there will be guided by the results of J esterday's poll. He will \try his hest to bring Dorsey to Union, if he's the onP the college wants.\ The Prom Chairman added that in the event negotiations for Dorsey's Sl'l'Vices for Prom Week-end were unsuccessful. efforts would be made to bring either Spivak or James herP for the annual spring af£air. Messenger also indicated that he \had a line on\ another band of Dc•oey's calibre, whose name was r.ol rllclut:ed in the poll, which he migi•t fhll bacl\ ton. The name of th•' bam~ was not included, he said, l•E>caus~ the m& nager of the orches- tra i;1 ouestion had not been con- tacted. \Thi; bsnd-sr;.rning business is t0•1 risky to make predictions, but I l:lope to hn·e a definite announce- ment tu make .1Jy the end of the week, Musenger said.

Dorsman '42, Chair- Co.mplete Plans For Class Dance Ticket Salesmen Named By Klarman and Anderson; Admission Set at $1.10 Plans for- the Freshman-Sopho- more dance to be held March sev- enth were completed at a meeting of the committee yesterday after- noon. The meeting was called by co-chairman Karl Klarman, '44, and Andrew Anderson, '45. The band chosen to play is that of Fred Gray. This band played at the Della Phi House during Inter- fraternity Weekend and was well received at that time. An innovation for the dance and one that the committee hopes will help to make the dance a success is thE' fact that Skidmore girls will be given 1:00 permission for the • dance. In the past the girls have hPen forced to !Pave early due· to th<'ir !'<chool rule!'! about hours and this has usually thinned the crowd out quite a bit. It i<' hoped that this will eliminate one of the diffi- eulties of the past affairs. Ticl•ets at 81.00 As in previous years, the dance will be held in Alumni Gymnasium. Tickets will sell for $1.10, tax in- cluded, and the dance will last from 9:00 to 1:00. Tickets will 'be on, sale at the various fraternity houses shortly. Committeemen at the various fra- ternities are: John Grant, '45, Chi P:si; Richard Leftwich, '45, Delta Chi; Gerald Buyce, '45 Delta Phi; Robert Bartlett. '45, Delta Upsilon; Judd Grey, '44, Kappa Alpha; David Cohen, '45, Kappa Nu; Jack Hockman, '45 Kappa Sigma; Reg- inald Carrol, '45, Phi Delta Theta; Thomas Flynn, '45, Phi Gamma Delta; John Shott, '45, Phi Sigma Kappa; Frank Kruesi, '44, Sigma Phi; Edward Harris, '44, Theta Delta Chi; Louis Steege, '45, South College; Arthur DeLoungo, '44, Alpha Phi Delta; Paul Meyers, '44 man of the Council said that there would be no other bu::iness at the meeti-ng than that on the agenda already distributed. He said -that in addition to tak- ing up the proposed amendments, the Council would also make the committee to meet with the Fac- ulty Committee on Education more representative, .by revising the make-up of the body. Instead of the class presidents, representatives from each of the catagories of the Council will be named to the com- mittee with the theory ·behind the action that they, representing each group on the campus, could better treat with the faculty senate. No Opposition No opposition to the amendments was anticipated by Dorsman who pointed out that they had gone through the Executive Committee of the Council without a disenting vote or voice. Typical were the following com- ments made by members of the Council: \I think both student nom- inations and popular vote for Preo>- ident improvements over the way things have been done\ .. \I like the idea of student nominations though I think the Council would be -better able to nominate its Chairman because there would be such a long list of nominations ;by students nominating fraternity brothers and f.riends.\ Appr()ve Measm·es \I think both measures are good\ . . \The idea of a popular vote seems good to us in that it re- moves some of the politics con- nected with the position <Student Body President) but possi:bility of the students electing a popular, but not neeessarily good man, enters in,\ The date of the Council meeting was changed from the usual Wed- nesday evening to tonight because of the conflict with the Hamilton basketball game tomorrow night. ----0,--- Brown Herald Ceases Daily Publication If the c0mmittee is successful in signim; :Uo~·~ey, rt will have lived up ~o Hl<' sthnC:a,.d!' \Pt in thP pa·;t two years, for in 1940, Prom-goers rimH'<·d tr• th•' ;r,••sic of Glenn Mil- ler and his tot::-flight orche<'tra, while la!>t ye:a• ::.orne 350 couples attended Uw dartrE', at which time Beunv Goocrran supplied the mu- sic. ·Mcssengl'l' £'stimated that a guarantee that &00 coupic'3 attend this ye:u s dance would probably b\ necessary rn 01 der to close th•} t\eal for Dot'SE'V. \If Goodman drew ~50 last year, 'r tlon't see any rea- son wh 0 D\rH•y r:an't draw that many an<l 1 ilt:l' s•:me,\ he said. of Nuttin'\ and \It Ain't Neces-~ - Beta Theta Pi; Edward Hennelly, Providence, R.

A determined dl'ive for the organizati<m of colleges as planning and morale centers of the nation is being quieti~· developed in the several CoHegiate Defense units throughottt the 11ation. Recognition is giwn to the fact that, while the nation's young· men and production facilities a1·e being geared fot· the fighting of a wa1·, there must be ag·encies which are gearing to plan the goal fm· whose attain- ment the war is being fought-to plan a wise peace. Colleges m·e the most important of these agencies.. It is further necessary that those colleges which are to have reasons to be cultmal foci of communities assume the obligation of be- ing morale centers for those communities. l 1 nion, by its measured pursuit of an aca- demic course which is as nearly normal as is physically possible, fulfills well this fi1·st Civilian Defense 1·equi1·ement. Om· Civilian I>efen~e committee, through its being point- ed to gearing the physical facilities of the college to the war· emergency, is not, lww- ever, constituted to meet the problem of the college as a morale center. Union students should be available for speaking engagements in the surrounding area, they should be able to coordinate war service projects and even disseminate infor- mation.

It is nothing short of amazing to see a supposed- ly complex film, and then when it's all over to realize that there was nothing there at all., or at least something so slim that you can't help but feel that you've -been cheated. bv Eugene Ormandy. All the charm of these waltzes has been retained in the new pre:;sing, and we shouldn't be surprised if it becomes one of Victor's best selling records Be completely well groomed A Senior Dance, to attain greatest success, would have to be held during Commencement Week-end. It would have to have a low priced bid, perhaps one dollar; its chief ap- peal should be that of the dance's affording· the last undergraduate opportunity for mem- bet~s of the class of 1942 to associate in a social function. There could be two possible organizational opportunities for such a dance. One, now be- ing considered, is cooperation with the group arranging the Alumni Dance, which is tradi- tionally held on the Saturday night preced- ing Commencement. Aid of the senior class to the alumni might mean a more ambitious dance than has been presented in the past few years. The other alternative would be the organ- ization of a purely Senior Dance, held on the Thursday or Friday before Commencement. The seniors could or could not, as they wished, invite the rest of the undergraduate body to their dance, they could be sparing on decorations, they could hire a low priced band. The important factor is not the form a Senior Dance takes; it is the existence of such a function. Union has long needed a Senior Dance, and this year presents a fine opportunity for re-introducing such a tradi- tion to the college. \The Corsican Bt·others\ at Pzoc- tor's is a brazenly admitted \free\ adaptation of the ,Pumas novel. In il, we are presented with the strange sight of seeing Douglas Fairbanks fighting Douglas Fair- banks for the hand of the fait• maiden, Ruth Warrick. It's all done with tricks of course, but that can't disguise the fact that it's the feeble et errral-tz iangle plot. Not only does the trick photography try to hide the old hatch material, .but there are plentiful costumes, duels, brawls and what have you, to make you tUnk that there is something more to it than there is.

The first is the question of gearing student government elections so as to gain and to deserve campus interest; the second the question of developing a liaison agent between faculty government and student government. The Student Council can solve its first problem by deciding to revise its constitution to permit of popular election of Student Body President, of open rather than secret nominations, of' nomination by petition. It can develop a system which wiii present to Union in April the most interesting and most valuable Student Council elections seen on the campus in many years. Jess job.

Negro slave in \Sometimes I Feel Like a Motherless Child,\ or if I can make them !mow the convict of t:1e chain-gang, make them feel his thirst, understand his naive boast- ing about his strength, feel the brave gaiety and latent sadness in \Water Boy,\ if I can explain to them the simple divine faith of the Negro in \Wcepin' Mary\ then I shall- have increased their knowl- edge and understanding of my pea- piP.

That will be something to work for -som£>thing worth doing.\ Music ·Hauntt>d Him' Although Robeson was more than twenty before he began ·to sing in public, and was then better known as an athlete and actor, the music of his people \haunted him persist- ently\ in his own words, and it finally became the driving force of his life. Mr. Robeson will be joined in the cenccrt by Clara Rockmore, there- minist. The box-like theremin, named after its Russian scientist inventor, is played by the control of ether waves through electronic forces. The instrument is not touched in playing. Although the tPchniquP of \aerial fingering\ is extremely intricate, Miss Rockmore has been able to dart her fingers calmly at invisible spots in the air and produce both accuracy of pitch and control of volume. After the concert, there will be a reception held in Mr. Robeson's honor in Hale House. The recep- tion will be open to student and faculty subscribers and to members of the Glee Club.

(~ l'll·ll~'H Tt'i]I'JI EYESIGHT IS PRICELESS; LIG'HT IS CHEAP We have nothing but the highest of re- spect for the architecture of the Nott l\le- m.orial Library. We say this with full rec- ognition of that campHs comment which holds it an architectural nightmm·e. The1·e is something encouragingly normal, something typical of colleg·iate America about the library's architecture and the comment OH it. Every college, at least those which are old, has its architectural butt: there is Harvard's Memorial Hall, Prince- ton's Chance!Ior Green Library, and Vir- ginia's curved, brick wall. As a matter of fact, our onl,\· objections to the libra1·y's architectul'e arise at those times when that architecture begins to form an obstacle to the p1·oper performance of the library's functions. Such a case has arisen in respect to the lighting of Union's lib1·ary. Concordiensis investigators, using a Gen- eral Electric lightmeter, whose reliability was checked several times during the course of the testing, found that there is no por- tion of the Ji.brary's reading desks which has better than half the num:ber of foot candles \'1-'hich are minimum for safe read- ing. This minimum-eight foot candles-was found oaly on the front row of desks. Mov- ing backwm·ds, the foot candles progres- sively decreased from eight to five, to three, to two, even to one. The Conco1·diensis' investigators gave the lighting system a benefit in that they held the lightmeter toward the light, rather than toward the reflections of that light from desk or page. This tested the foot candles which fall upon the desks or books, rather than those foot candles which empower the rays to the eye from page or desk. There really seems but one answer to this data: lib1·ary lighting is inadequate for all practical purposes and a change is needed. We ask that the college plan that change. GOVERNMENT DISCRETION In the latter portion of N oveml>er and early in December, this column expressed its fear of the effect of the war effort upon American colleges. Since that time, with Pearl Harbor sup- plying the motivating force, the developing trends upon which this column based its opinion have been rr.ag-nified a thousandfold. The1·e is all the more reason today than -..ve had originally expected for American col- leges to become 1 'war camps,\ for them to forget their primary and original functions. Happily, .so far as Union is concerned, war hysteria has come in no important form. We have lost and are losing om· students to the draft army, many of om· men are signing up for future service with army, navy and in- dustry; we have telescoped our year and have shortened our program; we are giving special training to those of out· students who wish it. Union is, however, following a course which is essentially \business as usual\ and is integrating herself with the war program gradually as practical needs arise, rather than hastily as emotion may demand. A new trend whose effects may well be more serious than any of the others may have begun this week with the granting of a special leave to Professor Sylvester Haef- nei' of Electl'ical Engineering, who leaves fo1· New London on the fifteenth to do special research work that the Navy has requested of him. There are many men in the faculty whose training may put them in the position to receive such a call. We may only hope, in most of their cases, that the government will think sel'iously of what these men are doing here on the campus of Union in spread- ing their knowledge and training over the minds of many young men who will them- selves Le soon available for the war effort. If we are to have college in which men leam to be productive, we must have in- struction for these men. ACTIVITIES FOR THE DURATION One of the large problems befo1·e us right now is the question of the disposition \Ve should make of those college activities which are not strictly curricula1·: that is, our ath- letics, clubs and publications. Before undertaking any solution to the problem, we should first 1·ecognize that these \extra\ curricular activities are really not so extra-they have become, many of them, indispensable portions of American college education. They should be regarded in this light, and any action upon them should be taken with their peculiar nature always re- tained in mind. Athletics m·e probably the most important of these activities. Intercollegiate and intra- mural athletics have monopolized the field in the past, and it is the first of these with which we might find a problem, .since we are being forced to reduce to a very great extent our participation in intercollegiate sport. Our wisest action would seem to be reten- tion of intercollegiate sport which is the backbone of American sport-insofar as we m·e able, and increasingly to emphasize intra- mural athletics as we are forced to de-em- phasize intercollegiate athletics. Any new form of athletic participation, particularly on a mass basis, would scarcely seem an ade- quate substitute fo1· our highly successful intra-mural program. Insofar as the non-athletic activities are concemed, it would seem most practical to make a realistic survey, as soon as possible, to find those activities which are functioning adequately and in which a great deal of in- terest yet remains. By calling a spade a spade, we may do away with those activities which are not now needed, and use the funds allocated to them for the support of other more necessary activities whose budgets would otherwise have to be slashed.

Most re- ve:J.Iing of Japan's policy is the an- cient saying: \He that steals gold is put in prison, but he that steals land i:; made king.\ Illustrating his point by another prover b. the speaker explained how our exclusion of the Japanese from America and England's refusal to renew their treaty of a!lia.nce with Japan at·e in no small way respon- sible for the Japanese stand today. In clcsing, Ritchie expressed his opinion that the Japanese will be able to apply the saying: \Man learns little from victory, but much ft om defeat,\ to their national des- tiny. --- ·0~--- Outing Club Cabin Repair Trip Sunday The Outing Club will make a trip to North Creek this Sunday to pre- pare the Club's cabin for the Inter- collegiate Outing Club Association weekend to be held March 13th, 14th and 15th, Gerhard Leubner, '43, president, said Last night.

The defeat left the Dutchmen with a record of two wins and four losses with f.ive games left to play. Tomorrow night Coach R8ilph Semerad will send them out to redeem themselves against a strong Stevens Tech team here. Last year Stevens trumped Union by a 35-23 score. The Hobol{en team has lost most of last year's squad, includ·ing Ed Israel, who scored 10 points to lead in Union's down- fall. Several new stat•s have mov- ed into the firmament, however, and the Tech five is looking for steadily improving court fortunes. Last week-end it rose up to smack not-so-mighty R.P.I. Previously it had trimmed Haverford, Cathedral Co!Iege and its all!lmni while los- ing to St. Lawrence and Brooklyn Poly. Easy for Hamilton Union took an early lead against Hamilton, but dro.pped it like a hot potato before things had gone very far. Hamilton assumed the leader- ship after about nine minutes of pJ.ay and was never headed. The team from Clinton struck with a fast-breaking attack with a few set shots thrown in with va- riety. Union's defense was pretty close to non-existent and Hamilton took full advantage or poor under- the-basket play by the Garnet. The Continentals held a 29-17 lead at halftime. Since the second stringers were in for Union when the rest period finally arrived, it appeared that Coach Sernerad was merely resting his regulars for a strong second half drive. This drive never materialized though, for Hamilton had run up a 39-18 lead before Union crashed through with its first second-hnlf field goal eight minutes after the period started.

It does promise, however, to give an improved account of it- self and is looking for definitely better things as soon as it runs into Cornell.

Mills said that the first week's broadcasts of the Paul Myers-Earl Goodrich Sportscast, .presented Mondays and Wednesdays at 7:45 had been particularly successful. Myers and Goodrich hold an infor- mal, rapid-fire discussion of events in the sporting world, both on and off the campus. Another new program which has gained favor is the twice-week!y live-talent musical show at 7:30 on Tuesdays and Thursdays. This week Norman Fox and Dr. Elmer A. Tid- mal:sh entertained, while next week's programs include perform- ancE'S by· Fox and the Band, respec- tively. Under the new schedule, Armand Feigenbaum, '42, editor of The Con- cordiensis, presents an editorial viewpoint of campus events in his program, \From the Editor's Chair\ Tuesdays at 7:15. Still another innovation that is gaining popularity is the \Platter Chatter\ show, given on Mondays and Wednesdays with Saul Meisel, '45, as commentator. Meisel intro- duces a variety of jazz classics, old and new. The Campus Caravan, classical and light classical progmms all continue. Mills also announced the signing of a semester contract with Beech- Nut Chewing Gum, calling for a sel'ies of recorded spot announce- ments. The Camel cigarette con- tract was renewed fo1· the coming semestet·.

DR. ALEXANDER LOUDON ------------------------ Busy Week Ended at Employment Bureau Dr. Loudon, who entered the Netherlands diplomatic service in 1920, has represented his country in the League of Nations, as well as ln Buenos Aires and in several European countries. He became Minister at Washington in 1938. PI·esident Fox, in making his an- nouncement, recalled that Union College and the City of Schenec- tady both owed their origin to the leadership of Holland Dutch set- tlers and their descendants. The Rev. Dirck Romeyn, who in 1784 became pastor of the Dutch Re- formed Church in Schenectady, to- gether with General Philip Schuy- ler were principally responsible for the success of ,the movement which led to the establishment of the college in 1795. Here Last Year Last year, Dr. Loudon, speaking to the student body in Daily Chapel, said that the Dutch In- dies would repel Japanese aggres- sion with or without the aid of foreign allies, and that they shall not surrender as long as fighting is necessary or possible. A system of trade for trade'·s sake was urged by Dr. Loudon. Trade in the Indies would be open to all countries and no foreign domination for the sake of trade would be permitted, he said. In ending his talk, Dr. Loudon stated that buildings can be rebuilt, men can be reborn, but human ideals are inexistent un- less men fight to preserve them. In the light of recent events, his speech turned out to be prophetic. Company were al,;o left burning, and Nu, David Cohen '45; Kappa Sigma, eludes the course.

For Union this mass parchase might take on a slightly different c01nplexion-one that might be unusually effective. It would seem entirely \vithin the realm of possibility for there to be held an \all-out Union\ night at some point during the col'lege year; all Union activities whose purpose is the presentation of entertainment might participate. The 1\Iountebanks could present a comedy and the Glee Club a concert while other organizations might well cooperate with them. For this special venture tickets could be sold in the Capital District, and there is a strong possibility that they would be well received. The defense bonds could be purchased on behalf of the scholarship ftmd of the coi·lege; they would serve the double purpose of add- ing money to the war chest of the nation and giving to the scholarship fund an asset whieh would have suustantially increased in value upon maturity. Chief objection to such a proposal would be the standard one usually given such pro- jects; that there are too many conflicting affairs. If that objection were at all times observed, we have serioHs doubts as to whethe1· or not any new project would ever spring up on the campus. An \all-out Union\ night, even if l'Un in conjunction with some standard affair, would mark a double contribution by the Union student body.

SOLVING THE LIGHTING PROBLEM It is gratifying to note that the colleg-e has already made plans which will deal \vith im- provement of lighting in N ott Memorial Libt·ary. Comptroller Hoadley told a Concordiensis reporter yesterday that the college will have its maintenance crew wash the glass ceiling through which much of the library's light comes. He expressed the belief that fifteen foot candles will shine on the reading desks when the dirt crust on the glass has been removed. Fifteen foot candles will provide an ade- quate minimum for library reading; when the present system was installed in 1936 something better than fifteen candle powers was delivered. Unfortunately, however, the sort of make- shift lighting system that we have in our library is subject to periodic deterio1·ations in power such as the one which has just been noted; that is a majOl' fault about which little can be done. It would seem highly desirable for the col- lege to set up as one of its long range finan- cial projects-and one high on its priority list-the installation of a modern lighting system in the library, one which may be de- pended upon. Fo1· the time being, when the situation makes it possible to secure neither materials no1· to allocate funds, we may well feel satis- fied that our system can be stepped back to the reading minimum. THE FAT OF THE LAND! In repudiation of anticipated tendency on the part of women and women's colleges to chaff colleg·e men on their being the poo1· physical specimens that several government agencies have termed them, we wish to pre- sent the following information: Some few wee1<s ago, the Department of Agriculture decided that it would find out who the \mean woman\ of the country was. By mean woman was, of course, meant the average woman. After some weeks with tape and pencil, the Department of Agriculture came through with some data which should be of interest to those who feel that the average woman is an attractive creature possessing a five six in height, a set of 36 inch hips, a 24 inch waist, and, oh well- The Aggies discovered that the mean woman is a squat little article, reaching only five feet, three inches from the ground. She has hips 38.82 inches and has a waist of 29.li5 inches, the measurements scarcely symmetrical according to any Venusian prin- ciple. J.Iaybe we're a flock of physical wrecks, girls, but at least we're packaged well! THANK YOU It might be noted here that during its month without a full-time secretary, the Stu- dent Activities Office functioned in a fashion tha twas more than adequate to all needs. In a period in which great difficulty might have been expected, every student activity was able to go its way without obstacle. Behind this piece of able management was, of course, Professor William W. Bennett, Co- ordinator of Student Activities.

Survey Pro's and Cons of Adviser System, Curricula.r P·lacement Here 0-------------- ____ .,. -·. Placement opportunities and the adviser system have become an in- tegral part of the full college pic- ture. Their expansion has taken place in recent years in response to situations which demanded the or- ganization of such devices to pet- form their operations in the gen- eral pattern of the college educa- tional process. Wise steps have been taken here at Union in crea- ting and expanding these two de- vices. Whether the college has made full use of them is a question which this article seeks to answer. Functions of Advisers sides the rules applying to athletics stipulate that no students may par- ticipate in more than one activity unless they make the Dean's list. No other regulations exist, and ad- visers seldom investigate the ac- tivities of students. Maintenance of a 3.0 index is no justification for static performance in curricular ac- tivity if it can be demonsh a ted that activities are hampering the academic work of students. Major Selection Selection of an upperclass major is made so·me unannounced day in The advisers are agents for the SSlO for social studies men, for ex- distri·bution of quarterly grades ample.

Regulations concerning the one. selection of upperclass advisers Certain recommendations for state that each student must make changing the present system are his selection within the particular I conspi-cu~us by their_ a~sence at the field or division in which he is tak- present lime·. There IS httle attempt ing his major. Thus opportunities by advisers to reach other faculty are provided for greater personal members and investigate the qual- ity of work being done by their ad- visees. There is no systema:tic and organized cliscussion among advis- ers on problems related to guidance -both academi-c, and as far as employment and graduate oppor- tunities are concerned. There is no faculty-student committee which meets to discuss these problems from the respective viewpoints with and eye to helping all those con- cerned in the project. One problem which exists at the present time is that there are a number of activi- ties and functions which absm·b a good deal of time that might be spent in studying. Furthermore, there is the problem of discovering why the scholastic average of the college has dropped in the last few years. Placement Placement is a task that can- not be handled by the present Bu- reau alone because of the many as- pects connected with the problem and the necessity of having faculty members on the staff anyhow. There is little integration between the selection of courses with a view to either graduate work or seek- ing a field of employment. There is little attempt to use the ad- viser system as an instrument of indicating channels of employment. A .step in this direction was indi- cated in an article not long ago which described the social studies plan of bringing leaders in several fields to speak to students inter- ested in those particular fields. The present system is curative rather than preventive. Its poten- tial effectiveness must be trans- lated into policies and action which will remove the present liabilities of the system. The present system is a step in the right direction, but it mnst make some definite changes if it is to achieve its final goal. contact .between advise1·s and stu- dents. ~ llllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll 1111111111111111111111 illlllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll!.: - - - - While the present system seems = ;: to have much on its asset side, _ there are inadequacies and short- = comings of the system which should be remedied in order to make for a more effective system, and hence more •beneficial to the students. ... ·Conferences Needed In the interim between marking periods or even immediately follow- ing the distribution of grades, few conferences are held except when grades are very low. It appears that in general the adviser takes _ the initiative in conferring with the student, but usually only after the student gets into a rut. Occasion- ally students take the initiative out here again only after getting into a rut. We might conclude that problems are seldom discussed be- _ tween students and advisers until they reach a stage where a cure is sought rather than preventive measures taken.

Saturday night will mark the first one of the basketbaH team's two biggest games 0f the season. The Garnet courtmen will tackle R.P.I. at 'Troy and it looms as a rea:! battle. The records of the teams are strikingly similar and the Dutchmen have vowed that thts is one gam.e they won't let slip away from them. URian, which scored 12 straight victories over R.P.I. in basketball from 1933 ot 1940, will now be seeking to snap a .three-ga·me supremacy by R.P.I., which won last year's contes~s by 32-21 and 29-18. * H<1ckey Manager \Doc\ Or- ton pulled what we think was one of the :best stunts uf the year Saturday. He nearly caused the cancellation of the basketball game with Stevens, though he was 90 miles away at Clinton. It would have been a good feat if he had accom- plished it, for it would have saved ·Union from its third straight drubbing. ''Doc\' didn't do this pur- posely. He simply made a slight mistake by mistaking a canvas bag full of new basket- balls for one uf the bags con- taining hockey equipment. This left the basketball team high and dl·y, until someone had the idea to use the old, but satis- factoi'Y intraural balls, which happenf>d to be left behind. * * * Delta Chi and Phi Gamma Delta are billed to meet tomorrow night at 8:30 o'clock in a game which may decide the intramural basket- ball championship. Both fives are undefeated and the outcome is pretty much a toss-up. Delta Chi complains that Jackpot put 1t in a tough spot by naming it as his. choice to win the title. But then, every team has been gunning for the Nott Streeters this winter. * Bob Panoff came pretty close to picking the result of Satur- day's hockey match with Ham- ilton. He pl'ediced that he and his mates would do about two goals better than they did against the Continentals here, w·hich was wrong by one goal. Hamilton's margin was silced by thrcf>. . . . And speaking of mat·gins the difference bf>- tween the high singles reeled off at Reuters last week by Jack Rhoades and Bob Lowe was some coincidence. Both had their high singles Qf the year. Rhoades hit 234, while Lowe had 231. In his next game Rhoades dropped to 114. * * * Someone else mistook Ed Green for ickey Rathlev at the Hamil- ton game last Wednesday night. This is a regular occurrence, and would seem to bear out this humble observer's opinion that Green bears a striking resemblance to last year's basketball and baseball co- captain. , . .

This was made necessary 'be- cautio under the revised calendar examinations wiU be held from April 15 to April 21 and will be fol- lowed by a two week vacation. Be- cause of the late spring in upper New York state it will be impos- sible to hold athletic contests with- out running the risk of repeated cancellations. No '42 8ummei' Teams No varsity teams will be \allow- ed\ dming the 1942 summer term. Dean Garis thought it likely that var::ity sports would be allowed in future summers when they possibly would take the -place of the can- celled spl'ing sports. \We have to wait and see what other colleges will do,\ he said. Compul:;m·y physical training has been adopted at the request of the army and navy, the Dean said. The program, it is hoped, will \better the general health of the individual, increase the physical co-ordination and physical capacity of the indi- vidual, su·bject the individual to physical contact, increase the indi- vidual's efficiency and stamina in covering distances on foot, equip the individual with a knowledge of life preservation and develop cer- tain attitudes such as courage, con- fidence, morale and enthusiasm.\ The program has been divided into four phases. It will start in the fall with two weeks drill de- signed to \move large groups effi- ciently and quickly\ and will be fol- lowed by a four week walking and running program designed to en- able \the individual to cover dis- tance efficiently and quickly.\ Four wee){S of speedball which teaches \co-ordination of values\ will fol- low. Boxing, Wrestling In the winter eight weeks will be spent tea·ching ,boxing and eight weeks teaching wrestling. A four week spring program will consist of a repeat of the running and walk- ing. -SumlJler work will involve four weeks of walking and running, four weeks of speed-ball and six weeks of either boxing or wrestling. Baseball, touch football, etc., for- merly on the gym program have been completely dropped, The in- tramural program will proba'bly be continued. A class, which will meet three times a week for an hour, will start with ten minutes of strenuous cal- isthenics. Five minutes of running will follow and the balance of the period will consist of the exercises outlined above. .Swi:nming 50 yards will still be required of all Union students. It will take precedence over every- thing except the running and the calisthenics. ---0---- Lost YOUR Brandenberg Concerto No. 2 and 3? Made a slip in handling your rec- ord collection?

They pointed out that students who wish to have their status de- termined by their home town draft board must give their home ad- dress for the cards to be trans- ferred. Elsewise they will remain in Schenectady. Changes Representation On Committee to Meet With Faculty 'Senate' All three proposed amendments to the student body constitution were pas£ed without a dissenting vote by the Student Council at their regular February meeting Tuesday night. They will be sub- mitted to the student .body for rati- fication at a special meeting to be held during chapel period Monday in the Old Chapel. Andrew E. Reilly, Jr., '42, was elected to fiJI the membership on the Council left vacant because of the withdrawal from school of Rob- ert K. Killian '42, former Chairman. In introducing the amendment to Artide II, part 2, Section B of Title Two, President Abraham B. Dors- man said that at present members of the student body have \no say in who they want to put up.\ Un- der the amendment they would now be \able to put up the men they wanted.\ As pasEed the Council shall still continue to nominate members of the incoming Council. The names will proba,bly be published in The Concordiensis for public record and then the student body will ,be allow- ed to nominate any additional names for Council positions pro- Student Behavior At Weekly Movies Draws Criticism By Faculty Members Dispite repeated admonitions by~•>---------- ------ · ~ -- the faculty and the administration of the college, the remarks at the Monday evening movie perform· ance of the Mountebanks still seem to be continuing unabated. Remarks made at last Monday evening's performance of two Rus- sian movies moved Professor Ed- ward S. C. Smith, Professor Har- i'ison C. Coffin and Gordon Rust to write the following letter, Editor of The Concordiensis, Sir: It is apparent that these pro- grams have failed of their purpose, just as it is appa1ent that the stu- dents of Union College have failed to comprehend their own responsi- bilities in the matter. The films ha-ve been greeted with cat-calls and derision, and a level of behav- ior has ·been exhibited that reflects seriously on the morale of the col- lege. It is known that some people who bmuhgt season tickets were so di~;gusted by student antics that they preferred to remain away; it is also known that some of the wit- ticisms that were shouted out were embarrassing even to other under- graduates.

The petitions must ·be presented to the executive committee of the Stu- dent Council within one week of the date of the Student Council nominations. The petitioner's name will then be added to the ballot. The absence amendment was also passed q.uic·kly. The only change provides that a replacement must be elected by a majority vote of the Council. Discussion Over Election Lack of a complete understand- ing caused much discussion by the Council over the amendment which would make the election of the Chairman of the Student Council and PreEident of the Student Body a popular one. Chairman Dorsman explained that the only way the Executive 'Let the Grecian Scream' To Be Given Wednesday In spite of an article in last Tuesday's Concordiensis, the im- pression is still abroad on the cam- pus that the newspaper's show, \Let the Grecian Scream\ win be presented tonight. It will be given its first public performance next Wednesday evening in the Mounte- banks Theatre. The show is open to anybody. \Let the Grecian Scream\ is a take off on some students now in college but mainly on the faculty ftnd admini-stration. Further details will be car·ried in TuPs-day's Concordiensis. 0 CORRECTION Questioned about receiving cha-pel time, he assured members that it could 'be gotten. Edward C. Enstice pointed out rthat in all probability only four of the seven men might run. Dorsman, continuing his explan- ation, said that a simple majority of the votes cast would be required for election. If no candidate re- ceived a majority, a second election would be run off in chapel two days later with -the names of the lowest two or three crossed off. If another vote was needed, the ballot would only carry the names of the two highest candidates. Several .members pointed out that this was an experiment;ot-1 meru;ure and would probably change some- what after actual practice.

This will be the first public re- view of Caldwell's new book. The author and his wife, Mar- garet Bourke-White, the noted photographer, spent from, June to October touring Russia and espe- cially the battle lines that the Rus- sians were then holding around Smolensk. The book is a reporter's job, conceming itself with his ob- servations at the front. As usual all students are invited to the program. ---0----- Robpr·t II :: :1ynn.

Langsam at the YMCA beginning Monday, Febru- ary 16. The lectures are sponsored by the Public Affairs Committee of the . :;;chenectady Young Men's ChnstJan Association. For several years the Mounte- banks of Union College have offer- ed a series of cinema programs de- signed to illustrate the growth and development of the motion picture. These programs have been produced at a considerable expenditure of time, energy, and money, and they have depended, to some extent, on co-operation between the college and the townspeople. The films have been chosen in order to show certain specific aspects of cinema technique, and they have been of- fered in the belief that the motion picture is an important variety of entertainment. It is hardly fair to enlist the sup- port of townspeople in a college enterprise, and then to su'bject these guests of the college to the sort of rowdyism that has prevailed in the Old Gym Chapel on Monday evenings. It is hardly fait· to the sponsors of the program that their efforts on behalf of the college have been greeted with noisy and (Continued on Page 4) Through a copy reader's error there were two number 35 issues of The Concordiensis.

We think of the friends we have come to make 011 can1pus, and the enemies. We eead the Senior Board declaration in its fkst issue-February 18, 1941-to the effect that The Concordiensis' purpose is \to furnish the cam:v>us with accurate, thorough, living coventg-e of the news that is being made and to help build and sustain campus morale.\ We are able to tell ourselves that our Board has ahvays attempted to fulfill that function to the best of its ability. 'N e think of our last year's theo1·y of the college and its little world and of the events The· Concordiensis has 1·ecorded since that time: from tem·ing out its hair over the Dor- sey contract breaking affair and nearly com- ing to a break with 1941 Student Council leaders by agitating for popular election of the Student Council Chairman, to Pearl Har- bor and the three year plan. vVe think with some amusement of the thorn we must have IJeen in some sides in our fo1·ays into \give and take;\ and we take a great amount of pleasure in the fact that those thoms were returned only in fair ex- change.

Speaking here yesterday afternoon, Professor Lar- rabee related that \the man\ was Joseph Jacques Ramee, famous French architect, who early in Jan- uary 1813, on a joumey by sleigh from Ogdensburg, N. Y., to Phila- delphia, stopped in Schenectady as a dinner guest of Dt·. Eliphalet Nott, then president of the college, and remained to lay out the first unified architectural plan for a col- lege campus in Amel'ica. Ramee, driven out of Europe by the Napoleonic wars, came to the United Slatecl to aid in developing a great ;:ettlement along the St. Lawrence River for David Parish, one of the \real life\ characters portrayed in the novel, \Anthony Adverse.\ He interrupted his worl{ for Parish to draw plans for the campus of Union College, then onlr eighteen years old.

The program, approved by the trustees and faculty, provides for a college year of fmty weeks, with few vacations, starting eat·ly in September and ending late in June. The next college year will start to- morrow and end up on June 30. A six-week summer session has been proposNl for Lafayette stu- dents who may seek additional credits, and other college students desiring to make up some work The summer se:osion lhis year is expected to start on May 25 and end July 3. The engineering guid- ance con·ference for boys will be held from June 21 to July 4. Explaining- the accelerated pro- gram which will make it possible for the majority of undergraduates to complete their college course be- fore they are ca·lled fo-r military service, Dr. Lewis pointed out that undergraduates would actually lose less than a week out of each nor- mal college yeat·, and that the loss of ;\.\<'h ·timP would hP made up by I intensified work and the absence of long vacations. President Lewis also said that the idea of a summer va-cation for the undet·graduates appealed to the faculty members and trustees, since a number of students must earn enough money duting the ><UY.1.n< ,. to •pay part of their college ex- penses and the program would al- low them to work at -least two months durin;; the summer. !~rn Chapel Today A 16-year old, concert pianist, a refugee ft·om war-stricken Europe, Claude Ft anks, was given an en- thusiastic reception in daily assem- bly today. Tonight at 10:45 p. m. he will give a quarter-hour recital over WGY. This morning he played Chopin's \Fantasie Impromptu\ and Brahm's \Rhapsody.\ Claude Frank played first at the age of six. He studied in Germany and for two years in Paris, first with a pupil of Artur Schna:ble and later under his son, Karl Schna:ble. He gave concerts all over Europe and while playing in Madrid at the Brazilian embassy he won the friendship of the ambassador who endeavored to have him make his home in Brazil. However hi:,; parents already had obtained the necessary visa and had engaged his passage to the United States. He now makes his home in New York City.

It is as distasteful for us to print on our front page the lettel' received from the i\Io- tion Picture Committee as it must have been foi· the gentlemen of the committee to write us that letter. Only rarely in the history of the college has it been necessary to take ac- tion-or even threaten action-as a 1·esult of the inability of Union men to conduct them- selves as gentlemen. A series of films has, for the past several weeks, been presented in the Old Chapel under the auspices of the ,;,\lountebanks. The purpose of these films has been the illustra- tion of the development of motion pictures technically and dramatically. It is quite true that a serial and occasional other films have partaken of a melodramatic nature, somewhat analogous to the \hiss and boo\ series. These present, unto themselves, no excuse for indecent remarks. But when there were, as last Monday eve- ning, films portraying human suffering and human distress-situations that we might do well to recog·nize in these tmublous .:;Jays- there is no excuse at all for the form of re- mark which has filled the Old Chapel. It has always been a prerogative of col- lege men to enjoy a certain form of license for foue years. That license, by virtue of an unwritten agreement which is supposed to be part of the makeup of all men, has volun- tary bounds set upon it for public gatherings -certainly when women and older people ---0--- Hislop Links Pearl Harbor With Schenectady, 1691 are present at those gatherings.

He said that Dt·. Bennett sug- gested that the committee be made up of nine men, two repr·esentatives from each division and a member of the Student Council instead. The Council approved the suggested change and will allow Dorsman to name the mem·bers of the commit- tee. Dorsman, in telling Dr. Ben- nett's suggestions to the ·Council, indicated that he would allow such groups as the ASCE, ASEE, etc., to pick the representatives of their group.

President John Clowe '44, of the Sophomo1·e Class, said that upper- classmen \didn't care a 1·ap\ about the freshmen. When the clas~ had tried to take things into their own hands, he said, they had been pre- vented from doing anything. He bemoaned the fact that no real punishments existed. After hearing several suggestions Dorsman appointed George Ander- son, John Clowe, Karl Klarman '44 and H.

The Philo- matheans and the International Relations Club will act as joint sponsors of primary elimi-nations. On Wednesday, February 25, I'Un- off eliminations for the Union Col- lege de,legates will be held in Silli- man Hall at 7:30 p.m., where a team of three will be selected. This contest is open to aH men of the student body, the general topic be- ing \How Can We Best Implement Our Good Neighbor Policy?\ The purpose of the discussion is to promote friendship and coopera- tion between the Americas and to stimulate a nation-wide study of inter-American affairs. Other ob- jectives of the contest are to inform the public concerning relations, to formulate solutions for existing problems and to implement the Uood Neighbor Policy. South American Tour Contestants participating in the national finals will be conducted on a tour of South America during the summer of 1942, with all ex- penses paid. The speaker adjudged first in the district forums will be awarded a fountain pen suitably inscribed and .awards will also be presented to those selected as sec- ond. District eliminations for the dis- trict of the New York State area will be held here on March 27, two winners being chosen from the group. These two winners will be sent to one of six or seven regional conferences, which will be conduct- ed in a manner similar to those of the districts. The students selected as the most outstanding in each region will become delegates to the National Intercollegiate Con- ference on Inter-American Affairs in Washington. These selectees will be rewarded with a specially con- c.lucted tour of South America. The district conference will con- sist of a number of public speeches and round tables during the afternoon, concluding with an extempore-discussion in the eve- ning. Contacts for the district elimina· tion contest have been made with 12 other colleges and at least 10 of these are expected to partici- pate, according to Edgar Fisher '42, President of the Philotnatheans. Bibliography for the contest has been issued by the Office of Co· ordinator of Inter-American Af- fairs. All students interested should ccntact either Edgar Fisher '42, or Harvey Fishbone '43, for further information.

The proposal is made t·hat the schools render advisory service to young men, whether in or out of school, as to how they can aid the country to best advantage_ This report, entitled \A War Pol- icy for American Schools\ will be ptesented at San Francisco next week before 5,000 teachers, admin- istrators, college officials and prom- inent school men from every sec- tion of the country, meeting at the seventy-second annual conference of the American Association of School Administrators, a depart- ment of the National Education Association. New Policies to Be Proposed From many points of view the San Francisco convention is the most important educa:tional gather- ing since the outbreak of hostilities. Various problems facing schools and colleges, as a result of the war, will be considered. New policies are to be presented which will have a vital influence on the conduct of American public school education for a decade to come. ----o•--- Cetmpus Chest Payments Collected This Week Final installments of Campus Chest payments will be collected sometime this week, Robert M. Bishop '43, chairman, announced Sunday. Blanks were distributed yesterday to members of the soli- citing committee, who will make the collections. S. B. Fortenbaugh, general chairman of the Red Cross Wat' Fund campaign in Schenectady County, telephoned George A. Rob- erts, chairman of the campaign committee on the campus to ex- press the thanks of the Schenec- tady Chapter to the students of l:nion for their contribution of $170 to the War Fund, through the Campus Chest. This latest gift raised the total contribution of the college to $518.50. Members of the Administration, the Faculty, office employes and grounds crew gave $348.50. :BiU In Assemb-ly ~Fe·w Rema-;k~~P~ssed ~16-piece Band Here On April 10 M D bl V I At Mountebanks Show Ranked Second In Popularity PoU ·. ay .

The bill, which provides for amendment to the present scholarship law, will, if passed, go into effect on June 1, 1942, aNd apply to present scholar- ship holders as well as to future winners. According to. the pt ovisions of the proposed amendment, winners of state scholarships would be awarded a total of $800 for the period during which they are in college.

Defense Chances For College Men Are Summarized Eight Service Fields Outlined in Statement By Professor A. H. Fox In the belief that most Union undergraduates would prefer put- ting their college training to use in the interests of national defense, If this bill is passed, scholarship winners will .be granted $100 per semester, provided they do not a:t- tend more than three semesters per calendar year. The present law provides payment of $50 per semes- ter for four years, at the rate of not more than two semesters a The Concordiensis presents in these year. Increase in Expenses The proposed Jaw would have winners of state scholarships re- ceiving no compensation for attend- ance at the first summer session of their college career. If, how- ever, they attended a second sum- mer session, they would be award- ed $200 for that semester. Although the suggested amend- ment is worded to apply to present scholarship holders, it is speci- fically stated that they should not receive additional payments for the semesters attended before June 1 1942. Thus the law would provid~ no extra income for present sen- iors. but would affect all classes be- low them. Proponents of the measure have pointed out that when the present education law, with its provision for state scholarships, was passed, the sum of $50 a semester was in most cases equal to full tuition, and that the avera-ge student's expenses outside tuition totalled only about $200. Now, however, although state scholarships have not increased, the average tuition in most of New York State's better colleges is in the neighborhood of $400, and out- side expenses have increased ac- cordingly. One factor which may lead to the defeat of the amendment, however, is the present movement toward a considerable reduction in state taxes, !'S a result of the enormously increased federal taxes. The amend- ment calls for an appropriation of $420,000 to provide for the extra scholarship payments. It is felt, therefore, that the movement for state-wide economy may -threaten theh passage of the amendment. columns a summary of the oppor- tunities for war service which are of special interest to college men. This summary was prepared .by Professor Augustus H. Fox. It will be noted that some of these opportunities include fields of service already familiar to the undergraduates. However, in the interests of completeness, and to avoid confusion. the entire sum- mary has been included, All of these classifications of service offer special advantage to ~en with college training. Many mvolve additional specialized train- ing. The material in this summary was used by Professor Fox as part of a recent Daily Assembly talk. The summary follows: 1. The Naval Reserve, u~der the desi-gnation V-7, enlists students above Sophomore rank for training for commissions as Ensigns, Deck or. Engineering Officers on Navy shtps. These men are required to have one year of college mathe- matics, including trigonometry, but no ·other special training, 2. Men from engineering or sci- ence courses may enlist for train- ing for commissions as Ensign in Special Services such as Ordnance Aeronautics, Construction, Com~ munications, ot· Ship Building. 3. For those who are interested in the Air Corps, the Navy offers the V-5 program and the Army the Aviation Cadets. These are open to students in the Junior or Senior classes who are ready to enter the service immediately, although the Navy does grant deferment until the end of the college years. Junior Prom-goers for 1942 will dance to the music of Charli~ Spivak. and his Orchestra, H. Melville Messenger, Committee Chan·man, announced this morning on receipt of a contract from New York signed by Spivak and his man- ager. Spivak will bring a 16-piece band to Union, along with the popular \Star-dusters\, a vocal quartet for the tradi- tional spring· affair to be held this yea1· on 'Friday evening Apl'illO, from 10 until 3. ' -- ----- -------·<$> Spivak's organization finished Primary Training Is Begun By CAA Names of Those Men Chosen for Secondary Course To Be Announced Training for students in the spl'ing session of the Civilian Aero- nautics Authority's primary Civil- ian Pilot Train'ing optogram here began late last week, with 15 Union undergraduates enrolled in the class of 30, according to Professor Everett W. Tha·tcher, coordinator. The secondary course is scheduled to start within a few days, Profes- sor Thatcher said. Reports ft om the medical exam- inations of six prospective CAA trainees have not yet been received, Professor Thatcher said. None of these six are Union men. If, how- ever, any of these reports indicate a failure, it is possible that addi- tional qualified Union men will ·be enrolled to fill the quota of 30. Thus far, only ground school work has been given the new class. Flight training will start imme- diately, however. Psychological Exams An innovation in CAA training was put into effect Friday evening when the members of the new class were given three hours of psy- chological examinations. These tests, which were given at the re- quest of the national CAA board were conducted by Professor Ern~ est M. Ligon. Each student will eventually be given a total of four hours of testing. Professor Thatcher said that the heavy flight training program out- lined for the .primary course had made it necessary to concentrate all efforts on completing arrange- ments for this class as soon as pos- sible. He said that plans for the secondary course, and the names of those men who have fulfiiled the requirements, would :be announced in a few days. The Union men who are enrolled in the spring primary course are as follows: Richard M. Adams '44 J. Clark Alberts '44, George A. Bas~ kous '44, Robert M. Bishop '43, Clif- ford E. Bowdish '42, Robert W. Breiling '44, Donald B. Burns '44 William R. Coates '42, Marvin E: second behind Tommy Dorsey in the campus popularity poll con- ducted two weeks ago by the Pt·om Committee. Dorsey was unavail- acble, Messenger said, since he had previously signed a four-week theatre contract which includes the date of the dance here. Success was found almost immediately as Messenger made contact with Spivak's manager, in keeping with the committee's desire to follow the results of the campus p01l in obtaining a band. Charlie Spivak, not particularly well-known for his recordings or lor his radio work, has always proven popular on personal ap- pearances, particularly with col- leges in the South. His most re· cent thour through the southern states included stops at dances at Duke University, the University of North . C~r?lina, Clemson College, and Vtrgmta Polytechnic Institute. D.a~es for the near future, in ad- ditt~n to the one here, will be at Jumor Proms at Yale and Pitts- burgh Universities. Exceptionally Good Break \In view of that record,\ Mes- sen~er pointed out, \I think we're gettmg. an . exceptionally good break m gettmg Spivak. He's al- ways popular at college dances, even. th?ugh peo-ple aren't too en- tl~usias~w over his recordings or h1s rad10 broadcasts.\ Now ~hat the biggest problem confrontmg the Prom Committee has .been surmounted, details such as ticket sales and decoration will soon be considered and completed by the committee. In Spivak, Messenger has pro- cured a worthy successor to .Prom Bands of the past three years. L~st year, Benny Goodman fur- mshed the music for the guests of the Class of 1942, while the year before saw Union's eminently suc- cessful Prom featuring Glenn Mill- er and his orchestra. Going back to. 1939, it was Russ Morgan, who, shll n_ear the top in popularity at that ttme, played at the Prom spon- sored by the Class of 1940. ----0>--- Ripley's Gloves Weren't Souvenirs Vast Assemblage Passes Student Body ConstitutionAmendments Unanimously~ 4.

LaPann voiced the doubts in the minds of his supporters co·ncerning the wis- dom of the requirement that 15 per cent of the class sign a nominating petition. However, Dorsman quick- ly squelched any mounting opposi- tion. and all the vast assemblage voted in favor of the amendment. To the accompaniment of cheers and enthusiastic statements of both approval and di~appvoval, the Union College undergraduate body passed three vital amendments to the constitution of the student body yesterday morning as popular ap- proval occasioned the passage of the amendments by acclamation. Although the worth of the amend- ments underwent serious discus- sion, including s~veral indications of doubt by a powerful bloc of sophomores, Student Body Presi- dent Abraham Dorsman, '42, ably defended the action of the· Student Council Executive Committee and of the Student Council itself.

Til<• :-\Nihil' Boart! ---· - ~-- ------ THE NEWSPAPER, COLLEGE AND THE WAR When the editorial fo1tunes of a newspa- per fall into new hands, it is customary for the new 1nanagement to set forth the stand- ards of ideals and policies \\'hich it intends to follow during its incumbancy. Once estaiJ- lished, this set of purposes is to l.le used as a :oort of \yard-stick\ upon which are to be measured the decisi0ns to IJe made and the actions to be taken in the future. The basic idea behind this sort of thing is a good one. It pt·ovides for something solid and lasting which wm help to steady the paper against the hectic days through which it is sme to pass, days when rule by temporary emotion and biased personal opinion would most cer- tainly be dangerous. One great fault with \New Year's Resolu- tions\ of this type is that the ideals and pur- poses set up are oftea not sufficiently funda- mental to cover all the various situations into \vhich a newspaper may be thrown. This is particularly true in a small college like Union, aad the situa:tion he1·e is made all the more acute by the pressu1·e of wm·-time cir- cumstances upon the life of the college. One of the most insidious effects of war upon civilian life is the undermining of mo1·ale and reason, and the causing or a sort of hysteria brought about by the destruction of civilians' sense of values. Thus it is that a newspaper like The Concordiensis should try to provide some measure of solidarity which will em- phasize the importance of \carrying on as usual\ and yet help to direct the activities which the College, as a part of American life, is making toward success in the present conflict. The \business as usual\ ph1·ase demands something of an explanation, lest it be mis- taken for an exp1·ession of the tendency to- ward lethargy and complacency which many Americans fear is undermining our national morale and seriously hindering our war ef- fort. In this respect, we should heartily agree with the Educational Policies Commission, which dismissed the idea of \education as usual\ in its latest report on policies for educators for the duration. An account of this report is printed as a front-pag·e story in this paper today. \Business as usual\ for Union or for any other educational institu- tion is, of course, out of the question in its most obvious .sense, if it is to faH in line with the rest of the nation in the effort to win the wm·. Howevet·, it seems to us (and the general feeling of the Policies Commission Report is along these lines) that any change in \business\ should be of a supplementary nature, and not a curtailment of normal, sometimes essential functions. It is such a course as this that the Administration of the College appears to be following in the changes that it is making in the life of the school. Falling into this scheme of things will be the main purpose of the Concordy for the next t\velve months. Before that time, we shall, in all probability, have felt the pinch of paper shortage, of personnel depletion and all the other omni-present hardships which the war will bring. Nevertheless, we shall at- tempt to go on \doing business as usual\ printing the news as accurately, as rapidly and as interestingly as is ·within om· power and ability to do it, holding om columns ever open to expression oi opinion by anyone who desires to use them, tempering our editorial policies with a good deal of thought and de- liberation, making the Concordr itself a liv- ing- institution, and being always ready to accept the extra, additional burdens that the \\'ar will b1·ing. We shall try to keep the cam- pus informed on all things pertinent to the future of college men fo1· the duration, a task which will include such fields as the draft, defense industries, and opportunities in the armed forces. It shall be our purpose to do all these things, yet always remember- ing-, whatever be our responsibilities along every-day journalistic lines, our greatest one at present, one which transcends all others, is to om country and its people, in this, its greatest test. THE SUMMER SITUATION One question that is prevalent on the cam- pus these days, and one that has yet to be conclusively answered, has to do with the number of students who will register for Union's first Summer School session. The question itself is of relatively little impor- tance to anyone except the administration just now, and the administration, as of last week, announced that a survey would soon be taken in an effort to determine just how many men would be attending school here this .:summer. The reason for the delay in making this survey has been largely IJecause of a number of factors having to do with finance. \What \Viii the tuition be?\ and \Are scholarships to IJe awarded?\ were the two most important among these uncertain- ties. One of these, the one concerning tui- tion, has already been answered, while the second is still hanging fire. Coupled with this question is another fac- tor which seems destined to be of no little imp01tance. This has to do with the courses which are to be offered by the various divi- sions in the Summer Session. It is known that there is considerable dissatisfaction \vith the present program, that students feel that to come this summer would be a \waste of time\ as far as deriving any appreciable benefit from the courses offered, and that choice of courses has been so limited as to make the Summer Session definitely not worthwhile. Public announcement by the administra- tion of its decision on these two questions is most certainly in order before the student body can be expected accurately to respond to a survey such as was announced last week: (1) Will scholarship holders receive grants covering the summer months, and if so, in what proportion to the normal amount, and (2) How much will be heeded the de- sires of the student body with regard to the adding of courses to the course schedule al- ready announced? With an eye toward helping to clear up the latter situation, The Concordiensis has de- voted Page 4 of today's issue to authorita- tive statements of just what courses are now being planned, together with a good deal of explanatory material as to the aims and pur- poses of each course being offered in each division. The question seems to be most acute among students in Divisions I and II, where a wide field of electives is normally offe1·ed. EDITORIAL 2 Were Student Aetions At Mountebanks' .Movies Justified?

How The Other Half Lives f l------~----------------------------------------l Yale New Haven, Conn.-From now on you'll be able to recognize a Yale man by his grip. If he swings you around his head and snaps your sacro-iliac, you'll know he's the real thing. Yale University is adopting a course in jujitsu as a ,part of its wartime physical education pro- gram, President Seymour an- nounced Sunday. Hamilto.n Clinton, N. Y., Feb. 14.-Under the administl·atton of President W. H. Cowley, himself an educational research specialist, Hamilton Col- lege is making a conscious effort to preserve In the college library a complete record of Hamilton's year- by-year development. To this end, complete phono- graphic recordings are made of sig- nificant college events, and the re- sulting records are !tept on file for use whenever they may be needed. One of the most recent additions to the collection covers the special war convocation held in the chapel three days after Pearl Harbor. Commencement exercises, impor- tant lectures, special musical and dramatic events are similarly pre- served. Supplementing the recordings, Hamilton College has also obtained complete, virtually professional, equipment necessary for taking and projecting motion pictures. Eventually, the college plans to prepare yearly a newsreel which will put together on a single role the main events of each college year. This will not only serve as \an historical document\ but will be copied and presented .before alumni associations. Jokes Smelly The present series of pictures is admittedly below the standard set in past years, but this has been due largely to the exhaustion of new titles to show at reasonable rates. The ,preponderance of good choices 9till provides, however, an enjoya·ble tt·eatment of a phase of the evolution of the movie. Attend- ance at those pictures which have some personal appeal does provide relaxation if not the ultra-modern complete escape. We can't expect to go with the intent of escaping boredom entirely. If you had not liked many of the pictures· for themselves, Dimi, you probably would not have seen most of every one of them. You must have smell- ed the corny character of most of the makeshift student jokes. Even if Dr. Fox did commit the \horri- bly\ human crime of enjoying a few quips at Moana·s expense, he was not wrong in failing to stop the first night program. Student and the ,patron comments have indi- cated furthermore that your plea for a campus poll on the worth of the pictures would be not much more useful than a recount of the national census or of Roosevelt's rumored election. The Motion Picture Committee obviously believed that approxi- mately 200· dollars would be too (Continued on Page 4) 3 Th news .migh persc strai1 relati lt is whic: wish< In integ sis. 1 most its c and legia· We I tPrin raJ.e in til tc ac nece~ thesE uutsi have fair whic signi Spt tanc< mane and throt can man] deatl the only quuli Fr• se:nt col:le: casic this glad! an 1 whic miss mess get beca· WrOL Th sue migb tome adop ly w tere1 with whic self.

This code would have to include sportsmanship, fair play, and teamwerk-elements which have taken en justifiable significance today. Sport has increased in impor- tance today because of the de- ma,nds for physical preparation and the realization that only through activity along these lines can we muster and build physical manpower to wage war. a fight to death.

A story in the Rutgers Targum may give us a preview of what can happen here. It seems that not only the academic but the at·h- letic pr·ogram as well has been speeded up at Rutgers. In making the adjustment, \the instructors tried to give .the students some- thing they'd enjoy and appreciate.\ Well, they got it! \'Although injuriE-s are to be expected when 1,600 men exercise at least four times in two weeks,' the athletic department head ex· pressed his regret 'to see anyone hurt' and expressed confidence that 'it will be adjusted in the next week or so.' \The director still thinks everyone should learn how to fall backwards.

Y., FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 20, 1942 Price 5c 'Hit Parade' ·Hits College (a·•npus In '44-' 45 Dan(e Late Leave ior Skidmore Girls Has ~een Acquired; Busses To Be Run Union's \Hit .Parade,\ the ten tunes most popular with Union· students, will be a feature at the Freshman - Sophomore dance on, March 7 when Maestro Fred Gray and his boys play the favorite tunes of the day. A poll wi1l be taken next Wed-, nesday, February 25 at daily chap- el on what the students want to hear at the dance. This will mark. · the first time at Union that those attending a coHege social will be given an opportunity to select the· numbers to which they want to dance. The \Hit Parade\ also continues the policy set by the dance com- mittee in making the social affair an \all-Union\ informal dance. The dance is open to the entire col- lege. The price has been set at $1.10 per couple. Still another feature which promises to make the Freshman- Sophomore Dance on Murch 7 a success is the fact that Skidmore girls have been granted special ,ate permission.\ Those girls at- tending the dance will not be re- quited to return to their dorms until 1:00 a.m. This factor alone points to increased attendance over class dances of previous years, because never before have such arrangements been made. Bus Fatalities Another difficulty which has been 1 ecognized and accounted for is the problem of transportation. ln view of the tire rationing de- er eefi cars will not be a;vailable in such numbers as in previous years so the dance committee has ar- ranged to have busses run up to Saratoga and back for the dance as well as to take the girls home at 12:00 midnight, so they can be back by 1:00 a.m. If the demand is sufficient, more busses will be char- tered to accommodate the extra students, but one bus will definite- ly run, unless the number of stu- dents taking advantage of it is too small. It is expected that the bus tickets will sell for about 75c. A yet, the dance committee is not certain what kind of refresh- ments will be ser:.red at the dance, but every effort will be made to obtain something other than \grape-soda.\ -·-D---- Aiumnus Is Reported Captured by Japan A Union man is among the group of Navy and Marine Corps men be- lieved to have been captured by the Japanese, it was announced yester- day at the headquarters of the Third Naval District, New Yorlc Ensign Belmont M. Williams, '34, is ·believed to be one of the prison- ers of war acquired by the Japan- ese at the downfall of Wake Island. He was assigned to that Pacific post soon after he received his commission as an ensign in the Naval reserve in May 1941. Ensign Williams, a Schenectady man, is a member of the American Society of Civil Engineers and was employed for a time by the Amer- ican Locomotive Company as a draftsman. He was also an engi- neer for the New York State high- way Commission. The Navy Department explained that the exact status of the men is unl,nown because of the uncertain- ty of communications, and that the Navy coulu not have exact in- formation on the whereabouts of all men serving in its forces. \How- ever, from information that had been available up to the time or near the time of the capture of some of the groups, and from the rosters of personnel serving at the different places, it was presumed that those not otherwise accounted for are prisoners of the Japanese,\ the Navy Department reported. ----0 Wendell Willkie Observes His Fiftieth Birthday Wendell L.

Of the 18 fraternities in the college, 17 are expected to initiate men tomor- row. The other one, Phi Sigma Delta, held its regular annual in- itiation last December. This will be the first time in four years that the college has set aside · a \late\ date for initiation week- end. Upon petition of the Interfra- ternity Council last fall, the date was moved from December 12 to a tentative date in early March. Then it was moved back into Februa1y four weeks ago.

The engagements of one alum- r:us of the college and one under- gr·ad uate were announced over the past weekend. Wa!te1· Christopher Shaw '41, is engaged to Miss Jeanne Carol Ken- yon, of Schenectady, according to an announcement made at a recep- tion at the Mohawk Golf Club Sat- urday by Miss Kenyon's parents. Miss Kenyon is a student· at Edge- wood Park Junior College in Briar- cliff Manor, N. Y. Her father is an official of the General Electric Company. Howard A. Lawrence, ex-'42, of Garden City, L.

Mr. and Mrs. Robert Folsom, of Reading, Mass., announced the en- gagemen:t of their daughter, Mary, to Emlen T. Hutchins '42, of Ma- lone. Miss Folsom is a junior this year at Skidmore College.

Electric Glovea Shoe Returned Promptly Prompt return of the electric glove and shoe thrown to the Daily Assembly audience Tues- day morning was reported last night by President Fox. A pair of gloves and a pair of shoes were tossed to the ·stu- dents for examination at the conclusion of Mr. C. M. Rip- 'ley's ta;lk explaining the self- warming apparel. One gl'ove and shoe were returned, but the other apparently were con- sidered souvenirs by their re- cipients until the appearance of Tuesday afternoon's Con- cordiensis, explaining that the glove and shoe were far too valuable to be given away. Dr. Fox said that both arti- cles were returned promptly Wednesday morning. Glee Club Picks Contest Number Alma Mater, Two Others Chosen for Nation-wide Collegiate Competition Three selections to be sung and recorded by the Glee Club as its entry in the Fred Waring-spon- sored National Collegiate Glee Club Competition have been decided upon, John L. Grow, '42 announced yesterday. They will be Arcadelt's \Ave Maria\ the Negro spiritual, \Steal Away\ and \Ode to Old Union.\ The three numbers were decided upon after consideration ·by Dr. El- mer A. Tidmarsh and members of the Club, Grow said. They will comply with the rules of the con- test as set down by Mr. Waring. The first number is to •be from the respective Glee Club'·s reper- toire, and it was felt that \Ave Maria\ would be the best possible choice for this .category. The sec- ond number, \Steal Away,\ is the only required number of the three, and the only number to be sung by every group competing in the con- test. Copies of this number were received by Grow late last week from contest headquar·ters. It is one of the numbers included in last year's program as given by the Glee Club, but it .has been pointed out that the present arrangem~nt differs from the one followed by the Club last year, being one done by Roy Ringwald, one of the top anangers in the Waring organiza- tion. !Whearsals Start The Alma :Ylater was the most likely choice for the third number, which was specified as a college song, to be sung by the Club in unison. It was considered to be the one college song most suitable for chot·ai work of th[.s type. Grow said that rehearsal on all these numbers started Wednesday, with particular emphasis on the spiritual. He has as yet received no announcement from Waring as to the date the record must be made. It will in all probability be made at one of the local radio stu- dios, where conditions will be most favorable. It will be handled by technicians sent by Waring to the various colleges. The contest, which embraces col- lege glee clubs all over the nation, offers as first prize in the various geographical districts a trip, free of expense. for the sectional finals, out of which will come the fore- most glee club in the nation. Survey of Summer School Enrollment To Be Undertaken Secret Ballot by Three Lower Classes Thursday Should Clear Up Doubt Union's first official effort to find out just how great a percentage of the three under classes plan to re- turn to college this summer win be made next Thursday morning in Daily Assembly, President Fox an- nounced yesterday. It will take the form of a survey to be conducted by ':leans of individual ballots, to be f1!led out .by the members of the three lower classes. In addition to information ac- tually showing the number who have already decided definitely to attend Union's first emergency Summer Session, the survey will furnish both the number of stu- dents who are as yet uncertain a·bout their summer status, those who have definitely decided against coming, and the reasons why these two situations exist in individual cases. To Probe Reasons Through consideration of the rea- sons given why students m-e still uncertain ·about the summer school the administration hopes to be abl~ to make a fairly accurate estimate as to the number of students who will event·ually enroll. In addition, the college will be able to use this data later, when the still undecided scholarship situation is cleared up. If scholarships are granted for the summer term, those students who gave the lack of scholarshi·p awards as their reasons for uncertainty can thus be reconsidered. The same will hold true for any other reason given by a large .group of students, which can later ·be cleared up by college action. A bill soon to be considered in Congress may change the future of the engineering student, Dr. Fox indicated. The bill calls for the al- iottment of money to technilogical students, in the form of scholar- ship grants, he said. If the bill is passed by Congress, which is ex- pected to act on it by the end of the month, Union's engineering school may open on an almost full- time basis this summer. a---- Seniors, Sophomores To Take Record Exams Members of the senior and sophomore classes will begin an eight hour session of examina- tions Monday morning at eight o'clock, in an effort to determine their in.tellectual attainment in re- lation to that of other students throughout the country. The examinations, which are un- der the direction of Professor Ernest M. Ligon, will be exactly similar to those being taken at the same time by O'ther college stu- dents throughout the nation. E:<tch student will be given a profile chart of attainment, to in- dicate his scores in relart:ion to those of other students with simi- lar academic experience. The examinations are designed specifically to measure knoWledge, not ability, and cover the principal subjects in the college curriculum. The 800 questions to be included will cover physics, chemistry, lit- m·ature, fine ar.ts, mathematics, verbal factors, biology, social studies, and one advanced sUibject. The flnai .;cene presented the Concordiensis' conception of what happens when the newly-established Committee on Education meets, and was titled, \Snow\White Father and the Seventeen Dwarfs.\ Presi- dent Fox is acclaimed by the \dwarfs explains the new Three- year Plan. and then introduces to the audience and to the committee around him Union's honorary chan- cellor for the year, \that great Re- publican\ Wendell L. Willkie. After exchanging pleasantries with the honored guest, Dr. Fox then con- tinues with the ·business of the meeting and ends the show on a serious note as he considers Amer- ica's .present position and predicts the future, telling the audience that \Wishing Won't Make It So.\ The applicants were required to sign a pledge to enlist in the mili- tary effort of the nation on com- pletion of their course unless the government wishes them to take further training leading to service as inst!'uctors or ferry pilots. In addition to the pledge all ap- plicants were required to take a series of aptitude tests under the supervision of Dr. Ernest M. Ligon. This was the first part of the ground school training. Flight training is scheduled to :begin next week at the Haven Flying School.

Some indication of the reception given the show .by the audience is the following open letter to the show's author, written by an appre- ciative member of the student body: An Open Letter to Stanll:\y Green: 19 de febrero de 1942 Dear Stanley, We all had a wonderful time last night at your musical comedy.

Steps have been taken on various campuses to deemphasize them, eveHtually to eradicate them. For us here at Union, however, fra- ternities have always and, we feel, will al- ways play a tremendous part in the life of the college. It was here so many years ago that college men began to look fo1· symbols and cere- monies and creeds to bind them together in the brotherhood they felt so strongly but found so hard to express in other ways.· And they have been mainta.ining the same ideals of brotherhood and lasting friendships down across one hund1·ed yem·s and rnore. And so, let us remember the pros, not the cons, of Union's fratemity system, and cele- brate with them the occasion they are cele- brating: the induction of new spil'it into thei1· time-honored institutions, as insurance against the future, and as their pa1·t in bind- ing a group, a college, and a nation together. HOW LONG 'TIL REVEILLE7 Newspaper headlines tell us the day-by- day story of a war that is going on in Europe and in Asia. They tell us of distant towns and rivers and naval bases. They tell us of things and places that seem so far off that the meaning of events in tem1s of America's part in the struggle seems remote and quite detached from the catastl'ophies of the war- torn world of today. American attitude to- ward the war is changing, but it is changing after, and not before the world-shaking events of each passing week l.Jring the scene of actual struggle closer and closer to our shores. The first, awful shock of the events of December 7, 1941 stunned the nation. It did not a waken it. The loss of ;\lanila and .i\Ia- laya and Singapore did not awaken it. The attacks of German submarines up and down our Atlantic seaboat·d, the sally of the U-boats into the waters of the CatTibbean did not v.:aken it. The nation is being stirred by these events, there can be no doubt of that, but only momentarily. That basic feel- ing of detachment and complacency which has been so prevalent here since the Euro- pean War began in 1939, still holds too firm a grip upon American thought and philos- ophy to make the War Effort effective to its highest degree. Consider as an excellent example the shel- tered confines of Cnion College. Here, in a normal!~· pl'ogressi ve college (and the college itself is still progressive, always among the leaders in new thoughts and policies) the students, in line with the rest of the nation, refuse to consider the head-lines as any kind of a warning to, \Wake Up.\ What are the tendencies here which would lead one to take such a pessimistic attitude toward the War Effort among college students? We should offer as a typical example the attitude which is being taken toward the proposed Summer Session. It is an attitude of condescension, rather than of enthusiasm, such as is to be found at certain other col- leges, where underclasses are enrolling as high as 90 lJc for the summer schools. Given the chance to finish college and be awarded a diploma, students refuse to let themselves believe that the future for them is anything but bright in its prospect. Even the sight of class-mates and fraternity brothers leaving for training camps fails to impress appre- ciably upon them their great good fortune at having the chance to finish. They fail to consider the value of a colleg·e diploma after the ·war, but instead, complain and find fault with the compulsory Physical Training Program and \run down\ the sum- mel' school because the choice of courses given them is too small. In the light of the events of the past few weeks, .such an atti- tude is most difficult to understand. In individual cases, \\'e suspect it v.-ill re- quire actual induction into the mmed forces of the nation to bring home the actual facts of the situation to many. For them, it ·will be too late. For the nation as a whole, it may take a great war crisis, involving Amer- ican soldiers, pe1·haps on American soil OJ' in American watel's, actually to awaken this great democracy, which now only stirs un- comfortably at each new enem~· thrust and then relaxes with the self-assurance that \when the time comes, we'll be ready to give as much and more than we have to take.\ We have no doubt that this is true. The only fallacy in such an a!'gument is this: The time has come already, but Ame!'ica is not yet prepared. When we are prepared, we shall certainly win, for not even the shocl< re- quired to arou::;e the country will not be great enough to deal anything like a knock-out punch. America's g-reatest asset. the ~olictar­ ity of all its people, will never allo\\' its peo- ple to lose the wa1·. llut, in winning- it, n price must be paid for all this pel'iod of in- difference and complacency. It would appear more profitable to wake up now than then. In the case of individual Union men, would it not be better to finish school, g-et yom di- ploma, and then fig-ht, knowing that when the war is finally over, you will be in much more favorable position, not only to aid your- self in readjusting to a new life, but also to help America back to the paths of peace? There can be but one logical answer to such a question, and that in the affirmative. Union College and all America must soon· come to the realization that the normal con-I duct of normal times is not at all possible in I times like these. SHIU~KONG YUEN It is all too seldom that we get the chance to see a real artist here among us, unassum- ing, modest, but nevertheless great in the mastery of the field of expression he loves. The photographic exhibit in the library of the work of \l\Iac\ Yuen seems. to us to be evidence of the presence of such a one. I We should like, therefore, to extend to 1 l\Iac our sincere congratulations, for choosing and mastering and sticking to his hobby un- til it has reached the place it has, and to thank him for the opportunity to view and enjoy the fruits of his workmanship. I far better entertainment at one of the stage, They dashed through ~ wonderfully off-!{ey. the movie houses dewntown. Feur year~ ago, when the movie~ were fii,st introduced, they were de- signed for the entertainment and education of Union students. A regular narrative went along with them to explain how the movie had progressed and the ·best of foreign and domestic movies were screened. Students flocked· ·to the perform- ances and the! e were no remarks. Whoever made the choice made a good one. The second year the movies were equally as good. Last year they were better. But this year, with the exception of \The Ghost Goes West,\ \The Lady Vanishes\ and the one other movie, they seem to repre:oent to the average student about the worst choice possible. Picked without imagination and without even a prior knowledge of what they were, they have lacked a connecting narrative. I think the Schenectady paotr ons as well as the students are being cheated ·by The Mountebanks. The films this year are shown without any order or de- velopment-and if they are to be educational some sort of lecture ought to go along with them. I am sure that Professor Smith, Professor Coffin and Mr. Rust would not assign their students textbool' chapters to ·be read and then deliver no elaboration upon them in class. Yet that is what they are asking Union students to do. \See the movies tread the text) and get what you can out of it.\ If the committee is an expert one on movies, and one must believe them to be so ·or they would never have been allowed by The ~iountebanks or the administration to pick the movies, thPy owP it to the students to delivn some so1t of explanation of the techniques of each picture I think the three gentlemen owe an apology to the students and to the townspeople who were forced to ~it through a film which glorified thP Ame1·ican investment :banker as being the safeguard of the people's money. The film. which involved a \Dean\ of the Lehigh Unive1 sity Business School, and Lowell Thoma!i, a~ well as a few reassur- tng looking actot·s, repeated over and over again that the investment banker makes a!! sorts of investi- gations before investing savings in industries which set the American standard and make the \American Way of Life.\ Maybe college stu- dents of '20s believe that, but we, who have lived through the '30s and know why such government organization!:' l:'.s the SEC are neces- sary, couldn't swallow the movie. And it, by the way, contained sev- eral cra~ks about hair-brained eco- nomic theories about ··now.\ Even yom· townpeople patrons couldn't stand the moviP. I watC'hed them walk out.

As showmen, Olsen and Johnson are among the best, but as comedians they lack the ability to have audiences really Uke them, which is one of the fu·ndamenta•l requisites for good comic.s. They seem to us to be two rather sadistic chaps who take a peculiar delight in trying to drive everyone just as wacky as they seem to 'be. Martha Raye bounces around, and in spite of it all, Hugh Herbert is still a funny fellow. At the State we have another in- teresting transformation. The play, \The Chocolate Soldier\ was a mu- sical adaptation of Be1nard Shaw's \Arms and the Man\ set to Dscar Straus' music. The film version still retains the title and the songs, but instead of the Shaw play, it now uses the plot of Ferenc M0!- nar's \The Guardsman\.

Jeff court. Coach Lloyd Jordan used his entire squad of thirteen men in chalking up this victory. The Purple and White led all the way and were neV'er in danger of losing the lead which they buill up in the fi·rst minutes of play. \Vithin the first six minutes of · the game the Jeffs had run l:tP a 10-0 score, and fol!lr minutes later they were ahead by 18-2. Coach Ralph Semerad's strategy went sour in the first half, for the. Garnet utilized a man-for-man de- fense and the Amherst quintet was able to penetrate it at will. Layup shots swished through the cords for alm0st all 0f the 31 paints made by the Jeffs in the first half. In the latter part of the first ha1f the Dutchmen found the mat'k and had rung up 11 points before in- termission. In the second half the Ga.rnet held the Jeffs even. They changed to a zone defense and were able to check the purple scoring ram- page. The game was played in the Am- herst field house 0n a wooden plat- form sun0unded by a dirt floor in the center of the building. Great was .the surprise of the Garnet when they tried to dribble the ball, for lo and behold, the ball would hardly bounce on the \dead\ floor. Another piece of tough luck was that manv shots aimed at the bas- ket hit the rim and bounced out ~gain. The Dutchmen couldn't ad- . iust their shooting to the back- boards on the Amherst court. Per- haps after using the backboards on our court they found it difficult to judge their shots on the Jpff court. The next and last game on the \ars!tv basketball schedule is the .second clash with the R. P. I. En- l'ineers-on our court Saturday, February 28. It's not an encore that we want, but a change in tune.

He pointed out that cold weather could easily cause shin splints, heavy colds and other costly ail- ments. Practice will begin imme- diately af.ter his return fl'Om an admission office trip to New Eng- land.

Wlyr a!nttrorhtrusta FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 20, 1942 GENERAL 4 New Order Gives Medical Students Draft Deferment Pre-Medics Accepted For Approved Schools Included in Exemption Chicago - ·Colonel Leonard G. Roundtree, medical director of the National Selective Service organ·iza- tion, announced Sunday a new pol- icy under which first and second- year medical students and pre- medical student who have been ac- cepted for matriculation in a.p- proved medical schools wHl t·eceive draft deferments. Heretofore only third and fourth- yea<~· medical students and internes have been eligible for commissions which released them from the draft, Colonel Roundtree said. The ruling, by the adjutant gen- eral, applies to students in <7P· proved medical, dental and vetenn- ary •schools. The men will t•eceive commissions in the Army Medical Administrative Reser\'<' Corps and will be placed on inactive duty un- til they have received license~ to practice. The commissions may be withdrawn whenever th!' students fall behind in their school work. A similar plan has .been adopted by the Navy, Dr. Morris FishbPin, edi- tor of \The American Medical Asso- ciation Journal,\ said. Colonel Roundtree spoke before the annual meeting of the national conference on medical set·vice. ---0---- Tidmarsh's Recital Will Furnish 'fun' The progt·am for organ recital number 515 in the series .by Dr. El- mer A.

The banquet and dance for Sat- urday night will be held in the Log House at North River. It is pos- sible, Baas said, that colored movies taken during the last I.O.C.A. week-end will be shown at the banquet. Baas said that the chaperones had not yet been chosen, but add- ed that they will probably be named shortly. The entire week- E:nd will cost the Union men who attend only three dollars, he said. It is important that students in- terested make their intention to attend known before March 7, Baas said, pointing out that the week-end's date is the first week- end ·in spring vacation.

This field is largely a receivi·ng center for new aviation cadets where they get their preliminary tra:ining of aca- demic instruction, drill with rifle, and athletics.

Maybe this post isn't so big, but we're so busy that I have only seen him once· or twice . He feels fine and deems it good ex- perience-one never to be forgot- ten ...

It'o; \Happy Bil·thday\ again for L 1 nion College tomorrow for the one hundred and forty-seventh time. Just how appropl'iate that v;;ord \happy\ is, is a matter which might be open to debate. The \happy\ ele- ment in the world today is certain!~· obscure enough to cause even the most optimistic of us to search about for another more logical word. Even the long finger of current events has stretched four o1· five thousand miles from the Netherlands East Indies to mar the very celebration of the college's birthday. And the sudden cancellation of Dr. Loudon's visit is only one of the mino1· factors which would tend to make this birthday celebration anything but a happy one. Eve1·yone is cog- nizant of the uncertainty of the future and of its dark complexion. And so it might be well to dv:ell upon the past fo1· a while, to revel in the sturdy characte1· of an institu- tion which has come through neal'ly a cen- tury and a half of existence and still lives, lives to carry on for as many more yem·s into the future. The Past This is not the first bilthday which the college has observed when the press of worldly matters has been almost overwhelm- ing it. Remember'? Union was born at the same time as the nation itself, bom into a.n unfriendly world which might have snuffed it out bef01·e it was old enough to be known beyond the vale of the ~Ioha\vk. It had just turned 1:5 when it got its first taste of war. It felt the pull of the West sapping its stt·ength, and still kept on, and survived. It sensed the shock of 1860, and gave of its ::;trength and life at Bull Run and Ft·edel'icks- burg and Gettysburg, and, \vith the nation, was reborn in unity. It took its place with the rest of America in 1917, and Union's name was carried to the forests of the Ar- gonne and to the banks of the river Rhine. And now, with the 1·est of the country that has mothet·ed and suppored it, it has felt the dull, cold shock of Pearl Harbot· and :\Ianila, and is now giving of its life and limbs to the fighting forces of that country. It is no new experience for Union. But it avails us little to pay tribute to Dil·ck Romeyn and Phillip Schu~·ler if we fail to pause and mediate upon the stem stuff those men, and countless hund1·eds mol'e down through the yem~s, we1·e made of. They founded a college and they helped to found America. They made something lasting, and they made an invaluable contribution to the future of the country they had just finished fighting to create. For we like to think Union College and colleges iike it, and the United States of America as institutions which have gone hand-in-hand through trial and tl'i_lmla- tion, through prosperity and wealth, through periodo; of war, tht·ough periods of peace, each one an invaluable aid to the other, each oHe, in fact. a part of the other. The Present What about the Union of today? We have been pooh-poohed fo1· suggesting that it wa:;; still alive, still progressive, still making ad- vances in the fields which really count. We reiterate, it has been among- the first to recognize and act upon the changes neces- sary for a concerted, efficient war effort. True, it has yet to g·ain the populm· reputa- tion of having unbeaten athletic team.s, but this is but another of the fields that show up against the whole pictul'e of life today as trivial, pitifully 1,mimportant. Yet it main- tains athletic opportunities, just as it main- tains so many other opportunities which, in themselves, are of little importance, hut \vhich all have their contributions to make to a well-rounded existence. The college has its faults, yes, of course. Faults are one sign to be looked for, as proof that an institution is still living, still vital, still human. But it is still hand-in-hand with America, still an in- valuable part of Ame1·ica's way of life. The Future The Future these days is nothing to pre- dict about. For predictions are based to a great extent upon the hopes and fears of the forecaster, and, mm·e often than not, result in disappointment and discouragement. We have had this lesson set before us all too often of late. Union's future hope lies not in its pa:;;t, but in its present. It rests with those who make up the college of today. l.'nion will be tomorro\v what America is to- morrow, and America will be what American brains and brawn and \Vealth and courage make it. So we g·et the same sort of picture as we look into the future as we did \Vhen we looked wistfully into the past: the small college and the great nation, each closely bound up with the other, each depending on the other, each giving to the other, taking from the other, living, in, for, and by the other. And So, For Now •• • So that is Union over one hundred and forty-seven years. We ourselves have ac-· tually had contact with it for about two and a half years. But on the basis of those two and a half years alone, our birthday greet- ings for 1942 find an excellent means of ex- pl·ession in a few familiar lines: \ ...

As a means of accomplishing this, there could be created a branch of service having military status, to be paid and maintained and to be known as the War Tech- nical Training Corps.

This season marks Union's 43rd year of basketball. The sport was resumed in 1906 and has continued uninterrupted since then. Union and Yale played the first intercollegiate basketball game, ac- cording to Tom O'Reilly, oolumnist in PM, but Union records contain no evidence that such a game was played. Verification has been impos- sible to get, but O'RPilly has been queried on the source of his infor- mation and may come through with the key to the mystery.

Outlining some of Gray's rec0nt engagements in the Capital Dis- trict, Comrey quoted John Adam- zevich, '43, and Ed Smith, '44, as having been favorably impressed by the orchestra's work at the Skid- more Winter Carnival. The Kappa Nu fraternity was en- tertained by a portion of the Gray orehestra at their annual initiation dance, Comrey said. He said that Jack Family, '44. had reported fav- orably on the band's performance. Although Comrey said that in the interests of objectivity he was forced to report that one member of his class, Seymour Meisel, did not like the band, he added that Sam- uel Capola, '43, had termed it the best small organization in the capi- tal district. Comrey said that Capola was familiar with the or- chestra. \We would like to repeat that we plan to run a bus to Saratoga to accomoda te those students having no other method of getting their dates here,\ Comrey said. \Every- one interested should get in touch with me at the Alpha Delta Phi house as soon as possible.\ Comrey pointed out that in the event that there were an in::;uffi- cient number of seats on the bus, it would be a case of \first come, fir:5t served\ as far as the assigning of seats was concerned. He ad- vised everyone interested to make his reservations early. ---a----- HANDBALL Th~ semi-final round of each bracket mus-t be completed on or Di-fferences Are Stressed Rather Than Resemblances, Says Levy in Town Meeting Voluntary changing of foreign- sounding names t.o forms Je:;::; likely to set their owners apart from their English-speaking American neigh- bors was advocated at the 95th Em- pire State Town Meeting in Old Chapel In an address by T. Aaron Levy, President of the Americaniza- tion League of Syracuse and On- ondaga County. The address was read by Presi<ient Fox because Mr. Levy was unable to attend. The negative argument to the topic, \Should Foreign-Sounding Family Name::; Be Changed?\ was given by Professor Arthur P. Cole- man, lecturer in east European lan- guages at Columbia University. Hinder Carpers Mr. Levy said that to children of immigrants who were born here or arrived here in infancy and who in the main are a part of our common life and feel themselves Americans, theit• foreign names are a stum- bling block to their Americaniza- tion in the political, business and social life of the new land, and a barrier to their full participation in our democratic processes. \Through repetition of their for- eign names during the years, dif- ferences are stressed rather than resemblances,\ he said. \America gives its all to new- comers-its priceless privileges, the wealth of its inspiring history, par- ticipation in a common democracy, and its way of life of equal rights and duties,\ he said. Mr. Coleman said, \Change is in- evitable in the spelling of names as in everything else. I daresay if I were to emigrate to Poland my own name - Coleman - would be spelled with a 'K' instead of a ·c· and would eventually get rid of the 'e' in order to be pronounced correctly. A similar process is going on in the United States, and it is nPither possible nor desirable to try to stop it.\ \What I do object to, however, is the revolutionary act committed by many of our Americans of deliber- ately abandoning a name that to them means something for one that to them means nothing,\ he added. before \Vednesday, February 25. ~--~----~------------------ ~----~------------------------------------------.

Any stu- dents interested in work on sets are asked to see Charles Lottin- ridge of Phi Gam or Stanley GrPen, North College. This classic of the modern Irish theater, written by John Milling- ton Synge, which has been called suitably a \matchless example of Celtic qatirical drama,\ treats of Christopher Mahon, a simple pea- sant youth and would-be murderer whose very goodness .threa1ened to stifle him with obscuritv. a loy <Irish for spadel. In his own words a \quiet simple, poor fellow with no one heeding (me) saving only the dumb beasts of the field,\ Christy's assault upon his father earns him the respect and the all- out esteem of the prettiest women and worthiest men with whom he drinks. Called by \sweet\ Pegeen, \a fine, handsome young fellow with a noble brow,\ Christy himself rejoices, \Well it's great luck and company I've won me in the end of time-two fine women <one a widow at thatl fighting over the likes of me-till I'm thinking this night, wasn't I a foolish fellow not to kill my father in the years gone by.\ \DA\ Doubtful At first a reUring and obedient farm boy, Christy thus becomes a consummate drinker and popular lover after his rebellion against his \da\ .who later proves to be all too alive when he says of his renegade son, \Hunning wild, is it? Everything builds up· inexorably If he seen a red petticoat coming to the short-lived if dramatic social ·swinging over the hill, he'd be off to hide in the ~qcl,s, and you'd see him shooting out his sheep's, eyes between the little twigs and the leaves, and his two ears rising like a hare looking out through a gap. Girls, indeed!\ The disarming frankness with which Christy and later his father expose their own misadventures and the mismanagement of their hectic lives as. revealed through a negligible plot, lends itself to a vastly entertaining al'!'y of color- ful personalities which is en- hanced by their sparkling gift for rhetoric and, oddly enough, the talent of misusing their own lan- guage and even its dialect. The linguistic subtleties of the play and its merely suggestive technique make it difficult of appreciation upon first reading, -- but even a \once-over\ is sufficient to estab- Ji!'!h its position as a first-rate Irish comedy carefully drawn to the peasant life. We thus have Christy and his squatter father for whom life seems just one damn thing after a·nother. Neither says or does any- thing particularly astute or notable (Continued on Page 4)

He dis- carded the mangled copy of \Life\ and blew a smoke ring. Afte1· all, a date wasn't im- portant; he was here to get an education. Yes, all education. He was training his mind, acquiring a fund of knowledge that would prove invaluable in later years. He was in college, and a coUege was a place to learn, to broaden one's acquaintance with the finer aspects of civilization. Indeed, he should be glad he had no date. His education would benefit thel'eby. With that he tumed complacently to \Colliers\, which, he under- stood, was excellent this week. Meanwhile, not far off, a small group listened to a discussion of a book. Yes, a book, one that might be good, or bad, but, for all that, a book. The group included but a few of the young man's colleagues, and these few were of the type upon whom one looks with that unuttered maledictum, \Oh him!\ Perhaps the young man heard the broad- cast of the discussion from the unattended radio. But he gave it but a short, hyper- critical consideration. A cynical, \Books!\ seemed to cover the situation nicely. For after all, hadn't he attended almost all his classes that week? The week-end passed, and a pleasant Sun- day aftemoon brought with it the somnol- ence bon. of a good dinner and a late eve- ning. A distingui:shed liberal bm·ed the worth of his beliefs and actions to the knife-thrusts of searchiBg questions. But the young man snoozed over the Sunday papers, and lis'tened carefully to Jack BenHy. Yes indeed, that was a very worthwhile discussion on the campus that afternoon, and he was proud of his pursuit of knowledg·e and understanding. But he'd resolved to go to his eight o'clock the next morning, and any\vay, they didn't take attendance at the discussion. Later a distinguished guest of the college gave an organ recital. The program had look- ed interesting, but, well, if he didn't see that show at Proctor's he might miss it entirely and have to wait for its second run. And so the young man faced the approach- ing· week with a rather more righteous feel- ing than was his wont. For he had had no date that week-end and had even studied for an hour one night. Yes, he had studied, he- cause after all, was not he here to acquire an education? A Forlorn Hope Readers of this issue will find the \Speak- ing of Books\ Town Meeting-, Sunday Chapel and Organ Recital stories given more prom- inence than is the custom of this newspaper. Perhaps someone will even find a ray of in- terest therein. But it is a forlorn hope. For we are get- ting an education-and, come hell or hig-h water, we'll do it our own way, and-Say, has anyone seen \The New Yorker?\ -G.T. BON VOYAGE Early this morning one of the college's most effective envoys of good will left the campus on its annual trip to New York. The Glee Club, wherever it goes, always SPr>.ms to leave behind it a most favorable impression of Union, an impression which often helps not only to increase the prestige of the col- lege among the general public, but among high and preparatory school students who are prospective students here. In addition, the Glee Club furnishes the campus with one of its most worthwhile ac- tivities, one which has always been among the leaders in popularity among the student body, a fact which, in our opinion, is reason enough for the maintenance of such an activ- ity. And so, this week-end, the Glee Club reaps its harvest of the year, a harvest gained from planting the seeds of hard work throughout the months since September. J.\.Iay the harvest be a rich one. To Dr. Tid- marsh, the student leaders and manager and to all the members making the trip, we wish the best of enjoyment and ente1·tainment for this, the high spot of your year, a fitting reward fo!' an organization under the direc- tion of a real artist, of which Union may justly be proud. CAPTAIN BEN. LEE AND GORDIE Tomorrow night, Alumni Gymnasium will be the scene of the final basketball game of the current season. So what? Well, we're the first to admit that this hasn't been a basketball campaign to set down in the an- nals of Union's athletic history with cheers and accolades. As a matter of fact, we, our- selves, have been more than a little disap- pointed by the turn of events as the season wore on. Two wins in nine games is any- thing but an enviable record. So, on the basis of past games. there isn't really much incentive to attend tomorrow night's battle. But wait a minute. The team which comes to Alumni Gymnasium tomorrow is not just another college team to Union men. Hereto- fore, when a bunch of engineers from Troy have beaten a Union team in the first meet- ing of the two teams, the Dutchmen have come roaring back in the second encounter to make things mighty hot for the formerly victorious visitors. But we don't have to say much about the rivalry which exists between the two schools. It's been in existence lonO' \\ enough so that everybody should have heard about it by now. So come around tomorrow night. Forget that lovely young thing at Skidmore, or Sage, or wherever she is, just for one week- end and watch a real ball game. Because from all we've been able to gather, Benny, Lee and Gordie, who will be out there for the last time, and Ralph and all the rest of the boys have a couple of special features on tap for tomorrow night's show that may very well send the \slip-stick boys\ walking back to Troy mumbling to themselves. We'll see you there. And if you can't for- get the girl-friend, bring her along, too. ·held Sundc;.y afternoon in Old The speaker for the ·InteHectual bor leaders wh0se names appear Chapel, fr:om 3:30 to 4.

How The Other Half Lives Trinity Hartford. Conn., Feb. 21.-Trinity College is offering its students a service-type medical examination to acquaint them with physical defects that could be remedied before they are called into the armed services, it was announced today by Ray Oosting, director of physical educa- tion. Following the recommendations of Army and Navy representatives, Trinity has revised its athletic pro- gram to improve the general physi- cal condition of its students. The special medical examination, a gov- ernment suggestion, will be given late this month by a group of doc- tors acquainted with service re- quirements. An individual remedial program then will be drawn up for rach man. Because of revision of the college calendat', which eliminates the en- tire month of May for intercolleg- iate athletics, Trinity will drop I track and will substitute a physical- fitness group open to all students and meeting every afternoon after the close of the basketball and swimming seasons. Baseball will be continued.

SPORTS Courtm·en Clo:se Season Here Tomo:rrow Against R.PI Quintet Showing a renewed spirit and<!>----------------- confidence, the varsity basketba:H team has been practicing con.- scientiously this week iH prepara- tion for its final game· of the sea- son. against R.P.I. here tomorrow l!vening. The cagers practiced earlier this week at the big Mont Pleasant High Schoo'! gymnasium while graduate record examinations were being given in the gym, but they have had .pleHty of time to prac- tice on the home court. Several scrimmages· were held, with the freshmen providing the opp0sition . Working under the careful eye of Coach Ralph Semerad, the cagers have put more pep in their work- outs and seem to pe awaiting the fray with eagerness. The squad will probwbly give a better account of itself in this re- turn game with R.P.I., for they will not have to contend with the fan-shaped backboa•rds which prov- ed to be a great handicap to them. The team's shooting in general is much improved, and this may be an indication of how the Dutch- men's shots· will go tomorrow eve- ning. Troj!Uls Seek Fouxth Win The Engineers will be after their fourth win in a row against Union tomorrow after meeting defeat at the hands of the Garnet for a pe- riod of six years. \Whitey\ Carn- wright an.d Ronnie Macomber have yet to play on a Union basketball team that has defeated R.P.I. while Captain Ben Jakabowski played against them in his sophomore year when Union won on our court. This will be the last game for J akabowski, whose stellar floor game has made him a backbone of the defense, and for Lee Sherman, who didn't come into his. own un- til this year. Last year he didn't play at all. If the Garnet enterJains hopes of defeating the confident Trojans, they will have to put on a better exhibition both as far as an ag- t:;ressive attack and a tight defense are concerned. Time and again in the first game the Engineers were able to penetrate the Dutchmen's zone defense. Poor guarding, espe- cially by Sherman, who has play- ed better in previous games, per- mitted the Trojans to make a large number of lay-up shots. When the Dutchmen got the ball they were slow in moving it around and a good number of their shots went astray bt>cause they weren't set for their shots. This time, however, they will not have to contend with fan-shaped backboards. The Engineers will come here with another win under their belt, having defeated Norwich 58-45. Coach Ed Donald will probably sta;rt Marmentini and either Lem- Play Last Game LEE SHERMAN lte ot' Hawks, who was their big gun the last time, at the forward posts.

Seymour Meisel is slated to see plenty of action, and Ed Allen, Gordie Semerad, Ted Vinick, \Shorty\ Peer, Frank Jones and Abe Molyneaux will also be ready to step into the encounter. :················································ 5 CREAM-CREST 5 • • • • • • • • • • • • FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 27, 1942 lJqe (!tnUtltfltitUBtli Phi Sigma Delta Upsets Phi Gamms; 1 Examinations For Boxing, Wrestling ~~~!a ~~;~se~~~~o~!

The movie is distin- guished for some dramatically ef- fective scenes, and some .fine at- mospheric shots. However, it lacks the ironical punch of the book, and in true Hollywood style, it loses some of its effectiveness in pre- senting its picture of Bean Town bluebloods. Robert Young gives an intelligent performance in the title role, and Ruth Hussey adds a great deal of charm to a somewhat flat part.
