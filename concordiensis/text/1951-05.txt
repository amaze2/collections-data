4 Korea Beckon·sAirmen; Swallow Blasts Vaughan In a late communique direct to Air ROTZY headquarters at Union College, General Jacob Arsenic Van Fooey, head of. the Field Army of the United Nations Primarily Concerned with Police Action in Korea (FAUNPCPinK), ordered the Union airmen to snatch a last big bite of West College food and embark immediately for points west. He termed the present situation \critical\ and added that \only after the utmost consideration by none of the chiefs of staff were Union men called.\ \We need policen1en and besides, we can't do any worse than we're doing now.\ But Union junior birdmen need<i•>--------------- Set Match Scotty Style n.ot worry. In a private interview this reporter learned today that Head Senior Birdman. Col.

'Why, it onlY' went thrmJgh a Major General, and it was Vaughen, at that.\ Thi'ough the maze of confusion at the head- quarters, though, one salient fact was learned. Due to the draft de- ferments that all ROTZY students hold, the law of these United .States would be broken if the birdmen would leave. La.st reports on that bill dl!og up by Col. Swallow show that Chester Arthur was the guid- ing force for the pa.ss!llge of the deferment action. It was also learned today that our birdmen's fight to remain in College will hinge on the legality of this act. Letters a knowledge of the game is not necessary for participation.

If this order does go through, A. Kartell Davisen, President of Union College, will submit to the country an open letter to Secretary Atcherson of the state Department in which he states, quite accurate- ly, \Union College wHl never die; you are just making us fade away ... \ He and Bill Campbell have spent some tim~ in the college carpentry shop building the necessary bats and wickets. Unusual as it may seem, cricket soores may range u:p. to the ~m­ ingly fabulous sum of 2,000 runs Pllr game. And even more strange . is tha.t a regular game has but two innings. Acoording to Bunce, the Australian cricket teams have soored in the neighborhood of 600 runs per inning when they play against the English teams. The major difference between the game of cricket and that of baseball lies in the fact that a run is scored • when a player reaches the opposite wicket. Two men are \up'' at the same time, and con- tinue to play until one is \out.\ The next man on. the team then re- places the casualty, and the game continues on its merry way. Each man gets his turn at the wickets and may score as long as his at, his wind, and the \bowler's\ arm lasts. But one major difference, the batsman does not have to run between the wickets just because he hits the ball. He can wait for a more appropriate time. · Bunce claims that the major part of the meet will have to be left out due to short amount ·of time al- lowed for this sport. Unfortunate- ly, he regrets to annolJ,nce that tea and crumpets will not be served.

Double 4oTo 5e!o 7¥ Double Pass Pass East 3. '7.,. Pass The above hand was played at the First Annual Open Bridge Tournament at Utica State Hos- pital recently. Time consumed was $ days, 21 hours, 26 minutes, just 6 seconds shy of the world record. South, of course, opened with a psych bid of 1 spade. West, also using psychology, figured that since he was void, his partner must have lots of spades, so he doubled. North followed through with anoth€)r psych bid of two dia- monds, figuring his partner strong in diamonds becmuse he anticipated the psych bid. East then figured his partner was strong in spades and realizing · spades. J3Y this time, South just didn't want to be left out of things and bid four clubs just for the helluvit. Following South's example and wHling to humor him, every- one bid another round of clubs . Always the pace-setter, South then switched to seven l:;tea:rts. West, continuing his feud with South, doubled. North came to the rescue with his seven spades bid. He figured he had ample .support for South's opening spade bid. Since . everyone was co'@:lpletely buffaloed . by this, they all .passed out . It appears that South slightly overbid his hand, but brilliant maneuvering managed to make the 1 bid. West' opened the 2 of dia- monds and South won in hand with his 7. He finessed his 5 of hearts through on the next play. He played a low dub in hand, West put out his Ace and East, not waiting for Nqrth to play, plunked down his King. North trumped with the Z of spades. It was on this play that West yanked out his .45 and mortally wounded his .partner. After this play, South had little trouble. He cashed his :A.ce and King of hearts on board, played his good clubs on board, then some- how or other got back into his hand, and played his last good club, discarding a diamond, thus making the hand. After the conclusion of the hand, West protested on his own and late lamented partner's behalf. Before he had a chance- to file a formal protest, however, he was returned to his cell.

Lester Zilch's New Book Faces Banning in Boston 13 Lester Zilch, one of Union College'.s most famous gradu- ates, and author of such best sellers as \Channel Number Five\ and \Great Navel Engagements'', has come up with a new hit in his recently published book, \Popular Indoor Sports\. Zilch, who graduated from Uilion ~--------------­ in 1921, has aged gracefully, and ter concludes by saying that still practices the parlor games \Make-out\ is rapidly becoming that his recent publication sets the America's most popular hetero- sexual sport, but one must remem- rules for.

Zilch's comments on \Petting\ are in keeping with a fratel'!lity man's tradition - quite suggestive. However, we all know what ~'Petting'' is, and the censor knows too, but if you don't know we aren't going to tell you, beca~ the censor won't let us.

Prexy Fetes New Council A dinner honoring outgoing Senior members and incoming members of the Student Council was held last Tuesday night at President Carter Davidson's resi- dence. An informal discussion with President Davidson followed the dinner. The President outlined the college organization to the new members. In the unofficial discus- sion period that followed, num- erous points were brought up, in- cluding the forcing of freshmen to eat at Wash College, the feasibility of mixing freshmen with upper classmen in dorms, and the col- lege's task of cooperation with the fraternities. Student apathy in ac- tivities at Union was also discussed · by the group and will be looked into b:~U the new council. No · action was taken, since it was an unofficial meeting. SEN.

Dr. Dav i dson said that the in- crease in curri.culum might mean that the A.F.R.O.T.C. staff would }:Je enlarged. Four officers are on the faculty now. Hours Extended The Union College Library will open every night except Sunday lmtil 11 p.m. begillining next weelt, it was announced yesterday by the library staff. Sunday hours will be from 2 p.m. until 10 p.m. Althot1gh these extend,ed hours will be in effect only for · the remainder of the term, the n .. brary sta.ff may permanently extend tb;e~ hours in the fall. C' Senator Kefauver served as a member of the U. S. Armed Serv- ices · Investigating Subcommittee which, in October, 1949, investi- gated the Malmedy war crimes case. In February, 1950, the sub- committee , with Kefauver as chair- man, voted in favor · of a $100,000 investigation of gambling which, according to an Attorney's · Gen- eral conference in Washington, was netting $15 billion a year. In May, 1950, Kefauver was ap- _ pointed by Vice-President Barkley as head of a five-man Senate Crime Investigating Committee to investi-- gate organized crime and its in- fluence on politics. The committee began its nationwide crime inquiry with secret hearings in Miami. The hearings spread across the country and received a great deal of pub- licity in March, 1951, when the <Continued on Page 4) --0--- Philos Finish Active· Year The Philomathean Society, the oldest debate society in New York State and one of the oldest in the United States. concluded its 172nd season last week, after participat- ing in 59 events, ex.c}usive of the Albany Convention of College Stu- dents which it directed this year. fully.

Probably the best thing that comes out of associating with representatives from other colleges i.s the ne~ ~e~se of pride in one's own which results. Nothmg can mmnmze one's own troubles as successfully as hearing about other people's. . . But there were other factors wh1ch led to our feehng of appreciation that we went to Union. Whoever we talked to at the conference respected the name of Union. When nwspapers were compared, ours stood up with the best. When college freedom and policies were discussed, ours ranked as the most liberal. When student freedom and campus oppor- tunities were contrasted, ours proved to be superior. It was surprising to us to learn how many colleges are faced with an administrative censorship problem, something which has never, in our recollection, been a factor at Union. Many schools comparable to Union reported that their papers are under the strict surveilance of a faculty advisor, who has absolute veto power. V\'e feel that censorship should not be a problem in col- lege newspapers. As a voice of the students, a campus organ should have free reign to print what it wishes, without the restraint of college officials. If a college dues nut trust a newspaper enough to allow it to publish uncensorec'l, then the paper loses its function. But in certain respects we found Union lacking. Most schools admitted a certain amount of apathy in activities, but some claimed that they had fe\\' problems along that line. In the past year or two, Union's student activity program has suffered from horrible lack ·of support. Each succeeding month seems to bring an increa~e in apathy, anrl the end is not in sight. As we have said so many times before, there is no reason on this campus for lack of student interest. We found at the New England conference that we have much to be thank- ful for. It is up to the students to recognize their opportuni\ ties. We hope they app1·eciate Union as they should. For Your Information FRIDAY.

Eddie made what was to me a rational criticism of the growing militarism in this country, in general, and its par- ticular manifestation in our col- leges, that organization of legiti- mate draft dodgers and tin soldiers, the R.O.T.C. His argu- ments are supported by a large segment of public opinion which does not want our country to turn down the road that leads toward the dictatorship of the military. Mr. Kennedy's first charge was that Eddie's wrath was misdi- rected·. Does it matter whose idea the parade was? The important thing is that it was offered to our parents as one of the higher type of activities that takes place within these wall:S. Kenney's second accusation stated that Ed's thinking was juvenile. This, I do not under- stand. Is it juvenile to want to do something better than play at bdng a soldier? Is it juvenile to want to prevent militarism from engulfing our country? Is it juvenile to prefer peace to war? Is it juvenile to want to remain alive? Mr. Kenney says he is not ashamed of the parent's weekend military dt>trtonstratlon, I am ashamed that a college of the in- tellectual caliber of Union should see fit to present a poorly done parade by a bunch of boy' scouts as an example of what it is doing for the nation in these trying times. Mr. Arnold's letter was even more unfortuna;te than Mr. Ken- ney's. It smacks of the kind of patrioteering Senator McCarthy is wont to engage in. This is the kind of frenzied clamor of small minds that will slowly eliminate free thought and liberal opinion everywhere. consistency in editorial policy, a prerequisite of good .editorship, be- cause on the one hand it seems to advocate a riotous type of college life as is shown by the statement concerning a lack of student inter- est in the Student Council Elec- tions, \We miss those .good old days of riotous chapels, dancing girls, and wild campaigning\; while on the other hand, it very loftUy, and with seeming serious- ness, criticizes issues such as Com- pulsory Chapel, absence of faculty names on course lists, the year- course system and the operation of the library. If the editors want their criti- cism to be considered seriously, and the Concordiensis to effective- ly represent student opinion, they must concentrate and devote them- selves entirely to a policy of good professional newspaper ethics, and by example, inspire purely objec- tive reasoning in their readers. Yours truly, WILLIAM T. PAPPAS Arnold Letter Cited As Misinterpretation The Editor The Concordiensis Dear Sir, It is to be deplored that a college newspaper which boasts a \first class rating\ in the 44th Associated Collegiate Press All-American Crit- ical Service has seen fit to award 1st prize to a letter so typically childish and uncollegiate. We re- fer, of course, to Mr. Arnold's let- ter which appeared in last week's Concordiensis. We find, in rereading Mr. Sing- er's letter, that MF. Arnold's reply is a poorly thought-out, hot-headed, be'lligerent misinterpretation and twisting of the statements in the former. Evidently, according to Mr. Ar- nold, all of us who abhor war as a means to any end, and, somehow, Mr. Arnold attempts to include himself in this group, have no right to be in this country. Many of the pacifists on this campus (or shall I call them \parasitic scum\?) have arrived at their point of view after long periods of serious thought and meditation. If Mr. Arnold were to review his freshman history he would be hard pressed to find any Instance in the history of the world where war provideq any lasting solution to international .problems. The \outrage\ lies then in the fact that on the college campus, where men pr-epare to lead the .fuller lives If your purpose was to award a prize to the letter which \best re- veals an item of campus interest,\ the c1garettes should !}ave gone to Singer who brought up the issue in the first place. Yours truly, DON M. OREGIER · Singer Reiterates Anti-Military Stand To the Readers: The many have. always been ex- ploited ·bY the few. They can do this b.ecause they are smarter, slyer, quicker to. grasp the situ- ation arid take advantage of it. One fact which would-be dictators are cognizant of is that armies must be recruited if they are to gain power and retain it. Nothing is quite so effective as massed force for humbling peot>le, making them wish that they were dead, rr.aking secure governments born of infamy. Gestapo,·G.P.U., Black Shirts: He who controls the military can con- trol the world. An army is an inexorable jugger- nault, the sight of which alone is enough to reduce men to jelly, to shaking, hysterical hulks. The army is the most terrifying sight in the world.

EDWIN PAUL SINGER Says Letters Display Emotional Approach Dear Editor: I was quite disturbed at reading the exchange of letters in recent issues of the Concordiensis on the question of the ROTC parade on Parents Weekend. Both Singer's letter, and the letters by Kenney and Arnold betray an emotional, I might say vituperative approach to the problem that is not worthy of a college campus. Their bitterness is .not at all essential to a discussion of the basic issue involved. And what is this issue? Mr. Kenney thinks it is a question of values. Certainly it' is a question of how to loolt at the military. Mr. Arnold points to the glorious patriots of 1776, and World War H, although he gives lip service to the abhorrence of war. He sees the military as performing an es:sential service, for he expects that they will \eventually help to lead the world out of its pit of confusion a:nd into a new world.\ Mr. Ken- (Continued on Page 4) Ferro's Restaurant Mr. end Mrs. GEORGE FERRO Proprietol'$ 1115 Barrett St. • Specializing in IT AllAN-AMERICAN FOOD Phone 6-9554 ~ .

2 Editorial Policy Reviewed As the academic year comes to a close, it seems to be an appropriate time to review the editorial policy of the Concordiensis and to point out just what we tried to accom- plish and what still remains to be done. We printed a letter in our last issue which called our editorial policy \inconsistent\. We strong disag-t'ee with the author and we hope, LJ· this resume, to clarify our stand so that he and all other Union men may know what we are striving for and what they can do to help. Our policy during the past year can be summed up rather simply. Our goal is the full development of the Union student and we campaig-ned for what we feel are the means to that end: the improvement of college policy to better the student's educational opportunity and the awakening of the student to take advantage of the great assets present at Union College.

Whatever .prompted· the se- lectors to come to this decision is certainly ]?e- yond me. The only .possible ·ex- cuse they could offer is the fact that there are so many outstand- ing plays to choose Broadway's top post war season.

And it's a weird public taste that fills the huge Winter Garden to witness a gaudy \.Make a Wish\ while \The Green Pastures\ takes a slow curtain because the pastures weren't so green. -. The past few months have been characterized by an utter lack of student interest in the college. Activities have dwindled, elections have suffered from a lack of voters and general campus atmosphere has Leen one of apathy. But a college of the calibre of Union cannot flourish with a dis- interested student body, for it is a small college which can only be as alive as its students. If the students do not fulfill their responsibility to their college, they can cer- tainly not expect their colleg-e to fulfill its end of the bargain. ---------------~~-----~~---~-~ \Darkness at Noon\ (Concordiensis; Feb. 23, '51).

Or perhaps we may ·read of the Marines ever protecting the American, regard- less of race, creed or color, no mat- ter where he may be, or of the Army supplying water for thirsty throats of Anytown, U.S.A., and working round the clock strength- ening levees or guarding prope1'ty of unfortunates. These are our Ar:rned Forces, a team available in any emergency, with wars only a small part of their daily duties. Our Armed Forces, too, have been self sustaining, not dependent upon the vanquished for their existence. I suggest that these lads, who have proved to be unaware of our mission in both peace and war visit our library or classroom. There they will discover that we do not teach the ways of conducting a war, but self preservation in the event of war, and the history of past wars which we have fought to preserve our freedom. They will discover that we of the Armed Forces live and act like human beings and think in the same man- ner, always seeking a means of making our land a better place to live.

BOB MILLER, USAF Questions Sincerity In Milita1·ism Issue Dear Mr. Singer: It is unfortunate that so many people have misinterpreted the original question that you bl'ought up. In YQUr first letter, you merely complained that it was disgusting to have the ROTC have a parade on campus. I limited myself to discussing that question , i.e., I claimed that as long as the ROTC was on campus, it was proper to recognize that fact. Since then, the discussion has turned to the more pertinent one-, is it proper to have a military body on campus, and is it proper to have any military bodies at all? Again I shall not argue the point. All I shall do is recommend to you that you read almost any ·pub- lication put out in this country for the last few years, and you will see both side!; of the question argued rather thoroughly. Rather than .spend the ~)pace 6f this paper, I shall refer you to those others. If a man is wrong, but sincere, that sincerity will help to cover a lot of his mistakes, but insincerity is something else. May I ask, Mr. Singer, a question whose answer seems to escape me? Why, if you are so opposed to the military, and the AFROTC particularly, are you a member of that organization? Why do· you lend the support of your participation to an army which is \the most terrifying sight in the world.\? Why are you a colunteer of that 'inexorable jug- gernaught, the sight of which alone is enough to reduce men to jelly, to shaking, hysterica.l hulks.'? yours truly, JAMES F.

Though probably the comedy is not what Anderson meant to emphasize, the result of making De Witt the commanding character of the play is, for this reviewer, all to the good. The seri- ous meaning of the play has been expressed elsewhere by others more profound and more trenchant th:an Anderson.

It is through meeting people of other lands and getting to know them that misunderstandings are banished and I must confess that I have much better opinion of the Americans nmv that I have really met them. Lest I become too lengthy, in this which is a very puny appreciation for everything that has been done for me I must end this letter now, on the same strain as I began it.
