According to editor-in-chief David Levine, \the editors of the Concordiensis attended the con- vention to learn about the tech- niques being implem~nted to pro .. vide better coverage of the col- lege campus.\ The Concordiensis submitted one paper from the fall term which was believed to be the best product of the term, and com- peted with other non-daily four- year tabloids, on a national level. This is The Concordiensis' first award at this competition. l11e last major award won by the newspaper was the Columbia Award, won in 1988. The Concordiensis won the Interna- tional Press Award in 1961 as the best college newspaper in the United States. Also at the Dallas convention, photography editor Josh Haines won an award. Haines; along with nineteen other photographers, were invited to shoot pictures for the Dallas Morning News, and the best photographs taken were to be printed in upcoming issues of the News. Each student photographer was given two rolls of color film and asked to ream the city all day, taking pictures in Dallas from a visitor's perspective. Haines, one ofwhos~ photographs was picked as the sixth best pictur~ out of the 960 pictures taken, may have his pictures in published in the Dal- las paper. Levine atttributedthe success of the paper at the national competi- tion to the \outstandinglayout and photographs on the front and back pages of the newspaper.\ The edi- tor added, \There are so many pa- pers entered in the competition that appearance is critical.\ The award should lead to fur- ther recognition for the 116 year- old newspaper leading into the college's bicentennial. Levine attributed the turn areund of the newspaper to the hard working student staff mem- bers. \The staff has worked hard at re-vitalizing the paper, and I think our work has paid off. The fact that we have now gone to desktop publishing, and have been able to reap the benefits of the new technology so quickly is a tribute to everyone who works at the paper.\ Matt Karlyn, Se- nior News Editor of The Concordiensis, agreed and stated, \Although we got off to a rough start this term, we have all put a lot of time and effort into mak- ing the paper what it has become. On behalf of the entire editorial board I would lik~. to congratu- late our editor-in-chief, David Levine, for a job well done.\ Charlie Tidmarch Remembered by Alex Kreisler Associate News Editor The man known as \Charley T.\ was remembered Monday, November I, for his generosity, intellect, humor and guitar play- ing. the Union faculty as instructor of political science in 1970, and was promoted to assistant, associate and full professor. He served as chair of the department of politi- cal science from 1987 to 1992, and as visiting professor of poli- tics at Princeton University in 1986 and 1987. Tidmarch was involved in a number of aspects of College administration, goverance and service. He was a member of the college's board of Trustees, the College's Academic Affairs Council, the presidential search committee, the project planning committees for the restoration of the Nott Memorial and the expansion of Schaffer Library, continued on page 3 November 11, 1993 The Union College Football Team finished an unbeaten season last Saturday with a 24-6 win over Rochester.

Tidmarch, 50, pro- fessor of political science; died Friday, October 29, after a two- year battle with cancer. He had been on campus a week before he died to advise his thesis students and to meet with colleagues. The funeral service in Memorial Chapel was planned by his wife, Laura; and two daughters, Alexandra, 17, and Victoria, 11. Speakers included Mrs. Tidmarch; President Roger Hull; Professor Stephen Berk; Scharn Robinson '90; and Professor Jo- seph Board. Musical selections included a recording of \Blue Suede Shoes\ performed by Tidmarch's band, Charley T. and the Undergrads, in October 1988. He held a bachelor's degree from Moravian College, and master's and Ph.D. degrees from John Hopkins University. He re- vealed in a past Concordiensis article that he initially planned to pursue a law degree, but his se- nior year in college marked a time of revelation for him. \One day it occUlTed to me that a lawyer was not what I wanted to be. What I wanted was to work in a world of ideas where I could have more freedom to use my time as I saw fit. I really loved politics and po- litical science. I can't imagine a job at its best could be mcire fun this,\ Tidmarch had explained in his \Professor of the Week\ in- terview.

Thomas C. Paul, vice president of engineering for the General Electric Power Generation in Schenectady, gave Union College's President Roger Hull an enlarged check at a press confer- ence to symbolize the grant. \The time has come to reexam- ine what we are doing in engi- neering,\ said Vice President Paul. \Union College was one of the two schools chosen, to look within and outside themselves to develop a new curriculum.\ \We have had long industrious history with General Electric and engineering,\ said President Hull. \With the 1 00 years of electrical engineering at Union College ap- proaching, it is an exciting time to receive such a large grant.\ The initiative behind the grant is for Union College to integrate engineering with other subjects like economics, international stud- ies and science. The new curricu- lum is likely to contain several projects that will bring together students and faculty to solve com- plex engineering problems, to dis- cuss professional ethics, eco- nomic viability, environmental protection and public safety. Richard Kenyon, Dean of En- gineering at Union College, hopes that a central feature of the new engineering curriculum will be an international studies program in an attempt to reflect the prac- tice of engineering in a global economy. \We at Union College are tak- ing an eraser and cleaning the board,\ said Dean Kenyon. \We are creating a whole new para- digm.\ Dean Kenyon an- nounced that in creating the new curriculum, Union will redefine engineering in the 20th century, examine their outcomes and de- velop, from scratch, the best pos- sible curriculum for the new pro- gram.

The size ofapanel is by Eileen Barrett six feet long by three feet wide, Contributing Writer the same dimensions of a coffin., The NAMES Project AIDS Memorial Quilt is a project aimed · at increasing awareness of the global AIDS epidemic. It is a growing collection of handmade fabric panels sewn together where each panel is created in memory of someone who has died of AIDS. Based in San Francisco, the NAMES Project began in the late 1980's among community mem- bers frustrated with the government's indifference to the increasing AIDS related morality rate. To call attention to the epi- demic, community members painted the names of their de- ceased loved ones on the side of a building , This action ultimately lead to a few fabric squares with names on them sewn together to form a quilt. The creation of a qUilt was chosen because it was a better representation of someone's life than paint on a stone building. The news of this project spread, and the NAMES Project became more and more popular as a means to call atten- tion to the epidemic. The quilt now covers fourteen football fields. In addition to fostering public and government awareness, par- ticipating in making a quilt is also a powerful expression of grief. Many of the panels were started by persons with AIDS, and then This is the only rule set by the NAMES Project when accepting panels. However, despite the sad- ness involved in making the quilt each panel is also a celebration of life. The panels ane adorned with pictures, dolls, poems, paint, glit- ter, and clothing and other articles appropriate to the deceased indi- vidual. . ·Quilt panels are displayed all over the world to show the lm- manity behind the statistics. Each quilt display raises the level of awareness, supports those mourn- ing the deceased, and helps sup- port the raising of funds to help end the epidemic and come to the time when there is no need to sew on a new paneL If you are interested in helping bring the quilt to Union, Please contact Karen Williams in the Biology department at x 6062. EDUCATION FOR THE REAL WORLD Graduate degree programs (MA, Ph.D) in International Affairs with an emphasis on contemporary policy- relevant issues. Africana Studies Comes to Union: Action Committee of ALAS Finally Succeeds in Battle Area and Functional Fields: 0 Interamerican Studies (including U.S.-Latin American Relations) 0 European Studies Courtesy of tile Actio11 Committee of ALAS As many of you might know, for a number of years, the Action Committee of the African and Latino Alliance of Students had been involved in a struggle to bring an Africana Studies pro- gram to Union College. Meetings were held with President Hull (and President Morris before him), Vice-President Mammola, Dean Underwood, and the Board of Trustees, all in an effort to bring about an awareness of the importance of such a discipline to a liberal arts institution. The ad- ministration came to recognize the need for a more diversified classroom experience in prepara- tion for an increasingly diverse society. With the backing of the administration, the proposal was sent to the Academic Affairs Council, which routinely reviews applications for any new aca- demic programs. After it received approval from the council, the pr:oposal was left in the hands of the faculty. The faculty unani~ mously voted on the implemen- tation ofthe program, and agreed that the program would be named Africana Studies, despite sugges- tions that it be named the African and African-American Studies Program. This was a major vic- tory because the title \Africana'-' allows for a much broader study of all cultures included within the African diaspora. The program allows for either a minor or interdepartmental ma- jor in Africana Studies in which students take a variety of courses from, presently, History, Sociol- ogy, and English. Seniors who have already taken a number of courses in this area are still eli- gible to graduate with a minor, if the required amount ·Of courses are completed by the end of the year (six courses are needed to declare a minor). The program will enable students to broaden their knowledge of different cul- tures and societies, which will in turn enable them to appreciate and enhance this multi-ethnic na- tion. Additionally, the introduc• tion of this program, and those like it, will help justify the title \liberal arts,\ which has been as- signed to this college. Although this is a step forward, it is, after all; but a step, in a jour- ney of innumerable steps. One major concern of many students on this campus is the inclusion of a non-western history sequence in section I of the General Educa- tion Curriculum. As of now, all the history sequences are strictly Eurocentric, and non-represetita- tive of the contributions of the many non-western cultures, which existed before western civilization began. Having the non-western track wiii recognize the truth in history, and the rich cultural benefits that the world has inherited as a result of these discoveries. Currently, the proposal put forth is one that would replace the Option II in Section IV (four courses outside the department of your major, which are not all within the same department) with an option to take four courses that are constituted as non-western. TI1is is profoundly unacceptable. TI1is proposal is in .effect stating that non-western culture is sub- servient to western culture. Such a plan diminishes the significance of these important contributions, and implies that the administra- tion does not deem this area wor- thy of serious study. With the implementation ofthe Africana Studies Program, it is evident that Union College is in the process of making itself a more diverse community. Thi.s is a very significant step in the di- rection of a broad-based educa- tion. However, much more has to be done, not the least of which is the inclusion of a non-western histol)' track in Section I of the General Education Cuniculum. It is time that we all intellectually challenge our norms. In so do- ing, progress will be made, and only expansion can bring about progress. 0 Post-Sov.iet Studies 0 Comparative Development 0 International Business 0 International Economics 0 International Health Policy 0 International Relations Theory 0 International Security and Conflict 0 Foreign Policy Analysis Apply by February 1 for assistantships and other financial aid. -~ N<ttth·?Rvt~ P:N~\ Students who are interested in Interamerican issues are particularly encouraged to apply for North-South Center Graduate Assistantships.

Holds Town Meeting by David Levine Editor-in-CIIiej The Student Forum held a well-attended Town Meeting on Moi1day. The Meeting featured reports from the Academic Affairs Council, the Finance Committee, the Student Affairs Council, and a Trustees report on the building of new athletic facilities. The meeting also gave any member of the Union College community an opportunity to voice their opinions on the issues discussed by the Forum. Matt Karlyn, the Vice President of Academics, reported that the AAC is considering a. proposal to \have academic warning taken off a students transcript if their grade point average is -a 2.0 or higher and the student has at least a 2.3 in their major.'' Pat Haskell, the Vice President of Finance, announced that the Social Committee had been approved a budget of $6.000 to enhance the social alternatives available to all Union students. Additionally, the Crew Team may not be far away from achieving varsity status. A good chunk of the meeting was devoted to discussion of the membership on the SAC. fare and taxation. Finally, he received the Fac- ulty Meritorious Service Award from the Alumni Council of the College during ReUnion last May. \Charley you have contrib- uted immensely over the years - to your students, to this College, even to the Democratic process . .. \ These were the opening words of Jerry L. Thurston '61, who pre- sented 1)dmarch this honorable award. Thurston's speech truly represents the way so many people felt about Professor Tim arch. ''Many of us know you as a teacher whose warm and gentle manner of inquiry turned a class into an intellectual adven- ture of a lifetime. Mat:iy of us know you as a tireless worker who demands everything for this College and nothing for himself. Many of us know you a~ a con- versationalist whose love of talk- ing politics is QValed only by your passion for playing rock and roll. But all of us know you as a true friend ... Indeed much of what is excellent about Union College is that way because of you.\ Students, as well as faculty, admired and adored him. One · student expressed \to know him is to love him.\ She also stated that \although I don't always know where or how, he always has the stamina tp listen to my ideas and to challhnge them, yet he always treats me as his equal.\ Mrs. Moore, the secretary for the political science department, -/'·'- expressed her thoughts on Profes- sor Tidmarch. \It was six years of a very pleasent relationship with him. He will be missed very much. He was genuinally one of my best employers in all the years . I've worked. We are all stand- ing behind his family.\ Contributions may be made to the Tidmarch Family Scholarship Fund in care of the College. Mrs. Tidmarch has requested that friends send written remem- brances of her husband to be in- cluded in albums she is assem- bling for her daughters. They may be sent to her home or through the political science de- partment. Student Fomm Memebers at Monday's Town Meeting (photo by Josh Haines/TC)

November 11, 1993, page 4 Terms Abroad Changes by Shveta Srivastava Contributing Writer Professor Bill Thomas in the Terms Abroad Office has been discussing possible exchartge stu- dent programs in Ireland and Wales. \They are still under dis- cussion and we'll see what hap- pens,\ stated Prof. Thomas. There ate no new term abroad programs as of this year, but Pro- fessor Thomas hopes to know the fate of any new terms by the end of this year. He will be visiting Ireland and Wales in the coming week to see is if any arrangements can be made for students who want to get involved in this par- ticular program. A program that the college is looking into is a term in India. Although the pro- gram in India is being strongly considered ,the political stability and the earthquake have raised questions about the safety and plausibility of such a term abroad. The most popular terms abroad programs seem to be to Italy, York, and Spain. There isn't a definite program that students seem to dislike.The expense of the program for this year is $8179 which includes tuition, room, board, and group excursions. \All financial aid covers for the term abroad except for the college work-study program.\ There are also other scholarships and loans available for students to pay for the expenses. .. Although everyone can go to a terms abroad, it is more difficult for the engineers and science majors due to the rigidity of course scheduling. Prof. Thomas suggests that planning ahead .gives the student more time and many more options. Science and ·engineering students have should plan early and decide whether or not they would like to go on a term abroad in ot:der to coordinate their major requirements and other courses. To the disappointment of the Terms Abroad Office, the ex- change program in Korea has not been very successful since it has begun. Professor Thomas added that 'the problem lies in finding participants, \We have not been successful in .finding Union stu- dents to go to Korea.\ This year there is one student who came from Korea to study at Union; hopefully, this will lead to more students who are interested in this . .. particular program. By the time a class re~ches graduation, approximately 40% percent of the graduating class will have gone on a term abroad. President Hull is trying to get more students involved and en- courages all students to at least consider going on a term abroad. As Matt Karlyn, a senior who has gone on two terms abroad said, \After all, you only live once, go on a teim abroad!\ NEWS Thanksgiving h . ors 1p Service ' 11:00 AM Sunday,.

What is wrong is wrong, and though we do not know exactly how he is .wrong, or what he did , by Sarah. R. Evans World News Staff Although opponents of the North Americmi Free Trade Agreeinent <;laim that Mexico will hurt the United States, as a result of the agreement but this is not the case. Mexico , even though it is poorer in comparison to the United States and Canada, pres- ently provides a huge market for U.S. goods and services. This market can only become larger with the advent of the free trade agreement. Mexico presently imports more that1 $42 million in goods and ser- vices from the United States. U.S. imports to Mexico have tripled since 1986 when the Mexican govenunent began lowering tar- iffs on U.S. goods so that they could compete with Mexican goods. Mexico offers vast oppor- tunities for trading, particularly because of its relatively young population that desires things made in the United States. Nafta's outlook is presently grim in the U.S. The Clinton ad- ministration which is a strong pro- ponent for free trade is working hard to convince Congress that increased trade with Mexico will make up for the American jobs that will be lost because of lower wages in Mexico. The demand for American products in Mexico is greatdt than any other part ofthe world. Mexicans spent $450 per capita on U.S. goods in 1992, more than the Japanese or Europeans spent per capita. Companies such as J.C. Penney, K-Mart, Wal-Mart, Midas and Hostess are already doing brisk business in Mexico. Although more than 70 per- cent of all Mexican imports come from the United States, not ev- erything Anierican is an instant success. It is feared that once the trade restrictions are eliminated; the novelty of American goods will wear off. Under President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, Mexico has been discarding its old import substitution economy and opening its markets. The markets began to open up for exports in the mid 1980s because of the reduction in tariffs. Nafta would finish the opening of Mexico's economy for the coun- tries to its north. Tariffs artificially raise the prices of goods. When Mexico first lowered her tariffs, imports started appearing on the store shelves. At first the American goods sold like hot cakes, but once the novelty wore down as people realized that they were paying two or three times the amount of a comparable Mexican product. It is uncertain what outcome Nafta will have in the long run over Mexi- cans buying patterns and wages. The United States Congress should approve Nafta. Represen- tatives should not think merely about the special interest groups that support their expensive cam- paigns. They should not vote against Nafta because most labor unions are against it. Congress- people should not vote against Nafta because a small, but vocal group does not want their interest injured. Economies are constantly changing. It is unrealistic to as- sume that the United States can be a manufacturing based economy in this day and age. Over the pass 20 years our economy has shifted from a manufacturing based economy to a service based. The old guard, labor unions, has to change eventually. Nafta makes good business sense for the United States. Our economy will benefit from free trade overall, with only some of the small and less competitive industries dying out; but that is called evolution. Mexico will not hurt the United States economy because of her lower wages as opponents of free trade say. The U.S. will benefit from Mexico's desire from American goods. The American consumer will also benefit because the cost of prod- ucts made in Mexico and Canada will become less expensive. The wages of Mexican laborers, a major sticking point in the final approval of the agreement by Congress, will eventually rise as their standard ofliving rises. The United States Congress should approve the North American Free Trade Agreement when it comes up to vote; if we want to maintain our position as a world economic power. Packwood's diary contains some- thing that he, or someone else did, in a powerful position, that could affect each citizen, directly or in- directly.

November 11, 1993, page 6 Environmental News The Environmental Implications ofNAFTA by Eric Habib Concordiensis Staff NAFTA, the North American Free Trade Agreement, if passed, could take effect as soon as Janu~ ary 1, 1994. There has been much controversy about the environ~ mental implications involved with this agreement. Opponents ofNAFTA belieVe that ifit takes effect, a large number of US. finns will1nove south of the bor~ der in order to take advantage of unenforced environmental laws and use Mexico as a pollution haven. However, proponents of NAFTA contend that any U.S. finn that is looking for lax rules on pollution is already operating in Mexico. Opponents add that a clean environment is likely to fol~ low economic prosperity and if NAFTA is enacted, it could ac~ celerate Mexico's development and thus its capability to pay for a healthier environment. So, the cmx of this dispute is whether promoting industrial growth in Mexico through NAFTA will ex~ acerbate or alleviate an already severe pollution problem. TI1e horrendous pollution prob~ lems along the United States- Mexico border help explain why it is important to ensure compe- tent environmental safeguards and enforcement processes in NAFT A. The'se problems are so severe that the area has been called a 'virt\ull cesspool and breeding ground for infectious diseases.'

A United States Congressional study, last year, found that fewer than one-third of the plants even reported on their wastes as re- quired and that the wastes went virtually unchecked. U.S. exporting companies in Mexico, called maquiladoras, are the major contributors to border pollution. Since 1965, unem- ployed men, women, and chil- dren, who did not illegally cross into the U.S. to work have been \rented\ to more than two thou- U.S.; resulting pollution problems affect both sides of the border. For instance, \in Brownsville, Texas, an inexplicably high incidence of babies who are delivered stillborn without brains has led people to suspect contamination from in- dustries just across the border in Matamoros, where the same phe- nomenon has appeared\ (NYT, 8/ 14). However, all ofMexico will becmne a duty-free zone if NAFT A is passed, thus removing any incentive to concentrate in- dustry on the border. Proponents assert this will result in less pol- Mexican and American officials have promised to channel billions of dollars to clean up both sides of the border. William K. Reilly, fanner EPA .administrator, said: \without NAFTA, and the eco- nomic growth projected to follow from it, there would be fewer fi- nancial resources in Mexico- not to mention in the U;S.- for envi- . ronmental·improvement. There would be no coordinated program to guide these improvements, nor the added impetus for Mexico to continue increasing expenditures on the environment and strength- enjng enforcement. And there would be less it;tcentive in the U.S. Congre.ss during tough fiscal times to make the investment to help dean up a border .area that has suffered too long from pollu- tion and inadequate water and sewage facilities.\ If opponents are right that America's polluting industries will be tempted by Mexico's regulatory indifference .and \in fest every nook and cranny\ of Mexico, the Clinton administra- tion has signed a side agreement that will create a three nation commission, the Commission on Environmental Cooperation, to oversee environmental laws and their enforcement. Any country (or private group like the NRDC or Sierra Club), which believes that one of the three nations (U.S., Canada, or Mexico) is not enforc- ing its environmental laws, cart complain. If the Commission finds a pattern of violations, it can ~­ impose fines of up to $20 million on the offending country and, if that doesn't work, invoke trade sanctions. On paper, the North American Free Trade Agreement, with its environmental arrangements, seems like it will ameliorate pol- lution along the U.S.-Mexico bor- der. Whether NAFTA's mecha- nisms to prevent pollution will be effective in practice is not clear. Since the Mexican;,govemment has, in the past, proven itselfun- tmstworthy and corrupt it is not certain what the future holds if NAFTA takes effect. EXCELSIOR SPRINGS WATER COMPANY ~~\lATOc 4 .

Dinkins ... triggered painful soul searching yesterday among black supporters who saw it as a reveal- ing commentary on the state of race relations in New York.\ Okay, fine. But deep within the bowels of the paper there are some rather interesting statistics. The fact is t~at four times as many white voters voted for David '• ' { t < Dinkins as black voters voted for Rudolph Giuliani. I think that this in itself is a commentary on race relations; in this case it showed how white voters were much more apt to cross the racial bar- riers than their black counterparts. If you think I'm making this up or am portraying a certain view .. point, then look at the raw data on page B6. therefore, the article contradicts what actually hap- pened. Granted there is room for much improvement in racial re- lations, only a fool could deny that, but to turn the election into a racial thing is unequivocally wrong. Change was the impetus for the election results, a trend which was evident throughout the nation. There is nothing more fmstrating than seeing people's thoughts manipulated. Tit is elec- tion was definitely not a \com- mentary on race relations'', but rather a commentary on the twisted natl,lre of journalism to- day.

OPINIONS Novembe:r 11,.1993, .. page 9 Honor Code: A New Look ,Con,vtnience Store .Sholild Sell' Cigarettes To the Editor: Lately, there has been much debate on this campm: on the topic of whether or not the coUege should have ~ honor code. Due to other .conflicts, I have been unable to participate in any ofthe meetings or committees that are dedicated to this topic, until a few weeks ago. On October 27, I at- tended a Crosstalk at Chet's dis- cussing the need and possible implementation of an honor code on this campus. \We need to stop all of the cheating th;tt goes on here,'' was the gist of this discus- sion, and many oftheparticipants would finish that sentence with\ and an honor code is the w~;r: to do it.\ Well, after hearing this, I felt that it was time to share mY opinion, for my background con- sists of experiences with an honor code that most of this campus cannot relate to. I kfiow that many people went to prep schools that had honor codes, but I'm pretty sure that I'm one of the few (if there are any others) that bas gone to a college with an honor code. A few years ago, I decided to transfer to a well-known liberal arts college that lies about half-way between here and New York City. This college had an honor code, but there was absolutely no difference in the amount of cheating there than there is here. For when there is an honor code, the tests do not have proctors, and on my .first test, when the teacher left the room, mass cheating definitely occurred. Now, for those who are in favor of an honor code, you would say that I was in violation of it because I did not report this incident to the proper authorities. But this is the problem with an honor code: it pits student against student, one's word against the other's, andjustcreates an uproar. nw general feeling at this college ·was one of\I'm not going to be a snitch.\ This, in my opinion, is where the honor code doesn't work, we ·can't have students .po- licing students. There is enough social pressure around here as it is, we don't need this kind ofsitu- ation. Ifwe.wantto stop the cheat- ing, I feel there is another way to do it. But first, we must examine why people cheat. The way I see it, there are three types ofpeople when it comes to c}leating. they are: 1) those who . cheated throughout high school and still do in college; 2) those who started cheating jn college because they didn't correctly an- ticipate the amount of work it takes to get good grades in col- lege because their high schools weren't challenging; and 3) ,those who don't cl}:eat at. alL The first group we can do nothing about, an: honor code will only help a true cheater, because there won't b~ a teacher in the room. The third group doesn't need help, it's the middle group where the problem must be attacked. All cheating comes down to is grades. We have pressure from our parents, ourselves, and now, being a se- nior I realize, pressure from our future employers w~o love to see a high GP A. Many of us came to college Freshman year, got killed in our classes our first · term or two, and needed to bring every- thing up. This is where the middle group started to cheat. So, to Union College, I propose a way to help the problem. It won't com- pletely fix it, but I feel that many students. will have more time to prepare to keep their grades up honestly. The solution: make Freshman year pass/fail, with only students and their professors knowing any numerical grade. Thanks for Memorial Support To the Editor: A heartfelt thanks is extended to the College community for its participation and support of the memorial efforts for Mohammad A. Omar. Without a doubt, Mohammad touched many lives during his short stay with us. Be- cause of the lateness in the sea- son, it was necessary to postpone planting of the tree until spring. Cost for the tree and memorial stone is approximately $450. To date, a total of $290.45 has been received. Donations are still be- ing collected. A fundraiser is scheduled for Friday, November 12, 10 P.M. in Upper Class Dining. CASIM, a Caribbean American youth steel band from Brooklyn, will be fea- tured in an evening of music. If you have never been to the Car- ibbean, you must stop in and ex- perience the \iweet music\ of the steel drum. Ifyou have been to the Caribbean, then you know the beat of the drum. Come to the Caribbean by way of Upper Clas.s Dining on Friday, Novem- ber 12. Admission is $3 with col- lege J.D. and $5 for the general public.

Anyone who chea.ts.during a pass/fail class Won't be stopped from cheating at all. But it will show the rest of the student body what they will need to do to ac- complish their academic goals. Freshman will go through the year; adapt to all of the changes both in and out of the classroom, and learn their material honestly, with no repercQssions for the fact that they may not have been ad- equately prepared for the increase in their workload. Then when Sophomore year starts, they'll knowwhatto expect.lknowthat in discussing this with a few of my peers, the idea seemed logi- cal, and Freslnnan year would be more open for discovery and try- ing new things in new areas, with no pressure,on such early success. For me personally, I'm still mak- ing up for my Freshman year blunders when I thought I could start college off as an Econom- , ics/Japanese major. As I said, my solution won't fix the problem, but I think the overall amount of cheating will be curtailed. Finally, I know that there will be those opposed to my idea, say- ing that my thoughts are way to liberal and radical for the school to implement an idea like this. For those people, I have this to say: my idea is not on gloat There are a handful of schools who do this around the country. It would not bring Union's credibility down, for you can check the grading policy for Freshman year at MIT, and then tell me if we would lose respect. Ben Ross ' To the editor!

I don't even object to the often oppressive legislation that has made cigarette smok- ers into 9stracized Boy Scouts, foroedto take their vice outside.

Just as we have the right to drive cars and pollute the environment, get drunk;, or ·even own a gun, the fact reJlla~ns that we still have the legal choice of smok· ing a cigarette.

Charles Agar· Professor Charles Tidmarch Fondlj Remembered To the Editor: This .past week, Union College and I both lost a good friend about whom l would l~ke to share some feelings with you. Now over a year out of college, I can clearly recognize experi- ences from my time at Union that will remain a formative and in- valuable part of who I am for the rest of my life. Foremostamong them must be th·e guidance, knowledge, and friendship I re- ceived from Professor Charles Tidmarch. An indelible impression made upon me by Union is a profound respect for those who can nurture, broaden, and inspire the minds of others. Charles Tidmarch, much to our benefit, not only had this gift, but also the patience, disci- pline, and generosity to share it with us. Many things undoubtedly have and will be said about the numer- ous accomplishments of Professor Tidmarch. To his colleagues falls the task of recounting his laurels. As a student of Professor Tidmarch, my strongest remem- brance of him is simply this: From an independent study with him my freshman year to our discussion about my graduate school plans just a few weeks ago, his counsel always spun-ed my intellectual and personal growth. Never did heal- low me an easy answer- not on an exam, not in an argument, not on any of the personal matters on which I solicited his advice. With- out exception, he pushed me to achieve with integrity, attentive- ness, skepticism, genuine con- cern, and loyalty to truth. Sel- dom was this direction comfort- ing or easy to follow. Perhaps this is why he never let me down. I am furious and resentful that Charles Tidmarch was not af- forded a full measure of time to spend with us. There is a stark cruelty and injustice to this loss that humble platitudes about cos- mic purpose will not ally. Nev- ertheless, I am immensely grate- ful to have been able to have as both a mentor and a friend. I shall miss him and, as should we all, will honor his memory by striv- ing to live up to his example and meet his challenges. Mark Kuritz '92

Features November 11, 1993, page 11 A Memorable Dallas Trip For Concordiensis National Recognition for Student Newspaper and Concordy Photographer When four editors of the Con- cordiensis took off for Dallas at six o'clock on the morning. of October 28, they had no way of anticipating the weird turn of events that would characterize the trip. To the surprise of editor David Levine, nothing went wrong until about 11 a.m,. later that marning. You see, last year's trip to the National Convention almost never happened, when Mr. Levine was woken \IP by a tele- phone call at 5: 30 a.m., and the plane departing AI bany was scheduled to take off at five past six. The editors made the plane, but the trip was doomed for di- saster. Mr. Levine would subse- quently misplace his returning plane ticket while in Chicago. Enough said. Heather Reynolds; David. Levine, Lisa Lemoi, and Josh Haines arrived at the Hyatt Re- gency at ReUnion in Dallas at about ll o'clock central time. Mr. Levine went to check in at the hotel lobby, and was informed that the Hyatt, where the conven- tion was held, was overbooked.

Novem·berJl,··1993, page··-12· Features. ·. TEA ANYONE?: Greetings from Englcind Erin M. O'Neil Co-Features Editor I feel like I'm on a three month car trip in someone 's beat up, old Winnebago. Welcome to my term abroad in York, England, where the only thing to do at night, besides going to pubs, is to sit in your room and play twenty questions. But, as with any Union College student on a tenn abroad, I'm really learning a lot about myself here. For example, I've learned that I love being able to get Domino's pizza at 2 a.m. I've learned that fifteen minutes isn't long enough to eat a meal. I love having a phone I don't have to share with fifty other people. I've learned that I love McDonald's more than life itself. I've learned that I like being able to get a drink after eleven o'clock, that I enjoy getting things accom- plished in one easy step, and fi- nally, I've learned that Americans are loud and crass, and I love it. Perhaps I sound a bit negative, but it's really not so bad. Tea time lasts all day, and it's importance is phenomenal. In fact, tea time can be used as a feasible excuse for just about anything you want to get out of, most commonly work. The college nurse has been at tea for about a month now. It's a humbling experience, liv- ing in a :country where being an American is about as offensive as being a person with really bad Americans areidiots· Ameri- sers; Americans are \wankers\. Maybe so, but at least we're not still living in the 1960's. I came here thinking that things couldn't be that different, seeing as though we speak the samelan- gu.age. Yeah, right. For the first two weeks I thought I must look deathly ill or ex.tremely de- pressed, because all the British kept asking me ifl was \all right\. I finally got really annoyed, and asked what looked so wrong about me, only to be told that \Are you all right?\ Is the British equivalentto \What's up?\. Boy did I feel stupid. But that's not all. My roommate and I have A Ghost Ran off • - -- --o-· ··- - With the Beer by Sarah R. Evans Concordiensis Staff The Thursday before Hallow- een, the brothers of FIJI spon- sored a haunted house for Big Brothers/Big Sisters of Schenectady and the Reach Out Center of Schenectady. The house was decorated with pump- kins and bales of hay, along with the traditional Halloween fanfare on the first floor. The second and third floors were decorated as a haunted house. There were ap- proximately 100 children all dressed in costumes; ranging in age from pre-school to 15 years old. It was first posed to the broth- ers three years ago to sponsor a haunted house for Big Brothers/ Big Sisters. \The first year it was not very well attended, but each year it has gotten bigg'er and bet- ter,\ said Joe Saltzbart, the orga- nizer of the event. He also ex- pressed a desire \for the haunted house to become a mainstay with the fraternity.\ The imagination and creativity that the brothers put into decorat- ing was apparent as I walked up- stairs with a group of kids. The tour guides were dressed in a black suits, and told morbid sto- ries as the children walked up- stairs. As my tour group entered the first room, I knew that the haunted house was going to be scary. After the first room, one of the younger kids in my group went back downstairs crying be- cause she was scared. Another little boy dressed as a devil asked me if he could hold my hand as we went through the rest of the house. Every room had a differ- ent theme. One room was a vam- pire theme, another was a tunnel, there was a room haunted by the spirits of two former brothers that still stalked the room, and in yet another room characters jumped out and frightened the group. I, myself, was scared enough, in one of the rooms, to jump up and hit my head on the tunnel. The little boy who held my hand during the haunted house said that he really enjoyed it and · his favorite part was \when the guy jumped out of the refrigera- tor,\ and he was most scared \when Frankenstein jumped out of the box.\ Another little girl in my group, who was apparently not scared of anything said that although it was not scary she thought it was neat. The brothers had as much fun preparing the haunted house as the children had going to it. David Grandwetter said, \we totally didn't mind preparing it because we knew it was for a great cause and the kids would enjoy it. An- other brother, Dagan LaCorte, stated that \the kids had a great time and were really scared. I am. really honored that we could put on a show like this, that helps the community and the kids had fun.\ After all of the kids had gone through the haunted house, the brothers all came down and served refreshments to the kids of caramel apples, sundaes and other Halloween treats.

Features Novembe,r ll; 1993, page 13 A 9-foot Yoda and Mole the Cannibal Haunted the Delta Man.sion This Halloween Weekend \ , .- by Casey Kurtz Contributing Wtiter On 1l1ursday, October 28, the Boys and Gi.rls Club of Schenectady were scared out ·of their pants, when they visited Castle Eviction, known to most students as Delta Phi. This was not unusual, as many visitors have often left the house pale-faced and screaming. However, on this particularly chilling night, there was even more cause for fear. But we are getting ahead of ourselves. The Delta Mansion was actu- ally clean, stnelled.okay, but still managed to maintain its forebod- ing appearance. Thanks to Tyrone Velde, a man who sacri- ficed his daily schedule for the good ofthe young. boys and girls, and a handful of other generous brothers; the place was looking especially creepy. Special thanks also goes to Pam \Animal'' Novell, Denise ')ump in my Pot\ Alexander, \Gory\ . Lori Mickenberg, Beth \Sit on my broom\ Freeling, and Club 1045, without whom the eventcould not have been such a succ.ess. Starting at dusk, the kids were led throngl'l the house in groups (James \This is my real face\ Dever). The hosts protected the visitors from many evil .,,..;.r;t., . cooking a deadly broth,. a glow- ing head floating mysteriousty in air, Mole the Cannibal, maniacs Phi 'scared the pants off' for the Boys and Girls Club of Schenectady of six by two spooky hosts: a lurking throughout the candlttlit carrying power tools, Sean queer looking leprechaun (Gene house. The children were hom- O'Brien's pet bats and spiders, Kublanov) and a 9-foot tall Yoda fied at the sight of two\ witches but most of all by the cold stare of Jon Pearlman, who made at least two girls cry. After everyone had been through the house once, and a few brave souls twice, the kids en- joyed a memorable reception. There were delicious apples, fresh cider, candy, and other goodies for all, but the real treat came when all the goulish creatures marched down to the party ami took off their masks and makeup, revealing their true identities. The kids, many still shaking from the experience, were relieved to see the smiling faced of Jared \hclter\ Seiter, Tim \I love kids\ Walsh, Wildman \Billy\ Goldman, and others. After the children had happily ridden off into the night, future mayor Nish Nadaraja summed up the evening as the brothers hu<ildled closely by the fireplace: \Guys it just doesn't get any bet- ter than this. We came together as a house, we had fun ourselves, but best of all, we gave those kids a night they'll remember for a long time. What a Happy Halloween this was!\ It's About Time: On Campus Help for Eating Disorders TEA TIME Continued continued from page 13 learned to appreciate the United States and the many conveniences it has to offer. I'm typing this article on my neighbor's 16th century manual typewriter. Wlmt can I say? Blame it on the Queen . Ta, loves! ., , ' [, by Michelle Ellis'; · · Concordiensis Staff . Do .you know . how many women suffer from eating disor- ders, low self-esteem, or poor nutrition on Union's campus? Look around in your classes and your suspicions will be con- firmed, as a young women with limp hair, swollen cheeks, and baggy clothes tries to hide in her seat. How does Union address this issue? they do absolutely nothing. The nutritionist at West was dis- continued six months ago and the school ha.s yet to replace the po- sition. In addition, the eating dis- order group that the school offers occurs only once. a month and stu- dents feel uncomfortable attend- ing and do not attend the group. Fortunately, a new support group has been created by women stu- dents and is for women students to discuss nutrition, over- eating, and eating disorders. Beth Decker 96' ha~ the insight and momentum to .cre.ate .th.e foundation for the support group. She is the fire behind the flyers. She reveals her inspiration in the following words. \I found that Union College did not have suf- ficient services in dealing with nutrition and ea~ing disorders on campus. I wanted to learn more about eating well and I have had experience with fric;;nds who have eating problems. If one looks around the college community they will see the need for such a group. I believe that the need for an \Eating Awareness Group\ is necessary, as eating. disorders plague society and in particular young women.\ The. Women's Union supports the \Eating Awareness Group\ and they are championing th.e· new group's. cause.. \The Women's Union really wants to become involved with the issue of eating disorders, as we feel this problem is pervasive on campus.\ They urge women who are in- valved with the Women's Union and those who are not, to come by a meeting ¥td see if the group can help them orJthej:r friends. The \Eating Awareness Group\ is planning to host a nu- tritionist in future weeks and other important speakers and events are being discussed by the women who attend the meetings. The at- mosphere of each meeting is in- formal and may remind One of hanging out with your girl friends in your dorm, in which you dis- cuss how you feel about yourself in comparison to societies expec- tations. Many women are quiet observers although ·a few regulars are always open and share their experienc~s with the other women. It is important to stress that their is no pressure upon women to talk, although it is hoped that. the intimacy of a small group of women students will provide a nurturing environment for those who need to talk, listen, so please. Any mail is good mail. Write me! In closing, while Englandis a . wonderful, beautiful, rainy, vague, and charming place, I've Fundraiser for Mohammad A. Omar Memorial courtesy of Ethel B. David A heartfelt thanks is extended to the College community for its participation and support of the memorial efforts for Mohammad A. Omar. Without a doubt, Mohammad touched many lives during his short stay with us. Because of the lateness in the season, it was necessary to post- pone planting of the tree until spring. Cost for the tree and me- morial stone is approximately $450. To date, a total of$290.45 has been received. Donations are still being collected. .

Horror at Webster House Halloween Eve Shaun-Paul~anore Contributing Writer On October 27th Webster House residence hall was turned into a thrill a minute, house of terror. At 8:00p.m. the doors were opened to the campus community and the , first victims were admitted. Mild- mannered Union students trans- formed themselves into ghosts, goblins and vampires all in order to scare their fellow students. Those who were stout of heart enough to brave the interior of the house were treated to a mind- bending display ofhorror unlike anything seen on this campus. As scream after scream reverbeated around the halls it became obvi- ous that things were getting out of control and that someone had to put an end to the massacre. Because we had to escort so many students out of the residence hall in tears the doors were closed at 10:00 and the Haunted House re- turned to its dormant state dis- .guised as Webster Residence Hall. dure the Haunted House again; Webster House was opened up to (ti '~ ~ Deciding that their school a real challenge, the citizens of mates were far too skittish to en- Schenectady. Some students de- cided to disguise themselves as Schenectady citizens and again brave the Haunted House. It be- came obvious that the talent and enthusiasm of those who con- Structed and worked on the project was awesome to the point of being overwhelming. Some who were incredjbly brave at heart attempted the house numer- ous times and many a voice was to be heard saying, \This is even better than the ones at the mall.\ After catching their breath the adventerous souls were then es- corted to Fox and Davidson in order to do a little trick-or-treat- mg. Over 200 people attented the Haunted House which was spon- sored by Webster House Resi- dence Hall and the Social Committe. A great was held by all who participated in and helped and we look forward to making this an annual project, and any suggestions would be appreci- ated. We would again like to thank those who did construction, those who acted, and everyone else who participated. We hope to see you all again next year.

Arts & Entertainment Novembe.r 11, 1993, Page 15 Caffe Dolce: Nirvana for the Java Junkie by Leif Zurmuhlen Visual Arts Department , Unlike most Union students, 1992 graduate Bret Goldin didn't leave town immediately after ·commencement. This Econom- ics/Political Science major stayed in Schenectady and was em- ployed briefly at the Open Door Bookstore on Jay Street. One day he noticed an empty space for vent two doors down from where he was working, and he was struck with an idea. The result is Caffe Dolce, In- temational Coffeehouse & Kiosk, a coffee lover's haven in the heart of downtown Schenectady. \The town needed it, I needed a job, and I love coffee\ is Bret's simple explanation. Caffe Dolce offers goUrrtlet coffees, with at least five flavors brewed daily, and they will gladly grind and French press any of the 30 types of beans .also available for sale. Exotic teas, cappuccino, espresso, hot chocolate, gounnet desserts and lite fare such· as bagels, stuffed croissants, and bis.cotti are also featured. Coffee is $1.25 per cup with three free refills, or you can bring your own mug for cof- fee-to-go for 75¢. Ifyou're in a real hurry buy some chocolate covered espresso beans and main- line sugar and caffeine without the dilution and delay of.hot wa- ter. Besides providing a nirvana for the modern Java junkie, Bret also hopes to make Caffe Dolce a downtown cultural Mecca as well. He carries an eclectic array of over 60 magazine titles, which run the gamut from mainstream (Bazaar) to foreign (Paris Vogue} to small press, special interest publications (Shaman's Drum, Exquisite Corpse). Friday nights ar~ open mike for musicians be- ginning at 8:30PM. Every other Wednesday night at 8PM it's open mike for poets, the next be- ing November 17. On December 11, Kelvin Christopher James, author ofthe new novel \Secrets\ will give a reading of his poetry (call for time). Caffe Dolce has also opened it's walls to visual artists. On exhibit now are photographs by Professor Charles Steckler. On November 20 at 6:30 PM there will be an opening reception for an exhibit of photographs by Leif Zurmuhlen and Bevan Myers. Bret intends to have work on dis- play continually. The coffee- house has also received large be- fore and after-show crowds from events at Proctor's Theatre. Since opening in early Octo- ber, business has been better than Bret had hoped for. · He credits strong word of mouth, and the fact that many customers quickly become regulars. \As a student there was nowhere to hang out if you were underage. Schenectady gets a bad rap, there are really some great shops here on Jay Street. I wanted to bring the col- lege and the town together-and it's worked.! The first poetry night crowd ranged in age from 14 to 84, with people coming from Albany, Schenectady, Scotia, plus students and profes- sors from Union.\ said Schenectady's new Coffee Czar happily. Caffe Dolce offers a 10% dis- Albany Architecture: So·on- To-Be-Released by Belinda Crago Arts Editor When most of us think of Al- bany and its architecture, the Egg, that space aged monstrosity that looks like it carne out of & Buck Roger's movie, usually comes to mind. However, there is much more to Albany than this, and the local photographers Gary Gold and Mark McCarthy intend to relay this message in the soon-to- be-released Albany Architecture. A Guide to the City. Albany is a city of great public history, and its capitol building that rests near State Street hill, is a constant reminder of this. But aside from these grand public spaces, Albany is a city of charm- ing neighborhoods. and vital com- merce whose architecture cannot be denied. Albany's Architecture explores the nooks, crannies, and backstreets of this architecture in a fascinating and new approach. As the first of its kind guide to architecture, Albany's Architec- ture, illustrates the characteristics · and personality of Albany as it progressed through val'ious his- torical periods. It examines the character and architectural tradi- tions of Albany through a long line of extraordinarily talented architects such as Phillip Hooker, H.H. Richardson, Leopold Eidlitz Marcus T. Reynolds and Wallace K. Harrison. The book empha- sizes the chann these artists added to Albany through a series of vi- gnettes of daily life and personal stories ofthe architects and build- ers. With its fascinating new and historical photographs, Albany Architecture rediscovers one of America's oldest cities. It is a worthy guide that offers ten walk· ing and driving tours through the city: downtown, Center Square, Washington Park, the Pastures, Arbor Hill, streetcar and trolley neighborhoods, industrial North Albany, government buildings and even sculpture. Photographs from Albany Ar- chitecture are now on display at the Albany Institute of Art and History. This sneak preview of the book is on view from Satur- day November 20th to Sunday January 2. count to Union students With an I.D.

(photo by Leiflurmuh/en) Stress Relief: Try Pottery by Jeremy Goverman Contributing Writer Yes, it's true; we have pottery at Union college ... yes, justlike in the movie \Ghost'' .. .I know, such diversity. The Ceramics Club of Union College would first of all like to thank everyone who par- ticipated in a class or anyone who just came in to make pots this term. The Ceramic studio is located behind the psychology building and behind North college in the garage. We have three wheels and two kilns. This tenn, we had approximately 40 members, of which 30 or so took lessons once a week in a class of three taught by myself and another qualified instructor, Robin Macdonald. Two lessons were offered every evening, and one lesson was of- fered over the weekend. Many students were interested in ceramics as a constructive out- letto vent their stress and creative ability, after all it is nice to spin up a beautiful vase after sitting through a four hour chemistry lab. Other students wanted to get their holiday shopping done by mak- ing gifts for everyone they knew, Many of the students had taken a class in high school, and wanted to continue; and then there were those people who had never tried anything like it before, but just thought it might be neat to try. You don't have to be an aspir- ing artist to make pots. You don't have to know how to draw or paint in order to make pots. All that is really required in the con- struction of ceramic pottecy is a good imagination, and the will- ingness to get your hands dirty. Just watching as a lump of dirt is transfonned into a work of art is enough to get most people inter- ested. .· So if any of this sounds like something you would like to be involved in for next tenn. You can give me a call (Jeremy Goverman), or drop by the stu- dio any night between 5:00-8:~: faculty. staff, students, etc ... all aj:e welcome. ·' •. .;> -·

November 11, 1993, page 16 Arts&Entertainment Nutcracker Comes to Proctor's: Two Union Students to Perform by Nico-le Goldin Arts Editor Next month, the capitol region is fortunate in that the Nutcracket is coming to town. For the sixth consecutive year, the Northeast Ballet Company and Proctor's Theater are co-producing the pro- duction of this timeless classic. Kyra Nichols and Philip Neal, the two main leads, come to Proctor's stage from the New York City Ballet. In a conversation with Darlene Myers, the Artistic Director of the show, she stated that \Proctor's Theatre is the perfect place for the Nutcracker and that it really adds to the production.\ Ms. Myers teaches ballet in the Myers Stu- dio, and also founded the North- east Ballet Company three years ago. TI1is company is also the resident ballet company of Proctor's. Ms. Myers taught Bal- let at Union in the 1980's, and was a bit hesitant to re-accept the po- sition this year, however she men- tioned how working with Union students ensures her that she made the right decision in com- ing back. This year's production is espe- cially 'close to home' because two Union students were chosen as principles. Hillary Snow will be perfonning in the \Waltz ofthe Flowers,\ and willalsobe a Snow Crystal. Melissa Weiner's roles include the first Victorian party scene, the lead in the Chinese Variation and Snow. When asked why these two students were cho- sen, Ms. Myers responded, Hillary Snow (left) .and Melissa Weiner {photo by Leif Zurmuhlen) \Hillary is a wonderful technician with a beautiful classical line and Melissa has tremendous perfonn- ing qualities.\ She also com- mented on how easy both girls are to work with because of their in- telligence and dedication .. Jtillary to become professional you must give up your life, \that you must eat, sleep, and breathe ballet.\ Ms. Myers conveyed that in the future she hopes to use more Union students in her produc- tions. This years production utilizes a cast of approximately 120 cast members of all ages. On stage the .set will include a live horse with a Victorian Carriage. The dates for the show eire Saturday, De- cember 18th at 7pm and. Sunday the 19th at 2pm. Tickets are go- ing fast so if you are interested I recommend picking them up as soon as possible.

Stone Newman and ItwasanaveragedayinSyracuse, even with the sleet and snow, the by Lee Schacter Associate Sports Editor The Union College Swimming and Diving teams kicked offtheir seasons this past weekend when Union hosted the Union Relays- a relay meet consisting of eight men's teams and eight women's teams. Both the Union men's team and the Union women's team started the season strong, as the men took second and the women placed first. This was the men's best perfonnance ever in this annual meet, finishing ahead of perennial powerhouse Hartwick- a fine achievement. The women's victory tied their best finish ever. The coaching staff behind all ofthis has a new look: only head coach Susan Bassett, in her seventh year, and assistant coach Dirk Francois are returning coaches. New to the Union College pool are assistant coaches Lisa Klitz and T.J. Davis, and diving coach Dave Robison. Now for an in-depth preseason look at .one of the northeast's most up-and-coming swimming and diving programs. On the women's side, there are nine freshman swimmers and divers- close to half of the team. They are: Amy Ambrosini, Jennipher Borey, CeCe Buchanan, Jackie Crane, Lindsey Johnston, Heather Kanser, Alyson McKee, Mo· O'Donnell, and Nicole Rubin. Kanser and Rubin are the divers. Returning swimmers are Jenn Allaire, Jen Baldwin, Kelly Bevan, Kristy Campbell, Jen Davidson, Eri Hayashi, Julie Ivanyi, Jonatha Meade, Anne Rozwadowski, Erica Saltz, Jenn Terrell, and Natasha Zabka. l11is weekend, these women clobbered the rest of the field, defeating second place Hartwick by over forty points! Union took first in seven out of nine eveuts, and placed second in the remaining two re- lays. Seniors Jen Baldwin and Kelly Bevan were in four first place relays each. Jenn Allaire, Jonatha Meade, Eri Hayashi, and Jackie Crane were each members of three first place relays. Alyson McKee had two first place fin- ishes, and Mo O'Donnell, Jenn Terrell, and CeCe Buchanan were in one first place relay each. With such a dominating perfonnance in this early-season meet. and such a great all-around team ef- fort, one can see only good things coming from this team this sea- Trey Coscia cold, bleak,anddreary.

Overall, Union took first in five of the nine . races, with some very impressive · times that will be sure to challenge the team records that are presently up on the board, as well as the rest · of the teams in New York State. There are nine freshmen on this team, and this team is clearly im- . proved after only losing three se- niors to graduation in the off-sea- son. The freshmen are Mike · Humphreys, Kevin Makarowski, . Than Stuntz, Eric Menard, Rob Cohen, Ken Hackett, Mike Miller; Stephen Potenza, and Eric Smith. The rest ofthe team is made up of Scott Bowden; John Fitzgerald, Bill Humphreys, Robbie Johnson, Tsuyoshi \Kobi\ Kobayashi, Luke Payne, Drew Pirich, Chip Quarrier, Chris Riley, Dave Saad, Geoff Wolfe, Matt Woodrow, Chris Yousey, James Ernst, and Adam Horst. Makarowski and Bowden were each in four first . place relays, while Mike Humphreys and Chris Yousey were in two each. Bill HumP.hreys, Johnson, Pirich, Quarrier, Riley, and Stuntz were each in a first place relay as well. Freshmen phenoms Makarowski and Mike Humphreys wowed the crowd, as they showed that there is lots of young talent on this team to go along with the experience and talent of a rising team. l11e men also took first place in seven out of nine \B relays\ taking sec-· ond in each of the remaining two relays, showing incredible depth on a team aiming for its first state championship ever. So everything seems in order · for two strong swimming and div- ing teams to have great competi- tive seasons and see the matura- tion of young talent on both the men's and women's teams.

(photo by Stone Newman/TC) semi-final round of the New York State Empire division Rugby championship. This was the Dutchmen's first appearance in post-season play. After the previous weeks rout- ing of Colgate, Dutchmen spirits · were high going into the tourna- ment. The week before the trip to Syracuse, energy levels were boosted and there were record turn outs for practice. However, two injuries made the Ruggers quest more challenging. BJ \Scarface\ Marcoullier was bit by a dog a few days before the game. · No one was quite sure how it hap- pened, but rumor has it he was caught breaking into Richmond and the guard dogs attacked him. As for Charlie King, he con- tracted the plague. due to massive head trauma, which he is still suffering from. He was replaced by Stone \th~ stump\ Newman, who towered at his. new position. Just as things stmted to pick up for the Dutch- men, Jason \Bison\ Rothschild sustained an injury to his trick knee. Another young freshman, Alex Douville, came in and knocked around a bit. The one highlight was the pure display of fifteen man rugby, capped off by Chris DeLano's score. These were the sole points awarded to the valiant Dutchmen. Sunday was a new day, and have a bald hooker. This season was by far Union's best in ages. It can be attributed to the leadership of the veterans and the strong work ethic created by them. However, the strongest asset to the success of the team was Skip Aycox, our stellar coach and mentor. The Dutchmen Ruggers went undefeated until the final melee, and look to be strong in the future. BJ Marcoullier, Peder Maarbjerg, and Charlie King will be greatly missed come next fall. On a final note, Union had a strong showing with five players in the All-star game. Football Team Seeded Second continuedfrombackpage November 14th. In addition the Dutchmen stand a chance of hav- ing home-field advantage in their first game, but that too will be unknown until the 14th. The Dutchmen were last in- volved in post-season play dur- ing the 1991 season. Their most recent playoff success came dur- ing the 1989 post season. That year the Dutchmen .competed in the Division III national champi- onship Stagg Bowl against Day- ton, a game which they lost 17-7. This years squad is hoping to cap- ture the Natioi1al Championship. The Dutchmen have many players who have contributed to the success of this years team, Junior quarterback Scott Newton has recorded twelve consecutive victories, since capturing the starting position mid-way through last season. Newton was the top ranked quarterback in the Upstate region. Junior running back Chris Irving led the team in mshing for the second consecutive year, to- taling 862 yards. l11e defensive team is led by senior linebackers Marco Lainez and Craig Mosia, the team's co~ captains. The performance of Lainez and Mosia are a major rea- son why the Dutchmen have held their opponents to an average of 9. 7 points per game. As a whol.e, Union has outscored their opponents by 200 points (287-87). In addition the Dutchmen out-rushed their oppo- nents by over one thousand yards (1793 .7 to 708) The first playoff game will take place on November 20th, and ·· Union will be hoping to be na- tional champions by the time of the new year.

SPORTS' November 11, -1993, page 19 Parachuter : Not Since the '86 Mets .. o.ftb·e·Week ··· ,~.,~,·'st;rn : by Greg Kalish Associate Spotts Editor To all those who watched the heavyweight championship fight between Evander Holyfield and Riddick Bowe on Saturday night, let me be the first to congratulate you! Not only were you lucky enough to see Evander Holyfield become just the third fighter in history to win back the heavy- weight belt after losing it, you also witnessed perhaps the most unbelievably bizarre occurrence in the history ofsports, let alone boxing. An:d for those who were not witnesses to .the events and have been living in some sort of fog for the last week, here is what transpired in Las Vegas. At 1:10 of the seventh round, a parachuter, who was spotted some time earlier on the cameras ofthe.Family Channel blimp hov- ering above, free-fell into the top rope of the Caesar's Palace ring as his chute dangled from the lighting structures above. He was then dragged off the ropes and thrown into the throng of specta- tors, who proceeded to beat his severely. The fight (the one be- tween Holyfield and Bowe) was delayed for twenty-one minutes as ringside officials and the Ne- vada State Police attempted to restore order. The only injury of any severity was incurred by the flyer himself, those injuries. re- sulting from the beating he re• ceived, upon his unexpected ar- rival. Judy Bowe, the wife of Riddick Bowe, who is three- months pregnant, fainted and had to be removed by a stretcher. She was taken to the hospital where shew~ released in fine condition, sometime later. On Sunday, the flyer, who was identified as James Miller Of Ne- vada, was placed on the infamous hospital-to-jaH shuttle as he was released with only minor injuries. He was charged with \dangerous flying,\ a misdemeanor which carries a sentence of up to one year. He also faces a possible fine or community service sentence. Hard to say what this man was thinking when he decided to pull ' . this prank. While the thought of parachuting into a boxing ring is rather unique, the idea of making Hockey Team. on a Rampage_ continued from hack page freshmen class was called upon to score goals. Through two games, five 0fthe team's eleven goals have been scored by fresh- men, with a total of eight differ- ent players scoring goals. If the Dutchmen continue to get goal production from a wide variety of players, then the team should be very successful. This weekend the Dutchmen travel north to play divisional opponents St. Lawrence and Clarkson. The Clarkson game marks the homecoming for assis- tanLcoa.ch Dave Green, who played for the Golden Knights for four years. ADVANCE NOTICE NCAA.

T hink about sup~orting yourself f~r twenty-five, thtrty years or longer in retirement. It might bt'l the greatest financial test you'll ever face. Fortunately, you have one valuable asset in your favor. Time. Time to take advantage of tax-deferral. Time for your money to grow. But starting early is key. Consider this: if you begin saving just $100 a month .at age thirty, you can accumulate $172,109* by the time you reach age sixty-five. Wait ten years and you'd need to set aside $2'19 a month to reach the same goal. · At TIAA-CREF, we not only under- stand the value of starting early, we can help make it possible-with flexible retirement and tax-deferred annuity plans, a diverse portfolio of investment choices, and a record of personal service that spans 75 years.

The Dutchmen are ranked behind Rowan, whose only loss came against Division 1-AA C.W. Post. The win over Rochester .guarantees the Dutch- men a spot in the N.C.A.A. play- offs. Although the Dutchmen are as- sured a playoff spot, they are pres- ently unaware of who and where they play. The reason why the Dutchmen remain in limbo, is because Union's season ended one week before most of the other teams. Union's playoff situation will hinge on the performance of these teams in their final week of play. Chris Irving anchored Union's ground attack against Roc/tester last Saturday. He is shown here, turning upjield after receiving tire lwndoff from quarterback Scott Newton {in the background). Union's 24-6 victory over Roc/lester .completed tl1e Dutchmen's perfect 9- 0 season, and assured them of a spot in the NCAA Division III Playoffs.

In that endeavor the Dutchmen faced off against McGill University, a Montreal based school. The Dutchmen took a convincing 4-1 lead, but in the end settled for a 4~3 wm. Of the four Dutchmen scorers, three were freshmen. The three rookie scorers were Chad Thompson, Bill Moody, and Troy Stevens. The only vet- eran scorer was junior assistant captain Chris Albert, who scored on an impressive single-handed effort in the second period. The victory against McGill was the first time the team has won its season opener, since entering di- vision I competition, two years ago. This past Saturday, the Dutch- men took their l-0 record on the road to face the cadets of A1my. Two years ago, Union took Anny's place in the E.C.A.C., while the cadets became an inde- pendent team. Last season the Dutchmen were edged oul by Army 6-5 at home, and. were looking for revenge on the road. In all oflast season the Dutchmen were unable to get a victmy away from Achilles Rink, this year however they were able to accom- plish a win in their first try. The Dutchmen scored one minute into the game, when fresh- man Troy Stevens won a face-off deep in the Army zone, he then passed it to junior Cory Holbrough who sh.ot it by a clueless Anny goaltender. The Dutchmen scored an almost iden- tical goal seven minutes later, when Stevens again won the draw to Holbrough, who blast~d it past the Army goalie. After taking the lead 2-0, the play of the Dutch- men began to lapse, and Anny capital- ized, cutting their deficit in half, with five minutes left in the first pe- riod. it by the Army goalie for his first goal of the season. Union ex- tended its lead to 5-1, when on the power play Brad Kukko re- covered his own rebound and shot the puck over a sprawled Army goalie, Chris Albert and the locker room, up 6-2. - Mike Gallant.
