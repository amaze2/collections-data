Hauser, Vice President for Finance and Administration. Union Athletics: • Role Reviewed. By MARCY BURSTINER News Editor In the past ten years the athletic department at Union has gene through some drastic changes. Soon after the Ned Harkness scandal of about seven years ago, the Administration and the Athletic Department have had · to ascertain the extent which the role of athletics woUld piay in such an academically oriented college. According to Richard Sakala, Director of Athletics, ever since tie came to the · College in 1977 he \has been tryil'!g t() bull~' and develop a qualitY: athletic program that comph~ents the quality acadenuc programs- at Union College.'~ He stresses that there is no conflict between athletics and academics. Sakala explained that when he carne to the College in '77, the program was \really i,n a tremendous state of confusion in terms of what its role within the College really was. . . We had to establish some definite internal gUidelines in terms of what direction we really wanted to go.\ upgraded, the standards by which athletes are admitted into Union have not been diminished in any way. In recruiting athletes, the Atbletlc Department works closely with the Admissions Office. Ken Nourse, Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid, explained that a staff member of the Admissions Office serves as a liason with the· Athletic Department. He sets up daily or weekly schedules with each coach and keeps a record of the prospective athletes whom the coaches are interested in. The Athletic Department initially sends out mass mailings to all high schools in the eastern states region and from the Fesponses from high school coaches, selects the better athletes and makes a record of the'ir academic credentials. The coaches then travel to the various nigh schools in an at- tempt to acquaint the prospective recruits with the athletic and academic merits of Union College. · The athletic abilities of each recruit is recorded in a .file according to a ranking system; . each recruit is ranked on a scale according to their athletic ability. The file, including the rank, is then sent to the Continued on p~ge 3 One step the Athletic Department took in its effort to rebuild the athletic programs was to withdraw from the New · England Small College Athleti~ Conference of which it had been a member. The AdminiStration decided to withdraw its membership from NESCAC for they felt it waatoo restrictive in terms of the set regulations for the recmitment of athletes. NESCAC; for instance, did not allow a participating college\ to have any personal contact with the recruit. What happened, Sakala explained, was that the quality athletes would choose to go to schools such as' Williams, A~herst; and Weslyan Prunarily becai:J§~coll~ges such _. as these were more Widely ~ recognized for quality of both u the athletics and the academies. ~ . \I think it was a tremendous w · disadvantage to Union not to be a:. able to gQ on the road to_ sell its > By Doug Landon News Editor Editor's Note: The foUowmg Js the· first installment In a series on College finances •. For additional lnfonnatiOII on the article, pleue refer to the corresponding Summary of Revenue and EXpeQ.se table on Page 2. With Union~s 1981-82 actual finance report to be presented to tne Board of Trustees on October 15, Vice· President for Finance and Administration- John . R. Hauser expects th~ Board's approval. Union's budget is prepared at the beginning of each fiscal year (JUly 1 to June 30)~ and the actual report is a breakdown of finances compiled after the fiscal year is completed, stating exactly how much money was taken in and spent. Hauser outlines and explains the various sources of revenue and expenditures of the College which nave been used to prepare the 1981-82 budget. Tuitions for undergraduate students; Graduate Studies, and, Continuing Education, as well as room and board for those students who live on campus, account for about 75 percent of College revenue. In the budget, however, dormitories and Food Service are reclJrded as separate entities under Auxiliary Enterprises. Union's Endowment now totals nearly $50 million, and income and interest from the invested sum are incorpOrated into the annual budget, while the principle is maintained unspent. Gifts and Grants are classified as either unrestricted or restricted income. The un~estricted funds enter the revenue statement as they are received, whereas restricted income is only added to the report when the monies are spent. Restricted funds which have not yet been used are pilt into the reserve fund. The reason for this procedure, according to Hauser , is to balance bulk grants intended to be used over a long period of time. Instead of entering a total amount for .such grants on one year's statement, explains h product. .. Union has always ~ ad a visibility problem-., o Sakal:a commented that 1i although the College recruit- ment .procedures have been Richard Sakala, Director of Athletics !0: 6l ,, J .

The go 1S to in- crease the 1977 figure of $31 nilllion by $20. million by l984, and Hauser fully expects -to reach this amount. The number of undergraduate students printed was a con- servative estimate, but Hauser pOints out that Administration is trying to keep the number close to 1940, without going below it. More students mean more income, but at the present time overcrowded housing and other situations make -1940 the ideal number to plan on: 1940 was the predicted number for 198().;81, also, but actually there were 1996 undergraduates that year. The surplus revenue generated by the· additional students is used for unan- ticipated expenses. For example, tb.e $400,000 asbestos removal in Davidson and Fox dorms two years ~go, and tbe $300,000 renovations to Hickok House. this- past- swnmer were ·· funded through this exeess income. Hauser stressesthat one must not be confused by the idea of a non-profit organization producing more money than it budgets out as eXpenditures. Many expenses ''not normal to operations\ must be incurred, such as the.dormitory projects, implementation of computer facilities~ and the all-weather athletic field. \Since the excess that is produced is required for many college needs,\ says Hauser, \it makes good financial sense to continue to produce this exc.ess.'' The Federal Government tere_3t Subsidy is a program esigned to aid colleges which orrow money for im· provementS to their institutions. New York State Aid, commonly referred to as the Bundy Program, consists of aid with unrestricted intention granted to colleges based on the number each of various degrees awarded yearly. · Student Aid revenue includes a collection of gifts and grants to be used for financial assistance, as well as Federal Supplemental Equal · Oppor- tunity Grants (SEOG). Basic Equal Opportunity Grants (BEOG) arid New York State Tuition Assistance Program (TAP) awards are -given directly to individual students, with colleges acting only as agents, and are therefoFe not considered part of Union's Student Aid. \Other properties\ that earn income include a few houses in the City of. Schenectady which . the College rents out. The Campus Store does turn a slight profit, however Hauser points outthat textbooks are priced as close to College cost as possible, because they are essentials to students. Money is made through the sale of other items in the store. Achilles Rink shows a loss according to the budget, but the facility has been given a $1 million endowment within the last year. Excess Food Service revenue, if not used in that depa.rtment, is turned over to the Campus Improvement Fund. On the expenditure side, the first and largest entry denotes departmental salaries, wages and operating costs, while the Continued on page 2 Itinerary for Mr. A.H.

Page 2 OONOORDIEN818, October-'1, 1981 Jobs Made Availabl~ By SHERRY WEITZEN Staff Student employment plays an integral part of campus life at Union College. Students can be found working all over campus, from West Dining Room to the Admissions Office. Students are referred to the various departments on campus, for employment, by the Personnel Office, located on the first floor vf Silliman Hall. In addition to student employment the office also handles other employment, employee and labor relations, payroll processing, wage and salary administration, and employee benefits. ' Mrs. Cindy Bouck is in charge of the student employmeqt division of the Personnel Office, as well as employee benefits and non-student employees. Mrs. Bouck has been at Union since 1978, and has been able to greatly improve the work study program. She feels that more personal contact with the students and the various departments is very important for making the system work. If either the student or the department that he or she is working for should have a problem, they should come to her and try to work it out. Mrs. Bouck has found that this method works about 90 percent of the time. By having this contact, she has been able to minimize the turn-over in student employees that used to occur. Jobs on campus are first given to those students that have been granted work em- ployment opportunity through the financial aid office. During the summer, before school starts, .. the Personnel Office sends out an information sheet for freshmen and up- perclassnlen who have just been granted. the work em- ployment opportunity. This survey asks the student if he has any skills, such as typing, that might be useful in employment, and if he has any particular interests. In the fall, the students receive a referral for the department they will be working for. Bouck says that .she tries to give students their first or second choice. The bulk. of the students are referred to food service. If a student is unhappy with the jolt he has been assigned, he may go to see Mrs. Bouck on one of the first few days of school and c~nge jobs if there are any opemngs. Since some students choose to decline or defer employment for a term, jobs are often available for those students who wish to change. · Returning students., if requested back by their previous employer, which is most often the case, receive their referrals when they get back to school. The Personnel Office got 250 of these students out of the way aiid into jobs before the start of school. If upperclassmen wish to change jobs, they must go to Mrs. Bouck and see if there are any other openings. The students set up schedules with the departments to whicn they have been assigned. Each . department has its own rules and the students that are em- ployed there are expected to comply to them. MO$t students work about 8 hours a week for the fulllO weeks ·Of the term. In general, the departments are flexible about hours and they will accommodate the students. They expect the employees to be responsible and reliable. Departments may request a student with a certain course back.ground or skill. The Per- sonnel Office-is careful to place students that are capable for particular jobs. Also, if a department asks for a specific student, the office tries to ac- commodate it. Departments like to have students of different years so there will always be someone with experience for the next year. Since many times students who have been granted work employment opportunity decline or defer employment because of various reasons, the remaining jobs are open to any other student on campus, whether or not they are on work study. Oftenjobs open up in food service, and temporary jobs open up from anywhere bet- ween two hours to three weeks. Students not on work study fffi out applications and Mrs. Bouck contacts them if anything opens up. This year there are ap- proximately 600 students on the payroll.

The group arrived in Provincetown early Friday evening. After being forewarned that wake-up call was to be at six o'clock the following morning the students were free to-do as they pleased until then.

She then infonned the disappointed group that there was a whale in the harbor. An orca had swum into the waters two weeks before and had been affectionately dubbed Annabel by the townspeople. Annabel was a friendly whale with whom townspeople swam. Union students were able to take pictures of the. whale surfacing. · After breakfast everyone once again boarded the bus, this time with the intention ofseeing the New England Aquarltun in Boston.

Nourse's personal goal for the Athletic Department is that for any opposing team the College plays; Union should have at least a 5().;50 chance of winning. \We won't be outgunned, or outmatched,'-' he declared, Nourse was quick to explain, though, that no matter how good a football or hockey player a prospective student might be, there are certain academic standards that must be met for admission to the College. -He went on to say that if a prospect has a marginal academic record, his · athletic . par- ticipation in high school can ma.ke a difference. Both Nourse and Sakala stress that the quality of the athietes who are admitted adds to the diversity of the student body. Nourse added tha the. ad- missions staff has a · \good rapport with the coaches.\ The coaches, he explained are ''pretty realistic''-they un- derstand what the Admissions Office will or-will not accept. By ex~;~mining some statistics on the football recruits, one can see that the Admissions Office is not lenient with applicants. In an average year, according to Sakala, out of an estimated 11- 1200 recruits, 340 end up ap- plying and the Admissions Office accepts only about 30 percent of these applicants. Out of the estimated 90 that are accepted, he went on, only 35 actually come. Nourse also stated that the dropout rate of athletes once they are in the college is no greater than that of the entire student body. As a final comment Sakala noted, \I feel very comfortable in the way this has been done; low .key, aboveboard, and in a very professional manner. . ..

One major project under · serious consideration at the present tir:ne by the Administration is the concept of a Student Union. · VVhen asked to comment on the idea of a \Campus Center,\ Thomas D' Aridrea, the Vice President for Academic Affairs and serving as Vice President of the Campus Planning and Priorities Committee, ex- plained that both President Morris and he were very en- thusiastic over the idea. Upon elaborating on the concept he noted that it would be most bene-ficial to the entire campus community. Once the center was establiShed, he went on, it would house a large dining service, strategically located in the center of campus. Dining for students would be restricted to the Campus Center and West Dining Hall, with Hale House reserved for banquet dinners . Built as an extension of Car- negie Hall, it would overlook Jackson's Gardens and perhaps provide for semi-private dining for small organizations. The second major purpose that the Center would serve would be to house a \decent bookstore.'' According to D'Andrea, such a bookstore would have not only textbooks, but also room for people to browse. In other words, he explained, it would sell \more books than t-shirts.\ By having the bookstore moved from the Nott Memorial he went on, there would be no traffic along the central campus roadways and the Administration would be able to tW'n the college_ back into a pedestrian campus. The proposed Center would, in addition, have space designed for a central service for mail instead of the separate services that the current system now consists of. Presently, the system is made up of a mail service in back of North College, a student mailroom in Carnegie Hall, and a package room housed next door to the pizza pub. By having all three services located in one central postal facility, the mail service would be more efficient and, according to D'Andrea, it could also expand its services. The Campus Center, if con- structed, would have large facilities in which to have the Pub, and it would also have areas in which students could \lounge.\ D'Andrea noted that there would be \remarkable utilization of a building of that type\ for it would improve the traffic flow into Carnegie. \You don't feel like you're entering a place where people congregate,'' he commented when describing the current situation. When asked when students can expect to see movement on a project of this type, D'Andrea admitted that he could give no definite answer. He explained that a project of this magnitude could cost as much as 3.5 million dollars. He also remarked that he hopes to see progress on this project within the next five years.

Parking For Handicapped By DAVE FITZGERALD Staff As most people that try to park their car on campus already know, parking spaces are hard to find. Currently, some people are upset that spaces that cars were previously allowed to park in are now reserved for the cars of the handicapped.. They have found that even ifthe spaces are empty all the time, only certain designated cars may park in the spaces. · According to Christpher Chadwick, Assistant Director of the Security and Safety Department, the number of parking spaces for the han- dicapped has increased from four to nineteen over the sununer, but that overall they are only a minimal number compared to the number for everyone else. He does not feel that the reserved spaces ate taking over the parking lots. The .number of spaces reserved for the handicapped will increase as more buildings become more accessible. For example, when South College Dormitory was made accessible for the handicapped, more parking spaces had to be reserved, so that the han= dicapped using the building would have places to park. If the person living in the donn had to park a distance from the building it could present a great amount of difficulty. A tnajor problem that has arisen with the signs is that people do not pay any attention to them. \It has been e~pty for the last week,\ is not a valid excuse. The signs must be obeyed and the spaces have to be available for those who need them on a twenty-four hour a day basis. Another problem that is serious and costly, is that the signs designating reserved parking are being pulled out. Chadwick stresses that this should not be done because the signs will be replaced, l;>ut in the meantime the handicapped that need the spaces are being deprived of them. · To end all stories to the contrary, it should be stressed that only a small number of Send all questions for 11 Ask the Expert\ to Box 2571 spaces are reserved, there are people on campus that need and use the spaces, and anyone that parks in the spaces that does not neett them will be fined. Anyone that · needs the use of the reserved parking spaces should · contact security. On another topic, Chadwick would like all students with cars to realize that with the new curbing in front of Carne~e, there can 'be no parking. The road must remain 'clear because it is a fire lane. If you park you car in front of Caru negie you will be in danger of receiving a ticket and having your car Jpwed away: In short it is advisable for people with cars to stay out of reserved parking spaces. and not to park on the roads on Campus.

They play only one day a week for sixteen weeks a year and now they are talking about going on strike. This is an issue thatmust 'be tackled. n :it continues to be fwnbled between the players and owners the game will.end in a standoff With ho .football, no beer, no betting, and a national pastime will have gone the way of the Chrysler Corporation, the stagecoach, Larry Kanusher, and Dave Packer. So what is the answer? I have spent endless hours consulting the top executives of the. three networks and the traffic and pet court and have come Up with the solution. Follow along with me as I solve a case that is just too big for The People's Court. 1. The football players and owners . obvioUsly don't care about the fans or else they wouldn't use such difficult words as \55 percent· of the gross\ and \collective bargaining.\ 2. . Football is played primarily for those watching on TV and not the losers in the stands. · 3~ Football and television will continue to earn revenue as long as games, n() matter when they took place, are broadcast on TV. 4. The LQ. of th'e average footballfan can never be higher than the number of his favorite player. Therefore, taking the preceding facts into account the only reasonable and sen:;ible solution is to broadcast games· from previous years. As everyone knows, all football games look alike.. Think how great it will be to watch superstars from previous years who are now either retired or selling insurance. I know !hat everyone out there Is thinking, \Matt who in tbei.r right mind would watch an old football game?\ Well, old TV shows are shown over and over again. · How many times have you watched your favorite episode of M+A+S+H? I say let both the players and the owners go out on strike! In the words of Chrysler Chairman Lee Iacocca, ''If you can find a better game on TV, watch it!\ -This is Matt Nankin with one man's opinion. · -_Philo~ophy Forum: Plato's Mother?

Several activities planned in• clude a speaker series and a fihn series. An LE.F. Grant has been awarded specifically to the ,Forum. It will enable the Forum to present ap- proximately 10 exciting films with philosophical themes in the next two terms. Films such as Crime and Punishment, The Strapger, The Confm;mist and IGng of Hearts are being cop- sidered. Possible speakers include folk singer and political activist; Tom Paxton, and also the author of Godel, Escher, Bach. Plato's mother has also been suggested, but as of yet, we haven't been able to locate her. Plans for activities are still flexible. Activities need not deal directly with philosophy.

Page 6 OONC01t1JlENSIS, Octob~t 7, 1988 iii . . THE ARTS Record Rev.iew: Hudson Rock, Hr. Rolls? BY VADIM E. Staff lt happened last Monday. I wasn't really doing anything, you know, just hanging out instde Carnegie. Suddenly, someone hit my head. with a \ very heavy object. I woke up inside the ·coneordieDBis office, tied to a chair. All around me t~ere were people munching plZzas, \He is awake, you guys, it was only a mild contusion.\ I'd know that voice anywhere- the sinister R.R. is at it again. There was no point in trying to cover up the results of my latest inv.estigation. I'm sorry, but I just don't like compilations like \From the City that brought you absolutely nothing\ and \This Is Boston, Not L.A.\ because it seems that every two-bit band can put in their two cents. \Hudson Rock\ is hardly any different in this respect. This compilation of 15 Albany area bands boasts well known bands such as Blotto and the Fear of Strangers on one hand, but also presents other less known acts such as the Standing Offer and the Capltle. Only original bands were selected, which saved this reviewer's ears from a lot of trite noise. This compilation consists of \new wave\ bands only, ranging from power pop to hardcore punk. The local sultans of swing, Blotto, open up the album with a tune called \Lightning Strikes.''\' No, this is not the same \Lightning Strikes\ the Clash do on \Sandinistat'' The Blotto song comes complete with silly lyrics like \Every boy needs a girl he can trust,, and a castrati backup vocal. This is very typical Blotto stuff. Somebody please get Blotto a date for the senior prom. B The guy who put this album together must have a great sense of humor to follow Blotto with the A.D.'s \I wanna be your boyfriend - What Do You Say?\ Whoever wrote t~is masterpiece was really looking A Novel for a rhyme - ''I wanna be your boyfriend- What do you say - I wanna be your boyfriend no matter what you say- you know l'~ go~a get you anyways. But wa1t, 1t gets better! - Gonna come to your house and give you a big surprise.Cute,ha? I hear that rape is \in.\ this year. C- By thts time I was prepared fot what was about to come. Tbe Morons probably escaped from the same juvenile home that the A.D.'s escaped from. 'l'he Morons •· contribution to \Hudson Rock\ comes ... in the form of ''Gimme.\ Can you guess exactly what the man wants? \I know what r want when lsee you -and if you don't give it- I'll take it.\ Real nice. This guy should save .his breath for his inflatable girlfriend. C- I was a bit confused, trying to figure out exactly what the Rocldn' Dakotas had in mind in \About Girls\ \Hey Sally on the comer - would you do me the honor.\ Well, at least they have the rockabilly somtd. B The Fear of Strangers change the subject a little with \Ssppy For the Guy.\ Now it's a homy girl going after a guy. -I'm sappy for the guy - he's a real cutie - Nevertheless, \Sappy For the Guy\ develops beyond the two-dimensional structures of the previous cuts. You. can really feel how hard she tries to get his attention - in vain. This is by far the strongest song on this side. , A Standing Offer successfully caricatures the eating habits of Americans in \Carnivore. This piece features a rather amusing chant, featuring all your favorite foods. However, at three minutes and twenty seconds, this one is about three minutes too long. JS.. The s~nd side opens very well with the \1-2-3-4-5-6\ from The Verge. -Forging ideals into action - slamming our backs against the wall- The song The Reichstag Plot With The Relchstag Plot: A Novel, Richard Henry Owens has created a taut, compelling tale of power and intrigue set in Washington, D.C. in 1984. An F.B.I. agent, David King. discovers a plot to seize power aimed at the Presidency and the Constitution. His investigation of the theft of paintings from the National Gallery of Art begins David's odyssey into terror. Ultimately. not Gnly David's life but the fate of American democracy hang~ in the balance. A galaxy of intriguing characters inhabits this ex- plosive thriller. There are George Dattow, Secr~ary of the Treasury, ruthless and iron- willed; ian Hamilton, liberal senator from New York and a leading presidential contender; Angie Duquesne, . sopl'iisticated and cunning, an aid~ to Senator Hamilton; Vice-President Malcohn Harris, whose key , assistant has ties to both Senator Hamilton and Secretary Datrow; Tracie Berryfield, blond, alluring, a rising young administrator at the National Gallery. A coup in Mexico adds international dimensions to this novel that strikes haunting similarities to contemporary national and world issues. In 1984, the American economy rests on unstable foundations.· TV news reports warn: \You can't see it, but it's happening-now.\ David King fights to prevent ''the un- thinkable\: the overthrow of the United States govermnent. Heed the warning: Read The Reichstag Plot. About the Author Richard Henry Owens was born in 1947 in Hudson, New York. He received a bachelor's degree from Manhattan College, a master's degree in history from Old Dominion University, and is completing his doctorate in U.S. history at the University of Maryland. Mr. Owens has served as an officer in the U.S. Navy and has been a history instructor and A,lumni Mfairs Officer at the University of Maryland. Currently, he is the Director of Alumni Relations at , the Catholic UniversitJ of Amerfca in WB$hington, D.C. Mr. Owens serves on several boards and is president ot the West La11rel (Maryland) Civic Association. He has been a volunteer for the American Cancer Society. He lives with his wife, Phyllis, and their two children in Laurel, Maryland. turns into an all~ut call to arms. Driving, reientless _,guitar.., pumping bass and non- stop drums combine to produce an excellent cut. A The \Weekenders\ sound like they can only play two ~y.s out of seven, and I guess they recorded their \Power Surge\ dUl'ing the other five days. ''Power Surge\ features a riff stolen from \Not Fade Away.\ Boo. c I \sorta\ like bands that only know three .chords (Uke the Ramoues, Sex Pistols, Clash, etc), so lt should be .no surprise that the rather nihilistic Extras find a welcome reception on my turntable. \This Generation Doesn't Judge Anybody\ is a rea~y nasty attack. -We obey God and he is. dead- A bit simplistic, but pretty honest~ B+ Tbe X-istentfals follow suit with \This Heart Won't .Let Me Go,'' combining visions of. gloom with a stream of desperation, weaving a web of nightmarish neurotics. Not bad. B Lumpen Proles are respresented by a ditty called ''You Can't Forget.\ I can very easily forget this one. Spare your stylus. C, Capitle's ''Fun\ is thirty seconds of primo noise ala :Black Flag. I wouldn't let my pet tarantula listen to this. This cut is a perfect gift for someone you dislike particularly. (I already have 20 copies, thanx). D The Crude definitely challenged the Capltle for the Worst Song on the Album Award, but they came in close second. Crude's \Vacation\ (copped from the Sex P's \Holidays in the Smt\) is simply atrocious. C- The closing song on Hudson Rock is the Young Reptiles' \Cast Iron Arm.\ This piece was a welcome surprise, featuring a 60's guitar riff and a taped bar brawl. This cut is the wiimer in the We are Dwnb and We Know it category. No more, no less. B+ Mark Rust ''Live Rust'' Mark Rust, much to tne delight of those who saw his performance last spring, is returning to the- Union College . Coffeehouse this Friday night in the Cabaret Room at 8:30 p,m. The key part of Mark's performance is energy. In the course of an evening he gives out an incl!edible amomtt! His fluency on many instruments (guitar, banjo, piano, fiddle, dulcimer), along with his refreshingly clear vocal ability create a varied and exciting ·evening of music. He draws on many common life experiences and reflects them in songs and stories ranging from the wide-eyed fascination of a child to _the cynicism of an old. bum. He'll sing of social outrage, and later, weave a beautifully lyrical love ballad. He believes in the music and possesses the magic to let you believe too. His musical background has covered traditional folk, rock and roll, . commercial jazz, songwriting, classical, and aU are drawn in over a night. And after it's all over, you're left with that rare and pleasant feeling that you have received something very special and lovingly given! Mark's early performing was with his fanlily. With his parents, brother and sister (musicians all), and oc- casionally his grandmother who isa fine yodeler, he performed at concerts, festivals, cof- feehouses, and benefits. They sang Swiss yodeling songs, American and English folk songs, some .of Mark's songs, and other contemporary songs the family enjoyed. Since he has been on his own, Mark has clearly established himselt on the folk scene in the US and in Canada. For those of you who missed his last per- formance, you're ih for a wonderful evening of en- tertainment!

Kle~n:: j Pre-Med Goes Comic As we all know, a career in acting-entertaininent was not a \legitimate\ pursuit for a middle class boy, born February . 8th, 1942, in the .Bronx, who attended DeWitt Clinton High.School. So, Ro~rt Klein entered Alfred University as ... right on - a premedical student. Klein did su&stitute teaching to earn a living.· He kept his art alive at the Bitter End ~d Cafe Wha hootenannY nights. Anti -then, in March, 1965, Klein successfully auditioned for the famour Chicago im .. provis.ational compa·ny, \Second City.\ He spent the slngle most important year of his career in Chicago. ''I learned everything ..... discipline, improvisation, and the art of working up a comic routine. It matured me as a perfonner and gave me a feeling of control· of the audience.\ ground for young .comtcs, a club called The Improvisation·, and was to spend three years getting his thing together. At 'nle Improv he was pick~ out by Rollins & Joffe, the people who managed Nichols & May and Woody Allen. And in June, 1967, Klein'scomic star rose for all to see. Two more Broadway shows followed ..- ''Morning, Noon and Nigllt\ and \New Faces of 1968.\ It· didn't matter th!!t his dad was a good livfng room comedian and his mom a show biz fan, and that he was always \entertl:\ining the relativ~s.\ The .pieces started to fall mto place, however, when he joined the college acting company and· became \the Rod Steiger -of Alfred U. ;, He. graduatecl with a B.A. in Political Science and History, but · his drama professors t<!ld ·his father that young Robert should pursue -an acting eareer. With that ~hind him,. Klein returned to New York as part of the improvisational \Second City.\ When \Second City\ closed, Klein was chosen .for Mike Nichols' Broadway musical,. \Apple Tree.\ It was while ·he was on the road in Boston that he turned on a TV set in . his hotel room, and realized that he had a lot more going for him than all of Merv's guest comedians. Since that time he has ap- peared on and hosted the most prestigious TV shows, such as Carsol}. '~Saturday Nlght; '' Cavett, Griffin, etc. He has appeared . in eight movies, in- cluding \The Landlord,\ \The Pursuit of Happiness,\ \The Owl and The Pussycat,'' \Rivals \Hooper \The Bell Jar,'' and \A Secret Space\ for PBS. In 1970. he starred in l'Comedy Tonight,'' the CBS Summer replacement for Glen Campbell's show, and which was highly acclaimed for its originality. Speakers' Forum and Union Entertainment bring you .

His fitst album, \Child of the Fifties;' (on Brut Records), proved to be the medium that brought Klein to the vast audience his talents deserve, and, in addition, won a Grammy Award Nomination as the be~ comedy albwn of the year. His second albwn, ''Mind Over Matter,'' released in March, 1974, contained a new level of political critique and social .comedy and also was nominated for a Grammy. \New Teeth\ was released in 1975 on the Epic label. Klein is unashamedly in- telligent and literate, . with a precise memory for the most subtle details about people and situatio11s. In his fOmedy he ' takes on anything, from lun• chroom food in the . public schools circa 1953, to the president of a major oil com- pany, hilariously stripping them down to a wonderful embarrassment of truth . Probably no single event is more' indicative of Klein's success than his first sold-out Carnegie Hall concert, \The First Annual Robert Klein Reunion.\ For nearly two hours he devastated his audience with his high-energy comedy and comment. As a grande finale he performed two songs with a back-up rock group. The audience, after a stunning standing ovation, went home wiping -the tears of laughter from their eyes. The critics raved. And Robert Klein af- firmed his place as a major personality in contemporary entertainment. The -'-'Second\ and \Third Annual Robert Klein Reunions were also ~tanding room only, and the Reunion has become a yearly event. Klein was the first performer on the precedent-shattering Home Box Office \On Location\ series and has done three one-man shows for HBO. While recording the \New Teeth\ albwn, Klein was once again ·summoned by the Yale Drama School; only this time it was by the noted. director, Robert Brustein, and the offer was to teach a course in comedy. Reluctantly, Robert turned the.offer down in order to devote his full energies to splitting the sides of his adoring public. Yale's loss is our gain. Robert returned to Broadway in grand style wi~h · a Tony nomination performance in the hit musical, \They're Playing Our Song.\ He then co-wrote and starred in two NBC comedy specials for 1981, followed by a starring role in Columbia Pictures' \Nobody's Perfect/' slated for a Swnmer, 1981, release.

'Pag.e 10 CONCO~DIENSIS} October 7,, 1c98B Founckrl al llnian Calltg~ 1877 ----~------- -----~~--- Subversive Threat The adage still holds true--a picture is worth a thousand· words. Cartoonist Dave Neiblum portrays our trusted man in the Wllite House as the Pinocchio of Politics. Rea,gan is not only a master of rhetoric, but a devious political strategist. In the slick arena of Capitol Hill politics, it is imperative to keep an eye on our hard-fought \gains\ in financial aid. The battle is far from over. To quote the Office of. Financial Aid's newsletter, · ·the Reagan Administration's primary tactic is ''delay.'' The Education Department, for example, is stalling its release of necessary needs analysis formulas for '83-'84 in the hopes that Congress will pass more limiting criteria. In other words, Washington is waiting for the usual post- excitement apathy to slip us a mickey. We will not drop our guards. We refuse to accept higher interest rates for Guaranteed Student Loan.s. No way in hell will we agree to further reductions in Pell Grants. But. it is time to put our proverbial money where our mouths are. Number one--follow the budget resolution process. Number Two--act upon any encroachments by the enemy. By now we have all learned to write forceful letters. If not, a form letter is available from the Office of Financial Aid. Number Three--use your vote hi the November elections intelligently. · No Get Grades The question of \athletics or· academics\ has plagued many a modern academic institution. Thankfully, it appears that the College has handled this hot potato with grace. But, with student admissions e_xpected to drop in the near future, the temptation to sacrifice scholarly achievement for needed tUition revenues or worse, sports prowess, is great. · There is no denying that athletics fortifies both the body and mind seven ways. One cannot ignore the signiDcance of a winning program to aiding admissions recruitment. Certainly, alumni enjoy seeing RPI trounced on Homecoming Weekend, thus indirectly affecting the Endowment. But, future policy makers must keep in mind the fine · line between academic integrity and · bankruptcy. Strict enforcement of the College's Basic Recruitment Principles is a must. Of great importance is adherence to Principle No. 6: \academic authority is to control intercollegiate athletic policy.'' There are definite disadvantages to being known as the USC of Division III.

W~ would like to sincerely appologize for having cancelle4 on such short notice our scheduled performance at Cabaret on .9-30-82. We were as eager as some of you were to party last Thursday night, and · had even worked up some . special acoustic music for the show as a treat.. However, a misunderstanding with and change in policy on the part of · the Cabaret organization forced us to reconsider performing. As a band that plays electric rock and roll, we needed to supplement the Cabaret sound system in order to audibly amplify the vocals without distorting the sound or threatening to overload their existing systems (for the purpose of providing a clean, clear sound: not with the ifltent of plUlcturing eardrums). This has been a common practice in attempting . to ''mellow•-• Cabaret this year. - As a professional band, we work to obtain a tight, even sound and have learned through experience what is reqtlired to · ·obtain it. We felt that neither we nor our audience should be short-changed on this or any level in our performances (would you ask a guitarist to perform with only three strings?), and thus chose not to perform under unsatisfactory conditions. · It is too bad that Cabaret is moving away from its ·Original concept of providing alternative forms of entertainment to the solo piano - guitar vocal oriented acts - I refer you to a reprint . of an article ·about Cabaret from 1972 in last week's Concordien~is on page 10. The . best Cabarets have been when the place was boppin to the beat of a band with dancing in the aisles and people left the show with a feeling of having really partied. We sincerely hope the Cabaret organization will -reconsider thier new policies that wiU restrian campus band.s from putting on a top quality show or from playing there at all. Perhaps some of you (musicians and listeners alike) who agree . with these snetiments might express your feelings to the staff of Cabaret.

Goldberg COMMENTARIES Committmeilts -By NORMAN BIRNBACH Features Editor When I first came to Union Iast·year, I was not vety hBPRf· There were aspect$ of t:llis college that I did not like very much, This was partly due to my having gone to the same school for twelve years. It was hard adjusting to the new situation. At my high school, I knew who to go to ·if I had a problem, who was responsible, and who to avoid. When I got here,. I was overwhelmed. So that l would become less overwhehned, l began joining organizations. I figured that if I got involved, I would at least have a handle on something going on around here. I joined the paper .for a number of reasons, one of which was to find out more about ca.mpus. life. It worked: The Ijtore I got involved, the less upset I was. I began to feel more at home at Union. And the more at home I felt, .the more I wanted to do something to help out, After all, this is now my home for nine months a year. Because Union is home to me, I have tried to help improve it. Last year I wrote a series of articles on the social life here, along with some ideas for changes. · I wrote about an incident that happened two weeks ago with the same idea in mind-to improve life at Union College. Specifically our Security Department. I wrote about that incident, describing what I. remembered. What I remembered and what I wrote described a security force that would have made the Keystone Kops look competent. When I m:ote the article I was both angry and tired. To be truthful, Security is better than I wrote. Still, there seem to be problems with Security. In my article last week, I had intended to point out what seemed to me to be one of .those problems: a not overly- efficient force. Now it appears to be a problem with procedure and a question of being too self- conscious of possible liability. But because I care about life at Union College, I plan to do more than just criticize Security, despite what some may think. That would be too easy. Instead, what I plan to do is find_ out more about Security, and see what may need im~ provement. No security force can .be completely efficient. What I want to do is help, not hurt. What I want to do is make Union a better place. It comes down to what President Ken· nedy said at his inaugeration: \Ask not what your country can do for you. Ask what you can do for your country.'' Well, I've asked, and have an answer. But is anyone willing to listen. A Waste of Time - - By MARTIN SANDS Yesterday, I was sitting in the Skellar with two friends when I .suddenly realized that this is my senior year. Wow, I felt freat, almost as if I was at- tempting to climb Mount Everest and was a days climb from its peak. Yes, a great feeling. My feelings of relief from finiShing most of my requirements and for com- pleting my major left me very content. Well, I contiraued to dwell on my past three years at Union. l recalled. that during my first tenn at Union I went into shock over the amount of studying that was required. The · workload seemed impossible. Yet, I got through · by the slightest margin. And, ironically, instead of eeling proud, I felt as though I was illiterate. My first year GPA was nothing to boast of. However, there was one aspect of my first year, (and all three years for that matter) that h~lped me to partially justify my poor performance. In short, I did not waste my money on courses that were blatantly worthless. Of course I realize that an easy course for one person is often a difficult course for another. These are not to what I am referring. Briefly speaking, I feel sad for those students who decide against taking a course because a professor is regarded as dif- ficult. Consequently, this school seems to have conformed to this growing trend by providing more and more ridiculous courses that attract students who are looking for grades and not an education. There's nothing wrong with taking an easy course that you may enjoy, but, do pot construe this with taking totally inapplicable courses that you realize are a waste of time and money. (Unless, of course, you feel that the professor will commit suicde if you do not take his course.) For instance, last year my roommate took a course offered by the psychology department. It was called the \Psychology of Creativity\ with Professor Calabria. My roommate rarely. attended and there were few, if any, requirements. In turn, he received a B+. Well\ his parents were vety rpoud and the ignorance of his professor was confirmed. But, the question remains: What did he spend $800 for? TUTORS AVAILABLE Having problems with a course?

p OONOOBDIEN81BJ October \1 1981 'Sesame Street' Freshmen ress-F 9r ... Succes . (CPS)- Time flies when you're watching TV. It's already time for college's first Sesame Street class. This year's freshmen were five years old-the eldest of the show's original target audience- -when Sesame Street bowed in the fall of 1969. Back then the shOw was a bold experiment in combining education and entertainment. The goal was to help three-to- five-year-olds prepare for school by tea.ching basic cognitive skills and social behavior through slick television techniques. The result, many experts said, would revolutionize education as the generations Of show-taught kids moved up, forcing educators to re-align curricula to accommodate them. - But except for some fond memories, this year's freshmen aren't sure Sesame Street has made tllat much of a difference. Their teachers, moreover, haven't done much to alter college courses to allow for their earlier educational development. ''Let's put it this way: college faculty aren't ripping up their syllabi waiting for these kids to enroll at college,\ says Carl Fessler, an education professor at the University of Alaska who has studied television's effect on education. Fessler beh'eves most of the show's impact is confined to lower grades, and that it never rippled upward in spite of educators' best hopes. · The show has done \creative and exciting things\ says Helene Gerstein, a professional development specialist with the National Education Association, but it's had little effect on even elementary ~ schpol curricula. Some teachers have added extra programs because of the increased \reading readiness\ Sesame Street provided, but they haven't been able to change their methods of teaching reading and writing,. Gerstein says. It's a far cry from the starry- eyed visions that entr8Ilced Sesame Street fans when the show debuted. Common Cause Director John Gardner, then a recent ex- Secretary of Health, Education & Welfare, saw the show as a harbinger of \a radical upgrading of ,educational QlUility on· a massive scale.'' ''Anyone who doesn't r~ogniZe these breakthroughs as the first limping trO()ps, the vanguard, of a mighty host is just out of touch,\ he exulted. . Children's Television Workshop (CTW), the show's prOducer., does have an im- pressive array of studies showing how the show has had dramatic effects on pre-school and kindergarten children. But the effects never radiated much higher, Fessler says. \The show has probably helped elementary and pre- school teachers move the kids along a little faster,\ he says. \When you get to second grade, it just lets teachers do the things second~grade teachers used to be. able to. do before academic standards . and performances fell, By, third grade, the effect is probably gone.'' \You have to wonder if kids remember the sbow by the time they get to college,\ he says. They remember. \I always watched Sesame Street,\ recalls Lauren Owens,. a Pittsford, N.Y. 18-year-old now starting at the University of Michigan. \And when I went to first grade I enjoyed it because I felt like r had an edge. I already knew a lot. I wish I was as confident about college!' \I'll never forget my Cookie Monster doll· or Muppet fing• puppets,\ muses one UM pre- med major. \I watched Sesame Street every day. Those guys were the best friend a kid could have.\ If Sesame Street's f.!rst ~liege class hasn't been the cutting edge of a . \radical upgrading\ it hasn't been the agent of destruction others foresaw. \'My uncle used toteD me if I watcbed Sesame Street, I'd grow up retarded,'' .remembers M1chlgan freshman Laura SchUltz at her orientation. ''CoUege students today have been deeply affected by television,\ observes Bar bra Morris of Michigan's English Composition Board. ''It's their primary language.' • · The much.;.publicized decline in traditional reading and writing skillS over the last 15 years is often blamed on TV, · \but one can't point a finger at televish)n,''· Morris argues. ·\rt's a matrix of factors. It has just as much to de with the fact there'.s been overctowding iJi the classrooms. Not enough has been dcme to use television to promote literacy as Sesame Stteet has done.•~ And if Sesame Street's in- fluence has been less than expected, some blame must go to other · groups for not im- proving other children's shows. Kid-vid, says Dave Connell, Sesame Street's first executive producer, \has improved a little, but not as much as it should have. It was just a cosmetic effect, really; a little less violent, a little less racist, but a lot of it is stm drek.\ \The fact the networks are doing so little for children is a major disaster in American televisi«n,'' adds P.eggy Charren, presidentof Action .for Children's Television. The \anti-regulatory fever 1n Washington'' discourages kids' programming, she says. Sesame Street seems ·secure anyway. \I don't have a crystal ball,\ says CTW Information Director· Frances Kaufman, \but it's pretty likely Sesame Street will still be on the air 14 seasons from now.\ (CPS:) ..... David ·Zimmer suc- cessfully worked his way through business grad school by dressing his fellow students for success. Zimmer has sold about 40 'iB· School Suits\ to fellow students at Carnegie-.Mellon University's graduate business school, which primes Zimmer's customers by holding a dress-for-success forum each fall. Zinuner d~clines to say how much he's .grossed .from the venture, except to say, ''We've done very nicely.\ He dQeS it by bUYing the clothesfromhisunele, a 30-year veteran of the clothes manUfacturing industry. Zimmer dist:.ounts them to draw ·customers. \We are of- fering $25().;$300 suits at one-hal.f to.one-third off. Business school placement Director Ed Mosier declines to say how Zimmer-outfitted students did 1n the job market this year, demurring, \From a recruiter's standpoint, r don't think they would. ask who the tailor was.'' Some wouldn't even ask about how the applicant dresses. There are those who dismiss the dress-for-success urgiiigs as a mere placement office fad. \The prescriptions given in ACROSS DOWN 1 Part of HRH 1 Jump 4 Scatter 2 !3efore 9 Haggard 3 Harvest heroine 4 Band of color 12 Galena, for 5 Outstanding one 6.

Most Ukely, you can get by with something for $50. Zimmer's customers are undaunted. Zimmer, who graduated into .a job selling wines to foreign countries, has kept B.School Suits alive as a sideline, and plans to hire t1 sales rep this month to outfit the Class of '83.

Students and faculty at Tates Creek High School originally admitted the two electronic wonders in hopes of · making e~a money for the school while giving students an en- tertaining way to spend their free time. College officials have already found the video games ex- tremely lucrative. In an average campus arcade, each game can rake in $200-$300 a week, according to various estimates. At the University of Arizona, students plunked in over one million quarters-some $280,000- ·at the 35-game arcade in the University Center. The school's profit was $150,000. The Universities of Dlinois, Washington, Cincinnati and Tennessee, to name a few, also report fiscal success with the machines. \But I haven't seen any evidence to prove they have anything to do with education,\ dissents Dr. Guy Potts, Lexington's school superin- tendent who ordered the two machines out of Tates High. In addition, Potts says, \based on my experience and knowledge of the problems we've had in the schools with discipline and tardiness, I felt the games would be fairly disruptive.\ Some psychologists have even warned the games can foster anti-social behavior--from increased violence to alien- tation and withdrawal-among children· who play them ex- cessively. One expert claims the colorful and pulsating lights on game boards can pitch players into seizures, comas and cardiac arrest. Brownsville, Texas officials recently complained teenagers are sniffing painted 9uarters to . get high at local v1deo game arcades. But so far, none of the dozens , of colleges that have installed the games has reported such side effects; In fact, some college union officials. claim the TYPING w - Karen's Secretariai Aervices KAREN REMBERT Pickup & Delivery 707 BRANOVWiNI!AYI!Nlll!

A California physician, for one, says the games keep kids active and alert, as opposed to watching television, a passive activity. Optometrist John Rogers prescribes video games to children with· coordination problems, claiming the games can improve hand-eye coor- dination. palm 36 Claimant 39 Greek letter 40 Main, for one 41 Large cask 43 NFL score 44 Jolson 45 Bower 47 Greenish- blue 50 Turkish regi- ment 51 Night bird 54 Witch · 55 Gemstone~ 56 Sta.lemate 5·7 Western Indian 58 Evils 59 Airline abbr. ~ lnfortnolional m,eeting for ALL Club Presidents and Activity Leaders with members of the Student Forum and Administration ' .

In a compromise last year, the NCAA agreed to chaAAe the it divides up TV revenues to re-align its divisions so fewer schools are eligible to share those revenues. Soon after the comproinise, however; the universities of- Georgia and Oklahoma sued the NCAA anyway, saying they wanted the right to negotiate their own contracts. In his decision, U.S. District Judge Juan Burciaga agreed to let individual schools make their own TV deals. Burciaga said the NCAA violated anti- trust laws in monopolizing broadcast rights for its member schools. This year's NCAA TV deal with ABC and CBS was worth $264 million. Burciaga's ruling voided thaf contract, though all sides ex- pect a stay will probably keep it in effect through this season. Both the NCAA. and network officials refuse to comment on the ruUng. Both camps, however, say the ruling's mid- season timing could cause \incomprehensible\ chaos. ''Right now, we're concerned with getting a stay on the deciston,\ say!l C. Dennis Ct:yder of-- the NCAA's programming department . \The majority of our member institutions are somewhat surprised that the action came in the middle of the 1982 season. I guess the timing is the big problem right· now;'' ''The main problem. is tbat it's right in the middle of ev.erythi:ng.,'' echoes Donn Berstein, NCAA media director , at ABC. ''We're just taking it a -.+ . t t' \ o~ep a a l.me. ''The decision may throw the .general tel4;lcast season into some state of disarray.'' allows Kurt Ockershauser, a lawyer for Oklahoma,· \but the NCAA ~d the networks and anyone folloWing the issue should have $een it coming.\ Ockershauser says the real issue is. not . timing, but \whe.thet member institutions of the NCAA have the sole property rights' to their television broadcasts~ The court ruled that the NCAA did not control them, nor could the NCAA require as membership tbat the institution sign over their rights.\ As for; this season's disrup- tions, \life is full of surpriSing disruptions. No one at this point knows how much disruptiqn, if any, this decision will cause.\ . Judge Burciaga similarly commented in his ruling that \the wound which has today been suffered 6y the NCAA. is a self-inflicted one.'' The NCAA, he said, had \strayed too far from· the purposes for which it was organized. It would be un- seemly for the court, having found an overt violation of the anti-trust laws, to allow the violation to continue for even a single day, let alone for the rest of the season.\ .. ' 0 . .• . Test Scores on the Rise (CPS) •• Standardized test scores .for colleg~bound seniors rose agaln after a 19-year decline, but educators are still uncertain what caused the tw()oo decade decline or why this year's scores suddenly went up. Still, an abundance of theories has s.urfaced to explain the fluctuation. They range from the schoolS' re.emphasis on \back to basics'' classes to the banning of above-ground nu~lear testing. When test scores leveled out one y~pr ago, experts were hopeful then that it signaled an upturn in the long-running decline. Performances on a variety of stan·dardiZed tests--the Scholastic .Aptitude Test (SAT), the Test of Written EngliSh, and t!le 15-subject College. Board Achievement Tests-indicate test scores may finally be on the path to recovery, the College Board reports. \This year's rise, combined With last year's holding steady, is a welcome sign for educators, parents, and students that serious effort~ by the nation's schools and their students to improve the quality of education are taking effect,\ says George Hanford, president of the College Board. \There are several signs we think are encouraging,\ notes Fred Moreno, spokesman for College Board. \Teachers have been reporting for some time that students are more in- terested in academic subjects and in good grades. And we know that the class of '82 had more math and physical science courses than ever before. Since most of the tests deal with these subjects, we think students were better prepared to answer the questions in these areas.\ Schools have _also \tightened up in terms of · basic academics\ says Or. ·Larry Loesch, president of the Association for Measurement and Evaluation in Guidance. \I think there's a growing emphasis on traditional academics-math, science, and English--from the ''back to basics' movement, n Loesch says. \In the 60s:and 70s, we had a more liberal attitude towards education. But as times have gotten tougher we've moved back to traditional courses.\ Not .everyone is convinced better education is responsible for the ~iSing test scores. \The decline In SAT scores which began in 1963 can be directly correlated with the beginning of above-ground nuclear testing,\ theorizes Ernest Stemglass, professor of radiology at the University of. Pittsburgh. Several years ago Sternglass predicted this year's rise in test scores based on tile ending of above-ground testing ln 1963. And, he. predicts, '\there will be an up.-turn in scores for at least the next generation, except in areas very close to dirty, leaky nuclear reactors.\ Sternglass claims that mothers who were pregnant between the years of above- ground nuclear testing-roughly 1945 through 1963-gave birth to children who were mUdly contaminated by radioactive iodine. Those children mark the beginning and apparent end of the 19-:year slump in SAT scores. _ \The kids who take the SAT a~e typically 17 .. to-19-years- old,\ Sternglass exp!ains. \Children bom in 1945 wot.ild have taken the SAT in 1963, the beginning of the SAT score decline. And children born in 1963, when the last above- ground explosion took place in the U.S., would have taken the test in 1980 or '81. ThiS year's rise in test scores took place because it is the beginning of the first group of kids not ex- posed to the radioactive 'odin \ 1 e. Sternglass says the iod.lne causes a mild fonn of retar· dation called hypothyroidism, which isn't actually identified Wltil the children are tested in high school on examinations such as the SAT. \I really can't conunent on a theory like that,\ says College Board's Moreno. \For now, I think it's fair to say we really don't know for sure what single event or events are responsible for the increase.\ Shirt Tales· Campus Digest News Service Competition between designer labels has been going· on for a couple of years. Flip- ping through any magazine geared towards fashion, you'll see page after page of designer brands touting themselves as the ' 1 one to wear/' But now a different kind of battle is beginning to take shape. It's the battle of the alligator versus the polo player. And Ralph Lauren's polo player is really beating out the alligator at the cash register. Express Call The alligators have been around for over 30 years. Rene Lacoste, a French tennis champion of the 20's, was the inspiration for the original Lacoste shirt wit.h the funny green alligator on the front. The shirts caught on in the U.S. among the golfing and country club set. Many male golfers really appreciated the extra long tail on the shirt, and the comfortable fit. The polo players cost more than the Izod Lacoste shirts, but seems to be outselling the alligator regardless of the price difference. Could it be that preppies everywbere are tired of the little green critter on their chest and want some \new action\? Or have they already bought every single color of Izod shirt and need to move on to something else to start collecting? Maybe the polo player is more \classy\ than the creepy green reptile. For those who can't see paying the high-dollar prices that an Izod or Lauren shirt costs, there are many other choices in the field. Penney's sells a fox, Munsingwear has a penguin, and Sears and Roebuck offers a fire-breathing dragon, just to name a few. And their prices are much cheaper.

Page 16 OONCORDIEN81S, October 7~ 198B 'Silent Protests~ After Beirut Aging Slowed? (CPS)-Rob, normally \sort of active\ in Jewish student groups at Oregon State, is staying away from those groups for the time being. . Sufian Essawi, a Palestinian student at Pittsburgh, is \spending all the time I can with my (Arab) brothers, to make open our cause, to explain ourselves.\ Their' divergent reactions are echoed on campuses. across the country in the wake of the Christian Phalangists' Sept. 16- 16 massacre of some 500 unarmed Palestinians in Beirut. Israel, of course, has been heavily implicated in the slaughter. On this country's campuses, where the Palestinian · homeland issue has been played out . at increasing volumes and with more frequent con- frontations over the last six months, Jewish students seem to be shunning group . discussions while pro~ Palestinian students are congregating in nwnbers un- precedented in this country, and joining uncharacteristically public demonstrations. \Silent protests\ and \memorial sel'vices\ have been held among \many many places and campuses,\ .reports the Palestine Congress of North American (PCNA). Such visibility is un· characteristic of the Palestinians - of whom there are \about 1000\ on U.S. campuses, according to the National Association .of Foreign Student Affairs estimates - in this country .. The General Union of Palestinian Students (GUPS) has generally kept a low profile, says a-spokeswoman at PCNA headquarters in Washington, D.C. \In America, students who may be involved with GUPS cannot be so active because they do not have pennanent visas. If they are too active and tliey are from the West Bank, it means harassnlent when they get home,\ the spokeswoman, a former University of Tennessee student, explains. That, she says, is why \you won't hear them screaming in the streets'' in this country. The Palestinians and their supporters did become in- creasingly visible on campus last spring and then during the summer months, setting up information booths at unions, getting into scuffles with pro- Israel students at Texas, and bringing in lecturers. ·· A- GUPS spokesman in Washington said his group sponsored a campus tour for \some doctors who were in Lebanon when the Israelis invaded\ in June. The numbers have increased dramatically since the tragedy in Beirut. \This is our time to tell our story, while the people are listening,\ says Essawi, who lost a brother - also a Pitt student - in Lebanon in July and who organized a memorial service at Pitt over the swn- mer. \We never had a chance to explain ow-selves before.\ \In Arab culture,\ adds the PCNA spokeswoman in Washington, \we resent having to play upon death. But we do it because people are looking at us now, and because clearly America is involved.\ The mourners at the demonstrations consistently call for an end to U.S. arms support to Israel. There may be more public activities coming. .The Palestine Information Office reports \a flurry of inquiries\ from people \around the country wanting to know what to do.\ . The GUPS spokesman in Washington expects his group will be organizing ''a lecture, a presentation, something of that sort\ on various campuses into the near future. Jewish. campus groups, by contrast, have been· quiet. For example, the phones have been quiet at the Hillel House at · Southern Cal. A Hillel spokesman attributed it to USC \not (being) a very politically active campus.'' But even activists are lying low, and sp.eaking very carefully. Yeshiva University·professor Avtaham Weiss, who helped organize a New York protest of Pope John Paul Il's recent meeting with PLO leader Yassir Arafat, notes the ambivUence of many activists: \On the one level I've really not been able to sleep at night ~ the magnitude and the horror of innocent people being killed. On the other hand, I just think the J:eWish community has been maligned for being responsible for a massacre (it) had nothing to do With.\ \There've been many in- ternal discussions over the issue\ among .Jewish students, adds Jeremy Brochim of the University of Maryland's Hillel. ''There are discussions over the appropriateness of certain acts. It's an issue any sensitive human being has to deal with.'' But Brochim and aU the others interviewed for this article worried that such discussions, if made publlc, could threaten Israel itself. \There's always the fear that criticism will be eXploited by Israel's ,enemies,\ he says. The campus Jewish com- munity consequently turns out \carefully-worded statements\ about the massacre that combine reaffirmation of support for Israe,l with whatever doubts or sorrows they might feel. Oregon State's Rob thinks ''most Jewish students probably don't want to talk about it at all. They change the subject. It's so painful that they don't want to risk going to a Jewish f110ction and having ·to discuss it with someone. I know I want to work it out myself.'' \That doesn't surprise me at all,\ says Ken Jacobson of the Anti-Defamation League in New York. ''This is a very personal issue for Jews. Tile real issue is how do the events of (Sept. 16-18) fit .in witb our self- image.\ Jacobson says Israelis and American Jews ''are used to all the screaming in the world about Israel being judged differently frorn all other countries. We also say, 'God forbid we should be like countries like Iran or Syria .. ' We're more concerned that we actually do become more like those other countries. It'.s our soul we're worried about, not what they think about· us and scream about.': Campu!J Digest News Semce In a Washington University study, researcher! ar-e finding that, as the years pass, masters atheletes - cyclists and long _ distance runners over age 50 ~ may deteriorate at a· slower rate than their inactive peers. Researchers studied 16 aging athletes for three years, and although conclusive data is not yet avatlable, preliminary findings have, confirmed a relationship ,between a person's exercise habits and the rate of decline in cardiovascular function with age. · '''We're looking at maXimum oxygen uptake capacity- a measwe of the cardiovascular system's ability to tram!!port oxygen to the muscles,'' says professor -of prevent-ive medicine John Holloszy, M.D. Regardless of health, everyone experiences some decliile in this. capacity ~with age. The rate of that reduction is important becall$e it may determine how one feels as age begins to sap strength an<;! endurance. The greater the decHne, the lower one's capacity for strenuous exercise. Non-athletes experience an 8 to 20 per cent decline each decade. Most athletes show similar reductions, but this decline may be due to decreased training with age, HoUosczy says.

After a nn·r•in+ing tournamimt at !l.AIJ<liU Yo the squad travelled to vu\;••n.eepsie on September 30th to face New Paltz and Vassar. After a walking tour of Vassar's campus, the team found the gym and New Paltz for their first match. After, an extremely slow start, Union finally started to play volleyball but it was too late. New Paltz handed Union an embarrassing loss. Union was quick to rally against Vassar in the next match,' defeating them soun~:lly. After some regrouping and rethinking, Union took on Siena at home on October 4th in front of a rather large crowd (Thanks people! ). Playing a very strong offensive game, . Union out- played Siena 15-2, 15-12, 13-15, and 15-5. Natalie Stone .played an excellent offensive game and helped to keep the p'syched team up:! Union is extremely lucky this year to have a strong, experienced squad that can play any combination of players, defenses, and offenses, as the Siena mateo proved. Hopefully the slow start has been overcome and the 4-5 record. will improve. The next home match is on October 14th at 6 p~m. against LeMoyne. It should be an excellent game and Union will be ready, having the away matches at Williams and Albany behind us. A large,-- crowd backing us is welcome. Stop by and cheer us on! , Start Counting. October \'} 1981 ORTS C .· t• w· onsecu . 1ve . 1ns Hectic Week The women's tennis team won its fourth consecutive .match M~ndaJ, Oct. 4 defeating Middlebury 6.-1. Last year, the team llits its turning ·point . ending the season with its fir.st winning record· in many years. This year's team is stronger than ever. According to coach Leslie Arakelian, \The team's dedication and spir.lt has lead to its victories.\ First and second singles players, co-captairl Julie Miller and Beth Housman have both tallied undefeated records of 4- 0. Returning for her third season, Julie has been playing a strong and aggressive game. Beth, playing for her fir.st season, has proven to be a valuable asset to the team. Third year veteran, Rita Lin- denberg playing third singles has added great depth to the team with a winning record of 3- 1. Fourth and fifth singles, co- captain Pamela Marcus and Alissa Calabria with records of 2-2 and 3-1 respectively both .. :30 have strong baseline games. .Switching ~ff doubles players, Linda Esposito, Nancy Judson, Cathy Furst, Carol Arden, and Peggy Belanoff have added to the team's strength. They have become more aggressiveeach match. The team started the season strong, upsetting Albany State 5-2. The Albany victory was follo.wed by a tough match agamst Colgate when Rita brought the team to victory by winning }Jer third set and making the final score 4-3. On Saturday the Dutch Women trounced RPI shutting them out 7-0. Coach Arakelian feels the team has great ·potential this season an<t is looking forward to a Union victory over Oneonta. Thus far the team has not had any home matches but i·s looking forward to school support at its .first match on Union courts against Vassar on Oct. 11. Women's soccer began its first season with a hectic week of competition, playing ·three matches in five days. Despite a steadily .improving effort, the team unfortunately .fell to each of its opponents. Union was pitted against Siena in it~ first game as a varsity team, and was faced with a very aggressive and well- established group.. Union was unable to score, while Siena tallied. up three goals to take the game. A better game was played at Colgate two days later. After a rather sluggishfirst half, Union began to hustle and move the ball. With the score at 3-0 in Colgate's favor, a goal was made for Union by senior for~ ward Tracy LaMarca. However, Colgate remained in the lead, winning the match 4-1. Union met RPI in the first home match. Aggressiveness and improved techniques could be seen from the Union women right from the start. RPI scored twice early in the game, but freshmen starters Astrid Norsh . and Patty Richards evened the score with a goal a piece for Union. Union's enthusiasm was not enough, though, as RPI picked up one more goal to clinch the match. Union will battle Siena again today in a home match at 3:30 on Garis field . r··--------------------~ I . I I $2 00 30 minute guarantee I I • .

Page 18 198~ ... Montana Tokes Over New Intramural ·coordinatOr ~ ByDAVEPACE Spor1s Staff Bob Montana, the new in- tramural ·coordinator, already has the fall season in high gear. As usual, student participation has been tremendous,. as there are twenty-six soccer teams, thtity-two football teams, and twenty-five basketball teams. ''Coach'' Montana feels that the purpose of intramurals is for students to \participate and have a good time\ relieve some pressures from their studies, and express competitiveness if they desire. Montana is working hard at improving the efficiency of the intramural department. His three main goals for this unp dertaking include a decrease in the numl)er _of . forfeits, motivation of the referees and intramural workers to perform their duties to the fullest, and greater cooperation from the participants. · New rules concerning forfeits have already been installed. If a team forfeits once, they lose their ten dollar deposit. tf the team forfeits a second time, it Will be thrown out of the league. \Coach'' has proven that these rules are to be strictly enforced, as there are already a few teams who have been eliminated from league p~ay. The reasons for this policy are numerous. Montana realizes how many students look for- ward · .. to intramural par- ticipation. He feels for them . . when they get psyched up fqr a game only to find the opposing team didn't show up. Forfeits also prove to be a waste for the student coordinators and referees who put so much time and .effort into the program. Montana also realizes the importance of the role that the referees play. In the past, many referees \went through the motions'' of officiating. Mon- tana feels that officials doing a good job could make the program more enjoyable for everyone involved. This is where the cooperation of the students comes tnto play. There have been numerous occasions where officials have been given rough tlmes by the players. \Coach\ wants the participants to realize that the officials. are just trying to do their job. It is very different for one man to officiate an entire game, He hopes that in the future, .players will take this into consideration before yelling at the referees. In addition, Montana feels that the students could cooperate by helping the of- ficials. This . could range from being honest if the referee is not sure of a call, to helping him collect equipment ~fter a game. If equipment is lost, .. new equipment will have ·to be purchased,. and cutbacks similar to those experienced last spring (shorter gym hours, shorter seasons) will have to be made. Coach Montana feels that, if the number of forfeits can he decreased. the officials remain conscientious about their work, and the participants are willing to .cooperate with the offiCials, then he will be able to help the intramural department reacn its potnetial.

Page. 20 OONOORDI[iJNSLS; October 'T, 198B SP Dutchmen Fall to Danes By LOU GEORGE Sports Staff The Union football team lost a tough decision (17·7) to the third ranked· team in the nation, Albany St., last Saturday · af- ternoon. In view ofthe fact that first downs, total yards and penalties \Yere basically even~ the Dutchmen lost the battle due to mistakes itt very im- portant situations. Six times penalties gave the Great Danes first downs in key situations. Many of the miStakes could be blamed on the fact that of Union's twenty-two starters, seventee were either freshmen or sophomores. A very frustrating factor IS that both Albany St. touchdowns were results of two long reverse passes. Albany's first touch- down was set up by a split end around pass from. Pete Marlo to Jay Ennis that put the ball on the Union eleven. Three plays later quarterback Tom Pratt threw a touchdown pass to Dave Soldini. In the third quarter Albany tried the same end around play again, this time the result was a 27 yard touchdown play. The score after that play was 17~. Union had not scored a point, but had let many ·golden opportunities slip away. throw the ball 48 times Satur- day, completing 23 of them for 234! . yards and orily one in- terception.

These--statistics were the reason Dan Stewart was On the second drive of the game the Dutchmen started from their 44 . yard line and. drove to the Albany St. 4 yar· dline. With a first doWn and' fou.r yards to go for a touchdown the Dut-chmen could not get on the scoreboard. This was not the only opportunity Union had to score. Union drove inside the 25 yardline on four other oc- casions, only coming away with one touchdown. The lone touch· down came in the fourth Ql18rter when Dan Stewart threw a four yard fourth down touchdown pass to Rich Kellaher.

Though mistakes hurt, the Union squad was able to defeat Albany Medical School by a score of 9-6 to even it~ record at 1-1. Scoring came early· for the .Gamet ruggers who tot-ally dominated the first half. Five minutes into the game, Lee Waxman dodged and ftlked past many Albany defenders for a scoring run of 30 yards and Union's first points of the game. Russ Blackhouse converted the extra-points kick and the Gamet club was up on top by a score of 6~. With the lead, the home team, playing on Library Field, had all the momentun behind them. The ball was constantly in Albany territory. But every time Union was within scoring range, a penalty would be called on the··club; giving the ball to the opposition. Time after time the club's surges were stopped due to penalties. As it appeared Union would dominate the entire game, the Albany wing put a halt to that thinking. The visiting club was able to push the-ball .downfield and work it out to the left wing. Several missed tackles and fifty yards later, Albany had a try and. the game was tied after a c:ompleted conversion. In the second half, play was marked by penalty after penalty, both · teams being guilty.

Again the Union serum, which included Carl Aiken, Doug Baumgarten, Meade Summer, Tim Meyer and Jim McNeil, surged over the ball and the club was able to boot it out as time expired. The second game was as fierce as the first one. This time, though, it was Albany Medical School, with the help of several Union playerslilling in, which was able to pull out a victory by a score of 12-6. Albany pulled out to a quick 12-0 lead on its first two possessions. But the Union defense held strong for the remaining game. Coming out in the second half, the Garnet club looked tough.

Committee Tightens Grip ByJEFFSTEINllERG Staff Under the leadership of the Vice President of Finance, Barton Hill, the Student Forum Finance Co:mtnittee has taken significant steps toward eliminating the potential for any further abuse of Student Activities monies. The new \system\ which went into ef- fect this past Monday (October 11th), takes virtuaUy all of the decision making burden and places it ·on the seven member Finance Committee. · All clubs and organi:z;ations now have a Committee \representative'' Who i$ responsible for approving each individual exf>enditure.. Mrs. Marra will no longer distribute petty casb, purchase orders, or check requests without having first received a voucher bearing the signature of a Finance Committee member. More than sixty \general accounting ledgers\ have been purchased as each organization is now required to keep their own record of transactions. These books are subject to audit by tbe Committee on as little as three da~s notice. However, as of this past Friday . only five organizations had picked up their books from Student Activities. In addition to these ledgers, both the Finance Committee and Mrs. Marra will keep ledgers. What it all amounts to is a redundant bureau~racy. whose time has come. Accor- ding to Hill,\this is all out of necessity in order that we ... avoid another Jeff Mitchell situation.\ Very few students remember the plight of the Finance Coiilillittee of several years ago. The Activities budget was overspent by the then \Tax Committee\ after which .time the Dean of Students, withthl! help of Mrs. Marra, administered the budget. In order for us to remain in control of \our'' money, it is tQus imperative that we stay \in the black\. The Student Activities budget is derived directly from the fee toward the mechanism through which we draw on ''our\ money. The Student Activities Fund is managed by the College Administration for us. In return, according to Hill, the College retains all interest derived from said account. The.re is no argument here, for where would we have been a few ·years ago when we over- spent? There may be, however, an injustice being done -here. Last year there was a surplus of approximately $23,000. The Finance Committee did an admirable job and saved ap- proximately ten percent of . our money. According to Hill. however, we have not retained that money in this year's budget. What results is \an BACKGROUNDS: Materials provided b'y the respective campaign headquarters. Mario Matthew Cuomo brings to the Office of the Lieutenant Governor a recot·d of twenty years of service as a private attorney, mediator, and public official. Mr. Cuomo began his legal career when, as a cum laude graduate of St. John's Law School, he became confidential legal assistant in Judge Adrian T. Burke of the New York State Court of Appeals, in 1956. In 1958, he joined the private law firm of Corner, Finn, Cuomo and Charles, where he earned a reputation as one of the best appellate lawyers in the State. of $38 charged each student each term. This amounts to nearly $225,000 which is to be distributed by the Committee (with approval of the Student Forum) this academic year. It becomes obvious that the Committee must budget well below this figure to ·ensure that we retain control of \our\ budget. The next logical question is: What happens. to the surplus achieved through the monumental s.urveillance ' effort devised by Hill? To answer this we must look Mr. Cuomo entered public life through his pro bono work representing neighborhood groups in disputes with government. He spent six years successfully resolving the so- called Corona Controversy that threatened with condemnation of 69 homes in Corona, Queens. In 19.74, he was asked by the Mayor of the City of.New York, and accepted, the unpaid job of mediator of the explosive Forest Hills coQtroversy. The controversy over a .planned low income housin!J project, in a incentive to spend and not to sa:ve\. Hill further suggests that this money should be used as the students desire. ·\Tileoretically we should be able to. do anything we want to do with it.\ The money, suggest Hill, could be put toward im- provements to -Carnegie Hall, \our\ student center, or other projects that the student body deems worthwhile. The issue of what to do with such a surplus could be put to a student vote following · the fiscal year in which the savings accrued. Nevertheless, according to Hill, we must examine more closely the mechanism which gives rise · to an incentive to spend rather than to save. middle-class Queens neigh- borhood resulted in becoming the focus of nationwide at- tention. Its resolution is recounted in Mr. Cuomo's best- selling book, Forest Hills Diary. After an unsucc.essful prinrary campaign for the Democratic party's Lieutenant Governor nomination in 1974, Mr. Cuomo was appointed Secretary of State by Governor Hugh L. Carey. He consolidated three agencies into one and produced a net savings. to taxpayers of six million dollars in four years. He also handled numerous special assignments from the Governor, including the fact finder in the 1974 nursing home controversy, negotiator in the 1976 Coop City Crisis and mediator in the 1977 land claims of the Mohawk lndians, upstate . Lew Lehrman earned his college degree at Yale. His first job after college was a teacher, a . position he won on a fellowship. Lew then earned his Masters Degree from Harvard. After enlisting in the Army, Lew returned to the family's business. Together with his partners, Alex Grass and Dave Sommer, they expanded the business into the Rite Aid Corporation. Today Rite Aid operates more than 950 discount drug .stores with 202 in New York State alone. Rite Aid has been one of New York's fastest growing companies. Lew was president of Rite Aid for eight years. In 1977, ne became chairman of lUte Aid's executive committee to devote .more time to public affairs and Wilson National Fellowship Foundation. Concordiensls was given the opportunity to speak with Raskin on various national issues of interest to the student body. When asked to conunent on the policies of the Reagan Administration, he replied that what disturbs him the most is the notion that the government is suffocating the natjon. It weakens the stability of the country, he feels, for the public to lose faith in their own government. This mistrust, he continued, is not completelY the fault of the Reagan Administration considering the state that economy was in when Reagan took office. He does believe, though, that the many contradictory polici.es of Reaganomics, such as the governinent's promise to balance the budget, greatly expand the defense program, .and be able to cut taxes at the same time, have increased the skepticism of the public. · Raskin went on to say that although double digit inflation is a serious issue that must be dealt with, the administration should be equally concerned over the fact that over ten percent of the population is presently· unemployed. When his growing family. In 1972 Lew founded the Lehrman Institute, a public policy forum for the study of economics, foreign policy, and the problems of state and local government. He has written one book on economics, co- authored, and written a number of articles. Lew Lehrman ha..s been a trustee and director of many charitable institutions, . in- cluding Daytop Village of New York, a home for the rehabilation of young drug users; the International Center for the Disabled~ the Boys' Club of New York; The American Jewish Forum; and Cardinal Cooke's Inner-City Scholarship Fund, which raises money for parochial schools in Harlem, the South Bronx and the Lower East Side. ~ As chairman of the New York State Republican Platform Committee in 1978, Lew visited 40 counties to listen to the thoughts of New York's citizens. Since 1979, he has been Chairman of the Republican State Committee's Economic Advisory Council. In 1980, Lew was chairman of Business for Reagan-Bush in New York State. EMPLOYMENT: Cuomo: The Reagan Administration has introduced two policies- \Reaganomics\ and \The New Federalism\--that are both radical and reactionary. They Continued on page 2 asked if this high unem- plorment rate would have sertous consequences for college students entering the job market, he explained that the economy does not seem to be recovering despite what the people on Wall Street seem to claim, and that students would be facing a decreased number of jobs available. Increased automation and use of high technology will further limit employment opportunities. By the year 1990, he predicts, 3 million college graduates will find themselves in a situation in which there Will be no jobs for their knowledge and skills. This will result in a \frustrated work force\ because those graduates will be forced to seek jobs for which they are over qualified. Those students trained in the liberal arts, he continued, will be better able to cope in such a situation. A .liberal arts background is less specialized and has more flexibility in the iob market. He went on to explain that trade unions are placing greater emphasis on seniority protection. Those people already in the work. force will have job security, but instead of new people replacing them as they retire, automation will step in. This \closing off of the work place\ will make it more dif- ficult for women and minorities to obtain employment. Com- panies are able to work around affirmative action programs by claiming \we have all the people we need\. Raskin began his journalistic career as editor of the campus newspaper at City College of New__Xork, while holding the position of Junior class President. He explained that he earned a reputation by making himself \so obnoxious\ to the President· of the College. He then became College Correspondent to the New York Times, earning the sum of twelve dollars a week. The President of the College, claiming that Raskin was \destructive to the image of the College\ had fellow facUlty members write letters· to the Times requesting his dismissal. This, according to Raskin, \was what solidified my position on the newspaper.\ The City Editor of the Times needed someone to cover unemployment, the time then being the beginning of the Depression, and Raskin soon found that it was the \easiest beat on the paper\. As people began to go back to work, he moved from covering unem- ployment to specializing in labor relations. Mter working for the government for several years, he became, in 1961, a member of the Times Editorial Board. He commented that although the field of journalism is very competitive, \People are still being hired, though the rates aren't as good.\ He added that although newspapers are becoming more and more automated, as is . the case in most industries, they will always need people to write.

''\ Page 2 CONCOBDIENSIB, October J.i., 198. Coatinued from page 1 are the ghosts oflaissez-faire of tbe policies that brought us the Great Depression masquerading as new ideas: Together, Reaganomics and the New Federalism represent the abandonment of everything the · Democratic Party has st~Ied to build, nationally and m New York State-under the leadership of such great Governors as AI Smith Franklin Roosevelt, Herbert Lehman, Averell Harriman and Hugh Carey. Employment may be the area in which the impast of Reagan's policies is most severe: New·· York is suffering its '!orst unemployment crisis smce the Great Depression. Nearly 685,000 residents are out of work. In some areas, like Buffalo-Erie the jobless .rate hovers above 12 percent. Job training programs have been mercilessly slashed reslllting in an unemploymeni epidemic tbat afflicts urban youth. Indirectly, Reagan's policies. have worsened the blow. The Administration is channeling a greater proportion· of federal funds to the anti- Labor, pr<rReagan \Sun Belt\ than ever before-at the expense of New York and other Nor- theastern states. A top priority must be to deal with the impact of the unemployment crisis. We can never afford to lose sight of unemploYIJlent's cost in terms of human suffering-of people and families stripped of the dignity of work, of the ability to make their own way. I would do the following to provide im- mediate relief: Increase maximlUll unem- ployment benefits to $155 a week. Be . prepared to provide emergency job retraining and standby emergency aid in areas like Buffalo-Erie where the crisis is particUlarly severe. I also propose to take the following long range steps, many of which involve close cooperation between the public and private sectors: Increase our capacity for putting together special economic development projects, using the excellent package of tax and other in- centives we have assembled over the last seven and one half years. Lewis Lehrman Establish local economic development task forces. We should continue the concept of the Buffalo Economic Development Task Force duplicating its effo~ in other parts of the State. LehrmiQI: The single most important thing that New York State's Governor can do both for New York's citizens and for its localities is to encourage job growth in the state. My goal as Governor will be the creation <>f at lea:;t 100,000 new jobs a year. That lS a reasonable goal. Had New York State grown at the average rate of the work force in the United States during the 1970s, we would have added at lea~ one hundred and fifty thousand new jobs per year. I strongly believe that small business Will provide the new jobs that New York State needs. That's why tax reductions must be targeted at the development of small brisiness. One study by David Birch of MIT found that 80 perc~nt of all . new jobs created m the United States were developed by firms em- ploying 100 or fewer employees. Another study by Birch focused specifically on job-creation in cities. He concluded that tlte most important factor in new jobs was not avoiding the death of firms, but encouraging the birth and expansiQn of new companies. · The firms Experts Disagree By MICHELLE NOVELLE Staff Both John Kennl:h Galbraith and Michael Novak have at- tained fame and respect as writers, scholars and activists. Although both men are political, their ~iewpoints are completely opposite. Galbraith, a prOfessor at Harvard University for some thirty years now is originally from the wheatfields of Alberta, Canada. He received his Ph.D. from the University of California at Berkley. He then went on to Harvard to begin his first academic job; tutoring. Galbraith was a tutor at Win~ throp House while John F. Kennedy, then an un- dergraduate, resided there. It was during that time that Galbraigh first c~e to know Kennedy. Galbraith .soon left Harva~d and joined the faculty at Prmceton, and later, the faculty of a number of various other colleges. Eventually Harvard called him back and for the last ~hirty years he has taught at the University. One of Galbraith's most in- teresting jobs in . his public service career was during World War It During the Second World War Galbraith was a \price fixer\ for the economy. This meant govern- ment control in certain areas during the war, such as gas rationing and butter rationing. Galbraith was the head of the Office of Price Administration. They were the people who set prices for such companies as General Electric, here in Schenectady. Galbraith was never far from the political scene. During his career he has been an advisor to both Adlai Stevenson and John F. Kennedy. While Kennedy was President he appointed Galbraith Ambassador to India. Galbraith is also an author. Galbraith's ideology is towards the left of the political spec- trum. Some of Galbraith's viewpoints, which are in direct contrast to those of Michael Novak, are: -He is not convinced that the United States economy shotJl.d be viewed as a market economy. -He believes strongly in the need for government in- tervention. -He would say \busine~s is big, labor is . big, government has to be big, too, so as b balance it.\ According to Professor Reynolds, of the Economics Department, the talk Galbraitlt will present. on Monday. October 18, is likely to include the nuclear arms race issue as well as that of. the economy. Galbraith has written many articles concerning the arms Continued on page 15 attempt to combat the root c~;auses of crime through programs like the following: Child protection. Jobs and education. One other deterrent measure that I favor is life imprisonment without parole. A sentence of this type is an effective deterrent to h~inous crimes. In addition, we. mtU~t not forget the victims of violent crime. We must do more to · rehabilitate and compensate . them. · · l.elmnan: Lt. Gov~rnor Mari.o Cuomo . . . Since . I have begun my (statement),two violent crimes· have been committed in our · state. A violent crime is com- mitted every three minutes in New York. A rape is committed everyhourandahalf.

It is time. to take our streets back from the criminals and give them hack to our families. generating jobs, he found were (1) s~~j (2) young; and (3) volatUe m their growth. Birch noted: \It is clear that the larger businesses are not doing the . central cities of declining area~ much of a favor by way of creatmg job opportunities for their residents.\ Specifically., in. New York State., the birth rate of new firms was weak in the 1970s. In fact, inN ew York City, the bulk of the 650,000 jobs lost in the late 1960s and early 1970s were in ~aU businesses. When the city fmally began to expand its employment base in the last two Years, however, it has not been in the small business area but in large financial service cmll- ~anies. When unemployment figures for New York were released last week, Samuel M. Ehrenhalt, the Regional Commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, said: \Three- quarters. of the st!lte's job growth m the period between 1979 and 1981 was in New York .. But the base of the city's job growth is very narrow and restricted to the financial and business service areas. The question for the state is whether you have a broad enough base for further expansion.'' We have to reverse that trend and once again make New York State the home of budding entrepreneurs. New York State must once again represent the best goals of the Affierican dream: to get a good education, to own a home, and to start a business. CRIME: Cuomo: Here., then, are a few of the approaches I would take to control crime: · A return to street patrols. Fun<ling auxiliary police. Emphasizing the protection of the elderly and disabled. We must revamp our court system to provide swift and sure punishment to those who are guilty. As Governor I would provide for: Management of the criminal justice system. Treatment of repeat of- fenders. One of the keys to controlling crime is to find ways to stop the violent repeat of- fender, the career criminal. . A stop to endless ad- Journments. The corrections system must be revamped to back up the police and the courts. As Governor I would seek: Re~troduction of a prison bond 1ssue. We must increase the nlUllber of prison cells in New York. Alternatives to incarceration. We must effectively rehabilitate juvenile offenders and non-violent offenders. In addition to all of these efforts, I, as Gpverrtor, would To deal with the catastrophe · of crime in New York, and to establish conditions of public · order and personal security, to walk the streets safely and live secure in our homes; we have to reform the institutions of justice in every significant respect. We must enact laws providing definite sentences for violent crimes, with sentences for separate offenses to· be served not concurrently, as at present, but consecutively. We must eliminate judiCial gridlock in our state courts. We must adopt such federal court practices as jury selection by the court and individual judicial calendars. We must also abolish restric~ tions on the use of accomplice testimony. Criminal con- · fessions must again be ad- missible in court if obtained in good faith by the police.

Between the 25th and the 28th the Career Center will be running a series of Career Panels in Carnegie Hall at 7:00 each night. These Panels will have representatives froin fields of business, the arts, science, and computer science,- communications, education, publi_c relations~advertising, govetnmentapublic affairs, and engineering, to name a few. Thes·e panels will draw ap- proximately forty ern.ployers . from all of these fields. The booths and exhibits will be open to students, faculty, .and staff, not only from Uruon, but from twenty other area colleges and uni:versities. to explore many career -and graduate opportunlties in. a short period oftiroe,\ and \take advantage (of the program) early in the academic ye~r so they (students) can. benefit · more from .information gained l~ter in the year,\ says Matteo. The purpose of tbe Career Awareness Week is to \raise students' awareness of what endless career ~opportunities are open to them and whatthose careers are about. The organizers of this Career Awareness Week are filled with optimism. There is a ''feeling-of excitement trying a new thing, pulling together a program of this nature,\ said Jane Wood, Assistant Dean of Students· Career Counselor. It is a \dynamic program, aU in one week,\ replied Matteo. _ Part One: By GAYLE ROSENFILD Staff The Nott Memorial has proved to be symbol of Union $lnce its completion in 1878. According to an article in volume I. No. 2 of Union VIews, in 1972 the Federal Govenunent declared t.he Nott to be national significance and listed it in the National . Register of Historic Places. This register is an of- ficial .inventory .of the nation's cultural property .worth preserving. If the federal government b~lieves the Nott is worth saving than why doesn't Union? This is a question shared by many concerned people of the Union community. Professor Griggs of the CiviL Engineering Department is ari avid su,pporter of the preser· vation and renovation of the Nott. As he so aptly states \When people think of Union they_ think of the Nott.\ Professor George .of the Biology Department conunented that \the Nott Memorial is the logo of this College. It ·is also an extraordinarily rich statemept of Union.\ It is apparent tnat many people believe the Nott should acquire some increased notice by Union's Board of Trustees. For isn't it the Board who wishes to su8tain the aesthetic image of the college? However., before the Board of the Priorities and Planning Committee can act, they need a precise-report of what's worong With the Nott and what can be done about these problems. Well, not to despair for such a. report does exist however • antiquated and dusty it may presently be. In 1973, $10,000 was appropriated by the Alumni Council to prepare a detailed · These professionals (many of whom are alUIIlni) can offer valuable information con- cerning career paths, for fresh\ men on up.

In an in· terview with Chris· Chadwick, Assistant Director of -the Department, many of these questions have been answered. The second of this tw<rpart series will deal with specific policies, procedures used, and situations encountered by the department. . The Safety and Security Officers of the Department are trained on the job. There is a three-month probation period in which the men are supervised on a regular basis. By these means. officers are able to obtain an overall view of Union· and the environment they are working in. Periodic meetings are held where supervisors are responsible for an in-depth ~ evaluation of each officer. It is a policy of the Department to engage only those who have had prior 'experience in the en- officers have either been a member of a police force or another safety and security organization. There exist five general areas in which the Department is involved. The first is that of traffic rules and regulations. \This is probably the most mundane are·a that we are in- volved in,\ says Chadwick, \but it is a necessity.\ want to give students a chance forcement of safety. Thus all Here officer.s are required to issue tickets to the community for violations as such. Tbe second area the Department involves itself in is safety. Student and college employee, as well as fire safety, are each separately involved in this area. Under a third classificationy of crime repression, the Depart- ment becomes involved after an actual crime has occurred. In this area the Department is active in an investigative capacity in which it may work in conjunctiQn · with tbe Schenectady Police Depart- ment. Crime Prevention falls under the fourth ,category. \This is before the fact,\ says Chadwick. \We are trying to prevent the crimes before they ,....----------------------.. . occur.\ Lastly, the Department aids the student community by COMMI'I'TEE VACANCIES - SocialComrnitt~e -3 '!:acancies (2 are reserved solely for freshmen) Fihn Committee- 4 vacancies (3.are reserved solely for freshmen) Elections Comiilittee-6 vacancies (3 are reserved solely for freshmen) Traffic.and Pet Co'lirt-2vacancies (1 is!eservedsolely for a freshman) Forms for these· openings. may be obtained at the Student Activities Desk and must lle turned in to Mrs. Marra in the Student Activities Office by 4 p;m., Tuesday, October 19, 1982. This deadUne extension is due to the small number of . applications alreadY. ~eceived. rendering college services. This broad area involves students barred out of their rooms, lost and found, transport of students and urgent contacts which are a necessity and are difficult when students are unable to be located. Duties which do not require an experienced hand are un- dertaken by students them· selves. Areas such as traffic control, dormitory supervision, and.foot patrol are all manned by members of the student history of the Nott and to list what actions ~ay be taken to restore the Nott and at what cost. According to an Alumni Council Newsletter of February Tl, 1974, this document was prepared for the Trustees and Alumni Council of Union College by the architectural finn of Mendel, Mesick, and Cohen. However, John Mesick, a member of this firm, proved to be the principle architect involved in the study. This repo.rt outnnet. a detailed recommendation .of a program of action to restore the Nott and specitled· the cost these renovations would entail. Some of the recom- mendations which Mesick considere(i to be of urgent priority were restoration of the Nott's roofs and drum of the dome, replacement of all the slate roofing, installation of new illuminator ·slates, restoration of the exterior masonry, removal of ivy and foundation planting along with many other repairs too detailed and numerous to list. Mesick even gave an itemized estimate of the costs of such construction work totalling $1,546,000. What should be recalled is that these prices are from 1973. Inflation would make this sum appear even more unattainable today. However, after spending sueh a large amount of money to develop this study, why didn't the Board utilize its then up- dated facts? Or, at least, with the knowledge of what repairs must be undergone, why hasn't the Board acted to this day? Why has the Nott continued tobe neglected? One answer to this last question is the problem of priorities. What is more im- portant, the renovation of the Arts Building, the building of the new athletic field, or the restoration of the Nott? Apparently, the Bo~rd has chosen the former two. As Professor George put it, the Board has a difficult task of \balancing a whole variety of needs.\ The problem is, however, that the Nott \has a very, very low priority,\ ac- cording to _Professor Griggs. Another reason for the neglect of the Nott is the need for a use for the building. What can a sixteen sided building over one hundred feet tall be used for? As Griggs states, \the idea is not to modernize the building; the idea is to restore it.\ The college wishes to utilize the Nott; however, it doesn't want it structurally altered. The Nott is a historical monument th8t would lose its charm if it were to be changed. Unfortunately, the prpblem of raising money for renovation is also tied into the problem of finding a use for the building. This idea was expressed by Assistant Librarian Ruth Anne a vans, \to raise any money, · they must have an accepteable use for the building.\ It's practically impossible to receive donations for an am- bigu()US project. In addition, the college is presently trying to build up its endowment so it would be hard pressed to ex· tract money from the college to go toward renovating the Nott. A proposed remedy to this problem would be to seek donations. In other words, a fund for the Nott would . be created and money would not be body. Persons employed in such positions are trained in a similar manner as the officers themselves. A handbook will be issued, however, for all student security employees allowing for a higher level of student training. The training is such that all students employed can fill all places. channeled from other 'activities on cQmpus. Unfortunately if Union's financial sources were to give money to the Nott program then they would probably not be able to donate to Union's general endowment. Therefore, in effect, the Nott project would be taking money away from the college's en- dowment fund. Basically, the only existing financial source the project could draw from is a bank account donated by Union's past graduating classes for the expressed purpose of preserving and restoring the Nott. The problem is that this ftmd is barely large enough to start work on the Nott. The fund currently serves as an incentive for more donatioll$ to the fund in the hope that onday it will be large enough . to implement restoration activity. What are some (If the ideas for the usage of the Nott? Evans, George, and Griggs are all in agreement upon the idea of storing old Union ~archives in th~ Nott. The library is much too small to continue housing all of the school's archives. Another suggestion is to store memorabilia and even art works in the Nott. l\s a matter of fact, from 1875-1903, the Nott was used as a gallery to display paintings and statues. From 1903-1961, it held Union's library and displayed various college - memorabilia. The Nott's present function as a theatre and bookstore is a far ary from its original designation as a chapel. . There has been suggeste!l another use for the Nott, far- fetched as it may initially sound, it is feasible. Professor Griggs has written up a detailed plan,of turning the Nott into a computer center and museum of sorts. He feels that there exists a need for the computer center to be the focal point of the college. He would like to have \the old and the new blended in the old building.\ As he puts it \you've got to find a use for the Nott and what better use than a computer center? His intricate and well thought out plans are quite impressive and worth a look if one wishes to see just how concerned one faculty member is about the Nott's continued existence. Professor George sums it up well when .he commented that \if the historical element could be combined with the progressive element it would be beautiful.\ This would also concur with Eliphalet Nott, the namesake for this monument, for he was a man who was forever looking toward the future. With the proposed ·suggestions for the Nott's usage, what is the next step? The process of recomillendation for action in this case is as follows: The Priorities and Planning Committee suggests ~ line of action to the Board of Trustees and President of the college who in turn discuss the proposal. According to Professor George, President Morris would like to .see the Nott restored by Union's bicen- tennial in 1995. George states that President Morris has promised to turn the matter of the Nott over to the Planning and Priorities Committee during the 1983-84 academic year. The Safety and Security Department is now for the most _part an entity within itself. \It tries,\ as Chadwick points out, \to change with the times.\ In this way it can become better equipped and prepared to treat those actions eminating from the campus, whatever they may be.

N~ews In Brief ByBOBVANVORIS Staff Reagans In Alabama Ronald Reagan this week paid a visit to a Montgomery, Alabama civic group which supported him in the 1980 Presidential election. Said Reagan, \They may be small in number, but they've been very supportive. I don't want people to forget who my friends are.\ Following a dinner in the President's honor, the group held its annual election of of- ficers in which its Gran.d Wizard and Imperial Dragon were unanimously re-elected. World To End Astronomers at the Union- affiliated Dudley Observatory have confinned earlier reports that a near collision between meteor AA-78m and Earth will, on May 29, 1983, sufficiently alter the earth's orbit to place it several hundred thousand kilometers nearer the sun. Scientists predict that by about dinnertime on May 29, the earth will be transformed into a spinning, molten mass on which countless billions of life forms will be instantly vaporized, leaving not even the slightest trace. In an unrelated move, Union College officials have an- nounced their intention of eliminating Winter Recess in order that Spring finals week might be moved up two or three weeks. Also- announced was a revision in Union's tuition payment ~chedule which now states that student bills for Fall Terni. 1983 must be paid no later than May 28. No reason was given for this action. Lecture·Serfes The Union College Psychology . Forum has an- nounced that it has received a Federal grant which will be used to fund a series· of lectures on ''The Anti-8oeial Personality in America.\ The lectures will begin on Wednesday, October 27 and will feature such noted sociopaths as (Boston Strangler) Albert DeSalvo, (Presidential assailant) Lynette '\~queaky\ Fromm, and (game-show host) Gene Rayburn. It is hoped that the lectures will prove successful, especially in light of some of the Psychology Forum's past failures. Admits Forum Presidnet Arthur D. Altman, \Well we did take some flak for last spring's 'Aleoholic's Beer Rally,' but we've planned several events for this year and we hope to put that behind us.\ For anyone who might be in- terested, the Forum will be sponsoring an Agorophobiac's Convention on Saturday, to be followed by the group's annual Anorexia Brunch on Sunday morning. GradlUltlon Plans Several of the smaller in- stitutions of the \Union University\ system have made public their plan to hold joint commencement excercises 1n 1983. While Union College, Albany Law School, and the Albany College of Pharmacy will hold seperate exercises as they have always done, the remaining schools, attended by a total of less than one thousand students, plan to save at least 70 percent of what separate exercises would cost. Although negotiations between the schools seem to be going smoothly, one major point of contention is over proposals for a song to exp.tess the them of . the Graduation Ball.

Still, I felt something was very, very wrong. For one thing, I had no idea where I was .going. Even worse, I did not know what to expect. In my mind I pictured a tiny, dark room in some fire trap on the hill, Was this where I was to begin my journalistic career? l wanted to write a feature;. instead, I .found my~elf locked in mortal combat with my conscience. What if they did not like my comments? Well, too bad. Actually, the Schenectady Museum and Planetarium is a very nice .place. I had heard I comments of both .praise and · condemnation. After taking a very detailed tour of the museum which is located on Not-t Terrace Heights (off of Nott Terrace and at a great height) I came away very _pleased with ·what I saw. Instead of some · dingy room with a lot of arrowheads and beads and old .furniture I found a very modern musellin with a wide · range of exhibits. Of course, there are the usual arrowheads. But they ate very professionally presented. The collection ranges from a 92~year-old toothpick holder to a variety of stuffed and mounted animals - the three-toed sloth is very impressive. You can see a marble plate from the Ming Dynasty. Or, if you are more interested in modern art, there is an exhibit of steel sculpture by Arline Peartree Shulman (I even got to see her touching up). .

CONOOBDIENSIS, October 14, 1988 Page G - I Grad StUdies ·at Union. Qy EMILY LOOSE Staff It is easy for the Union College student with a typically demanding schedUle to be~ome focused on only those areas of the school which directly . concern ·him and to disregard • the many others. How many undergraduates kno.w that Union runs a rather extensive graduate program? Probably not many, ·yet· in the words of Dean Aaron Feinsot of Graduate Studi'es; .. a new college comes alive at 4:30.\ The number of graduate students doubles the size of Union College enrollment,. and may reach as many as 2~500 to 3,000. What is the nature of this graduate program? It con- centrates on Masters degrees in Engineering, Computer Science, and :Business Management; but a}so . offers two Ph.D. programs in Biology and Administration and· Engineering Syste~. There are approximately HKl full~time graduate students, the majority on the management program. It is typical then, for- the graduate student to attend part-time evening courses while working full-time during the day. And we think we have it tough! Graduate students may at- tend Union not only in Schenectady but .also on \Branch Campuses\ in Poughkeepsie and . Pittsfield. These Branch Campuses consist of classroom space rented for nights: in Poughkeepsie, rented trom V:assar College; in Pittsfield, from Berkshire Commun-ity College. - . Another important, . and unique, feature 'for the College Graduate Studies is its Alumni Scholarsh,ip Program. Union offers its alumni any two credit courses free at either Pittsfi~ld, Poughkeepsie, or Schenectady. ':1his program affords aluinni the opportunity to round out what might have been, for example, a rather structured Engineering schedule with art or English courses, or may provide the· impetus for flU'ther graduate studies. Also, the Graduate Studies system is not limited to the traditional school year. The College is committed to use its campus more extensively in summertime. Stresses Dean Feinsot, \Unionis now a twelve month campus.\ In addition to a wellwestablished regular summer school which offers undergraduate courses .from Calculus to Themodynamics to Contemporary Drama, Union instituted this past year three new summer programs with considerable success. The ''College_ Experience\ is a six- week, two;;.c.ourse term for .selected lligh school students. Fifty-one students from a wide WHAT FORMAL RUSH OFFERS YOU geographic distribution, one from Wisconsin and one from Florida; attended the program this first summer, a respcinse with whicn the Dean was .quite happy. These courses · are taught by regular Union facUlty and are legitimate college credits. The Dean e$i.mates that at least half of the students who attended - picked up ap- plications for the college while here. The ''Summer Skills\ program, whi~h caters to local junlor high school students, is a one cour.se, non-credt, twC>-week term which 130 students at- tended- also a strong showing. And last'·is the two-and•a-half day weekend program of lecp tures fi'()m four Union faculty members. Students and alumni who attend these programs are housed on campus, usually in Riclunond. Further expansion is planned, including a ten-day stay in Italy next year as part of the \Alumni College\ program in association with the full term in Italy with Professor Freund as lecturer. enion College is not, in short, ' as -often .perceived, a limited undergraduate school of ap- proxilnately 2,000 students. Graduate Studies has established ties with many corumunities .and many levels within these communnities, thereby expanding Union's influence on and committment to higher eeducation. -- FEATURES Dean Aaron Feinsot of General Studies The Award Winning College Movie ''A Union of People'' will be shown in SSO 16 on Friday, October 1 5 .and Saturday, October 16 at 7:00pm .

CONCOBDIENBIB, October 1.J.o 1988 fl ' ·- ' . Page7 Larry Castelli, chairman of the Committee on Committees. Committees By SUSAN SINGER and LAURA SHAPIRO Staff Six student - formed com- mittees that are open for ap- plicatlon are the Social, Con- cert, Film, and- Elections Committees, Traffic and. Pet Col,l.ft, and Speaker's Forwn. Those interested have ah·eady ~pplied and now the selection of the new committee members is in the hands of the Committee On Committees. The ap- plication . process was anonymous in that the only identifying information given on the application was I.D. number·, phone number, box number, and class year. This is to insure that the applications will be evaluated on their own merits. The Committee On Committees estimates that the the selection process will take three to four weeks. There was a common application for all the committees and applicants specified which committee they were most interested in. The applications were designed to give candidates the chance to state prior experience, motivation, and what they felt was the committee's purpose. 'They will be evaluated on those elements as well as on- their creative aM innovative ideas. The applications are graded on a scale of one to five by each of the five members of the Committee On Committees. The total number of points an ap- plication can receive is twenty- five. The members of the. Committee On Committees will designate a cut-off point, possibly twenty points. All applications below this cut-off point will be rejected. At this point the Committee On Committees finds out the identity of remaining can- didates, and if there are more applicants than openings, they will be interviewed by the· Committee On Committees. In regard to the selection of the new committee members, Chairman of the Committee On Committees, Larry Castelli, stated,' 'I want it to be as fair as possible.

As a prospective fresh,. man, this reporter specifically asked two (2) gatesmen on separate tours of the school as to the quality of the food for the general student body. On both occasions I was told that the food put out by UCFS was \generally good.\ It is only now that I may conclusively say that both gatesmen were excellent con men in a sting that would make Robert Redford and Paul Newman very proud. 9.) The program which allowed students to give up a lunch or dinller so that the poor and hungry children of Schenectady could have a decent meal has been cut off by UCFS' own_ special brand of Reaganomics. This sorry act of taking food away from these disadvantaged youngsters at no cost to UCFS is a cruelty that must not go unrecognized. 10.) Due to the deteriorating conditions in Hale and West, the Rathskellar has been deluged by starving stu(\ents. The resUlt is that it often takes from thirty to forty-five minutes to be served. In addition, the dogs. flies and other loathesome creatures present make the 'skellar an unpleasant place for all. Recluse Reveals All blatant lack of employee - management relations between UCFS and those working for it. My close personal friend Piedmont was heard to say just before he left, \I can't stand the heat, so I'm getting out of the kitchen.\ _This is the· place where UCFS must get its house together before it can eveven begin to attack any of its othe~ .numerous problems. 11.) Finally, as you can probably guess by now, the quality of the food itself has steadily decreased in both its quality and the way it is cooked. Is it too much to ask that that with a budget of almost 1.5 MILUON dollars, the food be neither burnt nor raw, that the brand of food be not the cheapest available or from the latest president's reception, and that there be a day when even the simplest meals need not be smothered with gravy in order to be edible? Let us hope that this day win not be far away. In conclusion, I would like to state that it is with great pain (as well as hmtger) that I write this editorial. However, it is my sincere belief that the only way to better an abysmal situation is through public recognition of it. By JOEL STEIN Staff \I just couldn't believe it. I mean, I'm still in shock,\ ~:~aid Ace Investigative Reporter Robert s. DriScoll, referifig to the scandal he uncovered. \After-all he said, \I qad read Ask The Expert just like everyone else. I even sent in a question - ·and got a rec~Uy personal answer, tQo. (The acid in the kool aid did wonders!) I admit it: I was a fan of Dr. Birnbach's. Then I heard the rumors.'' The rumors were that Dr. Birnbach did not write his hnmensely popular column. ·\I didn't think they were true, but You don't get the title Ace Investigative Reporter for nothing. So I asked around,\ said Driscoll. \I tried to meet With Dr. Birnbach, but I couldn't get in touch with him. That's when I knew something W~s ~ong. Oh, pe<>,ple tried to. nuslead me. They tried to steer me wrong. But they couldn't fo~l me: no one could be up at Skidmore for tliat long - not even an expert like Dr. Bim· bach.\ It was only thrdugh great Perseverence that Robert Driscoll prevailed.\When I tried meeting with the doctor, I realized something else was wrong. Last year Dr. Birnbach wrote Commentaries. He woUld take a silly issue and make it into an entire Commentary. But,his AskThe Expert columns had up to four ideas in them, and the column was shorter than his average one from last year.'' . · Driscoll was studying for \a Physics 42 (Physics for Those Afraid of Real Physics)test late last Thursday . night when Driscoll got the phone call ·that helped break the case~ that changed his life, and that won Marty . Donadio of Brooklyn, N.Y. $10 on Bowling For Dollars. \The phone rang at 3:30 and J was nervous. The whole week befqre I kept get• ting phone calls late into the night. And each time 1 picked up, a raspy voice that sounded remarkably like my brother while holding a handkerchief in front of his mouth. The voice would ask, \What's the dif- ference between New Jersey and Union women?\ He would repeat the question over and over until I Weijl in hysterics, and all I could think to say was \The bathroom's down the hall on your right.\ But this time, the voice was different. This time, there was . something different about it.\ The dif- ference· was this time the call wasn't collect. What the phone caller told Driscoll was that \Things had gone on too long.\ He couldn't let the situation go . on any longer, because of ·~certain reasons.\ 'j Ask the Eq_ert was a fake;\ the voice said. 11 Dr. Birnbach doesn't wl'ite them. He's not even in the country any more, but somewhere in Switzerland.\ So Driscoll did some ex- tensive research, including calling Swiss information for the .telephone number of Or. Nof;inan Birnbach. Finally he was able to locate the reclusive expert. \I feel terrible about it,\ said Dr. Birnbach. \I never ·wrote one of those columns. And yet, people read them - some, even thought they were-funny. But, I had nothing whatsoever to do with any of them; All I did was sign a contract saying that They and Co. could use my name and picture, while I would get lots of money, fame, and a beautiful chalet in Switzerland. I really do feel I owe the school a lot.\ When asked about the millions of dollars that he had already banked, Birnbach said, \I said I owed the school - I didn't say how much. Besides, if I take the money out now, I'd have to return the neat gifts I got just for opening up an account.\ In the future, Bimbach said, he would write his own columrls, as long as everybody gets \off my back abou:t being a male chauvenist!

KRUTOFF Associate Arts Editor · Like some have difficUlty choosing a fine wine, I find it extraordinarily difficult to decide which aceolades are most befitting Mark Rust's fine Coffeehouse performance last Friday. Fabulous and stupendous are mere words. Only those who experienced his performance .will find meaning in my praise. For the rest I shall attempt to be more explicit. Firstly, let me say that the people responsible for Col- . feehouse are to be congratulated. In addition to bringing top notch performers like Mark Rust to the campus and satiating our sweet tooths with fresh doughnuts, coffees and teas, they are keeping. a dying art form alive. While coffeehouses around the world are dying,. it is refreshing to f!nd Union's own to be thriving. This intimate style ~£performance is unfortunately being lp~t to the mass-market appeal of television. The sell-out crowd stood en masse to cheer Mark Rust back iilto th~ spotlight for an encore. \All of Us\ his encore, was a fait accompli. after such moving, touching, melodic and often amusing . songs such as \The High Trapeze\ \The Music Man\ \The Class Reunion\ and \Here's to My Sister\. EspecialJy favored were \I'll -Remember Harry\ written in memory of Harry .Chapin and my own personal favorite, \Real Reasons, Real Causes\. Rust's musical talents are varied. He writes his own material; plays guitar, barijo, piano and· the dulcim~r--a rarely played instrument thatis a kind of embryonic piano.- My praise for ms vocal abilities is immense. He possesses a clear, strong voice which he has eX· plored to such an extent that he is capable of changing his in· tonation from sentimental to humorous within seconds: On a personal note, I'd like to tell Mark Rust that his new sneakers were just fine. For those who. missed his per· formance, he will be back at Union on January 14th. His performance is a rare treat. It is not to be missed twice.

THE ARTS Proudly Present GARY U.S. B.ONDS ... .-'' ''\~ .. 1~·· THE DADS Monday, Nov. 1· 8 P .·M. at Proctors ¢ GENERAL CREW MEETING TODAY AT 4:30 IN 55016 • Concert CommHtee Members can pick up their tickets at the meeting ALBUM REVIEW: DIRE STRAITS: LOVE OVER GOLD By TIM EMSWILER Staff The English . band Dire Straits made quite a splash on the music scene back in 1978 with their debut album, DIR STRAITS, and the hit song from that albUIIl, \SUltans of Swing.\ At that time, the band consisted of Mark Knopfler on vocals and lead guitar, brother David Knopfler on rhythm guitar, John tllsley on . bass, and Pick Withers on drums. The same lineup appeared on the band's second album, COMMUNIQUE, which unfortunately suffered at the hands of the critics. On their . 1980 release,· MAKING MOVIES, Dire·· Straits was a three-man band, David Knopfler having left .for other ventures. Keyboards on this album were handled by Roy Bittan of Springsteen's E. Street Band. This album did quite well, with such tunes as \Tunnel of Love,\ \Skateaway and \Expresso Love\ receiving a fair amount of radio airplay. With or WithOut the aid of radio, th~ band's latest album. LOVE OVER GOLD, should establish the band even more firmly w!th American audiences. Interestingly, there are now five members of Dire Straits: Knopfler, Illsley, and Withers are joined here by Alan Clark on keyboards and Hal Lindes on 'rhythm guitar. This certainly has alot to do with the f~er, NEW; oorrn & ... richer sound the band has at- tained on this album. Mark Knopfler bas established himself as a fine. technical guitarist and now seems to be concentrating more on sound than fury. Side two begins with a very upbeat, hot dance number called \Industrial Disease.\ The circus-like organ holds the tune together, but what really sets the song apart is Knopfler's guitar. In spite of the serious subject matter, the tone of the song is tongue-in-cheek, and shows off well, Knopfler's sharp sense of humor. ' The title cut, \Love Over Gold,\ is quite pretty with more classical guitar and cryptic lyrics. I feel it is the weakest tune on the album. The final song, \It Never Rains,\ is also quite upbeat, with nice organ and a very hot guitar solo. Like \Telegraph Road,\ This SQng ends with an extended in- strwnental jam, and the story told in the lyrics is tlle most powerful I have ever heard I• this band. The first S()ng, \Telegraph Road,\ is, at slightly over 14 minutes, the longest of the five songs that appear on tne album. I also feel thatit is the strongest selection, due to many of the changes in telllpo and in mood through which the song passes. The song t>egins very quietly, with high synthesizer notes in front of a low rumbling organ, joined by a piano and a very pretty acoustic g11itar. The electric guitar leads which come in later in the song are extremely clear with a liquid quality about tllern. The melody and the lyrics are reminiscent of some of BrtLce Springsteen's slower songs, especially in light This album seernr to indicate of the singer's promise to that Dire Straits 1s exploring rescue the girl from the ugly some musical paths which are streetlife. The song jams right strang.e lo them. It is a finely along at the end, with an ex- produced album, and its few tended, cry$tal clear guitar weak points are easily solo, nice piano work, · and overlooked in light of the ex- sharp, heavy dr.wnming. Lyrics pertise demonstrated. There is such as \I've got a right to nv doubt that Mar}t Knopfler is work.but there's no work here to a son~ n riting force to be be found,\ provide social reckonecwith;in fact, he wrote commentat·y. all the s\lngs on all four of the - groups albums.

Page 10 CONCORDIENSIS, October 14~ 198S - . . . . . . - . FourukJ at l!nion {;_allege 1877 ------------- ~------~--- Commentary Defense Commentaries are oplnlon pieces written by concerned students. The positions taken by these individuals do not reflect the views .of the newspaper and its Editorial Board. The Comme:n.tary section is designed to pro.vide a forum for expression · available to all. TJUs is the responsibility of the newspaper. This is also a freedom that must be promoted by an educated community. · Often, works on this page incite near-riots. Occasionally, readers disagree With the stance taken. Is it not our duty or rather obligation to provide different perspectives? We are sometimes accused of printing erroneous material irresponsibly. But our critics speak with the advantage of hindsight and do not realize the shortage of FBI investigators. And what of the question of censure? Our editorial meddling could seriously compromise the purpose of such a concept. _ Perhaps a new policy must be formulated. We cannot dismiss outright the suggestion for an Editorial Review Board. In fact we wotll.d welcome the company of anyone at three o'clock in . the morning when editorial policy is decided upon. But to point out a simple fact, the newspaper does have a publisher. The. students of the College are our publishers for they provide the monies necessary to our existence. It is their input that is a must, according to normal journalistic practice, and no1 that of faculty and administrators. Frolll Bad to Worse The release of the latest unemployment figures has stuned the nation. Discounting so-called ''discouraged'' workers and those who have accepted part-time employment when faced with no means of support, over eleven million Americans are out of work. This situation seems distant to the average college student because he or she will enter into a field with appreciably less chaos. Unemployment rates for professional and technical positions are minimal when compared to blue-collar figures. But the long-term predictions will knock your socks off and perhaps inspire actlQn. The Bureau of Labor statistics predict that by the year 1990, the economy will not be able to find places for over three million college graduates. If you think that times are tough now, wait until you face the prospects for career advancement and changes. That is, unless you do something about it. As that obnoxious advertising campaign reminds us, \you can pay now (in terms of concern and effort) or you can pay later.\ ,_ LETTERS Nydegge:r ·Responds To the Editors: I am writing to express my dismay over the publication of an article ln the 'Com· mentaries\ section of the October 7, 1982 edition of Concordiensls. The article to . , . which I refer was entitled ''A Waste af Time'', and was written by a Mr~ Mart-in Sands of your staff. That the piece :was placed in the section it was does , not excuse the fact that it was the most irresponsible article I have ever seen published in a campus newspaper. . · Mr. Sands proclaim~ his. intellectuar integrity by · suggesting that he is among a minority of students who select courses on their merit and not on tne probability of receiving a good grade. If this be the case I think he deserves credit, and I certainly agree that academic rigot is a · suitable ~opic for discourse. It is., however, at this. point that I become very con- cerned. Mr. Sands, in order tQ make his point, refers to a course that his roommate took last year and named the course and the professor specifically. He suggested that the course had very few requirements and that his roonunate rarely attended and still received a B plus. Mr. Sands goes on to say, and I quote, \Well his parents were very proud and the ignorance of the professor was confirmed.'' I truly and sincerely hope that Mr. Sands and the editors of Concordy realize how irresponsible, inapprQpriate and ridiculous such ·statements are. In the first place, I feel that it is simply inappropriate to discuss specific courses and professors in such a way in the pretext of jaur~listic freedom. I wonder if Mr. Sands would find it appropriate for another reporter to write that he-she overheard a professor belittling Mr. Sands' intelligence, and A Retraction To the Editors: In regard to last ·week's commentary \A Waste of Time\ I would like to reevaluate what' was written and extend a sincere· apology to the Psychology Department and to Professor Calabria, especiany. As was not my in- tention, a great deal of meaning in the article was lost because of my seHish attempt to pre~ent a controversial issue and support . it with fact. In contrast to an unplanned implication made in the article, the Psychology Department at Union is composed of a very intellectual and honorable staff. For example, Professor Calabria, Professor Girdner, Professor HUiltley and Professo~ Spring all have their Pb.Ds from excellent graduate schools including New York University, Duke University, and Harvard. Therefore, it. would be foolish of anyone to believe that Union's Psychology Department is .incompetent. It . · is far from that. In fact, in the past few years, the department has made great strides in academic superiority. As a result, more and more students have become Psychology majors or, at least, taken caurses in . a department that . they would have once never considered. Unfortunately, my article \A. Waste of Time\ seemed to have implied that Professor Calabria · was ignorant and the depart- Continued on page ll then ·publish that in the paper. Further, and more i.Inportantly, how in the world· could Mr. Sands ever pretend to have the bac~ground., knowledge, education or experience to judge the intelligence of . a professor who received a Ph.D~ from one of the really fine graduate in$titutlon$. in this country? That degree of pretentiousness .truly does amaze me. Finally, . · I should like to suggest why Mr. Sands wrote the article, and to provide some information that he .con• veniently omitted. Although he proclaims that he never .resorts · to taking courses that appear easy, and then mentions a course specifically as being a ''Waste of Time\ he does not mention that he took the course in question in the Spring of 1982. He does say that his roommate did not work very hard arid yet received a B plus; however, he neglects to say tharhe rec.eived a lesser grade in the· same class. Further, he does not saythat-he called me at home after the Spring term demanding a change of grade and that I outlined the procedures that he. could follow if he wanted· to pursue the matter. Finally, he , does not tell us that he talked further with tlie professor in question, and that the professor very carefully explained the grade and its basis. It appears obvious to me that Mr. Sands has seriously abused his position on the paper in order to ~ttack a professor who gave him a grade he did not like. I feel very strongly that. we of the Union College community can neither condone nor even tolerate such behavior. This Is, without question, the most serious breach of journalistic ethics I have ever enco~tered, and I think that it must be dealt with. Mr. Sands' questionable motives notwithstanding, there is no justification nor excuse for the editors to have published the .·· -. article. I will not demand an apology, for even that would be inappropriate - • the damage has been done. I would, however, s~ggest that ,resignations of all responsible parties . would not l>e· inap- propriate, · What we have here is not a question . of journalistic freedom. There is q.uite a dif~ ference between freedom and license, because freedom fm. plies responsibility, ·which is certainlY not in evidence in the publication .JJf · .Mr. Sands' article. It Should: be noted that Concordy is not a student paper,. but rather a Campus paper, and its constituents are not just the students but the whole Campus community .. Thus to insure that Concordy fulfills it-s charge and .puplic responsibility, I am formally requesting that .the Administration stud:y the possibility of creating an Editorial Review Board comprised. of students (not Concordy staff), faculty and administrators who will be charged with the responsibility of overseeing the editorial po!ici~s of Concordy. In ad- dition, they will be responsible for hiring ( ~nd_ firing) the Concordy ·staff. I WQuld P.oint out that newspaper editors generally are answerable to a publisher or editorial boatd, and thus what I propose is consistent with normal jour- nalistic practice. I realize that what I am suggesting will be · unpopular but is necessary, I feel, to protect us all against the abuses · and excesses of flagrantly irresponsible journalists who · can voice their opinions as facts and . not have to own the responsibility for the con- sequences of their actions. .

Page 12 OONCO~DIEN818, Octobe·r 1-f, 1981 Drinking Laws Change Job Hunting 1 (CPS)-According tQ the new signs posted · around the stadium, there won't be any more drinking at Universlty of Alabama football games this year. Campus police and local law enforcement officials have geared up to watch fans for telltale signs of carrying booze to the game. At Notre Dame, there's another tough new anti-drinking policy. ·starting this fall, students can .no longer bring alcohol . onto university property. Indiana University is going even farther. University of- ficials are making unannounced \spot checks\ for alcohol at the public areas of campus dorms and fraternity houses to enforce a new no-booze-on-campus rule. Colleges and universities around the country this fall are imposing new tough drinking policies, and are creating new means of making the policies stick. Students who run afoul of the new rules typically face disciplinary actions escalating from reprimands to suspen- sions, with mandatory at- tendence at alcohol education classes. Some schools are tougher: Notre Darners caught violating the school drinking policy are liable for a $100 minimum fine. Not all students are happy about it. Indiana's student government is inviting student complaints against the \raids worrying about students' privacy rights. But the new wave of anti- drinking policies has yet to evoke much student response one way or the other. The admisistrators' abrupt fervor follows drinking law changes in dozens of states over the last three years. Spurred by grassroots groups such as Mothers Against Drunk Drivers (MADD) and in- creasing pressure from New Right coalitions such as Jerry Falwell's Moral Majority, state legislators around the country have enacted. stiffer laws against drunk driv.ers, raised the minimum drinking ages and increased pressure on liquor stores and bars not to sen. alcohol to individuals who are under-age or already ine toxicated, And now colleges, too, are responding to what they call \an increased public awareness of alcohol abuse and demands· for stricter controls.\ \There's definitely a greater level of concern throughout the higher education commUllity to address (alcohol) problems;'' observes Dr. Gerardo Gonzalez, president of Boost Alcohol Consciousness Concerning the Health of University Students (BACCHUS), and director of the Campus Alcohol Infor- mation Center at the University of Florida. · \There's no question we have a big problem,\ Gonzalez says. ''About 90 percent of all college students drink, and we know from studies that 15 to 20 per- cent are problem drinkers.\ He defines a problem drinker as \any student whose use of alcohol results in frequent negative consequences to themselves or to others.\ Although the number of students with alcohol problems appears to have peaked in the last few years, Gonzalez says, \it has stabilized at a drastically high. level.\ Twenty years ago, he points out, only 70 percent of the college students were alcohol drinkers, and only six percent were classified as problem drinkers. Along with public pressure and awareness, college officials- say such statistics have finally prompted them to adopt a \get tough'' attitude towards student drinking. . The University of Maryland, Penn State, Rutgers, Arizona, Yale, the University of Denver, Dartmouth, and St. Bonaven- ture are just a few of the colleges struggling to develop or update their alcohol policies this year. Maryland, for instance, just bannea alcohol from outdoor parties in order to comply with the state's new higher drinking age. Because it would be \far too difficult to effectively monitor\ outdoor parties for ''Mt M '' ys ery · .an Campus Digest News Service The secret is out. Travis is just for mystique. · For a long time, the mention of his name in a 30-second commercial for Levi's blue jeans had many television viewers demanding to know who Travis is, what is he late for and why? The advertisement that stirred up all the questions begain airing in majQr cities around the nation last December. What was so mysterious about it was the last line, \Travis you're a year too late!\ The only hint of who Travis is or might be is the opening shot of a large Victorian house in a desolate scene and the figure of a tnan at the door .. The coma mercial then focuses on a blue- jean fitted woman Who is restlessly waiting in a parked car. A narrator talks about her new. style of jeans by Levi Strauss & Co. When the voice is through with the sales pitch, she turns to the distant house, takes off her cowboy hat and em- phatically utters the famous line. Hundreds !>f letters have beseiged the blue jean company with questions about Travis' identity. One California woman said she was writing upon suggestion of her pyschiatrist who said she would probably be well as soon as she can find out the truth about Travis. Levi Strauss & Co. have not been too willing to let the truth out. A standard form letter sent to all queries simply states the woman in the commercial is demonstrating her in- dependence and self-confidence by saying what she does, and the specifics of the Travis line must remain a mystery. What the company does not tell the curious viewers is that the Travis response is really meaningless~ The commercial's writer, Michael Koelker of Foote, Cone & Bending,. l{onig, Levi's ad agency, said he used the ending to intrigue people enough so they Would think about the commercial for a few seconds after the television had gone on to something else. · A second Levi commercial is now out and Travis again is the mystery star. The same woman and the same blue jeans are there, too. But this time, the woman sets fire to an envelope and lets it drop to the ground. As the camera closes in on the smaU bla~e, the name Travis is seen in the address. umfer-age drinkers, says Sandy Neverett, assistant resident life director., the school has banned drinking altogether at such events. The University of Arizona has cracked down on student party- goers too, warning them that it is illegal to transport or con- sume alcohol in university vehicles. When student government officials. were recently caught with 20 cases of beer in a univetsityoowned station wag,on, UA Garage Manager James Dittmars called the action \intolerable and issued a severe warning to the perpetrators. St. Bonaventure hasjoined80 . other New York colleges which are reevaluating their alcohol policies in light of a state-wide crackdown on drinking, which included raising the drinking age from 18 to 19. In a,ddition to banning booze at football games, the University of Alabama will try to curtail aU drinking at outdoor parties and concerts, says spokesman Mike Ellis. ''Alcohol is a problem on any campus,\ says Notre Dame Heal~h Services Director Peggy Cronm. \The whole pressure thing at a competitive university like Notre Dame multiplies the possibility · of alcohol abuse. We're asking ouselves 'What can we do about alcohol abuse?' We don't expect everyone to stop drinking, but we do want each student to find out if drinking is for him, and if so how much.\ \We've consulted and we've talked and we've listened to students, and yet we never got a real program developed,\ says Michael Schardein, assistant dean of students at Indiana University. ''As soon as the university started backing off and saying to the students 'You can take responsibility for the problem,' we found that the students backed off too.\ Consequently, the ad- ministration recently s~ply forbade all drinking at the school .. \We aren't foolish enough to , believe that Indian~ University students are't going to touch a drop of alcohol for the four years they're here,\ Schardein admits. \But in terms .of van- dalism, students flunking out, and several tragedies a year of people coming home drunk from parties, we think it (the new policy) will make a dif- ference.\ . Still, alcohol experts like Gonzalez stress that students must be involved in the alcohol programs, \If you· don't have the student involvement and support,\ he adds, \I don't care how good your policy is, it won't work.\ With more than 10 million Americans out of work, the competition for jobs is really getting keen. Even minimum wage j~bs are highly ~ught­ after, sometimes by people who have earlier had jobs which paid much more than minimum wage. Unemployment benefits .are getting harder to come by, as well as welfare, and this is increasing the competition for minimum wage -jobs as well. In some parts of the country, a single job opening will attract several hundred applicants. As jobs become more scarce., people who are out-of- work tend to lower their sights as far as matching their previous salaries go. The more job Interviews they come away from without getting the job, the more likely they are to take a pay cut just to get a job, figuring any income is better than none. The retail field is one where jobs are highly sought-after now.

The University of Mississippi's Qfficial m~scot and the Confederate symbols .its fans like to use at football games are Under . siege by alumni, a cheerleader and a .civil rights group. Baylor's two mascots, meanwhile, have fought each other to the death in- front of a TV camera. At Mississippi, one of the school's most · famous graduates-James Meredith, now 49---has threatened to sue the university .if it doesn't stop using the rebel flag, the song \Dixie and a mustacbioed Colonel Rebel as its symbol$. Mere.dith threatened to sue in a letter accepting an invitation , to celebrate . the 20th an- .niversary of Ole , Miss' desegration. Meredith, of course, was the first black student admitted to the school. Meredith told the Da-ily Mississippian, the student newspaper, that the symbols of . the Confederacy..,...and, by extension, of slavery-were · offensive to blacks; and that he was .further upset by an article · · in a student quarterly magazine. The article discussed Ole Miss black student attitudes towards Ole Miss white students. _ Merdith's antipathy toward the symbols, which National Association for the Advan- cement of Colored Poeple field director Robert Walker agreed was \offensive to black people and other progressives,\ was not the first public con- demnation of the mascots this year. In August, John Hawkins, who is Ole Miss' fii\st black cheerleader, made headlines by refusing to carry the rebel flag onto the football field With other cheerleaders. But after Meredith's threat, Blaclt Student Union President Lydia. Spargin said Meredith wasn't acting ~s a represen- tative of current Ole Miss students. \The black student leaders,\ she told a pres$ conference, \are surprised that Meredith is (planning to file) a suit in our behalf.\ At the same conference, alumni association President Jim Ingram said the laws\Ut threat-w~s \not what I would expect of a good alwnnus.\ Hawkins, now the Black Student Unions's vice.president, prefers a different approach to replacing the symbols. \The black students need to make suggestions and make a stand as a group, \Hawkins who in- dicated he felt isolated when he refused to carry the flag, told the Mississippian. Black students should \do it slowly, start small and w.ork their way up\ to convincing the wti.versity to drop the symbols. For the moment, university administrators won't comment on \matters of pending loans Defaulted (CPS)-Federal attorneys in the ''City of Brotherly Love\ have impounded the ~ars of 17 Philadelphia-area residents who collectively owe some $50,000 in student loan p-ayments. Federal marshalls _say they'll keep the cars until the defaulters either pay off or make arrangements to pay off their loans. The action is just a part of a nationwide crackdown by the U.S. Dept. of Education on defaulters who owe a total of $3 billion in overdue guaranteed and direct .government student loans. By late-September, the department will also have a computer to help push the collection effort farther. Philadelphia officials hope their car towing Will help make the point.- \We're doing whatever we can to get these people to pay off their debts to the government,\ says Peter Vaira, U.S. Attorney for the nine-county Philadelphia area. \We;re going to garnish wages, impound cars and take whatever proerty we can get our hands on to get these people to pay up.\ Vaira has struck a tough-guy approach to loan collection before. In April, 1981 he sued 102 area defaulters to get the government's money back~ Over 600 people have since ignored \repeated notices that ·they need to come in and take care of delinquent loans,\ Vaira says. Vaira readily admits the tow- away action was aimed at scaring other defaulters. \It had an electric effect on the whole community,\ he says. ''It woke a lot of people up and got them in here. So many .people take the attitude that 'since the government doesn't come after us, we don't have to worry about the loan money we own.' I think this shows them we will come after them.\ GARFIELD® t by Jim Davis litigation.\ But spokesman Ed Meek noted, \To my knowledge, 'Dixie' is a copyrigllted song and .not the property of the university, nor is the rebel flag.\ Over the last decade, a number of schools have dropped athletic imagry that offends some of their students. Stanford and Dartmouth, for example, both dropped Indian symbols out of respect for Native Americans' feelings. At Dartmouth, conservative students are trying to convince the school to re-adopt the old symbol. At Stanford, some alumni have mounted a similar campaign, even. to the extreme of sneaking an Indian on hor- seback into Stanford Stadium during a football game last October. Marquette replaced its \Willie Wampum\ mascot with a more dignified · \Fist Warrior\ several years ago. And last year Imperial Valley College in California finally dropped its school mascot, the Arab, on the grounds it was offensive to Arab students. But while alumni-, students and admisistrators fought over mascots, at Baylor the mascots fought each other to the death. In late August Baylor's new mascot, a 55-pound bear named Chuck, was mauled tQ death by retired bear mascot Judge, now a 700 pound adult. The incident occured when the TV crew of PM Magazine arrived on campus to do a segment on the bears. The crew put the two in the same play area. But just as the cameras started rolling, Judge-who has been retired for two years but who still has a Baylor home in thanks for leading the school to the 1974 Cotton Bowl-abruptly attacked Chuck, who had been scheduled to make his public debut this fall. \Chuck was just going through his training, and was doing quite well,\ mourns Baylor spokesman Spencer Gross. \The TV people wanted Chuck and Judge to be photographed together. We don't really know why, but dllring the filming Judge at• tacked and killed Chuck.\ \Judge has generally been an easymgoing kind of bear,\ Gross adds. . Baylor has replaced Chuck with Chuck. II. Chuck II will probably serve for two years, when he'll be too big to handle, and will be given to a zoo, Gross says. Judge, meanwhile, \Has been very well-behaved since the incident,\ and will continue to live at Baylor. By contrast the University of Houston retired its cougar, Shasta IV, in 1980 because it was \too agressive\ and in- dulged in \conduct not befitting a UH mascot.\ Record stores in California brought to light the . new phenomenon as its popularity started soaring. Record stores- such as Music Odyssey in· Los Angeles rent out new records for $1, Customers ate renting out the recordsJ taking them home and recording them on their own cassette or eight- track tapes, tb.ereby . saving _ anywhere from $6-$12, after buying the blank tapes. iH£ CAPEO.

While John Kenneth Galbraith is left of the center, Michael Novak is right, Novak has been described as one -of the ground-breaking in:t,ellectuals in the neo-conservative movement but he describes himself as a . neo·liberal. Novak was born in John- stown, Pennsylvania. He began his college career with the in- tention of becoming a Jesuit priest but backed out before ordination. He graduated (rom Stonehill College, the Gregorian University in Rome, Catholic University and Harvard University, where as a teacher . and a student he earned his M.S. in 1966. Novak also taught at Stanford University for three years. Two of those years he was voted \the most influential professor\ by the senior · class.. . Until 1978 Novak was the Ledden-Watson Distinguished Professor of Reli~ion at Syracuse Umversity and 1s now a Resident Scholar at • 1 the . American Enterprise nst:tute in Washington, D.C. . Hts intellectual career has IDcluded anti-war activism and · speechwriting for- Sargent Shriver, Edmund Muskie, and George McGovern. In 1973~7 4 he was invited to launch a new humanities program for the Rockefeller Foundation. In both 1981 and 1982. Novak was ap- pointed by President Reagan as the Chief ofthe US Delegation to the UN Human· Rights Com- mission Meeting in Geneva. Novak has written two novels and several books. His most recent book, The Spirit of Democratic Capitalism has been received favorably by the critics. Novak is scheduled to appear here at Union the 25th, of October. The appearance of Galbraith· and Novak are sponsored by a grant from the Shelby-Cullom-Davis Found- ation. Professor Finkelstein of the History Department received the grant for a program · entitled \Social Aspects of America~ Capitalism., This contrast of opinions between Galbraith and Novak parallel an amiable difference of opinions between Professors Reynolds and Phaup in our Economics Department. Professor Reynolds identifies with Galbraith and Professor Phaup leans more toward Novak's ideology. Horoscopes • • • Continued from page 4 CAPRICORN (Dec. 2! 19): • Jan. . active role in your life.

< i Page 16 WOMEN'S SPORTS Undefeated at Net By SPORTS STAFF ' The women's tennis team has continued its fine performance this season by tallying a record of 6-1. The Dutchwomen have played an aggressive baseline game, compilingthe .best record of any womerl' s tennis team in the history of Union College. According to Coach Arakelian, \The team has shown a strong will to win. They're the finest group of women I've ever coached.\ The team traveled to Oneonta last Wednesday and were once again victorious by a score of 5 to 2. On Saturday, October 9, the Dutchwomen trounced Russell Sage by a score of 7 to 0. The first home match against Vassar proved to be more challenging for the team. The loss of No. 2 singles player, Beth Houseman, to injury was damaging for Union's chances. Although Nancy Judson did a fine job replacing Beth at ·the number two spot, the Vassar opponent proved . to be too · strong. AlthOugh the Dut- chwomen fought valiantly, Julie Miller at No.1 singles proved to be the only winner for Union. She. beat her Vassar opponent 6- 4, 6-4, making it a remarkable victory considering the Vassar player placed 2nd in the N.Y.S. Collegiate Tennis Tournament last year. Individual records have been outstanding this season. Co- captain, Julie Miller, playing first singles has proved to be an important factor in the team's record, amassing an undefeated record in all seven matches. Second singles, Beth Houseman, has been a key element in the Dutchwomen' s victories, compiling an un- defeated record in the first five matches. Thrtfd and fourth singles Rita Lindenburg and co- captain Pam Marcus also scored major victories, bringing their records to 5-2 and_ 4-3,. respedively. Ftfth singles, 'Alissa (Gutsy) Calabria, has shown great will to win and has compiled a record of 5-2. Veteran Linda Esposito has proved to be a versatile player, winning decisive victories in both singles. and doubles. ·· A recent addition to the team, Karen Gebhardt, has been a valuable asset, pairing off with both Nancy Judson and Cathy Furst at first doubles. Switching off at doubles, Cathy Furst, Carol Verden, and Peggy Belanoff have added to the team's depth. The doubles teams scored important vic- tories against Russell Sage and Oneonta. The Dutchwomen are Making Tracks By Sports Staff The women's cross country team is now .500 for the season. They lost their first meet on Saturday, October 2 to nationally ranked Middlebury College in spite of Inge \Ruby\ Stockman's new course record of 16:53 for the grueling 2.85 coqrse, which placed her third overall. Following closely were Danielle \the animal\ Cherniak (16:41) and fres~an Chris \Legs\ Siler (16:56) finishing fourth and sixth. Running fourth and fifth for Union were Janice \Rhonda\ Glidden and Joan \Klutz\ O'Connor. Sue \Skellar\ ·· Stopera, Kathy \Smiley\ Healy and Jenny \Wrong Way\ Snover also ran well for Union. The women were not discouraged by this loss and made a comeback in the quadrangular meet this past Saturday, October 9 against Williams, Trinity, and Smith at Trinity· by beating Trinity and Smith. Again Ruby led the Harriers over the soggy, windy, chilly course with her terrifying 'zen • yell and a time of 18: 13 for 3.0 miles. \Legs\ outstrided 3 girls in the last 3 /4 mile uphilll stretch finishing with a time of 18:39. When asked why she did so well she replied, \I had to pass those frickin' girls or else Russ would make me stay in on Friday nights.\ Rhonda, battlie multiple injuries, ran well to impress her family who came to counting on continued sucf.)ess.

Be there to cheer tlte squadron. Last Thursday, the team travelled through the Berkshires to face Williams and North Adams at North Adairu!. The first match was against Williams, a traditionally strong foe, in their home territory. Union was very sluggish thru the beginning game and finally did start to come around, but to Emily Monosson feeds it to the forward line for the seventh goal in the game against V13ssar.

The next two games gave the fans there something, to remember. Cheri Wong and Natalie Stone provided the spark that .got the team up. Laura Barrish played an ex- cellent net game and :premia Hugick as well as Karen Roth turned in beautiful defensive plays. Union walked away a winner from North Adams and with some valuable experience that will be needed as they travelled to Albany on October 12. The squad now has a 5-6 overall r.ecord and ~ be looking to improve upon it. For those of you up and about on Homecoming Saturday mor- ning, the team goes against Pace at 11 a:m. in the Field House. It promises to be an intetesting contest. Back on the Roll By KATHY DUFFY Sports Staff After a tough string of away games~ the Union stickers are · back on the winning road. Monday night the team finally put their winning act back together to defeat Vassar College in a 2-0 shutout. Last week the Dutchwomen had suffered some heartbreaking losses, losing to both Oneonta and Russel Sage in overtime. Coach Marty Morrison, disappointed in the team's performance last week, at- tributed the losses to the team's failure to play with intensity for the first half of the games. She • pointed out the obvious necessity that the team is missing, saying that no team can win if they don't play 70 minutes of all-out hockey. Vassar is the first game where the team has successfully maintained this intensity. Saturday's Sage game was lost in a flickoff after a double overtime failed to determine the winner. The Dutchwomen had come from behind in the second half to tie the game up one to one. Despite Union's domination after the first half of play the team was not able to put the ball in the goal again. The flick off ended .. a disap- pointing 2-3, giving the game to Sage. In the Vassar game, the full team effort that existed on the field was reflected on the scoreboard. Goalie Kathy Bently was able to relax as the. offensive end was seeing all the action the entire game. Emily Monosson contintlally worked the ball up the field and fed. it in to the forward line, making it possible for the 7 goal final tally. Emily was also able to put two goals in unassisted. Sue Ensel had a perfectly executed goal on a penalty comer shot drive from Diane Moskaluk's pass. Diane, who tallied the only goal in the Sage game, also scored in the scond half of the Vassar match. Freshman Cheryl Washburn who assisted Diane in the Sage game goal also had the first goal of the Vassar game. Link Holly Howard had a strong game against . Vassar, scoring on a pass from Carolyn Gilbert in the first half and then later assisting Marcy Viener for the fifth goal. The amount of scoring in the Sage game will hopefully prove itself a catalyst, sparking a desire to score and maintain intensity in the up- coming game. Wednesday's match will be a tough one as the Union team faces RPI·on the turf at 4:00. Then the A and B teams will travel to Siena on this coming Saturday. The Dutchwomen will be working to bring their 4-4 record over the .500 mark in their next game. To Union students we say come cheer us on. To the stickers we say: Go for it-ladies! Astrrd Morshe and ·the rest of tile soccer team fought hard against Siena but could hot g!'lin vi(:tory (5-0). A comeback match will be played against Skidmore tonight at 7:00 on the turf.

While the NFL players strike has stifl~d pro football, the entire sports world has focused its attention to baseball and its fall classic. the World Series. This year's champitmship will feature the speed of the Car- dinals and the power of the Brewers. This year's Series is also a matchup of \less fillii1g vs. great taste.\ You might wonder why I'm talking about beer in.a baseball article. This series also matches the citles which produce the number one and two selling beers in the nation. -St. Louis is the home of Bud- weiser while Milwaukee is the home of Miller Beer, the nwnber two selling beer in the countrv behind Bud. No matter how this series ends up, one's sure to know that a lot of Buds and Millers will be bet on the outcome and con- ~ sumed by fans all over America. But the question still stands: \less filling or taste great\? To those fans of the Brewers, the power throughout Eastern Division Champs order \taste great!'' Power hitting is the key ingredient that has brought Harvey's Wallbangers this far. Milwaukee has big sticks throughout the lineup in the likes of Cooper, Yount, Sim- mons, Oglivie and Thomas. These four alone averaged 31 homers and 109 RBI's apiece for the regular season. The brewers as a team led the majors in both runs scored and homeruns. The Brewers also have a fine pit- ching staff to back this awesome power production. Mike Caldwell, who pitched in the opening game of the series, Pete Vukovich and reliever Rollie Fingers are mainstays on a staff that has a combined ERA of 3.91. crew be tough to beat If their power and strong pitching holds up against the Cardinals. The people of St. Louis believe that ''less filling\ will ovellcome. great taste in this •best of 7 \suds series.\ 'l'he Cards, in contrast to the Brewers, are a team that has been built around speed. Whtey Herzog's squad led the NL in stolen bases with 200. - The Cards are a teiliD that will single, double, triple and sacrific.e their way to victory. A perfect example is Cardinal first baseman Keith Hernandez. He hitonly 7homeruns this year while getting an amazing 94 RBI's. The Cards' order is packed with players like Ozzie Smith, Willie McGee and George Hendrick, aU who possess great hitting and nmning abilities. One would have to give the edge to the Cardinal pitching staff that is red hot at this time. Andujar;' Forsch and Murra are all pitching the beSt baseball of their careers. But the strongest asset of Herzog's staff is the bullpen. Bruce Sutter, ·who pitched fine ball in the ·playoffs. led the majors in saves with .36. The Cardinals \less filling\ pitching and speed might well prevail in a seven game series with Milwaukee. One must also. r.emernber that the Brewers ace. reliever Bollie Fingers has yet to pitch in a postseason game for the Brewers. The Brewers have also shown to go cold at times this season, and the timely pitching of the Cards could cause this once again. But Hey! those zany sports celebrities haven't answered ·ByD.D.

Club came storming back from an early six-point deficit to defeat HQbatt by a score of 1()-G. A strong offense and a tough defense assured the Union ruggers their second victory against one loss. Initially it was all. Hobart as they scored early on two penalty kicks. But down by six, the llislting Gamet ruggers .gained their composure and turned the entire game around. Shortly after Hobart's second penalty kick, Union brought the ball back . upfield into Hobart territory. Here a penalty was called on the home team and Union had its first scoring opportunity .of the game. Russ BackhQuse split the uprights with a thirty-five yard place- kick cutting the Hobart lead in half. From this point on it was all Union. The Garnet club quickly tired thier opposition with a surging serum and a dodging line. Again the ball was moved into Hobart territory and Union was giv.en another opportunity on a penalty. Once more Backhouse made good his penalty kick and the score was even. This was not it for Union though. With Hobart deep in the lJnion end, trying to put itself back on top, a tough defense not only ·stopped the surge, but it was able to bring the Union team to another score. Suddenly Aaron Schleifer, who had several. amazing runs in the game, popped out of a maul with the ball and sprinted sixty yards downfield before. being brought out of bounds within ten yards of the goal line; After a line-out and a five-yard serum• down, Union's Carl Aiken plunged· over the goal line for a try. The conversion was missed, but Union was on top to stay with a 10-6 lead. The second half turned out to be similar to the club's first two outings as the Garnet ruggers' defense took over. In an of its three games, Union has yet to allow a single point scored in the second half. This was evident Saturday because while the Hobart players were wiping the sweat off their foreheads, Union was hustling and forcing ' mistakes l)y the opposition. '11le one serious threat that Hobart could muster was quickly quelled as Union strolled to their second victory. In the second game, Union With several Robart players filling in, dropped a close game 9-3. Bob W aaler accounted for all the Garnet scoring as he made good a penalty kick from thirty yards out midway into the first half. Union did have other opportunities but .failed to take advantage of them for needed points. Looking forward to the relit of the season. co-capt~in John Tierney commented, \We've won two straight now and it looks like our continued success is inevitable.\ He alSo stressed the fact that the team is always looking for more players and that people interested in playing in the Spring should come out now to get some experience and a couple of games under their belts. This upcoming weekend the club will face two tough challengers. First it will play Hamilton and then move on to a stacked alumni team. Both games will be home on Library Field this Saturday. New York•$ OldestQRivalry Continued from page 20 record, is 2-1-1. \I think maturity has been the biggest difference in this year's success,\ says Bagnoli. \The players are a year wiser.\ Sophomore quarterback Dan Stewart feels that ciJnfidence is among the leading factors for Union's turnaround. \Not only do we have con· fidence in ourselves,\ he began, \but we are confident that the guy next to us will do his job. I know that the offensive line will give me protection and I know that when I do make a mistake the defense will be there to bail me out.\ Bodmer, who has seen the team finish at 3~, 1-7, and 4-4-1 in his previous three years, says flatly, \This is the best team since I've been here. We have maturity and confidence at every position and we realize that_each game is as important as the next.\ Senior safety George Ober- stadt, an ECAC all-star last year, sees a very bright future for Union's program. the drive. In all, Union turned the ball over five times in the first half but won the game 28-7. \When we fumbled and they scored I thought we were in for a repeat of last year,\ said Stewart. ''But when we drove those 62 yards with such ease, well the second fumble didn't matter. We knew we could move the ball and that attitude has carried over with every game.\ Athlete of the Week \I honestly believe that the program is on the upswing. My class only has seven players left from 1979, but the junior class has better numbers and the sophomore and freshman classes have super numbers and talent. If those groups stay together so that wben they graduate the team loses 10 to 15 players in one year, well that is what gives a team consistency and backbone.\ Union's offense has been able to move the ball with a great deal of consistency. So far the Dutchmen have gained 1573 total yards. Stewart has passed for 710 with receiiers Rich Kellaher and Walt Frederick getting most of the action, but the running game has been equally as good; ByD.HURLEY. Sports Staff For the second time this school year, Athlete of the Week honors are shared by two Union College student-athletes. This week's recipients are Russ Backhouse of the rugby-football club and George Oberstadt of the Dutchmen football team. Russ Backhouse has been a big asset for the rugby football cluh To date, Backhouse has scored 11 of Union's 19 points and was instrumental in the scorihg of four more: Against Albany Medical .. School, Backhouse kicked a 45- yard penalty kick with only seconds remaining to break a 6- 6 tie and give Union its first win of the season. This past weekend vs. Hobart in Geneva, Backhouse rallied the team back from a 6.() deficit by hitting on t\to penalty kicks to tie the game. Later in the game, he set up Carl Aiken's . game winning try. Union RFC co-captain Keith Dean has nothing but praise for the 5'9\ 170 lb. Backhouse, who is at Union this year on a scholarship fr.om St. Andrews University in Scotland. Dean Russ Backhouse says \When Russ is out on the field he controls the game. Everything seems to revolve around what he does. The inexperienced players are learning a great deal from him.\ Backhouse, who leads the team with 15 solo tackles, has ten years experience playing the game of rugby. What can one say about Dutchman George Oberstadt? He is no .stranger to Athlete of the Week honors, receiving the award in the past for his play in footbaU as well as in baseball. This week the senior· safety was elected to the ECAC's weekly \Honor Roll\ for his performance against Colby last Saturd-ay. Oberstadt, who was twice named to the honor roll last year, and also voted to the ECAC's All-Star Team following. the season, recorded five solo tackles, six assists, had two interceptions and made a key touchdown-saving tackle to ensure Union's 14-3 vi.ctoty over ·Colby. Oberstadt has five in- terceptions in four games, this year and has to his credit at ' least one interception in each of hjs last six games dating back to the .final tw() g~es of 1981. George, . a computer science major, hails from Sandy Hook, · Ct. and is a brother of the Chi Psi Fraternity. Congratulations and best of luck to both Russ and George for the remainder of · their seasons. · Stewart believes that the Dutchmen set the tone for their season in the first half of the season opener at Rochester. On the third 'play from scrimmage, Union fumbled, setting up the Yellowjackets' only touchdown. On the next possession, Stewart guided the offense 62 yards before another fumble stopped Defensively the team h~s · been outstanding. This year's unity has held its opponents to a total of just 855 yards rushing and passing. With four g~es to go, the school record of 22 turnovers, set in 1979, appears in jeopardy as Union has taken the ball away 12 times already this season. Senior wide receiver Walt Frederick summer up the at- titude of the players best when he said, \Union has been the doormat in football for a long time and we don't want to be the doormat anymore.\ From the ALBANY BREWERS SERVED COLI) ll ONTAP . - Ale ASK FOR Down at Newman's Brewery we brew the local beer in the best British, real ale tradition.

Union leads series, 60-15-4 Wooden Shoes By GEORGE CUTIITA Sports Information Director The Union and RPI football teams will combine a birthday with an anniversary when the teams meet as part of Union's 60th Homecoming festivities this Saturday afternoon. The birth is of football at the two schools _while the anniversary celebrates the 80th renewal of New York State's oldest football rivalry. On a November afternoon in 1886 football made its debut for the two colleges, which are 20 miles apart. Though the schools agree on the time and P.lace, they can't agree on the score, as Union's archives show a 4-o, Dutchmen victory while RPI's records indicate an 11-4 Engineer triumph. The first meeting wasn't the only time that the records disagree. RPI lays claim to a 5-4 victory in 1888 that Union says never took place while the Dutchmen boast a 17-o triumph in 1901 that RPI says it never played. Despite the fact that both schools show different records in the long-standing series (Union claims a 60-15-4 ad-· vantage while RPI insists that the margin is only 57-18-4), it all adds up to 79 games that are rich in tradition and have been as intense as any in NCAA history. \ThiS is a very intense rivalry because of its rich tradition and the location of the schools,\ says Union head coach AI Bagnoli. \The players from both teams have to live with the results of that game all year long.\ (Eliphalet Nott, who was Union's president from 1804 unti11866, also served as RPI's president from 1829 until 1845) has always been a friendly one. However, when a few students got out of hand the night before the 1949 game, a joint com- mittee appointed by the Student Council of both colleges met to determine a more constructive channel for the \enthusiasm.\ The committee established the \Dutclunen Shoes trophy\ and awarded it to the winner of the 1950 contest. Its presence has been felt ever since. \The RPI game is the most important game on our schedule,\ says senior defen- sive tackle Steve Bodmer, \and that includes Albany State. Union has a long standing tradition both academically and athletically and the trophy is as much a part of that tradition as any other single thing.\ Sophomore center Eric DeMarco didn't fully appreciate the meaning of last year's game until just before he played in the .21-7 Union victory. \In the locker room you could see how the upperclassmen were reacting and you could feel the atmosphere generated by the crowd when we got to the field for pregame warmups. Now ~ that we have the trophy back ~. (RPI won 1980's game, 14--13) I ~ don't want to lose it.\ ·~ Oberstadt led the defense. Oberstadt, who \all named to the ECAC Honor RoQ,thJ,s week, recorded fiv.e tackles, six assists and two interceptions on. the day. Oberstadt also has at least one interception in his last six games dating back tQ last year. \It wasn't a ,pretty ,game,\ said B· .• gnoli, \But I think it is a sign vi a good football .team when they ,play ~~ ss than their potential and .still :get a witl. That is what happened to 11$.\ This Saturday the Putchtnen will have . to play to their potential when they face the RPI Engineers (2-1-1) in New York State's oldest football rivalry. Union has a com- manding 60-15-4 advantage in the series. The Dutchmen should have no. problem in getting physically and mentally prepared for this g~e. They will try to maintain possession of the illustrious \shoes which they won last year in a 21-7 victory at RPI. They will also be playing . in front of~ their homecoming crowd. S<:ore by penod~.

The key to the match, ex- plained Coach Bill Magee, was · the ability of the Dutchmen to control the pace of the game; During the first half,. the Dutchmen were playing their offense and defense at a fast pace on the quick astroturf. \This is a well-skilled team \ . . ' said Magee. \We can't go at a fast offensive pace. They (the players) did what they had to do and slowed things down in the second half.\ The first half was marked by fairly even play by both teams. Much of the action centered around the mMfield stripe, with the advantage switching back and forth between the squads. ' First half penetration for tbe Dutc~men was cqntinually foiled by the Albany State defense. At the . half, the Dut- chmen had managed three • shots on goal, and the score was tied at o-o. · The second..half of the contest was marked. by an opening of the field of play, as well as the continued strong defensive play. F'mally, after 76 minutes of scoreless.play, Union's Rich Edwards scored from the left side of the penalty box. The shot, deflected by the charging goalkeeper, rolled into the center of the net The game became more physical as both teams pressured to score. Union, 1:\fter surviviijg some fine shots by the Great Danes, struck again with 1:38 remaining in the match. Peter Stegemann scored on a chip pass from Edwards. The shot, from the left side, was low to the ground and out of reach of the charging Albany goalie. With the victory, goalie Mike Harris registered his first collegiate shutout.

Dutchman'·s Shoes: :t------ByGEORGECUTl'ITA..,· -------\' . The Union College- Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute football .rivalry dating back to 1886 is Union's oldest rivalry and one of the oldest in · the country. The rivalry, a keen , but friendly one, has oc- casionally been marred with vandalism and destruction by overly enthusiastic students. When the long-standing relationship between the two colleges had been particularly darkened as the result of destruction on both campuses the .night before the 1948 game, a joint committee appointed by the Student Councils of both colleges niet to determine a more constructive channel for this student enthusiasm. This conunittee set up. a new trophy - a pair of Dutclunan's shoes. The right shoe, given to R.P.I., was painted the COllege colors - cherry with a white R on the toe. The left shoe went to Union where it was painted garnet with a white U on the toe. The winner of the 1949 football game was to receive the other shoe from the loser. In establishing this award, the committee annmmced that it was \for pacifying relations between the schools and -replacing . vandalism . so prevalent in the past with a less destructive and more unified spirit.\ Union won the 1949 game with a score of 14-6 and received the .right shoe from R.P.I. to become the first winner of the trQ:phy. Union continued to defeat R.P .1. for tbe next eight years so that when R.P.I. turned the tide with its 20..19 victory in. 1957, the trophy had been ·forgotten. It was remembered after the .game and . belatedly presented to R.P.I. before the end o( the school year. Although student raids still occur between the two. colleges around the time of the annual football classic, vandalism has all but disappeared in the relations between the colleges. The chllirman of the com- mittee for awarding the shoes in the .June 1949 meeting was James Courter. Also on the committee were: Harry Petrak, John DeBello, Roger Hancher, Martin O'Mera of Union; and five men from R.P.I. headed by Jerry Ellworth, grand marshall of R.P.I. - 10 Years Ago September 20, 1972 \Th w ·w ·w·· \ . e · ay · · e ere By GEORGE BAJN The Union grounds have been transformed into a nameless, northeastern college of 1937 for the shooting of some scenes fr.om the forth<:oming Columbia P1etures' movie. \The Way We Were,\ adapted from ArthW' Laurents' book.

Shooting may last past the original terminal date of next Monday. There has been no contracted financial arrangement between Union and Columbia, but, says Mr. Carman, \the College expects Columbia to suitably grateful'' for the use of the campus. In a letter of A11gust 29, President Harold C. Martin wrote that Union gave Columbia permission to shoot here \thinking that there'll be enough fun and 'profit'-in the form of public relations, if nothing else--to make the prl)ject worth the turmoil it will undoubtedly produce.\ Recently with more advanced methods of destruction in mind, the damage done to campuses has reached a point where the administrations have felt it necessary to take restrictive measures. To bring about more friendly rivalry, stricter rules have been imposed to include the expulsion of anyone who invades the R.P.I. campus with \malice aforethought.\ Tomorrow spectators will probably witness the best brand of football ever displayed between the two colleges. Both teams will employ more ex- perienced players than either Alexander or '86 fields have seen for a long time. For S4)llJ.e men the contest will be the fourth year of com- petition.

.. 2A HOMECOMING WEEKEND, October 15·1\1 !98$ Dutch Pipers .Revived - The Union College Dutch Pipers, a small male vocal ensemble, has recently been reorganized. Originally organized in 1955 as a part of the Men's Glee Club, the Pipers separated from the Glee Club in 1962 and ceased to exist several years ago. The Dutch Pipers are men who are interested in per- forming vocal music and in- terested in promoting college spirit and ties with alumni. The group ~opes to function with the cooperation of the Alumni and the Admissions Offices in order to represent the college at various events throughout the year. This tenn the Dutch Pipers have been rehearsing twice a week and now include in their repertoire barbershop, semi- popular, and traditional music. Soon they will be performing arrangements written for the group by its members. At almost every concertthe Pipers conclude with a performance of the Union College Medley. • Homecoming will mark the . 1982 debut of the Dutch Pipers. In addition to other per- . formances throughout the weekend, the group will be giving a short concert at 12:30, Saturday afternoon, in front of Carnegie Hall. In order to compile a history of the group and rediscov:er old Dutch Pipers songs, the group is interested in making -c.ontact with former Dutch Pipers. Any ' alwnni with helpful infQlJPation should contact the gtoup by writing to box 811. Current members of the Dutch Pipers ·are: Paul Tomazewski, Tom Dalglish, James Marshall, David MaranvUle, Peter del Rosario, Lee Dayton, Brian .Quint, Barry Gilman, John Hadigan, D~m Linday, David Cohen, Christopher Hoople, Timothy Smith, and Don Voss.

• ' . ' CONGORDlENSi:S, Oc.tober 21, 1982 >- .0 0 - 0 .c Q. Robert J. Massa, Director o.f Financial Aid Aids Students By DOUG LANDON News Editor Editor's Note :The following ls the second Installment in a series of articles on College finances. This segment deals with financial ald. Financial aid is probably one 9f the greatest concerns of Union students arid their families, especially in these days.of economic recession. The College's program of assistance enconnpasses naanY sources of funding, and affects every student on campus, whether or not he or she e~periences finan~ial need. Aid at Union consists of three rnajot categories, namely scholarships and grants, loans, and employment· opportun~ty, · according to Director of Ftnancial Aid Robert J. Massa. former students who borrowed under the plan. ''We're on the threshold of a potential problem,\ says Massa, \with proposed cutbacks of money flowing directly to Union and money flowing to the students.'' He a<l:ds that even if Federal programs stayed the same, the students and families would continue to lose ground because of inflation. Union is not making up for the Federal decreases; students and parents are. Trustee Duties Reviewed The mairi source of assistance is the College itself, and. for the 1982-83 academic year $2.4 million has been bud,geted toward the program. $2 million was actually provided {or 1~1~ 82, but that figure was forced to rise as a result of this year's increase in College com;s to students. These figures are comprised of interest from Union's Endowment ($850,000 in '81-'82, $800,000 proposed for '82- '83). 'The remainder of the money is taken from the College's ·General Fund, . and that amowtt · is budgeted to increase from $1 million to $1.52 .million this year. Massa points out that endowment revenue used for aid and annual gifts· is budgeted conservatively, and .if actual amounts exceed those proposed, less ·money will be taken from the 'General Fund. Last year, explains Massa, was a banner year for annual contributions. Tighter restrictions have. also been placed on the Gu.aranteed Student Loan program (GSL ). Now, only i:f one's family in- come is:less than $30,00(1 does he or she automatically qualify for the GSL, In the past year, the number of Union students applying for the GSL. ~as fallen from 1,500 to 1,100. This iS, in many cases, the result of misinformation as to eligibility for the loans, as was · dt:lter- mined by a questionnaire sent by Massa's officetothe parents of 400 students who applied for the GSL in 1981...82 but not 1982~ 83. Some incorrectly thought they no longer qualified, because their incomes ex.ceed $30,000. Even if this is the case, if one shows need l:le or she may very possibly get the loan. The average GSL payment to Union students, though,. over the same year, increased from $1,975 to $2,250 because of the jump in College costs. By MARCY BURSTINER News Editor The elected positions of Junior and Senior Trustees are, next to the Student Body President, the two single most important positions · on the Student Forum. Each year, one member of the junior class is elected into the two-year office of Student 'I;_rustee. There are two Student Trustees on the Forum and they act, according to William Morris. Advisor to the Forum, as a \conduit of information flowing both ways\ from the student body, via the Forum, to the Board of Trustees. Their job is to represent the school by gathering student feelings and giving the \student side of issues\ in discussions before the Board of Trustees. The student body, according to David Wollin, a student who had previously run for the position of Trustee, did not always have representation on the Board. The position of Student Trustee originated in the ~ampus tl,U'bulence of the Vietnam era. The student body, a:t that time, demanded more representation on Board decisions and was allowed to elect two students to join the Board. These studentS' have the power to vote on any issues which come before the Board of Trustees. Although in most cases the student membership does not greatly affect Board decisions, the role of the Student Trustees has the potential to exert a considerable amount of ' influence. As Wollin explained, the Trustees are a 1 'big group- two students will not make much difference,\ yet they do have the power to vote. Professor Gardner Ketchum of the Mechanical Engineering Department, presently a Campus Trustee, expressed the situation by saying \the vote is the same whether you are a student trustee or Chairman of the Board.\ Ketchum also agreed with William Morris that the Student Trustees could influence Board decisions even further in a more informal manner. Individual Board members often seek out the student at dinners or before or after meetings to , get the reactions.of the student body on specific issues. 'Along with voting, Ketchum further ex- plained, the two students serve on committees, serving the same function as any member of the Board. The job of Student Trustee is often a much sought after position. It is a two-year office and the students often attend dinners and receive expense- paid weekends in New York City several times a year. As one Forum member put it, ''the Trustee is a very, very glorious position. You can move up because you're in contact with very, very inflUential people.'' It is interesting to note, though, that most students on campus, in fact most Forum members, have little or no knowledge of the responsibilities and func-- tions of the Student Trustees. According to Wollin, the Trustees ''should make themselves known ... students don't know who they are ... or what they do.\ ' Many students, when voting for representatives Spring Term, do not realize that the person they elect for Junior Trustee will be in office for two years. They do not reali~e that this student will be representing the entire student body to such an influential group of people where the College is concerned. Any student on campus can run for Junior Trustee. It is the responsibility of the student body, according to W ollinj ''to elect people who are competent. A member of the Forum commented that \any student who wishes to rwt for Student Trustee should show an interest beforehand ... They should know what they're doing.\ The student noted that of aH students who rwt for office, whether it be Trustee or Class Representative, few if any sit in on any Forum meetings prior to the election. This need for prior Subcomm-ittee Vacancies There are three vacancies on the Sub- committee on the Standing of Students, a sub- committee of the Academic Affairs Counci I. The committee reviews all appeals of students who received academic suspensions. All those in- - terested must submit a letter explaining why why they would li,l<e to be. members of the committee, as well as a letter of recom- mendation from a faculty member, to Mrs. Marra in the Student Activities Office. The deadline for applications is Monday; November 1. knowledge of what the office entails is even more essential in the case of Trustees because, according to William Morris, it is a ''pretty intimidating situation.\ The students must deal with many '~high powered people .. to go head to head (with the Board of Trustees) takes a lot of gumption.'' In reviewing the roles that the student Trustees have played in the .present and recent past, Wolli.B swnmed up the sen- timent of many students who are active in the government process by stating that the student trustees llave not fulfilled the responsibilities of their offices. \They look.at what has been done previously,\ he continued, and they then try to follow those patterns set by former Student' Trustees. Student Trustees, one Forum member believes, should try to expand the role they play for the benefit of the students they represent. This year's Student Trustees Melissa Vigiiemo and Karen Schick were either unavailable for corrunent or refused to comment at the present time. Concordiensis will run a profile of the two Student Trustees in next week's issue. The Federal Government also funds certain aid programs, but recently has de.creased the arnowtts provided. The Basic Equal Opportunity Grant (BEOG) or Pell Grant, a Federal entitlement payment given directly to qualifying students, has been cut from $327,000 to $280,000 for Union students since last year. The Federal Supplemental Equal Opportunity Grant .(SEOG) to the College was cut from $115,000 to $100,000 over the same period. Presently, the College Work Study Program ( CWSP). pays $220,000 annually ·to Union students. Only $65,000 of this comes from Washington, with Union picking up the remain- der. In 1981-82, the amount paid the .students was the same, but the Government contributed $85,000. Union receives about $100,000 per year from the now defunct National Direct Student Loan program, which consists of a revolving fund paid into by On the state level, New York' has not yet cut its aid, and is \super to students with . financial need,\ Massa ·believes. N.Y.S. grants money to the College in the form of the Higher Education Opportunity Program (liEOP), and dir~cij.y to students living in the State through the Academic Opportunity Program (AOP). Entitlement programs include Regents Scholarships (a flat $250 yearly to tho'se who qualify) and the Tuition Assistance Program. (TAP). $650,000' was provided to Union students last year through TAP, and Massa expects the figure to remain about the same this Continued on page 4 Skellar Sales Slunlp By SHARON BEILENSON Staff Compared to previous years the Skellar this year has been relatively quiet. The decline in business is the result, according to Brian Cotterell, Skellar manager, of the increase in drinking age from eighteen to nineteen and of the current economic slump. · Four years ago the major part of the Skellar's profit was due to beer sales. Two years ago beer sales contributed 50 per- cent ·of the profit. So far ~his year the sale of beer has ac~ counted for only 25 percent of the Skellar's profit. Food sales during the day have come ·to account for a larger percentage of profit than in the past. Cot- terell attributes the decline in beer sales both to changes in the liquor law and to economic factors. He explains that for the first time in two or three years beer companies have raised their prices. These price hikes have been passed along in small increases to the cost of beer at the Skellar. ~ut, Cotterell notes, even if these increases are not enough to dissuade students from patronizing the Skellar, the availability of free beer without proofing--most fraternities and sororities appear not to be proofing at their parties.-is. Despite its economic troubles, the Skellar is committed to enforcing the new drinking law 'and has tried a variety of measures to do so. However, there is no formal policy as yet. The Skellar is waiting to hear from Dean of Students Mam- mola who, Cotterell says, is considering giving a student group the task of devising a possible framework for the Skellar and Pub to follow. In addition to being answerable to the school, the Skellar is also checked by the State Luquor Authority. In fact, SLA officials spot checked the Skellar about two weeks ago, according to Cotterell, ap- parently in relation to an article that would later be appearing in the Sunday Times Union con- ,cerning changes pending at Union and Skidmore due to the new drinking law. He com- mented that the officers did not · speak to him; they just walked through the Skellar and then left. Cotterell said that· among the policies tried to restrict the sale of beer to those under nineteen were proofing at the door and handstamping of students over nineteen. However, the decline in sales had made it necessary to .employ only one bouncer making these procedures un: feasible. In addition,. for the first week of classes there was no sale of pitchers, in an at- tempt to keep students who are under nineteen from tlrllllting beer that others purchased. However with the decline in patronage, Skellar employees have been able to monitor pitcher sales from the counter so that pitchers are now ,available. In fact, the current policy is that proofing be done at the counter. Cotterell attributes the raise in drinking age and the legislation currently pencting in the State Senate which would further increase the drinking age to 21, to a heighfened national awareness to problems related to alcohol. He says that this new awareness began about tw~o years ago. , Cotterell speculates that as drinking at the Skellar is declining, it is probably in-:- creasing at private parties and within dorms as older students purchase alcohol for younger ones. He also speculates that as the Skellar continues to regulate its sale of beer, students rnay be more tempted than they .were before to frequent local bars which are less thorough in their enforcing of the new law.

Despite the sparse crowd, Del Bello was well .received, being interrupted more than once by cheers fol,\ his positions on labor and unemployment. He belie¥es tlte next State Executive Administration must work to sold . the ''problem th8t will solve all other problems, that is to bring jobs back to New York State.'' Giving a job to an unemployed person with a family, according to Del Bello, will sove eighty percent of that person's problems. Del Bello describes the Gubernatorial race as the competition of ''two different likely ch~nge if he and Cuomo are elected on November 2. They 11epot1e()J.y would com- bine,atCuomo'ssuggestion, the physical offices of the Governor and Lieutenant Governor. Del Bello believes State Gover:runent should act as a catalyst to industry in order to create jobs inthe private sector and reduce the unemployment problem. Rather than a direct agent spending money to lnvent work, he wants the Government to make investments to help businesses create positions which will eventually .benefit the State financially. Gym Restricted By LESLm RHUJJIN Staff The English - Beat concert originally scheduled to take place November 17 in the Alwnni Gym was relocated because of an agreement reached between the Of.fice of Student Activities and Mr. Sakala of the Alwnni Gym before the beginning of the school year. According to · Student Activities' Mrs. Lorraine Marra and Dean Mammola, the agreement stated that only two events per term would be scheduled in the gym. for three days would be im· practical. They agree that the morning of the 17th will be spent setting up for the concert, the morning of the 18th will be spent picking up after it, and the 19th will be spent preparing for the movie and dance. Instead, the concert will be moved to Proctor's where there will be an opportunity for more people to see it. Involved with the agreement on use of Alwnni Gym is a quota on the number of people attending an event. According to Mrs. Marra, \We try to keep it down to about 400 for a sitting event, like the movie, and 600 for a standing event, like the cpncert' '.

Anyone using the Alumni Gym is asked to keep it clean. \We usually just ask whoever is holding an event to please have a clean-up committee,\ com- mented Mrs. Marra. The speech followed a Solidarity rally at the Capitol, which was poorly attended, partly because of cold weather. In fact, less than twenty percent of the expected 5000 Solidarity supporters showed up. Much of those woo were there carried signs and flags signifying their affiliations with various local One ideology favors less government intervention .in the lives. of its people, and the other, his and Cuomo's, stresses the need for government to get involved in the welfare of its constituency. · The press conference con- sisted of about five reporters from local radio stations and newspapers questioning Del Bello on some of his issue stan~es.

The Social Committee scheduled the movie and dance before the Concert Committee made arrangements for the concert. Priority was given to the event scheduled first: the movie. Both Dean Mammola and Mrs. Marra agree that asking for the gym to be unavailable As for rules governing the usage of the Memorial Chapel, Mrs. Marra believes there are only a few. One is that there won't be any hard rock con- certs, because, as she says, \it is a chapel\. However, when \mellow groups\ and speakers such as Robert Klein, who came October 15, entertain, there are usually no problems. Galbraith Up In Arms By MICHELLE NOVELLE On Monday evening, before a crowd of more than seven hundred people, in Memorial Chapel, John . . Kenneth Galbraith spoke on the economy and the nuclear arms race. Galbraith, an advocate of democracy from the wheat- fields of Alberta, Canada has been called 1 'the most reaa economist of our times'' by Seymour Harris. Galbraith is the man who created the line made famous by John F. Kennedy, \Let us never negotiate in fear, but never let us fear to neogtiate.\ A professor of Economics at Harvard University, Galbraith earned his Ph.D. from the University of California, was a Social ·Science Research Council fellowman at the University of Cambridge and has taught at California and Princeton in addition to Har- _, vard. Galbraith, a former editor of Fortune Magazine, has also written a number of books, among the:Jn, The Af.fluent Society and The Age of U~certainty. His books are Widely used for courses in eco~?mics, business, and political science in various institutions of education. ··· Galbraith's central idea pertaining to the economy is ~hat, in principle, democracy ecr~es one person-one vote, but ~n reality capitalism has mampulated it so as to allow those with money to corrunand ~otes. There is a definite tension et~e~n democracy and cap1tallsm in the economy, according to Galbraith. In today's economy it is rare that an e~ection is. won by the promise of a .position or a public gayroll! t?ut · instead, stated . albra1th, v~t.es are bought through teleVIsion conunercials and advertisements. Galbraith f~els that this is the lowest form 0 campaigning and wealth ~hould not be allowed to replace raditional speeches and organizations. He feels that we ~ust ~ope for a surge of. in- ~natlOn. against the candidate W 0 Spends SO ffi\Ch inonetr-for an el t' . \\ . .r- contrecl Ion, and therefore put a o on it. · Galbraith also feels that tnis · tension, . which has lead demo_cracy to be the interest of very 'few as opposed to very many, is the oldest conflict in our land. The economist also said that the delegation of power is inevitable. The tension between those with power and those who delegate power is to be welcomed. Galbraith feels the tension has been unduly relaxed in military power and modern weaponry. He feels that the issue of modern weaponry is protected by the government and too often the government has said, 'modern weaponry is not able to be understood by the people en masse.' Galbraith feels that the weapons policy becomes a monopoly of the experts, the so-called \nuclear · theologians.\ But Galbraith feels the people ought to be expressing concern about their right tolive; about such questions as ''Who is to be rescued, where is one to go whenthe bomb is dropped?\ He is against arms expenditure because it is adverse to economic performance. In countries such as the United States and Great Britain, where the military budgets are sub- stantial, the growth of the economy is down. In: the Soviet Union, for example, the defense budget' is enormous and the poorest record of growth is obvious. Galbraith claims that the arms race drains the in- vestment resources., which therefore hurts the ability of tpe · economy to compete iil the world market. Galbraith feels that a com- prehensive, bi-lateral freeze is the .path to follow. A colleague Got a News Story? --. :-:·call. Concordiensis 370-6155 ·~ of Dr. Galbraith's, William Yury, made a wel~-known comparison between the United States and the Soviet Union. \It•s.like tw:o boys in a closed gal\age with four gallons of gasoline spilled on the floor - one boy has six matches, the other has nine, and they debate as to who is going to Ught the match.es.\ Galbraith feels that by way of democracy we must prC>ve our will to survive. In his own words, \Liberty requires that there will be people to enjoy it.\ Dr. Galbraith concluded his speech by urging all people to make known their position on nuclear arms, for it .is a concern to all who value life.

At present, $615,000 has been received, but some students have not yet applied. ·Union's average TAP award is $2,500. Outside scholarships {nor- mally local a.wards to students) total over $200,000 each year, and help to defray financial aid from other sources. Massa'Soffice inustcompile a \financial aid package for the College,\ and does so by sub- tracting_ Federal, State, and \outside\ assistance from the students' financial needs. 'rhis iS the amount of aid perceived by the Financial· Ai.d Office as necessary for Union to provide its students. From the figure, student employment costs are subtracted (this amount remains constant unless the minimum wage changes), and the remainder, needed in scholarship form, is propQSed to the Board of Trustees. The dollar amoWit that the Board approves is the bottom line figure used for College scholarships. Massa feels it is important to note thateven-in a good year for annual contributions, the amount grante~ in scholarships does not increase. Rather, less money fron:1 the General Fund has to be used, thereby lessening the necessity for tuition increases. Tbe General Fund monies used for aid (a budgeted $1.52 million this year) come almost exclusively from tuition. Thus, the student not receiving aid benefits when less assistance is taken from the General Fund, because tuition increases will not be as steep, accordinf! to Massa. The Financial ·Aid Office is noticing that the number of applicants to the College who· request financipl assistance is rising, thQugh a trend of people who do . not enroll bE:caW!e of -insuffiCient aid has not · yet developed. In the Class of '84, 41 percent of those whO ap~lied for admission also applied f.or financial help, and.,.the figure · has jumped to 61 percent for the ·Class of '86. The .percentage actually awarded aid, though, has remained ·constant at 40 percent. Massa calcu!.a~es that it would take an additional $1 million to grant assiStance to 61 .percent of the applicants. He e~plains that \as the cost of attending Union increases _and the economy fails to. improve, more :;tnd more people perceive a need for financial assistan .. ce.\ Massa see~ four possible solutions to 'the problem, but not an are feasible. Union coulcl drop the percentage of students granted aid from 40 percent to 30 percent, but he stresses this is unacceptable. to the College, which does not want to move into a system where ability to pay more heavily de~er~es one's chances of attending. Wtth the percent getting aid remaining stagnant while more request · it, though, . Massa mentions that in reality, \to a small degree this is already beginning to happen.\ - , As partial remedie_s,. Massa suggests a campaign addressed to Alumni, to raise money for the College to loan students, and also a program to borrow money from a·locallender and loan it to parents at a discounted rate. He believes there is little doubt that \the key to financi~l aid lies in the endowed scholarships.\ One alternative Massa , favors, but sees little chance of becoming reality, iS that of a State decision to increase SUNY tuitions. He points out · that Union's tuition (as well as those at most other of the 109 in. dependent colleges in New York) increases faster than SUNY's. If the present charge of $1,200 was raised to $2,500, the excess, after granting aid to those SUNY students unable to afford the increase; could be used to increas,e uBundy\ aid to private institutions. This would curb tuition increases at these · schools., He· a:lso advocates raising the charge for SUNY students · residing outside the State by an even higher rate. Presently, out of State students. pa:y $1,700, only $500 more than residents. In Vermont, for example, residents pay $1,600 and non-residents pay $~,600 to attend state colleges. The Admissions .Office has not yet been forced to accept a greater number of applicants in order to ·get the desired return for enrollment, as shown by this year's record number of fresh- men. In each of.the past three years, approximately 50 per- cent of . those offered Union scholarships have decided to accept-them and enroll. However, the fact that 20 percent more of the applicants to the Class of '86 requested aid than those from the Class of '84 proves that economic conditions are affecting the families of students. Massa appraised the situation as \slightly easier\ to put a student through a school like Union just two years ago than it is today. There were several Union College students whO stopped along Rt. 50 last Sunday morning at approximately 2:00 a.m. to assist at the scene of, a fire.

Page 6 OONCORDIENSIS, October !1, 198$ FEATURES Humor: Women's W-eek $\- Correction II Last week, Concordiensis printed the picture of a smiling, happy man who was inexplicably identified as Dean Aaron Feinsot of General Studies. The smiling man could not have been Dean Feinsot, because-as he said in a recent interview: \The Dean does not smile.\ The man in the picture last we.ek has .been identified by Concordiensis' cracker-jack team of researchers as \Dizzy\ Dean, who-as everyon~ knows-was .quite a Card. - The real Dean Feinsot is pictured above, is in charge of Union's Graduate Studies, and has been and continues to be-as everyone knows-a Giant in ~is time. Concordiensis is ~orry for any inconvenience. A Concordy Exclusive: By MATT NANKIN Contributing Editor The foUowtng editorial was originally broadcast AprU 18th, 1982 on the 6:15 Sunday evening .news on WRUC. Due to popular demand, it was rebroadcast last Sunday in a slightly revised .form. It is prblted here in this latter form for every frustrated male on campus . This week I would like to attack women, or rather \Women's Week.\ To start off, I'd just like to say that I don't think these female students understand something. UNION was an all-mens' college for 175 years. Now there are more women than ever. At the same time, the New York Times says our academic and social life are far below other cemparitive schools. Now I'm not going to say that the women here are to blame for this, but the facts speak for themselves! ! ! Here's another thihg I don't like. When I walk into Carnegie to get my latest hl!rd-core pornography, I don't want to be confronted with isSues like abortion and birth control. If it was up to me, I could solve botlr problems tomorrow. All you have to do is stop people from having sex. I propose that each city and town have their own group_of \sex-fighters\ to \put All About the Expert ByJOELSTEIN Staff In our last installment (\Recluse If.eveals All\) we found out how Ace Investigative Reporter Robert S. Driscoll went about breaking the biggest story to hit these pages since Jeane Dixon's Horoscopes. \I'm still in shock,\ Driscoll said, although he broke the case nearly two weeks ago. \After all,\ he said, \I had read Ask The Expert just like everyone else. I admit it, I was a fan of Dr. Birnbach's. Then I heard the rumors. I didn't think they were true, but you don't get the title Ace Investigative Reporter for nothing.\ Driscoll tried to get in touch with Dr. Birnbach, but couldn't, because \people tried to mislead me. But they couldn't fool me: no one could be up at Skidmore for that long- not even an expert like Dr. Birnbach.\ Breaking the Case Driscoll was\\studying for a Physics 42 (Neat Topics in Modem Physics) test late two Thursdays ago when he got the pllone call that broke the case wide open, that changed his life, and that won Marty Donadio of Brooklyn, N.Y. $25 on Bowling for Dollars. \The phone rang at 3:30, and I was nervous. The whole week before I kept get- ting phone calls late into the night. And each time I picked up, I beard a raspy voice that sounded remarkably like my rbrother while holding a han- dkerchief in front of his mouth. Tbe voice would ask, 'What's the difference between New Jersey and Union women?' He would repeat the question over and over until I was in hysterics, and all I could think to say was, 'The bathroom's down the ball and on your right.; But this time, the voice was different. This time there was something very different about it.\ The difference was that this time the call wasn't collect. \Things have gone 1 on too long,\ said Bill Farrow, on tbe condition that his name would not be used. He couldn't letthe situation go on any longer, because of \certain reasons.\ \Ask the Expert is a fake,\ Farrow .said. \Dr. Bimbach doesn't even write them. He's not even in the country anymore, but somewhere in Switzerland.\ After extensive research, Driscoll was finally able to locate Dr. Birnbach by calling Swiss information for his telephone. \I feel terrible about it,\ said Dr. Birnbach. \I never wrote one of those columns. All I did was sign a contract saying that they could use my name and picture, while I would get lots of money, fame, and a chalet in Switzerland. I really do feel I owe the school a lot.\ When , asked about the millions in bullion be had already banked, Birnbacb said, \I said I owed the school-I didn't say how much. Besides, if I take the money out now, I'd have to return the neat gifts I got just for opening up an account.\ This Is th~ first part of a two part article. -~~~~·~~·~--- ~ ADVERTISING AND BUSINESS -cl HELP IS DESPERATELY NEEDED FOR CONCORDIENSIS IF J'NTERESTED. CALL JULIE at 6155 or 6658 ~~~·~~~~~~~~ Union's Student Philosophy Forum will be holding an important meeting on .Oct. 21 at 9:00p.m. in the Humanities Lounge. All interested are invited to aHend out'' any potential offenses while they are in progress. Now for a history lesson: In the interwar period, the Weimar republic in Germany gave women total equality, then what happened? The N~i party led by Adolph Hitler. carne to power, World Wat II .started, and millions of people were put to death. Let's not make the same misYike twice! ! Who knows what might happen in the United States today if women . are given full equality. OK, maybe I'm being slightly alarmist, but that.' s also what they said of those wno first questioned Ned Harkness. Let's assume for the moment that women should. be allowed their own week on campus. Pretty soon every two .. bit organization, group, and ac- tivity is going to want a week and the result will be anarchy. In my estimation,. women's week was si~ days too long. However, I suppose if we must bav~ a Women's Week then so must we have a Men's Week. But in order to have such an event, first must come the creation of an official \Men's Network'·' which would have to receive the same amount of Student Forum funding as its sister organization. The newly- _ formed club could ·print a • newspaper entitled Animal which would have articles with such titles as ''How te Keep a Good Women Down\ and \Why Men Can't be Satisfied with Only One Wife.\ Socially, the Men's. Network could also run \meatwagons\ up t<> Skidmore, which would allow Pniort ·males without cars to · indulge in pleasures that have previously been unknown to them. On Tuesday nights the same vehicles could be used to . transport \Skiddies\ here to see how they \stack up\ against · our Union women. Another cause that must be taken up, so to speak, is reinstituting the ' Skidmore section in the Fresh. · man record. · This is Matt Nankin with one MAN'S opinion. By the way, if there is. anyone · out there who cares whether or not I continue with this · editorials and .. or continue to publish thern in Concordy 1 please drop .a note in Bo;rc 54 saying, \Yes Matt, I care. Keep telling it like it really is.\ All signed notes will receive a personal written response. Editors Note: The opinions and views expressed by Mr. Nanldll are not those of Con· cordlensls- or ·wRUC. Franklin Babbles By FRANKLIN SCHNEIDER Staff And so begins another article. Unfortunately, I have failed to come up with a subject to write about. Sure, I bad some ideas, but they were not funny. When you cannot laugh at your own jokes, who else will? This year seemed one of journalistic promise. For a start I came up with ''Vals at Union.\ It was generally well received. Why shouldn't it have been, it was funny! Granted, the picture that accompanied the article detracted from the story's quality. Even so, the caption was cute if not ap- propriate. And let us look at the photo which caused so much commotion (that of the posterior of a Valley Girl) .. On photographic terms, it is not a bad shot, even if it was not my idea to include it. Furthermore, the taking of the picture aided the capitalist system-~a salesgirl at Bloomingdales was paid to pose.. (She originally volunteered her \services.\) the picture fulfilled its purpose- -it took up space. The following week I made · another contribution; I wrote two of the \Dear Normans.\ (\Victim of Many Decibels-a student plagued by his room- mate'sstereo, and \Cramped in, Clothes Quarters\-Are there Valley Guys?) A!J we know, it was not Dr. Birnbach who created the fake letter$, but rather his staff. I was the sucker, rather contributor, required to write two of them- the third was sav.ed from the week before. But hey, tbe~rwere funny! I was on a roll, or so I thought, Last week, much to my reading audience's dismay, I had to curtail my journalistic efforts. Yes, I am a student at Union as well, and with tests soon I did not have the time. Fear not, I had told my editors, I would reward them with something special. Such was not the case. Now don't get the wrong impression. You're telling yourself, \ Sure, some writer of sarcasm you are!\ But it is just not so. I mean I really tried (well, maybe not that hard). Yet, I could not come up with any decent ideas. At one point I became so desperate that I tried to have one of my stories from last year reprinted (\!low Cold is It?\-Ways of staying warm at Union). A few changes and no one would recognize it. After all, it was funny and that's what counts. My editors did not like my suggestion. It seems they wanted to save the article until they really needed material. So here I am, writing my 400 words just to placate my editors. Alright, I will finish this , up! Hey, I have an idea for a story! It's all about ....• Wait! I'll save it until next week, seeing how I do not want to waste this effort. Well, I guess I have not lost my penchant for obnoxious humor. It's sur- prising how one's mind works. (As many women who know me can attest to.)

It's funny that in a society in which the Puritan No-Non$ense Work Ethic plays 50 important a role that humor is important, too. How frivolous of us! Even more absurd is that we have people whose job iS to be humorous, whose job is to make people laugh. These people. are P.aid to have a good time··lmagme that!. But imagine our li.ves if there were no comedians. What would life be like if there were no one telling us not to take everything so seriously? The concept of hUJDor is important. It is the . ability to laugh-at otbers and at ourselves--that has helped mankind make it through the centuries. Humor has been around for a long time. It was invented before Aristophanes, a Greek playwright who wrote some of the earliest comedies still in ex:istence,. was born. Whi'le modern audiences· might have some trouble understanding \The Birds\ or \The Clouds,;, Greek aadiences seeing the plays performed in the Acropolis loved them. Maybe if modem audiences were to see the early Greek comedies performed ·on the Acropolis, . they'd laagl1 too.

So far it has been, but since I have yet to take that course, .I Will wait to .-finish the discourse _ on The Origins of HUinor until such a, time.

Page 8 CONCOBDIENSI$, October $1, 1982 THE ARTS \Romeo and Juliet\ at the Egg ALBANY ~Shakespeare's immortal love story Romeo and Juliet will be the season's first dramatic production by the . resident company of the Empire State Institute for the Performing Arts. Per- formances are scheduled at the Egg in Albany, October 29 through November 8. The new production will be the third Shakespeare play directed for the company by ESIPS's deputy producing director; W.A. Frankonis, who also staged The Mercbant of Venice and Macbeth. Other productions directed by Mr. Frankonis for the Institute include Winterthing, The Lark, Witness ior the Prosecution, and Beauty and the Beast. Describing the premise of his approach, Mr. Frankonis speaks of the play as \fresh passionate, poignant, vibrant, and soaring.\ at the beginning of rehearsals last week, he spoke to the company of the many images present in and evoked by Romeo and Juliet, of which \the most pervasive image. is that of the interplay- and collision-of darkness and light. Throughout,. references to one or the other or ooth abound; hence our production will emphasize the imagery of darkness and light, and what those qualities represent. \The play moves from the darkness of violent passions and ... thwarted passions to a brief, glorious burst of blinding light, and then it returns again to darkgess ... The two young lovers areall the light there is in the play ... all else around them is dark and forbidding, and unsupportive of light. At fir- st ... Juliet is the only light but as Romeo is drawn to her flame, he too becomes a source of brightness, .if only for a short while.\ Mr. Frankonis also described. the main characters of the play. \To consider Romeo~-his feelings and his actions--without a smile of recognition is simply not p<>ssible ... at least for the male of the species .... Much has been written in the literature of the arts and sciences about the adolescent male, but little ·captures as\'ully the feeuDg of the adolescent, maturing male ... as does Shakespeare with his Romeo. What Romeo experiences, his passion and fear and tenderness and pain, his rage at a world that simply will not take his heart seriously- -all ofthese are real. We know it deep in the most secret parts of our souls.\ Of Juliet he said \at the risk of stating the totally obvious\ that she is \young .... And young she must be, at least at the start of the play and at least in her vulnerability. However, there occurs in the course of the play an astonishing growth and maturing ... : she goes from adolescent to woman in five short days .... She achieves her maturity without cynicism or intolerance; in fact, if anything she becomes a gentler person as she proceeds--gentler, not weaker. \To realize the deepest nature of Juliet, one must go back to one's own first great love, to the absolute con- sumption of self by that love object.\ Juliet is \lovely in her passion and her confusion and her action .... She despairs, yes, From the AlBANY BREWERS SERVED COLD '·B', ASK ON TAP ' ' FOR l • J MY Ale Down at Newman's Brewery we brew the local beer in the best British, real ale traditioo.

Ticket prices: Students and Faculty $2.,00, General Admission $3.50. The THEATRE AND BEYOND presentation, led by the Ensemble's ~founder and director, Nicole Dreiske, will illustrate the Facets Per- formance Ensemble's developments in kinetic theatre, known as the Dreiske discipline, and incorporate selections from performance pieces developed by the Ensemble over the last six years. The THEATR]j: AND BEYOND presentation consists of a demonstration of the development of a dynamic language based in physical and vocal theatre dsiciplines, and a synthesis of language elements in myth, story and per- formance. The aim of the Ensemble's work, says the director, Nicole Dreiske, isto \develop the actor as a total creative artist, not as a mere purveyor os someone else's lines. Says Dreiske, \Theatre today is too limited, too fragmented and too corrupt. The traditional language of the theatre can no longer ac- conunodate the power of which theatre is capable.\ ''To reveal himself, and truth,'' saysDreiske, \tne actor must have a language that is unblemished by commercial movies, televll)ion, society-a new and clearer language-and he must have total control of his voice and -Qody, his total in- stritment as an actor.\ For Dreiske and the Ensemble, the actor's ability to reveal and have control mean months and years of arduous traini,ng in physical and vocal disciplines, which has often been referred to as \going beyond pain.\ ''Most professional football players would think twice before going through the physical training we do each and every day,'' says Dreiske. Working five days a week, 7 hours each day, the actors, auditioned from hundreds of applicants, work in physical and vocal disciplines designed to make them master each part of their body and each gradation of their voice. An actor's prf;lvious experience on stage means little to Dreiske when he applies to bec_otne an Ensemble member: \I take an actor, and I change him,\- she says .. What does matter, ·however, are the actQr's abilities to en- dure hours of training in gymnastically based exercises (Grotowski details), plastiques (mime-based exercises for body extremities), and Dreiske 's own systems. of resistance body movement and Alcexander- technique based systems of r-:·~=iYPIN•Ge:::· ~·:, ESCOBAR TYPING SERVICE 393-1209 Fast and accurate service 85.;/page Satisfaction Guaranteed!

The common thread of these dialogues . leads Dreiske to center the Ensemble on central themes and issues. Hundreds of improvisations and ayear or so later, the text and physical score are ready to be scripted by Dreiske into a working theatre piece, and an actual rehearsal process on the theatre piece begins. When complete, the Ensemble's theatre pieces are a complex .physical and vocal symphony of images, movement and vocal textures. There are no sets, characters, plots, traditlonal dialogue; the Ensemble's pieces, says Dreiske, \are revealed through image, theme and purpose rather than· narrative struc,.. ture.\ , She warns audiences coming to see the Ensemble's work, \what you are about to see and~ experience you have never seen or experienced before. This is anew and drastically different theatl'e. Leave all pre- conc_eptions behind when you ' ' ' THE ARTS \FACETS\ to,perform at Union. enter.\ The theatre pieces, she says, \work on many different levels at once. The power of an audience to ex~rience, the power of the theatre to change lives, is dependent only on the ability of the audience to leave their old life and old ex- periences behind.'' The Ensemble's theatre pieces include DARK S~LSTICE, developed in B.rtttany, France, a theatre ptece based on ancient Celtic myth and magic, PARABLES II, a spontaneous presentation of stories, dreams and poetry submitted by members of the audience, and most recently THE .

I·.might add--one that will only ·be surpassed by an encol'e. Many Cabaret performers get on stage· and sing . .Anna Tucker was not one of those. From the moment she graced the stage she was in control of the · audience. A natural comedienne, Tucker sang and mugged her way through-:a very short 45 minutes. 'l1J.ough weak on snappy anthems like \West End Avenue,\ from \The Magic Show,\ any imperfections were soon forgotten in the hilarity of the burlesque '•rum 'Back Old Man., The audience could not help but cheer for her.

Anyone who has never seen him in performance or even heard of his <Work is truly depri:ved. Talent is a metaphor for Joel Beckerman. His hands are deft on the keyboard and his voice and manner are fully appealing. He is totally professional and an asset to Union College. Also on the bill that evening were M.C. Sam .Didio and a band called Eutheria. Didio, though,. hwnorous in nature, is sorely in need of new material. His act was only funny the first dozen or so times I heard it. Eutheria is comprised of Steve Larsen on keyboards, Jason Brand on drums; Phil Sppor on guitar and Mike Klein and Jodi Cohen on vocals.

The performance was the first event sponsored by the three!-week-old · Arts Club, and it demonstrates the in- creasing interest in .the Arts at Union. After introductory remarks by both Arts Club President Melissa Beth Gruen and the Dance Club President Nanette Blwn, the show opened with a high•steppin' dance choreographed by Marcelle Diamandis to \A Chorus Line .•.

A lovely piece entitled \Sheer Shell-Lee,\ composed by . Melissa Beth Gruen, was performed by flutist Artemis Poulos, guitarist James Heinegg, and bass guitarist Ken Kaufman. \Fame choreographed by Alan Tuckman, was an energetic dance number to a familiar tune.

Page 12 CONCORDIEN~IS, October t1, 198! (Jlvn.rorbirnsis FountkJ at llnion Collegt 1817 ~----------- ---~----~- Cuomo To Win Ooncordiensis wholeheartedly endorses Mario Cuomo for governor of the State of New York. There is no real choice for students in this election. Cuomo brings with him experience in Albany that Lehrman just does not have. This is not the time for ''on-the-job\ training in the Governor's office. The State faces an enormous budget defi.cit. New York's. physical plant is de\(.!aytng right beneath our very eyes. Inadequacies are plaguing our police, fire and health services. More concretely for us, Cuomo supports continued funding for the Tuition Assistance Program (TAP) and state Bundy aid to private institutions. In fact, Cuomo states that financial aid programs \should be comprehensive enough to provide aid for all students who might be excluded ftom college ... for economic reasons.'' He wants to expand the State programs to include monies· for part-time and financially independent students who now get limited support. Cuomo considers it the responsibility of government to provide for quality education. This is more than Lew Lehrman can say. ·Actually, Lew hasn't said anything. CUomo's opponent has neglected to' publicize his position on state funding for education. This is quite the political maneuver for Lehrma.Q. It is well known that this Reagan prototype wants to eliminate such programs and fears retaliation at the polls by college students. And speaking of embracing Reaganomic philosophy, look where it has gotten us already on the federal fevel. Reductio~s have been. made in Pell Grant awards. Funding cuts for college work- study are proposed. It has become increasingly more difficult to obtain Guaranteed Student Loans. Clearly, Lew Lehrman's intentions are being worn on his sleeve for all to see. Lew Lehrman is a talented campaigner. He has unlimited funds from his own personal fortune to spend on media bombardment. Lehrman presents a sharp picture of success as he strides around in his red suspenders. But beware of a campaign built on image and not substance. Cuomo's reputation in Albany is well· documented in his achievements as both secretary of state and lieutenant governor. He knows the right strings to pull up. in the State Capitol and· that's half the battle. It would take Lehrman months to just learn the floorplan of the maze-like building. Throw your support behilid the man. Cuomo has the right answers to the pressing issues affecting students. LETTERS ..

Am I eligible? -If your family incqme ex· ceeds $30,000, you must show \financial need\ for the loan.

To restate a sim- plistic letter simplistically: Mr. Schneider is guilty of not using bis space to raise our con- sciousnesses about women's · issues, nuclear war; poverty, etc. while shamelessly ex- ploiting female sexuality; Mr. Birnbach is guilty of a similar offense and Mr. Nankin would have us conducting · niedical experiments on traffic of- fenders. I concur with the professor that there is a dearth of Con- cordlensis commentary on worthwhile topics, indeed this lack of serious discussion is a campus-wide phenomenon. I do, however, object to the assertion that Frank and Norman's ob- viously humorous articles should be put to a better pur- pose. There is a time and a · place for almost everything (turn, turn, tum) including humor. Humor does not have to fight sexism, poverty, or :even do the dishes; it. just is.

Page 13 Another- View education has been the magic that has made the economic miracle possible. A low cost system of lijgher education has enabled millions of Americans to make their lives fuller in every sense. Providing a quality . education for all, unimpeded by economic ·and social . barriers is a basic respoM.ibUity of. government We must, however, strive to do more, particularly for those who need -help most, women, part-tillle st~dents, and those from economically dlsad.- vantaged backgrounds. Non- traditional students are enrolling in degree programs in increasing numbers. Our educational~itutions ought to be responding to this Significant trend With more flexibility in financial aid and academic programs. . we must explore ways to make day care services readily available at college campuses. The state has already begun a day care program for the children of state employees; we should look at this model to find ways of giving single parents the . .full opportunity to better their lives and those of their children t~ough educati()n. Though it would ;be nice. to Joe Malieen~t simpliStic towardS registration the draft, this is .not ~ible because many ~ople inthe U.S. a similar view. Maneen others believe that it is moral duty to $erve .one's \~\\''rv without questioning the of this conunitment. Instead I believe itis essential each individual to question registering for a oosstoJe draft is something that believes in doing. Some who refuse to I\egister it is against their values support the present U.S. establishment _which, m;s~\\\'\'·' preserves its self- inter~lst in seeking militariStic so\utions in El Salvador or Dissenting fr.om the status is strongly rooted in the tradition beginning the American Revolution. Also,. Henry David Thoreau practiced civil disobedience when he refiJSed to pay his taxes. Both the American. Revolutionaries and Thoreau . took a confrontational stance and made people question whether the political situation needed changes. Given the nature of toclay's military, such stances · are · even though people such as Maneen use . scare tactics to prevent such resisting. In fact, he resorts to . inflating the state 5 year and-or 10,000 dollar fine for not registerfug to a poSSible 15 years. The selective .service, however, is more accurate and thorough in their scare tactics. They have access to an in- creased budget for this year; thus enabling them to publish information tlu'oug!lout the high schools ·about the penalties for not r.egi~tering .. They also employ more subtle tactics by using celebrities on television (i.e. Wolfman Jack) to em• phasize·that tllere is nothing to wotry abou~ because registration is not the drQft. These tactics only represent one way in which the Pentagon ami weapons industries spend much money in order to legitimize publicly today's huge· military expenditures. ThUJ, in turn, helps to· compel our govenunent to find n:illitary solutions instead of diplomatic ones, to international matters. C o n s e q u e n t ly , t h e registration resisters who refuse to support the U ;S. militaristic .posture -take a lonely stance against a powerfully ·support~d military, industrial complex. I, and many others, however; support these resisters who are sacrificing their livelihood in order to reverse our destructive, militaristic ()Jlth which may lead to nuclear holocaust. Sincerely Fozz Higher education is an im- portant factor in the human development of New Yorkers. It can enable people to lead fuller lives, give more to their ·children, and to becQme better citizens. More important, perhaps, education can open people's minds and help to bring .together rnen .and women from different ethnic and economic backgrounds. In addition to being a key to human development, higher education must be seen as part of our effort to build a better economic future for New York State. Our public investment in higher education is just that. New Yo~k State has had. a better record than most states in removing barriers to higher education for its citizenS. The free tuition tradition of the City University was a proud monument ·to the foresight and conunitment of our past public leaders. Today we can be proud of the .fine SUNY -CUNY system, state Bundy aid · to Unfortunately,. at present, part-time students (and in- cluded in these groups are many women, minorities and working poor) cannot get TAP at au· and upper division students, financially in- dependent students and graduate students get liinited support. Our state based financial aid programs should be comprehensive enough to .provide aid for all students who might be excluded from college or university for economic reasons: An investment in enriched financial aid programs is the best kind of economic development we can provide. If America. is to regain its ~onomic stride it will be by investing in our greatest resource, our people. . In addition to an unwaivering commitment to .financial aid, Whlle I ·know that students are concerned With specitic educational issues,, I also know that as Americans we must all be concerned with issues that affect all of us. The policies of the Reagan Administration represent a threat to the people of New York State. We have seen Reagan cut Pell Grants and student loans, viciously attack the poor with irresponsible budget cuts that hurt people, and support an arms race instead of the nuclear freeze Ameri<eans want. We have had to sit by as Reagan has cut the taxes for the rich and fought successfully against ERA. It's time to .fight back. Reaganomics has failed, giving the Democratic Party once more an hiStoric opportunity to demonstrate the kind of leadership that can come to grips with the real problems and provide solutions. Help us grasp this opportunity. Sincerely, Mario M. Cuomo More Than Just a Float -experience and training in they were assigned a Residence getting students involved.

IFC and Student F·orum He ·Lost His Job By MARCY BURSTINER StaH The Student Forum is, at the present tine, revising the student government con- stitution in an attempt to in- corporate much-needed by-laws into that document. In a recent Forum meeting, one student representative suggested that the Forum take this opportunity '.o give representation in the amended constitution to the Panhellenic Council so that it will have equal representation with the Interfraternity Council. The PHC tried last year to obtain the requited· amount of signatures needed to c{et them that representation, but failed in their attempt. The Interfraternity Council now has a representative to the Forum who has equal voting power to any other Forum· member. The IFC represen- :.ative is not elected by the student body, but by the coUJ1cil itself. An individual member of any fraternity on campus has, presently, double r.epresen~ tation. He is represented by both the IFC and his or her class representatives. Why shoul~ one student have more voting power because he is a member of a fraternity, than another student who happens to be an independent? 'Is this not penalizing certain students. for not. belonging to fraternities? The IFC representative is able to vote on any issue which comes before the Student Forum. Yet not all issues which come before the Forum directly effect either fraternities or sororities. Why should the IFC be given one-eighteenth of the vote for any decision the Forwn makes? In order to be fair, not only should the PHC have equal representation, but following that logic, a student shoul<t be appointed or elected to represent the interests of all independents on campus. This method though, would be im- practical and, many .people believe, unnecessary. I propose instead, as a student who· has sat in on many Forum meetings and who has observed the government process, that the IFG retain their representation, but on a non-votin,g basis. Tbe privilege to discuss issues on the Forwn is almost as .great an influence on Forum decisions, ' as the vote itself. Most Forum member~ listen to all intelligent comments made by anyone sitting in on the. meetings, whether they come from ·other Forum members, Con .. cordJensi.s representatives, or just any student taking an active interest in the Student Government. I have observed this influence and I believe that the Forum members take such comments and suggestions into account :when voting on issues. I resent the fact that the IFC is given the voting power it has while it represents the interests of only a portion of the student body. The constitution is presently being revised .. I believe the role. of lFC representation on the Forum should be reviewed, By ART BUCIIWALD (c) 1982, Los Angeles Times Syndicate '- I was . sitting in Lafayette Park facing the ·White House when an unshaven man in a rumpled sUit, anQ no shoe laces, sat down ne:U to .me, and looked hungrily at my lunch. \Would you care/for a bite?\ I asked. \If it. isn't too mud,l trou. ble,\ he said, \I'm unemployed; as you ·can probably g1,1th~r.\ \I'm .sorry to hear that,\ I said sincerely. \Where did you wor:k?\ He pointed to the White House. \Over there.\ \I didn't know the White House was laying off people,\ I s~id'. \Ordinarily they aren't.

The guys around the Oval Office thought I was a political genius, until Gary Arnold said the Emperor had no clothes on.\ , By JACK ANDERSON and JOE SPEAR WASHINGTON-The United Nations could well be facing one of the most serious crises in its turbulent 37-year history. Here's why: . Several hardline Arab countries have announced they will try to blrick the acceptance of Israel's credentials to the General Assembly for the session that has just convened. If the effort succeeds, the Reagan administration will cut U.S. contributions to the United Nations and refuse to take part in the General Assembly as long as Israel is denied membership. Such drastic measures could mean the beginning of the end of the world body. The.leaders in the Arab move against Israel are Iraq, Libya, Syria and · the Palestine Liberation Organization. All they need is a simple majority of the General Assembly, and they are lobbying behind the scenes to line up other Moslem and Third World nations. Unfortunately, the United Statescannolonger count on the solid bloc of Latin American support in the United Nations. Many Latin American countries that regularly vote with the United States are still upset at the way the Reagn ad- ministration sided with the British in the Falkland Islands dispute. Nevertheless, the United States is determined to block the action against Israel. Cables have been sent from the State Department to U.S. embassies ~ound the world, instructing American ambassadors to let their host governments know how strongly the White House feels about the issue. Our sources say the ad- miniStration is prepared to withhold financial support and boycott the General Assembly. the United States would con- tinue to participate in the Security CoWtcil and retain its veto. The American taxpayers contrib~te . about $1 billion a year to the United Nations-one- quarter of the assembly's entire budget and far more than any other country's contribution. In short, without the United States, there would be no United Nations. FINESSING FERDINAND: When the United States lost its bases in Vietnam, the U.S. military posts in the Philippines became vital to operations in Southeast Asia. No one better understands this better than the amiable dictator of the Philippines, Ferdinand Marcos. He has been putting the financial squeeze on the United States for the privilege of using the bases. Marcos visited Washington last ·month with his photogenic wife, Imelda. He pointed out solemnly that the Philippine bases are essential to keep peace in the region. But he . suggested sadly that he may have to raise the rent. We have news for Marcos. He was followed to Washington by one of his SoutheastAsianneigh- bors, President Suharto of Indonesia. We can report that Suharto would be happy ·to provide the United States with bases--anytime the· United. States should get fed up with Marcos. SENIOR POWER: There are currently more than 25 million Americans over the age of 65- and that's a lot of voters. Other special-interest groups have formed ''political . action committees\ to pour millions of dollars into political warchests, and the nation's senior citizens Concerned citizens, budding . . Buckleys, neophyte Novoks, . and aspiring Andersons ., should contact D.C. Owens at6155. are doing the same. Their political arm is called, ap. propriately enough, SENIOR~ . PAC. This year marks the first time SENlOR-PAC has actively participated in an election. For the Senate, the organization is backing, '*'among others, Maryland Democrat Paul Sarbanes, Pennsylvania Republican John Heinz, and Michigan Republican DoQ Riegle. For the House, the group supports Vermont Republican Jim Jeffords, Dlinois Democrat Sidney Yates, and Ohio Democrat Mary Rose Oakar. HEADLINES AND FOOT- NOTES: Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin has claimed that Israeli troops have not treated prisoners in Lebanon harshly. But our State Department sources have received a report that prisoners in the Ansar camp in southern Lebanon were wounded in a recent melee. As prisoners rushed towards the fence to greet arriving relatives, Israeli guards fired into the air to stop them. When the onrush con- tinued the guards fired at the prisoners' legs. Eight were hit by the shots. .... U.S. intelligence analysts say that the renegade Lebanese major, Saad Haddad, has been moving his Christian. militiamen into the environs of Beirut. This, the analysts fear, could lead to a confrontation with U.S. Marines. According to confidential State Department reports, Haddad's troops have tangled with U.N. forces numerous times since 1979, including \at least 30 incidents in which United Nations soldiers were killed.\ - In a recent White House meeting, President Reagan lost his temper with a California \That's the one. I sent out the invitation to him in San Jose, Calif.\ \Here have another sand- wich,\ I said. \Didn't you have any idea he would make trouble when you invited him?\ \What did I know about Gary Arnold? He was just another pretty face on a computer. My orders were to invite all the Republican faithful to the White House, so Reagan could give them a pep talk for their congressional campaigns. I figured anyone from California was a team player.\ \You would think. that,\ I said. \It wasn't your fault he became a household word.\ · \That's what I told Meese, Deaver and Baker. But they said I should have smelled he was an off-the-wall con- servative. I believe the thing that really got to them was when Arnold started shouting 'We have a Tylenol taxing situation here, and· we have \I have a hard-boiled egg,\ I said. \The way F see it, you did • everything right, and they're just making you the fall guy because the Republicans can't keep their right-wing fanatics Jlllder control.\ \That's nice of you to say.

OONOOBDJ'ENSIS,·October~1., 1982 Page 1C5 ~nd of a Trend?! Male-Female Integration (CPS)-After nearly a decade of steadily-increasing mem- berships, fraternities at a number of colleges around the · country ~re repo,rting a · disappointing drop in the number of new pledge$ last spring and this fall. While most blame increased academic pressure for the low turnouts, one fraternity at Lehigh .University says. the school's head football coach is to blame. Greek membership nation- wide is still up over the low levels of ·the late sixties and early seventies, assures Jack . Anson, executive dire<;tor of the National Interfraternity Council. Membership figures for this year won't b~ availa~le ~til the spring, but 1f the s1tuatlons at colleges as diverse as Wesleyan, Loyola-New.Orleans and the Vniverslty of Nebraska are any indication, there are soft spots in greek recrUiting. . \We sure bope it's not (heading downward),\ Anson says, \but you never know. In 1965, the average size of a fraternity chapter was 50 members. But by the early seventies it had dropped to a low of 34. For about the last ten years, it's been increasing again, and now we're back to an average of 50 members per chapter.\ But on individual campuses, some chapters are worrying their growth period may be ending. \We've seen kind of an up- and-down period the last few years,\ says , Martin Cunniff, president of the InterfraternitY Council at Loyola- New Orleans. \In 1979-80,. membership really went up. Then it dipped a bit last year.\ This fall, only 12 people showed up at rush, Cunniff says. At Wesleyan. University, greek leaders are blaming a low rush turnout on increased academic competition. \Freshmen are inundated\ with school work, says Chuck Wyatt, president of Wesleyan's Psi Upsilon. lie believes many students have delayed pledging until they get control of their studies. Some of he other Wesleyan fraternities have · also noted drops in the nmnbers of pledges this fall. In respanse, some plan stepped-up publicity efforts and second\-semester rushes this spring. One of the .few houses te prosper at Wesleyan is a coed fraternity. Alpha Delta Phi broug~t in a campus-high .17 new m~mbers last semester. Thelessonbasn't been lost on other nervous greek organizations. Groups at ·Amherst, M-iddlebury, Columbia · and New York University, among others, have recently converted into coed houses tn order to boost memberships. Two Bowdoin College fraternities; partly to com_ply wUh affirmative actions policies and partly to draw new members, are becoming coed this fall. · \The coed fraternity is still a v,ery small part of the total greek system,'' Anson reports, \and I'm not convinced it's all that effective (a recruitment tool}. But I do believe frater- nities need to keep .promoting themselves. I have long ad- vocatedthat ruslfbe a continual thing in order to attract new members during the year. And fraternities need to stay visible and explain their advantages and what they're all about.\ At Lehigh University, however, Delta Upsilon has had a tougher time promoting its \advantages'' -since head football coach Jolm Whitehead reportedly told his players to avoid it._ \He thinks we're a bad in- fluence on his players,\ says house president Jonathan Foltz. Whitehead admits advising some players to avoid DU because ''they don't police their own house\ and \I don't want my players to carl'y the stigma of .a bad reputation.\ Besides, he says DU is already \overloaded with athletes.\ Foltz says the incident \will certainly hurt our rush.\ MEMBERS ONLY® \When you put it on;. .. something happens.'' ~k That \something\ is special for the two of you ... the original top-st~tus jacket you want to connect with! · Superlooks, with epaulets and strap-collar.

Fashions tor GUyS & Gals Mohawk Malt Schenectady (CPS)-Wbile the University of Mississippi celebrated 20 years of black-white integration last week, the Mississippi University for Women was managing to finish its second month of male..:female in- tegration. The women on the carn,pus, which began 100 years ago as the first state--supported college for women, aren't taking it quite as violently as Ole Miss took integration 20 years ago, but they aren't all that )lappy about it, either. ''I was against men on campus when I came..her:e, and I'm stUl against it,'' says Lisa Hux, a freshman physical therapy major. \The men are an intrusion,\ g;rouses freshman psych major Sharon Pittman. ''I don't think they belong here, and I believe the rest of the school feels this way.\ But there are indeed 83 men on c~pus, for the first time in MUW's history. Their arrival, greased by a July U.S. Supreme Court decision forcing the university to open its nursing .program to men, just about ends the history of public all- women colleges in this country. The men's arrival leaves ·Texas University for Women in Denton, Texas as the sole remaining publically - sup- ported school for women, and further thins the ranks of women's colleges in general. The 300~some women's colleges of 1960 have dwindled to 112 today. Of them, all but TUW are private. Even TUW has 400 men on campus, though it still forbids them to enroll in certain academic programs. Women's colleges have ironically become an en- dangered species at a time when- applications to MUW, TUW and the others are rising. Educators cite many reasons for the renewed interest. A Brown University study last spring suggested that women do better academically at alla female schools, and often emerge from four years of coed education with lower self- esteem than they had when they began. \The benefits are clear,\ says Lu Stone, spokeswoman for Mount Holyoke College. \There's lack of stereotype, especially in math and science. For a woman who is serious about developing herself on all levelS, a woman's college .is ideal., \Women get a better deal on a single-sex campus,'' asserts MUW publicist Margaret Kaye. The Supreme Court didn't discuss educational or develepmental issues when it forced MUW to admit men. Reading the majority 5-4 opinion, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor said MUW had ~o open its nursing program. to men because .it wasn't keeping men out for any compelling reason, such as trying to rectify past discrimination against women at the school. Three weeks after the decision, MUW annowiCed it would open all its programs to men. \It was only a matter of time before another court case (was filed to open the other programS),\ Kaye explains. \So the state Board of Trustees directed us to admit men. But the board did reaffirm our charter, and we do not have to actively recruit men.\ Without recruiting them, 83 men showed up, giving MUW a 22 percent enrolhnent increase, one of its biggest ever. · The one many who didn't show up was roly-poly Joe Hogan, who in 1979 was turned away from MUW's nursing program and then filed the lawsuit that eventually forced MUW to integrate. Hogan, says lawyer Wilbur Colom, recently divorced and re-married. That, \plus the pressure of having five news crews following him around campus,\ convinced Hogan to · delay his education for a while. \I think it's crummy of Joe Hogan to do this, and then not come here,'' complains student Hux. \Most of my friends hate this,\ adds senior Willie May Leenior. ''But we must abide by the Supreme Court decision and treat them equally.\ Colom, Hogan's lawyer, believes students at other single-sex campuses will have to be making similar com- promises soon. He questions whether TUW or the five remaining all-male public. colleges can maintain their exclusivity. \There is an argument as to whether the. .federal government can fund single-sex schools for either sex.\ Title IX of the Higher Education Amendments of 1972 forbids federal funding of programs that discriminate on the basis of gender. But Title IX also exempts traditionally single-sex campuses that meet , certain broad guiQ,elines. Colon pursued his case under the 14th Amendtp.ent, which guarantees equal .protection under the law to all citizens, and which opponents of the proposed Equal Rights Amendment argued was all that was needed to stop sex discrimination. In August, Philadelphia parents used Pennsylvania's ERA to sue to have their 12- year-old daughter admitted to all-male Girard College, an elementary and secondary school. Girard is private, but publically administered. The case is pending. Last year the town of Whately, Massachusetts tried to strip all-female Smith College of its property tax exemptions on the grounds Smith's women- only admissions policy violated that state's ERA. Smith successfully fought the case. Most observers, however, are confident the MUW case won't affect private women's colleges at all. \The Mississippi case was complex, but there are no implications for private schools,\ contends Marsha Sharp, director of the Women's College Coalition, a trade group of 67 all-female campuses. \There is no pressure on us at all,\ reports ·or. Phyllis Bridges, vice president for academic affairs at TUW. The MUW case \was dif- ferent, because we already have male undergrads in nursing and also in our graduate programs,\ she says. \There isn't any one of us who doesn't agree with the rights under the 14th Amendment,\ Sharp adds carefully, \but sometimes issues aren't so clear-cut.\ Secrets· Of Managing A minute manager is for sale. It is not what you may thing- a managing expert who charges an hourly wage. Instead, it is a book of about 15,000 words of advice for $15. The title of this book is ''The One Minute Manager.\ Co- authors Dr. Spencer Johnson and Kenneth Blachard call it ''A gem-small, expensive and invaluable.\ In the 90 pages. of text,. they divulge their three management secrets: First establish your management· goals. Second, communicate those goals. And third, keep on wor.king towards them by giving OI).e-minute reprimands and one-minute praisings to all who are helping you to achieve those goals. Jo-hnson and Blanchard predict ''The One Minute Manager\ will be a best seller for many years because the market for the book includes everyone. Johnson explains that good managing is not just for business. It is a necessary skill for getting along in everything. Some book critics and professional managers think \The One Minute Mnagerh is just a book of common sense. The authors contend their ideas are revolutionary and that strict adherence to them can bring success. Whether or not prosperity falls to all who read their book, Blanchard and Johnson are sure getting their share. Of course, they have used careful management in the packaging and selling of the management secrets. In the early stages of the book, Blanchard distributed original manuscripts to executives who were attending one of his seminars. He asked them to make suggestions for im- provement. Other businessmen attending his seminars helped to push the book down the road of a best seller by purchasing more than 20,000 copies. Top executives have added their stamp of approval in the form of endorsements that are printed in the book. And of course, the authors are also promoting the book in the customary manner of touring many cities. More than 500,000 hardback copies of the book were sold in the first calendar year it was printed. The authors think many copies are being written off as a business expense. I. ::

Page 16 OONOORDIENSIS, October 21, 1989 The Campus lecture Tour r The Computer Agel LEXINGTON, KY. (CPS)- Michael Harrington finally got to speak at the University of Kentucky last week, but not to many people. Harrington, an influential author - his book helped in· spire President Lyndon Johnson's War on Poverty program - who is well•known and respected in political cir- cles as a democratic socialist but is none-too-famous in out- side circles, drew as few as 600 people over two days. Harrington, who always has a lot to say, almost didn't get to '>peak at all. A week before the iectures, some student politicians tried to cancel them. Harrington fans called the attempt political. The student politicians called it financial. So goes the campus lecture and entertainment circuit nationwide this fall. Many booking agencies report their campus business is off, that students increasingly prefer entertainment · oriented lectures by soap opera stars, and that they now insist even issue-oriented lectures be delivered by celebrities ih order to assure campus promoters of a profitable gate. \Students are tending to be celebrity- oriented, and not as issue - oriented as one would hope or imagine,\ reports Bob Davis of the American Program Bureau, who books acts on campuses nationwide. \Political bookings are good, but not where they should be,'' he adds. \Pizzazz celebrity is still a big draw.\ \Larger names are im· portant,\ agrees William Morris Agency lecture director Carl Bruckner. \Students are not as .. issue -oriented as they used to be, and big names are needed for issues.\ William Morris is booking Hodding Carter and former Secretary of State Alexander Haig on campuses successfully, Bruckner says. Davis says his \issue\ names aren't the draw they used to,be. Watergate tough-guy Gordon Uddy I who has made his living on the circuit the last three years, has had to team up With drug ad:vocate Timothy Leary to attract sufficient crowds in this, his fourth tour. · \John Dean,\ adds Davis, \is basically a standard. He's not as big as he was, but the tenth arrniversary of Watergate has , helped his status.\ At least one promoter sees the trencL going the other way, however. \Political speaking engagements have been in- creasing in the past two years, more so than five years ago,\ contends Michael Harpster of New Line Presentations in New York. \But even so, programmers in general shy away from dif- ficult subjects.'' \If a school has a nervous political administration, you will not have any con- troversies\ in a speakers' series, notes Dr. Gary English, director of the. National Association for Campus Activities, headquartered in Columbia, S.C. English cites a \large mid- western state university,\ which he declines to name, where students booked a speaker on nuclear reactor safety. ''A member of the board of regents heard about it and called the vice chancellor. The program was cancelled, although the subject was not very controversial. It's not like having Timothy Leary drop acid on stage.\ Kentucky student Senator Tim Freudenberg, who spon- sored the Harrington lecture funding bill, attributes the Senate's initial refusal to allocate money on politics, too. \This is a conservative campus, and there are paranoids worried about Mom, God, an<l The American Way,\ he asserts. \Some senators didn't want their names associated with a socialist, even a democratic socialist.\ \We did want to bring him,\ insists Vice President David Bradford, who broke a tie by voting against Harrington. \It's good to have people from all Women's Colleges Campus Digest News Service Women's colleges are doing just fine. While other educational in- stitutions are beseiged with heavy financial pressures and declining enrollments, the 116 all-women colleges in the nation are filling up with more students and more money. Their good fortune does not mean they are exempt from trouble, however. Most women's colleges had their share of trouble in the 1960's. At the beginning of the decade, they numbered 300 strong until the sudden em- phasis on coeducation. began shutting a lot of their doors, and the dwindling enrollment sparked a lot .of financial worries. Now declining numbers of students and money problems are troubling all educational institutions. Because of their past experience with tough times, women's colleges are prepared to weather the storm. First, they are ready ,to handle the cuts in federal aid and scholarships with support from their alumnae, who have proven to be very geenerous with their money. Most colleges attract donations from only 18 per cent of their past graduates. On the average, women's · colleges draw contributions from one-third of their former students. Second, women's colleges are ready to snap up their share of the dwindling number of people attending colleges. They already have 2 per cent of the college population, or about 125,000 students. And they will continue to attract the numbers because of the unique appeal they have for women, according to Marcia Sharp, executive director of the Women's College Coalition. , The attraction they offer students is more than just education for women by women. Most of the women's colleges have been changing their liberal arts programs to include women's issues and technical skills that have been normally considered for men only. Many have been adding special programs for older women who are now returning to school. The changes women' s· colleges have been making are working. In the last decade, enrollment has risen 25 per cent for all 116 schools, compared with 18 per cent for private coeducational colleges. The renewed vitality of women's colleges is partly attributed to the strength of the women's movement in the mid- 70's. The attention given to women's rights and wo:q1en in general made it socially ac- ceptable for a woman to seek the company of other women. But the fact that women's colleges are populated with all women does have some drawbacks, especially students interested in dating men. To accomodate those who seek the opposite sex, the Smith prospectus has a map that lists the miles to the nearest coeducational schools. facets, and. he's certainly dif· ferent. But the money was not right.'' The government finally agreed to allocate money for Harrington, whose .fee was $1300, when several other student groups put up matching funds. · The concern for funding and potential gate receipts \has becotne overriding this year,\ reports. a spokeswoman with Minnesota's Program Hoard. \As much as we might want to hear someone, if he won't draw, we won't listen to his agent anymore.'' As of the end of last week, Kentucky student President Jim Dinkle said Harrington had broken even. By contrast, former Sen. George McGovern drew 2000 to a UK lecture a year ago. Things are also tough for musical acts, which are more expensive to stage, even though they may have big names. ''Colleges,\ says Nat Burger, another William Morris agent, ''don't have money like they used to for rock acts. College buying is down, espeCially for this year.'' Campus promoters are being \very selective,\ but typically \can't afford shows of a smaller nature that they want to do, like Devo.'' Enter, new technology. University of Wisconsin students, for example, will pay $3.98 for a three - dimens~onal Devo concert to be broadcast October 31st live from Los Angeles via satellite by the Campus Entertainment Net- work. Campus Digest News Service Enrolling at Stevens IIU~titute of Technology will cost you $750 more if you are a science major. The added price tag on one kind of education does not mean Stevens is trying to discourage science ma}ors from coming to the school. They just want all of them to own their own com- puters. EdwardA. Friedman, dean of the college in Hoboken, N.J., said computers are so much a p;;trt .of life that they need to be censidered .an extension of man's ability to solve problems. So Stevens became the first college in the nation to require microcomputers for classroom work. Officials at the Insttitute were reluctant at first to add the extra expense to the all\eady high cost of education. They decided to ease their suffering consciences hy offering a 40 per cent discount on the ·required \textbook which includes an Atari 800 system with microcomputer, recorder, video screen .and·carrying case.

Approximately 110 students at Stevens already own their own computers. On one dormitory floor, .almo~t every room has its own system. Use of the com- puters, however, varies from door to door. Some students use the.ir computers to store classroom work in a personal library. Whenever they encounter a · similar problem, they pull the program with the answer. Other students have been offered a chance to make their computers earn their keep. Some retail stores have been asking them to demonstrate their knowledge of the machines to the public. Still other science majors w-ith computers use their systems to turn their room into an arcade. . Instead of going some place else to plug quarters into' a machine, they play Star Raiders and Asteroids on their own private screens.

Indeed, while their students are indulging video gam.e fad§, an astoundingly diverse set of administrators ate indulging in plans to emulate the success of schools in the computer com- pany - dominated \Silicon Valley\ of northern California, and the research. campuses of Massachusetts. Those schools have built profitable relationships with nearby computer companies, which help fimd campus high- tech research, and then hire many of the school's. grads. Among those campuses that have recently announced ambitious plans to emulate schools with high tech programs: , -The University of New Mexico, which will spend some $20 million to become the training· ground and main research lab for the state's developing high tech industries. . -Penn State has construction · plans for a \high technologr park'' to draw high-tech companies to its area. -North Carolina has coma nutted $25 million to develop. a ''research triangle\ that will draw on neighboring Duke, North Carolina State and the University of North Carolina for manpower and research. -The city of New Haven, Connecticut is spending $10 -million to remake a deteriorating industrial area next to · ¥ qle into a high-tech company park - ~ThelJniversity, of Denver is making itself into a \wired campus,'' linked by sophisticated computer and information processing systems, and will soon re-open its engineering program. -The list goes on. Illinois is fashioning \.a network of high technology facilities associated with various Wliversities\ in the state. Massachusetts, Virginia, Mississippi, Missouri and Arizona campus planners are all working on projects that would draw more }Ugh-tech businesses to depressed areas by making area campuses into manpower and research poools. \What's happening is that a number of universities are creating arrangements with hJgh tech industries,\ un- derstates Dr. W. Edward Leare of the American Society for Engineering .Education. ~ \But I think it's good. Not just the financial support, but the interaction between education and industry can be very beneficial.\ . .\This new linking,\ adds Michael Berrier of the American Association for State Colleges and Universities, \is very productive.\ , _ Berrierlikes tying colleges to- local e~onomies, and believes \state governments are willing to put more money into the universities in areas that will produce engineers; program• mers and scientists to fuel high tech industries.\ But Qthers .fret about unhealthy corporate sway over campuses, established -by the huge amounts of money that the private concerns can pump into ;academic programs.

''I don't think the students really see all th~ technology and industry coming here, the specialization, the outpouring of money,\ Michigan's Moore says. ''I see it, and I'm very concerned.\ \What I'm really worried about are the students,\ Bret Hornback, ari English prof at Michigan, says. \A university dedicated to robotics could very easily turn out students who are robots.\ \That's definitely a danger,\ agrees Lfnda C. Mahan, president of the Association for Humanistic Education and Development. \The long-range impact of higfi technology on higher education can't be ignored. I'm all for schools re- gearing to take .advantage of new technology and new toools, but let's balance that with a good liberal arts education.\ \What is missing in much of this talk about high technology is the central importance of intellectual planning,.\ adds Bob Beyers of Stanford · University. \That does not mean everybody sits down to decide on luring industry the way a chamber of commerce would do it.\ But. even high tech en- thusiasts carefully pay respects to the liberal arts. High tech, says New Mexico engineering Dean Gerald May, is \what we're building on. But . . . ·· a good university also requires a good department of Eng:lish or philosophy.'' \We're certainly · going to make sure that some programs are not forgotten at the expense of others,\ says Michigan's Gamota. University of Denver Chancellor Ross Pritchard simply dismisses the concern, contending a lopsided marriage with private companies isn't ''a significant threat to us.\ At Michigan, there is already some academic realignment. \On the one hand,\ says Moore, \we have this dedication to bigh technology, and on the other side you see things like the art school, being reviewed for possible elimination, or the natural resources and the education schools getting cut back.\ Puzzle Answer (CPS)-Geo.rge Washington University may soon raise its tuition not in order to raise more money, but to enhance its reputation. GW consultant Howard Holcomb recommended that \without . apology\ the university should charge \much higher tUition\ based not on the university's need for · money \but on the qulity of education\ at GW. G W is currently enjoying \good financial standing,'' a campus spokeswoman says. But higher tuition, Holcomb said in his report, would help erase the school's \image . problem.\ GW President Uoyd ElUott hited Holcomb last spring to examine GW's \internal and external image.\ ·· Holcomb concluded in his study that, in the words of spokeswoman Jane Lingo, GW ''was worth more than the tuition we were charging.\ Despite being at a ''ranking world university,\ Holcomb wrote, GW students tend to disparage the school. Holcomb attributed student grumbling to GW being \a non- rural campus, the lack of a football team, and the fact that many students had as their first choice one of the Ivy League schools. The students,\ he ad~ed, \tend to be cynical. \Life/' sighs spokeswoman Lingo, \is hig:hly subjective.\ She suspects G W students really don't complain more about their educations than do students at other schools, but the carping does hurt the image of a university struggling to establish its reputation as one of the best in the country. GW is priced below other private schools in Washington, but above private colleges natiinally. Full-time GW undergrads are paying $4900 in tuition this year, compared to $5750 at Catholic University, $6200 at American University, and $6830 at Georgetwon, ·Lingo reports. Average tultion at four-year private colleges nationwide is $4021, according to a recent College Board study. Students at most schools, public and private, are being asked to pay more for less obscure reasons. Decreased federal and state higher education funding forced at least a dozen schools into emergency mid-year tuition hikes last December in order to meet institutional bills, a College Press Service survey of February, 1982 found. Administrators blame declining state revenues mos.t =+-::+':\-~-::-+.~ . often for presenting them with. a ..::-+:-~~ . choice of either cutting services . Gr raising tuition. A recent Education Com- mission of the States survey discovered administrators expect state funding to continue to lage behind iilflation at least through 1985 .. Georgia colleges, noting that the state is collecting less tax ~oney than it expected, last week agreed not to spend $14 million of their budgets until the recession's impact on the state becomes clearer later in the year. The result of such fiscal uncertainties, summarizes Penn State budget director Loren Furtado, is that \the burden for paying for higher ·education over the last ten years has falled dispropor- tionately on the students and their families.\ Two weeks ago, for example, the Minnesota Higher Education Coordinating Board proposed to make all state college students- regardless of their ability to pay - pay half their education costs in order to qualify for any financial aid from the state. The measure is one of a legion of somewhat exotic new tuition proposals aim':!d to help colleges pay their bills while keeping college within students' financial reach. To raise cash, Marquette now allows students to pay for more than one year at a time, but exempting them from any future tuition increases. Hope College lets students pay off tuition monthly. Still other schools are selling short-term tuition insura11ce policies to be cashed in as fees come due. However payments are scheduled, few schools have been able to avoid raising their fees. Northern Michigan students are paying 12 percent more this year. In Wisconsin, tuition is up 15 percent. City University of New York cam- puses raised tuition 16 percent this fall to compensate for an $18 million shortfall in state funds. Southern Methodist's is up a full 20.7 percent over last year. Maryland has already approved a nine percent hike for 1983. Students protest sometimes. Claiming Pennsylvania was \p\J.nishing working class students\ with a· $230 tuition hike, the Commonwealth Association of Students sued to stop the increase. A judge ruled against the students in early September. Last spring, University of Puerto Rico students shut down their university for four months in protest of a tuition hike. Closer to George Washington, 3100 American University students demonstrated last February over this year's tuition hike. GW student reaction to the proposed cosmetic hike has been loud but rhetorical, ac- cording to Lingo. \Students have shown a lot of interest in it. I think they realize sometimes it's good to take stock of where you are.\ The GW Board of Trustees will discuss the proposal later this month.

The Dutchwomen played a good game on the grass field, and neither team dominated first half play. At the end of the half the score was 1-0, Hartwick, but the Union women felt they could still :pull it off. Hartwick had different ideas, however, and after scoring ~ second goal, its players set the pace of the game.

Despite slippery conditions, Union .played a fine game offensively and defen- sively. Disappointingly, however, Union remained scoreless. Skidmore was also held scoreless the entire first half and thirty minutes into the second half, but they un- fortunately managed to slip in three quick goals in the last 15 minutes of play to win the match.

This time RPI outplayed Union and picked up three goals to score another victory.

RPI Drops Dutchmen Union's three game win streak came to an abrupt end Friday evening when the Engineers of RPI beat the Dutchmen 1..() in the annual homecoming weekend clash. RPI's lone :goal came on a breakaway sprint down the left side of the field, The goal was scored by a header, which was out of reach of Union goalie Mike Harris, just after the beginning. of the second half. The final score, however, was not indicative of the .flow of the A program on th:e upswing, an understatement to say the least.

The Dutchmen, under the leadership of ex-head coach Joe • Wirth, gained respectability in the circles of Div. HI Eastern· football last year. They got off to the best start for a Union team in many years. with. an early season record of 3-1-1. The campus was buzzing over the big wins against teams such as Georgetown, RPI, , and nationally ranked Albany State. The tie to Rochester and the loss · to Colby were forgotten. The · task at hand was to defeat Trinity, Williams and Mid- dlebury, all respected teams throughout the East. Seemingly, the momentum was theirs and the Dutchmen truly believed tbey could come out of this three week period with three wins and a new name for themselves in the .East. · But instead of a 7-1-1 record after these . games, the Dut- chmen returned hotne. with three straight losses and many throughout the East wondered if · the Dutchmen were truly growing into a power or just having a respectable year after many losing seasons. Coach AI . Bagnall, George Oberstadt and the rest of the Union football team find themselves in the same situation that they faced one year ago. From what I've seen so far this year, watch out Trinity, Williams, and Mid- dlebury, the Dutchmen are ready to take yet one more $tep beyon~ .last season's progress and fm1sh as one of the top Head coach Al Bagnoli constantly keeps defenses guessing as he continually uses both the fine receivers and backs that Union has on its rostel!. Receivers like Kellaher, Kraft,. Gibbons and Frederick are all threats to any defensive backfield that the Dutchmen will face this year. This mat- ched with the superlative running of Johnson, Huttner., Olsen and the tough offensive Garnet line, make Union'.s offense both powerful and multi•dimensional. A definite improvement over one year ago. Union· had one of the best defenses ii1 the East l~st year and it continues to eat up .op- posing offenses this year. Led by seniors Oberstadt and Steve Bodmer, Union returns almost all the players from last year's top defensive squad. Amazingly, they look even stronger than last. year and hope to make up for the 78-plus points that Trinity, Willi~ and Middlebury scored. on them one year ago. Last year's Dutchmen squad was good and compiled one of the best records in recent years, but they failed to cross the bridge whichAlBagnoli's squad finds themselves in front of now. Look for an inspired Union . team Saturday against Trinity that truly feels up to the task which last year's team failed to accomplish. Watch out, Eastern football, Union's ready to· take yet another step beyond in its quest for football power status in the East.

By LOU GEORGE Sports Staff Saturday the Dutchmen saw their season flash. before their eyes. Late in the first half the Dutchmen trailed the RPI Engineers by a touchdown. A comeback seemed dim con- sidering the.vital mistakes that the Dutchmen had already corrunitted. But if there is a team that can go from sluggish to sharp in a matter of minutes, it is the 1982 Dutchmen squad. In the first half, the Dut- terback Gary LaDuca, Union took the ball, ran three plays and attempted to punt the ball out of the endzone. A mishan- dled snap by Union's Mark McKelvey ended up in the hands of RPI's Jack Brooks for the first touchdown of the day. RPI held the lead until late in the second quarter when Dan Stewart drove 49 yards by mixing passes and runs very effectively. The Dutchmen had no fatal penalties in the drive that was capped by Stewart's 17-yard touchdown pass to Rich l Senior defensive tackle Steve BOdmer was named to the ECAC Weekly Honor Roll for his nine tackle, twelve assist and fumble recovery performance against R Pl. chmen did all they could to help Kellaher.

The team rolled over Hamilton by a score of 22-6 for its third victory in a row. It took no time for Union to put its first points up on the board. Steve Cole blocked a Hamilton punt and Steve Patterson moved in to recover it. Patterson then had to dump it back off to Cole who fed Keith Dean with it. Dean, who is just back after missing two games because of an injury, grabbed it and easily put it down behind the try-line for Union's first try of the afternoon. Tbe conversion was missed and the Garnet ruggers were on top 4-(). Several. minutes later a penalty allowed Hamilton a penalty kick which it made good to narrow the score to 4-3. But this was the closest the visiting team could come. Following a Garnet kick-off, Union's Pete Ladd quickly brought it downfi.eld into Hamilton territory. AftE!r a five-yard serum-down, Patterson 'WaS able to prevent the Hamilton serum-half from making a clean pass. Instead the ball rolled into the endzone and Patterson pounced on it 'for his first try of the season. Russ Backhouse converted the extra-points kick and Union was up 1o:3.

Junior Trustee Melissa Viglielmo Trustees By MARCY BURSTINER News Editor During Spring Term elections each year, a member of the sophomore class is elected into the two-year position of Junior Trustee. The-current Junior and Senior Trustees, Melissa Viglielmo and Karen Schick, respectively, met with Con· cordiensls to explain their role as representatives on the Board of Trustees, and to clarify some points on an article in last week's issue regarding the role the Student Trustees play. Karen, Schick,. presently a senior majoring in Physics and Biology, explained that the two students attend meetings of the Board of Trustees four times a year. Three out of the four seasonal meetings are held on campus, she continued, with the Winter meeting held in New York City. In the Winter, the Student Trustees are given enough money to cover travel expenses, one night in a hotel, and one meal. In expressing her disapproval of the article en• titled Trustee Duties Reviewed, Schick maintained that the position of Student Trustees is not as \glorious\ as some people may believe. She commented that her relationship toward the Board members, although benefiting ~.the student community, could have no practical benefits to her in particular. She went on to say that it is the responsibility of the Student Trustees to attend every Board meeting regar- dless of any personal scheduling confficts. Schick also expressed her disapproval of statements in the article regarding the obligation of the Trustees to make their responsibilities and actions more publicized to the student body. Schick commented that during the time that she ran for office she visited each dorm and spoke to many students ex- plaining in detail the respon- sibilities the office entails. Both Schick and Viglielmo, the current Junior Trustee and presently an economics major, agree that it is the respon- sibility of the students on campus to know who their representatives are. When voting, students shoUld also be aware of the responsibilities of each office before electing a student to that position. According to the two students, their role is to \represent by vote and influence,\ student opinion on the Board of Trustees. In addition, they represent the Board on the Student Forum and act as voting representatives in the student government. Vigllelmo explained that they try to be as objective as possible in representing other students. Yet at the same time, she went on, the students elect the Trustees as representatives and must trust them to act on their own convictions. Both agreed that the fact that the position is held for two years lends a sense of continuity to the office. f\ f, ' ' i ~ ·' Senior Trustee Karen Schick Clarify Because of this, the Student Trustees tend to be more out- spoken, and speak \from the heart.\ As Schick explained, ''I usually separate my opinions from the opinion I feel is that of the whole campus. I (point out to the Trustees) which opinions are just mine.\ Role \We bad to talk candidly about mandatory health in- surance ... something they didn't want to do anft;hing about.\ In the end tough,. she explained, the Board realized that they had to adopt some form. of a man- datory health policy for the college and which was put into effect this year. At the moment, they both agreed, \things are running well.\ Schick added ''It is a quiet time--not .problematic.\ Some issues which are presently under discussion before the Board include the search of a· new head of the C'areer and Counseling Center, discussions of a five-year plan for Computer Services .• the fire hazards of several fraternity houses . not ,owned by the campus, the new college drinking. policy, and the renovations to Davidson dor- mitory scheduled for this summer, which would replace the empty storage spaces with additional rooms. · , Updat• on Mideast Goodman Speaks By SHER'RY WEITZEN .Staff ' Last Friday evening Hirsch Goodman spoke to a crowd of Union students, faculty, and friends abaut the situation in Israel and the Lebanon Crisis. Goodman is the defense correspondent and strategic analyst for ttie Jerusalem Post, as well as the Israel Correspondent for the London Post. In his lecture, Goodman adctressed the current issues affecting Israel and the coun.: try's survival, including the subject of the war in Lebanon. .Goodrru;tn· began his lecture by clarifying and defining the situation in the Middle East. He said, \The Middle East is a hodgepodge of turmoil .. \ There is not only the Arab-Israeli conflict, but conflicts exist between many of the Arab nations. He gave the ·examples of the Iran-Iraq war, among others. He sununarized his opinion of the chaos in the. Middle East by saying, \The basic problem is there is no one to address, there is no simple formula, there is no simple solution. The Middle East is perhaps one of the most com- plicated parts of the world.'' He continued by defining the Palestinian Liberation Organization as \a microcosm of the madness of the Arab world.'' The PLO is not .a united organization run by one leader. There are quite a few 8roups which are not cohesive and do not even support the same issues or leaders. Goodman then began to ad .. dress the issues of Israel's survival. He stressed tbat Israel must project an \image of strengtl)\ in order to stay alive. Israel must prev.ent war because any war will endanger .its eXistence. Wars demoralize the people, dissuade others from immigratingto Israel, and ruin any chance for economic stability. Goodman ·stated that the Arab Nations, knowing any strike will hurt Israel in these ways, continue to. challenge the .country. Therefore, Goodman believes that Israel must ap- pear very strong, so that any attack on it would be more harmful to the attacker. Israel is having more and more problems projecting the \image of strength'' it needs. Goodman classified these problems in three categories: quantitative, qualitative, and economic. The quantitative problem is that Israel cannot keep up with the balance of power. The Arabs are becoming· increasingly stronger because of their supply of weapons. Arab nations have spent 81 billion dollars on arms since 1974. They have more tanks and aircraft. combined than NATO. He emphas~ed that 69 percent of these. arms are purchased from the West. \Given the fact that the Arabs have the petro <!ollars, and given the fact that the West,. and I stress the West, is prepared to sell anything and everything petro dollars can buy, it is becoming increasingly impossible for Israel.\ As long as Arab nations have oU, they can continue to build defense, and Israel must keep up to survive. Each Student Trustee serves on two Board Subcommittees such as Finance, audget, and Audit, College Resources, Academic Affairs, and Student Mfairs. The committees meet independently, discuss their individual agendas, and then meet for a general Board meeting. Each meeting, they commented, ls seasonal. The swnmer meeting, for instance, is concerned primarily with the approval of degrees conferred upon graduates. Every Board member must sit in on all his committee meetings and can only vote on the committee to which he or she is a member. Schick remarked that only on the Student Affairs Sub- committee, of which they are both members, do they have any real effect. On committees such as Finance, she further explained, issues become \very technical and unap· proachable.\ She believes, tho.ugh, that the i.ndividual Board members make an at~ tempt te make the issues more comprehensible to the Student Trustees. lAM Accredited The qualitative problem is tha~ the Arab$ are getting just as sophisticated in arms as Israel, including F-16s, phan- toms, etc. Because of the economic problems, Israel cannot afford to impro:ve these arms. He believes that although Arab nations· are not united now, they may be one day, and together they would unite against Israel. Therefore Israeli strategists must ·be realistic and . work on \worst case probability.\ Viglielmo and Schick both believe that the Board members do take their opinions into consideration. After a while they explained, the individual members \get to know what you're like.'' The first year, Schick remarked, is spent mostly observing. One's first impression is that the Trustees would rather not have student representation, but \most of them really want (the students) there ... They go out of their way to make us feel comfortable.\ When asked if the fact that she was the first female Student Trustee to serve on the Board made her job difficult, She replied that it did, but only at first. One must consider, she explained, -that the Board members were just getting used to female students on campus, let alone the Board of Trustees. \Of course you are in· timidated,'' Viglielmo remarked, \as you are with anybody who is established.\ Schick added that one feels \awed you feel the difference but .not harshly.\ They both agreed that the Board members are interested and often enthusiastic about certain campus issues. They like to hear, Schick noted, that the students appreciate the campus improvements made. I~ pleased the members, she explained, to hear that the new artificial turf was used by many . students every day. · Occasionally, Schick ad- mitted, controversial issues on campus do develop. She gave as an example the issue which arose last year of insurance for the different clubs on campus. By SRARONBEILENSON Staff Union's MBA program in Health Systems Administration, a part of the Institute of Administration and Management (lAM) has recently been accredited by the Accrediting Commission on Education for Health Services Administration. This makes Union's program one of twenty- nine such accredited graduate programs in the country and the only one offering a five-year MBA course of study.· · Dr. Eugene Schneller, Director of the Health Studies Center and Assocfate Professor of Administration and Management, said that ac- creditation fs apt to bring more national recognition, as well as federal funds,. to the program which has been in effect for several years but has failed to receive much attention. Accreditation of a specific program at a college or university requires that the school initially submit a survey document containing professors' reswnes and other p.ertinent information. The school then has three years in which to adopt certain stan- dards that are set by the ac- crediting commission and distributed to the schools. In Health Systems Administration, for example, the Commission mandates that in order for programs to receive accreditation they must teach and teach well administration theory, C()ilcepts and sltUls, elements of health services, and health facility functions. Anytime during that three-year period an acting administration officer of the · .college or university j in this case Vice- President for Academic Affairs Dr. D'Andrea, may call the Commission to invite a member to the school in order to see if the basic standards are being followed and if the information presented in the initial survey document is valid'. If these basics are in order, a team of commissioners is sent to closely review the program course by course to evaluate the teaching and to determine if the goals of the program are being met. If accreditation is granted, the program is subject to periodic checks later on. Union will be visited again in the fall of 1985. The team that visited Union was comprised of. experts in Health Services Management and Administration from the Schools of BUsiness at Tulane, the University of St. Louis, and the University of Chicago. Schneller ·said that the ac- creditors were particularly impressed with the fact that tJnic'l, by being in the Capitol District, ts accessible to resources not available at many other schools. For example, Mildred Shapiro, Commissioner Continued on page 5 Goodman · then began to confrontthe Palestinian issue in relation to Israel's quest for peace. \As long as the Palestinian problem is alive, there will always be a question mark over Israel's legitimacy.\ Israel wants to solve the Palestinian problem but the PLO wants to perpetuate it. Goodman stated that .if the PLO did want a Palestinian nationj it would have at least considered the·camp David Accords which allowed for negotiations for such a state in the West Bank and · Gaza. Goodman stated emphatically, \The Camp David Accords, in my opinion, are the moral equivalent of the Balfour Declaration of the Palestinian People if they would have said yes.\ Goodman voiced his disap- Contlnued from page 5 1983-83 WINTER TERM PREREGISTRATION NOTICE Preregistration materials for winter term 1982.83 will. be a:vailable at the Office of the Registrar, Silliman Hall, beginning Monday, November 8th.

Mic))ael Novak,· the · distinguished writer. scholar · and activiSt had come to Union . to . speak of American . capitalism. Many of those in the crowd had also attended the lecture given one week before by John Kenneth Galbraith. Most commented about the . scheduling of two such opposite . speakers and of the incredible debate which could have taken • place if only the men had been presented together. Novak, born in Johnstown_, Pennsylvania, graduated from · StonehillCollege, the Gregorian · · University in Rome, Catholic . University and Harvard University, where as a teacher and a student he earned his M.A. in 1966. He then taught at Stanford, where for two of his three years there he was voted · orie of two \most influential professors\ by the senior class. ·. -Novak has attained success in many areas. He has been a speechwriter 'for such people as Edmund Muskie, Sargent Shriver and George McGovern. · In both 1981 and 1982 he was · appointed by President Reagan as the Chief of the U.S. • Delegation to the U.N. Human . Rights Commission Meeting in Geneva. Novak's most recent book has best helped to bring him into the public eye. The book is The . Splrit of Democratic Capitalism. Jack Kemp has said of this book, 'l believe it shall become a classic.' and Irving Kristol, Editor of the Public Interest, said, 'this is the first book to provide us with a critical appreciation of · democratic capitalism from a theological point of view .. ' On Monday, Novak divided his speech into three separate points. The first of these raised a question. He asked, \why must we defend capitalism?\ He said that in a world which two centuries ago was universally poor., why must we defend the one system which has worked: American capitalism? Novak feels that we . should not have to defend ourselves before poople who continually try to imitate us. Secondly, he stated that American capitalism is a war of ideas. Not on_ly do our beliefs tend to divide one person from the other but they most often divide our own hearts. He states that American capitalism tends to be a war of real ideas. Novak feels that in the areas of humanities and social sciences there is hardly a voice in favor of capitalisin, although these same peQple still believe in democracy. Novak also stated that most conservatives within the humanities field are anti- capitalist. In relation to the war of ideas, Novak said, 'in the. world in which we live, symbols and ideas are often much more powerful than reality.' Novak feels that if you lose the war of ideas you lose everything. Would you like t!» get involved in Concordiensis? -News Writers are Needed Call 6155 ...... His third point was rather broad. He tried to describe those themes of virtue; of life; of spitit: without which one cannot even imagine a democratic capitalist society. Novak spoke of our system in the United States, which is actually three systems working at once. They are separated into the political, economical, and moral- cultural sectors. All are suspiciot1S of one another so as to keep a balance of power. According to Novak, this syste~ has created a highly sociable group of people, Americans. We have created a society where of 100,000,000 working people, about sixteen million are working for the Fortune 500 and about sjxteen million people are working for the state, government and local. · In support of capitalism Novak said 'fifty years ago we could say the business of America is America but today the business .of America is making life dif· ·ficult for businessmen.' Interns Needed The Independent Student Coalition (ISC) is a nonprofit, nonpartisan organiz~tion representing the higher education public policy in- terests of more than 300,000 students enrolled at New York State's independent colleges and universities. The ISC is the only officially recognized statewide organization through which students at independent campuses determine those higher education public policies they believe to be in their best interests and which are most -constructive to New York's postsecondary system. The ISC operates on two fundamental principles: educational opportunity should be ~based on the ability to learn rather than the ability to pay, and students are proper· par- ticipants in the public policy making process which affects their education and the welfare of their schools. More specifically, the ISC' s mission is to: protect crucial student financial aid programs which are threatened with disman· tlement and possible extinction; repair programs which no longer meet originally-intended objectives; and promote public policies which will afford all students the ability to choose the institutions which are best suited to their needs, abilities and aspirations. The ISC is financed by voluntary dues support of the established student associatio~s or governing bodies on each campus. It has a full-time executive director and public policy intern staff, headquar- tered in Albany. Public Administration - one position available per term. Designed for a student studying public or business administration, this internship acquaints the student-intern· with the managerial operations of a not-for-profit organization. The position requires a high degree of personal motivation and innovation. Responsibilities of the intern include: office management, organizational development, bookkeeping and coordination of the intern staff. The public administration in- tern serves as administrative assistant to the ISC executive director. Public Mfairs - three positions available per semester. This internship is designed for students whose .studies are related to communications, journalism, public affairs or public relations. The position requires .exceptional writing and oral conununications skills. Three major ISC activities are the responsibility of the public affairs interns: monthly publication of an ISC newsletter; drafting and cir- culating periodic news releases to the state and local media; coordination of a statewide network of independent campus student newspaper editors. Public affairs interns are also responsible for editing and proofing all official ISC correspondence. Public Policy - three positions available per semester. Developed especially for students studying economics, government, public policy, political science or politics, ISC public policy interns will acquire firsthand knowledge of the state and federal legislative process as well as grassroots advocacy politics. Each intern is assigned to specific regions of the state with a certain number of independent sector campuses and legislative districts. The assignment is to develop If wellw informed student constituency by generating frequent in- l!ontinued on _page 4 Relocation of Administrative Offices · I Administration BuDding Second Floor: Office of the President-Ext. 6101 Second Floor: Office of the Vice President for Academic Affairs-6102 Second Floor: Office of the Executive Associate to the President-6096 Second Floor: Office of the As~istant to the Vice President for Academic Affairs-6103 First Floor~ Office of the Vice President for Finance & Administration-6104 First Floor: Office of the Comptroller-6020 First Floor: Office of the Purchasing Director-6127 or 6107 First Floor-Back Wing: Cashier's Office-6196 Basement Level: Accounting Office-6106, 6001 Basement Level: Payroll-6105 Becker Hall Second Floor: Office of the Business Manager-Ext. 6005 Second Floor: Central Scheduling-6098 ..Silliman Hall Second Floor: .Health Services-Ext. 6121 First Floor: Personnel Office-6108 First Floor: Registrar's Office-6109 Physical Plant Building Security Office--Ext. 6178 Dii·ector of Security-6358 Physical Plant-6181

Sue Stucke will conduct an open meeting in the Deans' Conference Room, in. Science-Engineering S-100. The program at Mystic Seaport, which is recognized for credit at Union, will run two sessions next year (1983-84)--a Fall Semester (sept. 5-Dec. 20, 1983) and a Spring Semester (Jan. 31- May 15, 1984). Union College is one of eighteen colleges invited to recommend students. Recept participatants include Robert Leary and Adam Brodsky, both '83. Ruth Ewing, '84, has been accepted for this year. Ms. Stucke will discm;s the program, answer questions, and show slides of activities at Mystic, on shore and aboard ship. All interested _students are urged to attend, and may procure !Jrochures and applications at any time from Dean Nelson in )cience-Engineering 8-100. Applications will be due locally no ater than Feb. 1, 1983. All candidates will be expected to drrange an interview and. tour of the facilities at Mystic Seaport Museum. After disputes with the Department of Education, Congress has finally approved legislation setting student aid rules for 1983-84. What this means for students is that the eligibility requirements will not be stricter than this acadeinic year with only a few changes to compensate for inflation. The Department of Education had proposed stiff restrictions but these proposal ideas were not shared by the education committees in Congress. Due to the uncertainty of the eligibility standards, however, the process applications for federal aid have just started to be printed. Students will not be seeing these fonns untU January or later as compared to November in normal years. College freshmen have been reconsidering their choice of colleges due to the financial situation of the country and their own economic situation. This has causedcan unusual amount of forfeited deposits in the private sector, causing anxiety for college admissions officials. In order to insure placement somewhere, students are risking fo(feit and placing deposits in more than one college. Some admissions staff feel that students are \just buying more time\ when making deposits without consideration of prospective students or the college administration. Thus, some colleges are thinking of raising their deposit amount to $500 instead of the usual $100 or $200. One major factor of these high forfeits appears to be the economic situation of the country and it reflects doubts about whether students and their families can afford private colleges in the face of souring tuition rates and declining Federal tuition assistance according to admissions officials. As students are forced to leave the Ivy League schools due to economic reasons, there appears to be other students moving up to these selective and expensive schools which is the second major factor of the forfeits. On the whole, however, there is definitely a movement from private to public schools among the middle-class students. The Orlando String Quartet will present an evening of chamber music at Union, Wed., Nov. 3 at 8 p.m. in Memorial Chapel. The concert is part of the Schenectady Museum-Union concert series. At Union, the quartet will perform Haydn's Op. 54, No. 1 in G; Dvorak's Op. 96in F {\American\), and Beethoven's No.9 inC, Op. 59, No.3 (Rasumovsky No.3). Tickets are $6 for the general public and $3 for students, and are available at the Schenectady Museum, Community Box Offices, and at the door. Further information is available by calling the museum at 372-3651. The Grace Foundation has awarded Union a $20,000 grant, payable in yearly installments of $10,000, announced President JohnS. Morris. The grant is an unrestricted contribution to the Campaign for Union. The Grace Foundation, In(!., is a. company-sponsored foundation incorporated in 1961 in New York, with funds donated, by W.R. Grace & Company, an international industrial concern. ISC Offers Internships Continued from page 3 terchange betwe~n state and federal tawmakers and student leaders.

First year un- dergraduates are ineligible and only exceptional sophomores will be chosen. Strong academic records are preferred, but the ISC selection committee will ta-ke all aspects of each student's profile into con- sideration. The ISC Intern Program is a practical educational ex- perience. Accordingly, it is designed for students who can arrange full-time status and credit for the .internship with their academic institutions. Credit must be arranged by the student through the appropriate program office and academic department. To the extent possible, the ISC will assist candidates rn developing programs which are suitable to particular institutional and program requirements. ,Unless arranged otherwise, all interns work out of the ISC central office in Albany. While schedules are flexible, each intern is expected to work a minimum of thirty-five hours per week. This includes work in the office and in the field. All interns work under the supervision amldirection of the ISC executive director, .but are answerable academically to their institutional program , sponsors. Interns are expected to meet With tbeir. progrrun sponsors at least twice during . the term.

He empl'lasized that Reagan ~hould get the accords going again instead of making new proposals. The Lebanon crisis and the !mage of Israel in the world were the final issues with which Goodman dealt. Israelis are afraid to admit that they ate Israelis, because anti-semitic and antHsraeli feelings have been stirred up tl.wougbout the world because of this war. One question asked by. someone in the audience \\;as about the poor public relations on the part of Israel with respect tothis cdsis. The gentleman stated that it has become hard to defend Israel's actions. because of the bad publicity and shortage of. in- , formation released to the . public. He explained that Israel , was n9t allowed to photograph or broadcast the facts for the Begin has. a Parliamentary . majority of two and he must keep the members of the coalition together to get anything done and survive in parliament. Goodman ex- pressed distress over the in· creasingly conservative feeling among the youth who are beginning to believe that \might is right.\ Goodman feels Israel needs a new genera.tion of leadership. Goodman related that he was trying to ~ realistic about this war. :It .is possible that it could bring some good to the Middle East and Israel, like the defeat of the PLO, a Palestinian alternative to the issue of a state,. or establishment. of a stable pro-Western Lebanon, and security for the government of Israel. He· stated his belief that there are going to be conflicts ahead in lsrael's pursuit Qf peace~ To conclude his lecture, Goodman com- mented, ''This war has demonstrated to Israel that the Palestinian problem cannot be resolved by force, and it has been demonstrated to the Palestinians that the. problem of Israel cannot be resolved by force.'' ln order to educate our readers, The U~te Students for Cuomo organization. made available to Concordiensll a briefing paper on ·the Lieutenant Governo:r's positions. For those who have limited themselves to the land. of academe and have not picked up a journa~ic ·rag· in days, Mario Cuomo is the Democratic candidate for Governor of New York State. His opponent is Mr. ·· Lew Lehrman, millionaire and business executive. Cor· ciendlensls recently endorsed Mr. Cuomo for the office. Relevant to the concerns of students, Cuomo has come out in favor of increased student financial-aid. As stated in the e<Jitorial of October 21, the Lieutenant Governor supports increased Tuition Assistance PrQgrrup (TAP) benefits for upper division ,students, in- creased TAl? eliglbility for part- time stQ.dents and a New York State sponsored .student loan program. The proposed loan benefits would -be designed to make upcfor recent White House encouraged cuts in such aid.

The Arabs glo11ified some of the statistics, be con- tinued, citing one case in which they reported 600,000 casualties in one of the first battles .• when in fact there were only 361 deaths Within ·the first week. Goodman presented authentic documents, signed by Arafat, that wete captured. by ISrael. 'Yhe Palestinians' intentions were to attack Kiryot Shmona, Matula, and other Galilee settlements in Israel. Israel has lAM Honored an obligation to protect these towns, and needed to defend itself. The war in Lebanon is very , unpopular in Israel. The cost, the casualties, and the separations of families are among--the reasonsisrael wants to withdraw. Goodman felt that both Syria and Israel would withdraw, but each i$ holding out for the other; Syria because of its pride and Israel because of security. In his conclusion, .Goodman commented on the upeoming election in Israel. He feels that Israel will remain isolated Ito matter who wins the election, Begin or the Labor Party. Begin is the right wing candidate, but Goodman believes. that the Labor Party would not be better for Israel. It has done nothing in pursuit of peace, nor does it have any concrete policies. While answering a question ~rom the audience, Goodman informed the audience that Continued from page 2 of the Quality of Care for tlte - Mentally Retarded as well as a professional from the Health Department, teaches in the program. Schneller ad<b that the smallness of the school lends itself to personalized instruction not available at larger institutions. He at- tributes Union's small size and reputation as an undergraduate institution as reasons that lAM and the Health Administration have not received more at- tention. · , Dr. Schneller received his Ph.D in sociology from New York University. He was research project director at J'dontefiore Hospital and Medical Center and taught at D\Uke University Medical Center. He is a member ot the New York State Health Research Council. Dr. Josef Schmee is the Director .of the institute of Aclministration and Management. He received his Ph;D. in Adnllnistration and Engineering Systems from Union College. Dr. Schmee orgariized and was the director of · the Bureau of Health -Management Standards at the New York State Department of Health's Office of Health Systems Management. Currently there are twenty full•time students and nine part- time students in the two year graduate program, although some students have filed ap- plications to enter. The enrolled students ,have come from schools such as Brown, Bran· deis, Hamilton, SUNY Albany, and Union. Past graduates are working in various areas in- cluding consulting firms, state regulatory agencies, phar- maceutical firms and hospitals. Schneller recommends that students interested in pursuing . the five-year degree decide this by their junior year. A 3.0 gtade point average is necessary for acceptance into the five-year program, since certain un- dergradu~te courses may be counted toward one's graduate degree. Schneller said that he will be happy to speak with any student who is interested in finding out more about the Health Administration Program. His office is on the third floor of Bailey Hall.

If America is to regain its economic stride it will be by investing in our greatest resources, our peOple.\ on the topics of job and economic development, Cuomo presents what he considers to be a \realistic program\. Cuomo attacks Lew Lehrman's em- bracing of the supply-.side economics branded Reaganomics by the media. This firebrand 8olution to the death throes of our economy, claims the Lieutenant Gover- nor, has been ineffective in Washington and shoulq not be transplanted to New York State. Such actjons would be disastrous., implies the can- didate. According to the briefing paper, even major names on the State's Republican roster have been abandoning shi,p. State Senator John Marchi, Chairman of the Senate Finance Cominittee, is purported to have said \it would be illusory and misleading if I were to tell you that we can realize vast tax cuts and maintain essential services in the State of New York ... I am not going to savage public services.\ Included in Cuomo's pro- government involvement program are: -A temporary measure to place an expenditure cap on state spending: this would promote fiscal stability, claims the Lieutenant Governor, and help to secure a better credit rating. -A public works bond issue to l}elp finance the rebuilding of the State's decaying municipal infrastructure. -A tax reduction program: the candidate apparently finds worth in the idea that a reduction will provide relief for taxpayers. ~An ef(ort to ensure that New York's education and training programs are keeping up with the times. Much of the campaign rhetoric centers on the topic of crime. Both of the candidates share similar views on this volotile issue. Cuomo's ap-:- proach includes a retum to police street patrols, the fun- ding of an auxiliary force, a total ,reworkiilg of the court -system and a new prison bond Lssue. On the softer side of what appears to be a hard-line program, Cuomo sees need to provide alternative rehabilitation .programs in an attempt at \hwnane\ crime prevention. The briefing paper states that the candidate \believes in life imprisonment without parole for heinous crimes ... \ No official mention is made of ,capital punishment and it is the general consensus of campaign observers that Cuomo would follow in the steps of his predecessor if elected. On that delicate campus issue of women's rights, Cuomo is a known supporter of the now defunct Equal Rights Amend~ ment. The briefing paper is quick to add that the Lieutenant Governor is in favor of a State version of the above proposal. Among the issues that Cuomo feels New York should be in the advance guard of support are equal pay for equal work, women in decision - making roles in State government, and crisis centers for victims of domestic violence. The briefing paper underlined the following statement, the Lieutenant Governor's last comment related to women: \Mario Cuomo supports reproductive freedom for all women, regardless of age or economic status.\ The Upstate Students for Cuomo paper concludes with a listing of unrelated stances. The Lieutenant Governor wishes to abOlish mandatory retirement. Cuomo sees promise in a renewed promotional campaign directed at tourists. The can- didate feels there is a need for a Water Authority for con- servation purposes. Standing out on the page is a proposition to reform the elction laws so as to provide for a limit on cam- paign contrib\}tions and the phasing in of p'ublicly financed state-wide elections.

Page 6 CONCORDiliJN8lS, October S8~ 1981 FEATURES. Union's First Lady By FRANKLIN SCHNEIDER Staff To claim that Enid Mo~ris is an interesting person is a gross understatement. When con- versing with Mrs. Morris for this interview, a noticeable effort was made upon her part to make me feel as comfortable as possible. Though the meeting was primarily intended as an interview, it seemed a natural part of our discussion to include extraneous matters. l felt as if I had made a friend. Although Mrs. Morris is very modest, ·one cannot help but notice that she is a very special person. Several different topics were discussed, and Mrs. Morris' responses will follow in - this article. All of her re11ponses were definitelv worthwhile. The President and the First Llady have been here at Union for four years now. During that time, Enid Morris has grown accustomed to the. Union campus, and has· become very much a part ofit. \Union is .now our home. When we first arrived, we (my husband and I) were in the same situation as if we were freshmen. We did not know the area well. After a while, however, things im- proved. I feel now as if l am a part of the campus.\ The close proximity of the President's house to the student residence halls was commented upon. \The students are our neighbors. As a result, my husband and I try to meet many of the students. Through our efforts we know quite a few (students). We also try to invite students and student organizations to the house. The house is open to everyone.\ Just what are. her feelings about Union's student body? \I think the stud~ts are mar- velous. Union's students are enthusiastic and inquisitive. E.M.S. Strikes Above aU, they are in· teresting.\ Getting out and. meeting the students tends to be the norm for this charming woman. Besides having students over for dinner, she and Mr. Morris occasionally dine at West College. \This way we meet students we ordinarily would not come into contact with.\ Besides making the acquaintance of the students at Union, Mrs. Morris is involved in other campus related. ac- tivities. This term she is taking Professor Griggs' Liberal Learning Course (Technology in Historic Per11pective). No, she is not fulfilling requirements for a Union degree, Instead, Mrs. Morris provides another explanation. \Professor Griggs once .gave a lecture on the Brooklyn Bridge. As a result, I had wanted to take his class. I was unable to last year, so I decided to take his course this fall. l am fascinated by the lectures.\ . Mrs. Moriis also attends other lectures on campus whenever possible. Mrs. Morris also spends Ume working with the citizens of Schenectady. She is a member of the Red Cross Board and Freedom Forum. \It is im- portant for the college to be a good neighbor to Schenectady, as well as to the tri-city area. We try to have representatives of the community over to the house, to try to improve relations. I think relations between the college and the city have improved, as the people of Schenectady have become more aware of the important role that the students play in the com- munity.\ The subject soon changed from campus matters to her own personal views. In par- ticular, her feelings on women's rights: \I have always enjoyed my position in society. It is important for women to .be leaders if they possess the proper qualifications., As for Union's .female con- tingent: \It is important that the women on campus have role models to follow. Examples of these efforts include the fu- creased num·ber .of women faculty members and ad- ministrators.'' She has similar feelings about tile possibility of a woman president of Union. \Why not? Women are very capable peQple. If a female individual possesses the ability, she should receive the position. This can be evidenced by the increasing number of female presidents at other colleges and universities.'' Mrs. Morris has become an integral part of this campus. We are lucky to have her· as oUr first lady. Enid Morris, a most capable First Lady. The Dutchmen's Night By MICHAEL DEVITO Staff The Dutch Hollow Pub under the direction of Food Service hasnow opened the Dutchmen's dinner for Satlll'day night. This is an added bonus to enhance the opportunities available to students on the meal plan. The Dutclunan's Night is open every Saturday night with three dinner sittings and serves a variety of well- prepared foods. . ~e Dutchman's ~:ight was m1t1ated to give students another option in eating other than West Dining_ Hall. The Dutchman's Njght program was adopted from the James Madison College in Virginia's special program called the \Steak House.\ No other school in this area has an added program similar to Union's. The Dutchman's Night is a branch from the previous year's programs of a \speCial\ and \theme\ dinner. These dinners were held approximately twice a month in the dining hals. They served ethnic foods and other differentmealsto add variety to institutionalized dining. The Dutclunan's Night dinner ex- panded this idea of variety and also took the . burden of the special dinners off the hands of the dining halls. Monday and. Wednesday. The night had to be changed because some students and teachers compla-ined to tbe management. They said that originally on Monday and Wednesday afternoons they used to go to the Pub and get a cup of coffee and relax or study. Now that the Dutchman's dinner has been initiated, this period was taken. away from them. The management felt that they should accomodate this group of people and swit- ched the night. The Pub is now available to these students as they originally enjoyed. The management .would also like to see the faculty join the students for Dutchman's Night. Th~y would like to have the students and fac~ty interact during dinner to get better acquainted and also talk about things that both would not have had the time to previously talk about. Pseudo-1 ntellectua Is? The Dutchman's dinner serves a good quality of restaurant food and prepares it v.ery carefully. It is designed to give the student a relaxed at- mosphere for nice dining. The tables are set with the school colors, white and garnet, and waiters and waitresses serve the three courses. The ml:mu provides a well-rounded choice of prime rib, steak, boneless chiecken and veal parmesan. The entrees are accompanied by appetizer, salad, dessert, and beverage. The choice of menu was decided by past polls taken by the students. The service is supplied by some of Union's students and some outside workers. The directors of the program want to make the service \as professional a~ possible and they realize that the service neilds a lot of im- provement to make it professional. . Food Service would like . to perpetuate the warm feeling that Union posesses and radiates. The general response of the students who attended the Dutchman's Night is positive. Practically all of the students enjoyed the food. The only complaint that the students did give was concerning the. ser- vice. Janet Gray feels strongly and is very optimistic about the program. She says \.We would like to 'fine tune' the Dut- chman's Night .by working on the service to cre.ate a real success.\ Students are able to make reservations for Dut- chman's Night on Wednesday and F~riC::Iay afternoons between 1 and 5. The students must give their I.D. numbers and their meal card nwnbers to ensure that they ate on .the meal plan. Possible £utuue improvements that the management is con- sidering is using passes or special tickets so that .guests can t~e advantage of this good program. By B. PR()PPER Staff I was recently chauffeured by a female cab driver with a Ph.D. in English Literature. A disturbing experience, to say the least. So l sought comfort with my own sort at the first English Majors Society meeting of the 1982-1983 year. E.M.S. began to stir last spring with plans for an English Majors Cabaret, appropriately called the Ps.eudo-lntellectual Cabaret. The society has another name, English Throats Society (E. T.S.)-- certainly a contradiction in terms. E.M.S. plans to par- ticipate actively in such campus organizations as Concordiensls, Garnet; and Idol. Meanwhile, with . the popularity of wine, cheese, and talk taken into account, E.M.S. held its first fUilction yesterday, which was a wine and cheese party. . Future events planned ar~ a reading by Professor Jordan Smith, and a performance of the Pseudo-Intellectual Cabaret. Smith will be reading his recently published book of poetry, An Apology For Loving The Old Hymns. A reception (with wine, cheese, and talk) will follow. The Cabaret is ~ill being written. Basically im- provisational and open-ended if not open-minded, the project needs more writers and per- formers. All majors are welcome; elitism is for real life, not Union.

Tragedy: By PHILIP LANZA \There Is nothing-absolutely nothing-half so much worth dolng as simply messing about in boats.\ KennetbGrahme Anyone who lives near the Mystic River and its townships will tell you that. In fact, if you ever venture to those water- ways of Southern Connecttcut, you may see a lanky, blond& haried young man who will quote those very words of Mr. Grahame's, while balancing himself on the gunnel of his sailboat, simply to demonstrate the sea-worthiness of his homemade craft.

Williams College, in cooperation with the Seaport, began the Williams College - Mystic Seaport Program in American Maritime Studies in 1977, The program invites students to st~dy at theSeaport for one semester (folloWing the Williams College calendar), taking advantage of both the unique environment as well as the almost limitless resources of coastal New England.

Ken Altman, Scott Bloom, Carol King and Lora Nelson in rehearsal Beninati Playto Premiere at Union ]Jy JODI COHEN Staff The flurry of activity con- t'mu.es at the Nott Memorial Theatre as MoWltebanks nears its deadline for the Original production of Rebel. The man behind it all is director - playwright Daro Beninati, technical director of Union theatre. Beninati is no newcomer to the - world .of theatre. After graduating from SUNY New Paltz with a BA in Theatre Arts, he turned down an acceptance to the Yale School of Drama in order to gain more \hands on'' ex- perience in his field in California. There he worked for 14 years as a professional , journeyman :scenic artist for film, television, and the San Francisco Opera Company. His career in film included collaborations wjth film mogul Francis Ford Coppola on \'The Conv.ersation' ', ''Private Lives,\ and the world premier of the opera \The Visit.\ Also to his credit is his article published in \Theatre Crafts\ entitled \Technicians are Killing People\ in which he proposes safe alternatives to hazardous technical stage ef- fects. . A death in the family brought Beninati back to the Northeast where he held 'positions at Russell Sage and :Adirondack' Community College before taking over as tech master at Union. Rebel is not Beninati's first attempt at playwrighting. He -..;..WE DELIVER,r 37.4ml888 bas written sev~ralstage plays and numerous screen plays. One of them, \The Last Shooting Gallery,\ the story of a heroin addict, premiered at Cafe Lena in .Saratoga in '1971 and subsequentlY.: went on tour throughout the Capital District. It t()ok Beninati two years to, write Rebel and he claims that he is still writing it. For this reason he calls the play a work- in-progress. \I am constantly revising the play in order to come up with a script that works,'' he says. \I have added new speeches and cut others that made the original script somewhat muddy in places~'' Inspiration to write Rebel came four years ago when Beninati was asked to write a one-woman show for Lela Blake, a visiting member of the Arts department. ~lake hoped to take the show on tour, thirtking that Emma would be a suitable vehicle. However, as Beninati points out, the original script, written as a one-woman show, proved unfeasable. In·its present rewritten form Rebel calls for a cast of 22. Why the fascination with Emma Goldman? \She was a pretty wild lady,, laughs Beninati, ''To think that one woman, during a period of hist()ry when women had ab- solutely no rights, had the ability- to stand up and make people aware of their op- pression and had the courage to do something about it.'' Goldman- was one of the first women to· advocate women's rights. She supported birth 464 State St. Schenectady, NY control when discussion of . anything sexual was illegal. As a nurse, Emma met women of the lowest classes, who gave birth year after year until they died in childbirth. They had no . right to their own bodies. She also fought to improve the plight of the working class. She got involved in C\narchy, adm vocating violence and killing (although the most violent act ·she committed was beating one of her lovers with a bull whip) and encouraged people to go to any length to !iecure their basic rights. Goldman declared that .she would never be forced, by anyone, to do anything. She urged her followers do likewise. In the play, Emma is por- trayed by three different women. \I see her life as divided into three distinct phases,\ states the author, \the young, immature, idealistic Emma who is first formulating her ideas and ideals in Act I: the very active middle-aged Emma · who entices people to riot, touring the world spreading the Anarchist movement; . and Old Emma, ''the senior citizen of the world.\ The last is seen primarily in Act II ·where the mood of the.play becomes much more pensive as she reflects about her life. Sinc.e the author's , background has strong roots in filmmaking, it is no wonder that a movie-like quality pervades the play. His intention is to present a film performed live on a stage. As in a film, Beninati attempts to edit the script to very precise moments which build upon one another to create an overall effect. \The demand on the actors in this kind of play is incredible. The scenes which are performed live each night must have the same precision as a well edited movie.\ The advantage of this technique is to allow the freedom to easily change locations without the con,finement of a stage and a set. Lights are brought up a_nd down in different places on stage to create this effect. In addition, rear projections and · sound are used extensively, not as scenery, but to create mood and texture. Originally, Rebel was entitled \Emma Portrait of a Rebel.\ Beninazi says, j'When I wrote the play, it was about Emma. Now that I'm directing it I see that it's not just about her. Everyone in the play is a rebel.\ Hence, the change in title. He sees Rebel's theme as contemporary. He states, \The world that Emma tried to change is the world that needs changing today.\ In Act II Old Emma says, \The world will change; it's changing every day. But people don't. And I doubt they ever will. We are idealists fighting in a vacuwn of greed.\ In his opinion, it is this .~reed that makes the play h:nportant today. The world is still full of unrest, greed, and people of ambition who want to subjugate other people. There is still violence, bloodshed, and the death of innocent people, all for the sake of ideals. He points out that practically every day there are stories about hostages and massacres. These represent what Emma fought against. Beninati cites the Jonestown massacre as a perfect · example of one man controlling the minds and lives of over 900 people. \Emma would be outraged.\ Rebel will open November 11 and run through the 14th and also the 18th through the 21st.

Page 10 OONOOR1JllfN8lS# October 18# 19BI Ziggy on TV Internationally syndicated cartoon character, Ziggy, will debut this Christmas season in his very own half-hour, fully anima:ted television special, Ziggy's Gift. The program will air on December 1st, 8:00p.m., on the ABC- TV network. Created and written by Ziggy cartoonist Tom Wilson, Zfggy's Gift was propduced by Lena Tabori of Welcome Enterprise, Inc. Ricqatd Williams, the Oscar - winning animator, directed and co-,produced the film, and Eric Goldberg came in from London to function as director of animation. Granuny award - winning recording artist Harry Nilsson composed the music and lyrics, which were scored and conducted by Perry Botkin. According to executive producer Tabori, \It was Ziggy's enormous popularity, combined with the strong talent behind the film, that made the entire package so appealing to ABC.\ A recent ABC popularity poll showed Ziggy as Number Five in a survey of the top one hUildred cartoon characters. Tabori points out that ''Ziggy is the only character ranking so high who has yet to appear on TV.\ The Creators Tom Wilson began drawing Ziggy nearly twelve years ago as a form of weekend recreation. Today the character delights 25 million readers nationwide in daily newspaper panels and Sunday strips, and has grown into a multi - million dollar syndicate and licensing property. Ziggy's ·Gift is a classic Christmas tale in which Ziggy shows ,us the magic of giving. Before the tale ends, Ziggy has captivated a cop and even taught a pickO:pocket the meaning of Christmas. As the refrain of Harry Nilsson's theme song, \Ziggy's Gift,\ reminds us: \Love is the only word that counts.

')\' (CPS)-College students should expect the ~e or less. funding from the ·federal . government over the next few years, the Reagan administration'l$ top higher education official told a convention of loan officers here last week. _ Edward Elmendorf, acting assistant secretary for post.; secondary education, told a meeting of the National Association of State Scholarship and Grant Programs and· the National .Council of Higher Education Loan Programs that the U.S~ Dept. .of Education's next budget. proposal wUl probably ~ much like its last one. That proposal, o.ffered ln February but · .ultimately rejected by Congress, called for a 50 percent cut in federal student ald programs. Elmendorf would not reveal specifics of the next Reagan education budget-it is, he says, still being hammered out-but predicted the administration would try to reduce the number of aid programs from seven to three: Guaranteed Student Loans, College Work-study, and Pell Grapts. That · would mean con- solidating Auxilary Loans, State Student Incentive Grants (SSIGs), -Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants (SEOGs), and National Direct Student l..eans (NDSLs) into the other ptQgr8IIlS. · In the last budget request, the adininistration triec;J to abolish .. SSIGs, SEOGs, NSDLs,. and Student Social Se.curity. It succeeded :only .in eliminating Stude~ Social Security. , \I don't think we need seven student aidpr:ograms to do the job of helping needy students through college,\ Elmendorf told .a panel on government support of W,gher education. \Our concern is to eliminate waste and incr~ase efficiency in the programs, not to deny .education to deserving students,\ he explained, \But we'd also ask that deserving students mw their fair share .... Elmendorf said the ad- ministration's program to get students t() pay a. bigger share of their education costs before qualifying for aid is working. Private college students, he said, are naw paying a greater percentagE of their college costs themselves. But Charles Saunders of the American Council on Education pointed out that those students come from wealthier families., that they are borrowing twice as much money as they did last year, and that a recent study showed lower.income students had been forced to transfer to cheaper public colleges because of the aid cuts. · FREE· CONCERT, Larry Pape & Chris D f/J upre Friday, Octob~r 29 • 8:30 pm \ Union -College Old Chapel Sponsored by the Un i.oh College Christian Fellowship SCIENTI·FIC & ENGINEERING CAREER OPPORTUNITIES (CPS)-Nearly half of an· graduate students in America would .have lost money if Pl'esident Eeagan had .gotten his 1983 budget pt·oposal through Congress, a new Educational Testing Service (ETS) study concludes. . Reagan .proposed last Feb~ry to cut the Guaranteed Student Loan. .(GSL) program from $2.8 to $2~5 billion, in part ' by disqualifying all grad students from the program~ Congress defeated that proposal, later boosting GSL ... funding to $3 billion. The ETS study, undertaken to weigh the impact of cutting off grad students. from GSLs, found that grad students rely on GSLs more than any other kind. of aid. Some 600,000 graduate and professional students-out of a total 1.2 milliona•.borrowed money under the GSL program last year, the report found. Those 600,000 took average loans of $3;800. Cutting them off .from those funds would have a profound impact, Says Dwight Horch, ETS director of college ·and university progra,ms and co- author of the just-released study . The president's proposal, he says, was \untried and un- tested,\ and coUld have forced large numbers of grad students out of school. Otherwise, \the study clearly shows that there is a need for different types of financial aid at the graduate level, such as more fellowships and op- portunity grants,\ he says. Many .grad students \have no recourse except to borrow to finance their educations. n To · make GSLs easier to repay, Horch suggests the government \tie the level of repayment to the student's future income.\ \\ NATIONAL ·COLLEGE NEW·s IN BRIEF Ugly Success Ugly men have better jobs and better educated wives than good-looking men, a new survey says. The survey found that looks have no effect on income, but in other areas, attractiveness in men hinders gains in status. The survey was done by University of North Carolina researChers. The least-attractive men have the most education and their occup~tional status is higher on the ]'ob clasSification scale the researchers found. The survey showed that uglier men per- formed better at school and had sexual relations at a later age than their better-looking counterparts, However, tlte survey said that \outstandingly\ good looking men attain jobs of equal prestige as those of the least attractive. The survey also found that a woman's attractiveness was not related to education, oc- cupation, or personal income. Nevertheless, there was con- siderable evidence that feminine attractiveness affects the adult status through marriage to a high-income husband . The survey said that the more attractive the woman, the better educated her husband. The opposite was true for men. There was no correlation between a woman's looks and her school performance or adolescent sexual activity, according to the survey. ELECTRONIC TECHNOLOGY? THE WORK WE DO TODAY IS THE S'r ATE-OF-rHE-ART TOMORROW'!' ·- .. I The study used data from a survey in 1970 of 601 men and 745 women. That survey followed up a study of men and women who were first questioned in 1955, during their sophomore year in high school. Research assistants then rated the respondent's looks, using high school pictures. The survey was made public on Sept. 7 at the 77th annual meeting of the American Sociological Association. . College Poll A recent poll shows that Americans no longer regard a college education as the road to riches. Although those people polled feel that ,qualified students should have the op- portunity to attend college, they did not feel that it guaranteed employment after graduation. The poll was conducted by Group Attitudes Corporation of New York. Nearly 1200 people responded to the 4200 surveys sent out. Fifty-five percent of the respondents were worried that they would be financially unable to send their own children to college. However, over half agreed with Ronald Reagan's cuts in federal aid. Guns, Not Books (CPS)-A vast majority of Americans support federal student aid programs, and would rather see Congress cut defense programs than education, a survey by 11. education groups has found .

Eighty-one percent of the 1188 people questioned approved of federal grants for medical research. Less than half the respondents support humanities, social science and arts research. however. About a third of the people questioned said defense programs should not be cut at aU, compared to the 42.2 per- cent who wanted to keep education funding whole. Fifteen percent wanted education cut drastically, while 22.3 percent wanted defense programs cut drastically._ Lebanon Lunch The French troops in Lebanon won't be the only ones feasting on gourmet meals if a Dayton, Ohio man has his way. Steve Allen is organiZing an airlift of White Castle ham- burgers to U.S. Marines stationed in Lebanon. There aren't many White Castles in the Middle East, so Allen wants them airlifted to supplement the soldiers C-rations . Allen, who is operations manager for a Dayton radio station, said he got the idea when he heard how well the French troops were eating while they were on duty as part of the peace-keeping force in Beirut. Allen has contacted the headquarters of the White Castle chain to ask that the burgers be donated. He has also spoken to an Air Freight company in Dayton to arrange transportation. White Castle has agreed to donate the hamburgers for the Marines. They will prepare 3,000 hamburgers and pack them in dry ice for the overseas shipment.

'F.tley deserve more. Formal expressions of prlUse directed to the staff and their accomplishments are few and far between. The community prefers· to sit on its haunches and criticize. This is not to say that criticism is unwanted or unwarranted .. Mistakes are made and there is certainly room for improvement. This ls part of our education, isn•t it? But when the staff turns to layout the Letters pages, except in the rare case, aU that is found in the folder is criticism after criticism. We are tired of talkers and need doers. If you feel so negative about our publication, get off your derrieres and work towards a better product. Great strides have been made already by the 1983 staff of Ooncordiensis and, of course, certain issues are a matter of taste. We welcome and even dare people to compare oUr publication to other \deserving\- college· newspapers. We have the subscriptions to back our challenge with substance and not words. Arid if no one is willing to stand above the crowd and offer a deserved pat on the back, we will. Ooncordiensis is one of the few quality college newspapers and we owe this to a dedicated staff. Money Talks The Student Forum has stalled enough. We are tired of hearing about an imaginary basketball court. More pressing issues must be dealt with. On the top of that list is the Independent ·student . Coalition. The ISC, as it is affectionately called, is a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization which represents the higher education public policy interests of more than 300,000 students who attend private instltutions in the State. In other words, the ISC is the only student lobbying organization defending our needs in Albany. It is imperative that the College, or rather the student body, support the ISC both in spirit and in cash. It would cost a ridiculously small sum of money, approximately fifty cent$ per student, to become an active mem}?er. When it comes right down to it, we have no choice. Aligned against the interests of private college students are the interests of State University students. - Both are competing for the attention of the Board of Regents, the Governor and the State Legislature. Behind the State students is a multi-hundred thousand dollar organJz.ation funded by, of. course, the State. In our arsenal is the ISC, with an operating budget of forty-one thousand dollars. Money talks in politics. But more important, Union students can talk in state politics. Do Your Part Though we sound like a broken record, November 2nd is Election Day. We cannot impress upon the community enough the need to vote·. The outcomes will hit at home for many. It is said by some cynics that the only thing which motivates man is money. If you do not act on Tuesday, your funds to attend this illustrious institution could be stolen from right beneath your very eyes. We have harped enough on this issue. There is no choice of local candidates. On the national level, election results can act as a referendum against what we see as mismanagement on the part of Washington. But. only if you vote. Are you satisfied with the Administration's policy on edu~ation? For that matter, economic, conservation and foreign policies, just to nam.e a few? We have done our part in informing you of dates, names and issues. Now it is your turn. LETTERS.

As members of the '()'nion college community, we feel the recent material tbat has been printed in the CQD~ordleub is . . both sexist and offen~ive. As students, we all- })ave a responsibility to our society as future educators, leaders, and example setters. .After llll, we are the future. In the midst of sucb vital issues as the economy, nuclear weapons,. birth control, and abortion, we should recognize this respon- sibility and take it seriously, We often tend to ll$e humor, · not merely as entertainment, but also as a tool or a weapon. In light of the recent humoristic_ . journalism which has been appearing in the ConcordieDSis, it is unclear as to whether the authors and editors understand the negative effects which can go along With humor. Alt)lough they may not intend to use humar as a weapon against women, such jou,rl).alistic ~terial as \Vals at Union,\ and \Rumor: Women's Week\ does, in factt hurt and offend women at Union, · Our society has supposedly come . a long way towaros realizing the equf!lity and contributions of women, blacks, Jews, and other minorities. However, at Union, women seem to have been overlooked. We hardly think . that Con- cordiensls would print degrading humor about blacks~ or Jews, so why about women? Is it any different? Laurence 'l'bomas, a black philosopher, points out in his essay \Sexism and Racism,\. that today sexist insults are tolerated and even condoned to · a much greater degree than racist .insults. He maintains, however, that \both ar--e sufficiently objectionable, on moral grounds, so that everyone should be equally concerned to perpetuate neither.\ - Humor is a wonderful and versatile tool, and when . used intelligently, it can be poignant, entertaining and enlightening. But the humor that has been appearing in Coneordlensls is none of. these.

It is commonplace to hear at • Union students defensively comparing themselves to the calibre of students that one finds at schools such as Tufts, Swarthmore, and Williams .. - Hopefully, the st{lff of Con· cordiensls has not deluded themselves into believing that their publication is deserving of such a comparison. Con- cordiensis is a public .representation of Qur school and we feel it necessary for some -of its contributors to reflect• upon .this matter. As it stands, · Concordfensls is an em- · barrassment.

OONCO!RDIEN818~ ()ctobe.r 88, 1982 Film Revlew-- Mazu·rsky'S uTempest\ r A well-known author once said of Shakespeare's renowned Tempest, \Of all the works ever written by the. man, (it) cer ... tainly ranks first as his most ma.gical, whimsical, imaginative pi·ece; it's a classic~ The element of magic surpasses anything to date.'\ Paul (''Unmarried Woman\} Mazur:sky's latest rele~;tse, ''Tempest'\ is based on Shakespeare's piece, thus making it nearly impossible not to compare the two; However, the comparison in. this case proves almost~ fatal to one's enjoyment of what could be, but isn't qUite, a .highly successful and entertaining film. . John Cassavettes stars as Demetrius, a .prominent New York architect, who discovers one daythat the hectic pace he's been keeping to fulfill his dream .of wealth and .happiness . is slowly killing him. He l1elieves his mid~life crisis has finally arrived-one morn-ing, he notices a grey hair on his chest and plucks it, only to have it grow back a few days later. His blood pressure is up, and smoking has suddenly become an hourly event. Not only is he physically beat, but emotionally also. In one scene, he tells his wife (Gena Rowlands) that he feels as though something is missing from his life; something big. It finally comes to the point where he begins to hate New York, the white walls of his apartment, the family cat, its whiskers, and eventually his wife. But the .real breaking point comes when he and his boss, Alonso (Victoria Gassman), are visiting a -construction site of an unfiniShed casino the two have been working on: A:s Demetrius looks high above onto a beam ledge', he ' 1 watches\ as he slowly jumps to his death. The scene is a deeply symbolic one, not to mention a classic: an unfinished man among an unfinished structure, ''wat~ ching\ himself slowly die among the impersonal steel chaos. As he sees, himself fall, he .says quietly- and unemotionally to Alonso,~ ''I quit.\ This little event foreshadows the· events of what's yet to come. - Pisgusted with her husband's · ''selfish, abusive\ behavlor, Demetrius; wife takes up with Alonso. Demetrius -takes daughter Miranda with him to Greece (supposedly just for the sum.xner, or so he tells his wife) to discover his true roots, and the two end up hiding out on .a deserted Greek island. On their way out there, they meet and pick up a halfmwitted yet stunning young singer '.'Susan Sarandon), and together the tbree make tracks for the isle. Upon .arrival, they encounter the adorable and slightly primitive \island-keeper\ himself_, named, of course, Calibanos (Raul J-Ulia), who plays the clarinet for his .goats. In one charming, toe-tapping sequence, Calibanos pied•pipers his goats to the tune \New York, New York\ all perfectly edited with 'goats leaping through the air, turning, raising their heads, running, all in a mad tapestry of goatly delights. It's certainly one of the film's more visually exciting num- bers, and one only wishes that more of the same could be found throughout. It is quite brilliantly mad. After over a year on the island, the two· girls discover that .paradise ain't all what it's crackedupto be. Miranda longs for some contact with Pemetrius, to no avail; he's been. practicing celibacy since he left his wife~ Miranda, at the ripe age of 15, longs for .pink and green punk stripes in her hair,. television, at)d a .nice, cold dacquiri. As she explains to her father, the drink actually makes her sick, but. it's just having the freedom to have one that she really misses~ After a near•fatal rescue atte~pt, thanks to a· tempest that Demetrius appears to have raised himself, Alonso, Demetrius' wife, and a few other unneeded characters. are reunited on the islandl:o work out whatever needs working out. What starts out as a poten- tially exciting film l'nstead leaves you feeling not only unfulfilled, but . also slightly robbed. The last 30 to 45 minutes is taken at such, a hectic, im- personal pace, that - one feels allllost our of breath when the closing credits finally appear. Walk .. on characters suddenly evolve into major ones, only to walk off into the sunset (as it be) with conflicts still unsettled. Newfound ''major\ · conflicts are suddenly brought to light and just as suddenly resolved, leaving a \what the . . . ? \ feeling prevailing. Cassavetes and Rowlands, however, did supply an abun- dance of strongly emotional sequences throughout, with Julia adding a bit of comical overtonin~ here and there. State Funding Cutbacks (CPS)-Budget cuts have The State University at gone so deep that Michigan Brockport laid off 52 teachers, State University dorm residents eliminated its geography, now must pay extra for a sound German and music majors, and night's sleep. cut a number of course of,. The university has. stopped ferings. supplying dorm residents with feather pillows this fall as part of an ongoing effort. to save - money, explains Donald Sch- midt, assistant donn manager. Students now have to bring their own pillows to school. · MSU and aU· Michigan state . schools already have had to cope with four budget cuts this year as the state tries to make up for revenue shortfalls in the depressed region. . LQsing pillows isn't the first indignity MSU. students have suffered. ln. J.uly, the · school announced it would replace its traditional ''leatherette'' diploma covers with 35 cent cardboard covers. But MSU studenbraren't ·the only ones, either, Colleges in mo.re than 20 states are being forced to cut budgets - and in some cases student services - in mid-fiscal year. K~nsas State, for example, now delivers grades to students by hand instead of by mail; thus saving some $4,()00 a term in postage costs. At Americ~;~n University in Was~gton, D.C., dorms liave removed paper towels from loun·ges, l~id off security guards, and shut down air conditioning during the day. Northern · Il:linois s.tudents recently camped outside to - pro~eat the shutting down of the~r dorm air conditioning. Maryland recen~ly became the ·~rgest sc!Jool to drop free telephones frorn the list of dorm amenities. . · Th~ most . serious effects of the spate cutbacks have been on aca~emic jobs lltld · programs. 0 0 -ni ur ~g the. summer, Temple The University of Idaho similarly reduced the number of . classes it offers, ended its museum studies program, and stopped its tutoring service to students. Over just the last two weeks, Alabama, Georgia and Colorado colleges learned. they would have to slash their budgets for the year. The problems arise when local economies sour, people make less~tnoney, and thus pay the states less in. taxes than the states. had planned to spend. Even though a majority of state legislatures actually budgeted more for higher education than they did last year, a majority of those have since had to renege on their promises of more money. When that happens, all state-funded institutions - in- cluding colleges - typically h~ve to impose emergency cutbacks. It took two years of such 'cuts to affect student services at Michigan State. Now \we annually go through aU the services we offer to students to see which are most utilized and cost-effective,\ Schmidt says. \Pillows have been a high-replacement item for us.\ MSU spent $22,000 last year to repair or replace worn feather pillows, .

Organizers put the an~ nounc.ement down as a ''smokescreen'', pointing out the company made a similar announcement last spring. Last week Nestle unveiled recommendations drawn up by \an independent audit com- mittee\ headed by former U.S. Senator and presidential candidate Edmund Muskie. Company officials announced -. they'd comply with the recoiiUilendations, including issuing more explicit in- structions for the proper use of. its infant foo.d formula marketed in Third World countries. In addition to its well-known chocolate products, Nestle owns Libby's Foods, Stouffer's Inns, Beechnut Gum, L'Oreal Cosmetics, and is the world's largest supplier of infant food formula. The boycott centers ~round the company's infant formula marketing practices in lesser- developed countries around the world. I r res pons i b 1 e distribution and sales of the product, boycott organizers say, result in needless nutrition and health hazards to infants in those countries. College campuses have often been the source of boycott actions. At Notre Dame, UCLA, the University of Maryland, B-erkeley, Oberlin, and a number of Minnesota colleges, students have voted not only to support the boycott in general, but to restrict the sales of Nestle products on campus. INF AC, a coalition of campus and community organizations fighting for more controls of infant formula distribution, was the primary force in organizing the boycott in 1977. Among other things, INFAC has charged that by distributing free samples, Nestle en- courages Third World mothers to use infant formula in lieu of breast feeding. Consequently, mothers often find their own milk dries up, and they are forced to buy additional for- mula. Boycott supporters also claim mothers are not properly in- formed about using the for- mula. Often, they say, mothers dilute the mixture too much, slowly starving their babies to death. Even worse, the formula is sometimes mixed with contaminated water and causes infection and disease in the infants. The WHO guidelines are aimed at making sure mothers are adequately instructed on the proper use of infant for~ mula. Among other things, the guidelines suggest that formula packaging contain explicit warnings about the -hazards of using infant formula. Nestle. is trying to \create the impression of an independent monitoring group\ through the Muskie commission, says Sholbowale. Sholbowale says there's \no way a buncb of do-gooders and · doctors sitting in the U.S. can tell what's happening (with formula marketing) in India.\ Tylenol Troubles.

I • Page 16 OONOORDIENSIS~ October B8, 1981 Dealing With Midterms Being a responsible student is stressful enough, but with the approach of midterm or final exams, there tends to be an accompanying increase in stress anxiety. Uncontrolled stress can easily cause one to blow his cool during a testing situation and can even lead to cemplications which could t.hreaten the whole college career. Now is the time when an in- erease of \if only\ thoughts are likely to occur. Everyone is familiar with ''i:f only'' thoughts: ones Hke, \If only I had decided to become a race car driver; \ \If only my allowance didn't depend upon my attending classes;\ and \If only r could drop out of school so I don't have to miss Saturday's football game.\ Fortunately, it is quite nor- mal to have such thoughts, to have the hesitation and anxiety that accompany high-stress situations. And, unpleasant as they may be at the time, stress and anxiety cal'l be productive states if used to the proper advantage. The key to managing stress and anxiety is recognition that it exists. Excess stress can rob a person of his cognitive and creative thought processes when he is most in need of them. To do anything about it, however, one must first become aware of the stress. Stress can manifest itself in many forms: mental, physical and emotional. Here's what to look for: MENTAL: Forgetfulness, loss of concentration, poor judgement, disorganization, lack of interest-motivation, living in the past or future, obsessions and compulsiveness. Warning; Caffeine and sugar are known to affect con- centration and recall of in- formation. Now is the time to take up jogging for that needed pick-me-up. EMOTIONAL: Irritability, nervousness, moodiness, emotional outbursts, over- demands of self and others, depression, hostility. In other .words, an excessive emotional display ·Of any sort. PHYSICAL: Muscular ten- sion, high blood pressure, cold extremities, hea-daches, digestive problems, con- stipation, insomnia. You may be a chronic stress carrier and therefore not familiar with a more relaxed state. A series of' isometric exerciSes will help you locate areas of muscle tension. Now that you know what to look for, here's what you can do to lessen stress in the testing situation. In general, take care of yourself. There are many forms of nourishment. Get plenty of rest, exercise, eat nourishing food, get a massage. Plan ahead. The easiest way to be the most comfortable in, or maybe even to enjoy, the te.sting situation is to know the material, right? Most people enjoy .performing when they feel proficient to the task. Break doWil tasks and make a schedule of daily activities. Be specific. Tackle your most difficult subject~ .first. Study in groups froni two to six people. Construct sample questions for rehearsal. Ask the prpfessor what form of test to expect. Reduce the element of surprise within the bounds of ethics. Plan for intermittent periods of relaxation-reward and study. A guide to go by is: -Two hours of study for one hour of television -Read three chapters for a 10 . minute walk . -Go over class notes then call a friend to discuss them Remind yourself that you are being rewarded for good work when you take your break. Set reasonable goals. If you tell yourself the only way you wUI be successful on this exam is to ace it, and you have missed a week of notes and have 15 chapters to read, you aren't exactly being realistic. Don't give up, but don't lie to yourself, either. Do the best you can within the time allowed, .and remember the · rest when it comes time for finals. If · the · · situation feels un- manageable, don't struggle through it alone. Seek out the comfort of friends, talk to your , adviser. It mak;es good sense to. help yourself out with the most appropriate and efficient tools available. St. Louis Celebrates Campus Digest News Service Fireworks rocked the Riverfront in St. Louis for a solid 40 minutes at the close of the seventh World Series game while thousands of delirious fans danced in the streets. It was a celebration toasting the victory of the 79th World Series which gave the RedbirdS their ninth World Series Championship in 13 tries. The Series between · Milwaukee and St. Louis ·was , biDed \World Beeries,\ two beer teams racked· by unem- ployment and prob!ems .~e blue collar unrest, .gomg at It m the premier !'Fall Classic.\ And although it wasnt't the prettiest series you'll ever see, there were records tied; records broken, lopsided victories and plenty of rain. The Brewers present-day answer to the legendary Murder's Row of the early Yankees came into the Series with 216 homeruns - an awesome total by any stan- dards, the Carqinals, on the other hand, were last in the Majors with 66 homers. A series that was depicted as one of contrast in styles, speed. versus power, imagination versus crunch, simply did not develop as was predicted. The Redbirds scored more runs had more extra-base hits and ' clutch hitting when it counted. Dane Iorg tied a record for base hits as a designated ~tter. Iorg batted over .500, and the Cardinals outslugged Milwaukee by almost .300 percentage points. Milwaukee's Robin Yount set a record to two games with at least four hits in a single series. And the :arewers played well on defense, something in which the Cardinals had been given credit and the edge prior to the series. St. Louis ace Joachin Andujar won his second game of the series turning in an excellent performance after being knocked out of Friday's game by a line drive of the bat off Milwaukee catcher Ted. Simmons. Andujar· went seven innings and gave three runs, Bruce Sutter, reliever exceptionale, retired the finals six in a row and struck out Gol'lllan Thomas to make St. Louis the 1982 World Champions. The battle of the beer cities is over, but the celebrating in St. Louis will continue through the winter. I Parody Catalog] course titled 'Women in Antiquity', ~nd all wedid.was come up. wtth a course titled 'Women and Antiquity--an examination of the causes and dynamics of the affinity bet- ween women and antiques.' '' MI'LWAUKEE, WI (CPS)-In addition to their U$Ual armful of textbooks, course catalogs, and new class schedules, .students at Mount Mary College are also toting aroWld a curious little red book these days. The admissions office at ·the· private, all-women, Roman Catholic college also keeps several copies of the small paperback on.hand, as does the campus minister. But the book,. Welcome to Mount Merry College, is hardly official. Outlining courses ranging from Gastronomical Geometry to Playboy Philosophy and describing a f~culty made up of burnt-out · academicians and sexual deviants, it isn •t .exactly something the Mt. Mary's staff ordinarily uses to :guide the ·students. · In fact, the book comes from far-away New York and its authors, trying to produce a parody of college catalogs, had never heard of the real Mount Mary College. The authors-'\-two of the original people who started to write The Offl~fal Preppy Hand~ook but wbo sold their interests in the project to' Lisa Birnbach early on-concocted their Mount Merry Coll~ge as a private, eastern schooL But the fictional campus, all concerned note, is not unlike the real, small WisGonsin private school whose name i~ moc~ed in the title. \We just decided to set out and do a spoof of tbe traditional college catalog,\ explains co- author Mason Wiley. \We read through every college catalog we could get our hands on, looked at course titles and descriptions, and tben just went crazy creating something .of our own.\ Co~author Carol Wallace remembers ''really getting into the swing of it\ when she read through . the catalog for Brigham Young University and spotted sorpe courses on ~'the selection of large and small appliances choosing the right cookware.\ Sometimes, Wiley explains, writing a satirical course title was as easy as changing a word in the original version. One school, for instance, \offered a Puzzle Answer \After w.e got some ideas for courses,\ WHey says, \we decided to create a mod~l college to bUild the catalog around. It seemed a private, Catholic school that took itself too seriously would be perfect.'' The authors picked the all- too-real name for their book ''becauSe we wanted something that had sexual connotatton, sornethitig a little religious, and something humorous,'' Wiley says. \So we named it Mount Mary College. It's a school that prides itself on that old, puritanical,. strict image, but has absolutely no justification for doing so.\ Peppered with black and white· snapshots of students making out, nuns playing guitars, and physical education teacher Mary Dyche non- chalantly massaging a .female student's breast while pinning a medal on her, the book lam- poons just about everything that private, religim,Js colleges have always held sacred. \In a way,\ Wiley a~ts, \the book became not so much a parody, but also a small little novel about this mythical · college somewhere. We try to suggest a relationship between the instructors and their classes. It seemed appropriate to have a lesbian teacbfug physical education,. or to have the campus chaplain having an affair with the president.'' Wiley says college officials are typ.ically \a · little in- timidated\ when they first look through Welcome to Mount Merry, but most \end up chuckling after they really get into it.\ ·\We've looked at it and discussed it,'' says Tom Frazier, Mt. Mary's director of college relations~ \Obviously it's spoofing the kind of in- stitution we are. And un- fortunateiy, they used Mount Merry as· the title. But it's not viewed as.anything awful.\ \Actually Frazier con- tinues; \it might enhance our publicity a little if we could use it somehow as a marketing tool. It's 'cleverly done, and un- fortunately a lot of the book is pretty representative of the way private colleges used to market themselves/' But out of a· half-dozen schools with siinilar names, Mt. Mary College seems. to be about the only ohe where the book has made .. its way onto campm.

Near tlle end of the game the momentum had turned in Union's favor and if time had not run out the game woUJ.d have been tied and won by the Garnet players .. In fact, in the \ last minute of play the Union offense plliilqlelled the oppo:Jing goalie with a barrage of well- executed shots. Senior Ber• nadette Albanese had the lone tally with 26: 58 left in the game as she slammed a well positioned shot by the goalie. The women's field hockey . team finished their season last week compiling a 7-6 record and narrowly missing out on a chance to attend post season competition. Coach Marty Morrison stated that she was extremely pleased with the season, especially in the tur· naround of both skill and at- titude that has occurred since lasf year: Throughout the season the Union hockey team had the character and com- posure that k:ept them hustling until the end. This was apparent in their ability to come from behind and score the needed goals both against teams on the road and on the turf; The varsity team will be losing six seniors to graduation in June. Goaltender Cathy Bentley Playing in her first varsity season was consistent in . every game and truly did an excellent job,by only allowing 17 goals in 13 games. Not only did Cathy's total concentration and aggres$ive nature shine during the games, but she also did a spectacular job in the two flick- off situations. Coach Morrison feels that with more playing time Cathy has the potential to be a Division I goalie and that her strength in· fundamentals was especially impressive considering. that she had never played field hockey until last year. Senior co-Captain Sue Ensel .plays just in front of Cathy and C$11 take credit for often stymying h~ opprinents. Sue has played four years in her position as sweeper and she has consistently shown an ability to Dianne Moskaluk strides towa\'\rd the ball in a decisive game against Manhattanville determining who would attend the State Tournarnent. On Friday night the Dut~ chwomen exhibited their skill and aggressive nature as they thoroughly dominated a team from Potsdam State, and won 2- 0. Though the game was scoreless at halftime the Union squad Was continually . atw tacking as they controlled. the pace of the game. With their sharp passes and hard drives they never allowed, Potsdam to sustain an attack and senior Cathy Bentley registered her third shutout in tending the nets. Cogcaptain Sue. Ensel ta\lied first for Union as she blasted a Shot from the top of the circle past the goalie. Just a few minutes later a bueutiful cross by senior Etnily Mono~:~ son was directed around the goalie by freshman Cheryl Washburn. Coach Morrison expressed that the game was a good solid team effort and that even tthough mistakes wete made, everyone supported each other Well and never allowed Potsdam's of- fense to become unleashed. On Saturday afternoon the Union team played a squad from Manhattanville ln a game that was decisive in deter- mining who would attend the State Tournament. Earlier in the day Manhattanville had played Potsdam on the turf and they were thoroughly adjust~d · halt breakaways by picking the ball off of a player and neatly feeding it back to the attack. This year Sue has been a leader on the field, always working on positioning and being a force that cemented the defense together. A new treat for Sue· has been - her · scoring capabilities; as she has scored and assisted on several op- portunities from penalty situations. · Two year starter Julie DelDeo is another strong, steady defenseman and coach Morrison stated that Julie contains opponents very well and allows teammates to reposition theinSelv.es before moving in for the kill. Seniors Holly Howard and Bernadette Albanese, who both play midfield link spots will also be gone next year. The two have similar styles in that they are hard fighting and intense throughout the games. Their leadership styles often inspire others with their aggressive manner of play and they can be counted upon both offensively and defensively to do whatever is needed. The lone senior on the for- ward line is Emily Monosson. Emily has been a four year starter for Union, and while not a flashy player, . Emily definitely possesses the finest skills on the team. She shows these talents in her consistent ability to carry the ball down the field weaving between the opponents and then setting up a beautiful offensive play. In fact Marty stated that: \Emily is one of the strongest right wings that I have had in fifteen years of coaching, and most certainly one of the finest players ever at Union.\ Emily has five goals and numerous assists this season and her skills will be sorely missed in the future. Wlille each senior has given a great deal to the team, it is their contribution as a unit that has shaped the squa,d in a positive , way. Coach Morrison expressea her pleasW'e in the season and attributed it to the leadership qualities both on ancl off the field of the seniors. Though next year's _team will be missing some familiar faces, Coach Morrison is optimistic that the remaining people will be a strong nucleus of talented players quite capable of producing an excellent squad. Returning for the Dutchmen will be freshmen forwards Marcie Viener, Cheryl Wash- burn, sophomore Dianne Moskaluk, and junior Cay Lynch. All four players have improved over the seasqn and have shown their ability to skillfully carry the ball down the field as well as to be an aggressive ttu'eat in front -of the cage. Defensively, freshmen Julie Fitzsimmons and Janet Schieferdecker will aid sophomore Carolyn Gilbert in frustrating the opponents. The Union field hockey program is very strong and is considered a powerhouse of northeastern .New York. This Jetson believes that ·next year will again produce another successful season, .and just wants to wish the best of luck to all Union field hockey players wherever their Indian Dribbles may lead them. 1982 Union College Field Hockey Statistics SCORING Name -13 ·Game Totals- Dianne Moskal uk Emily Monosson Cheryl Washburn Sue Ensel Holly Howard Marcy Viener Julie Fitzsimmons Carolyn Gilbert Bernadette Albanese Totals Opponents TEAM STATISTICS Shots Saves 1st half goa Is 2nd half goa Is Overtime goals GOALIE Yr.

If these girls stick with it and continue to improve, ·I fully expect that by the time they are seniors, Union will bave a very good, strong women's soccer team.\ Througbout the season, Union had been led by some excell~nt offensive ':play from senior Dina Pliotis and freshmen Astrid Morsch and Rebecca Clemente. Defensively, seniors Tracy LaMarca . and Margaret Sim· mons and freshmen Patty Richards and Kathleen Taylor, as well as senior goalie Jane Webb, have all played ex- tremely well.

Out striders By SPORTS STAFF The women's X-C team has been so busy rwming that they haven't had time to be in- terviewed for an article. All that nmning is paying off however -because Union defeated the much-feared RPI women's team in a dual meet Homecoming weekend, Oct. 16. Inge R. Stockman ran ef- fortlessly over the 2.86 mile course at Central Park beating RPI' s first girlwith no problem. Chris L. SU~r finished-next for Union with no competition around her. Joan K. O'Connor battled ·with the next RPI runner for the whole course and finally outstrided her at the end. SueS. Stopera and. Jenny W.R. Snover ran well finishing sixth ·and ninth overall. Kathy S. Healy practiced the course all week and had a strong race. After the victory, the Union women relaxed but knew they would have to take on RPI the next week in the Capital District meet along with Albany and Siena. The air was tense as Union, the defending Capital District champs, stretched out and searched for an open bathroom at their home course at Central Park. Siena would be no problem to beat becaus.e they had no women runners and RPI was no threat but Albany State had rebuilt its team with many \good and skinny\ freshmen. But once again Inge held off the competition, shattering her previous course record and finished first With the time of 16:20. Albany State proved to be as strong as expected, sharing the next six places with only one RPI .girl. Chris ran as easily as ever, again with no one around her, placing eighth overall. Sue ran a personal best for the 2.86 course, followed closely by Joan and the wounded Janice Glidden, placing ninth, tenth and eleventh overall. Jenny, tired of being teased about getting lost, finally learned the course and finished strong. The women's record is now 5 and 3 and will travel to Geneseo this Sat., Oct. 30 for the NYSAIAW state meet. Sue Ensel helps bring Tlie Aces to victory agaihst the Bronner Bruisers (Jeanne Watt pictured) with a 2-0. The games were won 15-5 and 15-10.

Excellent footwork and netplay proved· to be Union's fortes. as they quickly banded Siena three losses. This contest provided the wannup for Union's defense of the Northeast Tournament at~ Williams College .this past weekend. Saturday morning was the meeting time for a gruoge match against WeUesley, who had finished second· to· Union in ,previous meetings.

The women's tennis team recently completed its season with a miraculous record of 9-2. The grand finale to its un- believable season was the team's fiue performance at the NYS Collegiate Tournament in Rochester, NY. Co-captain Julie Miller, seeded ninth, produced the most stunning results of the tournament by winning the consolation draw. Thus she placed fifth in the ·overall standings of the tour- nament, out of a field of sixty- four singles players. In her first two matches, Julie defeated her Albany and Vassar opponents, 6'(), 6-3, and 6-2, 6-3, respec- tively. Julie then encountered a more difficult match in the quarterfinals against her second seeded opponent from Nazareth. Although Julie lost a close one, she was fed into the consolation draw and produced outstanding results. She pulled out a semifinal victory in a tight three-setter against Harriet Feldman, from Barnard. She then routed her St. Lawrence opponent in the finals by a score of 6-4, 6-3. seeded player, Anne Borish from Vassar, with a score oflb-1, 6..0.

Brenda is the captain of the 1982 Varsity Volleyball team. Her leadership and excellent play these past four years have been unparalleled. This past weekend she was named to the Northeast Tournament All-8tar team. It is difficult to determine an \outstanding\ volleyball player. It is not like football, soccer, tennis, or basketball, where one can score a goal, intercept a pass, make a basket, or single-handedly win a game. One cannot shine brighter than the rest of the team. Everyone in volleyball contributes to make a point and there exists no sharp distinction as to who the \better\ player is. Brenda, however, has excelled 'in all areas and has been the back- bone of this year's team. I, as well as the rest of our squad, feel that her dedication to our. team as well as Block U should be recognized: perhaps next week. Thanky.ou, Catherine Gifford Senior, 1982 Volleyball team Editorst note: Look for an in- depth profile on Brenda Bugick in the November 11 issue of the Concordiensis.

Beth's second round match was perhaps the biggest upset of the tour- nament. Beth crushed the third The doubles teams also contributed to Union's achievements at State. Rita (Spoons) Lindenberg and Pam (Green Pepper) Marcus played extremely well. Unfortunately, they encountered an unlucky draw, as they met two tough opponents who continued on to the final rounds of the totir- nament. Their first match was against William Smith, and despite the fact that Pam and Rita had never played together as a doubles team, they fought valiantly, eventually suc· cumbing to defeat 3-6, 1~. Their consolation match against St. Lawrence was also difficult. Despite the illegal presence of the St. Lawrence coach and supporters on the court, the two played well, but eventually were 1 defeated 1~. , 0-6. . · The doubles team of Linda Esposito and Nancy Judson scored impressive victories in their matches, making it to tbe qualifying round of the quar- terfinals in the consolation draw. The two got a bye in the first round and later faced opponents from Stony Brook who used unusual tactics to psyche out the Dutchwornen. Growling, grunting, and spit- ting is not considered good court etiquette. Although Linda and Nancy maintained their NOTICE!!! The team scored the best record at the State Tournament of any women's tennis'team at Union. According to Coach Arakelian, \we're looking forward to an even better season next year, despite the loss of our most versatile player, senior Nancy Judson.r'A good time was had by all, and the Rowntowners Lounge will never be the same after Rita and Pam's debut on stage. The Dutchwomen learned a few pointers on the spoons as well as some exGiting techniques on the ride home. The Dutchwomen finisheq their season with a victory over Hamilton 4-3. Victory was clinched with the fine play of fifth singles Alissa Calabria. The Dutchwomen have been an impressive part of the Union athletic program this fall. According to Nancy \Killer\ Judson, \'the tennis team deserves all the r;-ecognition provided by my fine Con· cordiensis articles.\ The Dutchwomen look for another outstanding season next year.

,, Page 22 OONOORD SPORTS· Sports Talk By SCOTT WYKOFF Sports Staff John Reeves, director of athletics at University of Rochester, has come up with the idea that colleges l.n the United States should offer a new major in the study of professional athletics. . Granted,. his proiXJsal is di~ected to the major sports- oriented collegesthroughout the nation, but what do you think of the curriculum for a course in professional athletics would entail at Union College? With the state of professional athletics today who knows what would be taught to students. I really have trouble believing that Reeves was serious when he talked of this propos~:~!. He believes that the curriculum should be designed for those college . players that want to become pro athletes. Reeves believes that it would be better than \borderline illiterates getting college degrees or athletes investing four years and not getting a college degree at all.\ I believe Reeves' plan is both a thoughtless and feeble at- tempt at solving the problems that institutions have today with the big-time college athlete. Reeves' plan seems to compound the problem that already exists today. What makes Reeves think that bor- derline illiterates will do any better in a pro athletics course than the \physical education classes that are already offered today. The answer, Mr. Reeves, is that they won't. Borderline student athletes will still graduate as before. Just a simple change in curriculum will have no effect on the motivation of many of these big time college athletes. Reeves' plan is also weak in the sense that what will happen to the pro athlete graduates that don 1 t ever make it. in pro athletics? Basically they will get a degree but the four years that they put into getting the degree will be wasted. Though Reeves' attempt of restoring academic integrity is feeble, ther~ is a ~oup of twenty-eight concerned college administrators that instead of perpetuating the problem are trying to cure it for good. This group met in Washington recently .and drew up a list of reforms that could help to retutn academic integrity to big time college sports. One proposal calls for a minimum grade .point average for athletes. This minimwn grade point average. woUld also be combined with a requirement that athletes maintain satisfactory progress toward a ·degree while remaining in good academic standing. They are also looking o into reconunending that fresh- ] men be made ineligible for a. varsity competition. This is an t-= attempt to give incomingfresh- !l! man athletes the chance to get off to a .good academic start without the high pressures of big time athletics getting in the way. · Colleges such as NCAA basketball finalists Georgetown and North Carolina have proved that with a concerned effort big time athletic schools can graduate their top notch athletes. Georgetown and North Carolina had a total of eight senior regulars between them last year; they all graduated. But recent -statistics also show that these refonns in college athletes' requirements can't be left up to the respective colleges without control. Sporihlg News pollS have shown that only 42 percent of the senior regulars on teams that par- ticipated in the NCAA and NIT tournaments obtained th~ir diplomas. Eastern schools on a whole are shown to be making the most .progress in this area in recent years. Academic ~ integrity and college athletics will never be a problem at a school like Union, . but those major universities that don't soon attack this problem will find themselves without any academic integrity at all. · CHRISTIAN FELLOWSHIP Meets Every Tuesday at 4:30p.m. in the 4th Floor lounge CARNEGIE HALL -Come ioin us for Bible Study, Singing and Sharing- ~;i;j.;J;j.;J.;j.;#~;#;#;J.;j. - . ~-J: Spend Halloween at the Haunted House of Delta Upsilon ...

Union, presently holding a 3·7-1 record, will at best finish 6-7-1. The Dutchmen fell to the Colgate soccer team 3.0 in action at Colgate last Wed- nesday afternoon. Union not only battled the NCAA Division I foe, but the howling wind as well. Union played with their backs to the wind in the first half, and utilized it to their greatest potential. During the initial period, Union forced the play to the Colgate end by using the wind to carry the passes. down field. However, neither the Dutchtnen nor Colgate was able to score and the game remained scoreless at the halfway mark. In the second half, the highly skilled Colgate booters recorded three goals, two of which, the first and the third, were affected by the strong _wind. The first goal was a ditect effect of the blowing wind as tender Mike Harris misjudged a hard shot, and the ball Skipped by into the goal. The second goal was a header scored from just outside the crease of the net on an assist from the left wing. The wind recorded its second tally of the afternoon with a minute to play in the match. Harris threw the ball to a defensive back, . but the wind held the ball up in the air, and three Colgate strikers con- verged on the loose ball to score on a three-on-one.
