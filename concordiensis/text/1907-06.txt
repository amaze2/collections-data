\' THE CoNcoRDIENSIS V,OL. XXX. UN:lON COLLEGE,, JUNE 15, 1907 No. 28 did not command her genuine interest. She was keenly ap:predative of an address or a book by a MARGARET MORRIS RAYMOND professor, and of a debate or a baseball ga.me by the students. VV\h.ether she cared for the thing An Appreciation itself or not, the fact that it represented the col- In Mrs. Raym.ond Union College has lost one of lege ·at once aroused her feeling. She m.ade the its most loyal friends. She was so l-ong confined President's house the true center of college life, to the house and unable to carry on her usual welcoming there everyhody who belonged to the activities and hospitalities, that those who have college, faculty and students alike, attracting been here but a. year or two can hardly imagine then1 by all sorts of means and taking part her- what an enthusiastic and active part she used to self in all their interests. take in the college world. But even when she could take no active part, she was a.'3 e:J:gerly in- terested as ever. The college was on her heart to the very end, and even in the :rast few days of her life she longed ardently to live at least so long that the one hundred and eleventh commence- ment of Old Union might pass off with the suc- cess and brilliancy that we had hoped for. But this desire was not to be satisfied. Mrs. Ray- mond died at five in the morning on Alurnni Day. The n1ain -facts of her life are well known but they sho·uld be stated in a college publication. Margaret Mlorris Thomas was born in Wales, de- riving perhaps from Celtic ancestry the poetry, - I vitality and loyalty that were so strikingly char- acteristic of her. She was brought very early to The devotion to the college, however, was but the expression of a dominant element in her char- acter, namely an intense and eager loyalty. She was absolutely true to her friends as to her col- lege, church or tovvn. She sho·wed this loyalty, not merely in keeping in teres ted in the lives of others but in seeking to share with them the in- tellectual and artistic interests that were her own keen delight. For she had a strong and active personal life of her own, delighting in books and pictures and flo·wers-all of \vhich things she de- sired to share with others. She had an intense and eager interest in the things of the spirit and of the mind, and understood their uses ro well that she never tried to keep them to herself. Her death leaves a place in college life that no this country by her .parents, L~ewis J. Thornas fill s h · 1 t 'th one can . uc · a woman IS rar<=; y me WI , and Mary M:orris, who settled in Middleville, Herkirner County. She was educated at the Os- wego Normal S.chool. ·On Sept ern ber 24, 1879 she married the Rev. Andrew V. V. Raymond, at that tilne pastor of the First Reformed Church of Pat- terson, N. J. As D 1 r. Raymond was called to Plainfield, and then to Albany, she became well known in those cities, but our chief interest in her is as the wife of the President of Union Col- lege, where Dr. Raymond was inaagurated in 1894. Mrs. Raymond was devotedly in_terested in the colege. There was no term. of college life that but it is more rare that such a woman is in a position in which she can appeal to everybody. That was what Mrs. Raymond was to the Col- lege. There was no. one in the student body or in the circle of fa.culty life who could not gain from her the interest in culture and the thin,gs of th€;' mind, the sympathy in effort and attainment that - she could give. The college loved and ~ppre- ciated her, m1d joins her family and more per ... sonal friends in their grief at her loss.

A :tna..rked feature was the great finan- cial. stride fol!\ward that l!.ad its inception last year. Added to the completed fund of $100,- 000 and the $100,000 raised by the Alumni As- sociation, an. additional amount w·as promi.sed by the gene:ra.l education. fund committee that has charge of distrib-ating the Rockefeller monies. To meet this the colleg~e has to raise an equal amount in three years. At present there is .an endowment f-and ~f $300,000. When the entire amount is raised it is expected that $300,000 will be placed in good securities for the college, and that $100,000 will be spent in erecting new buildings. Baccalaureate Sermon The regular commencement exercises were opened on Sunday evening with the Bacca- laureate Sermon, held in the First Reformed Church. The .Seniors, as usual, attended in a body and occupied the front seats. The open- ing prayer was delivered by Dr~ B. W. R. Tayler. Dr. Riaymond delivere<l the Baccalaureate Sermon from t'he text from Matthew xxvii, 22: \What sha.ll I do with Jesus Christ?\ In part the sermon vvas.: \A persistent question-as pertinent today as when Pilate 'aSked it-and as fateful; the one question, in :fact, which more than any other has made history and is m.aking history. \Now as a:t first, its importance is not clearly seen. Yet under the symbol of the cross 'have been won th.e successive victories of civiliza- tion. \It is all very real, this persistent influence of the life that seemed to end on Calvary. It was real when after Jiis death His disciples were gathmwed in an upper room and the door being shut, . .Jesus stood in the midst of them. It is real to day when all over our land men are asking what is right and are seeking to make the right effective. Our ideas of right, our ideals of character, our convictions of duty, ara drawn from t'he life and teachings of .Jesus, which is called Christ. \And now, as nineteen hundred years ago, what is to be done with Him is. the question of supreme rnorn·ent, both for the individual and the state. \The Cbrfst with wltom we have to do is, then, the Ghrist who puts humanity first-hu- man interests above .all other co-nsiderations. '''There is no escape from this teaching and influence of Jesus which is called Christ. He is present in.. every association and conference, in every tribunal and court where the good of offenders pleads against the arbitrary penalties of impersonal law. The question of the age making current hi.story, in an popular agita- tions, in all the unrest of society, in all the strivings of unsatisfied 'huinanity, is 'What shall we do with Jesus, which is called Christ?' ''Materialistic thought, scientific discoveries have not banis'hed Him and cannot banish Him. \Over against every theory of life that ex- cludes spiritual energy, spiritual ministry, we place the testimony of His faith, with its power to enrich and ennoble and glorify human ex- istence. \By the testimony of life itself it is rno·re real than the solid earth beneath our feet. The tests of .science may banish God and make a mockery of prayer, but the prayer that brings peace to a troubled 'heart and strength to a weakened will, that gives purpose and courage, purifying thought and kindling love, brings God back, and the witness of that soul-experience outweighs all the protests of reason., the the- ories and deductions of the human mind . \Every generation has asked 'What shall we do with Jesus, which is called Ghrist? Wthat shall we do with the truth of human brother- hood held before us by the Son of Man, who came not to be ministered unto but to minister, who gave t'he first place in His thought and life to the rights and needs of humanity?' What answer have the generations given? Slowly but surely the cry has diminished in volume and intensity, 'A way with Him. Crucify Him. Cru- cify Him.' Slowly but surely the power of selfishness has decreased and the interests of . humanity grow upon the thought and life of the world. We see that in the legislation that increasingly protects the weak and helpless from the robbery of the strong, the laws against child labor and all the inhuman conditions of the life of the toilers. We see it in the deM mands for sanitation in our cities, for cleanliM ness and light and air in our tenements and factories, for protective devices and preventive measures. Not yet is the choice of the Son of Man absolute and complete. Still, as of old, traditional ideas, inherited privileges, inspire the cry; 'Away with Him.' The blind selfishness which robs life of the satisfaction and joy of 1 t ] v y VI ti v y y h sJ n ci g: el ci tc fc Is s:r cl

Ee s'ltaU see of the travail of H'is soul and be satis.fied. \We cannot say) however, tha:t the choice .of the Son of God is yet absolute and com.plete. Now, as of old~ Barabbas has his friends. Ideas and theories that rob 1.nan of his ,s·oul and leave him like a beast to pedsh, are chosen by many instead of the truth as it is in Jesus, whicb. is called Christ; but the .spirit is rnightier than the flesh, and the time will come when spiritual truth will he supreme, and every knee will bow and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God, the Father. ''Young gentlemen of the Graduating Class:- \I have spoken for you, and now I speak to you. \Wihat will you do with Jesus, which is called Christ? By that question I really ask, What will you make of your lives, of yourselves;· for your relation to Jesus Christ wHl determine your character and your careers. You cannot ignore Hhn. With His spirit of service 'he offers you large and abundant life. Will you accept it, or do you choose instead absorbing self-interest that robs life of dignity and great- ness, leaving a name without honor or praise? vVith His spirit of Sonship to God, He offers you the ministry of the eternal world, which will give you light in dark hours, guidance in times of perplexity, comfort in your sorrows, victory over death. Will you accept it, or do you choos.e instead so:me theory that will rob you of your soul with its treasures of faith and hope? God help you to choose with disciple- ship to Jesus Ghrist, fuHness of life, and blessed- ness here and hereafter .. ~· Grove Exercises Tuesday afternoon at 3 P. M. the Ivy exer- cises were held in Jackson's garden. The class marched from the chapel to the garden, singing the class song. President White, who introduced the speak- ers, first ga. ve a brie{ history of the Ivy exer- cises, explai11ing it was a time 'honOI~ed custom to observe them, that they were recognized by former classes, and made sacred by time. Herbert Edward Cantwell of St. Simon's Island, Ga., then gave the Ivy o·ration. The speaker touched upon the time spent by the class at Unlon, on the obsta,cles which they had overcome, and said that many had reac'hed the desired goat After a brief selection by the orchestra, inter- sper$ed. with ciJ.ass yells, and the Terrace song, Fred Girvin of ScheRectady read the Ivy poem. In this the writer :touched upon the beauties of nature and on. the .significance of the Ivy exercises. M;eanwh'ne the \pipe of peace'' used at these exercises for numberiess years, was passed around .among the seniors. 'The jug, likewise most ancient, was also in ·existence. The exercises were conduded with the Pipe oration by D. Eenry Osborne, 2nd., ~of Victor. In this speech the speaker showed the soothing effects of the pf:pe upon the troubled student. He ,said that aH who had ever used pipes would never forsake them, and that it is {)11€ of the most cherished possessions of the graduate. The ,class then marched to the library where the Ivy was planted. After cheering- the vine the seniors dispersed. Prize- Speaking T'he annual junior and sophomore orations, in conjunction with the ex:temporaneous prize speaking contest, was 'held in the First Re- formed Church Monday evening. ':rhe affair proved most interesting, and the decisions in each insta.nce were close. T'he Sophomore con- tests, with prizes of $20 a.nd $10, were won by Elmer K. Mol!lld of Green Island and Robert L. Brunet of Petersburg, Va., respectively. Thomas E. Hannigan of Schenectady won first honors in the Ju.nior contest, with Arthur B. King of Troy second. Prizes of $30 and $15 were awarded in this contest. The extern- poraneous speaking contest, with a prize of $50, was won by Martin Ir. \W{eyrauch of Liberty. The judges for the Junior and Sophomore contests were C. C. Thorn of Windhan1, N. Y., Professor Ed. Hayward of Cohoes, and B. D. Rushmore of this city. The extemporaneous speaking contest was judged by the Hon. Joseph E. Ransdell, '82, of Louisiana, Profes.sor James <A Fair grieve Saratoga. of Fu It on and Willard Lester of Alvin Ury, the first speaker for tbe Sopho- mores, took for his subject \General Stoessal.\ He graphically described the humiliations and insults with which the former commander of Port Arthur was subjugated on his return to his native land after the downfall of fllat fort- ress. Robert L. Brunet then spoke 011 \South- ern Immigration.\ He decla..red that much of the prejudice and 'hatred thEtt existed in the South against the negroes was caused wholly by their indolence. He then showed the natural trend of in1migration was toward the South, and

, I 'i d· ' I : t : ;! 'I q; '\ I , I ,, . \ ' ~ I, II I ·' I , I: . I I ! : ! ' 8 that this was\ highly desirable. \The Present Age~' was a subject admirably treated by Ralph. .J. Ury. He briefly compared the past with an its glory of war and conquest with the achieve- meRts of to-day,. and declared that there was never suc·h a hopeful period in the history of mankind. Elmer K. Mould took as his subject \The Permanency of General Schuyler's Fame.\ He declared that the unpopularity of General SchuyJer was due to his forceful disposidlion, and c·haracterized him as one of the gr€atest and • nobJ,est figures in American history. The speak- er's enunciation was .excellent and his delivery forceful. T'he Junior contest was opened by William D. Hildreth, who spoke on ''T'he Juggernaut of America.\ He quoted statistics showing that the great loss of life in railroad acci<ients was caused not only through negligence on the part of the railroad offi.cials, but was due to a great deg-ree to indifference .,.on the part of the public. Arthur B. King in his \Pervers~ons of the Con- stitution\ forcibly declared that the present day perversions tend toward a centralized despotism and that state rights must be preserved. Thomas E. Hanigan gave a brief but interesting account of the early history of the college, and said that the traditions wh:ch cluster about \Old Union\ have been and will continue to be of ilnmense benefit to the college. Raymond 0. Shelly fol- lowed with \The American Constitution.\ He characterized the constitution as a 1nasterpieee, and declared that it was an important factor in our natural greatness. In the extemporaneous speaking a slight vari- ation to the usual custom was introduced by Professor M~cKean in that two of the speakers took the negative and two the affirm.ative side of the subject. Refutation of arguments, how- ever, was mutually dispensed with. The specific subject for consideration was: \Resolved That the United States should take the initiative in an impartial official investigation into the af- fairs in the Congo, looking .toward deposing I<:i11g Leopold of 'his power and adopting a per- manent policy for the good of the people. Charles N. Waldron, taking the affirmative, dealt with the subject under three headings: \Wihy should any action be taken; Why should Leopold be deposed, and Why should the United States take the initiative? His remarks were interesting throughout. Joseph T. Wright strongly defended King Leopold 7 whom, he de- clared, had used all his resources, both financial and political, in developing the Congo, and fur- thermo~re, that the country must refrain from interference in foreign affairs. Ross D. T'iffany gave a history of the discovery and .develop1nent of the Con g-o region. He referred to the Sen.- ate resolut-Lon and various writings as tending to show th.e necessity for some definite action. Mart:n H. Weyrauch, the last speaker of the evening, d~clared that King Leopold was a benefactor, not a monster; that he was more maligned than present circumstances should \Varrant. H.e quoted various authorities to substant·iate his line of reasoning. The j.udg-es then brought in. their verdicts and the exercises of the evenhlg were concluded. Ahunni ~[eeting The Alur-nni Association held its annual meet- ing in t'he oehapel Tuesday morning at 11 o'clock. The main business transacted was the election of Charles B.

Ola.ss Day Ex:e·J•cises The class functLoJilS of the Seniors were brought to a close 'Jl\~'uesday afternoon with the class day exercises, h,eJd in the First Reformed Church. The president's address was made by Albert Huntley White, of Manchester, N. H. He first spoke of the great loss to the class and to the College in the death of Mrs. Raymond, and then gave the official farewell of the class to the city. N. V. V. Franchot, '2nd, then read the history, the historian, Mr. Weller, being unable to at- tend. Jaines G. BTennan of Albany gave the class orati·on, chargtng the Seniors to live up to high ideals. ~he class poem was read by R,alph Winne Stearns of Schenectady, and Lewis 8. Parsons of Liberty gave the prophecy. This completed the exercises of the afternoon. At a meeting of fhe class, held immediately after this, a comini ttee was appointed to draw up resolutions of sy1npathy with President Ray- mond's farnily. OoiniiJ.enceinent Day Wednesday witnessed the final function of the week in the Commencement exercises held at half past ten in the First Reformed Church. The exercises were opened by singing the 11 7th psaln1, follow€d by a prayer by the Rev. L. Clarke Seelye, D_ D., '57, president of Sm.ith College. The first oration, \'The Inevitableness of So- cial Question,\ was delivered by Raymond S. Bennett, of Schenevus, N. Y. He spoke upon two phases of the question, the evil and the good. He dealt wi-th the working man versus the capitalist and s.h()wed the existing relations between them one hundred years ago and today, Harold Gardiner, of Hadley, took as his su.b- ject, \Charles E. Hughes: An Appreciation.\ He spoke of the ab ii ity, forcefulness and incor- ruptibility \'of the governor of this state, in his public life; and of th€ love and sympathy in his home life. He told ()f Governor Hughes' achieve- ments ii1. public life, of his insul~ance investiga- tions and finally of his election as chief execu- tive of this state. The next oration was delivered by Lewis Stewart Parsons, of Liberty, who took for his subject, \The Idol and the Ideal.\ M[r. Parsons compared this country with those of the old world, in regard to the frenzied desire of the American to .secure money. \Business he said, \is the one factor in life in this coun- try which c·o;rrupts the legislatures, but it can- not corrupt s.uch men as Theodore Roosevelt or Charles E. Hughes.\ Albert Hu.nUey White, of Manchester, N. H., spoke upon ''The Quest for Error.'' Mr. White told of the corruption of corporations and gov- ernments by hiding behind the law. \The hon- est forces of law,\ he said, \are not capable to cope with the insidious force of technicality. The wheels of justice are clogged by the formal- ity of procedure.\ The valedictory address was delivered by Fred Girvin. He took \The .State an.d the Criminal\ as his subject, and spoke of the relations be' tween the State and the criminal; of how sta- tistics show that the average criminal is a dis- charged convict. \As long as the convict is liberated from our prisons, so long will crime exist, growing more each year. The only way to protect society from the crim.inal is to re- move him from society. This can be done by intermediate sentences) the length to be judged by the character of the man.'' Following this came the Chancellor's address, delivered by Hon. Joseph E. Ransdell, '82, who spoke in part as follows: \I shall take as my subject, 'The Responsibil- ity of Wiealth,' and I beg your attention upon a subject which has been dealt with before, for as Solomon said, 'There is nothing new under the sun.' Wealth is not the embodiment of everything desired in this life, for merchant princes, copper kings, oil kings and other mov- ing factors in the business life of the world, have offered their fortunes for health, sight and hearing . \There is no more evil maxim in this world than that of 'wealth, wealth.' The average working class are dependent upon the rich. The rich man should give his surplus wealth for the relief of misery. This would be a utopia which probably none of us will live to see, but I firmly believe it will cqme. \In the early days of the Roman Empire the wife was subject to the every caprice of the husband; there was no hon1.e life known and divorces were practiced freely. The wealthy Roman divorced and re-married freely, without Rcandal, but nowadays a great cry goes up against this pracUce. •

! ' , I ,, . ,, ', ' '• il ·I ! l ' ,, ! 'l! 11, 'l'HE CONCORbiE:NStS \I'm not a believer in trusts, but I believe that if the good people in society should organ- ize to drive out these divorce lepers, the home life ~ould. be saved. The home life can not survive if the evil practice of divorce con- ttnues.\ Mr. Ransdell spoke of the good done by the rich in relieving suffering, but said that the per- centage of 'helpers was much too low. He closed his address by saying: \Half of the corrup- tion in this life is due to the ·lavish expenditure of money; the bringing up of the child in the lap of luxury with the character neglected for the seeking of pleasure. \Accidents upon railroads, and by other meth- ods o.f travel, could be avoided, to a great ex- tent, if the ric·h would take the necessary pre- cautive measures. \Sons of Old Union, may each of you succeed and attain your heart's desire; may you go out into this world with clean morals and a God.:. fearing character. Should you fail once in this life do not forget that you are the sons of the grandest old college in this country, and strike out anew to succeed.\ Degrees were then conferred to the members of the graduating class and the prizes were awarded as follows: Ingham Prize-A.
