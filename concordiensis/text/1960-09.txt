Many honest Freshmen have on their own voli- tion. admitted that they are being \dirty rushed,\ and although they are too timid themselves to re- pulse it, they nonetheless want no part of it. '!'he first violation was reported, alleging that two freshmen were gh·en a hitch to Skidmore ·by fra- ternity men. Under the spunsorship of Alan August of Phi Sigma Delta, a mo- tion was passed to move the da:te of the first stag parties which (Continued frol;ll Page 2) IFC Interprets¥ Rushing Rules William Kil'chgasser, President of the IFC today announced the Interpretation of the most fre- quently questioned rushing rules. Contact between freshmen and fraternity men on campus (but nqt in dor!nitories or fraternity houses) is allowed providing the conversation does not involve a fraternity or fraternities. Absolu- tely no contact is allowed off <;ampus, including the Rath- skellar. No fraternity men are allowed in North and West Colleges at any time. Fraternity men may enter the fil·st floors· of these dormitories only ·on official ·busi- ness of a. recognized campus ac- tivity and then only with the ex- press prior permission of the Dean of Students. While there is no regulation regarding the wearing of pins, jackets and other fraternity re- galia, beads of all activities are requested to help minimize the excessive use of such apparel as advertisement during the fuction- ing of the activity. Kirschgasser reminded the stu- dent body · that the IFC has agreed to penalise vioiations of the rushing rules with the utmost severity and urged freshmen and fraternity men alike to stay within the exact letter of the Ia w at all times. The Rushing Rules Enforce- ment Committee is composed of Brad Arthur, Chairman, Psi Up- silon, Thomas Landsberg, Ka.ppa Nu, Decker Adams, Sigma Phi 1 . and Daniel Grenning, Delta Phi.

H1s A Thinking Man Student Integrity:lgnored The sudden and somewhat i\1 con~uctecl introrluc~ion of new fraternity social rules this weeK has.resulted m a student reaction of hitterne:;s \vhich may lJltn:na~el~ cause more bad feeling on the campus than the vmchctJveness of the rules thems€1ves. Stuctent sentiment was. expresse~ last night at a joint meeting of the Inter Fratermty Counc1l and the Alumni lnter Fraternity Council. . The specific provisions of the new gocial rules w11l be the subject of future editorial comment in these columns. Briefly, the new 1·ules are not mu.ch more ba~kward than the archaic rules under which l.lmon has suftered for the past few years. The issue of the day is not the rules per se, but the way i11 which they were intnKluced to the col- lege community. The Alumni Trustees, who dt·afted the rules under a newly-formed Alumni Inter Fraternity Council, which was hastily organizer! during the summer months, are all.re- sponsible individuals who in the past hare worked tire- lessly for the irnprovement of the fraternity system. Nevertheless, as well-intentioned as they U]l(loubtably wer~, they lack close contact with the undergTaduate body. Tins was dramatically pointed out at last ni~ht's meeting whe~ the chahman of the social rules comnnttee of the Alumm IFC was unable to answer many of the undergraduate questions about the rules, admitted on several occasions that some of the p1·ovisions might merit rnoctification, but was unfamiliar with the channels throug;l1 which possible modifications could IJe made. The meeting, which was reminiscent of a local Kiwanis gathering, v.·as frequently derr1eaned by such remarks as \when I was an undergraduate, I ne\·er ::1ttended a party which ended latel' than midnig-ht.\ Despite the fact that his title appears above the new social rules, and despite an attached letter under his signa- ture warning all undergraduates that the mles \are effec- tive immediately,\ Dean of Students 0. Ectward Pollock announced priOl' to the meeting that he v;ould not attend because he conside1·s the rules a matter of debate only for the fraternities and \your alumni trustees who drafted them.\ This, too, despite the fact that in an interview earlier this week, Dean Pollock had an obviously more complete knowledge of the rules than the representatives of the committee \\vho dt·afted them. It is perhaps unde1·standalJie because of the nature of his job that Dean Pollock might wish to disassociate him- self from the social rules in order to avoid placing himself in the middle of campus controversy. The Alumni JVC' and De:m Pollock acted in disregard of the estaLlishetl principle of student g<>vcrnment at Un- ion. For it is one of l'nion's proudest tr.cHlitions that her undergraduates \\!Ol'k harmoniously with the faculty and administration in legislating the rules re~·arding student life. So successful has this tradition been that in the past many positive imp1·ovements have been effected entirely on ·stud('nt initiative. \Vise college administrators know that students respect and live by the rules their own lead- ers legislate, no matter how restrictive. The integTity of student governme11t at Union can only be presen·€d if the student body refuges, through its elected representatives, to accept the ne1v rules until their grievences have l.Jeen heard and considered.

Thus was constructed a systematic pro- gram designed to disturb the in- dividual, shock the complacent, explode the myths of the unques- tioning prejudiced, and yet remain with the essence that is Union The Orientation Program itself reached its heights of achieve- ment during the seminar sessions, three of which were attended ·by each freshman discussing in turn •---------------1 with three professors one of the ~~~-·~~·~~~~*~~J~F·~~~·~=;!.i_ College.

The groups were small, and the professors were of the very best. Many good things have been said about these ses- sions. and it is hoped they shall .be continued. One only wishes that the same sincerity, Jove of learning, the same Jack of formal- ity, which pervaded these semin- ars could somehow be integrated into college life ~ a whole.

Probable starling right halfback will be letterman Jim Erceg, a speedy senior who can play at left half equally well.

So- phomore Pete Burgwald-hard hitting and speedy-has shown the ability that will assure him a starting ]l(}Sition at left halfback, but will probably not see action against Bates because of an in- jury.

The above is quoted from an interview which the Concordiensis conducted with Dean of Students 0. Edward Pollock at the time that his appointment to Union was an- nounced. The interview was pu·blished in the April 10, 1959 issue of Concordiensis. As the fraternity social rules controversy enters its third week, it is illuminating to recall some of Dean Pol- lock's statements regarding fratemity social rules, student government and his general philosophy of fraternities, The follewing is quoted directly and in complete con- text from a questionnaire submitted to Dean Pollock and published in the Concordiensis issue of October 9, 1959, just a wee!\ short of one year ago. What are your opinions of the current social rules in use by the college? Do you feel them in any way outmoded or in need of revision? It is rather early in the rear for lilt' to make mzr sound judg- ment concerning the zcorth of the prcSt'nt social regulations. It is conceivable that some of I hem might bozcfit from a careful re'View.

If anyone is in doubt what is or is not appropriate under existing rules, he is im•ited to contact me for a clarification. We heartily endorse the position that Dean Pollock has taken in the above statements. Clearly, they repTe- sent an enlightened and realistic viewpoint worthy of an individual who holds such a responsible post. · It is to be deeply reg-retted that the Alumni Inter Fraternity Council and Dean .Pollock chose to ignore this well founded advice. Both the Alumni IFC and Dean Pollock have the potential to constructively help fraterni- ties make a positive contribution to Union Coilege. As a result of the hasty and ill handled introduction of the new social rules, however, both parties lost respect in the eyes of the underg-raduates, and their effectiveness has declined proportionately. The Alumni IFC and Dean Pollock have pried open a Pandora's box of mistrust, suspicion, vindictiveness and hypocrisy. The Inter Fraternity Council has shown an eager will- ingness to cooperate with the Alumni IFC and Dean Pollock · to restore the atmosphere of harmonious progress of pl·e- controversy student g-overnment.

THE CONGO ARMY IN KASAl PROVINCE WAS RUNNING WILD, LOOTING THE CIVILIAN POPULATION IN SEARCH OF FOOD AND WOMEN. The Belgian Congo has offici· ally become the Republic of the Congo. The first meeting of its parliament was held amid con- tinued tribal fighting that has added to the growing death ton. Lumumba says that if he is ·elect- ed, he will offer the presidency to Kasavubu. Kasavubu declares that he will turn the offer down. Leopoldville became a dead city as all the. whites fled or barri· caded themsPlves in their houses.

He renews this offer to Kasavubu, and Kasavubu accepts. Lumumba has presented his first cabinet of 36 men, contain· ing an equal representation of both Left and Right \Vingers. July 11, 1960-- Moise Tshombe, premier of Ka- tanga Province which provides 60% of the Congo's revenue. has threatened again to secede rather than hand the province revenues over to the central government. The first Russian Delegation has arrived in the Congo. U.S. Special Envoy Robert Murphy has been mutineers, Kasavubu was at this time put in charge of the Force Publique. The situation in the Congo was shrugged off by Bel- gian Premier Eyskens as the .. minor growing convulsions of a young- nation.\ White settlers pleaded to Belgium for aid. In answer to their pleas, 250 Belgium paratroops were landed in Sabena Airline planes, appropriated from commercial flights. In Katango capital, Elizabethville, the scene of serious rioting, 25 Europeans were reported murdered and the U.S. and British consuls appealed to their respective countries for aid.

Lumumba vetoed his defense minister's request for American troops and instead asked for U.N. assistance, hinting that if he didn't get it, he might turn to Communist China. Meanwhile the Belgians stepped up their air- lifts of troops into the Congo. These troops began to get out of hand, refusing to go on pa- trols with nat·ive troops, attacl{- ing any stray Africans they found, and even manhandling U.N. of- ficial Ralph Bunche. By the end of the week the Belgians had re- stored some semblance of order in their ranks but had failed mis- erably in their attempt to seize the river port 'Of Matadi. The U.N. Security Council convened in emergency session and voted &-0 to send a 6,000 man force to the Congo effective within hours. Approximately 60,000 of the 80,000 Belgians in the Congo fled in the face of the looting and rape that were running rampant. Premier Tshombe declared the Province of Katanga an independent nation and asked for Belgian assistance in quelling the rioting. He also declared that under no circum- stances would U.N. troops be al- lowed in Katanga since there was no need for them. In the face of an 1800 man contingent ·of U.N. troops that landed in the Congm, Russian Premier Krushchev de- manded that the West \keep its hands off the Republic of Congo.\ The new troops were met by an ultimatum from Lumumba to clear all the Belgian troops out of the Congo in three days or he ''\ould call on \Soviet Russian troops\ for help. The Congo gov- ernment ground to a halt because of a lack of money and the ab- sence of about 10,000 Belgian civil servants. August 1, 1960- The death toll, according to Con- golese reports, was placed at twelve white and seventy-nine Congolese. British Major Gen- eral Henry TemplE>r Alexander was appointed temporary tactical commander of the U.N. forces. Congo leader Patrice Lumumba flew to New York to attend a session of the United Nations in the hopes that be could speed removal of Belgian troops.

At this point U.N. forces in the Congo were calculated to total 16,000 men. September 26, 1960- • modern industrial metltods used in the Congo The United Nations engaged in a debate th'at centered around the Congo crisis but was far reach- ing enough to encompass the question of the competence of the U.N.
