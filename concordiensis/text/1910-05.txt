This day has ·proved such a success for the last two years that it is now regarded as a college custom. 'r'his plan of 'bringing different sc:hools into ath- letic contests on our campus is one of best pos- ·si:ble means of increasing Union's reputation in the college world. Its ·possib~lities in influenc- ing prep school men to co:me to Union are w-on- derful. Too much credit can not :be given to the en- thusiastic mem!bers of t 1 he faculty, who have been the prom.oters of this movement. A word of appreciation is due, also, the executive com- mittee and. the other committees, all of which have been very careful in making plans that will best serve the real pur:pose of the day. We cannot emphasize too strongly, however, the suggest' on made at last college meeting to tte effect that t'he ultimate succes.s or failure of this day ·de.pends not on the faculty or on the committees.! 'but on You! . Ju~t in the degree that you lose sight of self in the effort to make the day a memora,ble -one to all the Su·b-Fresh- men with whom you come into contact, will the real succes.s of our Interscholastic Day be as- sured.

It seem.s highly fitting that we should express in these colum.ns a slight tri·bute to our :Seeretary of the Faculty, who, as tribute to our Secretary of the Faculty, who, as every student cannot have fa'led to know, has with his whole heart been a most faitD.ful serv- ant of the college in this im1=ortant position and Las been at all times an inten~Sely loyal friend of Union. Dr. Barnes' concern for tlhe welfare anrl growth of the college has been so strong and his interest in all student activitie.s has been so keen that he will be greatly m~ssed by faculty and students alike. It is needless to add that be ' i,~. i

B. :Silliman, of Cohoes, last week, Union Gollege has lost one of her oldest and most honored alumni, one of ter staunchest frteRd:S, and one of her most generous lbene·factors. N:ot only did he give to ·his Alma Mater Silli- man Hall and endow the :Silliman sc'holar.sh~ps, •but he has contributed most i1berally to almost every alumni fund. His 1philanthro·py reached even further than his college, for many edu- catioillal and p~1ilanthro1p~c institutions have rea- son to revere his name. Of such men it is true, that the good that men do lives after tihem. His long life of use- tuiness and of service sh0uld 1be an ins1piration to us. Throughout_ even his failing year.s his in- terest in his Alma Mater never fa~le-d. Of such alumni, we are justly proud. --------- (1M) PERTINEN1' PARAGRAPHS. Support the college activities.

10 'l'HE OONOORl)~~NSIS POEM WRITTEN BY UN,ION FHESHMAN PHINTE:D IN MORN·IING S.l'AR IN 1855. Interesting Dorp Daily Dated July 4, 1855, Found in Co1Ttents B1eneath Cornerstone of Second Dutch Church. Among the interesting· books, documents, new::;- papers, etc., that were found in the sealed lead box, that was recently taken fron1 beneath the cornerstone of the 1Second rReformed Church, corner of Jay and Liberty lStreets, was an issue of the first volume of the :Schenectady M·orning Star, a daily, ·dated July 4, 1·85·5, in which was a poen1 written ·by a freS'hman at Union and en- titled \Re·veries in the 'College Garden.' ,., The cornerstone of the cfiurch was laid on this Inde- r:;endence Day in 18'55 by the Reverend Isaac G. Duryee, the first pastor of the church, a graduate of Union and father and grandfather of Union m.en. It was through the courtesy of ·Reverend J. G. Meengs, the present pastor of the church, that a representative of the IConcordiensis was able to inspe·ct tD.e contents and .to copy the poem, among other ite·ms of interest, for publication. The Morning ·star. 'The :M·orning :Star in dimens' ons was slightly smaller than the modern newspaper and con- stated of a single folded sheet, making four pages of reading matter and adver.tisements. The lieads were invariably but a single line, and the para- graphs lengthy, some of them. extending over a 'h-alf column without a break. At the top of one column the pa:t:er advertised t:'o.e fact that the :vrorse Telegraph system furnished news of the nation. In this colun1n the following: interesting account of a railroad ac-cident was found. \RAILROAD AIOCI D•ENT. \Last evening the train on .the Worcester and ::--J ash au oRIR., when near the Groton Junction, came in contact with a horse on the rails and was in conse,quence thrown off the tracks and the engine and tender precip-itated down the em- bankment. !The E.ngineer was thrown over a fence some distan·ce into a meadow, and the Fire- Inan buried beneath the ruins of tL-: tender, but neither of them was fatally injured. 'The first class passenger .car was considerably damaged but none of the passen~ers hurt. \Nas11ua N. H., .J·uly 3.\ Of eourse the Morning !Star was different fro:n the modern daily in many noticeable respects, but perhaps the most striking difference was the phraseology and newspaper sty1e that was m·uch more prolix in the paper of the fifties. This .fact is evtdent in the account of a storm at 'lVIilwau- kee, whi·ch was cop :ed from the 1Milwaukee !Senti- nel by the Morni:ng •Star. 'The account came under the general head of \NiEIW\S FHJOM T1HE. WEI3'T.\ An extract -of the account is quoted below: \·GREAT STORM AT MILW·AUKEE . • ''Our city was visited early yesterday morning \\: ith one of the severest storms we ever remem- ber to have seen. There had ·been one or :two showers attended with thunder and lightening during the night; but the sun rose clear, with promise of a fair day. Between 6 and 7 o'clock ' however, the storm ·can1e up in all its wrath and magn'ficence and for 2 'hours :tD.e rain de- scended, the wind blew, and the lightening flashed and the thunder roared with scarcely a morr.ent's intermission. At tilnes the blast was like a tornado and the rain ca1ne down in perfect floods .......... . · .Ju:;e 28, M'ilwaukee Sentinel.'' The Poem. At he head of the sec-ond page of .the ·Morning Star appeared the poem \By a Freshman,\ as it is signed. The poem is not completed in t'hat issue ·of the 1Star and for that reason, perhaps, the poet;s name ~s not given. But 1figuring on the four year course that has always been in vogue at Un:ion the writer was a member of the class of 185 8. The poem as it appeared in the ·:paper follows: \For the Morning Star \REVERI·ES OF THE '.COLLEG·E GARDEN.'\ \By a Freshman. \Oh 'h-ere's .a fairy spot to dream- Wnere earth and all its sorrows seem I.ike griefs which once our soul came o'er. But call for sighs and tears no more ' Or as the .things of time might rise 'To greet a soul in Paradise Here, ·on this grassy bank reclined ~· '

D., ()if the class of 184·6. He was vvid~ly known a.s a phHanthrotpist, devoting his later life entirely to deeds of benevolence. He was a resident of Cohoes,. N. Y., and made many charita,ble gifts to instituUol'ls of that etty. He was a :nost loyal son of Union, never ceasing in his kindly .con·cern for all that affected tbe col- lege. He proved this loyalty fby his gift 0f the tChristian Association ~building which ib-ear.s his ' name. He also instituted the SillimaR scb:olar- f)h~l}S, consisting of four scholarslhi 1 PS from the income of six: thousand dollars. - He was one of the most noted business men and philanthro- 'pists of this section, alway$ taking care to give his money where it would do the m.ost go·od, but never refusing what he deemed a worthy- cause.

Like that whic:h thrills t'he drowsy air \Vhen .Syrinx shakes her leafy haJ.r ,- And low and sweet as whispered strain That love brings back to love again! L~o-these ~be herald winds that sing- Whom flowers have sent to greet their king,. And they are lovers of t'he ·flowers Which soothe with song their sum:a1er hours You'll see one's airy arms enclose \iV:th tender care the tear.ful rose; As tears and blushes dim her face, If Eun1s shock with rude embrace- He dries her tears, and lulls her rest, And rocks her cradled on his breast, And now around they gen Hy press, And cool my brow with Ught caress, And swing ·with their air censers, filled Wi.th sweet aroma, erst distilled From soft-eyed fiow·ers, wilose fragrant breath Yields not its incense e'en in death. \To be continued. \June .2d, 1855.\ ------·---------· --~ -- -------- m --· - ~ . ~nton tiops: I The best paper for your correspondence is C[rancs' ILinen lla\ttn We have it in Club Size, Embossed in UnionSeal Garnet and Gold.
