We are glad to learn now that Mr. McElroy is about to devote his time exclusively to the lecture field ; having severed his connection with the New York Tribzttte, where he has done editorial ·work since r 882. Mr. McElroy vvas born in Albany, N. Y.; and received his preparatory education at the famous Albany academy; fron1 vvhich school he passed to Union, graduating frotn her \Valls in I 86o. He \vas associated later \Vith Charles Emory Smith, late minister to Russia,- another Union man-in the editorship of the Albany Yournal. While in this capacity, Mr. McElroy becan1e well knO\Vl1 as a versa- tile writer, with a pen-dipped in racy h urn or and satire, as well as in good common sense, and it \vas at this time that his satire of the splurgy weddings of the day, ·which purported , to be an account of the tnarriage of the daughter of a Brazilian diamond king to a young A1nerican, brought l1im into the notice of such eminent men as Edward Everett Hale, George William Curtis and Edt11und Clarence Stedn1an. Later his \:Contribution to the :conscience Fund,\ in the Old.a1td Nezv, and ''An Old War Horse to a Young Politi- cian,\ in the A tla1;ztic MoJZth!y, added to his renown as a droll and satirieal '\vriter.

But Mr. McElroy did not confine hitnself to that style of writing. A story called \Matthew Middlemas' Experiment,\ that appeared in the N evv York Tribune, was an inspiring exhortation to ·Christian help- fulness, and has done effective ·\vork in that line in many communities.

In five more min- utes Lavery scored another touch-down by a good run around the end, being admirably • guarded by Gregory and Wescott. Before the end of the first half Gregory and Lavery each scored another touch-dovvn, and Wescott failed in both trys for goal. The second half \Yas opened with three · more men on the scrub, Johnston, Nellis and Cass. The ball passed back and forth from 'varsity to scrub for t\venty n1inutes, splendid work being done by J3ranJan, Cooper and : Burlingame. Finally Gregory scored another touch-down, and Myers kicked a goal. In spite of evident defeat the scrub continued to play a sharp game and before time \vas called succeeded in scoring one touch-do\vn by Cooper. Gregory of the scrub failed in his try for goal. When time was called the score stood 26- 4 in favor of the 'varsity. hundred Union rnen. Mr. Thompson acted as referee, and Mr. Farrell as umpire. The gatne \vas called at 3:5 5 P.

His father also . learning. received his education at that institution. What are colleges for if they are not to give young OUR LECTURE COURSE. The following clippings from the New York Advertiser and Albany Arg-us explain them- selves: THE SCHENECTADY .PLAN. Union College deserves crc:dit in endeavoring tore- gain the ancient honor she enjoyed before bad man- agement discredited that institution, but a serious blunder has been made in sandwiching in its winter lecture course a number of people more notorious than celebrated. It is a palpable bid for newspaper notoriety and is reprehensible as a precedent. Hitherto the campus of the American university has been the one place that buncombe and pretense found uncongenial, and to which they were not admitted. Clever politicians and charlatans in all walks of life can buy or work their way into art, church and society, but the cultivated groves of learn- ing have hitherto been sealed to them. The journalists and several other speakers on the list who are educated men, or who have a worthy and dignified mission to the young men at Schenectady, will do and receive honor. lVfr. Wanamaker and Mr. Carnegie, for instance, will doubtless prove interest- ing contributors t,1 the course; but the men tempo- rarily before the public, silver cranks, rush-light statesmen, are patently summoned as curiosities to draw a crowd. Mr. Croker is fully as eligible to lecture at Union College as Mr. Bourke Cockran; in- deed, what the former might say about the political system would be of cardinal moment. The Schenectady Plan is cheap business. More than one magazine has lost caste and influence by seeking conspicuous instead of able contributors to its pages. Union College is doing what it can to jus- tify the British criticism that American life in all its ramifications is a mass of shan1s.-[N. Y. Adrz;ertiser. THE UNION COLLEGE PLAN. Union college has been singled out for criticisn1 by a contemporary because it has secured as lecturers men a liberal education? And how is a liberal educa- tion to be obtained if liberal 1neans are not used to secure it? Young meR of normal intellect cannot be mentally or moraUy contaminated by listening to the discourse of an unsound thinker. The New York ComJ7zercz'al Advertiser, whose criticis1ns we have in 1nind, sHmrnarizes its complaint in these words: ''The Schenectady plan is cheap business.\ That is a cheap criticis,m. Moreover, it is unjust. The Schenectady plan is a wise one. The effect will be wholesome. Its students will gain an insight into men and affairs they would not otherwise gain, except in.actual every-day business and political life. They w1ll not be \half-baked cubs\ when graduated. They will be made to think on practical questions in college, and the training will be invaluable out of college. If, in praising ·the Schenectady plan, we may use a term in contradistinction to the one used by the Advertiser, we would say that it is dear, ex- clusively dear.-[Alba1zy A rgtts.

THE CONCORDIENSIS. LECTURE ON JOURNALISM. DELIVERED BY MR. DANA TO THE STUDENTS OF UNIO:N COtLEGE. The First of the Fall Series in the Butterfield Course De- livered on Friday Afternoon, Oct. 13 -The Value of Education to a Newspaper Man-The Best Books to Read and the Best Languages to Study- The Importance of Accurate Reporting- Qualifications that the Successful Edi- tor and Reporter Must Possess-The Great Sco.pe of News Gathering in Modern Times. A full audience was present in the chapel of the college, including President W cbster, several men1bers of the faculty, and students of all the classes, as well as a number of ladies. Mr. Dana, having been introduced by Gen. Butterfield, spoke, in part, as follo\vs : MR. PRESIDENT, GEN. BUTTERFIELD, AND GENTLE- MEN: I am intensely gtateful to Gen. Butterfield and President Webster for the opportunity of appearing before yon to-day. If there is anything in life that is delightful to an old man, it is the opportunity of meet- ing intelligent and earnest young tnen, and telling them something out of his experience that may be useful to them. The profession of journalism is. comparatively new. It really is, as it exists to-day, an affair of the last forty or fifty years. When I began to practise it on a weekly paper the apparatus which vve have now, and which Gen. Butterfield has referred to, was quite unknown. Of course, the most essential part of this great mechanism is not the mechanism itself; it is the in- telligence, the brains, and the sense of truth and honor that reside in the men who conduct it and make it a vehicle of usefulness- or it n1ay be of mischief; be- cause what is useful can just as easily be turned to mischief if the engineer who stands behind and lets on the steam is of an erroneous disposition. The number oi intellectual young men who are looking at this new profession, which for the want of a better name we call the profession of journalism, is very great. The boys who begin at the bottom come out at the top. At the same time these boys do not all start out with the best outfit, that is to say, with the best education; and I have known very distin· guished authorities who doubted whether high edu- cation was of any great use to a journalist. Horace Greeley told me several times that the real newspaper man was the boy who had slept on newspapers and ate ink. Although I served him for years and we were very near in our personal relations, I think he always had a little grudge agailist me because I came up through a college. In regard to this profession there are two stages, and we will consider each of them separately. The first is the stage of preparation. \Vhat sort of prepa- ration, what sort ·of preliminary education should a man have who means to devote hin1self to this busi- ness? There are son1e colleges which have lately introduced schools of journalism or departments of journalism, where they propose to teach the art of newspaper making, to instruct the student in the 1nethods that he should employ, and to fit him out so that he can go to a newspaper office and 1nake a newspaper. There has been one at Cornell University for several years, for six or eight years I should say, and I have never found that a student or graduate who had pur .. sued that department there instead of pursuing other studies, was of any great avail as a practical worker in the newspaper \vork that he had been trying to learn. Now, as for the preliminary studies of the journalist apart from the ancient languages, whose importance, I think, cannot be over-estimated. Certainly, without Greek and Latin no man knows English ; and without Teutonic no n1an's knowledge of English is perfect. # After a knowledge of the English language comes, of course, in regular order, the practice, the cultiva- tion of the ability to use it, the development of that art which in its latest forn1 we call style, and which distingui~hes one writer from another. This style is something of such evanescent, intangible nature that it is difficult to tell in what it consists. I suppose it is in the combination of in1agination and humor, with the entire command of the ·word-resources of the language, all applied together in the construction of sentences. I suppose that is what 1nakes style. It is a very precious gift, but it is not a gift that can always be acquired by practice or by study. The next thing that I vvould dwell upon would be the knowledge of politics, and especially of American politics. This is a very hard subject. Its history is difficult. If you go back to the foundation of the republic, you find it vvas extremely complicated even then; and it requires very careful study and a very elevated impartiality to tnake your analysis at all satisfactory to yourself as you go through the work. In order to be of importance in the affairs of this world in the newspaper profession, you mu5t be a politician, and you n1ust know not merely the recon- dite part of politics, but you must know practical politics, the history, the men, the individuals, their ideas, their purposes, and their deeds ; know the1n if you can as they really are, not as the blind and the prejudiced may imagine them to be. In order to understand the theory of the American

8 THE CONCORDIENSIS. Governn1ent, the mos~ serious, cahn, persistent stucly should be gi,'en to the Constitution of the United States. The modern newspaper, however, is not confined to any neighborhood or to any country. You have got to look beyond yohtr own land; you have got to study . the history of every European country. You must know, first ·of all, the history of England. We catne ' from England; the Am·erican Constitution is Tooted . in English principles and in English history. You want to know ·where it started from. 'I'he next point to be attended to is this : What books ought you to read? There are some books that are indispensable, a few books. Altnost all books have their use, even the silly ones, and an omnivor- ous reader, if he reads intelligently, need never feel . that his time is wasted even when he bestows it on the flimsiest trash that is printed ; but there are some books that are absolutely indispensable to the kind of education that we are contetnplating, and to the pro- fession that we are considering; and of all these the n1ost indispensable, the most useful,. the one whose knowledge is n1ost effective, is the Bible. There is no book from which more valuable lessons can be learned. I an1 considering it now not as a religious book, but as a manual of utility, of professional prepa- ration, and professional nse for a journalist. There is perhaps no book whose style is more suggestive and more instructive, frmn which you learn nwre directly that sublime simplicity which never exaggerates, which recounts the greatest event with solemnity, of course, but without sentimentality or affectation, none which you open with such confidence and lay down with such reverence ; there is no book like the Bible. When you get into a controversy and want exactly the right answer, when you are looking for an-expression, what is there that closes a dispute like a verse from the Bible? \Vhat is it that sets up the right principle for you, which pleads for a policy, for a cause, so much as the right passage of Holy Scripture? When I advise you to n1ake yourselves fa1niliar with these glories of English literature, I do not say that these writers ought to be taken as models· Do not take any model. Every 1nan has his own natural style, and the thing to do is tG develop it into sitn- plicity and clearness. Let every man write his own style, taking care only not to be led into any affecta- tion, but to be perfectly clear, perfectly simple, or, in other words, to follow the honored and noble traditions of Union College. That is all that it seems to me necessary to say with regard to the studies and the ed-ucation of the journa- list. Now, let us turn· to the practice of this profession. One of the parts of the newspaper profession which employs the greatest number of 1nen, and I n1ay also say the greatest amount of talent, is the business of reporting. He must learn accurately the facts, and he must state then1 exacti y as they are ; and if he can state them with a little degree 0£ life, a little approach to eloquence, or a litHe ht1:n1or in his style, -why, his report will be perfect. ~t must be accurate; it must be free from affectation.; it 1nust be well set forth, so that there shaU not be any doubt as to any part or detail of it ; and then i£ it is enlivened witn i·magina- tion, or with feeling, o1· with hun1or,. why, you have got a 1i terary product tba t no one need be ashamed of. Next to the reporter, a very important functionary in the newspaper is the man who Teads. the other newspapers and n1akes extracts.from them. He has to read, we will say, three thousand papers regularly. He has to know what it is that should be taken from them and put into his ·paper. What is the interesting story? It requires judgment to know this ; it requires knowledge and expedence as well as talent It is a hard duty, but he has lots of amusen1ent, a1:rd he is very well paid. So he 1~s happy. Then finally you come to the editor-in-chief, and he is always a man who gets into his place by a natural process -of selection. He comes there becanse he can do the work, and I have known some young n1.en who had no idea that they would ever have conb'ol of a newspaper, \vho have risen to that place, and who have filled it with wisdom and success and force. Yet at the bottom of it ali, it is always a questiou of char- acter, as well as of talent. It is in the character, and people believe in him, because they are sure he does not mean to say anything that is not so. Gentlemen, I am gxeatly indebted to you for your kit:d attention, and I bid you farewell ! BICYCLE CLUB.

The game of foot ball at Ithaca, between Union and Cornell, on Saturday, Octoo.er 14, • resulted rnore favorablY. for the ·wearers of:, · the garnet than was even hoped for thev be- · . ' .. ing defeated by a score of but 16 to 6. Throughout the game the individual work of· Union's men was far superior to that of their . opponents and with more coaching the teatn · \vould have given Cornell a good hustle to win. There was a large attendance at the game and the Union tean1 \vere applauded as they carne on the field. The day was fine, but windy, and the ground \Vas soft after an aU night's rain. At three o'clock the opposing tean1s took their places at the centre of the .field and a very decided contrast was noted in the \veigh t of the two teams. Cornell's centre, a giant weighing two hundred and twenty pounds, standing head and shoulders above S\veet- land, Union's one hundred and eighty pounder. The rest of the tean1 \vas correspondingly heavier. In the first half Union worked the sliding wedge several times verv effective! v and .. .. Gregory and Lavery rnade fine gains both through the centre and around the ends. At the close of the .first half the score stood six- teen to six. In the second half the teams played in Cornell's territory tnost of the titne, Cornell failing- to work Union up the field. Neither side scored in this half and tin1e \vas called with the ball still in Cornell's territory. Brilliant plays \Vere n1ade for Union by Gregory, Lavery, Ball and Myers.

When the Union tean1 reached Weston field at Willian1stown, last Wednesday after- noon, Captain Ide introduced to Captain Gregory, 'C. F. Seeley, gyrnnasiun1 instructor at vVilliams, and ratnarked that it ·was custotnary for Mr. Seeley to referee all gan1es on their grounds. This, vvith the intentional kick given Smith on . his lan1e ankle, very materiaHy aided Willian1s to \Vin the gan1e. The men at Williams have not forgotten the defeat they suffered in track athletics at the hands ofthe Union rnen and they did every- thing in their power, fair and unfair, aided by the referee, to win the gatne. .. Union \VOn the toss and took the ball at the centre of the field and advanced thirteen yards on the sliding wedge. After a few slight gains the ball vvas lost to Williams on a futnble and Sawtell dashed through be- tween left tackle and guard and made a sprint of twenty-five yards toward Union's goal. At this stage of the game the ball \vas fun1bled back and forth several tin1es. Stnith \vas laid up by an intentional kick and Pol- lock \Vas substituted in his place. DeGroat and Jeffreys now n1ade large gains forcing the ball do\\11 to Union's five yard line \vhen Union held their opponents for four downs and secured the ball.
