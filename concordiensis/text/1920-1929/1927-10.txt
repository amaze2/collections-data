Watel' has caused the rise of some parts of the world and the decay of others for it is essential to every phase of !\Ian's complicated existence. Even until today there has been a constant struggle for large supplies of good water. Just now there is being fought in Owen's Valley a gig-antic watel' battle and it htL!:i been :shown that one of ou1· large westem cities is defin- itely limited in growth by the wate1· supply. This locality is peculiul'!y fortunate in having an abundant natuml supply of pure water. Yet the1·e are certain water problem.s to be found on our campus. Water is often used fm· purposes of clean- liness. Cleanliness is held to be next to God- liness. The1·e is, however, some difficulty il1 following this p1·ecept here. The great majority of students find it to their liking to indulge in a shower in the g;vmnasium after exercising or befm·e going into the pooL The averag~ .student tries to take his showe1· in the fresh- man shower room. He is handicapped befor~ he enters. There are plenty of showers but the numl'ler of them in working order is alughable. Th-ree of them give forth a fairly strong stream of hot water; one of them supplies a good spray of cold water. Yet we have seen ten and fifteen men tl'ying to get clean with the three showers. Why do not the others also work? The varsity showers are in fairlr decent shap·; but it scarcely occurs to the general run of undergraduates to intt·ude in the vm·sity shower room. For the main body of students there are now insuffic;ient shower accommodations. Is this economy on the part of the college? If it is, let there be a shower tax so that all will stand a chai1ce .of being cleansed when thw enter the shower room. Water is occasionally used for drinking.

There are, lwwL'YL'r, numy j>L'l>JllL' who du not beLieve that the old customs should be abolished. They are, tl}('ordicully, ~uppmwtl to ban· till' right to express their opinion. Fred A. Learma.n, ex-editor-in-chief of the Henssdal'r Polytechnic, was one of those who favored hazing. Learman 'ivrote and publi~hed in the Polytechnie an editorial opposing Ricketts' action and calling on the alumni to su.pport him in a campaign to preserve the \fine and noble traditions.\ The head of the ~nstitute thereupon expelled Learmnn, a harsh· enough measm·e in itsl'lf.

Inwstigation by impartial parties is :slowly indicating that tlw din•d.ot· has !->l-ooped to base and unfair llJPans to hack up his t·dict, has bol- stered -up his ea~t· with paradoxical reasoning, and has attemph·d to ob>-<'lll'P the rL'al fads of thl' con- troversy,' Palmer C.

THE ROVER BOYS. ----0·---- Engineering Course Gets New Equipment The Civil Engineering Department . has been very fortunate this year in obtaining much new equipment, the most important of which is concerned with the testing of gas engines. This division of the .college has been grow- ing very substantially during the last few years, ;md its equipment has been growing to keep pace with it, so that it is now one of the best outfitteq de- par,tments in th~ country. There are several changes in ·the college heating ,plant in the heat en- gines laboratory so that effi~ienc:v · tests ean be made .by the students· on the plant. The equipment which is being in- stalled for the testing of gas engines is .some of the most interesting ma- terial which the department hu in its possession and is tl'le m0st up to date and complete apparatus of its kind ob- tainable today.

E. Draper', '97, asks are consi-del'ed here. In his lettel' 1\Ir. Draper asked H t!lere is not . ., ;.. some JJlace where the literary talei!t of the col- leg.e expresses itself. The only oilservable me- dimus of expression appea.r to ;b-e the Alumni 1\Ionth:ly, which prints now and t!Lea a short ar:. ticle written by an m1dergradmate on some topic pertinent to the colleg-e; lrhe Concordi- ensis, which is attempting to p1•e:serve some of the students' lightet· efforts; and two courses catalogued as English 9 and EngiHsh 12. l\lr. Draper wishes to know if it is possible that the Union of today with SOO,:students lacks the lii:erary talent that abounde<l he1·e in th~ '90's when there were only 2:>0 students. Such a thing seems not only possible :but probable. The Cnion student of to<la~r. if .J\. e expresses himsdf, d.oes not do so on paper.. 'The number .of undergmduatc articles possessi.ng true lit- erary m~rit are few and far I:Jetvveen, they are not a:ppaeent, if they even_ exist. \Thin it over,\ says l\1r. Draper. Thinking it ovel', it \vould seem that The Parthenon was revived because thet·e was need :for it, because undenrraduates a.t that time :were writing worthwhile, interesting articles. Today, how- ever, undergraduates are not inte·r:ested in pro- ducing wi-th the pen. They are JIJ.ore concerned with other aspects of college. 'Tlaere are a few cynics who insinmtte that the stuc::!ent body has not the ability to write. But if .tl!e students were interested in writing doubtless they could and would create many 1n.eritorious lit- erary .compositions, lt has become the fad a.mong ll1.any colleges to pulJiish anthologies nnd·collecti.,Jts of student pmse RlHl :Jo.•try.

Even a fool can be .detent .and perhaps the foolishly wise might accomplish at leas't as. mnch as those who do not lay chdm ,to a·ny wisdom, foolish or otherwise, Even the fact that ~hapel is compt~lsory does not allow exemption from decency, but s1td! see:m.s to be the· interpretation of certain of last year's freshmen. Just sit near some of these srcond year men and listen,, if you can, to the ·scrl'icc, but niorc like'Fy to the ,pan·de- monium of sophomore intelligence, intcrs;~ersed with, a boxing match and a tug-of-war or •bttcbng ·contesL Certainly corhmon decency is in 0rdcr for al'l occa- sions, and decency demands at le·ast respect for .the persons leading the chapel service and' respect for the cha,pel as a religious edifice. At least <JUr foolishly wise students might confine their outbursts of sophomore wisdom to classes and try kee,ping stili 111 chapel; It is even possible that in so doing they might glean a little real wisdom. * * * Union College has an ·organiz-a·t,i<Jn known as the Interfraternity Coundl, and the members of this council in the dim and distant .pa_st, ~IPsiring on occasions to dance without undue interference, passed a ruling, sub- scribed to by the fraternities represC\nted sbting that underclassmen were not incl\Jded in the cust01miry dance invitations exchanged .between fraternities. This ruling has been remarkably dtecti\'e .. lt is observved' by practically everyone but the undcrcla~men. It would appea:r from a visit to the dances this faU that .underclassmen· don't exist as such. Apparently they have voted themselves upperclassmen. Perhaps they do not understand what the Interfraternity C'ouncil meant by underclassmen. \Ve are in:fonrted, on good' authority, that the council meant sophomores and freshmen when it refe.ned to underdassmcn. This underclassmen exclusion act was passed not for the purpose of discriminating against any particular group but because experience has shown that it is im- possible for more than one couple to dance on a- given space at a given time, and the avaibble space in fraternity houses -has a definite limit. Accordidgly it appeared reasonable to this I ntcrf.ratcmity Council that the nppcrclassmen should have first .mortgage on the available space. Now all the upperclassmen have to do is to try to get a little available space and then try to keep it from im·asion by underclassmen. As we stated this exclusion act -was .passed in the dim and distant past. Periodically it is recalled to mind by ·firm declarations of intentions to ·enforce it. One of these periodical times was last spring. \Vhat won- derful success has been attained! * * * * ST •. iREGIS PHARMACY Charles ·R. Carey, P~oP•· 600 Union St. Pho'!le OsiiO. DEMPSEY'S.
