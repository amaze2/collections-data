I~t is being · published because il offers a con~tructive criticism about Union. . .athletic spirit. A. J. G. was both an athlete and distinguished· .student while at Union. His letter will be of in.ter,est.: '''To the Sports Editor of The Conco:rdien·sis: ... \Though the :writer believes himself to be too recent a gradu-! -~ . · ate to be called an 'old a1um).las', he would: like to make. a: . suggestion, which, if it were .carried thru, might be ef consider- · . able adva,n.tage to U nio:n athletic teams in many ways. The· writer js at present ~employed and. living in a town o.f about the' same size as Schen.ectady, which. mothers a college of approxi~ rnately the same size and high standing as Union College. This,·· coiJ:lege, up until the present season, had won but ·a single football' , . game in three yeairs ; but this y·~al\ a new young coach was ac- • .· · qui red, a recent; well known All-.American back, and several new • · featuref3 inaugqra:ted. As a :r~su:lt tl~e team has split on its · .season, w-inning four games al).d losing the same mimber. One • ·of the innovations was the ac:qui:sition of a 'Varsity House' •· · and this is the feature which I -,believe could well be effected at .· Union. A campaign was u:nderta.ken to raise funds to start the . • House; some money was appro:pTiated by the college, some by: the Athletic Board, and some xacised by a small popular sub-' .scription among alumni. An exhibition football game between.· . th.e freshman team and a well known local semi-pro team was a1so arranged and the entire proceeds turned over to the 'Varsity House'. ·COMBINES TROPHY ROOM, TUCK SHOP, COLLEGE UNION \The function of the Uouse is that of a baining house f<n·. athletes and an open house for those interested in a.thletics. Training tables are kept for aU varsity teams and good clnb rooms for the relaxation of the men. The upper floor of the house is used -flS. ·cenference l'ODIDs, skull practice rooms, and libraries. All the college athletic trophies and pictures are on exhibition on the first floor ( nc.l hid in an inconspicuous corner _of the gym where one must beg or steal a key to look at them) :and a general athletic club atmosphere prevails. \The system has worked very well her~ and has met with great favor by both the athletes and non-athletes. One can drop in any evening and find a group of men talking football, discussing past performances, and future pTospects. It is a · common ground for all the fraternity men and a great deal of real good college spirit has been fostered thru tbese frequent 'st>ssions'. At Union it would in a way combine the features· of the Trophy room, the Tuek Shop, and {lie College Union all in one. 1! believe it is a ·well known fact that the College Union has never performed its proper function-it is more of a combination pool room and side-arm lunch than a college man's 'Union'. If my readers do not a.gree, let them compare it with t.he Unions maintained at other colleges-. -the atmosphere of re- finement and gentlemanly condact is so enti1~ely absent from its gray old walls that many Union students never go near it. \If any amount of opiniom could be stirred up among the students, I believe that· the T~rrace Council could take some definite steps, or at least look into the matter carefully. The government of the House could -w·ell be taken care of by a Board of Governors elected from the :Faculty and Student Bodv. - u \A nominal annual due might be charged for membership to the elub to heip defray r,entaJl expenses and training tables maintained in the same manner that they have been in the past-.-either by a contract .system or by the method in which any of the fraternities are ope11ated. \I would like to see some eomment, either editorial or other- wise, on this question, as to j1ust why it wouldn't work at Union. \A.

The reason given by the athletic councii i~ that the coaches have fmmd that in most cases the election of a cap- tain puts a man ,in the honored position who is not fit to 'lead. To sa:.ve such embarassing situations in the future, the captain will be elected · at the end of the season, and a tempora-ry captain appointed before~ every game by the coach. Undoubtedly the system prevalent at Car--' negic 'fech and many other such institutions makes such actwn as that taken by Carneg-ie imperative if the honor attached to the position of captain is to be n1aintained. ·. At Union, however, the election of captain is done by open baH<Jt, and the manager wl\o presides over the election without the privilt\ge of voting, makes a full report of the vote. As a res uH, the best :m.an on the team is usually selected to lead his teammates the followinr season. Edward Finegan has demonstrated his fitness to be field general of the Gafllc-t football team, and Henry Rathmann he>.s ;vLso shown that he was qualified to be captain of the cross-country team. Both men are ·cool 11nder the fire of competition, both arc experience~l, both have the respect of their t~ammates, and both have earned their loyalty. As long as such men are elected, the system used at Uni·on will not be changed, ILLINOIS CODIFIES A UNION TRADITION _It is interesting to many l'nion men how other co'ilcges arc slowly wakmg up to tl1e f:tct that gentlemanly conduct shot1ld extend to all places and at all time, even to the athletic field and under the most exciting mom.ents of the game. For a long time L'nion has had a traditioN. abollt the conduct o£ the undergraduates and alumni at ath- letic contests of all kinds that has aroused the deep respect of IJ:c 1 · · rivals. This traditiorr has never bcen made a written law, yet it has been followed out year after year with but rare exception.

UPSTAIRS O:ne has but to saunter into the aforementioned College Union any time of the day or early evening and the connection is ob- vious. lt requires no stretch of the imagination to fancy that one is in a Broadway or Front street pool room, or a similar dive in any other low quarter of Schenectady. Tl1e men who frequent and SJlcnd most of their time in this place are lacking in culture. The}' ltaYe no idea of it nor do they wish to acquire it. The con- versiott of the College Union into a \Varsity House,\ with all its ben.efits, would not change the nature of the frequenters. These men do not know how to use such a place and their pres- ence ba.rs the ones who would gather the fruits of such a build- mg.

Union at present can hardly follow this code. be .co Iisiclered an enlightening institution. Too many students are drmvn from the neighboring vicinity. Most of these men :v,ttend classes and then leave the campus until the next day's first clttss. The individual either adds to or detracts from the college. These men add nothing. The more we recruit om stu- dent hocly from men wh@ bring no personal traditions with. them, the more will we ignore the traditions of the college. L(!at·ning and culture are not to be adulterated so that any mind. whatsoever can grasp them. Because a person is a good student, it does not of necessity follow that he be cultured. We haYe too many \student pool room sharks.\ ]f ()Ur new presiden:t, then, is to succeed in his task of mak- ing Union one of the best colleges in the East, he should not overlook what rnany consider the primary perversion wh:ich exists here. Colleges may be eleemosynary institutions, but in the field of calbue Union can hardly be considered othe1·wise than sus- cipient. The first step in making this one of the leading colleges is to bring about a:, reform in the class of 'students admitted. R.W.B.

Tho'>e of us who have found it necessary to cram on the eve of an examination will now have sufficient time to absorb some small portion of the matter which we saw fit to pass up during the semester, This feature may seem to those better prepared an unnecessary lengthening of the examination period. Last sem- ester the period covered eight days. Now, even with the elimi- nation of afternoons, it comprises only three more days. In 1·educing the excessive tension of the period, the new policy will be advantageous to all. S. V. S.
