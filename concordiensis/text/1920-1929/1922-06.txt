You will find the campus more charming than ever before; you will find a greater body of your fellow-alumni back than have been 11ere in years. There will be an alumni parade, and class din- ners, a baseball game and a senior ball; but we trust you will find more than that-we hope that you will find t1rre .spirit of the undttr- graduate body as fine and loyal as it was in your own day. This is the commencement oi the class oi 1922. ·But in a larger sense it is only the carrying on and the continuance of worthy Union tradition. For these newest ·graduates, th.ere will come a change oi spheres and they will indeed commence a new battLe- .. but the U n- ion spirit and ideal, which they ·have, will continue to carry on. You may call attention .to the 1 proud .pin feathers .and the coniitlent :wings of this class of '22; but you will'be proud that they have th·is Union I ideal. This di-stinctive and undefinable Union spirit is the 'pr·ottdest I i:rlheritance o·f the undergraduate and the most valmible bequest of the 1 alumni.
