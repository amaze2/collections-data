How far does it extend? No one knew before Newton, sitting in his garden, one day in r665, began to speculate. \Why should not the attraction of gravitation reach as far as the moon?\ he asked himself. \And if so, perhaps she is retained in her orbit thereby.\ He began the cal- culation, but overwhelmed by the stupendous result that he foresaw, he had to beg a friend to com- plete it. In Newton's Principia were laid down his famous laws of motion -the basis of all modern engineer- ing~ The universe was proved to be a huge mechanism, the parts of which are held togetner in ac- cordance with the great law of gravitation.
