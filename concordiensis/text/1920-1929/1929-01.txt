The adoption <lf one-year rule, debarring all heshmen from va1·sity athletic competition, was inevitable. Practically all the colleges which Union meets in sports have the freshman one-year rule. Few colleges have employed the one-semester rule which has permitted freshmen he1~e to engage in spring sports. Al- though the one-semester restriction functioned to. some extent as an incentive to first-semester work, it did much to encourage the tramp athlete. The one-year rule places Union on a par with the colleges which are trying to keep college men in college sports. S. V.

Th~y-·will also remember the caustic letters that paured in because of this letter. Welcome to this columnist is the favorable- note from The New Student, which s~ys in its December issue: \It is a healthy sign when a college paper prints a letter with the following sugge$tion (the quotation is from ·The Co'ncordienais): 'There is talk about a $100~()00 football stp.dium for ·Union College. Let me suggest that if that money were used, not for the construction of long .rows of cement seats to. be sat on four afternoons a year, bat :rather for the building and endowing of an adequate library wh.ere live students would . spend their time among live books yea.r in and year nut,< hour after hour, then there would he more reason for -the assurance · that in the future Union College will make its contribution to the welfare and civilization .of our country.'\ The comment was made in a general article entitled \Fervid Pootball\ which reviewed the gmwing indifference of the moder-n undergraduate toward a religioQs brand of football enthusiasm. The editor takes this as a good sign, and believes this indiff~ence is \due to the fact that some students are beginning to .laugh . at those sentimental alumni and students who take football too , seriously.\ VARSITY MEN IN INTRAMURALS The rapid strides int1·amu:ral athletics have taken on. the campus has brought with it some attendant evils that must be . eradicated at once if the principle that lies behind such form ef sport is to remain inta,ct. With so many teams competing, and so many prizes available, there are ma.ny temptations· foJ:\ cer- . tain groups and individuals to enter the intramural eompetiHon exp:r€ssly for the purpose of obt..aining some medallio11. We do not object to this desire for reward. The desire stimulates the competition. But what we do object to is to ha.-ve men who have been on varsity teams, wh() ha. ve competed on varsity teams, who have even scored on varsity teams, but who have not won their U's, compete against the novices that usually form thE.' intramural teams. · -· . Director Bruce has done reinarkably well in fostering the interfraternity sports on the campus. Comparatively~ Union · now has more men taking part in athletics tha-n aJty other -col- lege whose records are available. This interest is due primarily to the fact that the competition has been even with no .group . monopolizing the front position. Tbe intramurals have also . been of great help in discovering new material for varsi-ty teams. To permit varsity men-one who has been on a varsity squad a season or who has taken part in intercdllegiate competition-to compe'te in intramurals is to drive away the raw talent. The rules governing intramural sports should be more strictly ad~ • hered to in order that \athletics for all\ be realized.

They have attempted to show you, in a simple, straightforward way, some of the rea~ons why the Herald Tribune is ~~New York's most interesting newspaper.\ It won its title, not alone because of the Percy Hammonds and the Grantland Rices and the Claire Briggs, bu1 because each department is manned by people who do their jobs fully as well as their more famous veteran associates.

One of the best athletes Union has ever developed, he made a name for himsl£ and his college .on the gridiron.

Is the drttnkenness at these dances so prevalent that the dances have turned to rough, rowdy affairs? And; are the conditions in this respect worse at U n.ion College than they are at any other college or university in America? These are a few of the ql.lestions that occ11r to mind after reading a rather strong article in the January issue of the Alumni .. ~lontkly entitled \College ~ances\. A contributQr who ca1ls himself \Plus and Minus\ h~s written a letter, {published elsewhere); . tQ the editor of The Concordiensis presenting another question · which is Sl.lrely importantr Should such 1.tn article labeling our · college social affairs. as drunken brawls and occasions for yonp.g couples to practice \license:\ in parked automGbiles, be dis- tributed in a publication which reaches every Union alumnus, givmg each one a biased impression of a C()ildhion which has not . even beep suggested to the students?

T() the Edito-r i1\ Ohief o.f The Ooncordie'{lsis: . . We noticed In this month's issue of · 'the .Union Alwmni llfonthly an article .discussing college dances, in which lt ._seemed .to ns that the sketches Of • · •the e-vils at our· dances were exag• ger!l,ted, anti that part of the discus-. . sion itself was out of place. It is ·· rather diffi.eult to decide what the· · Alum11~ Mo1tthly ls d·rivjng 11-t in sev- . eral places. We do not wish to pick . the article .apart because of techni- · caliti($, but we noticed two or three sentences which tempted: us to turn to the logic te:!!;t. The policy of presenting the eX',- . · tremely unfavorable side of the · • • -dances to the alumni wholesale is . questionable. The place to discuss· · the evils and their remedies is on the ·campus, There is but •ittle possible . good t() be obtained from spreading the sad story thrmighout the gradu- · ate .body. Perhaps the alumni are · • changing, but according to tradition and. ·our own slight observ.ations we · Winter models Foot · protection is the first law of health. This shoe re-o pels moisture. Walk-Over 407 State St. ·would not say that the alumni who ··~~~~~~~~~~;;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ are most interested in the dances socially are the ones b) whom to pre~ sent wrongs :for correction. The gen- .· eral tone o:f the dance$ will be regu- lated cl1iefly by the attitude Of the · students, not by that of the alumni. At least we l1ope not. Perhaps tl1ere are too mnnr dances, . but we .fail to find any very &ubstan-= ·. tial reason for this idea as presented · in the .Alu~nni 11-Iontl~ly. As long as :the number is not carried to .extremes, and we do not see that it has been . in most cases thus far, we rather agree with Dean Garis that we lu~ve ·more trust In the devil we 'know than the devil we. don't, even if the campus dances are as tainted as they are pictured. In the event that there are no diversi'ons on the campus, Sche- nectady, Troy, Albany, and interme- diate points are not far removed. There is nQ reason why the Alumni.· Monthly should .so vividly draw the partially imaginary terrors of the ·· campus social life, especially at a time when the faculty committee on student activities has recently taken upon itself the duty of solving the problems connected therewith and has · already taken decisive action. The . more careful regulation of house • parties begun last year is producing ' a change. Such a change must neces- sarily be slow, because it depends · upon the student attitude, but it will be produced by agitation among the undergraduates and not among the alumni. PLus AND MINus. Paul Meng Addresses Students On Chinese Paul Chih Meng, cultured Chinese . scholar who has studied for three years at Columbia University doing graduate work, addressed the \Y\ cabinet Wednesday night at Silliman hall. He spoke on the underlying causes of the present Chinese situ- ation. :M:r. Meng came to this country as· · • a Chinese · . government scholarship student aqd after his three years : work at Columbia ·has acquired a rounded out viewpoint on affairs ()f: . the world He endeavored to tell what Americans can do to help China and what the future of the Christian missions in China is. China, be explained, is undergoing · a metamorphosis at the present time · and a spil'it of nationalism has been · aroused. TlJis has been caused mairily by_ the Chinese \Renaissance'' .· and a spirit of anti-Christian and. · · anti-foreign sentiment is prevailing. This is natural in accordance with .all the principles of nationalism, and · although Cllina is. late with its ex-- . pression of the sentiment, it is one which aln;10st every other country of ~he world has experienced. · He is giving Americans a glimpse of China from a Chinese point of . view, tempered with ~he kno'\vledge 'he has acquired in America.

Union has. a goocl team, a team that has demonstrated on every occasion it appef:tr{;d in public that it can display a brand of basketball that w·iH keep a cl'Owd entertained for a full hour without a .let up. lTnion alumni might help till the gymnasium and provide so:rhl! of that income that is necessary if Union is to outfit its t~ams in the traditional high clas·s style, and; to play teams of .high .calibre which requires proportio.nal guar-- antees. Tomorrow nigh.t Union 1vill play St. Johns, which has lost only one game out of eight. this season. The New Y o:rk team has · tm all star aggreg-ation led by Captain Collins at center; who has • aYeraged about 18 paints per game thus far in t.he eight games he has played in this season. This will undoubtedly .be one of the most outstanding games on the Union schedule. A packed· gymnasium shou]Q \vitness this contest. Talk it up among your friends. M. 1\f. E~ WHERE AR~i: TH;ESE TRAMP ATHLETES? The adoption of the one-year eligibiHty rule may have been · inevitable and perl!aps necessary, but it will without doubt have di·astic effects 011 the sec::ond semester teams. Recalling tl1e . Tosters of these teams for the past few years, one finds. that the freshmen played in:valuable Toles in all branches of sport. In several cases the teams could hardly have functioned with«:>ut the presence of th.e fiTst year m~n, and in other cases. the ftesh- lnen were the backbone o:f the team. Past events seem to indicate that swimming will suffer most from the new rule:,,for this team always has a la1·ge number of freshmen in its r.:anks. When we consider that $Uch men as · Perkins, Taylor, Little, Knight, Orr, Bonnell, Terry, ltyan, and. (~lapp were some o£ the main cogs of the team during· their fi'eshm·ah yea.rs, the resu1t of th:e rule will be seen. Similar · cases in othe1· sports could be cited. IH track we find .Bowie, Sawtelle, Rothinann, Dyke, and Lehman ~tars their first yea.r, not to. mention ot:hei's whose names are not so readily recalled. The hockey team :J1as included as beshmen the :Seale brothers, Henafelt, Kahn, Dtake, Mtrlqueen, and Slattery. The exclusion (Jf the ''tr~mp athlete\ seems to be the point . in favor of the rule. :But how many of. tfie aoove named men ,as well as others such as Potte1•, Ba1~sto1v, E'ngle, and Finegan, played durhtg their freshman year itt lacrosse,, would we tem1 \tramp athl()tes\ And ho1v nH:my itH~n, who. played Qil these same tet~.ms a year and: then left college, can we recall?

Where formerly great expanses o open range were the rule, now the West is dotted with rapidly growing cities and towns, and where one and two~story buildings were ample for the commer- cial needs of these cities, today the tall building is necessary. More and more, as the center of population moves steadily westward, our cities beyond the Mississippi ar~ grow- ing upward, and Otis equipment and Otis service, instantly available anywhere, are doing their part in the vast develop- ment program. All skyscrapers, East .or West, were mac!e possible by· the elevator-and the world's :tits~ safe elevator was an Otis. · .· .. participation in some extra-curricular activity by the under~ 'graduates, the committee rightly saw that a. check must be made ·in the number of major activities a student was identified with in order that the student should not suffer scholastically. This check is as simple as it is effective. Permission must be granted one to take part in two activities during the same calender ·period, un:ess one is a second grade man. That is .as it should be. One not having a second grade average would he unwise to be in two activities at the same time which would drain heavily OM's time that should be spent on studies. Since some students although identified with major activities do not take very active part in them, the faculty committee tecognized the possibility of some men, not on the second grade list, who could take part in two activities without any harm to . · their scholastic work. Again this is as it should be. The rules are a medel for other colleges to follow. STIRRING MUSIC A FACTOR IN GAMES C\ne wonders whether or not the great playing of the Union basketball team in the two games played on the Alumni gvm court has not been in part attributable to the band. The:> ·Union band pepped up the team and spectators at thE> football , games and now it is doing even a better job 8.s the music is more stining because produced indoors. The respect of the . student body and visitors at the games has been won over by the band. In fact many came to the game early just to hear . the band. That extra fee from the students' tax granted the · l1and went for a good· purpose. M. M. E . . WHAT ABOUT MAN-POWER? Just after the athletic department's plea for more cand·idates for Union's teams and the suggestion that one or more sports be dimina ted in order to increase the number reparting for others, there came the new e 1 igihility code which, while it con- tains many improvem~?nts ovet the former regulations, makes freshmen ineligible for varsity sports. Without the support of frosh candidates all second semester sports will find their man- power reduced to its lowest point in years. But even more im ... portant than the absence of freshmen from team line-ups is the 11uestion of training first yeaJ.· men. \What will be done with the frosh during the second sernes,., ter? 'V\lJ1erc wil1 they obtain the training necessary to fit them for varsity work t11eir second year? Will .a full schedule of beshman sports be arranged? Where will the money for such a program be found? The athletic department is handicapped by lack of funds ·now ; it could never stand the added expense of running frosh teams all year. Yet it is evident that unless Union's sports a:re to take a decided slump this money must be raised. Thf:' g:r.eat deficit now is caused by short schedules which put every sport except football in the red and prevent that from sup- . porting other branches as it does in most colleges. If our teams , are to be kept at the standard which they now maintain or if : they are to he improved, which is the aim and hope of all Union men, the faculty activities ·committee must permit longer sched- . ules or devise some other means to combat the handicap the · one-year rule has imposed.

Strange, that this year should have more preeminence than the last of a .. four year course- yet the analogy between the title, junior, and the manifold occupations of that class serves as an explanatic,m of the phe- nomenon. From common experience one learns to assign difficult, but nove' tasks to the more enthusiastic, vital type of person; those, however, who . combine youthful ardor with a grow- ing sense of responsibility and bal- ance. This follows closely the quali- ties attributed to a junior; he is in the intermediate state, between a flippant sophomore and a: \grave sophisticated senior. Thus, the original meaning of the Latin iwvenior has been preserved un- consciously all these centuries in the character of the fel'low students who are \in the flower of their age and youth, older than the adolescents- younger than the seniors.\-Fiat Lew.

Right now men in the Bell System are planting the seeds of vast pos- sibilities for even better communication. Out of the belief that the public needs a broader use of the telephone is grow- ing a constantly improved long distance telephone service. Like the railroads of an earlier day, this service is now tapping and helping to develop rich new terri- tories of commerce.

M. M. E. PROSPECTS GOOD FOR WINNING TEAMS Despite the setbacks which Union's varsity teams have suf- fered ~n their winter schedules so far, indications point to a . vast improvement with many victories after the mid-year vaca- tion. The rather mediocre records which the teams have piled up so far, with the exception of the indoor track and swimming teams, which have yet to open their seasons, may be traced''to tbe lack of a sufficient number of contests affording experience. ·with the addition of promising fi·eshman material, Union can look for an unusually successful windup to its winter sports season. The basketball team, with .five games under its beU when it 'tackles Rensselaer in the first game after the vacation, should have the necessary experience to make things. fast for any team it stacks up against. The play in the last two .games has been of a high standard, and the Garnet seems to be in fo1· anothe1· winning period such as Union basketball teams enjoyed up to t11e last few years. The men which Coach Hardman will draft from the h·osh team will imure a strong squad of substitutes, something which has been sorely needed this year. Indoo1· track will be greatly handicapped by the loss of McMillen and Totten; pnbahly the best consistent point-getters that the Garnet has ever had in indoor track. A fast mile-relay team should go .a long way toward making the season a success, with the individual stars which Coach Bruce has developed. Watch the hockey team. With the addition of three, at least, of the stars of this year's undefeated freshman squad, to the team which has already held the strong Williams sextet to a close score, there should be no stopping them. It is to be :regretted that the Garnet did not schedule Williams and Ham- ilton, two .of our strongest opponents, after the mid-year period. Predictions for Union victories would not be far wrong. 'The swimming team sl10uld win the majority of its meets. W:ith its second year under Coach Lydgate about to start, the men should have had time to thoroughly learn his system- a big thing in any sport. Tl1e squad has a good nucleus for one of tJ1e best teams in many seasons- .. and chances were never bri·ghtcr than this year :lor the Garnet to defeat \-Villiams. Union slwu]d meet its hardest test against N. Y. U., wl1ich has ·been going well this yea1·, l1aving handed Williams, last yea'r's Eastern Intercollegiate d1ampions, a severe setback. R. B. P.~ JR.

Saved By A 'Hairpin Rummaging around thro11gh star- tling incidents which i1ave happened on the Union. campus, we have come across some where tbe students have locked the professor out of the class- room (only in fun o:f Cotll'Se), and others where the students have locked the door of the room fwm outside so that the class had to be postponed, but never have we tumbled on one where the students locked t.hemselv<>s and the professor in the classroom. One hungry student at Syracuse University, according t<1 The Daily Orange 1 was in such a hur.ry to get . out of the room that ,wh.en the bell rang l1e. dashed madly to the door, pulled the knob and the 'vhole thing came off in his hand. Consequently none of the· students or the professor · were able to leave the room until an expert picked the lock w·ith a hair- pin.. The Daily 01·an!Je describes the episode as follows: \The class is dismissed\. There was a mad ntsb for the door. .. Someone, with a vivid vision of beans · ·· before Mm, reached the door first, but p11.lled to(} fiercely on the ]mob, mak- ing his hungry classmates prisoners ..
