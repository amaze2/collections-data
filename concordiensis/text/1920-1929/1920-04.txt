A most interesting story tells of the devices evolved which st:bo stantially aided in solving one of the most pressing problems of the war-the submarine menace. Fanciful, but no less real, were the results attained in radio communication which enabled an aviator to control a fleet of flying battleships, and made possible the sending, without a wire, history-making messages and orders to ships at sea. Scarcely less important was the X-ray tube, specially designed for field hospital 'lSe and a notable contribu tior:. to the military surgical service.And many other products, for both ::orn- batan t and industrial use, did their full share in·securing the Yictory. In the laboratories are employed highly trainedphysicists,chemists, metallurgists and engineers, some of whom are experts of inter- national reputation. These men are working not only to ronvert the resources of Nature to be of service to man, but to increase the usefulness of electricity in every line of endeavor. Their achievements benefit eve1·y individual wherever electricity i3 used, Scientific research works hand in hand with the development of new devices, more efficient apparatus and processes of manufacture.

':;,'~\'ir advantages in pursuits of peace made them of inestimable value in time of war. A most interesting story tells of the devices evolved which scb· stantially aided in solving one of the most pressing problems of the war-the submarine menace. Fanciful, but no less real, were the results attained in radio communication which enabled an aviator to control a fleet of flying battleships, and made possible the sending, without a wire, history-making messages,and orders to ships at sea. Scarcely less important vvas the X-ray tube, specially designed for field hospital •.1se and a notable con tributior:. to the military surgical service. And many other products, for both ~om­ batant and inriustrial use, did their full share in securing the victory. In the laboratories are employed highly trained physicists, chemists, metallurgists and engineers, some of whom are experts of inter- national reputation. These men are working not only to c:mvert the resources of Nature to be of service to man, but to increase the usefulness of electricity in every line of endeavor. Their achievements benefit every individual wherever electricity is used. Scientific research works hand in hand with the development of new devices, more Efficient apparatus and processes of manufacture. It results in the discovery of better and more useful materials and ulti- mately in making happier and more livable the life of all mankind, Booklet, Y-863, describing tlze company's plants, will be mailed upon request.

Y. The Service of an Electrical Research Laboratory The research facilities of the General El<::<:tnc Company are an asset of world-wide impo'ftance. as recent war work has so cleady demonstrated. 'i'b.t:ir advantages in pursuits of peace made them of inestimable value in time of war. A most interesting story tells of the devices evolved which st:.b- stantially aided in solving one of the most pressing problems of the war-the submarine menace. Fanciful, but no less real, were the results attained in radio communication which enabled an aviator to control a fleet of flying battleships, and made possible the sending, without a wire, history-making messages and orders to ships at sea. Scarcely tess important was the X-ray tube, specially designed for field hospital use and a notable contribution to the militarysurgicalservice.And many ether products,£ or both ::om- batant and industrial use, did their full share in securing the Yictory. In the lab~ratories are ?mployed highly trained physicists, chemists, metallurgists and eng:tneers, some of whom are experts of inter- national reputation. These men are working not only to convert the resources of Nature to be of service to man, but to increase the usefulness of electricity in every line of endeavor. Their achievements benefit every-individual wherever electricity is used. Scientific research works hand in hand with the development of new devices, more efficient apparatus and pt:ocesses of manufacture. It results in the discovery of better and more useful materials anJ ulti- mately in making happier and more livable the life of all mankind.

The -..veakness which centered on the third corner has been overcome through the abilities of Bartley and Tracy, both of whom have proved themselves able and willing to look after this last hope of the infield. The outfield has been ·weakened by the loss of Butler, a varsity veteran, but the removal of Gilbert from the pitcher's box to t:.e open country has tended to remedy any existing defects. Reynolds is to be depended upon to gather in the high fliers, and Dean, a freshman. who also shakes a wicked club, is fa~t ronnding into a first class outfielder. Goff is his own steady self in the box, while Holleran is an understudy who can be depended upon to assist in emergencies, although he has a ten- dency to be just a bit wild at times. Captain \Vittner is holding down the catcher's position in an inimitable way, and has an able runner up in Schirrer.
