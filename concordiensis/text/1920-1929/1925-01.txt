If you are interested in learning more about what electricity is doing, write for Reprint No. AR391 con- taining a complete set of these advertisements. GENERAL ELECTRIC WestofDenver is the Continental Divide; hemmed in behind it is an undeveloped district twice as large as Mary land. That fertile area the new Moffat Tunnel will open up. General Electric mine locomotives are carrying out the rock, and G-E motors are driving air compres- sors and pumping water from underground rivers. The conquests of electricity on land and sea, in the air and underground, are making practical the impossibilities of yesterday. It remains only for men of ability to find new things to do tomorrow.

Houses Consider Tax Assessments The Interfraterni·ty council, to- gether wi.th the h.eads of the al.Mmni organizations of the 1 fraternities owning houses on the campus, met in the trophy room of the gymnasium Wed- nesday night to .consider the action of th~ Schenectady city government in pla<;:ing the 10 fraternity houses on the cam- pus on the assessment Est of taxalvle pro·perty. The various angles of the question were discussed at the meeting, but no course of ac- tion which may have been con- templated has bee111 announced. It is expected that most of the fraternities concerned will file protests of the assessment with the city government, as the taxes 1nvo.lved, if paid, will amount to more than $6,000 a year. iDR.

Dr. Richmond stopped off at Syracuse where he told the Men's Club of the Park Central Pres- byterian church in an address Tues- day night that control of power in- stead of further development is the important thilllg in the advance of civilization. He urged for \an application of the brakes\ to the present speed of life and declared that human progress was not measured by a speedometer. \It is not the speed that counts, but VIOlET QUIN.YET IN THIRD liOME GA~ME Hardman's Charges Show Im- provement in Practice After New York Trip HAtRDMAN IS CONFIDENT Visiting Five Expected to play Unusual Form in Offensive Play Dis- The first issue o.f La Voz de Union, the Spanish magazine which is being publhhed by the Centro de Estudios Hispanicos de Union College, is on the campus. This publication! is the first attempt on the part of any coHege in the United States to print a magazine in the Spanish language. The Jan- uary copy has stories and poems in Spanish with translatio11S and com- ments on some o·f the poetry in Eng- lish. The squad has been practicing daily on the temporary rink in Central Park since due to warm weather the private rink has not yet been completed. Coach Gardiner is da:ily superv1s1ng the scrimmage and ironing the rough spots. A comfortable bus is ntorw ll================:.: the direction; not how fast we are going, but where we are going,\ stated Dr. Richmond. Tomorrow night the third ba,ket- ball game of this season to be played on the alumni court will be staged when the New York University squad meets the Union five .at 8 o'clock. The N. Y. U. basketeers come to Schenec- tady with victories over several well- known ag-gr-egatio•ns. But .the Garnet, smarting under the lash of a defeat at the hands of the Crescent A. C. during the Christmas holidays, will put up a mighty battle. The circulation of La Voz de Union is widespread since over 75 C'opies have been -Sent out to universities in this country and in Spain, Fran•ce, Ger- many, Poland, South America, Mexico, the Antilles and the West Indies. The present edition is already out of print. The publication is edited by Andres Araujo, '2'7, editor-in-chief, George A. Collins, '26, president of the Spanish club and Angel Flores, faculty advisor of the organization. Prominent South American and Spanish writ·ers and poets have contributed to this first issue anld following issues wi!J: have articles by as distinguished co·ntribu- tors. Among these are Juana de lbar- bourou, who is the Qutstanding poetess of South America a:nd Juan Ramon Jimenez, one of the most emminenlt living poets of Spain. There are also artic,Jes by Antoniu S. Pederira, professor 'Of Spanish lit- erature and well ktH>Wn poet in the Un~versity of Porto Rico. A phrase of contemporary Spanish-American poetry with translations and introduc- tions by \R.

On the cover which is gray in color is a picture of the library, drawn by Araujn, and the words, \La Voz de Union.\ The staff plans for future issues to change the cover so that various views at11d buildings on the Union campus will be depicted. It is hoped to increase the number of pages and have a section devoted to The Concordiensis with a summary of the news on the . campus for the past month. The publication a.1so htas four pages of advertisements The February issue of \Union's Voice\ will be put out under a much emlarged staff with Andries Araujo as the editor.

On the Freshmen squad are: Johnson, Hartnett, Hyland, SteveiJJs, Stone, and vValker. Manager Long urges that more men try out for the team and he especially desires more student spectators at the scrim- mages. Prominent Scientist To Deliver Lecture On Friday night, January 23, Dr. Edwin Emery Slosson, \Well-known author, editor and scientist, will de- liver a lecture in the chemical labo- ratory of Union college at eight o'clock His topic will be of a sden- ·tific nature wtith the complex and tedmical scientific data presented in the language that everyone can un- derstand. Dr. Slosson is the author of \Cre- ative Chemistry\ and is head of the Scientific News Service in Washing- ton, D. C. This service takes care of most of the news items which ap- pear in the daily papers dealing with scientific achievements. He received his B.S. degree from the University of Kansas in 1890, his master's degree two years later from the s·ame institution and the degree of Ph.D. in 1902 from the University of Chicago. For some time he was professor of chemistry in the Univer- sity of Wyoming'.

SWIMMING lEAM TO OPEN AGAINST N.Y .U. Union Mermen Have Undergone Intensive Training-N.Y.U. Appears Formidable The Union swimming team will open its schedule for the present seas- on against the strong N. Y. U. team tonight at 8 o'clock in the gymnasium pool. The Gamet will oppose the Violet tankmen with a team composed of Captain Brubaker, '25, LeFavour, '25, Parkhurst, '27, Kunze, '25, Mel- dola, '27, Bedell, '27, and Bernson, '26. The events w.ill include the 50, 100, and 220 yard dashes, diving, 100 yard backstroke, 100 yard breaststroke, and a 220 yard relay race. Coach Harry McManus al1!d Captain Brubaker have been putting their men through an in- tensive training and hope to repeat last year's 40'-2'4 victory over the New York mermen, despite the fact that N. Y. U. has a much more formidable team than they ha;d last year. Numerous Orchestras Considered For Prom The Junior Prom committee with \Dick\ Laughlin, '26, as chairman, is hard at work trying to secure an or- chestra for the Prom of the class of 1926, which will be held Friday night, May 15, in the Alumni gymnasium. This night, the Friday of Junior week, has been chosen as the night of the Prom for the last few years with the Moving-up Day exercises following the next morning. The visiting contingent will bring up three first class forwards in KeHy, Ingram, and Captain Hawes. Torrey a111d Cohen have been interchan1ging at the keystone position with equal success, while Handler, Maier, and Hillenbach are excellent guards. The Violet depends on a fast, passing game with every man. co-ordinating in per- fect teamwork The N. Y. U. coach puts most of the stress on offensive play, although defensive formations are not entirely neglected. \The important thing in the ad- vance of civilization is not the devel- opment of power hut the control of it,\ said Dr. Richmond. \Control has never kept pace with power. * * * The most terr.ible humam tragedies, all the way from Cain to the German kaiser, are those caused by the abuse of power-physical power, military, political, ecclesiastical power, the power of superstitution, the power of station and wealth, social power, the power of the press and of propaganda, the power of passion and ambition.

FACTORY PLUMBING CAN CONTRI:BUTE TO EFFICIENCY Supplying dependable valves, fittings and steam specialties that exactly satisfy all pip- ing requirements is only one of the ways Crane Co. serves American industry. Crane provides anotherimportant meansoflow-· eting manufacturing costs in its complete line of factory plum bing fixtures. In many ways this sanitary equipment can be used to bring up efficiency. Toilet rooms and lavatories of ample capacity, placed close to the \popl:llation centers\ of the departments they serve, save many wasted minutes. Enough drinking fountains, con- venient to machines and benches, increase production by shortening the time taken off by workmen in quenching their thirst. Because Crane plumbing materials stand up under ordinary, careless usage, they perpetuate these savings of time. Their upkeep cost is low, their life much longer than could be expected of fixtures made to sell 011 price alone. When you plan plumbing installations, a Crane specialist at the nearest Crane Branch or Sales Office will be glad to help you select the correct type of fixture for each particulal\ requirement. One hundred two Crane branches and offices bring this serv- ice within easy reach of every industrial plant in the United States and Canada.
