Work without Toil Ten or twelve hours a day toils the coolie. If he carries all he cap., he moves one ton one mile in one day. For that he receives twenty cents. Cheap labor! Yet compared with our American worker, receiving at least twenty-five times as much for an eight-hour day, the coolie is expensive labor. In America we move op,e to:J;l one mile for less than one cent. The coelie, working by hand, accomplishes little; while the American, with electricity's aid, accomplishes much.

I shall need your help in finding my way about this vast city; you will have to explain to me a hundred intricacies of your American life, from the best manner of facing a large audience of your compatriots to the best manner of eating your Indian corn, but at least I am as familiar with your elevators as you yourself. Between floors I am at home, for your Otis Elevators are as indispensable to Paris as to Ne-w York, no matter how wide the difference between the two cities.\ Every city, every separate building presents its own problem, which has been solved, in all parts .of the civilized world by the Otis Elevator Company. European cities do not have the high buildings that are constructed in this count1y, and therefore their elevator service is not as• intensive, but Otis eleva.,. tors serve the needs of their business life the same as they do in this countny. The Grands Magasins du Printemps illustrated, is' one of the large department stores of Paris, and contains fifteen Otis Elevators and seven Otis Escalators.
