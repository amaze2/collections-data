We believe that the Athletic Board will have a freshman quintet. The question n<?w arises who will coach this team.

Then he will drill this quintet in his system, the Union system of basketball so that next sason, Union will be able to take several members of the freshman team and place them · n Varsity positions.

EFORE 189 ~ every chemist thought he knew what air is. \A mechanical rnixt1.1re of moistu. re, nitrogen and oxygen, with . traces of hydrogen and carbon diox:ide,\ he would explain. 'fhere was so mucb oxygen and nitrogen in a given sample that he simply determined the amount of oxygen present and assumed the rest to be nitrogen. One great English chemist, Lord Rayleigh, found that the nitro- gen obtained from the air was never so pure as that obtained from sotne compo1:nd like ammonia. What W•as the \impurity\? In co-operation with another prominent chemist, Sir William Ramsay, it was discovered i:J;l an entirely new gas-'\argon.\ Later came the discovery of other rare gases in the atmosphere. The air we breathe contains about a dozen gases and gaseous compounds. 'fhis study of the air is an example of research in pure science. Rayleigh ar:.d Ramsay had no practical end in view-merely the dis- C:Jvery of new facts. N .. few years ago the Research Laboratories of the General Electric Company began to study the destruction of filaments in exhausted lamps in order to ascertain how this happened. It was .i:l purely scientific undertaking. It was found that the filament evaporated -boiled away, like so much water. Pressue v.dl check boiling or evaporation. If the pressure withiri a boiler is very: high, it will take more heat than ordinarily to boil the water. Would a gas under pressure prevent filaments from boiling away? If so, what gas? It must be a gas that. will not combine chemically with the filament. The filament would burn in oxygen; hyd.rogen would conduct the heat away too rapidly. Nitrogen is a useful gas in this case. It does form a few compounds; however. Better still is argon. It forms no compoun¢l.s at all. \Th1:s the modern, efficient, gas-filled larnp appeared, and so argdn, which seemed tte most useless gas in the world, found a praCtical application. Discover new facts, and t..'1.eir pr~ctical application will take care of itself. And the discovery of new facts is the primary purpose of the Research Laboratories of the Gener.al Electric Company. Sometimes years must elapse before the practical application of a discovery becomes apparent, as ·in the case of argon; sometimes a practical application follows from the mue answe:ri.ng of a \theoret- icaJ\ question, as in the case of a gas-filled lamp. But no substantial pxogress can be made unless research is conducted for the purpose of discovering new facts. · . _ Gen lectric General Office any Schedectady, N.Y.

A week from yester- day, the sophomore soiree, our second greatest social function will be staged in the college gymnasium. In the good old days of not so long ago, PROFESSOR JOHN IRA BENNETT would mount the rostrum in the chapel about this time and deliver the above quota- tion.

Y. • Comedy The Sophomore soiree is not a mere dance. Its very name signifies and as the house was supposed .to have just been done over it was slightly =============== more than that. A soiree is an evening and a sophomore soiree is an evening never to be forgotte_n while you remain on earthly soil. It behooves every: Union man who can get a girl, a dinner coat and a few stray greenbacks to attend the soiree. He should attend for two reasons :-first because it is ·a college function and all recognized col- lege functions should be supported and secondly, because he will have the best time o:f his young life if qe does attend. At the soiree music will be heard that is music and harmony, not the slap stick jazz that is dispensed by some orchestras in thes dis- trict. At the soiree, there will be a dazzling array of beautiful girls which alone will repay anyone for attending. But to dance with them-that lifts one from earHily realms. As MASEFIELD once wrote: \Beauty makes a woman like God.\ And for once at least, the English poet dramatist was right. We urge all to attend the soiree primarily for the second reason we have stated. The first will take care of itself. There is no such thing as duty for duty's sake but when duty is combined with ple~­ sure to the nth degree,-how can you lose? We guarantee a good time for all who will go. The committee has arranged a soiree that is expected to surpass the efforts of the past several years. What more can mortal college youth ask? We understand that the sale of tickets so far has been discourag- ing low. We wonder whether the reason for this is that all of the youth here have become pessimists and enemies of pleasure? Don't you want a good time when it is being thrown at you? Remember ·opportunity has not a habit of paying repeated visits to anyone and opportunity for a good time in this city comes very seldon. Now is your chance. Results alone can speak. The result of one who attends the soiree even i:f it must be followed by a sleepless night to make an eight o'clock is be1ter than the scoffer who stayed away and spent an even- ing in boreclom. For one can't be bored with the air ringing with gentle waltzes ancl fox trots, with scintillating beauty on either arm, and with the spirit of good :fellowship always ori hand as it is bound to be mxt Fl'iclay. And i:f ~ou don't go, you will regret to hear that your bestest girl was there with your worstest enemy and smiled all evening. For how can anyone fail to he happy when \Hold Me\ or \The Love's Nest\ is being played as it should be? The soiree wil be a success. Our football season has been called a success. Everything at G nion this year is going to be a success. ina)ilropos at least. Music for dancing was furnished by a victrola.

This i$ the cntribution in imper- ishable riches which the schools and colleges are making every day but do you not see that it is rea11y you who are bound to make it, you boys and girls? I should rather say you do not make the riches of the nation; ymr are the riches and if you do not make the most of the opportunities you have you are not only robbing the nation but you are bobbing yourselves. You remember the parable of the talents? I need only remind you of it. The boy or girl who does JLot use the tal- ent-or the ten talents-that are his will find that when he comes to give an account of himself that he is in outer darkness. No one will need to punish him. He will punish himself / and the judgment will not be postpon- ed to the end of his life. A few years from now he will have the humiliation ing of teams is impossible. But there is one quality that goes for a great deal, and that is the ability to rise to the .occasion when necessary, and when this test is applied we find that the otllsta.nding teams were Princeton, NMre Dame; Pittsburgh, Penn State, CaJiforn:ia, Virginia Military Institute, Boston and Ohio State. They all carme: through, and would be the ones selected to carry a game anywhere. Tl1oeir methods differed largely. Prince- ' toiL had the greatest variety and made the largest use of generalship.

The game was one of the fastest played in the Alumni Gymna- sium in some time. Columbia evident- ly had interpreted the rules slightly different than the Garnet and this fact coup!Jed with the fast pace at which the game was played accounts for the roughness generally in evi- dence and explains the uncluely large number of fouls.
