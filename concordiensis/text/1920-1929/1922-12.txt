Heck, '24 Marcus M. Graubart, '25 Kenneth D. Dean, '25 Tuesday, December 5, 1922 \BULL SESSIONS\ Prior to any attempt at the defamatioa of \bull sessions\ must come the attempt at definition. Any philiolog-ical endeavor at expla- na tioH must encl in failure as researc·h only develops the fact that a bull is either the male o·f the bovine, a paper leter, or a grotesque l)lunder in bng-uage. These terms are not applicable to the common cnnceptic ·n lltHler consiclemtion, ancl perhaps a classic definition is too hig-h a distinction to expect to develop around an American idiom. But if it is too H crculean a task to find the origin oi the phrase, it is a simple matter to localize the origin of the \bull sesison.\ When t\\\O or three iellows are gathered together for the purpose of mutual study and the result is an exchang-e of inconsequentialities,-wel1, that is a \bull session.\ For purpose of discussion it will be agreed then that our subject shalll)e defined as \pointless talk characterized by inconsequence.\ From the prevalence and presistance of the \bull sess·ion\ from a time as distant as the creation of Eve, it may be argued that there I are attendant acl,·antages. These will be meagerly admitted. Such a confabulation may act as an exhaust valve for the release of sur- pins energy, ancl so may introduce or restore a mental condition more conductive to the present undertaking. It may help to pass away a period of restless \\'aiting- and induce tranquillity. And certainly en- I tertainment is g-ained hv such a conversation, and to its agree<:Lble-1 • ~ t ness and painlessness may he traced its universality. But none of • these \advantag-es\ are of 'such a character that they could not be/ a ttainerl otherwise. nor are they the predominating characteristics 1 hut rather the by-products of the \bull session.\ It may be further 1 maintained that in the course of such conversation new ideas \V·ill be presented and unfamiliar affairs may he brought into the state of copsciottsness. There is that possibility, but snch an event warrants a more elevated title and quite puts it b.eyond the scope of our accepted definition. This editorial is concerned with the session known as the \mutual exchange of inconsequentialities.'' The idiom \bull sessions\ is not a derivative of that other idiom \taking the bull by the horns.\ The criticism here is directed against the feeble, pointless, and ephemeral consersations that interrupt the concentration essential to hard study. As an instigator of the weH-known session, there is always the man with an easy next day, and the ensemble is composed of those \vho find it easier to join in the conversation than to demand .the silence of the student's cloister. The pity comes in the sacrificing of the cotwenience of the man who desires to work to the puerile talk o.f the indisposed. If only those implicated in the \bulling\ atrocities were all easy-next-dayers and had not duties more imperative, the situation would not so imperatively demand attention. It requires less effort to join in with desultory talk and it is more enjoyable-~but it does not get anything accomplished. The \bull session\ has its place and, in a measure, it will be ad- mitted that it is a necessary luxury. But there is a sharp line oi : l- PORTRAIT OF J. DALTON BY JOHN LONSDALE~ The Quaker who mode Chemistry a Science ~~~AVENDISH had shown that two volumes of hy- drogen and one of oxygen always combine com- pletely to form water and nothing else. Proust, a Frenchman, had proved that natural and artificial carbonates of copper are always constant in composition. ''There must be some law in this,\ reasoned Dalton. ( I766- 1844), the Quaker mathematician and school teacher. That law he proceeded to discover by weighing and measuring~ He found that each element has a combining weight of its own. To explain this, he evolved his atomic theory- the atoms of each element are aU alike in size and weight; hence a combination can occur only in definite proportions. Dalton's theory was published in I 8o8. In that same year_, N a- General (jeneral Office_. C.Om pol eon made his brother, J oseplt, king of Spain. This was considered a political event of tl'emendous importance. But Joseph left no lasting impression, whi·le Dalton, by his discovery, elevated chem- istry from a mass of unclassified observations and recipes into a science. Modern scientists have gone be- yond Dalton. They have found the atom to be composed of ele.c- trons, minute electrical particles. In the Research Laboratories of the General Electric Company much has been done to make th.ls theory practically applicable so that chemists can actually-predict the physical,. chemical and elec• trical properties of compounds yet undiscovered. In a world of fleeting events the spirit of science and research endures. E.ledtric any Sckt nectaJy,M.Y. Js-flz6-HD .. , :! i: ; i 1.: ' . '·, 0. 426 s AL: For l TeleJ Ever ·quar

These are years for the 11 setting of goals, for the weighing of values to find the things most i v;ort h while. _\nd this world of ours is tremendottsly in n.eed of ymmg men v;ith ,·isions. The world is moving-fast-and it needs men who can make it moH' in the right direction. It is a :false conclusion to think that progress is inevitahle, that the world will go on to constantly better things no matter what \Ve clo in it. The world will get better life vvill he more worth while, only as we make it so. The best of its past is before us as we study here, it is for us to build on that past a better future.

The football team, composed of green men playing ag-ainst the breaks of the game, won or tied the most impo-rtant games of the season. The period of breaking in and learning the game con- tinued for a discouraging length of time and resulted in early season defeats, but the season may be counted a success because of its vic- torious conclusion. The student body did not cheer the football team through its disconraging trial period; while that eleven was cut- ting- its wisdom teeth, did not even show any sympathy. Fellows went around in a facetious mood saying that Union had graduated into Yale's class now-had not won a game.

It is a proud boast that Union college is known as the ::\Iother of Fraternities. This college has witnessed the remarkable develop- ment in the fraternity system and woulcl be the first to defend and urge its justificatinn against anti-argument. Fraternity growth has been a natural evolution and today, with a new fraternity ideal on the norizon, hostility to the college fraternity has minimized. The good old clays when rivals raided one another's lodge rooms are gone with- out reg-rets. The growth of the na tiona! :fraternity is a recognition of the instinct that indiYidnals of similiar tastes tend to seek one an- other's company. There is nn danger that fraternities will be abolished; the danger lies in a misplacecl emphasis on the position of the fraternity. Fra-1 tcrnity men thcmseh-cs recognize that there is a danger that an or-: ganizatiun may -become too self-centered ancl may seek to exist by; themselves ancl \\·urk for themsehes. It is the tendency to emphasize' the part to the neglect of the whole which supports it. At Union, on occasion. fraternities are inclined to insist on their O\Vll. rights as pre- eminent. .-\ policy of glorious, self-sustaining isolation pursued by a fra- ternity evidences short-sightedness. The organizations within the college prosper only in proportion as the college prospers. A quality increase in the character of the student body is reflected in the character of fraternity delegations. The sub-freshman should be urged to come here to college as a potential Union man and not as fraternity material. It will readily enough be admitted that the pur- poses of the fraternity and the college are not contradictory. The fra- ternity should complete and give meaning to the functions of the col- leg-e. Both do their best to develop the capabilities of the students and render him more fit for the practical affairs of li:fe. The fraternity owes its origin to the social instinct of man to join himself with fellows of his own choosing. It has been claimed justly that the fraternity narrows the circle of friendship; an eifort should be made to introduce a reagent. College friendships are as valuable .as fraternity friendships, and, when founded on a common enthusiasm for the college itself and what the college has to offer, these friend- ships are a tremenduous power for good. The nature oi the fraternity make for the creation of distinction ; the conscious aim of the fra- ternity must be to broaden its horizons to correspond to those of the college. The belief that one's particular crowd is always in the lead and always right in whatever it undertakes, coupled with a lack of uThe New Architecture}} The Complete Project fo•• the Standard Oil Bttildi11g New York Cily CARRERE and HASTINGS Architects A DISTINCTLY new tendency is apparent in architectural thought and design today. Architects are designing in masses -the great silhouette, the profile of the building has become of far greater importance than its detail. There is a new vigor and ~uggedness even in buildings which are conven· tionally classic in their detail, Masses mount upward, supporting the tower, accentuating its heigbt. The new .architecture is tending toward great struc· tures rather than multiplicity of detail. Certainly modern ihvention-modern engineering skill and organization, will prove more than equal to the demands of the architecture-of the future.

T HIS is the month when the sun is outshone, and we mortals dmw greater warmth and sustenance from that homely provender-mince pie. It is the warmth of the holiday spirit, which causes human hearts to glow when temperatm·es are lowest. Mother's cooking-the family united- Christmas trees and crackling logs-what would this world be without them? In promoting the family good cheer the college man's part is such that modesty often blinds hi.ro to it. It would hardly occur to the glee club man to sing over the songs of Alma Mater for the still Dearer One at home. The football man would scarcely suspect that his younger brother is dying to have him drop-kick for the \fellers\. The Prom leader would not presume to think that among those sisters who have been waiting to share his 0 agility at fox-trot may be his own sister. And in general, college men would scorn to believe that any conversational prowess they might possess on books, professors or campus activities could possibly inte1~est a certain Gentleman Who Foots the Bills.
