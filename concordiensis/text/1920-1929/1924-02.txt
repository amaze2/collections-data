Avery, '25 Tuesday, Feb. 12, 1924 THE ALUMNI GAME The Interfraternity Conference 'and the v~ri-ous :Craterniti•es in- dividually can do much in bringing scores of alumni back to the campus for the Alumni- Varsity contest scheduled for March 15. Each year we see the same old faces, much to our deli.ght; but to our s.orrow only a few of the alum,ni are among those returning. The .fra:ternities can be of real assistance in getting their alumni to revisit .their old haunts and with persona•! interest being shown in their be- half we feel certain that many who wouM not otherwise come back would he among those whom vve should have the good fortune to welcdme. Many of the alumni with the matter brought to their especial attention would arrange to return for the week-end. Vve urge all chapters to notify their alumni of the coming contest. WE ARE BOYS! \The English student has intellectual freedom, and in this branch of life is considc:red a man, while in matters of conduct he is considered a boy and is curtailed by rigid ru1les. The American student mu.st attend classes and take examinations and i·s considered a hoy in this phase of college life ; he is considered a man in matters of conduct. The problem is whether the student is to be considered a man and given an opportunity to display his intellectual capadty.\ The remarks of President Marion L. Burton of the Modern Lan- guages Association deserve the attention of every undergraduate. H we are to be treated as men in one phase of our life, why not in all! phases? The Garnet basketball squad deserves much commendati-on for its recent victories over the UniYersity of Rochester and Clarkson Institute of Technology. Rochester has one of the 'best teams in its history having defeated such aggregations as Corne 1 11, Hamilton, Hobart, Toronto and others and having lost to Colgate by bu:t a single point. The Clarkson team has Syracuse among its -list of de- feated foes this season. Thus, if scores might ]).e used in rating a team, Union has a court combination which ranks a·mong the fore- most in the East. 0) Seventeen Awarded Scholarly Honors Oontinued from page 1 Morgan Honor; Edmund Barry Nay- Ion, '23, Lewis Uenry :.forgan Honor; Chat:les Frederick Kellers.

Wrote the Opus Maju:5, Opus Minus, Opus Tertium, and many other treatises. More than a million dol- lars a year is devoted to • research by the General Electric Company in order that the giant- electricity-may be made more and more useful to mankind. For this he was • sent to pnson Roger Bacon may not have invented gun- powder, as has been claimed by some~biog­ raphers of the famous Franciscan friar; but he exploded some of the outstanding errors of thirteenth century thought . Because of his advanced teachings, Bacon spent many years of his life in prison. In an age of abstract speculation he boldly asserted the mathematical basis of all the sciences. But even mathematical calcula- tion, he showed, must be verified by ex- periment, which discovers truths that spec- ulation could never reach. ,.. In the Research Laboratories of the Gen- eral Electric Company, Bacon's principles are followed in every experimental investi- gation. The gas-filled electric lamp and the electr.on tube were worked out on paper, but it was experimental verification of the underlying mathematical theory that made electric illumination, radio broadcast- ing and x~rays what they are today.

A man or a team or a college that clings to it, harking back to the glories of yesterday, is likely to be out- stripped by some young but sturdy rival. That is a sermon we have taken home to ourselves. The \\Vestern Electric Company is proud of its fifty-four years of histmy. But it is a great deal more concerned with the next fifty-four-and that is why we have been talking to the college men of America month after month now for four years. The future of ihis business depends not so much on the physical equipment we have built up as on the mental equip- ment which men of your generation are building-on your habits of study and conduct, on your rig·ht choice of a pro- fession and your proficiency in it. So we have made suggestions for your guidance, with the conviction that they can help you -and us. * * * * This company, with its laborator;es, its distributing organizationand it!'l great tele- phone factory-in every respect a modern industry and in many respects a leader- wiJ;l have openings from time to time for men who can qualify. rl/esrern Electric Company Since1869 ma~ers and distributors of 4/ectrit:a!.equipmmt Number 36 of a series J Grad:Ua1 For catl \'I cr« (1 Fo we of two~ stu de of prj midn Subri addr• TheJ CLOTHE ·crhe Ci1J tail• 11111'0 frot clw IOC .Ma: NATI 841Broa , , Sniyvesa~ 152 231 , 863 J ROC ]

The Best Business Career I S vvhat every mnbitiouc senior lS thinking aboqt ~t the present titne. life insurance is one of the best, one of the most desirable, and one of the most satisfactory as a penn.J.ncnt calling. In assets and volume of business, life insurance i3 one of the three leading businesses of this country, yet the ncld is comparatively under~ developed. Only 7 per cent of the economic'v .. ~lue of human life in the United States is covered by insur ... ance.This gives an idea of the big field still to be worked,' especially business insurance for firms and corporations. As to remuneration: Reports· of college graduates vvho have entered business indicate that life\ insurance is ., at the very top as a source of inco1ne.

But for most of us, this new Williams Hinge- Cap puts an end to an ancient nuisance. Williams Shaving Cream is just as much pleasanter to use as is the Hinge-Cap. It softens the beard with uncanny speed. The thicker lather holds the moisture in against the skin where it is needed. This lather lu~ bricates the skin, too, so that painful razo .. • friction is eliminated.
