Naumoff Issue Manage•·-----------~----------------------E. Croft, J,r, FRIDAY, DECEMBER 2, 1927 We are all familiar with the geHeral system of rewal'ds and penalties in various fields of commercial and political activity. We may, for this reason, properly ask ourselves, \Can ed u- cation adopt a system of financial penalties with beneficial results?\ Undoubtedly this point was in the mind of the Board of Trustees when it decreed, at a recent meeting, that a fine of twenty-five dollars should be levied upon the student for each subject failed and repeated by him. Every law, every statute, every decree, re- gardless of conditions which bring it into ex- istence, has its advantages and disadvantages. As to this particular mling·, in its favor, we may say that it employs the centuries-old be- lief that a detening force acts as a positive force in determining the actions of mankind. It is only natural that anyone seeking to avoid the undesirable effects of a penalty would act in the only way possible to escape. Applied to om· case ,no doubt it is reasoned that thE- aver- age student vvho is on the border line and who is in imminent danger of facing the fine, will call .on his last reserve of energy in an attempt to raise his scholastic standing. This factor is of course a most important one. , In opposition to this belief, there is a feeling on the part of many .students that a rule of this nature will drive a great number to a choice of so-called \pipe\ courses. Isn't it rea- sonable to assume that those very students for whom the rule is intended will systematical-ly plan out a course of least resistance in subj.ect matter? This, however, will not affect fresh- men and perhaps it is the faculty's desire to establish a definite trend toward study in the first year, that prompted this decision. Also, will not this ruling tend to force many students to resort to \shady\ practices in a desperate attempt to get by? Not that these practices are foreign to us now. But it may serve to make the situation more acute than ever before. The Student Body as a whole will be inter- ested in its application and result. We aTe definitely at odds with those pirates of pub- licity who are constantly raising the human cry about colleges being built up around stadi- ums; that college life consists of w~ving a silk flag at traditional football games. We're of the opinion that the students will reflect very seriously on this attempt to improve their scho- lastic standing and will 1:eact to it in a ered- itable manner. B. B. N. It appears that nothing can be done about the various doors on the campus wh-ich have but one portal opened. The Terrace Ceuncil has taken matters into its own hands and has decreed that the freshmen shall use the front entrance to Bailey- Hall, thereby giving the With to-night's issue of The Concordiensis all mys- tedes and specula-tiol'ls rega.rding the schedule of the basketball season ave dis[!>elled, In looking over the card we first cannot help noticing that ,the number of games this year are fewer than the contests p·layed in previous seasons. In the second place, only seven -of the sixteen ganles wiH :be staged in the Gymnasium Alumnorurn and two of the ain.e ·scrimmages away are retur-n ga.mes. Thirdly, we fi-nd th-ree new-comers on the list of opponents, Ford~am, Providence and M. I. T; All of the contests scheduled win no doubt be head- liners for the Garncteers and this fact should, in no smal1 manner, make up for the deficiency in games. * * * Practice ·on the com·t got away for t-he whirl-wind season yesterday afternoon wi.th nearly forty candida·tes reporting to Coach Bill Hardman. Since .there a~e enly a few vetemns back this year, compehtion for :berths on the varsity quintet should be very keen. • * * * No doubt many of our readers were pleased to sec recently that Union was ranked fifth among the first .: ten lacrosse tcaH~s in the country. Lacrosse has been a sport here only a comparatively short time during which period this athletic activ-ity has cnj oyrd increas- ing growth and popularity. It is indeed a compJ.iH~ent to the Garnet lacresse team to have received such a ranking from the Interco'llegiate Lac.rosse Association. * * * A short time ago we mentioned fhat the Temple University football team led the country in total .points scored during the past season. And now we find Alfred and Upsala having a squabble all of thcit own to settle which one of the two is the world's worst clul!mpion. Alfred scored 6 points to its opponents' 309, while Upsala garnered no score to 313 for its opponents. Comparath·c scores per game make the two about as evenly matchecl as even the most fastidi- ous could hope for. \Ve suggest a post-season contest on New Year's Day to decide the grave question. * * * During the coming season the Crescent Athletis Club will engage in twenty-four games, seventeen at home and seven aw·ay. Contrary to the usual custom, Union will not play the Half-~fooners in home-and-home con- tests this year. The New York quintet has always been composed of former college sta;rs who have displaycd flashy style .against the Garnet. A tough game is ex- pected on March J,~when the Crescents appear here. * * * Columbia's prospects on the court this winter rest large,ly upon Madden and Rieger, the only two men available to Coach Meenan who have shown ability in the past to rank as dependable players. Madden is the leader of the ·basketball team and for the last two cam- paigns has starred at guard. Bill is noted particularly for his ability on the defense, but toward the close of last season he scored repeatedly. Although seldom getting the jump, Rieger played a stellar game at center for the Blue and White last season and throughout the year he was a ·consistent scorer. * * * In the futme it is probable that many Rhodes Schol- ars will be barred from participation in sports at Ox- ford University. A new tul~ was recently passed at an Oxford-Cambridge conference, which forbids any stu- dent who is 23 years of age or more to take part in certain athletic contests between the two major uni- versities. At the present time the rule applies only to track and cross-country, but there is agitation now un~er way to extend it to hockey, soccer, rowing, rugby and lacrosse, in which Americans have hitherto taken a prominent part. MO'BY DiCK. other three classes a better break at getting to classes in that building on time. We shall press~agent for the Council in a campaign for opening both portions of the doors in our build- ings. We suggest that the Council interview people and discover the reason for the myste- rious fastening of half of each entrance. In the meantime, the freshman rule could be extended to bring the point out more clearly. The freshmen should enter the Engineering building by way of the cellar, thus permitting the upper classmen to g·et out or in without being mussed up by a swaTm of yearlings. The frosh could enter Washburn by means ·of lad- ders placed conveniently at the rear windows of each class room. And doubtless the tower in Butterfieid could be turned into means of ingress .. and egress. If there are insufficient exits to permit. classes to 'pass within -five 1p.inutes it is possible that the blocking of the exits does not confo1'm to the fire code which requires that a building must be .capable of beiNg emptied in a much shorter time.

J!t is to the receptive minds and the whole-heat\ted. enthusiasm of our p1·edecessors in student 'li·fe that we owe the wealth of this college in e~tra­ curriculum activities. The requisites of a good .student body ~.=ue outgrowths of a .single aim,- the quest of hon- ors. Competition keys human faculties, mental as well as physical, to their highest :pitch aDd yields a finished product of intrinsic value. Monopoly, on the other hand, is synonyQlr>us with the commo:rwlace. The success of a:11y campus organization can be openly tr~~d to the rivalry which it has engendered in estab- lishing itself in the favor of the student body. The attitude of the student body at Unic:m toward certain extra-curriculum activities which held positions of significance in the ey-es of the graduates has become one of decid.c:!d indifference. The circle of competition hel'~ seems to have narrowed to such an ex:tent that only those objectives which demand. a mini• :mmn of mental ·effor.t of the aspirant are i:n· eluded within its circ!lmference. Athletics will .probably always draw its fu'Il share and more of student support. Despite stringent faculty restrictions to curb tlteit' scope and to combat the wave of commercia.l- ism which recently swept college sports, the student's appl'eciation of an exhibition -of or an active participation in contests of physic~! prowess can not he dampened. A losing .team often meets with a mild chagrin, but an un- successful season invariably evokes added :par- ticipative interest. FoTemost among those activities whi~h. would benefit most from keen competition, yet in wh.ich the spirit of ·rivalry is at an .especially low ebb, are publications.

''i'he casuwl- tics ·of winter were six squares of glass at the rear entrance to the Old Cha.pel and in the former f{istot')' -office. T:he casnafties of soiree wilil have to await dc- 'VCl opme nts, ho{tt 'is- expected a full report will he avaHable some 'dtlrt ~.day, a·nd. in anticipation of this, the :faculty .has ~.ed' Satu-rday a holiday.

V/e de- cided- to go on a tour this past week end, af·ter having enjo,yed the almost balmy weather of .the middle of last ,week The secret must have leaked out for, soon as we set .foot in the gas wagon the snow began to do its d11.ty. It con tinned; ever increasing its effor.ts, for the one hundred and seventy mi·lcs that ·we rode, to the place \far above Cayuga's waters.\ When we got thNe we slid down the hills ti.Jl we weren't so far above Cayuga's waters, and then tried to get back U[:>. Un- fortttna:tely we had 'left Mr. Weed's non skids home, We got out and pushed. * '* * * Tll.en just to show that winter reaHy meant t0 stay it snowed most aH night and next day, but Sunda,y ·it stopped, We shovelled out the car and thawed out the radiato~, and got ready to return. We anticipated a bright clear dr·ive in the evening. We started and s0 did t11e weather. It gave us a variety shower, :begin- ning with rain and progressing through hail and snow. The windshield shortly became translucent but not trans[>arent. Off came the side curtains and .... A mile is suve a long way and one hundred and seventy of them is more than a long way. * * * * The car charlestoned and blackbottomed and five- stepped back to Schenectady, and those gray old walts so dear looked good, but a hot radiator felt better. We thanked our lucky stars that the engineers were through playing with the boilers and there was such a thing as heat emanating from the central plant. * * * * The weather after entertaining ns for the week end decided 'to clear off as soon :!S we got back to the home of the \lighters and haulers of the worlJ.\ . Next time we're going to do o11r touring a la pullnnn. * * * The Spanish Club has an artist, and the Spanish Club has posters that are to say the le:\st atl ractive. In fact they are so attractive that they so en disappear from the bulletin board. The Sp:mish Club likes to keep H10se posters in the archives of the c't:'J, and at- tempts to get around before somer ne else, .bttt missed out on the last poster. It is evident that some one appreciates art and borrowed the poster thinking it would' ottly be torn down or disfigured. As the Span- ish cl'11b would like to have that poster, Frohman An- derson., the Spanish club artist, is offering a duplicate· of the poster to tl1e art collector who appropriated the original, if he will return the original. * * * llhel'e's a'P~efereni::e For JERSEY· ICE :CR1EA,M~ SCHENECTADY'S PREMIER PHONE9W6 :1 ' ' ' I - - . -- - - . l :The KOZY KORNER, A !few steps from Noxth Coliege ·on Van Vranken Avenue We serve Lunc'hes ahd: Fountain • . 1 Refreshments .

I· VO:L •. LI. Soiree A Big joke Says Atttistophanes[ -·.--·-· Soiree Is Usual Wet Bust As An, .Entertainment ORCHESTRA TERRIBLE Pigs Knuckles and .Sauerkraut Served For .Supper Now it came to pass that a certain. damsel ·!'>~came cxcecd,ing weary of · ·her p.rosaic n.fe and sought -diver~_ion: from the 0rdin;~ry entertainments of .the day. ·Whereupon she rose and• spake thus: \Low I will don my fin-: -est raiment, even .rny purple .and. fine· linen. Yea, even my fine!lt jew'els shall adom rn:y person and I shall seek· amusement I shall even unto that .famed celebration, that which is called. Sophomore Soirecc, that festival peing observed' .in the Temple of Health. Forsooth joy and g1adness shall. reign th.cre and evert I shaH be amused and :forget my weary life.\ Thus it .came to pass that the dam- sel ·did even as she had spakc. She. ;garbed herself in purple am1 fine linen .. · Y ca even in her jewels did she array herself, and hied to the Temple of:· Health. Now in that day were many youths and maidens making merry on that great .occasion and on that night did the da.msel meet many gallant youths, and yet she was not enter- tained. 'Even the splendor of the Temple availed not to please her with its rich and gaudy hangings and subdued lights, nor yet could the subtlest atts · of the Etl1iopian musicmakers beguile her into enjoyment, even after bacan-. alian ·stimulants had roused them to· their .greatest efforts. Said the damsel \Behold I am much bored. The grand march appealcth not unto me. What\ availeth the meet-· ing of many youths and maidens, and low tP,e refreshments .do cause me much distress. Forsooth even yon music seemeth but discord t~ mine cars and my slipper .pinchcth my foot. Yea, I would that I were home. The very ·hands of the clock do lag and I am ind.eed weary. Even the stag line holdeth no charms for mine eyes for the youths are bleary-eyed, and I care n:o.t about dancing. 'Een now shall I return to my domicile for what avail- eth it for a faculty member's wife to attend Soiree and stand in the rcceiv.- ing line?'.' But we cannot hold out on you any longer. There were lots of people at Soiree who did have a good time and. among tl~em were: The guests of Alpha Delta Phi: Miss Kathleen Harcourt, Freeport, N. Y.; Miss Eleanor Painter, Schenectady, N.

Mrs. N clly Fell, a gay, seventy year old, thrice-widowed lady, was well' acted by Theodore Oppenheim, '30. Other p;trts were: Mr. Ht1xley Hosse- frossc, taken by Bernard Cohen, '28; Teddy Speari'ng taken by Paul E. Schultze, '28; Miss Flo1;ence McCrick· ett played by Arthur E. McCormick, '30; Mr. Ralph Twiller .played by Car- mel C. &mafola, '28; l\l·r. Stage Man- ager taken by Ft·ank Bailey, Jr., '31; Mrs. Clara Sheppard played by Allen G. Gifford·, '31 and Jenny taken by Patll M. Cantwell, '31. The play is about the attempts of a group of amateur actors, directed by Mrs. l 1 arnpinelli to start a Little Theatre Movement in their town. In the :first act, which takes place in the drawing room of Mr. Ritter's l10me, the actors assemble for their final re- hearsal as their one act play is to be given the following evening. The re- hearsal goes so badly that Mr. Ritter faints, but it is not so bat! as the fol- lowing night when the play actually takes place. The scene of the second act is behind the scenes during the progress of the play. Lines arc for- gotten, cues misinterpreted, and cos- tumes co1rte apart in a merry con- fusion. In· the last act, which is back in Mr. Ritter's drawing room, Mrs. Rittrt-, after much crying and lament- in~, uer.ides to abandon the idea of going on the stage and to rcma.in and keep her home for her lmsband. Credit should be given to Mr. Philip Stanley, instructor in philosophy, who spent much time and effort coaching the players. Assisting him were Wil- liam 'toniski, '20, in charge of set· tings, Harry Lamberton, '28, in charge of properties, and Newton Miller, '28, in cha1ge of the house. During the intermissions and hcfor<\ and after the performance, the audi- ence \vas amused by the Garnet Gob- lins. Tlie long list of Patrons and Patron- 'esses included many of the faculty and tl1eir wives. ----·a---- TRADITION NiGHT Seven Games Listed The schedule has been re.leased by :)ircctor of :\thlc:tics Bruce and com- prises seven games, three of which ,vi\1 Le played at home.

T. 111aug,·r TUESDAY, DECEMllF.:H 1~. £927 ICE The return of the hockey season qrings to mimi one of the most urgent needs of the c:oHege, 1t. rink on the campus. The disadvantages of lJa'l'- ing the team play on the ring at Centt·Eti Park me evident. The necessity .of traveling to the pa11k:: every day in 01·der to see tl1e team- in action les- sens the interest of the student body in the spmt and so cuts down the team's support. This is tru~ not only 0f the practice sessions but 21lso of tile- games. The student body lias been conspicuous at the games, by its absence. Even at the !llo:it interesting and the closest contests, the support given the team has not been of such a quality as. to inspire the plaJers in the manner in whidl cheering is supposed to urge them to their gt·ea test efforts. Doubtless the effect of c·hecring is not as great as is commonly supposed but mon: support would certainly put the sport on a l1igihcr level and bring it to a position of prominence ,wl1ich it de- serves and which it enjoys at many othc1· colleges. A rink on the campus, within easy l'L'ach of the student body would bring forth that suppod bet- ter than a.ny other measure possibly could. There was once such a rink at Union hut it was abolished because it had a detrimental effect on· the tennis courts, where it was situated. \Ve grant tl1at the courts, such as they at·e, should not be ruined and that tennis deserves a proper C'Ourt as much as the sextet deserves a JH~oper rink, but there is no I'Cason why a rink musf be set up on the tennis courts. The humoroml'y termed \facul- ty courts\ arc no longer in use and could be util- ized for the purpose or the rink could lbe set up on the Nott Street field or the land between it and: Alexander field. The actual location matters lit- tle, just so that it would be on the campus. AnJ place easily accessible to the students .would serve the purpose and bring forth the f':upport which is due the team. MISPLACEMENTS Student body meeting is again degene1'a ting to an intcrestless, rowdy-marked session. It is. not to be ex:pected that the student officers can devise weekly bombshells and so keep the campus in a continual furore of animated discussion. Attendance seems to be a fairly high level, perhaps because of the opportunity for hazing o1· because of the fear that \somebody will put some- thing over on us.\ As with other law-making bodies, the meeting is essentially a business affair but, being a college gathering, thet•e are some pat'ts which are not classified in business rules of _ order.

TL!e fair visitors to our campus enticed many a weary youth to ch?pel or was it the rising number of chapel cuts. Let us be optomistic and believe that it was some cause other than chapel cuts. \Veil anyway we went to chapel and being a few moments late found most of the pews in the front of the chapel occupied. \\'e sat towards th~ rear of the church.

FRIDAY, DI'.::C'E~IBER 10, 1927 GREETINGS The Concorilienmr takes this opportunity to extend to every t·ca.c:let· wishes for a 1\Ierry Christ- mas and a Happy New Y car. It is a delight to haYC such an occasion come yearly when tlte members of the staff and tlle va1·ious readers, dispersed and scattered, in their different pursuits in life during most of the year, reunite in that happy state of mutual good-will that lead:; to friendship, \the highest degree of perfection in soeict_y.\ It has been a pleasure for The Conco1·diensis to serve during the past months a.ll in rnion Col- lege. and its many readers among the alumni, in a manner striving to make the paper a work without which the readers would feel somel~ow the poot•er. The paper has been enlarged and its columns edited by students now covet· the fields of literature, drama, books, sports and items of gen- eral interest. Personal expressions of opinion from the undergraduates and alumni printed in these columns have inaugurated movements that have borne fruit. The establishment of the Idol as a literary pet·iodical on the C'a.mpus is an ex- ample, The spirit of the cooperation on the part of the faculty and the undergradua•tes in aiding to make this a better news publication has been most gratifying to the staff. Again we wish for all our rraders a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year. THE IDOL It is fitting that on the hundredth anniversary of the founding of the first literary magazine on the campus another periodical, more sturdy, should be established. To the staff of the Idol we wish success and hope that a spirit of coopera- tion and not of competition will be the krynote of our relationship. GOOD BUSINESS Sports at Union a1·e not commercialized.

He injured his ankle during the Clark- son g·anu and when the cast was recently removed from ltis leg doctors found that muscles above the ankle lmd grown to the bone. * * * * * 01· cr in Harvard there seems to be considerable discussion on whether or not athletes on probation slJOtrlcl ;J>e denied the benefits of intercollegiate com- pctiti()n, One alumnus points. out that it is not .fair simp·ly to put a man on p1:obation because of low grades a-:tid then trust that he will work out his own salvati 011. ']\his alumnus maintains that since athletics arc a co ll'cge activity a man should not be prevented from represent-ing the college in the sports if he is good enough to participate. On this basis then, if a player f~Llls below' the scholastiq requirements, the col- lege sho~IId see to it that the man studies more and betters h.is grades. If, however, the player is unable to par-ticipate in intercollegiate competition and obtain passing :rnarks at the same time, the college should giYe up all hope and present the man with the prov- erbial blue slip. * * * * * During the forthcoming holidays two very inter- esting in tersectiona! post-season football games will be played, and both of them will take place on the Coast. In one of these games the University of Penn- sylvani-a eleven will take the field against the University of Crrlifornia; and in the other the University of Pitts- burgh will do battle with Stanford University. The first game will take place on Saturday, December 31, at BcPke! y,, Cal, and will be played in connection with the dedication of a players' bench in honor of the mem- oriY of Andy Smith, former Pennsylvania captain and star, and :coach of the California football team until his death .two years ago. After the meeting the Cali- fornia devcn the members of the Pennsylvania squad will lea.ve .for Los Angeles, and on Monday, January 2, th:cy will attend the battle between the Pittsburgh and Stanford elevens. This game will be the annual Tour- nament of Roses contest and it will be played at Pasa- dena, Cal. According to the Stanford Daily \The New Year's Bay. game is becoming an annual money-making affair for one afternoon's am11sement of thousands of non-colleghtte spectators. Stanford's student football pl:ayers, after a season of playing for the amateur sports1nanship of American college football, will help to advertise southern California and thereby boost the price of •I:cal estate there.\ May.be so, nevertheless both games sli<>nld be mighty inte~esting to listen to over the racUo as Pittsburgh won eight of its nine games and wash.eld to a tie in the other contest, while .Stan- ford was :victor-ious in eight games and was· defeated in two during the past year.

Behind the scenes with Columbus T HERE is a forgotten chapter in the life of Columbus which in its way had as much to do with the dis- covery of America as the voyage itself. We refe-r to the years spent in prepara- tion before he set sail-· years £11ed with painstaking study, planning his voyage with the aid of what cn1de rnaps and geographical data he could procure. In telephony, too, the success of each new: develoument depends on the years of intensive research and careful planning that precede actual construction. Bell telephone men are continually mapping out the course of this great industry for years to come. The true telephone pioneer is he who brings vision and initiative to his work as supervisor, engineer or executive - and who backs this up with the pains- taking study needed to crystallize the dr.eam into the reality.
