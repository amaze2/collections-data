It seems unqnes-1 tionahle, h(lwe\·er. that the conditions which differentiate American I society from its European parent have integrated an indidclual Arnerican psychology the characteristics of which have been vari- ously conJtnendecl and attacked. One of the most regrettable features of America's high-powered psychology of efiiciency is the atrophy of what little sense of humor th<1t remained as the heritage of J\Iicl- Victorian England. The aver- age American, in fact most Americans even far above the average, han· long since ceased to distinguish between seriousness and solemnity. The reason for this failure to distinguish probably lies in the [act that the .two ha\·e been unfortunately associated for s0 long a time. .\ sense• of humor is more or less synonymous \·ith a sense :1f proportion. Its lack has causecl Americans to pnrsue in dispro- portionate precipitation. the particular goals or fetic:hes toward which they ha\·e directed their destinies.

There must also be in- terpretatiOn. Take the cases of Galvani and Volta. One day in 1786Galvani touch.ed with his metal instruments the nerves of a frog's amputated hind legs .. The legs twitched in a very life-like way. Even when the frog's legs were hung from an iron railing by copper hooks;, the phe .. nomenon persisted. Galvani knew that he was dealing with electricity but concluded that the frog,s legs had in some way gen- era ted the current. Then came Volta, a contempo- rary, who said in effect:\Your in- terpretation is wrong. Two differ- ent metals in contact with a moist nerve ~etup currents of electricity. I will.·prove it.without the aid of frog's legs.'' Volta pilecl disks of difFerent metals one. on top ·Of another a11d General vener\l Office Coln separated the disks with moist pieces of doth. Thus he gene- rated a steady current. This was the\ V<:•~taic pile 7 '-the first bat• tery, th·z: first gen.erator of electricity. . ~ Eoth Gahi'a~'!.; and Volta were careful experimenters, but Volta's correct interpretation of c1fects gave us electrical engineering, Napoleon was the outstanding £gure in the days of Galvani and Volta. He too possessed 311 active interest in science bJit only as an aid to Napoleon.Heli ttle imagined on examiningVolta.'scrudebattery that its effect on later civih~ation would be fully as profound as that of his own dynamic. ,personality. The effects of the work of Gal- vani and Volta may be traced through a-hundred yeara of elec- trical development even ~o the latest discoveries made in·the Re. search Laboratories of the Gen. eral Electric Company.

Everyone in the party was in- tent on seeing all of New York in the five clays allowed, attd it was a tired crowd that reported for classes yes1er- day morning, -after a round of Broad- way shows and other points of interest aJbout the city. Among the places Visited by the men in their spare hours were the Metro- poli-tan museum, Statue of Liberty, Bronx and Central parks, the nation-al iitdoor tennis championships, the Wo-olworth buil-ding, and the Wall Street district.

President Richmond commented correctly on the attitude of the freshmen toward student meetings and, needless to say, his comment w-as not complimentary. It is time that action was taken. vV e might go s•o. far •· as to recommend haircuts to enforce student meeting attendance. There is probably nothing more exemplary of college spirit than attendance once a week at student meeting. From outward appear- anc·es our college spirit is degrading, instead of ilnproving. The most disc-ouraging part o£ the whole situation is the fact that the freshmen ief violators. the attendance at next Monday's meeting. put into shape for varsity practice, but they are not yet ?ard enough for the continuous playing, which would r-esult if they were open to the student body. Its soon as possible the remain- . ing courts will be made rea,dy and students will be able to play.

The .principal speaker scheduled for the evening is Dr. Zay Jeffries, who will take as his topic~ \Hardness of Medals\. He is director 0f ·research for the Aluminum Casting company of Cleveland, Ohio, and is considered one of the best authorities in America on ·this field of metallur,gy. One of the largest attendances in the history of the local section of the society was recorded at 1!he last meet- ing when Dr. Walter Rosenhain, d~­ rector of research in the National Physics La'borll!tory of Great Britain during the war, spoke on the s~me topic. Thus, the scientists of this lo- cality are afforded an opportunity to compare the theories of the !foremost authorities of this country and Eng- land on identical topics. In add1tion to this feature, those at~ tending Friday night mmy be given a.n added treat in the forrm of an ad- dress by S~r James Irvine, principal of St. A,ndrew'&, who came to ·this country to attend the American Chem- tcal s·ociety meeting in New Haven; the Union men in the audience w-ith them, and standin·g arcrund the pl,at- form, sing a number of Union .songs.

Every once .in awhile, and quite frequently in the case oi certain individuals around the cam- pus, the desire to cut loose and he devilish seems to grip certain men arot1nrl the campns. So they go out and down some poor whiskey. and then ~tand around at fraternity dances in order to lend some zest to the party. It gives the girls an opportunity to see some real college life, and then again it sets the dance talked about around town as being \some party\. The musical program was diversified; all parts were weH rendered, and the a,pplause showed that .the audience was pleased. Several other college clubs ·came to Albany during the season, and while I may be accused of bias, I wish to make the statement that I thin.k the Union college clube are the best that have ap- peared here. Tell your physics prof. tl1at this cap.defies gravity The pity oi the rna tter is that whi.le the individual college stu dent is satisfying his cradng to be one of the \rip-ro:arin'\ type, he insults the guests of the fraternity holding the dance, and. does not a little to discredit the general good name of the college. This bus· ness of getting drunk w bile at a dance is nothing peculiar to Union College, but then neither is it anything to the credit of the college or its students. If these complexes are indulged in once or twice a year, they might be passed hy on the other side. But when every dance be\ comes an opportunity \to liquor up\ it would almost seem as if it were going too far. Getting drunk .is a man's own personal affair, but his intrusion upon others while in that conditi·on is hardly the mark of a gentleman. These remarks are written in a very general manner; perhap: certain individuals realize their particular application. GET BEHIND THE TEAM! \Play hall.'' ·with this the Garnet baseball season of 1923 wiH be underway. The first opportunity for organized outd·oor cheering· here subsequent to the football season is provided by the advent of the season which opens day after tomorrow. The support of any athletic team is essential for its success and the best means to attain this goal is: first, to be present on the field, and secondly, to let the team know you are there by cheering. Throughout the football season, liberally speaking, the cheering was good, but most unfortunately an undercurrent of destructive ,criticism pervaded which made itself felt to the extent that the 'COaches and players became aware oi it. It did not go unnoticed, nor Wlithot:it its harmful e.ffec;t. Such damnable remarks passed atouncl among the student body that they were heard in New York The danci11g after the regular pro- . gram was deljghtful. No musicians in I this vicinity have \anything on\ the famous Union college \Seven\ as a dance orchestra; . We are so much pleased that we are already plannin-g 011 a concert for next year. There were more than 300 prese11t Wednesday night, and with the back- · ground of such a successful affair, the \S. R. 0.'' sign will .go up early at the next concert.

At the present writing there is an amendment to the education law U·ncler fire in the New York state legi•slature in relation to his- tory text hooks which provides that the state shall have the power to regulate all history books used in the public schools. The cause for such action is attributed to the fact that several of the history text hooks now used in \\arious institutions are unpatriotic and should not be em played to stimulate young minds in the wrong direction. As a result of years of careful and laborious research work, his- torians have of late found that early nrsions, particularly of the American reYolution and years previous when this country was under the jurisdiction of England, have falsified the truth and that England controlled this domain better than is generally believed and in addition that the Americans are to be censured for their action to a certain degree. In other words, the truth when weighed carefully shO\vs that England is not to be reproached strongly as has been the Americans' custom of viewing the situation. On the other hand, the United States deserves more blame for her action. The hoard of directors of the Carnegie library located at San Jose. Cal., recently voted to prohibit three of Albert Bushnell Hart's books on :\merican history fro1n being included in the library collec- tion since they were said to he unpatriotic. The books spoke the truth. And the truth hurt. Did these men realize that Professor Hart of Harvard University is one of the most patriotic of men ancl was a close pe.rsonal friend of our immortal Theoclnre Roosevelt? which, we expect, the Fates willing, to bestow generously albeit at a p•rofit, on those who shall follow in our well- worn footsteps., are obious enough, but at fhis particular time of the yea'!\ they are absolutely insufferable.

Raymond, '58, a fra- ternity brother and room mate of Fitz Hugh Ludlow, '56, tells the following story of the a~ma mater ·in a letter printed in the Concor- diensis in \Ye Olden Dayes\: \One day, about a month before Fitz Hugh's graduation in 1856, we were sitting in our room (Kappa Alpha then occupied north section, north college) playing whist when · there was a knock at the door. It was Dr. Knott's servant, who said the president would like to see Mr. Ludlow. Fitz Hugh ga.ve the whist hand to another and left, we chaffing him a bit about being dis- ciplined. In a short time he re- turned saying the doctor wanted him to write an ode for commence- ment. We continued our game and Ludlow sat down and scribbled. We had hardly finished the hand when he rose ~nd read the complete poem, To our exclamation, 'Pray, ,when did you write it?' he answered, · 'On the way back here.'

I : \~o one can understand the success of the American democracy without : tak:ng into ful-l account the passion for :hig-her education. When the Pilgrim 1 Fathers landed at Plymouth there were , 1 101 persons in the company. Within ~ , a year cold, famine and disease had re-[' ; duced them to about one-half that ! number. And yet within 16 years the ; beginnings of a college were made. 1 . I \In 1635, John Harvard, a graduate: of Emmanuel college, Cambridge, gave half his property for the founding of ' . a college at Cambridge in the Massa- ' : chusetts colony. James town, in Vir- i I , , : g101a, was settled in 1607.
