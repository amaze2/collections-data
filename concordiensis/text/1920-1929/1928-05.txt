Realization of these 5 · · i § , Bruce and Van Dyke IL=:·. et The Geecian Dream_·. i_-=-= .. 1=:- , A tten.d Convention I', '- - - - - Telling the Athletic Board how to do .things, tha.t is teUing it ind:irectly seems to be a· fa,•orite pastime of l'nion CoJ:lcge. Early in the taB the students were .going to tell the hoard how to run a lacrosse team, tire coa•clJ., schedule and aH the r-est tlmt goes with the game. The adyicc pcdd:lcrs didn't go dire~tly 'to the :\thlrtic Board nntil the Terrace Cotmdl got up -its nen·c and ·inter-rogated that body. :\gah1 the .\.thletir Board has appC'arC'd as a happy hunting ground for thr shtd'C'nts indtt'lgC' in .the pr.ocess of rat hunting lib· an e.xcitahle f-ox terrier. This time the chief topic .for considci'ation is the electon of stu- dent titanagers, and thC' c-·ircumstanc·es and i·nfl'ucnc-es surrounding the process. The hunt ·iS initiated by the Concordy, with an C'cli·todal .reHecting the inHuenccs of fraterni.ty politics amon-g members of t.he Athle-tics •board, and the ,possibility of such .j,nfl.urnce having tan- g.iblr rrsults as fa.r as mn.nagrrs arc concerned. .\ lrttC'r arridng by the customary U . .S. tnai:l me- dium, adds othC'r <tspects .to t·he situation, in the line of who should vote and why. The said letter was written by a future member of the athktic board and one en- titlrd to sit at such meetings and to be heard, if not votr. PFOhably Doc Bruce d·oesn't care whether he \:otC's for a manager or not. 1t would seem that the lrtter might -b<'tter have been sent to the athletic board, or better still prescnt<'d in person to the athletic board. Publishing letters in the Concordy will nrvcr reform the athletic board, and if rrforms are desirwble it is the board not the students that must make them. t\s for politics, fraternity or otherwise in the elec- tion of managers it is a bit difficult to imagi.ne the faculty members yielding to such a means even though it were conceiYable that undergrads might. Person- ally, since the balloting for managers is done by open ballot, we don't see where there can be much under- handed fraternity politics. 'v\' e can't picture a faculty member voting for the poorest candidate on the list because he ;happrns to be a fraternity brother. His motives would he too evident. It would be poor poli- tics to say the least. But the athletk .board is not the only organization that the students have felt the urge to overhaul. The publication board is eY<'n now going through a process of unostentatious r-enovation. The student passion for committees is exemplifying itself all over .the campus. The Terrace Council has just emerged from a com- pletr reconditioning, wi:th elen•n cylinders, a constitu- tion, revisC'd and amended, and possibly a snowball stopper as standard equipment. If the student body wishes to function as a senate investigating committee and information bureau, it might better do its investigating first hand, and hand its advice directly to those concerned. The athletic board or any other body would grant anyone an oppor- tunity to address it on such a matter as has concerned the students recently. No one has been thrown out .or assaultrd at any of its meetings. It is possible that Inver committees and more firsthand criticism, pro and con, would clear the sky somewhat. But then we neyer heard of anyone being hurt at rat hunting so perhaps it is a harmless sport after all. By ANTISTOPHANES. conditions through a monotone, or better, through a tritone in popular humor lias aroused the finer attributes of free-thinking and tends to place con- ccntion of the average college student on a par with the loftinPss of the aim of his four-yPar career. -Busines~ Managers will g1ve further proof that advertising in the Concordi- ensis is a good business proposition.

Hall FTHDAY, :\lAY ·1, 1!l28 Q1.1ERULOUS We suppose that the Student Body of Cnion College was entrusted with sundry legislative and dective powers to provide for the undergraduate control of undergraduate aetivities, that it was equipped with a .Terrace Council to superintend and to direct its policy concerning internal and intercollegiate affairs, and that it distributed its powers among various committees, boards, and di- rectora tcs to obtain the most effieient manage- ment of the aforesaid affairs. Having gained their measures of authoritv from the didates of thr Student Bodv, the· above-named committl'es, boards, and di~·edorates might be assumed respon- sible to that organization for their internal opera- tion as well as for their discharge of duty. Pos- sibly the Student Body is capable of forming an opinion or even opinions regarding the perform- ances of its subsidiaries. We suppose that the function of a college ne,~·s­ paper is to inform the students of the college news and, through editorials, to reflect student opinion concerning erents of importance or of interest to the campus community. Perhaps it would be too sweeping a declaration to infer that, while its pol- icy fails to transcend the bounds of common de- cency, the paper is free to print its impressions of any activity whil'h falls under the jurisdiction of its sponsor. It may be that the ideal college newspnpcr dwosL·~ to crmf0r!ll with the standards established by ll'ading journals throughout the country. We suppose that those individuals chosen to formulate policy for said leading journals refer their opinions- and ideas to executive ·sources, mu~ nicipal and commercial. Friction, of any nature whatsoever, must be eliminated, regardless of the sacrifice involrcd. The fact that individual thought lends cdor to the personality of a paper is subordinate>. Only such views must be pub- lished as the dictatorial ft•w deem advisable for absorption by the publie. ObsL•rvations such as these may be ve1·ifie<.l by reference to the columns ?_f any large daily. vYe suppose that in the event of reeommcnda- tion din~ctl v to committees, boards, or directo- rates, till' j·udgment of the recipient body is un- hampered by pl'ejudice or love of power. Those possei:ising influl'JH'l' are apt to share it with little hesitancy. A suggestion from a single individual bears as much weight as a suggestion from a num- bPr of individua.ls. It is a math-1' of great social importance that one be able to distinguish between fact and fancy. In crrtn.in ocC'upations, imagination is t'specially sl'rviceabll• and dl•st•n·es cultivation. Fancv~as fancv--has a h·gitinmte place in one's ment~l life. One should, howl'W\T, discriminatC' elearlv bdween objective facts or truths and fantastic ·conshuc~ tions of one\s imagination.

Ham- ilton appears today on the Garnet golf ca·ro for the first time, and s],ould be easier than the second match against Colgate to1norrow, ena·bling the teain t.o get into S·moother working action fov the Maroon's Yet· rran cotnbination. 1.'nion is ont to avrnge the 4 to 2 defeat which Colgate administcrcd a year ago in the Garnet's oprnrr. * * * The tennis tram has a 'tough job on its hands to- morrow when it attrmpts the \\'Hliams outfit, a team which did not aJlpear on thr Garnet schedttle last year. The New Englanders captured the Easter.n Intrrc0l- legiate tit.J.' last spring after a season in which Yale, Harvard, Princeton, and Pennsylvania aU met defeat at the hands of the strong Purple squad. ~Iarsh, former ~ ew England champion, was lost by graduation last Jnne, !Jut there- is still a team of expel'ienced players ldt be-hind him to rontinue. * * * Coach \\'ittn('r's nipe tta vrled to Boston today in expectation of a stiff game. This is the first time that the strong Northeastern nine has appeared on the Garnet card, ·hut we e..:.pcct to ser the Cnion nine re- turning to e.igh t o'clocks Saturday morning wi·th a vic· tory under its belt. The Tufts team, which was de- feated by strong Yale- batsmen, 7 to 4, took a game away from :t\ ortheastrrn 6 to I. The Garnet goes a way with a half a game's ex.prrience from the Col- gate contest and a few pointers from tht' practire game with Schenectady High School Tuesday. * * * The track team will be in action on the campus for the first time this year in the triangular meet against Rochester and Yermont Sattlrday. With the tt'am whose representative'S appeared in the Penn Re- lays last week, Coach Bruce should have little difficulty ag:tinst these two. * * * \\'ith four virtor'es to its credit, thr Rutgers lacrosse team came here today to gin' l'nion one of the hardest fights of thl' season. Rutgers was the only team to defeat the ~arnet last spring. Tomorrow the Scarlet will go on to Syracnse where it will endeavor to defeat the Orange twelve as it did last year in a fast game. * * * Yale's lacrosse team was defeated by thr Crescent A. C. at Brooklyn last Satnrday, i to 6. The Crrs- cen ts scored .the first two goals, and although the col- legians were able to tie the score three times they were nP\'er able to gain the lead and finally lost the game. \Vesleyan won a postponed bas£>ball game from ~[ass :\ggies :\Ionday afternoon by a 5 to 2 count, after having defeated the Army team the preceding \V edn csday by the close tally of 3 to 2. N. Y. l'. is about on top of the Metropolitan bas('- ball heap now after defeating powerful Fordham rivah, 5 to J, Tue-sday afternoon. This gives the Violet nine straight wins for its schedule so far this year. The army team won from Colgate at tennis in a match which was cut short by the cold.

PatH~ 0/lket The Pl'()fessional Came Is there more sportsmanship among the amateurs than among the poe fessionals? .r doubt it quite a little. For example, take tl).e recent Hornsby-Cohen ·inCident. Cohen was Hornsby's successor at second for New York. Hornsby had been pushed out with little ceremony. He had been sent from a ball club 'With a pennant- winning chance to a ball club without a .pennant-winning :chance. When Cohen played his first game .for New York, before an ·Opening• (lay crowd, it was only natural that he would be nervow. Hornsby might :bave made it a trifle harder for him. In place of this he gave Cohen an the eneouragement he could. \Just think you are still with Bu1Jalo,\ he said, \and play your natural game. You~ll make good. Don't worry.\ How many stars on college football teams would extend the same eD- couragement to some younger player on the rival side? - The amateur, you might say, is keener to win. Does that natunllr make him a better sportsman? Another Incident A few ~ears ago Walter Hagen apparently had the North and &>uth championship at Pinehurst safely won. He heard that Freddie McLeod was moving along at a fast clip and might beat him. Hagen wandered out the course and. met McLeod at the seven- teenth tee. This seventeenth hole was then a one-shooter, about 180 yaraa in length. \What club are you using, Freddie?., Hagen asked. •A No.4,\ McLeod answered \Don't do it,\ Hagen said. \I made the same mistake. Take a No. 3 Ol' a No. 2. The wind's stronger than you think.\ I've forgQtten what happened, but at any rate Hagen's .advice was sound, .and lle called the turn correctly for a rival on the club to use. A Vote for Risko Dear Sir: There are many fight fans wllo believe that Johnny Risko. the Cleveland baker, would give Gene Tunney a harder fight than Tom Heeney, whom the champion !>refers for a midsummer opponent. And the s~me group believes that Mr. Tunney appreciates the fact. Risko's r a.ftd-tumble style, that is devoid of all science, would give Tunne trouble. and the chances are the baker would be on his feet w was over. With Heeney the champion will have a better ch out 81ld clean-cut victory. But mid-Western fans be · rather rough deal, after progressing so fa.r in Mr. Rickar lS deserving of a shot at Tunney Bu~ the deservi receive his dues in the boxing racket.

Any attempt to compare the relative merits of tlw individual nwmhe·rs of the two teams which ul!'t I•'riday afternoon on Alexandet• field woltld he unfair u·nh·s~> it \Ht'e made hv a disinterested obset·ver. J<'ew, ho\\·e,·er, will d-isagree that the cool, ddiberatc teamwork -of the Rutgers players was an evident and derisive advantage throughout the l'll tire contest. The lack of pia ying expet:i- ence proved too great a handicitp for Union de~ spite her pronounced superiority in certain oth<'r departments of the game. Choice of the first-nam('d plan would threaten Union's claims to national pretensions of an:v nature whatsoever and would relegate her to the class of smaller colleges and technical schools in which :;he has thus far sought to avoid .being placed, as well as to endanger that element held so vital to the continuity of a college's personal- it_y,--school spirit. All sports are not equally caleulable in advance on the basis of past per~ formance, it is true. But the success with which heatable opponents have been chosen for repre- sentatives of at least one major sport on t-he {'ampu~> is a stt-ong arg-ument for tltis ·alternative. If U1e d<'sire to win is foremost, this poliey is un- quPstionably th<' better. '\Ve doubt seriously. however, that int<'rest in a sport is best solicited by victori<'s oYer poor or mediocre teams. \VP!l-filbl spor.ts s<\hedules on the other hand, have long been a subject of contention between the Faculty and the Student Bodv of Union Col- ll'ge. Wh~ther or not adive participation in ath- IPlics is detrimental to seholarship is a question which has borne and will bear much discussion. That a rurtailnwnt of the n.umlwr of contests has a more harmful eft\•et on the prosperb of the tt•am than a lwtwfit to the player's scholarship is suppoded h_v the l'l'cords of this yeai·'s baskdbaJ) and !ftcrosst> h•m11s. Daily pradil'e dt,aws far mort• atlention from studies than a game. As far as missing {']asfirs is crmrernrd, thr privilege of a c<>rtain munher of eX{'U~><>d cuts per .semester is in ib-;l']f 11.11 admission that the normal1v intelli- g- .. nt ~tudPnt can afford to. miss class!'s ~ccasion­ ally. \Yh_v, tlwn, should tl1ere he any objection to his tnking holts h> partieipatl' in or to witness a <'<>nh·~t ON anothrr caulpus?

DICK ROVER., ----o--- Dr. Abbott Attacks ·Iconoclasm In Sermon The speaker at tl1e Sunday chapel' service was Dr. Mather Abbott, Head- · master at Lawrenceville School, Law- · r.enceville, N. ]. His sermon was based upon the parable of the Prodi- gal Son and the words of James: \He , is like tmto a man beholding his nftt- ural face in a glass: For he bcholdcth hitnself, and goeth his way, and straightway forgetteth what rpanner of man •he was.\ \'vVhat are you?\ was the theme for. the first part ·Of Dr. Abbott's address.' He spoke of the courage it took ·to; look at yourself \as in a glsas,\ and' emphasized that no one can really know you but yourself. He followed this up \vith a discussion of \What you aftr.-?\ and \Wha·t is America ?\ He spoke of the almost re- pu rsn it Of the dollar and .the r•u'\\''\\tion of the material, and said to .sn1ash :the fundamentals of tian, society would bring de-' ction to the iconoclast. He men- ed the mistake of turning freedom license and the danger confront- those doing it. He concluded by g that the older :generation that m aile sue h a mess. of things ar.e •that .the youth of today will the world closer to truth. Tii!le ... pae •at4 .J. F.

Coach Bruce will take a strong and somewhat small squad with him to the cham- pioni)hips, so Union's .representatives in the title meet at Haverford will have to show their ability for their event tomorrow. --~-·o---- Graduate Council Gives Thanks To Starzenski 20 years of age.

Defense Strengthened The Garnet had been pract-icing steadily\for the matches this weekend. Coach Clifford sent the squad through long scrimmages every day -in order to correct the weaknesses discovered in the last tlu·ec games. The- mrn 1\ave been ge-tting a great de<1l of n:- periencc shooting at the cage to im- prove their stickwork that appeared to be poor in the Rutgers game. Coach Clifford has been putting m-ost of his attention on the teams defense which was left rather weak through the graduation of :V1nlqueen and Ryon, both of whom were .on last year's All-American team. The star of the defense this season is King- ston who alone remains of tl1e pow- erful defense triangle developed by Coach Starzinski last year. He will be an All-American selection. this year unless Union has such a poor season that its record will hurt his chances. The lineup for the game with.

Hall FHJ.DAY, MAY 11, 1928 FRATERNITY POLITICS The trend of an open discussion on a campus problem is usually ef such a natlll'e as to exclude all mention or consideration of the factor which often actually determines its solution. Frater- nity politics, with its local transactions involving but a few minds, is frowned upon or discreet!)' ignored in public, yet its existence on the campus is as indelible a £act as its machinations are in- ealculable. As a medium t-hnmgh whid1 :student communal interest may be :kept alive in mat:ters of import, fraternity politics is essential to t;he unity of the Student Body. Aside from its benefits to the party engaged, it offers the individual countless opportunities for tl1e exercise and development of his qualities of leadership, for personal contact and extended association witl1 the members of l1is class, and for training in a branch of social en- deavor which has become a profession. That it affords also many loopholes for corrupt deal,ings, numerous ways of sidetracking justice, can not be thoughtfully regarded of sufficient prominence to warrant abolition of the practice. Perhaps the most valid objection te fraternity politics is its tendency to restrict the distribution of power, thereby ki!Iing, for those outside of the charmed circle, wl1a tever interest in activities may have existed. But, such interest, in accord with modern philosoph:v is more apt to disappear fr01n sustenance of this objection as an excuse rather th~tn as a direct result ef its ope1•ation. When competition fur an honor enters the home stretch, and the wear and tear of continued effort pro- duces an excessive strain on the candidate, he often readily satisfies his awn sense of duty and inher- ent pride in era:->ing his name from the lists by tile declaration that lw does not belong te the right crowd. The spirit w!ti<'h alh·ges monopoly of honors ·is too prone, it is true, to base its chat•ges on pos- sibilities without due considemtion of character. However illogical its conception, th(' fact remains, as student elections and activities attest, tha·t spirit, perhaps diluted to a great extent by a vein of indiffcrencc, is supported by the majority of the p.resent. Studcnt Body. A striet ohscrv11:nre of certain ]'n·inciples ancl understandingR, whi(•h have hecn ha-nded down through sewJ·al ge1icrations of student bodies and which -of latc have, in their ahusc, played a ron- spiruous part, could do mOI'r ,to llt'sttoy this illu-· :sion than any oth<'t' single factor, .:=:::::==============~==== : - - - - - ~ What They're Doiug:: - - - -- - -- -- - - - ~ i: :e Thc Hutgc't'S lbasehaH tra-m camr np .today wid1 somr o-f the sti,fkst opposit-ion that the ·Garnet can expect to meet this scasc;m.

The Yale lacrossP team which is being the <iarnet at New Hav.en this week end is one of the strongest competitors in the east for the Olympics, and should hand the Schenectady team a defeat, but thP Han·ard game scheduled for tomorrow is not as difficult, although the Cambridge temn trounced Br0wn \VC'd- nesday to th~ tune of 8 to 3.

Playing an impt-m·ed game, the Army defeated Columbia at tennis last Saturday, 5 to -+· The teams divided the singles at three-ail, bnt the Army took two out of three of the doubles. Columbia tied Fordham's undefeated team a week ago \VednC'sday, and is a strong opponent for the second game of the en-ion sclH'dule. Tomorrow the team will play a strong C. C. N. Y. team.

SE-NIORS An Opportunity for College Graduates in the ~~Best Paid Hard Work in the World\ W HAT are you going to do after graduation? If you have not decided-or if you have m;ade a snap decision-just read over -the rest of this. It presents the case for life insurance as a career. It is worth thinking about. The:choice of a career is important. Life insurance is most.desirable and satisfactory as a permanent That is the story of one who began at the bottom· and reached the top without the help of a col!ege education. The advantages are with you who grad· uate from college. calling. And why? Money Reports of college graduates who have entered business indi· ~ate that life insurance holds first place as a source of income. One John Hancock agent de· scribes his work as \the best· paid hard work in the world.\ He is a col!ege graduate and in five years has put himself at the very top of his business. Fut-pre And there is so much room for ability and energy. REASONS WHY • Life Insurance is founded on high ideals. • It Is capable of yielding a good In· come and t:he satisfaction of accom• plishment. • It oilers opportunities for real leadership. • It ·brings you in close assocla tlon with business and business men. • It requires you to become familiar with business methods, law and finance. • It is a fteld·forworkers, not shirkers. Life insurance, in volume of business, is one of the three leading businesses in this-coun• try, and yet it is only in its youth because the possible ap• plication of insurance is ex• panding a!! the time. Satisfaction Advancement • It Is an alluring and practical call• ing for men.of dynamic energy. But all the pay and all the advancement possible are not going to wholly satisfy the in· telligent college graduate. Life insurance offers further satis• faction. It is-one of the great factors in the modern world making for security, peace of mind, increase of confidence,, and the building up of credit In the second place, ad· vancement depends entirely on your own effort and ability. This is no fai-ry.tale of success. It is tile sober and proved fact. The Vice-President of a great life in· surance company who began his career as an agent has this to say to seniors who are about to graduate from college: \If you love work and desire to pursue an honor• able, useful and lucrative mission· in life, this is -the business.for you to take up. Life insurance salesman· ship offers !I fine field for the energies of the splendid young men in our co!leges. \That this is true is demonstrated by those college men who have taken up life insurance, for they have shown that the college man is fit for this kind of a job and that the job also is fit for the college man. \The work of the life insurance salesman -is dis• tinguished by independence and opportunity :for di· recting his own activities. It gives all possible oppor• tunity for individual initiative and a chance to make an ample income at an age when most fellows .are struggling on a wage pittance.\ for individuals, businesses and institutions. The life insurance agent is indispensable to the con· duct of modem affairs, and in a particularly satisfac• tory way. He is an active force in increasing che sum of human happiness, prosperity and security, Your Company Now is the time to consider what you are goihg to do after graduation. If you are ambitious, willing to work hard, and are interested to know about a life insurance career, you owe it to yourself to examine the opportuniti~s afforded by. the John 'Hancock Mutua! Life Insurance Company. It -is a national institution with a country· wide service, of great financial strength,-one of the large companies of the world. Ask your questions of lis before mak• ing final decision. OF BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS 65th year of business. Insurance in force, $2,764,331,561.00.

Steimnetz. Since Dr. Steinmetz' death, -tlte ma- chine has been remaining i11 his for- mer residence but has now been pre- sented to the college by his adopted son, Mr. J. L. Hayden. This electrostatic machine is one of the largest of the Toepler- Holtz type which was ever made, .consisting mainly of twelv; very large glass plates adapted for rotati.on, and mounted in a splendid case wi'th nu· merous accessories. The gift represents a very real ad· clition to the equipment of the plws· ics department, and is the more ht- teresting because of its use by 1]')r, Steinmetz. ----OJ---- NOTICE TO SENIORS Members of the senior ,cla_ss may get tl1eir caps and gowns Th.tnsday, Frida-y, or Sa:turday at the Phi Dr! ta Theta Hause.

President Richmond spoke of the influence of tradition and of its value to the collegc. He also spoke of the pt·acticality of Union's methods in up· holding and promoting education and athle-tics, and of the effect of Union's campus, traditions and spirit upon all who remain· in the c.ollege for four years or longer. 1fr. Lar,.dreth, a member of the class of '8I, next talked about Union College as it was when he first en- tered it. He spoke of his interest in all Union activitieq and of the confi- dence he had in a· Union man. \Vhen Mr. Landreth had finished, the group went into Silliman hall, where Charley Waldron gave a short talk on college traditions, and told several interesting stories concerning them. He praised the success of the Block U dh111er and spoke of it as a11 example of an ~ld spirit in a new form. ----0---- Tennis Team Beaten But Peets Keeps Slate Clean Kern Well Suppoi\ted Kern received excellent support after the second inning from his team- mates who erred in the first two in- nings to allow the four runs for the New Bru.nswick team. Union made the tieing run in the fifth as a result of a single, a double and a passed ball. The end came in the twelfth inning when with the score tied at four all, Less Terry hit to center an.d advanced to third on Girard's attempted sacri- fice that Hibbs fumbled and after the bases had been filled by McDowell's free pass to first, scored on Gribbon's long fly to left field. Union won its sixth consecutive game from R. P. I. Saturday when the Garnet nine overcame a long lead of the Cheny and White to win by two runs after Kern had been put into the garne to help stave off any more tallies. Rensselaer hit Hawes hard in the first three innings, scoring nine runs from the Garnet southpaw. Hawes made costly errors in the field which subsequently allowed four runs to score and his teammates were poor in their .throwing the ball around with score II to 7 in favor of R. P. I.

Maloney TUESDAY .,MAY 15, [ 9 28 A THEATRE ON THE CAMPUS The MountebanKs have been relied upon to furnish supplcmenbl.ry entertainment for the an- nual festivities of the sophomores and juniars during the past eight years. Previous to 1920 the productions of the dramatic society were Rtagl'd independently in the gymnasium and fol- lowed bv a dance until thev were removed to a downtm~·n plaJhousc in ordt•r t·~ attain a regular thett h·e atmosphere. Tl1e prese11t arnmgem<>nts render the Mounte- banks a pU!·el;v suj>plcmentary and temporarily organized body entirelv inadequate for students who are srriously interested in the drama. The efforts of six we~ks of hard training by both the members and the director now result in a comcdv prouuction peescntcd ordinat·ily in a commerci~l theatre with sets supplied by professionals and put in place hy a hired stage crew. These condi- tions are entirely out of keeping with the interest in the drama which exists among the members of the student body. A change from the present policy is nerC'ssar,\· .in order to furnish plays which will bear the inereR.singly critira:l tastes of the audimces. An.v effort. to improve the quality of produc- tions using the present system would involve the <·xpemlitun• of a p;1·eat deal more money than is npp1·opriah•d from tht• acti\·ities' fees for dramat- i<·s. The answer seems rather to lie in the estab- lislumnt of n theatre on tl1e campus. Smh a solution would permit the Mountebanks to lm•o!ne a permanently aC'tive organization. :\lore phys could llc gin•n and more men would lun!' an opportunit:v to excrc.ise their talent. Bills of om-act. plays and serious plavs could b<- pl'e- M·nted at intenals tl11·oughout the year and the rd tu·ns from such I lc't'formances could be used to ~tage the comedy ]ll'O<luctions for Soiree and Prom in a dowutown t lll'atre if it were necessary to do sD in order to ac<.'omodate the audiences. The classes stud~·ing the drama would have an oppor- tunity to present plays representative of periodi- cal Ut•nlopuient of the modern theatre and the t·ducational value 0f the appreciation of the drama and its influeneC' would be greatly increased. l\Iost satisfying of ail the advantages of a theatre on the campus is the possibility of a cast's pre- sent-ing more than one performance of a play after it has been cnrefully rehearsed for a long time. The ros.t of renting commercial tl1eatres makes such a practice impossible now, however desirable it might bP. Be:-;ides the advantages to the acting members of the organization fl. campus theatre would pro- vide a l1thoratm·y for experiment in scenic and lighting effects 1t11d types of staging for students interested in the technique of production. At the meeting of the executive board of the l\Iounkbanks ami students interested in dramatics held on 11a v 7 lo discuss the possibility of a theatre on the campus several different sugges- tions were offe.rcd. ..A committee composed of rep- I ~Let TheGrecianDreamll In the Concordiensis issue of May 4th :we thought a hatchet had :been h11r.ied under -a heap of \supposes\ with the tomb stone \Quer-ulous\ erected .to commem- on~te the gr-eat occasion, but we discovered that in :burying the hat~het the sextons unearthed a battle aKc to usc for -the next w-eek.

The next issue, that is :May St:h, br0ug'ht the battle axe into play and attempted to down the t-rack team and the athletic policy of t·he coHcge, but the wielder of the battle a::-:;e neglected to observe the warning of the pr-evious isst~c. }Joe did not discr-iminate \between objective facts -or .tntths ~-nd fantas-tics constructions of his imagination.\ :Much advice was 11anded to the directors of Union's athletic policy, 1but the advice would seem to come :in the category of fantastic constructions of one's mimi. Certa-inly there were very few .facts offered, and a conspicuous lack of know'ledge concerning track and lacrosse schedules was evinced. The track manager would have been al>le, and probably willing to have informed the adV-ice-givers of a few truths pertaining to track schedules. :It seems to rankle in some people's minds that the track team has been undefeated. Im- mediately they shout about \beatabie opponents.\ Per- haps it would have been well to find the facts about the track and lacrosse schedules. It might have been well to find how many of those desirable and we sup- pose, unbeatable teams would meet Union. It might have been well to consul-t the lacrosse manager about the teams tha-t were foisted upon the lacrosse schedule. A few facts as to ac-tual conditions as they exist would disclose a little different story than that which we r.ead last Tuesday. But then why not tell the managers of teams and the director of athletics and the fact1lty committee on athletics how to make up schedules? 'Why not send to them a list of a few of those much desired teams tha·t do not appear on the schedule? \t\'hy not find out the facts before criticising the athletic department's policy, and then when a criticism is due a team, why not call that team by name instead of saying \one major sport\? * * * *· Mustaches are sprouting on the lips o-f certain soph- omores in the hope that the said growth will be in full bloom by Satmday.

It is your bounden duty to fulfill the hopes of those who have labored that this might be so. You have pmved to the retiring Council that you are the seven men of your class who are most worthy ·of this honor, through your leadership in campus activi- ties. Now we expect you to carry on and wield well such powers as it is our privilege to bestow. Tomorrow Moving- Up day may have lost the significance which it holds for us now. The eyes of the throng will not be upon you to cheer you on to greater glory, and your work must be done for the most part with- out recognition. Your reward will come a year from this day when, if you have car- ried on the labors of this office to the best of your ability, you will feel the pride in achievement which is the truest return for the good you may do for your fellow man. And at that time may you leave this school with as sincere a satisfaction in having left behind seven worthy men, as we feel at this time. For three years you have carried the standards of honor and clean sport within these walls and it gives me great pleasure to present you with what meager reward we can. May your future be as bright as your past and may you never fail to keep the tra~ ditions of the Terrace Council. DONALD F. HYLAND. ECHO Through the courtesy of C. L.

The Rochester team should not fm·nish very strong opposition for the second baseball ·game of t:he Prom attractions today. 'In the last of its string of ,five games last week, the .'\J.

Tl1e Scarlet team, which has bern beatPn but once this se-ason, went up to \Vest Point after adding another victory by defeating Stevens, 7 to 3, Saturday. Hobart defeated St. Lawrence last Saturday in the last home game Qf the season. The St. La wrencc team also lost to Dartmouth, but won over \Villiams, 3 to o. The St. Lawrence game next week is the last on 'Union's Iacross<\ schedule. Harvard's stickmcn won a close match m·er Spring- fidd this week at Cambridge. The Colgate tennis team which played Union yes- trrday came hrre after l1aving faHecl to score in a match against the Navy and having lost to U. ·of P,, R to I. The U aroon opposition was very weak as comparrd to tlm.t which Union received in N~w York last week. The \Villiams nctmen appear to be as strong this yrar as they wrre last when ,they carried off the New England championships. In the first game after the l'nion match, tltcy defeated Ro.wdoin, 7 to 2, \:V rslC'yan met defeat at ~heir hands, 6 to 3, and the Yale team was downed by a 5 to 4 score last Saturday.

Hall TUESDAY, MAY 22, 1928 STUDENT OPINIO~ ln its last t'cgular bmincss meeting l\Iomlay, }f:w l.J., tlw Student Body went on recor<l as fa,·~ring tlw building of ; hockey rink on the campus. ,J nst what significance this action hold,;, insofar as recognition by those in authority is <'011C'l'rmd, is difficult to prophesy, The Student Body has in times past drrla.red itself on certain i'ssuPs an~l its ultimatum has been discreetly shdH<L This last stand, however, warrants a mmP co.rdial reception because it seeks to provide .fo1· thL· euntinuaJH'l' of a soldy undergraduate ac- tivity, one of the most popular on the campus and on(' whieh offl•rs exceptional prospects for attain- ing national athletic prominence. That hockey is one of the most popular sports on tlll' campus, SPVC'ra.l well understood facts will nt h·st. The Student Bod.r wn.s practically unani- Jnous in its rrsolution. The sport has never been foi'eed to beg for support, either active or parti- sall, ::\'ot all of our present sports can boast a similar record. An exceptional wealth of former prt•p school stars has enabled the Garnet hockey team::; to acquit themsdn•s with credit in the past ag-ninst. some of the best college aggregations in this part of the country. The lack of pmctice told heavily in last year's contests, but the spirit an<l fight with whieh this sport has become synony- illous pro'\'Nl nearly as important a factor ·as ad- va 11ced preparation. Jiuman nature craYes an exhibition of spirited playing. The rise of football to a popularity in t•Xcl'ss evPn of the national pastime is one obvious JH'<Jof of this fact. Hockey, like lacrosse and football, nffPrs just those opportunities for the display of coUJ·age an<l mrve which the sporting dl'mt>nt demandH. During the last few years, pro- ft'iHional lwck<'y hal-l 1·isen much more rapidly in t!.J<' public's t'Hh'Pill than an.v contemporary sport. But hockPy iH a Hport .. in which the spirit of the rtlltlth·ur, with its passionatP thirst for competi- tion nnd .its zralous low of fair play, will always [)(' ~u }ll'{'llle.

CORNELL when prom ar-rived and not a few who wer-e .pleased when it was a th·ing of the past. It ar>pears that the .prom committee succeed·ed reasonably welil in satisfy- ing the desires of the prom trotters -in so far as it was within tl1eir sphere to d-o so, and with the \\sistance of fair ()r supposedly fair visitors, and' rcfrcshmen-~s not ostensibly included on the prom menu, -the week end passed happily or othcm·ise. It was a sad Jolt to gt't back to classes. * * * * The seniors tried out their caps and gowns SahHday amid discussions 9n which side to wear the tassel. Sort of a practice performance for the e\·ents to come. * * * * The seven juniors wlw were to be tapped and a few others attended the moving up day exercises, and eight or ten freshmen burned their caps, and someone threw some white paint at the idol, and mo\·ing up day was over. * * * * \Ve suppose classes just previous to chapel will be prolonged this wPek to use up the customary chapel period, not that we've got enough religion to last us the rest of the year. * * * * The column this week constitutes the last of the series under the present writer. It cannot be said that the finish of the task is viewed with a feeling of regret, and if you have been tired of reading them or seeing them in the Concordy remPmber you haye had a com- panion in misery for it has not been an altogether pleasant pastime trying to write something with noth- ing to say. Some have remarked that the ('ditors of the Con- cordy should be thanked for printing some of the articles, ali of which may be true. It is not our inten- tion however to thank any one for printing them for we did not care whether they were printed or not, but we may express our appreciation to the editors for printing them in unexpurgated editions. During the past year we have expressed various opinions ·in the column, some of which haYe not been particularly popular and others which have been more generally accepted. ln expressing these opinions we have attempted to giye one view at least on topics which have been generally l)isc;1ssed abo11t the campus. \Ve cannot say that our views ·have always been the correct ones, but at least it can be said that they have been unadulterated, an!) we have attempted to obtain the correct facts from which to draw those views. We have aroused the ire of certain persons on the .campus, e.vcn as tl1cy ha\·e aroused ours. We have no apologies to make as we merely presented opinions for the read- rs to take Ol' leave as they chose, believing that every- one has a right to an opinion. The column, whate\'er may be its name, will have a new author or authors ne·xt yPar and to them we wish success in their venture, in the hope that the Concordy and its columns may continue to prosper.
