So on his first visit to New York, his cousins watched with some amuse- nlent his amazed delight as the Otis Elevator whisked them to the top of one of the highest buildings. They looked forward to witnessing his thrill as he stepped out on the hal~ cony which overlooked the vast pan- orama of lower New York. To their disappointment he seemed to lose interest as soon as they left the elevator. \Look down\ they said to him, \You've never seen anything like this in Switzerland! \ Bernard shrugged his shoulders. \This is all very well, but my own mountains are much higher. If you don't mind, I'll spend my afternoon going up and down in those elev'ators. It is not the height of these buildings which I find impressive; it is the fact that we don't have to climb to the top of them! \ THE METROPOLITAN BUILDING, New York, is one of the earlier tall build- ings, but its dignity and pleasing lines make it a favorite, and it is hard to realize that the top of the tower is some six hundred feet above the side- walk. In the tower pardon of the building there are six (6) Otis Gearless Traction Machines, running at 600 Feet P':r l\'finute. In the main part of the building, the old high pressure hydraulic elevators are being replaced by twenty- nine (29) Otis qearless Traction Micro Drive Elevators of the latest type. 0 T I s E L E VAT 0 R C 0 M PAN Y Offices iu all Principal Cities of the World

Into the making of this one cigarette goes .all of the ability of the world's largest or sanitation of expert tobacco men. Nothing is too good for Camels. The choicest Ttwkisn and domestic tobaccos. The most skilful blenders. The most scientific package. No other cigarette made is like Camels. No finer cigarette can be niade. Camels are the o'l'erwhelming choice of experienced smokers; WHEN the thrilling second act has come to an end. And you joln the crowds outside just as p~::a3-::d ancl thrilled as yourseH-h~ve a Ca:nd! For no other friend is so cheerful, so resting between acts as c~md. Camel adds its own romantic ~;' 1mour to the bl'ightn.;:ss of memm.-:!ble o::ca3iorts. No '?ther cigarette ever made- and. kept-so many friends. Camels never tire your taste, no matt:cl.\ how liberally you smoke them. Camels never leave a ci.garetty after-taste. So when you leave the theatr,c pleased and inspired for greater things ---,taste the mellowest ·smoke that ever came from a cigarette. Have a Camel! Our highest wish, if you do not yet know Camel qttality, is that you try them. We invite you to compare Camels with any cigarette made at any price. R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Co.
