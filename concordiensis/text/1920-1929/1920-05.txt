Y. The Service of an Electrical Research Laboratory The research facilities of the General Elec.:tnc Company are an asset of world-wide importan~e. as recent war work has so clearly demonstrated. Their advantages in pursuits of peace made them of inestimable value in time of war. A most interesting story tells of the devices evolved which S1:.b- stantially aided in solving one of the most pressing problems of tlle war-the submarine menace. Fanciful, but no less real, were the results attained in radio communication which enabled an aviator to control a fleet of flying battleships, and made possible the sending, without a wire, history-making messages and orders tQ ships at sea. Scarcely less important was the X-ray tube, specially designed for field hospital use and a notable contribution to t:he military surgical service. And many other products, for both :::om- batant and industrial use, did their full share in securing the victory. In the laboratories are employed highly trained physicists, chemists, metallurgists and engineers, some of whom are experts of inter~ national reputation. These men are working not only to convert the resources of Nature .to be of service to man, but to inc•·ease the usefulness of electricity ia every line of endeavor. Their achievements benefit every individual wherever electricity is used. Scientific research works hand in hand with the development of new devices, more efficient apparatus and processes of manufacture. It results in the discovery of better and more useful materials and ul ti- mately in making happier and more livable the life of all mankind, Booklet, Y-863, describing the company's plants, will be mailed upon request.

The dra\ving up of a Moral Code 1 for the race from time to time, Pro- fessor Palmer considered as being a good thing to do.

In closing, Pro- fessor Palmer expressed his apprecia- tion of the raft attention that his audi- ences had given him and hoped that; he had succeeded in arousing an inter- i est in his hearers in the cultivation of their inner lives.

Greater X-ray Service--- through Research F OR years after the discovery of X-rays it was evident that only intensive research could unfold their real possibilities. Meanwhile, scientists of the General Electric Company developed the pro- cess of making wr:ought tungsten. This proved ideal as the target in X-ray • tubes and its use for this purpose soon became universal. Then further research resulted in the development of an X-ray tube of a radically new type - the Coolidge Tube- with both electrodes of wrought tungsten and containing the h~ghest attainable vacuum. But the complication of ·high-vacuum pumps made the new tube in large General Office ~chenecta~NX Self- redif;,ing, Radiator· type Coolidge X-ray Tube quantities impossible. The answer to this problem was the Langmuir Con- densation Pump, utilizing mercury vapor. in its operation and almost automatic. To meet the need for simple X-ray apparatus during the war, the G- E Laboratory developed the Self-Recti- fying Coolidge Tube, which made possible portable outfits at the front. The latest X-ray outfit of this type is so small it can be taken convec niently to the home or to the bedside in the hospital. Thus the Research Laboratory of the General Electric Company continues to serve, that progress in things elec- trical may continue for the good of humanity.

In order to hold a scholarship at the College it is necessary for a student to maintain an average grade of 80 per cent in the studies of any semester. }'ailure to achieve that grade involves the tem- porary withdrawal <Jf the scholarship.

From all re- ports the opponents, the Syracuse team, are very good men. Last Sat- urday they played Colgate-the .final score resulting in a tie (3-3). Rain prevented them from meeting Annap- olis although they made the trip. Yes- terday the Orange played R. P. I. at Troy.

Goff, Huested, and Gilbert have all been working this week and there is some doubt on the campus as to which one will be on the mound. The remain<;ler of the line-up will no doubt be identical with that of for- mer games. Bartley did not make the trip because he sprained his ankle Wednesday in practice and is not able to use his foot yet. No doubt either Fink or Tracy will hold down the third bag. There may be some other shake-up in the line-up due to ] oe Brucker's injury to his finger in the Edison Club game. This Hamilton ga.me is th.e last game on this year's schedule which is to be played away frotn home. All the remaining games are to be fought out on Alexander Field.

G General Office Schenectady. NY. Utilizing Nature's Power E LECTRICAL energy generated by water power has grown to be one of our greatest natural resources- and we have only begun to reach its possibilities. It mines and refines our ores, turns the wheels of industry, drives ou1· street cars and lights our cities and towns. The power obtained from Nature saves many million tons of coal every year. At first the field of its utilization was limited by the dis, tance electricity could be transported. But soon research and engineering skill pointed the way to larger and better electrical apparatus necessary for nigh-voltage 'trans- mission. Then ingenious devices were invented to insure protection against lightning, short-circuits, etc., which cause damage and interrupt the service. And now all over \'the country a network .of wires begins to appear, carry- ing the ma~ic power. The General Electric Company, with its many years'· ex- perience, has played a great part in hydro-electric develop- ment. By successfully co-ordinating the inventive genius of the company and its engineering and manufacturing abilities, it has accomplished some of the. greatest achieve- ments in the oroduction and applJcauon of electrical energy. The old mill wheel of yesterday has gone. Today the forces of immense volumes of water are harnessed and sent miles away to. su.pply the needs of industry and business and the comforts of the home, I any E) tr1 Sales Offices in all large cities. 95·l39D

Olympiad has fumished to youth from time immemorial-and .those games go Lack almost into the prehistoric mists <-that they were so important in das- 10ic days and are cwming to mean so much in modern times. In former Olympic games, the Uni- ted States has taken so prominent a part that the American team this year will be watched with utlUsual interest The man who \goes out for\ the by the thousands of spectators who American Olympic team,is an inspira- will crowd tlile stacliun1 in Ant\verp.

It is an encouraging commentary up- on American life that vvorkmen, schcl- ars, millionaire sportsmen, or business mene can make the Arnerican Olympic team. That shows there is ample op- portunity for any American, through the scientific application of his lei~ure time, to win the highest honors in the athletic worl'd. Granted that there is just a little too rnuch emphasis upon the star system it1 American amateur athletics, the fact remains that more and more people are being drawn into recreation and sports. Every kid in a playground, every man on a university track, every worker who uses a com- munity center can develop himself. It's a fair field -for all that the American Olympic Committee offers t<=! American atUetes. re-presentative young men oi individual· commun1ttes.

I If \Vaterloo ·was won on the playing· fields of Eton and Harrow, much more; so will the Antwerp Olympiad have been won on the gridiron or the play- · ground.

DONAHUE 240--244 State Street Utilizing Nature's Power E LECTRICAL energy generated by water power has grown to be one of our greatest natural resources- and we have only begun to reach its possibilities. It mines and refines our ores, turns the wheels of industry, drives our street cars and lights our cities and towns. The power obtained frmn Nature saves many million tons of coal every year. At first the field of its utilization was limited by the dis., tance electricity could be transported. But soon research and engineering skill pointed the way to larger and better electrical apparatus necessary for high-voltage trans- mission. Then ingenious devices were invented to insure protection against lightning, short-circuits, etc., which cause damage and interrupt the service. And now ail over the country a network of wires begins to appear, carry- ing the magic power. The General Electric Company, with its many years' ex- perience, has played a great part in hydro-electric develop- ment. By successfully co-ordinating the inventive genius of the company and its engineering and manufacturing abilities, it has accomplished some of the ~:;reatest achieve- ments in the nroduction and application of electrical energy. The old mill wheel of yesterday has gone. Today the forces of immense volumes of water are harnessed and sent miles away to supply the needs of industry and business and the comforts of the home. 1 Consider for a minute the make-up of former American Olymp:ic teams. Men from aU corners of the United ~ tates, frotn all professions and call- ings, have been selected. The success of the An1erican teams in earlier Olympads speaks pretty well for the geographical distribution of stamina, fair play a11d sportsmanship through- out the United States. To carry this idea of geographical distribution a lit- tle further, it is :inspiring to see that winners of the different vents come from so many nations.

In general defending scholarship and apolo- gizing for it, even in our colleges, is a surviving crudity of American life. Peoples that have really arrived in the refinements of life consider such an attitude toward scholarship a gross and imperti- plished something in their moments is the function of he class-room and of relaxation, of good not only to h01· urs inf· sthudy to provid_e.

An unknown friend of Bryn Mawr sends us the questions in the \Examination in General Information\ held at the college on the thirteenth of this month. vVe wish we could print it all here-1nore, we wish that we could pass it. Unfortunately, we have space only for a fe\v scattering questions, which will inuicate its range: 1. Name the Twelve Apostles. 2. \Vhat is Article X? 3. Indicate by a diagram the shape of Orion. 7. Give a recipe for making bread. 11. How many toes has a dog? STAY FOR COMMENCEMENT. Every year as soon as examinationsn are over there is a rush for home. With the exception of the seniors there are few students indeed that remain for commencement week. The hurried exodus is natural in many ways; after a year of studying, one is eager to chang-e the scene. There are two important reasons, however, why Union men should stay for commencement. First, because they will enjoy it. Strange as it may seem, there are many men in college who have never seen a single commencement. These men are neglecting an opportunity, to have a good time. If possible, they should stay over this year and see what is in store for them.
