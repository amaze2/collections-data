What junior Prom Guests Will Find In Once again it is Union's pleasure to welcotne iair guests to its Picture Theatres About Town halls; to be brightened by their smiles and favored by their presence. Many generations of students have bade fair guests welcome to Un- ia>n, yet none have been as welcome as those who attend the 1922 Prom. Generations of fair guests have come to Union, yet none mon fair than those who grace college halls this year. The J ttnior Prom is the one great social event to which col- lege students look with the highest expectancy. It is a high point in the career o£ every Union man; a memorable event from which future happenings may be elated. The pleasure of the Prom will never be dimmed; its memory will never fade; its glory never be forgotten. So too, will be the Prom guests be remembered.

Your sea-shell ears appeal to me, Pun-hidden 'neath a wave\. I have a confession. to make. I am possessed with a poetical muse (that's a-muse-ing), which bothers me. (It'll bother you still more as you go on.) It seizes me occasi(!)oally (some day it'H choke me), and [ must needs give vent t.o my thougl1 ts. Some of the verses have a style of their own~but I insist that I had a poetic license (its almost a liberty) to 1nake them that way. L·ikewise I had my nerve.

There's no theme to my lay. My head's is a whirl Over you, tittle girl, That's how I got this way. A HOLY SONG-THE ROSARY Hickory, dicl<ory, dock, I found a hole in my sock.

Y ou can hold a firefly in your hand; you can boil water with an electric lamp. Nature long ago evolved the \cold light. \ The firefly, according to I ves and Coblentz, radiates ninety-six percent light and only four percent heat. Man's best lamp radiates more than ninety percent heat. An English physicist once said that if we knew the fire- fly's secret, a boy turning a crank could light up a whole street. Great as is the advance in lighting that has been made through research within the last twenty years, man wastes far too much energy in obtaining light. This problem of the \cold light\ cannot be solved merely by trying to improve existing power-generating machinery and existing lamps. We should still be burning candles if chemists and physicists had confined their resear~hes to the improvement of materials and methods for making candles. For these reasons, the Research Laboratories of the General Electric Company are not limited in the scope of their investigations. Research consists in framing questions of the right kind and in finding the answers, no matter where they may lead. What makes the firefly glow? How does a firefly's light differ in color from that of an electric arc, and why? The answers to such questions may ·Or may not be of,practical value, but of this we may be sure-it is by dC>vetailing the results of \theoretical\ investigations along many widely separated lines that we arrive at most of our modern \practical\ discoveries. What will be the light of the future? Will ~t be like that of the firefly or like that of the dial on a luminous watch? Will it be produced in a lamp at present undreamed of, or will it come from something resembling our present incan- descent lamp? The answers to these questions will depend much more upon the results ofresearch in put\e science than upon strictly commercial resean~h. e 1 trio General Office Schenectady, N.Y. 915·38~ D Barney Shoes of Worth A good shoe tells its quality story AFTER, not during, its few weeks of service.

Last Appearance Saturday Repeated and apparently unanswered appeals urging· sl11de1tt in- terest in phases of colleg·c life uther than studies and the cl.evotion of spare moments to campus act.ivities rather than ontsicle attrac- tions, naturally lead to the conclusion that there must he something vvrong, 01- if not \Vrong, something lacking in the present stu~clent I body. Leaders of various campus activities have hcen heard to com- i plain uf the difficulty uf obtaining men to carry un the \\.'()rk of or-: ganizations. Societies which have dra·wn the interest of Cnio11 men t I for a hundrecl years have apparently become almost obsolete since• the recent war. If they clo function at all it is with such irregt:::!'larity and mediocre results as to make their existence seem almost a !i,·ing death. EYirlences show that there is a general lack of interest in campus life and that while the scholarship standard ancl sttlldent calibre may be constantly becoming higher, there is a deci.ded cle-i crease in that invalnal)le something known as .\college Sj)irit\ and'' its inevitable result, campus acti Yities. Lack uf interest in college life cannot be blamed en.!iFely to increased stringency in scholarship rulings. The primarJ' reason for the presence of a man at Union is educational development and anvthino- that will tend to augment his opportunities :for r~al hain- ~ b ing is necessarily worthy. Nor can the lack be placed at tl1ce other door of increased study hours. Ttue lessons have become 111o:re di:f~ ficult, assignments longer, courses broader in scope and the a11tount of application needed much greater. It is also true that reviseci col- :lege regulations have confined students with an almost prep school rigidity. [ t is still more true that the student now att1ae-ted to union is mercenarily ambitious, thirsty for knowlegde and training from early school days to apply himself intensively to lessol:ls. \DOUW\ BEEKlVIAN Holder of 16-lb.

Union's idol fight, however, is the an- cient custom of a more ancient :institution and stands unique as a collegiate underclass stn1ggle. The scrap does m~ch to the in- dividual man to show his worth and the joy in victory or in having the scrap over is a feeling which can be experienced in no other way. I :>.11 c· mtest were introduced as a Moving-Up day contest, a scrap ~here is reason to believe, also, that if either the tug-of-war or push might result after all. Victory in either contest depends upon an umpire's decision, there is opportunity for argument and it is very possible that the only means of determining the winner in a close decision would be to have the classes fight it . out. Hence, the modernized contests might create an even worse scrap than that which now exists.

S UPPOSE that a stove bums too much coal for the amou.i'lt of heat that it radiates~ The manufacturer hires a man familiar · w~th the principles of combustion and heat radiation to make experiments which will indicate desirable changes in design. The stove selected as the most efficient is the resuit of research. Suppose that you want to make a ruby in a factory-not a mere imitation, but a real ruby, indistinguishable by any chemical or physical .test from the natural stone. You begin by analyzing rubies chemically- and physically. Then you try to make rubies just as nature did, with the same chemicals and under similar conditions. Your rubies are the result of research-research of a different type from that required to improve the stove. Suppose, as you melted up your chemicals to produce rubies and experimented with high temperatures, you began to wonder how hot the earth must have been millions of years ago when rubies we-re first crystallized, and what were the forces at play that made this planet what it is. You begin an investigation that leads you far from rubies and causes you to formulate theories to explain how the earth, and, for that matter, how the whole sol'ar system was created. That would be research of a still different type-pioneering into the unknown to satisfy an insatiable curiosity. Research of all three types is conducted in the Laboratories of the General Electric Company. But it is the third type of research- pioneering into the unknown-that means most, in the long run, even though it is undertaken with no practical benefit in view. At the present time, for example, the .Research Laboratories of the General Electric Cornpan,y are exploring matter with X-rays in. order to discover not only how the atoms in different substances are arranged but how the atoms themselves are built up. The more you know abotLt a substance, the more you can do with it. Some day this X-ray work will enable scientists to answer more definitely than they can now the question: Why is iron magnetic? And then the elec- trical industry will take a great step forward, and more real progress will be made in five years than can be made in a century of experi- menting with existing electrical apparatus. You can add wings and stories to an old house. But to build a new house. you must begin with the foundation. Genera ~eneral Office COnl. 1 • tr1c Schenectady, N.Y.

Graham '23 and A. Hoadley '23 Satul'lday, May 21, 1921 THE PRESIDENT'S PRAISE Dr. Richmond's frank statement at student meeting Monday to the effect that this has been the happiest and best of his 12 years with the college, may be taken as full indication that the disappoint- ing influences of the war period ar'e past and that the college ha:s truly returned to the even tenor of its ways. However, it cannot be believed that Union has returned to its old way; progress is too readily apparent. The year has seen Union placed in a larger position in the col- legiate wo.rld. The activities of the Radio club have extended Un- ion's sphere of influence materially. The results of their work may be perhaps best summed up in the words of a Schenectady citizen, who speaking of the club and its activities said, \Those young men are ahead of their times\. It may be truly said that other college functions have also been extended in scope, notably debating, drama- tics, musical clubs and athletics. Union is iast winning a high re .. putation as a debating college; the dramatic presentations this year easily outstripped any previous productions in a number of ways; the musical clubs have become a ilourishing organization; and athletics, while possibly not as successful as could be desired in re- gards to scores and victories, have at least shown the collegiate world that Union can pwduce sportsmanlike, :fighting unbeaten teams. Scholarship too, has soared in a remarkable degree and there is every reason to feel that both faculty and student body have pro fitted thereby. Given a \vell-prepared entering class next fall; an increased in and Chooses Office-rs The final meeting o fthe Clas-sical club was held Monday night at the home of Dr. G. D. Ke1logg. T1he newly· elected officers are: .president, Joh11 C. Collins '22; vice-president, Harold D. Friedmq;n '22; secretary and treasUI-er, }ohn M. Cantwell '22. A paper on \The Ah Remains of Pompeii\ was read by CoUins, and plans for the CD'm- ing year were made. • Alumnus Establishes Scholarship Award The Rev. Andrew W.
