Editor of The Coneordiensis: Under a more or less thorough ::;cru\ tiny, this thing !mown as CollP?;P Spirit appears as nothing· more than a naive Rotarianism, which, in turn, is mere blatant optimism. College Spirit, like Rotarianism, shuts its eye::; to disillusioning· facts and drowns complaint in desperate and insinceTe enthusiasm. The Alumni donation for an im- posing· athletic arena has been a p- plauded as a sacrifice on the rever-ed a lt.<lr of College Spirit; Union will TI()W compare in athletic resources with larg·er educational institutions. : Hurrah!

And they call for Camels. Never in any age was there a smoking favorite like Camel is today. Camels understand every mood of the modern smoker. Camel mildness and smoothness are supreme with the critical taste of present-day people. A purchase of Camels brings you the choicest Turkish and Do\ mestic tobaccos. Blended by skill into the world's most popular smoke, and the best. Quality unQ approached, is the distinguishing mark of CameL No matter what the price, there is no better cig:arette than Camels. \\ Smoke them as frequentiy as you please. You will never be left with a cigaretty after-taste. Camels aren't made that \'lay. That is why modern smokers everywhere de- mand them.

You get what we mean the minute you tamp a load of this wonderful tobacco into the bowl of your jimmy-pipe and make fire. with a match. Cool as a northeast bedroom. Sweet as a note from the Girl of Girls. Fragrant as a wood~ land trail. Prince Albert never bites your tongue or parches your throat, no matter how fast you feed it. You'll smhke pipe-load on pipe-load with never a regret. Buy a tidy red tin of P. A. today. Throw back the hinged lid and breathe deeply of that real tobacco aroma. Then • • • tuck a neat wad into the business-end of your jimmy-pipe and light up. Now you have it ••• that taste!

I for one am about to do my bit by feE'bly suggesting that it be made a ma- jor support, at the expense of baseball. If, however, my suggestion is a bit too .radical, I might mal>:e anotller: why not put aH sperts on the same basis and be done with all this wiggle and wobble a·bout majors and min- ors? Ho long as there are any sports at all at Union, as'ide, of course, fron1 t·rack, I see no reason for favoring one or two more than the rest. There is, however, very little cli.ance that either of 1 my .suggestions wHI be even. considered. In case anyone , is interested to know \V•hy I have changed m-y attitude from one of amused indifference to athletics to the one expressed above, I might say that it is the result of a long series o.f revelations which have at last convinced me that the Lacrasse team has held, is holding, and, ·I from all indications, will continue to hold the dirty end of the stick in 'Union's athletic .program. I I I am appa:l:led at my own seriousness! I humbly I apologize to those who started to l'ead this column in 1 the hope that, in one way or anotheJ', they 'vould be 1 amused. I hasten, therefore, to add that real'ly, 'way I down deep in my heart, as it were, I really do not care a whoop whether or not Lacrosse is played with swords or candle sticks, or whether any sport is played at all, for that matter. 'rhe whole matter of athletics seems to me a bit of a bore, especially because of the l1avoc it plays with the very small amount of intelligent .con- versation which might otherwise be heard upon the/ campus. I I have recently had a terrible shock. I have learned~ that a member of the faculty has written an \Aprre- I ciation of What-Of-It? and is surreptitiously showing I it to his friends and hugely enjoying the resulting cackles II of Academic mirth. The shock came, however, not from the realization that I was being ironically assailed from i Regal can duplicate aJ ,y Style you'll see anywhere at any PRICE, in this .';:own or any other city from New York to Sa11 Francisco.

The conduct of the students has in the past month become markedly worse; we are surprised that the members in charge have been able to keep their tempers for ~o lo~g a time. Our attitude has been decidedly exasperatmg, dis- courteous, a.nd indicates no deference to recognized authority. the rear, but from the discovery that the particular I -----------~---------====::---------~ author was sufficiently interested in the column to I 'l\he Chapel, let it be remembered, was dedicated as a place of worship for t:he college and not as an annex to the College Union. Whether or not undergraduates agree with the college custom of holding daily religious services, they should have the decency and courtesy to refrai11 from the loud cenversation, u.ndignified conduct and late arrival which now characterizes their brief stay in tile building. One of the aims of a college is the de- velopment of men into gentlemen. The chapel exercises a1·e an excellent op,Dortunity to practice being a gentle- man and we suggest that the students make a greater use .of it. The college, as President Richmond has intimated, write anything at aH, since I happen to kn()1V that it 1 is his opinion that no one under fifty, and with less I than sixteen letters after his . name, should ever, under any circumstances, write anything at all.

MODERN smokers find in Camels a nicety of blending, a friendly cordiality of flavor, an inherent goodness that thrills from the first puff to the last. That is why Camels are the favorite of the present age. The warmth of golden sunlight or autumn fields gleams in their smoke. Camels· are the modern expression of aU that is the finest. Camel quality and Camel excel- len.:e are recognized wherever modern smokers gather. Particu- lar smokers in this hard-to-please age find the best of Turkish and Domestic tobaccos blended in this famous cigarette. They find a con· sistent goodness that never fails, no matter how liberal the smoking. And wherever modern smokers gather, wherever the conversation turns to tobacco, to the world;s best, someone is sure to say: ~~speaking of fine tobaccos -H aye a Camel!\ R. J.
