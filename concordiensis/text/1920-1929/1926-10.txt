With the hemispherical integrator the illuminating engineer measures light intensities and distribution. These laboratory iindinj1s are pulctical/y applied to improve our everyday iDumination. When the sun goes down The Genetal Electric Company is the world's largest manufacturer of incandescent lamps. And behind the G-E MAZDA lamps are vast research laboratories dedicated to cheaper and better electric illumination, and to the conservation of eyesight. ---- A sedes of G-E adver- tisements showing wha'fl electricity is doing in many fields will be sent on request. Ask for booklet GEK-1. More than 350,000,000 incandescent lamps, with a combined light of nine billion candlepower, make city streets, stores, and homes brighter than ever before. In bungalow or mansion, workshop or factory, dormitory or auditorium, there is no excuse for poor illumination. We have cheaper and better lighting in the electric lamp than ever before; for the dollar that bought 1,115 candlepower-hours of light with the carbon-filament lamps of 1886, ' now buys 16,200 candlepower-hours of light with the MAZDA lamps. Not only more light, but correctly applied light, is the order of the day. The electric lamp, with its flameless yet highly concentrated light source, lends i tselfideally to reflectors, shades, and screens. It is controlled light-safe light. And illumina- tion becomes an exact science. During college days and in after life, correct light- ing must ever be of para.inount importance to the college man and woman. Good lighting is the worthy handmaiden .of culture and progress. -«·SlDH GENERAL ELECTRIC OENERAL ELECTRIC COMPANY, S.CHENECTADY, NEW YORK 3·8·:i<i

CORNELL tertained ever since lie became the 509 Union St. head df Union College seventeen years ago. That dream, we fancy, !1as been §~~~~-~-~-~~~~~~~~~~~ the establishment of the humanities in physical surroundings as dignified and as durable as any department on the campus. The glorification of science .]t'3.s been carried to such an extent that the gla- mor ol' it quite filled the .eye of youth. The enormous strides which science has made quite captured the •imagina- tion. Applied science has v:astly sim- plified many things. and has lifted the burden of manual labor fmm the country where science has had free- est development. 'Tile discoveries of recent years have revolutionized the teaching of science so that teJCt books of twenty or even ten years ago 11ave! ha-d to be discarded. It is in such a I sta.te o-f evolution that it is hardly \ safe to bind a teJCt book any more. 1 Lectures have to be reva.mpe,d over- night. Text books have to be made on the loose-leaf plan, .so that old parts may be removed and new leaves in- serted to keep up w·ith the procession. Education that stresses science to the exclusion of other subjects has been popular long enough to have worked out its O\'i'll cycle. The twenty --:y:ea:l'S- 'that ha:ve -graduated t11ousands of young men high in scientific attain- ment have been €nough to rev-eal the · melancholy fact that mere scientific attainment is not enough to guarantee hi~h position. Executives will tell you that they can hire any numbel' of men who know their mathernatios, who were \A\ men during theii· whole course, yet who ar-e working fo!' low wages. They will tell you t11a. t these men, lacking -in ima.gination, na.rrowed in theil' outlool{, devoid of the qualities that enable n1en to meet people and command situations, are inca-pable of rising to executive positions. When large pl'oblems are to be met, .c:orpora- tious choose ineu for executi-ves who, while they may be short on logar- ithl1ls, are equipped with broad gen- eral knowledge .and who are acquaint- ed with the human kind.

' Without doubt Edgar Allan Poe is 1 one of the most perplexing enigmas 1 1 in the annals of American men of let- ters. His poetry and prose are mark-~ ed by a weird and charnel house effect ; which invariably has been ascribed to I in~rdinate ind1,1lgence in dri:Iik and the use of morph,ine, or a co-mbination of both. In his recent book, \Edgar Al- len Poe,\ which is termed a study from a psy.chological insight, :Mr. Joseph Wood Krutch relegates these 1 addictions to a mino. r ~osition, as m~re 1 . sympto:p1s of the maJor cause which censlsted of a neurotic complex eom- );losed or a sense of inferiority and a I psychic sexual incapacity. Mr. Krutch I shows that Poe's critical doctrine ex- pressed in the critiques which he wrote on the subject of poetry and composition, shmv that Poe regarded the ideal of poetic beauty as something which rises from unpassionate emo- l tion, \an elevating excitement of the! soul,\ rather than from any inspiration· of sensual emotion which stirs or in- toxicates the heart. Poe believed that in . the tones of sadness existed the high-: est expression of beauty; and nothing, · therefore could conform with this for- .mula more befittingly than the death of a beautiful woman. Heretofore biographical studies. of Poe have been admittedly inadequate .. Perhaps the ablest of these is the bio- graphy written by George E;. Woo(!- herry, yet he found Poe's petsonality · too baffling and enigmatical to shed much light on the true soul of the ' man. Perhaps Mr. Krutch has given · us the key to the cryiJtogram of this , I great solver of cryptograms. H. L. Mencken declares it to be the most in- ! telligent and convincing account of\ Poe ever written. 1 The new way to ·finish a shave A QUA VEL VA is a new preparation r-\. created to keep the newly-shaven skin velvety soft aJldayjustasWilliams Shaving Cream ledves it.

The reserve of the underclassman may also be blamed.
