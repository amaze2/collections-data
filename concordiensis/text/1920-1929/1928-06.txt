The Trophy of Trophies, for which Williams and Amherst compete annually in sports, has been captured by the Lord Jeffs this year after Williams had he.Jd it· for several seasons. Amherst gained possession of it for the coming year by winning the annual Memorial day baseball game which was a twirlers' ibattle from start to finish. The Army-Navy laerosse game that ended in a 4 to 4 tic Saturday after an extra .period of •ten minutes marked the end of athletic relations between the two service academics due to the eligibility point raised by the Navy last year.

T-he \\' esleyan tl'nnis team was decisively defeated by Amherst last week, 7 to 2, helping the Lord Jeffs toward the \Trophy of Trophit·s.\ Rutgers spoilt•d the day at Swarthmore's alumni day athletic celebration ·Saturday by defeating the horne team to the tunc of r8 to 6. During the SC'ason Coach Arthm Fox of \\'illiams made thr statement below, which seems lo be repre- sentative of the feelings of most of the college coaches today: \Baseball has gone int0 a seri0us decline both as a recreation and a sport.\ Coaches all over the country are speaking ,of the pressing need for sponsoring the sport among the youth. In many of the smaller colleges, baseball is, of eoursr, a dead loss financially and therefore the s<.fwo)s cannot afford to tr:n·el very ,fa.r for contests. Also, it is usually very difficult for the small colleges to schedule games with larger universities, thus cut- ting thr college baseball world -into diffct'Pllt classes which do not mix. Not being able to obtain schedules close to home many smaller institutions have been forced to drop the sport altogether. But what has hurt the national sport most is thr lack of a spirit of competition, a great loss. of interest and knowledge about the game and its playing .in the average student. In the case of lacrosse and track, the spirit of competition, which is the life of any sport, seems to be mt1rh stronger as C'ddenccd by the fast increasing popularity of these two, especially of la- crosse. Ull'less there is a grrat change in the attitude towards the national sport in the eollegrs during the tl<'Xt few srasons, it is quite possible that lacrosse will usurp the place as major spring sport. the paper has evolved with contemporary style until now it contains only campus opinion and news. As far as age IS concerned, the ConC'o-:-diensis compares favorably with the leading eollege jour- nals.

He graduated in \26.\ \I saw him the other day.\ \What's he doing?\ , \He's with Jones and Under- wood. Likes his job a lot. He gave me some interesting dope too.\ \What was it?'' \About getting a job. He said he went directly to old man. Under- wood and the old boy, instead of talking about the job, talked poli- tics and baseball and music and the international situation.\ \Eccentric old fellow, eh?\ \Well yes. But smart too. You see, he knew Eddie would be all set to talk about the job and how well he was fitted for it. So Und.e~wood took that part for granted. He figured he could get a better picture of Eddie by talking about some- thing Eddie wasn't prepare<! on in advance.\ \That's interesting. But I guess lietalb NEW Eddie felt right at 'home talking on general topics. He was usually buried in his Herald Tribune for an hour' or so every day.\ \Yes-he was. And one ~of his favorites is the man who .wrote this: 'All Jacl::son had to do was scoop up the ball and toss it to Andrew Reese. But jackson tried to throw the ball before he had ,caught it. Thousands of ball players have tried to do this and none of them has ever succeeded. Andnoneeverwill.\' \He J1as a sense of humor! That's the way I like to read my baseball.\ \Rigb.t. In fact the whole paper has a sense of humor. You'll even find it tn the news columns when it's appr'Opriate.\ \Well I guess Eddie Vincent had the right idea. A supply ·of general information may be useful to the budding: business man, even if this is the so-called Age of Specialization.\ \Yes and I .must .say I think Eddie showed judgment. in getting his where be did.
