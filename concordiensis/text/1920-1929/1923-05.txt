The Junior Prom has been set for Friday night, 1hy 18, and the commit tee has announced the final plans for the aifair which are the most elaborate in the history of the college. Already many stu- dents ha,·e signified their intention .a:f attending,· but in addition there are a large numher of undergraduates who might come if they so desired. Such an affair, which marks the p·innacle of Union's social acti\·ities, is <leserdng of the support of practically the entire stu~ dent body. The Prom is a colleg-e tradition and serves as just one means of the \Yay fur a man to sho\Y his college spirit. The success of any college :function, particularly of this kind, is dependent upon the students, and the attitude they show is the determining factor. By wise and shrewd manipulation of funds, the student. in the majority of cases, can set aside the fee which is charged. The girl is probably \V<l!iting for the invitation. Ask hec Then come to the Prom and have no regret::;. Your presence will be instru- mental in making it a success. CONGRATULATIONS, DICK \The clark horse fron1 Union College\ is the way the Evening Public Ledger of Philadelphia characterized Richard Randolph Oram, when the latter came through Friday aitemoon with a cle- cisiYe win over 12 other contestants in the 440 yard hurdles at the Penn Relay Carnival. at which innumerable colleges and universities \vere represented, including Oxford :from England. One note\\·orthy fact of Dick's win as a Garnet representative I was the :fact he was Union's first entry in the Penn Relay races. The glory, fame, and honor which he brought to Union far exceeds that bestowed upon him. Alone, unnoticed. he entered the competition, while other run- ners \\'ere bolstered by the simple fact that other teammates were present. And a feeling that other colleagues are present helps a lot, we must admit. Another sig-nificant fact regarding Randy's win is that he came within three-fifths of a second of tieing the world's record. TERRACE COUNCIL HOLDS SECOND DANCE The second of the series of Terrace Council dances was held in Hanna hall Saturday night. The heavy rain t-ended to ke-ep the crowd smaller than usual, but the hall was well filled. The da11Jces are given for the benefit of the etLdo-wment fund, but the weather p.revcn ted Saturday's dance from being a big money-maker. However, it is thought that the committee cleared ex- pe~<s.es. The college orchestra furnished music. BATES AND COX IN TOURNAMENT Rob-ert V. Cox, '26, and Norman L. Bate-s, Jr., '24, will leave tomorrow a£~ ternoon for Syracuse, where they will represent Union in the inter- coUegiate golf touritamen t to be held in the salt city on Thurs- day, Friday, and Saturday. Both men have put in a great deal of time on the links thi-s s:pring and are in ex- cellent form. Both h'a ve taken part in several tott.rnaments in this vicinity and are considered to be excellent players.· Above Nott 'l'err~co ~==~~~~~~~~~ Puhli1hed in the intere$1 of Elec· lrieal Development by an Institution tTtat will 6e helped 'i.)' wltat• t'Der helps the lndustr.,1. Wanted,..,. men tofind lhe answer T HIS is written to the man who lovestoseek the unknown quantity. He is the kind of labora- tory worker who ventures into untried fields of ex- periment, rather than the man who tests materials. Industry l.as need of both types, but of the former there is a more pressing demand. College men may have been discouraged from pursuing pure research. In this highly practical age it may seem there is little room for work which does not have an immediate dollars and cents application. llut such is not the case. The pure research man is the pathfinder. With, out him our fountain of knowledge would dry up.· His findings in themselves may be uncommercial, but they estabiish a field for others to develop. Y olta worked out the crude voltaic pile- unim portant until other men improved and aprlied it. And so with Papin in the field of steam, or Lavoisier in chemistry. Men of the inquiring slant of mind, stick to your last. In post graduate study, on the faculty, in the laboratory of some industrial organization, there will always be an \X\ to baffle other men and call for the keenest thought of you blazers of the trail. -esTern Electric Company ·Since 1869 makers and clistribuiors Q/electrical equwment Number 29 of c serie11 ( For the OCJ C« STYLE S . •I .• II 1 -I' ... ; . 1n ar \' 1~. he F; es aE di s:~ fa oJ yc be - ·~ - i-1 1 Do Send Ma~ Philt how HOMI!

Imaginative yet skeptical Hum- phrey Da.vy, who believed in ex· perirnent rather than in opinion, •'respired\ it and lived. It was this restless desire to test beliefs that made him one of the founders of modern science. Elec- ~ricity was a new force a century ago. Davy used it to decompose potash, soda, and lime into potas- sium, sodium, and calcium, thus laying the foundations of electro- chemistry. With a battery of two thousand plates he produced the first electric arc -harbinger of modern electric illumination and of the electnc furnace. Czar Alexander I and Napoleon met on a raft to sign the Treaty of Tilsit while Davy was revealing the efFects of electricity on matter. \What is Europe?'\ said Ale.x:all- der. \Wt are E~rope.\ The treaty was at that time an important political eve11t, framed by two\selfish monarchsfor the sole purpose o.f furthering their per- sonal interests. Contrast with it the unselfish efforts of Sir Hum• phrey Davy. His brilliant work has resulted in scores of practical applications <Jf electrolysis in in- dustry and a wealth of chemical knowledge that benefit not him· self but the entire world. In the Research Laboratories or the General Electric Company, for instance, much h;;ts been done to improve the electric furnace {a de- velopment of Davy's arc) and new compounds have been electro- chemically produced, which make it easier to cast high-conductivity copper, to manufacture special tool steels, and to produce carbides for better arc lamps.

Probably the most embarrassing situations arise when you are not sure you will know the girl when you see her. vVhen it comes time to invite a girl to the House party many of us hesitate to ask the only one for fear of losing her to some of the snaky brothers. So we mentally cast about till we have a happy inspiration and determine to ask that wonder- ful girl we met at that High School Sorority dance last Christmas. \Ve obtain her address from the girl she was visiting at the time and are flattered to hear that she will be very glad \ \' ' ' \ \ -h.:-~ to come clown for the Prom. \Ve have happy visions of arousing the envy of all the bros. vVhen the day comes we put on the latest edition of Brooks Brother'·s ·and rush down to the station to meet her. Here we find several other men on the same errand. When the train comes in we are horrified to discover that we have only a hazy notion of what she looks like. And our gloom is deepened_ when we reflect that she will not •be likely to be wearing that evening dress by which We identified her at the Christmas dance. The more fortunate ones dash up as their respective girls alight from the train, greet them as their varying degrees of intimacy war- rant, and rush them away. But there are still a group of half a dozen or so fair guests stand- ing on the platform and looking around expec- tantly. We know that one of those is ours, but wh per clec \l\1 pat ab; SH1 an' da by to pe: Jlr< o.J< t111 fir til fo1 to th th be th ha ra he tit an th gt he he lH Ill w cc tb UJ U< pl pl o1

to he ng e1r ec- THE PROM SUPPl...EMENT 3 which! Looking about us, we discover as tnany fellows standing near and trying to ap- pear at ease, hut succeeding only i-n looking decidedly emharrass~d. Suddenly we think, \l\Iaybe she will recognize me\. But a(ter para·cling back and forth several tin,;J.es we abandon that hope in despair. Others are s1nitten by the same idea, :but only one has any success. \Lucky DeYil !\ we mentally ex- C'!aim, hut being philosophical, we are consoled by the thought that there are now but fiye left to choose from. \V e am use ourselves by pick· ing the one we hope is ours. She surely is a peach, but, we reflect pessimistically, it is probably that little snub nosed one with the old brown suit and the shabby bag. The embarrassment increases on both sides until we are reminded of the landing of the first cargo of slaves and wives at James town in 1619. But the Virginia planters were more fortunate than we for they were not supposed to know the women and were not forced to think up plausible excuses for not recognizing them. At this point one man gets desperate and, balding approaching the Jbest looking one of the group, asks her if she is Miss Jones. She has more tact than he, and replies in a slightly raised voice that she is not, but asks him. if he has seen Mr. Taylor. One of the male con- tingent now separates himself from the group and tries to approach the group of girls from the opposite side. He goes smilingly up to the girl and greets her as Mis·s Smith, and hears her trit.tmphantly away. Miss Jones makes herself known to the bold student, who bears her away somewhat less. triumphantly. There are now but three contestants remain- ing on each side and all adopt a policy of watchful waiting. We learn £rom overhearing a man who comes up and takes the snub-nosed one away that she is Mrs. Somebody's new maid. There- upon we all breathe a sigh of relief. The sit- uation is decidedly more hopeful. The ap- proach of another train, threatening to com- plicate the situation still more, forces us to adopt desperate measures. We propose to the other two that we match coins to se~ who shaU accost the .next best looking one. All ·accept the challenge, figuring that after h:tv · ing such execrable luck in the immediate past they cannot lose again. One of them, how- ever, does lose and approaches the three gids while we more fortunate ones watch him from behind a pile of baggage. The first girl he asks denies being Miss Brown. As he sp~aks we notice a tiny mole near the corner of her left eye ancl curse ourself for not rcm:>Nlber- ing that before. However,. we clo yery well by rushing out, apparently all out of breath, an:l greeting her with profuse apologies for being late, explaining that the professor had been unusually long winded that afternoon. As we bear her away we cannot expel a feeling of great pity for the fellow whose girl missed the train and who is, therefore, com- pelled to undergo the same ordeal a s~cond time. A Russian Dressing

Roth Killed In Auto Smash-up (Continued from page 1) the same- time asK: it to indict Lana- han for manslaughter. He is said to have been arrested on two other occa- sions. Ro~h and Seaholm, both members of the Kappa Phi fraternity, had. been home for the week-end and ·were re- turning to classes when the accident happened, having made the trip up on the night boat. Roth su£fered a frac· tured skull and died shortly after the accident. His home was at 3330 ).Iadi- son street, Brooklyn. Seaholm, who lives at 94 Clermont avenue, Verotia, N. J., is resting comfortably at the fraternity house and was able to give I an account of the trip. He said that there was very little conversation on the trip over as Lanahan was driving so rapidly that all the ot~her occupants of t]1e car were more or less appre- hensive.
