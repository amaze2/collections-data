We take our :first step with timidity, missirg as we do the g11idance of the 1921 board which has been who have noticed the painstakingly excellent tutoring of Coach l,ZOO Seats Symphony Orchestra MUSICAL .ATTRACTIONS Cram haYe iet asst1rance that he will develop a clever, hard-hitting ====;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;=;;;;;;;;=;;;;;;;;=;;;;;;;;= at once our httor and our inspiration. We feel that we must at this time ~press our thanks to the retiring board which has accorded us the honor o:f wearing its journalistic mantle after having guided us to !V'orthiness. We therefore make use of our initial privilege to speak ()[ ourselv.es, promising that hereafter our personalities will be subn1-erged in the paper and that the \we\, which now so blatantly proclai:!ll!s ·itself, shall be silent. -- It is our purpose to continue the independent editorial policy which naarked the Concordiensis during the regime of the 1921 board. 'rr\V e shall not adopt the vacillating moves oi the politican, lending· support for gain and reserving praise because we fear to ad vam e a ca nse with wh:ich we are not allied. The Concordiensis will not be a political org-an. We shall endeavor to recognize merit when it :is deserving and we shall not fear to invoke disfavor by ad- verse comment when through our words the college as a whole may be ben>eGted. We shall be constructively critical. We know our criticisr:n may hurt unjustly; that our pratse may be placed unde- servedly ; but ii we shall have awakened in the faulty the knowledge of that fault to his betterment and roused m the praised the am- bition to do still greater cLeeds, we shall feel that we have not failed. Our \Vo(])t'd:s may at times appear caustic; ottr phrases may seem jugglecl ior effect; but the one great object of our efforts will be that whkh we fully believe lies dosest to the heart of every student -the g:t:eater glory of Union. We assume our responsibilities with conservatism. We realize that a stony path lies be:!ore us. We appreciate the fact that the Concor.diensis has been tbe object oi adverse comment in the past; we han· no doubt that it wili be in the future. We would ask our readers to reflect that the Concordiensis, like the college, is but re- coverillg' ir-om the depression of war days; days which we do not and sha![l not regret, because we know that the Concordiensis suffer- ed becru.u se it gave its tale:nted workers to its country. The mistakes of yest.et-day and today are but the service stripes of a struggle for existen.ce, from which th~ Concordiensis has issued falteringly but unbow.e<l.. · Tlt.e Coneordiensis today faces a difficult field for publication, catering as it does to a campus public already well supplied with c\ollege mews by city dailies. This paper in its semi-weekly appear- ances •C:<I11not hope to successfully compete in many ways with the profess:io-nal journals. The editorial stafi cannot be expected to give the pa~er their finesse oi appearance or content. But the staff does realize that the Concordi-ensis is representing Union in the world oi college Journalism and will therefore put forth its best efiorts. We llelieve that we have put before our r.eaders the po:licy which we shal1J. en.deavor to uplwld. We trust that we are not mistaken when we believe that it is the policy which every Union man would victorous nine. A poor start is all the more cause for greater en- deavors on part oi both team and student body. It should be con- sidered bu't the temporary lapse oi unseasoned players. Savard & Colburn Reliable ¥ ¥ ¥ ~ • • • ¥ ¥ ¥ ¥ ¥ The Mail Bag • ¥ ¥ ¥ ~ ¥ ¥ ¥ ¥ ¥ ¥ ¥ In a letter to the editor of the Con- cordiensis, \'Jimmie\ Cline, former editor-in-chief of this paper, wr·ites his opinion of a recent. editorial pub- lished herein, ragarding the ques·tion- naire recently taken among Union col- leg~ students. He writes as folows: \I WGl:S much in·terested in your clas- sification of the subjects gratuitously discussed by Union undergraduates. It is regrettable that our better halve~ should be adjudged five hundred and thirty-ei.ght times superior to poetry, with which, at !:his ~::eason, they ought to go hand-.i11-hand. But, yom· honesty too is more precious than rubies. \Your edit.orial has hinted what is in my mind; which it is deserable that sttidents s'hould talk of their specific fields of scltolarship, it is preferaule t.ha:t they should talk. We deride that old virture of calling a spade, a spade, a11d yet in bh.e polyglot terminology of tile- street, excepting possibly that of tile laborer who wields one, a sp.ade may be anything from a 'thingamajig' to a 'whad' y-e call it'. \I was recently in company where a young man was describing a bull- fight. He had got what seemed to me, who have never seen one, a pretty de- tailed grasp of the technique of a 'tau- romaehig', bttt when I turned my eyes fr-om the portion of t'he floor which had been allotted him for !'Ile perfor- mance, I could get only such vague information about the progress of battle as,- \The bull comes at him like this\-or ''then he goes like that.'\ \In short, had I been blind .or the spea:ker han<lcuffed, we might as well have been mutes.

It is even possible fllat a dis- cHssion of say, the 'Poso;;tble and 'Prob- a:ble Var·iations o£ Angels' Wings', throug-h the medium of corre·ct Eng- lish would tend more to develop a1: intellegentt understanding of the sub- jects of the curriculum than a dis- course on psychoanalysis in grunts and call isthenics.

Every ship going tl1rough the canal in· either direction uses the water from Gatun Ltke to lift it from the one ocean anJ lower it into the other. Should some accident destroy a lock, the weight of water releastd might force down the others and cause tremendous damage and, by low'ering the level of the lake, make the canal inoperative untit rain had refilled the lake. Therefore these big emergency darns were con- strq.cted. Normally they are not used. In emergencies they would be swung over the locks, the gates would drop into position and effectually dam the opening. Otis engineers designed, comtructed and in- stalled the machinery for operating six of these r;igantic dams. It is a feat typical of the world- wide scope of Otis activities in engineering 'and the vertical transportation of men and materials.

One professor, long a member of the college faculty, desires stu- dents to cl is cuss \topics pertaining to their studies and brought up for discussion in the class room.\ He would relieve the monotony however by his second suggestion: \athletics social matters, public questions, plays and actors\ apparently intimating in his words that he would have the Union student a men of attractive conversational pow_ers, with breadth of vision. He adds that \Professors should try to make their work so interesting and significant as to stimulate discussion\-evidently an ideal answer to the question from the stuclen ts' point o:f view. The faculty questionnaires show a constructive criticism and a kindly thoughfulness for every Union n1an. It may be true that student discussion is not as deep or as comprehensive as in the past ahcl that it lacks seriousness and definite purpose, btit it niay be said that students today have a breadth of vision, widespread inter- ~sts and a keen Uhdetstartdlrtg of the happenifigs in e\\eryday life, far greater than .their predecessors. Many American college men are join- ing the recently organized Submarine- Chaser Club of America, a society formed of men and officers of the sub- chaser forces of the U. S. Navy who served during the wor'ld war. The club membership is limited to those o.f- ficers and men who were regularly at- tached to the 110-foot vessels of the navy known as sub-chasers. More than 15,000 men are eligi•ble and as many of them are yachtsmen it is expected that the flag of the club will soon be seen on every body of water in the United States. The club has headquarters at 29 Broadway, New York. -C-U -atheminstrelsh-0- DR. BARNEJS IMPROVES Dr. Frank C.

H E was a young Oxford man, only twenty-seven when he was killed at Gallipoli. Up to his time, man had never seen the inside of an atom. He turned the X- rays .on matter-not figuratively but literally-and made them disclose the skeleton of an atom just as certainly as a surgeon makes them reveal the positions of the bones of the body. Moseley proved that all atoms are built up of the same kind of matter. He saw, too, just why an atom of copper is different from an atom of gold. Atoms are built up of electrons. Each atom consists of a nucleus, a kind of sun, with a certain number of electrons · grouped about it, like planets. Moseley actually counted the number of electrons of all the metals from aluminum to gold. When you discover what gold is made of or a new fact about electricity, you open up new possibilities for the use of golc;l or electricity. For that reason the Research Labora- tories of the General Electric Company are as much con- cerned with the \how\ of things-atoms and electrons, for instance-~s they are with mere applications of the electric current. Hence Moseley's work has been continued in the Re- search Laboratories, with the result that more has been learned about matter. How does water freeze? What is lead? Why are lead, iron, gold and tungsten malleable? Such questions can be answered more definitely now than ten years ago. And because they can be answered it is possible to make more rapid progress in illumination, in X-ray photography, in wireless telegraphy, and in elec- trical engineering as a whole. There would have been no coal-tar industry without the vast amount of research conducted in organic chemistry, and no electro-chemical industry without such work as Sir Humphrey Davey's purely scientific study of an electric current's effect on caustic potash and caustic soda. Sooner or later research in pure science always enriches the world with discoveries that can be practically applied. For these reasons the .Research Laboratories of the General Electric Company devote so much time to the study of purely scientific problems. arty' Scllenectady,N.Y.
