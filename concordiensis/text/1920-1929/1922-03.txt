Zeitler, '24 Saturday, March 4, 1922 THE PRESIDENT'S ADDRESS President Richmond's series of addresses on subjects pertinent to American history and the development of national characteif are most refreshing in this day of tendencies toward the radical in life ancl government. Sometimes it seems as if life were so comp'lex that the mind is in a whirl, the path confused and in the war of ideas it is difficult to grasp the wor.thy and the tried and true. Some modern ideas-and ideals-are certainly attractive, but \vhether they will work out satisfactorily in the end is another matter. The address of Tuesday morning, having to do with the Pilgritn fathers ancl the foundation of character and government based on right and Plymouth Rock, was especially encouraging. The presi- dent evidently brought a thought new to many of his hearers, that the Plymouth colony-safe, sane and inchtstrious, mature men ancl women-tested and fottnd wanting the forms of government other than that which they adopted and which has come down today a cher- ished tradition. Communism and other fancies of the modern dissatis- fied were there thrown in the scales and weighed; tried in the rude surroundings of frontier life; and in every ca.se found wanting and unsatisfactory. Then the \terrible capitalist\ scheme was adopted and found so worthy that it has come down to this day, holcl.ing its own as a livable ancl workable system of civilizati·on. One sometimes wonders which dootrine can he trusted; vvhat ideals are best; what government brings g-reatest happiness. It is useless to look to the 20th century agitator, ior his \ideals\ are tainted with the desire for personal gain_ It is fooJ.ish to look to the sad fringe of society where lurk those who cannot comply; their sys- tems are based on the perishable sands oi inexperience and non-con- formity. But looking back to Plymouth Rock and the lives of the founders of America, there indeed is to be found the comfort of wha!t is best, what is proven and what is permanent. Life i·s a complex pro- blem, but there is no better solution than that indicated in the ex- periences of the past. Carpenter and Davis Go CaPpenter in the 60 yard dash and R. To N. Y.

Totally unlike, yet associatec;:ll Ordinary japan consists of a tough, rubbery, tar.-like· \base!' and a highly inflammable \solvent.\ The solvent dilutes the base so that the metal may be coated with it easi.ty~ The presence of the solvent 1nvo1ves considerable fire risk, .espe, cia1!y in the baking oven. \\' Milk is a watery fluid containing suspended particles or butter fat, so small that one needs the ultra..-microscope to d~ teet them. An insoluble substance held permanently in sus .. pension in a liquid in this manner is in \colloidal suspension.'~ The principle of colloidal suspension as demonstrated in milk was applied by the Research Laboratories of the General Electric Company to develop Water Japan. In this com, pound the particles of japan base are colloidally suspended in water. The fire risk vanishes. So the analysis of mllk has pointed the way to a safe japan. Again Nature serves industry. Connected with the common things around us are many principles which may be applied to the uses of industry with revolutionary results.

A great deal of opposition developed to this plan, however, not alone from the col- lege authorities, who foresaw, in the destruction of the college creek, linked so indelibly with the history of the college, a distinct loss. in the scenk beauty of Jackson's g~arden, but also trom the residents of Glenwood boule- vard, who appreciate the change o;ffer- ed, by the deep-set ravine, from the mundane surroundings. As a result of this continued op<p'osi- tion to their plans, the city engineers determined to run the sewer under the streets from the boulevards, thread the woods, and enter the drain, eilther in the bed of the coHege brook or under Sewa!\ci Place.

Avery, '23 Tuesday, March 7, 1922 THE MUSICAL CLUBS The happily glorious outcome of the recent southern trip o:f the musical cluhs should be a matter of congratulation to the members, their leaders and the college. The clubs are fortunate this year in having the winning combination of plentiful talent, good teamwork, s~tudenJt intere·st and capable directors. There is littie doubt but that the season has been the most successful in years if not in mu.sical club his,tory. \The best concert yet\ was the opinion of New York alumni and they endorsed fheir own state-ments by suggesting that next year's af:fair will be larger and even more splendidly brilliant. Other cities have already planned for a return visit of the clubs next season, it is said, and have given preieren.ce over other organizations to the Union College musicians. The successful s-outh~rn trip was good advertising for the col- lege. No doubt there are several parents in the southern part of tile state :who can feel more proud o£ their son and his Alma Mater be- cause of the splendid showing. Besides the men must have no little respect for their own abilities. And the sum t01tal of pleasure and satisfa.ction all round is too great to be calculated. THE COLLEGE AND THE M·OVIE Betterment of the ordinary movie and the film-ing of real litera- ture may be the early result o:f the entrance of the college man into the motion picture field. Richard Barthelmess, a recent graduate of Trinity coHege, has won fame upon his app-earance in the Griffith productions, notably \Way Down East\ \The Idol Dancer\ and others. Now c\Omes Mr. Barthelmess' own picture, \Tol'able DaV'id\ and his announcement tha.t he intends to produce and feature in other well-known stories adaptable to the screen. His :first pictures will probably be screen versions of Conrad's works, in which the young actor has taken a deep interest. Those who know him best, say that he rea;l[y resembles several oi Conrad's men dharacters and that he will be well-casted in the new pi<etures. There are so many excellent works of fiction which might be adapted to the screen, that it is a pity that producers must look to the realm oi the spectacular and the melodramatic for plots and stories. Perhaps now that Barthelmess has entered the producrl.ng field, there will come from his company film vers·io·ns of the first known pieces of literature capable of dramatizati,on. At any rate it will be interesting to watch the future of Barthel- par't.

T HE freshman who comes out for baseball manager and who sticks is learning a lesson which, whether or not it wins that honor for him, should win some honors in after life. He will learn that his plugging on ibe diamond, his efforts four years hence to get the: upper hand on his first job, and after that his stri'vimg to climb into the m1.:1.nagerial and executive ,class are all part of the same game. Now, just as ten years :from now, be will have to do many things that am hard, manr things that are unpleasant. The more willing he is, the more work will other men put upon him. .But :by that he grows. The rewards after college are given on about the same basis as now. They go to the man who besides doing his main job well, still has the time to reach out after othe1·work and the spirit th8tmasters it. 1-Iere is where this comes home to y-ou.

He graduated from Harvard College, and en,.teri~g upon hi~ -un.de's business became a: .successful merchant in Boston. He gained mu(;h in social power and in wealth, being meanwhile justly popular for his integrity and ability. He was in 1765-1770 a selectman of Boston and a member of the general court.

John Hancock was subsequently known in various positions: as President of the Continental Congress, as Major-General of the Massachusetts military forces, as President of the Constitu· tional Convention. He died at Quincy, Massachusetts, October eighth, 1793. The historical position of John Hancock is unique in State and Nation. He wielded great political influence but was always liberal and public~spirited. His name is most prominent as a Whig leader during the American Revolution in such events as the Boston Massacre, the Boston Tea Party and the battles of Lexington and Concord. John Hancock signed his name first to the Declaration of Independence. He thus risked his own \life liberty, and pursuit of h.applness\ that these privileges might be obtained for others to enjoy~ To this end he \pledged his life, his fortune, and his sacred honor.\ That he was popular and efficient may be judged from the fact that he was .for ten years Governor of Massachusetts, be• ing elected annually to this office by popular vote.

Fortetiibiaugih, Jr., '23 Tues·day, March 14, 1922 A UNION MAN AS PILOT The choice of Hal Wittner, '20, as baseball coach for the coming season is a particularly happy one from every point oi view, as is evidenced by the student expressions of approval which have folowed the annottncement of his selection. H ever a man was able to put \pep\ into a team, it is this same Hal Wittner, noted on gridiron, court and diamond for his own \pep personality and prowess. Wittner's presence alone, with his ready wit and inborn sense of humor, are enough to make a team of dead men play ball, and the fact that he now holds the reins and can iniuse his spirit, his enthusi- asm and skill into his men is almost a guarantee of victory. Union men shoulcll)e able to work, and to work together better under a Un- ion coach, :for the ideals of all are identical insofar as the college is concerned, and it is this similarity of ideals and a co-operation in the same cause that counts in the long run. Big scores 1Yi11 not be asked during the coming season. A \nosed-out\ victory is quite as glorious and infinitely more thrilling to both player and spectator then a wholesale slaughter. If Union can \just manage\ to win, but \just manage\ consistently, there will be no complaint from the more reasonable sections o{ the bleachers. It is a.lsD to be hoped that this year there will be no pre-season massacre of the baseball squad just because the powers behind the throne base not the time or the inclination to bother with training the men. The brightest gem is usually buried deepest. The fact that a ma.n doesn't swing a Babe Ruth hat the first time up or fill a position with the nonchalance of a professional is no reason for drop- ping- him from the squad. This system of wholesale droppin,g and cutting, so evident early in the sea.son Ja.st year, and so much more evident later on when ma terial was needed-and none was a vaila:ble-is not all that it is recommended to be. damees on March 31.

Polytechniclnstitute. This answer, giving a correct, concise and comprehen .. sive statement of the position occupied by John Hancock in American history, is printed below in full. ~~who Was 'John Hancock?\ 1 J OHN HANCOCK was an American statesman and patriot. His signature is found on the oldest and most important docu- ment:> .of Massachusetts, and of the United States. He was the :first signer of the Declaration of Independence and was the :first Governor of Massachusetts. John Hancock was born at Quincy, Massachusetts, in 1737. He graduated from Harvard College, and entering upon his uncle's business became a successful merchant in Boston. He gained much in social power and in wealth, being meanwhile justly popular for his integrity and ability. . He was in 1765-1770 a selectman of Boston and a member of the general court. With Samuel Adams he led the Massachu- setts Whigs, and only escaped capture at Lexington and Concord by virtue of the valiant fight by the Minute Men on the \Nine- teenth of April in '75.\ ' John Hancock was subsequently known in various positions: as President of the Continental Congress, as Major-General of the Massachusetts military forces, .as President of the Constitu~ tiona[ Convention. He died at Quincy, Massachusetts, October eighth. 1793. The historical position of John Hancock is unique in State and Nation. He wielded great political influence but was always liberal and public-spirited. His name is most prominent as a Whig leader during the American Revolution in such events as the Boston Massacre, the Boston Tea Party and the battles of Le::xington and Concord. John Hancock signed his name first to the Declaration of Independence. He thus risked his own \life liberty, and pursuit of happiness\ that these privileges might be obtained for others to enjoy. To this end he \pledged his life, his fortune, and his sam::ed honor.\ tnen.'\ The dropping of so many mea from the squacl was even less That he was popular and efficient may be judged from the fact that he was for ten years Governor of Massachusetts, be· ing elected annually to this office by popular vote. justified when it is considered that there has been a plea of years standing o:f \more men out for the team\. Even if the men were not of first string calibre, they might have been used as a s-crub team to give the varsity practice and thus obviate the necessity o:C admitting a number oi otherwise unemployed erstwhile Apaches to the campus in an effort to fill the empty positions. Hal Wittner is certain to be given.the respectful support o:[ every man in college, not only because he ls a Union men, but becau•se he is an athlete ancl. a good sport in every sense of the wot·d.

Bible Course To Again Be Given By Dean Ellery In resp-onse 'to re.peated requests Dean Ellery will orfrfer next year the course in Bilble study which he foMner~ ly conducted .The course is elective for Juniors and Seniors. It is intended to acquailnt the students with the con~ tents of the Biible itself and not with books about the Bible. The text-\book recommended a.nd used in the class· room is the Bible. During the coming year the work will be confined to the Old Testament and will include por- tions from its various books sltiillident to show how the Jewish nation was formed, to give an adequate accottnt of its migrations, to show its transitio·n to a secular form of goverrument, a11d to give its history under 'both the theocrati·c and secular forms o·f govern~ men:t. The comse ]s a three.-hour elective.

ZeitleF, '24 Tuesday, March 21, 1922 REGULATING ACTIVITIES Leaders of campus organizations and members of the faculty who come in personal contact with student undertakings are fi11ding it daily more true that the direction of campus activities is vested in entirely too few men. The man who shows capacity for leadership is made the central figure of so many organizations that he has neither the time nor the ability to give his best to any one of them. T·he re- sult is that certain activities, although worthy of much attention, suf- fer ncg·Ject, wh-ile others, although under constant cons·ideration, do not receive sufficient interest from the students to function tb ad- vantage. The point system is one method of overcoming this difficulty. Under its provisions, each campus office is credited with several points, and when a man has won a certain m~mber he is automatic- ally prevented from engaging in further and sim.nltaneous activities. Thus the president of a debating clnb might receive three points, the leader of the band three and the acting head of still another organiza- I tion a similar number. With the present system, one man could easily hol·d and attempt to fill all three positions. Under the point system, he could hold but one •or two, for when his total of credits became six or any other established number, he wonld be automatic-~ ally forced to either refuse to take additional offices or to resign from others. In this way, no man could spread himself over so many ac- tivities. Consequently more men wpuld ·be 1in power and more men would therefore he interested in trying out for the positions. The point system is already in vogue in several colleges and is ness that comes from doing ,good to others. and be ye k!rid one iio another, :tender• ' · R•' 1 t ;[ h\ d .·l ; hearted, £orgiv. i111g one. another, even. as He is the man who makes the Go1den ~..1 'e a par o 1s a1 y . 1 . h h .1: • • liie. -Th N ·s·· . . · : God for Chr·~·s!t's .sa \e at ~~.or,gtven e ew . uccess. you. ~E!phestans 4:31, 32.

THE BARE FLAGPOLE I Our Pioneering Work Has Just Begun There was a time not so many years ago when students looking out from the terrace wall, regretted the :fact that the campus boasted no :flagpole. Graduating c~asses ~aw to it that ~he need was :filled anclj that the campus was provtded wtth a substantial pole. Now the stu- dents look out over the same terrace wall and lament the :fact that no flag flies in Old Glory's wonted place. It would be an admirable deed should some class or organization take it upon itseli the responsibility ·of seeing. to it that the college is provided with a full set of standard :flags and, what is even more important, that they are flown rightly and regularly. It would be much of a bother to follow military regulations, hut it would be worthily patriotic if the ilag oi this country should daily wave over I the campus dnring the time that college is in session.

Each day brings new problems, new discoveries, new de- velopments, all calling for broader visioned handling on a larger scale than ever before. If I were a young man again in years, I would choose the telephone business for my life-work even more quickly than I did before.\ The telephone business touches almost every field of ac- tivity.

The defea-t ·of this far\fan1ced Metro'P'olitan aggregation by the 'lJp-s'tater.s, marked the fi-rst defeat. the former has suffere.d in ·the last two seasons. Pi~ted against the fast and well- trained Rochester team, the Union five met their match, and in a deplora,ble exhibition, found themselves, at the final wlListle on the small end of a 25 to 16 score. This proved in the end to be the opening wedge, and the Garnet entered upon a mid-season s.lump. The foHowing week, they lost to the Syra- cus-e five in the Sa1 1 t Ci.ty, 20 to 5. The less said about the contest 1 the better. It marked the lowe·st eb!b, Ito which the team dropped, and was regr·etta:ble in more ways than one. An Eastern trip was equally un- &UJccessful, the Garnet losing to both Yal·e and Wesleyan, by identical scores, namely, 26 to 19. An ultterly incolffipe!tenlfl 1.1ef1eree, added to the ~g­ nomi.ny of the Wesleyan victory.

Zeitler, '24 Tuesd'ay, March 28, 1922 THE WILLIAMS ''RECORD'\ CASE Whether or not the W.jlliams coHege authorities are to be up- h.eld in suspending the editors oi the ~'Record\ because they present- ed to the p111blic an issue which was \iadecent and obscene\ is not so pertinent a question as that of the -value of publishing such a sheet. The \Villiams custom of allowing the retiring boa1;d to print a parody on well known newspapers is a good idea and has borne many dever results, notably the \Record American\ of last year. The papers have been decidedly humerous, wonderfully amusing and delightfully novel. There is mu.ch that is funny and clever about this year's ' 4 Springstreet Republican\ but it mu.st be admitted that certain sec- tions of the paper could well be missed without great loss to human- ity in general. The trouble seems to hinge on true one idea that some young col- lege men retain, namely that it :is necessary to border on the vulgar in order to be humorous. It is not. The really . humorous bits oi literature, ii collegiate writings can be termed such, are just that be- cause they are novel and clever. The risque ca11 be obliterated en- tirely and the articles will draw a laugh, because they tickle the risi-~ bi lities of human nature; they penetrate the hide of \thickness\; manipulate the funny bone. I Much is to he expected of a college paper, becau~e its editors_are j supposed to have the advantages of culture and. h1gher educatwn. Consequently when they descend to the vulgar and the risque, they are .overstepping not only the bounds oi propriety, but are violating the law of nobless oblige. It is to be regretted that the WilEams men have to suffer for their indescretion; it is more to be regretted that the editorial board ever allowed such a sheet to appear under its banner.

Your \Ataboy' and '~Line it out\ buck up a fagged nine-and so your shouts give you the right to rejoice in the victory, because they helped win it. This spectacle of a grandstand full of men fighting for their team is one aspect of a very splendid sentiment- college spirit. When you show college spirit y()u are doing a fine thing for your college, a fine thing for the men around you, but a. finer thing for yourself. You are developing a quality which, if carl'ied into the business world, will help you to success. The same spirit which keeps ycm cheering through a raiay afternoon will in after life keep you up all night to put through a rush job for the boss. The sallie spirit which makes you stand by your teams through thick and thin will find. you loyal to your shop or office, always ready with a shoulder to the wheel-even if it isn't your own particular wheel-giving suggestion and active help and a word of good cheer, once again earning your right to rejoice in the victory.

Everything is done to make Camels the best cigarette it's ;possible to buy. Nothing is done simply for sho-:w: Take the Camel package :£or instance. It's the most perfect packing science can devise to pro- tect cigarettes and keep them fresh. Heavy paper -secure foil wrapping-revenue stamp to seal the fold and make the package 1 air-tight. But there's nothing flashy about it. You'll find no ex.tra wrappers. No frills or furbelows. Such things do not improve the smoke any more than premiums or coupons. And remember-you must pay their extra cost or get lowered quality.
