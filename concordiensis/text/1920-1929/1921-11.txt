Graham, '23 Tuesday, N ovemher 1, 1921 THAT FIGHTIN-G SPIRIT Students or other inter·ested parties \Vho entertain any doubt as to the ability or spirit of the varsity eleven should wander onto Alexander :Field some afternoon when Coach Leary's ileet of con- centrated dreadnaughts is out for a practice battle cruise. One has but to watch the flotilla execute a few manouvers to be convinced that they aTe possessed of a super-spirit of fight which is invincible. The team quite deserves the name appropriately applied dnring the game with St. Lawrence-\Murray's Fullofites\! A :fighting- eleven, regardless of whether it chalk up victory or de- feat, is a good advertisement :for any college. Ii it win, it gains the prestige it deserves. Hit loses, it gains the praise for the iighting ability it has shown. Viewing the proposition from any angle, the fighting· team is a winner no mattel' what the scoreboard says. Surely that team that daily cavorts about Alexander Field i·s worthy of every one of the many good things that can be said about it. ON HAIR CUTTING There Yvas once a trite saying popular in the west, to the eHect that \the good Indian is a. dead Indian\. The syllogism might well be .applied to Freshmen and haircuts. Haircutting is of course less deadly and does not cause an irreparable loss to the victim, but it may be the means of real gain for the college. As classes go, 1925, is about average in intelligence and behavior. Like theit- predecessors, its members do not see why they have to do this and. that or why they should cater to the-to them-whimsi- calities of their semors 111 college life.

It is granted that the men in American colleges are immature and inexperience as far as actual participation in national activities is concerned, but these mell surely have the ability to at least con- sider the problems from all phases, with minds clean and ready to face the tasks without dipping into the mire of petty partisanship or politics of any nature. There is a place in tlu world today for leaders who ca.u sup- po.rt a cause without being swayed by the petty influences which ordinarily beset the average statesman. The time has come when representatives of this countl'Y act for the best without pausing un- til they are certain that they will please their personal friends or bring no disaster to their own interests. If a student organization can in its collective mind show to the people of this country what lines of action are possible and which are best in the event of im:Portant national problems, without at the same time bowing to big business, labor, the administration or any element other than public and private conscience, it will do a work that is worthy and needed. There must be a latent energy in the colleg-e world which can keep itself to the highest and best course. Development and expression oi that energy should be the imrnecliate project of the conference o1·ganization. Chemical Research ed in tenths which together give the d 1...

Why Is Iron Magnetic? A horse-shoe magnet attracts a steel needle. But why? J-\. We don't know exactly. We do know that electricity and mag· netism are related. In dynamos and motors we apply electro-magnetic effects. All our power-stations, lighting systems, electric traction and motor drives, even the ignition system~ of our automobiles, depend upon these magnetic effects which we use and do not understand. Perhaps if we understood them we could utilize them much more efficiently. Perhaps we could discover combinations of metals more magnetic than iron. The Research Laboratories of the General Electric CompaQy investi .. gate magnetism by trying to find out more about electrons and their arrangement in atoms. X-rays have 'shown that each iron atom consists of electrons. grouped around a central nucleus-like planets around an infinitesimal sun. X-rays enable us to some extent to see into the atom and may at last reveal to us what makes for magnetism. This is research in pure science, and nothing else. Only thus can real progress be made. Studies of this kind are constantly resulting in minor improvements. But some day a discovery may be made which will enable a rnetallur ... gist to work out the formula for a magnetic aHoy which has not yet been cast, but which will surely have the properties required. Such a result would be an achievement with tremendous possibilities. It would improve all electric generators, motors, and magnetic devices. In the meantime the continua] improvement in electrical machinery proceeds, in lesser steps. These summed up, constitute the phenom .. enal progress experienced in the electrical art during the past twenty .. five years.

B an~ham, '23 Saturday, November 12, 1921 SPORTS FOR ALL It is apparent this year that the long--sought plan d a sport :for every student is being or is about to be put into action. The advent of soccer, swimming, wrestling, tennis and handball tournaments, to say nothing of the proposed Gasketball and other sporting leagues, gives virtually every student in college an opportunity to participate in some sport and to take needed exercise. Intercla.ss and interfraternity games oi every nature &hould be promoted to as great an extent as possible, n·ot only that all stu- dents. may take part, that interest may be aroused a.nd that men acquire i nd-i vicl ual l)enefits, bt1t :for the greater glory of Union. It is quite possible that somewhere ancl sometime dnring the appar- ently 1ninor games and tournaments, there will be :fotmd goou ma- terial :for the varsity team. Any line of st11dent .activity will bring to light talent suitable to represent the college in intercollegiate 1 competition should be given a prominent position 111 college activi- ties. \\\ith the .increased interest and participation m sports, there should come a reduction of complaints on the part of the few-;iio annually !amen t the fact that they are taxed real money to finance athletics. It is not to be supposed that the students will seek re- numeration hy helping themsehes to sporting equipment, hut that they will make good the opportunity to gain real return :for money invested through activity i11 the gym nasi 11m or on the field. I TlH're was a time when the average stndent was expected to pay l1is fee, then play or cheer. Now he can do all three.

The Garnet eleven outplayed its rival in every department of the game. Favor-ed to win by a heavy score, the Methodis.ts were unahle to launch sue- cessfcrl attacks at the crucial moments and fai1ed to cope with Uni·on's open attack in the last quarter. Elmer Hei·dorf, Union's quarterback, was the individual star. Time and again he skirted the wesleyan ends or shot off t'ackle for suib;;tantial gains. In fact he outplayed the highly rated W es·leyan backs. The .only score of the g-ame came in the fina.l period when tloe Garnet led the march.

A curious coinc·idence is tha.t the judge on the bench, the distri·ct attorney, who conducted the case for the Government, and F. E.

The trial was a friendly chess game between the two opposing attorneys with a fellow alum- nus as umpire. \Each played his game for all it was worth, but there was an utter ab- sence of the apparent a·cr<imony that often is displayed between opposing attorneys. Mr. Todd and Mr. Cullen occasionally referred to each other as 'the [earned sophomore', or 'my friend, the opposing counsel,' but. all was most gent! emanly and courteous. \O<l·lonel Yates, chief prosecutor, al- so attended Union college, leaving there to acept an ap1Jointment to West Point. -Beat Hamilton- ZETA BETA TAU HOLDS BANQUET Zeta Beta Tau is holding a banquet at tbe Hampton Hotel at Albany fhis evening, in honor of Isadore Bookstein, Albany Law '12, who has recently been appointed county judge of A1bany county. -Beat Hamilton--

However, The Concordiensis of 1881 had an editorial on this subject, which to- day shou1Id enlighten many.

The appeal and the senice of the Reel Cross is so world wide that any assistance given now will aid in a work whidt knows no bounds. Union men will recall the won.dedul work of the Red Cross dur- ing the war. Indeed a number of Union men were with the Red Cross in the service. This should link the college and the society even more closely. Students who take out a $1 1nembership may feel assured that their money v.:ill aid in virtually every worthy cause known to charity. The \greatest mother in the world\ numbers all races among her children. or the $1 asked, 96 cents goes to reliei and charity work, the balance is retained to support the society. This eHiciency assures the proper use o:f entrusted funds. The Reel Cross is a known and proveu institution. Students take no risk in lending aid. They give much to a cause that is worthy. -0- Pezzi Mystic-The dollar bill dosen't go half as far as it used to.

The date has been set, the pr-o- gran! arranged and favors chosen. All these were announced a few weeks ago. The only remaining detail is the selection of an orchestra. This has practically narro-wed down to a choice between two, the Mason and Dixon seven of West Virginia and \i'if ebb's orchestra from Buffalo. Both groups are ex:cellent musicians and have nation wide reputations. No matter which is chosen, we may rest assured that there will be nothing lacking this year in the music line. After the Than:ksgiving va;cation, chairman How- lett will definitely decide this question.

Monday the Frosh were train· ed in the science of the known Hamil- ton plays. Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday witnessed hard scrimmage work between fohe Frosh and the Var- sity, the freshman U1sing the Hamil- ton signals. All practice was secret and continued so late that searchlights were necesary. During the pas•t week the team obtained va:luable practice in the mud alld water of Alexander Field Heidorf is olle of Union's cleverest football stars. Carpenter came out for the scrimmage Tuesday for the fil'1st time since hi,s injury. WELLING, Right End (Continued £rom Page 1) estet. Out of seven games played the lBhle; and Buff have scored zero, her 0pp0nents one hundred eleven. The Garnet has played seven games scor- i11g forty-three points to her oppon- ents h11ndred six. bt spit.e of the fact' tltat Union defeated Clarkson with w110m Hamilton played a nothing t0 nothing game, Hamilton held both Williams and Rochester to lower scores than did Union.

Furthermore, she has a record of 26 years to keep tirnism in t.he anneuncement \Clint\ Bull will be eligible to play against Ha.1nilton. Bull will be used ia the right halfback position in place of Palmer who was injured last week. The backfield will be materially , strengthened as he is a good line pl-unger and end runner. He is capable of ·l>earing the kicking burden if neces- sary and weighs over 160 pounds. BuH cecrtainly deserves much commenda·tion both for raising his grades and sti-ck- ing so faithfully all season to his work w1th the scrubs. . Last Scrimmage Stiff Realizing that the game will be a finish fight, Coach Leary has put the team through the stiffest drill of the AUGUR, Manager as the game today at Clinton will take place under ,similar conditions. Heidorf, who was bruised in the Wes- leyan game last Sat11rday, is still on deck and is the Union main hope for victory. He has not been used in scrimmage this week to avoid any danger of injury. Without a doubt \Bob\ Parry who has slowly re- covered from a charlie-horse, will be used today as left halfback. \Clif\ Rich aad Prior, who both made ex- cellent showings last Saturday, will be kept for first string reserves. Capt. Murray can be depended on to be there with the long punts. Kruse, Klein I Be-llinger, Racette, Dean, Welling, a11d Moslher will comprise the rest of the team. Coach Leary will rely upon Prior, Carpenter, Rich, Fleming, Sham•berger, and Erdman as substi- tute tbacks. Bourst, Glenn, Gregg, Van V oast, Personius and Willetts were taken along to fill in the line in case of substitutions. Nitchman, E. Meyers, and Lair are held as substitute ends.

There will be two hundred men at least wearing the Garnet to cheer for their team. The buses go and return by way of Utica.

The papers were given by Harold I. Thorpe and Stanley 0. Morgan of the Senior class. Both papers were on the special research problem that is being studied by each of these uwo students. Mr. Thorpe's paper was on the \Electro- lytic Oxidation of Oxalic Acid,\ and Mr. Morgan's paper was on the \Ele·c- trolytic Reduction of M-dinitro ben- zen e.\ With a single exception, this is the first time that papers presented at the meeting of the Chemical Society dis- cused material that is original with the undergraduates. Both Mr. Thorpe and Mr. Morgan presented the hi.sta'ricat background of their speci:al problem., the .plans they have outlined for the prosecution of the experimental work, and fhe data thus far obtained as a re- sult of their experiments. Tl1e meeting was well attended by the members of the club and of the departmental faculty, and a goad deal 0f dtscussion was brought about by both speakers. Other meetings of the society scheduled for the winter in- clude similar papers by members of the senior class.

Shank- lin made the following statement: \The issue today joined over the eighteenth amendment is one of · fundamental difference between the better element of the American . population and the worse element, many of whom are alien in thought and speech. It is not a case of · whether a man shall or shall not · be permitted to drink, but whether a lawless element in our population shall be able to defy the will of the majority. \It is now up to true Americans to defend our national honor and institutions: In tbe support of the laws of the land-all laws-every law-the colleges should be the vanguard. And the position of the facultv d \¥ esl;>:;ran University is that so long as the eighteenth amendment remains a part of the constitution, it will be enforced at Wesleyan.\ Squad of Forty-Two Reported for Second Week of Practice This Afternoon THREE LETTER MEN Hardman Will Again Coach Gar- net Five-Game With Yale a Feature An unusually heavy, but attractive. basketball schedule, for the season of 1921-22 was a11nounced by Manager L<;!o Bombard this afternoon.

Amusements and other time-devouring divertisements should be cut to the quick, and hard, earnest work made the main project until the testing time is well past. It is just about this time of the year when there are .so many detractions that students succumb to idleness and find themselves following the paths which lead down and out-as far as college life is concerned. They should be particularly careful and studious this year for to leave is fatal, especially for those who must go to work. .There is no work outside. It is much better to work in college, even if the: job is not so financially remunerative. And those who do not have to work, should stay in college anyway, lest they prove a cause of discontent o~ the part of those who feel the pinch of hard times.

The elevator in the warehouses are operated in ·banks of ten and seyen, by means of simple dispatch ho-ards, so that one dispatcher operates an en- tire lbarik of elevators. No oper-a.tors are needed on the elevators themselves. Due to the elimination of operators' salaries alone, this Otis installation saves about $160,000 a year in operat- ing expenses. The same efficiency and proportion- ate savings. will lbe obtained through the use of Otis Push Button A11to- matic Elemtors in any industrial building of two or more floors. -Adv.
