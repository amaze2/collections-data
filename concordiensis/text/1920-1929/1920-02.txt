With belts and pulleys replaced by electric motors operating automatic-almost human- machines, many a slow and tedious process has been elimi- nated. The factory worker's task of yesterday is made pleasant by his command of this magic power. The Crane Company's plant at Chicago-electrical through- out-is a model .of industrial efficiency. Its I 0,000 horse- power of driving energy is brought by three small wires from a distant power plant. Then electricity drives the machinery which hanclles the coal for heating, cuts the steel, sifts the sand and sorts the material-in fact does everything from scrubbing the floor to winding the clock. Such an institution is marvelous-superhuman-made thus by the man-multiplying force of electricity. The General Electric Company has been instrumental in effecting this evolution. First, by .developing successful electric gener- ating and transmission apparatus to furnish economically this modern form of power. Secondly, through many years of active co-operation. with hundreds of manufacturers, it has mastered the art of applying the use of electrical energy to a multitude of needs. And finally, through branch offices and other distributing channels, its products are made accessible to all. !Hauling materialswilh~perlrted b,Jo' electric automobile motors: c ectrtc an iV Sales Of:Bces in ;J _alllatge citieSJ. 95·109D SEE THE BROGUE Men's Shoes at BARNEY'S LOOK!

Electricity- theMaster Force in Manufacturing T HE. marvels of electricity have revolutionized our manu- { facturing industries. With belts and pulleys replaced by electric motors operating automatic-almost human- machines, many a slow and tedious process has been elimi- nated. The factory worker's task of yesterday is made pleasant by his command of this magic power. The Crane Company's plant at Chicago.-electrical through- out-is a model of industrial efficiency. Its 10,000 horse- power of driving energy is brought by three small wires from a distant power plant. Then electricity drives the machinery which handles the coal for heating, cuts the steel, sifts the sand and sorts the material-in fact does everything from scrubbing the floor to winding the clock. Such an institution is marvelous-superhuman-made thus by the man-multiplying force of electricity. The General Electric Company has been instrumental in effecting this evolution. First, by developing successful electric gener- ating ana transmission apparatus to furnish economically this modern form of power. Secondly, through many years of active co-operation with hundreds of manufacturers, it has mastered the art of applying the use of electrical energy to a multitude of needs. And finally, through branch offices and other distributing channels, its products are made accessible to all.

J. ileir :1dva::tages in pursuits of peace made them of inestimable value in time of war. A most interesting story tells of the devices evolved which st:b~ stantially aided in solving one of the most prE>ssing problems of the war-the submarine menace. Fanciful, but no less real, were the results attained in radio comrnu nication which enabled an aviator to control a fleet of flying battleships, and mad.e possible the sending, without a wire, history-making messages arid ordets to ships at sea. Scarcely less important Vvas the X-ray tube, specially designed for field hospital use and a notable contdbutior. to the military surgical service. And rnanyother products, for both com- batant and industrial use, did their full share in securing the victory. In the laboratories are employed highly trained physicists, chemists, metallurgists and engineers, some of whom are experts of inter- national reputation. These men are working- not only to con vert the resources of Nature to be of service to man, but to increase the usefulness of electricity in every line of cnJe::;.vor. Their achievements benefit everyindi;ridual wherever electricity is used. Scientific research works hand in hand with the development of new· devices, more efficient apparatus and processes of manufacture. It results in the discovery of better and more useful materials and ulti- mately in making happier and more livable the life of all mankind.

The Service of an Electrical Resea,rch Laboratory The research facilities of the General Electric Compan;v are an asset of world-wide importance, as recent war work has so clearly demonstrated. Their advantages in pursuits of peace made them of inestimable value in time of war. A most interesting story tells of the devices evolved which scb- stantially aided in solving one of the most pressing problems of the war-the submarine menace. Fanciful, but no less real, were the results attained in radio communication which enabled an aviator to control a fleet of flying battleships, and made possible the sending, withQut a wire, history-making messages and orders to ships at sea. Scarcely less important Vvas the X-ray tube, specially designed for field hospital use and a notable contributior:. to thernilita ry surgical service. And many other pro ducts, for both com- batant and industdal use, did their full share in securing the victory-.
