All the men on the squad are expected ·back from their vacation for practice on Monday afternoon at 3: 30 o'clocl;: according to an announcement by the coach. The prospects for a successful sea.· ~oii are very poor, especially so in the i'ield events and in the sprints. From 14 varsity members in the field events last year only one is now eligible for competition. All the others have either graduated or else are in· eligible due to scholastic difficulties. According to Coach Bruce, ther.e will be enough material from the indoor wack team to make a good I'unning team with the exception of the sprints. l3ut the field events are so weak that it is dubious whether enough point-getters can be whipped (Continued on page .~,) Philomathean Society Receives New Members • • ttttStS Come Out For Those Field Events ,.
