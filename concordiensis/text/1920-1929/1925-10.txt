The main purpose of the meeting 1ich Dea.n Ellery is attending is three fold. It has for its primary object the discussion of the methods of financing honor societies. The second :PUrpose is the discussion of the possibility of mergin-g .the activities of the honor groups, while the last poin·t for dis- cussion will be the possibility of the merging of all honor groups. · .. ·~ Since its inception the Gen- eral Electric Company has pioneered in the various fields of applied electricity. Toc1~y ·G-E engineers are co-op~ratihg with variou·s State agricultural commit· tees in the study of farm and rural electrification. These committees include members of the agricultural college faculties. A new series of G~E adver. tisements showing what electricity is doing in many fields will be sent on request. Ask for Booklet GEK.l. When rural service lines. bring electricity to the farmer's door, many of his labor troubles are at an end. Motors, lar[Ja and srruHI, will do the many chores of fa.rm and farm house for a few cents per day. The Farm Electrical Of the six and a half million farm homes in this country, only half a million have electricity. Still, the advantages of electricity are widely known. But there is more to farm electrifica- tion than the installation of motors, lights q.nd heaters. Current must be brought to the farm, and that means many miles of transmission line, supporting poles, transformers, and ad- equate generating equipment. Slowly but surely the electrification of Amer- ican farms is taking place. As farmers learn how to use electricity, rural service lines reach out farther and farther into open country. Six million farms to be electrified! Here is a vast and virgin field for the application of electricity, with countless opportunities for colle~e-traihed men in the techl1icai and com- mercial phases of this undertaking. And for the agricultural college student and others pb.:1ning a future life in rural sections, it means a better, bigger, happier life-time now in the oaking. · GENERAL ELECTRIG: (1 E N E R A L E L E C T R I C C 0 U .P 1..

Colleg~ Records Show Two Other Cases of Three Brothers Here The Co11cordiensis desires to correct the stateme.nt made in a recent issue that the case of the Buckbee brothers is the first instance in which three brothers have attended Uni01: at the same time. The college records revea! that a parallel case existed in 1910 and 11, and artother in 1912 and 13. Artl(nlg the graduates in the class of 1910 are found the names of Sam-! uel :M. and ·william Lane Cavert I while their brother, Walter D., receiv~ eel his degree with the class of 1911.1 Rev. Samuel (avert A B. A. M., is now a pastor in Mount Vernon. Will- iam Cavert, Ph. B., is a professor in the Division oi Agricultural Extension at the University Farm, St. Paul, Minn. The Rev. \!Valter Cavert, A. B., is pastor of a church in Elmira. With the class of 1912 were gradu- ated Allai1 B. and Arthu•· D. Mann, twins. Their brother, Hubert, was graduated in the class of 1913. Ti1e Mann twins, both Ph. B., are now prominent local lawyers while Dr. Hu- bert Mann, A. B., is a physician in New York.

The general direction of the course. is under Professor James W. Mavor. The recitation sections are taken >by Dr. Edward S. C. Srnith, Assistant Professor of Geology, and David M. De Forest, Instructor of Biology. Lectures, recitations, and 're'quired reading constitute the course, which is intended to give a. general view of the ·field of science and in particular of the sciences of chemistry, physics, astron- · omy, geology and biology. The lectures in chemistry are being ' given partly hy Dr. Edward Ellery, professor .of chemistry and by Dr. Charles B. Hurd, associate professor of chemistry. The lectures in physics will be given by Dr. Peter I. Wold, professor of physics. Dr. Frederick W. Grover, associate professor of Electrical Engineering, will give the astronomy le~tures. The geology lec- tures will be given by Assistant Pro! fessor Smith, and those in biology by Professor Mavor. In addition to giving a general view .of the field of science, the major pro- blems with which it deals and the scientific method, the course is intend- ed t6 train freshmen 1n the systematic taking of lecture notes and the reading · of sCientific books.

Carte duJour Now, Phideas Krinkle, early in his college course, would have nofriHs,either ast~gardsschol­ arship and studies, or equip- ment. Hence, we·found him (.that is, some one did) buying a .pen for $1.37 -today only ~and .putting the difference between that and the price of a Parker Duofold in books-- .good books, too, let it be un- derstood. And passing charita- bly over some profane lapses, he got along with it till gradu- ation, and then some. Vve're liberal-it would make a mark when you pressed it, frequently. But Krinkle, with this penny- grasping trait, went bankrupt three years after graduation. And he never did amount to much after. Fall all-leather tan oxfords, $7 up. · For g0lf, oxfords ·of dry-soft or Scotch grain leather, non-skid or . crepe rubber soles; brogue or 85 Pcrccnter* lasts. Jack Free, on the other hand, had an eye to quality, beauty, and-oh yes-quality.His sec- ond week in- college found him with a P:uker Duofold. Makes no difference if he did steal it- he knew what sort to steal, and the victim bought another Parker, anyway. \.Ve1l. to coin a phrase, that was just like Jack, and he graduated and signed his first check with a flourish and a Parker. And, due, it must be admitted in fairness by all, to this belief and insistence on quality at all costs, h.e went stony broke in two years. So there real1y was little ad- vantage in the Parker Duofold over the orphan-pen, except having something decent to write with during the period mentioned.

The :first one told him that some of the New Y oik buildings are so tall that they are ~nowcapped all the year. The peasant stared a moment at this, but decided it must be true. Then the seoond Harvard man spoke of the great l>nildings equipped with dozens of elevators, some for local service, some for express to the twen- tieth and higber storeys. The peasant burst out hug:hing and said, you are making fun of me!\ \Now Strange but Clue, of ~he two marvels the real one was harder to believe.
