B. R. MURPHY CHOSEN PHYSICAL DIRECTOR The selection of B. Russell M ur- phy as Director of Athletics at Union, is a very gratifying one, both to the faculty and the students. Mu,.phy was chosen to seceeed Sol Metzger, and has been going into affairs with a vim that proP1ises considerable shake-ups and changes along the ath- letic line. Mr. Murphy has been interested in athletics ever since a youngster at l'eddie Institute. There he was cap- A..fter graduation, Murphy was for tw~> years director of compulsory phy- si <:ad education at St. Charles Semin- ary, Overbrook, Pa. While there he oflt:ained a leave of absence in the fall of '12 to! coach footbaH at Clemson C otlege University of South Caro- lil1~. From the fall of 1913 to the spr'ing of 1917, he was director of pllvsical education and athletics, and coach of football, basketball track, and has ehall at Gilman school, Roland tain of both football and basketball, l~ark. 1fd. and was a 1nember of the varsity track 'From September, 1917, to Fehru- holcling the school record for the ham- ary-, 1919, ~Itu·phr was in the army mer throw. \\.·it h the rank oi captain headquarters In the year 1909, ).furphy entered 0 fli cer oi Camp Lee, and Camp Dix, the L'\niversitr of Pennsylvania, where the phy~ical training officer nnder the he completed the pre-medical course, s::-.·s !em and direct ion of Dr. Joseph E.

As a member of a t!J.le-tic director at John Hopkins the varsity track team he scored in· UtJ:.iversity. The Sophom0res (mentio11ed first merely because of their seliliority) all agree that the idol looks much better, and harmonizes with its en- vironment, provided it is clad in shining naiment of green. The first year men have already demonstrated on several occasions that their artistic temperaments dic- tate a red idol since the red stands out in striking contrast to the verd- ant grass and trees. and the dull grey of the gymnasium, Perry E. Leary, a graduate and former gridiron star of Colgate in the class of 1915, has been engaged to coach the eleven. Leary ha:cs been coaching the team of Bingha.mpton High School since his graduati:on, and has turned out first-class te.a11lS at that institution. Fr~m the way he has been tackling the proposition llere at l' nioh, it is fairly safe to augur that he will turn out a well-conditioned, aggresive, fast. ami successful team.

Chilly nig-hts and crisp morning:< bring thoughts of the commg winter and its activities. \Vintcr acth·ities recall hockey and its 1 birth at Union last year. X o action has been taken yet this year to mvaken interest in the sport for the coming winter, or to provide a place foar it in the list of college activities. 1 \Cnion is a northern college. :\ny d9uht of the fact could be dispelled by a stroll aroun<l the library building any day after the i first of December. ::'-Jorthern colleges go.1p for winter sports. Union: until last year, was one of the few exceptions. Dartmouth, rival on [ basketball court, is a leader in this line. Hamilton, friendliest and 1 best of comeptitors on court, diamond, gridiron or platform, takes I hockey seriously and always has a representative seven. Williams\ is not lacking when the ice court question is broached. St. Lawrence has won fame with her championship sevens. And so on down the list. Why not Union? There is weather cold enough to make the thickest ice. There are skaters aplenty to furnish wealth of material. There is the equipment from last year, still in good condition. There is the in~ terest of students ready to hack the project. Ther.e is a city park system ready to caid in court con~truction and sufficiently interest- ed to offer games and prizes to ptomote the sport. There is Union :fame to be won, ordinarily a reasqn which would alone suffice. The team last year got away: to a fair start. The majority of the men are stUI in college and fl.nxious to again chase the pttck. Thete are loyal hearts and hands' to back them in their endeavors. There is plenty of time to arrangF for coac~ ~~d schedule. Hand- led properly the expense could nqt be prohtbtttve. Why Not. A Hockey Team?

But let us follow the wire carrying this energy to its source and we find either a waterfall, a coal mine or an oil well. Much of the supply of fuel in this country is being used up rapidly while the power of water is run- ning to waste. For the rivers and streams of this country could, if properly harnessed, develop enough electric power to save 300,- 000,000 tons of coal annually. By studying nature's forces-coal, oil and water-by applying them to machines, and finally by the perfection of apparatus to insure uninterrupted power service under varying conditions, the General Electric Company is serving to make electric power cheaper, more plentiful and reliable.
