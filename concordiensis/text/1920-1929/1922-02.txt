Zeitle-r, '24 Saturday, February 4, 1922 WELCOME TO UNION Union extends glad welcome to the hundreds of fair visitors who are making the \grey old walls' 'their temporary, but happy, home for a few days. Centuries of fair women have visited the historic campus, yet none more fair nor more welcome than the guests ·of 1923. The camJ>US is theirs and all that in it lies. The hours will speed by while the guests are here, but will drag slowly when they leave. It is to be hoped that they will really and g1adJy wish to return for it is not always that college halls are adorn- ed hy such happily well-met companions. · .May every hour bring its full round of gaiety. May every mo- ment be more bright than its predecessor. And may the setting sun lig-ht naught but smiling faces and happy hearts. EXAMINATION MORT AL'ITY Official figures have not been made public as yet, but there are reasons to believe that the mortality from examinations will he large this year. That snch is the case, may perhaps be gleaned £rom there- mar],:s of faculty members ancl others to the effect that \at least 25/ pe1· .cent\ of such a class must leave, or that \20 per cent\ of another gronp has \fallen hy the wayside\. It is quite true that there will always he fa11ures in examinations, hut jt is not the proper spirit for anyone to take 'who proudly, joking- ly. or seriously remarks upon the great number of failures as an in- dication of the excellence of the various courses. Failures are apt to he a boomerang, reflecting quite as much upen a certain instruc tor's inahility t() teach his course as upon the student's failure t<1 grasp essentials. The fundamental reason for the existence of a college is to make men, not break them. It should thereiore be an endeavor on the part of all concerned to see how many men may be made into students and kept in college, not forced to leave because of lack of prepara- tion. interest or other quite necessary attributes. The man who is able to enter college today ancl Union college in particular, cannot be regarded as being an .absolute numbskull. He therefore must have certrtin qualities of a student which may be developed, if proper cle- Yclopment is allowed. 1'ihe measure of a college is not the number of stndents-would- he students-it expells; it is the number of once-yottth:s it graduates as men.

This \leak\ of elec~ tric current, an obstacle to lamp perfection, was soon banished by removing more air from the bulbs. But the ghostly ljght, and its mysterious disappearance in a high vac~:num remained unexplained for years. Then J. J. Thomson established the electron theory on the trans· mission of electricity in a partial vacuum-and the blue light was understood. In a very high vacuum, however,. the light and appar· ently the currents that caused it disappeared. One day, however, a scientist in the Research Laboratories of the General Electric Company proved that a current could be made to pass through the highest possible vacuum, and could be varied according to fixed. laws. But the phantom light had vanished. Here was a new and definite phenomenon-a basis for further re~ search. Immediately, scientists began a series of experiments with far reach- ing practical results. A new type of X~ ray tube, known as the Coolidge tube, soon gave a great impetus to the art of surgery. The Kenotron and Pliotron, followed in quick succession by the Dynatron and Mag~ netron, made possible long distance radio telephony and revolutionized radio telegraphy. And the usefulness of the ''trort'' family has only begun. The troublesome little blue glow was banished nearly forty years ago. But for scientific research, it would have been forgotten. Yet there is hardly a man, woman or child in the country today whose life has not been bene£ted, directly or indirectly, by the results of the scientific in-vestigations that followed. Thus it is :that persistent organized research gives man new tools, makes available forces that otherwise might remain unknown for centuries • General (}eneral O:tilce C 0 JD Schenectady, N.Y. 9S-473HD ~ cha Vic Fra botl deB Mo, G Tro Joh: Sch· tad:y Glac M nect s•ki, Gue~ mon Y.; Viol kins r

Zeitler, '24 Tuesdlay, Felbruary 14, 1922 PUBLICITY FOR UNION President Richmond's happy faculty of saying the right thing at the right time and his keen insight into the how and the why and the should-be of things, is bringing greater fame to Union daily. The president has been quoted extensively upon his stand against profes- sional tendencies in college athletics ·and hi:s declarations that money competiti·on is not hest for institutions of learning. New York darlies have been loud in their praise of President Richmond, and an aping smaller press has given his remarks similar, if not equal prominence. This is publicity for Union of the highest calibre. \Practical Publicity Persistently Pursued\ is a slogan which this institution might adopt to good advantage, not only to itself but to the world in general. The mere {act that a college is small is not a condemnation. of its quality, not is its somewhat lowly standing in the world of g-reat endeavor reason for hiding its candle beneath too great a basket. One of Union's greatest present day needs is a plentiful supply of men from sections of the country well beyond the boundaries of New York state. One means of securing such men is to show the daily reading public that Union college has at least enough interest in itseli to tell the world of its accomplishments. The modest violet is perfectly all right in its place, but it will never do for an ambitious institution like Union to ape any less conspicuous flower than the sunflower, which rnay hang its head from necessity at times, but at least rises in the world to a position where it may demand attention and resulting tribute. THE 1923 PROM The success of the 1923 Prom gives indication that it was not only pla·ced at the proper time of year, but at a per1od when it was most appreciated by all concerned. Coming as it did a:t the end of examination week, it was a fitting relief to mental strain. What little time it took for examinations went by unnoticed, unless it can be said f h 1 1 \ ' • l't \ that the reason or sue an apparent y arge exammatwn morta 1 y was due directly to anticipation of the Prom and resulting lack of attentinon to studies. · Winter is, of course, the proper and best time of the year for dancing, while the rather unpleasant conditions of walking neces- sitates a confineme11t of activities to the various houses and social functions, a feature much to be desired. Taxicab bills may soar a bit higher than wouhl be tthe case with a spring Prom, but on the ~.vhole the insi,cle attractions and lack of time to reach other affairs add to the enjoyment of life on the campus. The class of 1n3 is to be congratulated upon the Prom. It is probably the most tntportant social function of the year and the social name of the college depends l'argely upon the Junior class. It is therefore quite fitting that the class should do its best in providing for the entertainment of guests and friends, and no one can gainsay the fact that 1923 ' 1 did the honors\ well and proudly. Published in the intere$1 of Elec· trical Development by an Institutio11 tlrat will be helped !Jy what· ever helps the Industry. Does it hurt much . --- c.;a.. - -_ :sz:gg; to own one? T HERE is a campus saying that if a man has won a Phi Beta Kappa key or other honorary fraternity emblem, he had better keep it out of sight when he goes looking for a job. Still there are men who ranked high at college and who haven't turned out altogether failures in life. Strange though it may seem, more and more such men are winning positions pretty high up In the commercial and industrial wodd. Call it chance. Say they succeeded in spite of their scholarship. But, seriously, is it too much to trace a logical connection between a nlan 's pro- ficierH·y in getting ready for his vocation and his success in that vocation ? Surely it is common sense that the better grip you get on your work now, the more easily you can handle the big jobs later on. This question of scholarship is far bigger than whether you like a certain emblem and the men who wear it. The value of the emblem is what it stands for-know ledge and the ability to think str.aight. Develop this ability where and how you will, but develop it-because in the world of affairs they l'eward it liberally. 1tctric Company Maybe it's against all camPus tradition, but some men who stood high at college and who entered this Company years ago have since become its executives.

Bellinger, sub- stituting for Nitchman, shot a twin- counter, and the scoring for the halif ended when Rinaldi shot another fou.l. Score at half time, 1'8-7, Union. Second Half Darcy again started the scoring, this time from the fiel-d, but it was offse't by one by Nitchman, and Rinaldi con- tdbut.ed a shot that br·ought the stands to its feet. After about five minutes of play, the game begaa to deteriorate, and an era of much ruani11g a:bout but little scoring began. Successive fou1s brought the score 11p to 28-12. Sdhwartz caged a hot o11e from the sidelines, Rinaldi shot two fouls and Nitchman added his fourth basket. The entire first team was sent to the showers, but Detroit was unable to make much headway aga.inst the sllibs, either. Faber scored from the field, and the last scores were field baskets by Bar.rett and Dar·cy, which went for naught, as the game ended sfllortly af- terwards, with a final score of 35-18.

Dr. Rice, class o·f '54, was the president of the Philadelphia meeting. There a letter was read from Dr. Botsford, '47. He also has met Rev. Peter McNab, '47, who was iOO years old on January 5 this year. The oldest alumni in the Uni·ted States, he believes, is Mr. Washington Bissell, '46, who will •be 102 years old in April, and who lives in Great Barrington, Mass. In a letter from Mr. Bissell, as from other alumni, Dr. Rkhmond said that he found t.he same devotion to the alma mater, as was prevalent in his southern and western trips. INCOME TAX IN NUT- SHELL .

Issue Editor, Charles S. Mix, '24 Saturday, February 18, 1922 =================~===========~=============~ --~==================================== MENTAL LAZINESS (Kindness of Dean Ellery) An old proverb says, \Make your head save your heels.\ Simple advice, it seems, yet it contains the sec:ret of modern progress. In- vention today centers about the- great problem of saving human labor by .careful thought. To claim a ))lace in present-day civiliza- tion, we must a-ccustom ourselves to t,ll.inking out the :best ways of doing things. The great enemy to pngress of this ki.t;~.d, fhe thing that holds back men with natural ability is mental laziness. M9st of use have, or have had, a tendancy to be lazy about think- ing. That, in itself, is no·t dangerous; :a tendancy can be overcome if we are interested in overcoming it. ~ut many people, not realiz- ing what is the matter with their minds., let lazy thinking habits de- vdop unchecked. The slipshod mind bas always an excuse ready. It says, \I'm too tired to work now. W1lat I need is a thorough rest to fit me for thinking. Tomorrow I shall be able to do this w·ork easily.\ Son1etimes the excuse is gemdne ,but we must be on our guard to see that the tired feeling really means overwork. We must be on the outlook for the idle brain that complains of being ex- hausted. The lazy mind is like a spoiled ch1;1d. The more it gets its own way, the worse it acts. If you give in to it, if you let it quit work the minute it oomplains, it will never serve you without grumbling. Nerves, like muscles, neecl to do a certai11 amount of work to keep in condition. Is your mind working or shirking? Does it show the symptoms -of regular, wholesome exercise, or is it sluggish and hard to manage? A good test is in your ability to think it1 a straight line, without al- lowing your mind to wander off on irre·levant subjects. Choose any topic which interests you and which pr·ovides an opportunity for reasoning from point to point toward a definite con.clusion. See whether, without writing down the steps in your reasoning, you can think steadily ahead for Hve minutes a;.t a stretch without finding from time to time that you are oH th~ high road and must climb back again. If your mind is geared to hard work, you can do it easily ancl naturally. Going ahead vigorously iit the best safeguard against drifting. If yon fincl that your brain is doing as it likes an<L not as you Hke, give it more exercise,-carefully at first, making it work a little more each day, keeping it on the jOtb a little after it pretends to be tired. Only a few days of such practice will make it possible for you to think harder and longer at a time than you thought possible. Apply this method to studying and apply it as weU to your every- day work. Take pairts to think about your problems and be eon· tented only with d•oing things the best way. Take seriGttsly themes- sage, \Make you head save your heels.\ Our life~ong knowledge of chcice to· ~ '. •• ~ + 1 • .. • • - ~ ' c • ' • ~· baccos, -'~ur years· ot· ~~nufacturing ex- perience and our up-to· .. date facilities are concentrated o:Q. making ~CAMELS the 1hiest Cigarette ·th~t cali be pro(J]uced'. - Into THIS ONE .BRA.:N jj we put the UTMOST '(Ju ALIT;Y.

No one man can obtain the rub! more than a stated total at any one time. This prevents one student from holding, through popularity, more offices than he can efficiently fill. If the student is awarded higher honors., he is alowed to resign from a lesser office. One pleasing ieattt.re of the system is the fact that it prevents any one man from overdoing and assures cap·able work in every cam pus office. Under present conditions, the work is done by a few dividnals, several oi them holding a numbet· of offices. Under the point system this would be impossible, for a man could hold but one or two positions at a time. Adoption of such a policy would insure the actirity of a larger number of students in ,college life and would matcria1ly increase the scope a.ncl efficiency of student body offices.
