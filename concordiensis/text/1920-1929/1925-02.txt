The New York team administered the first setback of the season to the Gar- net five and in aH probability the loca'l five will' have to travel at a fast pace t0 stave off a second defeat. The Crescent A. C. has one of the str0ngest teams in amateur circles. Their victories this season include a record· of 18 consecutive wins before being stopped by Fordham.

This means that even the novice at debating has a chance of maki11g the team and of acquirin·g ability in speaking which will be use-l ful to h i111 throughout the rest of his 1 life. Gniott is well represented in the field of athletics by teams of recog- nized standing, and this has been made possil>le hy the support which has been accorded the teams by the stu- dent h0dy. But in the field of debat- ing support has been lacking. In pre- vi0us years the Union debating teams have had enviable rec0rds which can be duplicated if the proper support is shown. Union \viU meet six: colleges in de- hating ·this year and if the good name of the imtitution is to be maintained in this activity, which is perhaps more acaqemic than the ordinary affairs on the campus, it is necessary that more students take a strong interest in the sport. THE OBJECT OF COLLEGE T HE OBJECT of college trailuing, accmding to a rep0rt issued by a specially appointed committee of senims in Dartmouth Col:Iege, is to stimulate independent thinking, to in- spire t0 atl intellectual .Jife, to encour- age undergraduates to dig out kno.wl- edge for themselves and aid them in developing •conclusions therefore, and prepare them for intellectual :leader- ship. The committee further found that this purpose is at present bloc:ked by a ·kind of attempt at nmss education, which sil.o.uld be abolished.

Radio broad- casting was first introduced to the people of eastern. New York state by the Radio Club, when on the night of October 14, 1920, phonograph music was sent through the air to people within a ltOO-mile radius of Schenec- tady. For the next two months this ·station conducted entirely by the stu- dents, was the first one in the United; States to regularly broadcast musical programs. Soon after the start of the first commercia'!' broadcasting statio.n, the Union radio operators added to their weekly concerts complete Sun- day night church services, with college professors giving the sermons.

The best liked of these three home-made sets is a modification of the well kBown Reinartz circuit and is adaptable to aU wave lengths. All of the receivers are of the regenerative type and consist of a detector and one- stage ampli tier. Transmitting equip- ment consists of four distinct trans- mitters. The first uses one 250-watt length ranges between 50 and 10 me-1 ters. For the extremely short waves two 5'0-watt tubes in a push-pull os- cillator are used. P.ower for these transmitters is obtained either by rec- tifying high voltages with Kenotron rectifiers or using the output of a 2- kilowatt 3000-volt D.C. generator. Besides the actual radio apparatus, the college purchased two long needed articles, an Exide storage battery and a Balkite charger. @o. E. co.

Min tn·r '27 THE MUSICAL CLUBS A THLETICS and other campus actiYities ha,·e their ups and clowns, but an organization which has been ftmctioning more or less per-i fertlv during the last few years is the' 1Iusical clubs. This fact was brought out strongly in the intercollegiate con- test at Syracuse Friday when the Glee club came within a iew points of IVin- ning the state championship. Perhaps a large part oi the crediti tor the part Gnilll1 took in the contest! is due to L\oach Schauffler. b:n t~e 1 men who gave up a share ot ·thetr: mid-vear vacation period and \\'hO have devo~ed long hours to practice desen·e I as much praise as those who gain i glory on the athletic field. Although 1 a certain amount of musical ability is needed for a man to qualify for mem- bership in the 11usical Clubs, yet it is only through hard work that the clubs can make their customary excel-1 lent showing. I The ~Iusical Clubs have had an un-1 appreciated influence rn bringing men I of a high type to C nion College. The I concerts given in various parts of the country haYe spread the good name of the college to persons who never heard of the college athletic teams. And a word must be said for the high standards of music >vhich Coach Schauffler has introduced into the ~1usical Clubs. The music which now appears on the programs is of the worthwhile sort and is not merely a collection of ill-assorted jazz tunes. While there is a slight disappoint- ment that the Glee club did not win the Syracuse contest, yet there are so many pleasing factors to the present state oi affairs in the clubs as a whole, that hearty commendation is the only sentiment which can be expressed to the members of the organization.

Track offers a chance to eyeryone of any athletic ability at all to make good. It is the one sport which calls for all year round training and it is the one gport which teaches the im- portance of the individual, although team work is by no means lacking. Union's track material is as good as that of mo~t colleges and Gnion's op- portunitieg ior success are better.

Two years of col- lege preparation will be necessary for admission to the law school beginning with the entering class of September, 1926.

Coach Bruce's last year's La- fayette team won the event, while Fordham placed second. The time was fast, 7:55 for the distance \Bill\ Young '25, ran the first leg of 440 yards for the Garnet. At the gun the field got away well bunched with ::-J. Y. U. in the lead. On the second lap with about 80 yards to go, Young drew up, lamed, and it could be seen that he labored over the back stretch in considerable pain, loosing about 75 yards. Tiedeman '26, carried the baton over the 220 yard route, making up about five yards and sending R. A. Johnson '28 away 70 yards to the bad. John- son ran a fair race making up con- siderable distance on the first three laps, but on the home stretch the ef- fort began to tell, and although he tried hard, he <!lbout held his leg even. ).fcMillan '28, whom Coach Bruce switched to the mile, starting 70 yards to the bad, worked his way gradually overcoming the big lead. At the end of the half, he had cut down the lead to 35 yards. At the three quarter mile mark he was 15 yards behind the lead- er and beginning the ninth lap he passed the N. Y. U. miler and closed up on the Fordham runner. :McMillan kept going, and the gal- lery appreciating his efforts gave him much encouragement. On the bell la·p McMillan closed in fast but the handicap was too great. Lafayette reached the tape four yards ahead of the Fordham man while McMillan was about seven yards back of the winner. N. Y. U. drew up 10 yards behind Me- Millan.

THE CONCORDIENSIS, FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 27,. 1925 ====================================~ EMPLOY:MEN-J HINDERS GOOD ·scHOlARSHIP: Miss Ely Finds That Many: Students Are Dropped Be- cause of Outside Work In order that the puihlic does not get the impcessioH that the college' student who earns has way through'' college has a relatively easy time; Miss''· Esther Ely has prepared a short state- illent which sums up the situation at: Union. Miss Ely states that many students are leaving Union every sem-. ester because their outside work inter- • feres with their studies. Members of the faculty think there . are as man.y as eight or 10 students . who were dropped from the freshman class during mid-years not because they lacked ability to do their school' work but because they were forced to . spend too much time earning their living. 1fiss Ely states: \The activities and · practical results of the employment · bureaus in our coi'leges have been gi·ven so much newspaper publicity in recent years that an impression has gotten abroad that it is a simple thing for a student to work his way through college.

IlllStead of agree- ing to pay all loans within 10 years after graduation, they signed an agreement to sign a legal note at the tim.e of graduation payable withilll one year, with the .option of paying the money in small installments extending .over a period of one or two years. Assistant Treasurer Hartley F- Dewey said this new method was nec- essary because of the failure of the larger part o.f the alumni to pay the money within the 10 year limit. Many alumni after they had 1been out of col- lege a few years, he said, forgot they had ever signed such an agreement. In collecting the money due to col- lege under the former policy, it has been the custom to write the alumnus a letter at the end of 10 years. The new method will keep the loans alive and make them an asset instead of a liability. The failure to pay the loans has greatly reduced the fund artd cut O·ff man:v needy students from assistance .. This money is given to the college to loan and under the agreement signed. by the students the money is to he returned as soon as he can afford to· do so. - ----:-1 ·: Washburn Hall MONDAY, March 2nd Room 4 - - Come to our exhibit at the above address.
