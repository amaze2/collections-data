Toodles Invites You Drop in any time now, you fel- lows .from Union, and look over the new J(uppenheimer suits for Spring. You will like the smoke greys and the blue stripes and you will like the new suits made with dmtble breasted vests and all the new fixin's. 1 think you will like them and I kruow you will like to see how you look in t·hem anyway. We don't charge a cent for showing them to you and you wilt fir_cl us mighty pleasant about it. Pola Negri at the Prom A Byronic Dream There was a sound of saxophones by night And Union's revelry• had gathered then Her festive cohorts 'nearth the magic light That makes girls young and turns the boys to men. Four hundred hearts beat amorous, and when Jazz .strains blared out their insidious swell Dark eyes loGked love to blue which spake agmn, And all went merry as a chapel bell; But sh! Excited whispers some rare gossip tell! Did you not see her? There! No, just behind Young Gordon Byron looking so discreet - On with the dance! let joy be unrefined; No sleep when poet and this lady meet To tread the weird fantastic shuffling feet; But see! those icy stares from near the door The chape1:'ones perplexed just how to greet One whom they've seen too many tilmes before In dress that, say the least of it, might well be more. Adown an awestruck lane of that high hall Swaim Moviedom's great queen with careless eyes That reigned the first amidst the festival - Those marvelous great black and velvet eyes And Gordon fa·intly smiled to see his prize So coveted by friends he knew right sure Were estimating with a wild surmise By what divine acquaintance, or what lure He won and held,that fickle favor so secure. Ah, then were ftenzied cut-ins to and fro, And gathering wrath fro.m damsels in distress, And cheeks all pale-. -no, that was years ago, Be{ore cos\metics lifted loveliness Beyond disaster from a chance caress ; But looks. wemt forth fuH eloquent of thought Whkh best were not repeated; one could guess That future dates were better left unsought If with such awful dreams so sweet a night were :fraught.

Previous to the practice contest, intensive outfield practice was held. Wellinghorst pitched for the varsity nine while both ·Collins and Stt1bbs, a sophomore southpaw, per· formed -on the motmd for the ineligi- bles. The game was characterized by ~onsiderable hittittg and clever field- it.g. particula6ly for the reg11;a\ nine. When the game was called the garnet 1n chine came out on the long end of a 7 to 1 score. 1 t was expected that the game sched- uled for Tuesday with rhe Schenectady Police would be played o-ff some time bdore Friday. Continued :rainy wea- ther has hindered all prospects of a game this week and it was postponed :mtil Tuesday. In nearly all departments of the game there has •been a steady improve- ment and prospects of a garnet victory are bright.

In choosing you to carry on our work, we believe we have picked four worthy successors-men who have been most active in their class and college work. You have shown by your int'erest and de\·otion to your Alma ?\later, that you are fully quaEfied to assume the reins where we leave off. The Terrace Cou-ncil at Union has been active for many years; it has always been the intermediary between the stLtclent body and the faculty; it has always acted for the greatest welfare for the great- est num•ber. In assuming your new taslc, keep foremost your duty to your college, your fellow students and yourselves. Never let self- interest interfere with the common weal. You are entering a demo- cratic inst-itution as representatives of your college, and as such you mus-t seck to fnlfill your trust. \Ve have implicit faith in your ability-use it in the best possible way.

Extra-curriculum activities at union are alrea·dy so numerous and all-emhracing that any addition to the number must have a real reason for existence. To begin a new .activity without due consider- atioll of whether there alfe the means of maintaining the ac1:iV'ity properly, is foolish and will rellect upon the college, especially if the venture is of the nature which attracts more or less widespread at- tention. The college has enough different forms of athletics and plenty of ca·mpus organizations for various purposes, but in the field of publications there is a definite want, a want which could be sup- plied hy the pnrpe't' activity of interested students. A successful comic publication brings fame to a college more than anything else, with the possib'le exception of a championship football team. IB many institutions of higher learning it unites the alwmni body closer together than a serious pubJ.ication can .. The love of the rid-iculous may be one of the weaknesses of the human race, but great strength lies in the abili-ty to take a·dvantage of the weak- ness. A venture of such a nature must be stwcessfu1 in order to justify its existence, bnt success is not as far away as some might cct first imagine. A college comic need not attempt too much at the begin- ning. For a year or two, quarterly issues of such a paper would be a..mp'le: later it could be enlarged and the number of issues increased. There is s11rely enough talent in a college of over six hundred students to make the affair worth while. There have been ·trials of humorous publications at Union, hut never an attempt completely planned, competently ed•ited by an organized staff and 1ba:cked with tbe whole-hearted suppor•t of. the college. With the venture in the hancls of capaJhle editors. supervised if need be, objectional· matter wa.uld not be printed. The students themselves would support a comic magazine, and the experience -of other colleges shows that as S>oon as the success of such a publication is assured, circulation al- most ·takes care of itself. There is undoubtedly a· demand for a humorous publication at Union, a demand which has been unfilled for years. The Concor- diensis can-not attempt to ful£ill the need. If the demand is to be met at all, it should be met fully, with a publicatio-n which would advertise the name of Union, and offer an unexcelled oppoPtunity in a little developed field of extra-curriculum actiYity. · COLUMBIA RANGER And Other Standard Make Bicycles Repairing-Supplies CASH OR CREDIT L.

As to the possibi'lity of \vin- ning m·er fellow students to the cause, it might first be expedient t.o ascertain hov-; many are of voting age. Prob<1hly the greatest evil of such a political organization is the time it entails which might be profiitably turned into some useful college activity. There are few acth·itics on the campus that are not in a pGsition to utilize any sur- plus energy which might be potential in further politicians. How- ever. if this energy must be expended in the founding of some or- ganization. there is plenty of opportunity to start useful and bene- ficial activities. A societv to unite non-classical arts students and a comic publication are ori'ly a few of the many needs \vhich confront us. EYcn though it can \'\'ell be appreciated how grateful the candi- date for a public office would be and how honored he would feel at the suppm·t of a college group, upon thoughtful deliberat-ion it would seem that a club to abolish .poJi.tics would h<we much better excuse for existing on our campus.

Five others became comfortably ·• off and found themselves after twenty . years at the small yacht and chauffeur stage. The other ninety-four presum- · ably congregate in the great section of . the American people who drive their • own Buicks to the golf dub. In other , word·s, dreaming about being a rich. man is one thing, and making .the grade .. is \something else again.\ · Yet the ninety-four presumably work; just as hard as the sumptuous six. Their· business is the axis on which a small,' and uninteresting world revolves. They' have becc·ne devotees of the dollar 1 and when that 5.:::!:!c deity deserts, have: nowhere else to turn. Jammed in a dull, straight rut of business they can· never leave the road and jump the fence ·into finer fields of life.

In the college community, as indeed as in any society, the acts of individuals reflect upon the reputation of the community as a whole. If obnoxious acts are repeated by ind:ividuals, it is time that the commwnity take measures to restrain them from their course of action. \Vhen students repeatedly violate the supreme law .of the land, the time has come for a serious considera~tion of the matter. The eighteenth a1mendment to the United States Constitution was adopte,d in a perfectly legal manner in response to a general de- mand on tlhe part of the public ,fhat the liquor traffic he wiped out. The question of peifS0'11Jalliberty, as guaranteed in the Constiltution, has no relation to the matter, as any amendment may tmodify any previously existing part of the Constitution. Regardless of whether or not the law is a success, rt should be obeyed until i-t is changed by the pr·escribed legal process. Men who break the law concernin•g the sale of intoxicating liquor are cdminals in the saJtne sense as those who break the laws about theft and mur- der. Co111tinued disrega,rd of a particular law by a large percentage of the residel1Jts of a country tends to break down the regard for all laws in general. The college s1tudent should be the first to. obey the law and the last •to break i-t. If it is true that he is to be 1Jhe leader of tomorrow, he should asse·rt his leadership by being an exa'!nple in practical questions of this sort, whi-ch intimately concern ·him. 1.J nion is not faced with as erious problem im the ma.tter of drink- ing, as there are but few habitual drinkers on the campus. But >there is a problem. \Vthether drin•kers or nut, the students frequently ex- press the wrong attitude in the matters, .as, for instance, a mention of liquor in student meeting seldom fails to bring a ·demonstration :w·hich reflects on the character of those producing it. The compar- atively fe\v habitual drinkers s·ometimes dishonor the college by be- ing drunk in public places. \Ve believe :that drinking i.s wrong from a moral standpoint, that the eighteenth amendment can be and will be enforced, and ·that while it is the law it should be obeyed, regardless of personal considera- tions. Taking into account all the ramifications of the qu-estion, is i't right that a Situ dent dis honor himself, his associates and the college at large by being intoxicated?

His last great achievement was his famous experiment to de- termine thedensityoftheeartb. Friedman's Market 49 South Centre St. He first made water from gases Henry Cavendish, an eccentric millionaire recluse, who devoted his life to research, was the discoverer of the H and the 0 in H20. In fact he first told the Royal Society of the existence of hydrogen. He found what water was by making it himself, and so became one of the first of the synthetic chemists. Cavendish concluded that the atmosphere contained elements then unknown. His conclusion has been verified by the dis- covery of argon and other gases. The Research Laboratories of the General Electric Company have found a use for argon in developing lamps hundreds of times brighter than the guttering candles which lighted Cavendish's laboratory.

The :\lountehanks and the l\Iusical clubs will perform for the lwnt'ilt of the stnclents and their guests, and the athletic teams will take part in some of the most important contests on the schedu 1 les. The fraternities have planned house parties and dances, all o·f which will adcl to the enjoyahility of the season. The Prom is more than a class or group function, it is an affair fn \\·hich the whole college has a part. Everyone can have a part in making the week a success hy supporting it to the fullest extent pos- sible. Those who attend the· affair haYe a great responsi.bility, since the man who conducts himself unworthily at such an aifair dishonors not only himself hnt the whole college as well. \Vhile all shou1cl have the best time possi 1 hle, there should be constant effort to make presont happenings weH within the bounds of good conduct arid fu- ture recollections entirely pleasant.
