HE TJ:.\lE. is fast <~ppn.;Hhing when Union must have a newJ arts building, if the college is to contin'lle to furnish high grade· instruction to the students in the liberal courses. We hope that. the college will not increase in· ntlmbers; but even .though the reg-is~ tration remains the sa1me, something must be done to· remedy the oYercrowding in class roonns, and to make the schedules more c0n- yenient. I Interest in a new arts building is increasing and its lack is felt tnore keenly each year with every gq,in in enrollment. Many sec- tions of certain courses have far too tnany students for the best results: some classes meet in different recitation rooms on the dif- ferent days in the week; pr.ofessors ahd instructors in the arts· courses clo not ha ye adequate 0ffice space. Classes are often arranged at inconveti.ient hours, all because there is not sufficient room for all the groups to meet at hol.lrS which, will he agreeable to prnfessor and student alike. Many students go through college \:vithout being able to take many desired courses, the difficulty arising· out of conflicts which might be avoided if there was an arlecptate numl1er of class rooms. For tot> long a time the General Engineering Building has sheltered classes in Latin ;mel n10dern languages, as South College ami \ra~hhttrn Hall haYe not -1Jeen large enough to hold the arts men for years past. A new arts 1milding is needed as much as the 1 new chapel and is nceclecf'more than the proposed athletic field. Sometime in the near future the campaign for funds for a new I building- should he started. There is now no need to worry about the motH:'Y to pay salaries and running expenses and every attention can :-;oon l>e turn eel to C nion's g-reatest need. The present under- g-raduates will han their ~hare in securing the building, for it cannot he expected that the goal can he realized immediately. The import- ant thing is to he ready to respond when the call for aid comes, with I a willingness to make Cnion a better place for future generations of student:->. _ I I ON CONDUCT I The stucknt hocly meetings at Union College were instituted! to pro\'ide a \·ery necessary forum at which the affairs of campus 1 life l'IJtlltl he Hegotiated in a business-like and gentlemanly manner. Of late a quite cleplorahle lack of these two qualities has been mu·ch in evidence during that pa-rt of the meeting devoted to the bttsines.~ discus:-;ion. It has become n real and unpleasant undertaking to attempt to make a report or present a proposition in the student meeting. C ndouhteclly a larg·e measure of this disturbance is but the product of the well meaning wits in attendance, but such wit becomes a vice when long conti-nued to the embarrassment of the speaker who is· addressing the body. Among ourselves much can and will be excused, hut in the presence o{ visitors such conduct ts inexcusable.

If you do, surely you 'Will read this one One fine day a Sophomore from a leading Univer- sity came to see us, suggesting that we advertise in their ~ndergraduate paper, and best of all convinced us, and this is }:low he did it: First-He believed in Life Insurance because his uncle (a good business man) c1ad advised him to buy some. · Second-His Father died in the prime of life and good health and left almost no insurance, when he could have carried $50,000. 'fhird- He also knew that he could buy Insurance NOW :J.t half the annual cost his uncle and Father haC!. paid for theirs. All this convinced him that even though a student, he should take out as much Life Insurance as his allowance would permit. What About You? Every college student looks forward to a career, which will make possible the fulfillment of the most cherished desires- surely Insurance is a necessary part of this program.

The question to be argued upon is, \Resolved That the New York Leg- islature Should Ratify the Amend-. ment, Granting Power to Congress to Limit, Regulate, and Prohibit the Labor of Persons under 18 Years of Age.\ The Philomatheans will defen<l the affirmative of this question while the Adelphic wranglers will attempt to show that the legislature would be acting unwisely to follow out such a suggestion. Carmel C. Garofalo '28 wiii open the debate by presenting the Philoma- thean side. The oth~r members of the affirmative team are S. Moodie Hesson, '27, and Archibald C. Wem- ple '26, captain. The first speaker on the Adelphic team will be Herbert N. Otis, '27. Frederick Clieman '26 and Leon W. Brown '25, captain, will fol- low in the order .named. The alter- nates are Wiiiiam J.

Dr. George Herman Derry of the economics department of Union college, will preside as chairman. For the last two years the Philo- matheans have secured the team prize and the individual prize one of these two times. Last year Leon W. Brown, Adelphic, was the individual winner of the $50 purse for the best speaker. Abell Is Awarded Silliman Scholarship The Horace B. Silliman scholarship for the class of 1927 has been awarded to A.

(Continued on page 3) Final Score Is 33 to 15-.St. Stevens Game Scheduled Tomorrow Night The Garnet basketball tean1 opened the 1924-25 season SatuFday night in Albany with an easy victory over th<: representatives of Albany State Col- lege for Teachers. The Garnet had a comparatively simple task in dis- posing of the Albany aggregation to the tune of 33 to 15. Although the playing was a bit ragged at times, both teams acquitted themselves creditably considering the fact that the varsity has •been practicing only a couple of weeks. while the teachers appeared on the floor with one of the best teams in the history of their coHege. This contest gave Coach \Bill\ Hardman an opportunity of trying out most of his first and second string ·players. Both teams showed the lack of ex- perience due to the earliness of the season and loose footwork predomi- nated during the greater part of the contest. Although Union led through- out the game, the Albany quintet kept the Garnet players on .their toes all the time. Due to the vigilance of Stanley and Fink, who held down the guard positions, the teachers were forced to coqtent themselves with shots at long range, most of which went wild. The Garnet showed prom- ise of great future strength in both pass work and field shooting, but failed to make less than half of their free throws. Fink was the first to break the ice in the opening half, scoring on an ,easy shot from under the hasket. A mo- ment later Ripton caged the ball for another tally. Before the bewildered Albany aggregation could find them- selves, Fink and Ripton had each. tal- lied again. Kuczynski and Nephew then crashed through for State and the battle was on. The end of the first half found Union leading, 20 to o. Gai~or, State captain, opened up ·early in the final half with a clean field goal. . Both teams tightened up and neither side scored for several minutes. Skane tossed the ball through the fringe for the Garnet's first tally this half. O'Neil and Fink followed up with bas- kets that put the Garnet away in the lead. With three mnutes to go, Coach Hardman sent in his second string contingent, who success(ully checked the Albanians for the remainder of the game. A share of the credit for Union's victory is due to \Johnny\ Fink who accounted for 13 points, in addition to playing a wonderful defense. Th·~ playing of Captain Stanley, whci is still suffering from football injuries, was exceptional. His work in hold. ing down the opposing forwards was nothing short of sensational.

O!JL'Hed the l'J24-25 season Saturday night in .\lhaay with an easy victory over the rcpre,.,entatiws of Albany State Col- lege for Teachers. The Garnet had a comparatively simple task in dis- posing of the :\lhany aggregation tu the tLtnc of 33 to 15. Althot1gh the playing was a hit raggecl at times, both teams acquitted themselves creditably considering the fact that the varsity has been practicing only a couple of weeks. while the teachers appeared on the floor with one of the best team, in the history of their college. This contest gave Coach \Bill\ Hardman an opp0rtunity of trying out most of his first and second string players. Both teams showed the lack of ex- .perience due to the earliness of th~ season and loose footwork predomi- nated during the greater part of the contest. Although Uni.)n led through- out the game, the Albany quintet l<ept the Garnet players on their toes all the time. Due to the vigilance of Stanley and Fink, who held clown the guard positions, the teachers were forced to content themselves ·with shots at long range, most of which went wild. The Garnet showed prom- ise of great future strength in both pass \vork and field shooting, bt1t failed to make less than half of their free throws. Fink was the first to break the ice in the opening half, scoring on an ,easy shot from under the basket. A mo- ment later Ripton caged the hall for another tally. Before the bewildered Albany aggregation could find them- selves, Fink and Ripton had each tal- lied again. Kuczynski and K ep hew then crashed through for State and thf? batt lc was on. The end of the first: half found Union leading, 20 to o. Gai~or, State captain, opened up early in the final half with a clean field goal. Both teams tightened up and nei tht.-r side scored for several minutes. Skane tossed the ball through the fringe for the Garnet's first tal·ly this half. 0':-J eil and Fink follovved up with has- kets that put the Garnet awa)\ in the leacl. With three mnutes to go, Coach Hardman sent in his second string contingent, who succcss£ully checked the Albanians for the remainder oi the game. A share of the credit for Union'~ victory is clue to \Johnny\ Fink \vho accounted for 13 points, in addition to playing a wonderful defense.

Crane provides another important means of low- ering manufacturing costs in its complete line of factory plumbing fixtures. In many ways this sanitary equipment can be used to bring up efficiency. Toilet rooms and lavatories of ample capacity, placed close to the \population cen.ters\ of the departments they serve, save many wasted minutes. Enough drinking fountains, con- venient to machines and benches, increase production by shortening. the time taken off by workmen in quenchingtheir thirst. Because Crane plumb>ing n1aterials stand up under ordinary, careless usage, they perpetuate these savings o£ time. Their upkeep cost is low, their life much longer than could be expected of ·fixtures made to sell on price alone. When you plan plumbing in.stallations, a Crane specialist at the near:est Crane Branch or Sales Office will be glacl ,to help you select the correct type of fix1ure for each particular requirement.

The subject was de- signed to follow up the remarks made by Rev. Thomas Good on the same topic at the previous Sunday vespers.
