'26 january 11, 19241 INDEFENSO \Some women in every .age drank liquor, a few ·e-ven enjoyed ~ smoke, many of them threw away their honor, but the w:arld has never knov.-ln the turning loose of such an army of hard drinking, ·cigarette- puf.fing, licentious Amazons as walk our streets and invade our ca~p­ uses today\. The above is an excerpt of the bi t:ter denuncia'tiGn of tb c g·irl of today, and in particular the college girl, as quoted by The Nevv York Times yesterday from the speech of Dr. Charles J. Smith, ]Jl\t\Si(lent I of Ron:noke College. After due thoaght and del-iberatir.n 1ve a.re · tempted to brand Pres·ident Smith's spe-ech <).S radical ar.<l represent- ative only of an extreme. There (IJl'e girls-there always have het-n and there probably :alwavs will be-who, no doubt, iall into the category ·which he de-j :scribes, hut we are a little hesitant about swallowing the belief 1hat · ·''an army\ of young women of today, particularly <:o Hege girls, are to I be classed im this fatnilv. In the same issue of The New· York Times: we are wont to read o(the report of the proctor at Cornell University who s-tates that the Cornell co-eel \vill not even allow her friends to \imbihe of liqtwr, to say nothing of drinking herself. Almost daily we reacl of the gain of the newly orgaruized prohibition league among the college students. Such things seem to be contradictO<ry to the o-pinion oi President- Smith regarding the present stwte of the young W<JtrHhll. Girls of the type which is described are to 'be found, but in the minority; for we have but to examine the sihta.tiott which exis1ts in our own sphere of life. ).1any of t·he young women of today smoke, and nry possibly a majority, but whether it is rig-ht for them to puff the ''weed\ is still a. much debated qaestion. It ·is .a c.erta:i.nty thCl!t the position of the female sex today is much different from that which it occupied years previous and it is quite in ... the onler of things that he.r habits should undergo a change. That the average girl of today is given to dri-nk we doubt. It is not a rarity to see a woman drink, but we do hel:ieve that she is in the minority. EFFICIENCY TESTS In this issue of The Concordiensis is a statement sho·wing the percentage of the fre'Shma·n indoor efficiency tests_ The figures on the \\'hole show that a yery high percentage of the :first yerur men ar·e physically fit. The colleges are layi·ng more stress than eve1.\ on physical de- veloptne·nt of their undergraduates and today the pr·oblem of the collc>ge is not only tn fit a man mentally that he ma:y ably follow the pttrsttits of life, but physically as well. It is indeed a bit surprising that 33 per cent of the :lireshmenl cannot swim, but it is a surety that before the chse of the year every member of the class will be able to .s·wim as well as to :be •able to pass. successfully the other requirements. The quality ·which the fres·hmen have shown in the efficie11'cy tests, as well as the ma11mer in whieh the work ha<'l been carried on, 1s one of \vhich we can all feel pt\oud. It is a plea·sttre to note the \Vork of the freshmen in the physical edttca:tio·n <lepartm-en•t as com- pared to four years ago, for the improvement has been a dec•ided one. . .

To all forwards who are playing center \THE little fellow hasn't got the reach. Why don't they put him at forward where he belongs?\ You have heard comment like that about some mis-positioned player. Just look out they don't talk that way about you-not in athletics but in your field of work after college. The world is full of doctors who should have been lawyers, and lawyers who should have been writers-men who can't do their best work because they haven't got the reach. You still can avoid their haphazard choice of a career. Some earnest thinking on the s~bject, ''What do I really want to do in life?'~ will help you decide right. That's a real problem. Get all the advice you can-from the faculty, from alumni. from men in business. If you find you have made a false start, change now and save yourself a lot of grief-for once you graduate into a profession, the chances are you'll stay in it. 11/11 \eSTern E/~ctric Company Wherever people look to electricity for the comforts and con.veniences of life today, the West em Electric ComPany offers 4 service as broad as the junctions of electricity itself.

There is but one way in \vhich the students c<Un make the dan•ces better an·d that is for each undergraduate to assume the responsibility of escort- ing only those yonng women who are aboYe reproach. \\·c must r•ecognize the fact that at each of these dances Union is put on display t~ its guests and the impression that \V.e can make; upon these people 1s not to be overlooked. At each affau· our repu-. tat ion is placed on the auction block, so to speak, and it is up bo the~ stnclcnts themselves to see that our guests do not lea\·e ns with I any misapprehensions as to our ability to dioipline ourel ves. TEAMWORK The garnet baske.tball team is to be congratulated for its ex:-! cellent sho\ving Saturday night against the Crescerut Athletic club. The worcls of Coach Edward Butler of the Brooklyn team best ex:- pr·css the sentiment regarding the work of our team: \The Union team Llesen·ed to win and ·it was due only to the breaks of the game vvhich gave our team the victory. Union has the best team of any we have met thus fnr this seaso11, or hope to meet.'' It falls to our lot, much to our liking. not to praise any one in- div•idnal, hut the vd10le teatn. Teamwork was wholly- responsible for the good account which the terum gave of i1tselL As Coach Hard- man put it, \Esery man played a remarkable game amd much credit i·s cine each one\.

But nobody had thought to do it By bringing electricity down from the clouds over a kite stri~g, it was a simple thing to prove that lightning was nothing more than a tremendous electrical flash. For centuries before Franklin flew his kite in 17 51 philosophers had been speculating about the nature of lightning. With elec ... trifled globes and charged bottles, .others had evolved the theory that the puny sparks of the laboratory and the stupendous phenom- enon of the heavens were related; but Franklin substituted fact for theory·- by scientific experiment Roaring electrical discharges, man-made lightning as deadly as that from the cl<Duds, are now produced by scientists in theRe- search Laboratories of the General Electric Company.

Weyra·uch, Jr. January 18, 1923 EDITORIAL The college man of today is living in an age, so it appeoars, in whioh the chief interest of the clergy i·s not in preaching the teach- ings of Jesus Christ as \vritten in the Bible, but in tewch~ng doctrines. Consequently we find ourseln~ taking less and less ,i,nterest in the churoh an·d the uhimate result is an obvious one. We are losing our religious instinct-our ta 1 ste for all .that is beautiful. We have 'but to examine a few of the thin~s \Vfhidh are of suffi- cient interest as to occupy the undergraduates' mind much of fhe t~me. The movies whi,C'h dl\aw the largest crowds are those tending toward things YUilgar. It seems tlhat the principal rivalry in 1!he motion picture business today is to see which producers can turn out the greatest number of pictures containing sex problems. And why not? It is to the-ir ad vantage to serve the pulYJoic. Likewise the books and pe1·oiodi1cals which are the most ri•sque prove the best sellers. Poetry and books of worth such as contain wholesome f.oo<l iGr thought, pass by unnoticed, except those which the student must persue :for study. Thousands of S\torie~s :are being published whic·h CO'ntain all ~he old vices, but scarcely a one 'is writ- ten of a mother.

Hockey at Union ·has ri•sen rapi·dly in favor wtnung the students and it is ·certain in the near future to gain more populatFty. Already in a number of colleges hockey •is a major sport. In some of the colleges a hockey rink is maintained on an ela-borate I scale, but no such expense nec·d be entered in.to by Union to en-'· c·ottrag-e hockey ~mong the nndergraduates. At a relati,·ely small cost a hockey rink, wi~h a concrete base, could be co·nstructed on the plot of ground, now unused, whi·ch lies east of the Butterfield l\femot'ial chemistry building. Stlldh a founda- i tion would insure icc free from air holes, such as now mar t:he rink. iri i,ts 1wesen't location and at the same tnme means could be taken 1 ~ which \YOtdcl facilitate flood i·ng- it whenever a cold snap prevailed. Snch a location is dose enough to the g-ymnasium as to afford con-; venience. ' The rink at the present time is not only located poorly but it is· etititely too small. As a result of flooding three of the college's best I ten·nis courts, the latter are ma•cle pract'ically useless for early tennis a:hd the whole season is taken up in getting the courts into first class shape. The cost of improdng the courts each spring is als·o in- ·ereasecl. An extens-iv selection of the newest and 'best in shoes wil be shown b .... Harold J.
