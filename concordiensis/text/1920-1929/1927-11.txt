They saw a Garnet team of which tht'V mig-ht. bl' rn•oud, a +c-am which gave persistent an<l detenninl'd Tes·istance to an opposition which was freshened at telling In- tervals bv new men. Thn saw theie team, tem- porarily .outplayed by th~ fresh material, again wear down their opponents and ~mce more bE-gin the forward march. They saw a genUemanly, \Vell- drilled team outplay a rival which ha<l calculated easy victory. Saturday the Union harriers romped away with Fordham. That is the two· teams started romping to- gether but Fordham didn't like to romp :as fast as Union. Result: a perfect score in til~ last home cross- country me~t of the season. Captain Totten and Mac- Millan who have been trotting over Alexander trail for three years ran their last official race over the ·eourse. These veteran Uilion distance men will wi:nd 'UP the s~ason on the Van Cortland Park course in New York in the n~xt two weeks. N. Y. U. is tlte next delegation to be met.

Perhaps these a:re a couple of \moral victorieli,\ but is that anything to be ashamed of? 'Vhile eoliPW' newspapers at'e making con- tinued d'f orts to intp l'O\'l' tlwi r appem·anee, news valut• and trustworthint>s~, the eolkg<' comics are rnpidly allowing themsl·lws to sink low<.·r into the muek of plain st!Iut. The line of tlrl' ri,qul' has advanc-ed far Since \the Yietorian age. Yd there are still strong sta.nd- ards agong us of what is decent and what JS not decent. According to the ~('WI Student, two niorc• colh•ge eomics haw gone into the discard for over- stepping the line. The Sates Bob-Cat and the :olorado Dodo are now no more. A \purit.r num:- bPr\ of the Boh-Cat was so disgi'acdul that the administration f01·hade further pub! ication and the Dodo departed so far from good taste that it abo met a lih· fate. The average joke in college humorous mag- azines is not funn v. Becaulic the .compilers of these publications can \think of nothing funny they re- sort to t·he practicP of toning down vnriou~ p<Jol parlor storil's and printing th(•m,. believing that sueh matter will \take\ wi'th the rmdcrs. U nf()r- tunately, it dol's. One of fhe escapes f.rom open * * * We mentioned last week that there is or at least there used to be an organization known as the Inter- fraternity Council. \\' e wonder what ·has become of it. This famed organization used to meet once in a while. Tt occasionally con_siclereu' matters relatin.-g to fmtern- ities and once in a while ,promulgated some general fraternity policy. It has been suggested that it might meet this year, but evidently the sug:gestion bas not been taken serious·ly. Prrhaps if it is dead, ,,1.7e can pre- vail on the newly revived band to play a funeral march, '!Vhil~ it is l;leing interred. -By ANTTSTOPRANES smut is the couching of guestiona.ble j o'ltes m am- biguous terms. If the administration of tl!e col- lege declares that the joke IS ·dirty, tbe hoard claims that thev didn't mean it that way and that someone has a didv mind. But the staffs o:f these· magazmes have o~ly ·substituted obscenity for humor. College students cannot be :beneflcia...l lca.ders of the country if they tok·ra,te humor wl\ich de- grades. Let them sec' that their hummous mag- azmes are decent first and h1,1morous a·ftenvards. Psycologic Laboratory , ments have not been generally in- pig rush.

Union und('rgraduatt•s lJoa;;t of their athletic teams and their superio!'i ty hut how long C'an this continue when we see pa.raded bdore us a team that far excels our own? It is not a l'nion man who will acknowledge ddeat without at least a mighty attempt. And this attempt is noll\ going on. The l'nion College Band is good. But it laC'ks e'ncourage- ment. 1It lacks uniforms to make it a unit. It has musical abilit.v, but one man cannot play for five others, eYen though h~ is a l'nion man. \Ye are told that tht>re arc at pnsent over fifty men in college who pitt :r band instruments, yet scarcely that number al'e behind th<:> organization. There are instruments in the band room and free instruc- tion on them going begging for men to plaJ them. The Athletic Board is lwhind the Band and is appropriating monPy frn· un ifol'ms. The leaders are behind the Band, giving- time and ability to perfect thl' o1·g-anization. Tlw Student Body is behin.d the Band because it dot·s not wish to remain second to anyone. .At C'olulllbia, each fra ternitv and club has been asked to subscribt• fljty doll a 1:s to the band for new uniforms. The fraternities and neutral org-anizations at Union could help if only they would get out more nwn to play in the band. It is om· college spirit that is touehed. Let's all wark for a real La.ncl. R. E. \V. The men who ha~·e supervised the planning and conshudion of American college campii have as a general rule had a great ]oYe ami desire for the preservation of natuml beauty. The campus of almost any college is in reality a great park with a few building-s in it. '\Ye at Cnion arc fodunate enougl1 in having a campus which, although it is in the heart of a citv, sliH lms ~uch a 8y]van appearance as lo give .one the· impression at .timf's that there is nothing about us but open country. One thing·. howt•nr, which mars the natural at- tractiveness of t hl' gronnd!l i~ the> pok line fo1• fhe Iip;hts and telephone wires. At Hensselaer it has been sugg-ested that a suitfl!ble illuminating system he installed to replnce the antiquated anrl infre- quent arc lights now in use. St. Lawrf'ncc UniYer- sity recently went to considerab.lc trouble to con- struct underground tl'lephonc ducts and install a modern post lighting system on the grounds. There is not a wire ,·isible on the campus at Canton, yet it is as attractin~ and safe by night as it is by da.v; There arc> many dark spots ·O.n our ea.mpus. An iniprowd lighting system would remove them and the coustn.nt potential dangers that lurk within them.

Croft, J,r, TVI~SDAY, NOVF.::l\!BER 8, 1927 The course system of Union was recently liber- alized by the faculty almost without notice from the students although they are the ones who can benefit greatly by it. At the last faculty meeting it was decided that undergraduates who attain an average of at least 85 may upon permission of the dean of studl'nts and the l1ead of some department attend extra courses as listeners. This new de- parture was merely following up the opening w·edge begun by the fac1:1lty last spring when it decreed that men who secured an average better than 85 but less than 90 would be extended the same privileges as those given to men with schol- arly honors. The option of attending extra-schedule classes is not an innoYation in the coHegiate world for it has long been practiced at Harvard and se,·eral other institutions. Nevertheless it is something new at Union and puts an entirely different com- plexion on the appea1·ancc of our educational methods here_ It is giving true education a much better chance. l 1 resent day conceptions of college b·aining often give the erroneous thought that the process of becoming education can be counted in two ways: in terms of dollars and cents and in units of course credits and vears. It is felt hy many men that after they haYe spent a certain number of years in a college, during which they have sat in a cer- tain number of cout·sesj that they are \educated\ and are therefore entitled to thci I' diplomas. This is like saving up cigar coupons for a nickel-silver coffee percolator or an imitation silk umbrel1a. The other misconcepticm is that after the student's money's worth has ·been received the educational faucet should IH• shut off. The idea of 16 hours a year for $800 is analogous to purchasing six pears for a quarter. But the only true education IS the education that the stuclcnt gets through his own efforts. There are some men who come to college to edu- cate themselves. They are not interested in units. And there is no reason why other courses besides tlll·i1· scheduled ones shou'ld .be closed to them. They wish to secure all the broadening and devel- opment which they can possibly get.

Annex, otherwi~e ·known as tJ.re Uni~'ersity of Rochester whereupon. the 'hordes of Rochester gathered up .their Kodaks and a football team • i and hied themsc,hres hither h1 the Mohawk va:le .and prodaimccl that .they were fron1 Missouri and would ha.ve to he shown. Union was willin,g to show the un- defeated skeptics and arranged for a demonstration on the proving grotlllds known as Alexander field. The Kodakers were wa.rncd that there were pictures ahead when the Frosh .pcerade formed for action. The visitors experie.ncrd difficulty in deciding which of the versions of the Temple of 'Health and of Doc Bruce and his staff were correct, but the difficulty was solved by using a IUO\·ie came1·a. The :boa:rd of censors wiH meet Monday and attempt to choose the official version. The football team which \vas an incidental of the invasion went down to defeat in spite of the persistent gains ·by the referee. It is stated that ·he ;became ex- hausted a .few minutes before the end of the game and was unable to carry .the ball further for the Rochester- on.ians. The war correspond'ents in the gym balcony clicked the plays off to Rochester via telegraph and an- nounced that the bacon bat was indefinitely postponed as Rochester fa.iJed to \bring home the bacon\ as ad- vertized. Further reports from the city of camera and clothes stated that sixteen drawings portraying Union being carried out in a stretcher while the giant eyed Wesleyan and Hobart had to be destroyed with an appalling loss of paper and in:k. A new regime of art has 'been intro- duced in Rochester. In the evening some ambitious fraternities hired or- chestras and Rochester danced. The visitors were con- ceded the victory in this struggle. Now peace reigns supreme and the Rochesteronians have takert up legal residence in New York after having the Missourian complex reduced. * * * * Totten and his collea,gues, finding the scenery in the outskirts of Schenectady boring, went to New York Saturday for their customary six mile jaunt. N. Y. U. was also jaunting and Totten and Roth of N. Y. U. enjoyed a pleasant conversation till Totten got so far ahead as to make talking rather difficult. Next Satur- day there will be another ,party at Van Cortland Park, and Alfred is coming. There is going to be lots of fun according to the present indications. * * * * 0. D.

Then, Hortense Alden in the part of the gushing and impulsive niece, and Molly Pearson as the strong and mas- culine-like Aunt Julie were also very good, With the exception of Erskine Sanford in the role of the little old Mr. Pim, the actors in the ~emaining two male parts were fair, but not particularly outstanding. If ·it hasn't already been said so be- fore this was an excellent play at the Wedgeway last night. The pro- duction reflects great credit upon the College Women's Club to have brought such a play to Schenectady, . and even though the unoccupied seats in the last few rows indicated that the affair. may not have been a howl- ing success financially, the high qual- ity and success of the performance itself at least meTits what the football players call a moral victory.

Every glee club knows the constant striving for improvement, for the coordinated smoothness essential to per- fect harmony. So, too, are Western Electric men engaged in the never-ending work of improving the ma- chinery of telephone manufacture and keeping the stream of production flowing smoothly. Even time-honored processes, such as the manipulation of rubber, are under investigation in orc.ler that newer and better methods may be developed. This striving for perfection-a spirit that regards nothing as finally standard nor too 1 nall for further improvement -permeates the Western Electric organization and offers invit- ing opportunity for alert minds.

Yet the outcome of Saturday's game at Clinton ca11ses even the most enlightened among us to won- der why Union did not defeat Hamilton and to softly whisper, \Jinx.\ By all the evidence, Union should havP overcome Hamilton. Coach Leary's team had a much moee creditable season behind it than did the Hamiltonians; the Garnet players were in top form, they were primed for the fig-ht; the Unionists outplayed their rivals in e:very way, but still they did not win. Why was it! The coach, the team, .the band, the cheer leaders, the student body, everyone, apparently did his part. The coach and the team a1:e to be congratulated upon the effOl't that they :put into the gmne, the others ]or the support wh.ich they gave te their l'epresentatives.

THE GREAT CALM l\Iarch used to be considered the dullest Hme of the year at Union because there was ithen nothing exciting going on.

Now, it seems, \Ve are. to have two doldrums, one for each semester. The faculty doubtless had the best inten- tioHs in the world when it curtailed the ath- letic schedules_ It was intimated that too· many trips were taken by the -various teams and .that the men on those teams were suffering in their grades because of the work which they 1lost while they were away. 'This may have been true but it is not possible that the college a.s a whole will be benefited by the faculty's adion in abbreviating the serveral sport cards. It is a well known fact that many men have remained at the college, week ends, instead of going home merely becaus~ they wished to see some particula1: g·ame. With the schedttles shortened, there will b€ less inducement for these men to remain here over the Sunday :pe- riod. lt is not to be expeeted that the undEr- graduates as a whole, because they have thEir Saturday after-noons and 11ights free, will de- vote more time to their books.

Totten was master of ceremon.ies at the party .though Alfred thought .it ought to have the honors. Anyway Totten romped in far enough ahead to win the indi- vidual honors in the Middle Atlantic cross country run with about sixty yards to spare. The other Union run- ners bunched a •Jittle ways ·back of Totten so as to win by a score of 27 and the two year champions had to relinquish their title. There wer.e really only two teams in the race, Alfred and Union. The other teams were the also-ran class. For individual honors the race was between Totten and Roth of N. Y, U. Union had a small but active cheering section that appeared on various ·parts of the course and informed the general public that the Garnet crew was winning. Mayor Walker wasn't around to give the boys a key to the city and besides it is stated that he hasn't any more keys left. But even the charms of \Manhat- tan Mary\ or \the Follies\ failed to attract laurel crowned lads and the victors returned without attempt- in~ to include the theatres in their conquest. * * * l!nion disregarded Union hours Saturday, closed up shop and started for Clinton by diverse ways and means. Hamilton prepared to run on a Union basis and was ready to welcome the Schenectadians. Other persons not connected wHh Hamilton were also ready to welcome some Union men. In fact several reported a rather informa:l reception in the home of a judge along the way. It only cost five bucks to hurry a little, and besides it was worth the five bucks to get warm. Coincidental with the visit was a football game, which was nothing spectacrrlar. The Buff and Blue were evidently stronger than predicted and a six and six tie was .the result. The main contest came after the game, marred by a few such irregularities as fake prohibition agents who said because Vermont is wet was no reason why Clinton and Utica should be, and who charged $100 for their services and advice. The football team had an exciting time going and coming .playing sign games and spellmg contests. • * * * \Ain't it a shame\ to sing such songs in chapel. Yes we had l1eard rumors before that negroes could and did occasionally sing other songs than spirituals. We ·had proof last week and most of us enjoyed the proof. At least it was a variation from the seven-dai)'S· a-week chapel .procedure which has ceased to hold many charms for us, especially when all five chapel-mates get mixed up in their schedule and all come on the same day. J.t appears that the stu·dents enjoyed even those songs that were not spiritual. \Ain't it a shame.\ We had ought .to have a rule about it! By ANTISTOPHANES. night clubs, all furnish amusement. The st\1- dents determined long ago. how much time they would spend upon their studies and no reduc- tion of the sport schedule by the faculty will cause them to devote more. While it is possible that the members of the various teams may not rank as high in scholar- ship as do other groups in the college, it is to be doubted if they will benefit to any degree by curtailment of the athletic schedules. A man can put forth his greatest effort when he is running at top speed, just as any machine will do. The athletes will no longer be running at top speed. 'l.'hey will, 'f11rther:r,n,ore, not have the benefits of their squad training for so long a period. And lastly ,the members of the vari- ous teams will be thrown with the rest _of the students, and thElY will in consequence take up the pleasUl'es. with which the other undergradu- ates pass away their idle time. - ,:: ~· -' The-KOZY KORNER ',);' . : ' .

Tidmarsh, director of 'Il.Usic at Union College, will give his usual Sunday organ recital in the Me\ moria! Chapel at 4:oo o'clock on No- vember 20. He will be assisted by two violinists, Dr. Arthur Geismar, of the modern language department, and Joseph Kreinin, a member of the stu- dent body. This trio was planned for last Sunday, as announced, but Dr Geismar's absence from town made it impossible. These organ recitals will not be broadcasted again ov:er vVGY until further notice.

Freshmen Will Also Run In addition to the varsity, Coach Bruce will also take seven freshmen harriers to New York. Just who these men will be is still a problem to the coach. The yearling runs have taken place since 1920 with Yale as the win- ner in three of the six. The Garnet freshmen have no individual stars, but their team has strength was roughly showed last week when they finished six men ahead of the entire Albany Pharmacy group. Full teams for the varsity race have been entered by the following col- leges: C. C. N. Y,, Columbia, Cor- nell, Dartmouth, Fordham, Harvard, Holy Cross, 1-fanhattan, Maine, M. I. T., N. Y, LT., University of Pennsyl- vania, Penn. State, Pittsburg, Prince- ton, Syracuse, Union and Yale. In the freshmen race the same col- leges with the exception of Fordham, Harvard and Holy Cross will be rep- resented while Rutgers will be added to the list. The varsity men who will compete for the Garnet are: Captain Totten, Heath, Sa.,vtelle, Rothman, Mc:Vfillan and F. \Voodworth. Previous in tercollcgia te winners have been: (Continued on Page 3)

RETURNING TO PAIRNASSUS In answer to a letter from Mr. Dmper, '97, a couple of weeks ago The Concordiensis ex- plained that there was no literary magazine at Union because the men in the college were not interested in that form of activity. We were wrong and hasten to correct the enor. Inci- dentally the main body of students may be surpr·ised that there is a definite move on foot Lo give to the colJege a literary magazine. Ti tt'i'e is ou the campus, it seems, a small !.Jut earnest group of professors and students who are not content with wishing that Union might have a literary publication !.Jut are seri- ously contemplating starting such an organ. These men are of the type who get things done, who are real activities men, and The Concordi- ensis wishes them success in their plans. The chief obstacle in the way of tJ.1e new p!'Oject i~ on<' of dollars and cents. It is gen- erall:-.· l'elt in the collegiate world that literary magazines are not supposed to make money. If the publication can be supported in no other way, we propose an additional tax on the stu- dent body. The cost per man would be slight and the results well worth the small outlay. There are, however, some of the interested gl'Oup who fear that the periodical might be only a flash in the pan.

You suspect you are in for some grand pipe-sessions the minute you get a whiff of P.A.'s aroma. The first pipe-load confirms your susp1c1ons. What a smoke, Fellows! Remember when you asked for the last dance and she said ~~You've had it!\? P. A. is cool, like that. And sweet as know· ing that she didn't really mean it. Sweet and rueUow and mild and long-burning. Put your pipe on P. A. You can hit it up to your heart's content, knowing ll'l advance that P. A. will not bite your tongue or parch your throat. That one quality alone gets P.

Millions of contented j itntny- pipers will tell you that Prince Albert commands a pipe to stand and deliver. You suspect you are in for some grand pipe-sessions the minute you get a whiff of ·P.A.'s aroma. The :first pipe-load confirms your suspicions. What a smoke, Fellows! Remember when you asked for the last dance and she said ~~You've had it!\? P. A. is cool, like that. And sweet as know· ing that she didn't really mean it. Sweet and mellow and mild and long-bur1ting. Put your pipe on P. A. You can hit it up to your heart's content, knowing in advance that P. A. will not bite your tongue or parch your throat.

This, says the New Student, is a new kind of education, unheard of twenty years ago when such magazines as Jtarpe1·'s were attacking· the colleges for theh- alleged \monasticism:' It is also I'eported that ~he Ya.le Daily Ne\-Vs bi-weekly supplement,. On Na• ti()nal Affail's, has been causing considerable comment for its weighty treatment E:lf items of national impol'tance. The .supplement is an effort on the pal't of the News to make the unclergTaduates view the outside world_ But it must not be assumed that the News is forget- ting 'the collegiate world for its editor recently attacked the fraternities as snobs and decided menaces of the American colleges. being soc:ieties of to the democracy I~ is to be fea-red in this case that the News editor is li'ke 2 voice crying in the wilderness but without a. 1nessiah to follow him up in his work 'The News' experiment of trying •to build Ut> in the students a knowledge of wm·1d affairs is interesting and that is about all that can be .sa.id of it.

There are thus two types of men in any college, those who are ·interested in the world about them and those who are not.

Mauger FRIDAY, l'-;0\'E~IllEH 25, 1927 PICK YOUR COLOR The art of America is assuredly growing by leaps and bounds! It is 11ow possible to buy not only fountain pens and pencils in shades of sky blue, Nile green or lead l'ed, but also type- writers which will match the decorations of the kitchen, parlor or bath. The automatic ciga1•ette lighter we may expect almost any day now will cause to be offered for sale matches with tips and sticks to harmonize with the upholstery of the smoking room or the limousine. No longer does anyone look to see whether or not the fountain pen has the best, most durable and useful point for the purpose to which it will be turned. The deciding point in the purchaser's mind is whether or not the shade of the pen is compatible with his temper- ament. One does not count the cost or the mechanical perfection and .performance of the typewriter when buying such an article, it is the way in which the pretty band about the mid-section of the typewriter will harmonize with the drawing room draperies that deter- mines the sale. If the college fence were painted a decided garnet the enrollment of undergraduates would remain the same as it is now. Education is one thing in life which is not determined by color, shade or hue. It is quite possible that the very fact education cannot be set off into various color categories is what saves it from becoming the toy of the mobs, is why such a few men really become highly educated. There is one primary ,concern of the men who come to college with an earnest desire to become edu- cated, it is the elements 0f that education which interest them. They want to k11ow if the parts of the curriculum can be combined into a good whole. And will that whole be the best edu- cation that they can get? Is it the sort of education that they want? Will the return on their education be a sufficient recompense for the time and energy which they ai·e going to place in it? But there are, nevertheless, colors figura- tively painted around every college fence. It is the showy, lighter, less important and, gaudy things . of college that combine to make this color 011 the fehc<3. Some men, when they are trying to decide which college they wish to 'FHE.

Plan o'f Periodica·l Arranged Tentative arrangements as .t0 the· nwke up and style o.f composition were made in preparation for the first £ew issues. It was decided to have. the make-up of the publica-tion coa- form in a general way to tha-t 0f the N c-w Republic except that the pF·int is to be smaHer and the page diYided. into four columns. The plan of com-: position has been left to the editorial board to be organized soon. The ar- rangcnl.en t, talked of at the meeting, is to include in each issue one tnai11 essay on a literary or philosoph-ical· topic and severa:l shorter articles ei thcr essays or short stories. A sec- tion in the latter pages of the maga- ·dne is to be devoted to reviews of current books by various members of the student body. The organized work in conjunction ,vith the publication is to be carried Jn .further at a later meeting of the backers of the magazine.

Mauger Tl'ESDA Y, NOYEl\lREil 29. 1D27 AD CAPTANDUM VULGUS That the Ichabod Spencer lectures have been interesting this year is attested by the number which the series has drawn to the Old chapel. The committee in charge is to be congratulated upon its choice of such excellent speakers. One group noticeably lacking at these lec- tures is the student body. It would appear that almost everyone else in the college but the students themselves attends the lectures. The number of undergraduates who are taking ad- vantage of the opportunity to secure a little more of that liberal thought and knowledge of facts which go to make up the educated man is small, entirely too small to indicate much in- terest on the part of the students in anything intellectual. It is to be feared that the :men in the colleg.e are chiefly concerned with securing a diploma and that beyond that their minds a1·e closed. Or perhaps there are so many keys to be gotten by attending the sessions of various organizations that there are no free evenings to devote to such a prosaic thing as a lecture. It is this very disinterestedness on the part of the students that has lost to the college and to the city one of the greatest cultural influ- ences which has iately been offered here: the winter musical concerts in the Memorial chapel. lt is understood unofficially that these concerts are to be discontinued because they have been so poorly supported that it was not possible to make them successful even financially. The students are not alone to be condemned for allowing these concerts to be given up ; the people of Schenectady have not been over- zealous in attendance. But the undergradu- ates should remember that the concerts were started primarily for their benefit, that the price was lowered that all students might have the means to go, and that they should have been the ones to show the way to others. But culture cannot be rammed down the throats of men. It would be easier to give the students what they like. We propose a lecture group with Judge Ben Lindsey, Aimee Se1nple MacPherson and \Big Bill\ Thompson as head- liners and a concert series by Paul Whiteman, Eddie Cantor and Gilda Gray. MONEY TALKS The decision of the college to make an addi- tional charge of twenty-five dollars for each course repeated wiil come as a sucyrise to many of the undergraduates. It has, at least, caused considerable comment among them. It is explained by the administration .that the new provision concerning repeated courses comes about not so much from a desire to meet the additional expense but rather from a wish to penalize those students who have failed in THE CONCORD~ENSIS, 'l'UESDAY, NOVEMBER 29, 1927 ..;..::.._··-·· - -:=================:;::;::::;:::::- .... -·- - = :, ·~ ~Let The 'Grecian Dream~ ! == == 55 sa 5 = cE i Once upon a time there was in a grea-t instit-ution of learning a Tidd•lywinks team, which practiced' now and then and occasiona:lly played a tluilHng match with some of the foreign teams ·that in,vacled its territory a<nd challenged the laurels. Now this tean1 was not a.n official oft-spring of that famed i11stit-ution of 'learning, yet that Alma Mater looked· with favor upon it and a:Howed it to exist. Indeecl it clothed that team with raiment suitable fot- the ravages of the tiddJ,ywinks contests and withal looked with approval upon its e!Torts. * * * Now this tcatn, being desirous of coming into .the ptrblic eye, sought hy divers ways and means to adver- tise itself. Accordingly the Tiddlywinkers did plea and make application for stories and comments in the jour- nal that flourishecl in that seat ,of knowledge, and the powers that be did give ear and .heed to the earnest supplication of the Tiddlywinkers, and dispatched forth- with a reporter unto the manager of the Tid4lywinks team to get a thrilling account of past, present and futur.e battles. * * * It happened tha·t this reporter came to the mana:get, or at least that pet·son commonly delegated as sucl1, and requested information for a story. The manager did then and there wax eloquent, gave the reporter an earful and the reporter did repa·ir unto his place of business and write a story for the journa'l. Now it came to pass that when that story was pub-lished, a Tiddlywinker did read the story, and quoth he, \I did not know about this. Forsooth sometlting must be rotten in the state of Tiddlywinl<s, that I did not know about this. I am not captain of the team, neither am I manager, but withal I am a great tiddlywinker, and I was not consulted. * * * \Bchoid I shall go and sock the guy what done it, for be it known that I am a mighty soccer.\ Where- upon he did venture forth and said \Egad thy publica- tion is full of wet hay, and I do not like thy tiddlywinks story. I was not consulted and indeed thy writings are all wrong. Am I not a fine player and have I not drained many a stine, yet I :was not consulted. What matters it that I am not the manager, nor yet the cap- tain, I will show thee how to run thy paper.\ * * * Now Tiddlywinks may be withal a very worthy sport and in need of commendation but the way to obtain commendation is not to sock the press that advertises you. Sock not lest ye be socked, an·d cast not stum- bling blocks in thy way for the way of the soccer shall thereby be made difficult. their work. Yet the college could not be harshly criticized if it did have some thought for whatever e:xpense is involved in allowing men to repeat a subject. Much as we like to imagine that education is not a question of dollars and cents and to believe that education should place no financial burden upon those who really wish it, we must confess that such ideas are nothing more than fancies and that it does actually take money to run a college. Until the day comes when our colleges are so well endowed and ·supported by their friends that they no longer have to worry about costs. it is necessary that the colleges must look to their financial stability. It has perhaps occurred to some that a fairer and more equitable arrangement than the pr:es- ent system of blanket tuition would be one whereby each course had a specified charge. By this means such incidentals as laboratory fees for many of the scientific courses could be added in on the initial charge and would not come as so much extra. And the value of a subject could be determined somewhat by its listed price. Rhetoric, for instance, would be worth about one dollar a year. Special ar- rangements could also be made for men who have honors, listening privileges, or who ar€ taking extra courses. But under such a system the penalty would he buried.
