The only re- striction on a student is tha~ at the end of the examination he signs a pledge stating that he has neither given nor received assistance. In regard to the new idea of student government, extending self- rule to questions oi morals, President Hibben said: Mysteries Unfold To Fraternity Freshmen Over the Week-End \We are now taking a further, and we believe, important step in the direction oi student government. The Senior Council has ask- ed permission of the Discipline Committee to take up· a type of case freshmen were initiated into the mys- which heretofore has been diHicult to deal with fairly and justly, t.eries of Delta Phi, Psi Upsilon, Delta students being unwilling to report the misdeeds of their fellows to Upsilon and Phi Delta Theta. The · 11 b k h victims were: an outside body. It has occastona y een nown, owever, to them that certain members of the university are guilty of conduct which is detrimental to tlie good name of Princeton and the moral tone ol the place. \The Senior Council has, therefore, requested permission to take up these cases on its own initiative, to· examine them, and to reco- mend to the faculty what punishment is to be meted out. They are allowed to withhold the evidence upon which their case is based. After the student has appeared before them and has been given a fair trial they merely make the recomendation to the Faculty Committee and in case the student feels a~ injustice has been done him, he may appeal his case from the decision oi the council to the Discipline Committee of the university, and then his case is brought before that body with all the evidence. The resolution adopted by the faculty requires a three-quarters majority of the council to convict. Dean McClenahan, commenting on the action, said: \Their attitude toward their fellow-students is what one would expect. They ar.e, on the whole, more severe in their judgements than the members of the faculty, and even more bloodthirsty than I,, A year ago a student committed an offense which would have been dismised with a reprimand if he had made a frank statement and explanation.

It also manifested itself in the cheers that were given for him when he declared a similar penalty against a varsity player. Wilber played a stellar game for the varsity, caging a total of three field baskets and 11 fouls, ·in all 1'7 points. His foul shooting was one of the features of t'he game, as he shot 11 01.1 t of 15 tries from the 15-fo .. >t line. He played basketball from the opening whist! e to the end, and his work was highly instrumental in 'the Rinaldi put the varsity back int::> the running by repeating Roof's mid- court shot. With two minutes of p[ay left, Wilber shot two foul goals and Houghton dropped in one. Twenty seconds from the end a foul on the varsity gave Houghton a chance to tie the score.
