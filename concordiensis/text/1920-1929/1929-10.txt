Jpeaker At Sunday Chapel .Advo- cates Philosophy Of Love Preached By Jesus That two theories or philosophies ,are extant regarding the settle- ment of disputes was the messa.ge that the Rev. Theodore \Valser, 'ro delivered in chapel Sunday m.orning . That of Mars, or settlement by violence, he considered altogether impractical and unable to be religi- ously considered by any peaceful and law-abiding person. The other philosophy, that advocated by Jesus during His life on earth, was the philosophy of love. Reverend Walser is a missionary in Tokio, Japan, where he h<!~ been stationed during the last thirteen years. He is affili<j.ted with the Alpha Delta Phi fraternity. Wl1ile in college he played football and was the managing editor of The Concordiensis. Violence Wrong Reverend ·walser introduced the subject first thmugh his selection of the scriptures which he l'eacl preceding the sermon. He pointed out in the story of Cain and J\!bel, and in one which concerned the period of Christ's life, that tl1ere were two ways to punish offenders. One was by a physical punishment which tortured the body, the other by kindness, a method which tortur- ed the conscience. The wrong method is the phH- osophy of Mars, or violence.

CORNER STATE and BROADWAY· From an engraving of the time in Harper's Weekly Autumn of '79 (\'] r. )HILE Yale and Princeton were battling to a tie lJLJ at Hoboken, New Jersey, a small group of scien- tists, directed by Thomas A. Edison, was busy at Menlo Park, only a few miles away. On October 21, their work · resulted in the first p~a.ctical incandescent lamp. Few realized what fifty years would mean to both elec- tric lighting and football. The handful who watched Yale and Princeton thea has grown to tens of thousands to-day. And the lamp that glowed for forty hours in Edison's little laboratory made possible to-day's billions of candle power of electric light. In honor of the pioneer achievement, and of lighting progress, the nation this year observes Light's Golden Jubilee. Much of this progress in lighting has been the achieve- ment of college-traifled men employed by General Electric. • JOIN US IN THE GENERAL ELECTRIC HOUR, BROADCAST EVERY SATURDAY AT 9 P.M., E.S.T.

Werle · A Faculty Remark At the Wagner garne Sat11rday a promineni. i!Ylember of · the fac,.Lrlty made a r.emark which we conside:l' ve:ry impor- tant and interesting. His words were sometlting like this: \The cheering is pretty good, isn't it? Lf .the upper~ clast:men and the rest of the freshmen had on:].:y turned out for the game, it v:ould be a whole lot better t!Lo;ugh.'' We defended the ttpperclasslnen by offe:ri.n.g th.e sug- gestio:n that they were in the reseTved seat ,section with trremhers of the fair sex. His answer was : '\ A.r;e the1.·e six 'mndred of tiiem there?\ Undoubtedly there were not. rhere might have been five hundred students altogether neluding freshmen, possibly more, but not nearly the en- tire student body. Surely the opening game (!Jf the season ieserves a one hundred percent turnout! At the same time it occurred that there r:nig--h t be some liff.erent arrangement so that all who wish to· might take }art in the cheering. The seating inight be .so arranged as ,o allow all Union men, with or without escorts, to sit on the ~ame side of the fie1d, or else have cheer lea!lel's on both .lides o:f the field. With present conditions, 0Ie latter sug-. :restion s.eems best. How about it, cheer leade:rs? After experiencing the Wagner game frem the press ;able, we are convinced that something ough.t to be .done 1bout the scoreboard, a sugg·estion which we ins.er,ted in this ~olumn about a week ago. The scoreboard is ,~f little value to the press or to the spectators in itself, but w-h.en the two men who m·• operating it sit on a plank direct1v in front of the figures they hang on the board, we mig:ht Jl.lSt as well have a cow standing; there for all the infor1ntttion that it imparts reg-arding t~e game. As for the game itself, Saturday, it was a:n auspicious ')eginning for what we expect will be a migbt:y .successful 1€ason. It isn't the fact that w.e beat Wagne:r l)'y an over- ·,rhelming .score, but the way the Garnet wen. i; about beat- ng them. 'The baclcfield functioned like a slday-, new ma- ~hine. There vvere no slips, no misplays. Th·'€ basiness of rouncing the visitol's was carried on in a smo()tb, rnechan- ~al way. The backs proved speedy, shifty, .tt:11a capable of )attling and crashing through the oppositio11. The broken ield running was pretty to watch Columbia viii have plenty of watching to do. The precision of the backfield might pos.sfh1y- tend to Jvershadow the Garnet forward wall. We can\t forget that ~t was the linesmen who opened the holes for ,th.e backs to ·)low through, it was the linesmen who dum.p·Ed the Green defense all over the field. Intramural Athletics From an intramural standpoint, Union is rapidly at-· taining the prominence that many of the ot:her <!olleges of the country now possess. It is the sole intent ()T th€ athletic . department of Union College to institute a ::program of sports and athletic events that will offer ev,en undergrad- uate the opportunity of actively participating J•ll. some com- petitive form of athletics. If the program o:f .t:h.€ interfra- ternity .sports gains the interest and ·support of the under- gTaduate body, it has accomplished its main IJl:llrp(}se. From ~he standpoint of the athletic department, tll:Ese athletic • .events afford an opportunity to uncover some promising material that might never reach the light of day. Last year three n.ew forms of intramural a-thlEtics were introduced with great success into the alrea.-<\y extensive '9rogram. The innovation of touch football. pr()ved t<~ be one Jf the most popular games that has ever been attempted at Union. Over twenty teams were represented,. including a ~·roup of approximately one hundred and seveutr-five un- lergraduates who participated in this form -of. ex:ercise. In .he spring the popular rural pastime of former <loitege years, ~1orseshoe pitching, again came into its own at college. It has its advantages, in that it requires comp~ra:,tively little coom, can be laid out in space otherwise idle; a11.d is. a V.e1•y noderate, yet ·fascinating form of intramuraJ athletics. 3tatistics have show11 that over five hundred of tho€ students Jf the college were actively engaged in this spo:rt .. • u Vis] To Learyt Lon: FI1 Lippiti ' Worl. the G: its wa theW exandc the 01 The ( the bu ner ir mid-se dieted son 1 ery d<: helple: final \ 'I' he was w ing fe. were There stodgi Union the sp pitt VI runnit1 punts, seys o twent~ andre feet G Wagn ripped tackle large!: partie· educa1 placen after · Cap field ' I prove• were the ki fa·iled Wagn left Ii Wa Unior were first < compl attem forwa and tl 120 PI tors, saved troun Fif1 the st the s made forwa skirt out g. sustai net at fense worb T'hc cente down On t ball ( swep1 teart1 stopp gan fot· 5 tackle first ball:: Yards Oti t Yards

Maintenance crews performed the same service as did tele- phone men in the signal corps in the war. In the daily life of the nation, just as surely as in emergency, the telephone meets an ever-growing stream ofdemands.

Winner of toss: Freshmen Harriers Run, Full Three Mile Course The freshman cross-country team will open its schedule with R.P.I. on October 26 over the Ale:xaHder conrsc. The t.<•am a·ppcars str01ug and Coach Stevens expects to de- velop six or seven ou tstandir1g run- ners from the squad of thirty. The first few practice sessions consisted of four or five 1 aps a- round the track but the hill and dalers arc now covering tbe entire course daily. Nothing bright .can be p,redicted yet, but the squad shows hopes of an even break at least fat· the season. The schedule is said to be one of the hardest the freshman team has had in years and the Union cnb harr1crs will have to step all the way to keC'p thrir score on the winning side. , o<tgate. atur ay Garne.t Opens Cross Country Sea• son Against Strong Maroon Team Here The varsity cross-conntl'y team 1s practicing daHy lR preparation for theit· first meet Saturday with Colgate on the Alexander cour.s.e. From aH reports Colgate presents a 111os t formidable team this year and led by Captain Dunbar who has been the Hninstay of tJ:Le team in pas:t years, they should .offer very stiff competition. Time trials were held yesterday and will also be held this Wednes- day so that Coach Bruce may se- lect the men who will represent Uriion Satmday. Athough Coach Bruce is. not encouraged with the outlook .for the coming season, he hopes .that with continued practice to round a team into shape which will keep the slate clean from de- feats. Captain Rothmann and Lee Heath, two veterans of several seasons, are back i1;1to shape as are Nigriny, Aussicker, and O'Conner. This year's schedule, which in- cludes several dual meets as well as the Middle Atlantics and the I. C. A. A. A. A., 1s extremely difficult and the team will do well to come out victorious in the ma- jority o.f the meets. The Haver- ford meet which was scheduled for November 9, has been cancelled and the team will probably take part in a quadrangle meet in New York on that date.

I I of the Etigimering Bt!ilding, Holcombe Disscc t ~­ Political Partie-s Day Lecturer Defines Political Parties And Shows Difference Between Them Negligible Dr. Arthur :-.r. HolcomLC', pro- fessor of Government at H an·ard university, spoke on Po.Jitic<d Par- tics last night in thr Old chapel. The lecture was sponsored lly the Joseph P. Day Foundation. The purposc of Dr. Holcombe's speech was to take the facts familiar to his audience and present them in a new J:ight. He gavr st·vcral dt'finitions of the term \politi-cal parties,\ onr of which was written by Edward Bmkc which stated that it was a party of men united for promotion of public- interest upon a Jlrinci- ple of some kind to which the party agrees. A narrow minded definition of political parties is the purpose of getting· an office for personal gain and the pown that g-oes with it. Principles Are Same Dr. H olcombc proceeded to show that the differences in the princi- ples of the Democratic and Repub- lican parties \\'ere so minor that the casual observer could not no- tice them. .\ Jlrize offered by the Baltimore Daily Sun for the best definition of a Republican or a Democrat was awarded to the \Hil- l'!' of the following: \A Republi- can is one who thinks the nemo- cratic a<hninistration is had for bllsiness :mll a Drmorrat is one who thi11ks the Rcpubiican admin- istration is bad for business.\ Dr. Holcombe quoted several writers of Yarious stages in the history of l·nitcd ::;tatcs political campaigns antl all of them statt>d that there were no differences be- twecn the two parties at the time of the writing but that there used to be a great difference in their principles. Slogans Mean Little \:\ political campaign is no more than an advertising enterprise,'' stall'S Dr Holcomb. ThC'rdOt-~ the ;1ppeal of an advertisement is to the height of the mental it v of the public. Take hory soap ;s ;tn ex- ample; it floats and is 99 _pjwo rrr cent pure but they do not state what is purity is .or what the :;6/Ioo of impurity contains. The same way with the automobile ad- \ertisements.

Coach Hyland has done wonders with the team, and in addition he has a number of men who know football from prep or high school experience. They open their seasan this Saturday with the Hoosac School and from the way in which they have torn through all opposition in the practice scrimmages, it looks as though Hoosac were in for a trouncing. Cross Cou.ntry Hopes The meet with Colgate Saturday affords an i11dication of what may be expected from the· Garnet l1arriers in the remainder of the meets on their schedule. Captain Rothmann and Heath ran well, although unable to beat the colored 1\famon flash. It was 1:1p to orie of the remaining Union runners to place bette1· than sev~ enth to win the meet for the Ga1·net. But Captain Du.nbar and two of his teammates maintained a good lead over the remaining · men on t<he Union team during the entire race. The main reason fo1.· the loss of the race, therefore, seems to have been the lack of more experienced runners on the Garnet team. l\'Io1•eover, Nigriny and Aussicker started practice late in the season, and too much could not be expected of them, Now Coach Bruce's men have a chance to get into better shape. )Vith one meet behind them and a week to go beto·re the next, bhey should he able to work themselves into the b~st of condition and give some support to Heath and Rothmann. One loss a season is enough. R. P. I. Bonfire· Due to the fact that nine men had to be bailed. out of ja.illast · year wnd t11e complaints of many wtathful people had to be sooth- ed, R. P.

When he was questioned con- cerning his idea on the part that American colleges can play in bringing about the world state which he mentioned in his lecture, he pessimistically answered, \h all depends upon the individuaL He should ad;vocate it and play his part in the formation of public op- inion. An immense num.ber of such individuals can probably hope to realize this end. Of course this all rests upon the nature of the in- dividual. He should develop his talents according to his particular place in the industrial order until he has reached an influential point; then he would have an opportunity to express his opinion and pr.ob- ably would be listened to by the masses.\ The entire interview was secured under the stress due to the clamor for introductions and autographs ·by many students.

The announcement made by Director of Athletics Bruce, that .fall lacrosse practice will again be held this year is a wel- come one. Lacrosse has become one of the most popular sports on the schedqle and has been given the .support of the under- graduates. With the appointment of Harry Redinger, '31, as amateur coach for the fall training, pr.actice will begin Monday. Although a gre·at deal cannot be accomplished due to the lack of time and due to the fact that many of the veterans are en- . gaged in fall sports, the training will serve to give new: ca-ndi- dates an opportunity to learn how to handle a lacrosse stick. ----------------------- 0.

SOPHOMORE GYM NOTICE ly realized, but he also completed • inventions making possible the quadruplex, sextuplex, and multi- plex telegraph systems. In 1868 he made his first patent- ed invention, the Electric Vote Re- corder. This was the first in a life full of inventions, improvements in inventions, and discoveries. His history from then until the present day is a history of service to man- kind. On October 21st, 1§.79, he perfected what is perhaps his most famous invention, the incandescent electric lamp. On this day the first lamp embodying fhe principles of the modern incandescent lamp was put in circuit and maintained its incandescence for over forty hours. In the same year he constructed ·the first electric motor ever made for a circuit of I IO to 120 volts. The following year he established the first incandescent lamp factory at Menlo Park, N. ].
