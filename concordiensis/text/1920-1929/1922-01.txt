Anthony Mastrianni. I again. Saturday, January 7, 1922 =====~=========~===========================~=~ A TIME FOR WORK If ever there were a time for real earnest \vork, it is now. Only a few days remain before mid-year examinations, the testing time for students. Every man in college should resolve that in the next few weeks he will put aside all evening engagements, curtail all time- taking activities and devote himselit seriously and studio·usly to col- lege work. The moment requires a sacrifice, yet the reward is worthy of the ·effort. To lose an oportunity ior a college education or to waste .a hali year hy leaving in January, is too high a price to pay for pleas- ure or idleness today. Learning thoroughly every lesson every day will assure con- tinuance of life as a coHegian for the balance of the year. It will also preclude the necessity o:f making rather excuses during Junior \Prom\ week and spare the man that dreadful moment when! • he rnust enter his family home and admit that he was not big enough to stay in college. There will be no available alibis ior men who lose out in mid-years; marks oi black on pages white will flaunt their every attempt to make excuse. And so to work l The testing time is not long. Every effort 1 will count. There is no need to taste defeat if one but show a will- ing heart and cheerful. Defeat is never a certainity until it arrives and no man should give up, nor even then, until he sees the Old Green Gate loom in his wake and not his ofiing. To work then today! And tomorrow! And may every Un- ion n'lan return in Ferbruary!

I N an or~inary fu~nace ma~erials burn ?r combi~.e with. the- oxygen of the air. Melt zmc, cadmmrn, or lead man ordmary furnace and a scum of \clross\ appears, an impurity formed by the oxygen. You see it in the lead pots that plumbers use . In a vacuum furnace, on the contrary, the air is pumped out so that the heated ob: ect car..::ot combine with oxygen. Therefore in the vacuum furnace impurities are not formed. Clearly, f· e chemical processes that take place in the two types are different, and the difference is impCTrtant. Copper, for instance, if impure, loses in e~ectrical conductivity. Vacuum-furnace copper is pure. So the vacuum furnace has opened up a whole new world of chem. .. ical investigation. The Research Laboratories of the General Electric Company have been e:~ploring this new world solely to :End cut the possibilities under a new series of conditions. Yet there have followed p::-actical results highly important to industry. The absence of o;~idation, for instance, has enabled cherr.ists to co:.;:J.bine metals to form new alloys heretofore impossible. lnceed,. tre vacuum furnace has stimulated the study of metallurrical proc~ esses and h2s become indispensable to chemists responsible for proCuction of metals in quantities. And this is the result of scientific research. Discover new facts, add to the sum total of human knowledge, and sooner or later, in many unexpected ways, practical results will follow.

That quotation from a recent popular and successful bode;: nmy be considered as not only the really vitalless.on of the writte11 story, but a secret to success and happiness. And after all success and happiness are the things most ~ought in life. The man who doesn't play fair will live to regret it. His. gai•s may seem great in the light o£ the Present, bnt there is yet to ·con1e a cold, hard future, a day of reckoning when tl'Jle accumulated little oc- · currences o£ every day become the mountain of ad verse evide11 ce. It is then that the temporary gains lose their glamor; then iiba. t the qualms of conscience overwhelm; and then that is learned .tile sad lesson of a game not worth the prize. No victory is complete unless it be far.irly won. A tlKJUsand words will scarcely down one doubtful dee~!, nor gusts of pra-ise ex- tinguish the burning flame of remorse. A stolen victory rn <tkes a glad defeat. Tl~e loser is winner and winnu loser when conscience I writes its score. It is best to play £air because fair play is expected. The ]e is a certain consolation, indeed a pride, in having fought a good. iight, having played true to rule. It takes away the sting of defeat, if .de- feat there be. And if victory be won, the victory is doubled. Most of the unhappiness in the world may be attributed to those who do not play £air. They have been caNed \seliish\, bttt ihat is 1 mete disguise. The dire results accure because of men too w·eak to play a real man's part; to blind to see the right; to small to do the big thing. Playing fair does not always i11.sure gain, but it 4'ces as- sure the right. HA·RDWORK It is a mistaken idea that hard work kills men. Hard wo1!k never killed a man. It is the imProper care of one's self when h.e is not working that does the damage. The more a man does with his brain the less his hands wi 11 'have to do. The better a man's reasoning, and common sense ·a 1:e,. the more successful he ·will be. It requires hard: work these claysbo 1 keep 1 up with the race. Y o11 cannot make a success unless you work hard. Success comes by inches, not by leaps 01- bounds. Success is the pushing forward each day by hard work Burn the candle at one end only and y011 replace each ·d<vJ' what you have burned, by rest, sleep, and recreation. By btuing the candle at one end only and replacing it :fully each clay, yotu candle will not burn out. -Col. W. C. Hunter.

Or if you start in newspaper work, as like as not later on you will turn to manufacturing or advertising or law. Yon don't know where opportunity or inclination will lead you. This fact has a great deal to d1 with your work at college-not so much the things you learn as the way you learn them. Don't think of education as a memory test in names and dates and definitions. That knowledge is important, but only as an incidental. Of far greater value is the habit of getting at underlying laws, the basic principles which tie facts togethe1·. The work of the pioneers in electrical experiment, at fir.ot glance confusing, is simplified once you realize that much of it hinged upon a single chemical phenomenon, the action of the voltaic cell. Analyze your problems. Look for fundamentals. Leam to connect a law or an event with what went before and what comes after. Make your education a tmining in logical thinking·. This ability to think straight, whether acquired. in Engineering or Arts, is the biggest thing you can get at college. Its aid as a means to success applies equally to whatever work you ;take up-since mental processes are HJe same everywhere. It is the power which enables a mechanic to become sales manager, a lawyer to head a great industrial organization. Develop it, if you would be ready when your big opportunity comes. 1ectric Company The executives of this Company have been chosen from all branches of the organization.

Today a goodly part of those hun- dreds are gathering here to accept the hospitality of the club which has furnished them with music for the past year. During the day there will take place the first large gathering of amateur radio op- erators, \hams\ as they are called in radio language, ever held in this part of the state. It was on October 16, 1920, that The Concordiensis carfi.ed the following headline \Union Again Pioneer of American College World; Music by Wireless Teiephone Latest Radio Feat\. The preceding Thursday night the club had succeeded in sending out its first wireless concert to stations within a 50-mile radius. Since then On J amtary 26, Dr. Charles Alex- ander Richmond will have completed his thirteenth y(lar as president of Un- ion college, and Chancellor of Union University. During the administration of Dr. Richmond, Union coHege has undergone many profound changes. It has been a transition period, that. has found the college advancing at an al- most incredi,ble pace.

The present case is all the more striking in contrast to that of a year or so ago when a small piece of the idol was taken and initials 1 were carved in the stone. At that time iec::ling- ran so high that stu- 1 dents of a neighboring institution were accused of implication in the affair and a careful investigation was made by all directly concerned The result was enlighrtening in that blame was lifted from those upon whom it had unjustly been placed. iH. 147 ]72 i68 L.' 54 90 erhe ELK LEY $9 M ETROPOLITAN . busi .. ness men hav been buying their shoes of John Watrd for these twenty-five years.

Mane : was spent in printing signs announcing the rceward. To date there has been apparently :no result. FINCHLEY i\NN~OUNCES It :has been suggested, indeed stated in su.pposedly well-founded rumors, that the person who committed tile destruction was a drunken student. Rumors from another quarter say that the deed was done by one of the city gangs, members of which are said to have remarked in a certain park, that their next activity would be to des troy the Union idol. But why the inactivity? Why the silence? Why the secrecy? The $200, now idle, would go far toward restoring the idol to its former condition. Students and college autl1orities could, if so dis posed, employ detectives to investigate. At least there could be an investigation on the part of the 600 students which would at least disclose some tracks of the guilty parties and perhaps lead to their arrest. The greatest danger lies in forgetting the outrage, and in lettin· the matter drop without further action on the part oi anyone. Re- pairs are possible and conviction of the guilty probable if definit( steps are publicly taken. \CHERISH YOUR IDEALS\ Achievement of whatever kind is the crown o{ effort, the diadem of thought.
