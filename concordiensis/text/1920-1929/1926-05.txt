Wherever mankind labors, General Electric motors can be found carrying loa<is, driving machin- ery and saving time and labor.

A series of .0-E ad v:ertisemehts showing what electricity is .doip.g in many fields will be sent on request. Ask for book- let GEK-1. CrOws In a field in sunny Spain stands a stone mortar. Crows hover around it,. picking up bits of grain and chaff-cawing. Here Marcheta, in the fresh beauty of her youth, will come to pound maize. For years she will pound maize. The stone will stand up under the blows; not a dent has the muscle of three generations of women made upon it. But the crows will hurl their black gibes upon a woman aging early and bent with toil. Old Marcheta-still in her thirties. The American woman does not pound maize. B~t she still beats carpet; she still pounds clothes; she still pumps water. She exhausts her strength in tasks which electricity can do better, and in half the time. The high ideals of a community mean little where woman is still doomed to drudgery. But the mir- acles which electricity already has performed indicate but a fraction of the vast possibilities for better living and the tremendous opportunities which the future developments in electricity will hold for the college man and woman. r· '7·7ZDH GENERAL ELECTRIC GENERAL ELECTRIC COMPANY.

Under the tutelage of Coach Hal Wittner, the nine has been developing smoothly right along and a successful season is looked for. Every member of the team is an able hitter, as was shown in t'he game with Rochester last Satarday. Three of the nine ob- ta,ined two hits apiece while five other mem1bers managed to collect one bingle each before the game ended. Practically the same lineup as was used in last week's games will take the field wi.th the possible substitution of Gri.bbon for Hawkes, at the second corner post. Each one played one ga~e last week and each played a bang u·p game. Makofski and Maybe will do the twirling with. Stubhs and Williams as relief men. Professor Larrabee To Give New Course The Department of Philosophy, in co-operation with the Department of History and Political Science, has chosen as the topic for next year in Philosophy 6, the Seminary course, \Philosop'hy of the State.\ T.his -course w-ill be an ele·ctive for juniors and se- niors in the A.B. courses under condi- tions slightly different from those an- nounced in the catalogue. Any men who have passed Politkal Science 1 and either Philosophy 1 or 2 may elect the course, regardless of whether they have passed or are .taking other courses in Phi1osophy.

Into the making of this one cigarette goes all of the ability of the world's largest organization of expert tobacco men. Nothing is too good for Camels. The choicest Turkish and Domestic tobaccos. The most skilful blending. The most scientific package. No other cigarette made is like Camels. No better cigarette .can be made. Camels are the oYer• :JVhelming choice of e:cperienced smokers. co 1926 WHEN famed men re- turn. And by dancing firelight they relate their stories of old - harve tJ Camel! For Camel helps all men who rise proudly to rise higher and more jauntily. Camels never h~rm or tire yoqr t:t~te, no matter how plentifully you smoke them. You'll never find more friendly flavor than you get in Camels. So this night when those from long ago re- turn to think of the roads that join. As you see in their past your future 11nfold, then zest- fully taste the smoke that's prized by the world's experienced. Ha'lle a CtJmel!

But further, the 'life under .. writer is one who must con .. vince those clients of the benefits offered. This means stimulating contact with hu, man character, and with large affairs. Some underwriters prefer the game of character and deal. mainly with indi- viduals. Others prefer affairs; to them is open the great field of business insurance. Furthermore, the business of life underwriting pays highly· for initiative and ability. And still more, the life under, writer offers ta his client a commodity which has no risk in it, does not deteriorate, and adds no burden of mental worry. The life underwriter sells absolute security, the foundation of serenity of mind.

In two ofour most important indus- tries there have been recent develop- ments which may be truthfully said to have ushered in a new epoch. The dial telephone system, after years of experi- ment, has proved itself a practical and efficient servant of man. And the Otis Signal Control Elevator, also a product of untiriag effort and experiment, marks a revolutionary step forward. The tran.sportation system ofa modern building requires fewer elevators of this new type, than were heretofore required Ollio Bell Telephone Compan-y, Cleveland, ·Ohio_ Hubbell & Benes Co., · Architects Pacific Telephone & Telegraph Company • San Francisco, Cal. J. R. Miller, T. L. PfLueger & A. A. Cantin, A;sociate .Architects of other types. Control is entirely auto- matic, tbe car being operated by the pressing: of car or hall button. This type of control automatically brin.gs tlle elevator to a stop within an exactness of level which eliminates the delays.ofreadjustment experienced under the old system, and also automatkally opens tbe doors as the car stops. This accura.cr of landing greatly eliminates the possibility of accident. In -view of these epoch-making de- velopments in the telephone and ele- vator ,iadustries, it is most app1'opriate that the four new momunental telephone buildings stretching across the country, and lacated in New York, Cleveland, St. Louis and San Francisco, should be equip_ped with the latest type of Otis Signal Control Elevators. 0 T l S ELEVATOR COMPANY Offices in all Principal Cities of the World.
