Highly esteemed though he was, few of us fully appre- ciate the full significance and scope of his work among us, · and only time can tell how keenly the loss of .such a chai'- acter will be felt. His was a generous spirit, and he prac- · ticed his generosity in the quiet unostentatious manner that was characteristic of all that he did. Those who sougb.t hi3 advice found i:n him a Coll1prehendi:Qg heart, a sound j udg- . ment, and a never-failing. optimism. He always found time to make friends, and his· friendship was counted by all who claimed it a privilege rare and uplifting. To know him was to feel that with the .example of such a charaeter before one, life would be worth the living if only to emulate that example. A scholar, an understanding friend and adviset·, an in·· spiring optimist, and a gentleman-always a gentleman- such was Howard Op~y;ke. The world has been made better by his presenee for atl.w.ho felt the glow of that divine fire that burned within b.ini.. The loss of such a character brings to those who knew it, i sorrow difficult of expression. R. I. :B. For the Student Body of Union College. FRESHMEN We welcome you into our midst with the hope that you will at once assume ·your .duties and responsibilities as stu- dents of Union College. · ·· Your actions on the ·Campus, and meter of \My Swan Song\] Has man the right To step within her door? To quit the rainy night And break for evermore The rules ·of etiquette When he is soaking wet? May he not seek a kiss or so Beneath her roof, or must he go, Wearing a smile, a loathsome mask? I do not know; I merely ask Why must he carry on The pretense old and wan? Will he be dubbed a jade If he, much-soaked and chili, Deprived of every bill, Decides he be repaid? Do they commit the gravest sin Who enter ere she says \come in,\ Who in the rain refuse to bask ? I do not know ; I merely ask. M.A. D. And the incentive for this outburst is yet a secret. That most august assembly, the student body, after. weighty consideration has nominated its candidates for Ter- race Council and the various class offices. The politically adept have .and are bartering friendship for ballots and bal- lots for friendship. Whispering campaigns are approaching pandemonium. Some factions are dealing poker hands with :pinochle decks while others play the pa1•ts of chamelens ... all to what end? In, a week or so there will be the bright faces that betoken \victory\ and perhaps a few squawks by disappointed competitors. A select few will gain the honor of having theil· enlarged pictures in the Garnet at the cost pe1·haps of a mere friend or two.

The Moving-Up Day e:xercises and the class nominations, m particular; have lost their sig-nificance under the new regime. With the passing of these events as milestones of the coHege year, Union has lost much of that wealth of campus tradi- tion and schoo] .spirit, which 133 successive student bodies have willed their alma mater.

The varsity proved to be powerful both in thE' line and· backfield. The new sopho- more qui.t.rterback, Jimmy Sheridan, and Hank Kumpf looked best in g·round gaining ability. Coach Crowley'sfirst team line-uP yeaterday was, Davenport and Hill, ends; Bleeker and T'ys, tackles; Captain Adler and Ashman, guards; Gatp;pbell, centre; Sheridan, quar- terback; Kumpf and Scott, half- backs; and Stanczyk, fullback, -------0------- the campus. The committee was ap- pointed at the closing session of the board last year when the pro- posal to have a hockey rink on the campus was discussed and the issue of whether or not to continue the sport on the campus if no rink is bunt, The need of a hocl~ey rink on the campus has been a mooted question for several years among Union stu- dents and at Athletic ·board meet- ings. Manager Van Hoesen declared last night, ·when interviewed, that the plans he has under consideration call for an outlay of about $300 for the construction of a hockey rink on the campus, probably ori the Nott street field. He further intimated that the rink wol.lld soon pay for itself, as it would have the patronage of the many fans of hockey that reside in the city and surrounding1 districts. The reason for the poor a.tten(lance at the horne games in the past by un• in the sp·ort is attributed to the dergraduates and others interested poor accommodations for them at the rinlJ:: in Central Park. that 'has been used by the Union sextet. -~--o·----- Two Cups to Houses With Most Men in Spring Sports ~umor Coach Clifford Is Not to Return, Untraced ~---01------ Prominent Athletic Figures on T.

But no .organizatoin of the fraternities has yet been effected for the purpose of playing this game officially as an intramural sport. · In response to a request made by The Concordie·nsis, Director Bruce has agreed to recognize the sport in his intramural program, offer the winner a silver loving cup suitably engraved and also to · provide the foo.tball for the games. As no uniforms are necessary to play the game, ~11 the fraternities can participate. The offer of Director Bruce holds g'ood if at least eight fraternities enter teams in the league. This munber of teams ought easily be reached shortly. Expr.~ssions of opinion on this subject by the Student body and others interested will be welcomed by this department. It is our opinion that touch-football would rottnd out the year in intrammal athletics as we already have a full winter and st:>ring schedule but comparatively little in the fall schedule. The game can be played on any vacant lot, and the Library and, the N ott street fields ate available. * * * * Are·_ your FeeG Collegiate Coats and Topcoats When in Albany stop in and see our suits and topcoats in original models.

SEPTEMBER 25. 1928 P~OFESSOR HOWARD OPDYKE 1872-1928 For the first time in many years the Faculty reassembles without Professor -Howard Opdyke. It was a most painful surprise to us, a few days after having seen him as usual at the ceremonies of Commencement, to learn that he had been suddenly stricken by heart disease. Professor Opdyke was in point of service the oldest member of the Faculty. He came to Union in 1895, shortly after graduation, and devoted the energies of a lifetime to the service of the College. He was at first instructor iu Mathematics, annd then Professor of Physics and 1\llechanics, but though a man of acc1;1rate scholarship his main interest in the college was in the students as men, and it is as a personal friend that he will at first be remEJmbered by the many Alumni who hear of his death. He interested himself especially in athletics, and for many years devoted himself to creating and maintaining a fine ideal of sportsmanship in the College. . But he was .also most helpful in other student activities such as dramatic.s and publications. During thC:l Great War he gave time annd .energy to organizing the students for national defence, and to maintaining relations with the Commandant of the Reserve Officers Training Corps. In all the activities in which he was engaged he was most noted for his scrupulous sense of honor and of justic<>. With the strongest sense of right and wrong he was yet the most sympathetic and helpful friend, and as such will be chiefly remembered b'oth by professors and by students.

And, in class elections, qualification :EoT office can usually be defined in terms of aetivity in fraternity politics. Personality and leadeTship, roughly speaking, qualify a man for a class office. The first requisite can be judged in the man's social intercourse with his classmates ; the second, chiefly by his success in organizing. How well these qualities are recognized depend entirely upon the degree of the candi- date's initi-ative. Fraternity politics is purely an expression of personal initiative. Fraternity politics at least provides for the display and devElopment of those qualities which determine a man's fitness for office. The c~mception of fl·aternity as a college evil is usually based upon its tendency to promote clannishness. The bonds of union which join kindred spirits are such as involuntarily to discourage the cultivation of lasting f1·iendship between member-s ()f different fraternities. Were this feeling al- lowed full rein the American .college would be composed of .a' number of units, each assuming a social superiority over and ignoring th.e merits of all others. This feeling would, un- checked, destroy the college as a social institution.

Fraternity politics is essential to the unity and mutual understanding of the groups, clubs, and fraternities which constitute the student body of the modern college. The practice, it is true, admits of unfairness and partiality when pe:t·mitted to affect relations the outcome of which competi- tive effort is supposed to dictate. In its restricted scope, however, fraternity politics not only affords opportunity for the development of the executive qualities in the college man, but it also to a large extent modifies those disintegrating ten- dencies which the college cynic alleges in the fraternity Eleven Otis Street Boston, Mass. community. .I =:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::====~ system. In the election of a team captain, fraternity politics al- ways has been and always will be the ruling factor.

Here it is: \To the Sports Editor of The Concord.iensis: \Doesn't. it seem that the expense of a few extra dollars for a new and modern tackling dummy would be well wo•rth wl1ile, considering the fact that it is becoming the custom fm· one or. more of the frosh grid candidates each year to nearly break his neck while working out on the present ms.keshift apparatus? ''Last week Coach Wittner took his squad to the tack- ling dummy for their first session in 'taking out' and 'tackling.' In a short time three members of the squad found themselves with an arm in a sling. One suffered a broken shoulder and the other two, dislocated shoulders.' Two years ago I remember a member of· my o~ class breaking his collar bone on the same apparatus. Perhaps there were one or two last year, I don't know. \Anyone who has seen the dummy 'in action' can see where the fault lies. It is merely hung by a rope f1·om an iron bar. Consequently wl1en a man tackles it, it does not give and fall to the ground as a tackling dummy should do, but it swings up in the air. twisting the tackler up under it. Now from my experience, even in some of the' smallest high and prep schools, when a tackling dummy is used for the practice of the grid outfits, they employ the newer, (perhaps more expensive) type, which is the only safe type to use. Better not to use any at all, than to use the one in use at Union at the present time. \Why isn't something done about this? The football teams are certainly entitled to all the devices which are in use at every other college, but they do not seem to get them, and when they do, look what they get. \Another thing. The pit under the dummy, which should be dug up and kept soft in order to prevent injury, · doesn't seem to have been touched this year. It appears as if a new concrete base had been put in it instead. The jumping pits for track men seem always to be kept in A-1 shape, why not the dummy pit as well? • \The Concordiensis seems to be the best medium to reach all of those concerned or interested and that is why I have written my criticisms to it. Perhaps it will cause comment, and tear the college loose from some of its ready cash to help football. Very truly yoUl's, ELR.EW ARI., What do the reade1·s think of the condition Ehew writes about? ONE SPORT TO BE; DISCOU:R.A.GE.D Picking up trophies and souveniers is always interesting sport to the newcomer of any counh·y, city or institution. But the llractice of freshmen and sorne sophomeres to collect fratel'nity. shingles, costly signs, banners, doorbells, name-plates, tires, auto wheels and other such JH'opcrty fr.om the va:t:ious fraternity houses and college buildings is a \sport\ that should be dis- couraged by the mof;t. effective means available: undet·graduate social ostracism of the culprits. This so-called sport of the lower classes \'hich threatens the security of our society on the campus is not fah· pls.y to the victims. SEE Dl)GAN For Ca:ndles, Ice Cream, Tobaccos, 1\fagazlnes,.
