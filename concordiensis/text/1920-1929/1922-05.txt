Spriggs, '25 Issue Editor, J, Westford Cutler, '24 Tuesday, May 2, 192.2 NOT A~ ALIBI B,UT- \Villiams ran away with the track meet on Saturday. Without presenting any alibis for the team, it is possible to point ont a multi- tude of reasons for that defeat. You may lay it to the fact that track is an a11-year sport at Williams, where they have an outdoor board track, and where they hold intramural and interfraternity meets once a month, 1Jnion certainly is at a disadvantage on the score. Yon may -attribute it tu the graduation of former stars, to the coaching, to the difficulties of winning your letter in track, or to a lack of spirit on the part of the men themselves. It is hoped yon will not. But, again perhaps yon will shoulder part of the blame, as ynu certainly 1 will share in the fact of defeat. The defeat on Saturday was not a result of Saturday's perform- ances. Anvone following the progress of teh track team this spring mio-ht hav~ said, \I told you so.\ The cheering of the track team on1 Sa~ 1 nlav was excellent, but it could not supply the missing links on 1 1 that tra~k tc>am. Only when Capt~in Oram made a la.st minute plea 1 .for support in stuclent body meettng last ~[onday, chd as many as I th irtv men come out for the team. The ord1 nary track team numbers I het\\:een twr:'nt\· ancl thirty men. Figure it out for yourself. Vvitbin the past three .years there has never been :;uch a tniserahle showing j of candidates for any varsity team. It is nut because students have lacked examples of hard, grind- it1g work among the members of the track squad. The Concordiensis expresses the comnHm feeling of every sttt<ient on the campus when i it extends its congratulations to McQueen on his letter winning per-j formam·e ag-ainst the hardest opposition he \\V·ill face this year. \Mac\ has been the hardest worker on the track Sf[ uad for four weary years and clesenes all possible comtnendation for his service to the college. It is hopecl that he will not object to be used as an example of what has been disastrously rare. A tmck team can not be made in a month nor even in a sing' season. It is the product of continual and steady effort-which :fact should not be an argument against trying out for the team. It is individual sport and does not rely upon team play-which is a c1P · leng-c to individual ambition and endeavor. It does regard a greater faithfulness to training-but nothing beyond possibility. Thi:-; editorial will not help to win the ttack meet this Saturda:- against Trinity. It can do nothing beyond laying the facts beiorc the students. And that should be all that is necessary, HONOR SYSTEM ADOPTED Students at Ohio Wesleyan Univer- sity recently voted by a large majority to adopt the honor system. The ma- jority of the votes against the plan were cast by men, the women of the college voting almost u11animously tr [111t tlw ~y~trm into nprration.

The new impetus given to radio development may be definitely associated with the development of the high power vacuum tube, for that made broadcasting possible. And the power tube orjgi.nated from a piece of purely theoretical research, which haq no connection with :radio. Vvhen a scientist in the Research Laboratories of the General Electric Company found that electric current could be nwde to pass through the highest possible vacuum and could be varied according to fixed laws, he established the principle of the power tub:; and laid the foundation for the \tron\ group of devices. These devices magnify the tiny telephone currents produced by the voke a11-d supply them to the antenna, which broadcasts the messages. At the receiving end, smaller \trons\, in turn, magnify the otherwise imperceptible messages coming to them from the receiving antenna. Great accomplishments a:re not picked out of the ai:r . .Generally, as in this case, they grow from one ml?-n's insatiable desire to find out the \how\ of things. Scientific research discovers the fact~. Practical npplications follow in good time. G lectric SJ5-SO~HD any General Office ~chenectady, N.Y.

The second battle of the day was I . between the two undercla-sses. It be-' gan after the track meet about four-1 · thirty and like the previous game, I lasted by three innings. The green cap wearers tallied ten runs to the Sophs' seven. Both teams tried out several batteries in the course of the three stanzas, and frequent substitions · were made in the other positions. Glenn and Van Voast started th-ings for the seco-nd year men. After 011e inning their thrones were usurped by Pitts and Clarke. The same perform- ance took place in the ranks of the Frosb when Barnes and Feuer retired in favor of Ely and Bacchus. The Sophomores met the Seniors Monday and succeded in making short work of them by piling up a large ·s·core in three innings. The next game of the series will be played between the Seniors and the Frosh tomorrow night at 7:00 'P. M\.

We have become accustomed to hearing a consta·nt criticism of ·the modern g·irl, i.e. the flapper. The criticism is to say the least un- kind and in intent destructive rather than constructive_ We wonder , how much of it is based on actual fact irom first hancl findings. Are the writers of these articles fair-minded youths,-. perhaps mature \ men ·tolerant uf the whims of woman's fancy, or are they crabbed old i age, chronic knockers, and admitted misogynists? It requires no great psychologist to tell us that the best way to make a woman do any certain thing ts to cavail against it,-especi- ally in matters which are no one's business or concern :but the doer's. If you want a girl to shorten her skirts, tell her to lengthen them. : If yon don't want her to smoke or drink, try to insist on abstenious- ness with a paternalistic air-and m five minutes she will be around:; the corner with your best friend. ' Do you men imagine that the girl of 1922 is the first who was/ ever kissed before her engagement. If so, you belong to the An-/1 dent Order of Fatheads. The great difference between the modern girl and her grandmother is that the grandmother wor·e hoop skirts I which were always very much in the way.

GARNET RUNNERS lO OPPOSE ROCHESTER AFTER RESI PERIOD About 20 Men to Journey to Kodak City- Victory Over Trinity Makes Locals Hopeful for Win After. two weeks recess, the Union tracksters leave Thursda:y for Roches- ter, where they meet the University of Rochester the following d.ay. The team will be enter1:ained. in campus fra- ternity houses at the University during the trip. Relying on a well-balanced team to bring home a victory, Coach B. R. Murphy will take about 20 men to the Kodak City. Close followers of the sport expect Union to romp !tome with a win by a comfortable margin. Two weeks ago Hamilton defeated Roches- ter by a score of 90 to 45. Comparing the marks set in this 1net with those of the Union-Trinity meet, the local team may lool( for a first, in the 220, quarter, half, two rrilie, both hurdles, shot put, broad jump, atld :high jump, ·in addition to a good number of sec- ond and third places. Rochester ad- herents are pinning thei.r hopes on Dunn and Remington, both of whom have been prominent in Rochester's meets this year.

Last year Sche11ectady high school ran away with the team laurels with a grand total of 51 1-4 points, with Glens FaHs placing a poor second with 14 1-3. All the eleven other teams competing scored less than 1{) points each. At that time Schenectady .scored six first places but the men who won those places have all graduated from the local school, ex- cept Soellner and Hunt.

Four out o.f five sc·heduled debates were won by the Union teams, and in addition there were conducted here during the year the interclass and interclub contests. From the senior class the debating teams drew the leaders in the work- Horning, Blessing, Cohen, and Chase. Men in the underclasses experienced in debating during their preparatory school career, were also of the greatest assistance, according to the men in charge of the work. The formation of Tau Kappa Alp:ha, honorary forensic fraternity, last year, has also been of material assistance in furthering debat- ing at Union. The first event on the debating pro- gram was the annual Allison-Foote contest between the Philomathean and Adelphic societies on November 22. The representatives of the Philo.ma- theans were: J. Cyril Collins, '22; Ralph K. Chase, '22; and David Lieber- man, '22; with B. K. MacLaury, '23, as alternate; of the Adelphics: Timothy F. Cohan, '22; Leon Brown, '25; and Thomas Weiss, '25, with Kenneth Saunders, '24, as alternate. The ques- tion was: \Resolved that the principle of municipal ownership should be ap- plied to the transit system of New York City.\ The Adelphics won the contest and one of their members, Timothy Cohan, captured the individual prize. The next lap in the debating course brought the dual contest between Un- ion and St. Lawrence in which the Garnet representatives won the distinc- : tion of proving both sides of the same question discussed by the Allison-Foote battlers The Union affirmative team consisted of T.

Today Union college aga!in extends its greeting to the high school athletes of eastern New York. 136 of the fastest and strongest track men of this section are our guests and we are prond to receive them. Union enjoys a unique honor to be aUowed to stage the annual mterscholastic track meet for the E. N. Y. P. H. S. A. L. Further, Union enjoys a unique opportunity to be a good host to men of real stamina and ability. A good runner is a goc;>d sport atLd · a gentleman-he is of necessity a man of fight. He respects abi-1Hy in his neighbor-he is a hard worker. We need that type to carry on_ , the traditions of old Union. Union .men have today an opportunity to show these guests how fine a college Union is. A general invita- tion has ben issued to all the athletes-it is not enough. Th·at invita- tion should he seconded .by your personal attention and endeavor. Union has always prided itself on its athletic traditions and clean, hard-fighting sportsmans 1 htip.
