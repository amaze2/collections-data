A hazy notion ~xists that varsity men are in- eligible, but no one, apparently, knows just It might be interesting in t11is day of constant •· protest against regulations perseribed by th.e • faculty of Union College, to gliance casually at those rdes ;under which our ''old alumni\ weJ,~c i. forced to abide.' The following are but a few o£ :. ·. trhe ordinances enforced at Union College in the ' year of Om: l,m·d, 1802. , \If any student shall smoke a pipe Qr sega1.·, in any part ·of th.e college except in his own. , room, be shaH for every\ ofl'en:se be fined twelve • · cents\ .. \No student shall atten.€1. on-armmg other amlitsemel'l.ts-those .incidental 1to the fourth of , July, and other parade days a~d ho:ly days. · .

Picture some ardent upperclassman on a c;'double date\ with • Tom Gould. · And those who pan the literary efforts • of our present .publications should read some of • the early numbers of the Union College Maga.- zme. The poetry in particular should be no· , ticed. We take the liberty of quoting a verse ; or two from a poem entitled \The Belle of i Dorp\ and published in the November issue of ! the magazine. In all fairness we must admit that :tll'e editor realized that it was pretty bad. \Her eyes the twinkling stars surpass, .

: l _Pttge Four THE CONCORD:EENSIS, TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 5, 1929 8y Ira G. Werle JVhat a Game! Despite the fact that we were waylaid by the mud on the · · side of some un-named mountai·n in the general vicinity of Wiil~ liamst<'lwn .Saturday aften10on, '\'\\C finally managed to reach Weste>n Field and see pa.rt of the most glorio1:1s footbal:l game we ha~e had the pr,ivilege t~ witness around these parts. p}:ay- ing \\i\TiHiams to a standstill this year is no little feat. hut out- playing them sixteen first down to six while the line mowed down the Purple forward wall and the Garnet backs tere through o·n play .after play, was too much for even a I'epoi'ter,. and conse- queHJtly we are still hoarse and sor-e-thr0ated. Fi:uegan and Nitchman engraved their names on Wes•to·n Field ]orever. It wasn't long befote queries flew back and forth through the Williams .stands, about \nu:m:ber one\ and \number four\. And yet every ma·n was a star Saturday. It would hardly be fai1· to single any linesman out, because all of them baUle-.d and tugged their way through every piay, to stardmn.

Made. to fit, $2;500 up Phone 6414 On the other hand the Williams backs, the same men who have been tearing through all opposition this season were held almost at a standstilL It rested on the shoulders of Tuttle with his 202 pounds of beef to uphold the glory of a baflted Purple · backfield, by a 65 yard 1·un to a :touchdown in ·the second quarter.··~===========~ It was one time during the game that Williams was better than· Union. Rochester Tied Sprin,gfield It might be weH to mention in passing that Rochester will not h<! •easy Saturday. The Yellow ,Jackets held Springfield to a tie Saturday. Springfield tied Brown earlier in the season,. and Brown isn't the worst team in the east this year. Rochester also beat Renssela·er 13 to 0 a couple of weeks ago. Then again, • comparing scores is a fruitless bminess at best. Suffice ·to say that lt.ochester has a football team which has lost only one game this .s cason. Fas·t Steppm' 'J'he Ga1·nct cross-country Yictory S~turday against Dick- inson came as mo1·e or less of a surprise .. The Eastern Confer- ence champions admittedly had a strong outfit and were con- cede([ -to have the better chance to win against the some,vhat crippled Union tea.m, L(le Heath ran as fine a race as we ever hope to see run. That whirlwind start of his was nobody's business, and tl1e funny part o:f it was that he kept it up for six gr.ueling miles. When a man can cover a six mile course in recoTd-breaking time without an opposing runner to push him within four hundred yMds dur- ing th€ entire race, that man is a cracK runner. All we say is wait until Heath gets pushed a little in the :Middle Atlantics or the Ini:et'collegiates! PAT,ON & HALL Will Give You a Good Fit.

Union might just as well have lost the Tace Saturday :even . with Hedh pulling in first, especially since Captain Rothmann ------~-------! WE SOUCIT YOlJR l'A'l'RONAG-E didn't finish. But O'Connor covered the couTSe in the best time e-ve1· for him, and showed his rather diminutive heels to the seasoned Dickinson runner.s. Maybe, as old Si used to say, \You ain't seen nuthin' yet\· And we hope A us sicker feels the same way about it ! What~s In a Fumble? Wl1en a man plays a good game of football for about three and a half quarters, a·nd then Fale decides to let him make a fumbl-<!, there's no reason why that should be held against him. Any r:nan is liable to get a rotten break, especially on a foetball field::~ :and we ought to sort of forget about it and agree that the Fates must have their due. Tom Finegan played a fine game Saturday against Oswego Not·ma] and was a powerful factor i11. the frosh offense. Time and again he made long gains, and as often helped stop the Teachers' ad,.tance. But then, as luck would have it, he dropped the ball on his o\vn ten yard line late in the final quarter, with an Os:wego man Tecovering. That break .gave Oswego the chance to score· and ·thereby win the game. ..All of which goes to prove that a little fumble shouldn't metL1l too much in this wo1·ld of chance, even in a football game. \JACKS\ RESTAURANT 450 STATE STREET Daily Luncheon. 60c Daily and Sunday Dinner $1 A LA CARTE AT ALL TIMES FRANK H.

Page Six THE CONCOBIHENSIS, FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 8, 1929 Work to Start Soon On New Laboratory Ryder Hall to Have High Poten· tial, Radio Laboratories; Ma- chine Shop Included \-\'ork will soon start on Ryder hall, the new rlcclrical engineer- ing· laboratory, according to an an- nouncement by Dr. Charles B. Mc- ~1tp-ray, trustee of the colleg·c. The building which is the gift of H. Russell Ryder, New Vork hanker, will cost about $150,000. \I r. Ryder has also provided a generous fund for the milintenance of the building and the college \vill install the most modern rkctrical laboratory aparatus available whl·n the build- ing is compktC'd durin~ the spring of 1930. • The laboratory spacr in the new building will be pmctically twice as great as that of the prcsrnt lab- oratory, which has only two stu- dent class rooms, sea tinp; f arty in each, and no formal resC'arch rooms. In Ryder Hall will he three student class rooms, of vary- ing sizes with a total r;tpacity for 200 students, together with thn:r research rooms for p;r:-ulnatr stu- dents. Has Radio Laboratory In planning the new lmilcling-, Dr. Ernst ]. Berg, head of th<' electri- cal engineering departmc·nt and con- snlting engineer of the (~enrral Electric Company, has in mind the addition in the ncar f ut urc of a high voltage laboratory which will per- mit expcrimrnts at r,ooo,ooo volts or more. Ryder Hall, however, will han a high potential labora- tory permitting· experiments np to 2oo,ooo volts. ,\ well equipped radio laboratory in the ll<\v\' build- ing will enlarge the scope of the present electrical engineering d<'- partment and is expected to at- tract many students to tlte college.

Comprehensive Examination Another essential feature of the plan is the so-called. comprehensive examination for honors men which·· will occur at the end of the seni'or · year. It will cover the subject in. which ·the student is a candidate · for honors, paying spec~al attention ·. to his particular work. It will be . both written and oral, the oral part being conducted by .a committee· selected by the department, .and in-. eluding at least one repres-entative· of a r-elated department. It will re- place the regular examinations of the candidate in the department· concerned. · Honors men who pass with dis- tinction. both the comprehensive examination and their honors work· will be recommended to the fac~ · ulty for honors at graduation in the department concerned. The plan replaces the old scheme at · awarding special honors at gradu- ation, but in no way affects the award of scholarly honors now in operation. Honors courses are a step in the direction of the methods of in- struction for superior students which have long been practiced in the Engli_sh universities, and have been adapted for use in America ·by such institutions as Harvard, Columbia, Swartlunore, Williams, Smith, Barnard, and Bates. The Union honors plan is an adaptation of these methods to the l9cal situation, and will undoubt- edly develop slowly. through the eHorts c:if interested faculty mem- bers and of st.).ldents who desire such intensive instruction. Its suc- cess will depend very largely upon the intellectual enthusiasm latent in the student body, which may be aroused by the opportunities of- fered, leading to increased de- mands for sucl1 instruction.
