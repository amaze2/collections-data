What Is Va.cuum? I F THE traffic policeman did not hold up his ha:md and control the automobiles and wagons and people there w10uld be collisions, confusion, and but 1i ttle progress in any direction. His business is to direct. The physicist who tries to obtain a vacuum that is nearly perfect bas a problem somewhat like that of the traffic .policeman. Air is composed of molecules-billions and billions of thetn flying about in all directions and often colliding. The physicist's pll.ltl,p is designed to make the molecules travel in one direction-·-otLt through the exhaust. The molecules are much too small to :b~ seen even with a microscope 1 but the pump jogs them, along and at least starts them in the right direction. A perfec~ vacuum would be one in which thel\e: is not a single free molecule. For over forty years scientists have been tryimg; to pump and jog and herd more molecules out of vessels. There are s.till in the best vacuum obtainable more molecules per cubic centimeter than there are people in the world, in other words, about two billion. Whenever a new jogging device is invented, it becomes vos;sible to eject a few million more r;:.olecules, The Research Laboratories of the General Ele«Jtric Company have spent years in trying to drive more and more 11ll.o1ecules of air' from containers. The chief purpose has been to study the effects obtained, as, for example, the boiling away of metals in a vacuum. This investigation of high vacua had une::xpected results. It beca:ne possible to make ~etter X - ray tubes ...,.., better because the X- rays could be controlled; to make the e1ectrol'l. tubes now so essen- tial in long-r:;:tn~7 wireless communication mote efficient an..J trust~ worthy; and to develop an entirely new type of incandescent lamp, q~e. which is filled with ~ ~as and whjoh gives ruGre light than any of tbe·older lamps. No one can foretell what w;iH be th~ eutcome of :research in pure science. New 1 knowledge, new ideas inevitabf:Y are gained..

Richmond will de- liver the third lecture in his series o£ addresses to .the J.unior and Senior classes, Monday, January 17, 1921 at eleven o'clock in the Chapel. His topic wil be \Liber:ty Under Law.\ The Masonic Club of Union College held a meeting in Silliman Hall on Tuesday night. After a short business meeting, Mr. S. S. Foster gave on in- teresting talk on the history and or- ganization of the Grand Lodge. Mr. Foster is president of the Masonic Club of Schenectady. This lecture was one of a series, being contemplat- ed by the club, and much credit is due. the local lodges, which have shown Edmund S. Tilly is Text·Book Author There has recently come from the press of the Mac Milla11 Company a book entitled \Aid to French Pronun- ciation,\ of which Mr. Edmund S. Tilly, instructor of modern languages AT N. Y. U. GAME in Union College, is the author. The aim of the book it to help students of French to acquire a more accurate pro- nunciation, and the book is to be used as an auxiliary in French courses in schools and colleges. Mr. Tilly feels that the large number .of excellent books on French pronunciation already in existence meet the needs of advanc- ed' students only, while that part .of French gtammars which deals with pronunciation is entirely inadequate. He has, therefore, published this work to meet the needs of those students of French for whom the usual gram- mars do not provide sufficient instruc- tion, and to those students who have not progressed fat- enough to be helped by the studies of _the tl:eories of French pronunciation. The band musrc will be dispensed with, at tonight's game but it is hoped that ottr boys will keep the N. Y. U. quintet stepping to the tune of a speedy game. The musical clubs were unable to obtain an engagement at Skidmore for anyother night and so .they are to appear before the girls tonight. In order that some of the best musicians mignt be in the ranks of the Glee Club and Mandoline club it is neces- sary for most of the• bandmen to go wi-th them. In the fore part of the book, a des- cription is given of the organs ·Of sp.eech accompanied by drawings, and there is a discussion of the functions of the various organs. A French sound chart is given with explanations, and French and English sounds are compared. A detailed description of all French sounds is accompanied by exercises. for oral practice, and there are directions for the use of French sounds in connected speech. ===~===========~ This conflict in the schedule of the musical clubs and the basketball team The last part of the book g\ves phonetic transcriptio·ns ·Of selections from different authors in order to pro- Schenectady.

The question of what shall be done with these backward sonl:o absolutely lost in a labyrinth of in.£initive, particip]e and tense when they are put in a class endeavoring to learn a foreign language. In evety class that is beginning to study another tongue, there are al- most :forty per cent who will never be able to grasp what it all is about. These not only retard the progress of tl:e other students with the greater natural ability along the lines of mastering a langu- age, but cause the appearance of many a line in the instructor's face. Those men who are unable to master grammar will never learn to understand or appreciate a language and this fact is known by all after a few weeks of class work. They are merely wasting their own time as well as the time o£ the rest of the students by being COl.t\\\ pellccl to continue with the course. We can point out cases of stu- dents who spent three or four hours a day studying the principles o:f French or Spanish grammar and then received averages below pass- • ing. These same students had good averages in their other subjects but because of their deficiencies in languages-which were owing to no fault o:C their own-they were unable to compete on athlethic ' enormous, especially the fuooks issued Found in College ALLING RUBBER COMPANY by correspondence schools.
