'l'UESDAY, FEBHUAR'\\ <1-4, 1928 Union College has always -taken a grea·t pride in the fact that its athletic teams, successful as th cy lwve been, have been composed of men who have maintained satisfactory scholastic averag-es and who have oftEn held bet.te1· 'rec- ords thnn the less active stu.dents. There have, however, always been an unbelieving few who have rathe1· doubted that the athletes were not ol'tt!ll grossly favored in theh· sclwlastic stand- ings because of work OH th<e c01lege teams. It is hard fOl' one student to view the efforts of another in the same way the administration does, and it is therefore ha·rd for students to avoid the impression that -there is a definite favoritism shown towards the athletes. But the losses which several of the str0ng squads suf- fered as a result of last semester's scholarship report should convince even the most skeptical that Union team memt>ers must keep foremost the idea that they are herE prima-rily for an education and not for lHOfessional athletics. It is a great disappointment to the student body to see the strength of the te~ms cut down as it has been this midyears by failmes in cturicular \\.·ork, but at least no undergraduate can any longer entertain the idea th~t ~he is discrimin- ated against IJecause he does not participate in coilege athletics. And probably the reputation of the college will in the ·end be infinitely bene- fited by the fact that our athletics are main- tained as extra-curricular activities and not as the sole end of the college course. * * * * In a report published in 1'he Concordiensis . hortly lv•fore Christmas it was announced that more and more Union students werE €arning part or all of their way througl1 colleg-E. This trend is laudable, and doubtless the work is often beneficial in developillg the undelgrad- uate, out it should not be thought that the end justifies the means. When some students have to provide their own 1·efreshment by picking- up what they can from the 0pen candy counter in the College Union, and othn• rnembeTs of the f;tudent body find it necessaiY 1 to make away with articles of clothing left in the corridors, so that even professors no longer find it safe to leave coats hanging outsid-€ their rdooTs, it is time that those interested in suppor.ting them- selves find a more honoral>le way of doing so. * * * * The famous \huddle system\ has certainly set up a very important :place fer itself in foot- ball annals. The system has withstood much ridicule and is undoubtedly a .good one fi:n some purposes. ·But of what bene:tlt it can possibly be in the shower room .of a colleg-e g-ymnasium, and why it is that most of the:showers al'e ke_pt either too cold, too hot, or W·ithout any water at all so that all who wish to wash a1·e fo11ced THE CONCORDIENSIS, 'TUESDAY, FEB~U.~RY .H; .1928 --~----~--- ~---· ----~ ------ -~-------~ ~Th~ Glee ~luh pla..:cd third in lhl' 1 Ostendorf Announces ------- ------------------------ -·- -------~--- -- - -- : Championship held bsl Satunla_, · Ina · iiU;net It.tl:ngs. a· . night at H..oclTest.er, 'fhis WOUHl 110L rGodshall To Teach [ n ·western Un.ive;rsity .. :: §==·: •• ; ___ ===Le· ... _·t·· TJ,.t·.

Whether this is a reflection on the prospects for neAt year is a matter that ·has not as· yet been decided. A more definite answer to this quandary will probably be possible after exams in June.

To date no one on that football team has been reported ineligible, and the scholastic average, o.f 1 the college is not faHing on its account. In fact ,the team seems to have very little support, something7 not to be marveled at. Perhaps the atmosphere isn't right, which may account .for that lack of ·support. The atmosphere is distinctive to say the least. It has been stated that the atmosphere or, if you prefer, the .air -was changed once, but our acquaintance only goes back four years, and we've never been able to .find any com- petent authority to vouch for .the rumor. Perhaps the windows are nailed down. Anyway that distinctive odor isn't Coty's. * * * * Mid-year exams marked the thir.d anniversary of the death of the honor system at Union, for at the mid-year exams in January and February, 1925, the honor system met its fate and at the inquest held by the faculty it was ruled that the good old days wcrc gone forever. The gentle art of cribbing has advanced, made progress, since that memorable date, but so also has ~he fine art of proctoring. Crib notes on blottet·s, e:ven blotters that have a cover, are a cltildish form. The two exam book gag doesn't Wot'k, tl1e carved pencil,. the slide rule, calling cards, are all passe. Btrt some couldn't believe that the faculty had progt·essed as rapidly in the history of cribbing a~ the students had in the applied science of cribbing. They leaTncd. ' And :it costs $so to repeat a course even if you get the chance. Its a poor gamble at best.

Jr. FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 17, 1928 l\Iid-year examinations unavoidably spell disaster for a number of wayward students at Unian. This year being no exception, some thirty men in their struggle to survive with tl1e fittest of college intellectuals found themselves sifted out; · their association with the institution abruptly ter- minated. Upon 1·elaxation and reflection after the strain of mid-year tests, we are wont to analyze tl1e results and their causes. Hastily we assume that these who had to sever relations with the col- lege did so because of inferiot• mental capacities. Our ,iudgment in this instance undoubtedly holds true in a number of cases, yet we cannot, at the outset, take for granted that this is the only cause which results in severence. Equally important as a cause is the lack of character of which will power is a major attribute. Will power, embrac- ing as it does self control and application becomes for the student a. most effective factor in creditable scholastic achievement. Bulwer Lytton puts it thus: \What men want is not talent, it is purpose; not wholly the power to achieve, but the will to labor.\ The student must realize the necessity of com- bining both the ingredients of study and pleasure. Either one of them, unalloyed, is apt to produce an aversion to that particular activity in the course of time. Incessant activity, along one line, l<'a.ds finally to complete dissipation of one~s powers. Those freshmen entering Union, aware of the practicability of combining the proper amount of eacl1 have invariably found their course and career a.t college most pleasant and profitable. Unfor- tunately, there are a certain number who come merely to make their stay here one of social con- tacts and pleasures. It is evident that among these, frequently there are men of high mental calibre; men who, if they were convinced of the uselessness ef their procedure could easily remedy their ways. Unless these men can learn to budget their time to allow for a certain minimum con- sumption of midnight oil as well as for numerous other nightly diversions, they will soon find them- selves without the mental assets to put themselves thr.ough college. If we were to undertake to question a number of students upon the completion of their four year course as to what they attribute their success, ·it is safe to assume that most of them would give ·, TJ.'f:E' ·CONCOR\DIENSIS FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 17, 1928 l~:=. :::::::::::=:::::::=::::::=====:::;:::;il = = What They·· 're Do_:irtg_. == ~= ~ § =:::::::::::::::::::::::~:::::::::::::;51[ ·, M,id-years toQk their toll this past semeste-r amqn;g'. ~ ... .t the a.thlctcs, leaving Hmliy teams in a yery <di\lapidat~(ili ! !..q-.~ i:Gndition.

In the final analysis, it is not 'II. ques- tion of class room intellig~nce or text book knowl- edge that brings a student to the final rung of the scholastic ladde~ but it is that supreme <]).lality, character, which in its ability to make use of in• telled prepares ~veryone for that goal whie:h has ever been the product of his visualization. -B.B.N. ;Hmm;:m::!um::mmm:mm:mm::mm::m:::::m:::mm::mm:::m::m:::m::m::mfii FACTS FACTS Students of Union College Spend $4$5,000.00 a year in the .

Mauge1· 'l.'UESDA V, FERRUAHY 21. 1928 There has been a little agitation in some select circles fot· a campaign to increase the medical fa- cilities of the college. One salient factor is the principai at·gument in favor of such a campaign. It is a seemingly contagious new disease which is certainly prevalent on the campus and about which nothing can be done because of the present inad- equacies of the medical department. The symp- toms of this new and curious affliction may be summarized by three points, briefly as follows: f'irst, extreme reluctance in opening the mouth at the proper time; second, pronounced lack of lungular pressure; and third, an unwieldly half- silence which is due in all probablitity to a lack of vocal apparatus. A simpler statement of the same idea is that the cheers are rotten ; the direction mediocre and the response disgraceful. Nothing is so discour- aging to a cheer leader as the open and loud voiced ridicule of his team mates, for the cheering section, as the student bl~achers are humorously labeled on the gym seating chart, is just as much an aggregation representing Union as the basketball or track squads. A glaring example of this non- support was manifest during the recent Frosh game with Schenectady. Ung~ntlemanly students, of whicl1 there seemed to be a majority, were not only pleased to refrain from participating in the chre1•s but rather se~med to delight in formulating wise Narks for the pleasure of their boon com- rades ancl the disgust of a minority. Recent ap- pearances of the band have been treated in much the same way. During the R. P. I. game an en- t hus.iastic rooter composed, led and recited his own cheen;, A laudable action, perhaps, but the striking detail connected with this fact was the distinctness with which he could be heard when his cheers Jut ppened ·to conflict with the organized Union section. The full blame should not, however, be placed on the cheering section as the cheer leaders could Pasily improve in coherence and smoothness by means of a few practice sessions. They might even practice a little at student J;lody meetings where there is no foreign audience to notice any blunders. There is no reason why cooperation and coordin- ation might not result from such a method of pro~ cedure. Within a short space it is entireiy pos- sible that a heartening influence might be exerted on the members of the various teams and those of the students, faculty and alumni body who are working toward the expansion and betterment of the college. 'The old maxim, \Silence IS golden,\ should have a \not\ properly placed m it as a cure· for this speciBtl case. -E.S.B. TilE CONCORDIENS:tS, 1i'UESDAY, FEBRUARY 21, 1928 . - ~ ' ~-~=- ~et The Grecian Dreami ~ :.- = = - = = The latest stage in the development of Uniott Col~ lege 'Student meetings, is .ap.proaching accot•ding to tumor. The s:tory goes that ·Chapel five days a week and twice on Sundays .is not enough, so preparation is being made to t<Vke attendance at student meetings, I:n Yiew ·Of the numbrt' now attending that would' not b(' a stHpcndous task, but we arc wondering wlie~e nca.rly eight hundrrd students and a few ch;~pcl mar-kers ar.c g•oing <to be placcq in the old chapel. The Fres:hmcn now outntunbe.r th•e three ot,hcr cla·sses in .attcndancr, but e\'en at that the numbcF of freshmen present is smaU. Student meetings have certainly changed .in the past four .}'('a·rs. Under the less rigorous regime of chapel attrndann brfere the new edifice .gracrd the campus, nearly C'vcryone went to student meeting as a mat.ter 0f course. Now that wr arc so ~thoroughly chapelized, .fC'w ge to stm!C'nt meeting, also as a .matter of course. TlJC• chrer leaders seem to be suffering from a com- bination of bronchitis and paralysis (who said inf.anc. tile?) for cheers a·re omi.tted from the shtdent meetings. Team captains and managers are too ·busy to come. l'suaHy the;c is at least one member of the Terrace Coundl present, as someone has to preside at the meet- ing. Pretty soon the President of the Student ·body and the sc.cretary will be the only ones thrre. Perhaps com_ pnlsory attendance as in chapd is considered a good rcml'dy, but it serms dubious. * * After a mild winter, we wonder if tha-t annat!! ma;lady of spring fever will set in e.arly. The ground hog pre- dicted six more weeks of winter, and we thottght the cold of the whole six weeks was being crovYdcd in to Saturday night. That brit>f return of the zero mark, caused a temporary revival of lagging energy, but tbe symptoms of the fever are again appearing. Coll'egt' would be fine if we didn't have classes, and it is six or eight weeks to the nearest vacation, and stick exams come before that, and start on the propitiohs ·day of Friday the Thirteenth. But perhnps the flood of ignorance that is apJICaring in some of the freshman courses is not due to spring feyer. It may be fraternity fever, for new badges arc· ap- pearing on the campus and coats arc being worn un- buttoned. The way of the neophyte is hard, and who cares about studying initiation week anyway. * * If yon see a begrimmcd figure covered witl1 ·dust from head to foot, descend wearily from the uppN re- cesses of the library, laden with yellowed, tattered, dusty, and musty valumes in his hands, be not alarmed. The city ash collectors arc not renovating the library. It is merely a P. S. student who has been engaged in the timely .pastime of document searching. And after the document has been exhumed from its undistnrbcd repose of decades, it is likely to be written in Spanish or French or German, and sometimes Engli'sh, with little or no meaning. Perhaps someday all .these d()C'tb ments will be compiled ina book and the weary 'Pllf- suers of the evidence, can tdl their grand-children how they contributed to the volt1mc. Placc your order~ for autographed copies now. * * * The intrrfraternity council believes the Freshmen have not becn well trained this year, and in fact .for the past two or three years. We wonder what brought forth this startling conclusion. Have not the freshmen consistently maintained a discreet silence on the cam- pus? They scarcely ever speak to their own classmates, and as for up,perclassmen! Do freshmen ever miss go- ing t() student meeting? How about smoking? No, the freshmen never touch the vile reed while on the street, except for cigarettes. Perhaps the class of '3 I thinks it should be seen and not heard, but until the .quality of the scenery prcsentC'd by them increases to a re- markable extent, it would be more pleasant to '!tear them say \hello\ once in a while, than to feast our ryes on their set countenances.

His tireless efforts to please the undergraduates and the faculty were not without success. His loss will surely be felt by aU who frequented Union's common-meeting center. * * * * BETTER VAGABONDING Union is considet·ed to be a liberal college offer- ing to all students a fair chance of gaining that broad knowledge that is 1requisite fot· discrimin- ating between the good and the bacl in the 1·ealm of human exper-ience. Yet many technical and pre-professional undergraduates complain too often that only to the academic students is given the opportunity to become intimately acquainted with the best thought and deeds of all time. Aca- <lctnics, on the other hand, 1n·ofess ignorance of the physical sciences. Vagabonding-sitting in on courses without being \held\ for them-helps to equalize this un- balanced condition. Besides the undoubted pleas- ure of attending a class from choice and not for the purpose of saving a cut, it has other advan- tages. By vagabonding, a student may come into contact with subjects and professors outside his particular field. Over-specialization in the major Htudics is thus lessened by this broadening out into unrdated subjects. And underclassmen will also be able to choose their elective courses less 'blindly by obtaining a fOI'eknewledge ·of both the subjects [l)nd their professors. Although the faculty has voted the undergrad- uate the privilege of vagabonding, few of those to whom this privilege would offer the greatest ad- vantage are availing themselves of the opportun- ity. The Coneordiensis feels that perhaps it is somehow responsible for this situation by not hav- ing noted the interesting lectures in its columns to guide the undergraduates and is now seeking to perfect a plan that may prove fruitful in bring- ing to the student body .a knowledge of the various lPctures taking place each week. * * * II! Some alumni rea-lly feel that the college is degenerating: otherwise it would neve1· have flunked out prominent athletes. Perhaps they have forgotten that it is UNION COLLEGE and not the Amateur Athletic Union which is thei1· Alma Mater. * * This reminds us that some disappointed Union sport reoters want the annual alumni-varsity basketball game !'~placed by a game between the faculty and the \bust\outs.\ ba-nks are going to stage a W•inter perforn1ance .

The 11igh-school- ish razzing of basketbaH referees, the boorish atti- tude of many men in classos, the indifl:erent re- spect paid to the faculty, indicate that Union men should give much thought to their deport- ment. The most vulgar and displeasing form of ill breeding on the campus is that displayed in the .c'tapel. There is no religion which does not con- sider as sacred its places of worship and wl1ich does not wish those who enter them to be qu·iet and reverent. As a rule those who do not conform to a particular religious worship ha,·e respect .for the desires of those who do. The student body in general and the sophomores particularly must im- prove their chapel conduct hdore they may class themselves as gentlemen. * '* l* * Te\IE-CLOC'K COURSES We have no patience with tl1c horse who, upon being led to water, will not drink and afterwards is thirsty but our sympathy is aroused when the horse, going of his own volition to the water, finds it fenced beyond his reach. Putting students in place of the horse and education in the stead of .water, we have stated a condition now existing on this campus. 'Ve l1ave in our midst certain pedantic instructors possessing watehcs who lot'k the door to all tardy students. This action doubt- less brings much glee to these intellectuaf time- keepers hut we would remind them that Union is a college, not a factory; that students sometimes have valid reasons {among them, being kept over- time in a preceding class) for being late, that tar- diness may be an indication of the pleasure with which men look upon these time-clock courses, that no one should be denied knowledge if he wants it, and that neither instuctors nor undergraduates deeply interested in their subject 1vould be as dis- tm·bed by the entrance of late-comers as some people would like to imagine. ~t~::m::::::m::mi:::::::::::::::::m::::::::::::::::m::::::::::m::::::::m:::~:::::::::::m:::::m::: II F :~:Does Inventory ~~~;s II MR.

Mauge.r TUESDA.Y, FEBRUARY 28, 1928 NECESSARY, BUT NOT SUFFICIENT The annual sec<md semester selection of students to membe1·ship by the national hon- orary societies is invariably greeted by derisive cmnrnents reg-arding the qualities of the hon- ored students. The fact that high marks is a requisite to election to many of these societies frequenc.y fosters the growth of a radical mis- conception of the purpose of the org-anizations. Scholastic excellence, often interpreted as abil- ity to grind and always discounted as testi- mony of intelligence, it is hue, is a necessary requirement of a candidate. But, both the tra- ditions of the societies and the constitutions of their chapters repudiate the prevalent un- dergraduate belief that it also is a sufficient condition. Phi Beta Kappa, the first honorary fratern- ity to be founded in this cou~try, existed for seventy-five yeaTs without taking- marks into consideration. The constitutions of most of the societies state explicity that the membe1·s shall be \elected primarily from the best scholars of the graduating class.\ There is no require\ ment, however, that all those who receive high rank be automatically electe-d. Before students can be elected to membership; they must be ap- praised by a ''human audience,'' all of whom are advised of their duty to consider characte1' in its widest sense, as well as g-rades, before casting their votes. s.v.s. ME!RELY OPINIONS Du1·ing March, The Concordiensis hopes to present a review of the various junior and se- nior elective courses for both academic and technical students now included in the curricu- lun1 of the colleg:e. The idea is not unique or novel but it will be new at Union. Such a prac- tice has been carried on for some yeal'S at other colleges with gratifying results, the faculty be- ing able to know how theil: courses are received by the stud:ents and the underg-raduates being enabled to express theh preferences in educa- tion. The task of presenting- this review ~s no easy one and will be impossible without the co• operation of many upperclassmen.

One of them had been at a SouthAmer- ican capital,one in the Orient. Eagerly they discussed old times and common memories, and they were still talking excitedly as they started to- ward the Otis Elevator. When they reached the door, they paused, each wishing to give the other precedence. \But you must go :first, my good friend,\ one of them was heard to re• mark.\ I'm sure the ride will be a nov- elty to you after so many years in tlie East, and I would not thi.nk of preced- ing you.\ \On the contrary,\ answered the other, \I am insisting that you enter first. We lacked some things in the Ori- ent, but theOtis, there as here,is in all the big shops and hotels~\\ We'd better squeeze in together, then, because South America, too, is well equipped! But wait a moment! You must go first, for I used the Otis on board the steamer every day!\\ I, too! I will not be out- d .,, one. Starting forward together ,they col- lided at the door.
