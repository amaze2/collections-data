Nothing could be more ghastly than to have a patient, on his way to the operating room, stuck in an elevator between floors. Modern hospital authorities are particular in selecting elevator equipment of the safest and most trustworthy manufacture. where the elevator service was infrequent. Collective Control is so arranged that the elevator automatically answers all the calls in the direction in which it is travel- ing, and does not require any operator. It aLso stops on any tr~p at all floors for which a button in the car has been pressed, the older system of control necessitating the elevator answering only one oll at a time. !I The latest development of Otis Coliective Automatic Control permits of the use of automatic push button ele- vators in the highest class and size of hospitals, where heretofore the au to- marie type was limited LO low buildings It is significant that the Medical Build- ings of the University of Chicago, pic- tured above, as well as the St. Luke's Hospitals in Chicago and Clew.:land are installing Otis CollectiYe Control Push Button Elevators, representing the bst word in hospital elevator ul)tration.

The game ' wn~ a fast and interesting one throug·hout as the score indicates. The final result of the g-ame was in 1hmbt until the final whistle. The makv;;hift lineup which the Garnet ll'am presented play~cl fairly good hall fu1· tlwiT first as~pm:blag-e and · manag-ccl to hold the upstaters fairly wdl in chPck. The <•nd of the first half found tlll' ~;earlings ah0ad by a 1:1 to 10 tallr. Tlll' ~l·cund half was merely a repe- tition -of. t h~ first half. One thing that was noticeable from the start was the fact tlmt the Frosh played in ,;purts, flashing· n strong offense at times and then fulling back to a de- fen:<ive game . After the first f-ew minutes of the first half, the Garnet assumed the lead and retained it till the end of the contest.
