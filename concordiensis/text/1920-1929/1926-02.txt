Bigger Generators- Cheaper Electricity A 70,000 horsepower hydro-electric unit recently installed at Niagara. Falls utilizes the same amount of water as seven former 5,000-horsepower units, yet does the work of fourteen such units. And it saves 7()0,000 tons of coal yearly for the nation. As more and still more .uses are found -for electricity, larger and more economical generators are installed. At the power plant, as well as at the consumer's end, important changes and startling developments have steadily reduced the cost of e1ectricity for light, power, and heat. And wherever electricity bas blazed its trail-in towns, cities, industrial centers, and rura1cqmmunities-comfort and progress h.ave come to stay. Generating and distributing electricity concern the technical student. But electricity's .application in the betterment of industry, the professions, ar~.d home life concerns every edu- cated person. Cheap electricity means many startling achieve- ments today, but countless. and unbelievable possibilities tomorrow. · 1·9DH • 11 I ·black. • degrees 3 •copying Buy a dozen I v pu thr to ket sue pa; sic sl~ me pe yo THJ Duo Ot>er_, Du Inte

In communication research, men have seen a thousand great visions in little test tubes, hundreds of new thoughts reflected in the mirrors of galvanometers. A life-time of this work is waiting for the man who loves it, and under conditions that he has always loi1ged for. A wealth of appa- ratus and materials, an abundance of knotty problems, a group of associates who are help- iug in the great work-these are a natural part of this far-reaching industry. The requirements of communication call hr deeper, ever deeper inquiry, and not only along electrical lines but in chemistry and mechanics a~ well-all science contributing the stuff of which the researcher's dream is woven. 1 1 'e5~trn El~ctric Company Makers of the Nation's Telephones Number 57 of a ser.iel I . !
