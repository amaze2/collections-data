Dean, '25 Tuesday, January 9, 1923 EXAM.lNA TIONS Eleven more days of dasses before mid-year examinations. Stu- dents will regard thif3 pmximity with mingled emotions of fear and satisfaction in proportion as these past days have marked out some progress accomplished. But the college student has passed the point where the examination is a very dread spectre tt~ he feared.. The man who has worked indifferently throughout the year will go to his quizzes with th:is same attitude foremost; any trepidation that he feels is entirely extrinsic and paternally impose€1-quite unrelated to the fact that he is not master of his sub1ect. And so the state- ment is often made that examinations should be abolished since the r~lative standing of the good and bad student is not altered one whit, since the last minute cramming is quickly forgotten, and examina- tions themselves are no criteria of the relative value of men. Examinations, however, do have a real val:ue which warrants and guarantees their continuance. Their presentations does not vary far from an approximation of the condition which will be met after graduation in to life. This business of working under pressure and mastering details with an effective grasp sufficient for repro- t!ucticm is common to all ages and modes of life. The lawyer, the doctor, the engineer,-all have to \cram\ on their daily problems withput any expectation of later keeping the details in mind, once the problem has been t:esolved. The ability to grasp the details of a case so as to possess them for itnmediate reproduotion and use, after which they are to· be forgotten equally immediately, is of itself a valuable characteristic. The review made necessary by an examina- tion presents to. the student the broader viewpoint impossible in day by day recitations. The mind is .trained to correlate its ma- terials and see the logical conections between elements that would other'v•rise appear unrelated. It is not difficult to grasp isolated ele- ments; the man of distinction is the executive who can attend to many things a.t one time, making unity of them and yet not neglect- ing the relationship of the parts o.f that union.

Dean, '25 Friday, J anwp:y 12, ~n3 INTERFRATERNITY FRJENDSHIP (Continued from page One) clition is a serious detriment to our college activities is also quite an obvious fact. Our varsity football team this year was \A No. 1\ and tltere is no donht about the prospects for our basketbaH team. All that B.ill Hardman needs to put out a good basketball team is material, and this year he has it. But were it not for this long existing schism in the personnel of our co1lege, the prospects for this basketball sea- son would be even brighter. This difficulty, hmveYer, is more personal in most cases than factional. and thus there is but one remedy. It is entirely up to the i personalities themselves. In any case it will take years to· do away 1 with this friction, for it has existed for so long a time. Boiled right; do·wn to a simPle statement it amounts to just this. Men in the position to do so alwaYs have a tendency to favor those whom they like and do not,iirst consider the man of ability. It seems almost I second nature for everyone to do tl?is,-if not, it is quickly acquired 1 after c·ntering- collq;c. I am sure that every man in college would: welcome the change if this pernicious practice were done away with,' -hnt can it he done? John F. Clark.:- Lack of co-opera tiun anll friendship among our fraternities is dotthtlcss rt drag on the progress of the college and has been blamed, by alumni competent to judge, for the comparative lack of success of 1 many of our activities. It is not that fraternity men have not the. interests of D nion first in their hearts; it is a lack of understanding~ and esteem. A frank and open discussion among the fraternity~ 111rn of the college on future policy toward the college and toward i each other would go a long way to effect a cure, and to bring the I student body into the right spirit, which under p.resent conditions is impossible. l Delwin H. Gidley:- l. nion is the mother oi fraternities and one o:f her proudest boa,.;ts is her interfraternity spirit. One will travel far to find a col- l<g·l' in which the fraternity life means as much to its students as it! does at Cnion. Seldom will a college be found which promulgates 1 interfraternitY sports and interfraternity dinners to such an extent as is done here. We have a good and smoothly working rushing system under interfraternity rules. A further example of good :feel- ing is eviclehced by the general invitation issued to all the other fraternities on the hill by any particular crowd holding the dance. I bclieYe Cnion as a college depends upon her fraternities for aid in many of her enterprises and I feel that she can rest assured o:f their united support. Wallace J. R. Fretts :- Tu my mind the Interiraternity relations at Unio·n are in a rathei· peculiar condition. I say this because to me it seems that --- -----· . ·-==;;:t ' ~LANGLEY$ .FIR.ST MODEL IN FLIGHT;-.,. \The way of an Eagle • the tn 11:G~~ ENTURY after century men broke their necks trying to fly. They had not troubled to discover what Solomon called \the way of an eagle in the ~ir.\ In 1891 came Samuel Pierpont Langley, secretary of the Smith- sonian Institution. He wanted facts. His first step was to whirl flat surfaces in the air, to measure the air pressures required to sus,. tain these surfaces jn motion and to study the swirls and currcmts of the air itself. Finally, in 1896, he built a small steam-driven model which flew three-quarters of a mile. · With a Congressional appro- priation of $5o,ooo Langley built a large man-carrymg machine. l3e- cause it was improperly launched, it dropped in to the Potomac River. Years later, Glenn Curtiss flew it at Hammondsport, New York. Congress regarded Langleis .a.ttem.pt not as a sci<:ntitic experi.,. ment but as a sad fiasco and ·G.eneral (jentr.\l Office Com. refused to encourage him further. Be died a disappointed man. Langley's scientific study which ultimately gave us the airplane seemed unimportant in I 8.96. Whole newspaper pages were given up to the sixte~n-to-one ratio of silver to gold. cc Sixteen-to-one\ is dead polit- ically. Thousands of 4irplanes cleave the air- airplane~ built with the knowledge that Langley acquired. In this work the Laboratories of the General Electric Company played their part. They aided in developing the ct supercharger,\ whereby an engine may be sup- plied with the air that it needs for combustion at altitudes of four miles and more. G<;tting the facts first, the Langley method, made the achievement possibl(:. What is expedient or important today rna y .be forgotten tom or Pow. The spirit .of scientific research and its achievements endure. .

Richard R. Or am:- The situation on the campus relative to fraternity and nonfra- temity men is. as I see it, tinavoidable. As long as there is a fra- ternal and neutral body, separate and distinct, there is bound to be by the very nature of the circumstances more or less of an undercurrent of friction and subtle criticism. Regretable as it may appear, perfect harmony and co-operation and singleness of purpose cannot be at- tained while the constitutents are divided into highly centralized units such as the present :fraternity organizatio:ns. While such a condition exists we may expect conditions about as they are. It is my personal belief that the fraternity system in the college is for the best and that the advantages fai· outweigh the disadvantages. Inter-group and interfraternity petty politics are the sole cause Edward A. de Lima:- College life is no more Utopian in character than any other phase of our present day existence. Theoretically, relations be- tween the various fraternities should be most friendly; their whole strength should be united and expended with but one end in view, · the supremacy of their Alma Mater. Practically, this cannot be, for our of the keen competition for college honors between the · various :fraternities misunderstandings and jealousies are bound to · arise, for we ate all young apd human. It is a condition which to the older mind mighit seem depl-orable, but to us merely inevitable and must be accepted as such.

The time of the year, the schedule of the day, and mo-re than anything else, the spirit o:f the proposal, should make the occasion decidedly worth-\'.·hile. It should instantly re- commend itself to Union students. CoNege life changes with the generations, and most of our fathers have only the inadequate con- ception of college life that is conveyed home by infrequent corres- pondence. If Dad is taken to classes i.n the morning, to the track meet and baseball game in the afternon, and to some show or college smoker in the afternoon, Union College is bound to profit by the good time he is sure to have. The best way to make anyone your friend is to share your experiences and pleasures with him. \Ask Dad, he knows,\ \vhether he \•a:nts to come or not. He'll jump at a chance to see the surroundings in which his boy spends Dad's money getting an education. He's heard a lot about Union :md he has a natural curiosity. Union College has much to gain by exhibiting itself in such a manner. You do not need an initiation or even an introduction to perceive and understand the glory of old V nion. Ask Dad to be here May 5. inter-fraternity sectionalism and that we shall inter-fraternity spirit fighting undivided for the W. R. Galt Duane:- have strong united glory of old Union. The question of campus politics is not one of inter-fraternity friendship, but is the result of an alleged grouping of certain frater-1 nities for political advancement. AU intercgtoup friendships should be formed naturally and freely-not pedunctorially, or as the result of outside influences. A friendly feeling must emanate from the fmternities themselves. A grouping of iratern:ities based on con- geniality, simil<trity of ideals and achievement is natural; a groupin•g based on political advancement is artificial and detrimental to col- lege and to all concerned. Everyone should ehoose his own friends, but in questions which concern the college as a whole, personal or fraternal predilection should not enter. Edward W. Erdman:- To begin with, lett us all lay our cards on tl~e table face up. I speak for myself and I am sure for our house, and I hope for the entire college. We hold neither hatred nor disdain for anyone. We regret certain events which have happened in the pa:st, but time has INTERFRATERNITY FRIENDSHIP always removed the sting.
