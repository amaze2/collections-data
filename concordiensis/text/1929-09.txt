Inadequate quarters and insufficient ·:help to handle the students, who must obtain books immediately in order to keep from falling behind in their class work, deprive the book st<He of its usefulness. With insbr·uctors giving assignments right from the first da.y of classes, it becomes neces- sarJ every year fer the entire Student body to descend upon the store in a vain attempt to obtain necessary hooks. Some invariably are unsu-ccessful and they begin the year by falling a week -or more behind in their work. The difficulty cannot be laid to any single c-ause. One person cannot pm;sibly take care of the large number of buyers.

Student body, m:ged the yearlings, in picking their class officers, to dis1·egard politics and to elect the men best fitted for office. The sug- gestion, although perhaps too idealistic to find much favor upon the campus, is wortl1y of ser- ious consideration. The highest loyalty of every college man is, supposedly, to his Alma Mater. Politics, no matter how clean, are no benefit to a college. V\lhen they became surfeit with double-crossing and lying, as they usually do, they arc a de- cided detriment. They are, then, not only us~c­ less but even dangerous. It may be argued that politics are a benefit to fraternities, to whom the college man's sec- ond higheHt alllcgiancc is due. This is cnon- cous. Ewry fraternity, under the haphazard rushing system in use at Union, pledges a cC'r- tain number of good men. These would obtain as much recognition in straight elections as they do in balloting under the deal system. They would obtain more, for the campus shows more respect for a man known to have obtained his honors squa1·el.v than for one who is merely a good politician. To the powers tlmt be: We should like to meekly suggest that the editors, columnists, jokesmiths, and readers of the Concordy, as well as the great army <Jf ev·en-ti!mpered souls ·who dislike to hear an olcl joke l'epeated, would be greatly obliged if the :forthcoming Electrical Laboratory were well supplied \vith drinking fountains.

F1·om the point of view of both fraternity a:nd pledge, the present sys- Untillast year the faculty pursued the policy .tern seems rather unfair. But what to do? of giving the Student body one Saturday off during the football season to premit attendance at one of the away games. This was usually granted for the Hamilton or Williams game. Interest in these two games dwindled how- ever, and last year the Student body request>Cd permission to attend tlie Columbia game in New York Some member of the faculty, however, chose to believe that the students would go to the metropolis, not to sec the game, hut to \make whoopee\. The permission was refused and, in addition, no holiday was granted at any time. After the Columbia game, The Concordiensis receiv(!d numerous letters from New York alumni, commenting upon the poor a tbendance. at the game and bewailing the Jack of college spirit. The alumni were wrong. Union does n<Jt lack college spirit but, although many of the faculty refuse to believe it, most of the men here arc not willing to bolt classes and acquire the string of zeros that accompanies such de~_ linquence. The college year has been made longer this year. One day of classes can make little dif- fel'ence in the amount of work that can be cov- ered during the year. A return to the custom o:f gmnting one Saturday off can do little harm, wJ1ile the stronger support given the team would certainly make. a favorable impression upon alumni and others present at the game. If such a holiday is to be granted, why can- not it be the day of the Columbia game? The faculty has merely guessed that Xew York •,vould have a harmful influence upon the stu- dents. Their judgment was, in effect, trial not only .·without jury but without hearing, for the Student body has been given no opportunity to show tha.t it really wishes to see the game and does not intend to abuse the privilege. Surely the desire of the alumni to Ree Union wdl supported against Columbia and the favor· able effect that a good attendance would have upon the :-;pcdators arc great enough factors to warrant a trial, for one yeat at least, of the Student body's intentions in desiring this holi- day. * * * * With the football schedule opening this week, and the Freshmen Class working, industriously, it is to be hoped, on our various cheers, it might not be amiss to mention in passing, the need of several peppy cheer leaders. Somehow or other, we are not getting all of the best men available for this position into the harness. For various reasons, men who are of the required caliber, while realizing the importance of the office, are wont to regard it with either scorn or humor. A cheering section is as strong as its leader, certainly, and if we do not take ad- v::tntage of our possibilities in prospectiv·e can- didates, we cannot expect to have the support for our teams that they sl10uld have. * * * * N. B.-Our sage and propl1et, Tom Gould, has predicted a successful football season this year. In fact, it is rumored that Tom might even consider a friendly wagel.' if he could dis- . cover an interested person. CLASS OFFICERS In the midst of the furious political cam- paign which has been raging over the campus it might be well to stop and reflect upon one of the gravest ahus·es that exists despite the consensus of opinion of the Student body that it is wrong; that is the present system of nom- inating class offi.ce1·s. The present system of nominating wheTein officers of the junior and sophomore classes are named in the confusion of the first Student body meeting has resulted in se1·ious errors be- ing made. Often men who arc not in the class that is nominating put up men for office and on is nominating put up men for office and Qn more than one occasion nominations wer•e closed by members of other classes because they were tired of listening to the proceedings. Through this haphazard system is it any wonder that evils have crept into the politics in the college. The Terrace Council should take the initia- tive by supervising the nomination of class offi- cers in separate class meetings in which every man would have a fair chance to- put his man up for the desired office. \LEE\ HEATH, '30, Representative ~ on ~ the ~ Campus ' ' i \ I 't Undoubtedly Fall's popular color is brown-not the kind of browns t h::tt you used to see-· but unusual shades of brown-· -hriek browns ---;.·ed browns-----browns that are n:l t brown at aU-browns that are. ve:y b:towh. . . ..
