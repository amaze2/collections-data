Yes, the short, dark one, with the pleasing body and those frightened pyes like a puppy w:p.o has just been scolded for re- l~eving himself .op. the living-room rug, and is afraid that he is going to be beaten or thrown out or the house. Yes, she does have a sort of mutely terrorized look about her, although she is well put to- gether. Do you know who she is? Yes, the owner's wife; he tends bar, there he is, the big fellow with all that white hair on his head. No he is not Irish, al- though he do'es look like one; he is Italian. Yes, so is she. Well, he tends bar anu she cooks. As you linow, I have been taking my meals here ever since I left the club a few months ago and so t have come to know them quite well. His name is Paolo and hers is Maria; they come from the ~outh of Italy sGmewhere but have been in this country for about thirty years now. He is 53 and she is 44. Yes, they were married when she wag very young. They have no child- rf?:n, for she was in an accident a long time ago, and so is released from the bother of children, al- though I know she would have loved to have had a few. She is still quite active though, and that is part of my story. Well, about two days ago I was sitting right here in this same booth when I ::;uddenly felt an urge for some female companion- ship. You know I haven't even spent an hour alone with a woman since Franc.esca left me. Paolo, I said, as I called him to sit down here, Paolo, you are a bartender and you know the peo- ple around here. very· well. You have many friends and you know everything that happ<'ns. Can you tell me where I can find a woman for tonight? \Signor you are a good man. You have been coming here to my place for a long time and you have always been nice. You get drunk too much sometimes, but you are always quiet. I wish you would not ask me that questi<>n\. \Why?\ I asked him, noting a tired gleam come into his resign- ed face. '\Well\ he said \I am a busi- nessman: I have been in this busi- ness for a long time, but Maria and I do not make .mough money. So, and I am telling you this be- cause I know you are a good man and will not say anything, so, I have a little extra business on the side. In a word, Maria will go with you tonight. Upstairs we have an empty room.. No, don't say anything, she will go. It will be better for you to take her than someone from the street. She is clean, and I have taught her well. After all, we have lived to- gether for over thirty years; in that length of time a woman can- not help but learn, especially with me as a teacher. :mh ?'' At this last, he started to smile, but quickly changed his mind and turned to Maria. With a wave of his hand, she turned pale, and started to prote~£. but he said something I could not hear and she went up the stairs over there. I have never seen a woman look so sad. So, there I was. I needed a woman, and the woman was there. No, I did not think for an instant whether she was too old or not, <she isn't>, but I had a funny feeling-. It is strange, to say the least. to have a man you kno·w and like offer you his wife for a price. I did not know what to do. As I had drunk quite a bit by that time, my senses overcame my r<>ason, as they sometimes do to all men. and ... I went up the stair case after Maria. Upstairs there is a little room.

Friday, May 4, 1956 Page Three How To l\tlake Your Date A· Drink by peter casslleth The subject of this article is the solution to a dilezr.ma o.ne all'.ays faces on Prom Weekend. If you are a novice, the dlfticul- ties and obstacles you must encounter may seezp. inaurmount- able. You may even remark, \1 -can't do it\ or ''I\ll probably flub it.'' To dispel this uncoHeg'iate, defeatist, always-say-die attitude the follo·w\ing directions are hope~ fully dedicated. The drinks lillted beloow should allow . you to choose so.n <e that you Will enjoy and find suitatle to your t.a,;te. The b.est approach to concocting drinks is the casual one. You should never appear to concentrate too hard on what you are doing. This does not mean that you should be as care- less as to spatter liquor over your bar, desk; chair or floor, depend- ing on the limitations of space and the level of inebriation. Such an error often evokes a .feminine snicker, or, more deadly than this, the lrno~1ng iook ~hich strikes terror into tfle stauncnest heart and says, \He's never done It before.\ While preparing a drink, your geE?tures should flow as the liquid from .. bottle to glass~srr•oothly and surely. Every woman loves and admires such technique. It is to your advantage to- consci- entiously and frequently practice to avoid amateurish bungling. Ail you see above, little equip- ment is required to start you on your way and ·the few essentials can be cheaply bought. Liquor is an integral part of any \eek- end, and its deft appli:cation re- sults. like the cigarette, in pack- ing more pure pleasure into it. ON THE ROCKS Liquo.r on the rocks <c.ubes of frozen '1\ater floating in alcohol) is perhaps the simplest drink to prepare, but you must b<i> cau~ ti<ius. \\In this ungarnished state, the quality of the drink is read· ily discernible and if you should be using :Phil Tenniscourt's Old Kentuck.y Sour Grain Rotgut, you may b.e looked upon with some disdain. It is better to postpone these· preparations until later ih the evening <When hardly anything can .be sensed The liquid comp-onent of an \on the rocks\ drink can 'be any of a wide as- sortment; vodka., hawever, should be reserved fot II10re intriCate treatment.

In pur- chasing the vodka, you should sp·ecify the 100 proof variety. A quantity ·of :1,00 proof rwill seem to be equlvalent, to the critical female eye, to ali equal amount of 80 .proof, while actually ma.kl- ing a more substantial dMrr:\t. The screwdriver thereby thwarts those who insist on \only a small one.\ The beauty of the drink lles in the fact that it tastes lik<e' orange· juice. Even with a ratio of two to one, its healthy flavor remains.

SOURS Rye and scotch are the bw6 most popular .ingredients of this gro.up of drinks. They have the advantages of disguising ·'l'.hat might be termed an inferior ]}lend of liquoi·, eliminating the raw taste, and providing a pleasant sensation.

If not uprooted m the near future. these will grow t·apidly as weeds, choking off student cooperation and strangling the present library svstem. • Mr. Plattnet·'s letter, which appears elsewhere on this page, is a bitter summary of the feeling that the book raid created on campus. Although the methods used to g:!in entry to t·ooms were all legal, they were hardly above- uourd. Hifling· rooms while persons are out, even if proc- tored by J. Edgat· Hoove1·, will hardly win friends or in- fluence people other than unfavorably. The liln·ary staff is crying for student cooperation, but it has taken few measures to obtain it. Bringing the matter ud before the Tippecanoe Conference is a good idea, but such a move should have b~en made before Wed- nesday's unannounced visits. Our prescription is plenty of publicity, pointing out the problem and asking cooperatiOn.

The shoe, however, isn't only on one foot. Students fuund in possession of these books are hanlly blameless. Some of the volumes came back in extremely pom· condi- tion. Pen;nns unable to locate a book missing from a li- brary shelf have no complaints coming if they are the pos:;e:;sot·s of several ,;uch \'olumes themseh·es.

W'hen he finished his beautiful scene with Miss Burne by asking if she'd seen his Pat Rooney imitation, everyone-even the rest of the cast-stopped breathing for just an instant and silently acknowledged a wonder- ful few moments. Without the faintest taint of the artificial, Mr. Hauptman brings an enormous understanding to his part. He is quiet and gentle without ever seeming merely meek. His per- formance leaves no one asking more. The scene itself is the most powerful in the play as it applys the fragmentary ideas scattered everywhere to a tightly knit few moments.

John \lu·:eruk j7 From the time the din of the cabbies' meeting is first heard in the next room, neither the ener- getic performing of the cast nor the interest of the audience re- laxes for a moment as the Mountebanks shout their way to the year's best and most exciting Hanna Hall production. Odets' play is now some 20 years old, but Lynn Swearingen - and Mrs. Donald Miller have made it fresh with a fast-paced arena in- terpretation. With tht> Pnthusias- tie support of the actors. they are able to engage the audience in the actie>n while entirely unself- consclously maintaining the essen- tial separation between audience and actor, The simple set is able to establish a definite mood with wonderful economy; the audience is never distracted and the actors are accor-ded all of the necessary freedom by the simple unencum- bering ar-rl;lngement. The level of performance is con- sistently high, but one of the most exalted moments of the sev- eral years we'vE< known the Mountebanks stands well out fram the rest: the scene of Mir- ia;m Burne, Richard Cooper and Bruce. Hauptman. Cooper is sim- ply excellent as Miss Burne's hardened older bt·other who trys to end her romance with penni- less cab driver Hauptman. Miss Burne is restrained and sensitive in her picture of the young girl facing the fact of a dellression, but not yet hardened tD it. But Bruce, Eauptman provided Milt Herman and Joel Plattner contributed sound characteriza- tions. Herman as a tough-talking but deeply afflicted driver was ad- mirably cast, but it w·as more than just good type-casting. He lived his lines and we, for one, believed them. As Fatt, the union secretary, Joel Plattner was classically the \ham\ actor. But who ever saw a union business agent who was not? As Edna Mitchell, Herman's wife, Polly Gilman leaves a great deal to be desired. She simply will not be that woman. Her lines are spoken as if they are \play- acting\ and not something she ever could live. Not that she Is flagrantly artificial; she is not. It is just that she cannot fully reconcile herself with this Mit- chell person. Very strong are the character actors. Marjorie Nelson is superb as the humane yet hal'd boiled communist secretary. She is pel'- haps the only member of the cast who needs no Jines. Frederick Hall as Agate Keller, a wise-crack- ing one eyed cabbie, ·places an almost magical spell on bis audi- ence as he moves around the room weaving the rather dis- junctive action of the play to- gether just has Hauptman's scene united the ideas. Aside from the inevitably youthful voiCes of most of the ca'St, nothing , stamps the per- formance \amateur\. It is a good show.

Walsh plans for the future. ~ \Our group's responsibility,\ says Dick, \is to see that we have sufficient facilities to handle present and future needs. Telephone usage is growing every year, and we keep up with this growth by keeping ahead of it. \For instance, to meet the increasing demand for communication circuits in our area, we're adding 7d';ooo new chan- nel miles thi~ year alone, at a cost of $3,500,000. Laying new cable will give us 40,000 of those channel miles, and we'll get the other 30,000 through use of carrier equipment, which lets us send a number of long distance calls on each pair of wires simultaneously. • \Thus though a cable might have only 300 pairs of wires, we can, with carrier, make it carry over 3000 telephone calls at one time. Using carrier equipment to get extra circuits out of cable-which is expensive to make and lay-is an example of how we engineer to give high-grade service at the lowest possible cost. \Before I graduated from college I had interviews with twenty-eight companies. Out of all these I chose the telephone company because it had the most to offer in the way of interesting work, training and opportunity. This certainly turned out to be true. In a growing business your opportunities grow, too.\ Diek Walsh graduated in 1953 fr6m the University of Delaware with a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering. There are :many interesting career opportunities· in other Bell Telephone Companies, and in Bell Telephone Lahora• ·tories, Western .Electric and Sandia Corporation.

The clues come fast and furious, but Mr. Hitchcock stays one step ahead of the audience at every· tum, while managing to insert a number of clever quips and jibes at various institutions and at the.

A common situation, exceedingly usual characters, and the hazards of maintaining a run- ning gag in as unlikely a place il.s a train, are skillfully controlled by that master of frolicsome mys- tery, and combined to provide a fresh variation on the Hitchcock theme.

Michael Dinnocenzo, Student Body President-Eleet and outgo- ing HPC President, said that it was very serious to W1alk out of the library with unsigned-for books.

Some which have taken a good bit of our time this year are the following: 1. Athletics and Physical Education. During the y€a.T the decision has been made to add Volleyball and Wrest- ling to our intercollegiate sports prograni. As a replace- ment for Ed Fitz, we have secured John Mulligan, who will coach Wrestling and handle a good bit of the Physical Education. A new sophomore program in Physical Edu- cation, particularly in individual sports, will go into effect next fall, and Dr. Raleigh has agreed to put in a consider- able amount of his time on that program. The field house has proved itself immensely useful, and at certain times during our long wet spring it was actually overcrowded. 2. Dr. Tidmarsh's reth·ement made it necessary £m us to reconsider the whole place of Music in the College offering. After long and careful study by the faculty com- mittee, it was decided to increase the course offerings in Music and to secure as head of the department a man v.rho was interested not only in the organ and the Choir, ,but also in Band and instrumental music. Professor Edgm Curtis, the newly appointed head of the department, w111 tr·y during the coming year to build up a symphony en- semble of vVhich we can be proud. Robert Campbell, -who has been at Harvard this year on leave of absence, will return as Director of the Glee Club. 3. In our campaign for a new library building, we have had one or two bright spots of encouragement, but have not as yet secured a sufficient sum to start building. 1 hope by next fall we will be in a better position to talk about this greatly needed consrtuction. The big financial encouragement of the year was the grant of $713,500 from the Ford Foundation as endowment for faculty salaries, but we will receive only half of this for next year a:nd the other half a year later, and therefore its benefit is s<Jl:ne- what delayed. 4. On the curriculum side, the faculty has been busy revising the pmgram in Engineering, setting up new courses in Sociolog-y, .and changing the sophomore Ph ;ysics course into a cout·se in Modern Phvsics. There was .c<m- siderable discussion of the Inte1·departmental Course p\ro- gram now that the Cat'llegie Corporation experimental grant has come to an end. I am happy to see that at least three of these 1-D courses will be in the program next fall. 5. One major personal disappointment which I h:J.ve had during the year is the evidence of an alm·ming·l:y low level of student honesty about such matters as libr·ary books and· meeting college obligations concerning meals to be paid fot· in the college din-ing halls. We have assumed that college students were mature enough to realize that removing a book from circulation in the library was not only dishonest in itself but also might make it imp()ssible for other students to do their course work satisfactorily. turnstiles. Why was your room searched? N 0t because the li- brary staff likes to go on b:easure hunts costing $100 in staff time, but because your roommate or some fe\'low down the hall took some books, Ol' at least didn't bother I'eturning them. We're not asking anyone to become a \library spy\ but a little social pressure on offenders will help protect the privacy of your room and also insure that books will be on library shelves when you want them. The system will work if we make it work. ESL The New Look This is the seventh issue of Concordy to come out since the interi01· of the Publications Office received a facelifting. With clean fresh paint on the walls and a bright ceiling overhead the many hours spent in the office have been made somewhat m01:e pleasant. An overdue note of thanks is in order to the (!allege grounds crew for the time they donated in putting up the new soundproof ceiling. ESL A Poet's Reply The following poem was submitted in anonymo11s fashion to the Conconliensis as retaliation to Mr. Hal- perin's verse, reprinted below, which appeared in the prom issue, May 5. It is obvious that the author, A. Gnat, is either a supercynical professor or a high school senior, for no colleg-e student would dare deride his class in such a manner, nor have quite the ability to do so. The Pedant By Ira C. Halperin His drifting, droning hum of knowledge flows Encapsuled epigrams across the rows Of faces 'blankly bent in one intent And hurried pencilled effort to prevent His muddled distillate of heavy word From slipping out unseen, unfelt, unheard. The stoic ticking seconds wind around Unmoved, dispassionate, to the dull sound Of tenns profound and meaningless. His field Is life, dissected clean and cold to yield In labeled categorical array Of theme and unity, a vague display Of severed limbs and gaping organs red With blood a thousand poets loving shed To breathe a warmth in these assembled works Where ll()W a faint and lifeless pallor lurks. He ends his class and, midst the shuffling feet, Collects his notes and seeks his calm retreat To open wide a dusty, care-worn book And trace a path he long ago forsool{.

On the encouraging side, I was quite thrilled by the student body's gift to Professor James Morley, who, I am happy to report, now seems to have recovered his health sufficiently to go on witn his projected research during the coming year. I was also filled with admiration at the way certain activities, such as the Mountebanks, have progressed. I congratulate the Delphic Society on their handling of Parents Weekend and the House PTesi- dents Council on the Sub-Freshman Weekend. On balance, the whole year has been a good average one.
