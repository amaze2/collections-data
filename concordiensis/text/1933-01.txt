Berger THE RECOGNITION OF SOVIET RUSSIA One of tiLe most widely discussed and interest- ing problems which stands before the govern- ment of the United States of America at the present time is that which concerns the official recognition ,of Soviet Russia. Looking at the general situation, it is easily seen that the policy of our State Department to- ward Russia is a rather ludicrous one. American merchants !have all trade rights with the Soviet government that they are allowed with any other nation which we recognize. The new demand for expanding tr-ade with foreign nations, as created by the increasingly industrial character of our country, .has made trade relations with Russia an extremely important factor. The reason for this is apparent. The Soviet government, through its program for industrial expansion, is rapidly 6uilding up an attractive market for American goods. In 1930 the United States Chamber of Commerce reported that Russi;:~. was our sixth best foreign customer, and that the United States is the second best market for Russian purchases. And yet, in spite of these facts, the United States absolutely refus.es to offi<'ially rec- og-nize the Soviet government. On the face of the situation it may appear that the aforementioned facts are favorable to our present policy of non-recognition. When the situation is gone into more thoroughly, however there comes to the fore the devastating fact the present attitude of our State Department with regard to making concessions to Russia IS TO OUR DISADVANTAGE. Our potential trade with Russia is curtailed, due to the fact that the Soviet government cannot obtain, because of our policy of non-recognition, loans that will enabl{' her to carry on her industrial reconstruction Since botlt gold and credit are scarce, Russian trad·e cannot continue to be as strong as at pres- ent, u·nless A.merican firms give Russia credit in !:lome forrn <>r other. The attitude of our State Department. toward loans to Russia prevents the 'flow to that country of needed aapltal to buy _goods. Denied loans, she can only ])ay for in:l.- ·pol'ted goods with her own products which she must, of necessity, seU at any ·price she can get. This is what is meant by dumping. By doing this she runs the risk of upsetting the entire international market. The future industrial develOpment of Russia will create a. large and permanent market for .American goods. Russia, with her low standard .of living, her vast resources and urtde;veloped transportation systems, wm require numerous .. 'five-year plans\ before there will be a material slump in her demand :for American goods. Shall we not protect this great potential market by recognizing Russia? There are five reasons why the recognition of the Soviet g<lvernment will facilitate trade rela- tions between the United States and Russia. First. and foremost, as has already been stated, our trade with tile great European nation is curtailed, due to the Soviet government's inabiUty to secure loans for ~arrying out her program .of industrial ex:pansion. .Secondly, reeognltion will help estfl.b- llsh confidence and stimulate increa.s'ed activity for commerce and trade, Thirdly, Without recog- I I THE.

He also did well as goal judge for the Dartmouth~McGil:l slaughter, for it certainly could not be called a hockey game. Yes. we also played Montreal University. After buying shackles ior some of the boys, in o·rder to get them to· bed, Bill Harkness, at- tempted to limber out the \rubber legs\ and put on the appearance of hockey players. With the aid of those smart new uniforms, an outfit was established which would credit any Rogues Gal- lery. ON TO MONTREAL Some eighte·en thirsty Unionites arrived at the Queens on Thursday. :Charlie Groesbeck had been left in Plattsburgh where he went broke playing a penny machinE. After throwing bags, hockey sticks, blankets, and clothing at funny looking porters, an assemblage was held in the Tavern. Our Captain nearly caused a riot when a waiter blushed at the order \One Ginger Ale\. But, someone had to maintain the morale of the squad. -It seems that the members of the team are extremely civic minded and many soug-ht full membership into the Maroon Club, the Nationale, the Radio Club, the Kit Kat Club, and the Milano Club. Willy Jenkins, the invalid member of the aggregation finally forfeited the honor of nresi- dency of the Maroon Club to Ken Clifford, after a keen competition. Which was finally brokPn up bv the reaUzation that it was time for breakfast. NEW YEAR'S EVE IN OTTAWA Bus Williams, an ac<:oni.plished linguist. ar- rived at the conclusion that the Ecole School must be quite a svstem, after seeing it written ali over Canada. \Alf\ Bennett, the clipped wing, together with his l'Oom mate, the press acrent, our editor, did not show up at practice Friday morning, due to the fact that they were engaged in a sightseeing trip of the city. Phil Huested spent a quiet afternoon, together with his riding companion, Apey, in a snP.cial tour supervised by Mr. Molson, himsel.f. Both left yesterday to confer with Democratic leaders in Washington on the proposed Beer bill. That daring Knight of the Highwav, \Harpo\ Corbin kept the team in high \spirits\ with his French method of driv1ng, you know, passing on the right etc., and nearly overtook a handcar after chasing it up a railroad track for nearly a mile.· Our coach foresaw the possibilities of a night such as New Year's Eve in Ottawa, and acted accordin·gly. The most strenuous workout of the week was ordered for that same evening in th? Arena there. After nearly four hours of c<>ntin- uous practice, in which Harpo again figured With his unusual defensive stickwork, stretchers were used to transport the remains of the souad to the hotel for the night. And that was New Year's Eve in Canada. The trip home was accomplished without acci\ dent, except of course, thE Usual stop at St. .lean. the last town on the Canadian side, where \Stew\ Wagoner made away witll a last bottle of spring water, which was enjoyed by the occupants of .Jack Keeler's caravan. Before sigriihg off, we might ask anv con· eerned to see Schoony, that elusive counterfeit, as we hear that he has already signed up with a very notorious ring, sincE he has such an inno- cent appearance. mzmg Russia, many firms hesitate to deal with the Soviet government, and, .consequently, many contracts are withheld. Senator Borah, leading those legislators who ad'Vocate recognition, says that \Economic relations between the two coun·· tries will gain incomparalily faster under correct and stable state relations;\ Fourthly, political recognition implies certai.n trusts and guaranties without which American indu$try is slow to enter Russia. Finally, hi case of an overt act ander the present situation, tbe United States could not protect American interests already in RUssia. Existing .diplomatic relations of European countries with Russia places our commercial in- terests at a disadvantage. Germany, France, and England enjoy lucrative trade relations with the Soviets through the commercial treaties which are made possible by recognitfon. It may be wen to keep in mind the fact that, as other countries regain their economic stability and prosperity, the competiton for Russian trade will grow, and the United States wlll 'be· 'at a greater 'disadvan- tage than ever.

More Tryouts Tomonow Additional tryouts for the above plays will be held tomorrow at 1:30 P. M. in Hanna hall. Most of the parts for these plays have not been cast ;:ts yet. Only :fifteen or twenty students have competed for parts so far, but this fact is attributed to the lack of publicity on the project. Sidney D. Mark- man, '33, will direct the three one- act plays, and all casts will be chosen on Monday. January 16. Rehearsals will also commence on that date. One play was given by this or- ganization last year under the di- rection of D-Cady Herrick 1I. It was \The Little Man,\ by John Galsworthy. For that production the scenes were executed and con- structed by H. Tennyson Baldwin and Sidney D. Markman. More students are urged to try out for parts in the coming pro- duction, as there is promise of a good deal of value as well as en- joyment from such a project. A. S. C. E. TO MEET The American Society of Civil Engineers will meet Tuesday eve- ning at eight o'clock in the Old chapel. The speal\:er will be Pro- fessor S. D. Sarasom, professor of civil engineering at Syracuse uni- versity. His topic will be aerial surveying. PANTRY TO BE OPENED .T~e pantry will be reopened in S1lhman Hall Sunday evening at six o'clock under the direction of Mrs. H. Laurence Achilles. Sandwiches, coffee, cake and milk will be sold. ~·~·r----------------------------- ~ .. CORRECTION Contrary to the statement in Tuesday's issue of The Con- cordiensis, there is absolutely no evidence that Dr. Frank P. Day's operation was due to war injuries. The operation per- formed on Saturday by Dr. EJ Macdonald Stanton at the Ellis Hospital was for gall trouble and was a successful one. Pres- ide~t Day's recovery has been rap1d, although he will probab· ly remain in the hospital for at .least two weeks more. The Student Council sent flowers to the president yesterday ort ·be- half of the entire student body. •

McGee ATHLETIC MANAGERSHIPS What is the worth of working over 200 hours shoveling dirt, building pitchers' mounds, mark- ing lime lines on football fields, greasing shoes, sweeping and scrubbing floors, and chasi:ng balls? .AU of this hypocrisy is instrumental in obtaining that coveted honor of a manager of an athletic team. Undergraduates are realizing the stupidity of wasting maQy hours of valuab-le time, w'hlch might be spent to far greater advantage, and are not com]Jeting for the managership, as is shown by the n11mber of candidates out for hockey man- ager of th:is year's team. We (lame to Union to obtain an education, not to learn the fundamentals of sweeping floors and mbdng lime. More of the manual w<>rk which always has been done by candidate assis- tant managers should be accomplished by the workmen of the college, and more actual ma:n- agerial work given to the candidate managers. Anot'l!er noticeable fallacy in our system of managerships is that only one assistant manager is elected to a sport, election being based almost com'J)letely upon the hours of manual worl.;: done. Ability to :vut in the most hours does not neees- aarily exemplify those characteristics most es- sential for an efficient manager. A managership is an executive position and men most qualified for this honor have not been elected on many occasions, because an opponent has spen-t a few extra hours moving bleachers and doing work of this nature. Williams college uses a system which wax- rants our investigation. lt has been tried and proven there and works to the best advantage of both teams and candidate managers. Instead of electing from the \compets\ <One assistant manager, who automatically becomes manager the following year, two assistant mart· agers are elected. At the end of the junior y-ear the better <>f these two men ·is elected mana.ger for his senior year. The advantages of this system are quite evi- dent. lustead of resorting to the amount of hours spent in competing for the position, as a basis of evaluating the ability of the manager, the two best men are tried as executives, rather than as laborers. Managerial ability is shown and the man most capable of handling the many duties pertaining to managing a team is elected manager. ELIMINATION OF DEALS IN CLASS ELECTIONS The easiest and most complete means of r~­ moving •ideals\ and politics from clas1:1 election:s is to obtain a more representative vote. As lO'ng as twenty votes will assure election to a Class of~ fice, as was the case this year in the senior class election, deals will exist. It seems that more than half of the members of a class will never vote at a class election. This deplorable situation does exist and must be fa.ced; ,I ,I THE CONCORDIENSIS . . . . . , Peeping Thru the Key,hole Now thd everybody you ever know~and of course some ,to whom you don't ever care to .al\ lude to; have at last stopped wishing you so call- ed-Happy New Y:ear.

If men will not take the time to go to Silliman hall to vote for class of- ficers, the ballot must be taken to the individual voter, so that a more representative vote may be obtained. Other colleg-es, including Williams, use the system described above in distributing ballots, and it has proven successful. If the Student Council were to have ballots printed after the class nominations and these ballots distributed to fraternity houses, dormitories, and neutrals, a larger vote, representative of the sentiments of the majority, would result. This would make the possibility of deals more remote. These ballots wou1d have -to be signed by each voter, i11 order to avoid multiple voting. They would be collected by the Council and the choices of the majority ·Of the class would be honored by election. • I 'I 6 0 'clack means nothing to telephon,e service·!

Dvorak~s Largo Of the first performance of the Largo from Dvorak's\New World\ svmJ)hony William Fisher writes: \So touched to the heart was thP. great audience that . . . all about the hall people sat with the tears rollin~ down their cheeks.

Katzberg 23 OF 1,000 · Seniors are confronted with unemployment and sometiiDes wonder if the four years spent in college are to their advantage. Sub-freshmen ask th'llmselves if they should go to college, and freshmen, sophomores and juniors are in a quan- dry as to whether or not they should continue in college. College does not make the man, but any col- lege graduate can pride himself on the fact that of every on.e thousand children Who enter gram- mer school. only twenty-three of them will be graduated from a college or university. This, of course, does not assure success, but it does give the college graduate an advantage over the other 977. .A recent edition of \Who's Who in .America\ contains the brief biographies of 24,278 persons who have achieved note in public life, business, science, or the arts. Of this total, the college graduates number 14,055 or about 64 per cent. In other :words, the approximately one million grad- uates in the United States supply well over half ; 1 · of our distinguished men and women-while only 36 per cent are recruited from the hundred odd :rpillions of people who have n~t gone to college. It,is a)so jnteresting to note that there were only 3;022 names of persons who had atteded colleges but were not graduated~litt1e more than one- fifth as many as there are in the college- graduate class. 'Many men in Union, as well as in every school, evaluate a eollege education in tE)rmS Of earnin~ power. Education reflects directly upon the in- ' <::<>me, a~ is shown by the report of Dean Everett ; · W~· Lord ,ef . Bos~on university, nationally recog- ·nized -authority on the relation of education to sa1ary Dean Lord shows that the average un- 't~-ah~ed man's income averages less ·than $1,ioo a year for the period that he is able to work. The · · .high· school graduate's earnings do not exceed ·' :$2,800 a yea!\ while the college or technical school graduate's. income at 60 averages between $6,000 · and $8 1 500. The intellectual and cultural advantages of a college education cannot be evaluated on a mone- tary basis, but unquestionally outweigh them. It wou-ld be difficult to state a definition of · success. which would correspond to everyone's donception •of the word, without entering into ec'onomics, philosophy, and sociology~ Suecess does include happiness, good income, and a bet- ter than average understanding of' life to most of us ·and' 'these 'fundalilei:ttais are more likely to · · co~e ·to the 'c!>liege_ g~aduate .than to him w.ho is . • . , . .

This being my first appearance since the Christmas holidays I fiend that it -is my duty to pick up the odds and ends ovet•iooked by my fel- lo\\: columni:sts. I feel that they have made a very serious om-ission and think, therefore, .that it is my duty to inform my public of the latent musi\ cal talent possessed by -the Union College student body. In order to present this bit of valuable in- formation in a clear and .precise manner I must recall an incident which occurred during the va- cation. Whiie in search of a little harmless ~nter­ tainment your. columnist and .eompany dropped in at the DeWitt\ Cl-irifoii; expecting to· li'steri\ to' the ins}liPing music of Phil Romano. Upon enter- .ing. we immediately noticed that the above men- t-ioned gentleman was .absent and his position as master of •ceremonies was being· successfully ·tiBed by a visiting artist. We could hardly be~ Ueve our eyes when we discovered, that this tal- ented artist was none other tha.n <:mr own John English,. the old Maestro of the Barracks and. the :pride and joy of the capitol city. \' \' * I have been work'ing under the impression that there has been, and still is, a depression in this fair .coq.nf;ry of ours, but :r OO.u$t limit this statel:l).ent by saying .that it has: not reached the book store or :faculty as yet. I suppose· that it -is all right .to spend twenty-five dollars a semester for books, .. fifteen of this going for a course that is not even our m.ajor, but then to find that we must purchase six more books for ane course, at over two ·dollar:;; a hook, seems .almost too much at this late date. Up to this time I have never J>Ut much faith in the rumor that the Depression ]s merely a . .psyclwlogical effect and that it exists -only in the mind, not in the pocketbook, but now J' feel that I owe the author of this statement, who ever he may be, an apology-, and from now em think I shall agree qu-ite heartily with him. \' * * DO YOU KNOW: That Karl Schwenger, the Alpha Delt jail bird, spent Christmas, vacation, and intends to spend :Spring vacalion,. as the guest of the state of massachusetts.

He invited persons of the audience to bring padlocks and lock him into the can. He got inw the can, the lid was put on and fastened with several padlocks. A screen was placed i,n front of the can. Assistants stood by with stop watch·es and fire axes to save him from drowning after a certain time. About a minute :later, the screen was temov.ed, Houdini was seen panting and. dripping ..• tile padlocks remaining intact! EXPLANATION: The usual method of escaping from a milk can ls as follows: The lid of the can is apparently secure- ly padlocked to the lower portion, but actually the metal band to which the staples are attached is the top of .a short inner lining. The performer, after being locked into the can, pushes the lid upward with his head and the short inner lining is forced out of place, permitting his escape. The screen is then removed. .lVO TRICKS JUST COSTLIER TOBACCOS IN A MAT(fltLgs S :B liEN 'D vlfiLKf1dN PS[Wp_c *** ks FUN ro .o.B Ebo£.B.n . ..

Berger ON THE ABOLITION OF FRESHMAN ·'SPORTS The· cutting of college athletic bugets during tlle p.reseilt · transitional period has brought the question · of freshm~n sports to the foreground ~n!l in ro:.a~y colleges, ;most prominent of which are Dartmouth and Cornell, the complete abol· ,. it:ion ·of ·this phase of collegiate atbietics :has re- :>l.llted. The· wise management of the atP,letic de- partment _here has not necessitated the abolition of freshmen · sports, because <if iack of suffi· cient funds. to -cover the necessary expenses of freshmen teams. The financial statement for fall sports shows a surplus greater tnan had been anticipated in the budge~. There is, h-owever, anoth~r problem con, earning freshmen sports which is more import· ant than· their costs. The tendency has been here, as elsewhere, that a freshmen coach w!ll spend the greater part .of his time training a handful of men, in an attempt to present a form- idable team. Not over seventy-five men gain any advantage from this specialized training. Wqat itJ .the result! Winning :freshmetl team:;~ may or may not be produced, but in either case a very sm~;~;n part of tP,ese men will' turn out to be ex- ceptional material for the varsity teams.

We have an intramural system here which _stuggles along, but lacks interest on the part of t:~tudents.

With ·a hi!$'1:l.ly develop· ed: program such as suggested by Cadigan, with . alterations to suit our individual needs, Dr. Day's conception of a systematized intramural program would be realized. 5.

INTELLIGENT CHOo'SING We congratulate Dr. Wold and his committee o:f the faculty for paving the. way for the liberali- ~~tion of the sophomore A. B. curriculum. The new ru}es passed by the faculty make it possible f()r students to make a more intelligent choice of · their major courses. When the major system was introduced at Union several years ago, it was brought in \at the topP-that is, only the two upper years we:re re- organized. Freshmen and sophomores we~e still C()mpelled to take so many required courses that they obtained insufficient experie~ce in those sub- jects Which they might have desired to choose for majors. This \tight\ situation for the sopho- more academics- has been greatly eased by the new rule which allows a freshman, when he is -choosing his electives for his sophomore year, to sele~t a~ many as three courses in any :of three b:road fields of knowledge-language, science or tll.e social sciences and humanities-and yet com- pels him to take at least one subject in each of tllese groups. Thus; while U1e new rule assures tlle student a well-rounded, cultural background, it also affords him an opportunity to become in- timately acquainted with the introductory courses in more than one branch of a general field of knowledge. The new faculty rule should also have a stimu- lating effect upon the departments involved,. for the instructors in the elementary courses will strive to make their courses even more interest- ing and profitable than they are at present; a de- partment with poor instruction will soon find it- s~lf with very few students.

In spite of the economic dangers facing col- leges at the present time, the first class of Ben\ nington College numbering eighty women, was admitted this fall at Bennington, Vermont. ThiH college is outstanding in its teaching methods and has established a spirit which has added a new meaning to educational progressiveness. Bennington College was created to establish a curriculum especially adapted to the actual needs -of women in the contemporary wot·ld. The main features which differentiate this new institution from the traditional college of liberal arts include a recognition of individual differ· ences in aptitude and interest. No single subject or group of subjects are required of all students, either fo1' admission or grach1ation. Th,e work of the first two years '-\re arranged individually by careful conference betwen col- lege officers and each studen~ In each case the arrangeJ_Xlent of work is adapted to individual needs, abilities, \blind spots 11 , and interests. Thf~ work of the last two years, organized around the student's majo! interest as a core, is character- ized by small group work and individual enter- prises or projects. Mastery in a broad field rather than narrow specialization in a department or subject within a department is emphasized. During .the four years. methods win be de- signed to promote self dependence, independent reasoning, and direct el\:perience or participation rather than text-book learnipg. Jntellectual ac· c;omplishment is not measured by oourses or credits, nor is the administration concer11ed .sole- ly with intellectual training, It is vitally inter- ested in the physical, emotional, and character development of its students, in nothing less than the whole personality of each student, ·:=~~~~~ -~· ----- -· -------,;·- 'i· Lunch 2.5c .The Acme Barber Shop I I I .

Attillo Baggiore combbileS the powerful dramatic eloquence of Martinelli and lyric beauty of McCormack with his own infect- ious enthusiasm aRd virility. His apparent delight as he strode on the platform was symbolic of the eagerness he instilled in his audi- ence. Mr. Baggiore is above all a thorough and1 capable actor; as the accompanist began, one could ob- serve the artist infusing himself with the mood of the number, now with tb.e vibrant but refined emo- tion. of Bemberg's \A Toi\ again with the white heat of the \Flow- er Song\ aria from \Carmen\ or with the joyous exhilaration of Kountz's song of a Russian sleigh- ride. With gesture and facial play, above all with expressive modula- tion of voice, Baggiore gave to each number a dramatic effect that was at one real yet unobtru- sive. This sympathetic treatment, the richness of the tenor's voice whether in robusto passages or bel canto, and his perfection of phras- ing were all enhanced by a liter- ally amazing clarity of diction and the whole performance, which was given without notes, made superb by his utter confidence and a com- plete absence of apparent effort of forcin.g The versatility of his accomplish- ment was remarkable, as in the third group where the stirring, dramatic Dvorak ode to freedom was preceded by the simple tran- quility of Liszt's \Thou Art Like a Flower\ a number given with an exquisite loveliness of inspira- tion and artistic expression not soon to be forgotten. This very old illusion was invented by Indian fakirs. The secret was unearthed in 1849 by the great magician, Robert-Houdin. At that time, ether had just been discovered, and little was known about it. Houdin claimed that he had discovered that this new anesthetic could make people light as air. To prove it, he caused the subject to rise into the air and float apparently suspended. He passed a hoop around the body to show there were no wires or supports. It's fun to be fooled EXPLANATION: • • There are many, many explanations for this old trick. One is that the girl wears a concealed harness, which ends in a socket between her shoulder blades. This is attached to a piston below the stage. The piston is pushed up from below, causing her to rise in th.e air. The piston is invisible, because it is covered with mirrors which reflect surrounding draperies, similar to the background. The mag!- cian can pass the hoop over her body because It is cut in one place. It can be pulled apart f()r a second when it passes the piston. SouRcE: \Modern Magic\ by Professor Hoffmann. George Routledge & S11ns. NO TRICKS JUST COSTLIER TOBACCOS IN A MATCHLESS BLEND . ' . .. 1ts more Another \magic show\ is cigarette adver· tising. One of its greatest -tricks is the illusion that cigarettes can be made miraculously 11 MIIiD 11 thrcugh manufacturing methods. THE EXPLANATION: All popu\4tr cigarettes today are made in modern sanitary factories with up-to-date machinery. All are heat treated-some more intensively than others, because raw, inferior tobaccos require fun to KNOW more intensive treatment than choice, ripe tobaccos. The real difterence comes in the tobaccos that are used. The better the tobacco, the milder it is. ~ It is a fact, well known by leaf tobacco r experts, ~that Camels are made from finer, MORE EXPENSIVE tobaccos than any other popular brand. This is why Camels are so mild. This is why Camels have given mor~ pleasure ta more people than any other cigarette ever made. It's the secret of Camels' rich \bouquet'' ... their cool fiavor ... their non-irritating mildness. All the natural, ripe goodness of Camel's tobacco is kept fresh for you by the famous air-tight, welded Humidor Pack. Don't remove it.
