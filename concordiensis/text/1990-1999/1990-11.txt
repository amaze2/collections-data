Mr. Ajami is a Majid Kadduri Professor and Director of Middle East Studies at the School of Advanced International Studies of the Johns Hopkins University. He will be giving a free speech open to the public on \The Thief of Baghdad and the Summer of Arab Discontent.\ Arab politics and history. Mr. Ajami was born in the south of Lebanon and raised in Beirut. He began teaching in the United States at Princeton University in the Department of Politics from 1'973-1980. Mr. Ajami has received several awards including the James P. Warburg post- doctoral fellowship at Princeton and a research fellowship at Lehnnan Institute in New York City. In 1982, Mr. Ajami was awarded a five year MacArthur Prize Fellowship for his \exceptional talent\ in the arts and sciences as a result of his work on Middle Eastern po.litics and culture. By MATT LANNI Associate News Editor On Friday, November 2, the Speakers Forum is sponsoring a talk by Ed Bradley of 60 MINUTES. Bradley was supposed to talk during last year's Parents' Weekend, however it was postponed due to the measles epidemic on campus last spring. The Speakers Forum does not know exactly what Bradley will talk about, except for the fact that his talk is entitled \60 MINU1ES with Ed Bradley.\ Bradley's experience in journalism started with WDAS, a radio station in Philadelphia, in 1963. In 1967 he worked for WCBS, a CBS owned radio station in New York City. Bradley moved into T.V. journalism in 1971, when he worked. for CBS News. He joined 60 MINUTES in 1981 and has worked there ever since. At this time the Speakers Forum does not wish to disclose the amount of money that they paid for this highly qualified speaker. However Dan Keniry, president of Speakers Forum, pointed out that he \has no objections\ to disclosing the fee that Bradley is receiving once Bradley has lectured.

P~ge 2 CONCORDIENSIS, November 1, 1990 <!tonrorbtrnzis NEWS ANALYSIS Budget Row Will Affect November 6 By JIM POLITES The Congressional budget plan, which spanned nearly four months of floor debate on Capitol Hill, was finally passed and released last week to an anxious American .public who endured all of the rhetoric, party squabbles, and name- calling involved in such monumentallegislation. · In the wake of long deliberation and exhaustive liberal and conservative lobbying, a bill emerges that has left the political structure of the United States, both voters and representatives alike, in a state of disarray, confusion, and uproar. If effectively carried out, the final agreernent should trim the deficit $250 billion, with revenues corning from several different sec tors of the economy. This concluding product is virtually a catalog of middle-of-the-road compro- mises between Republicans and Democrats on issues of exorbitant funding that has resulted in a fiscally dangerous public debt. The h~ghlight of the bill includes an income tax hike, a suggestion by Democrats to deduct money from the richest class of Americans, which was settled at 31%, an increase of 3% from a year ago. Republicans fought tooth and nail to keep the status quo on this issue, especially considering a great deal of the party's campaign contributions come from the wealthiest wallets in society. The GOP traditionally acts as a guard dog to repel legislation that infringes on the rich's ability to gain revenue. This colossal Republican loss is only one of the vast pool of governmental failures and disappointments that surface now the complete proposal has been adopted. For incumbents seeking re- election to Congress, there was not a worse time for such inefficiency and indecisiveness on Capitol Hill. With voters coming out to voice :heir biannual opinion of those officials who best represent the people's interests, a sour taste and fresh memories of negligence on the part of legislators will strongly influence the November 6 elections. Granted, President Bush's popularity has taken a hard shot on the chin over the past two months. In fact his acceptability rating, an index of the chief executive's likability among the American people, has plummeted some 30 points during the budget crisis. he is fully aware that voters tend to forgive and forget, especially when they. witness harmonious government order once again. ~~~~ INCUMBENTS FACING TI-lE VOTERS IN NOVEMBER. Courtesy of Newsweek The President's position is secure for another two years, though, as he is only half way through a term that runs until the end of 1992. Bush can afford to relinquish the stronghold of public appeal he held for so long only because Unfortunately, those Sena- tors and Representatives who seek re-election next week are not so fortunate, for they're in dire need of a vote-generating push that will in some way offset the negativism associated with the budget. Races where incumbents once held strong le:ads are suddenly tight, as opposing party candidates have advantageously made issue' of the recent Congre.ssional ineptitude. The scar left by the budget disaster 'has levied a profound effect on the political system of the United States, especially considering. the final resolution was passed just days before a national election. The American public has been rubbed the wrong way, and now is a golden opportunity for voters to vent their frustration by siding with a lesser-known but politically clean candidate who seeks a chance to perform where his or her predecessor failed. In the end, George Bush is likely to emerge unscathed. The trouble is, he will forever be known as the leader of a torn Congress not capable of overcoming the most fundamental of domestic issues. Instead, the long line of representatives who will lose their government jobs come November 6 is proof enough that an indelible mark of poor management will always haunt the lOlst Congress. Saddam's Reign Over Western Media By DAVID WEISSMAN Why has the Western media allowed itself to fall into the arms of Saddam Hussein? Saddam 's manipulation of international media has dislocated the focus of Iraq's annexation of Kuwait on to the Israeli occupation of the West Bank. The world embargo against Iraq exists due to this annexation and therefore the Israeli- Palestinian conflict should not have any bearing on the diplomacy in the gulf. Obviously, Hussein benefits by highlighting the West Bank conflict, so that it causes a split in the fragile Arab/non- Arab alliance. Ironically, the Western media is becoming a helpful tool for Saddam's efforts. Why isn't the media reporting about the absurd atrocities of the Iraqi soldiers in Kuwait who have reportedly raped and beaten women and children? Why doesn't the media highlight Sadddam 's massacres of his own people? Why doesn't the· media report the many occasions when Arabs kill other Arabs, such as in Lebanon? If some of these ... ~..I r~use to lower prices at the pump !, .. events had received the attention they should have. then maybe the UN would authorize investigations into them and not only into the incident in Jerusalem. Or better yet, there would not be any investigations .... t all and therefore Saddam would not have the Western media as his tool for splitting the alliance against Iraq. Although no proof can be offered, many experts believe that Saddam planned the event in J em salem knowing it could cause a split in the Arab/non- Arab alliance. Apparently, he predicted correctly that Wetem media would help to sensationalize this event. Subsequently. this has squeezed the U.S. into a position of· scolding its longtime ally, Israel, in order to preserve the Arab/non-Arab compact. According to an editorial in The New York Times by Mein Rosenne, the reason for the sensationalism of the Palestinian .killings in Jerusalem stems from the historical fact the Jews are always victims and scapegoats. If only some Jews were killed by the Palestinian stoning, then Israel would not be seen as the wrcngdoer. But Western media has been manipulated by Hussein's efforts to divide the alliance against his country. Arabs massacre other Arabs every day, but when Jew kills an Arab it becomes cause for explicit international media scrutiny. By using our media. Hussein has succesfully drawn a parallel between the Israeli occupation of the West Bank to Iraq's annexation of Kuwait. Western media holds a monopoly on world news and therefore is largely responsible for the building of consensus. President Bush is also not doing his best to keep the two events separate, making the U.S. position more difficult. Bush should help to correct this fusion by separating the events. This can be done quite easily if he demands that no diplomacy on the West Bank will occur until Iraq leaves Kuwait. Hussein has only one option to bring about an Iraqi ttvictory\ and that is to divide the alliance against him so that the embargo fails and the possibility of foreign invasion becomes unrealistic. Through the Western media, Hussein has a sufficient tool to complete this goal. The media helps formulate public opinion which, in turn. will have an effect on the President's decision. The media should let the inteJnational community know what kind of evil man Hussein is; not just because of his annexation of a :peaceful territory, but because of his record of human rights crimes and his affiliations with terrorism. The Israeli- Palestinian conflict should not be brought into the Kuwait crisis, but Saddam and our media continue to tie the two together. Do not allow Saddam Hussein to use <1ur own institutions to defeat us. i I i ,.

i ! j -.~ CONCORDIENSIS, November 1, 1990 Page 3 Four U·nion Students Attend National :Research Meeting. Four Union students -- Eric Fullar, Barbara Jensen, and Patricia Pacelli, all seniors, and Susanne Hoff, now a grduate student at UC Berkeley _., were invited to attend the annual Sigma Xi meeting this October 25-29 at Research Triangle Park, North Carolina. Sigma Xi, the national scientific research honor society, sponsors activities to encourage research and to improve po.blic understanding of science a11d technology. This meeting, whose theme was the beauty of science, was attended by 536 people representing 350 colleges, universities, and industrial laboratories, and included invited speakers of international renown who shared their own perceptions of beauty in the physical, biological, :mrl computational sciences. In addition to the principal addresses and a business meeting, 25 students from across the country presented their own work. Sigma Xi organizers selected the students from among 500 in the sciences at the fourth annual National Conference on Undergraduate Research. The at Union on April 19-21, and was attended by over 1,400 participants from almost every state. Eric Fullar, student colleague of David Peak, Professor of Physics, reported on his experiments on the mechanical properties of laboratory analogs of wispy fractal dust aggregates which may have played an important role in the formatic:m of the solar system. The experiments involved dropping projectiles into the dust and measuring the resulting impact craters. Susanne Hoff, a student of Les HuB, Professor of Chernistty, described her work involving the correlation of the chemical reactivity of a series of compounds with their spectroscopic behavior. Her results indicated that accurate predictions can be made about how fast the materials under study will react without having to do the measurement. Barbara Jensen, a student of Michael Frame in the Mathematics Department, .presented her studies of sets of points produced by repeatedly applying the geometrical process called inversion in circles. Magnifying these sets of points reveals the same structure on smaller and smaUer scales; Barbara did computer investigations of how these sets of points change as the inverting circles are moved. Patricia Pacelli, another student of Michael Frame, described her computer ex.amination of how a particular method of image generation (\deterministic iterated function systems\) can be used to produce pictures. Patricia analyzed the number of steps needed to produce a picture of a desired resolution, and demonstrated how the picture produced is independent of the starting shape. The sharing of knowledge between students and distinguished scientists at this meeting reinforces the importance of research at the undergraduate level. Under- graduate research teaches students about the vitality and practices of their field of study, and allows them to exercise their creativity in ways not provided by standard course work.

FLOOR EXIT LIGHTS & CEILINGS Faculty Evaluations Are Important By KAREN HURWITZ As the Fall term is more than halfway over, this is an appropriate time to educate our student body about the extreme importance of the faculty evaluations that are filled out at the end of each term. These evaluations have been a topic of much discussion and debate on various committees on campus including the Faculty Review Board (FRB) and the Academic Affairs. Council (AAC). These committees are investigating the possibilities that these evaluations currently may hinder and not support the goals of improved teaching. At present, the green evaluation sheets that are filled out by students at the end of the term play a significant role · · in detennining tenure, 3rd year reappointments, and merit pay raises for members of the Union College faculty. It cannot be stressed enough then how important these evaluations are, and that they need to be taken very seriously by all Union students. The evaluations are one way for students to responsibly report back to their professor and the Chair of that department their impressions of a class. Professors can use positive as well as negative feedback in a number of ways including measuring the effectiveness of course materials, examinations, assignments, and teaching methods. Students' comments on the back .side of these evaluations (the short answers) are especially helpful to the professor if the student has taken the time to fairly evaluate the course and the professor. Continued on page 4 College Picks Four Finalists for Watson Fellowship Continued from page 1 to better serve our country as he works to alleviate environmental problems. The Underground Gay Press as a catalyst for the Development of the Gay Liberation Movement in Brazil, France, and Spain entitles the Watson Fellowship Proposal by Edgar Letriz. Letriz is fluent in both French and Spanish and would like to use these linguistic talents to speak to editors of publishing companies of underground gay presses, many of which existed in the 1960's and 1970's. He hopes to learn more of the their key involvement in the gay liberation movement in Brazil, France, and Spain and \as an aspumg professor and researcher on the gay and lesbian culture ... (he) hopes to write in what society seems to have erased.\ Hans Schwarz would like to use the Watson Fellowship to \study the relationship between nationalism and economic conditions\ in the countries of Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, Malaysia, and Sri Lanka. His proposal, \How much docs economic disparity between different nations in a single state foster nationalism or lead to ethnic conflicts?,\ would allow him to gather firsthand information on a topic for which no such research has previously been conducted. Inspired by his German heritage, he will \observe interview, and interact with the people\ allowing his German language skills to aid him in his study of religious, educational and political institutions. Through this knowledge Schwarz will not only understand the impact of economics on an individual but on a nation as a whole. Shelly A. Szymko has titled her proposal \Socialism in Transition'' in Eastern Europe. With the Watson Fellowship she would like \to travel to Yugoslavia, Hungary, and Poland to explore the transition of the centrally planned economy to the free market system through the introduction of East-West joint ventures. Her interest in this topic has been influenced both through her recent student exchange program in the USSR. In addition to her Russian language skills, Szymko plans to study Polish, Serbo-Croatian, Yugoslavian, and Magyar to help her as she works side by side with the people. She hopes that this technique will allow her to \broaden (her) understanding of the vast gap between the American and European economic systems\ and\past and present ideologi~s that shapes EasterirEutopean Life.\ In order for these students to be chosen by the Watson Foundation they must be interviewed by the director of the Watson Foundation, Steven Licata. They also must expand on their ideas and write another more in-depth proposal. Union College in the past has had 31 winners since the founding of the Watson Foundation in 1969. Last year two winners were chosen from Union. Pro-Choice Meetings every Monday at 6:00 A representative from Planned Parenthood will be speaking on New Legislation at the next meeting. Everyone is welcome to .attend

Page 4 CONCORDIENSJS, November 1, 1990 Faculty Evaluations Could Stand Amendment Continued from page 3 It is a student's contribution to improving the quality of our education at Uni~n to take these evaluation& seriously, since these evalu.ations will ultimately play a significant part in the FRB's review of a professor's perfC>rmance. It st10uld, however, l>e noted here that while these evaluations are an integral part ()f the FRB's · evaluation of a professor other factors are equally important. These include, among others, faculty research. and student interviews. The committees involved in evaluating the rn erit of these evaluations have made several important recommendations for changes in the future .of faculty evaluations. First, it has been determined that the short answers on the t'rvaluation are more helpful to -1 professor than the questi()ns which ask students to rate from 5 to 1 whether they agree or disagrec:- with various statements. The FRB has suggested that those \circle a number questions\ be suspended .for two years or complete1y eliminated. The committees have further stated that perhaps the evaluations can be improved and made more focused, by having different evaluations for different kinds of courses or departments. It may be more effective to ask different kinds of questions to students in lower vs. upper level courses, as well as it would be helpful to possibly evaluate Gen-Ed courses or senior seminar courses differently. The committees likewise suggested that it is important to educate new students on campus about the extreme importance of faculty evaluations. This could, for example, begin by educating each new freshman calss during either orientation or Fall term Gen-Ed courses. While at this time no changes have ~een implemented to the process of faculty evaluations, it is likely that changes will be made in the future. At the same time, this article has hopefully introduced some awareness in our community about the importance of taking these evaluations, regardless of their format, seriously at the end of this and every term.

By KAREN HURWITZ Speakers Forum Sponsors Lecture Continued from page 3 Speakers Forum has other plans for this year. On November 15 they are sponsoring a debate entitled \Resolved: The Congress of the United States Should Not Fund Obscene Art.\ The debate will cover the recent congressional issue of funding for the National Endowment for the Arts. Two students will be debating this issue. Tom Fallati will be taking the affirmative stance, and Max Heinegg will be taking the negative stance. According to Dan Keniry more of this type of debate are going to be scheduled for Winter and spring term. Keniry stated that these debates are meant to enhance verbal arguments on campus instead of just written debate in the C<mcordiensis and the Union Sentinel. The Speakers Forum is also trying to attract a lecturer for Parents' Weekend, and a comedian for Spring Term.

P.age 6 CONCORDJENSIS7- November 1, 1990 . . . . ' . ' . . ' '\: ' ' ' . . . . . . ·. . **** Student Forum Sophomore Class Representatives Lara Chamberlain As· I was polishing up my original statement, a friend called to say ··Hi.\ He asked me what I was doing and I explained that I was trying to find the right words for my statement. He th.::t asked me what Student Forum does. I told him that I had talked to the current representatives about what my job would entail, were I to be elected. He then said, \No what do they really do? I haven't seen any action.\ Stumped, I said, \To be honest, I don't know.\ He told rne not to worry about my statemeni because it didn't really matter what I said anyway because no one really cared. Initially, 1 was reassured because I wasn't entirely happy with my written work but soon I became more and more disturbed by his comment. It is pathetic for us to feel this way. Our school has coined the phrase, \A New U.\ We have a new decade and a new president who is willing to listen to our ideas. Our class is in a unique position because we have t'le experie11ce of our past year:: nd yet we have three more years at Union. We know what needs to be changed to achieve the \New U\ and at the same time we have felt the strong Union tradition that needs not be destroyed for this \New U\. I am n<Tt saying that our representatives have not been doing their job. On the contrary, I think that they have been working very hard to make sure that our voice has been accurately portrayed. They, however, seem to be upset that their words are just words and despite their efforts, nothing is being done. I , Lara Chamberlain, would be honored to be elected to this position of representative, would work very hard with the current representatives, and would take it as a challenge to prove to you that with the new president we can have action. * * E ......... •'•. Anthony Albanese Hi. -My name is Anthony Albanese and I am running for the position of Sophomore Class Representative, The purpose of this fall election is to find a replacement for a current Student Forum representative who will be away in the spring. The newly elected representative will be a non-voting member throughout the winter term and will become an active voting member in the spring. I chose to run now as opposed to during the usual spring term election because this is an opportunity that will enable me to attain a great deal of exposure to the Student Forum before I actually become an active voting member. The role of representative is to communicate your ideas and opinions to the Student Forum. Therefore, a representative must be someone who you can interact with easily. A representative should be someone who you feel comfortable enough with to stop on your way to class and relay a suggestion to. This is an important time in our student government, especially for us, because many . decisions are now being made by the school administration which are directly affecting our class. We need to be a ware of these proposals before they are decid.ed upon so we can have the opportunity to express our views and make a difference. We all have the power to make a difference, it all begins with a single vote. A big voter turnout this Friday will show the administration that we do Care About U! Vote for Anthonv Albanese fer sophomo~e class representative on Friday. November 21 Aimee Murdock While many students are voicing their concerns about the important critical issues, there seems to be a lack of active people involved in solving these problems. This leaves a gap which prevents action from being taken in favor of the students. Through dedication, hard work and your support, I, Aimee Murdock, can work to fill this gap. The current issues are very important to the sophomore class and we need to find answers wbich will benefit everyone without drastic change. The housing problem must be addressed because the school is losing money by having empty beds, and on the other hand most upperclassmen prefer to live off campus because of inadequate housing. We need to find a compromise instead of just forcing juniors on campus without any choice. Yes, schools need to change with the times, but we must remember the strength in the traditions of the past. There are many other important concerns such as the middle states report, Greek life, minority integration and others which concern the population at Union College. We need to keep in mind the. tradition of Union and the answers which would be beneficial to the student body as a whole. I am no.t afraid t.o voice my:.opinign, · but I am receptive to other· people's ideas and willing to listen to other people's opinions.

My objectives, as ) our representative, are to maintain and better the academic and social con<Jjtions at Union, as well as to voice the attitudes, complaints, and interests of the freshman class. I will do this by communicating on a regular basis with the members of the Class of '94. The Student Forum needs the input and participation of an active representative. Vote KEITH MEIER for Freshman Representative tomorrow. Sreedhar Samudrala Union College is fast approaching the 21st century under the leadership of our school's 17th president, Mr. Roger Hull. Under his administration, Union College will be entering a new and exciting chapter in our school's history. I, Sreedhar Samudrala, would like to represent our freshman class and take part in this exciting move to our future. The freshman class is an integral component of the student body and we deserve full representation. Working with our new administration, I see OUr StudentForum taking a more active role in the decision-making process, rather than 'rubber stamping' tbe administration's decisions. Visions for '91 PROGRESS is Necessary! 1. I see a resurgence of the vitality in the clubs and activities at Union College. 2. I see students taking a more active role in issues on and off campus. Union as a school involved in community service work. We're minutes from the state capital and only hours from New York City and Boston. There is a whole world out there ready to explore beyond our campus. 3. I see the expansion of our student life programs from th~ Cabarets, concerts and seminars... to... more dances, guest lectures, entertainers, and, yes, even parades and rallies. These measures will stimulate the intellectual, social and cultural atmosphere on campus as well as reinvigorate our school's sense of spirit. 4. I see greater equity in the freshman noosing system with a more complete distribution .of students to Potter, Raymond and Hickok bouse. Also, I see the, expansion of the Hickok program to involve all three of these houses. And, finally, Union College, the 'Mother of Fraternities' will always be the 'Protector of Fraternities and Sororities'. 5 . I see the clubs and organizations unifying with an increased level of student support. Our Student Forum will lead the students to a more fulfilling future as a school community. I am encouraged by the increasing activism on campus from the development of our recent Recycling Program to the enthusiasm generated by the newly formed \We Care About Union\ committee. As vice-president of my high school and editor of our school's paper, I have had a lot of experience in dealing with students, faculty and administration o promote change. I envision the Student Forum working closer with our administration to build a brighter future for Union College. However, our plans cannot work without your participation and support. Remember, \Union is what U make of it.\ I encourage our entire freshman class to vote in tomorrow's election and together we can make a difference. Amy Glassman Hi; I'm Amy Glassman. I'm running for Freshman Class Representative for the 1990-91 school year. As one of yoor peers, I will s~ to it that your voice is heard.

Representative Elections ** Freshman Class Representatives Blaine Langberg Fellow Freshmen, I a:m proud to have this opportunity to represent our class. As freshmen, we are presented with the unique chance to put our pasts behind us and begiT' anew. We need someone who is going to listen to our opinions and act for our best interests. In this frame of mind, I believe it is essential that we address the forthcming issues that will have -an important effect on our educational and social experience at Union. The concerns which presently have the greatest bearing on our class are: Camp Union, co-ed housing, and student. apathy. 1 understand how we all have been very busy with the difficult school work and the freedom of our new found \extra-curricular social activities.\ Dspite this fact, each freshman must be aware of the realities concerning this college. Camp Union, a campus wide social event held every spring, includi:lg live bands and barbecues, was taken away by the administration this :previous year. The reinstatement of this event, which every student has looked forward to in past years, must be brought to the attention of the administration and our opinions must be heard. Another important item which calls for action is co- educational housing. Union has a duty to prepare its students for the \real world\. Whether or not this duty i11cludes the combination of the sexes in residential life remains to be decided. Our :C!lass's opinion must be heard on this topic also. Finally., the lack of participation by the students at Union, must be accounted for. Your feelings aJJd suggestions for solving the question of student apathy are of first importance. As you can see, we are not only faced witll a challenging academic sclledule and the change of env.ironment, but also major deci~i()ns about our future here at U11ion, which must be attended to. I, Blaine Langberg, am tlie candidate who will ease the communication between our class and the administration. I, Blaine Langberg, am the candidate who wil turn your thoughts and uncertainties into action and results. Mia Caetano My name is .Mia Caetano and I am running for Freshman Representative_ First, I would like to give a li1tle background on my expe-rience and qualifications for tllis job. In high school, even though I was involved with three Varsity sports, acted an.d was the assistant director in the theater. I always made the time to actively participate in the student government_ Being .treasurer for three years, I . helped org.<~nize many functions, incl11ding dances, The Academic Program Office at in conjunction Opportunity Union College witll the Schenectady Health Department will be sponsoring a Birth Control · and Sexually Transmitted Disease Workshop on Friday, Nov. 2 at the Union ,College Center Auditorium.

When our school spirit was diminishing, fellow classmates and I helped form a \zoo\ and organize pep rallies to increase support at sporting events and in all aspects of student life. Union. is vey similar to my high school in that it is a small, private school. This gives all of us the opportunity to participate in numerous activities including teams and clubs. I believe the job of Freshman Rep is very important in the sense that your voices will be heard, and your voices are what makes Union the unique school that it is. Don't forget, vote for Mia Caetano on November 2. Connie O'Neil My name is Connie O'Neil. I am a freshman at Unon and running for Freshman Representative. Currently, I am an active member of S.P.A.A. (Students for Politial Action and Awareness), Schenect;ady's Children Reach-out Program. and I am becoming involved in the Pre-law Society, and A.L.A.S. (African and Latino Alliance of Students). I feel that it is important for Union to I become more diversified not . only in the student body, but : also in the faculty. It is important for the white majority on campus to experience different relations and cultures. As a person, I am fully committed to· anything I am involved in and I am detennined to get things done. There are a lot of things, at Union, that need the student body's input to change them for the better. For this reason, the Class of '94 needs people who are committed to seeing things get d()ne, and keeping the class's best interest in front of everything. Christine Cole. Hey! My name is Christine Cote and I want to be your Freshman Representative to the Student Forum! I have always taken an active interest in student government; as president of my high school Student Faculty Administration Senate, and as treasurer of my class and of the National Honor Society. I feel that my experience dealing with administrat()rs, educators, and students will prove useful to the Student Forum. And because I llope to enter the world of politics one day, 1 feel that the Student Forum would be great experience. I hope you will give tne the opportunity to get to know you while working hard to unite the Class of 1994 and working hard to make this the best year ever for Union Co lege! Remember, on election day, vote for the person who pledges to work hard for you! Christine Cote. Nicole Goldin Hi! For those of you who don't know me, my name is Nicole (Nicki) Goldin and I'm running for the position of Freshman Representative. I feel the most important aspect of this job is to provide a link between our class and the rest of the school. As yt>ur representative, I would always be open to your ideas and opinions and would do my best to relay them to the rest of the student body and to the administration. I would work for school spirit, unity between the classes and an overall great life at Union .. I believe Union is a special place and all I want to do is see it stay that way or, if possible, get better. I know that serving as your Freshman Representative is the .best way to do this, and I hope I can have your vote. v 0 * * T E The Departments of History and English Present Tony Eprile \Crisis in South Mrica: A Literary View\ Thursday, November 8, 1990 8 p.m. Social Sciences 112 Mr. Eprile is the author of Temporary sojourner and other South Afri-can stories. 11 Tony Eprile evokes the ambiguities of his south African childhood with fascinatinCJ insight.\ -Nadine Gor4;}~mer

Page 8 CONCORDIENSIS, November 1, 1990 FEATURES Mohonk: The Perfect Escape By SUZANNE SHAKER Feature Editor Almost ever)one has experienced overwhelming desire to just get away, to escape the monotony, pressures, and commitments of everyday life. We all yearn for a change of scene. As seventh week of this term rolls in, and the work begins to pile up, many of us are probably craving that escape to relaxation and peacefulness. Although the plac.e that I recommend is a bit of a hike, it i~ well yvorth the trip. Mohonk . \ ' ......... . Mountain Resort is about 90 miles south of Union, located in the city of New Paltz. It takes about an hour and a half to reach. Mohonk, a healthful retreat, was founded by tne Smiley family and lies at the heart of the Shawangunk Mountains. Upon arriving at Mohonk one is immediately welcomed by the sensation of refreshingly clean, crisp, cool air. The grounds of Mohonk are lined with beautiful walking trains, which are off limits to motor vehicles, and signs on the auto roads read, ''Sto~vly and Quietly :Please.\ . .:_~ri nrin~ting people, you liberal Arts graduates You've learned how to distinguish between Ulysses (highly intelligent, but devious) and Hercules (full of drive, but no gray matter). You can appreciate the differences between George Washington and Benedict Arnold. You've cast an eye on the strengths and weak- nesses of Leo Tolstoy and Mark Twain. In short, you have a solid W1derstanding of Homo sapiens: You know what 'kind of animal he is, and whether he's likely to succeed or not. You know about square pegs in round holes. So why don't you join our management recruiting firm Under the guidance of our seasoned professionals, you will learn to recruit, interview and evaluate candidates, negotiate compensation and complete the placement process. The book says you've got to be extremely ambitious, highly motivated, enteYprising, assertive and articulate- with impressive interpersonal skills. Not too liberal Not too artsy.

The brochure describes Mohonk as an unspoiled resort; it is unique. Which indeed it is. The beautiful, well kept lawns convey an incredible sense of space and openness. The main mountain house hosts 276 guest rooms, and is filled with a half dozen parlors, 150 fireplaces, 200 balconies, and three relaxing verandas lined with simple wooden rockers.

The lake is absolutely breathtaking, surrounded by rocky cliffs and wooden footbridges and lined with windy paths. The resort also features gardens, a greenhouse, picnic areas, a museum, stables, sports facilities and the Sky Top tower, an observation point, which provides a panoramic view of the estate. In kel~:J:ng with the Smiley fawtly's traditional interests, Mohonk has maintained its nineteenth century character. It offers classical music concerts and -~· ..:kd.~ ,; ,_·./ ~-- ..,..

The costs to visit Mohonk for the day are five dollars during the week and seven dollars on weekends, but believe me the price is well worth the experience and the therapeutic benefits a day or even a few hours at Mohonk may produce.

CONCORDIENSIS, November I, 1990 Page 9 FEATURES Every 27 Minutes To Whom It May Concern: By LINDA WETTNER Boston Globe Courtesy of SADD My husband and I went to .a funeral a few weeks ago. The man we honored had not been ill. He was killed on a Sunday night while driving home. An oncoming car jumped the highway median and hit two other cars before smashing head-on into his. According to the newspaper, the offending driver, who was :returning from a wedding, told police she had two bottles of beer and two glasses of champagne. A wedding. Followed by a funeral. I wish she could have been there to see all the lives that her act has cJ;langed forever: the widow, the fJur children, the extended family, the hundreds of friends who sat listening to words that barely touched the depths of their grief. Strange to think that, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, this happens in America every 27 minutes. Somebody drinks. Somebody drives. Somebody dies. The day before the funeral, I had run into a longtime acquaintance while shopping. I was hobbling around with a broken leg, and he commented on my crutches. I asked if he had ever broken his leg. \Oh I have a long rod in one thigh,\ he said, \from an automobile accident I was in two weeks after I came back from Vietnam.\ \That's ironic. To leave a war zone and get injured,\ I teased him. \You're lucky it wasn't worse~\ \Well my wife was killed and so was the wife of the other driver,\ he said uncomfortably. Then he added, \We were hit hy a drunk.\ I've known this man for years, yet here was a chapter of his life he'd never mentioned. He said that he'd remained in the hospital 7 weeks, aware all that time that his wife was dead. It was bard to know what to say, for there are questions you can't ask in a casual conversatiort, like \How could you bear it'?\ or \What did you do about wanting revenge?\ I wish I knew the answers so that I could offer them to the woman who, overwhelmed by grief, could barely walk as she followed her husband's coffin from the syaagogue. At the high school where she teaches, my friend Lynn saw a movie in which the young male' narrator recounted how he'd killed someone while driving dmnk. \He said he didn't know bow he'd stand it if he'd killed someone he loved,\ Lynn told me. \That really bothered me. Isn't everyone someone that somebody loves?\ Every 27 minutes, who dies? A mother who will never comfort the child who needs her. A man whose contributions to his community would have made a difference. A wife whose husband cannot picture the future without her. Every 27 minutes, who dies? A son who involuntarily abandons his parents in their old age. A father who can never acknowledge his children's accom:plishments. A friend whose encouragement is gone forever. Every 27 minutes, who dies? A child who will never fulfill his promise. A bride-to- be who will never say her vows. Every 27 minutes. A void opens. Someone looks across the table at a vacant chair, climbs into an empty bed, feels the pain of no voice, no touch, no love. Every 27 minutes. A heart breaks. Someone's pain defies the soothing power of tranquilizers. Sleep offers no escape from the nightmare of awakening to the irreversibility of loss. Every 27 minutes. A dream ends. Someone's future goes blank. The :phone will not ring, the car will not pull into the driveway. Every 27 minutes. Somebody wants to run. Somebody wants to hide. Someone is left with hate. Somebody wants to die. And we permit this to go on. Every 27 minutes. By JENNIFER UNTERBERG To Whom It May Concern: As I sit in the library looking outside at the foliage and the inevitable coming of winter, I can't help but look forward to spring term. Yeah, right -- so I can sit in a library. that's so hot that the only thing I can hope for is weight loss. And of cowse we are not allowed to bring in drinks, so dehydration is the major concern instead of the exam on Friday. I really don't understand it -- air conditioning during the winter and heat in the spring. OK, Union, the joke's over. I realize I haven't mentioned it before, but I know libraries are supposed to make studying more comfortable, not torturous. Actually, I should thank Union for allowing me to procrastinate to the fullest.

What's even better is that I don't have to worry about the possible inclination to plagiarize, because there is absolutely nothing to copy.

Boy, is she lucky.\ Have you ever wondered why all the Xerox machines break during exam period? Or how about the fact that we are supposed to be quiet, yet the librarians let the phone ring about twenty times before they answer it and then they shout into the phone as if someone is calling them from Alaska asking if a book is in? Why is it that every time I walk into the library I starL hearing voices saying phrases like \sucker.\ OK, I am being rude -- I apologize. It is just that it is hard for me not to find our library humorous. Well I better continue studying; I only have a half hour left before closing and I need time to put on an extra layer of clothing.

Page 10 CONCORDIENSIS, November 1, 1990 FEATURES Memory lmproveme.nt: Implications for Memory Theqry By ALISA GASS On October 18 and 19 Union College hosted the second in a series of conferences sponsored by Union's Department of Psychology. The conference was entitled \Memory Improvement: Implications for Memory Theory.\ The conference was organized by D. Herrmann (NIMH), H. Weingartner (NIMH), A. Searlman (St. Lawrence U.), and . McEnvoy (U. of South Florida), and was coordinated by Professors Greenberg and Foley of Union College. To add to the list of participants, speakers included P. Hertel of Trinity, C. Hertzog of Georgia Tech., M. Pressley of U. Maryland, M. !mons-Peterson of U. Indiana, D. Best of Wake Forest U., D. Plude of U. Maryland, S. Ceci of Cornell, D. Payne of SUNY Binghamton, L. Hasher of Duke, and R. Zachs of Michigan State. A series of lectures was presented adrcssing the effects of different modes of memory \__..---- improvement: psychopharmacology, emotional state, me tam emory, strategies, practice, external aids, social interaction, context, and attention. According to Professor Foley, the lectures were generally good. The speakers presented their subject matter in such a way to reach all members of the audience. Foley claimed, \There is always a wide range in conferences such as this one. Obviously, some talks were more entenaining than others. On the whole, participants came away with the feeling that it was a well integrated conference.\ In terms of a turnout, a few Union College students attended. After all, it was a busy week of midterms. Of course, various Union faculty attended. In addition, thc:-c were a number of students from the \Pew Cluster.\ The Pew Foundation, another sponsor of this event, takes an interest in programs involving science. The Pew Foundation allows funding for students from their \satellite\ schools to attend and benefit from such. events. These \satellite\ schools include St. Lawrence, Barnard, Manhattan College, Colgate, Hamilton, and Cornell is the center of this organization. The conference was free of charge to senior citizens; therefore, quite a few concerned about their own memory loss, or that of those close to them, attended. The most interesting aspect of the conference is the fact that each speaker will contribute their particular lecture as a chapter to be published in text form. The book, probably entitled \Memory Improvement: Implications for Memory Theory,\ will be published by Springer-Verlag. Union College will be recognized for organit..mg and hosting the conference, where each chapter was presented- the \oral text.\ According to Professor Foley, psychology conferences will be held, hopefully, every two years.

Page 12 CONCORDIENSIS, November 1, 1990 INTERNATIONAL FEATURES ~.SJI Our Trip to See the Statue of Liberty (or going to NYC and Philadelphia) By KRISTIN LUPOLI it by pleading that we were international students and didn't know any better. Up on the roof, we learned it is really a small world because we ran into some other international students from Union. We then had a taste of fine American cuisine in a stylish South Street Seaport restaurant: fried fish and French fries in baskets and New York City water. From the mint we proceeded to South Street and saw many unusual shops and people. Andrey decided he wanted a mohawk like the man who walked by us. We went and had real Philadelphia cheese steaks: gooey, greasy and delicious. On the way back to our <Car, it began pouring. None of us had umbrellas, so we decided to make the best of it and got drenched. At home we ate chicken soup and banana splits. Dur,ing another unusual dinner conversation, we learned that the German word \kaput\ is universal. Having nothing exciting planned for the fall break, I decided to invite international students to my home in New Jersey. Sabine (Germany), Xavier (France); Vicki and Andrey (USSR) volunteered to join me. Saturday morning after a breakfast of chocolate chip cookies, we ran to the train station and waited almost three hours for our train. On the train, we ate pizza resembling styrofoam (or as Vicki calls it \chewing gum pizza\). We struggled with the pizza for a long time because all we had were knives and spoons. Vicki sums up the tri.p with, \Now I am really sure that the Soviet Union and the U.S. are the same-- trains are late, pizzas are chewy and there are no forks!\ The next day we returned to the city, went to Coney Island, and then to Brighton Beach to see where Russian immigrants live. Andrey bought Russian bread. Frcm there we planned to go to the Statue of Liberty but learned that they were no longer selling tickets. The ticket man told us too many people were on the island and if he sent any more it would sink. We then took the Staten lsland ferry to get a closer glimpse of the statue. While waiting, a man approached Xavier asking for change but we scared him off by saying, \Sorry he only has francs!\ Xavier, Andrey, Vicki, Kristin & Sabine The following day we :returned to Union by car. The drive back was uneventful except for a minute where we almost took the exit for Boston, planning never to return to Schenectady. We arrived at Union in time for a \delicious\ West dinner and regretfully realized that vve left Andrey's bread and the chicken soup at my house. Although some things went wrong, this weekend was perfect and one we will never forget. On the ferry boat, we had to fight a group of tourists for a choice picture taking spot. After the ferry, we spent the next few hours wandering the streets and saw Rockefeller's Plaza, Trump's · Plaza, Tiffany's, etc. We were constantly harassed by men selling genuine Rolex watches and we decided to return home. The following day we went to Philadelphia and spent a half hour trying to find parking. From there we went shopping and ate lunch in a \French\ bread and sandwich shop. Xavier was disappointed because the only thing that was French turned out to be the From Grand Central Station we all packed into my parents' car and went to the World Trad~ Center. We bought tickets and rode halfway up the tower in an elevator. While changing elevators, we met a friendly New York security guard who chased us up 78 floors in another elevator. She demanded that we go back down and wait an extra hour in line because we didn't get in the correct line. We managed to get · out of F. Y. I.

By ED MENKE In France (and maybe other countries as well), Halloween isn't exactly the fun .. loving, trick-or-treat holiday that we celebrate here in the U.S. In fact, \Toussaint\. as it is called, is an extremely religious holiday during which people have off from work and school. Practically the entire country of France shuts down during this couple-days-long religion-fest. The definition of \Toussaint\ is, according to my dictionary, either The Minority Affairs Committee cordially invites Students, Faculty and Staff to the MULTICULTURAL DINING TABLE ·~ table where all ethnic groups can engage their differences in a process of mutual enrichment\ College Center Fridays Cabaret Room 302 11 :30·1 :30 Meeting Friday, Nov. 2, 1990 Hosts: Twitty J.

If \pineapple sherbet\ is the correct translation, then maybe people take off from work to think about how gross the thought of pineapple sherbet really is. However, if \All Saints' Day\ is, in fact, the correct translation, then maybe that would kind of explain why this holiday is so important to French people. You have to figure that any holiday which involves paying homage to all the Saints who were ever Sainted must be serious. name of the shop. We went to Independence Hall and bought copies of the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, and the Bill of Rights. We took a tour of Independence Hall but the tour guide thought he was a kindergarten teacher, talked too fast, and was boring.

CONCORDIENSIS, November 1, 1990 Page 13 . ·uj:, .. ··' INTERNATIONAL FEATURES ' .. . Party All Over the World Greetings From Bath By JAIMIE LIPSHER Dy LARAE TUMlDAJEWICZ Everyone loves a good party. This is a universal statement around the world which gives rise to holidays-for what better purpose than to celebrate. Bavarians in Germany celebrate Oktoberfest with a lot of beer drinking. Each village in Germany also has its own celebration of the harvest. The people eat lots of specially prepared foods, cakes, and other goodies. drink coffee, and of course more beer. Then all the townspeople gather for German dancing. ·The \Great October Socialist Revolution\ is celebrated in the Soviet Union. It consists of three or four days of no work and no stndying (similar to our whole four years here at TO: Union). During this holiday everyone seems to do their own thing. Some sing revolutionary songs, a few walk around with red flags, and others go to the parades. Another group may choose to drink in jubilation and the less adventurous Russians, if there are any, just stay at home doing nothing. November 5th in England is known as Guy Fawkes Day. Guy Fawkes was a Catholic wllo lived in the 17th century in Britain. It was his radical decision to blowup the houses of' Parliament that made him famous. Nowadays, the British make stuffed dummies of Guy Fawkes and throw them into large bonfires on this night. The evening is also marked by excessive drinking. Americans of course celebrate Halloween.

Page 14 CONCORDlENSIS, November 1, 1990 <lliltlfllrbtrttsis -----FIJunded at Unimz College 1877------- A Report and Its Ramifications Why should we be concern.ed about where U.S. News & World Report ranks Union among the nation's liberal arts colleges? The reasons are many. Any published report about Union has a bearing on our lives and on the life of Union. College as an institution. The results of this particular repor.:. were disappointing. Any school is as much a product of what it is perceived to be as what it actually is. That is, we may think, or even think we know, that Union is a superb school and among the elite in the nation. Indeed, Union does have a great deal to offer. Besides, the results of the Report's study were not awful by any But in comparison to what is generally considered to be our competition, Union is slipping. And, though President Hun likes to present our school as unique and argues that we should not be paying so much attention to the other guys, it can not be denied that Union does have competition. Very few high school seniors apply to one school. There are always oilier colleges to be considered, and most people that are considering Union are also considering other small liberal arts colleges, mostly in the northeast. A high school senior who has never actually experienced a school has to go by word of mouth, and by published reports such as those by Barron's, Lisa Bimbach, and U.S. News & World Report. If a candidate is accepted into Union an.d a school ranked ahead of it, and has trouble choosing between the two, such a report might be the deciding factor. And if Union Joses an eminently qualified student, the whole school suffers. . The other side to the coin is the value of a Union degree Employf~rs may not pay the same close attention t~ these types of studies as high school students and gut dance counselors do, but sooner or later they will become generally awar~ of a college's standing. Graduate schools . are certainly .aware. Union and Hamilton College are often spoken i!l the same breath. Hamilton is ranked 19th. Union ts ranked somewhere between 26th and 35th. Hamilton accepts 38 percent of its applicants, Union 49 percent of its. 51 percen of Hamilton's freshman class come from the top 10 percen of their high school class, as compared with 45 percent of t t Union's. Union does compare favorably in other aspects, both in the survey and in ways that only we as membe~ of the community can know. We must figure out how to tmpres s those aspects upon the outside world.

CONCORDIENSIS, Novemf;er 1, 1990 Page 15 LETTERS We Care About Housing To the Editor: As a member of We Care About U, I feel it is my responsibility to address the administration's callousness toward the students of Union College, with respect to their decision to enforce the housing policy which requires all students through junior year to reside in on-campus housing. This policy seriuously affects the student body, yet the administation failed to give the students a voice in the decision to employ it In the past, due to the over- ·enrollment of classes, many students were forced to live off campus. Now, due to a series of administrative blunders, including the under-enrollment of the Class of 1994 by 70 students, the eviction of Delta Chi from Raymond House, and the failure of the administration to take advantage of the fact that Gamnui Phi Beta has nearly 60 sistrs prepared to fill a chapter house on campus, there are approximately 130 unfilled beds, beds which will be filled with unwilling students. It's adherently unjust for the administration to dictate policies which force students to bear the burden of their errors. without regard for those same students' needs. There are specific advantages to living off campus. Cooking facilities are immediately available whereas they're virtually unavailable to students living on campus. The cost of living is $200-$800 less than the $2448-$2766 campus housing costs, and in most cases, students have a great deal more personal space than their on-campus counterparts. _ A savvy student can eat as well off-campus, on $45- $60/week, as students can on- campus for the approximately $70/week it costs to be on the 10, 14, and 19-meal plans; without ever havinj!; to endure the 20 or 30-minute lunch lines, on Monday. Wednesday and Friday, in Skellar and Upper Class Dining. lf the student wishes to eat on campus he/she can at the Dutch Hollow and Skellar, and pay face value for food rather than the discounted rate of $4_75 meal card students get for a meal card .punch which can cost them more 1:han $6.00. Simply speaking, it's less expensive to live off\'campus. To equitably solve the housing problem the administration should entice students to move back on campus, not force them to. The renovation of Richmond, Raymond, Potter, and Hickock houses steps in the right direction, and the effort is commendable, but not sufficient or complete. Students choose to live off campus due to inadequacies in on-campus facilities. Inadequacies owing to an administration inattentive to the students' needs. If the administration must initially employ a short term solution to fill the empty beds, they must provide for the smoothest transition possible for the students. Sophomores currently living off campus, as well as members of fraternities and sororities without campus housing, should be permitted to choose between on- and off- campus housing. In addition, storage space should be provided, over summer recess, for those .,tudents returning to campus housing, in order to accommodate a year or two's accumulation of belongings. Perhaps with flexibility, the administration will be able to avoid further alienating the student body. Respectfully, Stephen R. Kennen '92 Let the Students Decide! To the Editor: I was both shocked and upset to read the front page article \Old Residential Policy Reinstated\ (Concordiensis, Oct. 18). Not only was I irritated that this policy would be put into effect starting next year (meaning that my class would be the frrst to be affected by this policy), but I was also furious that an administration that took away Delta Chi and Beta Theta Pi's housing in the past two years, in addition to denying housing to Gamma Phi Beta, would resort to restricting the present sophomore class as a whole to replace the groups that they chose to place off-campus. The logical solution would be to provide these organizations with on-campus housing and then calculate how many school-owned beds would be empty. Another answer might be to create a dormitory with upperclass residents only, thus providing a quieter, unique alternative to the present housing system. It seems to me that the new policy was created without really considering the needs or wants of the present student body-- which seems ironic, because they are the very individuals who the policy affects.

To the Editor: With the valid assumption (based on the content of the text) that \Not A Case of Discrimination\ printed in the October 25 issue of Coucordlensis (pg. 10), is the work of the editors of C o n c o r d i e n s i s , the membership of A.L.A.S. shall air its side of the story. We shall begin by clarifying the false assumptions of the editors. One: the article was submitted by Joe Kotright and Wanda Thomas. Although Joe Kotright is one of the co-chairs of A.L.A.S., aad Wanda Thomas is a member, let us not make the false assumption that two individuals automatically represent the entire membership of A.L.A.S. Under no circumstances did the membership of the African and Latino Alliance Of Students take any part in the writing or submitting of the article to Concordiensis. Two: Under no circumstances did the membership of A.L.A.S., through a representative, directly approach the editors or anyone associated with the Concordiensis with any threatening or non -threatening responses. Once again, the assumption was a mistake made by the editors, that one member of A.L.A.S. represents the entire group. The me~bership of A.L.A.S. would like to stress upon the fact that A.L.A.S. is based on a democratic structure, it does not function under a system of dictatorship, . or one of autocracy Representatives of A.L.A.S. are elected by the membership, and under the guidance of the A.L.A.S. membership, the individuals identify themselves along with their position, so that no false assumptions are made. From the clarification of these two false assumptions, we can arrive at two logical and valid conclusions: One, since the membership of A.L.A.S_ did not write· or submit the article, and since the \editors\ state that \ ... the authors bemoaned the autocracy displayed by the editors,\ then the membership of A.L.A.S. could not have done this. Two, sLice no representative of A.L.A.S. had directly approached anyone fro-m Conco.rdiensis, then A.L.A.S. could not have made any threatening promises as stated by the \editors\. Three, the editors assume that their .excuses for not printing the article are valid. They state that \The article by A.L.A.S. was unable to be considered because it was not in English ... In addition to our own difficulties associted with articles in other languages, our publisher would not be thrilled about having to typeset a foreign language.\ Let us remember .that the word difficulty, does not translate to unwillngness. Let us remember that it is n(:)t part of the job description of the editors of an unbiased, objective newspaper to be unwilling to provide its multi-cultUl'al readers with the news that pertains to them and their culture. Obviously, the bilingual students, and the modern language students find typesetting a foreign lnaguage worthwhile., since they make up part of the Union college community, A.L.A.S. also finds it worthwhile, and therefore extends its help to Concordiensis and its publisher to ease their \difficulties\. Let us also remember that it is not part of the job description of the editors to withhold infonnation from the pllblic, in this case, information regarding the fact that Joe ICotright did offer to have a translation of the Spanish article in English, yet, his article was still rejected. Four: it is not the case that A.L.A.S. claims that it is misunderstood, it is the case that A.L.A.S. reveals the false assumptions made concerning the group, and addresses the lack of knowledge and ex:posure that the college community has concerning A.L.A.S ., its multi-cultural membership, and the multi-cultural community that exists at Unie>n as a whole. A.L.A.S. wishes not to consider the college community as an \audience\ (as stated by the editors), but as what it is. the Union College community, a multi-cultural community, from which the club A.L.A.S. evolved. A.L.A.S. fully su:pports the efforts of Joe Kotright and Wanda Thomas to diversify the newspape1 in order to fit the needs of its m11lti-cultural readers-- such as the community of stude11ts who have participated in the promoted terms abroad program, the different language tables/ clubs, and. the community of students who are engaged in learning a modem language (such as Spanish). Th·e membership of ALA.S. realizes that the main issue is the diversification of Concordiensis to properly (fully) represent and fit the needs of Union's multi-cultural community. Because vve belive that a newspaper should reflect the make-up of the community it is repn·senting, and satisfy its intellectual needs, the A.L.A.S. membership fully supports the rigb.t for any stndent of any background to submit an article e11couraging multi-culturism, the usage of the diverse experiences in the terms abroad, the usage of the learnings of the modern language students, and satisfying the intellectual needs of a multi-cultural, multi- lingual Union. A.L.A.S. recognizes that the Concordiensis lias been and will continue to serve as a forum for the expression of its opinions and concerns. A.L.A.S., however, does see the need ~or CoRcordiensis to extend this invitation to its multi-cultural readers. Action Committee for A.L.A.S. I Have Fallen ... and Can't Get Any Help To the Editor: Recently a student living in a lower campus dorm was struck with a seizure. The following is a recreation of the response by emergency personnel compiled by approximately 10 students' accounts ... The student's roommate found this person in about 30 seconds. Following this, he called to the hall for help and then called security. It took approximately two minutes for security to respond. For the next seven minutes the security officers, roommate, and students waited. nervously and HELPLESSLY for the Schenectady Paramedics to arrive to start treatment. The Schenectady Paramedics arrived ... NINE MINUTES ... after the call for help was put in. (Though the Paramedics station was next to the college~ and Ellis Hospital is 30 seconds away, these two locations failed to provide any help for almost 10 minutes.) Outside ()f the dorm, there was a EMT in Fox South, just one minute away, and another student EMT by Humanities who CO\lld ·have helped if money were allocated for a first aid squad. Fortunately, the student was okay and everything worked out, but f()t the student and his roommates and floonnates, it was the scariest nine minutes till the ?aramedics and the necessary equipment arrived to help the student. In order to correct this problem in the future, there is an effott being made to set up a First Aid Squad. Though everyone supports it; no oue wants to come up with the $11,000 start-up cost. Though this sounds like a lot of money, wouldn't tltat money have made all the difference in the world when that student needed this First Aid Squad? Furthennore, once tile Squad is started, the continuing cost would on!y be approximately $3,000, a cost of only $1.50 per studem a year. Right now there are 34 people willing to participate in this squad. Half <Jf them are trained and ready to help. New York State has gien us the O.K., in additioll, Security. Health Services, and the student body has given us the approval to go ahead with this squad. All that we need is the money allocated to get going.

Union Joins Recycling World Undergraduate Scholarships Available in Environmental Restoration &y SETll FRIEDMAN The huge amount of garbage th:at people produce is obscene ami is the direct cause of huge la11d'fills. The most effective method in reducing ·garbage heaJJS is recycling. The popular environmental movement of the last few years has emphasized recycling in both the home and office to help alleviate the monumental Jlr()\>lems of acid rain, pollution of the air and water, ozone depletion, and global warming. People all over the world have begun a new life of recluction and reuse of materials. College campuses are leading the way. Union Co1 1 lege is no exception. Union's long overdue recycling program began October 29, 1 °QO, and will h()pefully continue for years to follow. The new plan involves the placement of recycling bins throughout campus for depositing recyclables. The first phase of the program includes the installation of several bins in the College Center. Each receptacle is designated for specific materials: newspapers, office paper, cans, and bottles have a temporary home in these bins until they are removed and recirculated into society as new products. After the College Center bins become successful, subsequent areas will receive receptacles. Academic buildings are the next to be included in the new program, and dormitories will follow. The instaHation ·Of all phases relies on student and faculty participation. The more cooperative the campus, the quicker the plan will achieve its goals. The goals are environmental awareness, good reduction habits, and conscientious actions. Thomas S. Smyth, the director of Campus Operations, along with the Recycling Committee, has been the driving force behind the new program. Smyth wrote in his campus memorandum, \This program is dynamic; it will grow as we become rnore familiar with the process of recycling.\ He made it very clear in his statement issued to campus, that the recyC-ling materials could easily be contaminated if wrong items were placed in the bins. He recommends that when in doubt, students should throw out any materials that could cause problems, for example, half full cans of soda, staples, envelopes, or food waste, so · the bins are not ruined. The role of the students and faculty is eJCtremely important for this new plan to be successful. Participation is essential. The ten feet that you must walk from your mailbox to the bins is far from a huge task and could easily be accomplished with a little effort. Also, it is very simple to place the newspapers and empty bottles that one might use while in the Cellege Center in the correct bin when leaving. Not only will you be helping a worthy cause, but your actions will be witnessed by your peers who will follow your lead. Good habits are contagious. Twenty-five scholarships are available for undergraduate students majoring in engineering and science disciplines. Sponsored by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) and administered by Oak Ridge Associated Universities, the scholarships are designated for those students interested in pursuing careers in environmental restoration or waste management {ER/EM). Applicants must be U.S. citizens and currently pursuing an Associate of Science or Bachelor of Science degree full time. The Environmental Restoration/Waste Manage- ment Scholarship Program includes full payment of tuition and fees at a DOE- approved institution, a $600 per month stipend, and a three month practicum assignment at a DOE facility engaged in environmental restoration and waste management. Selection is based on academic performance, recom- mendations, background, and a statement of career goals by the applicant. The competition is nationwide, although four-year insti,tutions and two-year institutions will compete in separate categories. Scholarship applications are being taken through Jan. 28, 1991, and awards will be announced in May 1991.

CONCORDIENSJS, November 1, 1990 Page 17 V\brth Saving. ENVIRONMENTAL Berkeley Students Campaign For Right to Fund Environinental Group Get With The Program By FRANZ LITZ This week, Campus Operations and the Recycling Committee instituted Stage One of the recycling program that will catch Union up with the rest of tile country hopefully by the end of the year. Yes, most other institutions of higher learning-- and a growing nliiilber of high schools-- already have programs and have had them for a number of years now. Yet, in Carnegie, where students were requested to begin placing \junk mail\ in the white recycling bins, the reaction was a mixed one. By DANA R. REIDY BERKELEY, CA _ In a campaign for campus democracy, University of California students are fighting a Board of Regents decision to cut off funding for a student environmental organization after students voted repeatedly in favor of the group. Leaders of the University of California Student Association (UCSA) are rallying students and lobbying the state Legislature to defend the voluntary student fee that has funded the California Public Interest Research Group (CALPIRG) since 1976. Every two to four years, students at Berkeley, Santa Cruz, Santa Barbara and Los Angeles have voted to assess themselves a $2 to $4 fee each semester to fund CALPIRG. The fee appears on the semester bills of aU students at the four campuses and may be waived by any student not wishing to support the group. Last April, administrators at UCLA invalidated a campus- wide ballot in which a majority of the sutdents voting favored the CALPIRG fee. Administrators stated before the vote that its Oli!tcome would not affect their decision. On September 21, the UC Board of Regents voted to remove the CALPIRG fee at the three remaining UC campuses. \Basically [the Board of Regents is saying that students can't make up their minds for themselves,\ says Aaron Woolfolk, a student senator at UC Berkeley. Woolfolk speculates that several board members oppose funding because they have ties to corporations that are subject to environmental regulations supported by CALPIRG campaigns. CALPIRG's board of directors is made up of students from member campuses. The group is a leader in the coalition sponsoring \Big Green\ a question on California's November ballot that would ban carcinogenic pesticides, phase out ozone- depleting chemicals and cut emissions of gases that contribute to global warming. Jan Klunder, a spokesperson for UCLA, says that UC President David Gardener and the chancellors of the individual campuses strongly support elimination of the waivable fee because they favor a system in which students could make individual donations to the group. Klunder says that the administration feels that the current system is a \sneaky funding measure\. Andy Shaw, a UCSA representative from Santa Cruz, points out that President Gardener and all the chancellors reviewed the waivable fee system three years ago, and gave it their approval. \Now suddenly. three years later, they have all these moral objections to it-- something fishy's going on.\ The introduction of the bins was made by way of small slips of paper with the inscription \Don't Throw This away!\ Students, upon readoing tbis, were directed by the slips to the bins awaiting their paper. Some students welcomed the opportunity and the convenience involved in the new system, while others found the idea somehow amusing, often times tossing the slips into the trash can. Others probably didn't read the slips at all, and missed the signs all over the College Center. The behavior of those wb.o for whatever reason did not make an effort to recycle their paper may be seen perhaps as an example of how difficult it is to change old habits. Maybe, though, it is an example of how out of touch Union students are with their \environment ... However popular outside of Union's gates, Recycling will need a push from within to make it a success. Ho\N to Keep your Horne and Workplace Fro111 Killing You Union has made it C()nvenient for students to renew important resources: office paper, newspaper, glass and aluminum. It is not necessary to be a self-proclaimed environmentalist to comply with the program. It has been made easy enough for everyone. Besides. before long, recycling will be mandatory in all communities of New York State. Presumably within the fust half of this decade, Schenectady sanitation workers will no longer collect garbage that is not separated. Get with it, U! Stop throwing away that paper! Stop tossingout those cans! Save that non-redeemable glass! Return your Concordiensis and New York Times to be recycled! It's as simple as a walk to the College Center. Recycling is the \In-Tbing\ to do. Even McDonalds is investigating and piloting a program of their own. Union students need to join the effort in full force. Not because everyone else is doing it, but because it makes sense. We've taken too much from the natural world around us. It is time to start conserving. By RON HARRIS There is probably no place where we feel quite as safe as in our own homes. Yet, because of the widespread use of dangerous chemicals which can get into a person's system and remain there, lodged in the fatty tissu~s of the body your home can be one of the more dangerous places to be. A 15-year study of Oregon housewives aged 16 to 64, for instance, found that they were twice as likely to die of cancer as working women were. This is believed to be because housewives are more often exposed to harmful chemicals in cleaning compounds such as petroleum distillates, benzene, chlorinated bydrocarbns and ammonia. Some of the worst household poisons, according to one Environmental Protection Agency scientist, include air fresheners, moth crystals, aerosol sprays and stored paints and solvents. In the mid-80s, a Consumer Product Saety Commission identified 150 different chemicals regularly found in the home that have been linked to cancer, mental abnormalities and birth defects. The report also warned that indoor pollution was worsening. The home is not the only The English Department is conducting a reappointment review_ of Professor Anne Scott. All members of the college community who are familiar with her teaching, scholarly activity, or college service are invited to submit their comments to Professor Peter Heinegg, Chairman, English Department. place where indoor pollution is killing people. The workplace can also be a danger to one's health, especially where chemicals are used in industry. One government-sponsored study found that at least 80,000 deaths a year in America are due to occupational exposure to cancer causing substances. The Environ men tal Protection Agency also estimates that 100,000 Americans die each year from job-related diseases. Many companies deceive their employees about what toxins are around and try to deny or cover up adverse health effects linked with them. Emplooyees who are concerned about dangers due to exposure to chemicals area advised to check independent sources of information such as environmental protection groups. Even in the increasingly common sealed office environment, there are risks. Some of the biggest problems here include fumes from photocopiers, formaldehyde out-gassing from drapes, carpets, and artificial wood furniture. There is also much controversy over the possible harmful effects of radiation from computer monitors. The most commonly reported symptoms of office pollution include stomach aches, nasal congestion and other respiratory conditions, headaches. fuzzy thinking, fatigue. nausea, and chest tightness. However. it is the long-term effectgs of toxins that should be of the most concern-- effects one might not be aware of for years while these poisons are built up in the system. \The human body is made up of certain exact chemicals and chemical compounds, and complex chemical processes go on continuously within it,\ write L. Ron Hubbard in his new best-seller, Clear Body Clear Mind, a book intended to give people techniques to personally survive better in our chemically polluted world. \Some substances, such as nutrients, air and water, are vital to the continuation of these processes and for maintaining the body's health. Some substances are relatively neutral when entered into the body, causing neither benefit nor damage. Toxic substances are those which upset the body's normal chemical balance, or interfere with its chemical processes. Some of them can wreak havoc, blocking or preventing vital body functions and making the body ill or even killing it.\ SHAPE THE CLASS OF 1995!!!!

Some of you may have encountered him already, a professor in t\e Arts Department here at Union College since 1987, who specializes in drawing and painting. Walter Hatke grew up in the mid-West and attended DePauw University in Indiana, majoring in art. Encouraged by his parents to become involved in the fine arts, his father, who is a commercial artist,. was his role model. Working closely with established artists, such as Alexander Calder, sculptor, and Jack Beal, painter, as their apprentices, he gained con- siderable firsthand experience in the world of art. Meeting many of their friends exposed him to the importance of seeing artists as real people. Artists go through many phases and their work changes much over the course of time. A 0 A L I R A C All 001 OW!\ !ITP'lD r· Theatre One must discover individually which stage he is suited for. Professor Hatke's work has encompassed many different areas of studio art, including abstract works, expressionism, films and sculptures. The subjects he focuses on now in realism are interiors, such as the one shown here, as well as architectural landscapes. He feels these are the most natural for him. Working mostly with oil on canvas, he also uses watercolors and enjoys drawing. When I asked which medium he enjoyed more, he expressed his preference for painting. If he gets stuck at a certain point in a painting, he will leave the work, and begin to draw; the two sometimes go together. The talent Walter Hatke possesses has not gone unrecognized.

A believer in the Liberal Arts education, Professor Hatke feels your background and exposure to many different subjects becomes the inspiration for your art work. The ideas and historical events you learn about settle in your mind, and are expressed creatively later on. Both the professor and the students can benefit from one another, Professor Hatke feels; each finds rewards and imparts knowledge. Knowing from personal experience, some of his own works have ideas stemming from the classroom. Being in the classroom seems to be a relief from the hard creative thinking and decision making one- must take on as an artist.

This artist led a very diverse and interesting life, for after completing studies in medicine, Raymond was drawn to a career in cubistic sculpture with a concentrationon essential forms. He was a leader .of this type of expression, as he was the first to combine the theories and ideas of cubism with architectural designs. This sculptor is the brother of artists Jaques Vi lion and Marce I Du.champ, a major force in the dada and surrealist movements.

Die Warzau like to pound on a metal trash can, then take a grinder to the bask'lfd, spreading sparks over a crowd. It explains the constant \It's in your body\ chorus in the song \Bodyhag\, with all of it<:: energy, on stage, you just have to move. The band supplies ample heatr.; for you to do so. with three- separate mixes to choose from. Compared to other industria 1 bands, Die Warzau rely on sounds over image. The same can't be said of Mussolini Headkick's 81 ood on the Flag. The album simply states \Play loud or don't play at alL\ This way their \screw subtlety\ outlook can be heard by more peop 1e. Good \Holy War\ offers the diplomatic verses to Islam; \I sec your Koran/covered in blood{fhc voice of suppression clearly understood.\ \Get Out\ blares with frustration -- Lies, obscenities/They fed this hate/It's time to do somcthilng before it's too late.\ Call it overbearing.

I Page 24 CONCORDIENSIS, November 1, 1990 <ttonrorbirnzis SPORTS Tragedy Mars Breeders' Cup; Mr. Nickerson, Shaker Knit, and Go for Wand Are Dead By MICHAEL EZRA The Breeders' Cup, usually horse racing's finest day, turned into the most tragic day of racing since the death of Ruffian in 1975. What promised to be a day of championship racing Saturday at New York's Belmont Park soon turned to an afternoon of heartbreak as popular sprinter, Mr. Nickerson, died of an apparent heart attack, and then, two races later, the death of racing's most popular filly, the beloved Go For Wand. The day of Breeders' Cup racing opened up with the $1 Million Sprint. Mr. Nickerson was racing down the backstretch when he reared his head violently and died where he fell, throwing his jockey, Chris Antley, who was hospitalized w1~~~ a broken right collarbone. Shaker Knit, a horse racing behind Mr. Nickerson, stumbled over the stricken hurse and suffered severe spinal trauma. His rear legs were paralyzed in the spill and he was humanely destroyed late Saturday night. Many at the track did not know about the horses' injuries until later in the day because the accident took place on the backstretch, out of view from most viewers. Nothing, though could possibly prepare racing fans for the tragedy that would ocme in the day's third race, the $1 Million Distaff. The Distaff, a race restricted to fillies and mares, was considered by most to be the race of the year. It pitted Bayakoa, last year's Distaff winner vs. Go For Wand, last year's Juvenile Filly Champion. Both horses dominated their divisions, Bayakoa was a sure bet to be named Champion Older Mare, while Go For Wand was to be unanimously named Three Year Old Filly of the Year. The race's buildup was intense. The showdown had more than just monetary implications. It pitted the brash, young, .East Coast superstar filly against the veteran, California speedball maFe. Both horses had impeccable credentials, and wiU surely be inducted into the sport's Hall of Fame one day. Bayakoa had lost only three times in the year, with two of the losses coming to colts, and one while coming off an injury. Go For Wand had a streak of wins more impressive than any other three year old, male or female, in a decade. Three of Go For Wand's last four starts were stakes record performances, including a world record performance in the Beldame. Both horses' best distance was a mile and an eighth, the length of the Distaff. It was a racing fan's dream. Betting was fierce and even, as the bettors made Go For Wand the 3-5 favorite, while Bayakoa was held at odds of 1- 1. The next closest horse, Colonial Waters, was far behind in the wagering at 15-1. Obviously, the fans expected a two-horse race, which is exactly what they got. Bayakoa broke quickly and got the early lead by a head, but Bayakoa grimly dug in and stayed close. The horses raced equally, neither giving an inch, opening seven lengths on the remaining horses. By the time the two headed into the stretch, they were .nine lengths ahead of the field. Although each was tiring, neither would give way. Bayakoa inched close, but Go For Wand stubbornly kept her head in front. The crowd braced for a dramatic finish when tragedy struck. Less than 100 yards from the finish line, Go For Wand took a bad step and shattered her ankle, she fell hard, throwing her jockey, Randy Romero, who, luckily, Run faster. Jump higher.

Bayakoa went on to win the race, but nobody's eyes were o:n the finish line, as everyone hoped that the champion filly was not seriously injured. Go For Wand got up, and showing her gigantic heart, tried to limp on three legs to the finish but was overcome, and collapsed just a few feet from the winner's cir.cle. It was apparent to track veterinarians that Go For Wand had snffered irreparable damage to her leg, and the filly was given a lethal injection on the track. The death of Go For Wand represents the greatest tragedy in horse racing since another three year old filly, Ruffian, died on the same Belmont track 15 yars ago. Words can't describe how special this filly was. To see her give her all in a thrilling stretch run was an ,indescribable feeling to racing fans everywhere.

A number of campus organizations, teams, departments and residence balls are sponsoring torch carriers at $35 each. Members of the sponsoring organizations may accompany their delegates on the torch run~ which will travel through the Union grounds. Torch carriers will receive commemorative pins and T • shirts. The run is expected to cover the campus between 11:30 a.m. and noon, arriving and departing at Payne Gate on Union Street.· The exact route through campus will depend on the number of runners. The torch also will be carried thro.ugh A ms terda m, Schenectady and Niskayuna on November 28. Participants are encouraged to wear clothing that will distinguish the college and the participating organizations. This is not a race, so conditioning and speed are irrelevant.

SPORTS Union Hockey Surrounded By Questions As Season Nears By ANDREW SEEWALD Editor-in-Chief The Union College hockey team will be looking for a more potent offense to lead the team to a level of consistency that it could not achieve last season. After reaching the ECAC finals an,d the NCAA playoffs two seasons ago, last year's edition of the Skating in order: That Campbell has achieved the statistics that he has is remarkable. He has not played on a line with the other stars of the team since his freshman year, when he tied for the team lead with 33 points. His sophomore season, Campbell piled up many of his 48 points on the power-play, which last year was ineffective, as Terry's point total dropped to 34 .. Dalton Menhall when n()t looking to set up Craig Ferrero .•. for his own shot, will try Dutchmen failed to win more than two games in a row until it reeled off wins in its final five contests before being bounced from the playoffs in the first rountl by Mercy hurst. Union finished with a record of 16-8-3. In a preseason game against the University of Connecticut last Saturday, the Dutchmen were lethargic and punchless for two periods, but then rallied and roared in the final session. The net result was a 4-4 come- from-behind tie that left as many questions as it answered. In the preseason, Campbell has been teamed with juniors Rick Clifford and Rick Burchill, who have career totals of 21 and 5 points, respectively. Helkie, who will share the goaltending chores with junior Shayne White, played admirably against UConn. He made some acrobatic saves, and Kinghorn says that Helkie is even better than he was. Head Coach Bruce Delventhal says that he prefers a two-goalie system. But the jury is still out on Helkie and White, ... who finished with 15 g()als last season. Would Terry Campbell, already sixth on the all-time Union scoring list, at last find peace, happiness, and wings who can score? Would sophomore goaltender Jim Helkie be able to flush the memory of Ron Kinghorn from the minds of the Dutchmen faithful? Would Bill Sedergren, the only player ever drafted by the National Hockey League to attend Union, be able to crack the lineup? Would a speedy, undersized group of freshmen forwards be the players to lead the Dutchmen back to prominence? Would Union's defensive corps overcome the untimely lapses that have plagued the team over the last few seasons? And would Byron Smith, a freshman defenseman who is sized more like a linebacker, someday leave a trail of limbs in his wake as he steamrolled over an opposing team? To take these questions, some more serious thao oth~~s •. because in three seasons of combined experience the tandem has been in net for a total of less than two games. Sedergren, a senior, was absent from Union's lineup against the Huskies. His work habits and his conditioning have been questions, but he has accounted for 60 points over three seasons, and was once known as one of the stars of the team. The freshmen forwards on the team accounted for three of the four Dutchmen goals against UConn. Jeff Jiampetti, who centered a 1.ine with classmate Wally Bzdell and junior BiJI Railton, had one of the goals. But the show belonged to Jayson Flowers, who played right wing on a line with Craig Ferrero and Dalton Menhall, both juniors. Flowers scored twice, including a wrap-around shot that wowed even a crowd that is used to Campbell's artistry. Continued on p. 25 Women's Soccer Falls ... And Can't Get Up By RON BIRNBAUM They did not win their last three games against Albany (2- 0), RPI (1-0), and Oneonta (6- 2). They did not make playoffs in the state toll!ney. They ended their season with a final record of 5-10, and they are bitter. Basically, after their victory against Wells College about four weeks ago, the players on the women's varsity soccer squad fell and could not get up. No, no, just kidding. Such a severe criticism at the end of the season would be unfounded and incorrect. The squad began its season bright, sweeping four out of its first six games, its 4th victory, a road win against Hamilton, being the high point of the season. This 6-1 trouncing was an unexpected win. Despite three respectable, well-played losses at home against Vassar, Skidmore and Middlebury, the lady Dutchmen were still playing strong at mid-season with a 4-5 record. Things turned downward following a victorious, but poorly played away game versus Wells College, and the team could not obtain the necessary wins against Williams. Plattsburgh (probably the seasonal low point), or its final three opponents for a bid for post- season play. Despite the end result, the talented squad played well together and put in plenty of effort to make this a very good season. As stated in the movie \Bull Durham,\ sometimes you win, sometimes you lose, and sometimes, sometimes (as with the drenched conditions of the Homecoming day Plattsburgh game) it rains. Against Albany, the windy weather gave one side of the field the advantage and Albany was very motivated as, most importantly, it has never lost to Union. However, the opponent had a coaching advantage in that the juniors and seniors, who comprised most of the team, had been coached two years back by Union head coach Suzanne Zaloom and felt the need to overpower the game. Albany scored once in each half for the final 2-0 scote though Union was able to outshoot them by a 2-1 ratio. In addition, the defense, which experienced some starter position shifts, played well Senior Terri Thomas took over for sophomore Megan Howell at sweeper, junior Wendy Wittner filled in for Thomas at outside back, and freshman Lara Greenberg sabbed in goal and covered very well. The game against RPI was another played on a windy day. While Uniqn was a better team and outshot RPI, 27-12, RPl's keeper had an excellent game and saved nine of Union's shots, the rest missing the target. Union was unable to make use of its scoring opportunities, and not swprisingly, most players have little recollection of this game. Expecting the game at Oneonta (wllich had a 10-3-1 record) to be challenging, the squad changed its usual 4-3-3 play combo to a 4-4-2 formation to make the midfield extremely defensive and offset Oneonta's power. Senior Meghan Carlin, who usually plays striker, was moved to sweeper also. This was successful in that it allowed junior forward Jen Holder to score w1thin the first 20 minutes of the first half. However, the enemy retorted with two more goals, one within the last minute of the half, and the half t~nded with a 2-1 score. In the second half, Union came back to tie the game and put it into overtime, during which the lady hooters were defeated. 6-2. Wrapping up, the team statistically did very well, scoring 25 goals and 17. assists, an all-time seasonal Men Is Soccer ... Continued from p. 28 Nosal returning, this team could soon be contender. Don't forget about the freshmen, either, who now have a good year .under their belts. Players like Tim Walsh, Dave Chodosch, Oleson, and Lee Popper could be the Haases and Reamans of the future. This is a team in transition. After 18 years, Coach Magee is stepping aside after putting the Dutchman soccer program on the map. Who his successor is hasn't been determined (probably a football coach). but whomever gets the nod has the gift of talent to work with, which Magee worked so hrd at molding into a fine squad. We at Concordiensis wish him all the best of luck, and hope his retirement lets him enjoy himself even more than record. Leading. the pack with seven goals and. three assists was junior fonvard Jen Holder, with sophom:ue defender Megan Howell ~ying. in assists. Eleven membe:rs, many of them starters, ha.d at least one assist each, despite not being able to attain its hoped-for .500 record, Union l(}st five games by a total of onJr one goal and won its victories by more than one. Looking back on the season, coach Zaloom b('rlieves there is little that could have been done to change the final record. Most members. on this year's squad had lacked previous experience in playing with one another, and t11ey got the opportunity to do so during this growing s.easson. The freshmen played a big part on the squad al()qg with the transfers, and the seniors provided essential leadership here. Senior midfielder Teresa Sanchez stated, \The upperclassmen were not used to this type of se~son and the freshmen helped. keep the morality going. Although Union's record doesn't show it, we had a very goCld team.\ The sophomores and juniors made up the majority ()f the team. This was one of the best teams Union has had. Everyone contributed to overall game play, and conside:ring that there are only a few graduating seniors (Meghan Carlin, Kathy Lawliss, Teresa Sanchez, and Terri. Thomas), the few lost play~rs will be replaced with members from this year's team. Senior goalie :Kathy Lawliss said, \Though we had a very skilled team, we just couldn't pull it together. Union's looking to do thi~ next season with a relatively young team.\ In addition to high hopes of rebuilding the sq11ad next year emphasizing teamwork, there is the possibilitr of founding an indoor women's soccer league this winter, though coach Zaloom do.es not plan to head it coaching at Uni()n did. Stay tuned for a season wrap- up next week, 'Where I'll be giving away variDilS prizes, and until then, I leav~ you with a quote from Jem Sollinger, who, in a bitter ~ge 'bumt' his own sign recently, \It doesn't matter if we will <>r lose, 'cause Union College will still drink the brews.\ Tha11k- you and God be with you alL Be An Athletic Supporter: Write For Sports This Winter .; . .-·- - .· ~ ~-· ... ~ .: ... · ...

Best Now Beginning to Men's X-Country Show for By GREG BARRETT This past weekend, the Men's Cross Country team traveled to Van Cortland Park in the Bronx to C()rnpete in the Collegiate Track Champ- ionships. The C()Ol, sunny, windless afterno()n was perfect for running. The field consisted of thirty-three ~teams from division one throagh division three. This course, known for its infamous cemetery hill, is renowned for its rolling hills and has sent many a runner to his grave. Every year. the qualifying race for the Kinney Nationals is held here. This course did. not hinder the Harriers. Greg Barrett was 113th overall and thirty-sixth for division three. He finished the five-mile course in 29:36 striding his way to his season's best. Rich Zernbek was next for Union knocking over eight minutes off his mark of last year. He was 138 overall and 43 for D-3 crossing in 30:50. Ed Dorsey was close behind posting his second best for the season. Dorsey was 144th overall and 44th for D-3 with a time of 31:04. Ed \Rhino\ Rothenberg carne in fourth for the Dutchmen in 31:32. He was 154th and 48th for D-3. Adam Reisman rounded out the squad in 32:00. Chris Ryan also put out his season best with a 34:24. Two weeks ago, the Harriers were at the Albany Invitational which is the biggest Invitational in the Northeast. It draws over 45 teams including Dartrnquth, Brandeis and Bates. The D11tchrnen ran six runners and came up with six Personal Records. They also chalked up another vicotry beating Hofstra. Their hard work and devotion is paying off as their best is now beginning to show. This Saturday, the Union Harriers host the state competition at Saratoga State Park This meet is always highly C()mpetitive and draws the top runners from New York State including nationally ranked University of Rochester and R.I.T.

LIONS, SAINTSJ FALCONS Last v\•'eek's V'l'inner: Jilvi POWERS - Mouthing OH Chump-ions of the Boxing World By ANDY BRAVER Sports Editor Last Thursday's 3rd round knockout of James 'Buster' • Douglas by Evander Holyfield made rn.e realize something that I have been avoiding for some time. I have finally come to the conclusion that boxing stinks -- it stinks from the heavyweights to the middleweights down to the light-super-under-welter-fly- unheavy-slim-fast-skin and bone weights, from the trainers to managrs to casino owners to promoters to boxing organizations to judges and even to the referees. It's not that there is a problem with the individual fighters. Personally, I liked both Douglas and Holyfield and I really couldn't have cared less who won. It doesn't even bother me that the fighters arc makiag such exorbitant amounts of money for such short bouts. If the public is willing to pay to see Douglas and Holyfield fight for the World Heavyweight Championship, the fighters deserve everything they get, even if the fight does last about seven ()r eight minutes. (There is a limit here however. Michael Spinks crossed it when lle lost in 91 seconds to Mike Tyson. How Spinks could take that $15 million or so in good faith is beyond my comprell.ension.) Anyway, the ever increasing stencil of the boxing world doesn't really emanate from the ring. That odor is different entirely. It comes from the politics and personalities that have turned boxing into a piece of week old cat food of the veal and cheese morsel variety. To I:Jegin with, the plethora of boxing organizations-- the WBC~ WBA, IBF, USBA, NABA, IBC, SUNY, FAT, SCUM, ABC, NBC, CBS, ESPN et al-- has made holding a title irrelevant. Practically everybC>dy and their mother, as well a::~ their mother's doorman, has a title of one kind or another. When you add to the 'alphai:Jet soup' a ridiculous and unnecessary amount of weight classes, the designation of champion is not only all too common, but it is confusing and an insult to the paying fans. What is the difference between the North America Boxing Association Super Flyweight Champion and the United State Boxing Association bantamweight Champion? The only difference I can see is three pounds and a green card . The numerous boxing organizations and weight classes are just part of the problem. Many fight judges pla)' too big a part in the outcome of a fight because they see some very odd things, namely three different fights. How is it possible for three 'experts' of the sport to see three totally different outcomes in one single fight? The referees also hold too much power in determining the outcome of a fight. Case in point - Meldrick Taylor's loss to Julio Cesar-Chavcz last spring. This fight was one of the bst of all time without a doubt, and it ended on such a controversial note. The fight featured two undefeated boxers battling for the same ti tie in some weight class (I can't keep track of such useless things). Taylor was ahead on points on all 3 judges' cards when he was knocked down by Chavez with about 10 seconds remaining in the final round. He got up and was a little bit shaky, but most fights continue with fighters in worse condition. So what docs the ref do? He stops the fight with 2 seconds left and Chavez wins a fight that will forever be marked with an asterisk. The promoters and casino owners are the people whom I believe have really ruined the creditability of boxing as a major sport in America. Overweight bums with overworked hair like Don King (yeah, I am sure that's his real name) spend more time in front of the , camera than their fighters do in the ring. I wonder how many boxing fans know what King's real job is. Then again, I don't know what it is. Does he even have a real job? There is so much more to say and I know I should, but there isn't enough space in this column and there aren't enough words in my vocabulary to describe how I really feel about the sport of boxing. All that I can say is that I am so glad that Mike Tyson is not in the news. Because when he is, it's not about how great a fighter he is. We hear about the foolish things he does to ruin the credibility of the sports that rescued him. One last thought on a slightly different topic. Sugar Ray Leonard was one of the greatest boxers pound for pound of all time. But as a TV announcer, I can't stand him. He knows boxing inside out, but he has a real problem relaying those thoughts to the audience because he can't enunciate what he says. When he talks, Sugar gets so excited that his words get jumbled together and it sounds as if he is either speaking in a foreign language, or his dinner is repeating on him at an alarming and dangerous rate. Be careful Ray. .. \\

Come out and chee:r Union on at the Union relays at 1:00 on Saturday. What A Long Strange Trip It Was By FRIEDS Well, the men's soccer season and an era drew to a close this past week on Garis Field. The Dutchmen, after dropping a pair of road losses to St. Lawrence and Clarkson, wrapped up tJ:te season with a defeat of Manhattan ville by the score of 2-0. While the Dutchmen did not play that well overall on the road trip, there were some bright spots. Like the return to the lineup of Paul Viviano, whose bitter contract dispute held him back for much of the season. Viviano's stellar play kept the squad close in the two matches. Another bright spot was team geologist Jed Nosal, who appears to be playing with leader-type confidence. Nosal was quick to point out why the Dutchmen dropped the Clarkson match-- \The field was on top of a clay deposit 8lld when it rained, the water C(}Uldn't drain. Clarkson had on their Bean Boots and we didn't.\ Great insight from a man known for his verbal staying power (S. Tucker, 1990). The Manhattanville contest in many ways was a microcosm of the season. The Dutchmen completely dominated the match, but were unable to convert even the best chances. In the first half, Manhattanville had the ball on the Union half only once or twice, but Union was only able to get one goal-- when Keith Ward knocked in a rebound from an Adam Epstein shot. In the second half, Union provided more of the same. Great scoring chances came from Epstein, Ward, Jem Sollinger, and Casey Kurz, but none found the net. Late in the half, Mark Oleson netted a cross from Tim Walsh, but the goal probably should have been the icing goal of a five- or six- goal effort. Hey, but a win's a good way to end the season. Playing in their last were four-year lettermen Brian Desmaris, Eric Reaman, and Dave Haas. Their contributions to the team throughout their careers at Union have built a foundation from which a new era of greatness can be born. With a nucleus of players like Joel Volterra, DJ. Hodson, Sollinger, Epstein, Eric Cressman, Dan Wilmot, and Continued on page 26 Crew Finishes Fall Season Successfully By CRISTYN HILLS and JULIE PATTISON The crew team finished its fali season on a positive note this pa~t weekend at the Head ot the Fish Rcgaua in Saratoga. The temperature was in the high 40s but that did not stop Union and many other local colleges from rowing hard. Each of Union's six crews had an excellent day, as they . competed against schools such , as Middlebury, SUNY Albany, Skidmore, Vassar, Williams, and University of Vennont just Lo name a few. The day began as the novice women's ere~ took sixth place out of eleven boats. The two novice men's boats soon followed, taking fourth and seventh places. All of the varsity crews made strong showings. The men's varsity four placrd second behind Williams. The women's varsity eight finished third behind SUNY Albany and University of Vermont. The men's varsity eight fmished the day by placing third in their race. All in all, Union's crew team had a very successful fall season. Everyone is looking forward to spring training and a great spring season. November 1, 1990 Union Escapes With Win Against Gettysburg 2-Point Con·version Falls in Final Second By ANDY BRAVER Sports Editor Those lucky enough to have one ticket to Union's football game against Gettysburg this past Saturday received a bonus as they were treated to two different games. Fortunately for the Dutchmem and their faithful, the great play in the first 'game' was just enough to lift Union past the Bullets, 28- 27. The outcome, however, was not decided until the final seconds as Gettysburg, who trailed 28-21, scored a touchdown with only eight seconds remaining. Gettysburg coach Barry Streeter, whose team had battled back from a 14-point deficit, did not want the game to end in a tie, so he had his team go for what would have been the game-winning 2- point conversion, which was knocked away by Union's Eric Tyron in the end zone. When the gun sounded at the end of the fourth quart~r, it was difficult to tell which team had won. Because of Union's collapse after a dominant first half, coach AI Bagnoli and his team skipped their ritual gathering and cheer in the center of the field after a victory, as this was a win that. without a little luck, whould have been an embarrassing and devasting loss for the Dutchmen. In the first half, Union, now 6-1. piled up 302 yards of total offense as it scored on its first three possessions, combining a strong running game and effective passing game, and led, 21-7 at halftime. Junior tailback Vladimir Tclcmaque rushed for three touchdowns and 89 yards in the first 30 minutes, while fellow junior, quarterback Brett Russ, shook off the effects of a hamstring injury to complete 13 of 16 passes for 156 yards. Union's first touchdown drive, which saw the Dutchmen move 81 yards in nine plays, 51 of them corning on four Russ completions, was capped off by Telemaque, who ran the ball in untouched from 14 yards out. The Bullets bounced back quickly against a Union defense that was favoring the run. Quarterback Gary Ricci completed three passes for 71 yards on the drive~ and after a 5-yard sweep. the game was tied. Three minutes later, Union regained the lead as Telemaque took a pitch from Russ and scampered 42 yards for the touchdown. Mter recovering a Gettysburg fumble on their own 44-yard line, Union then rumbled down the field again. Telemaque scored his third TD of the afternoon from 17 yards out, and for the third time he made it in untouched. Union could t~ave put the game away with a score on its other two possessions of the first half, but they fumbled twice, keeping visitors' hopes alive. The second Union fumble foiled a great opportunity, as it occurred on first down from the Gettysburg 14-yard line with under three minutes remaining in the second quarter. In the second half, Union came out flat. Gettysburg took complete advantage and began to dominate the game on both sides of the ball. On their second drive of the half, the Bullets scored on a 27-yard run by quarterback Ricci. Union regrouped for one drive early in the fourth quarter and scored to increase their lead to a two-touchdown margin. Russ completed furee passes on the drive for 48 yards, the big play coming on a 24-yard pass to Eugene Ray. Alex Felipe ran the final six yards for the score, and with just over 12 minutes left, Union led, 28-14. On their subsequent drive, Gettysburg totally surprised the Dutchmen defense as well as the crowd. On fourth and one from their own 29-yard line, the Bullets went against convention and threw long, completing a 31-yard pass. Union received a reprieve later in the drive, though, when Bryan Faria recovered a fumble five yards from the Union end zone. Soon after, Russ was intercepted on the Union 32, and eight plays later, the Dutchmen's lead was only 7, with 2:53 left. Union recovered the onside kick but couldn't move the ball. They punted to Gettysburg, who got the ball back on their 12 with 1:35 remaining. Mter surrending several short passes, the Dutchmen defense was beaten by a 37 -yard pass over the mi<idle. Gettysburg's Steve Barley caught the ball at the Union five, and hulled his way into the end zone for the score, pulling his team to within one point, 28-27, with nine seconds remaining. On the two-point conversion, the Gettysburg receiver fell in the end zone and Union's Tyron came up with the game saving defensive play. On the day, Telemaque ran for 123 yards on 13 carries, while Felipe gained 82, also carrying 13 times. Russ finished completing 23 of 31 passes for 275 yards. Brian Bowers led the team with six catches for 76 yards, while Aaron Root caught five balls for 61 yards and Mark Callahan made four grabs for 31 yards. The Dutchmen remain on the outside looking in for a possible playoff birth. The NCAA ranks six teams in each of four geographical regions, with the top four in each region making the playoffs. Union received another Honorable Mention this week in the Eastern Region. Union travels to Norwich on Saturday at 1:00 p.m. Support Union Sports

The faculty and the President met on Tuesday and what they discussed were fraternities, their role in the social life of the College, and residences in general. Addressed in particular were the recommendations made by the recently issued Middle States Report. The meeting spawne[J a committee made up of foUI students, four faculty members and two staff members that will make a recommendation to President Roger H. Hull later in the academic year. The Middle States Report was debated partially because of the widespread consequences that the implementation of its recommendations would have. Said one faculty leader, a professor in the social sciences, \People realized the potential radical nature of the recommendations.\ During the meeting, some faculty members spoke out against fraternities and some spoke in favor, while the president avoided taking a stance. \There are a lot of faculty members who would like to eradicate fraternities,\ said the social sciences professor of his peers. \There's also a large number of faculty members who would like fraternities to stay, perhaps in a different role. What the campus needs is more options in the social aspects of the campus.\ \My position is that I'm not taking a position,\ Mr. Hull said during a telephone interview. \I'm not anti- fraternity, I'm simply pro- student.\ \If we can find a way to accommodate everyone's interest, we will. The trend in the Northeast is for everyone to get rid of fraternities,\ said Mr. Hull, who then reiterated his pro-student, non-anti-fraternity position. The feeling among some of the faculty was that the most important issue was not whether fraternities should or should not be at Union, but that they should not be the sole sources of campus social life. \There's a large number of faculty members who would like fraternities to stay, perhaps in a different role,\ said the social sciences professor. Continued on page 3 Ed Bradley Lectures On Broadcast J oumalism By SREEDHAR SAMUDRALA On Friday, November 2, Union College and the Speakers Forum hosted Ed Bradley, the co-editor of '60 Minutes' and a CBS News correspondent. Bradley was scheduled to speak at Parents' Weekend last year, but the measle epidemic on campus postponed his visit. His talk was entitled \60 Minutes With Ed Bradley.\ He discussed his experience working with '60 Minutes' from the people he met, to the places he visited. Although only forty-nine years old, Bradley has had a successful career in broadcast jo11rnalism with many notable achievements. Bradley earned his degree in education and went on to teach four years of Bradley said, \covering the White H()nse was the worst job I ever had.\ He compared it ~B the day- to-day routine b.e bad as a teacher. elementary sch()ol. He then made a major career move and spent the next eight years on the radio in broadcast journalism. In 1971, Bradley joined the CBS News team. Over his years working with CBS News, Eradley earned three Emmys for excellence in journalism and the coveted George Polk ltward for his coverage of tile Cambodian refugees story. By 1976, Bradley was the CBS News White House Correspondent and the anchor of 'The CBS Sunday Night News.' Bradley said, \Covering the White House was the worst job I ever had.\ He compared it to the day-to-day routine he had as a teacher. Bradley was intrigued by the action and excitement of on-site television journalism. While discussing the military buildup in the Persian Gulf, Bradley said, \This could be a long drawn out encounter.\ Finally in 1981, Bradley found his niche in broadcast journalism when he joined 60 Minutes. \60 Minutes allows me to go anywhere all the time,\ commented Bradley. However he says that the constant traveling does wear him down. In the last week alone, Bradley has literally traveled across the United States and around the globe from Arizona to London, England working for Sixty Minutes. His job keeps him occupied eleven months of the year, and he spends little time at home. Although he says \60 Minutes is the best job in broadcast journalism,\ Bradley, as a public figure, must make many sacrifices. He said, \Sometimes it feels I don't have a personal life.\ Bradley discussed a wide Continued on page 3 . ;.· ::· :.

CONCORDIENSJS, November 8, i990 <ttnnrorbirnsis NEWS ANALYSIS Bush's Midterm Report Card Arrives By JIM POLITES The election held nationwide on Tuesday, November 6 marks the halfway point of George Bush's term as President of the United States. This presents a perfect opportunity to evaluate the chief executive's multiple successes and disturbing disappointments he has encountered in leading our country over the past two years. In the spirit of a traditional mid-term grading policy, the legislation, foreign and domestic relations, and overall Bush's b.andling of the Persian Gulf crisis to this point bas been flawless. He spoke firmly against Saddam Hussein, reinforced his threats with rapid military deployment and in the process gained widespread world support. progress (or retraction) that has accompanied Bush as the American leader will be examined and assessed a letter grade ranging from A to F. The following marks are in essence a microcosm of the President's effectiveness in bettering the nation and public as a whole, while at the same time maintaining and strengthening our universal title as world kingpin. The first topic of evaluation deals with the chief executive's strong point: foreign policy. Bush seems to regard the challenge of elevating the UBited States on the world scene as a task of utmost importance, and vigorously welcomes any invitation to decide on international matters of s1:1bstance. He has continued progressive and illuminating talks with the Soviets, and has both countries moving towards disarmament and a safer globe in which the U.S. and U.S.S.R. interact to promote an interdependent network of friendly relations between all nations. Bush's handling of the Persian Gulf crisis to this point has been flawless. He spoke firnly against Saddam Hussein, reinforced his threats with rapid military deployment, and in the process gained widespread world support. Thus far, George Bush has proven beyond a doubt that he is capable of representing the United States on a global scope; the nationalism he has successfully drawn from the American people is proof of his foreign success and earns him lofty marks in this area. Excellent initiative, solid execution. GRADE: A minus. The next subjeq of examination relates to Bush's fortune at home, where uncertain domestic policy and Congressbnal bickering have contributed to a substantial drop in the President's approval rating. The budget debate absorbed a:ny remanants of Democratic}Republican cohe- sion on Capitol Hill and squashed the positive working expense of long standing social welfare problems such as homelessness and illiteracy-- topics that have been talked about but progress has been slow. Bush's focus has strayed during his time in office and an originally defined set of agenda goals have become unclear. Questionable organization, George. Before ·conquering the world, keep an eye on a settled homestead, then branch out. GRADE: B minus. image with the public. The sign of a good politician is knowing how to adjust and compromise in potentially volatile .situations. Bush has done this well, for there have been plenty of recent uprisings for him to confront. Careful, George, it might not always 'be so easy to smooth out trouble. GRADE: B. Overall, the first half of George Bush's term can be evaluated in three general areas: effectiveness, .effort, and execution. The President's desire to succeed has never been in doubt, but his policies must reach a broader range of Amerians in order to gain vast I . ! popular appeal. A grade of 'B' seems most appropriate for a job done well but with room for improvement.

CONCORDIENSIS, November 8, 1990 Page 3 Forum Elections Complete Residential, Social ·Life Under Evaluation Changes In Constitution Next On Agenda Continued from page 1 \What the campus needs is mote options in the social members expressed that while the Middle States report addressed fraternities, the new committee will be faced with a much broader task. The faculty realize that the social life at the College is intertwined with fraternities, and that will be something that will have to be addressed By JAY FREELAND News Editor Last Friday, the Union College Student Forum beld · elections for three freshman representative ,positions, one sophomore position, and one · junior position. According to one Forum member, the 43% voter turnout for the freshman class was ''fairly strong.'' For reprc:sentative positions, the determination of the positions of president, vice- president and treasurer are coordinated with the first, second, and third place vote getters, respectively. Winning the position of president for the freshmen was Keith Meier. Vice-president is Blaine Langberg, and treasurer is Mia Caetano. All three were activated immediately as Student Forum representatives. The president justified his neutrality by explaining that he did not want to dictate the policy path that the school would take. \I'm lilOt goinJ to prejudice my position by making comment about aBything that \I'm not anti-fraternity. I'm pro-student.\ -President Hull was said. My goal is to chart a course between Scylla and Charybdes,\ Mr. Hull said, .referring to the two equally h.azardous alternatives in the waters of Greek mythology. \I didn't view today as bemg anything more than bringing tl!e faculty up on the Middle States Report. The report was one which focused on an issue in which people put a lot of work,\ said Mr. Hull. \My perception, 11 said the social sciences professor, \was that there was a general consensus in favor of the report.\ One faculty member, a humanities professor, suggested that one of the reasons that fraternity parties with beer dominate the social life on campus is because the fraternities hold residence in many of the prime locations on campus. If a non-Greek organization wanted to have a social event, he said, it would probably have to take place in the College Center. If the organization wanted to have any alcohol at tbe gathering, it would not be possible. To be considered, then, is whether the current residential arrangements will continue into the future. Some faculty members believed that Mr. Hull was not against fraternities as much as he should be, while others believed differently. The sophomore class position was filled by Lara Chamberlain. Lara's election was the result of a unique situation. She will be replacing Karen Hurwitz on the Forum, but not officially until spring term when Ms. Hurwitz leaves for her term abroad. Until that time, Ms. Chamberlain will sit in and participate at all Student Forum meetings, but will not have a vote until the spring. \The issue is one that is . really going to come out in \I thiBk it's fair to say that he (President Hull) wanted to slow the process down,\ the social science~ professor said of implemetation of the Middle States recommendations. · Winter term. The real discussion will take place (then),\ said Mr. Hull. Mike Rolnick filled the last Forum position by being elected representative of the junior class. Last spring's Student Forum elections yielded only two representative winners, thus leaving a vacancy for the frrst part of this term. All five of the newly elected representatives stepped in at last Monday's Forum meeting. Also presented at th~ elections tables last Friday were petitions for changes t<> the Student Government Association Constitution. These changes require approximately 1,200 signatures to take effect. All Forum members will be out this week with petitions looking for support. Any students who are . approached are urged by tbe Forum to look through tlte proposed changes and sign the petition so they may take effect as soon as possible.

That will be when the newly formed committee will have held open hearings and closed discussions about Union's residential and social life. The committee was designed as it is in order to give a broadly based and evenly balanced representation of the community. There are an equal number of males and females. Among the student committee members there are two Greeks and two non-Greeks. President Hull outlined the purpose of the committee. \The committee is to endorse all or part of the (Middle States) committee report or to modify it any way that it sees fit,\ he said \I'm going to wait to see if it makes any recommendations. II Accordingly, several faculty Said the president, \The fact is that the majority of the students are non-Greek.\ Another committee has been formed to make a recommendation on how best to use Maxcy House, the former residence of Beta Theta Pi. That committee is composed with a similar balance as the more general committee. President Hull is clearly proud of the fact that he has not issued any decrees to the College, and has instead chosen to let the students, faculty, and administrators have input into the major decisions. \I could have sat back and done whatever the (Middle States) committee felt was appropriate,\ he said. Minors Could Be Offered in 1991-92 Continued from page 1 Major program and the effect that it will have on the distribution of majors. If the survey results prove true, two- thirds of the ID majors in the Arts Department would become minors, a loss of roughly 50% of the majors. Four departments would lose 50% of all majors, while three other departments would lose 20% of their majors. Much of this change comes from elimination of the \double-counting\ of majors, as some IDs switch to major/minor patterns. If this proposal is approved, departments will draft minor programs this winter, and approve or disapprove them early in the spring in time for 'the 1991-1992 catalogue.

The 27 children were each assigned a sister for the day, which began by attending the October 27 Union football game. Mterwards, a pumpkin hunt was set up in Jackson's Gardens. Two kids and their sisters made up a team and each team had ten minutes to find 30 pumpkins, 20 of which had key words written on the bottom, such as Ninja Turtle, and prize~ awaited the team who found the most words. Following the hunt, refreshments were served and every youngster was able to take a pumpkin home. Vikki Hutchinson, Delta Gamma's foundation chair, organized the day, working in conjunction with J.D. Wood, director of The Schenectady Boys' and Girls Club. He thought that a Greek organization eager to be involved from Union was terrific; especially, since he believed that the sisters' age group has an important influence on the kids. Vikki believes, \It's important to reach out wherever help is needed,\ and further comments, \Since many of the children come from single parent homes, it was rewarding to reach out to these underprivileged children and give them some extra attention.\ Because of the sense of friendship felt that day, Delta Gamma is planning on continuing its relationshp with the club on a regular basis. The club's director has even expressed an interest in having sisters come down to the Craig Street office to visit the kids. The day turned out to be a great success for the children and the &isters. The weather was beautiful, the sisters learned some dancing steps, and the youngsters were able to celebrate Halloween in a special way. Ed Bradley Lectures At Union Continued from page 1 range of past and future '60 MINU1ES' stories from the crisis in the Gulf to the effect of the alar scare on the apple industry. 60 MINU1ES' aired a story revealing the Natural Resources Defense Council's findings which said that alar, which was used to regulate growth of apples, was found to be carcinogenic. The media's coverage on alar devastated the apple industry. Schools across the nation were removing apples from their menus. Bradley said, \After the story, the apple industry went to war on the N.R.D.C. and on 60 MINUTES.\ 60 MINUTES decided to air another episode on 'alar' revealing the counter- allegations supporting alar. With new evidence, 60 MINUTES found that only if someone ate 28,000 pounds of apples everyday for 20 years, he could get cancer The alar scare was over. While discussing the military buildup in the Persian Gulf. Bradley said, \This could be a long drawn out encounter.\ His view on Iraq's military dictator is, \Saddam Hussein is a man who ordered a purge of his top officers and did many executions himself. He also used chemical weapons on i Iraq's Kurds and on Iranians. It will be obvious that we can't bring Iraq to its knees in a few months.\ Bradley was asked why we tolerated Noriega for so many years when we reacted so quickly to Iraq's invasion of Panama. He answered saying, \The difference in Iraq taking over Kuwait is oil!\ Last week Bradley and CBS were gearing up for the coming state and national elections. Bradley had to miss his reception following his lecture because he had to catch a night for New York. Bradley had to attend the CBS election day rehearsals later that evening. He is concerned about the deteriorating integrity of our democmtic system. Bradley said, \In next week's election, fewer than one-fifth of the voting age population will pick the winner. We don't seem to care about the democracy we have, and if we continue this way someday it (our government) will not care.\ When asked about the evening's lecture, Dan Keniry, chairman of the Speakers Forum, said, \The Speakers Forum was delighted at the student turnout for this lecture. Ed Baradley was articulate, knowledgable and the students responded very positively.\ The Speakers' Forum paid Bradley $15,000 for his lecture. Kcniry said, \It is important to realize that Bradley was scheduled for Parents' Weekend last year which was a major campus event. Under normal circumstances the Speakers' Forum would not spend this amount of money without a major occasion.\ Because of the high costs of guest lecturers, the Speakers' Forum is trying to generate debates on campus in which students can particiapte. On November 15, the Speakers' Forum will he sponsoring their next discussion. The topic is \Should Congress Fund Obscene Art?'

CONCORDIENSIS, November 8, 1990 Page 5 FEATURES Union? A Bad Trip? By CARL R. FRIEDRICH, JR. \It suddenly occured to me that I had stupidly forgotten to adjust my alarm clock to the weekend mode of post-noon arousal Before opening my eyes, I thought about all of the two, three, and four a.m. promises of the night before, a few m<Jre regrettable than the others. Then it hit me-- I wasn't at home at all, and worse, I was on a floor. As things came nto focus, I remembered where I was-- on a road ttip.\ Thinking back, it had been a great idea on Friday afternoon, as we faced yet another weekend of unfuJfilled opportunity. We had all agreed that we definitely needed a shave, beer, and a change <Jf location. You see, and not for lack of trying, Union had become (dare I say?) passe. Sure, there was this and that, but the sense of adventure had somehow vanishdt. \I looked up, and saw a newly found friend on the couch next to the floor on which I was sprawled. 'Morning,' he said thru one open eye and vinegar-chip breath. 'Where's the bathroom, amigo?' was all I could get out, due to the taste of dried plaster in my throat. I did rise, making sure I removed my feet from the proprietor's pet ferret's litter box, and wondered how my friend managed to sleep so soundly, sitting upright in a chair.\ Now, while the road trips may be lots of fun, fun, fun, they do, for some reason, help you gain a greater appreciation of what we have at good 'ol U- The Coffeehouse By THE· COFFEEHOUSE COMMITTEE From the number of students and faculty who freque~t Coffeehouse, it can be assumed that it is a relatively unknown social altemative. Perhaps this is so because most people don't have an idea about what Coffeehouse is like. First, Coffeehouse is more than a time or a place; it is an event. It takes place im Room 302 of the College Center every other Friday from 7:30 p.m. to 10:00 p.m. However, it must be noted, the Coffeehouse scheduled for Friday, November 9, will be held from 9 p.m. to 11 p.m. The booths and tables, the herbal teas and gourmet coffees priced at fifty cents and seventy-five cents, respectively, and the live performances all help to create an atmosphere for students and faculty to meet and talk. So far, the professional duo \Atlantic Bridge\ appeared laSt month for the first Coffeehouse of the school year, and Max Heinegg gave a poetry reading that evening as well. And at the last Coffeehouse, students provided vocals and guitar music, and, later, new age piano music. Although some sort of live performance will always be part of Coffeehouse, organizers of the bi-weekly activity have several ideas for additional entertainment. They are: donn nights, in which all residents of a dorm will be invited; faculty department nights, when professors will be honored with their colleages; and theme nights, when a particular group on campus will serve as hosts, rather than guests. The Coffeehouse scheduled for tomorrow will be such an event. It will be hosted by students in Shakti, the new South Asian students' group.

The letters stand for \What Can I Do With A Major in .. . \ and the program is designed to assist Union students in identifying their career options and g<Jals. Each term, the CDC will work with a particular academic department to create a presentation which is interesting and informative for liberal arts students. on· November 12, the Career Development Center and Philosophy Department will co-host the first of the WCIDW AMI presentations: \What Can I Do With A Major in Philosophy?\ An alumni panel of four Union philosophy majors will address such topics as: why they chose philosophy as their major; how they made career choice decisions; how they conducted the job search; and how they made decisions about graduate school. The panel will also discuss present and past career positions, strategies, mistakes, regrets, future career possibilities, and advice to students. The presentation is not for philosophy majors only, Undecided students, philosophy majors. and inquiring minds are welcome.

Page 6 CONCORDIENSIS, Nov:ember 8, 1990 FEATURES Latin AIDerican Studies At Union By LARISSA LUCAS Did you know that you can major in Latin American Studies? There are six of us now-- four will graduate. The major is interdisciplinary, which sounds scary but it's not. You are not restricted to only one department; you can take courses in history, political science, sociology, economiccs, and, of course, modern languages. You particpate in a terms abroad program to Mexico or Brazil, and write or defend your senior thesis in Spanish or Portuguese. So, if you love foreign languages, and the thrill of being abroad and are fascinated by Latin America's growth and diverse politics, this is the major for you. I circulated a questionnaire in some classes to find out student interest in International Affairs. Among these were Contemporary International Politics to History of Latin American Women, Economics of Growth and Development. Overwhelmingly, out of the 90 people who took the survey, only 22 did not speak a foreign language, yet 25 spoke more than one foreign language. The majority of majors .represented were Economtcs, Political Science. and Interdepartmental (Modem Language major being high withm that category'. Spanish and French had the highest representation but the languages ranged from German and Portuguese to Hindu and Tai. I also asked if students would be interested if more classes were offered on Latin America and, to my satisfaction, an overwhelming majority said yes. The course, which dealt the least with Latin America, being noted on the questionnaire by students circling \none\ or \minority\, was Contemporary Internation- al Politics. This is understandable to a point because of the publicity in the Gulf, but as an inrroductory course it should deal with a variety of issues to introduce primarily first term, first year men and women to areas of the world that they do not see on the evening news. The Economics course and the Sociology course, both deal with development issues, which were reported to have \average\ to \majority\ of the material on Latin America. Currently, there are senior theses being written on Latin America, four within the major and some outside. Larissa Lucas is writing on the informal sector in Brazil and has received IEF funding to return there for research. Ted Erickson is writing on internal and international Dominican migration. Kelly McGowan is writing ahoul Ll.S. intervention in Panama. Carl Dickson is writing about agrarian reform in Hondaras and Nicaragua, and Michele Martin, an Economics/Political Science major is writing about debt rstructuring in Mexico. On international issues, Mike DuFault, an EcmlOmics/Psychology major, is writing on economic development in Thailand since the 1950s, Jay Freeland, an Economics major, is writing on power generation marketing in the People's Republic of China, and a Political Science major surveyed is writing about over-population in the Third World. There are diverse interests in International Studies here at Union; you should get involved and discover your many options. You can start next term. Professor Meade is teaching History of Colonial Latin America, Professor Toscano is teaching Introduction to Latin American Theater, and Professor Moyano is teaching Voices of Hispanic Women. In the spring, there will be even more!! If you are interested in attending an information session or being on the mailing list, please contact Prof. Nichols in Political Science, Prof. Meade in History, Prof. Huggins in Sociology, or Prof. Moyano in Modern Languages.

Scientists at various research centers have discovered ways to turn plastic foam cups, burger containers and other plastic items into wood substitutes which can be used to build decks, picnic tables, and fences, among other things. Plastic recycling plants are appearing across the nation and environmentalists hope that consumer'; will realize that although 1he new degradable plastics are not an answer to the solid waste problem, by recycling we can avoid the further increase of the problem. We, as individuals, can help improve the plastic problem in several ways. First of all, whenever possible, avoid using products made of plastic by choosing alternative products. For example, use paper cups and paper grocery bags instead of th,eir plastic counterparts. Also, when you must use an item made of plastic, make sure that it is disposed of so as to be recycled, or when that is impossible, at least choose an item made from degradable plastic. Using alternative products, however, is the best and easiest way to help the \plastfc problem\. V\brth Saving. Reduce, Reuser Separale And Recycle Concordiensis • lS Recyclable!

IFC: Vote Yes :By FRANZ LITZ We Care About U, the campus organization founded amidst an upswing in student activism last yeu, has taken on an encouraging environmental slant. The organization has made a proposal to the Interfraternity Cc11ncil (IFC) and the administration which would help eliminate tbe use of plastic cups on the campus. The students illv<>lved have found the administration to be quite cooperative. The proposal still lacks, however, the expressed support of the IFC, which is scheduled to vote on the measure next Tuesday evening. Fraternity members should instruct their IFC representatives 1<> approve the plan, and offer the necessary and minimal fmancial contribution requested by We Care About U. Under the plan, each Union student. faculty and staff member would initially be issued a sturdy re11sa.ble plastic mug at no charge. These mugs would be carried aro11nd by each person, to fraternity social gatherings, to dini11g halls, or to the Dutch H<>llow and Rathskeller. The plastic C\l}JS that were formerly used ill each of these locations would be eliminated. Additional cups would then be available for purchase sllauld one be lost. The number of cups used on this campus is larger than one might think. The average on-campus fraternity, upon inquiry, goes through roughly 700 to 900 cups :per :week, which suggests that there is considerable waste on the :part of the individuals usiilg these cups. Even taking the loVYer end of this range, 700 cups per week, each on-campus fraternity is responsible for over 20~000 cups per year on average. Witb a total of eighteen fraternities at Union, it is easy to see how fraternities alone could throw away over 300,000 cups per year. Those cups are lying presently in the county landfill, and will lie there for some time to come. With such high numbers categorizillg tile plastic cup situation at Union, it is not surprising that a lligh number of dollars are C:llso involved. A case of 1,000 12-ounce plastic cups costs 35 dollars. We Care About U is asking the fraternities to contribute a mere 50 to 75 dollars to help get the reusable cup plan off the ground. That means that fraternities 'Will begin saving money just three weeks after the We Care About U cups are issued. The savings could conceivably amount to llun.-dreds of dollars per tenn per house. Another reason to eliminate the plastic disposables is the problems with clean-up after social events. Those cups scattered all over the grounds each morning ue less than aesthetically pleasing. We have all seen them. Ifreusable cups were instated, whereby students are forced to pay for replacements, this litter would no longer be the norm for morning walks across campus. Furthermore, the plan offers an O!>])Ortunity for one student ()rganization to cooperate with an()ther in order to make improvements. The proposition, after all, did not come from the administration. We Care About U is made up of students, both Greeks and non-Greeks. In voting on tbis proposal, fraternities have the opportunity to prove what they have been saying all along: \We do more good for the Unioll communi~ than bad.\ We Care About U has come up witb an excellent idea. For a minimal investment, the IFC can begin saving money that otherwise would be spent on enviro11rnentally unsound cups. It would also be showing its willingness to self-impose improvement measures in a cooperative manner. On the reusable cup proposal, the only environmentally responsible vote is yes. rJJ ® U [/[} @ (JJJ f! ii! rw&J f!® @®&J&J CG &~ fJfiiJ ffJ &~ I~ fii1 Write for Concordiensis Submit articles by 4 p.m. Tuesdays ENVIRONMENTAL 50% 40% 30% 20% iO% Makin,g a Diff·erence \College students can make a difference when it comes to protecting the environment.\ 4% 1% O% ~---O~o/c_o ____ __ I Disagree S1rongly Disagree Neither Somewhat Agree Nor Disagree Agree Somewhat Agree Strongly Taken from telephone survey of 500 ccll.ege students rl!ndomly selected from 50 four~year colleges and universities.

Page 10 CONCORDJENSIS, November 8, 1990 INTERNATIONAL FEATURES Eye On The World: Under the Channel By ED MENKE Back in 1751, a French farmer named Nicolas Desmaret argued in \A Dissertation on the Ancient Link Between England and France\ that the two countries must have been joined in the past and that they should be joined again, either by bridge, tunner, or causeway. In the two-hundred-plus years which followed, there have been numerous attempts and failures to accomplish this task. In 1802, Napoleon approved plans for a tunnel to connect Britain with the rest of Europe (see sketching), but war broke out, as it often did, and the plans came to a halt. After numerous other attempts, which ended in failure, Desmaret's vision is finally becoming a reality. This reality is a costly one, and not just financially. The \Chunnel as it is often called, is progressing at the rate of approximately 5 million US dollars a day. While the costs of this construction are being backed by 210 banks and a half of a million shareholders, the figures keep growing and growing. The original 1986 estimate of a whopping 9 billion dollars is now being dwarfed by the 14 billion dollar tab which Eurotunnel, the private company which is footing the bill, has run up. In addition to fiscal blunders, there have been some fatal ones as well. As of September of this year, Eurotunnel has reported Rine casualties, with plenty of construction still to come. Stories of construction workers being killed while working on such structures as the Holland Tunnel and the various New Jersey/New York bridges come to mind, with the hopes that the casualty rate ceases to continue. So, then, are the casualties and the billions of dollars worth the construction of this unprecedented tunnel? Let's let the facts speak for pass~ngers can be evacuated through cross passages set at 400-yard intervals. The smaller arched tube connecting the tunnels is one of 440 pressure- relief ducts. Set at 275-yard intervals, they will allow the column of air that a train pushes ahead of it to whoosh into the other train tunnel and dissipate. Next, the Calais-Folkestone connection: There are 32.3 miles between Calais and Folkestone, 23.6 of which the Chunnel is under water. The Chunnel, which will travel at approximately 80 miles per hour, will cross the Channel in 35 minutes. When the trains start taking passengers in June, 1993, people will be able to go from London to Paris in 3 hours, and from London to Brussels in 2 hours 45 minutes. Both of these estimates are half of what it currently takes someone by either ferry or hovercraft. Lastly, the Chunnel's effects on Folkes tone and Sangatte: One important figure seems to say it all: by the year 2003, officials estimate that 44.6 million people per year will ~ travel, for one reason or E another, under the Channel. i= ...: Breaking this down, we come ~ to about 122,000 people per l day. In addition to the ~ unbearable rush-hour traffic ~ which this could produce, we ::1 8 should think about what this themselves. First of all, about the complex makeup of the Chunnel: (See diagram) The two train tunnels, 100 feel apart, run on either side of the service tunnel, which will be used for maintenance. In an emergency, could do to little towns and villages along and near the coast, like Folkestone and Sangatte. These types of towns and villages, whose economies are usually unaffected by ferry or hovercraft crossings, will suddenly be overwhelmed with a seemingly exorbitant amount News Outside of Schenectady Spanish Club A ban on abortion in Poland may be enacted by the legislature under heavy pressure from the Catholic Church.

'Page 12 CONCORDIENSIS, November 8, 1990 <!Inttntrhitttsis LETTERS ----Founded at Union College 1877--- A Safer and Healthier U The statistics are downright frightening. Researchers estimate that in New York City, one in every twenty persons are infected with the AIDS virus. Furthermore, and closer to home, it is believed that on college campuses one in every five hundred students has contracted the disease. With this in mind, it is conceivable then that four cases may be represented on our campus. It is the impact of these statistics that is the focus of Union's fourth annual AIDS Awareness Week, which comes to a conclusion Friday. The conference, sponsored by the Union College AIDS Committee, scheduled several lectures and panel discussions. Of special interest to students should be the Minerva Lecture being held today at 11:30 in Memorial Chapel. Paul LeClerc, a former Modern Languages professor at Union will be addressing the issue of AIDS on college campuses. Friday evening at 8 p.m., the Committee is sponsoring a comedierme in Memorial Chapel. There was and still is ample opportunity to take advantage of the presentations. In addition to these events, pamphlets and flyers containing AIDS facts and fallacies are available to all students. While a cure for this disease has yet to be found, it is possible to prevent spread of the disease. Every student can help, and availing ourselves to the events and information offered by the Committee is the most effective way of doing so. The statistics speak for themselves now, but not for the future. Take precautions now for a safer and healthier future. Re-Evaluation Presents Opportunity for Student Body Students are often complaining that they do not have enough of a say in the decisions that affect them most. President Hull is to be applauded for avoiding a hasty compliance with the recommendations of the Middle States Report; and instead giving the students, faculty, and staff an opportunity for further discussion before an ultimate recommendation and implementation is reached. As the newly formed committee plods its way toward a decision, the students should use all forums available to them to voice their opinions. The residential and social future of Union College are at stake. Minor changes have been made in recent years in both of these areas. Clearly, further changes are coming. It is true that the faculty and administration have great interests in the residential and social aspects of the College. These areas determine in part the type of student that comes to Union and the academic environment of the school once the students are here. But the students are affected most directly by residential and social decisions. It is fair that the committee is composed of an equal number of students and faculty members; after all, students are the transient component of the Union community. If the students collectively assert themselves, though, they can be the most powetful force on campus. To the Editor: On November 1, 1990, Concordiensis published a letter to the editor from Amon Rubin. The letter carried the caption \I Have Fallen .. and Can't Get Any Help\. This letter allegedly described an incident that occurred involving . a student who experienced a seizure. The letter and the caption would lead the reader to believe that the person in need did not receive adequate assistance. Mr. Rubin stated that \ ... the security officers, • roommate, and students waited nervously and helplessly for the Schenectady Paramedics to arrive to start treatment.\ While I applaud Mr. Rubin's efforts to become active in campus life and encourage campus support for UMED (Union College First Aid Squad), I find it inappropriate to denegrate the concerned and dedicated service provided to this campus by members of the Campus Safety Department, the Schenectady Fire Department Paramedics and Mohawk Ambulance Service. The actual situation as it occurred is that the Campus Safety Department received a call for assistance for a student having a seizure. The responding. officers were located outside of the building at the time and they responded to the scene immediately. One of the responding officers is a NYS- certified EMf and was on the scene administering to the Letters to the Editor do not necessarily reflect the opinions of the Editorial Board ALL LEITERS TO THE EDITOR MUST BE TYPED, DOUBLE SPACED AND SUBMlTIED TO THE CONCORDIENSIS OFFICE BY 4:00 P.M.

As part of our normal procedure ilie Campus Safety Department control operator was instructed to contact the Schenectady Paramedics who responded after receiving our call for assistance. I believe that it is wholly inappropriate to castigate the Campus Safety Department and the Schenectady Paramedics over this incident that was, in fact, handled most properly and promptly. Further, the entire content of the leuer served to imply that the current system of emergency response is inadequate and tended to impugn the efforts of those who are working hard to make this a safe campus. Members of the Campus· Safety Department, the Schenectady Fire Department Paramedics and Mohawk Ambulance have responded to numerous calls for medical emergencies over the years and have always done so in a positive and directed manner. The Campus Safety Officers are assigned to zoned areas of responsibility and are in direct radio contact with our control operators. The Schenectady Fire Department Paramedics are located on Nott Street, directly across the street from our campus (at our doorstep). Response times have always been well within accepted standards and the level of service is outstanding! I .certainly believe in improvement and innovation, and I have been working with Arnon Rubin in his effort to found and activate UMED. I will continue to work with him and encourage his efforts but not at the expense of others who work hard to offer aid and assistance to this campus and to those in need. Paul F.

CONCORDIENSIS, No-vember 8, 1990 Page 15 Better Than Bran: The WRUC Record Revi:ews By RON EUGENIO Various Artists - Red Hot & Blue ·(Chrysalis) As hard as it is, try to ignore the stellar roster of artists on this album (David Byrne! Neneh Cherry! U2! Sinead O'Connor! TomWaits!). As hard as it is, try to ignore the fact that this album is a benefit album for AIDS research, reason alone to buy this. The most jarring fact of Red Hot & Blue are the songs themselves. Every last one of them is a cover version of a Cole Porter song, and even though the lyrics and melodies are about fifty years old, each one sounds as fresh as Madonna's newest image. Porter, a repressed homosexual, had the talent to feel his way around a phrase, then fill it with emotion, twisting old cliches like \I've got you under my skin\ into something timeless. Further- more, simple lines as on Aztec Camera's version of \Do I Love You,\ \Hold my hand and swear/ you'll never cease to care/ For without you what else could I do?\ take new meaning when sung for an AIDS benefit album. Sinead O'Connor sings the immortal line \Do Do that voodoo that you do so weH\ on \You Do Something To Me.\ David B yme throws in his third world influences on \Don't Fence Me In.\ The Fine Young Cannibals offer an acoustic tingle on \Love For Sale.\ Lisa Stansfield and The Jungle Brothers take their respective Porter songs and put them on the dance floor. The Brother's \I Get A Kick Out Of You\ in particular would have the composer dancing dead if it were played to him. There are a few clunkers. It's inevitable on a double album. Erasure are their forgettable selves on \Too Darn Hot\ (one of these days, fair reader, lead singer Andy Bell wm get a life). Most disappointing is U2's \Night and Day,\ cementing claims that they are the band of the 80's. Their version of the song sounds like a \Return-to-the-tree\ track, and Bono's yelps and shrieks, once distinctive, are beginning to sound hollow. But this album isn't about Arts Club: A Review of the F antastics standpoint, the play was a demonstration in reverse psychology in which the fathers of the young lovers build a wall between their neighboring properties so that their rebellious children would grow up to love one another. But once the plot was discovered by the children, the whole plan backfired, leading to the separation and abandonment of the woman. Each, in tum, learns the true nastiness of the world through the loss of things most dear. The Arts Club is a new dub on campus. We meet every Thursday at 4:30 in CC 409.

While Robert Smith is considered a demi-god in college music, his sullen posturing and Camus references are reminiscent of the Smiths without Johnny Marr's genius. Wanker City.

We started out the evening with wine and cheese at the apartment of one of the members. This added a nice touch to the whole experiene. The play itself was very interesting. Written in the 1950's, the generation gap was apparent in the basic story line of the show. The sixteen year old girl was poruayed as the stereotypical inferior woman. Yet Glory Crampton was incredible in her interpretation of this role. Her deliberate overacting and overall satire made the audience appreciate her for what she really was; we grieved her loss towards the end. Robert Goulet played the worldly villain whose twisted logic compelled him to steal innocence from the two young lovers whose adolescence deprived them of the ability to love one another.

Happy birthday Charles Demuth. This week's featured artist, Charles Demuth, was born today, Nov. 8, 1n 1883. Demuth, an American artist, worked not only as an illustrator but as a playwright and set designer. Critics have analyzed his works according to traditional sex role of masculine and feminine. Flowers and vegegables, the subjcts of his water colors, were considered to be delicate and soft like a female; on the other hand his geometric post cubist works were considered to be rendered in a masculine mode. One example of Demuth's work is the painting \I Saw The Figure Five in Gold\ (1928). This painting later influenced many artists during the 1960's pop movement.

The quintet will feature saxophonist Cornelius Bumpus who is well known for his work with the Doobie Brothers. Presslaff, who spent several years in the Capital District before moving to Princeton, NJ, has played with major jazz players Ed Blackwell, Roswell Rudd, and the late Bill Barron. He has also frequently performed with local artists Julie Kabat and Mark Foster. He was recently honored with a New Jersey Council on the Arts Individual Artist Fellowship, a grant based on past artistic excellence. In addition to C. Bumpus, Jeffs quintet highlights the playing of Pat Wristen, a strikingly original trumpet and flugelhom player, acoustic bassist Wilbo Wright, who just returned from a tour with Yo La Tengo and Ferdi Serim. . .

! t CONCORDIENSIS, November 8, 1990 Page 21 <lrnnrorbirttsis SPORTS Hockey Downed ·in Heartbreaker By ANDREW SEEWALD Editor-in-Chief A late goal by Joe Spinelli spoiled a marvelous Union comeback as the Soaring Eagles beat the Dutchmen, 6-5. For the Dutchmen, Tuesday night's game was the season opener for 1990-91. Union trailed 5-2 entering the third period, but g()als by Bill Railton, Terry Campbell, and Tim Cregan knotted the game at 5-5. That was the second time that the Dutchmen had come from behind in the game. Elmira scored the frrst two goals before Campbell and Craig Ferrero pulled Union even for the first time. Union featured a lineup long ort freshmen, as defesnemen Byron Smith and Bill McKenna, and forwards Jayson Flowers, Tim Smith, Wally Bzdell, Steve Battist()n, and Jeff Jiampetti all made their regular season debuts. But it was the veterans who carried the scoring load. Campbell, teamed with Rick Clifford and Flowers, was particularly impressive. His first goal was an unassisted dash into the Elmira zone, where he pulled up at tile right faceoff circle and blasted a slapshot high and into the far side of the net past Elmira goaltender Tom O'Brian. Campbell's second goal was fashioned in a different, but no less spectacular, style. The Dutchmen, in the midst of their third-period comeback, were buzzing around the Eagle zone for several min11tes of continuous pressure. B tit most of the action was around the perimeter of the Elmira defense, and most was in ,the form of good, but fruitless, passing. That was until Ferrero spotted Campbell, a senior and one of the tri-captains, alone at the right faceoff dot. He fed him the puck, Campbell teed it up and then fired a bullet past O'Brian. Campbell also had an assist, giving h:iin three points for the evening. That put him within one point of Curt Cole for fifth on the all-time Union scoring list. Though Union never had the lead, twice they seemed to have ·the game under control. First · was after Ferrero's goal 9 seconds into the second period tied the score at 2. It was under control. that is, until Elmira exploded for three goals within 1:46, starting at 16:49 of the second period. It looked like that would be the knockout punch that the Soaring Eagles were looking for, but the Dutchmen bounced back in the final stanza. Mter Cregan's goal tied the game, it looked like Union had all the momentum and that Elmira was reeling. But the Eagles were not ranked tops in the ECAC West for nothing. A lot of the reason they were ranked first was because of Spinelli, a junior center. He took passes from Scott Doherty and Bernie Cassell and found himself. all alone in front of goaltender Shayne White, who had replaced Jim Helkie at the start of the period. Spinelli waited for White to go down, then slid the puck into the right side of the net, and Union's comeback had been foiled. LAST CHANCE - SAT., NOV. 17th TRIP TO NEW YORK CITY ONLY $25.!!

Head Coach Susan Bassett, who has guided the Dutchwomen to a dual record of 27-2 over the last three seasons, is looking for an encore performance in 1990. \We lost only four swimmers off of last year's team and the eight freshmen that we have this year should more than make up for those losses ... at least on paper,\ stated Bassett. ''I'm not so much worried about the talent, I'm more concerned wtih fmding the leadership that we lost through graduation.\ Despite graduating just four swimmers, Union is a very young team as this year's roster shows seven sophomores, seven juniors, and three seniors· to go along with those eight freshmen. Sophomore Sharon Gatt leads a very talented group of returning swimmers. Gatt was selected the state meet's \Outstanding Swimmer\ by a vote of the 18 coaches as she captured the 500 free. the 200 free, the 100 free and the 200 fly while finishing second to graduated teammate Kathy Kaveney in the 100 fly. Gatt was also a key swimmer for Union on the winning 400 and 800 free relay teams. In fact it was Gatt who outswam Ithaca's Shannon O'Brien by :01.10 in the 400 relay that enabled Union to win the state meet by a score of 795-789. She was an All-American honorable mention at the NCAA meet and comes into this season holding four Union College records. Gatt howeer, is not alone. Juniors Anne Glicksman, Amy O'Neill, Jen Joyce, Jeanne Cutrone, and Kerstin Dorse all earned honorable mention All- American status at the NCAA meet and all contributed greatly to Union's .state championship. WhHe Bassett is highly optimistic about her team's chances of repeating the successes of last year, she is also concerned that her team not put too much pressure on itself. \My goal as a coach is to develop each swimmer to her fullest potential,\ said Bassett. \I have no control over what Ithaca or anybody else did recruiting-wise or what they do in their meets. I want each of our swimmers to fulfill their individual goals of becoming solid competitive performers, but I also want them to enjoy the sport. I don't want the pressures of what we did last year to take the fun out of what we want to accomplish this season. \I'm not about to compare last year with any of my teams (Bassett coached 10 individual All-Americans and a total of 16 overall, including one national champion, while directing the program at William Smith for seven yers. Her overall record is 103-31 in 10 seasons). I start over every year. The successes of the last three years has brought Union's program to a level of respectability in the state as well as nationally. It was hard getting to that point and it's going to be harder staying here. I want this year's women to compete against the solid foundation we've built over the last three seasons, not burden themselves with unnecessary pressures POilCY & PROCEDURES brought on by last year's success. \If we work as hard as we can. that's ali I can ask. The wins and losses will take care of themselves.\ Once again the Dutchwomen will be particularly strong in the butterfly, breaststroke, and freestyle distance events. Bassett is also looking br strong perfonnances from all of her relay teams and for more depth and points out of her divers. Gatt, Cutrone, and freshman Kelly Bevan appear to be the keys t() the butterfly races, an event that boasts a strong lineup and a great deal of depth. Bevan, Joyce, freshman Janet Finn, and O'Neill anchor the breaststroke events while Dorse, junior Jen Park, and freshman S lacey Christensen head up the freestyle distance races. Sophomore Kristen Holbrook, who set all of Union's records a year ago, tops the divers. She will get solid support from sophomore Lisa Massimino and freshman Natasha Zabka. Glicksman, senior Pam Fiedler, and sophomore Julie Benker head the backstroke events while sophomore Beth Sordillo and junior Daphne Shirley provide the depth. \As I said before, we've got the talent ... at least on paper, what I'm looking for is leadership. We need someone to step forward and take on the responsibility of keeping us focused. Time will tell if that person or persons emerges.\ Union will compete against pretty much the same schedule that it went 9-0 against last year. However, highly regarded Williams has been added and will travel to Schenectady on January 8. FOR PICKING UP HOCKEY GAME TICKETS Union College Full Time Undergraduate Students: 1.

Page 22 CONCORDIENSIS~ November 8, 1990 <!rnnrnrbitttllis SPORTS Bob Bids Magee Adieu Continued from page 24 good guy to talk to,\. said senior varsity member Eric Cressman. Magee recruited excellently the type of student for which Unio~ looks, according to Athletic Director Richard Sakala. \Bob through all of these years,\ Sak:ala said, \is a teacher first and foremost.\ He is open that they will have an academic life as well as an athletic one while playing with the Dutchmen. It was great recruiting and great skills that brought Magee and Union soccer its incredible success during the late 1970's and early 1980's. In 1975 and 1980 Magee and the Dutchmen were champions in ~he ECAC post season tournament, in 1978 they were ranked second in the state of New York, in 1983 they were ranked sixth in the nation and first in New York, in 1984 they were ranked ninth, in 1985 they were ranked tenth, and in 1986 they were ranked twelfth. During that stretch from 1983 until 1986 the Dutchmen were regulars in the NCAA post season tournament and were ranked highly in New York as well. The success of the team during these years \speaks well for Bob (Magee),\ Sakala said. \There is no question that he is respected by his peers.\ Magee Women's X-C Runs Well At ECAC's By SPORTS STAFF has also led the Dutchmen to a 147 win, ninety-three loss, and eighteen tie, record over his eighteen year tenure at Union. But even with past success and the praise of his peers, Magee has decided to step down from the head coaching position at Union College. The decision, Sakala said, came entirely from Magee and that he faced no pressures from the school to retire. According to both Magee and Sakala, the decision to retire was made several years ago and had been thoroughly discussed. \Basically it was a case of it being time to step down,\ Sakala said. Magee is sixty- five and must travel from Western Massachusetts, a three hour drive each way, to reach Union for every practice and game. This on top of the stresses of coaching and recruiting at the collegiate level, have led Magee to believe that it was time to stop. \The job comes with a lot of stress,\ Magee said, \I go home each day exhausted ... emotionally drained.\ Magee also felt that it was time that there was some \new blood\ coaching at Union and that it was time \for a new era to begin.\ The Dutchmen have had a slight slide over the last several years and perhaps, like Magee did when he arrived, a new coach will be able to turn things around. The college community will definitely miss Magee, not just his coaching style, but the personality he brought to the campus as well. \I've worked with (Magee) for fourteen of his eighteen years,\ Sakala said, \and I feel he has a great sense of humor, is sincere, and shows a deep concern for his players.\ Sak:ala also thought that Magee treated all of his players fairly. \We've been fortunate to have him at Union,\ Sakala continued, and that \he's done us proud.\ The feelings of sadness are reciprocal for Magee; when he officially departs in June, he will \definitely miss the relationship,\ with Union. Magee also has some regrets about his retirement when he sees the strong crop of freshmen on this year's squad. Magee has five children, all of whom are grown and now have children of their own. He says he w.ants to see his grandchildren compete and grow. and says that he will, however, definitely continue to coach at the prep school level, hut wants to do other things with his life. According to the teacher, it is difficult to stop coaching because one deals with people and makes a lot of friends. The people he meets and the things he does are animate and cannot be turned on and offlike \a computer.\ It will be hard, according to Magee, to lose the relationship with the people. But Magee's decision brings more questions than where he will coach, if he coaches, next year. Life at Union will continue and the search for a new head soccer coach must begin. The position, Sakata . says, will be advertised as vacant at the beginning of the new year and applications will be accepted. The advertisement · may be unnecessary for there have been a number of inquiries about the position and a number of applications have already been received. Sakala declined to comment on who will replace Magee, but the sentiment on the team is definitely in support of current assistant coach Howard Charboneau. Sakata claims to want a new coach by May so that he may take over for Magee come July. Regardless of who will be pacing the sidelines next season it has been an excellent career for Magee. The coach brought the team from a slide when he took over in the early 1970's to a state championship in 1983. Senior captain Eric Reaman said, \It's been great to play for him for four years.\ Reaman also said it will be difficult to find anyone quite like Magee. Although a search for a replacement will continue, Magee has won the respect of his peers and his players and will be missed at Union College. This past Saturday saw the women's cross-country team back on the trails again as they traveled to Tufts' University to compete in ECAC's. It was an unusually warm day for post- season racing along with slow course conditions and muddy terrain, but the women persevered and all ran strong races. Once again Co-Captain Meg Parsons finished first for the Union squad. Parsons has been a strong team leader, placing well last week in States, and again this week with a time of 22:47. Finishing next for Union was senior Lauren Karp. Karp, showing her stuff once again crossed the line with a strong time of 23:02. Co-Captain Sandra Anselment was next for the squad with a time of24:07. Placing fourth on the team was junior Cyndi Hunter. Hunter has been running extremely well in these post-season meets. Her final time on Sat. was an impressive 24:42. Kristen Welch rounded out the scoring for Union, crossing the line in a strong performance of 25:00. Unfortunately, Clare (Mrs.) Mcgathlin was unable to finish the race due to an injury suffered earlier in the season. So Where Does It End? The women's team concludes their season this coming weekend as they compete in the National Qualifiers at Saratoga. It's the last chance to see the team in action so come on out and cheer them on! By FRIEDS The men's soccer season has been over for a week now, and now is the time for reflection on what accomplishments the team and individuals put together. Despite the mediocre 5-8-1 record. the Dutchmen never failed to entertain, and are therefore worthy of the congratulations of a job well done. \When looking back at the season, you've got to remember that we lost five contests in overtime,\ commented Jem Sollinger on the season on the whole. Yes, the team did suffer many tough losses, and had to overcome many injuries as well. There was never a moment when the Dutchmen had all their regulars in the line-up. The difficulty of the schedule combined with the relative youth of the squad was another factor. Next year, with a similar schedule and an additional year of experience, the squad could easily win 12 games. Don't forget, a new coach is on the way, too. But this article is about awards. These are the Frieds awards, and have no bearing on anything except for possible bragging rights among the lads who kick the pelota. So here we go •.. I am the •n• Award: Goes to D .J.

Play me or trade me, coach: A tie between Rob Dutchmen Swim•rs 'Looking for Continued l~provement By SPORTS IN FORMA 'FION It has taken a little longer than their female counterparts, but it appears as though the men's swim .program at Union College is finally ready to make a name for itself. The Dutchmen are coming off their first winning season in 21 years (S-4) and head coach Susan Bassett is looking for continued improvement this year. \I have high expectations for the men,\ stated Bassett, who has led the women's program to a three-year record of 27-2 but was in her first campaign as the men's head coach last year. \We're very young, but we've got a solid corps of returning swimmers to go along with a dozen very talented freshmen,\ Junior Tony Tremaglio leads a group of 10 returning lettermen who not only helped provide the winning record, but helped the squad finish 11 of 17 teams in the New York State meet. It was Union's best performance in quite a while. Tremaglio comes into the year holding six individual records. Meanwhile, sopho- more Dave Robison set all of Union's diving marks during his rookie campaign. Classmate Cliff Shaw holds the Union mark in both the 500 and 1,000 freestyle events. Sophomore Sven Zabka and juniors Tim Lynch, Andy Wagshul and Chris Walsh anchor the record-holding relay teams. The Dutchmen have two things this year that they haven't had in a long while ... numbers (25 on the roster) and quality depth. \The intrasquad competition has been outstanding,\ stated Bassett. \We've got good people in every event and there has been a great deal of intensity during practices. We. believe in ourselves more this year and I think we feel more like a team that will be able to be competitive with everyone on our schedule.\ While Bassett is pleased with what she sees in her veterans, she is also thrilled with what she has seen with her freshmen. Rookies Bill Humphreys, Jesse Chang, and Drew Pirich wm--ream with Shaw, Walsh, and Lynch to make the butterfly events one of Union's strongest. Tremaglio, who holds all of Union's breaststroke records, will team with freshmen Chip Quarrier, Dave Lichtenberg. James Ernst and Adam Stein to make the breaststroke events solid point producers for ihe squad. Wagshul, Walsh, and sophomore Kevin Wilbur will combine with freshmen Ernst and Stein in the sprint freestyle events while Shaw, Pirich, and freshman Ian Prout spearhead the distance free races. Robison is expected to get solid support from junior Mike Cassidy in the diving competition. Union will host the New York State Meet the weekend of February 21. \Hosting that meet will be a big advantage for us,\ stated Bassett. \We're looking to finish well up among the top 10 this year, improve on our 5- 4 record of last season, and qualify some people for the national meet. I think those goals are very attainable. \We're still a very young team (only three seniors), but I think the foundation that our returning veterans put down last year will give our freshmen something to build upon this season. I'm looking forward to an exciting and successful season.\ Turn Jock Block Into Writers Itch Write for Sports Call Andy 381-4651 Kaulbach and Paul Viviano, for never forgetting that this is only Division III (especially Wednesday nights). Take it for the team, Loopis: Dan Wilmot, for moving back to defense when the injuries started to pile up.

Well, that just about wraps up another year of men's soccer. Fortunately, this will be my last season, too, so I wish the next writer well. Remember, this is Division III, and as the soccer team continues to improve, please keep the fun in the game, and the article. Otherwise, it's just another meathead sport, and, as anyone who's ever played the game can tell you, that's not what soccer, the world's game. is all about. t I

i I. CONCORDIENSIS, November 8, 1990 Page 23 <!!vltfllrbirttstz SPORTS Dom Ricciardi and Dutchm·en Offense Tame Norwich By ANDY B.RA VER Sports Editor Senior center Dom Ricciardi keyed the offensive charge t.his past Saturday as the Union Dutchmen totally dominated and devastated Norwich, 34-0. For his outstanding effort and leadership, Ricciardi has been selected as the Concordien- sis Sports Athlete of the Week. The 6 '2 n, 230-pound Ricciardi is in his second and final year as a starter. In the eight games Union has played so far this year, quarterback Brett Russ has received stellar pass protection from his front five. Russ has been brought to the turf only six times for a total loss ef 18 yards. The offense, which is averaging just under four Ricciardi touchdowns a game at 27.5 points, has been sparked by the great blocking up front. Ricciardi is the leader of the unit that is opening up gaping holes for Vladimir Telemaque and Alex Felipe. Union's ground game is piling up 202.1 yards a game on the ground for an average of 4.2 yards a carry. They have also scored 19 rushing touchdowns. Not to be forgotten is the passing game. Russ and Co. have made the most of the great protection afforded them and the team is averaging 172.6 yards through the air and has added seven touchdowns. The offensive line has really come through when it was most needed, as Union has converted 47.4% of their 3rd down plays (55 for 116). The Dutchmen have also dominated on time of possession this year, holding the ball over 35 minutes longer than their opponents. Good luck in what, hopefully, is not his final game this Saturday, and congratulations on a great effort and career to Dom Ricciardi, this week's C on c o r d i e n s is Sports Athlete of the Week. Men's Cross Country on the Mark By GREG BARRETT This past Saturday, the Union Men's Cross-Country team competed in the New York State Division III Championships. They were hosted by Union and were held at Saratoga State Park. It was a hot and hazy day which was very atypical of November in upstate New York. The 17 teams were anxious and waiting for the Union cannon to be fired. Bang! and they were off. Greg Barrett was the first finisher for Union completing the course in 30: 16. This was a new course personal record for Barrett, knocking over a minute off of his time. Captain Rich \Gumby\ Zembek was close behind in 31:09. Zembek also posted a new course PR, showing off his hard work. Next for the Dutchmen was Adam Reisman. Reisman finished with a time of 31:52 which was one of his higher marks for an outstanding season. Following close behind was Ed \Rhino n Rothenberg in 32:34. Ed Dorsey rounded out the top five crossing in 33:08. This is right on his mark after his strong return from an ankle injury. Bill Taylor also put out a strong effort. He ran his second best time ever, 33:37, with a sot\~ hip. This weekend, the harriers are hosting the NCAA Regional Qualifier at Saratoga State Park. The season is coming down to the wire and the Dutchmen are going to face some tough competition. All of the top teams in the state and from around the area will be there including number three ranked (nationally) University of Rochester and number seven ranked R.I.T.

By ANDY BRAVER Sports Editor It's time again for another installment of 'Did You Know ... ' because I have gathered a great list of things worth knowing. Well, maybe they are not worth knowing, but they are at least interesting. Well, maybe they are not that interesting, but at least they take up space in this column. Did you know that in the late 1970s, New York Rangers goalie John V anbiesbrouck was not the best goalie on his hockey team. A close friend of his named Chris Sabo was the best netminder in Vanbiesbrouck's neighborhood. Sabo, of course, is the third baseman of the World Champion Cincinnati Reds. Did you know that Keith Byars, the third leading rushing in Ohio State history and currently a member of the Philadelphia Eagles, has more pass RECEPTIONS than rushing YARDS so far this year. Through Week Eight, Byars had ·caught 42 balls for 411 yards and had rushed 13 times for 27 yards. Did you know that in the 11 NFL games played on Sunday of Week Eight, the winning teams combined for only nine turnovers, while the losers committed a total of 42. That is a plus-33 takeaway-giveaway ratio, and the 49ers were the only winning team that turned the ball over more than once. Did you know that since 1968, only one NHL team has gone from runner-up to Stanley Cup Champion in consecutive seasons. That team was the 1983 Edmonton Oilers. Did you also know that since 1968, only six different teams have won the Stanley Cup. I won't tell you who they are because it is next week's question. There are 12 teams that have lost in the finals since '68. The Boston Bruins have lost the most (5 times), while Philadelphia (4), St. Louis (3), Chicago (2), and the New York Rangers (2) have all been runners-up more than 'once. Did you know that for Mario Lemieux to reach the 2,000 point milestone, he will have to average 140 points for another nine seasons. It will take Steve Yzerman another 13 seasons to reach the same mark if his current average of 99 points a season remains the same. Did you know that since the NCAA introduced the three- point shot to Division I in 1986-87, there has been a steady increase in the number of attempted 3-point goals per game. While the attempts have increased year to year, the shooting percentage has decreased. Last year, the nation shot 36.7% from beyond the arc. What is odd, however, is that the national scoring average dropped by almost two points last year from the preceding season. Did you know that the Elias Sports Bureau ranked the top Major League players at each position. The players are ranked at their respective positions using various statistics over the past two years. Their all-all-star team is: Will Clark (lB), Rync Sandberg (2B), Alan Trammell (SS), Tim Wallach (3B), Kevin Mitchell (OF), Mike Greenwell (OF), Robin Yount (OF), Carlton Fisk (C), Dave Stewart (P), and Ron Dibble (RP). Not b d d .. ?I I a a squa , ts tt. .. Did you know that each member of the Cincinnati Reds receives a winner's share because of their Series victory. Each player received a whopping $112,533.70. Last year the Oakland Athletics received a record $114,252.11 apiece. Because of their loss this year, they each receive a ·loser's share of $69,995.11 It's amazing how much money losing can cost each guy. Did you know that the National League's total attendance decreased by over three-quarters of a million this year. Only four of the twelve NL teams registered attendance in ceases this year. The final decrease total was 776,169. The American League attendance, on the other hand, actually increased by 482,510. This says something about the state of the two leagues.

Soccer Coach Bob Magee Retires After 18 Yea-rs Bob Magee By JARED SELTER It's the end of an era at Union College. Another chapter in athletic saga has come to a close as men's soccer coach Bob Magee retired. Magee coached his last game on October 20, beating rival Manhattanville 2-0 for the final win of his illustrious and successful career with the Dutchmen. Magee has been with the college for eighteen years, he was a forty-seven year-old rookie in 1972, and has seen the college and the sport that he loves change over the years. Magee came to the college the year after it turned co-ed in 1972 and claims that the most drastic change in the college is the increasing addition of women to the college. Magee also claims that the college has become much more social over the years, in terms of fraternities, and feels that this increase should be a concern to 1 Tnion. Bu! thcc.,c Lll;mgr-.; have lit 1( affected the \port and the players with whom Magee has dealt over his career. Magee admits that there have been some cases where an athlete may have put his social calendar in front of his athletic priorities, but these were in the vast minority. The majority of players that Magee has seen in eighteen years are the ones that , 1 :llinu~dly giw one hun(trcd pcrc~nt over their four years at Union. The players give so much because so much is demanded of them. Magee, in his own words, \is still an old son of a gun,\ and is very demanding on his players. He credits the players over the years for putting up with such a grueling schedule of academics and athletics. Each player, in addition to maintaining a full course load, must also deal with the rigors of long road trips, practices, and exhaustion. \It's tough to be an athlete and an academian,\ Magee said. But it is the academics that Magee stressed upon his players. In a time when most big name colleges and coaches are producing college graduates that cannot read or write and have fallen into disgrace for the rules violations that have run rampant over the years, Magee is a light that shines above the clouds. In an era of permissiveness on college campuses in terms of athletes, Magee demands discipline, and thai hi-; players arc \gentlemen\ wherever they go. Magee said that, \We may not be able to make you an All- American, ·but we can guarantee you a good career (after graduation).\ Magee brings this perspective along while recruiting during the off season, a task at which he is very adept and respected. \(\1agcc)\s a great recruiter because he's personable and a November 8, 1990 Union Marches Over Cadets, 34-0 By BRIAN UNGER As the Union College football team embarked on their three and a half hour trip to Northfield, Vermont, to meet the Norwich Cadets, they realized that they would have win convincingly if they wanted to keep their play-off chances alive. The opportunity was there for them to do just that, as they faced a Cadet team which had only one victory in its first six games, and was mired in a five game losing streak. The Dutchmen capitalized on the situation by methodically defeating Norwich, 34-0. The Dutchmen took advantage of their strong defensive effort, and Norwich turnovers, to build a 21-0 half time lead. Sophomore tight end Tim Bradford opened the scoring with a one handed, twenty yard touchdown reception with 6:31 left in the first quarter. Union covered 52 yards on six plays and only took a little more than two minutes off the clock. On the next drive, it only took the Dutchmen one play to reach the end zone, thanks to their defense. On their first play from scrimmage following Bradford's TD, Norwich fumbled, and strong safety Dave Healey recovered the ball on the Cadets' 8 yard line. The ensuing play saw Alex Felipe scamper in to the end zone, and after Greg Harrison added the extra point, Union had a 14-0 advantage. The second quarter was highlighted by Union's defense, as they continued to shut down Norwi,h's offense. By half time, the defense had limited the Cadets to only 28 total yards and ·four first downs. They forced four fumbles, two of which they recovered, sacked Cadet quarterback Dave Lewis seven times, made kicker Matt Jones punt 7 times, and most impressively, they limited the Cadets to minus 37 yards rushing. The offense got into the act as well in the second quarter by extending the lead to 21-0 with 4:36 left on the clock. Quarterback Brett Russ engineered a seven play, 32 yard drive which. culminated in Alex Felipe's one yard touchdown run. It was Felipe's second score of the day, and eighth of the year. The second half saw more domination on the part of Union's defense, and as a result, more Norwich turnovers which led to Union scores. Greg Holmes recovered a fumble in the third quarter which eventually led to Vladimir Telemaque's four yard touchdown catch, and a 28-0 Union advantage. Later in the quarter, Marco Lainez picked off a Dave Lewis pass and returned it fifty yards to Norwich's 8 yard line. A few plays later, fullback Tom Lombardoni capped off the scoring with a three yard touchdown run. Brian Harrison missed his first PAT of the season when it was blocked making the final 34-0. He had successfully converted 28 in a row. While the offense lit up the scoreboard, the defense showed the Cadets who was in command. They held Norwich to minus four yards rushing on 30 attempts, and 97 total on 66 plays. That is an average of 1.5 yards per play. The Cadets had only 5 first downs, and just one in the second half, none of which came on the ground. They only held the ball for 8:25 the entire second half as well. While the offense produced a well balanced attack, Brett Russ was named to the ECAC weekly honor roll by competing 18 of 26 passes for 173 yard·s, and two touchdowns. Union's play-off chances are still UJl in the air as they enter the last week of the regular season. The Dutchmen, now 7- 1, are still not ranked in the NCAA poll. Hofstra and Ramapo are both undefeated, and almost assured of a post season bid. Cortland, even though they suffered their first loss of the season at the hands of Ithaca. is still ranked ahead of the Dutchmen, as is Ithaca (7-1). Plymouth St. (8-1) lias also been a strong team all season,. and besides Union, Trenton (7-1), and WPI (7-0-1) are battling for play-off positions as well. However, if Union wins this weekend, but does not make it to the national play-offs, the Dutchmen would most likely be invited to participate in their first ever ECAC tournament game. Turning to the Champion Upstate New York Poll, Union retained their number three standing behind Ithaca and Cortland. Ithaca's victory over Cortland moved them into first place with 79 points. Cortland fell to second with 63 points, and the Dutchmen follow with 50 points. Buffalo State and RPI round out the top five. Union travels to Hamilton (2-5) next week for their last game of the regular season. Kickoff is at 1 p.m. This will be the last time that these two teams meet in Clinton, NY. Next year's game at Frank Bailey Field will close the curtain on one of the longest football rivalries on NCAA history. Next week, however, Union will need another hig victory if they are to have any chance of making the playoffs, and entertain any hopes of returning to the Stagg Bowl. SUPPORT UNION SPORTS

As a result, the IFC is considering a policy which would place the duty of policing members in its own hands.

This policy will require fraternities to monitor their own members' actions and punish offenders. Details concerning vote results will be made known in full in the first issue of Concordiensis next term. With this policy, the IFC hopes that tension between fraternities and the Union community will be eased and mitigated. Evaluation Team On Campus December 2-5 By ELISE FOODY Editor~in-Chief The stage is being set for final preparations in the College's Middle States Accreditation procedure. After submitting a comprehensive self-study report in October to members of the Association, the College is now preparing to host a nine-member evaluation team. The evaluation team, which is comprised of eight college faculty and administrators, and chaired by the president of Bucknell University, will be on campus Sunday, December 2 until Wednesday, December 5. According to Dean of Faculty Jim Underwood, the evaluation team will be most interested in talking casually with students about Union, and studying in more detail certain aspects of the report. To assist the team in doing this a \Resources Room\ is being set up as a place where members can read in detail the College's precise policy regarding such issues as affirmative action and residence life. Copies of the report are available in a number of locations, and students are encouraged to read the report.

Page 2 CONCORDIENSIS, November 15, 1990 <11nltfllrbtrnsts NEWS ANALYSIS Elections Reflective ln this age of conservatism and acceptance of Republican ideology that has continued since the election of Richard -Nixon in 1968 (with the exception of Jimmy Carter from 1976-89), the voting populous has taken the attitude that changes can orginiat:e from within Congress by convincing established officials that public sentiment is altering rather than risk drastic change and deal with federal disarray. towards the middle of the political spectrum-- moderates belonging to both parties who will cross the invisible ideological line in order to voice an opinion that points toward slow but progressive change. Of Voter Tendency The truth is, while Democrats are .slowly gaining more Congressional seats with every election, their overwhelming advantage in controlling Capitol Hill will be an extremely slow process. No one bas taken advantage of this voter centralization better in presidential elections than Ronald Reagan and, tater, George Bush who, through die- hard Republicans, have. appealed to the marginal voting masses by running on agendas that will smoothly integrate into the system rather than shock the public. By JIM POLITES In the wake of budget strife that damaged both public opinion of President George Bush and GOP status on Capitol Hill, a strong national consensus evolved that swayed favorably toward the Democratic Party and indicated that as November 6 elections approached, voters were preapred to voice their disdain with recent government inefficiency. As last Tuesday approached, Bush knew full well that the budget debacle was only a brief introduction to what could happen over the next two years should a liberal contingent continue to grow in congress. the widespread rhetoric that invariably surrounds such monumental political activity was out in full force. Republicans sought to dismiss the black cloud of legislative blocking and wealth protection that ling.ered following the public debt mess, while Democrats, taking advantage of a bonafide opportunity, were hoping to gain seats and a clearer majority in both houses by teeing off on their opposition's lack of desire to address middle class welfare with any substance. The chief executive took the predictable campaigning stance of rallying behind the flag while focusing on safe issues like the Persian Gulf, a subject that generally finds support among all Americans and is generally associated with conservative, nationalist policy and decision-making. Bush knew full well that the budget debacle was only a brief introduction to what could happen over the next two years should a liberal contingent continue to grow in Congress-- he would be assigned the unenviable task of acting as referee in party clashes that because of sheer numbers, would result in Democrat victories and endless right wing frustration. All of this preliminary intrigue and furious campaigning made for an exciting build-up on Election Day that hinted of radical change and a record number of incumbents being squeezed out of office. Unfortunately for some, the great GOP collapse and massive left wing domination never took place. For all the internal bickering and lack of cohesion that permeated throughout national politics, Americans decided either to stay home completely or keep the status quo by siding with 96% of those candidates seeking re-election. For today, there is not a powerful group of extreme leftists, as was evident in the sixties, who see rapid social and political change as the answer to domestic policy improvement. If anything, the American public is dominated by people who find themselves situated It is obvious that this concentrated voting structure is a phenomenon resulting from a population that realizes the need for change but is reluctant to go the distance in voicing a protest vote. For those who see the need to radically change the internal workings of our country, a long, arduous road lies ahead, for we have molded an inherently rigid system that rewards those who can bridge the relatively short gap between moderate supporters of both parties. As these effective straddlers continue to pervade the national politial scene, it will once again be up to the voting public to decide if this is the type of government we wish to live under. Only time and/or a challenging crisis of global proportions will tell whether or not this type of ideology is indeed productive enough to lead us into 21st century politics. For Saddam To Triumph By DAVID WEISSMAN As the desert heat cools in the months of December and January, the likelihood of a US offensive strike on Iraq increases. President Bush's heated rhetoric intends to both warn Saddam Hussein and to prepare the American people for the possibility of war in the Gulf. Ironically, now that military confrontation has become more inevitable, the decision-making consensus has begun to split. The \No More Vietnam\ sentiment is beginning to influence people raising questions such as: \Should our boys really be fighting for the survival of Kuwait and so that US petroleum interests are protected?\ On the flip side, the hawks believe that if Hussein's military machine, e~pecially his nuclear production facilities, goes unharmed then Saddam will pose a more profound threat in the future as he has time to rebuild and advance his war stock. Rather than only studying our own alternatives, we must also interpret and analyze the choices of Iraq under President Hussein. Hussein cannot afford to come out of the crisis appearing as a loser, since it This option is Hussein's military experts believe that as evident in the recent would jeopardize his stature as most optimistic venture, one American forces can and will elections, the length of a leader of the Arab world. which he might employ in the destroy Iraq within only a American threshold for any war However, Saddam can come case of a US offensive attack. week's time.

By granting $500 to the We Care About You Committee for the cause, the Forum confirmed its support for the project, which now waits for IFC to make its decision as to whether or not it will join the other groups on · · campus in supporting this cause. The Forum also passed the constitution of SADD (Students Against Drunk Driving). The Forum was impressed with the large · number of interested students and passed the consitution without funding unanimously. Additionally, the Forum discussed the newly implanted major/minor program at Union, and expressed its concern over the newly formed committee by President Hull to look into the housing recommendations made in the Middle States Report. In addition, Forum members continued to get signatures to pass .some minor amendments to 1he constitution. Lastly, it was brought to the Froum's attention that an ice cream social will be held for the sophomore class by its Forum representatives. It will beheld on Tuesday, November 27 from 8 - 9 PM in upperclass dining hall. The idea was well received and other class reps have indicated the possibility of repeating it for their respective classes.

She claims lhe inter-library loan system to be \fantastic.\ She feels that it is \good that one can seclude him/herself in a corner, or be surrounded by other stude11ls.\ Wendy also commented on the need for more convenient hours. There seems to be an apparent need for the library to extend its hours on Saturdays, being that it is only open from 9 am to 5 pm. When speaking to Dr. Maranville, he had us keep in mind that this is primarily an undergraduate college. When seniors begin to write their theses, they need to do a great deal of specific research on their topics, and will need information that is not easily available to such an undergradllate library program. College Librarian Ann Seemann thinks the primary need for Schaffer Library is an increase in the present budget. The library has a good staff and a good collection of volumes, \but has slipped over time in acquisitions. n One of the biggest issues is the physical plant. \The building is designed IJOorly and very crowded.\ There is no space, no designated current periodicals reading room, and the environment is very uncomfortable. There has been a committee that worked for two years, from 1986-1988, on plans to resolve the problems concerning student study space and collection space. The study ended in 1988, yet no action has been taken. In a meeting with Dean Underwo()d, he elaborated on the specifics df this study. Dean Underwood claimed that the first stage in plans for renovation has been completed. A preliminary committee, made up of administration, faculty, and stuc ents, ha..;; be..!n formed and has d~s·.:msed the three areas in whi.:h tht I ibrary 1 needs improve.11rnt. Tllc: first : of these areas is space for the ' library materials. Not only docs the library need space for IJcriodicals and books, bllt also for special collections, things th.at have be~n willed to the l college, and archives, the J1istoric31 collections located on . th.c fourth floor. Second, the committee recognizes a need ·f()r more study space; there is a ·lack of study space on the I campus, not only in the ltibrary. Third, work space for ·library employees is too cramped. For any changes to be made, . there is a need for money. Dean U11derwood informed us that tile school has applied for a grant from the National E11dowmen t for the . Humanities. The National 1 Endowment for the Humanities ' requires a four to one match on , their grant. Union has asked for ; one million dollars and if .-eceived will need to raise four million dollars. Though five .million dollars is a substantial 2rnount of money, it is only a ]Jartial sum of the money needed to expand/renovate Schaffer Library. The next step is to form a . smaller and more focused c<>mmittee that would discuss . the actual plans for renovation. · This committee would work together with architects to discuss the most efficient way to build space. Personally, Dean Underwood believes that Schaffer Library should be the highest on Union's list of priorities. It is a i recognized concern of the ··administration, faculty, librarians, and students that changes are necessary. However, at this point, no one . can say when renovations will ·take place.

Page 4 CONCORDIENSIS, November 15, 1990 FEATURES Boy It's Cold In By CARL R. FRIEDRICH, JR. A funny thing happened on the way to Carnegie one day, but first let me supply some background music. A note, please, ahem. A shiny Monday morning it was, and the wind was blowing up campus like it does so well.Some would say it was freezing, but me, a good natured kind of guy, was in a typically chipper mood on this extra crispy morn. So, Ia de da da da I went, down the path towards the home of procrastination (of mid-campus), Carnegie. When what to my wondering eyes did appear, a cute female freshman in heavy foul-weather gear. Being the kind of guy I am, and not recognizing her, I cheerfully said \hello to this person I wanted to know. But like the gale force winds that were freezing my face, she blew by me without a trace. I'm sure if I were standing in her path, she would have walked thru me for I, to her, was but a mii:age. Boy, it was cold on Monday, wasn't it? Ah, but wait, there is more to tell. As I continued on thru the blustery wind and wa1ked in the shadow of Science and Engineering, I passed yet another freshman of equal stature to the frrst Considering the last of my conquests I changed my theme. To her I said \Howdy how you doin'?\ She was kinder than the last, because at least she looked at me, and I read her lips, they said \Are you insane?\ This, for me, was too much to bear, and now, began to wonder, what was wrong with my hair. Beyond the building and into the light, came the view of Carnegie, shiny and bright. I hoped no one was in there, because though I am generally a happy fellow, it has been my A first-of-its kind national publication to which Union College students have been selected to submit their writing, will make its national debut Nov. 13 in Washington, D.C. The Wittenberg Review: An Undergraduate Journal of College Writing will be introduced during a reception for national media, congressional leaders, and members of educational organizations headquartered in Washington. It is the first national, undergraduate interdisciplinary journal. A special guest of honor, Edward Reed Whittemore, former consultant on poetry to the Library of Congress and editor of literary jollf!lals, will present the publication at The Woodrow Wllson House. The Wittenberg Review twice each year will present some of the finest research and creative writing produced by students at more than 80 of ~e nation's leading liberal arts colleges, along wtth some larger schools noted for outstanding teaching in the liberal arts. A primary aim of the publication is to infl~ence students who could choose to become wnters, teachers of writing, and professors of literature and the humanities.

I sat down at one of those groovy tables and started to read The People's Daily World, because I neededtosee a bigger joke than me. After not such a long time, I felt a soft tap on my shoulder, and tumed to see what else? Not just another freshman girl, but one who actually knew me. \Hi!\ she said and that's all that she got out, because then I started to scream and shout \Leave -me- AL-ONE!\ was all I said, but on her face was a look of dread Well, needless to say, she hi- tailed it out of there, and I laughed out loud when she slipped over one of the lethal blue tiles en route. It should be added that she hasn't been seen by a soul since. By the way, it's ninth week, and it's much too much cold to say hello to anyone.

Wine's alcohol content is shown by volume. Since the average bottle of table -wine is 11% alcohol by volume, it's also 22 proof. Beer labels don't show the amount of alcohol they contain. Most beer is 4.5o/o alcohol by volume, or 9 proof. Psychological aspects of drinking Most of us tend to adjust our drinking behavior to where we are, whom we're with. • A young salesman at a bar with a friend after work, may feel exhilarated after one drink. But when he has dinner with his boss the next night, one drink may have no effect at all; he's paying attention, keeping a tighter grip on his behavior. •One's mental set may affect reactions to alcohol. Someone putting on an act may overdo the effect of alcohol; someone showing ()ff about his capacity may be able to suppress the effects for a time (but not for long). •It's the uninfonned drinker who is more likely to drink t() excess. The informed drinker, who knows what and how much is in the glass, usually recognizes when he or she has had enough. And knows that no matter what's in it, a drink, is a. drink, is a. drink.

I \ CONCORDIENSJS, No'f'ember 15, 1990 Page 5 FEATURES Living With AIDS By ERICA FRANK Fmm The Oprah Winfrey Show to Union College, David Kamens led an assembly and appeared on the Bottom Line to share his .story last week. His goal was to instigate a wave of educated awareness regarding not only the mechanism by which the HIV virus is transmitted, but also promot- ing an understanding about the Jeality of living with AIDS. David's approach was candid and nonjudgmental. David had been dancing for eight hours a day during his last year at the North Carolina School of Performing Arts. Like every \normal\ senior, David's concerns revolved around work, parties and. conege applications. However, a week before his .eighteenth birthday. a diagnosis of AIDS changed tile course of his entire life. \AIDS was never something that I thought would happen to me.\ Although David was openly homosexual, his lecture emphasized the notion that AIDS can no longer be casually dismissed as a \Gay disease.\ AIDS can happen to anyone, at anytime. To illustrate bis point, he related a particularly startling vignette. David had been lecturing at a state university in the mid- west. After the discussion, two football players approached him and confessed that they had tested HIV positive. However. because they were not practicing unprotected sex and they were not gay, they were unable to trace the origin of the virus. Upon closer investi- gation, David learned that once a week, the entire football gathered together in the locker room and injected steroids. They all used the same needle, thus reinfecting themse:lves as well as each other. To date, David is certain that the football team has kept their secret from their friends, girlfriends and families. \The transmissio11 of AIDS' crosses all socio-economic barieFS.\ David also spoke extensively on the importance of being both comfortable with one's own body and honest with sexual partners. \Basically if you can't talk about. it, you shouldn't be doing it\ Another point David raised was the difference between confidential and anonymous testing. He indicated that the title ... confidential\ is often \Adjusting to de-Adjusting\ By KAREN BURNS As a freshman there is one immediate goal, \to adjust to college life\. In the beginning the freedom may be over- whelming. There is endless work to be done (for classes supposedly harder than high school) and more than enough time in the day to get the work done. The most difficult part is balancing studying and socializing (not necessarily in that order). Any rough times may be easily blamed on \adjusting\. lt seems to be the most logical explanation for just about anything: spending too much money, going out too frequently, missing deadlines, getting bad grades, eating too much etc... The grace period is generally the first trimester (including the six week break over the holidays). However, some daring students may use the excuse for the entire first year. The point is that the frrst year of college brings many new adventures. There are academic opportunities, social events, sporting events, new people to meet, etc ... It may be difficult to pass up a chance for socializing. The rationale is that something important may be missed if the engagement is not attended. Most students begin to think that there are only four years to take advantage of ALL of the new opportunities. After freshman year most people figure out what works for their individual needs. In other words. they \adjust\ to college life. The adjustment may mean going out one night a week or six nights. The social scene becomes monotono11s over time. If a party is missed it is not the end of the world, it is usually the same party every week. People tend to spend more time at home nbonding\ with close friends. The small gatherings are easier to deal with than crowded parties. A change of heart begins Senior year. this is the last year to take advantage of EARTH DAY • EVERY DAY NATIONAL WILDLIFE FEDERATION college life. For many the shock of the \real world\ is overpowering. At this point one must learn how to \de- adjustn from college life. This is done in two ways: constant socializing (since next year these opportunities will not be available) or the low profile route (to start maturing for the \real world\ early). Most seniors seem to implement a combination of the two plans. The \bonding\ with friends is crucial because there 'will be few chances to spend time with the same group of people after college, and \bonding\ seniors usually have the same fears about graduating. The four years of college seem to fly by. Most st11dents do not appreciate their college experience until it is too late. On the other hand, there may be too much appreciation in the beginning which runs out over time. The \adjustment\ and \de-adjustment\ tale time to understand. However, there are always new cllallenges as life goes on ..... 1400 16th Street NW, 'Nashington, DC 20036·2266 Celebrate Nov. 12·17 Mon.

In Schenectady, anonymous testing takes place at the VD Clinic at the City Hall Monday and Thursday, 5:30-7:30. However, regardless of whether the testing is anonymous ·or confidential, all clinics provide counseling. David's discussions targeted the imp()rta.nce of safe sex. The statistic:s be listed made it even more meaningful and startling. \At least one in every five hundred college students is infected '\Vitll the AID's virus. Therefore, there is a good possibility that at least five Union students are infected with the virus. Perhaps most interesting was the fac:t that David did not \look\ :side. His body was not lesioned. He was not frail. In fact, he could have easily been mistaken for a typical Union student. Without a doubt, that verity was the most frightening aspect of it all.

I I ! \ CONCORDIENSIS, November 15, 1990 Page 7 ~ [] INTERNATIONAL FEATURES International Student of the Week: Meet Claudia Ocadiz Garcia By CLAUDIA OCADIZ GARCIA I'll start off by introducing myself: my name is Claudia Ocadiz Garcia and I was born in Mexico City in 1970. I have three older sisters: Silvia, Elisa, and Nadia, my mom is Elvira, and my father is Javier. I've lived in Chicago, Illinois, Davis, California, and Ames, Iowa in three different periods ranging from the age of four to twelve. Now I'm in Union Colle.ge during the 1990-1991 school year as the Spanish teaching assistant. Being brought up in two different yet very interesting cultures and living in the U.S. has been a wonderful experience for me. Sometimes American and Mexican people speak of the other culture for what they watch in films and/or hear from other people and tend to generalize certain aspects, but I think that it's better knowing something before judging it. I remember being asked questions such as \Do you have skyscrapers in Mexico?\ or \Do you use silverware 1 remember being asked, \Do you use silverware when eating?\ when eating?\ At the beginning, questions like these really annoyed me, but then I realized that people showed interest for my culture and just wanted to know about it, so I changed my attitude toward this situation. Now I greatly enjoy talking about Mexico and, at the same time, I like to learn Mexico: Splendors of Thirty Centuries By CLAUDIA OCADIZ GARCIA I had the opportunity to see this, the biggest exhibition to leave Mexico in fifty years, which opened on October 10, 1990 and will be on until January 13, 1991 in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. This Mexican art exhibition is being held in other places like Lincoln Center, Morna, the IBM Gallery, Carnegie Hall and forty New York Cultural Institutions in addition to these (call 212-223-ARTS for more details). Three hundred and sixty-five objects are on view, starting from the preColumbian era (1000 B.C. - A.D. 1520) including the Olmecs, Mayans, Toltecs and Aztecs, with objects from eight archeological sites, followed by the viceregal period (1521 - 1820) with portraiture, liturgical objects and domestic furnishings The Neoclassicism ·and Romanticism of Europe are noted in 19th century arts, followed by works by · muralists Jose Clemente , Orozco, Diego Rivera and ~David Alfaro Siqueiros, ~.consecutively followed by B,artists such as Frida Kahle and :i Rufino Tamayo, who is still alive (artists born after 1910 ! are not included). ~ In addition to this, the '· Metropolitan Museum of Art : is presenting an audiovisual program in the Uris Center Orientation Theater, which examines the archeological sites and architectural environments and places the exhibition's works of art in context. This museum's hours are: Sundays, Tuesdays - Thursdays 9:30 - 8:45 P.M. Closed Mondays and January 1st. Thanksgiving Day, December 25. Admission if $3.00 for students and senior citizens; advance reservations required for a1 group visits; call (212) 570-3711. I invite you to see this monumental exhibition of Mexican art and welcome you to know more about my cultme, enjoy your visit. ..

Like everything else, both cultures have good and bad things, depending on our point of view and values. It's nice to · know the difference, learn from those we :consider good, and accept the ones we disagree with as facts. One big difference between Mexico and the U.S. is that the U.S. is made up of people from all over the world and the one thing that can keep them together is the fact that we are all human beings regardless of the nationality, religion, or cultural background. I do believe in people and think that everyone has the potential and ability to do anything we set our minds to; we just have to work hard for it and develop our talent I'd like to thank every single person that has made and is making my stay here at Union College so enjoyable. Even though I'm far from home and on my own for the first time, they've truly made me feel at home. I also thank my mom for being a very important part of my life and a daily motivaticn for me to reach my goals and really never give up. I love you Amita! '·~t ~~~~ t ; :·, -~ j' ] What Price Term Abroad? Courtesy of IntercolHage Press Bulletins For the first time, Bowdoin's Recording Committee has limited the number of students allowed to study abroad during the spring of 1991. \The number of request to study away for the 1991 spring semester has far exceeded the number for the 1990 fall semester,\ reads a letter sent by Registrar Sarah Jane Bernard to all potential candidates. It's \the hardest thing I've been called on to do since I stepped into the position,\ she said. \It seems unlikely that all requests to study away will be approved. Students wishing to study abroad only for the spring semester need to have sound academic . rasons to support their request.\ If every student's request to study away next spring was honored, the campus would have 200 fewer students on it · a number far exceeding )}ast requests. \Nobody likes to hear this, but a college is a business,\ said Dean Jane L. Jervis. \That's $200,000 tile school would be losing.\ Jervis added, however, \We are definitely not in heavy-duty financial difficulty.\ But not all difficulty is heavy-d11ty. Students who go abroad and are on financial aid are allowed to take that aid with them. And \if an above-average chunk of our endowment is being paid to the London School of Economics, or to the Sorbonne in Paris, it's not going to help people on campus,\ said Jervis. \It's certainly nothing the administration is at all happy about,\ commented Jervis. Included in this juggling act is the mattter of offering every student tile option to study away as desired, while also adequately funding campus facilities and professor salaries,\ Jervis concluded.

You got them: RSVP, croissant, and Perrier from France, taco, adios, and muchaco from the Spanish, glasnost, vodka, and perestroika are Russian, knockwurtst, weinerschnitzel, and schnauzer are German, and the list goes on and on and on. In addition, there are numerous English words and phrases which have infiltrated other foreign languages. Not just \Le Big Mac\ in France or \El Coca-Cola\ in Sapin, either. Ever hear of the Academie Francaise? I have. The Academie Francaise is a committee whose responsibility it is to maintain the purity of the French language. In other words, they are the French Language Police, blowing whistles at anyone who uses a foreign word in place of a French one. According to Professor Thomas, of Term Abroad fame, \'[Theirs is a] noble purpose, but they have little effect on · the French public. They are out By LARAE 'fUNIDAYEWICZ of touch with reality; you can't The exchange students were stop [other words from entering asked this question: What is Fench].\ After all, French is a ' the most outstanding pure language, an.d anything , feature at Union College which can easily be expressed that sets it apart from in other languages can just as your university a·t home? easily be expressed in French, right? Wrong. Let's look at a specific example in French. Jogging. It's a nice, dear morning in France and I decide to go for a jog. I tell my French hosts, and ask them how to say \jogging\ in French (I am, after all, there to learn). Their reply is \footing.\ Now, I'm no Jacques Cousteau, but I· know a wolf in sheep's clothing when I see one. So then I ask if there is a different, perhaps more French version to describe running at half -speed (or quarter-speed, in my case). After some deep thought, they decide, yes, there must be some way, but no one ever uses it. So, then, I am guilty of poisoning the French language by using and condoning the use of the word \footing.\ So be it. However, I'd much rather learn about hiissez-faire and sauerkraut and ukuleles and everything else than be closed off from other cultures in order to save a pure language from certain doom.

Page 10 CONCORDIENSIS, November 15, 1990 ENVIRONMENTAL Dolphin Alert By AMY DILLENBACK Have you noticed any difference on some of the tuna caas lately, such as a circular sticker saying \Dolphin Safe?\ Three major American tuna companies-Bumble Bee, Chicken of the Sea, and Starkist-all have announced they will no longer sell tuna that entraps dolphins in the driftnets. Even though these tuna canneries have enacted a \dolphin-safe\ policy, dolphins continue to be killed in tuna nets in the Eastern Tropical Pacific and in driftnets by the thousands. What is needed to protect the dolphin is further legislation to ensure that tuna products are indeed \dolphin safe.\ Currently, a loophole in the Marine Mammal Public Display Reform Act of 1990 (MMPA), allows the federal government to prevent a state from denying dolphin captures for any reason. They frequently grant capture permits for dolphins intended for hotels, casinos, and side-shows under a notion that they will be used for \educational purposes.\ The Dolphin Protection Consumer Information Act of 1989 (H. R. 2926 and 2044) was introduced by represen- tative Barbara Boxer and Senator Joseph Bidden and would require that tuna products caught using methods that kill dolphins to be labeled: \The tuna in this product was caught with methods that kill dolphins.\ This bill, in addition, mandates observers aboard vessels fishing in the Eastern Tropical Pacific, where the dolphins are often innocent victims in tuna driftnets. What you can do to help is to write to your representative and senators to co-sponsor this bill. Buy cans of tuna that currently have the \dolphin- safe\ label on them!

CONCORDIENSIS-, No.vember 15, 1990 Page 11 V\brt.h Saving, Give a Hoot By FRANZ LITZ Env.ironmental Editor An article in the Sunday New York Times Campus Section caught my eye this week. It was the story of a marching band at Stanford University that has been the cause of a number of controv~rsies due to its political satires. Most recently, the band was suspended from playing at one football game, after a performance at the University of Oregon in Eugene, in which the band criticized the endangerment of the spotted owl. The spotted owl is at risk, according to environmentalists, because logging in Oregon and the Northwest is destroying its natural habitat At some point in the performance, the band leader called out: \Mr. Spotted Owl! Mr. Spotted Owl! Your environment has been destroyed, your home is now a roll of Brawny and your family has flown the coop.\ The band assembled in the shape of a chainsaw and an owl face. According to the Times, the athletic department suspended the band from one game on the grounds that that act was \disrespectful\ to the Oregon community. Despite the punishment, the band made its point and made the papers. The band will no doubt continue its political satires, stepping out when the cause warrants it. The spotted owl was one such cause. . Do they really think they make a difference? According to a poll taken by the National Student News Service (NSNS) across 50 4-year colleges and universities, 4& percent agree strongly that students can make a difference when it comes to protecting the environment. An additional 46 percent agree somewhat, while only 4 percent did not feel that students could make a difference. Across the country, then .• the majority of students feel they can make a difference. Where do Union students fit into all of this? If only we all knew. We have been branded time and again the apathetic student body. Students at Union tend to be cautious--too cautious--when dealing with administrators and professors. We are here for our educations, but oftentimes forget that we must educate ourselves, not merely receive it spoon-fed from professors. A greater portion of our learning should occur outside of the classroom. Only then will we discover the issues that raise our individual eyebrows; the issues that are worth fighting for. For many Union students, it seems, the environment is one such issue, but they feel as th01,1gh they do not play an active part or cannot make a difference. And so they don't make an effort. The situation is unfortunate, because, as the Stanford band demonstrated, students can be heard. And as the NSNS poll indicates, students elsewhere are optimistic about their impact on important issues of the day. Union students! We, too, can be heard. We, too, have reason to be optimistic. Be active, and . join others who are active. Together we, too, can make a difference! SAVE THE DOLPHINS GREENPEACE P.O.

Congress Finally Cleans Up Their Act By SETH FRIEDMAN Mter a decade of debates and lobbying efforts, the Senate and the House of Representatives passed the new Clean Air Act. This landmark law is the first legislation since 1977 to propose sweeping changes in environmental policy. President Bush signed the bill despite huge budget problems. The new act is expected to cost industry and consumers approximately $25 billion a year once the plan is fully implemented. The goal is simple: clean air! Environmentalists, as well as all the people who breathe air in America, are very happy to see the bureaucratic foot dragging end and some progress made in the way of improving the air quality. The brunt of the costs will be placed upon utility companies and the auto industry. However, smaller companies like dry cleaners and auto shops will also have to do their part by investing in pollution control systems. Sulfur emissions released by power plant smoke stacks, auto. emissions, and fluorocarbons are the major causes of acid rain, not trees like our previous President thought. Even though the business sector will pay the price for their own changes, the burden will be passed along to the consumer soon afterwards. Higher prices for electricity and new cars, job losses, relocation, and possibly slowed economic growth for the entire country. The changes made will not occur overnight, but over the next ten to twenty years. The utilities will have to reduce sulfur -dioxide emissions by at least 50% and cut nitroge!l oxides by 33%; these changes will cost approximately $3 billion a year starting in 1992. Auto exhaust reduction win entail several plans. First, 60% less nitrogen ox.ide and 40% less hydrocarbon waste by 2000. Pollution control equipment must last ten years. Also, auto manufacturers must produce 1 million cars that use cleaner fuel to 'be available in cities where smog is worst! The consurner will be forced to pay more for gas, 6-10 cents, and $600 more for a new car. Other changes in the air quality will be the mandatory decrease in production of numerous toxic and cancer causing pollutants, resulting in increased prices for a variety of products. Finally, to stop ozone depletion, chlorofluorocarbons will be phased out completely by 2000. The costs are hefty for both the consumers and industry. However, not doing anything would cost more to both the environment and business at a later date. To place a cost on clean air and health is awfully hard to do. So the American people will have to loosen their tight purse strings because the new Clean Air Act is a great plan and worth every dollar. After all, isn't breathing good air worth some extra dollars? ~ Attention '()~ ~ ..,(~ •n<u<P 1 ~ All Students! 1~~ Middle States Report is available for all students to read from the following offices: Area Coordinator's Office Dean of Students' Office Circulation Desk - Schaffer Library The Middle States evaluation team will be on campus December 2-5.

Page 12 CONCORDIENSIS, November 15~ 199(} <nsnrorhtrnsis • ------Founded at Union College 1877--- Division I? Why? The U.S. Military Academy is considering dropping out of the Eastern College Athletic Conference's Division I hockey league. That would leave the conference with 11 'eams, and perhaps in quest of a school that could be added to restore an everi dozen. One of the schools being considered as a possible r~placement for Anny is Union College. Those people at Union who would make the .fmal decision should an invitation be extended ought to dismiss the notion right now. For hockey and other sports, Union is currently a Division III school. There are some schools that maintain their academic integrity while operating Division I programs, but others have been known to compromise their standards. The Ivy League schools are examples of colleges that maintain clean athletic programs within their proper context at the University. If Union were to become part of the league, it would be in the same conference as Harvard and Yale and the rest of the Ivies. It would also be in the same conference as RPI, a school that gives athletic scholarships. One would hope that Union would not succumb to giving athletic scholarships, but even it it did not, a Division I program would likely require more funds than are currently necessary. Travel costs for recruiting would inevitably rise, and it is conceivable that new and greater forms of financial aid would be needed to attract the players to make Union truly competitive. Union already had an encounter with the pleasures, profits, and perils of big-time athletics in the 1970's, and the college at that time showed the good sense to reject the idea. Ned Harkness, the fonner coach of the Detroit Red Wings, was brought in to build a winning hockey program and he did just that, but at a hi~h cost. There were players who had no business being at Union College, but Harkness continued to push forward in hoP,es of turning the Division III Dutchmen into an NCAA ]J<)werhouse at the highest level. Harkness wound up resigning because four of his players were given the boot from school for academic reasons. The rest of the varsity team quit out of loyalty to their coach. When a replacement team took the ice and performed admirably but with little success, hockey fans jeered, but many Union fans cheered the fact that a team of players truly representative of Union College was on the ice. Right now, the Dutchmen are one of the best teams at their level. They are exciting to watch and they represent the student body of Union College. What incentive is there for Union to go Division I? Sources say that there is a very good chance that Union will be given a bid to move up. Consideration to the matter by the entire school must begin right away. Don't Do It Again! Thanksgiving Break is fast approaching and with it is the possibility of shortened hours again at Schaffer Library: In addition to this schedule is the proposed hours of operatton for December Break. At present, Schaffer Library will be closing Wednesday before Thanksgiving at 5 p.m. and will reopen Sunday evening at 5 p.m. until 11 p.m. The library will be closed completely Thursday, Friday and Saturday. lf you planned on staying around an extra week or two during December Break to do research, be forewarned that the library may not be the place to go, especially if you planned on holding a job as well. Schaffer Library will not be open on Saturdays or Sundays during the month, and will only be open from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. during the week. They will also be closed the week between Christmas and New Year's Day. Where does this leave both students and faculty in tenns of getting work done? Not too far. The dramatic and unnecessary cutback of library hours harms students directly and indirectly, and banns faculty as well. Union's unique trimester system allows for a lengthy December Break (though it is substantially shortened this year) during which faculty conduct research and prepare for next tenn's classes. Many students also use this time to work on senior theses and research projects. Although Schaffer Library is often touted as inadequte, it remains the sole source of academic information on this campus. Restricting its use is one of the worst moves the administration could possibly make, especially in light of their attempts to \challenge and energize students\ (subcommittee on Middle States Reaccreditation). This case alone is a blatant indication of the mixed signals the administrtion is sending out to students. Fostering intellectual and personal growth of students are admirable goals for any college to strive to achieve. But the measures by which these goals are achieved must also be admirable. In this particular instance, the measures border on ludricrous. LETTERS Effort For America, Isn't It W ~rthy? To the Editor: \What election?\ was the response I received from an embarrassing number of people on my hall when I took a survey on Tuesday night. Thirty out of thirty-eight eligible voters on my floor did not use an absentee ballot to vote in the 1990 elections. If we, the top students in this country, did not vote, who did? We were the ones who were annually informed by our parents and teachers of the importance to exercise this hard won right, and yet, even with this knowledge and encouragement, most people did not act. Why? Could it be that the students felt that none of the candidates were deserving enough of the effort that it would take to vote? This question, in itself, provides the answer to the lack of voter turnout on two levels.

If Union and its many organizations had, perhaps, helped to publicize the election, its issues, and .the views of the different running mates, an awareness and interest may have been sparked which could have resulted in an increased use of the ballot. Even simple reminder signs put up around campus reading, \Don't forget to send in your absentee ballot,\ could have had a beneficial ·effect. The second factor dealt with the effort required to vote in absentia. In order to receive an absentee ballot, one was forced to plan early. An application for the ballot had to be sent out a few weeks in advance. Once one received the ballot, filled it out and paid the postage (which entailed bringing it to a postoffice to be weighed) 7 it had to be sent out in enough time to be received in one's hometown by election day. This process required plenty of forethougbt.and energy. Unfortunately, this cir- cuitous voting process is hard to change, therefore Union should focus its attention on inspiring people to want to take the energy to vote. Ideally, we should all think it a small cost to pay ofr our precious right to vote. Hqwever, most did not. As a result, the rigl:tt to vote, which was supposedly designed to represent all of the people, ended up representing only those who had a strong enough motivation to act. Hoefutly, in the future, Union can help to reach the ideal goal of our forefathers by making students more aware and thereby nurturing our country's voters and nobly benefiting America.

CONCOll.DlENSlS, November 15, 1990 Page 13 LETTERS Gulf Escalation Is Bad Policy! UnionGBAGL To the Editor: The day after election, our President announced plans to :send at least 150,000 additional reinforcements to Saudi Arabia, and not to permit any rotation of the 230,000 U.S. military personnel already there. I believe that a much wiser policy would be a substantial withdrawal of our ground troops from harms way, while retaining sufficient sea and air power to continue to enforce sanctions against Iraq. The advantage of such a scaled down United States presence is the fact that it can be sustained indefinitely, if necessary, or until the current highly dangerous situation can be resolved. I submit the following reasons why a bloodless resolution is possible, while an offensive against Iraq would result in unnecessary costs and casualities, and be damaging 10 our short and long range interests: 1. Saddam Hussein has been generally judged to be ruthless, but rational, and will choose survival over suicidal actions. 2. It is now demonstrated that oil from Iraq and Kuwaitis not needed. The world has a growing oil glut, which is a, result of increased production fr9m Saudi Arabia and Iran, along with some higher price induced conservation. Thus, while Iraq has suffered a total loss of oil revenues, Iraq's adersaries are reaping a huge windfall from Iraq's aggression. 3. Saudi Arabia and Iran are ·using these oil profits to buy more arms which represents a serious new threat against Iraq. 4. The United States has been able to form unpre- cedented alliances with other Arab countries to contain Iraq, but these alliances will not support an offensive against another Arab state. 5. Loss of Arab cooperation would also seriously diminish future possibilities for peaceful resolution of the Palestinian problems. 6. The United States has been able to obtain solid United Nations support for defensive actions against Iraq, and such cooperation is a realistic possibility for settling other problems of war and peace, but the United Nations will not provide solid support for an attack against Iraq, and future opportunities will be To All Union Ambassadors: We would like to thank all the people who came in to make phone calls last week. The Phone-a-thon was a success and we appreciate the efforts made by the Ambassadors who participated. We look forward to increased success this coming spring.

Iraqi chemical and nuclear weapon potential is good cause for concern, but it should also be understood that chemical weapons are inherently ineffective offensive weapons, and any nuclear capability would be limited, and thus such use would certainly be suicidal for Iraq, and the only credible use of these weapons would be as a desperate counter attack. Accordingly, it is clear that the sanctions taken by a unified world against Saddam Hussein are working toward forcing a peaceful withdrawal of Iraq from Kuwait, along with new opportunities for a lasting Middle East peace and tilroughout the world, and only a misg11ided military offensive can reverse these new opportunities.

To the Editor: As a graduating senior this term I would like to wish GBAGL to you all-that is \good bye and good luck\ for those who have never seen Dick Albert's weather forecast on WCVB-TV 5 in Boston on weekdays at 6 p.m. and 11 p.m. I'd like to wish everybody .good luck in this exciting time of our lives-from the new President Roger Hull, the trustees, administration, alumni (-ae), faculty, staff, students, families, and friends. (I have emphasized staff because their opinions are essential in the overall improvement of UHion so that all parties of the Union community can be happy and be forward, open and h(Jnest with each other). We are all important voices and should all be listened to in this peri()d of transition and self- identification. I am very impressed with the people that are caring enough to step forward and start the dialogue and I hope we can all end up fulfliled in the end. If you permit me the correlation, I wish such forward, open, and honest communication were possible in the Persian Gulf Crisis as we exercise and/or exhaust every last diplomatic solution before we engage in actual combat. Then we can get back to issues just as, if not more than, important like Central America, racism, sexism, AIDS, South Africa, international and national Jewish (or Hebrew) solidarity, other minority solidarity organizations, the international and national economy, drugs and alcohol, drug traffic, and the like. It is just a matter of basic human relations- Saddam Hussein has lost some very close friends already like the King of Jordan.

.. CONCORDIENSIS, November 15, 1990 Page 15 ARTS & ENTERTAINMENT You Showe~d Us You're Good. For N~othing By ANDREA SLADE ants were quite entertaining. Last Thursday, on November 8th, the 6th Annual Public Speaking Contest took place in the Upper Class Dining Hall. There were nine finalists selected from three evenings of preliminary competition. Each contestant had 30 seconds to think about a quote selected at random from a hat, and then 3 minutes to speak about that quote. The presentations were judged by four categories, including: creativity, coher- ence, substance, and delivery. The evening was well attended, as this is considered the biggest non-alcoholic ev~nt on campus. All in attendance seemed enthused-the contest- Though some spoke on a serious note, the audience, glad that it wasn't them, was still happy to listen. The winner was Senior Ellen Matloff, who received a $150 check. Senior Andy Salem came in second, receiving a $100 check, and Tom Fallati, a Junior received a $50 check for third place. Many thanks go out to all who participated, all the judges, and everyone who came out to support and hear their fellow students speak. It's not as easy as you think to stand up in front of 300 people and just speak off the top of your head. Maybe next year you'll give it a try and it could be you up there speaking! !

Cole Porter's \Anything Goes\ At Proctor's The good ship S.S. American steams up the Mohawk and lands on Proctor's stage, Thursday, Nov. 15, with the funniest and wackiest crew afloat. ANYTHING GOES, Cole Porter's fabulous fantasy of life aboard a luxury liner, made its maiden voyage over half a century ago and has cruised into musical history, tying audiences in knots of laughter as nautical mayhem rides the waves. The show's revival at Lincoln Center two years ago caused New York reviewers to dub the musical \the nearest thing the 20th century ever got to Mozart\ and \ ... for sheer verbal magic, Porter's lyrics surpass even such theatrical giants as Lerner and Sondheirn.\ Flying tlle flags of three Tony Awards, Drama Desk and Outer Critics Circle Awards and the 19S8 Fred Astaire Award, ANYTIIING GOES is awash with romance and intrigue. There's plenty of singing and hoofing, too, all to such wonderful Porter tunes as \I Get A Kick Out of You, II \You're The Top\ and \Blow Gabriel, Blow\. It's a rollicking round of mistaken identities, mis- matched lovers and shipboard shenanigans as British noblemen, American gangsters, socialites, Chinese mission- aries and a lady evangelist- turned-nightclub-singer, prome- nade on deck. It's a show critics say is \ .. .likely to be the best musical on Broadway for years to come II. So be sure to be on board when The S.S. American drops anchor at Proctor's and take part in this special brand of maritime madness. Slovak Chamber Orchestra At Union Courtesy of Union College The Slovak Chamber Orchestra, under the direction of Bohdan Warchal, will perform to include music by Handel and Vivaldi on Sunday, Nov. 18 at 7 p.m. at Union College's Memorial Chapel.

When it premiered at P.S. 122 in New York earlier this year, Mac Wellman's extraordinary comic monologue, Terminal Hip, very soon established itself as one of the hits of the 1990 off- off-Broadway Season. PROCTOR'S TOO is proud to announce that Stephen Mellor, who drew rave reviews in the original production, will bring Terminal Hip to Schenectady on Thursday, November 29; Friday, November 30; and Saturday, December 1. It is ·almost impossible to describe Terminal Hip. To say that it is a play ON words or a play OF words massively understates Mac Wellman's brilliant verbal pyrotechnics.

English language, then Terminal Hip would be the anchor ride. Stephen Mellor (whom the Village Voice called \the quintessential hyped-up, hollering actor\) is like a hipster version of Professor Irwin Corey, who delivers a doubletalk lecture as if he were the world's greatest expert. Exactly what he says is unclear; but as the New York Times observed, \if ·the play is a 'maniacal hubbub', it is a literate, hilarious hubbub.\ Terminal Hip won TWO \Obie\ Awards (Off-off- Broadway's Tony)-- for Best Play and Best Actor. Stephen Mellor appeared on Broadway in Big River; off- Broadway in Tooth of Crime; Harm's Way at LaMama and Talk Radio for the New York Shakespeare Festival. In addition to his Obie for Terminal Hip, Mac Wellman also won the award for his play, Crowbar. Other New York credits include productions of Cleveland, Cellophane, and Dracula. He was commissioned to write W'hirli-gig by the New York State Council on the Arts-- and his play Albanian Soft Sboe has been produced by San Diego Repertory Theatre. Both Stephen Mellor and Mac Wellman are available for telephone interview (please arrange with Alan Bryce). Terminal Hip plays Proctor's Too on November 29, 30, and December 1 at 8:02 p.m. at the Nott Theatre on the campus of Union College. Tickets may be purchased at Proctor's Box.

Folk Singer Glenn Yarbrough to Sing at Proctors' A salute to the memories of performers like Harry Chapin, Jim Croce, Roy Orbison, John Lennon and a host of others will be heard at Proctor's when folk singer Glenn Yarbrough and The New Christy Minstrels come to town Sat., November 17 at 8 p.m. It'll be an evening to celebrate the songs and singers of the '60s and the music that was America. Listen-- and remember-- Glenn Yarbrough's familiar \Baby The Rain Must Fall\. Hum along with a parade of international hits by The New Christy Minstrels. The New Christy Minstrels have their roots in the last century-- when James Tyler was President of the United States and the West was still to be won. The year was 1842 and Edwin \Pops\ Christy decided folk music would generate new excitement if performed with the harmony and variety .of a group. Christy was right. And the New Christy Minstrels have continued that proud tradition all over the world, entertaining audiences everywhere and performing for presidents and queens. Over the years the Minstrels have appeared with most of the top names in show business. But perhaps· their greatest legacy has been the development of new talent: John Denver, Kenny Rogers and Kim Carnes are but a few of their legendary alumni. · Yarbrough has been a to:p soloist for decades, first witlt the Limeliters and later as a single. To date, he has recorded some 60 albums and innumerable top selling single records. A play, \The Women in My Life\. is currently being written for him, a half hour radio show is in the works, concerts . are scheduled and a European TV special is being filmed.

CONCORDIENSIS, November 15, 1990 Page 17 ~ ARTS & ENTERTAINMENT Les Miserables Better Than Bran - The WRUC In Schenectady Record Reviews LES MISERABLES, the musical version of Victor Hugo's epic masterpiece that makes history come to life, wiLl return to Proctor's by popular demand Wednesday, Nov. 28 through Sunday, Dec. 2. LES MIZ, as the show is affectionately known, sold out when it played Proctor's last season and all ,indications are that it will be just as popular this time around. It is the story of the fugitive Jean V aljean and his lifelong struggle to escape capture by the legalistic and self-righteous Inspector J avert, set in the three turbulent decades of the 19th century French history. The logistics of putting the show on the road are astounding. Billed as the lar.gest touring show ever, eight large trucks move more than 1,000 props, 1,633 costume pieces, 50 wigs and a unique 34-foot revolving set (that keeps the plot's twists and turns moving right on cue) in arid out of the nation's theaters on a weekly basis. The staging, the music and the intriguing story lines, with their towering antagonists, give the production a cinematic sweep that is unparalleled in theatrical t.istory. A smash hit when it opened in London, LE S MISER ABLES, broke aU records for advance sales on Broadway and won eight Tony A wards, in.cluding the best musical in 1987. There are currently three natienal touring productions of the show which have played in ever 80 different cities. Intemationally, the show has played from Canada to Japan to Israel to Iceland, and as of March of 1990, it had grossed over $375 million world wide. LES MIZ has become Big Biz. It is a show unlike any other ever staged, from the teeming turbulent streets of Paris to the students at the barricades, down to the very bowels of the city in the sewers of Paris. It's a blockbuster of a show. A \must see\ for audiences of all ages. PROCTOR'S: LES MISERABLES November 28- December 2 Ticket prices: Wed.-Thurs., Nov. 28-29 at 8 p.m.: $37.50, $30, $21. Thurs.

The sound of a mandolin, an accordion, a violin, a pennywhistle going triple-time (as it does in \The Wake of the Medusa\) is as joyous and as intoxicating as their motherland, horne of the best whiskey. If only the entire album was as upbeat. When the Pouges slow down, it's apparent there s,imply isn't much emotion left in their tour-weary bodies. At least their sound remains as tough as lhe grisled remains of their livers. Further bolstered by former Clash-man Joe Strummer, songs like \Main Street\-- a pseudo \Downtown\-- keeps it rough. Even. though the vocal clarity barely reaches third grade Murmur, their music-- best described as Poi Dog Pondering with a Blarney Stone-- makes up for the \Mmph margle/yabble baby went to Ode To Unfinished Work By Carl R. Friedrich, Jr. c 1990 For a fleeting moment it came and went, And how special was the gaze we sent. -to each other and in that second, there were no others. Standing in the rain, And the hot summer's wane - in each other's arms, not letting the other break the bonds. No matter what I do or say, I am taken back to that special day -inches apart hair matted wet and the beating of our heart.

For better or worse, they continue to stumble in step. R.E.M.- Tourfilm (Warner Bros. Video) It's been over two years since R.E.M. have come out with .new material (Green, November 6, 1988). In order to pacify a growing legion of fans-- also to restore their creative juices-- the band pops out Tourfilm, a document of their three final dates of the Green tour. Listening to R.E.M. is one thing. Seeing them play is another. Culling songs from Document and Life's Rich Pageant as well as Green (Reckoning is completely absent) the four go through the tape with typical muted, unacknowledged brilliance.

Page 22 CONCORDIENSJS, November 15, 1990 <llvnmrbirnsis SPORTS Women's Cross Country Finishes Strong By SPORTS ST A'FF tear up the track this winter. Football Team Advances To ECAC Playoff On Saturday What a season! What a day! The women's cross country team rounded off a season of record breaking weather in Saturday's downpour. Each week the Lady Harriers wer:e more thankful than the last for the excellent conditions usually afforded only to dreams and Southern colleges. Then came Saturday. For those of you who supported our valiant Dutchmen at Hamilton, imagine doing it in spandex shorts and a singlet! Brrr! However, the women ran undaunted. The NCAA regionals brought some great competition to Saratoga Park and the Dutchwomen rose to the occasion. Senior Lauren \I am hurrying\ Karp finished off a strong. season with her debut as number one finisher for Union, placing 80th overall and running a personal best time of 21 minutes and 59 seconds. Next in the chute was junior co-captain Sandy \Hey those are my cookies\ Anselment. Sandy ran tough this year despite some adversity_ The team hopes to see her back to Senior co-captain Meg \Ruff! Ruff! Achoo!\ Parsons tried to run away from her cold, but it all caught up to her and she finished 89th overall to end an otherwise successful season. Junior Cyndi \electric slide\ Hunter finished 90th with a personal best time of 22 minutes, 34 seconds. Obviously all the dancing is paying off; too bad the team is losing her to a term abroad in Greece. Senior Kristen \please keep running\ Welch got a seasonal best time and placed 95th overall. The imagination nms wild at what she could do if she tried her stuff on the indoor track. Clare \Mrs. stud chugger\ Megathlin accom- plished her season goal early on and at this meet beat that \annoying group of girls\ as icing on the (muddy) cake. As the team looks fondly back at the season they would like to thank their coaches Jen and Dave, the men's team for their support despite the Idol incident, and Milce and Mike for uniforms .and first aid. Continued from page 1 place on the Champion Upstate New York poll behind once- beaten Ithaca and Cortland. The Bombers finished with 15 of the 16 frrst place votes and 79 points while the Red Dragons picked 1:1p 63 ponts. Union had one first place vote and 48 points while Buffalo State is fomth with 31, and RPI fifth with 19. Since giving up 13 points to Gettysburg in the final 2:53 of the fourth quarter two weeks ago, the Dutchm,en have pitched shutouts against Norwich and Hamilton. Against the Continentals, junior quarterback Brett Russ drove the team 48 yards in nine plays on Union's first possession where he found senior wideout Mark Callahan over the middle for a 22-yard touchdown. Very poor field conditions contributed to three missed field goals while a fourth attempt fell by the wayside when the center snap went over the holder's head.

This will be Union's second meeting ever against Plymouth State. The last time they met was on November 17, 1984 in the NCAA Eastern Regional Championship game. The homestanding Dutchmen topped the undefeated Panthers, 26-14. It was Union's second appearance in the NCAA tournament and the first, and only for Plymouth. The last time the two teams met, Union had the task of trying to stop senior tailback Joe Dudek. He came into the game, and still holds the records, as Division III's all- time leading scorer as well as the division's all-time career rushing leader. Dudek, who holds the NCAA Division career record of 5,570 yards, 76 rushing touchdowns, and 474 points, was held to 65 yards on 13 carries on that November day in 1984. He broke free for a 52-yard .scamper on his third attempt but was held n check for the rest of the game. He did score on a one-yard run that gave Plymouth a 7-0 first· quarter lead and later he caught a seven-yard touchdown pass to cut Plymouth's defiCit to 20-14 with 4:38 left in the third quarter. However, he was stoppped for minus five yards on three carries on the second half. This time around the Dutchmen will have to stop the Panthers' potent air attack. Senior quarterback Matt Jozokos (6'0, 200) holds all of Plymouth's passing records. Since:t:aldng over in the second game of his freshman season, J ozokos has led the Panthers to a 36-4-0 record, three New England Football Conference Championships, an ECAC crown, and an ECAC runnerup spot. Jozokos, who is a two-time Pizza Hut All-American, a two-time All-NEFC, and an All-ECAC selection, has completed 527 of 1,003 passes (52.5%) for 7,658 yards (191.5 per game), and ECAC-record 95 touchdowns with only 39 interceptions. This season Jozokos has completed 126 of 254 passes (49.6%) for 1,586 yards, 28 touchdowns, and just six interceptions.

For his outstanding effort between the pipes, White has been selected as the Concordiensis Sports Athlete of the Week. When the 1990-91 hockey season began, White had seen a total of under 36 minutes of varsity action in backing up Ron Kinghorn each of the last two seasons. In the first two games this season, he has already doubled his career minutes. playing the entire 60 against Babson and filling in for Jim Helkie for the final 20 in the 6-5 loss to Elmira. White has also gained his first two decisions in the first two games. In the opener, he came in with Union down by a Shayne White score of 5-2. Union rallied to tie the score, but Elmira scored a late goal to win the game. White, who was credited with the loss, stopped eight of the nine shots he faced, givin.f!; a very strong performance in relief against the top-ranked :team in the ECAC's Western Division. He beat Babson, one of the top teams in the nation after losing only 4 games all of last season, for :his first win on Saturday. White's goals against average stands at 1.51 a game after 79:13 of action. He has stopped 43 of 45 shots on goal for a whopping 95.6 percentage. The Skating Dutchmen hope that White's quick glove and solid stick can keep the puck out of the net as they strive to improve upon last season's 16- 8-3 record. Congratulations to Shayne White, this week's recipient of the Concord- iensis Sports Athlete of the Week Award Bad Weather A Big Factor For Men's Cross Country By GREG BARRETT This past Saturday, the Union College Men's Cross- Country Team hosted the 'New York State Regionals for the NCAA Qualifier. They were held at Saratoga State Park. The weather left a lot to be desired. as it was cold, wet, rainy and just generally miserable. The course had been turned into a giant mud puddle with treacherous footing. Despite the weather, twenty-six teams from all over New York took the line. Greg Barrett was the first fmisher for the Harriers skating through the course in 29:12. This established a new course PR knocking a minute off of last week's mark and was his seasonal best. Next in for the Dutchmen was captain Rich Zembek. Zembek was the second personal record of the day. He also knocked a minute off of h.is mark of last week, finishing in 30: 18 a new course PR. Ed \I need some sugar .. Rothenberg was third for Union in 31:13. This was Rothenberg's last race for the Harriers and he gave it his all. Junior Adam Reisman crossed in 32:14 filling up the fourth spot for Union. Rounding out the squad was Bill Taylor with a time of 33:59. The Dutchmen finished off the year on a strong note. They picked up several PRs in both of the last two meets by peaking at the end of the season. They will lose four Seniors this year: Ed Rothenberg, Doug Martocci, Will Allen and Bob Lindyberg. They were all an integral part of the team ·and will be missed. Good Luck Seniors! The Dutchmen would like to thank all of those who were involved in the meet. Without your support and dedication it would not be possible. Thank- you for braving the foul weather and coming out to cheer us on and run the meet.

I astWeeKs WJnner: R.ON EUGENlO Mouthing~ Of. . f Dy ANDY BRAVER . Sport Editor Adieu 1990 What a week it has been in. the world of sports. For once I have a multitude of topics to choose from. Unfortunately, I only have the space provided me in this column this week because this is the last issue of the term, and year. So, as I bid adieu to 1990, I want to give you some things to think about until you next hear from me. I have come to the conclusion that the use of the instant replay in National Football League games is a waste of time. When it was first introduced, I was all for it. In theory,cl still am now. But in practice, I want to see that stupid thing given a nice boot by Sean Landeta. The instant replay causes more problems than it solves. There is no question about it. Did anyone happen to see the Cincinnati- Cleveland Monday night game a few weeks ago? It was a fiasco, an embarrassment to the league. The referees were subservient to a foolish little man running a little screen in some booth high above the playing field. Take Sunday's Dolphins-Jets game. Miami intercepts a Ken O'Brien pass. On the interception return, a Jet player strips the ball from the Dolphin player before he goes out of bounds and the Jets recover the fumble. However, the referees missed the call and ruled that the Dolphin player was out of bounds when he dropped the ball so the Dolphins retained control. The play, because it happened so quickly, could have been called either way, so in comes the instant replay guy and his machines to make the final determination. He correctly ruled that the ball was in fact fumbled in bounds and therefore the Jets should retain possession since they recovered the fumble. This much could be determined from the reaction of the players on the field. However, 2 minutes later, the referees again overturned the decision. They claimed that an \inadvertent whistle\ had been blown, therefore ending the play. This nullified the Jets' fumble recovery and gave the Dolphins the ball, again . So, after 5 minutes, the call remained as it had first been ruled. It was the wrong call, but it stood. What was the use of taking the time to review the play if an \inadvertent whistle\ had been blown? Why have a replay at all if the referees can tum around and say that they blew the whistle and the play stands as called, even if it is wrong? I believe that the replay has gotten out of hand in its present state and it really doesn't help the game. Getting rid of it would. The NFL made the sports pages again last week when Commissioner Paul Tagliabue said that he would recommend that the league move the 1993 Super Bowl from Sun Devil Stadium in Arizona. I am sure many of you have heard that Arizona failed to pass a resolution on Election Day that would have made Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday a state holiday. Because of this, Tagliabue believes that the Super Bowl should not be played in the state. The idea in itself makes a great deal of sense. I can see how the NFL, which has a great majority of black play~rs, would not want to associate with \racists.\ But how can the people of Arizona be called racists because they don't want to foot the bill for yet another paid holiday. I am sure that business ownets in Arizona didn't want to pay employees for a day of work that wasn't done. Especially in this day and age, as the country plows headstrong into a recession, while Arizona's state economy has been in a recession since the mid 1980's. This, Paul Tagliabue, is pure economics, something which NFL owners have dealt with for some time. Remember, they continually try to cut down rosters and eliminate personnel from practice squads to save money. I don't think Arizona as a whole should suffer even more by losing the Super Bowl Especially since Phoenix and Tucson, cities that combined have more than 50% of the state's black population, have made King's birthday a holiday. Isn't that enough?? Enough is what Darryl Strawberry had with New York and its Mets. Last week, he signed a huge 5-year $20.3 million contract with the Los Angeles Dodgers, making him the second highest paid baseball player behind Oakland's Jose Canseco. The day after he signed, a few \unidentified\ ex-teammates of Darryl started blowing smoke about how he began drinking again last season after spending time in alcohol rehab last year. What a classless thing to do, true or not. Darryl doesn't deserve this from players who are afraid to come out from behind the \unidentified\ curtain. It seems to me like some guys are just trying to get back at Darryl for taking the money and running. Well, I would have done the same thing.

Both the men's and women's sw~lm Teams are off to good starts and are looking to s·tay out In front. The Skating Dutchmen look to find the net very often as they travel to Holy Cross on Tuesday. Swimming Teams Begin On the Right Stroke By CARL R. The men's and women's swim teams, after putting in a strong effort at the Unioll relays, took their show on the road · this past week, roadtripping t_o Plattsburg State, of all places. Both teams came away winners. The men's team, coming off a 5-4 record last year, opened their dual season in convincing fashion, winning 138-79. While Plattsburg was not a very strong opponent, the Dutchmen did not fool around~ in or out of the pool. The team took first in 10 of 13 events, and swept the 100 free. For the men, the strength came from the relay team, particularly the 440M medley relay, whicll took first and second. A strong performance was individually put in by Chris Yonsey, swimming the backstroke, and Adam Stein, who won the 50 yard free in 23.94. This very young team is improving day by day and Coach Bassett feels that with continued hard work, they will be going places later in the season. On the women's side, the Plattsburg meet could be considered a tune-up. The defending state ch:.unps won by the score of 160-52, taking first place in 11 events, and sweeping 5. The relay teams proved to be the strongest points on this already strong team, winning all the ribbons in the 200 free, and taking first and second in the 200 medley. The 200 team of Kelly Beven, Amy O'Neill, Jennifer Baldwin, and Kristen Eolbrook won in an amazing 2:02.71. Other fine performances were put in by junior captain Kerstin Dorse (one frrst), and Anne Glicksman (two frrsts). I could have gotten more individual info, but wasn't allowed into the locker room for post -game comments. Both the men's and women's teams will continue to compete in the coming weeks, and hope to fine tune their times for the remainder of the dual meet season, and the States in February. Upcoming meets include illtense rival Middlebury (Nov. 28) and the Union Invitational (Dec. 1-2). After that, the teams will break for the holidays, and after Christmas will spend eight days in Palm Beach. Not bad if you ask me! Coach Bassett feels that if the hard work continues both the men and women could go far this year. Take a study break: and come cheer them on as they shred in the Alumni Gym.

November 15, 1990 Skating Dutchnten Top Potsdam, Move to 2-1 By ANDREW SEEWALD and JARED SELTER The Dutchmen improved their record to 2-1 with a 6-2 victory over Potsdam Tuesday night. After senior Terry Campbell had been dominant on the score sheet for the first two games with seven points, the freshmen on the team tried their hand at carrying the load, and as they did they led Union to victory. Wally Bzdell had a goal and two assists, linemate Jeff Jiampetti had two goals and one assist, and Steve Battiston chipped in with one goal. Craig Ferrero and Dalton Menhall, both juniors, had the other two goals. Union outshot the Bears, 49- 21, for he game, but sophomore goaltender Jim Helkie earned his first victory of the season with a 14-save third period as the Bears offense came to life in the final session. The Dutchmen dominated the first two periods but led by only 2-1, until Menhall's flrst goal of the season sparked a four-goal Union third period outburst. The victory over the Bears wrapped up a three game homestand. The Dutchmen travel to Holy Cross next Tuesday, then will host Hobart the following Tuesday. Here is a report of Union's first two games of the season, a loss to Elmira and a victory over Babson: It was a slow start for the Union Skating Dutchmen when they faced the Elmira Soaring Eagles on Tuesday, November 6 at Achilles Rink. The Dutchmen allowed two early goals in the first period to fall quickly behind. The frrst of the two goals came after only 42 seconds of play as Elmira's Joe Spinelli, whom Union coach Bruce Delventhal claimed was one of the best in his league, blasted a shot past Union's man-short defense and between the pipes for an early lead. The next score came less than two minutes later and the crowd at Achilles was all but silenced. The first period against Elmira was not only a showcase for the players but the referees as well. In the first period alone the Skating Dutchmen were whistled for four penalties totalling eight minutes of Soaring Eagle advantage. The second Elmira goal came on a power play as well with Union's Scott Whitney sitting in the box. Union, however, did not allow their disadvantage to discourage them. It took the better part of the frrst period, but the Skating Dutchmen finally hit paydirt when Terry Campbell blasted the first of his two goals past the Elmira defense. The goal came at a critical time in the game with fan support waning and the team seeming to lose some of its remaining momentum and desire. Campbell's shot came just moments after goalie Helkie had been pulled to give the Dutchmen a one-skater advantage. Cambpell rocketed the puck with seeming ease from just inside the blue line to the right of the point. Achilles Rink rocked with the cheers and Union was once again into the game. The momentum of the game was definitely on Union's side, at least until the third penalty of the second period was whistled against Union. Goalie Jim Helkie, in attempting to clear the puck, flipped the puck over the boards into the stands, resulting in a delay of game call. In a scant 28 seconds, Union again found the puck in their net and themselves playing catch-up to a superior Elmira team. The spectators, already eager to lynch the officials, again took up their chants of poor calls and demanded that the referee be given the assist for the goal. The Dutchmen proceeded to seJf destruct for the remainder of the second period, allowing two full-strength goals. The third period opened with a change in goal for Union as junior Shayne White stood between the pipes to try and stem the tide of goals flowing from the Soaring Eagles. White stopped virtually all that came near him, stifling power plays and breakaways alike. Union, in the third period, finally cam~ together as a team, skating better, playing better team defense, and executing crisper passing patterns. The result was a proliferation of goals at the other end of the ice. At nine minutes and twelve seconds into 1 the third period, Union' Bill Railton put one in the Soaring Eagle net with an assist from Campbell on a power play. That goal set the tempo for the last period as Campbell collected his second goal of the night on a cannon .from virtually the same spot at which he scored his frrst goal. Campbell's score brought the Dutchmen within one goal and set the stage for the fifth and final goal of the night with five minutes and twenty seconds to play. Perhaps the game was not one that Union was fated to win, perhaps poor play early cost Union the game, but in either case, Elmira's Spinelli again struck suddenly at 17:19. The goal was the only one allowed by White, who shone brilliantly in net for the Dutchmen. The goal shattered the team's momentum and comeback and sent them to the showers with a loss that was so close to a victory. Delventhal, however, was not entirely disappointed with his team's performance. \I'm happy with the way we came back, II Delventhal said. Elmira, according to Delventhal, is one of the premier teams in the ECAC and showed its strength as the Eagles beat Oswego 13- 1. Delventhal was disappointed with the team defense as a whole and the performance of some of the upperclassmen on the team. In the Babson game, Union, according to Delventhal, played better as a team, forechecked better, and took better advantage of the power play. The result of the improved play was a 5-1 victory for the Skating Dutchmen against a team Union has never previously defeated in the regular season. \More people played well, and that is why we won, 11 Delventhal said. Goals in the Babson game came from Campbell (2), Whitney (1 ), Cregan (1), and Ferrero (1). I !:
