The campaign is to be held Wednesday and Thursday, April 9 and 1 0, from 9 AM to 4 PM in the college center atrium. Established in Panama in 1946, the School of the Americas was initially designed to promote po- litical stability in Latin America. Over the years, however, SOA graduates have earned themselves a reputation for committing bru- tal atrocities against humanity. Over two-thirds of the officers cited for the worst crimes in El Salvador's civil war, for example, were alumni ofthe school. Gen- era! Manual Noriega, formeT Panamanian president, also graduated from SOA. Now located in Fort Benning, Gem;gia, the school uses Ameri- can taxpayers' money to train fu- ture war criminals. According t<l a Pentagon report, SOA' s <>pet· ating e:x;penses are$18.4 million· a year. It trains 700 to 2,000 sel- diers every year in such areas as commando tactics~ sniper fire, and even physical torture. It has been said that the schoo I instrllcts its soldiers to intimidate and sup- press the Latin American pe{,)ple; in order to keep them from advo- cating human rights. According to Jody Mousseat~, president of Union's Amnesty In- ternational chapter, the shutdown of the school is an important is~ sue. '<A couple of years ago, there was a vote in Congress to shut it down,\ says Mousseau. \It failed, and now they're bringing it up .again, because it's really against American ideals to have some- thing like this open.\ This particular letter-writing campaign represents the second of recent ones sponsored by Am· nesty International. During win- ter term, Amnesty International organized a campaign to free Hein Dihn Phan, a Vietnamese politi- cal prisoner whose son Minh is a graduate student here at Union. The campaign was a successful one, generating over 1 ,200 letters written on Phan 's behalf. Likewise, the crusade to shut down School of the Americas is drawing support from many par- ties. Mousseau says that \a lot of people who aren't members [of Amnesty International] are help- ing out with it.\ Deconstruction Update Dig That Library by Stephanie Slobotkin News Editor study space,\ said Jean Sheviak, acting Library Director. The next major step, pile driv- ing, which is scheduled to begin on Monday, April 14 will add some head pounding. music tothe library vicinity. According to·. 2001 by Bltayani Meduri Staff Writer If you've noticed a lot of new, unfamiliar faces around cam- pus this week, it's because April has unofficially become desig- nated as Accepted Smdents' Month. Admissions is working over- time, even staying open on Sundays, to accommodate the large number of prospectives who will be swamping Union and other · campuses across the northeast area for the next few weeks. Dan Lundquist, Dean of Admissions, believes thatthis is a very important time for the college. Union is in stiff competition with other small, liberal arts schools such as Hamilton and Skidmore, and Unian is only a step away from joining the ranks of such prestigious schools as Dartmouth and Middlebury. He stated that, \the only thing separating us from them is that they attract more higher caliber students.\ However, this has been changing over the past few years due to new programs and plans implemented by Admissions. These include targeted travel across both the country and elsewhere in the world to spread the name of Union. Admissions also holds guidance-counselor training sessions so that they will be better equipped to describe the many opportunities Union has to offer. The result of this outreach was a net increase in the applicant pool by over 1 ,500 applications over the past four years. The increase has allowed the admissions committee to become more selective in choosing next year's freshmen class. Only 50% of the applicant pool was accepted this year. This is down by four percentage points from last year and was done to appease both th~ faculty and the Residence Life office. Lundquist says that this year's group of accepted students is more diverse than in past years, in accordance with his goal to \make the student body a little bit more diverse every year, so as not to upset the cultural balance ofthe school.\ He believes that if a good percentage of those who were accepted choose to come to Union, \ . _. they will add an element of spice to the campus body.\ Lundquist believes that the faculty and student body are do- ing a great job of showing the prospective students all of the wonderfulaspects of life at Union. He also states thatthe strength of next year's freshman class is largely dependent on both the activities of the Admissions Office and the enthusiasm of the . campu,s body. Lundquist says he is very excited \about the slow but upward mo've'ahead\ of Unio'n admissions .. , ' • 1 , 1 , , ~, 1 , I , ' , , ~, Don't take out your ear plugs just yet Although the demolition phase of the Schaffer Library con- struction is almost complete, the pile driving has yet to begin, and that phase will do more than cre- ate a few vibrating shelves.

Thus far, the librarians and staff say that the noise has not been too overwhelming, and there have only been a few complaints from students regarding the amount of time it takes to retrieve a book from storage. Also, the slight shaking of the building and occa- sional bouts of dust and water leaks during the demolition pro- cess only caused minor disrup- tions to students and staff Ear plugs are offered at the front entrance of the library to help al- leviate any noise that may disturb those with a need for complete si- to use the library as their chief study area due to the constant vi- bration, as observed by the librar- ians. The staff also noticed that even fewer students came to w<Jrk there at night, even though C()n- struction hours only range from 7:00 AM until 3:30 PM They speculated that this lack of stu- dent presence is due to the loss of the Mezzanine study area tllat used to occupy the second floor. \Somepeoplehavefound the Phi Beta Kappa room on the third floor a good place to study-. We put some furniture from the old periodicals in to -allow for more Shafer said that although the superstructure of the regular concrete building crumbled easily, there was a mud matte thirteen inches deep. They still have to solve the water prob- lem, which is more complex than they had anticipated because it is difficult to extract water from clay. Shafer confirmed that pile- driving will be disruptive and loud. Updates on construction will continue to be announced on the construction home page, library home page, on the white board in the library lobby, and through the Chronicle.

I Beta Loses Its Charter by Stephanie Slobotkin News Editor On Saturday, April 4, The Concordiensis received the ad below from the Administrative Office of Beta Theta Pi National. Upon speaking with their na- tional representative, Jack Carter- North, the information was con- firmed. However, he refused to send the news in the form of a press release. \It was a family matter,\ he stated. The brothers of Beta Theta Pi of Union College responded to the issue and were compliant with the basis of the ad. They con- firmed that due to fi.nancial troubles a debt had accumulated from previously graduated mem- bers, causing their charter to be revoked on January 17, 1997. This debt is in the process of being resolved, according to all of the brothers. They also said that they plan to get their chapter back next year if all fiscal responsibili- ties are met. \We're on good standing with National, except for our debt,\ said one brother ofthe Beta Theta Pi Fraternity. The administration has been made aware of Union's chapter of Beta Theta Pi's situation, and the fraternity has been more than cooperative in attempting to re- solve the issue. Beta Theta Pi Fraternity regrettably an- nounces that its chapter at Union College was closed effective January 17, 1997. No further activity by the chapter is authorized.

- Dual Support in the Spotlight: by Stephanie Slobotldn News Editor The Chets Committee will be holding a Fashion Show of Sup- port on April 11 at 8:00p.m. in Upper Class Dining Hall. The cost will be $3, and all proceeds go to Make a Wish Fmmdation, which grants children wishes that they thought would n~ver come true. This past week, coordina- tors of the show set up a table in the center of the Reamer Campus Center to raise as much money as possibl.e for the children, to add to the amount that they make at the show on Friday. \The table is meant as another positive outlet to make more money so we can help as many children as possible fulfill their dreams,\ said David Kanfer, a junior and co-director of the show. Students have been show- ing their support of the cause as Fashion Show is Coming evidence of the number of stars posted on the bulletin board above the table.

Courtesy of Mandeville Gallery To «discover\ and to conquer, to combat paganism and to Chris- tianize, to trade goods and to profit from the lucrative traffic in human flesh--such were the mo- tivations of the coionists who ventured into the African conti- nent from the stxteenth to the eighteenth centuries. As a func- tion of their objectives, the era, and the particular African king- dom into which they journeyed, European soldiers, sailors, mis- sionaries, merchants, and exiled prisoners used various means to impose their will. At best there was persuasion and diplomacy; at worst, brutal and bloody repres- sion. Encounters based on a re- spect for the cultural structure and local customs in place were rare, not to say exceptional. These illustrations--drawn from travel accounts from the then- kingdoms ofthe Congo, Angola, and Matam ba--simultaneously translate and obscure European intentions in Africa. Created at the outset to illuminate the content of their accompanying texts--to in- tensify and enlarge the signifi- cance of the written word--this ic<lnography conveys an underly- ing spirit of political, ideological, and religious propaganda as much as it reveals the fundamental in- co!nprehension of the European mend when confronted with for- eign civilizations. Beyond reflecting obvious value judgments and European obsessions, however, these illus- trations draw attention to what would become a striking incon- gmity in European thought itself- -the rift between the supposed universalism of the eighteenth- century values and the increas- ingly inhumane treatment of for- eign cultures at the hands of co- lonial travelers. Denis Diderot (the coeditor of the 1751 Encyclopedie) underscored this contradiction brilliantly in a sting- ing rebuke to his own century-- «You are proud of your enlight- entnent; but what use is it to you?

Students from Wells House, Smith House, and Delta Psi Delta took on a large part of the cre- ation, compilation, and organiza- tion of the campus community service resources. Junior Jill Hirschenfang com- mented that many of the individu- als involved in setting up this of- fice are presently active in com- munity service, which is advan- tageous because their personal experience may help direct stu- dents to appropriate projects. Other students, inc:lud ing Maria V ianna, John Vem, Eric Depew, and Matt Cossey, also contributed a great deal of time and effort, without which the office may not have been open yet to serve the stu- dents that have already stopped in to research potential projects. Faculty members also commit- ted to helping out, including the \Friday group\ of Mr. Tom Frieberg of the Catholic Campus Ministry, Mr. Brian Canavan from Residence Life, Dean Alford, and Joanne Tobiessen. Alford would like to eventually see a van allocated to the office, which could be used fol'transport- ing groups to projects.2r<lund the local area. The main objective of the of- fice is to bring together clubs, groups, and individLials trying to find service projects with the off- campus organizations' involve- ment opportunities.

She stated that faculty and administration support for 4-1-4 is relatively high, and she asked the Forum for suggestions. The Forum was mostly in favor ofthe trimester system, though they wanted to know mote about other students' views and the actual calendar sys- tems before jumping to any conclusions.

Croce Contributing Writer Welcome to tny virgin experi- ence writing for our fine Concordy, as it is so l<>vingly known. Basically, I am here just to bitch. Lord knows, th-ere ate definitely too many things wrong on this campus about wllich we would like to yell, so sitnply let them go by. I am goingto try to find a different subject to speak out about every week and basi- cally really try to piss some people off. So, if you are of- fended by anything I say, I wel- come your harassment~ ridicule, responses, and any sort of fruit that you wish to bombard me with. Let's start locally here at Union. How many of you have a registered vehicle to park on this campus but more often t11an not find yourself parking very far away from your dorm or receiv- ing parking tickets for parking in an improper lot? I myself have received quite a few tickets for parking in im- proper Jots, because there are no spaces available for me to lega1Jy park my car. I actually went around and counted the number of available student parking spaces surrounding my place of residence and came up witll 51 spaces available for stu<lentpark- ing. Those fifty-one spaces are there to service Alpha Dllta Phi, Chi Psi, Kappa Alpha, Wells House, and Smith House. I would say that there are ap- proximately 150-200 pe<Jple liv- ing in those five places. S<>, it's basically the luck ofthe'draw that determines which one e>fuswill happen to get a legal parking space. Last year, l lived in Fox. House and received tickets there as well. That lot is continuously full, and unregistered cars are very often parked there. I just think that it is ridiculous to pay $15 for a parking permit and over $20,000to go to school here, and then to get a parking ticket for $25 because all of the legal spots within haifa mile of my house are . full. Meanwhile, let it be known that . if you parkillegally at Union you get the $25 ticket, but if you park illegally anywhere else in Schenectady, you get am ere $10 . ticket. Once again, Union has raised the price on Schenectady. My final tidbit is something very interesting that I saw while on the news during spring break. There was an editorial feature on a doll named Jeffrey, I think. He was supposed to be a ho- mosexual male doll, anatomically correct, of course, to raise aware- ness for the gay population. The doll was only available in some specialty stores, not in normal toy stores. The interesting part efthe feature was how gay men: them- selves reacted to the dolt They were rather perturbed at his ste- reotypical homosexual dress and attire. I give credit to anyone who wants to raise awareness on this subject, but this doll goes way beyond that. What is an adult going to do with a doll like this, I wonder? Since it is not being sold to chil- dren, is it going to become a collector's piece? An anatomi- cally correct homosexual male doll for sale in some areas of the country for around $50? I really wonder what people intend to do with this doll. Dress it ... ?

First of all, I watched a tabloid news program that trivialized an issue of street violence from my home country, ·Wales. It showed footage of the street fighting, and for show it added its own sound effects--'\boing!\ as some poor boy gets thumped, \splat!\ as an- other gets whacked. I could have been watching Batman reruns. The next channel showed glo- rified violence of another sort-- .. . WWF wrestling. At this point, it all seemed very funny. i changed the channel again, and this time my reaction was more serious. A group or people was discussing the suicide tragedy in San Di~go. Their views on why it happened . ranged from liberal to conserva- tive perspecti'ves, however, and horrifyingly, they all foun9 some- thing to laugh at. \61% of rapes are com- mitted against women under 18.\ \Nine teenagers are murdered everyday.\ \This is not the 60s.

Jon Gasthalterand myself, Frank Rossi, xpected to put in along night at The Concordiensis. However, I did ot plan on pulling a long morning during my first week as.co-edito fthepaper. My original intention for this editorial slot was to write a mission . tatement about Jon's and my goals. Well, a funny thing happened n the way to this editorial box. I was going to write how it was my intention to be an editor \with heart.\ I am the kind of person that does not revel in someone else's ain, and I was going to explain how I would try to be a fair and bjective editor. Then, when that ad on Page 3 (Beta) came in, a umber ofquestions came up in The Concordy office. As you can· · ee, the ad was printed, but I believe that it was in the best possibl ight. Let's sit back and look at that ad. Some people suggested that i. un alone, without giving the brothers of Beta a chance to explain heir end. Go back to Page 3 and ask yourself this question: Wha ould my reaction be to that ad ifthe article above it did not appear? hat is the question I asked myself on Sunday when the ad came in. n this period of questionable fratemity support by the administration, ne would very easily jump to the conclusion thatthe Beta brothers erformed an act of extreme horror. As you read, it was anythingbu xtreme. Because of the time conflicts with the rink article and the various ther snags we ran into this week, I felt that time needed to be taken o prepare a story along with the Beta ad. We had plenty of other ads which do not refer to a three-month old topic) to place in ou ewspaper, so I opted to wait a week on printing Page 3's ad. Tuesday, most staff members appeared to perform their duties as ormal. The problem was word got out that I (and other high-ranking taffmembers) had opted to print the ad with an article next week. e explained that we had time problems and questions about the ntire state of affairs. People threatened to post their resignations i he ad did not run. All of the uproar ended about five hours later, at nine o'clock a ight. I finally attempted (with our news editor, Stephanie Slobotkin) o get an official reaction from Beta. Some staffmembers believed hat the brothers did not deserve a response this week. I did. I am lad I did. You can call it news suppression if you choose, but I call it fairness. here is no rule which says that a newspaper co-editor cannot look efore he leaps. During my tenure as Co-Editor-in-Chief, this pape LL NOT, under any circumstances, become a tabloid. If I wanted o print dirt, like fishy ads, I would go work for \Hard Copy.\ So, because I stood up for my beliefs, I am writing this in front o he rising sun with only three hours of sleep in the last two days. Do mind? Yes and no. I mind because I was raked over the coals fo alf of a day for no reason at all. I do not mind, though, because I cted in a fair manner. That is my character, and it will not change. his is what you can expect from The Concordiensis during my tenure s co-editor. I guess I did get to write a mission statement after all!

Having said that, I am deeply saddened that the·Jast issue completed during my time as editor was marred by someone's poor attempt at humor. A student's name erroneously appeared in the security report. The report identified him as someone who was injured in an accident. For those of you who don't remember this incident, forget it, but for those who do, I would like to apologize on behalf of myself a.nd the entire newspaper staff. Again, I would like to apologize to the student himself and to the whole community, particularly the Campus Safety staff who had nothing to do with this unfortunate incident. I received a personal letter from Paul Mantica with regard to this matter. Mr. I do not believe that we had any Mantica expressed some direct responsibility in this concerns aboutthe state of affairs incident, I must personally take here at The Concordiensis. the blame for the incident.

Opinions The Way Spring ls Dutch Is Open Until When? by Jared Richman StaffCattoonist Okay, okay, what could I pos- siblyhaveto complain about this week, you ask. I mean, after all, look outside--it's spring term for God sakes and senioritis ought to be kicking in. Good point, but alas,. I gotta be me. In all fair- ness to my esteemed colleague Larry \PooperScooper\ Paska, this week's column will be an overview of both the good and the bad to come this spring term of 1997.

Clinton, N etanyahu Meet at White House Suzanne Dougherty Global News Editor This past Monday President Clinton met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House to discuss developments and progress in the Middle East Peace Process. There have been recent set- backs, however, and Israel has made it clear that they want to move forward with the talks and hopefully regain peace in the area and between the strug- gling nations. President Clinton was rela- tively happy with the meeting. \We had a very specitic, frank, candid, and long talk, and now we are going to talk to the Pal- estinians and see if there is something we can do to get this thing going again. We'll do our very best, and I'll' do my be~t, and that is all that I think we should say right now.\ Netanyahu told Clinton dur- ing their meeting that he would like to begin final status talks between Israel and Palestinian Authority immediately. lfthat does occur as planned, a pos- sible conclusion could occur within the next six months. Netanyahu mentioned to Clinton that he would like for the summit between Israel and Palestine to occur at Camp David and to be led by former President Jirnmy Carter. Clinton did not give a con- crete answer to this proposition by Netanyahu. He told the press that he would have to hold on making any commitments that would directly involve the United States. \I think that it is important not to jump the gun on that. I wouldn ~t rule out any reasonable opportunity for me to make a positive contri- bution, but we have to have the conditions and understandings necessary to go forward. The most important thing is to get the thing going again,\ Clinton stated. Netanyahu has been very happy with his relations with President Clinton. He called Clinton the \world leader,\ and he teels that Clinton has been making tremendous efforts to help both countries achieve peace in the Middle East.

The smallest things are the ones· that have the hugest effect on my daily life, and when my daily life is improved, so is my constitu- tion-with a healthy constitution, anything is possible. For ex- ample, if they ever put windows in the doors of the mailboxes in the college center, you'd never see me at our postal nerve center without a contented and apprecia- tive smile on my face. Although I've never had any,gripes with the mail service, I do find them lack- ing the innovation that I find in other areas of the college center- -namely, Dutch Hollow. Everyone likes getting mail, and I am no exception. However, I think that my appreciation of Dutch goes beyond that Though it was their unprecedented addi- tion of \Fajita Wraps\ and \Stroller Pitas\ that inspired me to write _their praises, I've always been a little awestruck by Dutch Hollow. It's not that their food is great. It isn't, and neither is their service. However, when you sleep through as many meals as I do, you learn to appreciate a cen- trally located restaurant, ope11. till 11 :30 at night, that takes your meal card. I'd write more about the quality and selection offood, but I always feel so guilty when- ever l criticize food. I'm sure there are thousands of people in places like Calcutta who would not only be content with, but would kill to have, six menu choices. Still, I can't shake the feeling that my choices consistof either chicken or cheese. So, in a move that's sure to please my mother, I won't com- plain abo!J,t the food. Instead, let's just say that ever since Dutch added two whole new menu choices, I've had a tough time keeping my excitement below the level ofembarrassment. As I said before though, this feeling ofela- tion is not uncommon for rne to experience at Dutch Hollow. Their \Fill in the Blank'~ signs, for instance, have provided me with endless amusement I love the way they make their classy laminated signs so that you can imagine your own endings to As promised, we are back in Now we're all back and ready really give the best impression full effect for another term. to party....

Recently, two senior students were honored for their success in Eastern Asian studies. As part of an international program whic·h sends aspiring young graduates to teach in Asian countries, Joe Quini and J.esse Karotkin were chgsen to partici- pate in a unique cultural experi- ence. The program, which allows English teachers to instruct stu- dents at various Chinese univer- sities, is funded by the Freeman Foundation and is administered by the United Board for Christian Higher Education in Asia. For the last few years, the United Board has been promoting an increasing awareness of the importance of recognizing the ties between this country and East Asia. The grant promoting this teach- ing opportunity provides for ten graduating seniors from five lib- eral arts colleges in the United States. The president of the United Board, Dr. David Virkner, commented on the attributes of the grant in their recent newslet- ter (New Horizons) saying that it \provides a wonderful opportu- nity to build greater understand- ing between people 'in the United Sates and China, while at the same time, meeting an important need in Chinese higher educa- tion.\ After applying, Union College was chosen this year to be one of the five participating member col- l.eges. The excellence in quality and diversity of the East Asian studies program at Union was re- warded by acceptance to this pro- gram. Seniors Joe Quini and Jesse Karotkin were chosen from a pool of applicants based on their quali- fications for the teaching posi- tions.

Page 13 • April 10, · 1997 • illlfL' illnnwrhiensis · · · . . Arts & [ntcriainmt•(lt Val Kilmer Takes On the Popular TV Hero, The Saint ''The Saint. \ Starring Val Kilmer, Elizabeth Shue. Directed by Philip Noyce. Rated PG-1 3, Paramount Pic- tures. Rating: ** (out of four) In the next Hollywood offering of a popular TV series resurrected for the silver scr-een, The Saint stars noted th:espian-nuisance Kilmer (whose on-the-set com- plaints make him a difficult actor with whom to work) as the spy popularized by George Sanders and Roger Moore in the past. In fact, it was Mot>re's contractual obligation to The Saint series of . the early l960sthatmade him un- able to be considered as the first James Bond. (The role, of course, went to Sean Connery.) The film version-updating the character and themes for the 1990s-· is a bland and tiring trudge through two hours ofsecret spy-capers. The Saint is pretty much a Jatnes Bond movie removed of every tra~e of spontaneity. The disco-flavored score is pseudo- Bondian, the woman is merely a California Bond girl, and the vil- lains (a billionaire Russian oil ty- coon and his Russian Mafia) seem like leftover characters sketched for a Bond film. If only the hero was as multifaceted and fun as Bond. Kilmer'~ only real abilities here seem to be in creating clever voice impressions and donning facial disguises which still give himself away. Simon Templar, a.k.a. any other name of a patron saint you can conjure up, is a spy who works for any side whjch will pay him. He !')teals a secret microcllip from the Russian businessman for $8 million~ only to agree to provide his \prey\ with the \recipe\ for cold fusion for $8 million more, to help the greedy Russian monopo- lize heating and oil in Russia. To get the formula, Templar must first sleep with an Oxford chem- ist, played by Shue, andtben steal the calculations from her. She then delivers a speech on the ef- fects of cold fusion as if she were reading the words off the back of Improvising Union by Gabriela Dory Arts. Editor This past Saturday AprilS, Stu- dent Activities presented the Mop and Bucket Company per- fonning ''Towards a More Perfect Union.'' Withottt a script or pre- pared dialogue, the company of six actors presented a two-hour performance of improvisational theater. The company traces its lineage to vaudeville star Connie Mop, who died last week at a nursing home for retired actors in Glen Rock, New Jersey. Mop originally trained as a clown and wild-ani- mal tamer, but later teamed with Edgar \Bucket Hom bee in a nov- elty act that featured fast-paced physical comedy. Their act was initially not well received,' and dur- ing one perf()rmance in Toledo, Ohio, one audience member sug- gested that Mop \suck eggs.\ Responding to the remark, Mop incorporated the suggestion into his performance by launching into a hilarious pantomime that later became notorious with his act, and progressively he eilcour- aged more audience participation in his act. Creator Michael Burns bot- rowed the name and style of ·Connie Mop for the Mop & Bucket Company so that \he would be able to work with the best Capital Region artists. The company relies totally on the magic of improvisational theater, using only a framework of impro- visational exercises to build scenes based on audience sug- gestions. On Saturday night, they pr.oved that this can be suc- cessful. Over 80 students and faculty gathered in Old Chapel to be en- tertained, often at their expense. The performance began with a short introduction, by creator Michael Bums, on the style of theater and the necessity of the audience suggestions. The first vignette was a story that began with a suggestion by the members of the audience. \Where? was asked. The \where\ was the Himalayas, and the \what 11 was cleaning toilets. Every once in a while the actors would pause and ask for audi- ence suggestions, to fill in some words, for example. The show was a cooperative effort, and the audience was-aware of-their par- ticipation in the success of the night. Audience members were greatly impressed by the perfor- mance. Although many people were skeptical that a whole per- formance could be based on im- provisation, almost everyone left convinced. According to some students, such as Jill Hirshenfeng, the most interesting thing \ ... was watching the actors create,\ which was apparent throughout the whole perfor- mance. The best part of the evening was the that the performance was free to the Union community. Hopefully, the large turnout will encourage more performances of the same nature.

Shue 's ditzy blond chemist is quick-witted enough to be the only human alive to track down the u11detectable Saint; in-of all pla.-ces-· a Rus- sian bar thousands ()f miles form her home. The ads show audiences ac- tion· sequences and clever spy stuff. However, the fihn really delivers a sideline romance that slightly works but ittcludes some downright ludicrous lines. For example, Shue's character takes heart medicine, yet by the film's c1 imax, when her passion for the Saint is realized, she discovers she no longer has heart trouble-suggesting her heart is \whole\ with him. Cute, but let's focus instead on tl1e intelligent action. While cleverly staged, the action sequences do not have the daredevil escapes of Bond films, although the film's harsh icy blue colors suggest Russia's frigid climate (I iterally and thematically), much as a Bond film would. Kilmer's performance is com- petent. The cinematographer, however, is invited to cut down on the caffeine, as the ji-ttery camera dashes to and fro and makes the character's mad es- capes seem frantic and difficult to follow. In the world of secret agents and Russian bad guys, James Bond still has the compe- tition beat, and The Saint's clos- est competitor, Goldeneye, is a more intelligent and slick caper.

Proctor's Too Presents Autumn Portrait at Union N 0 \1 A S 0 U T H E A s· T E R N U N I V E R' S I T Y ClJurtesy of Proctor's Theater If you think puppets are just for children, prepare to have that idea changed forever by the Sand glass Theater. Master puppeteer Eric Bass presents his compelling and unforgettable Autumn Portraits at Proctor's Too at Union College's Yuhnan Theater, on Fri- day and Saturday, April 11 and 12 at8:02PM. Called \a master\ by The New York Times, Eric Bass seamlessly weaves his imagination and craft with the art of Japanese Bunruku puppetry into tales that are haunt- ing and unique. Bass' unique fonn of puppetry brushes aside alI expectations, using his out- standing skill to tell stories that are universal and timeless. In each ofthe five pieces in Autumn Por- traits, a separate and carefully constructed puppet does a mes- merizing dance of delicate and pre- cise movements. They are characters in the \au- tumn\ oftheirexistence. The pup- pets themselves use tiny masks or transform their faces as they meet their past, their selves and their deaths. For most ofthe per- formances. Mr. Bass manipulates the characters in full view of the audience. While Autumn .Por- traits may be enjoyed by older children, the performance is in- tended for adult audiences. Eric Bass has worked in theater as a director, playwright, performer and mask and puppet maker. In 1980 he created Autumn Portraits ... which won First Prize for best pro- duction at the International Pup- petry Festival in Australia. His Sandglass Theater was founded in Munich, Gennany in 1982. The company moved to Vermont in 1986, and produces and presents shows for both children and adults.

.. A Tribute to Union's Swimming and Divin Teams by Frank Rossi Editor-in-Chief Here is a secret for you. Union is home to three national champions, two of which are graduating. If you ate having trouble, here is a hint. They make a splash around Union most winter days. Okay, enough with the bad jokes. Union houses a tremen• dous swimming and diving pro- gram. Swimming Coach Judy Wolfe took over for current Wil- liam Smith College Athletic Di- rector Susan Bassett. Ever since, Wolfe has helped to lead U11ion Swimming down the right lane. Justtake a lookatwhattwo Union women were able to do in the na- tionals last month (bottom story). Bassett and Wolfe both coached national champions Kevin Makarowski and Mike HL!mphries before their college swimming careers ended last month. Two years ago, Kevin won the 200-meter individual medley championship, and last year, Mike won the I 00-meter backstroke championship. In diving, Coach Maria Coomaraswamy has also had great success.

Union, which was the East Region's highest-ranking team, scored 283 points. Kenyon Col- lege won its 18th-consecutive national championship with 689.5 ·points. U.C. San Diego was sec- ond with 336 points, Denison was third with 303.5 points. and Wil- liams fell just short of Uni~n, coming in fifth with 267 points. Junior diver Brian Field (Pine Kevin Makarowski leaves Dutcl1men after a great career City, NY/Elmira Southside) turned in the Dutchmen's best individual perfonnance as he fin- ish~d second in the one-meter dive with 470.80 points. Field, who won last year's one-meter national championshi-p with 445.60 points, was dethroned by Wisconsin-Eau Claire sophomore Jolln Karpe, who tallied 497.30 points. Field also took fourth in the three-meter dive with 464.35 points. All five of Union's relay teams picl<ed up All-American status by finishing in the top eight. The 800-meter free quartet turned in the best performance by finishing sec(md to Kenyon with a 6:48.57 Senior Kevin Makarowski (Washington Mills, NY/New Hartford), sophomore Clark Smyth (Boulder, CO/ Westminster), senior Than Stuntz (Acton, MA/ Acton·Boxboro) and sophomore Jeff Haerle (New Hartford, NY/New Hartford) made up the team. The 400-meter relay team com- prised of Makarowski, Smyth, Haerle, and senior Mike ·Hq\nphreys (New Hartford; N¥/ New Hartford) was third with a 3:03.33, while the 400-meter medley was fourth with swim- mers Humphreys, junior Mark Anderson (New Hartford, NY I New Hartford), Makarowski, and Haerle. They posted a time of 3:23.72. Both the 200-meter freestyle, with Makarowski, Smyth, I-loerle, and llumphreys, and the200-meter medley relay, with Humphreys, Anderson, sophomore Dave Searles (Bath, ME/Morse), and Haerle, were fifth with respective times of 123.39and 1:33.33 Makarowsk i, who won the 200- meter individual medley as a sophomore and finished second last year, took third this year de- spite beating his national-cham- pionship time of I :52.77 with a I :51.46. He also placed fourth in the 200-meter freestyle and 13th in the 1 00-meter freestyle. Humphreys, who won last year's HJO~meter backstrok~ with a 50.69, took fourth this year with a50.91. He also placed fourth in the200-meter individual medley, seventh in the 200-meter back- stroke, and 16th in the 50-meter freestyle. Union's other individual per- fonnances saw Hoerle place ninth in the 200-meter freestyle and tenth in the I 00-meter freestyle. Searles took 13th in the 200- meter individual medley, 16th in the 400-meter individual medley, and lOth in the 200-meter fly. Anderson was 14th in the 100- meter breaststroke and 13th in the 200-meter breaststroke. The Dutchmen, who have won the last three Upper New York State championships, have placed fourth, third, and fourth in the last three NCAA events. With Only Two Swimmers, Women. Finish Tenth Best Finish Since 1994 When Union Sent Nine Swimmers Courtesy of Sports Information Senior Jackie Crane (Danville, PA/Mercerburg) and junior Meg McCarthy (Bethany, CT/Amith Regional) single-handedly put Union College on \the national swimming map this past weekend at the NCAA Division Ill cham- pionship meet at Miami of Ohio. The two women combined to score 97 points in leading Union at a tenth-place finish out of 56 scoring teams. It was the Dutchwomen's best showing since 1993 when Union placed a school-best eighth while sending seven competitors to the national meet. The Dutchwomen placed ninth in 1994 with nine women having the opportunity to score points, and the 1991-92 sea .. son saw Union place tenth with five swimmers. ''Their accomplishment is sim- ply amazing,\ said second-year head coach Judy Wolfe. \We fin- ished in front of some established programs who had more than twice as many women compet- ing.\ Crane and McCarthy combined to finish in the top four in each of the three events they swam while setting Union College records in every event Crane, who has qualified for the national meet in three of her fottr years at Union, was second in tile 200-meter freestyle with a time of l :53.23, third in the l 00- meter butterfly at 2:08.40, and third in the 500-meterfreestyle at 5:02.40.

Sp~Hts Dutchmen Rugby: Back With a Vengeance by Pike Mody Sports Writer As warm weather finally finds its way to Schenectady, the Union Men's Rugby Club is poised to begin their Spring '97 season. After missing the state playoffs by one game this past fall, the team has made some fundamental changes that they hope will fos- ter a more successful season. In the fall, due to an unusually high number of injuries, the team re- lied upon its freshll).en rookies to play on its A-side, an extremely demanding job in a sport that is often completely unfamiliar to newcomers. Although Union benefited from an experienced pack, it found that the inexperi- ence of its new 1 ine often changed the team's strategy from the one that boasted two all-star centers just six months prior. As winter approached, the team looked to add experience to its rookies so that they would be a force for the upcoming spring. As winter break rolled into ses- sion, 13 members of Union's team traveled to Las Vegas, Ne- vada to gain some \tough experi- ence\ against some of the biggest guns in collegiate rugby. With a team consisting primarily of rook- ies, as well as two players that Union \picked up\ from other teams in order to post their 15 man side, Union took on SanDi- ego State, University of Wyo- ming, and Colorado State. Being the only Division lii school in the tournament, as well as the only one from the East Coast, Union College found itself playing a level of rugby well beyond that against which they had played be- fore. After being crushed by San Diego State, they fought hard against Colorado State and Jed for most of the first half. In their final game against University of Wyoming, which was ranked Crew Leaves RPI in its Wake by Aileen Quigley Contributing Writer The crew team competitively kicked off its spring racing sea- son against local nemesis RPI last weekend from the banks of the Mohawk River. With the home field advantage and a rigorous winter training regime in their favor, the varsity women's open eight and novice men's eight de- feated their worthy, albeit slower, competitors, and ·the varsity men and novice women also gave their red-shirted rivals a run for their money. The racing format of the spring season are very different from fall races like the well-known Head of the Charles Regatta in Boston, Massachusetts. Spring races are 2000 meters long instead oftwo to three miles, and boats begin racing from a dead stop and not by rowing into the course. With the magnified intensity of each race, crews commit to endurance and strength training to develop the physical conditioning such a performance demands. The competition began at I 0:30am Saturday, starting with two boats of novice women. In spite of having just several days of water time so far this season and racing againsf'<novice\ boats actually stacked with varsity women, the Union women stepped up to the challenge. In the first race, the A boat finished just fifteen seconds behind Russell Sage. The second novice women's race against RPI was even closer, though RPI beat Union 7:34 to 7:43. In addition, the layout of the race course in- volved a sharp tum which, if im- properly maneuvered, can cost an inexperienced crew the race. However, the novice coxswains did an excellent job of harness- ing the power of their boats de- spite having only been on the water for less than a week. The novice men settled the score, crushing RPI with a time of 6:11. Ted Wallace coxed the winning boat and the lineup, from stroke to bow (front to back of the boat) consisted of Steve Eichfeld, Dave Brooks, Tim Lash, Rob Hoppenfeld, Adam Murphy, Cory Greenhouse, Jay Pyo, and Andy Martinson. Head Coach Tom White created this I ineup the morning of the race, strategically rearranging rowers' usual seat assignments and switching stroke from the star- board side to port. Nevertheless, this winning combination estab- lished an early lead and held on to it to beat RPI. Next in line, the varsity women's open eight also blew RPI outofthewaterin6:55. Be- hind the command of coxswain Katie Murray, Union was able to keep a controlled, powerful stroke rating thatallowed them to prac- tically walk past the RPI women. Rowers Caroline Nemet (stroke- 8), Susanna Ryan (7), Katie Ott (6), Margaret Sullivan (5), Jaime Bunchuk (4), Sarah Ahart(3),Jen Brady (2), and Neha Shah (bow) combined their physical strength with polished technique to sail past RPI to the finish line. Assistant Coach Shannon Daley was pleased with the per- fonnance of the crews. She felt that by racing teams with signifi- cantly more rowing time in their favor was beneficial, and she is looking forward to wh!tt she an- ticipates to be a great season. The last race was between the varsity men, who finished 9 sec- onds behind RPI with a time of 5:59. Novice men Roger Noyes and John Moeller were asked to row in the varsity boat to fill the eight seats. \Overall it was a good race,\ junior Rob Davis com- mented, \and hopefully as the sea- son progresses, we'll be able to improve enough to defeat them at States[ in Rome, NY, in May].\ Coach White concurred. \At this early point in the season, with what little water time we've had, the men's performance was clearly above expectations.\ With the season offto a strong start and the state competition approaching in just four short weeks, Union will continue to maintain a style of rowing that combines a dedication to the physical challenge, a willingness to improve, and a genuine love for the sport. number one for the tournament, the Dutchmen found themselves down by only seven points at half time. This gained the team a lot of respect in the minds of many of the Division I schools attending the tournament. A San Diego player said that he was in awe of Union' s.ability to continually stop Wyoming from scoring in the first half, which Wyoming has been well-known to do. Although Wyoming pulled ahead in the sec .. ond half, this can be blamed pri- marily on the lack of condition- ing that Union's early winter had caused. On the upside, Union's rookies, who numbered eight out ofthe l J who traveled, picked up a lotof experience and knowledge about the game. At the spring kickoff on Satur- day at home against RPI, you can look for some new faces around the pitch. Head Coach Skip Aycox retired due to medical com pi ications, and new Head Coach Tom Milner has been hired to fill his position. Al- though Union is counting on strong playing from its veterans, including seniors Alex Douville, Jon Kaufinan, Marc Peterson, and Myles KeiJam, as weiJ as captains Eric Smith and Matt Lux, there are some standout rookies that should make things happen as Union wages its way through its season. Schedule highlights include tournaments in Providence and the Upstate Championships in Clifton Park, as well as games against Army and Albany. Rook- ies to keep an eye on are Brett Lussier, whose speed and hitting power could make him a all-star wing in the future, and Ryan Martinson and Tom Burke have surfaced as possible stars on Union's young line. Mexico. Also look for hooker Seth Potkin to get some playing time as Eric Smith prompts him for A-side competition. Although Mat Scheller has been moved fr()m the line to the pack, expect his hard hitting and hard running to make things happen when the pack starts to rumble. · .Along with the fall rookies, there are many individuals from th~ upper classes that have de- cided to give the sport a shot for the spring. Donny Tam has emerged on the scene and their have been rumors of the arrivals of football standouts George Tiggle and Jenne! Royal. Rumors also have spread that Union Crew defector Andrew Mallios may put down his silk shirt to don a rugby jersey. These are just a few of the rumors circulating about the surprising faces that you may see. With this new talent and there- tLUn of many injured veterans from the fall, you can expect an exciting season from the men's team this spring.

This is a greattime of year with the NBA and NHL seasons com- ing to a close and the playoffs just around the comer. Can anybody chaHenge the Bulls? Jerry Krause, the Bulls' General Man- ager, made a great transaction this past week by signing forward Brian Williams fortheremainder of the season. This gives the Bulls another big man for their playoff run. With Rodman hurt and Bill Wennington out for six to eight weeks, this shrewd move by the Bulls brass further strengthens the club. The Knicks and the Heatare the only two teams who have a re- mote chance of upsetting the Bulls in the Eastern Conference playoffs. The Heat have a fabu- lous point guard in Tim Hardaway and asuperiorlow.post player in Alonzo Mourning. The Bulls always haveadifficult time defending a quick point guard. The Knicks and Bulls have one of the best rivalries going in all of sports. Jeff Van Gundy, the coach of the Knicks, has an ad- diction with beating the Bulls. I think his intense focus only on the Bulls has hurt his team, because after their big win a few weeks ago at Madison Square Garden, they have struggled against some very mediocre teams. When it is all said and done; the Bulls will once again come out of the East and be in the Champion- ship, battling one of four West- em Conference competitors. The Jazz, Sonics, Lakers, and Rockets all have a legitimate chance of representing their .con- ference. The Jazz have been the hottest team all year and will achieve the number one seed. Therefore, they will have the home court advantagethroughout their playoffrun. The Jazz have been thebridesmaidoutWest for many, many years. Will things change this year? They probably will not. They do not have a dominant center to match up with either Houston's Olajuwon or Los Angeles's Shaq, if he is fuily re- covered from his injury. A quick plug for the Mailman Karl Malone, who should win the MVP this year. Utah also does not have enough scoring, other than Malone, Stockton, and Hornacek. Seattle has been strug- gling mightily lately, and there has been some dissension with Shawn Kemp, who missed a team practice this past week. He played a season~Iow seven min- utes this past week Although they are i·n a slump right now, they will be fine when the play- offs come around, because they have been there before. They know what it takes to win and have a very deep bench with a tre- mendous amount of experience. The Lakers have been hit hard with the injury bug for the sec- ond half of the season but have remained in the hunt with terrific play from Nick Van Exel, Eddie Jones, Eldon Campbell, and Travis Knight. Can Shaq regain his form from the first halfofthe season? That is a big question. I think the Lakers are still a year away from really contending for a title. Finally, the Rockets have. three aging superstars. If the big three can stay healthy, they are defi- nitely a team to be reckoned with. Houston has won two titles in the nineties, so they also know what it takes to win a championship. It is a toss-up between Houston and Seattle, and if I were a bet- ting man, which I am not, I would take Houston. Thursday, the first of golf's four major tournaments, The Masters at Augusta National, starts. This was the very site of Greg Norman's fatal collapse last year, when he had a. seven-stroke lead going into Sunday and blew it. It was agonizing to watch his slow demise on national televi- sion. The back nine at Augusta, start- ing with the Amen comer, is one of the most arduous back nines in the world. Can Tiger Woods challenge and even win his first major? Personally, l do not think he will be a factor because of the media attention and the intense pressure of winning a major. I think the fan's choice to win this year's event has to be Greg Norman, who has been so close so many times in all four of golfs majors. Some other names to watch for are Tom Lehman, Scotland's Colin Montgomerie, and Steve Elkington, the winner of the Players' Championship. Look for Norman to take it all. Track Starts Spring Season Strong At Hamilton by Jason Everett Sports Writer The Union men's.andwomen's track teams opened the 1997 out- door campaign this past Saturday with a dual meet:agatnst'Flarnilton College in Cli'nton, New York.

The Union squads losses once again can easily be attributed to the team's inability to cover all oftl1e events, despite numerous top finishes. Senior co-captain Dave Riggi once again led the Dutchmen on the track while senior Jon Gainor led the team in the field events.

Dutchmen Lacrosse Starts Off Strong Men Defeat Albany in One-Goal Thriller by Jamie Griffin Sports Writer The Union men's lacrosse team got offto a rocky start when they lost their first game against Clarkson 18-1. Even though this was a major disappointment, the Dutchman were able to bounce back and defeat the Albany Great Danes 11-10 last Saturday. Senior attack-man Dave Pan;ot had three goals and scored the game-winner in Union's first vic- tory of the season. The third quar- ter of this exciting match-up was the Dutchmen's highlight, for they went through a stretch scoring five unanswered goals to put them ahead 1 0-8 going into the fourth During this time period, Parrot scored twice. Chad Kimball, with his domination on the face-offs, scored one goal and had one as- sist. At 9:59 in the fourth quarter, Albany's John Bauman tied the game with his second goal of the day. Thirty-three seconds later, Parrot scored the go-ahead goal, assisted by Justin Perkins. The Dutchmen defense really stepped it up at this time, holding the Continued on page 19 Vnioll 's Cflris DeLano jumps to avoid two Albatty Dalles en route to score in Vni011 's 11-10 will. (P/t()to by Laurie Kirschner/ TC) Women's Lacrosse Looks for Momentum by Geoff Sullivan Sports Editor After returning from a spring training trip in Florida, the Union women's lacrosse team was ea- ger to show the fans the promise of a new season. Coming off a victory over Oneonta, the Dutchwomen were unable to con- tinue their winning ways. Unfor- tunately, they came up on the short end of the stick after a tough II~ 7 defeat to Vassar College this past Saturday afternoon. With starting goalie Maura Woessner away, freshman goalie Michelle Tardif made her first collegiate start. She played rather impressively, saving 32 of the 43 Vassar shots on goal that she faced. Even though the score was tied 3-3 at half-time, Union was only able to produce 22 shots on goal and could not withstand the offensive attack of Vassar. \Overall it was a poor team performance,\ said coach Marty Morrison. \They didn't play well as a team. It was one of those days we were flat.\ While coach Morrison was upset with the loss, there were a few bright spots that she pointed out from the game. Sophomore defenseman Sarah Moss continued her impressive play, shutting down Vassa(s of- fensive threat, as well as freshman defenseman Sam Ryall, who made key interceptions through- out the game. Junior tri-captain Lauren Pastor conti.nued to put points on the board, scoring two goals and assisting on another in the loss. \It seemed likewedidn't play up to our potential. Our hearts were not in the game. We are a young team who should learn from this loss.\ With their record standing at 1- 3, the Dutchwomen make a very important road trip this upcom- ing weekend to St. Lawerence and Clarkson. With two wins, they could even their record dur- ing the most vital part ofthe sea- son. They are eager to rebound from this disappointing loss and want to show their fans what their truly made of.

As of April 10, the Third Judicial Department of Schenectady's Supreme Court, Appellate Division, ruled in favor of the college and, in doing so, declared that the original city ordinance prohibit- ing such a petition was unconstitutional. With the influx of over 600 new students last year, it has become more apparent than ever that the college needs addi- tional housing and ad- ministrative space on campus. The college owns five houses along the western side of Lenox Road, and President Hull saw them as viable op- tions for student res i- dence halls or potential offices. Some of these houses have been owned since 1961 and were ac- quired as gifts or by pur- chase. However, it is the location of these homes that has caused the great continued on page 4 and doing it for a good cause,\ said S(}phomore .lanci Karp.

There is so much history and tradition here.\ Jody Mousseau, a senior fe- male hockey player, added, \The decision to keep the rink on cam- pus was a favorable decision I believe for a majority of the Union community. The hockey programs will be able to play and grow where they belong. It was an exceiient, though unexpected decision.\ Adam Deutsch, a sophomore who participated in January's \Crosstalk\ about the rink, shared those feelings \I'm glad to see the rink stay It is good for the school and Union Hockey. A lot of students are pleased that President Hull fol- lowed through with what he said, as he 1 istened to the students. I'm happy to be able to watch hockey from the 'Q' Section in Achilles next year.\ Freshman representative Michael Winn, another member of the \Crosstalk\ panel who voiced support for Hull's rink idea, thinks that this was a learn- ing experience for all students \l' m happy to see that voices on campus were heard.

r Union Student Will Attend President's Summit Two Union Students Worthy Recipients of Watson Fellowships by Jen Caruso Contributing Writer John Vero, a senior at Union College from Albany, New York, was chosen to attend the President's Summit for America's Future. The President's Summit for America's Future is a national conference in Philadelphia, to be held April 27-29, honoring volunteerism and teaching new ideas to spark community activ- ism. Attending this conference will be all ofthe living presidents and General Colin Powell, who will be the mediator. The main goal of tile confer- ence is to .improve the nation's future. At the conference, ten delegates will represent different communities from all over the country. These delegates will be challenged to build upon the good things that their communities are doing and also to learn to assist other communities in iheir mis- sion. There were various work- shops and meetings with dignitar- ies to commend community vol unteerism and to teach the \best practice\ for com1n unity ac- tivism.

To present pecially college-aged)\ by par- his idea, he completed one paper ticipation in the President's Sum- describing his idea and another mit. explaining why his personality would be conducive to studying abroad for the year. After a nar- rowing down of the selection pool and a final phone interview, the Watson Foundation decided to grant Zane the money. · When describing his inspiration for the project, Zane says that he was inspired by the view in Grand Central Station in New York City. Although he was always im- pressed by the architecture, it was a class trip which made him truly appreciate the building. At that point, Zane had been thinking about applying for a Watson Fellowship and \it just clicked.\ He had always been in- terested in architecture and as Po- litical Science/History major this seemed the perfect opportunity to further investigate his interest. His emotional response to the train station reminded him of the re- sponses which churches often evoke in people. gland, France, and Italy each for four months to study the archi- tecture there. If his experience goes well, he may continue in architectural school but at this point, Zane is not positive about his plans after the year is up. While he is abroad, the money will pay for his traveling ex- penses, film, housing, food and any other equipment he might need. For the other Watson Fellow, Jessica Bernstein, the money will pay for traveling, housing and other necessities while she is in South Korea, Great Britain, and Norway. Altl10ugh this seems \.ike an unusual selecti-on of places to travel, it makes perfect sense to Jessica. While she is in these countries .Jessica will. be studying female Tae Kwon Doe. Jessica felt South Korea was an obvious choice to travel to because it is the country where Tae K won Doe originated. Great Britain ap- pealed to her because it is a coun- try with a similar social status to the United States. Lastly, Nor- way has the added attraction of being known as a more liberal nation where Jessica can study the effects of a more I iberal cul- ture on women's role in Tae KwonDoe. In order to make her project a more realistic venture, Jessica talked to many people about her interest. Ac- cording to Jessica, \I just went with my idea and wouldn't shut up about it.\ Because ofthe lack of a formal web of communica- tion tor female Tae K won Doe artists, Jessica was at a bit of a dis- advantage. She made incredible use of the Internet, though, and talked to many people until she had the in- formation she needed. Prof Malecky also served as a source of support for her in putting to- gether her paper and getting the information she needed. Jessica's hard work has paid off because now she is preparing to leave for South Korea in July and hopes to eventually put together a book ofthe stories of other fe- rnale Tae K won Doe students. In honoring Jessica and Zane for their accomplishments, it is also important to recognize Suzanne Robinson and Autumn Cohen who were also finalists in the competition. Outof approximately 200 stu- dents, these four from Union made it to the final round. They, along with their predecessors, serve as an inspiration that we all have a chance of being a Watson Fellow. \First Dag\ T(ffer Wltll Hull at Foshimr Show (PhotfJ by Laurie Kirscltner) Also, Zane was struck by the comparisons in the Renaissance and tum of the century.

The black and Latino representa- tion, or Jack thereof was disap- pointing to say the least,\ said se- nior Keith Parry. Other people felt similarly and thin~ that next year the commjt- tee should be more aware of the importance of a diverse represen- tation. \When it came to my at- tention that there were no black or Latino representatives in the show I was deeply offended. This was a campus-wide event and should have represented all faces and races. The campus should know that there is dual discrimi- nation which was perpetuated by the fashion show,\ sa.id graduate assistant Nicole Jarvis. \This is- sue can't be dismissed just be- cause they added one black fe- male and one Latino female after the issue was raised to the com- mittee. I hope we can look for- ward from this so it doesn't hap- pen in the future.\ According to Ben Fox, senior memberofilie Steeting Commit- tee, the models were chosen based on excellence in various areas; student services to the col- lege and community which range from Zoller Elementary School tutoring, Big Brothers/Big Sis- ters, to sports-affiliated members, student government involvement, and other leadership positions which benefit the campus. \Despite some ofthe difficul- ti~s the committee faced I feel we never lost s~ght ofthe big pic- ture. Some of the children of Make-A- Wish Foundation have been dealt a difficult hand in life and as fortunate as most of us are we felt we could really make an impact that would make a differ- ence in their I ives. When we called Make-A-Wish Foundation and told them how much we raised they were ecstatic,\ Fox said. \The fashion show was a huge success, and everyone's hard work paid off as seen by the num- ber of people there. We raised a lot of money and we're really proud,\ said Steering Committee member sophomore Sloane Sil- ver. \For a production the size ofthe fashion show; it's extremely sur- prising that so few things went wrong. This could only mean that next year's fashion show will run more smoothly,\ said junior Aram Green. Models such as Manny Cunanan and President Hull took a step out their presidential roles to take a stroll down the runway dressed to impress. Hull, in a jog- ging suit from Champs was ac- companied by his dog, Tiffer,and the two raised a few laughs from the crowd. '\Seeing Hull on the campus for the first time this year strutting down a catwalk was a sight to see. I think the dog amused me more:' said junior Tatiana Cogevina. Union's efforts to emanate the glitz and glamour of a profes- sional fashion show were suc- cessful. \The show seemed re- ally well organized and displayed all the clothing in an appropriate but fun manner,\ said sophomore Rebecca Resnick. At the end of the event, Fox concluded with presenting the profit of the fashion show to Make-A-Wish Foundation. Con~ tributions from students, faculty, staff, parents, Greek organiza- tions and visitors totaled $6,500 which was then given to the rep- resentative from the charity. Ac- cording to Fox, the original goal to contribute to the charity was between $~,000 and $5,000. Over the next few days people ap- proached committee members wanting to make additional dona- tions making the total donation exceed $7,000. \The event proved to be a huge success. It was the most positive thing ever to hit this campus in years, and I hope the show will become an annual event benefit- ing the students and the organi- zation it supported,\ said Steer- ing Committee member junior David Kanfer. \I was amazed at the tremen- dous success of the show,\ said Steering Committee member se- nior Ilissa Wood, \and proud to be a part of the effort and com- mitment of the committee and those individuals who sacrificed their time for such a worthy cause.\

' A Drier Decade Ahead For Phi-Delt by Bhavani Meduri Staff Writer Phi Delta Theta has announced . that it will be going dry as of July 1, 2000. The decision to make the fraternity alcohol-free was made by its General Council which is composed of Phi Delta Theta alumni. Although a general convention comprised of current brothers from across the nation meets ev- ery two years so thatthey can vote upon various policies, this par- ticular decision was made by the Council. However, John Vero, a senior Phi Delta Theta brother and soon to be Chapter Adviser stated, \The brothers here stipport the policy because it gives all of us the chance to show more respon- sibility and also to show the in- coming freshmen and the campus body what we're really all about.\ He then said, \We're about de- veloping a closely~knit commu- nity and being active in both in and outside ofthe college. Alco- hol tends to cloud these aspects of Phi Delt.\ When asked about what the ef. fects this policy will have on the social life ofthe fraternity, Vero stated that, \its implementation does not necessarily mean that there will be no alcohol allowed in the house. We're not sure as to how we will enforcethepolicy, however, tentatively, I can fore- see askil)g for a Union ID so that only college students are coming into the house and maybe hiring a professional bartender to serve drinks so that alcohol can be en- joyed responsibly.\ Although the national organi- zation .of Phi-Delt is not making the policy irrnnediately manda- tory, V ero stated that they were being strongly encouraged to in\ tegrate it. into their chapter. In order to make the transition as smoothly as possible, the General Council has allotted a three year integration period. Thus, the people most affected by this policy will be current pledge brothers and students who decide to pledge from future classes. When asked how he felt pledge recruitment would be af- fected with the fraternity going dry, Vero stated, \that the pledges will still be allowed to have alc!)- hol and parties, l1owever, they will just have to find creative ways to tactfully implement the pol icy so that alcohol is not abused.\ He also added that Phi Delta Theta is not a11 organization that centers its social activities around simply drinking alcohol. He feels that its other qualities will attract many students who would not mind pledging UI1der relatively alcohol-free conditions. Hudson River Undergraduate Mathematics Conference The motivation behind imple- menting the policy is mainly fi- nancial, although Vero stated that the moral principles it upholds were also an illlcen:tive. Imple- menting the policy nationwide will result in approximately $150,000 deduction in insurance premiums with the possibility of added savings in the future. Be- cause there are only two main in- surance companies that insure most nationally recognized frater- nities, V ero believes that many more Greek organizations, both around the country and at Union, will soon adopt similar alcohol- free policies in order to keep their insurance premiums low. by Tatiana Cogevina Contributing Writer This past Saturday, a number of Union students, and faculty at- tended the Hudson River Math Conference at Williams College. The event's main purpose is to provide \an opportunity for stu- dents to experience a professional mathematics conference designed primarily with them in mind.\ The idea of this conference origi- nated from Emelie Kenney some years ago. A committee of four professors was created and this year the Hudson River Math Conference celebrated its fourth'anniversary. Students and faculty from col- leges and universities in the north- eastern United States and Canada gathered for the conference. \You could sense the 'buzz' - lots of students doing lots of mathematics,\ said Prof. Zwicker who is a member of the commit- tee. The main talk of the day was by Benoit Mandelbrot of Yale University. Karen Grant, one of the students that preset~ ted in the conference, said \It was exciting to hear one ofthe most renowned mathematicians talk, and be sur- rounded by 400 undergraduate mathematicians.\ Twelve of the Union students that attended the conference als<> presented. Union ha~ the second largest number of students pre- senting, after Williams. Prof. Frame, who advised seven out of the twelve students presenting, said \I was very pleased with my student's presen- tations. but having spent the last two weeks helping the seven of them prepare, I am very glad it's over.\ Three sets of concurrent ses- sions were scheduled. Each set featured sixteen concurrent ses- sions, and each session consisted ofthree talks. The talks were broken up into two levels: one designed for all students and faculty, and the other designed more specifically for advanced undergraduates and faculty. The categories in which the stu- dents presented varied from Number Theory to Abstract Al- gebra to Fractals and Chaos. The titles of the talks by Union stu- dents included Continues Frac- tions and Linear Diophantine Equations by Matthew Mendelson and Control ofChaos of Coupled Logistic Maps by Courtney Brem. Reflecting on the conference Matthew Mendelson says, .. In terms of the talks I was able to attend, along with presenting my own thesis, I considered the con- ference an extremely positive ex- perience.\ A group of high school teach- ers that attended the conference with their students, e-mailed Prof. Zwicker \telling how much the experience heightened enthusi- asm for studying Mathematics in college.\ Last year, the conference was at Skidmore, and next year, it will return to this area, as the confer- ence lands at Union. Students and professors alike enjoyed the con- ference and are looking forward to it next year. \I would highly recommend attending next year's conference to any undergraduate math major,\ says Mer1delson. Essentially, the policy is a strong reminder to Phi Delta Theta brothers that they must be acutely aware o the consequences stemming from abuse of alcohol. Upon implementation of this policy, there wil:l be a much greater chance of a particular chapter having its charter revoked if it is held responsible for any alcohol-related accidents. lJNfON ~~EB gA~EI<!

This would amount to allowing a 170lb. rnan to consume 4 drinks on an empty stomach within one hour, instead of5, before that person is consid- ered intoxicated, for the purposes of driving a motor vehicle. Pataki's bill has no legislative sponsors as of yet, but the bill is presently being reviewed.

In order to investigate what Newt Gingrich called ar\na- tional security issue,\ Reno stated in a letter to Senator Orrin Hatch, chairman <>f the Senate Judiciary Committee, on April 14 that the Justice Department would be com- pletely capable of investigat- ing the re-election campaign funding complaints for the 1996 election. Though the Republican efforts predicted this outcome, their recent demands for an investiga- tion of Clinton's 1996 cam- paign funding efforts has implied either Reno's ap- pointment of an indepen- dent counsel or her resigna- tion. The Clinton campaign fund raising efforts for the re-election effort in 1996 has been placed under investiga- tion. Allegations have been made that President Clinton and his aides obtained cam- paign funding through non- traditional and unethical tactics. AaDdi::gbaNew York Times article on April15, the alleged illegal campaign fi- nance tactics include fund- raising activities being held on Federal property, a bla- tant abuse at1d misuse of government credit cards and phones, and allowing policy to be infltten-ced through foreign funding ef- forts. Because no specific evidence has been discov- ered regarding illegal cam- paign finance tactics by any of 24 senior Clinton Admin- istration officials, including the President, Vice-Presi- dent, and Cabinet officers, Reno is not required to ap- point an independent pros- ecutor to investigate the al- legations, a New York Times article on April 15 an- nounced. _ According to the Ethics in Government Act of 1978 which was developed after the Watergate incident, the New York Times said, the Justice Department would have thirty days to indicate if evidence exists that illegal activity occurred, and after that, the independent coun- sel would have to be ap- pointed by a panel of judges.

OP/ED .Opinions Firing Back: A Response to Last Week's .Skewed Editorial by Tony La Vec.chia Opinions Editor On the whole, I think a news- paper should present itselfto the outside cmrnnunity as acohesive unit. Sure·; we often squabble in- ternally over issues, both petty and significant, but at the end of the day when the fight is over and the issue is finished, the matter should normally stay inside the office. Despite my firm belief in the ideas I have just espoused, I find it necessary to take issue with the editorial which appeared in last week's issue. I think that when newly-elected editor Frank Rossi penned his first person edi- torial which aired the staff's dirty laundry, it became accepti:tble f0r me, an ex-editor !llyself, to re- spond and set tl~e record straight. There are certain basic prin- ciples that must always guide a • student newspaper; I believe these · issues are absolute and transcend personal opinions and leadership styles. First and forem~St among these principles is that a paper must fervently pursue all news, not just the stories that the edi- tors think happen to be pleasant Contrary to what Mr. 'Rossi stated in his editorial, (and I say his be- cause he improperly took the first person in the editorial box which is supposed to reflect the opinfons · of the editorial board of which I am a senior member) no one sug- gested that we print the ad with- out allowing Beta the chance to respond.

To page story. Those three people By Jared Richman Staff Cartoonist I imagine that most of the other sections of this week's paper will devote some space to the illustri- ous fashion show that took place last Friday night. Naturally, the topic is so juicy I can hardly re- sist. First, let me just say that the show itself was fairly entertain- ing and that the many hours of hard work from tl10se involved were well spent-you should all be very proud of producing a very professional and successful event (rah rah, sis boom bah). How- ever, sitting there, listening to the self-congratulatory remarks -of several of the show's organizers did make me a bit ill-not that congratulations weren't in order, but charity should be done for the sake of charity, not praise. Like- wise, the fact that while upwards of $6,000 were raised for a well deserved charity, I am curious about just how much Union Col- lege spent of its own funds in pro- duction and promotion (the ex· cessive flyers alone must've cost a small fortune-and that $200 (?) sign?). Still, tile ends clearly justifies the means (in this case). Of course. this is all merely conjecture, for 1 am sure that a project this large (I was constantly told how ·\high'~ up this thing went) made all the right arrange- ments. So many people worked on and supported this thing that it may come as little surprise that some were willing to defend it even before it to<Jk place. Cer- tain Deans and mem hers of Stu- dent Activities were rumored to have actually prepared a letter io defense o( the show even before any dissent appeared in The Concordiensis, and in fact, to have attempted to ''\head off at the pass\ such a letter by question- ably hounding the impressionable new editors.

Editor, Below is the letter that was sent to the Social Committee re- garding tile misrepresentation of women of color in the fashion show that took place last Friday evening. I f-elt it was necessary to publish this letter in the Concordiens.is so as to alert the campus on such an important is- sue. It was brought to our atten- . tion that people never knew that there is sueoh an issue as dual dis- criminati<ln. Such ignorance is unacceptable. Despite this unfor- tunate incic:lent, there is a lesson to be learned or retaught. For fu- ture events, which try to include the entire ca·mpus, students should utilize their. resourc.es. There are many organizations on campus dedicated to promoting. diversity. They include, but aren't limited tot:he African and Latino Alliance of Students, Circulo Estudiantil Latino Americano, the AsianStuclent Union, and ShaktL \We. tile ladies of color on Union Orllege campus, would like to bring to your attention the gross injustice that your commit- tee viciously perpetuated. Your attempted goal to \fully repre- sent\ Union's diverse population was highly unsuccessful. The fi- nal cutofyourchosen listofmod- els fails to- fully represent the true makeup of Union College. By choosing six men of color and two women of color, you fail to represent the true spectrum of di- versity. Furthennore, after the en- tire selection process, you failed to i11clude African-American and Latina women. We recognize your attempt to rectify the situa- tion by including two more mi- norities after a list was submitted l>y outraged women of color. However, it is too little, too late. This \ov.ersight\, that a member of)'ourcommittee admitted to, is not merely an \oversight but just another example of the silent pol icy of gender and race bias that til is institution caters to. As full-fledged members of Union Co liege, we expect a pub- 1 ic apology at the fashion show as well as in The Concordiensis identifying your \oversight'' as a mi!!take. In the future, when plan- ning campus-\,Vide events, it is imperative that FULL represen- tation of the Union Coilege popu- lation is considered. Dual dis- critnination based upon gender and race, as manifested by the selection process of your commit- tee, is rampant in our society. It is necessary that you recognize this problem and address it in the f11ture. Once again, we expect a formal apology admitting your mistake at the fashion show as well as in The Concordiensis.\ The Ladies of Color Nicole Graham

OP/~D - . - - . · · _. . · . . 'ill lie Olnnco:roicnsiz. · April 17, 1997 · Page .1 0 EDITORIAL , · ent Leaders'' Apathetic Saturday morning was the Alumni Counci I meeting. The Council · meets twice a yearto discuss various issues of importance to alumni · uding academics, athletics, the general standing of Union's facilities, and financial issues. This year at the start of the meeting, President Hull announced the names of some ofthe campus leaders and asked them to stand. The only current s1udents who decided to make an appearance at the meeting, whicl! went on throughout the day, were the editors of The Concordiertsi.s and the new General Manager ofWRUC. We at The Concordiensis were very surprised that only three per- who are thought to be \student leaders of Union College,\ the event important enough to attend. To the many alumni, e ofwhom made extremely long trips just to attend the meet- the lack of a showing by many of Union's leaders including President ofthe Student Forum, both student trustees, the Presi- ofthe Panhellenic Council, and other well-heard voices on the ent Forum, showed a tremendous ai'n()unt of apathy among the on the campus. Some of the alumni voiced the fact dur.ing a luncheon that they that Union students were somewl1at apathetic, but did not ink that they cared so little about their predecessors. In short, felt that this lack of appearance at t11e Council, was almost a in the face. We at The Concordiensis know that the student body is not all apathetic. Taking Friday night's fashion show as an example, ch over 600 students chose to attend tobenetitthe Make a Wish Foundation, the results show anything btlt an apathetic, uncaring up of Union \student leaders\ and other students. However, the lack of an appearance bythose \student leaders\ at is meeting:showed the complete opposite. It is okay to sacrifice a part of a Friday night and wake up early ()none Saturday morning have breakfast and chat with alumni and find out their opinions and concerns. Aside from the fact that what the alum11i think is important, they all interesting people who have a number ofditlerent perspec- on how Union should be run. Fore>eample, a large portion of alumni believe that Union is becoming even more deserving of title \The Jewel ..of the East Coast\ after the statistics for the classof2001 were discussed. Many alumni expressed the fact that they were for keeping Achilles Rink on Union's campus. Others feel that while the Greek System has cha11ged a lot at Union, it will still remain a pillar on Union's campus. In short, the views of the alumni were extremely enlightening. Unfortunately, many of Union's most esteemed \student leaders\ who were invited to the Council meeting were not around to listen contribute ideas of their own. Hopefully, for future meetings, student leaders will revisit their priorities and make an honest ef- fort to attend these events. It will be worth time.

They are those '\approval polls\ taken everyday by media agen- cies attempting to take the \pulse\ of Americans concerning our leaders. The results have ranged from the outrageously high (9{) percent approval forGeorge Bush during the Gulf War) to ridicu- lously low (nearly 30 percent fo1 Bush when the economy faltered in 1992). The numbers, however, are most useful not to the media or- ganizations, but rather to the pol i- tician. For instance, Bush at- tempted to sit back on his 90-per- cent approval some 16 months before the 1992 election. This obviously did not work. Bill Clinton sawhisnumbersdrop al- most instantly after he took office. but he recogniz~dthat fact and got help {namely, !Tom Dick Morris} He was reelected easily. At Union, no approval ratings are on record t(Jr our own pol iti- cian, President Roger Hull. On a small campus, approval is easily felt through stttdent reactions, tile tone of the newspaper, and the overall direction ofthe college. In his nearly seven years at Union. Hull has seen a variety of per- ceived ratings for his job. He has also made the mistakes of George Bush and the corrections of Bill Clinton. There is one politician that has shadowed Hull's own approval ratings: House Speaker Newt Gingrich. While Gingrich has been thought of as the House Re- publican leader for only three years, he also has seen his ap- proval ratings take a roller-coaster ride. When Hull became Union College's Presi,dent at the start of the decade, he made what many people felt was a precedent-set- ting decision. He chose to move hockey up to Division I, a move students and the community ap- plauded. When Newt Gingrich was attempting to swing support to Republicans in 1994, he also he! ped set a precedent with the Contract With Ame6ca. Both men felt that they could j(unp on their own bandwagons and continue to remain comfort- ably in the limelight. Gingrich was often mentioned before Clinton on national newscasts. He remained steadfastly dedi- cated to the Contract's ideals. Hull continued his progress with the reconstruction of the Nott Memorial. These leaders knew that their respective approval rat- ings, whether reported by CNN or perceived through sentirrtent were sky high. Like Bush prob- ably asked himself in 1991, what could go wrong? Everything. Both men shot themselves in the fo()t. Gingrich found serious troubledLuing the 1995 budget crisis as he watched the federal government:ShLttdown around Christmas. Day by day, his approval rating d.ropped like the stock market in 1929. What did Hull do that was s<> bad? Two words: meal plan. Hull and Gingrich both had to d() some backtracking to find solid ground during their collapses. and both decided to leave the limelight until negative sentime11t disap- peared somewhat. In 1996, Gingrich hefped Re- publicans to maintai11 control of the House by disapj)earing, and through 1996, Hull\s approval rating crept upward (thmtgh \\Hull Sightings\ were sometimes met with sarcastic feelings} He an- nounced the building of the 01 in Center and . solicited great amounts of money for the Schaffer Library renovation. Approval was somewhathigh for both, but not nearly as ltigh as it was when it previmtsly peaked. Yet, both men made the same mistake again. Gingrich was charged with eth- ics violations, and, last month, his own party he! ped l1i1n lose a housekeeping vote because of their anger with his ina~tion and tax-cut waffling.

Page 11 ·April 17, 1997 ·Wire QI{ntrnrohmsis · . · OP/ED ' ' : ' Opinions·--~--~-- The· W·oes Of The. Fashion ·Business Robert Cohen StaffWriter Along with 600 or so of my compatriots, I attended Union's Fashion Show of Support this past Friday. l was taken aback by the amount of people whoshowed up at this thing. I actually had to wait in line for ab€tut 30 minut~s be- fore being allowed in. However, I must askmyself, was the expen- · diture of putting this thing to- gether worth it? Before continu- ing, I would like to get a few things out ofthe way. First, the Make-A- Wish Foun- dation is a great charity, and I alh proud of the fact that a few Union students got together and raised $6,500 for them. However; these same people will probably be up- set atthis opinion article and take it as a personal attack. This is not meant to be. Rather, it is meant to open the eyes of the campus community as to what actually happened and to let them decide if it was worth it. By the tenn \costs\ used above, l do not mean only the monetary costs, but also \costs\ in the sense of the entire event, such as the obvious costs of involvement on behalfofthestudent body. These types of things were, for the most part, probably volunteered. Heck, I know some people who volun- teered. Of course, there were the few forced instapces, but we won't get into that. It might tum some heads. There are a few specific things that I would like to touch on: first,. the signs that basically held the Reamer Center together for two weeks prior to the event; second, the blatant disregard for fire safety during the Fashion Show; a tid finally, the monetary costs involved itl putting this thing to- gether. It is hard to believe that the totaJ blll on this event came anywl1ere under the $6,500 raised. Make a wish. Well, I wish that I was the person who sold paper to Unio11 College. The people re- sponsil>le for the signs must have used boxes upon boxes of paper in order to advertise this thing. Maybe it did in fact have a direct relationship to the amount of people showing up, but was it re- ally worth the life of a whole for- est? Pa:per is not a cheap thing, especiaJly all that fancy colored paper,.and: I bet the cost of paper was not even figured into the to- tal expense for the Fashion Show. The point here is that it is okay to make signs to promote things, but was what occurred really neces- sary? I do not think so. The next thing that really ticked me off about the signs was the fact that those signs hanging in the ReamerCenter were not stamped. The event was a Student Activi- ties-hacked event, which means that some money came from the students. As l recall, last terin there was a big stink about the fact that a certailli sign was not stamped, therefo;re the club funds were fro- zen. If those peopl 1 e, the same people who backed this event. want the rule about stamping en- forced (I believe a letter was also sent t<J .everyone involved in the operations of a club regarding the issue e>f stamping), then they should have also enforced it in Hull and Newt .... this case. However, they did not. Also,, it was notlike the previous incident when there were maybe 2'5 signs total that were not .. stamped. In this instance there . w~reprobably a total of200 signs nof stamped-everyday, for two week~; Ifl only sold them paper ' The second issue that I have witl1 the Fashion Show was the space in which it took place, Upperclass. Who here has not he!'ltd the \rumor\ yet') Sadly, it isnot a nun or. Security would not l~t more than 530 people in, wh,ich is probably more than Upperclass can hold. However, there were still tons of people waiting outside. So the esteemed Mr: Hull talked to them, and mi- raculously 100 more people were let in to the standing-room-only section. I didn't know there was one. Can this guy work miracles · or what? This caused even more of a hazard to those people in Upperclass. Who would have ex- pected such a turnout? Obviously those people running the show didn't expect it. This brings up a good point. Union does not have the proper forum to hold these types of events. So, should we allow them? When safety is a concern, absolutely not. We cannot blame anyone forth is, because nothing happened-there was no fire. However~ it is an issue that must be questiohed before' anything like this is to happen again. Any- one who was there can attest to the fact that if, God forbid, there had been a fire, it would have been a blood-bath. For some people, there was no way of get- ting out. That is why [ chose to sit by a door. The third, but nowhere near fi- nal, issue with the Fashion Show that I will share is the monetary costs involved in putting on such an escapacle. When I first asked someone invol¥ed, the m~swer that I got was, \I dma '(know.\ This is understanda-ble, because I asked sometime last week. I also got the impression that even if they had ktiown the cost, they would not have told me. That av- enue was shut, and unfortunately, as this goes to press l am still searching for a final dollar amount. However, it does notre- ally matter if the cost was $5,73 7, $6,500, or $10,000. The point here is that it was excessive. Was it a nice thing to have a Fashion Show? I really do notsee the difference between the clothes worn on the catwalk and those worn by students here ev- eryday. Was it really worth it to spend thousands of dollars on a stage, lights, and a sound system (that gave nasty feedback) to see these clothes? I think not. I mean, it would have been a different story ifthe models were wearing things that are not sceti around here, but who knows if it would have made that much of a diner- ence. Besides the equiJJment costs, there was the cost ofsecurity, who was seen to be easily controlled by the powers that he and who demonstrated a b htant disregard for safety. There was also the cost of dining services. [ mean, they closed the two most heavily fre- quented places for food on this campus. hriaglne the Joss to the them. They could have donated . the food and the time, but hey, we are at Union, a place where many departments have not seen bud- get raises tor years (yet tuition keeps rising. Explain that:) Do you expect dining services to give something away? Dining ser- vices, along with some others around here, screws us every chance they get. They learned from the best-the president. Let's get back to the issue at hand. The main point is that the cost of this event was too high. Yes, I grant that it raised $6,500 for charity, but I know for a fact that my money, which was given to Student Activities, was spent helping to put this thing together. (See page 8 ofthe program). It would have been a more success- ful event, in my opinion, and I would not be as ticked off, if less money had been was spent on putting the event together and more of it had been given to char- ity; but see, that is me, and unfor- tunately that is not how a lot of people around here think. I fwe had a big walk-a-then for Make-A-Wish and donated all the money spent on putting the Fash- ion Show together and the money raised, we could have given them $15,000 There are a dozen more issues that l have with the Fashion Show. This is just a small sample I know that this will tick some people off and that they will take is personally. Well, I cannot avoid that, but often the truth is hard to swallow. People have a right to know what goes on behind the closed doors around this campus and about the discriminate en- forcement ofthe rules (which oc- curs all over campus), Regretta- bly, the students, except for an elite few, all too often pay the pnce. My suggestion is that people start to focus on the Feal issues facing this campus, and ifyou're going to do a fund-raiser please ensure that it does not cost as much (or more) than you donate, because that defeats the purpose. Cont'dfrompage 7 publicly investigated moving hockey off campus. Both men's approval dropped like a rock again as their constituencies felt alienated .. tuality ~a lot. Remember, nearly every time a politician suffers a. major blow, that person rarely can recove\rtheirapproval to previous heights (trust is a tough bond to mend}·. Just because it looks like you are on the rise does not mean you can come out \guns a-blaz- ing\ and upset your constituency without penalty. Sigma Gamma Rho Sorority Takes Issue with Fashion Show Since the rink proposal, Hull has done much to regain the stu- dents' trust. \Hull Sightings\ are no longer considered reasons for celebration as he has spent ample time with students at home and around campus. He chose to sit with the students at RPI instead of with RPr s Presi- dent during hockey playoffs (and helped prevent the ejection of a student). He has won the second round ofthe Lenox Road battle. Of course, he has also announced that hockey will stay where it is for the time being. Newt Gingrich is putting forth the same \ifyou can't beat 'em, join 'em\ attitude. Gingrich has reappeared on television and on various podiums hammering forth his party's ideas, even on tax cuts. His approval rating, which dipped to 25 percent, has since bounced slightly. So, what is there to learn from this recent-history lesson. In ac- President Hull and Newt Gingrich need to learn from their mistakes. These are pivotal times . for both men, and both are mak- ing a clecentrecovery. However, now is not the time to sway and put forth an uncharacteristically bold idea. Instead, this is the time to co!ltinue mending trust while maintaining a fair amount of ex- posure. Approval ratings can drop faster than they can rise in most cases. Ask George Bush .. WeiJI, I know President Hull reads this paper, ·but if I could only get in touch with Newt Gingrich and warn him. On sec- ond thought, I'm su.re Dick· Morris can help him more than l cart President Hull probably has Morris' number! The Ladies of Sigma Gamma Rho Sorority, Inc., Xi Omega chapter, feel the need to express our disappointment in the deci- sion- making regarding the Union College Fashion Show. We were deeply saddened by the continued neglect on issues deal- ing with women of color. The theme of the FashiGn Show was to promote the typically under- represented population at Union. Therefore, it is a wonder how the selection committee completely omitted women of color. In light of this unfortunate situ- ation we, as women of color, would like to offer our services and suggestions for any future events. Our aim is to promote cultural diversity and to uplift the community. Due to this fact we hope that this \'oversight\ does not continue in creating a greater gap between different cultures and groups. In closing, let us try to eradicate this apathetic attitude felt amongst some individuals within the Union community by embracing all walks of llfe. A progressive future cannot be ob- tained when the negativity that divides this society is blatantly permeating within a college which is regarded as an institu- tion ofhigher learning.

OP/ED Fashion Show Organizers Speak Out April 14, 1997 To the Concordiensis Editors, Last Friday evening, the Union community gathered at Unions Fashion Show ofSupportto sup- port The Make-A Wish Fo~nda­ tion. The Make-A-Wish Founda- tion is the worlds largest and most respected wish organization - granting wishes to special chil- dren suffering from life-threaten- ing illnesses. This event provided an opportunity for Union students to socialize while supporting the larger community in which were all members. Unions Fashion Show of Sup- port was not only the cui mination of a lengthy and arduous learn- ing experience for our committee -but a confirmation of our origi- nal beliefs. Our Chets sub-com- mittee began with the singular goal of raising significant funds for children less fortunate than most Union students. The bel-ief guiding our vision was that Unions student body is a benevolent group willing to do- nate time and money in exchange for our good fortune. We thank all readers tor proving that belief to be true. In tenns of planning and prepa- ration, we thank all those who. stepped forward to ask how can I help? and will you consider this idea that might help raise addi- tional funds? These offers per- fectly exemplify the Union stu- dent: one who constantly takes proactive steps toward making any idea the best it can possibly be. All too often. the Concordiensis is the pigeon by which negative opinions and destructive criticism is carried. Instead, this letter stands as a testament to the ben- efits of constmctive critcism and positive praise. Praise not tor our- selves, but tor the entire Union community who bought stars, at- tended Friday evening, cheered for their fellow students, or sim- ply saw a sign that mac.le them laugh. Union's Fashion ShowofSup- port was not about clothing or the individuals participating on the runway. Instead, it celebrated the capacity for good on our own campus. We stood Friday evening before the Union community with thanks and humble appreciation of your positive applause and now would like to return the favor.

It never really clicked in my mind that that could be possible~ but college does some funny things to you, and after realizing tl1at Accepted Students Day just passed, a year ago does feel I ike yesterday, because I thought that I was just herewith mom and dad awaiting the anxiety of college life. I stillrememberthe first time I walked through all the supposed bustle of college life with all these really \old sophisticated\ people strolling around campus. I felt like I was two years old. I guess that is what the incoming fresh- menmustbeteeling too. Now, the fact that I can actually say that f' m a soon-to-be sophomore is pretty frightening. I'm not really sure where this year went Somewhere along the line I stopped holding onto high school so tightly. I stopped clinging to my telephone waiting for double rings and the familiarity of certain voices. I stopped beingthedaughterofmy parents, and I started being me. So, what is this all about any:.. way? Why am I spilling my heart out to such a public audience? I'm doing all this because I want to know if it happened for you, too. I think it is funny llow everyone has that sudden surge of \wait a minute, I'm in college now.'' In a sort of twisted way it was only when I stopped trying so hard to be here that I finally was here. It is easy to get caught up in the whirlwind of Stltdying, ca11- ing friends, working out, and finding time for sleep. While you are doing all that, you sometimes forget to look around and actually experience · what you're doing. I think that's where the flash of time goes: time gets lost because all too often we are too busy and forget to ac- knowledge it. I cannot lament what has passed, though, because everyday fills my life with something bet- ter, something that makes me mm:e than I was the day before. However, I am only eighteen years old. Being a junior or se-. nior seems so far away for me, yet I know those years are going to sneak up on me, and gradua- tion is sort oflooming in the all- too-near future. I am sure those spring-term se- niors cannot really believe where their lives are leading now, and maybe it's a welcome change, but for a spring-tenn freshman there's something sad about growing up. Time is falling. We turn around and ifs another week gone by, another term passing, another year behind us. I don't know what lies ahead, and yet l spend half my time worrying about it. Maybe I think too much. So, that's my advice for right now- live in the moment. I say this because somehow I missed the first few months of college I ife. I tried too hard in the past but now, I am actually feeling my life, liv- · ing through my days. So, seeing those new faces, these people who are soon to be here at Union, has made me real- ize a lot about this past year and about the years ahead. I am sorry that I let this year move so quickly. I won't make that mis- take again. There's still a few weeks left in this term. It's about time I started being a college freshman and no lot1ger a graduated high school senior.

IIAL: You Gotta Love The Dentist by JeffDruzba Staff Writer A friend of mine is having his wisdom teeth pulled soon. I was thinking about my experience with the dentist. I've never had a badcheck-up,so I can'tsay it's a horrible trip every time I go. In fact, I kind of! ike it. I liked to go when I was l.ittle, and I still like to see the dentist now. When I was little, it was the VIP treatment that excited me. They've got Highlights magazine in the waiting lounge and plenty of crayons. You finally get cal led in and they completely cater to you. You get to pick your flavor of fluoride. You get to hold the egg timer while the fluoride is setting. When the cleaning is done, they give you a sticker and a free toothbrush of your choice. They take your Polaroid next to a height chart when you're done and give you the old one that was hanging on their wall. I can't say I had a bad time. Now, even without all the fancy treatment that the children get, I still find myself well amused at the dentist's office. Any visit begins with that pik tool. Con- trary to toothpaste commercials that portray the pik as an instru- ment to be feared, I kind of like it. There's something refreshing about the dental assistant scrap- ing away stutrthat's not supposed to be there. I start thinking~ about those Listerinc commercials where pJaque is revealed to be a bunch oftanged and voracious monsters I i ving on your teeth. I know that's not how it is, hut I cannot help but think that the pik is impaling all those little creatures. It's enough to make my teeth feel like dancing, but the dental care docs not stop there. Next is the brush phase. Actu- ally, what is that thing? It's more ofa tooth rotor butler. It's a min- iature car buffer if you think about it. Anyway, they put that mint flavored sand paste on and buff the hell out of those teeth. Those little plaque monsters do not have a chance. When they tinish buffing, it's time for the one part that annoys me about dental check-ups. They rinse off that paste and you want to swallow but, no, they put that vacuum tube in your mouth. It's I ike you're about to take a big thirsty drink, but then someone takes the 1 iquid out of your mouth. Tumbleweed is blowing around in there as the dental as- sistant flosses for you. A tler the assistant is done, the dentist stops by and looks tor a moment. The two of you make' idle chat about college and what year you are. He looks around, sees no problem, and you are both on your way. The dentist is otT to go drill the hell out of some poor soul's mouth and you're off to enjoy the rest ofyour day knowing that the .plaque monsters are dead for now.

' I 'i Spring Time Reflection Calenders Forgotten, Hours Lost by Michelle Tham Features Editor Somebody once told me that after a certain point. time just starts ~o flash by-that looking back on your life is scary because a year ago feels like yesterday, It never really clicked in my mind that that could be possible~ but coHege does some funny things to you, and after realizing that Accepted Students Day just passed, a year ago does feel like yesterday, because I thought that I VIas just here with mom and dad awaiting the anxiety of college life. I still remember the first time I walked through all the supposed bustle of college life with all these really \old sophisticated\ people stro II ing around campus. I felt like I was two years old. I guess that is what the incoming fresh- men must be feeling too. Now, the fact that I can actually say that I'm a soon-to-be sophomore is pretty frightening I'm not really sure where this year went Somewhere along the line I stopped holding onto high school so tightly. I stopped clinging to my telephone waiting for double rings and the familiarity of certain voices. I stopped being the daughter of my parents, and I started being me. S<l, what is this all about any- way\ Why am I spilling my heart <Jut to such a public audience? I'm dotng all this because I want to know if it happened for you, too. I tbmk it is funny how everyone has that sudden surge of\wait a minute, I'm tn college now\ In a sort of twisted way it was only when I stopped trying so hard to be here that I finally was here. It is easy to get caught up in the whirlwind of studying, call- ing friends, working out, and fi11ding time for sleep. While you are doing all that, you sometimes forget to look around and actually experience what you're doing. I think that's where the flash oftime goes: time gets lost because all too often we are too busy and forget to ac- knowledge it I cannot lament what has passed, though, because everyday fills my life with something bet- ter, something that makes me more than I was the day before. However, I am only eighteen years old Being a junior or se- nior seems so far away for me, yet I know those years are going to sneak up on me, and gradua- tion is sort oflooming in the all- too-near future. I am sure those spring-term se- niors cannot really believe where their lives are leading now, and maybe it's a welcome change, but for a spring-tenn freshman there's something sad about growing up. Time is falling. We tum around and it's another week gone by, another term passing, another year behind us. I don'tknowwhat lies ahead, and yet I spend half my time worrying about it. Maybe I think too much So, that's my advice for right now- live in the moment. I say this because somehow I missed the first few months of college life I tried too hard in the past but now, I am actually feeling my life, liv- ing through my days. So. seeing those new faces, these people who are soon to be here at Union, has made me real- ize a lot about this past year and about the years ahead I am sorry that I let this year move so quickly. I won't make that mis- take again. There's still a few weeks left in this term. It's about time I started being a college freshman and no longer a graduated high school senior. You Gotta Love The Dentist by Jeff Druzba Staff Writer A friend of mine is having his wisdom teeth pulled soon I was thinking about m_v experience with the dentist. I've never had a bad check-up, so I can't say it's 3 horrible trip every time I go. In fact, I kind of like it. I liked to go when I was little, and I still like to see the dentist now. When I was little, it was the VIP treatment that excited me. They've got Highlights magazine in the waiting lounge and plenty of crayons. You finally get called in and they completely cater to you. You get to pick your llavor of 11uoride You get to hold the egg timer while the fluoride is setting When the cleaning is done, they give you a sticker and a free toothbrush of your choice.

P-ag~ 16 · Aprill7, 1997 · Wl~c Qtonwroil.'nsis · · . . · ·Features Race: an Afterthought at Union~ Fashion Show by Conor McKenzie In many ways, Union's Fash- ion Show of Support was a huge success, mostly because it raised a lot of money for a great cause. Per- haps even more amazing was the number of students attracted to this event. It seemed to attract nearly the entire student body, a·response unprecedented in Union College history. On the surface, it appears that the organizing committee de- serves nothing but applause--and for the most part they have received it. . Doubtless, there are several ar- ticles in the News section objec- tively reporting the details of the fashion show's success. Like any issue, though, it also needs to be analyzed subjectively. So, at risk of stepping into Rawson's territory, I'd like to list a few possible rea- sons why so many students turned outto the event. 1. Frats don't open tillll. 2. These days you can't get served a beer for less than three dollars anyway. 3. \I heard they had an au- thentic black woman in the show.\ Wow, a real black woman in a Union College event! I had to check this out. As it tums out the ) It's now the third week of this term. We can definitely confirm that life these days is completely out of control. Well, not really, but we've already had an awe- some time this tenn. Everyone is finally coming out ofhibemation to join us on the party scene. Our primary concern at this moment, besides schoolwork of course, is trying to write a funny article without offending anyone. We felt that our last article was the most benign and least offen- sive article we have ever written. Yet. mysteriously Whitney re- ceived phone calls from a dis- gruntled reader asking her, \What the ?#*t was up with your ar· ticleT; We think that this is com- pletely asinine and irrational be- havior; and we strongly suggest that in the future you direct all comments about the newspaper to tbe newspaper. Thanks. Now, back to business. As we sit here writing this on a cold Sunday evening, all we can think about is the amazing time thatwe had this weekend. What we dread is the week ahead of us . . . ARGH! It's really scary how life revolves around the weekend and how you just try your best to sur- vive the week just so that you can start the partying anew on Friday. Unless you are in the unfortunate habit of going out on weekdays too . . . . Weekday partying is definitely underrated. rt can of- black woman-Rachel Graham- is a friend of mine who fives across the hall. I decided to ask Rachel about her runway experience, and after talking with her did away with the I ist because her story was much more interesting. Besides, top-ten lists are played out anyway. Much effort was obviously put into the planning ofUnion's Fash- ion Show of Support (a full~ page color add in The Coricordiensis, a real banner outside the college cen- ter ... ). This planning obviously paid off, judging from the overca- pacity crowd. Needless to say, I was surprised to hear that Rachel was added just four days before this \well- planned\ event. Why was Rachel added so hastily? Appar- ently, atthe lastminute,somebody made the realization that no women ofcolorhad been included in the show. \I was approached four days before the show, where I was in- fanned that there were no black or latina women in the fashion show. At that point I didn't really know much about the show ... I thought it was off campus or something; but, when it became known that no black or latina women had been in- cluded in the show, the women of ten be more entertaining than weekend romps. We prefer the small crowd atmosphere of the weekday scene, while the huge mob-type atmosphere of the weekend tend to get us a little nervous. We usually end up get- ting separated from each other and ending up with some randoms-but whatever, it hap- pens to everyone. Are we cor- rect right here? Speaking ofthis weekend, we have heard that there were many falls. We mean, falling is okay in the winter. At least then it looksnonnal. Youcanjustblame it on the harsh conditions or on poor footwear. However, you are going to have to invent a pretty good excuse if you continue to fall in the future. If you still ex- perience trouble, just abstain from dark staircases. It's no big deal. We were lucky enough to witness what was probably, hands down, one ofthe best we have yet to see on this campus. Sorry to those innocent bystanders-the gimp did not mean to disrupt your pong game. Just think of it as sort of half-time show. No one got hurt. .Just a note to all those confused people out there: the stairs are not to be used as a slide. If you think that they are, be prepared to ac- cept the consequences. Let's go back to the topic of academics. Yes ... classes ... the reason that we are here. Did color on this campus were upset thattlley had neglected to included any of us.\ Rachel herself is quite even-tem- pered and was hesitant to get an- gry about the organizing committee's mistake. Equally jus- tified though, are the many other women of color who were very upset at their exclusion from this enom0us campus-wide event. Some demanded an apology for this mistake at the event itself (none was given), and now they are simply hoping that the commit- tee will print an apology in The Concordiensis. Some spoke of boycotting the event, but Rachel \thought boy- cotting would have been stupid, because then we wouldn't have been supporting the cause [the Make-a- Wish Foundation]. There is a black and Iatino community here, and they need to be seen ... Kim and I thought it would be best 1() represent the community even though we weren't invited\ Surprisingly, according to Rach.el, the organizing committee, though very friendly and helpful, didn ~t seem to be too concemed or panicked about the lack of color among their female models. \Most you forget? Of course not. Who would'? We mean, the only time that we stop studying is to go out on the weekends for about an~ hour to see what people are re- ally fike. We just like to hit it .. . we 1nean talk to people. Yes .. . classes. Well, what can we say? Hmmm ... they're not too bad- defttlitely the best yet. However, we do agree with the idea of not taking afternoon classes in the spri11g. We have learned our lesson. We guess that it's just a matter of opinio-n, and, might we add, a dam11 good one. Afternoons shoulcf be reserved for outdoor activities, especially on the lawn. Now,don'tgetanyideas. Wedo not wish.to open our.windows to witness nefarious acts. Home- work ... we hope you remember that ... even though every other college is finishing t.q> their school yefl!'. Well, it's not so bad. It does not b(,}1her us. We kit:~d of like it-tile hard-core studying time that is. if you don't, we're sorry. SUCK IT UP AND STOP CRY- ·INGf Well, enough for now, time to hit the skins ... we mean the books. Wllitney and Cari are once againsigning off So, here's your weekly SNAPS: \Your sister is so stl.tpid, I told her to go to the s~ore for two heroes and she brotJght back Batman and Robin.\ of the concern came from the women of color on this campus, because we felt we needed to be represented. When I agreed to enter the show at the last minute, they tried to figure out who I would be paired with and what I would be wearing. Originall:y, I was paired with somebody to wear Union College bookstore wear ... . I think it would of made a mock- ery of the whole situation ifi had gone on the runway wearing Union sweatpants. I expressed my concern about this to them and sug- gested that 1hey treat me like all the other models.\ At Rachel's suggestion, she was quickly outfitted withthe stunning black dress' you aU saw her wear- ing on her walk downthetunway. This \oversight\ on the part of the organizing committee is not just an isolated incident, but rather it is indicative of the way race is generally considered on this cam- pus. Rachel agreed, saying, \Race shouldn't be an afterthought .... I think it's pathetic that none of the people on the committee could think of any black or latina women to be in the show. They told. me that the models were chosen be- cause they were nontypical stu- dents who added things to the cam- pus, so from that standpoint, ifs absolutely ridiculous that they didn 'tchoose a woman of color to be in the show. I fnothing else, we have flavor to add to the campus, and our inclusion should have been obvious.\ It's really too bad that an event organized largely by students couldn't have thought about race any differently than our admis- sions office. Too eften race is thought of in terms of\quotas or \appropriate representation.\ The end result: race, which is an im- portant, living, breathing issue, is thought of in terms of numbers. Ideally the issue of race should not be about tokenism. Race is not merely about being sure to include one African American, one Latino, one Asian . The fair representa- tion of all races should be ideally somethingthat occurs naturally. Rachel had similar thoughts on the issue: \I think the idea was to represent the Union College stu- dent body. So, if they really in- tended to do this, an populations need to be represented and consid- ered- whetherthey '[the commit- tee J know theiR personal! y or not.\ The mistake made by the fash- ion show's organizing committee is thought to be merely an over- sight-glaring as it may be. Con- sequently, this \oversight\ sho'uld not mar an otherwise successful charity event with the potential to become a strong tradition-that is, if the student body can leamfrom this mistake and avoid it in the fu- ture. We all must realize that al- though Union is dominated by white upper-middle class students, it is by no means here for them alone. The student community can never be healthy until this realiza- tion is broadly made. r h u r b e r v iii e by Rawson Thurber Last week I slanted my Top Ten to the graduating seniors, and his week the theme continues. I've been hearii:1g interview horror tories for a term and a half, and with life after college becoming a eal possibility, I thought I'd lend a little advice to my fellow eniors and to anyone else trying to get a job for the summer or for he rest of his or her life. Without further nonsense, here's this eek's attempt. Top Ten Worst Jobs After College 10. Assistant Crack Whore 9. Cast Member.of \Snoopy on Ice\ 8. Toothless Yokel 7. Port-A-Potty Mechanic 6. Syringe Taster 5. Med School Cadaver 4. Fro-Yo Technician 3. President of Union College 2. Town Drunk L A Spice Girl Students oftlle Week: ls there really any question of who deserves the award this week? If you weren't at Union's Fashion Show of Support, then you nissedthemost splendid display of noble initiative and wondrous hilanthropy. Liza DeKoven,. Mike Ferguson, Ben Fox (his th.ird ward in as many weeks! Can anyone stop him?), Dave Kaufer, ·shley Ricllter, Sloane Silver, llissa Wuod, as well as the willing od'elsand the clubs who offered financial support are the winners • fthe award. Wouldthat I had more praise to give! M ostlmprovedAdministrtttor oftlie Week Award: WeU maybe this award i:a too specific, but without question President Hull des,erves such a honor. Not only was he willing to look stupid in front of the entire Union community, but he shocked the living he-Jesus out of everyone and \saved\ the Rink. In . addition, I have heard tell oftales of other benevolent action on his · part. As the tale goes; Roger saved not one but two students from p()lice custody at last term's Union/RPI hockey game. Is it possible that yours truly could have misread our president? Well, let's not get hasty, but these most recent o~currences se~m to indicate baby-steps toward a kinder, tnore aware president. Maybe . he should start wearing a cape around campus. Honestly, sincere kudos to Thuberville Enemy # 1.

Rated PG-13, Universal Pictures. Rating: ** 1/2 {outoffour) Perhaps some people should not be so quick to loathe Jim Carrey. Consider that he is one of the few actors who can \carry\ a film (no pun intended) to the top spot on opening weekend. Scripts are basically written around his borderline- psychotic personality. In a warped sense, he brings back the olden days ofHollywood> When certain stars were given the samerolesrepeatedly, and their characters single-handedly made a film a hit. Liar.Liaris a film patternednn this belief. r t would be nothing without Carrey. Eddie Murphy, Steve Martin, and Robin Williams ]Jut together could not create the same dynamics that Carreypalls off here so effortlessly. He is human silly putty, wiggling around and making all sorts ~f contortions and gestures which no sane per-son .should be allowed to get away with. The one-noteplothas Caney playing a ruthless lawyer, wl10is almost reaching full partnership in the firm for which he works. There is one problem-Carrey cannot tell the truth. He 1 ies to his clients, he lies to his son and tohisex-wife,he lies to his mother. His clients are all guilty souls for whom Carrey manages to win cases through manipula- tion and a little fibbing. Then, on his son's birthday,Carrey tells the ultimate lie. He prom- ises his son that he will be at his birthday party but instead ends up sleeping with the boss in his office. His son, while blowing outbirthday cake candles, 1nakes a wish that his father would tell the truth for just o11.e day. By some force ofunex- plainedmagic, the wish comes true, and on the one day when Caney's perfonnance in the courtroom could make him a full partner, the ace lawyer cannot lie for his client to win the case. He tries to get his son to take the wish back, but itdoesn'tw0rk: Carrey is forced to say exactly what's on his mind until the Autumn Portraits Brings Nice Breeze by Gabriela Dory Arts Editor On Friday and Saturday, April 11 and 12, Proctor's Too presented Autumn Portraits at the Yulman Theater. Master puppeteer Eric Bass presented his compelling and unforgettable puppet show to an audience of .students and the Schenectady community. Called \a master\ by The New York Times, Eric Bass seamlessly weaves his imagination and craft with the art of JapaneseBunruku puppetry into haunting and unique tales. The 45-minute show began in silence, thus breaking all · previous expectations for a pup- pet show. Mr. Bass composed his show with five portraits of pup- pets, who each had their own story and unique style. The first portraitwasofaStringPiayer, who struggled in front of an audience to untie himself from a knot that the puppet master put him into. Seemingly comical, the String Player's struggle to untie himself became disturbing and frustrating. child, and when she came to a field, she put her child under a tree for shade. While the child was under the tree, a crow appeared and soothed the child and stopped it from crying. f'he woman, horrified that the child was being eaten by the bird, grabbed her child and ran home:. When she confronted her hus- band with what she had wit- nessed, he chided her for mal<ing up stories. So, the next day she returned and placed her child un- der the tree, and when the bird appeared to soothe the child, the woman ran to get her husband, to prove to him what she had s:een. The husband came to the tree with his bow and aiTOW, and when he saw the bird sit on his child he aimed his arrow at the bird and fired. Just as the arrow was a bout to strike, the crow dodged the ar- row Instead of hitting the I:Jird, the arrow struck the child. each story. The puppets wore tiny masks or transformed their faces as they meet their past, their selves, and their deaths. For most of the perfonnance, Mr. Bass ma- nipulates the characters in full view of the audience, allowing the pub! ic to witness the creation pro- cess. Eric Bass has worked in the- ater as a director, playwright, per- former and mask, and puppet maker. In 1980, he created Au- tumn Portraits, which won First Prrze for best production at the International Puppetry Festival in Australia. His Sandglass Theater was founded in Munich, Ger- many in 1982. The company moved to Vermont in 1986,.and produces and presents shows for both children and adults. The audience was comfortably full, and the spectators seemed to enjoy and appreciate the cre- ation of an artist Near the end of his show, Mr. Bass ii:IVited some audience members to participate in a sketch and allowed five audi- ence members to make music witl1 miniature musical instruments as O'Neill sang a song about birds. Both entertaining and captivat- ing, Mr. Bass gave a compelling performance in an art fonn that is evening. Director Shadyac is not very well-known, but by now, he should be one of Hollywood's hot properties. He is respon- sible for starting Carrey's film careerwithAce Ventura: Pet Detective, and in addition to reviving Eddie Murphy's career with last year's The Nutty Proftssor, he has pumped life into Carrey's movies, as well. (Last year's The Cable Guy, directed by Ben Stiller, was probably the worst-marketed film of the year-and it wasn't good even as a comedy-thriller.) Shadyac's direction, however, is about as flat as the plains of Nebraska. Every shot is set-up to glorify one thing: Carrey's overacting. Fortunately, Carrey excels as only he can in going over-the- top a hundred times in a row. As the new boyfriend who is about to take Carrey's ex-wife across the country, Elwes is delightfully bland and well- meaning-the pertect com pi i- 1 \\'\'\ _;-L ' - ment to Carrey, even ifhe is underwritten. Tilly, as the sexy clientofCarrey's, who wants millions from her ex-husband and wants Carrey to do the lying in court, is the perfect backdrop - in the courtroom. However, no one is allowed to stretch their acting abilities here: this is Carrey' s show exclusively. In the end, Liar Liar is yet another addition to the list of contemporary films which bear ,the subtitle, \Ifyou've seen tile previews, you've already seen the movie.\ Although funny, Liar Liar does not stretch beyond the major jokes shown in the previews, and the drawn-out finale is overly sappy and never quite recreates the laugh-out- loud humor that it wants. Basically, when Liar Liar becomes another feel-good family film about the value of honesty and love, it is trite; but when Carrey is given free reign to act as wild and innovative as possible, the laughs are aplenty. The next portrait was of a pup- pet named O'Neill, and he broke the silence of the performance with a comical song and dance. His song, entitled the \Poorest Little Girl,\ was not very musical but very amusing. Bass' message was clear. It ended with the prophetic comrn~nt that we are destroying ourselves. In each of the five pieces in Au- tumn Portraits, a separate a.nd carefully constructed puJlpet does a mesmerizing dance ofdeli- cate and precise moveme!lts. Bass performs with genuine s:in- cetity and' shows great sensitiv- ity to his puppets and tohis craft. seldom practiced. This performance marked the 111••••••••••••111111•••••••1111 Bass' most memorable portrait, however, was of Maya, The Sto- ryteller, who recounted a tale of a young woman whose child had died.

De- spite the abnormal weather C()rJ- ditions consisting of sunshine;. drizzle, hail, and everythingdse .shortoflocusts, the Union sctu.ads showed determination, grit, a11d plenty of heart in this their sec• ond meet of the season. Starting of.f the day -for the men was the 4x200 consisting of Brian Roy, Steve Sierpina, Jas()n Jennings, and co-captain Dave Riggi. Despite Riggi taking ~rtf too soon before receiving the ll!'l- ton, Riggi blazed down the home- stretch to bring the team to third place in a time of 1:32.2. Freshman Kenny Scott ran a personal best in the steeplechase, while Max Weish looked stt:()ng as well making his season debut in this event. The 4x 1 00 team ran an impressive time of 43.55 tak- ing third place overall. The tan- dem of Jennings and Riggi ran third and fourth again on thi.s te- lay as well StefSierpina, despite having trouble with the firsttwo hurdles in the 400mHH, ran im- pressively in a time of 63.6. Steve McCann had a personally g()od day running a 4:24 in the 150() and a 17:01 in the 5K. In the 800m, senior Nick Conway made his season debut finishing ina time of2:01. Peter Flynn had a bit of an offday fin- ishing in 2:04. Co-captain Jay Goldberg ran the bizarro race ()f the day setting personal bests ()f 27 (200m) and 57( 400) during the 800 and hung on to finish in 2:05. Mike Martin continued to J'()ok strong in his adopted new race finishing in 2:11. The last event of the day, the distance medley relay came dllr- ing the rainy frigid portion of the meet. AJI four members of the squad were fatigued from races earlier in the day, but in a tremen- dous display of determination,,ran what was arguably one of the more exciting races of the day. Goldberg led off with an aggres- sive, yet strategic 1200m tom()ve from the back of the back ofthe pack to hand off in second place, with a split of3 :22. Scott was the man on the 400, steaming d<lwn the backstretch_ to hand off to Conway after a 54 split. Conway refused to yield to the Hartwick runner stalking him in the 800 segment, and handed off to Flynn still in second place. Flynn played his usual mind games with the competition, allowing them to get close, then ran away from them on the last lap to bring the team to a silver medal.

Turning to the women's com- petition, the Union athlete who personified determination and heart was clearly sophomore Charity MacManaman. MacManaman, despite imitating a submarine on the water obstacle on the second lap of the 2000m steeplechase, pressed on and to finish in an impressive time of 9:55. MacManaman later came back in the 400mH; andagainde'\ spite struggling with a hurdle on the turn, persevered to, finish strongly. Coach Larry Cottrell deemed Macmanaman's perfor- mance one ofthe high points of the day. Katie MacDowell continued . her torrid running in the i SOOm and ran a tenacious race to finish in a personal best 5:14. Coach Todd Donnly attr,ibuted MacDowell's outstanding race to a Ophenomenal week of practice ... [perhaps the] best all year.

Union Hosts UCAA Track & Field Championships Saturday Dutchm,en Participants Have Some Good Opportunities to Win by Jason Everett Sports Writer This coming Saturday, U11io11 College will play host to the Sec- ond Annual Outdoor UCAA Track & Field Championships. Some of the besttrack & field ath- letes in the state will be on dis- play in numerous events, includ- ing some of Union's own. While the Union women will look to play the role of spoiler in the teaJll competition, the men will attempt the impossible, trying to upset RPI and possible St. Lawerence. Although this is a tall feat, tJ1ere is a newfound sense of confidence with the squad not seen in a while. One of the highlights of tlle meet will clearly be the sho'N- down between Union's Dave Riggi and RPI's Krishaun Gilmore in the 1OOm, 200m, a11d 4x 100. Gilmore is the indoo£tla- tional champion in the 55m while Riggi is the defending state cham- pion in the 200m. In the 800rn~ Union's Pete Flynn will look for gold while Nick Conway looks to challenge as well. The 5000m race looks to be 011e of the fiercest races of the meet with Tom Capo of Hamilt()n, Lawton Redman of St. Lawerence, and Jamie O'Neil of RPI batt) ing for the top spot. The 3000m steeple chase also lool<s to be a battle with Union's Kenny Scott coming into form recent! y. In the relays, Union will look to defend its 4x800m title with three returning members from last year's squad. Conway, co-captain Ja,}' Goldberg, and Flym~ look to repeat and to get their squad in order for states two weeks later where they have another title to defend. In the 4x400, Union will look to upset with the squad of Flynn, Conway, Riggi, and Jason Jennings. Jennings and Riggi are newcomers tO' the 400, although Riggi is easily capable of turning a 52 second performance. The 4x I 00 team will also look to score but will have to contend with the talented RPf team.

Last Tuesday, the Union Men's Tennis Team realized how dev'- astating it could be playing a team like Binghamton in a dimate 1il<e that of northern Canada. Suffer- ing their first loss of the season? the Dutchmen knew that tlley could not make the weath-er change. They could, however~ change the outcome of their matches. Exactly two days ancl nine matches later, the Dutchme11 were able to defeat the RPI Engi- neers by a score of7-2. On Thursday, April 8, the co lei weather prevailed, as did the Union College Tennis Program. As captain Jordan Pinsker so el- egantly put it, \We kicked their [butt] .... You can quote me 011 that.\ He meant ittoo. The team rebounded well after ihe Binghamton match. \After a tough loss on Tuesday~ they hung in there and played up to their potential against an op- ponent with similar playing lev- els,\ stated Coach Bill Scanlon. If playing up to their potential is defined with a slaughter over arch rival RPI, then Union Tennis fans can expect a lot from these guys in the coming months. Although the score reflects a lopsided result in favor ofUnio11, both captain Jordan Pinsker's a11d senior powerhouse Sam Berger's matches lasted three sets. Pinsl<er, after dropping the first set 2-6, went on to a 7-6 (7-2) second-set win, and he closed out the match with a huge 6-2 third-set victory. Berger started off strong by tak- ing the first set 6-2. Then, aiter he dropped the second set 3-6, Berger reached from inside after defending off three match points and walked away with the third set, 7-6 (7-5), and the match Pinsker started at the top seed, while Berger held the number three slot. Freshman Jared Sheikh came out victorious as well ( 6-2, 6-3). \We were so much better .. we showed a greater mental toughness than RPI,\ said Scanlon. Ofthe top five starters on the team, two of them are freshman--Sheikh and Josh Winograd. The team, with three of its top six players as freshmen, looks to remain stable for the next few years. The next team that the Dutchmen face is Utica. History has shown Utica's tennis program to be lacking in more ways than one. The Dutchmen should have no problem in defeating them in singles. Scanlon, however, is a bit wor- ried about Union's doubles. He believes that they need more time working together in order to be- come more acquainted with one another's game. The Dutchmen will travel to Utica this Tuesday, April IS in pursuit of another tri- umph. tin, Bryan Roy, Jesse Prisco,. and .Jennings look to place against another tough filed, inc! uding some talented long and triple jumpers frorn St. Lawerence. Other.events 't6 watch are: Lewis ofSt. Lawerence in the lO,OOOm; Knight of RPI iri the 3 K steeple chase; Basta of St. Lawerence in the high jump; So sa of Hamilton in the triple jump and Pestelli ·of RPI in the discus. Turning to the women's com- petition, Union will field its larg- est team in recent memory. Al- though the women will be hard pressed to fin ish in the top three teams behind St. Lawerence,.

TIGER'STA·LE This past week in sports will' obviously be remembered for the spectacular and memo-rable per- fonnance ofTigerWoods at the· Masters .. He blitzed the field by an outrageous 12 shot::;. At the age of 21, Tiger is the youngest player ever to win the first major of the PGA season. I do not think words can CoF1vey what an accomplishment this was for him and for the sport of golf. Tiger broke the course record of 17 un- der par tied by J aek Nicklaus and Ray Floyd by a stroke. I· do not have enough space in this article to list the numbe'r of records he either tied or broke at Augusta National. He played the infamous Amen Corner and back nine at 16 under par. His average driving distance was well over 300 yards, which enabled him to reach aU the par fives in two shots. Par fives for him played like long par fours, which is a huge advantage that he had over the restofthefield. 'His victory also assures himofaspot on the 12-inan Ryder Cup Team, · which will challenge Europe in the biennial matchesthisSeptem- ber in Spain. Tiger now has are- alistic oppertunity to caJJture the Grand Slam in golf, which would · be quite a teat, by winning the US ·OpeR, The British Open, and the PGA Championship in August. , Woodshas brought much needed excitement and anticipation to all the,events that be decides to play. He is to golf what Michael Jor- dan is to basketball AND THE \OSCAR\ GOES TO ... DE LA HOY A This past Saturday night at the Thomas & Mack Center in Las Vegas, Oscar De La Hoya de- feated Pernell ·\Sweat Pea\ Whitaker in a'12-' round unani- mous decision for Whitaker's Middleweight championship belt. The judges' score-cards did notre- fleet how close the fight reaUy was. Two of them had De La Hoya winning 116..: ll 0, and the third judge had him winning by a score of 115-111. Whitaker in an early round lost a point for an in- advertent head butt. Whitaker regained that point by knocking · down the challenger.

RACE ON FOR \THE CUP\ The NHL playoffs begin this week with some very interesting first- round match-ups especially the Philadelphia-Pittsburgh match-up. Philadelphia has the home ice advantage in this series. The Flyers failed in their bid to overtake New Jersey for the num- her one seed and home ice throughout the playoffs. Super- stars abound in this series, from Mario to Lindros to Jagr to Leclair, among others. Scoring is not a problem for these teams. These teams' weaknesses are evi- den-t in their defense and goaltend.ing. Whether Ken W regget for the Pens and Hextall for the Flyers come up big are the keys that will decide the out- come of this series. On a sad note, Mario Lemieux is going to retire at the end of the season, after a stellar career which would have been even better had he not had to battle Hodgkin's Disease and chronic back problems. An- other exciting first-round series is out west between the Phoenix Coyotes and the Mighty Ducks from Anaheim. Once again, a lot of goals should be scored in this four-five match up. Phoe- nix has one of the best power for- wards in hockey in Keith Tkachuk; the first 50-goal scorer this season. Anaheim has the lethal one-two combination of Teemu Selanne and Paul Kariya, who are both tremendously ex- citing to watch. I believe that the winner of this series, which probably will be Anaheim, will upset the number one seed and defending Stanley Cup Champion Colorado Avalanche assuming Colorado gets by Chicago in their first round series. Some other battles to watch is the Rangers- Panthers series, another four-five tussle. I think the winner of this series will be the team that can put the puck in the net more of- ten. Both teams have fantastic goaltending and defense. The Rangers did not pay the big bucks for the Great One for the regular season, but for what he brings to the team come playoff time. Gretzky, along with Messier, if they both stay healthy, will de- feat the Panthers in sevengames. The NHL playoffs are ex- tremely entertaining and exciting, even if they do not crown a cham- pion until mid-June. Last year ·everyone predicted Detroit to win it all, and they lost to the even- tual champion Avalanche in the Western Conference Finals. This year no one is talking about them. They are just going along doing their own thing. With the addition of Shanahan and the solid, if not spectacular, goaltending of Osgood and Vernon, look for the Red Wings to beat the Flyers in a memorable Championship and to hoist Lord Stanley's Cup. Men's Lacrosse Team Struggles in Two Defeats With Major Rivals on the Road This Weekend, the Dutchmen Need Momentum by Jamie Griffin Sports Writer The Union Men's Lacrosse team had two very difficult games this past week. They came out of the week with a 1-3 record. They played the first game of the week against a highly-ranked Middlebury team, and they played Saturday's game against Oswego State.

This past Saturday, the women's rugby team ventured to Vermont to battle Middlebury College. After a two..: hour drive, the team's excitement had dwindled due to the constant sight of cows along the way. The 30 Dutchwomen got off ofthe bus to face the huge 50'-woman Middlebury squad. The large number of players and the cold weather soon took their toll on the smaller Union team. The serum members, Naomi Hare! and Katie Conway, found that although the- Middlebury team consisted of. skinny little girls in blue, they did have a tremendous amount of speed. Their speed, combined with their ability to get the ball and to ·pass it on to the line quickly, sur- prised the Dutchwomen defense; Middlebury capitalized on this by scoring three times. Union was unable to rebound from the quick scoring outburst. Although not victorious, the team will have its chance this weekend to show all that are in- terested what Union is truly made of. \The Beastofthe EastTour- nament\ is being held at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island. Both of Union's rugby squads will be in attendance. If, by some fluke of nature, you hap- pen to be passing through the smallest state in America, stop by and watch. ffyou cannot make it, then be prepared for some battle stories, bruises, and hope- fully a chant of victory. - ..

Scoring Outburst in Dutchwomen Victories Union Players Respond After Middlebury Trouncing by Geoff Sullivan Sports Editor. Coming offa horrendous per- fonnance against a strong Middlebury team, the women's lacrosse team had a great deal to prove to themselves heading into a weekend series at St. Lawrence and Clarkson. With their record standing at 2-5, the weekend se- ries became even more vital ifthe team had any hopes of finishing over .500 this season. Scoring aFt astonishing 30 goals in just two games certainly helped their cause, as the Dutchwomen were able to roll to a 13-7 victory over St. Lawrence and a 17 -I victory over Clarkson. In the first game against St. Lawrence, junior tri-captain Lauren Pastor continued her im- pressive scoring streak by netting a total of five goals and assisting on another. \We played really well as a team\ said Pastor \Our hearts and spirits were in the game, which was important after such an upsettin-g loss to Middlebury.\ Senior tri-captain Allison Wil- liams contributed in the offensive attack by adding two goals, as did teammates Abby Harris and Liz Kittleman. Goalie Maura Woessner saved 12 of the Saints 18 shots, l!e:l!ping the Dutchwomen to victory. The next day was no different for the Dutchwonaen, as they were able to continuetheir impressive offensive attack !by posting their first back to bad victories of the season. Junior tri-captain Lauren Pas- tor once again adKJecl three goals, as did fellow ju:ni<lr tri-captain Becca Wright Junior Liz Kittleman feltthat the win could act as a spark i11;igniting the team for the secondha:Jf ofthe season. \This game gave us the experi- ence and confide11ce that we were desperately searching for\ Not to be over.shadowed by the strong offensi'l.e:: attack was the solid defensive performance of sophomore Jessica Paige.

On Tues- day, the team travels to Siena to play the Saints in ali PM match- up. Currently, their.record stands at 3-4. The Dutchwome11 are deter- mined to even out their record and continue their current winning streak. If their offensive attack continues, the team should have no problem in posting more vic- tories, giving them a realistic chance at making tile playoffs next month. Softball Tries to Climb Back to th·e .500 Mark After a Rough Florida Trip, the Dutchwomen are Determined to Win by Carrie Heroth Sports Wl'iter After a disappointing 2-7-1 run in Florida, the Union softball team is looking forward to a more promising season up north. Al- though the win column may not show it, tl1e team came back to Union with some valuable learn- ing experiences to start their regLt- lar season. After graduating only three se- niors from last year's squad, head coach Brian Speck hopes to lead his team to a successful season. Led by captains Amy Nyren and Carrie Heroth, this year's team fields six retLtrning starters, in- cluding junior J>itcher Danielle LaCrosse, soplt:otl1orc infielder Shannon Lawlor. sophomore in- fielder/outfieLder Taryn Samol and sophomore outfielder Deb Cederbaum ani is backed by a strong arsenal off the bench. With eight newcomers. the Dutch women l1ope to improve on last year's rec<Jrd <Jf 12-20. The season go0t off to a rocky start when the women visited un- defeated Bingl1a1nton on April3. In the first game U111on came up scoreless as Bi ngha111ton' s pitcher hurled a one hitter. The second game saw a little bitofimprove- ment for the Dutchwomen, as freshman Stephanie Sienkiewicz a hit two-run double in the sixth. Union's rally fell short, however. in the 7-3 loss. Union was able to bounce back from two disappointing losses to take on Hartwick f<lr t11eir home opener. The outlo()k did not look bright, as Hartwick took a quick 7-0 first-inning lead; but Union fought back through frigid tcm- peratmes and snow tllurries to shut Hartwick out for 1h e rest of the game. Shannon Lawlor recorded a three-run doubJ,e with four RBT's. DebCederbaum also pro- duced a three-run clouble, and Amy Nyren drove :in three runs to lead Union's attack. Union prevailed 16-7. The Dutchwom en brought out the bats in the second game as well, defeating Hartwick 11-3. Cederbaum stepped in as a pinch hitter to nail a t\m-run single, breaking. tl1e game open in a six- run fourth inning Freshman catcher Beth Gabriel added a single and a triple to the attack. Union next traveled to Will- iams to bee two disheartening defeats.

Unio11 saw victory in the second game as well with freshman pitcher Melanie Barbato on the motmd. Barbato recorded her first collegiate com- plete-game victory without giv- ing up any earned runs. Union went on to defeat Hamilton 6-2. With a respectable record of4- 4, Speck's young squad hopes to build on the positives Comment- ing on his outlook for the remain- der of the season, Speck feels, \We have heaten the teams that we should beat, and we have lost to the teams tl1at have 11istoricallv he en hetter than us · Our goal no\ v is to r:-~isc our level ()f pl:ly to n point where we can heat some of the teams th~t \\ e h:t.\'Cn 't a·I\\':JV~ had 3~ much succcs-; with With a voung: te~111 inch1ding seven frC'shm~n :1nd fiw· -;opbomores IW hope to find a nwre consis- tent level ofrlav\ Sltannon Lawlor cracks afly-ballto left .field, givlr.~g tire Dutclrwomen a lift (plwto by Lauri.e Eirsc/mer) llnion returned home once ~1gain with a chan\>l' to e\ en nut their record :ts. the\' f:-~ccd l!;lln ilto11 Colle gc 011 Frid:w \\'ith a fl'\\ carl\ errors. the fir~t game seemed to be going in llamilton \s direct io111 until Samol stepped to the plate in the hottom of the seventh inni11g with bases loaded.

The other organization vying for the space was the newly-formed Tree House theme.house, which will be located next year in the basement ofFox Hall. Both groups submit~ ted written praposals and pre- sented their cases before the SAC. AE Pi, currently at 708 Unio{l Street, will house 21 of its 28 brothers in Chester Arthur. Jonathan Zandman, Lieutenant Master of AE Pi, was heavily in- volved in the proposal process on the fraternity's behalf. According to Zandman, the benefi~ of be- in~ on-campus are twmerous. \Our reason for wanting to live on-campus is that living t()gether as a group promotes better otga· nization, better functionality,\ he said. \It promotes motivation, and better brotherhood and fraternity, which is a woncierful th.ing.\ Zandman aJs() emphasized that being situated on-campus gives AE Pi the opportllnity to increase its interaction witll the rest ofthe student body. '\The bottom line is that [now] nobody goes to any of our events because we're off- campus. It doesn't matter how many signs we put up in t~e col- lege center, people aren't going to come because the mentality at Union is that in:si<le the fences is where you want td stay.\ Next year, the house pLans to host a va- riety of events, inclu:ding movie nights, falafel nights, and a multicultural series in conjunc- tion wjth organi.:zatlons such as CELAandASU \Liv.ing on-campus represents a new level for fraternities/' Zandman contin ucd. «Having a house increases Ollf capability to put on good events.

Tl1e original budget proposal, put together and presented by seniors Michael Ferguson and R.awson Thurber, was submitted to the Finance Committee forrnore than double that sum, totaling $4,205.80. Throughout the discussion re- garding VLA' s pmposal, anum- ber of concemed students, as well as Student Forum representatives, questioned the club's request of such a large amount of student moneys at the end of the fiscal year. The large percentage of se- nior members of VLA spawned additional skepticism surround- ing the club's potential for sur- vi val. Discrepancies between the club's \proposed\ mission and their actual activities to date were also scrutinized. VLA 's Missi()n VLA 's mission statement, as and Finance Committee, is \to create, explme, and present visual productions, showcasing indi- viduals and experiences at Union College.\ However, as pointed out by Student Forum represen- tative Arielle Liberman, the club's budget proposal outlines expenditures for equipment and services related only to film pro- duction. Mike Ferguson re- sponded to Liberman's concern by stating that the majority of VLA members wanted to pursue a film project. Other members of the Forum stated that Student A c- tivities already possessed such videoequipment requested by the VLA. However, it is unclear at this pointthat there is indeed such an overwhelming interest in film, since a number of the members showed a preference towards other mediums of visual expres- sion. Yet, sup pi ies for the produc- . tion and exhibition of projects within these mediums were not included as part of the budget pro- posal. Curious! y, a number of so- called \members\ on the official VLA roster (submitted with the formal club proposal) are not in- terested in pursuing any role in the VLA at all and at least one member of the original roster was - . . t··\\\'\' .. \'..;.. ...... -~ ... ~--·-'-\'·._.. ~~ .... -·~ ......... ~ , 11ew /rome of AEIT (plwto by Laurie Kirsclmer/TC) ship.

original m.embership roster. When questioned, Ferguson at- tributedthis to mere coincidence, though Thurber could not be reached for cotnment. At the Student Forum meeting, Ferguson indicated that Union's Visnal Arts Department.had of- fered little support for the new club and was not directly related tothe VLA . Aconcerne.d senior visual artsmajor pointed out that neither the Visual Arts Depart- ment nor any senior art majors were actually contacted to. offer support or advice in club plan- ning. FeJ;guson then .responded by referring to the fact that senior VLA member David ''Trey\ Coscia had ~ontacted ine1nbers of the Art History Department (a subdivision of the Visual Arts Dept.) aboutthe VLA. Professor Charlotte Eyerman, professor of Art Hi:::;tory and Coscia's faculty advisor commented on behalf of the Visual Arts Dept .. stating, 'The Visual Arts Depart1nent was surprised that there was discus- sion about a visual arts-related club and disappointed to learn that it had been suggested at a Student Forum Meeting that the d.~partment was aware of the ex- istence of this club.\ Not one member of Union's Visual Arts Depart1nent faculty or staff had any knowledge of the existence or activity of the VLA before VLA Funding .. .. continued from page 1 questioned by The Concordiensis.

Thurber and Ferguson stat- ing that the Finance Cotnmittee used ''less-than-due improper procedural cons:iderat ioRs.\ Finance Flaws Thtrrber and Ferguson also When the VLA went before the claimed that they \didn't ask the Finance Committee, numerous questions were raised regarding the finances. ofthe club. Accord- ing to senior finance representa- tive Dana Katz, the only major support for the excessive amount of money requested by VLA was from senior finance. representa- tive Ben Fox. Fox simply stated. that Thurber and Ferguson are \really good, dedicated guys.\ After a 2-2 tie was reached, Vice President ofthe Finance Commit- tee, junior Kevin Abessi, wanted to assume that sophomore finance representativ.e Jamie Drown, who was absent from the meeting, would vote in favor of the fund- ing. When this id~a was rebuffed, Abessi suggested calling Drown by telephone, another illegal pro- cedure according to finance by- laws. Though Abessi. stated in Thursday's Forum meeting that he was the ''only disintere·sted party\ concerning VLA 's fi- nances, he; according to Katz<; \excitedly remembered that he can be a tiebreaker and voted the proper questions/' clouding their decisions. The letter proceeded to explain the Finance Commit- tee bylaws to the ltlembers. Also following the m.eeting, Abessi reportedly asked a finance representative·toresign for using personal feelings as motives in veting. When Abessi was ques- tioned about this .in the Forum meeting, as such action is prohib- ited by Union's Committee on Committees, Abessi stated he did not ask the representative to step down; but instead \recom- Inended\ that the representative resign. No official link to VLA has been drawn to Abessi, how- ever. Conflict of Interests? Another confusing issue sur- rounding the intentions of the VLA and its members is the claim by Ferguson that the VLA is a club offering creative <)pportl!ni- ties for students with a \casual interesf' in the visual arts outside the realm of academia. He em- phasized at the Student Forum meeting the extracurricular nature of the club, explainillg its desire . to not be direct! y integrated With any ac!ldemic depamnent. How- ever, three senior members ofthe VLA, including Ferguson, are currently registered in indepen- dent studies for academic credit through Union's EnglishDepart- ment. Rawson Thurber and David \Trey\ Coscia are working OR a \creative visual~' indepen- dent project under Pmfessor Pe- ter Heinegg. FergusoiJ is pursu- ing an independent project under Professor Hugh Jenkins. Heinegg, recently returning to campus after a pers()nal leave, commented that he Wqsnotaware ofthe \financial implications\ of the VLA 's budget proposal, how his students were actually in- volved in the cl.ub, M what his own role was in Thurber and Coscia· s project. Jenkins was hesitant to comment (>)llthc issue, only confirming that Ferguson is indeed enrolled in an ir1depcndent study project under his direction.

Local News in Brief All .Information Derived From Tile Daily Gazette and Other Wire Services Rental Cars at Eighteen Many young people. especially students attending college away from home, find it necessary to rent vehicles for weekend: geta- ways, vacations, or just go back home to visit family. Unfortunately, several car rental companies in New York have refused to rent to drivers under the age of25, even if they have a clean driving record. This is discrimination against young people, and the car rental companies' excuse for the prac- tice does not justify violating a New York State law that specifi- cally prohibits this practice. Last week, the New York Court of Appeals agreed with me and found that it is illegal forcarrental companies to discriminate against drivers over the age of J 8 solely on the basis ofage. The high court's decision was in I ine with other lower court rul- .fngs, which held that the specific law in question was designed to protect car rental consumers, not the companies. This case involved Hertz, A vis, National and Budget car rental companies, who have refused to rentto persons under age25, a11d Enterprise, Dollar, Thrifty, and Alamo, who have refused to rent to persons under21 , . The cGinpanies.argued that.they . could discriminate because insur ... ance was not available for young drivers. Insurance was available, through the New York Automo- bile Insurance Plan, also known as the assigned risk pool. It was the contention of State Attorney General Dennis C. Vacca that the General Business Law statute was specifically de- signed to prevent age discrimina- tion against young drivers. This law provides that it is unlawful for a rental car company to discrimi- nate against anyone over the age of 18 solely on the basis of age. provided that insurance is avail- able for such persons. Clearly, the intent of this law was to gi-ve young adults their full rights as ·Citizens of this state. Legislative proceedings leading up to·the enactment of this law in 1977 supports Vacco' s argument. This law makes sense because the practice oftmt rentingcars to young people places. an undue hardship on them. In many in- stances, it's a case of inconve- nience. But in others, it can seri- ously interfere with work or im- portant personal matters. Although the practice of deny- ing; car rentals to young people is widespread, it is nonetheless ille- gal. That's why lawsuits were pursued against these car rental companies and am pleased that I prevailed for New York'syoung people. But this court decision does not close the book on car rental com- pany complaints Recently, Vacco launched a probe into al- leged bias against Orthodox Jews by one of the nation's leading most rental companies, Avis. A vis has been accused in nu- merous press reports of refusing car rentals to Jewish News York- ers, or phone customers with \Jewish accents.\ Denying services to an indi- vidual based on the it ethnicity or religion violates every principle of American fairness and justice, and it will not be tolerated. Li- censed drivers who feel they have been unjustly refused access t0 rental cars in New York should contact Vacco 's Consumer Hotline at 1-800-771-7 755 and ask for a consumer complaint tonn.

Mandeville, a 1945 Union Sends 46 Students to NCUR Conference by Jennifer Caruso Contributing Writel\ The eleventh National Confer- ence on Undergraduate Research (NCUR) will be held at the Uri.i- versity of Texas from April 24 through 26. NCUR is a confer- ence that seeks to support the re- search of undergraduate students, scholarship, and creative projects in numerous fields of study. At the conference the students will display their research in ei- ther 15 minute oral presentations, poster sessions, or artistic perfor- mances. The purpose of NCUR is to \encourage awareness of 1.mder: graduate research, and creative opportunities as they exist in vari- ous disciplines and typesofinsti- tutions; to commensurate the re- suits ofstudent-mentorprogr£uns; and encourage the pursuit of ad- vanced study and academic ca- reer.\ Union will be one of over 200 colleges and universities repre- sented at the conference. Union has played a key role in NCUR by hosting the conference twice (1990, 1995) and sending more students combined than any other. school in the country. Professors Werner (Chemistry), Professor Adrian (Chemistry), Professor Ghaly (Civil Engineering), and Professor Danowski (Biology) wiU be accompanying 46 Union students to Texas.

Smoke Issue in Custody Cases Smoking has recently become an issue In divorce cases. If a par- ent is a smoker, judges are con- templating thehealth ofthe child, especially iffhey have asthma or allergies.· A parent who smokes is an im- portant factor in abiding by the child'sbest interests, according to universal standards. Judges look at the issue as caus- ing health problems as well as setting a poor example, Some lawyers feel that smok- ing should not be the main factor In deciding between the parents. They think that a child's relation- ship with their parent is more im- portant, lest the situation be hin- dered by health problems. · As of now, there is no national standard on how to deal with par- ents who smoke. The effects it will have on custody cases is stiH in the preliminary stages, though judges and lawyers are aware of the issue. Drink Alcohol: No Spol'ts In Duanesburg, several High School athletes were allegedly cepted.\ He teels that \it is ex~ tremely valuable for students to participate in undergraduate re- search and NCUR is a great op- portunity to present this.\ Lewis also wanted to thank Kathy Hopper for helping Union to make it possible to have the op- portunity to attend NCUR. The, trip is paid for by the college's funds forundergraduate research. At least one student will be rep- . resenting every department of drinking alcohol at a party and are being threatened to he kicked off the.ir teams for the spring season. · Altllough the .investigation is still underway, according to au- thorities, the Superintendent Lewis 9eFilippi; \does not thirtk it would be enough to wipe out the roster of any one team.\ The school took the rnatter ililto their own hands and were more concerned witl1 the breaking of school policy which states penal- ties for consuming alcohol dur- ing the sports season. Betsy McCaughey Out of Ra-ce This week, Governor George Pataki told Lt. Governor Betsy McCaughey Ross that she was off his 1998 re-election dance card. He accused her of talking with their enemies, supporting policies opposed by the administration, challenging her own party's state senate leader,. and embarrassing a powerful Republican patron. McCaughey Ross expects to re- .. maitt in politics and nm for of- fice as a Republican in 1998: She was said to have gone off on her own as opposed to being a team player. McCaughey Ross' official job is to preside over the state senate. However, she took the initiative of taking on the Republ·ican leader.ofthat chamber in support of Democratic--backed health care legislation. She has also alledgedly asked her secretary to lie and misuse other privileges.

Feature-s Does the Direction of Tollet Paper ReaDy Matter? by Jeffrey Druzba Staff Writer The last time I was home, I noticed something interesting about our bathroom. People have different toilet paper rolling pref- erences. Just about everyone has their own preference that makes them feel just right. Sometimes, toilet. paper that tolls the wrong way can make for an uncomfort\ able stay in the bathroom: At home, my parents happen to both prefer toilet paper that rolls from underneath. My parents have been marri€d fortwenty five years and l think that one of the reasons is that they both prefer under~ rolling oftheir toilet paper .. What else could explain increas- ing rates of divorce in the. United States?

Union Women March on Washington For NOW by Autumn Cohen Contributing Writer On Thursday, April 10, seven members ofthe Womyn's Union drove down to Washington DC for a Young Feminist Summit sponsored by the National Orga- nization for Women (NOW). Starting the next morning and lasting until Sunday afternoon, the conference was filled with workshops, discussion groups, skills building sessions, speakers, action plans, and culminated. in a march to the White House. At- tended by 1200 men and women from across the country, this sum- mit was a unique opportunity for feminists everywhere to get to- gether and learn from one an- other; sharing ideas and beliefs not only about women's issues, but about many issues of justice and equality. Coinciding with the summit, on Saturday evening there was a Take Back the Night rally and march at Dupont Circle, which was organized by the DC Rape Crisis Center. After listen- ing to various speakers and mu- sicians, about 200 men and women took to the streets with signs and chants that demanded for a world free of violence ,. against women. All in all, it was a successful and enjoyable week- end. To conclude; sonte of the members ofthe Womyn's Union that went to DC have chosen to write their o~n personal re~ sponses to the weekend, given · that each of us attended different workshops and discussions at the summit. Furthermore, by includ- ing different reactions, it serves as example that feminism itself cannot be limited to one uniform · ideology. The Womyn 's Union welcomes the voice of both women and men to our group; as we work together to achieve a Union that is equitable and fair to alL Having focused my last four years of study at Union on issues that concern women, I found that many of the workshops at the summit were focused on subject matter that I had heard before. Regardless ofthis fact, I greatly benefited from I istening to the other women and men who were in attendance, and further grasp- ing the diversity of ideas within thefeministmovement. Onedis- cussion group in particular, which examined the concept that women can adhere te actions or beliefs that do not seem to fit into the structures of feminism and still call themselves feminists, was particularly enjoyable forme. As my own ideas have developed over the years, I have found that I place a lot more emphasis on m ysel.f for definitions, rather than lo<Jking toamovem,ent to follow. Although the group did not come to a conclusion (no·r did it try to) that satisfied everyone in the room, there was still a general agreement that feminism is really about women having the ability to experience independence on all counts. As of late, in my own mind, it is also about the freedom of expression and individuality. Notso much about being specjfi- cally a woman, but just being a person in whatever way that developsJ also had a great time at the Take Back the Night march. lfelt as though there was a river of power that took over the streets and demanded for justice and equality. The passion of the weekend-filled with 1200 other proactive and compassionate in- dividuals-gave me a renewed sense of hope for the future. - Autumn B. Cohen '97 The conference offered so many different workshop oppor- tunities that it was difficult to de- cide on what to attend. Although a few of the session I attended were centered on issues I was fairly aware of such as sexual as- sault on campuses, they all were worthwhile because it was a chance to hear from women and men with different backgrounds and unique perspectives of femi- nism. The most interesting ses- sion [ attended discussed issues of economic independence and security for women. Many would not think of this topic as a femi- nist issue, but in reality I believe it is one of the most important is- sues for modern women. With- out financial security and equal paying careers, women will for· ever be dependent on others for their well-being. Financial plan- ning must be an issue women are well educated about and willing to place in their \realm .. \ I never thought I would ever understand what a mutual fund or money market account was but a two- hour seminar really helped!The entire conference really broad- continued on page 14

Say Hello to Cowardice at Its Best How Something So Simple Can Turn Into an Ordeal by Michelle Tham Features Editor When I was six years old, I al- most went home with some woman in my mom's night school class. I just sort of followed her out the door while my mom was chatting with the teacher, I was one ofthose outgoing, talk-your- head-off kids that didn't under .. stand the meaning of the word .. quiet.\ I would gab with anyone {or anything for that matter) in sight. And though. conversation is still one of my favorite and some- times irritating habits, I've found that my desire to attack people with words has sort of faded. Something funny happens as you grow older, saying '\hi\ becomes a big deal and avoiding eye con- tact is sometimes like running from the plague. Basically, everyone has expe- rienced the \let's pretend I don't really see you\ phenomenon. It usually kicks in after an embar- rassing night or an animated fight with someone you can't really bear to face anymore. A voidance is one of our favor- ite escapes from confrontation. Of course, I've been disregarded a time or two in perfectly public at- mospheres where I've known tor a fact that someone did see me, and only pretended not to see me. I've always figured it was just a part of human nature. And, ac- cordingly, I assumed that I was innocent of the vile deed. We rarely want to believe that we are capable of such acts of insensi- tivity. Somewhere along the line as we grow older and increasingly conscious of what people around us are thinking, eye contact be- comes a sort of power struggle. Walking into the cafeteria can be hell if that one person you can't bearto see is standing .in line right ahead of you. Now; there is no humanly possible way that you donotseethis person. However, by strategically glaring at the pic- ture of the Nott on the waH you can avoid aU acknowledgment of their existence. Maybe you don't really notice them until you get to the salad bar; atthat pointeach individual carrot stick becomes utterly important and nothing can pull your gaze from those chick peas. It is quite a talent that we have allacquired, Iearningto become oblivious on c~;~e. It's one of those personal quirks that never really leavesyou. So, regardless of any almighty desires to:be mature and self-confidant in some sticky situations, there is always the one time you'll slip up. At~d you'll strangely find comfort in that little spot on your shoe that needs attention at justthe right moment. Everyone's equally guilty, and I honestly wish that I could get past tba-t character flaw. lt does make Tile feel sort of feeble and cowardly after avoiding someone. There ?s a sort ofpsychic connec. tion that occurs just at that point ·where you look right into someon;e'seyes and then glance away You both k1~ow what just happened, and it irks me to real- ize that the person I was avoid- ing knov;s ~ery well that I dear! y sawthern.

This reac- men. Before the twentieth cen- tionary view depicts WOI\(le_g sim- ply as housekeepers who put the rieeds of others before their own. Unlike their American counter- parts, women of Latin America did not find their role degrading, and the caretaking of a family Wl:lS the norm and sometimes even sacred. This is one of the major factors that keep Latin American Women in the home and out of colleges ahd corpora- tions. It is not that Latinas enjoy I ife in the home, rather, it is that these women value their families more than anything else. Women have reached these high standards in a few countries but they are still oppressed in many countries. While the Woman?s movement in Latin America is taking longer to achieve the social justice it wants, it has made great progress in the I ast two decades and when con- sidering the obstacles they faced on their way to progress, this is no small feat. Before the twentieth century women in Latin American coun- tries were owressed tremen- dously. Many wolTieo were seen unequal to men in everything. They were thought of being i~- tury and early in the century, women were seen as housewives. They would stay ho1ne and cook, take care of the children, make the husband happy after he came home from work, and clean the house. Latin American women were illiterate,jobless, pregnant, and had no major role in society. This was the way which young fe- males were raised by society. They would also obey their hus- bands which would show neglect towards the woinan. This extreme version of their role was devel- oped exclusively for poor women, women from the upper tiers of society were seen in the same way as young maidens were seen during the era of chivalry. While chivalry may be dead, this favoritism shown to women of higher classes is exhibited to this day, not only in Latin America, but Europe and America as well. As time passed however, women started to fight for their rights in society and control much ·Of their lives. The Women's Movement became a trend in many Latin American countries. They occurred early in the twen- tieth century in different coun- tries. Men and other conserva- tive groups were obv.iously op- posed to this change which was occurring in society. The earli~ ~ est forms of protest against the status quo were Las madres,_ mothers who protested against. the process of disappearance. This process was the murder of thousands ofpeople, and a gov- ernmental eoveNtp. From the Wars of Indepen-,: dence to the present, women'· have fully articulated their desire · to-participate fully in society, At · times they had to utilize whatever;. means.seemed necessary to do stt inc! uding siding with socialist: and following leaders who, at the . very least, gave them hope that. reform was 011 the: way. At other times women had to make their own vehicles. Despite all obstacles these women were detennined to imM prove their lives, \From washing, ironing, cooking, we came to the street to fight for the life of our children\ as one mother se clev- erly stated. The Mother's Move- ment occurred because women were tired of having to answer to their husbands. Also, men would be able to take their chil: drenand leave the womet:l with- out any economic accessibility. Women would be left helpless in life. They could be left without a family and homeless. Women were getting tired of being dependent on their hus- bands so they decided to fight back. They risked being looked down upon by society and being insulted for the chance to get some rights. After months and even years of fighting in coun- tries like Argentina and Haiti, many women were able to vote and go to school in order to im- prove their lives. - After aU of the movements which o~Ccurred in Latin Amefi- tor Antonia Pantoja who founded can countries ended, women be- theNationalPuerto Rican Forum, gan to i111prove their lives drasti- the Puerto Rican Association fot cally. 1heyno longer were forced Community Affairs, and the to depelld on men in order to sur- Puerto Rican Research_ Center. vive ins{)clety.

Union COllege in 1977: . - A Look Back at the Players and Events That Unfolded by Frank Rossi Editor-in-Chief It was a time of extreme up- seton the Union College cam- pus. Administrators resigned at an alarming pace. The students watched a hockey team materi- alize out of thin air, only to see those players disappear a short time later. The president ~as given a vote of no confi:dence by the faculty. This was the state of affairs at Union only twenty years ago, in 1977. President Bonner Enters On October 5, I 974, Thomas Neville Bo,nner became the fif- teenth president of Union Col- lege. He came here from the University ofNew Hampshire, where many critics believed he became too involved in the lo- cal political scene (some .even accused him of \turning his back on the faculty\). Bonner stated that Union had impressed him before he even took over the presidency. \It was a far better and stronger college than it was rated.\ Neville was anything but an orthodox Union president. He ~as married to Iris second wife, Carlene, in the Memorial Ch~pel early .in his presidency, and his presidency began with an interesting twist. Reverend Lawrence Achilles had set a major project in the lap of Bonner, the duty of putting to- gether a hockey team. Bonner felt that Union needed to stretch beyond its gates, and this meant a greater involvement in Union University. \As a historian, I was interested in Union's long- time connection with the profes- sional schools in Albany.\ Coach Harkness T() solve the hockey team problem, Bonner relied on former Detro it Red Wings coach Ned Harkness. Harkness led RJ>l and Cornell to national championships prior to coach- ing the Red Wings, so a Divi- sion II hockey program would not seem to be the likely place for Harkness to land as head coach. Bonner said, ''I hired Harkness, and he got pee-wee hockey in Achilles Rink He spent 24 hours a day there.\ Professor Ted Bick, math• ematics professor and member of the Presidential Advisory Board during Bonner's reign, received a warning about Harkness from an official at Hamilton College. The official told Sick, \You're in trouble.\ Bick stateil that when the hockey team arrived, their pres- ence was felt immediately. \We were ready to play the Soviet Army!\ In March of 1976, after only one season of hockey at Union, the team made the ECAC Divi- sion U playoffs. In a game against New Hampshire which Bonner helped ·to set up, the Dutchmen upset a UNH team which became the Division 1 na- hock:ey team~ Hick teNs the story of on h<iJckey player who spoke very I ittle English And had low $AT scores. \The ad- m.ss.ions committe-~ reJected Former Union President Thomas Neville Bonner tiona! champions that season. him 13-l.

Many people called tor hockey to jump to Di- . vision I, but NESCAC (New England Small College Athletic Conference) refused to allow Union to belong to NESCAC and bring hockey up to Division I. NESCAC believed that ath- letics were not to overshadow academics, and such a move by Union would have violated this philosophy. However, Bonner once told Underwood that he saw the expansion ofthe hockey program \as a means tor gain- ing visibility for the college.\ To begin the 1976-77 school year, Bonner also rocked the boat with the faculty. Accord- ing to Nichols, Bonner stated, \The end of the liberal arts col- lege has come.\ He advertised his new policy tor Union to be. a ••comprehensive college in a university setting.\ This join- ing of forces with Union Uni- versity had some less-than-fa- vorable implications, according to Nichols. \We were to think of ourselves as intimately con- nected to the Schenectady com- munity.\ tentions. The players were housed with local families in- stead of on campus·. Therefore, they had access to free dinners as I knew, the players met the admissions requirements .. Play- ers chose to come even without preferential packaging. l was surprised about how the team took off with freshmen. H started to raise swspkions that something was wrong with the program. There was never. any evidence that admissions rules had been broken.\ However, according to Bick, Jay Shupe stated that he was di- n~cted \by the president to ad- mit\ the formerly disapproved hockey p;layer. Bonner said then and now that tl1e answer to Shupe's charge is \categorically no.\ While the admissions ques- tions arose, so did the .task force report about the correct path of · Union athletics. The report, which was officially released on December.l6, 1976, stated that Union should notent~r Division I athletics and should remain a member of NESCAC. · ti:ons. NESCAC forbade coaches from performing in- heuse visits, but Harkness had, on several occasions; broken this,rul:e. The next day, ,Bonner suspended Harkness, conve- niently shortly after the end of the hockey season .. Later that week, Iilarkness ad- mi~ed in a Nel.V York Times ar- ticle,. \I lied, hut I lied to save my hockey program.\ Such events and talk did not surprise Underwood. \I don't think that Ned Harkness could restrain himself within the hm.mds of a small college. environment. He had unlimited self-confidence.\ Bick concurs. \Harkness is a driven man.\ Bicklearned that the former national champion coach WOLJld resort to softening. the ice surface if he was to face a fast team wh He he was at Co~neH and RPI.

Bick believes that the decisi'Qn was not a choice\ for the college, but instead; the only option. \We resigned from NESCAC before they kicked us out.\ A Yo- Yo Resignation After the mounting pressures of the NESCAC situation, ad- missions questions, and charac- ter issues, Bonner handed in his resignation to the Board of Trustees on April 16, 1977. Bonner commented, \It was be- coming unfavorable for the col- lege with the publicity and the attention. I was most concerned about the faculty an:d the board. Some oftl1e younger and sfron- ger members of the board at- tempted to reorganize the board. It was then I decided that I would stay on, but start my search for my successor.\ Around this time, there were also some irregularities in Union's First Modern-Day Hockey Coach, Ned Ha,rkness Two days later, he withdrew his resignation after the Board voted to show Banner confi- dence in his actions.

The vote was 1 02a29 against Bonnet.

There was never any public vote, and it was cir· culated ·among a closed groLJp. I thought it was an extremely unfair way to proceed.\ Bonner believed that th~ structme ofat- titudes around the school helped bring this criticism to a head. \There was a sense of conservatism ... of 'we don't want to change very much.' When the hockey controversy came up, it started to carry into my idea of the 'small college in a university setting.'\ Students became so enraged by Bonner's decisions thatthey asked that he not present the di- ploma covers to them the fol- lowing montll at graduation. Bonner agreed to comply with their request. Hockey Bites Bonner The new academic year in 1977 did not bring a clean slate to Bonner or Union College. On Oet'Ober S, l9'n, Dean of Students Mark Smith wrote a pointed letter to Bonner which was published in The Concordiensis. The former confidant of Bonner wrote, \l am the Dean of Students,_ b~t I am an educator, not a politi- cian.\ He also wrote, \For God;s sake,. let Union move . forward as thegreatteachingin- stitution that it is and can be .. \ Prior to writing the letter, Smith was granted a one-year contract extension with no possibility of further extension after he c.alled an administrator a tpul name in public during the NESCAC de- bate where the administrator at- tacked Smith's friend, Provost Willard Enteman's proposal. . Smith was fired by Bonner the day following the letter's print- ing Bonner was surprised by the attack. \I never spoke to Dean Smith after the letter was pub- lished. Out .of the blue, he just turned.\ With the decision made tore- main in Division II and leave NESCAC, Ned Harkness was not a happy coach. Nichols ex- plained a possibility of why · Harkness was ·unhappy. \Harkness later claimed that he was told Union would go to Di- vision l within a short period of time.\ It was obvious that this was not going to be a reality.

OP/EIJ Opinions The Importance of Seeing the \Big Picture'' This letter is in response-to sev- eral of the factually unfounded and severely d:istorted articles/ editorials in last week's edition. While I am all in support of free press and people's rights to ex- press their owri opinions, I was nonetheless quite disappointed with some of the opinions a few authors attempted to pass over as facts. From the beginning, I would I ike to make clear that I am not speaking on behalf of the Union's Fashion Show of Support Steering Committee. This letter is not a personal attack on anyone's opinions nor their writ ... ing styles, yet is meant to dear up some of the false \fads\ Rob Cohen and a few others attempted to pass off as the trutli. In my opinion, this is the truth. · Let's start with the purpose of the Fashion Show. The reason behind putting ontllis fashion was to raise money for sick children, first and foremost. It wasn't to show off the latest fashions Mr. Cohen, as you claimed in your last article thaf yotr couldn't see the \difference between the dothes worn on the catwalk and those W0ffi by Students here everyday, II Get the big picture here: it was not about the clothin-g, or the re- ception, or anything else. It was about the kids. I think 1 might emphasize that about 30 times in this-letter~ and I hope by the end, of this letter, this point will finally sink in. The second point{ would like to make is regarding the ·cast of tile Fashion Show. Since this was a Student Activities event, there are no secrets behind how much we spent to put on the show and how'much we raised in the pro· cess. Mr. Cohen falsely claims that he asked someone the cost of the event Sirice I was in charge of the fund-niising, I know for a fact that you didn't talk with me. When I asked the other meinbers of the committee if you had con- tacted them; none of them had ever heard from you. So who exactly is it you spoke with who didn't know how much the event cost? You also claim that you got the \impression that even if they had known the cost, they vvottfd not have told me.\ Here it is Rob, a little over $5,000. It's nota se- cret and it's not something I nor the committee am tryiJ1g to hide. . you can call it\ excessive\' as you did, but let's look at a the bigger picture. With the help of Clubs, Committees, President Hull, Fra- ternities, Sororities, Theme Houses, Parents, alumni and of course the student body (by the ·Way, did you buy a star?), we were able to present the Make A Wish Foundation with over $7,000 (donations have since cotne in). When wasthelasttime you saw so many people get to- . gether on a Friday Night in a non party setting, have a good time, cheer on their friends, and most importantly, raise money fm charity? It doesn't happen very often, but I for one am glad I was able to be a part ofthis! Getting back to the money, Mr. Cohen says that \it would have been a more successful event.. .if less money had beenspenton put- ting on the event together and more of it had been given to char- ity.\· This is surprisingly a good point, but n·ot well thought out Accordingtotheruleswhichgov- ertisttident aciivities on this cam- pus, one is not allowed to donate student activities funds on this campus to a charity (regardless of how good a cause we h_oth agree Make A Wish Foundation is). Thus, the committee was faced with 2 kinds ofcontributions. The first kind was discretionary funds. These funds could be used to put on the actual show or to donate directly to the foundation. They included generous contributions from parents, altunni,Fratemities, Sororities, money raised from the star fund-raiser, anonymous con- tributions (of which there were several) and of course admission atthedoor. Thesefundswentdi- rectlytotheMakeA WishFoun- dation. The second typeoffunds solicited were what I term as \fixed\ funds. These funds by law had to be used f0rthe actual show itself and included the gen- erous contributions of Clubs, Committees, Student Activities, President Hull, and The Dean's Office. You may or may not know that Union College is anon~ profit organization,thus nonprofit organizations cannot give money to other nonprofit organizations. If it were up to me (which it is not), I would love to have given some or all of these funds direct! y to the charity, but those are the rules and they were not nego- tiable. Mr. Cohen goes on to make another 'off the wall com- ment that \if we had a big walk- a-thon for Make A Wish and do- \ nated all the money spent on put- ting the fashion show together and the money raised, we could have given them $15,000.\ I'm all for- a walk-a-thon, but hon- _estly, how many people would ha\.·e showed up fora walk-a-thon .on a Friday night? and do you really think we would have raised $15,000? Do yoH have any con- cept how hard it is to ~aise that much money? Trust me, it's hard! l guess what ticked me off the most is people I ike you who com- plain about every good thing on campus, yet make no effort to do something better. I for one never received a call from you asking if you could help. Don't you think that would have been more con- structive than writing a column telling everyone how much ev- erything sucks, and how if \you werei n charge, things would have been much better.\ My advice to you: go out and do something in- stead·ofjust talking about it. Moving on, I would like to ad- dress Mr. Richman's (Jared) ar- ticle entitled \The Way of Style ai1d Charity.\ Mr. Richman's ar- ticle i.s a combination of skepti- cism and praise. Mr. Richman again questions the finances-ofthe event ahd just like Mr. Cohen, never contacted any of the mem- bers of the committee for the facts. He does strike a good point when he says that\ charity should be done for the sake of charity, not praise.\ Good poirit.Jared, but I think you offended every mem- ber of the committee when you said ~1at you were sickened by the \self congratulatory remarks of several of the show's organizers.\ That never happened, Mr. Richtnan! Agail'l,please try to see the big picture .. Sure I was happy that the event went well and raised a lot of money for a good cause~ but never once were we in for the \fame.\ You ought to know that there is no fame in stu- dent activities. This is colle e after all 1 Again though, Mr. Richman saw something which the other four individuals writing articles never saw, that is the sur- prise guest appearance of Ms. Marra. For those of you who do not know Ms. Marra, she has ·given a good portion of her life helping the studenfbody here at Union. Her 35 years of service was mentioned only once in last week's edition when Mr. Richman said that the \surprise addition ofMs. Marra to the cast of models made the show that much more special.\ Good call Jared, you and I both know how nice Ms. Marra is to every per- son who has the pleasure of meet- ing her. I only wish others had picked up on that. I could go on regarding a thou- sand other issues which I feel should be addressed, but I'll stop here. I would like to close with a thank you to all those who helped in making this one of the best events this college has ever seen. While I have thanked the count- less organizations and individu- als who helped out to make this event successful, I would also like to personally thank the models who donated countless hours practicing to make the show what it was. You see Mr. Cehen, this event wasn't about glorification or clothing, it was about raising money for sick children and pro- viding a social alternative which most of the campus could take part in . That's the big picture which I feel you lost sight of. Thanks again to everybody who took the time to make a differ- ence. Sincerely, Ben Fox Final Word on Fashion.Show it must be true that there is nothing to do this campus ifthe fashion must be agonized over for weeks. After teadins Conor McKenzie's articl ~ in lastweek 's paper I was kind of annoyed, it seemed like the whole point was being ignored and a completely over-rated topi-e was being brought up .again. For those of you who forgot, the fashion show was put on to raisernoney for the Make a Wish Foundation to help children. ., .. ferent as most of the minority stu- Tales From A Luggage Alumni How the issue of minority rep- resentation came up is beyond me.

Why did Sincerely, Jennifer Trotts ,, Tune in ~o WRUC Sunday I want to graduate early? Aside from saving my parents a mere $8500dollars in tuition, my early graduation has. allowed me to finally enjoy the college experience without the nuisance of. actually obtaining an education.

Unfortunately, tny mother actually has a subscription to the Concordy (she usually receives two i.ssues about every four months-), so now I have to go throqgh with writing this damn article. However, after finally com pi eting a 1 00-page thesis last term, 1 am sick of writing well- forme<!, grammatically-correct, and utterly boring papers.

I just haven't felt the same since they moved the Idol. With the advent of computers, the internet, and laser printers, it is no longer necessary to have t\Vo tenns to write a senior thesis; in fact, many students don't need more than two days.

Opinions The Importance of Seeing the \Big Picture\ This Jetter is in response-to sev- eral of the factually unfounded and severely distorted articles/ editorials in last week's edition. While I am all in support of free press and people's rights to ex- press their own opinions, I was nonetheless quite disappointed with some of the opinions a few authors attempted to pass over as facts. From the beginning, I would like to make cleartll.at I am not speaking on behalf of the Union's Fashion Show of Support Steering Committee. This letter is not a personal attack on anyone's opinions nor tl1eir writ- ing styles, yet is meant to clear up some ofthe false \facts\ Rob Cohen and a few others attempted to pass off as the truth. In my opinion, this is the truth. Let's start with the purpose of the Fashion Show. The reason behind putting on this fashion was to raise money for sick children, first and foremost. It wasn't to show off the latest fashions Mr. Cohen, as you claimed in your last article that you couldn't see the \difference between the clothes vvorn on the catwalk and those worn by students here everyday.\ Get the big picture here: it was n()t about the clothing, or there- ception, or anything else. It was about the kids. I think I might etnphasize that about 30 times in this letter, and I hope b:y the end ofthis letter, this point will finally sink in. The second point I would like to make is regarding the cost of the Fashion Show. Since this was a Student Activities event, there are no secrets behind how much we spent to put on the show and how much we raised in the pro- cess. Mr. Cohen falsely claims that he asked someone the cost of the event Since I was in charge ofthe fund-raising, I knovv for a fact that you didn't talk with me. When I asked the other members ofthe c01nmittee ifyou had con- tacted them, none of them had ever heard from you. So who exactly is it you spoke with who didn't know how much the event cost? You also claim that you got the \impression that even ifthey had known the cost, they would not have told me.\ Here it is Rob, a little over $5,000. It's not a se- cret and it's not son:tething 1 n0r the committee am trying to hide. You can call it \excessive\, as you did, but let's look at a the bigger picture. With the help of Clubs, Committees, President Hull, Fra- ternities, Sororities, Theme Houses, Parents, alumni and of course the student body (by the way, did you buy a star'?), we were able to present the Make A Wish Foundation with over $7,000 (donations have since come in). When was the last time you saw so many people get to- gether on a Friday Night ina non party setting, have a good time, cheer on their friends, and most importantly, raise money for charity? It doesn't happe11 very often, but I for one am glad I was able to be a part of this! Getting back to the money, Mr. Cohen says that \it would have been a more successful event...if less money had been spent on put- ting on the event together and moreofithad been given to char- ity.\ This is surprisingly a good point, but not well thought out Accordingtotheruleswhich gov- ern student activities on this cam- Final Word on Fashion Show lt must be true that there is nothing to do this campus if the fashion must be agonized over for weeks.

I am from California, a slightly different culture, as dif- fcrent as most of the minority stu- dents come from, and yet I was not chosen Why not'7 Because I do not add to the Union Cnllege Community 7 Not necessarily, only because my int1 uence is not visible to those on the corm11 ittee If it was really importantto me to \'represent\ my culture I would have petitioned the committee l\m tired of hearing about minor- ity students waiting to have things handed to them on a platter If we truly want equality then we will go by a person's merits \.vhen judging them. A person sllOuld not he included in an event based on their race any m.ore then they should be excluded from an event based on their race. Sincerely, Jennifer Trotts Tune in ~o WRUC Sunday Night's From llpm-lam For Live Phish Concerts From Various Venues pus, one is not allowed to donate student activities funds on this campus to a charity (regardless of how good a cause we both agree Make A Wish Foundation is) Thus, the committee was faced with 2 kinds of contributions. The first kind was discretionary funds. These funds could be used to put on the actual show or to donate directly to the foundation They included generous contributions from parents, alumni, Fratemities, Sororities, money raised from the star fund-raiser, anonymous con- tributions (of which there were several) and of course admission at the door. These funds went di- rectly to the Make A Wish Foun- dation. The second type of funds solicited were what i term as \fixed\ funds. These funds by law had to be used for the actual show itself and included the gen- erous contributions of Clubs, Committees, Student Activities, President Hull, and The Dean's Office. You may or may not know that Union College is a non- profit organization, thus nonprofit organizations cannot give money to other nonprofit organizations. If it were up to me (which it is not), I would love to have given some or all of these funds directly to the charity, but those are the rules and they were not nego- tiable. Mr. Cohen goes on to make another off the wall com- ment that \if we had a big walk- a-thon for Make A Wish and do- nated all the money spent on put- ting the fashion show together and the money raised, we could have given them $15,000\ I'm all for a walk-a-thon, but hon- estly, how many people would ha,·e showed up for a walk-a-thon on a Friday night? and do you really think we would have raised $1 5,000') Do you have any con- cept how hard it is to raise that tnuch moncy 0 Trust me, it's hard I I guess what ticked me off the tnost is people like you who com- plnin about every good thing on cam pus, yet make no effort to do something better. I for one never received a call from you usking i fyou could help. Don't you think that would have been more con- structive than writing a column telling everyone how much ev- erything sucks, and how if \you -.Nere in charge, things would have been much better.\ My advice to you: go out and do something in- steadofjust talking about it. Moving on, I would I ike to ad- dress Mr. Richman's (Jared) ar- ticle entitled \The Way of Style and Charity\ Mr. Richman's ar- ticle is a combination of skepti- cism and praise. Mr. Richman again questions the finances of the event and just like Mr. Cohen, ne\er contacted any of the mem- bers of the committee for the facts. He does strike a good point I.Nhen he says that\ charity should be done for the sake of cl1arity, not praise.\ Good point Jared, hut I think you offended every mem- ber of the committee when you said that you were sickened by the \self congratulatory remarks of several of the show's organizers.\ That never happened, Mr. Richman I Again, please try to see tJ1e big picture. Sure I was happy tlmt the event went wei I and raised a lot of money tor a good cause, but never once were we in for the \fame.\ You ought to know that there is no nunc in stu- dent activities This is college after all! Again though, Mr Richman saw something which the other four individuals writing articles never saw, that is the sur- prise guest appearance of Ms. Marra. For those of you who do not know Ms. Marra, she has given a good portion of her life helping the student body here at Union. Her 35 years of service was mentioned only once in last week's edition when Mr. Richman said that the \surprise addition of Ms. Marra to the cast of models made the show that much more special\ Good call Jared, you and I hoth know how nice Ms Marra is to every per- son who has the pleasure of meet- ing her. I only wish others had picked up on that I could go 011 regarding a thou- sand other issues which I feel should be addressed, but I'll stop here. I would like to close with a thank you to all those who helped in making this one of the best events this c()l!ege has ever seen. While I have thanked the count- less organizations and individu- als who helped out to make this event successfLil, I would also like to personally thank the models who donated countless hours practicing to make the show what it was. You see Mr. Cohen, this event wasn't about glorification or clothing, it was about raising money for sick children and pro- viding a social alternative which most of the campus could take part in That's the big picture which I feel you lost sight of Thanks again to everybody who took the time to make a ditTer- cnce.

EDITORIAL Opinions Draw Heat: Is That a Fact?! N()rrnally, the editor of a cellege newspaper would hope that read.,. rs look at the positive aspects of the newspaj:ier instead of revel in he;pilnted attacks. Well, last week was the week when the center of he .paper was full of color Fashion Show ofSupport pictures and also .hen the Opinions section came under it1tense scrutiny. VIe will be the first to admit that last week's opinions held some · harp errors. The letters sent by the twom,inority groups were fine, as hey concisely posed their grievances. Conor McKenzie' sarticle about • a<:llel Graha1n was a1so factual and thought-provoking. However?· astweek, s editorial box stated that Manny Cunanan, the President of he &tudent Forum, and other leaders of our scheol are apathetic, as hey did n()t attend the Alumni Council meeting held on April 12th. ell, some checking ofthe facts would nave shown that Manny was ot quite in a position to attend (he happened to be in another conti- · ent, in fact). Our apologies to Manny and to any other leaders who ere wrongly accused in the editoriaL Ar1o1:her opinion by an unnamed writer drew two confrontations on hursday. His opinion lacked a n4mber of facts about the fashion· how that, had he done only a slight bit ofsearching, he could have asily found. A second opinim1, which was much shorter and a little es:s pointed, about the fashion show also drew its share.of criticism. VIe at The Concordiensis worry that writers think that once they rite: an opinion piece, they can disassociate themselves from their riti11g. They become shocked when intense anger gets tossed in · heir direction. Well, it is nothing short ofhypocritical to be upset by tilers venting their opinions about your opinions. \Ne are not advocating confrontation as a weapon against \antago~ is:tic\ opinions. However, verbal confrontations are no more an- agonistic than the original irregularities in opinion pieces. A few i11L1tes of fact-checking can do two important things--help people ocus on your opinion's main points and give \the other side\ very ittle to legitimately holler about. Yes, opinion pieces are called opinions because they take a stance, ut they need some type of factual basis in order to stand on their own nerit. Otherwise, they are nothing more than violent antagonisms. onor's atticle drew only a slight amount of griping (some level is nav()idable) because he backed up his stance with RacheJ's story. e spent time and gathered information, and his column can still be escribed as an \opinion.\ Facts are the biggest weapons intenectu- ls !lave, and for that reason printed opinions should not lack any vail-able facts. Please keep writing your opinions, as we loveto see different points hiew, but realize that this section does not exist in its purest fonn . oru11supported attacks .. Also realize that what you write will be at- ached to you by readers, whether y,ou Hke .it or not. As Professor f()W!l taught many of us, never put anything in writing thatyou do otwant t() appear on the cover of The New York Times. Once that aiJj)ens, people will start to think seriously about your view and ap- reciate the otller features we roviqe in TheConcordiensis.

THAT'LL BE' $·2000~ ~l ... VLA Needs a Closer Look Editorial Staff The recent events Which have transpired concerniFJg the Visual Landscape Artists (VLA) have drawn attention ·to numerous ·questions, not the least of which is the question of whetherthe club deserves $2,000 with seven weeks left in th_e academic year. Tl:Je eoncordiensis applauds the stud~nts' efforts to support and nurture the arts at Union, however it became apparent after the Student Forum meeting last Thursday that descrepancies involving VLA's membership, budget proposal, a11d future exist. Why does a group of mostly seniors want to purchase equipment which the school already owns, especially when the money comes aut of the student body's pockets? The VLA claims that their projects are non- academic andgeared toward non- specific student involvement, yet three of its most vocal members seem to have the most at stake if this club fails to succeed immediateTy. . Why did the VLA submit a roster with several members unaware of their affiliation with the club? Why did VLA Director Michael Ferguson claim to have contacted metnbets of the Visual Arts faculty when no such contact was made? These are a few of the many questions The Concordiensis woLrld like to see answered before VLA llas the chance to utilize student ftli1ds. It remains unclear · wllatthe actual intentionsofthe cl1..ib's leaders are. Tile leaders, Ferguson and Rawson Thurber, daim that the aim of the organization is to \prornote the visual arts ('painting, sculpture, pho-to,graphy, and film') at Uni()n.;' Why, then, did their b1.1dget proposal include nothing but $4,700 of video supplies? It appears awfully convenient that the stu·dent leaders ar~ each in V()l ved iti academic in-dependent studies involving . creative visual projects. TEJ the true members of VLA, we feel for you. We understand that you have a desire to get exj}osure for your excellent W()r:ks. However, we also realize that you have been convincea by so1ne highly persuasive gentlemen that you belong to a clttb which can help your cause. lrt order to rally suppoit for th-eir cause, VLA leaders left out key infonnation not only from the Student Forum, but also from their own membership. We understand that printing such an a!\llcle can damage a club's futLire, but we have shown, we feel beycmd a reasonable doubt, that tile leaders manipulated the systein to obtain student funds for personal interests. We urge the Student .Forum to freeze 90\ percent of VLA's new funds until a full investigation of these eventsand rei ated issues can be carried out. By leaving the 10 percenroftbeir funds, perhaps the VLA will take the initiative to. fulfill the less expensive portions of their rn ission statement (art shows, etc.) and prove that their intentions to promote all visual arts at UTlion College are sincere and welldirected. To do out part in promoting the visual arts and helping aH Union students: interested in extracurricular creative expression, The Concordiensis will begin a two-page feature each month highlighting the visual arts at Union CoHege. At the beginnill;g .of the term, Conor McKenzie suggested that we:: start this feature, and now, we are in a position to offer it. It is distressing that certain students belfeve that they can freely manipulate the school's policies to achieve their own selfish ends under the veil of benevolent campus service. A dangermts precedent has been set in appropriating fund~ to a new club so late in the fiscal. yea-r, and we beseech the Student Forum to reconsider their decision for the time being. If this club is legitimate, then September funding is not that far away.

Who did the chairperson mean when .she referred me to the Higher Authority? God? Immediately after I had leftthe so-called ''Higher Authority'\s o-ffice, I ran into our beloved Ori- entation chairperson. We made a time to meet the next day at 12: 15 PM in front ofthe library., where I would attempt to submit my applicatioil and appeal. At ten after 12,1 arrived at our assigned 1neeting place a11d proceeded to wait .. and wait ... and wait for the chairperson. Needless to say, I was stood up. Was the chairper- son unable to 1nake our mutual deadline? At this time I realized that this was a hopeless situation and n'tade the decision to not fol- low up on the appeal by handing in my application. When I ran into tl1e Little Napoleon in the College Center (pardon me, Reamer Center} a halfhour later, she g9ve me some excuse for not showing. Was her excuse valid? I don't think so, but sometimes ci.rctnllstances do~ arise when we must make special exceptions. Currently, the school has no fonnal policy on dealing with stu- dents with extensive illnesses. htstead, to try to accommodate every possible student case, the school.confronts each situation as it arises. Therefore, because the Orientation chairpersot:t and her 'committee are school associated, they have the responsibility to abide by this u11written policy. In my case, my professors were in- formed of my illness (which was confirmed by Silliman on Wednesday, prior to theaeadline) and made the dec is ion to give me extensions on my academic work. Therefore Ms Chairperson and her Committee, your reason con- cerning \If! could hand a paper in ... \ is not valid. The reason why I decided against seeking an appeal for something that I loved as much as Orientation distresses me greatly. The main reason being that I was personally disgusted by the attitude that I received from theOrientation chair and the man- ner in which my situation was handled. In no way should the chairperson have exhibited a dis- position of complete authority. I find it appalling that one person could show such a display of ego- ism. Can you say \power trip\? It amazes me how this school can give so much power to one per- son. I would think that Union wouldn't believe in dictatorships. Who knew? Honestly, I felt the need to write this article on the pure basis that the Orientation chair, the commit- tee, and the Union College cam- pus community truly understand how completelyd issatisfied I am with the Orientation Committee's policy dealing with the deadline of the O.A. application and people who have extensive cir- cumstances. Therefore, I hope that in the future this type of situ- ation can and will be avoided. So Dear Orientation Chairper- son and Committee, please use my case as the model, and never allow this sort of ordeal to arise again. I truly hepe that as a com- mittee you-take this to heart and realize that something needs to be done. Simply writing down spe- cific excuses for why an O.A. application can be handed in late would save a lot of time and heart- ache for both the individual ap- plying for the position as well as for the committees. So please take my advice with all sihcerity. On a final note: Dear Orientation Chairperson, \Please don't let this effect our friendship.\ E-MAIL ADDRESSES FOR SUBMISSIONS at E-Mail us @gar. union. edu.

Wesley Snipes Solves White-House Murder ' ' ' ''Murder at 1600. '' Starring Wesley Snipes, Diane Lane, Den-: nis Miller. Alan Aida, Daniel BeJIZani. Ronny Cox. Directed by Dwight Little. Rated R, W ctrner Bros. Pictures., Rating: *** (out of four) With all ofthe problems faced by presidential administnitions, one would think that the murder of a 25-year-old, blond, White House secretary out for sex (re- ferred to by the film's characters as a '\little baby\) to be rather trivial. In Murder at J600(for- merly titled Executive Privileg?- its name was changed probably after Warner Bros. had a hit last year with Executive D_ecision), cop Snipes must discover why this seemingly insignificantmur- der is being so~ vastly covered up. On the night of the murder, the President(Cox)andhis family are at Can~p David, but forsotfie rea- son, Snipes is not getting coop- eration from the White House se- curity chief(Benzani of ABt·'s Murder One, doing a competent Marlon Brand4.l impersonation). and tbe Natiqnal Security Advi- sor (Aida, last seen wooing Goldie Hawn with song and . dance in Woody Allen's Every- one Says/ Love You).

Miller, as Snipes' partner, spends more time .off-screen than on and has the film's only cynical lines. His appearance here is somewhat puzzling. What's a cmnic doing here? (He had a similar appearance in The Net.) A Ida delightfully has a change of character toward the climax, as does Benzani, whose n:tenacing figure seems to have beeB down-played from the original version. Previews sug- gested that this character was more of a menace to Snipes, with footage of conversations includ- ing the classic line, \You were born to become a chalk outline,\ which were dropped in the final cut. Ultimately, films that leave out juicy moments are prone to suspicion (Were there production problems?), but the story unrav- els smoothly and includes a few twists aiid turns, which keep it from becoming all-too-routine. Little's direction is nothing epic or pretentious, keeping every- thing contained in a neat and tidy package that, because it is two steps beyond the network televi- sion crime-saga-of-the-week, comes off as the entertaining and sometimes chilly examination.of subjects Americans love to look· at--government conspiracies, covered-up crimes, and the dark side of government.

Trying Times For Union Softball Team Team Looks to Rebound From Tlzree-Ga.me Losing Streak by Carrie Heroth Contributing Writer What could have been a chance to capitalize on their 4-4 record fell short for the Union softball team last week. With a little help from our friend, the weather, the women were only able to com- plete four of the six games that they were scheduled to play. The week started out on a positive note as the Dutchwomen took on Oneonta State on Monday after- noon. Union was able to make a comeback in the first game to defeat the Red Dragons with a score of 12- I 0 Things did not go as well in the second g:1me. though. as Union fell I 0-3. Union's losing contin- ued as they faced the College of St. Rose on Thursday Unionjust couldn't seem to find the spark that they needed to push them hy St. Rose. They went on to lose two disappointing matches with scores of4-2 and 8-6 lay down and die. Oneonta, who is ranked as one of the top five in the state, scored five in the first and two in the sec- ond to take a quick 7-0 lead. Then Union stepped to the plate in the second to start off a six-run in- ning. Taryn Sarno! drove in a two-run double to start off the inning. Amy Nyren followed with a two-run single, and fresh- man outfielder Mindy Cohen added a RBI single to the attack The Dutch women trailed 7-6 go- ing into the bottom ofthe fourth. Nyrcn broke the game open as she nailed a three-run triple and then went on to score by a Carrie Heroth sacrifice tly. Union took the lead and never looked back as they went on to win 12-10. Shannon Lawlor added a triple in the sixth and scored off a RBI ground-out by freshman Sarah Cardullo to seal the victory The second game looked like it would be a close one. with a score of 1-1 going into the bot- tom of the tifth Union tied the game at one when Heroth walked and crossed the plate on a Nyren sacrifice fly. hut Union just couldn't hold it together as the The first Oneonta game once again saw the Dutchwomcn dig- ging them sci ves into a deep hole llowcver. exhibiting what seems to be a developing trademark for this team, the women refused to continued on page 19 First basemen Carrie Herotlt stretches for a til row ill the first inni11g of play (pltoto Laurie Kirscl111er I TC) Women's Lax Preps For Local Rivals Overtime Losses Wear on Team's Emotions by Geoff Sullivan Sports Editor This past week was anything but kind to the Union College women's lacrosse team. While the team was able to continue its potent otTense with a two-game total of 3 7 goals. the amount of goals they scored was not enough, and the Dutchwomen suffered· back-to-hack overtime losses both to Springfield, 15-14, and to Hamilton, 22-19 \This was definitely a tough week for us emotionally,\ said Coach Marty Morrison. \'Against Springfield, we played a great game. The intensity was there and the players played their hearts out Unfortunately. we came up on the short end of the stick.\ Coach Morrison felt that the ejection of Sarah Moss was a key aspect in their loss to Springfield. A iter receiving a questionable yellow card in the first halL Moss received a second during a vital stretch ofthe second half While coach Morrison praised the et: forts of Moss' replacement, fresh- man Kate Hayes. she felt that the team suffered a let-down and had trouble getting the ball out of the defensive end without Moss. Two players that have contin- ued to impress coach Morrison are a pair of freshmen. Veronica Sack has cons is tent! y he! d oppos- ing players to two or less goals per game at the point position, and Sam Ryall has demonstrated the ability to be an offensive threat at a defensive spot After their tough loss against Springfield, the Dutchwomen took on Hamilton this past Sun- day Again, overtime was not kind. and they were unable to put points on the board in the extra period. They suffered their sec- ond consecutive loss, 22-19. Junior tri-captain Lauren Pas- tor tallied eight goals in the loss, while freshman Abby Harris added four of her own, including the game-tying goal in regulation. Morrison was pleased with the team's effort but felt they were still affected by the Springfield loss. '\I felt we needed to be more consistent with our passing game We seemed emotionally drained from the previous game, illus- trated by our weak passes.\ Sophomore Alyssa Valove agreed. \Our passing game didn't seem to be on, and we didn't think Hamilton would come out that strong.\ At3-7, the Dutchwomen have two remaining games on the schedule, with the slim hope of a post season. They host RPI on Friday and Skidmore on Satur- dny. With their young players gaining valuable minutes and ex- perience, the Dutchwomen hope to fin ish strong, to give their fans a glimpse of the future. Men's Tennis Falters Ov~r Weekend, Team Loses Badly In Tournament by Peter Simon Sports Writer Tl1e confidence level of the men's tennis team severely shifted from last week's trium- phant win over RPI to this weekend's UCAA Singles Championship. After·defeating RPI by a score of7-2, the team traveled to Qeneva in search of more victories. However, the end result was unexpectedly tragic. None ofUnion's top seeds made it to the finals. lntheFirst Singles Champion- ship, top seed (seeded #2 in tour- ney) Jordan Pinsker faced Hobart's top seed Jay Flower. Pinsker breezed through to the semifinals with a &- 3 pro set win. With two matcl;)es remaining in Pinsker's pursuit of the golden trophy, he boggled the second match and lost to Hamilton's Hobson 3-6 0-6, thus bringing an end to his hopes and dreams of one day returning to Union with the grand prize. The Second Singles Champi- onship placed Union's Jared Sheikh against Ryan Fly of Clark. Sheikh destroyed Fly by a scme of 8- 1. It seemed that mo- mentum alone would push Sheikh straight into the fin;1ls Unfortunately, circumstances changed as Ross Malley of St Lawrence defeated Sheikh l -6, 2-6. For Sheikh, a freshman, this tournament will provide him with good experience for future tournament matches. The greatest upset of the week- end occurred in the first round of the Third Singles Champion- ship. Ranked number two in his bracket, Sam Berger opened his day against Robert Kazek ofRPL This was a Union-RPI rematch, so to speak, but the outcome would not be in Union's favor. In what was considered one o the closer first- round matches o the afternoon, Berger was con- quered 8-5 in what many called a \battle of the serve.\ Berger· had this to say: \We were pretty disappointed with our perfor- mance, but we played some tough competition and it pre- pared us for Oneonta and Skidmore, who are pretty tough as welL\ Union, after finishing the UCAA Men's Singles Tourna- ment in fifth place and with seven matches remaining, looks to rebound back in the second half of the season. The Dutch- men hope to turn themselves around this week, as they rub el- bows with teams outside of their conference. The next three matches against Oneonta, St Rose, and Vassar will be the de- ciding factor as to whether or not Union will remain a serious com- petitor outside the UCAA. The Union community wishes the Men's Tennis Team the best o luck.

The leading scorer for the Dutchwomen's lacrosse team, the Weston, Massachusetts native, is making a name for herself while helping to keep Union in the thick of the Upstate Collegiate Athletic. Association race. Union lost back-to-back over- time dec1sions to· non-league powerhouse Springfield ( 15-14) and UCAA rival Hamilton (22~ 19) last week despite Pastor's in- dividual efforts. She found the back oft:he net four times against Springfield (a team Union has never beaten) and scored a sea- son-high eight goals against Hamilton. Union is 3-6 overall and 2-2 in the circuit with three games left Pastor's 35 goals this season leaves her three .short of the 38 she tallied last year. She has a good opportunity to pass Molly Pearsal-l's 1995 single-season record of 47. Pastor, who has al- ready scored 97 goals during her three .. year career; is already sec- ond on Union's all-time goal- scoring list behind Holly Howard's (Class of 1983) four- year total of 147. \Lauren is a com- bination player,\ said · head coach Martha Morrisor-1. \She has the skill level to take the baH into the de- fense without losing it.\ lronica,Jiy, when Pastor came to Union in the fall of 1994 she was a one-sport ath- lete and that sport was soccer. She let- tered in both sports during her first two years at Union before devoting all Gfherat- tention to lacrosse this year. A graduate of Dana Hall prep school in Weston, Pastor started playing lacrosse in her freshman year ofhigh school. A varsity ten- nis and soccer piayer in high school, it was her soccer coach that convinced her to go out for the lacrosse team. By her senior year Pa,stor was an aU-Aeague se- lectkm. \Soccer was always my main sport, I played it all my life,\ said Pastor, who made the high school varsity team as an eighth grader. \l met with the soccer coach be- fore I decided to attend .Union, but l never met with the lacmsse coach. \1\'k)re and more, I began to feel that lacrosse was my main sport, · she continued. \It's hard to play two sports in college, because the practice overlaps. I felt had to give one up.\ Her focus on lacrosse has made her the Union Dutchwomen' s lead- .ingscmerthe last two seasons after finish- lAg fourth {with 24 goals) in her fresh~ · man canl.paigrt. This success comes de- spite the fact that she has been the target of the opposition's double team the last . two seasons. \Lauren can carry the ball against a double team,\ said Coach Morrison of herstar. \Mostplay- ers on this level can't Plus, her shooting placement is excellent. She's a pure scorer.\ At1 anthropology m~jor, Pastor was looking for a college that would offer her an academic chal- lenge with the abili-ty to also en· joy athletics. Union fit her needs well. ''I wanted a small school that was within driving distance from home,\ she explained. ''l also wanted to .play Division Ill sports. I did riot want an intensive ath· letic program so thati could con- centrate onmyacademics.\ Next winter Pastor will be studying a term abroad in Barba- dos where she can apply her an- thropological backgroul'ld first- hand. A member of Delta Delta Delta sorority, Pastor currently balds the position ofhistonan and will be the house's member educator in the coming year. She enjoys the challenge ofsuccessfully bal- ancing her academlcs, her athlet- ics, and her sorority, Although Pastor is not certain about he.r post college plans, she is looking into the options of teaching or attending graduate school. Her love for young chiJ· dren has her considering a career as a kindergarten teacher. Fornow, howeyer, Pastor looks forward to a successful trimester at Union, both il'l her academics and in the remainder of the la- crosse season.

WoddCup '98 : ThispastSunday afternoon, the U.S.- and Mexico continued their _heated rivalry at Foxbom .Sta- dium in hopes of securing a spot inWotld,Cup-'98 in Franc~. 111ey played to a 2~2 draw. The Mexi- cans scoredfttst inthe.first minute of play in aquite blza,rre fashion. Kasey Keller, the goalie for the U.S., attempted to cleara pass, but it ricocheted off the head of Carlos Hermosillo's head into the empty net before a shocked Keller and the entire U.S. squad. The U.S. evened up the match late in the first half with a goal by Eddie Pope, after Eric Wynaldakept the ball alive in the Mexican defen- sive zone. The score was tied at l-1 athalf-time before a sold-out and raucous crowd afFoxboro. Once again, Mexico came out quickly and scored the first goal of the half in the 54th minute, courtesy of Luis Hernandez. Mexico tried to protect this lead by playing a very cautious and· defensiv~ style of s<Jccer. After sco.ring the go-aheadgpal for his team, Hernandez received a red card. Mex.lco had to play a man down for the rest of the game. TheUS. tied thega1neinthe 74th minute with a little luck from the Mexican National te~1n. They. scored on their ow11 goalie.

No team worse has ever finished higher than sixth place in their division. Here are some staggering statis- tics: in their 14 losses, tfie Cubs led after a completed inning only six times; they had 23 errors to lead the majors; and they had a .178 team batting average, baseball's lowest. Believe it or not, the Cubs were not supposed tobe this bad.

Veronica Sack has consistently held oppos- itlg players to two or less goals per game at the point position, and Sam Ryall has demonstrated the ability to be an offensive threat at a defensive spot. After their tough Joss against Springfield; the Dutchwol'nen took on Hamilton this past Sun- day. Again, overtime was not kind, and they were unable to put points on the board in the extra period. They suffered their sec- ond consecutive loss, 22-19. Junior tri~captain Lauren Pas- tor tallied eight goals in th~ loss .. while freshman Abby Harris added four of her own, including the game-tying goal in regulation. Morrison was pleased With the team ;s effort l;>ut felt they were &till .affected by the Springfield los~ \I felt we needed to be ntore consistent with our passing game. We seemed emotionally drained ·from the previous game, ill us- e trated by our weak passes.\ Sophomore A lyssa Valove agreed. \Our passing game didn't seem to be on,.and we didn't think Hamilton would come out that strong.\ At 3-7, the Dutchwomen have two re.maining games on the schedule, with the slim hope of a post season. They host RPI on Friday and Skidmore on Satur- day.

Men •·s Tennis Falters .. Over Weeken·d, Team Loses Badly In Tqurn.ament ·-by Peter Simon Sports Writer The cont1dence level of the men's tennis team severely shifted from last week's trium- phant win over RPI to this weekend's UCAA Si11gles Championship. After.defeating RPI by a score of 7-2, the team 'traveled to Qeneva in search of . more victorie~.: flowever,the end . result was unexpectedly tragic. Noneof.Union'stopse~dsmade .it to the finals. In the FirstSingles Champion- ship, top seed (seeded #2 in tour- ney) Jordan Pinsker faced Hobart'~ top seed Jay Flower. . Pinsker breezed through to the semifi.nals with a 8-3 pro set wif!. With two matches remaining in Pinsker's pursuit ofthe golden tro.phy, he boggled the second matchl and lost to Hamilton's . Hobson. 3-6 0-6;,thus bringing an end to his hopes and dreams of .one day returning to Union with the grand prize. The Seeon.d .singles Champi-- onship placed Union's Jared Sheikh again-st Ryan Fly of Clark. Sheikh destroyed Fly by a score of8-l. It seemed that mo- mentum alone would push Sheikh straight into the finals. Unfortunately, circumstances changed as Ross Molley of St. Lawrence defeate~ Sheikh 1-6, 2-6. For Sheikh, a freshman, this , tournameilt will provide him with good experience for future tournament matches. The greatest tlpset of the week- end occurred in the first round of the Third Singles Champion- ship. Ranked number two in his· bracket, Sam Berger opened his day against Robert Ka2ek ofRPL This \Yas a Union-RPI rematch, so to speak, but the outcome would\hot be in Union's favor. In what was considered one o the closer first- round matches o the afternoon, Berger was con- quered 8-5 in what many called a \battle of the serve.\ Berger· had this to say: \We were pretty disappointed with ou.{perfor- mance, but vve played some tough competition and it pre- pared us for Oneonta and Skidmore, who are pretty tough . as well.\ Union, after fin ishit_1g the UCAA Men's Singles Toi.lrna- ment in. fifth place _and with· seven matches remaining, looks to rebound back in the. second half of ~he season. The Dutch- men hope to turn themselves around this week, as they rub el- bows with teams outside of their conference. The n·ext three matches against Oneonta, St .. Rose, and Vassar will be the de- ciding factor as towhetherornot Union will remain a serious com- petitor outside the 1.JCAA. The . Union community wishes the Men's Tennis Tearrf the best o luck.
