These. are just Jlfeliminary figmes. Union applications postmarked deadline is Febmary 1, and final figures will be announced in mid- February. Diane Crozier, senior assistant Dean of Admissions, said that this is a remarkable achievement considering the shrinking number cf students who are applying to college. The admissions ()ffice has found that this year, many small liberal-arts colleges around the nation are seeing a decline in the number of applications they received. Crozier says \Union appears to be going against the trend. Last year applications were up 6% and this trend is continuing this year.\ Applications are up 12.7% for the liberal arts, 13.5% for engineering and an impressive 17% gain in the :number of women applying to Union overall. Applications to the seven-year Medical program are up 11.2%, but applications to the six-year law program are down 5%. Crozier said that there are many factors, known and unknown, that can be attributed to this increase in applications. Demographics is a major factor. Although the number of students applying to college is declining, students are filing more applications. One decade ago, college-bound high school seniors applie<l to an average of four schools. Today that number is somewhere between six to eight schools. Crozier says that because of declining enrollment, colleges are accepting more students in an effort to get their classes filled. In effect, students have a better chance at getting accepted to colleges which are considered their \long shots.\ Therefore, students are filing more applications to top schools in an effort to improve their chances of getting accepted at their frrst choices. In the past two years, Union An impressive 17% gain in the number of women applying Union to has made its interview optional. Hank Malin, an ex- admissions director who recently left Union, found Lhat this new policy has attracted more applications from students who are from the top ten percent of their graduating class. Crozier believes that top high school students in the past may have been unwilling to take time off from their competitive advanced placement or honors classes in order to interview on campus at Union. Consequently, the number of alumni interviews has risen drarnatically. Union has always been well known for its distinguished alumni which maintains close ties to the college. Over the past six years, Union's admissions department has been steadily increasing its focus on its alumni network. Carrie Mendez, assistant admissions coordinator, says \Alumni are playing a much more active role in reaching out to the student community.\ Union has eight regional alumni networks which include Boston, Chicago and even Ohio. Union has recently become more active in training its regional alumni in the \how to's\ of approaching prospective Union students. The admissions office provides a list of students who arc int€'rcstcd in Union to alumni located in v:.uiuus r~gion:- ol the country. Mendez says that prospective Union students arc often impressed to talk to a Union alumni, who may be a prominent businessman or physician in their community, and ask any questions he or she Continued on page 3 Civil. Rights Lawyer Morris Dees To Speak At Union College Courtesy of Union College Public Relations Morris S. Dees Jr., a civil rights lawyer and executive director of the Southern Poverty Law Center in Montgomery, Ala., will speak on \A Season for Justice\ at 8 p.m. on Wednesday, Feb. 12, in Memorial Chapel at Union College for the College's Portraying America series. Over the past 25 years, Dees has been involved in more than 50 federal civil rights cases, including integration of the Alabama State Troopers and single-member districting of the Alabama Legislature. Dees and the Southern Poverty Law Center have especially received national attention for two successful multimillion-dollar lawsuits: against the Ku Klux Klan for $7 million and against Tom Metzger and the White Aryan Resistance for $12.5 million. Dees became co-founder and director of the center in 1971 after seven years of private law practice in Montgomery. As a white Southerner, Dees was attending the University of Alabama School of Commerce and Business in 1956 when he watched a screaming white mob throw eggs and rocks at Autherine Lucy as she attempted to attend the university under court-ordered integration. \It was the first mob scene I had ever encountered,\ he said in a 1990 U.S. Catholic interview. \il got sick to my stomach, and all the instincts I ever had for the underdog came out.\ Dees received a bachelor's degree in 1958 from the university and in 1960 graduated from its law school. He has gotten national news coverage for his civil rights work, including interviews by People magazine and ABC News with Peter Jennings. His awards include the Young Lawyers Distinguished Service Award from the American Bar Association, the Trial Lawyer MorrisS.

City Councilman Visits Campus by Jim Polites News Editor City Councilman David Nowak visited Professor Tidmarch's \Urban Politics\ class on Friday, January 31 as he spoke to students about Schenectady and his influential role in its decision-making process. Before entering public office, Mr. Nowak worked for a radio station-specifically in the marketing/advertising field of the business. Realizing his ambition was to run a political campaign, Mr. Nowak started on the county level and was elected a committeeman. After leading the charge for a number of city council candidates, he himself was nominated to the Democrat's ballot and now has a council tenure that spans nine years and three elections. Mr. Nowak's discussion focused on the current plight of Schenectady-its social and economic woes, along with its failure to attract new business. To maximize resources, he suggested, Schenectady County -as the third smallest in New York State-\should con- solidate everything: police service, fire department. Our communities create \their own little fiefdoms and with it a duplication of services.\ On the subject of General electric-the city's chief source of employment and revenue- Mr. Nowak described an interesting paradox. Besides providing jobs, G .E. has :hampioned management programs, the Arts, United Way, and the Red Cross. He adds, though, that \its size has been a deterrent in attracting business-and something the city really has no say over.\ He was quick to point out that while ·the city is getting into more service-oriented business, Schenectady stiU has a great number of resources to offer--and paramount among these is the people themselves. When asked whether or not public officials could do something about Schenectady's seemingly defeatist, negative attitude, Mr. Nowak was quick to respond that it is a mindset that has evolved over several years. He claimed, \It began when the parents of today's parents started feeling depressed over increases in education, mortgages.\ He also cited the fact that even the city newspaper, The Daily Gazette, was caught up in the negativity-always highlighti- ng the 'doom and gloom' aspects of the economy. Mr. Nowak concluded by talking about the trials of public office-for those specifically considering it as a career. He stressed the lack of 1 private life and cooperation needed-despite party lines-to succeed. \You're in a tenuous . posit.ion,\ l1e said. \You're never really right, never really wrong and you must come to the realization that you're never going to satisfy half the people.\ CONGORDIENSIS • FEBRUARY 6, 1992 • PAGE 2 \Union Institutes New Restrictive Term Abroad Policy - IJy Lisa Hofbauer Concordiensis Staff member, \if you're interested in the environment or something, you probably wouldn't have a hard time getting into [an] A term abroad can be an Australia [program] ... but tile enric:hing and wonderful average person has to show e~penence.

CONCORDIENSIS FEBRUARY 6, 1992 PAGE; 4 The Right Side of Things by Jim Polites News Editor While the upcoming Democratic Presidential primary on February 18 has garnered a great majority of news and media attention - a genuine, though much quieter, battle is brewing on the Republican side of things. The Democratic candidates: Brown, Tsongas, Clintan., Harkin, and Kerry all perceive themselves as legitimate contenders, men who can wrestle away George Bush's grip on the White House. The group has its platform: with the Gulf War just a fading memory of u_s. global strength and influence, our worsening economy has thrust to the forefront of domestic policy. Coincidentally, the Republican challengers -- Patrick Buchanan and David Duke -- have seized the opportunity as well, highlighting the President's inability to satisfy his own party, not t() mention the nation at large. A former White House speechwriter, Mr. Buchanan has presented tlle image of the consummate conservative -- one who prides himself on the accomplishme11ts of Ronald Reagan and our stoic resolve in the Cold War of the 1980's. He indirectly represents the entire Republican Party's dismay towards President Bush's false premises. For while the Chief Executive continuaUy claimed solidarity, he clashed with many supporters on two controversial issues: reneging his no-new-tax pledge and signing to civil rights legislation. According to the New York Times, choosing between Bush and B uchanaiJ is a practice in finding the lesser of two evils. What many i11 the Republican Party hope for is that Buchanan exposes the President's current electoral weakness such that it entices someone else (like 40 ormer Education Secretary William J. Bennett) to enter the fray. Mr. Buchanan's personal p·latfor.m concentrates on isolationist domestic policy, especially now that the threat of superpower conflict has aU but dissolved. He suggests now that we here in the United States have an undeniable claim to global According to the New York Times, choosing between Bush and Buchanan is a practice in finding the lesser of two evils. supremacy, our focus should shift back to protecting interests at home. Buchanan is outspoken against the Japanese, and believes that we maintain a self-centered economic policy - just as they do. In a traditionally conservative state such as New Hampshire, Mr. Buchanan's message should attain recognition :and a subsequent following. A poll taken a few weeks back showed' Bush ahead of his nearest challenger by a margin of 46% to 30.%. This certainly isn't reasoa for Buchanan to celebrate, but the fact that he's within reach will keep the Chief Executive's re-election team looking over its collective siloulder. Then of C()urse there is Mr. David Duke, the infamous gubernatorial candidate from Louisiana wh:o gained national acclaim thanks to a KKK background and lightly veiled racist rhetoric. After losing that election, he set his lofty sights on the Presidency; a move that will ultimately damage our political system and his party more than anything else~ Despite relllouncing Duke as a Republican member in good standing, he has persisted in his desire to run on the GOP ticket. Mr. Duke's major claim is that his inspired run for governor makes people sit up and take notice -- solidifying the belief that he has a national, not simply regional, message to spread. Mr. Duke's relative success in Louisiana was horrify.ing enough, but to think his ideals are universal is ludicrous. If anything the results last November were a temp<n.ry aberration; they certainly weren't cause for galvanizing his racist tenets. Looking at the big picture, the Republicans have failed miserably in producing a ticket that gives the people a legitimate choice. Maybe tint's just the inner forces working to build the image of Presiclent Bush as New Hampshire rapidly approaches. Maybe this is the election year that the ~protest votes and moderates side with the Democratic candidate, not the incumbent. If quality of choice had anything to do with the Presidential vote - we could. all .see someone else living in the White House next January. Is Safety At Union An Issue? by Ken Perel Contributing Writer Defined, the Pro-Active approach to safety is simple. The more each individual can do to make themselves less o{ a victim, the safer they are from the community at large. Working together, the students, administration and staff could make it extremely difficalt, although not entirely impossible, for crime to exist at Union. Althot~gh Schenectady is ranked as the 33rd county in the crime indeJC, there were still 3,404 felony crimes in 1991. By taking the opportunity away from t:he potential criminal, the student body can better protect itself. The problem with door propping is a prim(( example of where Pro-Active security could greatly reduce the number of victimizations. Between 1/19/89 and 6/4/89, a special student task force working under the direction of the Security Department unpropped 660 doors in 3 19 workiug hours. These do not include the doors unpropped by the regular security officers. Each propped door is an invitation for a potential criminal to enter. Coupled with door propping, the instances wherein rooms are left unlocked again amplifies the potential fer criminal activity. All too often, anyone can gain acce;gs to an unlocked bedroom, especially late at night. A Pre- Active security system would have the students working wi1ll Security, and not against it, to create a safer environment. Unfortunately, under any system, no matter how well staffed or executed, some Part 2 In A Series of 3 crimes are unavoidable. Crime is a fact of life, and one that. must be painfully accepted. Unfortunately for both the victims of crime at Union, and the student body as a whole, when a crime is committed, The problem with door propping is a prime example of where Pro-Active security could greatly reduce the number of victimizations. too many people look to place blame, instead of working toward a solutio11. The most major safety issue of this academic year involved the attack by three non-students upon a Union freshman. Although highly publicized in the November 14 issue of the Concordiensis, many of the reported accusations against the Safety Department and the administration are unfounded, and unjustifiable. If the Concordiensis is indeed the only source of campus news that the students have access to, then it is imperative that this paper examine its accuracy, and make amends as needed As reported by Erica Frank in this issue, the victim stated \accidents (attacks and crimes of opportunity) happen and Schenectady seems like every city. I guess there's going to be crime everywhere.\ She also credited his major concerns not to the attack, but rather to the Dean's seeming ineffectual response to his plight.\ I do not understand this comment, and I believe s:he too has no understanding <>f it, for if she investigated the story more thoroughly, she would have learned some alarming facts, and thus been unable to place blame on the administration. Also involving the same incident, Jordan Lippner, in his article entitled The Union College B~reaucracy: A Necessary Cost of an Education (November 14, 1991), described Schenectady as \this war zone of a city.\ As shown before, comparatively speaking, Schenectady is a safe city, and not a war zone. He also created the phrase \bureaucratic droids\ because two security officers responded to a fire alarm situation. According to security's safety priority. they were responding accordingly, and do not deserve this type of unjustifiable, false and demeaning accusation. He immediately adds: Knowing this, it would not surprise me if a delinquent -· - purposely pu:.lled an alarm at one end of campus in order to commit a crbne at the other. Unfortunately, for both the victims of crime at Union, and the student body as a whole, when a crime is committtted, too many people look to place the blame instead or working toward a solution. Well, it totally surprises me. This would {)nly happen in the movies or criminal fantasy land. If we: are going to criticize Security and the administrati()n, we must at least use j11stifiable and true criticism, not those based on sensationalism and self- elevation. Mr. Lippne:r revisits fantasy land when he states: That th'e incident even .... - - - occurred, only the administration is to blame. The state of security on this campus. especially wllen considering the city in which Union is situated, is deplorable. To this absurd accusati()n, Paul Mantica only smiles :and responds, \anyone who Call sit there and say becal!se somebody got mugged, this is an unsafe campus is an unfair accusation ... I could have 100 people working on this cam]Jus at any given time and it wO'uld still happen. It's easy to cast stones at people witb()ut sitting in and seeing how the operations actually work.\ As news editor, I would hope that next time an incident of this nature unfortunately happens Mr. Lippner is m()re accurate in his accusations. and does not mislead the student body into doubting campus safety.

Union Exchange Student Fi Freedom and I. To the International Features Editor: I am not a student at the college, but I am writing to you because yoli might be interested in a \human interest story.\ It concerns a Soviet exchange student who attended Union College du1ing the school :year 1989-90. Actually, the student was from Lithuania. but at that time Lithuania was paJt of the Soviet Union. So. technically, he was a Soviet student. attacked the television station in Vilnius in force. One of those of thousands. who attempted to defend the television station was Audrius Bruzga. He wrote me a letter later and told me that the students of the university were there in the front lines,\ so to speak:. Audrius survived, but the memories of that terrible night left him and the other students in a state of shock. The classes at the university were suspended for a week afterward. Many of them had nightmares. They were not very pleasant memories. \Diplomatic Passport\ issued by the Government of Lithuania shows that he is the Second Secretary of the ministry df Foreign Affairs of ' the Republic of Lithuania. He wrote to me and told me that he was iriVited by the British Foreign Office to come to London for four days to learn about djplomacy. I was watching TV one evening, and to my SUI1prise, the newscast devoted one segment of its telecast about how young men from the fledgling young democracies from Eastern Europe were spending time to learn diplomacy in London, at the invitation of the British For Lithuanian Foreign Office. Please do not look at this with surprise. You must understand that the Balti:c S,tates were under the heel of the Soviets for 50 years. Now that over 60 countr,ies have recognized them as independent countries, they have ~o establish diplomatic embassies with them. So they need young men to learn the \trade so to speak. The Lithuania-American community in the United States is in the pmcess of making arrangements with the University of Hlinois (I believe) to take· ill some students from Lithuania to learn Ell,glish and other subjects. Now that tbe fight for independ(ln~e wa:s successful, the nex.t dlstacle will be to get the econ<>rny adj11sted to the \free ente!]Jdse\ system. That is where outside ~ssistance is desperately needed. Lithuania, right now,. is a poor nation with very ~it:tle hard currency. It would be nit;e if Union College could <lo something to help. Thank you very much for taking the' time 1() read my letter. With my very best wishes to you, and YO'lll!' staff, I am S inoeerely yours, Edward W. Jfa,.,anauskas I am enclosing a copy of an interview that your paper gave him, and it was pu~lished in the October 19, 1989 issue. His name was miss~lled, his first name actually. Audrius Bruzga is the correct spelling. Perh~ps you may have wondered what happened to him after he went b!lck to his native Lithuania, ami what he is doing today. Everyone felt that the Soviet troops would attempt to take the Parliament b1:1ilding by force, too. They erected every conceivable type of barricade to protect the huHding from attack. Audrius Bruzga was one of the students who stood watch inside the building, anned with a shotgun, and, as he told me in one of his letters, he was ready to fight to the death to preserve Lithuanian independence to the \last second.\ Their greatest fear was that. once Soviet armor penetrated the barricades, they would storm the inside of the parliament building to kill the President of Lithuania and its legislators. If that should come to pass, then Soviet troops would shed some of their own blood, too. Life In Lithuania I am an American of Lithuanian descent, and my wife was born in Lithuania. We we11e married in Vilnius, the capital of Lithuania, in 1981, and she arrived here in 1982. We met Aud'rius by chance,. and we \became very close friends while he attended Union College. We still correspond with each other. Profile of a Soviet Exchange Student Audrius returned to the University of Vilnius to resume his studies. I might add that he is a fierce Lithuanian patriot, as are all the students who go to the university. After Lithuania declared its independence from Moscow, President Gorbachev did all he could to discourage the Lithuanians from breaking away from the Soviet Union. First was the economic blockade in the spring of 1990, but that did not work. He then sided with tile hard- liners, aJJd felt that \f(}rce\ was the only cure tsat the Lithua11ians would understand. In the beginning of 1991, Soviet troops, complete with tanks and annored personnel carriers arrived in Litllllania in great numbers. On \Bloody Sunday,\ January 13, Soviet troops So, while the students at Union College take their freedoms and liberties so much for granted, one of the Union College exchange students was ready to fight and die for his, and his nation's, freedom and independence. I remember reading in one of the newspapers that the Russians who built those barricades around the Russian \White House\ during the coup attempt last August learned their lesson from the Lithuanians. What is Audrius Bruzga doing today? Because of his excellent education at Union, he was invited by the Lithuanian government to join the Foreign Office. His by Audrius Bruzga Contributing Writer I am delighted to find out that Soviets at Union are no longer a wonder. Last year the guys from Georgia and Armenia gave a good start in introducing the college community to the variety of languages, customs and cultures :that make up the Soviet Union. At the same time they seem to have put an end to tile stereotype of a \Russian.\ This year Yuri and I represent two other national minorities, namely Belorussians and Lithuanians. I know darn well that these notions make little sense to a person wh() is not completely - absorbed in p()litics. Therefore, today, I would like to skip the traditional topic of politics, which a Soviet is mostly expected to speak on (questions like, \What do you think of Gorbache.v?\ or \Will perestroika succeed?\ and the like). Inste!ld, I would prefer to introduce the readers of the Concordiensis to our cultural background: \Who we are?\ \Wllat we are?\ To be more specific, today I will PEACE CORPS ·WORLD WISE PuZZLE For further in{mmation about Peace Co1ps, write Box 896, Was!tington DC 20526 INSTRUCTIONS: •rhe Peace Corps has volunteers serving in more than 90 nation.s around the wodd.

If you happen to look at The Times Atlas of the World, you will hardly be impressed by the size of my country. Lithuania covers the territory of only 26,000 sq. miles; however, it is bigger than, say, Switzerland or West Virginia. You should look for Latvia, Belorussia and Poland and its western coast is washed by the Baltic Sea. TI1e population for the last decade has remained appro)(imately 3.5 million, 80% of wllich are Lithuanians. Recently, Lithuanian was proclaimed the state language. \Lithuania was a peaceful crop . growing nation.\ Now let us move from encyclopedic data to explore the rich history of Litl'mania. Lithuanian tribes settled down on the eastern coast of the Baltic Sea in prehistoric times. Yet the first written evidence of their civilization is of tile fifth century B.C. In his work Germania, P.C. Tacitus, a famous Roman historian described the Lithuanians as peaceful, laborious, a crop- growing nation.

''Amateur Athletes .. Olympic Politics Contrary to popular belief, the Ancient Greek athletes were not amateurs. Not only were they fully supported for almost a year prior to the Olympics, but even though a winner received only an olive wreath at the Games, back home he was amply rewarded and could become quite rich. The concept of amateurism actually developed in nineteenth-century England as a means of preventing the working C'lasses from competing against the aristocracy. The wealthy could take part in sports without worrying about ;having to make a living, and thus could pursue the ideal of amateurism. Everyone else had to give up training time in order to earn a living, or else take money for sports performances and become a professional, ineligible for competitions such as the Olympics. Baron de Coubertin although a member of the French aristocracy, was well aware of the inequities of the amateur system. His solution was to have wealthy people come forward as \patrons\ to support worthy working-class athletes. The qualifications for being an amateur have varied frotH decade to decade and from sport to sport. ln the 1920s British sportsmen accused the Americans of circum venting the rules of amateurism by the awarding of ath.letic scholarships to universities (although even the ancient Greek medical colleges recruited athletes). As late as the 1930s physical education teachers and recreation directors were considered professional athletes and thus ineligible for the Olympics. These restrictions seem archaic today, but don't be surprised a few decades from now if our present-day restrictions seem just as silly. I believe that the code of amateurism will eventually be discarded and that the Olympics will be declared open to all qualified athletes. If the constant bickering over the definition of amateurism doesn't bring about the change, then the absurd advantage given to Communist countries will. Because the Communist nations claim that they have no professional athletes, they are able to field the best possible teams in every sport. Thefe are only two places today where people from all parts of the world gather: the United Nations and the Olympics. The trouble with · the United Nations is that two- thirds of the governments represented are ruled by dictators, royal families, and single parties that permit no opposition. Consequently, the people who represent these countries at the United Nations, far from being typical citizens, are generally the worst the country has to offer. Even those nations that aspire to democracy are represented by a most unrepresentative group: wealthy men and women~ mostly men, who have gone to the right schools and know the right people. Unlike U.N. delegates, Olympic athletes represent an almost complete economic cross-section of the world's population. In this book you will meet carpenters, farmers, housewives, teachers, psychia- trists, accountants, nurses, secretaries, and cartoonists, as well as the usual hordes of students, soldiers, and state- supported athletes.

Even lawyers, businessmen, and royalty have taken part in the Olympics. This is not to say that the Olympics are any less political than the United Nations. However, c0ntrary to popular belief, the policization of the Olympics is not a recent phenomenon. From the very beginning the Olympics were exploited by the ruling classes of the nati()ns in which they were held. In 1896 and 1906 the Greek royal family was highly visiiJle at the Games, placing its box at the finish line and inserting itself into the festivities at the most exciting parts-the moment of victory and the awud ceremonies. The British royal family did the same thing in 1908. In 1912 awards were handed out not only by King Gustav of Sweden, b11t by Czar Nicholas of Russia as well. Staging the Olympics also helped the ruling classes by providing a distraction from serious political and economic problems. During the 1906 Intercalated Games in Athens, British and American tourists were shocked when a riot broke out in front of their hotel. Government troops attacked a political demonstration, killing three people and injuring 57. Meanwhile the Greek royal family was busy entertaining the Englisll royal family at Olympic-related functions, including the competitions themselves. Despite t.llis history, it is often stated that the \intrusion\ of politics into the Olympics began in a serious manner with the black-gloved, clenched-fist salutes of U.S. sprinters Tommie Smith and John Carlos in Mexico City in 1968. Smith and Carlos staged their Black Power protest while \The Star-Spangled Banner\ was being played during the medal ceremony for the 200- meter dash. They were immediately suspended by the I.O.C. and ordered to leave the Olympic Village by the U.S.O.C. Yet they were hardly the first to make politic~! gestures ·on the victory platform. D11ring the 1936 Berlin Games, all German winners and several foreigners as well raised their ril!:ht arms in the Nazi salute. Countless American athletes have placed their right hands over their hearts during the playing of their national anthem. Needless to say, none of these athletes was punished the way Smith and Carlos were. The questi()n then arises: If it was acceptable in 1936 to raise your right arm in the air with the open palm face down, and today it is acceptable to put your right hand over your heart, why was it not acceptable in 1968 to bow your head and raise your arm into the a~ir with your gloved fist closed? From ~he point of view of the I.O.C., the \crime\ committed by Smith and Carlos. was not that they had made a political statement, but that they had made the wrong political statement. Although Olympic athletes may be a representative group, I.O.C. memi}crs and other Olympic 1eade:rs are not. They arc, in fact, very much like U.N. delcg:ates. They have definite politi-eal beliefs. They support natiomlism, and they support the t:Uling elites of the various mttions of the world, no matter if th cy arc Communist or capitalist. Thus it was perfectly aU right in 1936 for German athlet-es to give the Nazi salute, bcca!Use that salute was approved by the German government. And it is quite within the rules for U.S. athlct~s to put their hands over their hearts because that is a patri()tic gesture which shows supp()rt for nationalism and the status quo. lL was not acceptable to the I.O.C. to have Smith and Carlos raise clenched fists becal.llsc their gesture rather than showing support for a recognized nation-state, showed suppmt for an unrecognized polit£cal entity - black Americans. The year 1968 was a highly politicized one. China was in the tilroes of the Cultural Revolution, Czechoslovakia's burst ()f freedom was crushed by .Soviet troops, the govenunent of France was almost overthrown by student- led demonstrations, and civil rights and antiwar demo11strations were spreading across the United States. Mexko was by no means immtLnc to such revolutionary activity. As the Olympics appro~ched, 300,000 Mexican students and teachers were on strike. Ten days before the Olyrn]pics were scheduled to begin, government troops openetd fire on several thousand unarmed students holding a rally ill the Plaza de las Tres Culturas. Hundreds of young people were killed. The I.O.C. refuse.d to take a stand on this, declaring that the incident was \an i11ternal affair\ which was \under control.\ Yet exactly two weeks later, when two black men made a silent, nonvi()Jent protest, the I.O.C. was liJ) in arms, condemning Smitll and Carlos for their shod:\ing, disrespectful behavior. The Olympics have always reflcc ted the politics of the world., from which they provide a temporary respite, and they always will.

GONCORDIENSIS • FEBRUARY 6, 1992 \ The \lmportant 11 Things in Life b;:v tietsy Rothstein C()ncordiensis Staff The other night some friends and I went to FRIDAY'S for dinner. We were ecstatic at the thought of a decent meal, but I do notthink we appreciated the full magnitude of how incredible this meal really was. We neticed that our waiter's name was Gino and proceeded to tackle the huge menu with whid1 he presented us. Granted that this menu is slightly overwhelming-only a few thousaad items to choose from, a sudden hush came over our table as we began to intensely read every square inch of the menu. Of course I skimmed everytlling briefly, (I do not have tile patience for these gigantic menus) and skipped over a few hundred options. I seriously considered the baked potato and salad medley, but luckily I came to my senses and decided on The Californian. Soon enough Gino was back to take our orders. I gave him mine, and my frie:nd gave him hers. Finally it was our friend \Penelope's\ tum and as Gino, my friend and I turned towards \Penelope\ to hear her order~ s~e clutched her head in horror. \I just cannot decide what I want!\ she shrieked as if it were the most agonizing decision of hr life. My friend and I were in hysterics laughing. You have to know \Penelope\ to appreciate how funny this scene was. Gino sort of gave us th.at half smile indicating one of three things. A) He thought \Penelope\ was a pshyco. :B) He was constipated. C) He was pondering over wetller we knew that he wore a dress in his off hours. Finally \Penelope\ calmed down, got contr(}l of herself, spun her head around a few times (like the girl in the Exorcist) and reached her back- breaking, perplexing decision. Believe it or not she decided on the Vegetable Bag11ette (sounds really good, right?) As she was struggling to reach her heart- wrenching decision, I thought of all those starving Ethiopian children that would probably give their right arms to be able to choose from a FRIDAY'S menu. I think it would take them about .6 seconds to reach their decisions except for the fact that they probably would not understand the menu. They would probably just make a mad rush for the kitchen. All kidding aside, it is amazing how much we take for granted and how we stress over mundane, everyday situations. While the Soviet Union is collapsing, and the ozone layer is depleting \Penelope\ cannot decide what to order for dinner. While it is a given fact that we are somewhat shielded from the real world here at Union College, it is about time that we set a few priorities for ourselves. Don't worry, no major ones, just minor ones such as not traumatizing over what to order for dinner. As we are agonizing over that ONE test or that ONE paper, people in other parts of the world are dying, or fighting for their lies. In ten years we will look back on that ONE test or ONE paper and we won't be able to believe how much we stressed. ONE test win not affect the grand scheme of our lives, unless of course in ten years if we .are living on the street and eating out of garbage cans we might look back on our lives and think \If only I had studied harder for that ONE test.\ I think back to my term abroad in Mexico where at times I felt sudden pangs of guilt when I was lying out in the sun (i.e. going to a school that was once a resort) and yet I knew that the United States was at war and that Americans were dying. Even though I did not feel personally responsible and continued to lie out in the sun, these thoughts did cross my mind. When you are isolated, on a sunny beach in Mexico, or in the dreary depths of Union College during Winter Term, you are not propelled to think about world or national problems because you are so far removed from them. This is not to say that we should suddenly stop what we are doing, drop our beers or our books and go to Ethiopia and feed the children; this is just not realistic. It is important though to be aware of what is going on in the world and to take a step back and appreciate everything we have. Who knows, soon the tables could be turned and it could be our sad, pathetic, sunken eyed faces plastered on the televisions in other countries, revealing our ribs chanting, FOR THE PRICE OF A CUP OF COFFEE .... So, as our lives and Gino's go on and we find ourselves in the midst of midterms, we should all be able to sleep a little easier as we think of those starvin.g children and maybe we will relax about that ONE test.

FIRESIDE PASTA DINNER! Prof. Greenburg: Israel Term Abroad KOSHER KITCHEN 6:00 pm, Thursday, Feb. 6 *Please Bring Meal Cards America is a wonderful place. Under the Constitution, all American citizens are equally protected and represented. The Constitution was designed to eliminate the persecutions against a large and diverse group of immigrants from Europe and elsewhere. Yes, it was written by White Males of European descent, but it has withstood the test of time. It was the only document of the time written by White Males that insured they could not treat the American public in a fashion similar to their European ruling counterparts. Due to a political com- promise, and not a sociological or biological belief, it also created a situation under which American Blacks were only 3/Sths a political person. This was remedied as the times demanded, It must also be noted that the slave trade between African and Arab nations existed at least 1,000 years before the Europeans entered the scene, and it was in fact American White Males who abolished the institution. It was also American White Males who pushed the Civil Rights Act of 1964 through Congress. The White Male also gave Women equality and the right to vote. The entire Woman's Movement was supported by the White Male. In some nations, woman do not have the right to vote; in some they may not even drive a car or show their face in public. In many African nations, woman, when they reach the age of puberty, have their clitoris removed, and their vaginal opening sewn shut, without anaesthetic, so they will not feel sexual pleasures. Thus, they become mere tools of reproduction, owned by their husbands. On the whole, the nation conceived and created two hundred years ago by the White, European Male offers anyone and everyone the right to voice their opinions. You can stand in public or private, and express any views. Lately, however, most of these views criticize and rebuke the very system that allows these groups (see frrst paragraph) the legal right to speak. Why is that? Do I, as a White Male, born in 1968 have to defend myself for being White, heterosexual, and Male? Do I have to sit in a classroom and be told that I am evil, and am responsible for racism, sexism, et al, because of my skin color and my geographical roots? Political Correcbless, spelled \reverse discrimination\ would have me believe this.

This is not a uniquely American situation, as the New York Times will illustrate any day of the week. On the other hand, modern, educated, and thankfully eqtJalized America has corrected all these mistakes. Currently, we are all equal, and all have the same opportunities for success. It is up to the individual to create his or her own future, and if this future is not attained, only these individuals are to blame. You are not convinced? Ask yourself these simple questions. Have you ever been the recipient of blatant, recordable and provable, discrimination? Have you worked and studied hard for what you have? When the going got tough, did you work even harder. and take advantage of the system around you instead of complaining? The White European Male may have created America and Western Civilization, but he did not limit participation in his new creation to himself. America is the melting pot of the world. Every where in the world, nations and people look to America as a role model for both what a nation should be, and how a nation should treat ~ts people. Only Americans fault the American system. Remember, we are all Americans, whether you like it or not. By separating ourselves, we are undoing the greatest Democratic achieve- ment of human history, total sexual and racial equality. Anyway, if you do not like America, and want it to be . different, maybe you're the problem and should expatriate yourself, and see how the unequal world suits your tastes; I guarantee you will be back.

PAGE.10 Ignorance And Destruction While Union College boasts of an extremely high acceptance rate of its students into medical scht>ol, it is unfortunate that the school cannot als.o brag about i1ts overall awareness and services for health-related issues. At a time when the percentages of Union females suffering from eatmg disorders places high above the national statistics, the school continues to ignore the problem. The severity of this situation and the extensiveness to which it is ignored are frightening for a school of this caliber. What is the school waiting for? After all, it has been almost one year since a student survey revealed that approximately one-fifth of the women on this campus .suffer from eitJter anorexia or bulimia and that laxatives and diuretics have become the college community's latest trend. In short, more needs to be done to combat this problem than the hosting of a once per month self-help group. Eating disorders are running rampant and nothing is being done to halt the paths TO destruction. After all, this is an educati()nal institution. EDUCATE! D'Souza: A Help or Hindrance To Multieulturalism To the Editor: Last Tuesday in the Bicentennial Lecture Series Dinesh D'Souza presented a thought-provoking talk on \The politics of race and sex on campus.\ He was very bright and articulate and in many ways persuasive in expressing his concerns about \multiculturalism.\ Although I agree wifh much of what he said, I must take~issue with some of his major points. No one can argue against his premise that an education should be broadly based and should emphasize the study of works chosen on their merit alone. Surely the works he mentioned would grace any reading list. Nor should anyone argue that students should be discouraged from presenting their ideas in class, no matter how much they clash with the politics of the professor, and that these ideas should be discussed objectively and openly. This is intellectual \apple pie.\ I do object to some of his other conclusions, however. The first example concerns affirmative action. He stated that affirmative action was discriminatory and therefore \unjust.\ Affirmative action is discriminatory. but that does not make it unjust. Whether it is just or unjust binges on the criteria used in that disc rim inati on. Most arguments against affirmative action programs are red herrings. Col'leges and universities have used \affirmative acti()n\ policies for centuries. Even now children of alumni/ae and professors are favored at most <:olleges, as are quarterbacks, field hockey players and tl1ose who can skate backwards. But also favored are th<Ose who play musical instmments, have artistic ability or have extensive records of community service. In short, non-academic criteria have always been use-d in admissions decisions in the hope that the enrolled student will have something 'ii'aluable to contribute to the college community. Wily shouldn't the ability to contribute a multicultural pe-rspective be as valued by the college as the genes of an alumna/us? Certainly the f()rmer is more \just\ than the latter. If we are serious about making education a process of encouraging intellectual bre3dth, how can any good colleg;e eliminate the program that increases the probability that we naive and parochial Desdemonas will meet our Othellas, who will expose us to the world (using the metaphor Oof Shakespeare via D'Souza)? In his indictment of \cultural/women studies\ as a scholarly endeavor, he clearly rn:isunderstands the dynamics of scholarship. In any emerging field of scholarship there are ~lways zealots, and there ~hould be. Scholarship, by its \Very nature, is often focused (!;orne would say narrow), especially in the initi31 stages tJf an emerging field. Only later do the generalities develop. 'Tilere is nothing wrong with searching for a female Sfuakespeare or an African irwentor of mathematics, clla:Jlenging personality theory fr()m a feminist perspective or dbing an investigation on the cross-cultural effects of Cllj)italism. Time and further S(;'holarship will winnow the ~lleat from the chaff. That's th~ way it has always been, and it should remain. Discrediting SJ)OCific studies or authors does not invalidate the field or the pr«ess. I do agree with D'Souza that tile US is embarking on a magnificent and noble e~periment by trying to become a truly multicultural ~ociety. If not unique, as ])'Souza states, it is certainly ~n uncommon endeavor. A (jllestion in my mind is wh.ether the D'Souzas of the world are helping or hindering tlu.t process.

WA<CJHrliAIR NYU SCHOOL OF :MIEDI<CJINE & UNION <COLJLEGJE ALUM!NUS CLASS OJFI '58 Thursday, January 301, '92 4:40 PM Social Sciences 104 Refreshmerzts 4:30 An En1barrassment To The College To the Editor: On Tuesday the 28th of January, Union College hosted speaker Dinesh D'Souza in Memorial Chapel. His remarks, as those of controversial speakers which have preceeded him, occsioned numerous questions from the audience and much dis- agreement on the part of those who heard him. The precipitation of these questions and the debates they sparked and fueled seemed to me to signify the success of the evening as part of the ongoing process of learning to which we, as members of .the college community, are purportedly dedicated. An essential part of this process is disagreement and debate, through which the intellectual faculties are nurtured and strengthened and knowledge is gained. It was an embarrassment to the college that Professor Theresa Meade had to choose such a public occsion to display her lack of appreciation for this purpose. During the question and answer period following Mr. D'Souza's speech, Professor Meade, like many others in the audience, legitimately attacked the speaker's assertions with some probing questions about the facts upon which these assertions were based. Unfortunately, she decided to end what could have bee11 an excellent question with an insult to the speaker rather than an intellectual query. The sarcastic and derog~ttory comment made about Mr. D'Souza's occupations and the \nice career [he] has maThaged to make for himself' was not only totally inappropriateo, but was a sorry reflection of both the character of Profeossor Meade and the college she represents. It is a tribute to the restraint of the speaker tbat he did not deign to answer to her kind. Fundamental disagreement and debate is a vital part ()f the intellectual process; one does not learn much by having ()ne's own .opinions echoed back at them. No one is askin~ or should ask Professor Meade to agree with Dinesh D'Souza. However, as members of the College community, it behooves us to ask that she not sully and impair the learning process of which she is supposed to be a part by red11cing it to an exchange of insults. Sincerely, Marc ICuritz The deadline for paper submissions for the New England Undergraduate Philosophy Conference at Tufts University on April 4, 1992 has been extended to Februacy 5. Anyone wishing to submit a paper should contact Professor Baker, who will mail out paper entries on February 5. Please not that the conference keynote speaker, Professor John Rawls, has given back his honorarium to be used as prize money. Thus there are now three prizes, the first prize being $250.00

The Solution For Union's Parking The administration should consider establishing a policy to solve the growing problem of parking at this school. The only lot which is not completely full around the clock is the extremely inconvenient Richmond Lot, which is constantly empty. Students solve the problem by ·parking illegally, in firelanes and other unsafe areas. Also, large numbers of students are forced to park on the street-- not a wise thing to do in Schenectady. As one can easily see by looking around today, the problem worsens during Vv'inter term with the snow. Problems financial problems. Taking as a given that the amount of parking spaces can not increase, it follows that the only way to solve the problem is to decrease the number of cars on campus. The administration should initiate a policy which would take care of the situation. The problem is· easy to understand. There are either not enough parking spaces on ca:mpus or there are too many cars. Since the school is incapable of maintaining the lots they already have -- some potholes are large enough to do .serious damage -- it is unlikely that any new lots will he constructed in the near future. This unfortunate fact is even more true with the school's current One such policy would prohibit freshmen from having cars on campus. The idea may not be loved by the members of the freshmen class, but in the long run, it would benefit the entire school. The policy is a very common one at universities throughout the country. In fact, many students are surprised to discover, upon enrollment, that they are allowed to bring a car to school during their first year. It is not necessary to have this unexpected privilege which actually cloes more bad than good. When the administration takes this idea into consideration, it will have the solution to the school's parking problem. ·.. · . ·· · . ···. .. · ... · ·. ··LE.Ta:EII!i; NoToThePub To the Editor: No to the ,pub! The College Center is crowded enough as it is. People are lucky if they can get an empty table especially between classes and during lunchtime. The closing off of the back section-the atrium and the wings to the left and right-will make overcrowding unbearable and certainly deter people from relaxing and socializing in the College Center. This, I should hope, is what the College Center was originally intended for. By the same token, the pub will be too small for its intentions. Surely no more than two hundred people could fit into the back area-that's without tables and couches-and be comfortable. Thus, the pub would do no more than make the present College Center dysfunctional and at the same time it would be insufficient for its own purposes. As for the argument that it will be a \social alternative,\ who are you kidding? Instead of getting drunk at a fraternity, people will get drunk in the College Center. I see no \social alternative\ there. Alcohol will, indeed, remain the social event, except that Union College will be providing it. There i~ something for the college to be proud of-providing alcohol kl an almost completely underage student body. Oh, I'm sure proper identification must be shown, but we all know how to get around that. And if there is a way to prevent underage students from purchasing alcohol, then what is the poilu of having a pub if only a fraction of the student body will be able to make use of it? As for Cabaret/Coffeehouse, it already exists as a true \social alternative\ and will remain as such whether or not this pub is actually constructed. Out of all of the things to invest in, financially, at Uni<Jn College, a pub should undoubtedly be at the bottom of the list. Where are our priorities? ·The Nott Memorial, the symbol most closely associated with Union College and which stands at the center of our beautiful campus, was once a glorious and magnifi- cent structure worthy of the highest admiration-today it is condemned. This, my fellow students, should be on the top of a list of truly important financial investments, along with such things as expanding our library, subsidizing the S.A.D.D. shuttle bus, and renovating certain donnitories. Sorry Student Forum, but a pub simply doesn't compete. Sincerely, Beth Pincus '93 To the Ediklr: After muddling through the one-sentence paragraphs of Jim Polites' article in last Thursday's Concordiensis, we the students in Electoral Politics (PSC-68) felt compelled to respond. His article, an editorial under the facade of \News Analysis,\ lacks substance, clarity, and ignores several relevant factors needed to analyze this year's presidential campaigns. Wh.ile image and personality are certainly important in a campaign, by no means are they the most important factors. If these were so important, how is it possible that Bill Clinton still leads the New Hampshire polls after the character attacks of the last two weeks? The fact that George Bush is vulnerable because of the economy is further proof that issues are the most important. Mr. Polites is grossly underestimating the American public if he believes that image and charisma are the primary factors in our electoral process. Your use of the Kennedy election as an example was far oversimplified. First of all, Kennedy's election was in Poor Politics 1960, not 1963 as you stated. (JFK was shot in 1963!) While we grant you that charisma did llelp Kennedy get elected. there were many other factors sucil as the \Blue Bomb\ in whicil Mr. Kennedy's campaign team swayed a huge portion of the African-American vote. In Mr. Polites' article, while discussing Mario Cuomo's absence from the campaign, he mentions that the early contenders lacked the necessary charisma to get elected. Later, he contradicts himself by saying that Bill Clinton. who was one of the early contenders, has \ably demonstrated that he's ready to assume the reins.\ Is it possible that Mr. Clinton had a sudden personality trnnsplant? Mr. Polites states that \three men have forged ahead as the favorite contenders.\ The three candidates mentioned, Clinton, Kerrey, and Tsongas. are the leaders in New Hampshire, but the last we checked, there are forty-nine other states in our country. He fails to mention Tom Harkin, who currently leads the polls in his home state of Iowa, and is a strong mid- Western candidate. In his sentence on Bob CROSSTALK Kerrey, Mr. Polites menti.ons that Kerrey stresses \conscience\ politics. While we are not even sure what he meant by this, we do know that Kerrey is running primarily on one issue - health care. We are also sure that Mr. Kerrey will send Mr. Polites a personal thank-you for his advice on becoming more :passionate. Since Mr. Polites has already enlightened as that it will be Bush vs. Clinton, we guess they should simply cancel the primaries. While it is possible that Mr. Clinton may in fact win the Democratic 11omination, it is far too early to come to such a conclusion. Therefore, do not throw away your absentee ballot application, for with every state's primary still ahead, your vote does still count. Contrary to what Mr. Polites would like you to believe, the primary season is far from over. In the future, we would encourage Mr. Polites to complete some research before writing his news \analysis.\ Sincerely, The students of SC-68 TUESDAY,FEBRUARY11 7:30PM Cabaret Room CC 302 '.'POLITICS IN THE CURRICULUM: 'POLITICAL CORRECTNESS' AT UNION?\ PROF.

Mother Cites Dangers of Rush To the Editor: As a parent of a Union College female, I find it quite commendable of the Editor of Concordiensis to have written the editorial entitled \Out in the cold but not left there.\ It is of my opinion that the current rush system is both degrading and superficial. My daughter went through rush as a freshman and unfortunately was one of those who \slipped through the system.\ After not receiving a bid at one of four sororities, my daughter felt alienated and suffered from a negative self-image. Being rejected by such a large group of girls can make one feel hurt and humiliated. My daughter felt that Union put extreme emphasis on rush week, bid dinner, and sorority life. No one offered emotional support for those who were neglected by the :system, thus making them ft:'rel like failures who were ig,llored by the system. I trul~ feel that the January 23 edit~rial was the first step toward :rnaking girls realize the positive side of independence. I was shocked that the response to this ·editorial was far from positive. How can members of sororities critique the only emotiontal support independent girls rne~y receive. I find it difficult to comprehend how these gil'ls can think that they actually sense the pain that my daughte-1 and others endured when they learned that they couldn\t participate in Greek life at Union. The letters to the editor were written by sorority members. This means these girls were denied acceptan~e into Greek life, but rather welcomed with positive sentiment. The feelings of hurt, neglect, isolation, and rejection are those which these authoi·s obviously escaped, and have little personal knowledge about. I feel that more should be done nationally to make the rush system less degrading and distressful. Maybe Panhel, the council that serves \all Greek women\ should consider the needs of non-Greek women, by allowing the addition of more national sororities to the present Greek system. Greeks should stop trying to pretend they know how it feels to be alienated from the system, and rather work on making rush a more positive, less exclasive process. A Concerned Parent of Daughter in Class of '93 All letters to the editor must be typed, double spaced, signed with a name, ID and telephone number and submitted to the Concordiensis Office by 4:00 pm on the Tuesday pre~eding weekly issuance of Concordiensis. CONCORDIENSIS • FEBRUARY 6,1992 • PAGE 12 Sorority Rush Behind the Times To the Editor: In response to last week's letters to the Editor, we would H:ke to further address the problem of Panhellenic Rush. We are concerned with the defensive attitudes expressed in the aforementioned letters. Even though we enjoy being members of a sorority, we fmd it difficult to defend a system that is so defective. Most s~Hority members believe that the rush process is flawed; a substantial number of women who want to join a sorority are not given an opportunity to become a member. F11rthermore, the procedures implemented during sorority rush are unquestion- ably sexist. Women who are interested in rushing are forced to adhere to the formal rush process as opposed to the men's informal, less structured system. In addition to the })redominant defects, many .people overlook what we think is the most severe problem. Some women feel considerable pain when they are excluded from. sorority membership; althm~gh we hOpe this pain is not \psychologically scarring for life\ it is certainly real for those who experience it and rnerits attention. Clearly, we rnust address the conflicting emotio:Q.S that these women have. There are no established Sllpport groups, other than Rho Chis, for women who might want them. We have recently become aware of the lack of such services for those who might want to take advantage of them. Perhaps the Panhellenic Council should organize a support system at Union. The National Panhellenic ·cm~ncil should make an effort to reflect the changes that our society has instituted since sororities were established. The· position of women has altered significantly because of these reforms. It is time for the nationally dictated rush procedures to join us as we move towards the twenty-first century. Kerry Blinder '92 Gabrielle Small '92 Show Some Respect For Our Red, White and Blue To the Editors: In the same field as the Nott lies another a blunder we all pass each day. I refer of course, to the flagpole, most specifically to the rag dangling from the top of it. Now don't get upset about an anti- American writer preaching subversion at Union. My message is of a different nature. I am personally outraged at the blatant disrespect shown to our flag. But don't get too happy about a super-patriotic column in the C o D c or d i e n s i s , because again, my message is of a different nature. I am, it could be said, one with a particularly strong sense of traditiom and convention. When I was given a flag to wave at a parade, I was told that there are certain ways that the flag is not treated~ It is NEVER to be flown a.t night, and NEVER to be flovn1 in inclement weather. There is also another stipulation which dictates that the flag must never touch the ground., but that is not a concern here at Union. The Americ::an flag is one which fills ma11y chests in the nation with, .among other things, pride, satisfaction with ourl Americ:::an status quo, and the impres:si.on of righteousness and jlllstice for which we interve11ed in the Persian Gulf. People llave, in a very real sense, FOUGHT AND DIED FOR THE FLAG, for the flag, as a symbol, not even concerned with its more symbolic meanings. I don't personally believe in all of these things our flag has come to stand for, but I firmly believe that if the flag is to be flown, it MUST be respected. In light of all of the media noise about flag burning, where the issue has been raised about whether it is allowable to dishonor the flag, our disregard for observance is noticeable. It is impossible for us to suppose ourselves patriotic, or even worthy of the ideals which our flag, in its finest, most symbolic state, CHINA: Cheap, Safe & Over One Million Served To the Editor: Has the flame of adventure, which once burned so fiercely in the hearts of Union students, now guttered out? Where are those erstwhile blossoms of intellectual curiosity and altruism - have they withered in the chill grey mists of apathy and preprofessionalism? Nonsense! There must be other reasons why this school, where students five years ago fell over one another to queue up for the China Term, sent no one to China last year. I prefer to believe that the student body must be grossly misinformed about the program and the country. Herewith are facts, for the adventurous: 1) You'll never find a cheaper term abroad. Arrive in Florence (or even worse, Osaka), and we're talking instant financial hemorrhage. But China is (still!) a place where it's virtually impossible to spend money. Dinner at the best restaurant in town: $5.00. Weird curios to bring home to your kid sister: $1.50. A top- of -the-ILne bicycle on which to tool ar()u:nd Nanjing: $35. At term's end, travel the length and breatlth of the country, into Tibet, l>eyond: you'll never spend more than $20 for a hotel f()()ffi (unless you want the ex]Jerience of living inside plate glass and air conditi&ningl) 2) Cltina is a stable and s~cure country. Your mom is gonna say, \China? You cat{t go to China! they kill people in China ... \ Give your Jl1()m a message from someoJte who has spent the last tweJity-five years studying China: your actuarial risk of death is. clearly greater if you stay in Schenectady. I will sell your mom a life insurance policy, very inexpensive. There is no safer country to which (() send a nice young Americoo college student. 3) China will enhance your career prospects. Would you like your resume to sbow some knowledge of the country which has grown faster, for over ten years, than any other country in the world? A country with a billion people? All of whom like Big Macs? China is the Korea and Taiwan of the 21st century - the century in which you will be making your career. Now, there are probably also some people out there who just want a term abroad which promises fun, great company, a little adventure, something out of the ordinary. For you enlightened folks, the best place to find out more information is the Terms Abroad Office. Sincerely, Prof. Bruce Reynolds ANONYMOUS LETTERS AND THOSE OVER 500 WORDS WII~L NOT BE PRINTED represents, if at the same time we show no respect for the colored cloth actually on the pole. If we don't take it down at night and shelter it when it rains, and make a hallowed ceremony of daily raising the Stars and Stripes, we may as ·well be burning it. Perhaps it is just typical of Union's tendency to make an outward show of devotion to an end without any but a waning interest, b11t the flag is and of itself, demands the respect it is not getting. This disregard is intolerable and shows very poorly on the school for our lack of commitment to an ideal common to all but the few international students. If the symbol of our country bas become so disrespected, how long before our institutions are treated the same? Most, if not all of the men who died for this country knew that when they died, a flag over their coffin was a respect the United States would afford them. The flag flown over Union's campus should be worthy of acting as a burial shroud for any corpse from any war, not just another ineffectual and worn out symbol which has· lost its symbolism. Otherwise, it isn't worthy of being flown at all. Daniel J.

Fried Green Tomatoes by Ned Walley Arts Editor \Fried Green Tomatoes\ is a movie that shows through strength, perseverance, and individuality, one can truly find happiness. Based on Fannie Flag's novel, Fried Green Tomatoes at the Whistle Stop Cafe, the movie stars Jessica Tandy as an old widow from the town of Whistle Stop named Ninny. She now lives in a nursing home, the same home where Mrs. Buddy Couch's (Kathy Bates) aunt resides. One day the two meet and Ninny starts revealing an old tale about two of her friends, Itchy (Mary Stewart Masterson) and Ruth (Mary Louise Parker). Ninny goes back to the days when Whistle Stop was more than a dilapidated old town, and describes the friendship between these two women that gave them enough energy to deal with the hardships that accompany anyone who lives outside the social \normsn. This movie demonstrates the strength of women, specifically, the strength that lies under all the deep-fried gentility accredited to the women of the South. This trait dates back to the time of the Civil War when the women were left to manage the home while the men were all off fighting. The most known example of this generalization is Scarlett O'Hara, but more recently, the viewer has seen interpretations iu \Steel Magnolias\ and \Thelma and Louise\. However the main characters from these movies have evolved from struggling to provide daily necessities, to having an utter sense of futility after conquering the hardships of cooking and cleaning. \Fried Green Tomatoes\ shows how one woman (Bates) reacts after having a mirror put in front of her face. The fact ~hat this plight of the Southern woman has caught so much attention is fascinating. It can't be only a regional epidemic; however, being from the South, I am not able to count the number of friends' mothers who either went back to finish college, get a masters degree, or find a job. This new trend might stem from the fact that the South is \behind the timesn, is not just a Yankee quirk, but might also be a reality. Whether it comes from here, though, it has surely caught the attention of the nation's moviegoers. This film is yet another chapter in the metamorphoses of women. It is heart-warming and entertammg, that is if entertainment can exist without containing bad language, machine guns, and sex. ~ ebl\,u.aR./ 7 21\d 9 1\\emo~\ a.

The play will be Feb. 13 to 15 and 18 to 22 at 8 p.m. in the Nott Memorial Theater at the center of the Union College campus. Tickets are $5 for the public. The play is directed by Lee Bloomrosen, a 1976 graduate of Union who is director of the College Center and assistant professor of theatre. Churchill, one of Britain's most prolific playwrights, also penned the critically acclaimed \Cloud Nine.\ \Top Girls is a play which presents the predicament . of Matt Futterman Receives Wittenberg Award Matthew Futterman, a 1991 graduate of Union College, has had a signal honor bestowed on his writing. His story, \What's To Say, Really,\ has been published in the Spring, 1991 edition of The Wittenberg Review: An Undergraduate Journal of College Writing. The Wittenberg Review, published twice yearly by Wittenberg University in Springfield, Ohio, is the first national, undergraduate journal of college writing and presents some of the best research and creative writing produced by students at leading U.S. liberal arts colleges. At Union College, Futterman was an English major and editor of nThe Idol,\ the school's literary magazine. Top 1 o Movies . independent women who must deal with the complications of trying to succeed in a 'man's world',\ Bloomrosen said. \Not only must they overcome the inevitable competition with men, but they must balance the demands of family and home with their natural desire to improve their own lives. Churchill creates for us a world io which many women, past and present, reveal the price that each has paid for her success -- and then questions the very concept of success itself.\ Bloomrosen added that the play conveys a sentiment once expressed by Mary Robinson, the president of Ireland: \The cause of women is inseparable from the cause of h1:1manity itself. A society that is without the voice and vision of women is not less feminine, it is less human.\ ''The play is about women's issues and how they are reflected on all people, regardless of gender,\Bloomrosen said. The play will explore issues such as family versus career, family ties, and power, he said. The play addresses what Bloomrosen says is as \built-in conundrum\ of many college theatre programs. \Playwrights write from. their own experience,\ he said. \Since most playwrights in the past have been male, there traditionally have been available mroe roles for men.\ The conundrum, he says, is that college theatre programs, as a rule have more women involved than men.

I mean, this play is everything about ancl for women, and most specifically and personally, for African American women. ActuaUy, the \play\ is a choreopoem, a collection of poems presented theatrically by an ensemble of women who dance and chant while simultaneously piecing together their stories. For Colored Girls ... was written by a woman named Ntozake Shange, and was first performed in small clubs around the San Francisco area in 1974. The procl.uction eventually moved to New York where it grew into a .popular and well-defined Breadway event in 1976. Two years ago, portions of the choreopoem were read at one of Union's dramatic readings, and now, under the direction of Marina Bernard, For Colored Girls ... will be performed in its entirety on honor of Black History Month. Shange tells the story of how her choreopoem came into being in the introduction to the work. and says that when she began studying the intricacies of African dance, \...

PAGE 17 Women's B-BaR Splits Against Tough Foes by Dan Strum Sports- Editor The women's basket~all team ·split games this past week as they faced Hartwick and Albany in two home contests. Both teams were considered to be formidable opponents and Union was looking for some solid efforts if they were to prevail The lady Dutchmen won 'the first game against Hartwick by a score of 63-58. However, they dropped the second one 68-54 to a ranked SUNY Albany team. In both games Union had impressive showings which added to their fine play thus far this season. Their record now stands at 9-6. Union's win over Hartwick was especi~lly satisfying as they had not bested Hartwick for several seasons. Robin Romer led the team with 32 points while freshman Andrea Pagnozzi put up 14 of her own. Two nights later. Union faced Albany who is ranked eighth in the nation. The 'lady Dutchmen were in the game for most of regulation, but they let it get away in the end stages of the game. For most of lhe second half it was a four-point game. When they stuck to their game plan they perfonned well. Albany has an explosive run- and-gun offense which needed to be controlled. When Union slowed down the pace of the game, Albany did not get the same scoring opportunities which they normally get. However, when it came to Union's offensive ou~put, their 33% field goal shooting in the second half was one of the key reasons why Albany pulled away in the end. This year Union is focusing on team play. They are working on their strengths first, instead of keying solely on the play of their opponents. Many oppos1ng defenses key in on Robin Romer. SJatistics dictate that they should, seeing that she leads the team in scoring with a 17 ppg average and in rebounding with just over 10 rebounds a game. John Audino Named Head Football Coach Courtesy of Sports Information John Audino has been named the 33rd llead coach in tb.e 106- year football history of Union College. The announcement was made Friday, Jan. 31 by Director of Athletics Dick Sakala at a press conference on the Union campus. The naming of Audino marks the return to the Capital District for the 38-year-old coach. A 1971 graduate of Vincentian Institute, Audino was the offensive cootdinator for three seasons at Union and was also the College's head baseball coach, establishing a school record for wins in a season with his 16-9 team of 1985. Audino, who· received his undergraduate degree from the University of Notre Dame in 1975-where he was a wide receiver on the 1973 national championship team- com- pleted llis masters at the University at Albany. While at Albany, Audino worked under head coach Bob Ford as the Great Danes' special teams coordinator. Audino, who has been the head coach at Kean College the past two seasons, has had a wealth of coaching and recruiting experience on the Division I, IAA, and III levels the past 15 years. Prior to Coming in 3 Weeks Find the Dutchmen Contest taking his first head coaching position at Kean, Audino served for four seasons as wide receiver and quarterback coach for the University of Pennsylvania. While at Penn, the Quakers won the Ivy League Championship in both 1986 (where they were ranked seventh nationally) and in 1988 (ranked 16th nationally). a three-year record of28-5 with three invitations to the NCAA. \I feel very fortunate to have been given the opportunity to carry on the outstanding tradition of Union College, both on the football field and in the classroom,\ said Audino. \Being the head coach at Union College is like a dream come true for me. The career moves John Audino Before coaching at Penn, that I've made since I left here Audino served as an ~sistantat in 1986 were pointed to Columbia University.

Union is working on moving the ball around to get more people into the offensive flow. Freshman Andrea Pagnozzi has had an impressive showing as of late. She is one of the best shooters ()n. the team and as a result, she bas worked her way into the starting lineup. Pagnozzi is averaging over 12 ppg. There are several players who have contributed to this team's effort. Senior Jean Lopata has had a tremendous season. Her defensive and rebounding abilities .j,n addition to her leadership skills have proved to be quite valuable to the squad. Michelle Kleinhaus, who plays center, had a good showing in the Albany game. She has had a oJnsistent season thus far. This is noteworthy considering that Kleinhaus draws many of the tough defensive assi:gnments in the game. Soj)hcmore Andrea Light has made her presence felt on the flol!>r as well with some fine overaH play. On~ of the goals for the wurnen's basketball team this se~s();n is to finish over .500, a11 achievement that they are weH on their way lO comiJ'leting. Perhaps a more illlp-orlant goal is for the team to qu.alify for the New York St2te Championships. This is an ~xtremely competiti vc tournament which will take son~ hard work and determination to qualify for. The Sport Of Champions by Peter ProtzeJ Co11.cordiensis Staff In the early evening hours of Friday, January 31, 1992 an athletic event took place in the Union College Fieldhouse. Carefully watching this event one must watch for large weighted objects flying through the air. In addition the observer must carefully proceed through the facility in order not to obstruct competitors. This sport can be played indoors or outdoors and may even draw crowds at pivotal competitions. The competitors are usually well trained and coached by geniuses of their sport. This athletic discipline has legends as well as heroes and it is included in the summer Olympic games. This sport is disgraced by drug and steroid problems among the elite competitors. On a basic level it includes some form of throwing, jumping and even running. This activity is one of the oldest known to man and every country in the world has at least one team. Requiring little resources this athletic activity shows no racial or social barrier that may inhibit individuals from taking part. The most surprising thing is that every person alive has taken part in this activity. If you have reached this point and still do not know what this article is about then you missed the track and field meet that occurred in the fieldhouse this past weekend. This is easily overlooked due to the senior night festivities taking place at Kelly's. What occurred was another Union loss to RPI, but this time no oranges. We must focus on the positive results which included a number of excellent perfonnances. Albany State University was also present at this meet and they showed their dominance while leaving their horses l1o111e. This is by no means an insult but just a comment on the high caliber of Albany's pro _gram. This University, many magnitudes larger than Union, recruits heavily and is able to attract division one caliber athletes. For the first time in the history of the Collegiate Track Conference a di-vision three team (Albany) beat a strong field of division one schools in the outdoor meet last spring. What this program has is the ability to prornise division one upgrade in a. few years. Looking at the bud_get situation in New York Stlltc one must question the availability of funds. Anyway, the <lirection of their track and field program is upward, and eventually we will no longer COITl\)Cte with Albany on any real is tic level. L()oking at the results from this weekend one will not sec many- surprises, but we must lo.ol beyond point totals. Union's Glen Meixell (the tearn'.s leading pole vaulter), in his ~econd year after a transfer fr()m Alfred University, has denloped into a consistent point scorer that works hard at his event. The pole vault wllich requires speed and strength is one of the most technically demanding events. Gl~ll this week cleared twelve feet six inches in his best perf()rmance of tile season. AEotller leading scorer is Bill TayliQr who hails from Ne~J~~tOwn, Connecticut. Bill in his j11nior year is the team's leadi11g sprinter competing in the 5:5 thru the 400 and sllo-~Ving signs of 800m possiblities. Bill's specialty and favorite race is the 55 meters through which he collsistently impresses the cr<Jvrtl. With an explosive start and cat-like quickness he is able io distance himself early. Tllat is it for this week's profiles but next week look for memoirs of a week off. SUPPORT UNIGN SPORTS J

CONCORDIENSIS • FEBRUARY e, 1992 • PAGE 18 Letter To The Sports Editor History Made in Harvard Loss To the Editor: It was an embarrassing night for Union College. It had nothing to do with the score of tbe hockey game against RPI, though. The embarrassment was that RPI came here and turned AchiUes Rink into \Houston Field House West.\ Since our hockey team has j()ined Division I, fan support has been far lrmn outstanding, especially when you consider that Union probably has the most generous ticket procedure in the ECAC. At many schools, students have to wait in long lines to PAY for a ticket. Here you just stop by the rink on Monday or Tuesday before a game, and you can get one of 1,250 free tickets, half of the rink, set aside as complementary for Union students, faculty, and staff. It's more fun to win than to lose - that's a given fact - but to start a winning tradition, the team needs the support of their friends and fans. Don't let their record fool you; there is no lack of effort on the part of the players. They always play an exciting style of hockey resulting in highly entertaining games. Since Christmas break, they have earned a tie at nationally-ranked Yale, and their first ECAC win with a dramatic overtime goal at Dartmouth. During the Division III days, visiting teams hated coming to Jllay at Achilles. To put it mildly, the Union fans always made things rough for the visiting team. But recently. travelling fans from visiting teams do the sarne to the Dutchmen in OUR rink. Their bands are larger and louder and they out-cheer Union fans. Their teams play inspired hockey when they see fans to ]>lease, an extra reason to win. The Dutchmen have lacked that level of support as of late. During the .final weekend of winter break, Cornell came to play Union. Achilles Rink was sold out. Unfortunately, better than half the crowd was from Cornell. They brought a band of over 20 members, banners, and most importantly, fans who supported their team by making noise. You can say that this was just because Union was still on break. Many students just couldn't get to the game. Fine. But for the RPI game, there was no excuse. The RPI fans outnumbered the Union fans. They brought a band of well ()Ver 30 members, while Union's band could only find nine. Tbe worst part of this. though, has to be the fact that hundreds of tile FREE tickets went unclaimed! Easily the biggest game of the season, and people couldn't find time to stop at the rink to pick up a free hockey t,icket? ? Any tickets unclainled at the end of the pick-up times go on sale to the general public. It did not take long fGr these tickets to sell out, undcubtedly many of them to RPI fans. As concerned members of the Union College student body \VC ask every .person on this campus for h.elp. There will be two borne ·games, against Vennont and· Dartmouth, on the weekend of February 7 and 8. Corne out and cheer your Skating Dutchmen on. Having followed them all season, we can certainly say that they have earned your support. We challenge you to bring back the spirit that has been lacking an season long by getting involved during the hockey games. We knew that the team appreciates everyone's support as they build the foundation for the new tradition of ECAC Hockey here at Union. Michael Rizzo '92 J()shua Haravay '94 Jim Teresco '92 Continued from page 20 three goals, two of them on the power-play, to build a 4-llead. The Dutchmen needed a spark if they wanted to prevent the game from getting out of reach. Union got a lift from their top li11e as they came storming out. Craig Ferrero scored his tenth goal of the season assisted by Railton. The same Hne stayed on the ice and continued their pressure adding another goal just 30 seconds later. This time it was Railton notching his seventh of the season on assists from Ferrero and Burchill. Although it was a tough weekend, several players deserve some recognition for their efforts. Sophomore Jayson Flowers and Freshmen Chris Albert and Dean Goulet all turned in solid efforts throughout the course of the weekend. Luigi, Villa turned in a fine performance in goal on Saturday as he made 41 saves. Ski Teams Attack West Mountain Continued from page 20 twelfth and twenty-first overall. In the men's race, Junior Sean Livingston turned in his best result of the season in g.s. by piacing first for the Dutchmen and sixth overall. Junior Brooks \It's time to pay a visit to Joe S11perior\ Glahn, Wom.en's Track Racking Up The recorded his first top ten giant slalom finish and placed second for the bcardmen. Josh Goldberg and Josh \Willnot\ Kane placed fourth and fifth for Union and twenty-sixth and thirty-first cverall, respec- tively. teammates in Schenectady on Sunday managed to arrive a West quick enough for the start of the race. Unfortunately, he didn't ski down the hill near as quickly as he got to the mountain, and thus finished nineteenth overall. Slosh Goldberg turned in a sclid third place finish for the team and twenty-third overall, while Kane was right on his tail with a twenty-fourth place result. For Livingston, Sunday was the quickest three gate race of his illustrious career. His mind was probably in Tampa Bay. by Tasha LaBare Concordiensis Staff The saga continues at a climatic pace as the women's track and field team gave yet another impressive perfor- mance. This week, the lady tracksters tackled colleges from around the Capital District area. The women went through a rigorous week of work-outs, only to prove that they have what it takes by placing 2nd overall in the CD meet. Continuing on her victory streak, Alix \The Amazing\ Goldschmidt posted two more victories for herself. To start off, Alix dominated the weight with a winning toss of 10.33m. Her next event, the shot put, held similar success. Alix heaved the shot 12.03m to capture her second first place of the day. The track was just as victorious for the women's team. To start it off, Denise Saunders, Tasha LaBare, and Nadine Filosi all breezed into the finals of the 50m dash. Once there, tbe girls were just WJ·s as impressive, Denise inched out an Albany girl to capture 1st place. D. breezed across the line with a time of 6.9. Next for the lady Dutchmen was Tasha LaBare placing third overall. Little Nadine, captured a fourth place finish with a quick time of 7.4. Our little rookie Nadine took to the track ,once again to dominate the entire field in the 50m high hurdles. Not only did Nadine run a great time of 8. 7 but she -crushed the field to place first overall. Tile next item on the .agenda is the 400m dash. Joy Grillion teamed up with Tasha LaBare to cause havoc in this event. Joy pulled out a fourth :place finish while smokin' every girl in her heat.

Australia:n Olympic Federation, Brian Sando, did say that Magic Johnson should be barred fr;Qm the 1992 Summer Games ilue to his contraction of the IJIV virus; however, several days after Mr. Sando's remarks the Australian Olympic Federation rescinded their remllfks and went one step further by inviting by inviting Magic t& play in their home country at any time. --Later in January, I OC president Juan Antonio Samaranch said Johnson was welcome to play in Barcelona, and the Medical Committee chairman of the IOC said that there were no medical reasons why Magic Johnson should not play in the Olympics. In just her freshman season, Landa has earned the number one spot on the women's team. In the meet this past weekend, Landa took first place overall in the women's giant slalom and second place overall in the women's slalom.

For those of you who like to leap before you look - WISE UP!! There are many things that are true about the situation and many that have not been. confirmed. I feel it is my duty to help the turncoats of the community to stop making asses of themselves ... so here are the facts that are known to date about Magic Johnson and his playing possioilities. --Leading AIDS experts have stated over and over that the chances ()f contracting AIDS, even open wound on open wound, are infinitesimal.

The Dutchmen played hard on Friday night, but they were edged out by Brown 4-3. In the Saturday afternoon contest, Union stayed with Harvard for part of the game, but they were eventually overcome by a score of 7-3. The Saturday game was a 3:00 p.m. start. One has to wonder whether fatigue was a factor as the game seemed to slip away in the third period. Union came in fired up to play Brown. They had dropped a close 3 -2 decision in an exciting game at Achilles Rink back in November and the Dutchmen were looking to step up their level of play in this the second half of their season. However, Union seemed to shoot themselves in the foot. Untimely penalties helped shift the momentum to Brown. The Bears put in a power-play goal with just 1 :31 remaining in regulation to go ahead for good at 4-3. Coach Bruce Delventhal was not pleased with the number of penalties which served to disadvantage the team throughout the game. It is something which the Dutchmen plan to work on.

United States Student Association Organizes Grassroots Campaigns Courtesy of Nat'l Stude11t News Service In addition to holding national demonstrations in Washington, D.C., students across the country arc also working on local grassroots campaigns to defeat the Department of Education's proposal to eliminate race- specific scholarships. Organized by USSA, an advocacy group for student governments and campus organizations, the local campaigns will inv()!ve students on more than 100 campuses located in the districts represented by senators and representatives who serve on education committees. Student legislative efforts 'Will include letter-writing cam- paigns and phone calls aimed at defeating the proposal. \We are not going to lie down and take this,\ says USSA's Coordinator of Recruitment and Retention Alicia Ybarra. \We're going to Congress to ask them to make race-based scholarships legal.\ \I'm going to get as many students as I can get my hands on,\ says Charity hicks, president of Eastern Michigan University's (EMU) Black Student Union, one of the organizations participating ill USSA's grassroots campaign . Hicks, a senior studying social science, is organizing a call-in to the Department of Education during the month of February. \If I can get 50,000 students to call in with me, my voice wi 11 be resounding.\ According to the Department of Education, the proposal is necessary in order to clarify its ruling on race-spccifi c scholarships, which in the past has been inconsistent. Students involved in USSA's grassroots efforts, including members of the Student Association of the State University of New York (SASU), the Black Student Union at EMU, and the African Student Union at UCLA, expect to generate hundreds of phone-calls and more than 50 letters from student leaders expressing outrage over the Department's proposal. calling in and writing to their congressmen and the education department,\ says Hicks. Randy Campbell, a senior studying psychology at SUNY- Stony brook, adds, \Students become politically active for various reasons, but access to college is an issue that speaks to all students.\ \We want to get people involved who arc not normally active to show their support by Campus Incident Security Reports DATE 2/3/92 2/3/92 2/6/92 2/6/92 2/6(92 217192 217192 2lZ!92 217192 2!7192 218/92 2/9/92 2(9/92 2/9/92 LOCATION INCIDENT Nott Memorjal Vandalism to emergency and Basement courtesy teleobooes Fox House False Fire Alarm-Pull Box- Life Safety Vjolation Notjca Davidson Burglary/theft of personal property from student's room. :'lorth College Disruptive behavior-student toward. other students- Conduct charves filed, West College vandalism to light pole, W!i!st College Unauthorized entry, SlUdent into another student's room.

Then the IJlight of William Kennedy Smith, who found himself in a Florida courtroom charged with rape following the events of a. wild, alcoholic evening with Uncle Ted. Most recently there is the trial of 25-year-old Mike Tyson, the youngest heavy- weight boxiitg champion -- and an individ11al who seemed unable to escape the downside of recognition and stardom. Not a month could go by without us reading of his tendency to find trouble, whether it be scuffling with a former ring adversary, divorcing Robin Givens, or crashing his BMW into a streetside tree (then attempting to bribe a police officer). The unfortunate part of all this, of course, is that Tyson~s tremendous athletic accom- plishments were dwarfed by controversy and a public perception that is less than hospitable. Despite relativ-e youth, he revolutionized an entiie sport, at once becoming tile most feared-and wealthy- boxer in history. The unfortunate part ()f aU this is that 1'yson 's tremendous athletic accomplishments were dwarfed by a )lublic perception that is less than bospitable. Maybe this was just too much for one young man to take, though. Now, here is Mike Tyson-found guilty on one count of rape and two of deviant behavior, charges that C()uld add up to a maximum of sixty years in jail, though many experts have said that he will serve no more than ten. The question of time served in prison will be answered definitively on March 3, but the debate over all the circumstances and long- reaching effects of trial proceedings will carry on for quite a while. As a celebrity judge for the Miss Black Teenage America Pageant, Tyson was successfully accussed of physically overpowering an 18- year-old contestant, forcing sexual intercourse. The trial, obviously, hinged on the pro~ecution's efforts to champion the bravery. strength, and honesty of the accuser-all the while harping on the defendant's lack of social credibility and past deviant behavior. It's no secret that an ingrained perception of Tyson lead to his imminent downfall. In the wake of yet more court hearings that have captured national headlines and attention, there are a myriad concerns and consequences that demand scrutiny. First, and perhaps most insignificantly, is the black mark on boxing itself. Wliile consistently generating revenue and filling arena seats, the sport has always labored und~er indictments of corrupti~11. partisanship,. and favoritism. The trial hinged on the prosecution's efforts to champion the bravery of the accuser - all the whiloe harping on the de fen dent's lack of social credibility and past deviant behavior. Many a!igue that th c spectacle of boxing lack-s something paramount in spmt.s competition-the presence ()f role models. Mike Tyson-tile most acclaimed fighter since Muhammed Ali-is a sad symbol of t~is failure. Leaving the sporting reah11, we can tie into the Tyson conviction the cases of Thoma.,s and Kennedy Smith. With th~ previous two episodes still fresh in the minds of th~ American public, I for one believed that a rape conviction would be incredibly difficult, despite Tyson's background. I also believe, though, that our' system and reliance on precedent (concerning both previous cases and other individuals) hurt the former champion irreparably. People were bound to reflect back on Thomas and Kennedy Smith and try to find some consistency. some common frame of reference. In all honesty, I think all three of the accused were guilty. Why was Tyson the only one indicted? It's because he was the individual who jurors and the public could most closely associate with such a crime-he wasn't nominated for the Supreme Court nor was his family name the closest thing to royalty this country has. Mike Tyson's career and life will never again be the same. Probably the truest-and most sad-fact of all is that it seems such an ending was inevitable. Is Safety At Union An Issue by KEn Perel Contribllting Writer In 1990 and 1991, Security responded to 102,220 separate calls. Thes~ ranged from unlocking d()rm rooms to hospital transJlortation. There were no reperted rapes or attempted rapes in this time peri<>d. There have been less than 10 attacks against students by .non-students in the last five years. The majority of both pmperty crimes and crimes against the person are perpetrated by fellow students; which raises the question of safety from each other, and .. Q9t the outside surroundings. Every group interviewed for this article reached the same conclusion: t:he Security at Union College is adequate. When asked to define this, the ,general response was that although this i:s a safe campus, and although the Security is protecting the student body to the best of its ability, it could be doing a better job. Below are a few of the suggestions given. • Each donn should have a check in policy. If a ·student resides in any on-campus residence, that student would~ have a sticker on his/her ID. For ex.ample, if a student lived in West, thell he/she would have a West College sticker on his/her ID car<!. Without this sticker, no student could gain access to the dormitory. Friends would have to be signed into the dorm by an authorized student. Under this system, every student in the donn would be accounted for, and tile dorms would be safer. Tli.is system was thought workable by ooth the Women's Uni()n and Dean Mammola. Part Three of Three Ullfortunately, Brendan Clifford, student body vresident voiced resistance to this idea because he did not want the dorms to be policed. That is, Ullion has a nice policy of open dorms, and if each dorm had a check in system, the flowing campus atmosphere would be curtailed. • There should be more lighting on campus. There are many areas that are dangerously dar.k, and offer a potential risk. The administration should be aware of these problem areas, aDd fix them as soon as possible. Every group interviewed for this article reached the same conclusion; the security at Union College is adequate. President Hull and members of the Grounds Department sponsored a walk through campus with students for the purpose of planning future lighting. Only two students participated. On Saturday night, as he was leaving A ell ill es Rink from a side exit, he noticed that although there were lights, the wattage was too low for safety's sake. He is having these lights changed. As he stated, unless the students bring these exact locations and ideas to him, he cannot help. He can only spend so much time himself looking over c3111pus. • Besides car patrols and escort service, there should be a foot patrol and foot escort service. Both of these systems either exist or existed. In the warmer weather, there are foot patrols around campus. Although these patrols do not have the quick response time that their counterparts in the cars have, they are a visible presence. On two separate occasions, the foot escort service was implemented, but soon abandoned. The students would not use the foot escort service as long as there was a car to take them. Why should they wa1k if they could ride? Why will the school not fund the newly created escort shuttle bus? This belief is totally incorrect. First. there is no real need for a shuttle bus. There is no place on campus that cannot be walked to within five minutes. (As one Student Forum Representative stated, this would be a perfect means to complete the campus crawl.) Second, for real escort needs, there is the Security escort service. In 1991, this escort service made 13,102 responses, with an average of three people per response. This is a blatant abuse of the system that is meant to protect the students. President Hull offered a compromise to the student body over the funding of this shuttle bus. If the students will stop abusing the Security escort service, and use it only as an emergency escort service, he would fund the shuttle bus every night. The natural question then arises as to what constitutes abuse. Below is my list of acceptable and unacceptable uses of security escort. Acceptable Escort Uses • Medical transP9rtation. • Post dark escort from academic buildings to dorm or apartment only. Unacceptable Escort Uses • Taxi service of any type. Includes, but not limited t(), transportation to and from bar.s and parties; use when too cold to walk, or even too lazy. Every time Security escort service plays taxi service, there is a g•·eater re<luction in response time to any legitimate safety concern. Every time the Securitr Escort Service plays taxi service, there is a greater reduction in response time t() any legitimate safety concern. The choice is up to the students, but one way or another, the abuse of the Security Escort Service must stop. We ate all grown people, with legs and the ability t<l walk. Let's use them to wall in pairs or groups to our chosen destinations. ... The Security Department is protecting the student body to the best of its abilities. Paul Mantica and his staff are doing everything in their power to create a reasonably safe campus. Students also have a responsibility to help create a reasonably safe campus. We must use our intellect to create situations whereby we are unvictimizable. We must always, whether male or female, walk in groups of two or more. We must walk in the well lighted areas, instead of complaining about the darkened areas. We cannot prop doors open, or leave our rooms unlocked. Most importantly, we must not abuse the systems that were installed to protect us in true security situations. We, as students, are as responsibile for our safety as the Safety Department ~Pl!' for a ~etus ~osition Just Call Jim at X415l or Jordan at 374-a778

THE KISS THAT KILLED (14th century) A young lady in medieval Italy took advantage of her in- laws' tradition of kissing the lips of a marble bust in order to uncover an alleged household treasure, By applying poison to the marble lips, the woman killed two members of the family and proceeded unhampered into a secret room. There she found, not a treasure, but a defonned child. The dying head of the family, her third victim, cursed the woman, promising that her own child as well as the offspring of every seventh generation would be so defonned THE KISS THAT COST THOMAS SA VERLAND HIS NOSE (1837) In 1837, at the dawn of the Victorian Era in Great Britain, Thomas Saverland attempted to kiss Caroline Newton in a light-hearted manner. Rejecting Saverland's pass, Miss Newton not so lightheartedly bit off part of his nose. Saverland took Newton to court, but she was acquitted. \When a man kisses a woman against her will,\ ruled the judge, \she is fully entitied to bite his nose, if she ·so pleases.\ \And eat it up,\ added a barrister. THE KISS BY FRAN<;OIS AUGUSTE RODlN (1886) One of the most renowned pieces of .sculpture in the Western World is The Kiss. sculpted by French artist Fran~ois Auguste Rodin in 1886. Inspired by Dante, the figure of two nude lo\'ers kissing brought the era of classical art to an end. Rodin described The Kiss as \complete in itself and artificially set apart from the sTiffidiMos¥·'~FTEN KISSED STATUE IN HISTORY (late 1800s) The figure of Guidaretlo Guidarelli, a fearless 16th- century Italian soldier, was sculpted in marble by Tullio Lombardo (c. 1455-1532) and put on display at the Academy of Fine Arts in Ravenna, Italy. During the late 1800s, a rumor started that any woman who kissed the reclining, armor-clas statue would marry a wonderful gentleman and settle down with him. Fome four to five million superstitious women have since kissed Guidarelli's cold marble lips. Consequently, the soldier's mouth has acquired a faint reddish glow. THE KISS THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN (1975) King Faisal of Saudi Arabia was engaged in discussions with the Kuwaiti oil minister when the king's nephew. Prince Faisal ibn Mussad Abdel Aziz, burst into the office unannounced. The king stood and, assuming that the prince wished to offer hirn holy greetings for Mohammed's birthday, lowered his head and waited for tbe traditional kiss. It never arrived. Instead the prince fired a bullet into the king's head, and then another into his neck, killing him.

Courtesy of Council on International Educatifmal Exchange Understanding the dimensions of Japan's b11siness world has become an essential aspect to the succ~ss of international business professionals. With this in mind, the Council on International Educational Exchange, a non-profit organization, established a seven-week academic program that allows young professionals who have recently begun their careers, as well as undergraduate and graduate students planning for business careers, to _get an insider's view of Japanese society and its basiness culture. The Cooperative Japanese Business & Society Pmgram takes place from June 11 to August 3, 1992, in Tokyo. The two courses that make up the program are held at the Waseda Hoshien Center and are conducted in English by Japanese and foreign faculty from Japanese colleges and universities. The first course, the Business and Society Seminar provides an overview of Japanese business, with an emphasis on its international aspects. In addition to classroom instruction and guest lectures by prominent Japanese and international business leaders, coursework includes an individual research project in one of the following areas: finance, marketing, human relations management, or production management. Outside the classroom, students visit Japanese business firms, banks, government offices, labor as s~dati()ns, and factories, repres:enting a cross-section of JaiJ!lnese industry.

Although my friends decided to go home:, I was ha'l·tng a good time and wanted to sta:y out for a little while longer. We stayed out together until maybe three, when I asked if he W(lruld walk me h()me~ as I did nc:lt want to walk alone. Even though it was cold and out ofllis way, he readily consented. \I wculd say I was defmitely attracted to him. I in-vited him into my room., and we immediately started to fool arouncl. At first it was simple kissing and slight )Jetting. Afterashort time however, the simple kissing and petting became oral and digital sex. We were both having a highly pleasurable time. I W()Uld not have slept with him be. fore we started to fool around, but once he entered me, it seemed like a natural progression. \I do not know if l asked him to stop, and I do JJOt know if I had done any tlling to physically resist him. In a way I enjoyed the sex, but I did not recall saying, 'Okay, you can have sex with me' or anything of thatnature. It was uue thatl was sexually excited, but I am not a slut, and am actually a little sfly about my se>:uality.

She had been friendly and flirtatious all evening, and I had heard that she had slept with a few people. She did not protest when I put my arm around her, or when I said that sile was attractive. We got along well, I thought I would ask her out on a date. \Once we got into her room, we started to fool around immediately. At first we kissed tentatively and kept our hands to ourselves, but within a short time, we let our passion direct us. She was an equal participant, and l felt that she was having as good a time as I was. Within a short time, we had performed oral sex on each other. After a short hugging and kissing session, I began to have sex with her. She neither asked me to stop nor made any motions to that effect. I would have gladly stopped at any time she wanted, as I did not want to make her feel uncomfortable. \The next morning when I had asked her if she enjoyed the previous night, hoping that if she had she may go out with me on a date, she gave me a confused look. I did not want to press the issue, so I kissed her goodbye, and told her I would call her later.\ - Sex11ai relations ue often a confusing issue. Time ana again, the physical desires or reactions of the body are in direct confrontation witb mental decisions and moral' beliefs. Compounding this conflict ·can be any number of outside issues: peer pressure, fear of offending or hurting the partner, a basic .confusion about one's own proper sexual agenda. The above situation,. ~hich happens with regularity, Illustrates the .problems faced both by men and women. In a society where sexuality and sexual acts are accepted, who can draw the line defining forced rape in situations similar to the above, and where should that line be drawn. Here are a few basic suggestions. First, alcohol and sex make deadly companions. Alcohol and other drugs lower inhibition levels, so sexual acts that may be unthinkable or unperfmmablc while sober can become a reality when drunk. Alcohol also lowers the ability to clearly reason with ourselves and ol.hers. Second, if an incident was performed while under the influence of alcohol, both the man's and tile woman's memory of the event will be different, and unclcarly defined. It will do no good to either party to make accusations unless aU the facts can be logicaUy and unbiasedly examined. The facts are seldom clear whenever alcohol is involved. My suggestions are fairly simple and effective. We all must come to terms with our own bodies. We must know what we are capable and willing to do, and how we wiU morally feel afterwards. If you love having sex, but feel guilty afterwards, maybe you are not fully ready to accept the responsibilities of a sexual relationship. We must also realize tile effects that alcohol and other drugs will have upon our better judgment, and be willing to accept the consequences if we forfeit our better judgment while und~ r Lhe influence. If these conseqtJt'Jtccs cannot be accepted, maybe alcohol and drugs should nul be a part of our lives at this point. Sex is a real and tangible object, but too often our acceptance and understanding of our own sexuality is ambiguous. Until we each have an understanding of our own sexuality, it w0uld be best if we abstain totally, and save each other false accusations and unneeded emotional liauma. The Importance Of A Brew sky by Betsy Rothstein Concordiensis Staff Picture a barroom - hot, humid. Air thick with a haze of smoke. Crowded, wall to wall, jam-packed with beer drinking college students. In this mad scene I find myself stuffed into a circular booth with ten other people. To my right~ an annoying guy keeps asking me why my \brewsky\ is not finished. I wanted to scream in his face and tell him to get away, and yet for the time being I was forced to be slammed against him for the evening while he drank, consumed, inhaled and \pounded his brewskys.\ This guy was unbelievable - one of those people who stereotypically depict California: \dude\ this, \dude\ that. \Uh oh, dude\ he says to me every five or ten minutes. \I still see half your brewsky left ... \ what a nightmare! I thought I was going to be sick. . I finally came to the point where I could not take him any more, so I slipped underneath the table and made my exit out of the bar. That guy was only after one thing ... well, maybe two things: My\brewsky\ and his\brewsky.\ He probably was not one of the most intriguing or enlightening people I had ever met.I did not care how . much he drank. It did not matter to me if he got completely smashed, fell on his face (this woultlllave been funny, actually), and started dancing with a lamp-shade on his head (the sign of a true party animal). I just did not appreciate how be invaded my space and placed so much _ importance on the completion of my \brewsky.\ Okay, so maybe this guy is unique and I should forget aboLJt him and just chalk him up as a complete and total moron of life. Or. maybe there is some similarity between th:is \dude\ and the ]')eople on this campus. When ycu go out for an evening llere at Union College why is it that if you decide not to drink or just to drink casually, people are on your case all11ight? Many times you will be at a party and suddenly you hear the word \CHUG\ being growled throughout the barroom. Althoug!J. this word is in fact someone's last name, I am not referring to a name. As you look around the room you watch in horror as all those expert, party animal, beer-drinking maniacs take a step back from their friends (I know, t!J.is may be difficult for some of you) alld resume Standard Chugging Position. For you ncvices out tbere, and for those of you who want to get any-where in 1 ife, this consists of firmly planting your feet in the beer sludge (bigh quality) barroom floor, twisting one hand around the cup until' it can twist no more, while the other hand is flung high into the air to stabilize and to signal to everyone in the room that you are a chugger. The cup is then crushed ever so slightly and hence the beer is launched down into the gullet (whatever that is) in 2.2 seconds. A few freshmen look on in admiration. A few uptight people look on in disgust. The beer usually ends up on tho chugger's face or worse, trickling down the face off the chin. In certain instances the beer becomes embedded in one of those new goatees (the latest craze here at Union College). The chugger looks really attractive at this point. The beer then proceeds to drip onto his/her brand new cowboy boots (a staple produce of Joe or Joanna Randoms' wardrobe). If you do go out and decide not to drink it is almost easier to carry a beer around so people will leave you alone about your \brewskys.\ But then· again, why should you have to? It is difficult to go out and not to consume because you cannot han<il.e people knocking into you, spilling beer on you and the noise (all of which you do not seem to notice when you have inhaled ten beers in 22 seconds) . Unless this man you f.ell in love with is a forty-yea..r old student in one of yo11r classes, this may be a profess()t. It is understandable that yo11 keep your homosexuality <]Uiet on this campus, but you sbe>uld not feel like you are ai:lone. Statistically, 10% .of the population is hom()s;eJ(ual, which means that there are many people like )'011 out there, only no one k:no~s; who they are because the:y l1a\'e the same fears that you lla. ve. I think you have to try,. as hard as it may seem, to step Dllt of your situation and to look at it realisticallly and obje~ti\Vely. If you think about it, the rnan DRUNK DRIVING KILLS

CONCORDIENSI$ •FEBRUARY 13, 1992 • PAGE 8 Oil And Water While nu . .:ny members of the college community complain that the i11tellectual fervor at Union is lacking, it is clear that the ins tittJtion_ does indeed have a lot to offer its students in the realm ()f ideas. Thus, the problem by no means lies with the sc:ho ()[. Rather, the existent gripes are pureiy self- inflictei.. · Perhaps the problem lies with the student body, comprised primarily ·Of individuals concerned eKclusively with their grades. M6st do not even contemplate taking a course with a challenging professor let alone a cours.e outside a student's field of expertise. Yet, it is even more disturbing that discussions between students tend to revolve around any subject that is not at all political, ideological, or thought- In shJ)lt,. Union College employs a wealth of very intelligent and talemtced professors, individuals who have a great deal to offer ta tlleir ~tudents and to the general academic atmosphere of the scb()()l, Moreover, the variety of courses and the types of progn:.ms offered for a school of this size are truly remarkable. Unfortunately, most students spend more time con1pl~ini:ng about the negative in these realities than taking advantage oftllem. provoking in nature. · If students want an intellectual challenge, he/she must seek it out. Expctnding one's mind is an individual activity, not one vicariously instilled. Furthermore, the task is not a difficult one to achieve. Accordingly, it is about time that students begin to take advantage of the opportunities around them at Union College. After all, enriching oneself intellectually, makes for a fulfilling environment for an. THE VISION BEHIND THE PUB Blood Drive Successful To the E<Jito.-: This letter hll.s o11e purpose, to clarify tbe: visioa behind the opening of lllil ~n-c~rnpus pub. As envisio.ne(j by tile Student Forum this c:arnp11s pub will be: a c~n1r:al ize<l venue for college a,cl!ivi ties; a com- fortable place where administr!ltors~ faculty and students ca:JI irlterac.t; and, most important, ih legi tilllate social alternative f(Jlr st.ude:.nlS. Many stutle11t. activities such as Monda)'<' 11ight f.ootball and Cabaret are n<lt well attended because Lher are llidllen in the upper le-vels ()f tile College Center. Thiis pit!b \Viii provide a visible and CqJnsistellt venue for activities Lo Lake place. As a result, stu.;lellt atttendance at these evell t!; sllould increase. The oppor1lln ity for those of legal dridldog age- to have a drink at thes.e even ts will also increase atte11da:nce-. :Entertain- ment, n<Jt a.lcoboL, is the intended focUis &f the ;pub. Another ·V'ision llellind this campus p ull is to increase \Your stuftf rhas stuff in it that doesn't !JIIilte fit into the stuff we're doing riglat n~w .\ interaction among adminis- trators, faculty and students. At Union, there are few opportunities for social interaction among these groups. This; pub will provide a legal location at which everyone can enjoy a drink and/or enjoy the entertainment provided. Perhaps increasing social interaction between the students and the administration and faculty will foster a mutual understanding of their varying viewpoints. Finally, th.is pub will serve as an alternative to the sticky floors, plastic cups, and loud music characteristic of Union's existing social scene. Do not misunderstand. Kelly's, Rupsie's and Fraternities are supported by students and serve an important role in Union's social life. However. students .should bu_e legitimate alternatives. The pub will serve good beer (i~e. Bass, Killians) and wine in glasses. Either a full or a limited menu will be offered by dining services depending 011 the location of the pub. Comfortable chairs, tables and couches will be prcvided to enhance an atrnosphere conducive to conversation. If implemented properly, this pub will offer a social opportunity that has not existed at Union College for many years. There is one major area of contention, the issue of age. In order for this pub to be successful students of all ages mtist have access. However, administrators are realistically wonied about false identification and legal drinkers buying alcohol for illegal drinkers. A decision on this issue is pending.

It could be made much easier and organized by i~mp[ementing programs which are used at many colleges and universities.

The card could then be used in the same way as a credit card. could be the same as his telephone authorization code. This would allow telephone charges to be included on the main bill.

The bills for the various purchases would all com.e at once.

The school's various billing systems could be unified into one more efficient one. The system would be much easier for siudent who, instead of getting cash for every small purchase, would be able to charge his purchases and pay in bulk. The school should look into installing a network such as this and modernize Union's way of going about its daily activities. . · . . .. ·· . . · · ·· · · .·. .· . . ·. . · · .. · .· · · •· ·. • · .. liE~~ Ell Iii .

CONCORDIENSIS • FEBRUARY 13, 1992 • PAGE 10 The Not So Miserable Ones by Jule Medow Arts Editor A few weeks ago, I went to New York City to see Le s Mise rabies for tlle second tiiiie. Now knowing the story li11e and score backwards and forwards g yes, I can often lle found singing along with tile tape in my car - I was excited to see if the musical wou ld affect me in tlle same way it had four years ago. I was alro ready to tear Debbie Gibson limb from limb in her receiltJy acquired role as Eponine. You heard me correctly ... that teeny- bopper disco queen wh()'s \Electric Youth\ has been turned into a cheesy fragrance at CVS, is now starring on Broadway. And I was out f()r blood. First of all, you mu.st understand that we are dealirng with a terribly mutated cast. Not the \Original Lond()n Cast\ the \Original New York Cast\ or even the \Original Touring Cast\. No, no, the sad fact is that Broadway as a whole is hurting for quality actors in many of its older shows. On top of this, I opened the playbill to find f<lur little picc:es of paper falling out of it. For those who are not familiar with ~he significance of little pieocs of paper falling out of a playbill; it means \llh oh, there are understudies in this performance.\ This is not a good sign for a $60.00 scm and a three hour drive. Two of the main characters were playc.d by their understudies - Jea_n Valjean, the \hero\, and Fantine, the woman who dies leaving her daughter Cosette in Jean Valjean's care. By ten my fav<lrit,e escape from life (thesis, for example, which I am putting off just by doing :his article). Therefore, by ten minutes after eight, I had lost my cynical edge, and was beginning to actually enjoy what was before me. Jean Valjean was adequately playing his role, and Fantine was actually pretty good. O.K., I thought, there are three tests yet to come: 24601 (explanation to follow), Debbie's singing and acting. and - very important - how hot Marius would be. \24601\ is Jean Valjean's prison number, and his hidden identity become's attached with it. At a crucial moment in Les Miserables, at the end of a song called \Who am I?\ Jean Val jean rips open his shirt and sings \Who am I? 24601! \ hitting an incredibly strong falsetto note in the process. It is truly inspirational. But J.C. Sheets, understudy for Mark McKerracher, did not come anywhere near that perfect sound. He stayed low. He wimped out. When Deb carne out on stage, I poked my clueless friend on the arm (don't you hate when people do that to you?) and whispered \there she is, in the rags.\ \Oh he said. \OH???\ This is the woman who can make or break the minutes to curtain time, I was in a very bad mood. I tried to hide my agitation, to little avail, from my pretty clueless companion (\Wow! I've never been to a Broadway show! This is going to be awesome!\). Not, I was thinking, definitely NOT. I love the theater. It does something magical for me; it's TERRY LEE DILL Architectural Sculpture Maquettes Drawings -Sh()w in 3rd :tloor College Center Feb. 17-March 3 -Opening Monday~ February 17, 6-8 pm -Lecture in CC Auditorium, Tuesday, March 3, 2:00 pm show and he says \oh.\ She sang a few bars of stuff, and it sounded just like her. No big surprise, really. However, at the start of Act II, Eponine has her big solo entitled \On My Own\ and Debbie - I hate to admit .. was really incredible for those five minutes. I'm sure ; she was coached in order to get ' rid of some of the vibrato , (suspended notes that have a shaking quality to them) she uses for top forty songs, because her voice was even, and powerful, and very \Broadway\. As the audience began to applaud, m:y somewhat clued-in friend said \Wow.\ Exactly. From then on, L e .s Miserables kept getting better and better. It was all that I had remembered and more. Marius was definitely the kind of man I could have a crush on, and he sang wonderfully as well. The big award of the evening in my book went to Jean Valjean's foil character, Javert. Of all the actors and actresses, Richard Kinsey was the most consistent in his role as Javert; every action was believable and every song was dynamic. Javert's. suicide is one of my favorite scenes in the musical~ and Kinsey did not let me down. I think Javert is a particularly tough role to play because the audience is not on his side. Rather, the actor has to work to win us over and make us feel sympathy for him by Lhc time he plunges into the Seine. Well, that's it. I would recommend Les Miserab{ef; even though the cast is temperamental, because the book and the score are always going to be irreplaceable. Top 10 Movies , 1.

The Sculpture of Chris Duncan by Steven High Contributing Writer Chris Duncan works in wood, metal and plaster to create d,ense structures composed of the accumulation and interweaving of materials. The pieces included in this installation focus on a series of columnar works of steel and plaster. The steel armature interacts with the plaster to create a dense yet active surface; the rusting steel leaving traces of its existence in the plaster surface. It is in the process of the interaction between the disparate materials that these W()rks cross the boundaries of the physical and temporal. Over the past five years, Duncan's work has been moving towards an ever greater density and wight, as if the myriad materials in which he works axe being molded IJy external pressures into compact forms. His works of the mid 1980s were wood structures based upon an architectonic form. These huge works, oftentimes over 12' in height, appeared held in a tenuous balance., precariously awaiting the force of gravity to tear them down. As he ltas shifted into welded steel, Duncan's forms have condensed to fonn compact interweavings of steel and plaster. Where in the earlier work a feeling of expansion penneated the sculpture, these more recent pieces contain a great solidity and weight, bolh actual and visual. Duncan is ;quite vocal about his own work, too. \The series of sculptures in the exhibit represent a consolidation of several tendencies in my work. On one hand, they are dense and solid; on the other, open and linear. They represent one urge towards abstraction, and another, not towards representation, but association and presence. They may suggest qualities one associates with the body: gesture, stance, balance, weight. They are intended to occupy the same space that we do. \I use a variety of making processes including welding, plaster casting. and carving, and wood construction. The materials and processes themselves often speak through the finished work. I'm more interested in revealing this process of making than in highly resolved forms and surfaces.\ His pieces will only be displayed for a little while longer, so if you haven't seen these masterworks, you'd better huny. Emerson String Quartet To· Make Appearance The Emerson String Quartet, the winner of two Grammy Awards, will perform music by Mozart, Bach, Haydn, Rihm and Pvorak on Sunday, Feb. 23, in Union College's Memorial Chapel for the Schenectady Museum-Union College concert series.

This day can be defirre(( as \Violent \Vile :and \Vulgar but I suppose [l(]rr all intensive purposes let's just say \Valentine's Day.\ I .had trouble coming up with :a saory this week so I could nollat·V'oid this topic (sorry). I meam we are constantly reminded of1llis day (lhe only mail I h;ave received in the past we,ek has been advertisements :£rom· florists). I'm not sure VNbeiL I had the revelation that thi:s oday would haunt me for the ms1 of my life - I suppose it v.vas something that happene<l in my childhood - somewhal of a traumatic experience. It was back in '73, nursery school, a time where boys were boys and girls were girls and neither knew the difference. No I don't think this is the event. It was back in '82, junior high, a time where boys were boys and girls were girls and both knew the difference. The big Valentine's party at Jennifer Muccioloi 's was that night - a party where people's reputations were established or abolished. All my friends had bought the newest pair of designer jeans to squeeze into and I didn't have a \Valentine.\ Peggy Bloom had Tom Andruzzi, Cathy Ferrero had Joe Castle, Cindy Daley had J.P. LaScala, Sherry Levin had Twain Brenden and everyone had Daniel Strauss. But I had no one - well, no one that I wanted. Matthew P. Delaney asked me to be his valentine, he slipped a Twix bar into my cubby with a note attached asking me \to be his valentine.\ J immediately threw away (ate~ tbe candy bar and ripped up tlle card. Now, don't misunderstand me, Matt Delaney was a nice boy, but he was somewhat of a nerd/geek, and I could not show up to the party with llim. However, time was runnin!5 out and I had only a few hours to remedy the situation. I avoided Matt for a good par:t of the day but eventually he cornered me. I remember the conversation to this day: Matt: Hi! Me: Hi! Matt: How are you? Me: Fine. Matt: Did you watch \Eight is Enough\ last night?] Me: No! Matt: Me neither. Lipstick, Remotes a.nd Condoms by Andrew R. Ros.ell Concordiensis Stajf Underneath your s«Jlfa, a plethora of treasures tlho11ght lost sit quietly, aWia iting discovery on the last da~of the term. We all lose things:. I'm not talking about tn<DILe y, virgirlity and those permanently gone, alth()ugh my good friend and smltry sophomore peeress, Debor:ah E. Mcinerney calmly stateal,. \'It's annoying when you lose: lots of money because S<Jllll ecme else is apt to find it.\ I'll agJ\ee.

Some ot Lb.ese losses can ignite a c:h a in reaction,leading to that lfpncal Winter Term day while 6Jtlners result in calm substillu ti on. Many wonder how our rot.her shoe mysteriously ma·d~ its way on top of the televisiron or outside, etc ... We're rnl'W:ays interested in the how,. -why, who and where of the sit11ation. Some of us have the dene.ctive skills necessary for s.u10h a thing. Jason Habinsky, w~ted \handsomest man im the business\ by a Riciiumond survey, remembered back:: to the Brady Bunch, saying, \It \tN'!lS tiger who stole Bob!)y's Kazoo.\ Age is no bmnjer. Under my bed at home lie lliigh school mysteries I never really knew existed. Fresh n.a n to parents admit to suffering th osc \lost\ spells. My own rnroLhcr reiterates, saying, \I nevecrlose anything, except my rnjlld.\ That's okay, I can stil'l .sary I love my mother. I'll begin my analysis Yith the women. Due to my c:ut:r.ent gender and my relentless pursuit for accuracy and acuity, I was forced to evoke the expert tutelage of some female friends. First on the list of major disappearances are the . backs of earrings. As one young woman said, \You always have to pull off the backs of [another] earring because the ones you really want to wear don't have them. That's real annoying.\ I'm led to ask one question: if this course of action were to continue in its apparently endless cycle, what happens when you've lost the last back? A practice exists where the back of an earring is removed and, I'll assume, placed on a nightstand or table while the earring is carefully removed. Forgetting to piece the jewel back together (or for any other reason) the back is left to fade into the night, never to be seen again. The next day, when earrings are to be employed anew, the backs from other earrings are removed only to be lost later that day by aforementioned means. Where do they go? Maybe there's a kleptomaniac living in West with approximately 3,211 earring backs (the odd number shows that even the klepto couldn't find one of the backings). Lipstick appears to be a second loss experienced by over half the female population. Again, I'm no expert, but according to Ms. Laurie L. Googel, sitting courageously upon a soiled milk crate, that tube of moisturizing tinge has its way of frequently disappearing. As she so earnestly stated, \Lipstick lipstick, lipstick, Andy! Girls always lose lipstick.\ Pretty concise, huh? Moving on to the men, I speak quite a bit more from experience. I like to keep change in my pocket (as opposed to a woman's purse). However, every time I get into a car, I seem to lose some of that money to the seat. If I were to walk from this keyboard to my car right now, I could ,probably extract anywhere between six to eight quarters, f0ur to five nickels and, if I'm .lucky, a dime from the innards of my driver seat; maybe m()Je, maybe less. Couches, to a certain extent, can fall int~ the same category as well but,. as I'll discuss later, couches ~uch back many things. I always find it difficult to locate my other shoe. My bedroom's not a massively chaotic muddle, but my roommate and I have been known throughout the term to allow vati<>us articles of clothing and papers to accumulate on the floor. The most frustrating repercussion of such a mess is not that look (for neither my roommate or myself fincJ it that bad) but the \smoke screen\ effect. The other night I needed to go up campus for a meeting. Barring any geographical slurs, it was a typical Se:l1enectady winter night: col<l, windy, wet and slushy. I \A'anted to wear my boots. Tbe left boot was in plain sight. It was ten minutes before I gue up the search for my right one. I went to that meeting with cold feet and rc~umed mly to find that boot like a waif in my bedroom under an apparently unchecked chair. Of C()urse, it was also shadowed by two t-shirts and a midtenn. For both sexes, we have our idiosyncrasies. After long, diligent research? I decided that one losing ailment strikes Me: Well. .I have to ... Matt: Did you get the Twi.x? Me: Yeah sort of ... Matt: and ... ? Me: I'm sorry bat I can't go with you. I already have someone t() go with! Matt: O.K., bye. I thought it was beatter to come down with some illness than to show up with Matthew. 'Dil::1t night I decided to indulge my depression with some ice cream. I walked to the \Friendly's\ around the corner and I ordered a \Reeses peanut butter cup\ sundae. I sat down at the counter and sitting right across from me was Matthew eating a \Reeses peanut butter cup\ sundae. We tried to avoid eye contact but eventually there would be a confrontation. I finally went up to him with my sundae and sat d()wn beside him. I think we went through everyone. I'm lazy when it comes to television. Remote control has its way of attracting television l()Ver~ to rooms of ultimate inconvenience. There is a price, however. Every remote control on this campus will disappear at least once or it isn't a real remote cont:Jol. Period. Be it in the couch, under the couch, in a bed, behind a bed or even in another room, that box will find a way to walk. Don't try to prevent it or rectify it. Accept it, because it's going to happen. If the remote doesn't work, however. you'.re probably safe. Also, how many times preceding coitus have you been unable t(} find that box of cond()ms yo11 SWORE were behind the shampoo, on your second shelf, IJehind the white mug, etc ... At least they don't make remote control condoms. Then again ... Albeit brief, the list of loss is but an example of a greater scheme. Everybody loses things and h<>w we react to that loss often links the pettiness of the loss to the importance of three sundaes and a plate of fries that night - he actually was not all th.at bad. The party had turned {JUt to be a flop - Peggy and 1'()rn broke up and Tom liked Cathy so she broke up with Joe and Cindy felt left out so she dumped J.P. and I think J.P. i~ now with Daniel! The last tiling I heard about Matt was that he went to Princeton and is, well, let's just say looks like Tom Cruise. I doll't think that there is any pr<JfDtmd message in this story (at least nothing that youhaven'talready experienced on \The W()nder Years\) but as a good frie11d of mine recently spat out - \Valentine's Day is only important to those without S()meone,\ - She's probably wr()ng but I'd like to believe that there is an element of truth to it! the object. 'To one individual, the loss of an earring back may result in the casual replacement with another backing or a switch to a different pair of earrings. T(} another, it could be the devastating omen of a first date or formal. Unfortunately. the condoms may not matter to many people. Diff~rent objects carry different vatue and the fact that these objects are given value is pretty indicative of us as members of western society. Emotions are lost just as easy as a remote c:ontrol, often just as mysteri()usly and many times going 11nfound. A remote control=emoti()ns? I hope not. Guys, get a wallet that holds your change aad keep all your shoes in a box. Girls, don't buy earrings with backs or find the klepto wbo probably has them. In ge11eral, take a light hearted approach to loss. I think the great one, David Stark, said it best: \I don't hate losing thillgs, I just love giving things away.\ And so \Starky's Law\ shall become my religion. l\.1aybe. TAKE DRUGS AND LQSE YOUR FRIENDS. If you t.lUnli drugs cost a lot now, wait ltlltil after college. They could cost you a career. Last yea.r alone, America's businesses lost more than S60 billion to drugs. So this year, most of the FortlUle 500 will be administering drug tests. Failing the test means you won't be considered for employment. A.nd that's o11e hell of a price to pay.

CONCORD!ENSIS • FEBRUARY 13, 1992 • PAGE 12 '~es, fJ\omorrow is o/a[entine 's 1Jay ani I am sorry to bring it up ani tliis is starting to sauna [ik:g, an 'Jllniy 9\psen I title II by Sari B. Skolnik Features Editor I'm sorry to bring this up but tom()rrow is l) Friday 2) February 14 and 3) \V\ Day. This day can be defined as \Violcn t,\ \Vile and \Vulgar but I suppose for all intensive purposes let's just say \Valentine's Day.\ I had trouble coming up with a story this week: so I could not avoid this topic (sorry). I mean we arc constantly reminded of this day (the only mail I have received in the past week has been aclvcrtiscments from florists). I'm not sure when I had the revelation that this day would haunt me for the rest of my life - I suppose it was something that happened in my childhood - somewhat of a traumatic experience. It was back in '73, nursery school, a time where boys were boys and girls were girls and neither knew the difference. No I don't think this is the event. IL was back in '82, junior high, a time where boys were boys and g iris were girls arud both knew the difference. The big Valentine's party at Jennifer Muccioioi's was that night - a party where petOple's reputations were established or abolished. All my friends had bought the newest pair of designer jeans to squee:ze into and I didn't have a \Valentine.\ Peggy Bloom had Tom Andmzzi, Cathy Ferrcm had Joe Castle, Cindy Daley had J.P. LaScala, Sherry Levin had Twain Brenden and everyone had Daniel Strauss. But. I had no one - well, no one that I wanted. Matthew P. Doelaney asked me to be his valentine, he slipped a Twix bar into my cubby with a n<Jte attached asking me \to be his valentine_\ I immc<:liately threw away (ate) the candy bar and ripped up the card. Now, don't misunderstand me, Matt Delaney was a nice boy, but he was somewhat of a nerd/geek, and I could not show up to the party with him. However, time was running out and I had only a few hours to remedy the situation. I avoided Matt for a good part of the day but eventually he cornered me. I remember the conversation to this day: Matt: Hi! Me: Hi! Matt: How are you? Me: Fine. Matt: Did you watch \Eight is Enough\ last night?] Me: No! Matt: Me neither. Lipstiek, Remotes and Condoms by Andrew R. Rosen Concordiensis Staff Underneath your sofa, a plethora of treasures thought lost sit quietly, awaiting discovery on the last day of the term. We all lose things. I'm not talking about money, virginity and those permanently gone, although my good friend and s11ltry sophomore peeress, Deborah E. Mcinerney calmly stated, \It's annoying when you lose lots of money because someone else is apt to find it.\ I'll agree_ I make reference to those \misplaced\ articles we so desperately need at one time or another but fail to conjure up; those objects not always lost, but suffering an untimely disappearance. Some of these losses can ignite a chain reaction, leading to that typical Winter Term day while others result in calm substitution_ Many wonder how our other shoe my stcriously made its way on top of the television or outside, etc ... We're always interested in the how, why, who and where of the situation. Some of us have the detective skills necessary for such a thing. Jason Habinsky, voted \handsomest man in the business\ by a Richmond survey, remembered back to the Brady Bunch, saying, \It w:~s tiger who stole Bobby's Kazoo.\ Age is no barrier. Under my bed at home lie high school m)'Stcrics I never really knew ex istcd. Freshman •o parents admit to suffering those \lost\ spells. My own mother reiterates,. saying, \I never lose anything .. except my mind.\ That's okay, I can still say ! love my mother. I'll begin my analysis with the women. Due to my current gender and my relentless pursuit for accuracy and acuity, I was forced to evoke the e.xpcrt tutelage of some female friends. First on the fist of major disappearances are the backs of earrings. As one young woman said, \You always have to pull off the backs of [another] earring because the ones you really want to wear don't have them. That's real annoying.\ I'm led to ask one question: i:f this course of action were to continue in its apparently endless cycle, what hatppcns when you've lost the last back? A practice exists where the back ()f an earring is removed and, I' II assume, placed on a nightstand or table whi lc the earring is carefully removed. Forgetting to piece the jewel back together (or for any other reason) the back is left tt0 fade into the night, never to bee seen again. The next day, when earrings are to be employed anew, the backs from other earrings are removed onl:::r to be lost later that day by aforementioned means. Where do they go? Maybe there's a kleptomaniac living in West with approximately 3.211 earring backs (the odd number shows that even the lklcpto couldn't find one olf the backings). Lips tick appears to be a second loss experienced by over half the female population. Again. I'm no expert, but according to Ms. Lauric L. Googd, sitting courageously upon a soiled milk crate, that tuhe of moisturizing tinge has its way of frequcmly disappearing. As shoe so earnestly stated, \Lipstick lipsticlc, lipstick, Andy! Girls always lose lipstick.\ Pretty concise, huh? Moving on to the me11, I speak quite a bit more from experience. I like to keep change in my pocket (as opposed to a woman's purse). However, every time I get into a car, I seem to lo-se some of that money to the seat. If r were to walk from this keyboard to my car right now, I could probably extract anywhere between six to eight quarters, four to five nickels and, if I'm lucky, a dime from the innards of my rlriver seat; maybe more, maybe less. Couches, to a certain extent, can fall into the same category as well but, as I'll discuss later. couches such back many things. I always find it difficult to locate my other shoe. My bedroom's not a massively chaotic muddle, but my roommate and I have been known throughout the term to allow various articles of clothing and papers to accumulate on the floor. The most frustrating repercussion of such a mess is not that look (for neither my rocrnmate or myself find it that bad) but the \smoke screen\ effect. The other night I needed to go up campus for a meeting. Barring any geographical slurs, it was a typical Schenectady winter night: cold, windy, wet and slushy. I wanted to wear my boots. The left boot was in plain sight. It was ten minutes before I gave up the search for my right one. I went to that meeting with cold feet and returned only to find that boot like a waif in my bedroom under an apparently unchecked chair. Of course, it was also shadowed by two t-shirts and a midterm. For both sexes, we have our idiosyncrasies. After long, diligent research. I decided that one losing ailment strikes Me: Well...l have to ... Matt: Did you get the Twix? Me: Yeah sort of... Matt: and ... ? Me: I'm sorry but I can't go with you. I already have someone to go with! Matt: O.K., bye. I thought it was beatter to come down with some illness than to show up with Matthew. Th!lt night I decided to indulge my depressioa with some ice cream. I walked to the \Friendly's\ around the corner and I ordered a \Reeses peanut butter cup\ sundae. I sat down at the counter and sitting right across from me was Matthew eating a \Reeses peanut butter cup\ sundae_ We tried to avoid eye contact but eventually there would be a confrontation. I finally went up to him with my sundae and sat down beside him. I think we went through everyone. I'm lazy when it comes to television. Remote control has its way of attracting television lovers_ to rooms of ultimate inconvenience. There is a price, however. Every remote control on this campus will disappear at least once or it isn't a real remote control. Period. Be it in the couch, under the couch, in a bed, behind a bed or even in another room, that box will find a way to walk. Don't try to prevent it or rectify it. Accept it, because it's going to happen. If the remote doesn't work, however, you're probably safe. Also, how many times preceding coitus have you been unable to find that box of condoms you SWORE were behind the shampoo, on your second shelf, behind the white mug, etc ... At least they don't make remote control condoms. Then again ... Albeit brief, the list of loss is but an example of a greater scheme. Everybody loses things and how we react to that loss often links the pettiness of the loss to the importance of three sundaes and a plate of fries that night - he actually \Was not all that bad. The party had turned out to be a flop - Peggy and Tom broke up and Tom liked Cathy so she broke up with Joe and Cindy felt left <Jut so she dumped J.P. and I think J.P. is now with Daniel! The last thing I heard about Matt was that he went to Princeton and is, well, let's just say looks like Tom Cruise. I don't think that there is any profound message in this story (at least nothing that you haven't already experienced <Jn \The Wonder Years\) but as a good friend of mine recenUy spat out - \Valentine's Day is <mly important to those 'Without someone,\ - She's probably wrong but I'd like to believe that there is an element ()[truth to it! the object. To one individLial, the loss of an earring back may result in the casual replacement with another backing or a switch to a different pair of earrings. To another, it could be the devastating omen of a first date or formal. Unfortunately, the condoms rnay not matter to many people. Different objects carry different value and the fact that these objects are given value is pretty indicative of us as members of western society. Emotions arc lost just as easy as a remote control, often just as mysteriously and many times going unfound. A remote control=emotions? I hope not. Guys, get a wallet that holds your change and keep all your shoes in a box. Girls, don't buy earrings with backs or find the klepto who probably has them. In general, take a light hearted approach to loss. I think the great one, David Stark, said it best: \I don't hate losing things, I just love giving things away.\ And so '\Starky's Law\ shall become my religion. Maybe. TAKE DRUGS AND LQSE YOUR FRIENDS. If you think drugs cost a lot now, wait until after college_ They could cost you a career. Last year alone, America's businesses lost more than S60 billion to drugs. So this year, most of the Fortune 500 will be administering drug tests. Failing the test means you won't be considered for employment. .1\.nd that's one hell of a price to pay. ~ ; i I !i ' 'i , I r 1 :' I, ; I 1 I' , I '' I' I j I,

Wo111en' s Basketball by Sports Staff The women's basketball team finished off a tough stretch in their schedule this past week with two losses and a win. Their record now stands at 10-8 with five games remaining. This 10-win mark already surpasses their win total for last season. The Lady Dutchmen's performance in these last five games will determine whether or not post- season play is in Union's future. On Wednesday, February 5, Union squared off against a tough club from Middlebury. Union lost 92-65 as they let the game slip away in the second half. For most of the first half, Union stuck with their game plan as they slowed down the pace to a half-court offense. However, in the second half, Union's systems began to break down. This, coupled with the outstanding play of Middlebury's Yugoslavian exchange student, S. Kovijanic, proved to be too much for the Dutchmen squad. Kovijanic had 38 points on the night with an incredible 30 coming in the second half. Some bright spots for Union were the play of Robin Romer and Michelle Kleinhans. Romer put in 21 points while Kleinhans added 15 of her own. Kleinhans has become more offensive-minded as she is rounding out all aspects of her game. Andrea Pagnozzi scored 14 with her solid play. This past weekend, Union traveled to Skidmore to compete in the Skidmore Invitati1onal. The Lady Dutchmen split games to earn a third place finish with a 76- 59 loss to Norwich in the first contest and a 65-48 victory over Colby Sawyer in the second match. The score in the Norwich game is not indicative of Union's level of play as a late surge by Norwich seemed to lopside the score. Union shot a disma:l 29% in the first half while only raising their second half shooting percentage to 34. Romer led the way with 20 points and 11 rebounds while Pagnoz:zi added 19 points. Jean Lopata provided some strong play on the boards with her 12 rebounds. The Colby Sawyer game was a nice break for Union as they allowed each team member to score, three in double figures, in a 65-48 win. Romer had 19, Pagnozz:i put in 14, while Lopata finished up with 10. Tough defense at the start combined with a continuous rotation of players enabled Union to retain control throughout all stages of the game. Kate Alquist had a good game off the bench while Wendy Getty provided much versatility as she switched from both wing and post. Although many of the remaining games look to be tough. Union is confident about their prospects. With their current level of intensity, look for Union to make a serious run at a post-season bid. 7 BEDROOM HOUSE Avallable for 92-93 • Large bedrooms • 2 modern bathrooms ·Large kitchen ·All appliances ·Washer & dryer ·Large deck • Alarm system • 700 South Avenue Call 370·5498 leave message Letter to the Sports Editor A hush fell over tile crowd as the announcer said, \Swimmers take your mark.\ The silence is almost unbearable as I bend down and clutch the end of lhe block.

Support Union Sports chach alk by John Schachnovsky Associate Sports Editor This p.ast week the sports world became the main spotlight, not only on sportsca.sts, but on the newscasts as well. In the past week the sports world has been rocked by news of triumph and sorrow. Putting the events that have recently transpired into perspective is a sign of how the sports: world is not immune to the problems of the real world. If Magic Johnson turned the sports world upside down when he announced he had contracted the AIDS virus, he turned it right-side up when he stepped onto the floor at the All-Star game this past Sunday in Orlando. Magic dominated the game, ending it as the leading scorer and it's MVP. He scored 25 points in his 29 minutes of playing time. The fairy tale could fl()t have been better written ill Hollywood. The ill- struck staT promised the world he would make his mark in Orlando, but even Magic himself could not have imagined the storybook ending to the game. As the game was winding down Magic found himself in two familiar situations. First, he was left alone defending Isiah Thomas. After giving a dribbling exhibition. Isiah put up a pathetic e:xcuse for a shot, only reassuring the dominant force that Magic Joh11:son is to the NBA. A few trips later, Magic saw Michael Jordan in the same position Isiah was in. The result was the same as before, as the shot hit the front of the rim, the crowd showed their love for Magic with a standing ovation .. .It was truly a great moment for the sports world. This past Monday night the same sports world that Magic engulfed in pride, was rocked again by the verdict in the rape trial of Mike Tyson. After the trial that lasted over two weeks, the jury deliberated for only 9 and a half hours before announcing the guilty verdict. I will not bore you with my speculations of how many 1 years he will get, or what will ·happen after he is released from prison. What I will say is that life for sports athletes has taken a sharp turn. Gone are the days of little boys looking at athletes as role models only by their athleticism. With the news about Steve Howe's ever increasing drug problems, and the Pete Rose scandal still looming in the not too distant past, the Mike Tyson situation only reassures the times that rock the world these days arc not only bright. The sports world is slowly learning that it is not oblivious to problems that usually keep their distance.

Their record now stands at 7-10 as they have 8 games remaining in the season. Only three of those games are home contests while they must play some tougl1 opponents on the road in the other five games. The team is still feeling the loss of guard Steve Evans who was lost earlier this season. Luther WinJield has shouldered most of the load playing 32.1 minutes and dishing out 4.1 assists a game. Evans' 10.0 points per game has been harder to replace although both Jamie Donigan and Greg Quirolo have started and had big games in the scoring colum11. Quir()lo had one Qf those games last Tuesday against Hobart- He scored 18 points off the be11ch on perfect 8 for 8 shooting. Greg Dolan led the team with 20 points while Ken Evans added 16.

Hobart's Mike Kiefer came alive scoring 9 consecutive points for the Statesmen while the Dutchmen wer.e held to only 6 more first half points. Hobart cut the lead tc 12 at 36- 24 before intermission. Hobart came out strong in the sec{)nd half with Kiefer scoring 8 points in the first five minutes. Following a Kiefer dunk at 15:06 the Statesmen had cut the lead to 6 at 43-37. Union then answered with a 9-0 run of its own including 8 points from Ken Evans to go up 52-37. Hobart could never get closer than 9 points the rest of tile game as the Dutchmen finished the game with a 78-65 victory to raise their record to 7-9. Despite a 30 point perfonnance from Mike Kiefer Hobart dropped to 4-11. Aside from Union's top scorers Luther Winfield turned in an 8 assist performance while playing 39 of 40 minutes. On Saturday Union traveled to Syracuse to play Division II Le Moyne. Le Moyne was 10- 11 on the season but was a very well balanced team with six players averaging between 9.5 and 13.2 points per game. The Dolphins jumped right out to a 10 point lead going up 14- 4 and prompting a Union timeout. Le M()yne then proceeded to hit 5 consecutive 3-pointers to make Union's scoring efforts meaningless.

Sollinger Concordiensis Staff Whiteface Mountain in Lake .Placid was the sight of the fourth Carnival race of the season for the Union College Men's and Women's Ski Team. The race, which was hosted by N()rth Country Community C()llege and Paul Smith College, proved to be very vivotal in both teams quest to q 11alify for the Eastern Regional Championships at Waterville Valley later in the month. The women mathematically clinched a trip to tile Eastern Championships by placing third in the weekend meet. The men, coming off two sub-par performances, turned in their best race of the season by placing second for the entire weekend. This almost assures the Boardmen of their ftrst trip to the Eastern's sin<:e 1988. Rookie Liz Landa continued to ski consistent and fast as she placed first for Union and second on the course in the slalom on Saturday. Classmate Brianna Patnode turned in the best performance of her young career by placing second for the D111chwomen and fifth overall. Unfortunately, Captain Beth Fo1ey and sophomore Nicole Zarnansky fell victim to the ice and steepness of the Parkway trail and thus did not finish the race. On the men's side, Junior Sean Livingston, who seems to llave regained his top racing form, placed first for the D11tchmen and seventh overall ()D the course. Rookie Jeremy Denise, back from the the di,.ablcd list, fnllowcd close behind Livingston, by placing eighth on the entire course. Freshman Brooks Glahn turned in another top ten slalom finish and placed third for the team. Junior Slosh Goldberg continued to be a model of consistency in slalom, by placing folJI'th for Union and twenty-fifth overall. When asked about his incredible consistency in slalom, a discipline in which racers often fall, Slosh responded, \It's aU in the free runs that r take before the race.\ Captain Jeremy Sollinger had another roller-coaster slalom run and crashed at the end of the C{)urse. Sunday's giant slalom was highlighted by minus 30 degree weather and a broken down lift that services the race trail. However. these adt~erse conditions did not affect Landa, who pulled out all stops in her second run to grab a gold medal for the day. Sushi, a much improved g.s. skier this year, took second for Union and fourth overall. Patnode placed third for the Dutchwomen and ninth overall, while Christina Wright recorded her first top ten finish of the season and placed fourth for the team.

' ' ' VOLUME CXXI, NUMBER 13 SCHENECTADY, NEWYORK FEBRUARY 20, 1992 by David Levine Concordiensis Staff On Wednesday, February 12, civil rights lawyer Morris Dees delivered a speech on the ~importance of cultural respect, entitled \A Season for Justice\ t() a near capacity crowd in Memorial Chapel. Dees stressed the importance of ll<>noring the constitutional rig;hts of all citizens. According t<> Dees, great countries must ~e care of its weakest and po()rest citizens. 1'he 1980s saw a resurgence Df the white supremacist movement and an increase in lute crime. In the past, i11dividuals were unable to r~eive compensation from the Klan, but only from the i11dividual who committed the e1ime. Dees set a precedent by s11ing White Aryan Resistance leader Tom Metzger for i11citing skin heads to commit a. violent crime which resulted i11 ·the death of an Ethiopian st11dent in Portland. In winning tbe 12.5 million dollar suit, Dees helped to shut down the · s~cond largest Klan group in the country. There are still 346 tlistinct white supremacist groups in the United States. Dees believes that racial bias will not begin to disappear IUitil politicians and others i11 p<>wer cease to perpetuate racial ste1'eotypes for the purpose of \)enefitting their careers. Dees Cited George Bush as an e:xample of a politician who llSecl a racial stereotype to SJ!read fear among white voters <luring his advertising campaign in the election of 1988. The advertising campaign was aimed at • • • r1n 1- ac1a • • 81 0100 criticizing Micltael Dukakis' alleged softness on crime. Willie Horton, a convicted felon who had been released from prison on parole and who had soon after committed murder, was used in this campaign ad. Bush's advertising manager later admitted that the commercial was aimed at scaring white voters into voting for Bush by describing Horton, a black man .whose appearance fit all racial physical stereotypes. An even more e:xtreme case . of a politician wi11ning votes through racism was discussed by Dees. Former Klansman David Duke has gained a considerable amount of political support in Louisiana through appealing to the white voters' fear of tile increasing black population. Similarly, some minority leaders have instilled stereotypes abo11t other races into their communities. Dees illustrated this through his discussion of the Crown Heights conflict. When asked why he felt the accident occurred, one black student responded that Jews' cars were too big. This response was •mdoubtedly a result of a common misconception that all Jews are rich. Jesse Jackson attempted to whip up black support when he called New York \Heimy- Town.\ His racial slur intended to prejudice the blacks of New York against the Jews. Racial stereotypes have helped to make the debate over affirmative action more controversial. Some whites believe that affirmative action allows less ambitious blacks to benefit from a racism that occurred before they were born. They believe that the blacks use the racial oppression of their parents to their benefit. They also argue that the affirmative action program gives blacks an unfair advantage in that it gives them a guaranteed par.t of \the economic pie.\ On the other hand, some blacks do not believe that they truly have equal opportunity. To illustrate this point Dees used a Federal Reserve Board statistic that a black person with equal credentials is fifty percent less li:kely of receiving a loan than a white person. Dees believe's that the racial turmoil will build as the black JlOpulation C()ntinues to make 11p a higher aiJd higher percentage of the national population. One way of sto-pping the spread of racism is through an intense education plan that deals with cultural acceptance. Morris S. Dees, Jr. Dees is involved in Teaching Tolerance. a program which publishes and distributes magazines with teaching techniques that can more ea'>ily explain the necessity of cultural tolerance. Although Dccs believes lhal there will be a growing rifL between the races, he surmised that education can stem the rift. Dees expressed his optimism when he closed \A Season for Justice\ by elab<Jrating on a quotation by King: \One day all barrio dwellers, natives on reservations, homeless, powerless, blacks, and whites will sit around the table of brotherhood.\ The brief period of questioning that ensued gave the audience a more personal view of Morris Dces. His parents were adamant that their son be brought up in a non- racist environrnent. Dees remembers being told never to · use the word \uigger\ by his Continued on llage 2 Steinmetz Symposium Planned For April 10 by Lara Chamberl1in News Editor April 10th has been chosen as the date of Union's second a11nual Steinmetz Symposium for undergraduate \creative scholarly, and research achievement.\ Mo<leled after NCUR, a national program, the Steinmetz Symposium is a formal setting for ~tudents in all disciplines to display their work through talks. posters and e:xhibitions on the Union \:ampus. Unlike NCUR, .however, Steinmetz is not restricted to upperclassmen but encourages all students to participate. Dr. Richard Seltzer, a Union alumnus, will act as keynote speaker when he launches the event at the opening session. Concurrent talks, organized into twenty-minute sessions, will follow. Each presentation will consist of a fifteen-minute talk preceding five minutes of questions from the audience. A poster session will be held between two such presentation sessions. At this time, those in attendance may go to the arts building to view posters depicting research and data from all areas of study. In addition, engineers' working models may be seen at this time. A second presentation session will come next and the event will conclude with a banquet for presenters and their sponsors.

After watching the poor treatment that Autherine Lucy received, \all of the instincts I ever had for the unde:r:dog ·came out.\ As a by Alii Wapner Staff Writer Social anthropologist Kate Skelton spoke last Wednesday to address issues concerning women in the workplace. Skelton claimed that women face many problems achieving an education equivalent to their male counterparts and entering the job market: they encounter tensions with their male peers and are disadvantaged because of past stereotypes which deemed women as inferior to men. Skelton, a graduate of the University of Michigan and Cornell University, cited a need for a new \democratization in the workplace.\ Once women become employed, administra- tors need to instill an environment where women can participate without the threat of tension from their male co- workers. Skelton claims that it is not just the recruitment of women into corporations, but retention of these jobs that is most important today.

According to Lee Metchick, cllairman of the concert committee, the concert will be held in Memorial Chapel. Metchick stated that this conce1t is a \trial concert,\ in that it is the first of its type to be attempted. Moreover, Metcbick said that if the students respond well and adhere to the college's guidelines for use of the cliaJlel, more concerts similar to the 10,000 Maniacs will be organized. Such. guidelines are as follows: there will be no admittance to the concert withe>ut a ticket; any pushing or sh()ving during the concert will result in expulsion from the concert; no food or beverages will be allowed into Memorial Chapel; no smok:ing; remember, this is a chapel, and it must be treated as such; in other words, there wm be no standing on the pews~ dancing in the aisles, etc.; the people in the balcony cannot lean forward on the bannister; and lastly, any violation of these rules would obvie>usly result in expulsion from the concert. Metchick insisted that these rules must be followed in order for future concerts to exist at Union. Tickets will go on sale starting ncx t \.I.'CCk on a first come, first serve basis. Ticket price will be ten dollars. Metchick reiterated that the concert will be held in Memorial Chapel due to the lack of any other suitable pLace for a concert. Apparently, Achilles rink will not yet be ready to house a concert while the field house is acoustically unsound. As stated in a previous article in tb.e Conc()rdiensis, President Hull, backed by the administration, believes outdoor concerts to be too much of a liability, and unc.ontrollable. Therefore, Metcb.ick and the concert committee had to struggle to find a decent area for any co11cert. Apparently, the Memorial Chapel appears to be the <>nly acceptable place by the administration for a concert.

Wliile attending the University of Alabama he observed the integration of the school. After watching the poor treatment that Autherine Lucy received, \all of the instincts I ever had for the underdog came out.\ As a result of his leadership in the anti-klan movement, he had his office burned by the Klan in 1983, and he has had an attempt on his life. Morris Dees can be con.sidered to be one of the foremost leaders of the current civil rights 1110vement. This speech was a part of the College's Portraying America Series. h.Y Ani Wapner Staff Writer Social anthropologist Kate Skelton spoke last Wednesday to a<Ldress issues concerning womre11 in the workplace. Ske\t()n claimed that women face many problems achieving an ed11cation equivalent to their male counterparts and entering the jOlb market: they encounter tensions with their male peers and ue disadvantaged because of past stereotypes which deemed women as inferior to men. Skelton, a graduate of the University of Michigan and Cornell University, cited a need for a new \democratization in the \VOrlcplace.\ Once women become employed, administra- tors ne·~d to insti 11 an envirc:mrncnt where women can participate withmit the threat of tension from their male co- workcers. Skelton claims that it is not just the recruitment of women into corporations, but retenllion of these jobs that is most important today. Women shoul·d not have to feel isolated in a jc:Jb for which they are just as qu~ificd as men. They need to become an integral part of the working group. After holding jobs at several affirmative actions and progressive women's groups, Kate Skelton now works for UUP, a labor management committee which attempts to improve the quality of work conditions for female employees. In addition to aiding corporations in the recruitment of women in various fields, Skelton also administers a grant program for women seeking higher education.

It was then that I could see the nationali9m present in each of my friencls. Everyone was so happy when the athletes appeared .£rom their own countries. Cheers were given in hopes that their country's athlete might win the medals. There we aU sat together in unity, and everyone was in essence an~lauding for a different team. Of course we all recognized the best athletes but deep down everyone want~ to see someone from their home win. When it was announced 1that Germany had thus far received the highest medal count, one student said \Why Gerrna11y?\ One of th~ German students could only ~xclaim, \Of ,course Germany ts first-whats: the question?\ During tlte men's figure skating evellt, I faced a dilemma. M~ favorite skater was Viktor Petrenko skating for the Unifi;(d Team. I have seen him ska.te three times in person, and he left me spellbound w1tb his speed and athleticism, as well as elegance and charm, But then the American skater, Paul Wylie gave the best performance of his life. He is an excellent skater and st:ylist, and it was the biggest sh-ock to me and to most people in the skating world that he had a chance at the gold me.dal. Without a thought giv~n. my cheers plunged from Petrenko, and I so badly wanted Wylie of the United States to succeed in capturing the gold medal. I am not sure what had gotten into 111e, but I was so fired up when Wylie only took second place. Petrenki 's program was flawed on at least two jumps be had to put his hand down; Wylie's was grand right up to the last second. 'How could th;( judges rank the U.S. man.lo~Ner just because he is a lesser known athlete?', the commerttator asked. I wondered the ::;ame thing and it made me angry inside, that this sort of \politics\ had cost an American the gold medal. I took my frustrations out on the most appropriate person in the room ... a Soviet exchange student. Then during the medal ceremonies, there was an emptiness on the face of the gold medalist, a sorrow that seemed to show his loneliness. As they raised the Olympic flag for the Unified Team and played the Olympic hymn, my only thoughts turned to how sad it must be to have such an honor, and not to be able to see your own flag and to hear the echoes of your very own national anthem. My Russian friend agreed ;:vith my disparity, saying, Why those rings? It's really mean to show such a flag. \ A country that is supposed to be free now couldn't even have let its athletes choose their own song or a flag to compete under. Everything was chosen for them, and to them it really meant nothing. Imagine working hard all of your life towards such a great honor for you and for your country, only to realize that the country you have grown up in and trained under no longer exists. I think there is a liLtlc bit of nationalism in all of us. That kind of pride in one's country is especially evident at the Olympics. Sometimes we overlook this respect for our country. not realizing its importance in life. But it really should be respected for what it is worth. Americans can be pr~ud of so many things, while our neighbors across the world in the former Soviet Union have no such pride ... they have no such place to call home like Americans. The medal winners can only look up at the Olympic flag where their old Soviet flag used to hang. It is good for them that Communism is ending, but with this they arc losing a large part of their history and arc left to contemplate the memories as welt as the future. ~PI!' for a ~tWS l)osition Qrobap!

CONCORDIENSIS • FEBRUARY 20, 1992 • PAGE 6 Black& Blue by Betsy Rothste,in Concordiensis Staff The scene: Freshman year, Winter Term, a cold and icy night. I was mnning, since it was cold and suddenly I went flying into the air and fell on my face. For an instant I heard a sharp cracking noise. .I sat on the ground in shock and realized that half of my front tooth was on the ground in front of me. No, I was not intoxicated at the time but I guess it would llave been a more reasonable excuse for such a ridiculous falL I walked away from that with only a few minor scrapes and bruises, not to mention a feeling of emptiness between two of my teeth. Granted, I looked like I had been punched in the face by a mad, deranged, weird \undesirable and besides the blood gushing out of my mouth I looked completely normal. Dear Alice, In my sorority I feel uncomfortable eating because people leer at me as if they are calculating how much I have on my plate. I will be eatillg a well balanced and healthy meal, while they verbally tell me how many calories and grams of fat I am about to intake. All I see them eat are large, plain baked potatoes, and if they are not completely satisfied, they will treat themselves with a mountain of broccoli for dessert. I see these people as looking grossly anemic (this condition is called malnutrition in third world countries). Their skin has a grayish tone and their clothes hang off them as if they were skeletons. I am concerned because these people are so unsatisfied with themselves that they endanger their health and· put a lot of stress upon their friends. I am aware of the severity of eating disorders. However, it is 11nfair rJf them to impose tlleir problem on those of us who enjoy a healthy diet. Just as it My first falling on my face production occurred in high school when I had to walk down a .huge set .of stairs located oa an icy :hill. As I was making my way dowa these stairs I felt myself beginning to slide and I knew I had no control over what was to happen to me. I noticed a lone guy struggling to make his way up the icy hill. I did not know him; he was a complete stranger. I knew I had two choices: I could either continue sliding down the hill, fall on my face, break both my legs and lose a few teeth, or I could grab onto the guy and hence stop my fall and prevent myself from breaking a few bones. So, I opted for choice number two and latched, onto the unknown glly. We both went flying down the hill and landed in a di,tch. Anyone watching this scene must have been slightly amused. I came out of that without a scratch, whereas the randorn guy fell on would be inappropriate for a person like myself to force them to eat more., it is unfair of them to make me feel uncomfortable with the amount of food I cat. How should a person with \normal\ eating habits cope with this situation? --Happy and Healthy Dear Happy and Healthy, It sounds as though are a person with very sound and well thought out views. It is important for you to realize though that you need to be compassionate for these unhealthy people who are so preoccupied with their weight. It is understandable that you become annoyed with them, but perhaps you can channel your anger by doing something in an attempt to help them. It is hard to get up the nerve to confront people with eating disorders, especially if they are your good friends. I am not saying that this is you, but it seems pathetic for :people who are close friends of those with eating disorders to take such an apathetic attitude Stich as not CROSSTALK his face, broke a leg and lost a few teeth (only kidding). Recently I witnessed a prime example of how hilarious it can be to watch someone fall on his face. After Christmas vacation I flew into LaGuardia Air.port. After collecting my two suitcases I went to search for a cab. I was approached by a shady, yet harmless looking man (a little on the greasy side), holding a taxi sign. Being ~hat he agreed to carry my luggage and the fact that a lady dressed in a power suit and networking pumps was also going to share the cab, I decided to take the ride. So, the man grabbed my suitcases and we began out journey to the taxi. We must have been walking for ten minutes or so and I was amazed that this man was able to carry my suitcases so far. Finally we arrived at a parking garage where an unexplainable, overwhelming sense of strength must have come over the man. I think he • II doing anything to help, seeing that these people are in grave danger of becoming really sick and destroying their bodies. I am not suggesting that if you are an acquaintance you should confront a person with an eating disorder. The person that approaches someone with anorexia or bulimia must be a close friend; someone the person can trust and in whom they can confide. If in fact you are a good friend to someone you think may have an eating disorder, they desperately need your help whether they realize it or not. You can do a few things to help them: Call their parents or any other relative you feel may be able to help the situation, confront the person and most of all remember that they need a great deal of support from their friends to get through something as serious as an eating disorder. --Alice Send all questions and problems to Ask Alice.

Suddenly StLperman kicked in and he decided to swing the networking/power suit lady's baggage !lfound his neck. His body was no longer visible; i,t was one big piece of luggage. And we were off again ... only now he 1hadpicked up the pace quite a bit. I thought little of it as I had to jog to keep up with this maniac taxi driver. The power pump lady even broke out into a slight sweat. Suddenly everything seemed to be in slow motion as the man/one big piece 'Of luggage went soaring into the air and landed on his stomach. Tears were streaming down my face I was laughing so hard btlt I tried to remain silent. Finally, Superman rose from .the ground and looked like a brand new man with scrapes. running actoss his face. He was relatively healthy th<mgh. He dropped our bags and told us to · wait and he would get the taxi. Finally he rolled u:p in this gigantic Cadillac cheesemobile{boat from hell. I won't even get into tl!e rest of the story ... Falling and tripping can be a very embarrassing and humiliating experience. However, it is imp(>)rtant to realize that watching a virtual stranger or even a good friend fall can be one of the funniest 1ncidents to witness. It is equally important to take a fall in stride and to accept the fact that if you do fall on your face, as painful as it m ~ght be, people are going to laugh at you and then hopefully they will help you up onto your feet, unless of course, your feet are already broken.

While bureaucracy presents barriers. in any environment, Union's hierarchical chain of command appears t() set limitations for itself. Aside from its fundamental systematic constraints, Union politics can. be characterized by a severe communication problem. In short, something drastic must be done td remedy this situation before the prolJtem becomes irreversible. issues and discuss solutions to student concerns. Moreover, some publicity on open meetings of governmental bodies could be of great use, unless of cout~se these entities do not want input from the campus community. Communication has become a foreign concept at Union in terms of student-student, administration-student, and administration- administration relations. It would appear that no one knows what anyone else is doing nor how or why they are doing it. Unfortunately, this ambiguity pe:rvad<:?s each and every tier of authority at the Col:lege including those in charge of the college's finances. Perhaps students have had such a difficult time with this because the administration has by no means provided them with a superior model. It would appear that tbe communication problem permeates the ranks of those employed by this institution just as extensively. As for administration-student relations, students and administration must begin to communicate respectively amongst themselves before they can concur collectively. The solution to this problem must start with the basics. For instance, elected student officials have a responsibility of .serving those who elected them. It is not difficult for these representatives to periodicaJ:ly meet with their peers in an ·effort to keep them up to date on c:u::n-ent U one cannot communicate with another within this microcosm of the real world, how is one expected to relate to others outside of the Union gates? Good communication skills should be one of the primary objectives of a liberal arts college; at Union, apparently they are not. Vote, Union College, You Can Do It Now that the New Hampshire Primary is over, it is time f(Jr the inhabitants of Union College to pay attention. With the New York, Massachusetts, and Connecticut contests looming in the not-so-distant future, it is likely that most students and faculty are yet to hav.e the opportunity to vote. because it entails registering and then obtaining absentee ballots or going home on the day .of the primary. However, this is no excuse for not voting. These people have two major obligations to fulfill. The first is to become informed of the issues and how the candidates stand on each issue. This may be hard to do considering the fact that the issues ue not really being discussed openly. The debates center more on the persunal lives and moral characters of each person in the race. However, with some effort one can get to the bottom ofrnatters. One way of doing this is by looking at the track records of the candidates. Most are curre11tly serving terms as elected officials. The best way to determine how they feel about issues is to look at how they have acted in the past. One can also look back on how they have handled problems not unlike the: ones they would face if elected to the White House. Neither is the age-old adage, \My vote doesn't matter.\ The only real issue here is that we live in a democracy, which is a society in which the people elect their officials. Every vote counts, in this era of special interest groups and lobbyists, especially in the primaries. During the primaries, each vote is important, even if it is not cast in favor of the ultimate winner. The number of votes received by each candidate determines the amount of impact he will have on the party's nominee and what his platform becomes. Thus, each citizen has the obligation to his country, and to himself, to vote so that his concerns may be addressed. The second, the actual act of voting, sounds simple but may be surprisingly rarely accomplished by young adults living away from home. In fact, voting may be a considerable pain in the butt for many, So, Union College, go out and educate yourselves (that is what we're all here for, isn't it?) and then go vote for someone. It doesn't matter who you vote for, just make sure you vote and you know why you voted for that person. There are some extremely important issues which need to be addressed by our leaders and it is up to us to make sure they do so.

We are disappointed in the quality of the article due to the inaccuracy of the facts reported, and the author's overall tone. Names were both incorrect and misspelled, Director of the Career Development Center, Joanne Tobiessen was improperly recognized as a key speaker, and the gender of one of the speakers was reversed. In addition to these errors, we feel the event was much more significant than was portrayed by the author. As Chairpersons for '92 & Beyond~ we wotrld like to once again extend our gratitude to all of the speakers and special guests, and apologize for the follow errors: -Dr. Anne E.

Top Girls is a play about women and their struggle to survive as mothers, wives, executives, in all aspects of life. Caryl Churchill, the author of Top Girls, presents the audience with a wide variety of women in differ:ent circumstances, who hold very different views concerning what it means to them to be a woman and a human being as welL Although the main subject of Top Girls is women, Churchill's words become universal for men and women alike. The women in Top Girls are women from the past, for example, Pope Joan, a woman pope in the ninth century, and women in the present, a mother and daughter and the women of the Top Girl Employment Agency. Top Girls will be running in the Nott Memorial Theatre, February 18-22 at 8 p.m. every night. Tickets are only three dollars and can be purchased in the College Cente-r.

CONOORDIENSIS •FEBRUARY 20, 1992 • PAGE 11 Wayne'• ·world by Ned Walley Arts Editor A \two ,thumbs up\ from Siskel and Ebert might previously have provoked me to a subdued response similar to \hmm\, but now., the one that pops into mind is \Excellent\'!. If you haven't guessed the movie in reference (as if!), then.you weren't one of .the millions of Americans who ventured to theaters this past week to spend a grand total of $18.000,000 ,in order to view \Wayne's World\. Directed by :lorne Michaels and produced by Penelope Spheeris, \Wayne's World\ is a comedy along the lines of the \Airplane\ series, and spins a tale of achieving fame, fortune, and that bodacious babe, as Wayne (Mike Myers) and Garth (Dana Carvey) discover exactly what true greed is from their producer (played by Rob Lowe). The movie st:arts out as Wayne and Garth are broadcasting one of their shows on publk access T.V. from Wayne's parents' basement. Lowe notices their show and decides that .they might be the perfect replacement for \The Love Bo~t\. so he gets them to sign a contract which leaves him with total ownership of the show, with or without Wayne and Garth. In the meantime, Wayne successfully falls in love with, and bags the heavy-metal-guitarist babe (played by Tia Carrero}, while Garth has many amusing dreams about the girl who works at Mike Mikata's (Ted) doughnut shop. Wayne and Garth portray two bum-outs who are avid heavy metal . fans. Their lively escapades carry them through an extremely harmonic rend·ition of Queen's \Bohemian Rhapsody\ to meeting the utterly intellecttial Alice Cooper. Street hockey, Wayne's ability to fluently capture the Chinese Cantonese dialect, and, of course, the Scooby-doo ending, can not have their hilarity left out of this recount, either. In summary, the movie provided an ample amount of light\aearted humor. And just becau£e there is absolutely no intellectual stimuli offered to the viewer does not make it worthless in my book. One must only realize what kind ()f movie this is, and, after accepting this, can anyone view it pleasurably. Wayne's World: Excellent! Robert To Bleifer, Photographer, Come To Union mystical force of the rain forest became visible to him in cross- cut sections of trees. The artist expresses this spirituality through extreme close-ups of naturally occurring anomalies in wood. Bleifer's solo shows include: The Village Gate Gallery of Fine Art, Rochester, NY, May 1991 and 1990; The Robert Bleifer was born in Bronx, New York in 1965 and was raised in Woodmere, New York, where he now lives and works. While Bleifer's background is in traditional black & white and color photography, his interest in the rain forest lead to new directions in his work. It began in 1989 with the use of rain forest photographs printed on pieces of wood. These wood sculptures dealt with the preservation of the rain forest and its indigenous people. After nearly two years of working with wood and studying the rain forest and the mythology of its people, Bleifer tapped into the spirituality of wood: the . Chaiwala, Salisbury, CT, June-July 1990. His group exhibitions include: \Art as Dialogue,\ The Gallery, R.I.T., Rochester, NY, April 1991; \A Current State of Mind,\ The Gallery, R.I.T., Rochester, NY, April 1988 and 1989; \International Photo Show,\ Gallery Seven, E.

' \ Union To Host New York State Women's Swim Meet February 20, 21 and 22 Courtesy of Sports Information Union College will host the 17-team New York State Women's Collegiate Athletic Association Swimming and Diving Championships this Thursday, Friday, and Saturday (Febr1:1ary 20 through 22) at Alumni Gym. Competition begins each day with trials at 11 a.m. with finals each evening at 7:00. Defending champion Ithaca College, winners of five of the last six titles, will be looking to hold off challenges from Union and Hamilton. The Dutchwomen, who won the 1990 crown, are the only team to dethrone the Bombers in the last six years. Union won their title over Ithaca in the meet's final event with the final swimmer. Last year Union took third. Hamilton, meanwhile, has finished second to Ithaca in 1991, 1989, and 1988. Two of this year's better races are expected to be the 100 butterfly and the 50 breaststroke. Both events are scheduled for Thursday. Last year Union's Jeanne Cutrone won the 100 fly in a record-setting 59.16. Union's Kelly Bevan was second followed by Ithaca's Audra Craft and Hamilton's Jennifer Samp. All return for this year's rematch. In the 50 breast, Ithaca's Dawn Schmalzriedt, then a freshman, set a state record with her 31.73. She was followed by Bevan, Hartwick's Susan Torell, and Hamilton's Pat Wojcik. Once again, aH will return to battle for the crown. While Ithaca graduated Amy Robinson (who won three events and anchored the relay teams), the Bombers have Schmalzriedt, now a sophomore. Last season she won the 500 free and 50 breast while finishing second in the 100 breast and 200 free. She also placed third in the 200 breast and was a member of several winning relay teams. Union returns state champions in Cutrone (50, 100, and 200 fly) and Bevan (100 and 200 breaststroke as well as the 100 individual medley). Union also won the 200 freestyle relay event. Hamilton, meanwhile, returns V aierie Gude, who won the 400 IM while placing third in the 200 IM and fout:th in the 200 breast. \There is no question that Ithaca is the team to beat,\ said Bassett. \B1:1t I think that we and Hamilton have a good chance at them if things break our way.\ SCHEDULE OF EVENTS THURSDAY FEBRUARY 20th FRIDAY FEBRUARY 21st SATURDAY FEBRUARY 22nd Trials-U:OO a.m. Finals-7 p.m. Trials·ll:OO a.m. Finals-7 p.m. Trials-11 a.m. Finals-7 p.m. 200 Medley Relay 500 Freestyle 100 Butterfly 200 Backstroke 50 Breaststroke 200 Ind.

Union beat Vassar 62-51 this past Wednesday; however, they dropped a tough tame to a powerful Williams team 62-54. Union's record now stands at 11-9. The remaining games in the schedule now loom to be must-win situations if Union is to extend their season. The Dutchmen received a good team effort as they shot down Vassar. Once again Robin Romer led the way for Union with 34 points and an incredible 22 rebounds. Twelve of these rebounds were off the offensive boards which helped provide her with additional scoring opportunities. The team as a whole is still struggling with their field goal percentage. They shot a leery 36% from the floor and 50% from the line. The fact that Union took 21 more shots than Vassar helped to diminish the importance of their field goal percentage. Union did a terrific job with their half court press. Their solid execution led to a considerable amount of turrtOvers. In addition, Wendy Getty had a strong game off the beni:h as she added six points and grabbed five rebounds. S.aturday's game against Wimarns was a little less enc()uraging. Once again poor sh.Goting percentage and a high number of turnovers led to Uni<>n's demise. If the team sh<lots over 40% from the floor and 65% from the line they shculd win. However, Union sh()t 31 % from the floor and 4& OfJ from the line enroute to their loss. The Dutchmen committed a disappointing 23 turnovers. Union was up by 6 po-ints at the half, but they coul<l not hold on to the lead in the ~econd half. On the brighter side, four players were in double figures: Romer with 16, Andrea Pagnozzi with 12, Miche11e Klei:nhaus with 11 and fre~hman Deb Montano with 10.

, r·~ CONCORDIENSJS • FEBRUARY 20, 1992 • PAGE 15 Craig Ferrero Moves Into 4th Place On Union's All- Ti1ne Scoring List by Dan Strum Spo,:ts Editor The Union Hockey team has had a tough season this year as they have made the big jump from Division III to Division I competition. No one was quite sure how some of the veteran players would react to this radical change in the level of play. Many of them worked hard in the off-season in preparation for this challenge. One of the few players who have risen to the task is Senior Craig Ferrero. For his outstanding achievements throughout the week and the entire season, Craig Ferrero has been named Concordiensis Sports Athlete of the week. Ferrero, who hails from Commack, NY, is in his final season for the Skating Dutchmen. Throughout three seasons, Ferrero has netted 42 goals and 65 assists for 107 points. His junior year was his most successful as he tallied 49 points. This year Ferrero is the leading scorer on the team thus far. He has 11 goals and 15 assists for 26 points. His three point effort against Clarkson this past weekend moved him into fourth place on the Union Hockey All-Time Scoring list. Through 103 games he has 53 goals and SO assists for 133 points. -~ Craig Ferrero Ferrero is valuable to the Union squad in many ways other than scoring. He is one of the team leaders who helps to raise the level of play around him. He plays on both the powerplay and the penalty killing units which is a tribute to his excellent conditioning. His work effort on the team is second to none. Perhaps one of the most striking contributions Ferrero gives to the team is his keen faceoff ability. Coming into this season, Ferrero was winning 71.9% of his faceoffs by winning 1,238 ot his 1, 721 opportunities. This year Ferrero has won 363 of his 580 attempts for a 62.6%. Considering that Ferrero is constantly squared off against the best centers in Division I, his statistics are quite impressive. One of the most memorable moments for Ferrero has to be his overtime goal which lifted the Dutchmen to victory at Dartmouth giving Union their first ECAC Division I win. However, it has not just been this isolated incident. Ferrero has sustained a hi·gh level of play throughout the entire season. He has maintained a level of excellence which has carried him through both the Division III and Division I ranks. Ferrero has had a spectacular career for Union thus far and we wish him the best of luck in his future endeavors. Once again, congratulations and continued success to Craig Ferrero, Concordiensis Sports Athlete of the Wt>ek.

The next pseudo-U.S. hockey fan who approached me during a game will regret doing so .. .I promise. True Olympic llockey fans have to understand what I mean. You're sitting down watching the game against Sweden, Poland or any of the other games, and one of these infamous baby Einsteins comes into the room. \Hey what's the score?\ You unwillingly answer, with a tone of voice that implies the question and answer session is now over. Obviously not realizing the problem with his presence, the idgit persists, \Hew's Ray playing?\ Like this idiot and standout goaltender Ray LeBlanc are best of friends. Your first instinct is to tum and smack this schmuck through the window. However, you are nice and respond with an emphatic; \Fine\. If you don't understand this p.redicament, or you feel you can not relate to this, please stop reading and go to the asterisked section at the end of the article. Okay, if your still · here, this problem really has to annoy you as much as it annoys me. I also want to say tllat I truly sympathize with tile fans that can not watch the games due to class or other serious time constraints. I personally would skip class for a game at the drop of a hat, but I can't hold it against these people. On the other hand, these people are not the nuisance in this situation. They stay their distance from the bothersome conversations. They watch when they can, I have no problem with them. I also have no problem with the · people who are watching the games for the same reason a non-football fan watches the Super Bowl. They want to see the best play. The problem arises with the people who feel they wrote the • last book on U.S. hockey, and c;an't even tell the difference boetween Herb Brooks and Dave F-eterson. Please ask that bJaindead annoying loser about the 1960 Gold-medal winning team, or ask him about the 1'~80 team and who played on it. Ask him about the '84 games and Pat Lafontaine or ewen the '88 games and what place we came in. For that matter ask this \#l fan\ about tlie Italy game of this Olympics. Good luck getting an1 answer. This is the heat of tiLe problem. These people heard of our chances in the Olympics and decided to rule oar medal hopes dismal. What I w.ouldn't do for a tape of these d~rks from a week ago. *** I'll get off my soapbox n()W and give a big request to all the readers who left at the tof and are back now. Please stop boring those who have be-en with this team from the start. Some of us DID get ex-cited when the U.S. team an11ounced that the Capital Di.strict would be their pre- season home. Some of us even w<!nt to a game or two ... evcn three ... WOW .. .isn't that odd!!! Stop bothering those of us wllo read the Sports Illustrated article about the lack of U.S. hojpe even getting into the medal round, and decided to cheer even louder to offset this pessi-mism. Please stop bothering those of who who have breathed U.S. hockey for the past few months, not days. St()p giving true fans your pre;achings and teachings about a team you know so little about.

The prospects of victory for the Skating Dutchmen this past weekend were not that good. Two of the nation's best were on hand at Achilles Rink to face a Union squad in the midst of a long season. However, Union came to play and was not to be easily dismissed. Union lost a tough game to St. Lawrence University on Friday night 5-1, and then dropped the second game to Clarkson University 6-3.

The Skating Dutchmen played one of their best games of the season as .they opened up against St. Lawrence. They held the Saints scoreless in the first period with their tight checking style or play. However, St. Lawrence fought back with two goals in the first two and a half minutes to go up 2-0. The second period ended with the score standing at 3-1. Union's goal was a powerplay goal scored by Freshman Chris Albert on assists by Dalton Menhall and Bill Railton. On Saturday night. Union had a tough first period, but they persevered and played Clarkson even for the remainder of the game. Union was on the short end of a 4-1 first period score. Union's lone goal came as a result of a. spectacular individual effort by Railton. Craig Ferrero fed Rail ton as he skated around the defenseman. As he was being taken down, Railton made a nifty backhand move and slid the puck between the goalie's pads. Union played Clarkson tough for the rest of the game as they traded goals in both the second and third periods. The Dutchmen received goals from Jayson Flowers on assists by Rick Clifford and Ferrero, and by Ferrero on assists by Matt Kelley and Rick Burchill. Luigi Villa made 34 saves in yet another one of his fine efforts. Albert was one player whose effort should receive recognition. His hard work has been encouraging for the team as they may be looking to build on his strong freshman campaign. Union's record now stands at 1-16-1. They are on the road this week at Cornell and Colgate. Union 6: Strong· At Colgate by Herrika D. Poor Contributing Writer The Union Women's track team made a strong showing this weekend in Hamilton, NY. Comp'eting against sixteen other schools, the Union women held their own at the 16th Annual Colgate Invitational. Starting the day for Union was Freshman Diana Spenello who ran the mile in 5:44.8. Senior Alix Goldschmidt, the- team's \thrower of the week,\ gathered the most points for Union by placing fourth in the shot put and 20 pound weight. Her best throw in the shot put was 11.17 meters and her best throw in ·the weight competition was 11.32 meters. The remaining foar members of Union's six woman squad combined to gather the rest of the team's 19 points. Seniors Denise Saunders and Junior Tasha LaBare ran in the 55 meter dash in times of 7.84 and 8.1 respectively, with Denise advancing to the finals\ In the finals she ran an even better time of 7. 79 and placed fifth. Freshman Nadine Filosi ran the 55 meter hurdles in a 9 .4 which let her advance to the finals where she ran a 9.85 and placed fifth. The Co- Captains Tasha and Senior Rika Poor then ran the 400. Rika, returning from the walking wounded, ran her fust race of the season in a 61.7 which qualified her for both States and ECACs and placed her fifth overall. Tasha ran well, despite a few arm tugs and getting stepped on, crossing the line in 64 .2. These four returned to run in the last race of the day. Leading the foursome into the 4x400 meter relay was Tasha who ran a 64.1 despite again being tripped up. She handed off to Deruse who ran a 64.57 leg and handed off to Nadine who ran a 69 .63. Anchoring the relay to a fifth place finish and a seasonal best was Rika who ran a 61.97. Overall the four women compiled a 4:20.27. The six women who went to Colgate combined their efforts and tallied 19 points to finish tenth out of seventeen teams. · We'd like to welcome the new, and returning, women who joined us Monday for the start of the spring season.

Some smiled when they found . out that they were in the pack who would fly off to Europe, East Asia, or South America. However, many others did not experience this moment of · glory when they were told that theirs was one of the names on the waiting list. The current Terms Abroad office policy for the acceptance · of students to terms without an interview is very clear cut. Seniors who meet the academic standard and have the permission of the Dean's office get preference. After that, · Juniors are chosen according to their grade point average. The remaining sophomores will be placed on the list Jast. However, for the term in Italy, declared art majors have standing equal to that of seniors. This class of students must be approved by both the registrar and the Art Founder's Day Speaker -page 4 World Renowned Musicians to Play at Union ........... \ 8 Department as Art History majors before being accepted to the term. Professor Thomas. Director of the Terms Abroad office, pointed out that this has always been the case with Italy. The situation this year is that there are more Art History majors applying for the trip; therefore, more are being accepted In· the case of China and Japan, both of which have interviews, the accepting policy is slightly different. These terms require interviews because of the extreme difference in culture between the United States and these nations. According to Professor Thomas it is very important that those chosen to these terms be prepared for the cultural difference that they will experience. As far as applications go, the number of them that were received this year did not differ greatly with previous years. However, numbers are starting to decrease slightly. Professor Thomas explains this by looking at the economy and the problems that the nation, students, and families are facing. He feels that more students are having a problem International News Summary -page 12 Schach Talk -page 19 • a1t - List with the difference in C()St between a te:trn abroad and a term at Union.

As far as n.on-Union ter111s abroad are co11cemed, the policy has changed. rhe problem here is that if a s:tudent goes on a non-Union term the school is losing revenue that they otherwise would have received. Professor Thomas believes that given current budget cuts and problems, those numbers are intolerable. President Roger Hull reported that last year the school lost approximately $375,000 due to the 63 people that went on non-Union terms . He believes that this money · would have been better spent on 40 or so students in need of financial aid, or the salaries of eight professors, or renovations of school buildings. Now, in order to go away on : a non-Union term, a strict 3.0 GP A is required and looked at very carefully. Professor · Thomas states that \it is ; necessary to prove that what you want to do is something , that Union does not offer and· makes good academic sense, given your major.\ He reports that to date only 7 of about 20- 25 have been accepted. As most members of the Union community kiww, President Hull has said, a11d continues to repeat, that \'(I would) personally like to ~ce every Union student ~o abroad.\ He further believes that this is possible. His go:als as of now are to not only hruve all students go abroad, but to also expand the existi:ng programs and create new programs and to examine different ways of sendimg students abroad . .Although the President does think that the current participation rate of 40% is good, he thinks that 100% would be far better.

Williams-Muhammed is involved iim the Cris.is Prevention Unit, a program which was designed to alleviate racial tensi()ns in certain communitie!; where tbe possibility o()f the conflicts escalating iiLto violence is greatest. Williams-Muhammed believes th~t although the program is implemented in selected areas., the problem of racial bias ex..ists everywhere in the United States. The thrust M the frrst part of the presentati()n centered around the necessity of people recognizing 1me importance of acknowledging that racial bias exists. According to Williams- Muhammed, many northerners deny the existence of racism in their communities. Although the possibility of seeing the Klan march down the streets of New York City is rare, covert racism is still largely in effect Muhammed stated that preferential treatment of certain Deborah Williams-Muhammed races is the major covert racism that exists. The second part of the presentation was a movie that discussed the overt operations of the wll ite supremacy movement in the South. The membership of the Ku Klux Klan has doubled over the past five years largely due to the active interest of the Klall! in pursuing new members. The film illustrates how the Klan recruits young children for future membership. The K Jan Youth Corps is for children age ten to seventeen. They ru11 a camp for these youngsters so as to isolate them and entre11c h them in Klan ideology. The film had footage of one of the speeches given to the youngsters.

Pressley, Jr. is the newest member of the Union College Board of Trustees. A Union graduate of 1975, Pressley was elected last month at age 39. As a Union Alumnus, Pressley has served as all• admissions representative and is a member of Friends of Unic:Jn Athletics. Mr. Pressley says that one of the biggest drawb~cks of Union is the lack of st11dent and faculty diversity. This :problem is not unique w our college, but it is a negative factor in the recruitment o.lf minority students who are qualified for admission to Union. In light of this, Pressley strives to increase the proportion of minority students in the college. He also stressed that admission to Union College will not be granted solely based on racial origin, but of merit and inteHect. Combining this ideal with Pressley's active recruitm.ent in the Columbus area, he hopes to attract more minority students and make Union a more multi-cultural institution. This, he says, will not weaken Union's high reputation, but will only enhance it. by Brendan Clifford Student F orwn President The past few weeks have been particularly interesting at the Student Forum because .of the important issues that have been discussed and dealt with.

Recently a new trip to Brazil was started. However, the student turn-out rate has not been what was originally expected. President Hull also reported that a trip to Costa Rica is being looked at as well as one to Africa. Furthermore, with the new developments in Eastern Europe, a possible trip there is also being looked into. To all those who are currently on the waiting lists, President Hull offers some advice. He thinks that, where applicable, the studeat should take the necessary courses required for the teim. He furt.ber feels that \based on the past, 1he student will go where they signed up to go.\ The President encourages students to explore the other options available to them. There are other terms that may not be filled to capacity that would interest a great many students. Professor Thomas encourages students to give the waiting lists time to work and let the process run its course.

In fact, the Klan is so successful in indoctrinating the youngsters that virtuall)' all the children that attend the camps become members. Lastly, the Ku Klux Klan maintains that although their leaders preach about the inferiority of certain minor,ity groups, and talk about the necessity of removing these groups from society, racial violence is 110 more the policy of the Klan than it is of the police departments. The next part part of the presentation gave the audience an opportunity to comment on the issues presented and ask questions of Williams- Muhammed. A good deal of the comments dealt with the criticism that we live in a society of co11tradictions. Quite a few people are very passive when it comes to dealigg with racial bias. Many people tend to ignore the problems around them, figuri11g that they will never be effected by racial tensions. Th<>se people that are passive tend to support the fact that \everyone is created equal.\ Accepting tllis belief and not fighting agi:linst racial bias exploits the hypocrisy ()[ people in our society according to Muhammed. Williams- Muhammed :also believes that people who do n M acknowledge the significance of gender bias are permitting an equally potent form of prejudice to spread. Williams-Muhammed does not believe that the complete abolition of hate groups is a feasible goal for the civil rights movement. This goal is not realistic mainly because too many people believe that we, as a society, have overcome tbe Virtually all the children that attend the [KKK indoctrinating] camps become members. racial problems that plagued us in the past. In fact, there is a growing hatred of tbe Japanese in the United States simply because they are making money in the United States by being more ambitious than · their American counterparts .. This racism can bave a snowball effect and get out of hand. Furthermore, Americans seem to believe that they stand on a higher moral ground than people of other nati<>nalities. Alumni Council's Nott Memorial Committee Survey Results The committee received the list of op1ions that the administration was considering and conducted a non-binding survey of the Alumni Council members at tlte November Alumni Council meeting. The survey asked the members to rate the options that the administration was considermg from 1 (disagree) to 5 (agree). The results proved to be interesting. The option that scored the highest was the use for exhibit a11d gallery space which was rated a 4.37 out of 5. Second was performance space, place for charnber music and other related performances, which was ra1ed a 3.53 out of 5. Right behind performance space was assembly space for different gatherings which was rated a 3.34 out of 5. Finally, the option for library use-any use that could be called a library use-was rated 2.47 out of 5. Dividing library use into two different areas, study use and actual use by the library, presented disparate results. The study use option scored higher with a 3.01 out of 5, wbereas, actual library use scored lower with a 1.92 out of 5. This information will be sent to the college administtation as they discuss what the restored Nott Memorial will be. According to Williams- Muhammed, this attitude is dangerous, supported by misconceptions. Throughout its history the United States has profited through mistreating the native Americans and removing them from land that was rightfully theirs. In addition, the United States government helped to build the system of apartheid in South Africa through passive opposition. This attitude is dangerous because by diminishing the significance of the racial problems in this country, we are allowing them to grow. ·Williams-Muhammed believes that educating the youth through programs such as the Crisis Prevention Unit will be successful in stemming the growth of anti-racial sentiments in the United States. She encouraged members of the student body that were present to become more involved in helping to stop the spread of racism in their communities. The presentation given by Williams-Muhammed was on Lhe heels of a lecture given by civil rights lawyer Morris Dees at Memorial Chapel. Thus it can be argued that the administration and the student body of Union College appear to be making a concerted effort to discuss remedies for the growing racial problems in the country. CONCORDIENSIS • FEBRUARY 27,.1992 • PAGE 4 Sophomores Hold Successful Class Meeting by Blaine Langberg, Lee Popper and Mia Caetona · Contributing Writers The Sophomore Class meeting, held on Tuesday, February 19 was a definite success! Various issues were discussed ranging from the mandatory Junior on-campus housing policy to the new campus pub. Clearly, the most controversial issue of the evening was the administration's decision to implement the previously defunct housing policy. This policy requires that all Juniors, ex.cept for commuting students, live on campus. The fifty or so students who attended the meeting elicited their hostility towards this new housing .. In the past, Juniors have always had the option of living off campus if they pleased. However, Union has now taken these liberties away due to tbeir financial situation last year. The class is currently trying te implement a compromise that would allow a portion of the Junior class to live off campus. For those Juniors who will live on campus, a new policy is also being discussed. This policy would allocate blocks of rooms to a certain number of students who apply. The next heated debate that emerged concerned the new Terms Abroad dilemma. Many students expressed immense anger because they felt President Hull has not upheld his commitment to allow all students to go on a term abroad. Students feel that the cuiTent Tenns Abroad should either be enlarged, or that more programs should be created. The class representatives are currently discussing their disappointment with the program with Professor Thomas, the head of Terms Abroad. Finally, the Sophomore class discussed the on-campus Pub. There was general consensus that this new social alternative will be beneficial to all. Students felt that this pub will provide the opportunity for faculty and students to interact. Due to the large number of Sophomores that attended the meeting. the Sophomore class representatives were able to address the concerns of the study body. Continued input from the student body will make it possible for the representatives to compromise with the administration in order to meet the needs of the students. The class officers would like to thank all the Sophomores who attended the class meeting. Thanks to the input, t-he representatives have been able to address the key and vital issues that concern the Sophomore class and the entire student body. Don't forget, if you- have any opinions on these or any other issues please contact your class representatives: Blaine Langberg, Mia Caetona, Lee Popper.

Four speakers spoke to a .packed auditorium about both alcohol and its effects, and what it is like to be an alcoholic at a discussion on Alcohol Awareness on Monday, February 24. The first speaker was Arnie Rubin'93, who presented part of a program originally designed for RA's. Arnie discussed what physically happens when a person drinks. He explained the mis~ conceptions many people have about tolerance, and claimed that alcohol still affects an individual regardless of how much that individual drinks. He then gave the audience a quiz ' on personal alcohol consumption. The results showed that many more people than you might think could have an alcohol problem. Arnie's statistics showed that 60% of people on campus have an alcohol problem and that 10-15% of students are alcoholics. alcohol, commented, \I keep what I got by giving it alcohol and drug use was extremely common.

He also used street drugs. He told the audience about waking up on a beach and not knowing where he was; he later discovered that he was in Cape Cod. He had driven all the way from Albany to the Cape and did not remember any of the trip. Mike lost his wife and children because of his problem, and never received treatment until a visit to a doctor, due to insomnia, landed him in a detox/rehabilitation program. The final speaker was a young woman named Patrice. Patrice also started drinking during her freshman year of high school. She felt that when she was drinking she was prettier and more fun than when she was sober; however, whenever she was not drinking she was extremely depressed. She claimed that she could go months without drinking and then some terrible incident would happen; she would wake up on her front lawn, for example, and not remember how she got there. She also would periodically remember incidents that she had previously blacked out. Patrice sought therapy for her problems and went through four therapists in four years; whenever they asked her how much she drank, slle would change therapists. She finally began to realize she was an alcoholic when two of her good friends from college joined AA. She decided to attend the meetings with the hope that if she was an alcoholic, there would be an answer to her problems. She ended her speech · by saying of AA. \A lot of people say \it saved my Hfe .. .it gave me a life.\ She also attends daily AA meetings. Kevin, the first speaker. then returned to the stage to stress the importance of treating alcoholism, and said, \You don't have to end up like I did. I lost my wife, my job ... my morals, my material possessions. It doesn't have to be that way ... AA is my medicine. I go every day to take my medicine.\ He told the audience that if they or someone they know has a problem, ~hey should talk to counselors, RA's, a teacher, a friend, anyone.

The final speaker was a young woman named Patrice. Patrice also started drinking during her freshman year of high school. She felt that when she was drinking she was prettier and more fun than when she was sober; however, whenever she was not drinking she was extremely depressed. She claimed that she could go months without drinking and then some terrible incident would happen; she would wake up on her front lawn, for example, a11d not remember how she got there. She also would periodically remember incidents that she had previously blacked out. Patrice sought therapy for her problems and went through four therapists in four years; whenever they asked her how much she drank, she would change therapists.

CONCORDIENSIS FEBRUARY 27, 1992 PAGE 6 Primary Season In Full Swing by j1im Polites News Editor Well, with two prima~ies complete and the campaigning season in full swing, there has emerged one common thetne.: indecision among the electorate and a subsequent lack of consensus \With Democrnic Presidential nominees. The New Hampshire ntce saw former Massachusetts Senator Paul Tsongas claim1 an impressive :plurality as he forged to tile head of the Democratic dass. His me&s!lge was clear--economic reco-very through tax cuts in caphtal gains and pro-business investment-and was hig;ll- lighted metaphorically by his personal battle with cancer (he was diagnosed in 1983). This all added up to a creditable, victorious candida.te, one who IJeople in New Hampshire believed they could genuinely trust. Though Mr. Tsongas is indeed ~the moment's fnmtrunner and is running a current wave of popularity, h·is appeal bey<t nd the parameters of the Northe~t is certainly i11 question. rt's a challenge he must aspire to in the coming months. Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas, despite a public image that has been terribly damaged over the past few weeks, finished second to Tsongas with 26% of the New Hampshire vote. His troubles began on January 23 when a civil servant, Gennifer Flowers (sic), went public and exposed a twelve-year affair between she and the Presidential nominee. As if that wasn't enough, the beginning of February brought with it a new rash of distl:lfbing accusations-this time about Mr. Tsongas' appeal beyond the parameters of the Northeast is certainly in question. his draft evasion from Vietnam. One particularly inflammatory letter was publicized and documented throughout the nation; it contained Clinton's thanks to UNION :FRESHMAN FULL TUITION, FEES, BOOKS, AND SUMMER TRAINING WITH PAY Earn a regu far commission as an officer in the Navy or Marine Corps while completing your degree at Union.

'lhe Arkansas Governor's strong showing is a testament to bis appeal as a public figure, one who has unshakable confidence and an undeniable persuasiveness about him. While his past indiscretions certainly account for his distant second-place finish in New Hampshire-it was obvious many were still willing to listen. That, more than anything else, should give him reason to press on-it's clear his ,chan.ces are still quite good. On the Republican side of the ticket, New Hampshire proved to be an opportunity for voters to register their collective discontent with our Chief Executive George Bush. Mr. Buchanan's 40% of the vote was not only a surprise to the country, but a greater achievement than even the challenger could have hoped for. Suddenly overnight, Buchanan was transformed from the dying voice of the party's staunch conservatives to a legitimate contender for the Repubhcan nomination. Conventional wisdom says President Bush will take .this lesson to heart, campaign hard, and emerge fighti11g. As difficult as it may seem to believe-· this c0uld have been the best thiqg to .happen New Hamp.sbire proved to be an opportunity for voters to register their coUeetive discontent. to the President. He should now realize that his war- winning popularity (which plateaued .at 90%) is no longer enough to secure landslide electoral victory. In this we~k's Maine primary, ,thoug:ll, George Bush-as expected-· won a clear and decisive m!ljotity, no surprise considering his summer vacationing ties in Kennebunkport. The real shock came frem the Democrat's side this time, as California's Jerry Brown emerged .fr.om obscurity to tie Tsongas with 30% of the vote by late Sunday evening. Clinton finisbed a disappointing-and distant-· 1hird, renewing doubts about his credibility with the people. It was Brown though who stole the show, finally injecting himself into a Democratic race that until this moment found him on the periphery. With the next primary in South Dakota, look for Governor Clinton (once again), Nebraska's Bob Kerrey, and Tom Harkin of Iowa to make strides towards Paul Tsongas, while the former Massachusetts senator tries to prove that his vision is aU-encompassing, not jast regional. There's no doubt scrutiny will come his way. both from <Jther contenders and the public in general. Keep in {!lind that while proximity should in many cases dictate electoral success, Jerry Brown has proved that this race is as yet without pattern or parallel. If nothing else, it makes for spirited, even fierce campaigning competition. That's exactly the way it should be. a,~hokrnl,. howto 9JY, .~~-wou\~ tJU mind S7.1t. 10~ ou ~nd ptr3hiqg·: l\1 Japane$e ?. ..

World Renowned Musicians To Play at Union by Subash Bazaz Contributing Writer At 7:30 p.m., Wednesday, April 8, 1992, the Union College Memorial Chapel will be the scene of a special night of Indian Classical music. Shakti, along wilh the. Arts Department and the Concert Committee, will be sponsoring Zakir Hussain and Sultan Khan in concert, featuring improvisations based on rhythmic cycles and melodic creations based on ragas .. Both are world-renowned artists, and have received many awards for their musical achievements in India and the United Slates. Zakir Hussain's instrument of choice is the Tabla, the classical Indian drum. He started playing at an early age, and by age 12, was already touring in India. Mr. Hussain now gives concerts all over the world (including recent concerts in Paris, Munich and India), and also records extensively. The New York Times has called his playing \ ... genuine virtuosity\ and the Philadelphia Inquirer wrote, \There is only one Zakir Hussain. He hears things no one else does, then reproduces those sounds beautifully, his fingers driven by the computer in his head.\ Sultan Khan will be playing the Sarangi, a bowed instrument that sounds very much like the human. voice. This instrument was traditionally used for accompaniment, but Mr. Khan's talent has elevated its status to that of a solo instrument. He too tours frequently and makes recordings all over tlle world. Both virtuosos have also collaborated with other well- known artists, including Mickey Hart of The Grateful Dead, John McLaughlin, Ravi Shankar and George Harrison, and worked on vario\IS projects as well as contributed to the sound tracks for many movies (in fact, Zakir Hussain composed ·much of the music for Apocalypse Now and Vietnam: A ~elevision History). It is a rare privilege for Union to host a colicert with two such eminent artists. Make sure to get your tick~ts as soon as they go on sale at the end of the term in the Coll(1ge Center. Prices are $3 f&r Union students, $5 for the Union community, and $7 for the general public. The concert is a benefit program for SEW A- Rural Hospital in Gujarat, India. This hospital, which is funded solely by donations and government grants,. provides free health care and education for the poor li vi11g in 50 villages in southern Gujarat. Terry Lee Dill, Environmental Artist, To Speak and Exhibit Terry Lee Dill, a New York City sculptor who draws inspiration from radio towers and industrial landscapes, will deliver a lecture on architecture and engineering on Tuesday, March 3 at 2 p.m. in the College Center auditorium at Union College. His work will be on exhibit through March 3 in Strauss Lounge, also in the College Center. The exhibit will be open Monday through Friday, 10 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Both the lecture and exhibit are free to the public. Dill's work encompasses both sculpture and engineering. He has worked frequently on a very large scale, most recently for a public piece commissioned for the Gainesville (Fla.) Regional Utilities Headquarters called Sanctuary Sphere. \It's a fountain, it's a bench; you can get out of the sun, you can become a part of it,\ Dill said in a newspaper interview. Dill's works often take the form of highly detailed models and drawings. To visualize these works. th.e artist uses his experience in industry and technical fabrication (He was an eight-year member of the Boilermaker's Union.). The interface between art and engineering was an important force in early international modernist movements- Constructivism, De S tijl, the Bauhaus-and those- develop- ments are evident in Dill's work. Dill received his bachelor's in fine arts from Drake University, and his master's and M.F.A. from the University of Iowa. His one- person exhibits include the Tomoko Liguori G<»:llery, the Storefront for Art and Architecture, the A.M. Sachs Gallery, all in New York City. Dill's exhibit lias been supported by the Internal Education Foundati<Jn at Union College. His lecture is being supported by the College's Department of the Arts. Documentary To Be Shown The film Senso Daughters (Daughters of War), an award- winning documentary that focuses on the Japanese military's abuse of women in Papua New Guinea during World War II, w!ll be shown Tuesday, March 3, at 7 p.m. in the College Center auditorium at Union College. The film, which is free to the public, is sponsored by the Women's Studies department at Union. The film provoked considerable controversy in Japan because filmmaker Sekiguchi not only exposes a shameful episode in her nation's past, but examines the culture that allowed it to happen. Also, the Women's Studies department at Union will show Abortion: Stories from North and South on Tuesday, March 10, at 7 p.m., also in the College Center auditorium. Filmed in Ireland, Japan, Thailand, Peru, Colambia and Canada, the docnmentary shows the perspectives and insights of women ltfound the world on the s1tbject of abortion. That film also is free to the public. Winter Concert Series On Friday. Feb. 28, the Winter Concert Series concludes with \World Music and Jazz,\ featuring Prof. Tom Ross, guitar, vocals and mbira; Jeff Fuller, bass; and Randy Crafton, percussion. Students of Ross and members of the Gospel Choir will also perfonn with the group, doing traditiona1 music from India and Africa. The concert will have some audience participation, such a.s keeping the tala (rhythm cycle) for Indian. vocal pieces and singing the bass line for ancestral songs of the Shona people of Zimbabwe. There will also be crosscultural pieces and traditional jazz, one O>f which may be requested from the audience.

Final Analysis by Ned Walley Arts Editor Kim Basinger, Uma Thurman, Richard Gere, and Eric Roberts are :part of the impressive list of credentials that \Final Analysis\ director Phil Loanou hopes will cover up the lack of tension and depth in this Hitchcock wanna- be mystery thriller. It is a tale of suspense concerning a lonely psychiatrist's (Gere) obsessive love for the sister (Basinger) of one of his patients (Thurman). The catch is lhat Basinger has a sleazy, sadistic, mafia husband (Roberts) that she wants to be rid of. Here is where the mystery part begins in asking the question, \Exactly how far will Basinger go to get rid of Roberts?\ With this starring quartet, sex is a very active ingredient. And even with Basinget':s seductive whisper throughout the movie, the more sensuous pleasures in life are notenough to hold the movie together (well, at least in most cases, cough, cough). One .of the main problems of the film .i:s that tile script is so bland and sluggish, that the viewer i:s never convinced that anything is rea:lly at stake. Hey Kim, sex sells jeans, not movies. The San Francisco setting, and the use of a lighthouse for murder and sex, are more the style of Hitchcock, and not a:s effective for the \Thirty- Something\ crowd. This movie tries to be what it is not, a genui11e thriller. And, it tries to get into tile primal emotion:s that motivate us, but just doesn't quite make it.

Term Abroad Troubles The recent posting ()f term abroad lists which left many students · unhappy and confused is a dear sign of problems with the current term abroad policies. One of President Hull's main issues is the importance of the term abroad to the college experience. In fact, he even went so far as to say that he would like to see a 100% term abroad participation rate. However, this desire is far from becoming a reality at Union. programs should they go on? Behind the issue of terms abroad lies a problem--the decision of where to go ancl which school to go with. The incredible popularity of other schools' programs makes this decision even harder. Additionally, it is problematic when students choose non- Union programs because it takes money away from Union. Therefore, Union has to be extremely restrictive when deciding whether to allow students to go away through other schools. This restrictiveness is understandable in light of the financial implications; however, it leaves one question to be answered-- if Union students cannot go on other schools' programs~ what The problem is that there are not enough spaces on Union's programs to the popular places (Florence, Italy or Bath, England for example). Many students signed up for these programs after being told not to apply to other scll<>ols, only to be put on long waiting lists. The programs have become so competitive because of Union's monopoly on its studert:ts' terms abroad, that most students wil:l not go on term abroad at aU. The students that have now been rejected (or wait-listed behind dozens of others) from Union's prepams are too late to apply to other schools. This situation is unf()rtunate for both the school, who has set t~rrns abroad as a high priority, and the students who will not be able to experience a term abroad. It is important that some kind of change is made S() that mote students can be accommodated in the future, ideally by opening more tenns abroad to popular places. Editorial Implicating Student Forum Unfounded To the Editor: For the third week in a row the Student Forum has been the target of ill-informed criticism. My first instinct was to ignore it on the basis of its inaccuracy, but the time has come to respond. Last week's editorial implicating the Student Forum as unrepresentative of the students' interests is unfounded. In the fall term, I Wt-ote The Weekly Student Spotlight \in an effort to keep them up to date on current issues.\ At the request of a Concordiensis editor, this job was given to a reporter. This reporter attended one or two meetings and stopped reporting. As a result, there has been no Student Forum Spotlight since. Do not blame the Forum for your negligence in this area. Accepting our \responsibility of serving those who elected (us),\ the Forum issued a comprehensive survey to all students concerning the Gmelch report last term. This report is of great student concern because it addresses all residence life issues. 300 surveys were returned. This data was analyzed by computer and used to represent the student's voice in the Student Mfairs Council. Our efforts to represent the students' views do not stop with surveys. On Tuesday the 18th, the sophomore class had a very well advertised meetimg. Forty-five people attended. The remaining class representatives will hold meetings this week. Further, advertisements for last Thursday's Form meeting were posted in the College Center, all dorms and each academic building. No one attended this meeting~ not even the author of this past week's editorial. Had you researched your opinion prior to expressing it you would have known of these plans. Most important, a resolution was passed at this meeting that made it mandatory for the class representatives to hold two well advertised class meetings each term. This issue was on the Forum's meeting agenda before your article was printed. So much for your implication \that these entities do not want input from the· campus community.\ There h.as traditionally been a relative!} poor response to the Forum's open meetings and surveys. Undoubtedly, the Forum will continue to solicit the opinions of the students because it is our responsibility. Contrary to the implications of last week's editorial, efforts are being made by the Forum to express the interests of the Union students. Sincerely, . Brendan Clifford Sttident Forum President New Tradition For Commencement To the Editor: This year the Commencement Committee is beginning a new tradition by holding a Baccalaureate Service on the Saturday afternoon preceding the commencement exercises. Traditionally, a baccalaureate service is religious, with the purpose of sending a blessing to the graduates. To better serve the needs of the Union community, we have decided to focus the service on a more philosophical level, allowing the graduating seniors a time to reflect on and express their feelings about their last four years. The service will include music. readings, and personal reflections by graduating senior~. This ceremony is f<Jr graduates and their families and will be organized solely by students. Because this process is also new to us and our purpose is to serve you, we need as much student input as possible, If you are interested in planning or participating in the ceremony, please contact Roselle (346-028.9) or Karen (346-6502) or any commencement committee members. We will have a planning meeting at the beginning of next term and everyone is encouraged to come.

Unfortunately, at this present moment I am incarcerated at Auburn. My reason for addressing you with this letter is of extreme importance. Prisonlife is very dangerous and lonely. Words can't begin to express the degree that this unnatural environment has had on my sense of well being. Therefore, I hope that I'm not imposing upon you by asking, would you please place my name, number and location in your scllool newspaper for the explicit purpose of corresponding with people in the real world. I am young, educated, religious, and human- minded. Furthermore, your assistance concerning this matter would be greatly appreciated. Thank you. Mr. D. Ealey 8970696A4-5 135 State St. Auburn, NY 13021 Senior Class Meeting, Today @ 3:30 in CC410 Back To The Basics To the Editor: Last week's editorial entitled \Who Knows?\ discussed a very important issue, that of communication. The editor, however, failed to address a very important, closely related issue which is critical in achieving the amount of communication the edito:r allegedly wants. This is an issue that Concordiensis !las failed to consider in their own activities. Trust is the necessary quality to whicll 1 refer. Along with otiie:r accusations, the editor claims that ambiguity in communication is prevalent among those in charge of the college's finances. However, communication is worthless a you cannot rely on the honesty and the validity of what i£ being communicated. Tbe elected officials' countles:; hours of extra work to try to appropriately represent the people who elected them tum out to be futile when an organization or club deliberately closes their ears to the people who are trying to work with them and uses manipulative methods to get what they want. The responsibilities of the finance committee have not, ill any sense, been neglected. It is the responsibility of the poople in charge of finances to ensme that the student's money is spent responsibly and in the manner for which it was allocated. The repercussiom oJ this responsibility beiilg unfulfilled are severe. As the editor should well know, if an organization deliberately overspends, the student bo<iy suffers. Limited funds which were allocated for otll.e:r organizations and events can no longer be used for tll()se purposes. When clubs or organizations deliberately manipulate the system and the people who run it, procedures which were designed to benefit the students can no longer be used. Every decision must be second guessed and the administration loses all faith in the student body's ability to act responsibly. Something which the elected officers have worked very hard to attain. The editor says the solution for the communication problem \must start with the basics.\ Maybe the editor should reevaluate her concept of the\basics.\ Is not communication within your own organization \basic\ to communication as a whole? When the chief lea4ers of an organization cannot even communicate with each other and other members enough to organize an efficient billing system, spend a couple of hours writing up a coherent proposal for the purchase of new equipment, or appear at meetings meant to rectify crisis situations. how can they expect to even attempt to communicate with the rest of the college community, much less outside of Union's gates? The qualities of honesty and trust should also be one of the primary objectives of a liberal arts college. Unfortunately, in some parts of Union, they are not. The Finance Committee has worked especially hard this year to communicate with students and meet the needs of the student body as a whole. It is a shame that our efforts have been sidetracked by this lack of trust and honesty. Sincerely, Elisabeth Foley Vice President of Finance to the Student Forum Someth1ng -co Lh1nk A.bour.? I just wanted to share a \revelation\ with you guys.

Pub· Plights In light of recent controversy surrounding the construction. of a campus pub, the idea to institute the establishment on a trial basis is the best one yet. However, if a decision is made to go ahead with the plan, a few very significant issues must be addressed. Whi!le the college community very much enjoys the College Center building, it is not clear that construction of a pub in its atrium would be welcomed with open armi After all, one of the primary reasons students feel so confined at Union is that there is no place to go on campus aside from the College Center. Many feel that the structure is already used in an excessive capacity. Moreover, there is a great deal of unused campus space. Perhaps it has come time to expand our horizons. Another issue concerns funding. Clearly, the school cannot justify spending money on a pub when there are buildings falling down and a deficiency of books in the Schaffer Library. The Student Forum needs to seek funds from alternative sources. Yet, these are merely two of the factors in question. In short, although the pub can make a fine addition to student life at Union College, the aforementioned issues need to be C()nquered before implementation becomes an irreversible reality. ··. ·. · ·.· .· .. ; :. :. · · · · ... · · ·.. . · · :_·- .... ·· .. · · ... ·• ·.· .•. · ·-:~T·&·.: · a.·li' ... ·.·· . · . , .. ·· · · : · · . . · · · .. · . '1EI 111'••111 llW .. · Location of Maniacs Concert Absurd To the Editor: The decision to hold the 10.000 Maniacs concert in the Memorial Chapel is absolutely absurd! The original excitement that tile \1 0,000 Maniacs Coming to Union\ article gave me quickly vanished as I proceeded to read the ludicrous restricticns that a ticket holder is expected to abide by. These guidelines bring many images to my mind. One is that a straightjacket will be given to you when you buy yom ticket and it must be worn to get into the show. As a friend of mine commented, \Would they also like us oo dress semi-formal?\ If the provided \guidelines\ are meant as friendly suggestions in order to make the gig equally enjoyable for all of th.ose around us. then we should all try to keep them in mind. However, if they are intended to be strictly enforced, then tllere is still a month and a half oo revise them. The administrations' main concerns regarding outdoor concerts are that they are uncontrollable and that too many off-campus people are attracted (each of which results in liability). However, a 10,000 Maniacs concert by no means persuades uncontrollable actions such as slamdancing or fights. With collaboration between the committee and the administration, the attendance by non-Union \undesirables\ could effectively be conttolled. The combination of inadequate standing room \Jetween pews in Memorial Chapel and the prohibition of \dancing in the aisles\ will result in the destruction of a potentially outstanding show. This will also increase unneeded student-student and student-security tension. The very words of the concert planners provide the best argument against their decision - \remember this is a chapel, and it must be treated as such.\ Obviously, a chapel is no place for such an outstanding rock hmd! With this realization, the concert committee and the administration should be realistic and allow an outdoor show. The logical indoor site (in case of rain) should be Achilles Rink (the ice is melted in late March) which would be much more accommodating for such an event. The stimulating musical and behavioral environment that the Maniacs provide Should be respected, and the students should be allowed to make the most of it. The expressive freedom of the Union students should not be strangled and suppressed in any way, especially musically. My praise goes to the concert committee for bringing tile Maniacs to Union. However, the decision to hold the concert in Memorial Chapel has disappointed many students. There is time to mod~fy the arrangements and I am optimistic that an alternative will be found.

As for the anti-Semitic and anti-American remarks the writers seem to have provoked (I'll ignore the one about being told they were \worth a lot of camels\ - that was a JOKE, guys, surely you're not THAT naive?), I can only say that as a Jew living in a predominantly Muslim country, I always Top Ten From Spain abundance of oil; fried food is big over here.

Let the Party Begin ... German Fasching by Larae Tumidajewicz International P eatures Editor Last Friday evening the International House was quiet, that is, untH the Fasching celebration had gotten underway. Fasching is one of the most important holidays in German culture. It is a kind of Mardi Gras party. The German club and the Internationai House sponsored this event which was held at the International House. Christina Huer, the German teaching assistant, served as the hostess and master chef, preparing for the guests a fine assortment of German foods, including German sausages and bread. Karsten Contag, an exchange stud~nt from Berlin, did a magnificent job decorating the House with balloons, colorful streamers, and of course ticker-tape from Germany. Midway through the party, most of the guests ventured to put on lots of creative face paints and decorations. This made for lots of laughter, especially when one German GMI student entered the party in a straw hat and huge floppy cl()wn shoes. - Then the guests were randomly given numbers. Each group of people had to prepare to act out a scene of a play. The main idea of the play is that two people play husband and wife. After a brief discussion of how much tlley love one another and \would certainly die without them\ one person goes shopping to return home to a dead spouse. First, Mike Morin along with a friend from Russell Sage College played a husband who read the paper and ignored all else that went on around him, with constant comments of \Yes dear\ to his wife's attempts at conversation. Even when ·his screaming brat children played by Christina Huer and Hiroko Nakano wanted to \eat pizza with mayonnaise\ this excellently portrayed father figure didn't budge. He returns home from shopping, and to his sul]lrise after shoving away his annoying kids sees his wife's body slumped over in the chair next to him. His only reaction-what else, he took her food and chowed down. Nex( came an interesting interpretation of this scene. Karsten, Gaby (the Mexican teaching assistant), Evan, and Vera (a German student from Sage) sat quietly in a circle. Proceeding with their version of love in the 90's, Evan turns to Gaby and says \Do you love me?\ She looks to Karsten and asks him if he really loves her. He moves to his right and questions, Vera about the strength of her love. The play continues in this circular fashion, building up to ... \You don't love me, so l have to kill you.\ One girl .kills the other girl. The circular talks continue until the other girl says \You don't love me! But which one do I kill?\ Thus, she concludes it is best to just take her life and get out of the mess. Finally, the two men take the gun also, and blow themselves away. A thrilling performance ... what better than a love triangle, but a love square! This was followed by an unmentionable resident of International Hol!sc playing the sweet wife of Yang Quain, a GMI student from China. She questions his love while sitting alone at home in a romantic setting. Suddenly he jumps up and savs he has to sm. To rlo what? To play hockey, what else? He takes off and she dies in an all out dramatic faint. He comes back home and calls for his wife to open the door. When her dead body is unable to answer his manly call, he complains and has to use his key. Upon finding his wife's body, he cries out, \Oh well, I didn't love her anyway!\ She jumps up, he is in total shock, and that unfaithful creep of a man has a heart attack. Finally Eric Andrews played the husband of psychotic wife played by LaraeTumidajewicz. After returning home from therapy to an \Al Bundy-like\ husband, the wife goes through strange outbursts of \I don't know nothing about birthing no babies ... \ to \But honey, I don't want to be Rudolpho Losparri from Polermo, Sicily ... \ Then she cuddles up for an intimate moment, asking about the faithfulness of her man's love, when the doorbell rings two times. \It must be the postman ... the postman always rings twice.\ exclaims the wife. Then she tells the mailman that their affair must come to an end and returns to her husband with a note, \E.T. Phcne Home.\ The husband is confused and rushes out the door. The wife hangs on as he walks cut on her, and dramatically falls to the ground.

He nudges her, and despite her ticklish squeems, she really was dead. The mailman, played by Philipp Herz, a German GMI student, calls out, \Is there a doctor in the house.?\ A Russell Sage student from their German language house played the doctor, acting out a few lines from Star Trek. Then the husband returns. \Oh you are that husband, I've heard a lot about y<Ju,\ exclaims the mailman. The husband is annoyed at this and appears to want to fight for his wife's honor, but the mailman has already made other plans as leaves for a night on the town with the sexy doctor. The husband concludes with an allusion to Casablanca, \Oh well,_ we'D always have Paris.\ Following these somewhat ridiculous, but mostly hilarious plays, we danced (at least we tried to dance) to some Ge:nnan music.

CONCORDIENSIS • FEBRUARY 27, 1992 • PAGE 14 \You Could Really Get Off!'' by Andrew R. Rosen Concordiensis Staff Some of the more masochistic studeats on this campus elect to give themselves class at 8:45 am on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday morning throughout Winter Term - a rather iffy decision at best. Many of these same students do not have class until 11:15 that same morning. For the approximately one hour and twenty minutes that sometimes perpetually elapses, the College Center becomes a frustrating stadium filled with those unable to feed an obvious hunger for the time fillers: there's not enough time to constructively study and yet there exists too much time to just sit around. What ensues is what I like to cal1 \The Black Hole\ while others aptly refer to this period of conversational doldrums as \The Breakfast Club.\ Even those students not gifted with this blessed time fall into similar chronological niches as those \experts\ above. Something must shatter this monotony. I sat amongst five of my fellow \Holers\ wondering: Why didn't E.T. bring some of his buddie-s back to earth to kick some goyernment ass? What ever happened to Chuck, the oldest Cunningham during the old \Happy Days\? Are the Wallbergs really twins? What would happen if every salt shaker in the College Center had a hidden microphone underneath it? Despite my apparently obvious boredom, I began to notice things; habits and customs that began to beguile me. It was if there was a magic around me - a heavy magic, a hungry magic, an enchanted magic. Again, my experienced and usually trenchant friend Kathleen so eloquently stated, \You could really get off! You could write about everyone else and what they're talking about.\ Stimulating, to say the least. A light gait through the College Center exposed myself to many fine habits and interesting means o:f filling the Black Hole. For example, amongst the tremendous foliage all around tile College Center are those unknowing souls looking for something to occupy their time. They first do one or two perimeters about the Dutch Hollow area, hoping to locate a classmate, a friend, a fraternity or sorority sibling or, at the very least, someone remotely cognizant of their existence. These \roamers\ go from table to table, over to the cash machine - the weak hearted usually walk away with twenty or thirty bucks- and at the very least they will check their mail box three to four times within a given sixty- minute period. Now I'm no Cliff Claven; but how much mail is going to suddenly \appear\ in one hour? Some folk fortunate enough to have the appropriate answering machine will chance waking their roommate up (if they have one) for the sake of checking said machine for any messages. Unfortunately, I succumb to these tempestuous acts myself. As I roamed one Wednesday morning, I began to absorb that which was surrounding me. I began my slow journey simply looking up, noticing a glowing red neon light blasting \Cabaret\ through my cornea - a light that has probably been on since July 3,. 1987; it must be costing the school upwards of 41 cents per minute just to illuminate it (by my calculations, that would add up to 2,440,800 minutes - a total cost of $1,000,728). It's a cool sign, though. As I enter and quickly exit the video game center (unfortunately now devoid of a pool table I personally never used) I look to the area bilaterally situated across \the pit\ opposite this computerized haven. There's usually four to seven bodies pounding away at the books - obviously, there folk are not \Holers.\ I stare, of course, and ask a rather obvious question: Do these people actually get anything constructive done? Can they claim to pack tlleir study skills despite the pounding murmur in the background? (On a side note: for small 'Crowds of 30 or more people, sit in a fairly sized room and on the count of three, everyone turn to the person next to you and repeatedly say \rhubarb rhubarb . . .. \ According to J. Michael Stipe of R.E.M., this will almost exactly mimic the sound I'm referring to. Moving south, towards the elevator, I discover a coat rack I never knew existed. Surprisingly, there's one coat on a hanger and I felt satisfied that rack had been put to good use. The new neon clock - could this be the college getting somewhat vogue? - lends that \Hard Rock Cafe\ look to the area - not! At least the time is accmate. Just to get the most ou1 of my own tuition dollar, 1 sat underneath that coat rack and felt hung. Continuing south past the old information booth towards the new information booth, I realize that someone is always selling something in the College Center. Be it theater tickets, puzzles, boxers, shirts, drugs or computers, there is always a sale tQ be made. And what about the \new\ information booth? Is it now better situated to handle flower deliveries and on-campus phone calls for those occluded from using the plethora of courtesy phones? The \old\ information with its state-of-the-art computer message board now sits idle, awaiting that freak, isolated power outage that may in fact render ,the \new\ info booth useless. At this point, the proverbial fork in the road presents itself. One may browse through the bookstore (upstairs or downstairs, one may check their mail again, go to the bathroom, get a drink, a breath of fresh air or study the omniprese11 t \rides needed/offered\ board opposite the stairs in regard to any other, more nG ticeable message board. Perso11a.lly, I simply stare in disdain as the \out of change\ light on the stamp machine just k:ept on blinking. After chec:king my mail again, I malce it past the Dutch Hollow Restawant successfully without baying anything. I return to my :seat of origin to find the group has not changed, only the con\Versation. Many have drinks and bagels or muffins bef<Jr.e them, destined to evaporate or go uneaten - gratuitous J>Urchases made for the sake of just that: a purchase. Atul the total amount of these p11rchases is always frustrating. I know the Dutch Hollow can't help it if they have to pass on the sales tax to us as consumers, but you'd think they'd price ,their items so the total isn't always $1.03. I never carry change and I always find myself reaching into the counter-top penny cup, hoping there are three miserable cents. The industrious one, \thesorically\ speaking, Jeffrey Alan Googel commented on the always challenging choice of muffin purchase, preaching, \Usually I go blueberry or corn muffin, but they have an underrated carrot muffin up there.\ Jeff and many others are regular now. Hidden inside the minds .of all those pretending to read the New York Times while they ·people watch are the hopeful dreams that a solid pub will exist on this campus where one can go to have a cold beer at 10:30 in the morning and socialize with yo11r campus mates and tutors. As \Holers we have nothing to be ashamed of. We should accept the challenge and seek out new time-consuming activities that req_uire minimalist thinking. Last year, we could watch generals and pilots explain the Gulf War to us on CNN every day. Now we- or at least I- sit underneath a coat rack and stare at people. There are .pFobably far better things I can do in my room for that hour. I'm just too lazy to go there. ~lbanp l.atu ~tbool All Seniors (and Juniors) who are considering the possibility of attending Albany Law School are invited to attend an open house at the law school on the afternoon of March 3. The schedule includes the opportunity to attend a class at 2 p.m., followed by a tour of the school and a reception. Those who would like to attend should sign up in the political science office by February 24.

Skolnik Features Editor I was not planning on writing an article this week, however, I happened to encounter a \revelation\ (at least a thought) that I wanted to share. After class today I decided to head on over to the college center to check my mailbox (what an original thought! . When I reached my box (no .sexual ,connotations, please!) that is box #1590 (not it's real #) I felt great anxiety to the point that I could not even open it. I stepped back for a moment and took a deep breath and thought about what was causing this distress. I remembered that I should be hearing from graduate schools any da-y now and that fhe acceptance/rejection letters may be in this 7\x2\ space. Next 1 wondered what I would do if there happened to be these fatefullettersin my box and if they were there what would I do whh them? Would I open them immediately? Would I &it down at a remote table and open these important letters'? Or would I run to the bathroom and rip them open? WeU, needless to say, all that was in my box was \air mail\ bu.t one of these days those letters will surface and when they do I will have to make a choice. A typical Union College • student is estimated to go to 'llis mail box 924 times withiu their four years at Union (7 days a week 11 weeks a tenn = 77 times a term x 12 terms. Yes I know people go S times a day but![ figure terms abroad and Sundays cancel tbis Dllt-- whatever!! l!!) and I suppose the amount of mail a student receives varies. The focm; ·Of my thought is not about 11ow much or how little mail a student receives but what kind of mail one receives. The mailbox is really very symbolic when one stops to reflect on it; .through this dusty hole one may experience great joy and sorrow. But the esse11ce of these emotions originate from different sources vis a vis one's academic year. Freshman year one's rnail box was u:sed as an excuse to to to the College Center and socialize. The type of mail sent to fresbme;n ranged from daily letters from Mom and Dad to lengthy letters from high school friends. Of course the catalogues, junk mail, etc ... was included; but the point to be made here is that the freshman box is a new and exciting one and not exposed to any official or detrimental mail. The sophomore mail is basically the same as the freshman but less mail from Mom and Dad and from friends but hope for better mail still exists. However, by the end of sophomore year the mail starts to get \heavier for terms abroad letters and other official acceptances/rejection type mail can begin to develop. To be honest witll you I don't really recall junior except post cards and air mail letters from friends in better places than I was. At this point in my college career I don't expect any social mail except at my birthday (but even that isn't realistic any more but the mail that is going to appear is going to Featly change my life, whether it be a letter from a job or school or any random .program. It may just be me, but I really do stress out about going to my mail box and it is not because I am afraid of running into anyone spedfic but the antagonist source is now my mail. Once I get posi ti vc responses, perhaps this 1:car will be removed. But I do believe that I will miss box #1590 (not my real box) and whenever I am in town I will check in on it, but for now it will serve as the waiting room for my future.

The team must win two of its remaining three games to insure a ten victory season. Coach Bill Scanlon has never won less than ten games in his previous 18 years as the Dutchmen's head coach. His last under ten win team played in the 78-79 campaign. If the Dutchmen can pull out three wins to end the season they will match their record of two years ago when they were 11- 14. Union's injury problems continued lat week as starting center Greg Dolan went down in the loss to RPI with an ankle injury. DC>lan missed the two following games against Skidmore and Nazareth. Freshman Mark Stodden has moved up to the starting spot and has responded well. In Thursdays loss to Skidmore he was the team's top rebounder with five. In the Dutchmen's win over Nazareth on Saturday he scored twelve points while pulling down six rebounds and blocking three shots. Those tllree blocks also put Stodden up to 56 on the year breaking ~the nine year old record of 54 :blocks in a season by Ken D'Orazio. Union's win on Saturday was .their first in the last six games. The Dutchmen started out rather slow in the first half allowing Nazareth to take a ten-point advantage in the first five minutes of the game. Down 18-8 Union went on a 12-4 run to cut the Nazareth lead to only 2 points with ten minutes remaining in the half. Union forced 15 turnovers in the first half but were unable to take the lead at all and were down by one 39-38 at the half. The second half of the game was close for 15 minutes and the Dutchmen were up 61-59 with only 5:24 remaining. Union then scored nine straight JlOints and went up 70-59 with 1:40 on the clock. Nazareth tried to foul but Union converted enough of its free throws to hold on ru1d win 75- 65. The win gave Union its present 8-14 record and dropped Nazru;eth to 9-16 .. GregQuirolo played an outstanding game scoring 20 points while handing out 5 assists. Ken Evans scored 15 points and Mark Stodden, Luther Winfield and Sam Poulis scored l2, 11 and 10 points respectively. Sam Poulis led an rebou:nders with 9. Luther Winfield also had 10 assists to raise his team-leading total to 101 for the year. Last Thursday the Dutchmen lost to Skidm()re 63-57. Jamie Donigan had a big game for Union scoring 19 points. Winfield and Poulis both had 7 assists in that game. Ken Evans and Poulis shared the scoring honors with 10 apiece in Union's 82-67 loss to RPI last Tuesday. Poulis also had 7 rebounds in that game. Union will finish UJl this weekend on .the road at St. Lawrence on Friday and at Clarkson on Saturday. Union Skiers Shine At Easterns Continued from page 20 boards fearlessly down the g.s. trail and turned in an impressive seventeenth place overall for the Dutchmen. Livingston came in second for the Dutchmen and twenty- seventh overall, while rookie \Ladies and Gentleman\ Brooks Glahn placed thirty-seventh overall. Captain Jeremy Sollinger turned in a solid first run, but fell victim in the second run to the steep, icy pitch. Frosh Josh \Willnot\ Kane also was a first run casualty. After the giant slalom, the women stood in sixth place, while the men had a firm hold on seventh. While they were not completely eliminated from the competition, the notion of posing a challenge to qualify for the nationals was a Iongshot. On Saturday, the women (LOT's), competed in the slalom. Landa finished first for the Boardwomen and fifteenth overall. She was followed by Sush Foley I who in the final NCSA race of her illustrious career finished twenty-sixth. Patnode followed by finishing third for the womea and thirty- fourth overall. Betsy \Mumbles Mitchell\ placed fourth for the team and fifty- second overall I while non- slalom specialist Julie Jamieson finished fifth for the Dutchwomen. The stellar performance of Union's top three finishers, Landa, Foley, and Patnode pushed the women into fifth place for the weekend, one spot shy of a National Championship bid. On Sunday, the men's team attacked the hill and came away with a result that even had the usual cool, calm and collective Coach Jim Schaeffer reeling. The rookie sensation duo of Denise and Glahn both recorded amazing results for the day and carried the Dutchmen to a second place finish in the slalom. Denise finished the fifth place overall, while Glahn recorded an eleventh place result. part of the youth movement of the Union Ski Team, both racers sent messages to the Northeast that Union is a team to watch out for in the future. Livingston after a very strong first run, skied a clean second nm and provided the irnportan t third place finish that the team needed in on1er to challenge for a top spot in the race. With Livingston's nineteenth place result, the Boardmen were able to place three skiers in the top twenty of the race. Junior Josh Goldberg skiing for \Team Attack From The Back\ turned in a solid first run, and an even more impressive crash in the second run. Slosh's crash was one of many that were witnessed during Sanday's slalom. The weekend was a dramatic success for both the men and women. Instead of using this final paragraph to sum up what I have already stated in the article, I will jast share a few thoughts on the season. The friendship and community that was formed on the slopes, in the cheezy hotels, and during the van rides is something that I will always remember. Of course, thanks to Schaeff for providing the commitment, inspiration, and support that made the season so successful and enjeyable.

Skating Dutchmen Stun Cornell 6-4 Upset Victory Rocks ECAC by Dan Strum Sports Editor The Union Hockey team has had quite an interesting season. It has been a year of uncertainty, a year of hard work, a year powered by emotion. For many players it has been a tough battle. The increased competition and competitiveness in the ECAC has not provided Union with many bright spots this season. However, an effort like the one ~> }~;; brought forth this weekend can make up for most of the hard times. For their solid efforts throughout the past weekend and the entire season, the Union Hockey team has been selected as Concordiensis Sports Athletes of the Week. Unless one has had the good fortune to visit Lynah Rink in Ithaca, NY, he cannot truly appreciate the full allure and atmosphere surrounding the Cornell Hockey tradition. It is perhaps on the same level as, let's say, Syracuse basketball. Cornell boasts the best hockey fans in the East. They have great cheers, a loud band, and a feeling one gets of big-time athletics. All things considered, the Skating Dutchmen were big underdogs coming into Saturday's game. Union was trounced by Cornell 8-1 in their first meeting at Achilles Rink. Now the Dutchmen had to face a raucous crowd of 3,822 fans who would be jeering at anything wearing Garnet. Even Bob Hussar had to dodge some stray insults. However, there was Dalton Menhall celebrating at center ice, a symbol which will stick in many people's minds. He had scored two big goals leading Union to a 6-4 upset victory over Cornell. Union finally had the chance to smile at whatever the Big Red fans had to say. The Skating Dutchmen carried the celebration into the locker room. Goalies Luigi Villa turned in a fine performance with 26 saves. This young freshman added his sentiments on how it was good to win a big game giving the seniors a lasting memory of Union Hockey. \When I see the look on a Dalton Menhall's face, or ECAC LEAGUE & OVERALL STANDINGS Team W-L-T PTS GF GA OVERALL Harvard 13-1-6 32 88 51 14-4-6 Clarkson 14-5-1 29 94 57 20-7-1 St.Lawrence 13-6-1 27 97 64 17-9-2.

It was great to see that they got a win on their final road trip.\ The en tire team deserves credit for their performance. They kept their poise and held firm in many tenuous situation. Uncharacteristically, Union opened up the game with two goals to build a 2-0 lead. Cornell stormed back with two goals of their own to tie the game. However, Union stayed calm and recaptured the lead less than a minute later on a goal by Cory Holborough. Holborough's second goal of his Union career gave Union a \Emotion is the key word,\ Menhall said. \I had so much emotion, I didn't know what to d().\ 3-2 lead heading into the tb.ird period. After the Big Red had tied the score once again at 3-3, the Skating Dutchmen carne up big on the power play. At 13:55 of the third period, Bill Railton jammed the puck home off a Chris Albert feed to give Union the lead for good. Menhall had the final two goals for Union capping his two-goal and one-assist effort. Railton contributed well with his goal and three assists. Once again Fererro was in the thick of things as he added a goal and two assists. For his efforts, Fererro was awarded with ECAC Player of the Week honors. Coach Bruce Delventhal will look to keep chach alk by John Schachnevsky Associate Sports Editor Get your calendars student body, and mark tomorrow and Saturday nights down as taken. Because without exception, everybody on campus tomorrow and Saturday nights should be at Achilles Rink for our Skating Dutchmen's final two hockey games of the season. There is no e:xcuse for missing them. I realize I am diverging from my usual national sports topic ... but this is too important to pass up. There are many reasons why one should make the two hockey games this weekend as important not to miss as their own wedding. Arriving on this campus four short years ago was a recruit class like no other. Without naming names, due to possible deletion of players tl:tat have since left the team or the college, I would like to praise and thank these players for their gutsy play and demeanor on campus throughout my three years at Union. If some fans have not seen these players play, however frightening that thought is, they should watch them against Yale and Princeton this weekend. These seniors have brought a color to the Union community that has been able to shine bright even through this rocky first year in the ranks of Division I hockey. It is impossible to look at this team without mentioning the goaltenders. Luigi Villa and Mike Gallant are a treat to watch. Keeping the team in games that otherwise might have gotten ugly has been their trademark throughout this season. The thought of these two playing here for three more years has to put a smile on the the extremely potent line of Menhall, Railton, and Ferrero intact for this weekend's games against Princeton and Yale. Penalty Killing has been one of Union's weak points throughout the season. However, this weekend the Skating Dutchmen managed to step it up a notch as they held Colgate to only one goal in seven chances and Cornell to only one goal in nine chances. This special team effort was one of the main reasons for Union's success in Ithaca. In addition, Union's offensive output was quite impressive seeing that Cornell's face of the many Dutchman faithful. The rest of the team has also put in a valiant cff ort throughout the 91-92 campaign. However, I am not the team's salesman ... and I shouldn't have to be. Not going to these two games is sinful. These guys have put forth a great effort this season. For the not-so-experienced sports fan, the task they undertook was labeled insurmountable by many. The team could have easily lollygagged through the season, but this did not happen. They fought tooth and nail every game, looking for and eventually accomplishing their main goal getting their first points and soon thereafter, first win in the ECAC. This team not only needs our support through this final weekend but they deserve it. Missing these games without a good reason is selfish. AU year this team has fought batrles on the ice with UNION on their jerseys; the least we as a student can do is give them one last weekend of support. Not the kind of support they received most of the year, I mean real support...Division I support. You sec it in the paper but spread the word ... EVERY STUDENT AND FAN OF UNION SHOULD WEAR WHITE TO THE GAME TO SHOW THE REST OF THE ECAC WE ARE UNION AND WE'RE DAMN PROUD OF IT. If you have felt bad about missing all or some of the games this year, make up for it this weekend. If you did not get tickets yet, suck up the cost and pay for them ... trust me, the Dutchmen won't disappoint!!! netminder, Parris Duffus. was the third leading goaltender in the ECAC. In other notes, Senior Bill Railton needs only two points to join Union's Century Club. He currently has 43 goals and 55 assists for 98 points. Please show your support for the Dutchmen in this their final weekend. They have worked hard all season and as a faithful fan, it is your duty to snow- them your appreciation.

Olnnrorbirnsis FEBRUARY 27, 1992 Union Ski Team Shines At Eastern Championships by J. D. Sollinger Concordirmsis Staff The Union College Men's and Women's Ski Team put themselves on the collegiate ski map for years to come after last weeks sparkling performance at the National Collegiate Ski Association Eastern Regional Champion- ships. Held at Waterville Valley Ski Resort, in New Hampshire, the championship race consisted of the top eighteen teams in the Northeast. Each team was shooting for the same goal of finishing among the top four teams in the race, which would ultimately qualify them to represent the Northeast Region at the National Ski Championships. For the Union team, just qualifying for .the Eastern's was a monumental accomplishment. The men's team, who in past years had been plagued by inconsistent skiing, finished second overall in the regular season Adirondack division. The women also finished second in their league in their regular season. Despite these impressive performances, no one expected that the Union Boardmen would perform so well at the Eastern Championships. The women finished in fifth place for the This Week In HOCKEY Friday February 28 vs. Princeton Saturday, February 29 vs. Yale WEAR WHITE!! weekend, while the men, after a phenomenal performance in Sunday's slalom, tied for folllth place. However, due to the NCSA tie breaker system, the men were edged out by Green Mountain College for the fourth spot to the National Championships. On Friday. February 21, the Giant Slalom was held on Waterville's Sel's Choice Pitch. A trail that is raced on by World Cup skiers, this run proved to be much steeper, longer, and more challengi11g than any course that the Dutchmen had seen all season. Junior Sean Livingst(}n summed it up well when he exclaimed, \I don't think my lungs or cardiovacular condition is prepared for this.\ Despite the challengillg conditions, the Union skiers performed well and rose to the occasion. For the women, rookie Liz Landa led the way for the Dutchwomen, as she has all year. After a freestyle first run in which she managed to catch some solid air, Landa settled down and finished sixteenth overall on the course. Captain Beth Foley followed Landa by placing second for Union and twenty-sixth overall. Frosh Briana \RPl\ Patnode finished third for the Boardwomen and thirty-third overall. Junior Julie Jamieson followed close behind by recording her most impressive result of the season by placing fourth for the Dutchwomen and thirty-fourth overall. Nicole \B Suit\ Zamansky rounded <>ut the Union five and finished fortieth on the course.

Union took third out of 18, boasting great depth, awesome upfront strength, and amazing drops in personal best times. The Union swimmers got off to a great start when in the first event, Julie Benker, Kelly Bevan, Jeanne Cutrone, and Amy O'Neill placed first in the preliminaries in the 200 yard medley relay with a pool record time of 1:51.06. In the finals for that event, Union took second, but in an NCAA- qualifying time of 1:50.66. That set the stage for a flurry of Union swimmers qualifying for nationals. Both Benker and Anne Glicksman qualified in the 200 backstroke, O'Neill in the 50 freestyle, Benker in the 100 backstroke, and Bevan had previously qualified in the 200 breaststroke. The story of the meet on Union's bench was how many personal best times were recorded across the board. showing the team's depth. The whole team contributed, not only the swimmers already mentioned. Jenn Terrell, for example, was seeded 18th in the 50 breast, 13th in the 100 breast, and 27th in the 200 breast. She improved three seconds and 14 places to 4th in the 50, three seconds and nine places to 4th in the 100, and 12 seconds and 15 places to 12th in the 200. Jen Baldwin did much the same, seeded 15th in the 100 fly, 19th in the 50 free, and 25th in the 100 free. She dropped two seconds and seven places to 8th in the 100 fly, one second and 12 places to 7th in the 50 free, and two seconds and 16 places to 11th in the 100 free. Cutrone got her best in the 100 fly, just missing nationals by 0.21 seconds. The 500 freestyle was one of the best by 11 seconds, and Kerstin Dorse and Kristi Campbell also had personal bests in the event. To go along with the 500, Rozwadowski placed 14th in ~e 100 back; Miller had her best time in the 50 free; Dorse placed third in the 400 individual medley (I.M.), and had her best times and placed in the 200 breast and 200 I.M. Erica Saltz improved by five seconds and 16 places to place 15th in the 200 I.M. Senior breaststrokers J enn Joyce and Heather Weckerle each had best times in both the 50 and 100 yard breaststroke, and each placed in the 50 breast. Tricia Ferucci had personal bests. in both the 50 free and 50 fly, and Melita Walsh places 12th in the 50 free while being part of the winning 200 free relay. The divers put on a show as well. After placing in the 100 I.M., Natasha Zabka took first in the three-meter competition and second in the one-meter competition, earning her outstanding diver at the meet honors. Kristi Holbrook took a solid sixth place in each diving event. As you can easily tell, every one of the Union swimmers showed determination and swam with everything they had. It was a full-team effort. and it was the culmination of a great season. For those who qualified, the women's NCAA met will be March 12-14 at Buffalo. The men's state meet is this weekend, February 27-29, at Hamilton, so take a road trip and come support the team! '' ' ~ : ',
