She received a grant worth $85,000 from a Pro- gressive Gennan Foundation in which she studied Official Tor- ture under military rule in Brazil from the years of 1964 to 1985. This study was in collaboration with a colleague who was study- ing greek torture in the period of military rule in Greece. Professor Huggins' main objec- tive was to study the mind oftor- ture. The study was done in se- crecy in which none of the tor- turers freely admitted that they tortured their victims. The re- search was performed in an elabo- rate way, the human rights had a list .of people that were de- nounced. From these lists, Huggins interviewed about 30 people. Her approach was not to let the torturers know that she was studying torture, rather that she was trying to find information on the military system of rule and government. If she told them that she was researching torture, the people would not agree to being interviewed or exposed, although the government of Brazil gave them amnesty (in which the former torturers could not be tried in a court of iaw for past crimes). However, the fear of being ex- posed and having to remember past crimes was extremely pain- ful for most of these people. She interviewed people that felt they were exploited by their own gov- ernment. These people wanted a job in law enforcement, instead they became torturers and mur- derers. They worked by carrying around an \elaborate moral cal- culus.\ For example, if they had 2 hours to find the kidnappers of a certain victim, they believed that it would be to their benefit to tor- ture the suspect rather than inter- view him for two hours. 11tese ex-police, however, did believe that there was a good ·way and a bad way to torture people. If for example, you are under the influence of dmgs or alcohol theti Continued on page 6 on.cnrbicnsis The Student Newspaper of Union College Since 1817 Schenectady, New York Doug Bartell andSteplranie Kuelln will perform in Cllarles II tit is weekend (Josll Haines/TC) Parents' Weekend to Celebrate the Performing Arts at Union .by NaJini Gupta Concordiensis Staff The 1994 Bicentennial Par- ents' Weekend is guaranteed to f-e a blast.

On April 20-22, 1995, Union College will host the con- ference for the second time, the only college to do so from the northeast. NCUR invites undergraduates from all disciplines, including physical sciences, social sciences. arts and humanities, to present scholarly research at an annual conference. During the three day event, students give both oral and poster presentations, and speak- ers present as well. In 1987, the University of North Carolina at Asheville hosted the first conference. Some Union physics students generated an interest on campus, and ap- proximately twelve to fifteen stu- dents attended that year. Subse- quently, Professor David Peak of the Physics Department (cur- rently on sabbatical) became in- volved in the goveming board, and eventually became the chair- man. Because Union College had good visibility at previous confer- ences, the governing board asked Peak if Union would like to host the conference in 1990 after the University of Michigan had to decline from hosting. Union took this opportunity to prove itself as not only a capable host, but as an Colltilllled on page 3 President Hull Waits for Council, Community to Respond by David Levine & Elizabeth DeKoven Contributing Editors Despite recent turmoil, Presi- dent Roger Hull insists that Union College will continue to pursue a resolution to the G.E. Plot Con- troversy. l11e ordeal began three years ago, when the college approached residents ofthe G.E. Plot with a proposal to convert eight residen- tial homes owned by Union Col- lege into administrative offices. G11 August 29 ofthis year, the is- sue was fonnally addressed at a Schenectady City Council meet- ing. Some residents of the G.E. Plot argued in opposition of Union's proposed renovations of the Lenox Road properties. Hull, and other community leaders, also spoke at the Council Meet- ing. \The college needs space to maintain its momentum as a lead- ing edi.tcational institution and to protect the 685 people we em• ploy,\ said Hnll. \The college has not eliminated one position in four years.\ Index: Members of the community expressed concems over the en- vironmental impact of Union's proposed construction. Issues of importance include the violation of the single family zoning law, the possibility of an influx in traf- fic on Lenox Road, aesthetic changes to the community, and the decrease in the value of neigh- boring properties.

NEWS November 3, 1994, page 3 Professor Hilary Tann Wins Composing Award by Martin Metz Concordiensis Staff Last summer was a busy one for music professor/composer Hillary Tann. She returned in September, after having spent the stii'nmer in Wales as Composer- in-residence. One of her new pieces Wata 's !:'dgl! wa~ premiered and broatkast by BBC radio.. She was abo featured on Welsh Televisim1, and BBC Wales. Tann had three of her pieces commissioned and pre- miered by the Cardiff Festival. The pieces premiered were Water's Edge {for string orches- tra), 'l11e ( .'resset Stone, and With the Heather and S'mall Birds {based on Welsh poet John Ceirog Hughes poem about his longing for his homeland), which was pre- miered on September 17 by the European Women's Orchestra. This alone was a great accom- plishment, since it is highly un- usual for a composer to have three pieces premiered in such a short time-span. While Professor Tann was at the premier of With the Heather and Small Bird~ a man came up to her and handed her a little slip of paper with a note on it. The note said that she had won the l?eader '.\· Digest! Meet the Com- poser Consortium Cotnmission. This award, in the context of the .:utnposers arena, is a very pres- tigious one. Well-known com- poser Phillip Glass won the award \ a few years ago, and many other famous composers have been re- cipients oftheaward. Essentially, · what the award affords Tann is the cost of her composition time in order to commission a twenty- minute piece for orchestra to be played by six orchestras. The piece is to be completed by April I, 1995 and to be premiered on June 25. Professor Tann has enhtled her new piece \From Afar,\ and it is based on her recollection of J apa- nese music from her visit to Kansai Gaidai University in Ja- pan in the Fall of 1990.

' Campus Suffers Another Power Outage by Adrian MacLean Concordiensis Staff On a campus of over two thou- .sand people a power outage is inevitably going to cause confu- sion and inconvenience. Many people planned ahead for the out- age to be on Sunday, October 23, but due to technical complica- tions, it was chang~d to October 30. Saturday the 22 at about 3:30, moisture was found around the electrical work. The workmen were dealing with 15,000 volts of power, and this moisture could have potentially triggered a sig- nificant buming. The Nott Memorial and the Yulman theater are receiving new electrical power. In the back of the College Center there is brand new switch gear that will put most of the campus on a main frame. Union's cunent system is 4,000 volts of energy and it is being upgraded to 13,000 volts in this new system. The otttage was a major step in the completion of both the Y:tlman Theater and the Nott Memorial. Electricians had hoped to get everything done in yesterday's outage, but need to schedule one more shorter outage. This will most likely occur in the next two weeks. New heating, cooling and light- ing are being installed in the Nott and the TI1eater. There are quite a few tests that need to be done, but a significant amount ofelec- trical work must be completed first. \Until the electrical work is finished, we cannot test out the new systems,\ Capitol Projects Manager Steve Lamp said.

EUROPEAN SKIN CARE CENTERS LATHAM 664 New Loudon Road. 783·1988 NISKAYUNA Nott Place • 1475 Balttown Rd. 381·3915 There was power in the Alumni Gym, West College and the Field House because they are hooked up to a different frame than the rest of the college. Most of the other buildings on campus were shtif·down and in the dark during the l;;!st outage. Many calls were directed to campus security in hopes to get into the College Center. Memos were sent out to infonn everyone about the buildings that will be \affected.\ Many buildings were closed. \If they are going to close Dutch or the college center at anytime they should make other areas avail- able for us to get drinks and food at all times.!\ freshman Alicia Oathout said. According to head of security Paul Mantica, the reason for clos- ing the College Center was due to the fact that nobody was there. As a security precautiori, the officers on duty kept the College Center locked. People could only specu- late about the time the power would return, so all of the activi;.. ties in the Coil ege Center we can- celed on Sunday. The outage was apparently a spur of the moment event for some people. Director of the College Center, Lee Bioomrosen had no time to put out fliers for the building closures. \I had no role in the College Center closing. The decisions were made by campus planning and security,\ Bloomrosen said. Unio~ to Host NCUR Again Cmztinued from page 1 institution with a strong empha- sis on undergraduate research. Based on this background, the NCUR Governing Board hon- ored Union's request to host the I 995 conference for part of the bicentennial festivities. \Dave Peak deserves the biggest credit for the participation in the con- ference,\ said Professor Tom Werner of the Chemistry Depart- ment, who sits on both the Bicen- tennial Steering Committee and the NCUR Goveming Board, as well as the NCUR 95 Steering Committee. As this conference typically hosts shtdents from ovet two huh- dred colleges and universities na- tionally, planning and funding are immense tasks. Werner ex- plains that funds for the $267,050 budget come frotn three re- sources. The registration fees comprise the bulk of the rev- enues. ·n1e remainder must come from fundraising by the NCUR Board and Union College. This summer, the AT&T Foundation donated $50,000. TI1is donation came largely from the efforts of Union College alumnus, Robert Laudise, the Director of Science at AT&T, who also presented the check to Union this summer. Werner explains that Laudise worked hard on Union's behalf. The college also recently received $10,000from past supporter Gen- eral Electric Foundation. These two donations and a contribution from Bob Panoff, son of a Union alumnus, will complete the Union fundraising. Werner also explains that Union is making some changes and addi- tions to the conference schedule. The standard Friday evening event at NCUR is usually a banquet with speakers, which is expensive and not well attended by students. This year, Union is organizing an Artsfeast, in which performing and visual artists from around the country are invited to perfonn at various sites on campus. In con- junction with the arts, ethnic food will also be served. The Artsfeast will make the conference encom- pass all disciplines, reduce the cost, and return the emphasis to the stu- dents, Werner added. At the suggestioi1 of the public relations consultant hired for the bicentennial plans, Union College invited Nobel Laureates and other award-winning academics to dis- play their own undergraduate re- search. Students wrote to over two hundred people in an effort to broaden the academic horizon at the conference and increase publicity off campus. The NCUR '95 Steering Com- mittee expects approximately twelve hundred presenters in April. Students, faculty and ad- ministration are currently work- ing very diligently to make the conference a success. Werner lauds the various committees as being \enthusiastic and hard- working,\ and a11 expect this bi- centennial activity to be a great success. Have You Hugged Your Kid Today?

November 3, 1994, page 4 NEWS Haunted House a Great Success. by Diana Sedita Copy Editor On October 26 and 31 Webster House was transfonned into a Haunted House for the college cotmnunity and for the residents of Schenectady with ~. the dedication of student volun- teers. The directors o.f the Haunted House were Sara Amann, Jon Comeau and Shaun-Paul Manon~. They put aside count- less hours in their busy sched- ules to provide Union students and Schenectady residents with. a great Haunted House and Hal- loween. The whole idea of a Haunted · House began at a floor meeting in Webster. When trying to find a community project to do as a floor, the idea to convert Webster into a Haunted House was bom. From there, Amann, Comeau, and Manore w0rked hard in making the idea a real- ~ ity. With some funding pro- '@ vided by the Student Forum and ~ with the volunteering of at least -'<: fifty Union College students the ~ Haunted House became a suc- cess. On both evenings there was a steady flow of visitors coming through the House ready to get scared. On the evening set aside for the students,. October 26, fifty five students came to the House. All said they really enjoyed it. One student said, ••y ou can tell that all of the students involved put a lot of work into making the Haunted House good.\ When the children of Schenectady and their parents came through all were very pleased. The kids loved every . minute of it and said that they thought it was \very scary.\ The Mike Forson and Becky Co111leady ai tile Harlllted Hause parents were very supportive of the community project. One par- ent said, \The Haunted House here at Webster is much better than the ones at the malls because it is less crowded and very safe. l11e kids enjoy themselves and they know that at the end of the tour they will be 'rewarded' with candy and a balloon.\ One child said that he had \a I ot of fun\ and. that he would tell all his friends how much fun he had . Amann said that she would \ ... like to thank everyone for helping out because we depend . on people to volunteer in order to create a great Haunted House.\ In addition, Comeau reiterated that he, \really appre- ciated everyone's help.\ Over all, the Webster Haunted House was a success and every- one involved deserves thanks for all their hard work. It would be nice to see the Webster Haunted House become a Union tradi- tion.

There will also be an ecumenical wor- Corrections: ship service, during which the theme of family relationships will be discussed. The service will be lead by Catholic Chaplain Tom Frieberg .and Protestant Chaplain Kathleen Buckley. Several discussion panels will be organized to address current issues concerning Union. Fred Alford, Dean of Students, and Paul Mantica, Director of Cam- pus Safety, will lead a discussion on campus safety. Robert Wells, Professor of History alld Social Sciences, will discuss his research of Union's role in the local com- munity in a discussion entitled \200 Years of Town/Gown Re- lations.\ Richard Kenyon, Dean of Engineering. will discuss the history of engineering at Union, changes in the profession and hi·s view of engineering in the Zl st century. ·Faculty seminars are also being organized with parlels of students who will discuss their living and leaming experiences during tenns ·abroad in countries like China, France, Barbados, England and the summer study of National Health Care Systems.

Plot: Union Awaits Council Response Continued from page 1 could have used the buildings for any purpose that they wanted un- til the new law was passed.\ It was also made cleat that several other organ.izations, since 1984, have been able to utilize property in the G.E. Plot for non-conforming uses. A church, the Brown School and borders are just a few of the examples that Hull gave at the meeting. As far as the GE Plot losing its identity as a historic dis- trict, Hull stated thatthe possibil- ity is, \NOT AT ALL.\ According to Hull, the college is challenging Schenectady be- cause \The zon-ing law is uncon- stitutional.\ \It is unconstitutional because single family zoning laws do not apply to colleges or churches.\ Hull believes that the zoning law is not the only motivation of residents who are in opposition to the college. \This ordeal is all about NIMBY, not in my back yard.\ HuU said that G.E. Plot residents believe that it is O.K. for the college to build in another neighborhood as long as it is not theirs. Although .some Plot residents believe that Union will have a destabilizing impact on the area, Hull disagrees. Union's Presi- dent does not believe that the Plot is very stable currently. \In a re- cent jog I counted 18 for sale signs, not the sign of a stable com- munity.'~ Hull added that. \We can be good neighbors and we are willii1g to work with the people in the community.\ Union's President believes that the college can be trusted to main- tain the properties, despite resi- dents' claims that the school has allowed five of its properties to be destroyed. Hull mentioned the $290,000 the school spent re- building Fero House and the $11 Million that has been spent to renovate the Nott Memorial \These are the actions of a school that wants to preserve.\ The DEIS report submitted by the school indicates that the Union's plans· will not have an adverse impact on the commu- nity. This report has been at- tacked by G .E. Plot residents for being incomplete. According to some of these residents, the report does not assess all of the altema- tive building sites, and it does not address the long-tenn impact of Union's proposal. \If we had spent years doing the DEIS it would not have mattered,'' said Hull. \We addressed m.ost, if not all. of the cmmnunity's concems. If the DEIS showed that this pro- posal would lmnn the community, we would have backed ·off ... if we hann the plot, we harm our- selves.\ Hull added, \There are ito altematives.\ Although the Sc:henet.·tm~v (ia- :elle accused Hull of not being willing to compromise in a recent editorial. the President disagrees with that ~llegation. '\We seek ~ reasonably. balanced. fair ap- preach. We have made compro- . mises. We said that the city ~ould be held hannless for the loss oftaxes[from the properties if they were to be converted to offices]. We have made conces- sions of the parking issue.\ Otl_ the other hand, Hull believes that G.E. Plot residents have been relatively umesponsive and ·un- willing to compromise. ''The communities so-called compro- mise was 'sell the property,' which is obviously not a compro- mise.\ Since the August 29 meeting, Hull says that the he has received no fe.edhack from the Schenectady City Council, which is why he wrote a letter to each of the people on the C0uncil on Oc- tober 6, In the letter, Hull ex- plained that, \We are not asking. .. to be exempt from zoning re- quirements~ we merely want the right to apply for a special use penn it.\ Although the President does not believe that this case should end up in court, he inti- mated that ifthe.City Council did not give Union the right to apply for the pennit, \TI1e college will no longer hold the City hannless on the tax implications of the is- sue, and we will consider with- drawing the compromises made in our Environmental Impact Statement - - including planned use of the premises and a ban on parking - - that we have ad- Vat1ced.'' I Hull is frustrated with the lack of progress in resolving the issue over the pa·st few months. \When the college presented the issue 15 months ago. I was told by a mem- ber of the city council that I was wasting time; they said I had no votes.\ \The feeling I am left with af- ter three years is, I do not think the plot is operating in good faith,\ said Hull. \The object of the GE plot is to stall this, but we will not go away.\ \As far as legal issues are con- cemed, they· are quite clear,\ said Hull. \If we end up in court we will be vindicated.'' End note: The $550,000 per year that Union would gaii1 from meviug students on campus \'could en- able Union to spend eighty more students abroad and represents 2% of the tuition paid by each stu- dent annually.\~ Next Week: The Plot's Per~pective The third article in a series on the G.E.

The research conducted by Huggins also dealt with how people guard their secrets, most of them did not want· to tell her ab.out the torture they perfonned. So Huggins had to develop some strategy in order for them to open up. They wanted some sort of capital to compensate for their secrets, namely money, which Huggins did not engage in. How- ever, she discovered that if she allowed them to digress from the topic of their conversation, she could than ask a leading question to get some information out of them. She had to engage in some sort of psychological trickery which she felt very depressed al:wtut after the interview. At times, Huggins remarked \I would take a shower afterwards because I felt 'dirty.\' Huggins also commented that she didn't like interviewing these people and being 'nice' to them because af- ter all they were torturers. She didn't like leaving after an inter- view knowing that the torturers 'liked' her. Huggins and her colleagues be- lieve that to some extent, the tor- turers themselves were victims. One interviewer commented, \Some kinds of police work beastalize men.\ These men were exploited by their government and they could not fight against it. TI1ey had to join the system as .a whole. Tortu'ring for the first time was difficult, but they even- tually learned to cut offtheir emo- tions completely in order to re- m.ain sane. The lives of these people dwindled down to virtually noth- ing. lltey cannot share their t.ives with anyone. They cannot con- fide in their wives, children or their friends. These interviews conducted by Huggins reminds them of the life they had chosen to h~ad and it is too painful for them to relive the events by shar- ing them with her. Huggins com- ments on the victims and the tor- turers as \one dies fast-victim, and one dies slowly-torturer.\ Huggins continues to research the tortures that have taken place in Brazil in addition to that she plans on lecturing at SUNY Al- bany about criminal justice. She is currently working with Philip Zimbardo on a project concem- ing the behavior of people in a mock prison and has recently fin- ished a book on the Latin train- ing of death squads. \In dreams and in life, anything is possible.\ - fortune cookie Eighth Annual AIDS Awareness Week THURSDAY, NfJYE118ER II 11:30 p.m. Union College Monday.

Source: '[Ire New York Times 10118194 by Marc Foster Concordiensis Staff It was politicking at its worst. Rudolph GiHiiani's catholic en- dorsement of Mario Cuomo last week was more than a betrayal of World News Opinion the Republican Party. It was an act, Hot of courage, but cowardice. By abandoning his own party's nominee for governor, GiuJ.iani gave in to political avarice. It was neither the welfare of the state nor the city which moved Giuliani to his emetic political oblation to Cuomo; it was an overt attempt to rankle political foes from within his own party and to establish him- self as the man to beat in New York politics by currying to a jaded and liberal New York populous. So blinded by ambition is he that Giuliani called the incumbent governor of 12 years \a leader who offered the best opportunity for change.\ And he went on to say that New Yorkers owed Cuomo \his place in history.\ But it was that amorphous notion of change that was at the heart of Giuliani's endorsement. He said Senator Pataki offered few ideas, and that when he did offer them, they were vague. Maybe it is that while Giuliani was calculating his politi- cal moves, he missed what Pataki Clintonomics: You'll Get Your Job When He Loses His by Marc Foster Concordiensis Staff Clintonomics have failed. De- spite the numbers they tout, the economy is not enjoying the ro- bust recovery that the Clinton team suggests. The.munbers are overly optimistic if not downright deceiv- ing. Take, for instance, the new jobs tally. More than four million World News Opinion created since Clinton took office. But that is still 1.2 million fewer than is nonnal during typical eco- nomic expansions. What's worse is that more than 50% of the new jobs that have been created pro- vide only part-time or contract re- lated work,. and both are inher- ently unstable. The rate of job growth is anemic; unemployment is a full point higher than the av- erage for past economic expan- sions. But the deficit is down from $340 billion in I 992 to a slim .$274 billion in 1994. It is down, though, not as a result of fiscal restraint, but because of the larg- est single tax hike in America's history. In fact, by 1998, federal spending will have increased by more than $300 billion-a 20% swell in the size of an already bloated system. And candidate Clinton's promised middle-class tax cut suffered an about face. Marginal inco111e tax rates (the tax on each additional dollar of income) for families eaming be- tween twenty thousand and fifty thousand dollars rose on average three-quarters of one percent with the highest rate increase for thos_e earning between twenty thousand and thirty thousand dollars. Bill Clinton told us that he felt our pain. Now he's making sure that we feel it, too. By 1997, the economy will be worse off than if the president had done noth- ing. So much for a government take-over of health care. It all amounts to a bleak eco- nomic forecast. Since Clinton has never met a tax he didn't like, we are sure to see new ones in- vented and old ones restored~ more Americans will be forced into low-paying service sector jobs; there will be fewer low-pay- ing service sector jobs to compete for; the national debt will begin to rise again by 1997-good timing for a president who's never been known for his punctuality. After all of the rhetoric, the promises, the political maneuver- ing, Bill Clinton still has not dis- covered that his persona is not enough to move America's economy forward. It takes disci- pline and focus and tenacity. If. by 1996, he still hasn't gotten the message, he '11 hear it at the polls. And that's when you 'II get your job-when Bill Clinton loses his. has made the crux of his cam- paign-· . the issues. For Rudy and others like him, then, here they are: Taxes Pataki proposes a 25% cut in state taxes. Through cuts in the size of state government and controlled spending, it can be done. Welfare Senator Pataki seeks a change in the way New York administers its welfare program. He believes that if a person can work, the person should work. Jobs Over taxation and over regulation have stifled job growth in the state. George Pataki will catapult New York from 47th in the nation for job growth, as it is now under Mario, to the top. His economic policies will spur job growth rather than .spurn them, as Cuomo's policies have done over the past decade. Gun Control Pataki says that he supports a ban on assault weapons. Death Penalty Like a major- ity of New Yorkers, Pataki be- lieves that the death penalty should be a viable option to be implemented in cases of violent crimes like murder. Except for the gun control, every Pataki position is counter to the incumbent's failed liberalism. Each is a change from the past 12 years under Mario Cuomo. Apparently Giuliani is oblivi- ous to the abundance of change that Senator Pataki offers. So, in- stead ofthe political maneuvering and puerile name-calling that Giuliani engaged in last Monday for the sake of his own political ambitions state-wide, he should have given more consideration to his endorsement. If it were really change that he sought, Giuliani's decision about whom to endorse in the gubernatorial race would be clear. It would be George Pataki. But as Rudy says, Pataki isn't his own man; he's in searchl\<of definition. But even that cannot be the reason for Giuliani's be- trayal. After all, the mayor is tom in these, his years of political ado- lescence. He lacks identity and has not found himself. Should he not outgrow his political pubes- cence by the time that he is up for re-electipn, Giuliani will have more to anguish over than his po- litical identity. He'll have to won- der about his political future. And then he'll have to ask himself if a bold act of cowardice was the 1ight thing to do.

November 3, 1994, page 10 The Information Highway? The college planned a power outage for Sunday, October 23. Without notifying much of the campus, the college decided to cancel the outage at the last minute. Many students planned around this antici- pated outage by spending the day at local libraries. Students were informed the following Monday that the power outage was being rescheduled for Sunday, October 30. The letter sent to students stated that the power would be turned off in buildings early on Sun- day morning and that it would be restored at about 6 p.m. The school cl.id not mention that it intended to close the College Center for the entire day. Once again, students made their daily plans anticipating that the College Center would be fully functional'by the evening. Afler all, if they anticipated closing the campus ·most popular building one would expect stu- dents to be notified beforehand. Needless to say, the C01lege Center was not re- opened. This presented a pw~lem to members of the campus clubs whose otlices are located in the build- ing. WRUC ot1icers and Concordiensis editors were prevented from entering the building, even though power had been fully restored. When several clubs members approached campus security oftlcers about obtaining access to the building, they were told that they needed written permission from the head of cam- pus safety. If the school had properly advertised the closing ofthe building, those students could have ob- tained the necessary approval. As a result of the com- munication gutTaw~ the newspaper was forced to cut the size cf its ~arents' Weekend issue. No one orga- nization is entirely to blame for the problem. but this communication problem is symptomatic of a much more serious problem at this school. Campusl:iepartrnents do not communicate efficiently among themselves, and far too much information never reaches students. This is not the tirst time.that stu- dents were unexpectedly denied access to important campus buildings. Students have complained before, but their pleas appear to have gone unheeded. It is time for Union to get its act together. Alienating stu- dents and not bending the rules in extenuating circum- stances will not wi11 the school dedicated alumni. OP-ED - ~-- 'Th4!. &'-\*'~ ~ ~ --TO·\\~• c... OPINIONS Freshmen Deserv:e Cars On Campus, Too! by Tony Lavecchia Co11cordiensis Staff Well, every week I find myself writing a five hundred word com- plaint. Why should this week be any different? As a freshman here at Union College I am not allowed to have my car 011 campus. ll1is lack of automotive freedom is a · source of anxiety for myself and my peers. It would make my life much easier, not to mention cheaper if I were allowed to h~y~ my car on campus this year. , I can understand some of the arguments against Freshman hav- ing cars on campus. There is the obvious lack of parking space. that limits the amount of people who can have cars on campus. I also see the possible deeper mo- tives that caused the administra- tion to make this decision. Perhaps the administration feels that by not allowing Freshman to have cars on campus. they eliminate a dis- traction from academics. Another possible reason could be the be- liefthat if Freshman were allowed to have cars. they would go home more often. 1l1is frequent absence from college life would cause some to have bigger problems fully adjusting to life away frmn ~ home. I hppe to offer a few sug- gestions to alleviate the problems I see that are preventing freshman from·having car's on campus. l11e issue that seems to be hard- est to resolve is the one of park- ing space. I would propose to designate one less convenient parking area on campus for fresh- man. The allotted space would probably end up being to small for all Freshman with cars to park in. If .this were the case then people would find themselves at an inconvenience .. People would have to spend hours searching for a space, or park further away somewhere in Schenectady. 1l1is seemingly self defeating proposal would have a benefit. A lot ofthe freshman who really don't need to use their cars often would find themselves bringing them home. l11is would provide a partial so- lution to the problem of space, without severely limiting the parking of 1.1pper-class students. At the same time those who kept their cars on campus and dealt with the aggravation of parking would be doing so by their own free will, without really hurting anyone else. Perhaps freshman should only be allowed to conditionally have cars on campus Spring term. If only Freshman whq, had achieved a certain GPA in their first two tenus where allowed to have a car on campus, it would be an incentive for students to do well This compromise ad- dresses the concern that Fresh- man would be distracted from their work because of their cars. It would also allow Freshman . to adjust to college life during their first two tenns on campus, while providing them freedom during thei-r third tenn. Perhaps it's an unrealistic re- quest. Lt might not be wmth the aggravation to the administra- tion and students for us to have cars on campus Freshman year. I think it would be worth the aggravation to the students, at least the ones I've spoken to. I'm really not familiar enough with the hard facts ofhow many spaces there are on campus in relation to the number of stu- dents who have cars. Perhaps it's just flat out impossible for Freshman to have cars on cam- pus. If it's not though, I think it's an issue that is worth being re- considered from a different per- spective.

OPINIONS November 3, 1994, page 11 PanHellenic President Responds To Last Week's Editorial An Alumnus · Praises The Concordiensis To The Editor, \. . . It gives rushers a better chance to get to lffiow the rush- ees.\ In response to last weeks article titled \Why Rush Rush,', you answered your own question. Traditionally and politically proven, any change is frightening, and a difficult step to take. How- ever, where would we be in this world if nobody ever had the ini- tiative to take a step forward and change things that seemed to. be not working. Year after year we hear people complaining about rush. About how it is unfair, discriminatory, and how superficial it really is. In the past few years active leaders ofPanhellenic Council have been l)assive bystanders in watching the system maintain the status quo. As President of Panhellenic Council this year, I decided to push for a change which I believed to be in the best interest of the four sororities and the potential rushees. I am sure it was a shock to the Freshmen women when they heard they could now go into the four houses. Nonetheless, they are intelligent young women who are dealing with· many changes in their lifestyles hear at Union and this wiJl only make it more comfortable for them winter tennifthey plan to rush. Maybe some of the rumors about rush and sororities will be diminished if the freshman are in more contact with sorority sisters. This is nol pre-msh! There are not any rush functions going on in the houses noris ther:e any \dirty rush- ing' going on. It is simply giving an equal opportunity to those girls who were not at pre - season or do not know upperclassmen the same opportunities. I understand there will always be some people not in• terestec:J in going to sorority parties just y¢t, and they still just as good of a chance of being in a sorority as anyone else. This open rush policy is simply allowing Freshman into our houses. It is not something we needed to prepare for, not is it something we needed to set ground rules for. We are mature women who have the capabilities of dealing with the normal social pressures of col- lege. I think we all have the abil- ity to not look at this as a hurtful ami degrading process, but rather a conscious effort made to try to change an unsuccessful system. As members of Union Colfege I think we should try to be more supportive of attempts made to change existing policies rather than immediately shOQting them . down. All I am asking is to give it a try and if it does not work we .. can then work together to change · it yet again , then change it. · RespectfuUy yours, Cheryl Blitt Panhe11enic President To the Editor, President Of Delta Gamma Responds To Freshwomen In Sorority Houses Not Everyone Likes The \Y\ In Womyn I would like to take a moment to congratulate both David Levine and Heather Reynolds, co-editors in chief of The Con- cordiensis, and the entire Con- cordiensis staff, on making The Concordiensis a commendable college newspaper. As a former staff member and editor of The Clmcordienvis I am fully aware of the agonizing time and effort spent to get the paper out each week. Last year, David initiated a complete overhaul of the com- puter system at The Concordicm- :~i.v making his goal to provide Union with a paper worthy of praise. After reading last weeks Homecoming issue, I think I can say that he has accomplished his goal. Congratulations to all the editors, staff members and con- tributing writers on a job well- done. Respectfully submitted, Matt Karlyn '94 A Response To Last Week's Opinion To the Editor, Although the recent decision of the PanhellenicCouncil to lift the restriction prohibiting fresh- man women frem entering so- rority houses prior to formal rush merits recognition, I must admit my dismay that sorority rush \bashing\ has once again begun .. Granted, the sorority msh process is far from ideal. Both Greeks and non.,.(Jreeks would agree with that statement. However, I don't feel sufficient thought was given to the article \Why Rush Rush?\. First, the article denotes a very negative attitude of sororities and fonnal rush without recognizing the progress made over the last year nor acknowledging Panhellenics desire for changes in the future. Last year, theme nights were eliminated, de_cora- tions were limited, .and the dress was made more casual. These might not seem like significant steps, but they were a starting point and succeeded in reducing some of the superficial aspects. This year, freshmen women are now aHowed in sorority houses prior to rush. Titis is an attempt to demystify some·ofthe exclusiveness and confusion surrounding sororities. Con- trary to the article's presenta- tion, sororities are not allowed to have parties aimed solely at freshman women. Such an ac- tion is prohibited. by the Na- tional Panhellenic Council and certainly was not the intent of • our Panhellenic Council's deci- sion. However, by eliminating this restriction, freshman women can now come into our · house not to be pressured into Greek life, but rather to study, watch T.V., attend campus wide events, and just meet new people. it probably won't n.ean that all 200 women will enter a sorority house before rush, but at least now they are welcome. For example, Delta Gamma will have a speaker on November 9th at 7:00pm con- cerning STDs and sex educa- tion. This is an event open to the entire campus which pre- viously would have been post- poned until after formal rush so as not to exclude freshman women. Contrary to the accusations of the article, I don't believe that any ofthe sorority houses wish to foster more pressure . for freshman women or sense of exclusiveness. We recog- nize the limitations of rush which, unfortunately, have some harmful effects not only on the rushees, but also on the campus community. How- ever, we also acknowledgethe rewards which Greek life has on those who chose to join. Panhellenic deserves our sup- port for its attempts to change a system which is far from per- fect, and I feel confident that they will continue to work in tl~e best interest of both the sororities, as well as potential rushees. Sincerely, Deanna Johnston President of Delta Gamma To the Editor, In last week's edition of The Concordiensi.o; , I read the article \Language And The Role It Plays Irt Sexism,. written by Sarah Ruth Evans, with much malaise. Ms. Evans states in l1er article that merely the spelling .of a ward contains subtle connotations.of sex- ism. My question is this: how many people, when hearing orreadingthe word \women\ honestly think of \wife of man\ automatical1y? I sure don't, and I also do not think there are many of you out there. Also, in support of the males here at Union College, I do not believe they are subtly or overtly subjugat- ing us women by calling us \girls.\ My advice to Ms. Evans (and to the rest of the minute percentage who actually agree with her) is to stop living and thinking in the 14th Centmy; as the word ''woman\ was defined, and start thinking in mod- em-day English-the form of which we currently speak. In fact, Webster's Ninth Co11egiate Edition Dictionary (yes, it was published in this decade) defines \women\ as adult, female persons. At age 19, this is what I am: a young adult fe- male.· Being a feminist, I refuse to be affixed to the politically correct \straight-jacket so to speak; and l do not perceive myself as \wife of man.\ I believe that these so- called feminists are using the wrong approach in trying to achieve gender equality. Chang- ing the spelling of words or attack- ing the guys on this campus for calling girls \girls\ is, in effect, re- versing our place as women in so- ciety. And, in response to Ms. Evans' likening of this to racism, calling us \girls\ has absolutely All Letters To The Editor Must Be Submitted On High Density Disk By 4PM The Monday Prior To Publication. No Exceptions; nothing to do with the 19th Cen- tury racism ofthe Old South. Her statement that white men referring to black men as \boys\ is a con- voluted, far-stretched analogy which can in NO way be com- pared to the sexism of today. Being a feminist does mean push- ing men aside, not to mention ste- reotyping the guys at Union as a bunch of sexist animals who re- lease their \superiority\ by refer- ring to us as \girls.\ I (along with about 99.5% of all girls on this campus) like guys, enjoy being · around guys, and inter-relating with them. Gender discrimination, on the other hand, is a completely dif- ferent issue, of which I feel is genuinely sexist, and something as minor as the spelling of a word or the use of \girls\ is not true sexism. The women who adhere to such ludicrous notions should lighten up and focus their atten- tions on serious feminist issues such as discrimination at the workplace and in classrooms, sexual harassment, and so forth. So every girl and boy at Union should do themselves a favor this weekend: go out and party and enjoy the other gende.rs • com- pany-girls can actually learn a lot from guys and guys can learn a lot from girls. Sincerely, CaraAidone Are You Interested In Helping Local School Children? To the editor: Many cl1ildren in the area need attention and companionship. The residents of Wells house. in cooperation with the New York State Mentoring Program. have taken steps to initiate a program that will allow Union students to become mentors. \A mentor is a . caring adult who is willing to be a good listener and nonjudgmental friend to a child who can benefit from guidance and individual interaction. A mentor is a positive role model who expands the mentee'saware- ness of alternatives to despair, drug abuse, dropping out and other pervasive problems that are destroying the young people to- day.\ Ifyouare interested in vol- unteering one hour per week to this worthy cause, a meeting will be held at Wells house on Tues- day, November 8 at 8:00pm.

ARTS & ENTERTAINMENT November 3, 1994, Page 13 Union Students to Perform Charles II for Parents' Weekend by Suxanne Robinson & Leena Mankad Arts Editors Charles ll, produced by the Per- forming Arts Department and the Bicentennial Committee, will be performed this weekend in Old Chapel. The idea to do a play that had significance to .the Bicentennial had. been floating around for awhile. After some research, they found the play Char/e.\' II written byJohn Howard Payne and Wash- ington Irving. Payne was \America's first internationally successful dramatist\ as well as a member of the Union College Class of 1810. He had started his .career at the young age of four- teen when he was the publisher of the Thespian Mirror, a critical journal. At the age of fifteen he wrote his first play, .Julia, which was acted at the Park Theatre, and three years later he made his act- ing debut. Over his life time, Payne, had written or· adapted be- tween fifty and sixty plays, one of the more famo~ts ones being Charles l!, a comedy. Charles ll was written in 1824 and was freely based on Alexandre Duval's La .leunesse /)e Henri V, written in 1805. It is a tale oflust, love, and treach~ ery told with a comedic flare. The plot revolves around the de- ceit by the Earl of Rochester (played by Thor Benandet) of the king Charles fl(played by Dug Bartell). Getting tangled in the tale as well, are Lady Clara(Beth ~ Harrison) with a distinctive ac- cent aiding the Rochester, and Mary (played by Stephanie Kuehn) the \fair and innocent.\ Still, are other players and the ensemble which completes the cast. The Arneri can theater of 1824 was much diff¢rent then it is to- day. The costumes were not pe- riod costumes ofthe 1600's but rather costumes done in the 1'824 styl¢s. 1l1e fact to use historically accurate costumes was just being invented by Charles Cambell, who played Charles I! in the 1824 production. \To be histori- cally accurate, we are being his- tori.cally inaccurate,\ says the di- n:ctor of Union's production, Lee Bloomrosen. They will perfonn Charles II as it would have been perfonned h1 1824, and not in historically accurate costumes of the 1600's. The performance in 1824 was not character oriented, Tl10r Bena11der and Doug Bartell rellearsefor Charles II (plroto by Josll Hailles/Tile Concordiensis) ratl1er it was actor oriented. l11ey .are keeping this point in mind for their production. They are keep- ing that in mind, '·nodding our heads to how it was perfonned\. remarks Bloomrosen. However if Charles /1 was performed completely as it was in 1824, it would be \really boring\. Originally, in the production at Union College, they had planned to transfonn all of Old Chapel into a tavem. but instead they will just have the front half changed into a British tavem. They plan to serve food and drinks at the tavern such as scones, biscuits and non-alcohol beer. TI1ere is an ensemble who will be in the tavem as the vari- ous characters found there: bar wenches, troubadours. piano players. etc. a non-profit organization, TI1eater Development Fund. The cos- tumes are rich with design and further bring the characters to life. TI1e lights were done by John Miller. who has been the lighting designer. technical director, and theater facilities coordinator at Union since 1987. The scenery was created by Charles Steckler. resident designer, who has de- signed nearly forty shows at Union. The set design creates a good back drop and an .. appropri- ate canvas to .present the colorful costumes\ .. The director of ( 'harles II. Lee Bloomrosen. is also a Union Col- lege Alumni.

Blues T'raveler Back In Form with Four by Ryan Marcus Concordiensis Sttlf/ Blues Traveler's latest, titled Four, marks a significant' style change, namely a return to the basics the band seemed to know so well on their debut and follow up. The third \Blues Traveler\ re- lease, Save Hi,., Soul .. seemed more to be a flirtation with a heavier edge, and guitarist Chan Kinchla' s persistent use of distor- tion created much dissonance with the other members. Four signifies a solution to tltis prob- lem, as chemistry 'between John songs. Also appearing is the in- credible latest addition to the Allman Brothers, guitarist Warren Haynes. Haynes adds some excel- lent slide solos to track five, \The Mountains Win Again.'' Veteran World's Most Dangerous Bandleader Paul Shaffer lends his skills to the second track, \Stand\. Quality guests are a big plus on Four. Yet the song writing skills of Popper seem to have rebounded also.

A Wondrous Journey Into the Unknown· by Larry Paska Co11cordie11sis Staff Slargate. Starring Kurt Russell. James Spader •. Jaye Davidson. Directed by Roland Emmerich. Rated PG-13, MGMIUA Pictures. Rating: *** (out of four) It· s taken quite a while to bring another sci-fi epic to the screen. but fantasy fans should delight in the arrival of Stargate. The new film. produced by the financially• troubled MGM. should not only reinstate sci-fi as a popular genre in theaters but also bring some profits in MGM's comer. Stargate looks expensive. In fact. it was quite exp.eusive, thanks to on-location shooting. But the world of the film is tmly an alien world: this is no cheapie sci- fi story. but persuades the sci- entists involved and marine colo- nel Russell to go through it, and see what lies beyond. Where they end up is the planet Abydos. a desert planet inhabited by a primitive culture and ruled by the god, ~a (Davidson). Ra. it seems. intel1ds to use the Stargate to destroy the Earth.

And it fol- lows in the tradition of the !,'feat- est of space sagas in pitting good against evil, with the prize being the safety of the Earth. Russell, as the marine.colonel, is rather bland in the role. never conveying an image of a tough- guy, but more of an unemotional character who just wants to go home. Spader, fresh from his de• lightful role in this summer's Wo(f, actually steals the show. His performance carries the film through its weak moments, like a standard but totaJiy pointless and unimagi- native love scene. Spader's archeologist makes the film all the more spectacular; his wide-eyed wonder through the journey makes the viewer ex- cited, too. It's as if Spader is leading us through his hip. and wants us to be curious also. Stargate succeeds in bringing back a great genre. It fails in be- ing um1bte·to occasionally get it- self out of some holes it digs. But the sheer spectacle and terrific tale of a voyage through the gal- axy makes this film a big sur- prise, indeed, Also Recommended: The Abyss (***), Close Encounters ofthe l11ird Kind(*** 1/2), For- bidden Planet (***112).

ARTS & ENTERTAINMENT November 3, 1993, Page 15 ·Tom McGovern to Give Slide Presentation and Lecture About His Photo Exhibit Living with· AIDS by Suzanne Robinson Arts Editor Photographer Tom McGovern will be giving a talk and slide , presentation at 7:00 pm en No- vember 8, 1994, in Arts Build- ing, room 215, in conjunction with the exhibition of his photo- g.raphic series entitled Living with AIDS. The exhibition is continuing through Friday, No- vetnbet 11 in the Arts Atrium Gallery in the Arts Building. Tom will be present at a recep- tion for the artist in the gallery on Tuesday aftemoon, 4:00 to 6;00 pm. \Living with AIDS is a docu- mentation .of various aspects of AIDS crisis in New York with at' emphasis on the effect the dis ... ease has on individuals through their personal experiences. The project covers many areas of the crisis from individual stories, treatment, activism and extended portraiture. It is a cross-sectional group portrait of people with AIDS and a documentation of the changes in treatment of both disease and patient. While it fo- cuses on the experiences of people living with the disease, it also serves to,infonn us all of our own unlilnited ability to trans- form tragedy into strength.\ said McGovern of his exhibit Living wi/.hAIDS. r found the photographs not only mov.ing but also very edu- cational. The photographs showed this, the wide range of people AIDS has reached. It makes one think of the disease itself and what it's powers are. It can affect anyone, anywhere, at a-lmost anytime in their life. As well as the collection of photographs, McGovern also has among the pictures, three stories of three individual p.eople and how they are dealing with the fact that they have AIDS. I found this aspe.ct of the collection very touching. In some cases it almost brought tears to my eyes in real- ization. These people are very strong. They aren't giving up on life, they are making the most of what they have, and in some cases are getting more out of life then we are.

It may seem like I am the exception, I won't get AIDS, I won't be the bum on the street, but you never know. I'ni vulnerable and if I don't watch out that could be me in the pictures. I bet five years ago the people in the pictures didn't think that would be them. Luckily there has been a lot of education on the subject of AIDS and we know the facts about the disease so we can prevent the fact that that could be us somewhere in the future. I strongly suggest that you take just ten minutes out of your busy. schedule to look and learn from these photos. 1l1ey were taken for a purpose so make use of it.

November 3, 1994, page 16 FEATURES Are Women (at Union) Their Own Worst E.nemie.s? by Alexis Leist Features Editor On Wednesday, October 26 Chet's held a Crosstalk whose subject was \Are women (at Union) their own worst enemies\? and whose panel consisted of Pro- fessor Womack, Beth Lifson (both arguing yes), Nikki Beland, and Jamie Polachek (both arguing against), while Professor Scullion served as mediator. This particu- lar crosstalk raised a slew of in- teresting questions, none of which were ever really answered. The lack of audience members was interesting to note. J remember last year at the \Do white males dominate Union?\ crosstalk, Chet's was packed. Although, at- tendance increased as time went on, I thought it almost insulting that more women did not attend. Professor Womack commenced by retelling how shocked she was by the confonnity she noticed her . first year here~ conformity i.n dress, speech, social roles, and sex roles. What struck her most was the degree of reverence at Union given to some standards. She questions why, in a microcosm of society, more women on this cam- pus did not try to _9issolve the bar- riers they will inevitably have to in the \real world.\ Beth joined in agreement by stating that vic- timization is everywhere, so why must women (at Union) victim- ize each other. Jamie started out by questioning the meaning of the question itself, while Nikki saw the mass media and historical tra- dition as the main factors in the oppression ofwomen. One of the major questions that evolved from this discussion was where to place the blame. On the media? History? Ourselves? So- ciety? and interestingly, the group which almost everyone skirted around carefully-men. The ques- tion of blame led quickly to a question of how to create solu- tions-from which a discussion of feminism ensued. In this discussion, what was tried to make clear is that not all feminists are man-haters or iemNeoNazis. This point was backed up by members of the Women's Union whose chalk drawings have attempted to en- lighten this campus-yet are still met with opposition. Some saw feminism as a theory, while some viewed it as actions and some simply considered themselves women-beings entitled to the same rights and privileges men are. No clear definition of femi- nism and feminist emerged from this debaterbut I think some au- dience members may feel better about it and some women in- spired to take action rather than just sit back and accept the status quo. The narrow focus of the in- tended crosstalk was this campus, and while it did lead to broader issues such as the origin of.tradi- tional stereotypes, the .role of capi- talism in the subordination of women, and feminism as both practice and theory-it circled back to the ever-present problem posed by Greek life. Li fson viewed soi'Orities as groups which victimized women, For example, througl:t hazing and other coercive acts renowned to occur behind closed doors, while members of the audience pointed out that these organizations were ways in which women can band together and try to make a differ- ence. The idea of banning all Gr.eek life was proposed and met with much opposition, some claimed this would accomplish nothing while some saw this as perhaps triggering a domino ef- fect That is, if we abolish that why don't we abolish everything? Fra- temities were also discussed as groups which served to oppress women, and making Greek orga- nizations co-ed was also sug- gested. Finally, the question once again came down to blame and respon- sibility. To what extent should Panel at tile Crosstalk last Wednesday (plloto by L,aurel Ruma/TC) women be responsible for their position and actions? To what extent should men? The crosstalk left all questions open-ended, probably for the very reasons that these questions cannot be solved by a collective consensus, but by individual values and decisions. What women on this campus must ask themselves, as. bo~h in- dependents and members of fra- ternities and sororities is: how can lovercome these stereotypes and in what ma1mer can I use this campus as practiee, as a founda- tion for th,e struggle for sexual equality?

All tal- about your club. ents are welcome. by Victor Owusu Contributing Writer As the Boeing 747 descended from above the clouds to reveal the city lights of Nairobi, a new era had dawned on Union College. Jambo! After200 years, Union fi- nally has a. term abroad to Africa. Many in mir !,rroup were not sure what to expect. After all, the US. media has bombarded us with nothing but primitive and savage images of Africa. What we did find when we landed is that Kenya is a beautiful land of extremes. One minute, you can be sur- rounded by the modem luxuries of cities like Nairobi or Mombasa, and the next minute you can be searching for indoor plumbing ( es- pecially if you're a woman). De- spite some minor inconveniences, this is tuming out to be a fun and oh so hilarious tenn abroad. Our trip began with some in- credible sights, the most amazing of which was the Great Rift Val- ley. As the fourteen of us stood on the side of the mountain and gazed upon the birthplace of man, some of us could not control our emotions. Dennis descended to his knees, overcome by tears, Sue soon followed and thus the domino theory ensued. After tears were dried, and we finally convinced Kelly not to pitch a tent, we were on the road again. Our next stop was Masai Mara, a national game reserve park. From m~rvans we were able to witness all the ·great beasts of the continent. Zebras were plen- tiful, as were warthogs and ga- zelles. However, our collective gasp of wonderment was saved for the sighting of a pride of li- onesses. The little ones were so cute that Ahnya co.uld not help herself. Witl1 the quickness of one with diarrhea, she bolted from her seat to hug and squeeze the terrified cubs. As we all pre- pared our eulogy statements, from nowhere appeared Siegfried International Featu~es and Roy (two park rangers) who were able to push back the ap- proachingpride. Ahnya, the day, our trip, and possibly the program were aU saved; thus we rejoiced. · Yet .still to this day Ahnya can be heard saying \Yeah like, I knew they were like wild, but they didn't, like look hungry.\ Aah,. the eternal bliss of ignorance. A few days later, with Ahnya' s seatbelt finnly secured, we were off to another game drive. TI1is time, we crossed Kenya's border and entered into Tanzania. At the border, a nice man offered us 50 cows if we would give him Nadine. After careful contem- plation, none of us could bring ourselves to cheat this man, so we untied Nadine and took her down from the top ofhisjeep. She was a little shaken up; but we con- vinced her we were just joking. From the border we proceeded on to N gorong.oro C~ater, a sunken volcano infested with wildlife. It was perhaps the most beautiful and serene areas we vis- ited. It was full of majestic li- ons, dastardly jackals, soothing lagoons, s~aring eagles, and mas- turbating monkeys ( oh yes, they were indeed masturbating). The crater is memorable to us, not only because of its sheer beauty, but it is also the site where we almost lost our Professor to the jaws of a crazed hyena. We were driving in the crater, taking an enormity of pictures, when Andrew, our resident ge-, ologist, asked Prof. Quaye to col- lect some volcanic ash. Our good professor, stepping out of the confines of safety to pi ease one of his students. But soft! What hyena in yonder mud lurks? Prof. Quaye, dashed for the jeep, and was sure to escape. Yet as fate would have it, the door of the jeep slammed shut. The hor- rific hyena, ~y now engrossed in a full laugh, charged with fantas- tic speed.

Yet still to this day Ahnya can be heard saying \'Yeah like, I knew they were like wild, but they didn't, like look lmngry.\ Aah, the etemal bliss of ignorance. A few days later, with Ahnya' s seatbelt finnly secured, we were off to another game drive. This time, we crossed Kenya's border and entered into Tanzania. At the border, a nice man offered us 50 cows if we would give him Nadine. After careful contem- plation, none of us could bring ourselves to cheat this man, so we untied Nadine and took her down from the top of his jeep. She was a little shaken up, but we con- vinced her we were just joking. From the border we proceeded on to Ngorongoro Crater, a sunken volcano infested with wildlife. It was perhaps the most beautiful and serene areas we vis- ited. It was full of majestic li- ons, dastardly jackals, soothing lagoons. soaring eagles, and mas- turbating monkeys (oh yes, they were indeed masturbating). The crater is memorable to us, not only because of its sheer beauty. hut it is also the site where we almost lost our Professor to the jaws of a crazed hyena. We were driving in the crater. taking an enom1ity of pictures, when Andrew. our resident ge- ologist, asked Prof. Quaye to wl- lect some volcanic ash. Our good professor, stepping out of the confines of safety to please one of his students. But soft! What hyena in yonder mud lurks? Prof. Quaye, dashed for the jeep, and was sure to escape. Yet as fate would have it, the door of the jeep slammed shut. The hor- rific hyena, by now engrossed in a full laugh, charged with fantas- tic speed. Prof. Quaye was fi- nally able to open the door and Continued on page 18

FEATURES November 3, 1994, page 17 The Men With Matching Floral Ties: Who Are They? by Kara Christian Contributing Writer Last Wednesday night, Chet's was crowded with an eager, en- thusiastic audience as the men with matching floral ties, the Dutch Pipers, perfonned in con- cert. The crewd applauded a most entertaining and successful con- cert. The Dutch Pipers, Union's male a cappella group started as the Union's glee club over fifty years ago. Over the years, the club evolved into a male a cappella group. For the past fif- teen years or so the group has been known as the Dutch Pipers. Last fall, the group nearly crumbled when it dwindled to having only four members. Af- ter holding auditions last fall, the Dutch Pipers gained seven new members, all ofwhich were fresh- man.

However, be- cause it was a generally disorga- nized year, the Piper's perfor- mances were scarce. The 1993-94 year, though dis- couraging for the group, was a turn-around year for the Dutch Pipers. Not only-did they over- come several obstacles, but they also made several adjustments and changes. They altered their style from singing traditional bar- bershop quartet type music to singingmore popular music. In addition, the Pipers took on a mt>te casual look.

November 3, 1994, page 18 FEATURES Lending New Perspectives and Promoting Awareness on Campus Concerning Gender Issues by Jodi Mousseau Contributing Writer Sometimes you look around and few people seem to be aware about issues that are of cmcial importance. The Womyn's Union is working on that prob- lem. Many people wonder what the purpose of the Union is, or what the chalk writii1gs are all about. but in some cases there is a misunderstanding, or even a complete ignorance of the whole cause. The primary goal of the Womyn's Union is to promote awareness on carnpus.about gen- der issues and to create programs that educate people about prob- lemsthey would not have thought about otherwise. Lending new perspectives about issues some- times makes people understand a problem more thoroughly. Many gender problems exist thrdugh- out society. Women are under- represented in government and do not receive equal pay as com- pared to a man for equal work. Some problems hit closer to home. such as rape, domestic vio- lence, and sexual harassment. This gender epidemic does not exclude the Union College cam- pus .. Many people are uncomfort- able about the problems that \\omen face today. and that is \\hat the Womyn's Union is at- tempting to convey. The prob- !em is not that all men disrespect women. Problems exist for both men and women. Many people misinterpret their cause and be- lieve that it is a group that is out for revenge against men. It is not a male-bashing organization. The issue is about respecting each other and seeing things from an- other perspective. In a male domi- nated world and on a male domi- nated campus. sometimes certain problems are overseen. The \Vomyn 's Union is trying to make sure that those issues are not ig- nored. Through the many endeavors of the group, programs and events are created to educate the campus. Discussion ~:,rroups, empowennent workshops, and the chalk writings are three of the things the group does to heighten awareness of gender issues. This term, their main focus is on date rape. A Safer Sex reception will be held after the Safer Sex talk with Suzi Landolphi on November 11th. It is open to all. Next month, the group will also be touching on the issue of pornography. One popular misconception is that the Womyn 's Union is meant for only women to participate in. TI1e Womyn's Union is open to all people, men and \vomen, that are concerned with women's is- sues and are interested in work- ing for the bettennent of the con- ditions for women. The group is composed of many different per- Kenya Term Abroad Continued from page /6 escaped with all limbs intact.

No longer can he run to his trusty computer at every crisis. He has been forced to use his brain power for this ten- ure and this caused him to suffer severe mental fatigue.

LIVING November 3, 1994, page 19 It's Time to Face the Mu~ic, Meet the Rentals by ALex Shapiro Living Editor Break out the rug .cJeaner and start burning the incense now, because this weekend is. Parents' Weekend. Start changing up the grades; do your laundry, try to clear up that whooping cough, get some sleep. Take out the nose ring, put a lampshade on the three footer, ask around for good res· taurants, and put out a dish with pretzels or something for them to eat, because after all they are your parents. You can tell it's Parents' Week- end soon because the plantings in front of the library have begun unseasonably booming and Dean Alford was honestly spotted giv- ing an impromptu \Unplugged\ session to a bewildered crowd of students outside the Science and Engineering building. The ad- ministration even smartened up this yearand_decidedthat, despite all their efforts to put the strangle hold on Halloween, no-one on earth or elsewhere can stop Hal- loween weekend from ra.ging so why not bump the parents up a few days. A salty-dog professor who desired to remain anony- mous informed me yesterday that a few of the departments have been ''strongly encouraged\ to give out good grades this week so freshmen won't cry and have their parents take them home. Dutch HollQW: has never smelled better, and the Chickens W/ Cheese are as plentiful as they are fresh. The question is, of course, \If they can dye the Hudson Rivet green for .Saint Patrick's Day, why catl't they dye it blue for the other 364?\ So, ready or not, here they come. Parents will be every- where, smiling and saying hello, dancing and singing, laughing and throwing food in the college center; basically acting silly as school kids. Union is a parents' paradise. They jump all over the place m?king fun of our friends and our living conditions; you can hear them whispering when you tum around. They raise their eye- brows and look at each other when they show up early on Sun- day morning and catch us munch- ing Advil and vitamins. We all know that they are just jealous. Of ceurse, underneath the cha- rade of fun and games runs the river of doubt. They'll ask coyly over dinner, \So what do you have lined up for the summer I after graduation I the rest of your life?\ They say it as if they hav.en't been discussing how to bring it up for months. They make it seem like they're just wondering, and they're sure you have everything under control. They'll say that they're just curi- ous, why are you getting so de- fensive? It is completely beyond comprehension that you don't have at least something lined up. Are you even thinking about it? Are you going to be a teacher? Psychologist Howard \The Duck\ Richardo gave a mov- ing lecture on Tuesday around the theme of family relation- ships in the small liberal arts college arena. He offered this advise on how to deal with Par- ent I Student anxiety, \The two most important things to re- member when dealing with parents at school are 1) They are probably more scared of you than you are of them, and 2) A rolling stone gathers no moss.\ He further explained, \Your parents are going to be a little disoriented because they are on your turf now. They are in an unfamiliar and frightening new environment; the sirens and alarms that you have become accustomed to are harsh on their ears. Fright- ened animals tend to be overly jumpy, so don't make any quick moves near them. They will try to get you to talk about things that they know full well you would rather avoid. If the conversation starts going into wild and woolly regions that you don't want to deal with, keep rolling. Tell a joke, then change the subject; let's move on,\ Mostofall rememberthat all parents really want is to be held. Just give them a big hug and say, \you are so cute.\ Mi ca.m. pass the salsa. You are you are happening, you know what is hot and what is not, hut can you deal with your parents. When dinner and a play turns into something more. What are you going to do? It is business as usual on parents' weekend. (photo hy F. Jeremy Smith, exdusivelyfor The Concordiensi.\) Your Stars By Natasha Aries (March 21 -April 1 9) It is a week to exercise initiative wl1ere business interests are concerned. Guard against careless mistakes regarding money. Be careful not to misplace a credit card. Some- one new and exciting comes into your life this weekend. Taurus (April 20- May 20) You could not find a better week for travel and self-promotion; How- ever, if you want things done, it is best to do them yourself. Oth- ers may not be fulling their obli- gations, causing an additional burden on you. Address this prob- lem immediately. Gemini (May 21- June 20) Be careful not to arrive at an incor- rect conclusion regarding a job concern. Oo not let wishful think- ing mar your judgment. You profit from research and study. A close friend has some good ad- vice for you, Cancer (June 21- July 22) The week does not favor gambling or financial risk-taking. However, couples are enthusiastic abottt mutual interest. You will be hap- pily making plans together. In fact, it is a wonderful time to re- new and restore romantic feel- ings. Leo (July 23- August 22) Your take-charge attitude this week wins the respect of superiors and brings you success in business. Don't let a jealous co-worker try to spoil this. This person has done nothing to deserve like treatment. Virgfl (August 23- September 22) You're not one to procrastinate as a rule, but you could forget an im.portant detail or appointment. . Guard against being absent minded this week. 11tis weekend, socializing leads to happy times and interesting introductions. Libra (September 23- October 22) Try not to be careless with money this week. It's an ideal time for beginning new domestic projects since the holidays will be here before you know it. Har- mony reigns at home. This week- end, you may have to play peace- Jt>'lker. Scorpio (October 23- November 21) While at home, you could misplace something of impor- tance. Doing something new to- gether will revitalize your rela- tionship with a close tie. tt is a Be Cool! Write For AI!! The Living Section Wants Your Articles and Insights.

Sagitarius (November 22- De- cember 21) Think before you speak this week or you may in- advertently let the cat out of the bag. This could lead to a betrayed confidence and hurt feelings. You'll be making important headway toward the realization or a career goal. Capricorn (December 22-Janu- ary 19) You may not quite under- stand why a friend is a bit envi- ous today but agonizing over it will do no good. Just let this run its course and it will pass eventu- ally. This weekend is good for paying visits to family. Aquarius (January 20- February 18) In business, you could be tak- ing something for brranted or over- looking an important detail. Ac- cent practicality. Don't overshoot the mark. Place the accent on home life this weekend and fam- ily activities that promote togeth· emess. Pisces (February 19- March 20) A story making the rounds has no basis in fact, yet you have a ten- dency to believe it because you somehow want to believe the worst of that person. Try to be more objective and examine your o'hn motives before passing on this lie.

I don't like going to fraternities be- cause they're so boring but I hate being alone all the time when everybody else has someone. I've tried the personals in the newspapers and got no re- sponse from the girls I wrote to. I am 19 and fairly good looking, so I don't understand it. I even wrote to Ricki Lake and asked her if she could set me up with a date on her show. I haven't heard anything since and I'm sick and tired of see- ing everybody else on her show finding someone when they play the dating game. That gets me really angry because it's not fair to me. (Am I right or wrong?) Can you please help me, Diane? If there's some way you can please write her or call her or her producers and tell them about me and my situation, could you please do it? Lonely Guy Dear Lonely: Please understand that talk show hosts area undoubted with request such as yours and it's im- possible for them to respond to everyone.

_1994-1_995 ~kating-Dutchmen Hockey Preview by Da,gan LaCorte Concortfiensis Sports In 1991 Union College ac- cepted a 'bid to ·play division I hockey amongst such elite schools as Harvard, Clarkson, and Capital District rival RPL For Union and Coach Bruce Delventhal it was an experiment to see if a top division III school could be transformed into a com- petitive division I pro.gram. In the first two seasons of division I competition the Dutchmen com- piled a combined record of6-43- 1, and finished last in the E.C.A.C. in both of its first two seasons. Many critics began to fear that Union would become perennial basement dwellers; however all that changed follow- ing the success of the 1993·94 season. .. 0 []_ VNJO!l r_-.-·-.~- ... - ~--.;;:: •. _- __ 7_- .. -- - --~ A -........_ ·• Skating Dutchmen Hockey As a result of the maturing of many of the teams veterans and a tremendous freshman class, the 1993-94 Dutchmen were a team to be reckoned with. The veter- ans of the 1992-93 season in- creased their offensive production by 95% in 1993-94, while five out of the Dutchmen's top ten scor- ers were freshmen. In addition the combined effort of goaltenders Mike Gallant and Luigi Villa was excellent. The Dutchmen finished the 1993-94 season with an overall srecord of 15-11-4. with a league record of 10-9-3. The high-point of the sea- son was a ten game unbeaten streak which stretched from Feb- ruary 5th to March 12th. The suc- cess in the regular season led to the Dutchmen's first playoff ap- pearance, a three game series against the Engineers of RPI. Union took the first game, but eventually lost in three'games, ending a highly successful sea- son. Union's surprising success led. to the naming of Bruce Delventhal as ECAC \Coach of the Year.\ as well as Chris Ford and Troy Stevensbeingnamedto the ECAC .. All Rookie Team.\ With the return of assistant coaches Kevin Si1eddon and Dave Green, the success of last year's squad should hopefully transfer to the 1994-95 season. lltis year's squad has 23 retum- ing players from last year, the only loss bei1tg captain Jeff Jiampetti. 11te Dutchmen have compensated for the loss of Jiampetti, by bringing in a fille freshmen class.

The defense cannot be complete without mentioning the Dutch- men goaltending. Luigi Villa and Mike Gallant have shared the goaltending role for the past three years. Despite playing poorly in his first fe\\ games of last season, Luigi Villa rebOtmded, posting a record of 5- 2-2. Villa recorded the best goals against, and save percentage of his career. Gallant had an excel- lent season as well. Before the 1992-93 season, Mike Gallant had never recorded a victory, going 0- 19-0 in his first two seasons. This all changed last year, as Gallant emerged as one of the top goaltenders in the nation. Gallant recorded a record of I 0-9-2, and a save percentage of .895. As a result of his superb season, Mike Gallant was named MVP, by his teammates. Gallant and Villa are joined this season by freshman Trevor Koenig. Koenig is from Edmonton Alberta. and was second in the Alberta Junior Hockey League with a 2.90 goals against average. He was also second in the league in save percentage at .904. Koenig's arrival is well antici- pated. by the coaching staff. Delventhal had this to say about Union's goaltending situation. \It will be a lot like last year. We'll see how the three of them are playing and go from there.\ Koenig is not the only freshman who will make an impact on this year's Dutchmen squad. There are three freshman forwards and one defensemen. Boe Leslie is from Carman, Manatoba and played for the Portage Terriers last year. He had an impressive season. netting 25-goals and 23- assists in 56-games. Leslie's of- fensive skills should help the Dutchmen. Charlie Moxham is also expected to make a positive impact on this years team. A member of the Calgary Royals. Moxham was voted \Most Inspi- rational Player\ last season. Moxham is a quick skater, and hi~ talents should be put to good use this season. Tite third freshman forward is J.P. Mac Cuilum. from Prince Edward Island. Mac Cullum made the team as a walk· on, and his physical play should contribute well to the future of the Dutchmen squad. TI1e sole fresh- men defenseman is Matt Willis. Willis played for Northwood School prior to attending Union, and he is a solid physical defensemen. Willis' defensive skills should contribute to the al- ready strong Union defense. TI1e 1994-95 Dutchmen squad seems quite solid. 1l1e team com- bines a great deal of experience with young talent. Last year· s team finished sixth in the ECAC. and appeared in their first play- off. TI1is year's schedule offers Union some new competition. The Dutchmen will face off against Providence College and Minnesota Duluth. These teams as well as the rest of the ECAC. realize that Union is a team to be reckoned with. As a result, the rest of the league will be gearing up for Union, something which the Dutchmen have to be prepared for. -~ - -

Many tribute the triumphant season to the training trip in Barbados last DecembeL Julie Ivanyi and Anne Rozwadowski came back just in time for this trip, after spending the term in France on term abroad.

Chris Riley, Mike Humphreys, Kevin Makarowski~ and Than Stuntz are earned AU-A.nrerican honors,. as they placed 6th out of 64 teams. Eighteen college records were broken, sophomores Mike Humphreys and Kevin Makarowski each breaking four individual records. Senior Scott Bowden also had an incredible championship, breaking 3 records. At the State Champion- ships, the Dutchmen ,placed a dose 3rd behind Hamilton and Hartwick. TI1is placement does not identify the strong. hold the Union swimmers had on the meet, winning 12 out of 20 e:vents. Unfortunately, theMen's team lost a great number of se- niors last year, but have gained nine rookies: Mark Anderson, Michael Darbyshire, Jeff Fawcett, Brian FieTd, Matt Glogowski, Adam Lev.ithan, Mike Macamber, Eric .Majeron, and Peter Spaulding. Tite team begins their season this Saturday with the Union Re- . lays. Titey are convinced their talent will follow through in this meet.

Men's Soccer Ends Season Colltilmedfrom page 24 out to be the toughest team Union has faced all year, After being outplayed for the 1najority of the first half. the Dutchmen found themselves down 2-0 when the whistle blew. TI1e second half was no easier on Uttion as Williams tallied two tnore goals before five minutes !tad elapsed. Ten ttlinutes later the score swelled to 5-0 and there it would stay. In this contest the Dutchmen were very much outplayed by a team that simply possessed superior talent. Union was happy to get out of Williams with still a fighting chance at the Capital Cup. an award given to the team with the best record among the leagues four capital region teams. Union. RPI. Al- bany. and Skidmore. Interestingly enough, Ut1ion happened to be playing Skidmore on the final day ofthe season and needed a win to bring home the hardware. But the Dutchmen came up just short as they came away with a 1-1 tie to close out the season. An entire 90 minutes of regu- lati.on play could not produce a goal in this ot\e. In the middle of the first fifteen minute overtime. Skidmore drew first blood. TI1e .goal came from a cross that the Dutchmen defense failed to clear resulting in a loose ball in front of the net. The Skidmore offense was able to capitalize a11dmake the score 1-0. However, this did not end the game because sudden death does not exist in college soccer. So the Dutchmen were still alive. a status that they took advantage of when Geoff Sipperly put the ball in the upper left comer off a pass from Chris Estafani. With the score tied at one. the game entered overtime number two. At this point both teams were tired and neither could muster a quality scoring opportunity. l11e game ended in a 1-1 tie leavingthecovetedCapi- tal Cup just out of Union's grasp. TI1is game ended the careers of the squad's four seniors: Stuart Polk. the anchor of the defense. Jeremy Liebhoff. arguably the Dutchmen's best offensive threat. Kevin Wilmot. the threeti me var- sity letterman, and Stu Savage, a vital asset to the team when he was not sidelined with kttee inju- ries. Despite the loss of tbese se- niors. the Dutchmen retain much of their talent fornext years cam- paign. With any help from a qnality recruiting class, next years Union soccer team should be much improved. Write for Sports! November 3, 1994, page 23 •

However, many of the underclassmen showed impressive skills giv- ing some hope for the future. On Wednesday the 25th, the Dutchmen faced Williams College. 1l1is was a team on quite a roll. They were 13-0 going into the match which gave them a ranking of num- ber one in the state and two in the nation. However, the Dutchmen had reason to be optimistic as they were 1-1 on the season against teams ranked number one in the state. But this Williams team fumed Co11tinued on page 23 TI1e memories oflast year's vic- tories brought an amusement and wonder about what this Head of the Fish had in store for them, and a hope that the biggest, ugliest fish head would be ours. After all, no other team plays for such a trophy. The men's and the women's novice and varsity teams partici- pated. Sixteen boats were formed in al[ The novice women raced three eight man boats, which placed ninth, twenty second and twenty fifth out of28 and one four boat which, even though crossed the finish line, was said to have not finished the race. TI1e novice n:en raced two eight boats, which placed fourth and fom1eenth out of 20, and one four boat which came in third out of 17. TI1e varsity teams were not in a state of euphoria, to say the least. Expectations faded, and in some cases survival was the main objective. However, some boats placed extremely well. The women's A and B heavyweight boats placed ninth and fifteenth out of 19, respectively. The light- weight men finished in third place out of the six boat race, and the heavyweight men placed eleventh out of 15. The women's heavy- weight four came in fifth out of 19, and the lightweight four placed third out of eight. In the men's races, the heavyweight four placed tenth of 17, and the lightweight four finished sixth of 10. Competition at the race in- cluded Williams, Colgate, Hobart and William Smith, UVM, Hamilton, Middlebury, Dart- mouth, Vassar, Skidmore, Al- bany, St. Lawrence, and RIT. For the varsity it was the last race of the season. They rowed with ev'- erything they had. For many, it was their last head race ever. 1l1e only disappointment was that Union couldn't bring home fish heads. 1l1e novice teams will be rowing on Saturday on the Mohawk River. With dreams now of sufficient sleep and new boats, it can safely be said that it was an interesting season. Good luck to both novice teams this weekend. Happy winter training.

The game was never really ill doubt, as your Dutchmen got out of the blocks quickly, opening up a 37 point lead before the first quarter had ended. They scored 13 more in the second, to finish all the scoring. 1l1e Mules can at least find some solace in the fact that they stonned out of the locker room after being hit by the Gar- net Tornado, and played an in- credible second half, only to come up short in the end, 50-0, The Union offense, which played so lethargically in last week's loss to the Coast Guard, rebounded nicely to score on it's first eight possesions (and for those of you keeping score at home, we're still not in the WAC). Although everybody chipped in for the victory; quar- terback Keith Lombardo led the way. Playing less than one full quarter, h.e completed 6 of 8 passes for 121 yards, threw two touchdowns, and ran for another. Lombardo alone accounted for infinetely more points than Muhlenberg (who, of course, had none). Kudos must also go out to the senior for earning a spot on the ECAC Upstate New York Honor Roll, the first time he has been s.o distinguished. The scoring opened early, with Matt Johnson (who went to the second best high school in Braintree, MA) recovering an ill- advised Mule attempt at an onside kick. Eight plays later, sophomore kicker Roger Egbert kicked a 35 yard field goal to put Union ahead to stay. Two plays after the ensuing kickoff, Union took the ball back again, when junior end Andy Leach sacked the quarterback, caused him to fumble, and recov- ered the ball at the Mule seven. Chris Irving scored on the next play, giving him 27 career touch- downs. He is now three short of the all-time Union record of 30, with only one game to play. Muhlenberg, given the oppurtunity to fumble once again, jumped at the chance. On their next play·frotn scrimmage, they blundered, with senior end Brad Julicher recovering the loose baiL One play later, Kojo Attah was in the end zone for Union, making the score 16-0. On It's third posession, Muhlenberg improved slightly, keeping the ball for all three of their alloted downs. However, they could not keep this streak going, as their punt was blocked on fourth, and Union returned Conti11ued on page 23

Approximately 6,000 people at- tended the conference and pre- sented their research. The Ioca- , . tion of this conference is of par- ticular interest because Seattle is at the leading edge of geological research. The Student Newspaper of Union College Since 1877 Schenectady, New York / J / / November I 0, 1994 ~ . •' JeffNebolini, Class of '96, as- sisted Professor Donald Rodbell in presenting two papers on the Glacial Record of Global Climate Change in the Andes of Ecuador and Peru. April Bemis, Class of '95, presented her thesis on Map- ping Control of Peatland Forms and Hydrology by Bedrock To- pography and Subsutface Stratig- raphy at the conference. George Shaw, Geology department chair- man and Professor John Garver also presented at the conference. Rodbell and Nebolini have been researching the glaciers in Peru and Ecuador to find glacial deposits. Alpine glaciers are very sensitive to global temperature change and can confirm that a rapid climate change has occurred Geology students April Bemis and Jeff N.ebolini wit/1 some of the research they recently presented (pl1oto by Josh Haines/TC) in that region. A special theme session, which they organized, examined records of abrupt cli- matic change atthe end of the last ice age. Numerous papers pre- sented at the meeting confirm that the very rapid and abrupt climatic oscillations which occurred in the North Atlantic region were felt globally. To date, no mechanism to explain these events has been universally accepted by the sci- entific community. At the end of the ice age, tem- perature changes occurred in a relatively short period of time. This result refutes an earlier no- tion that temperature changed slowly. Rather, the rapid climatic change which occurred at the end of the last ice age (ca. 10,000 years ago) occurred in centuries Continued on page 3 Union's Gree.n Lights Program Exceeds National Expectations by Martin Metz Comcordiensis Staff Two years ago Union joined the Greenlights program. Greenlights wa·s initiated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) which encourages the use of energy-efficient light- ing to cut costs and reduce air pollution. The program maintains that hanging alight bulb can cut down on air pollution. To generate elec- tricity, you must burn fuel. When the fuel burns, it emits toxic hi- products which pollutes the air supply. According to the EPA, lighting accounts for approxi- mately twenty to twenty-five per- cent off electricity used annually in the United States. Eighty to ninety percent of this lighting is used for businesses, offices, ware- houses, and buildings (such as Union College classrooms.). Union, in addition to many other College institutions, represent a good portion of this percentage. By making the lighting more ef- ficient, the college will reduce the production of electricity, which in tum reduces both the amount of energy produced and the amount of toxic pollutants released into the air. In regard to skeptics who think that Union is too small an institu- tion make any difference, the whole picture must be considered. Union's participation in this pro- gram is an important part of this whole. Greenlights is a nation- wide volunteer program which depends solely on membership. The greater its membership, the more successful. If Union, and many other small institutions like it around the Nation, participate in the Greenlights program, it will make a tremendous difference and greatly reduce our country's air pollution. It is analogous to putting together a puzzle. A puzzle cannot be completed with- out all of the pieces, no matter how small they might be. To date, Union has reduced emissions of certain carbon, sul- fur, and nitrogen pollutants by as much as a total of 77,513 pounds. That is 77,513 pounds less pol- lutants that Union students have L. Reed Tripp, Prominent Alumnus, Dies Courtesy of Tile Daily Gazette Haverford, Pa. - Economist and labor arbitrator L. Reed Tripp, formerly of Schenectady, died Tuesday at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital in Philadel- phia. He was 81. Born in Schenectady, Mr. Tripp graduated from the former Nott Terrace High School and was a Phi Beta Kappa graduate of Union College where he re- ceived his bachelor's degree. He also received his Ph.D. from Yale University in 1942. Dr. Tripp was an instructor of economics at Lehigh University from 1938 to 1942; professor of economics at the University of Wisconsin from 1950 to 1942 and field chairman of the Wisconsin Economics project at Gadjah Mada University, Jogjakarta, In- donesia, from 1957 to 1959; dean of the College of Business Ad- ministration and Frank L. Magee Professor at Lehigh University from 1964 to 1970. He was a pioneer in the area of labor relations and was involved with industry and government throughout his career. Mr. Tripp was the section chief and associ- ate director of disputes, Philadel- phia Regional War Labor Board from 1943 to 1945; economist and assistant coordinator of La- bor Relations for the Pittsburgh Plate Glass Co. and Libbey- Owens-Ford Glass Co. from 1946 to 1949; director ofthe Industrial Relations Research Center, Uni- versity of Wisconsin from 1953 to 1964; chief staff economist, Wage Stablization Board, Wash- ington, D.C., from 1951 to 1952; labor arbitrator from 1949 to 1994; and served as president for the Philadelphia Chapter, Na- tional Academy of Arbitrators in 1973. Mr. Tripp authored several books, monographs, articles and various other publications. Survivors include his wife, Jan Weyl Tripp; two sons, Thomas Reed Tripp of East Aurora and Continlled on page 3 to breathe in every day. Al- though, the initial cost of the bulbs is more expensive, the college wiU save money in the long run because the new fluorescent bulbs last much longer and require less maintenance. In addition, the col- lege saves money by using these bulbs because they use less elec- tricity. Union has already in- stalled energy efficient lighting in Science and Engineering, Hu- manities and Social Sciences buildings, Butterfield Hall, Schaffer Library and several other buildings on campus. Union continues its progress with the program, and has been mentioned twice in the EPA's nationwide publication. In just a few years, Union will have energy efficient lighting. In an increasingly environmental conscious world, Union is keep- ing up with, if not exceeding, the Nation's expectations. ·Index: , _News .......... ,. ... -~ ....... fl'_. ......... - •• J .. J.

' ' NEWS Hot, Sexy & Safer: Comedienne Suzi Landolphi Will Bring AIDS Message to Campus by Carrie Wheeler .. Concort(iensis Staff It may come as a surprise, but one of the most popular speakers · · on American college campuses is a middle-aged comedienne who makes her living cracking jokes about a deadly sexually transmit- ted diseases. Suzi Landolphi, who has a col- lege age kid of her own,. has found that humor is the best way to deliver the heavy message about AIDS. A sex educator and HIV /AIDS advocator since 1982, Landolphi's one woman show has toured over 5 00 campuses around th.e country. Nominated for the fourth consecutive year by the National Association ofCam- pus Activities as Lecturer of the Year, Landophi's humor has hit home. \Humor opens up an audience's heart,\ explains Landolphi; \It al- lows people to listen better and in turn, learn mqre. Other edu- cators have tried using heavy messages, but I feel that fear W \, ~\' 'I o v.. \) iv'(. the ~i~t o.t- l~v·~. iH lo pro1e,t a,aomt 1>,11)5 ol\d· ol~e:· STD>, •lwavs 1.1se Jalel<.<ondornl closes the heart and strains com- munication lines.\ Landophi is the center piece of Union's annual AIDS Awareness , Week and has appeared on such . national television shows as Geraldo and Maury Povich. Her concert special has been featured on Comedy Central, HBO and MTV. Landolphi 's new book, Hot Sexy and Safe·r was released Au- gust 15. \Talk does not equal action,\ remarked Landolphi. \Educators can talk until they are blue in the face but America still has the highestSTD rate in the world. We have to teach the public not only the facts but how to use them.\ Geology Research Presented Hot Sexy and Safer convinc- ingly proves that \Everybody has the right to be sexually proud and confident.\ Landophi's unique interactive and humorous ap- proach to sex education lets the audience absorb her message and walk away feeling better about themselves,. their relationships and their sexuality. Continued from page 1 (or less) rather than thousands of years, as previously thought. The study shows that there appears to be thresholds in global climatic system, which, when crossed, re- sult in extremely rapid climatic oscillations. If anthro- po genically-induced climatic warming causes the globe to cross one of these thresholds, global climate could change dramati- cally over a very short period of time. Rodbell and Nebolini's research also shows how climate is linked in different parts of the world. Professor John Garver pre- sented his research which falls into two categories. The first theme deals with the controversy of where British Columbia was located about 100 million years ago. The so-called Baja-British Columbia controversy revolves around whether the rocks of West British Columbia collided with North America at Mexico or at their present latitud~ of North America 1 00 million years ago. The second theme in his presen- tation deais. with the Olympic Mountains located on the west coast, excluding Alas!ca. At this sight, the rocks are rapidly being pushed up against each other and as a result are forming these mountain chains extremely rap- idly. They determined how fast the rocks cooled as they were pushed up from hot areas from underneath the ground and con- cluded that the rate is 1 krn per I million years. As a result, 12,000 km ofmountains have formed in a period of 12 million years. T'ne objective of this research was to determine the plate tectonic ge- ometry of Washington and the formation of mountain ranges and the timing and extent pf uplift in the mountain range. This then translates to the tectonic setting and seismic ha2;ards in Washing- ton. posed that the use of volcanic ash layer can be tested to validate the idea that British Columbia might have transposed itself to its present position by bypassing California. The volcanic ashes found in California must also be present in British Columbia to prove their theory. This can also explain the theory that California is moving northward along the San Andreas fault. Shaw used the chemistry of crystals found from old volcanic ash layers in central California. The crystal was called Apatite which is a mineral used in the fomiation of teeth. The conference provided those Union affiliates in attendance the chance to be recognized for their work. It also gave Bemis and Nebolini the opportunity to attend an event that only professors are usually invited to. \I've had a lot of positive ex- periences on my tour,\ explained Landolphi. \I've had gay and les• bian students come up to me and thank me for acknowledging their sexuality. Middle-age couples have told me they've learned more about themselves and their relationships. In fact, one of my tours was even ·sponsored by a coalition between the futer frater- nity Council and the Gay and Lesbian Alliance in Oklahoma. To me, that showed a true com- mitment to accepting human sexuality.\ What's in the future? Cur- rently, Landolphi is working on syndicating a late night talk show in L.A. about sex in the 90's. She also hopes to develop a series of sex education audio and video tapes. We Ain't Just Whistling Dixie by Stefanie L. Berliner Concordiensis Staff On November 14, at 7:30PM in Hu~anities 19, husband and wife sociologists, Howard and Judith Sacks will discuss who wrote the minstrel song \Dixie.\ l11e song \Dixie\ was the Con- federate national anthem, but it is also considered the anthem of the Southern white racists. The Sacks feel that the song was ac- tually written by the Snowden family. The Snowdens are an African-American family that lived in Ohio. This fact is dis- cussed in more detail in the book, Way Up North in Dixie: A Black Family's Claim to the Confeder- ate Anthem. sociology in 1975 at the Univer- sity of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. He has been a professor at Kenyon College since 1975,.and Howard Sacks just received a National Endowment for the Hu- manities Distinguished Teaching Professpr$_hip to conduct a three year course study called \The Family Farm in Community Life\ on the local agricultural life. In addition to authoring W try Up North in Dixie: A Black Famiiy's Claim to the Confeder- ate Anthem with his wife, Sacks has also written The Community Within: Black Experience In Knox County, Ohio, with Ric Sheffield, and Seems Like Ro- mance to Me. fu addition to writ- ing twelve articles and eleven re- views, Howard Sacks has also had three editorships. During the course of his professional expe- rience he has either lead or par- ticipated in thirteen conferences and twenty-one selected public appearances. November 10, 1994~ page 3 Marching Into the Electronic Age by Na,lini Gupta. Concordiensis Staff With the coming of the Bicen- tennial year, Union has marched into the electronic age with a bold stride. The college is proud to proclaim the fortune of hav- ing one of the finest computing environments for any college its size in the country, after intro- ducing its voice-mail, e-mail · and the new gopher systems to · the campus. This summer the college in- stalled the Campus Wide Infor- mation System. This system, · jointly sponsored by the Office of Computer Services and Schaffer Library, is a tremen- dous breakthrough for the Union . College community. It allows Union offices, departments and organizations to make informa- tion available quickly and inex- pensively. The gopher software, deriving its name from its de- velopers, the Golden Gophers of the University of Minnesota, also provides a world-wide in- terment which is as accessible as using the telephone. Union College students who wish to access information on the gopher system may do so without any log in procedure or personal account. The Steinmetz computer labs may be used to enter the system and the 'point-click' captioned icons guide the user easily through the system. Since May, the system has come to enable access from the VAX Cluster, unvax, Alice, unix workstations and personal computers directly connected to the College's Ethernet. Many representatives from a number of departments and offices have joined other insti- tutions world wide on the in- formation highway. These in- clude the Career Development Center, Central Scheduling, Office of Computer Services, Schaffer Library, Student Ac- tivities, the Computer Science department and the Electrical Engineering department. Beginning the first week of November, training sessions will be held on entering infor- mation into department's re- spective gopher areas. The sessions will consist of two or three 2-hour periods showing how information is fonnatted and made accessible. Train- ing sessions will continue to be scheduled as people request instruction.

OP-ED ~··OPINIONS Public Service Advisory: You Could Be Prosecuted by Sarah Ruth Evans Opinions Editor Picture this ... it is the year 1994 and what is the biggest criminal problem facing Union College. Is it, 1) Doids coming on campus and robbing us. 2) Students let- ting other students use their meal cards. 3) Underage drinking. 4) Vandalism on campus. If you choose number 2 then you were right. ,. For all of you who are unaware it is illegal for you to let someone else use your meal card and the food services manager can call the police. In this crime ridden city, you know that the menin blue are going to speed over to West col- lege and arrest you. This is a high priority arrest, tax code violators are dangerous criminals. The Schenectady police will not come on cam.pus for a mugging, but they will come for a tax code vio- lation. Going to jail would be a better altemativetoeatittg Union college food, because at least the bread will be fresh. The whole point of this article is to point out the idiosyncrasies 0f our present food service sys- tem. We are paying to much for our meal plans and to top it off we can not even share our meals with our friends and families. I asked if I could pay tax on meal plan this past weekend, so that I could share my meals and I was told that I can not because the other students on this campus did not want to pay for it. Now the man who told me this quoted me a price of a meal plan costing two- hundred dollars more, if we pay taxes. Now if I do my math correctly, $900 (the ten meal plan) x 0.07 (sales tax in Schenectady county)= $63. I would rather pay $63 more a term so that my friends can use my meal punches. Last week I ate a total of three meals cost. Now if I do the math again, I could have eaten at a fairly nice restaurant for what those three scmmptious meals. $900 a term • $200 for va:li-dine $700 to eat in Upperclass and West. $700/10 we.eks = $70 a week to eat at Upperclass. Now at ten meals a week that gives me $7 a meal. It only cost $5.50 to eat at Upperclass if you vali-dine a meal, so why am I subsidizing the college food services $15 a week or $150 a term. My point to this huge math problem is that we are paying too much for what we are served. I fi.gured that last week because I only ate three meals, each meal cost me $23.. The meals that I ate were not worth that kind of money. It is time to reexamine the way we pay for our board. In my opin- ion either we should lower the prices of meal plans or go to a straight declining balance .. A de- clining balance seems to be the best system. President Hull wants everybody to be on some sort of even playing field and I agree that it is important. I recommend that the meal plan operate so every student has to have $200 minimum declining balance. Then require all the freshmen to have a declining bal- ance equal to the tost of fi.fteen meals and theu upperclassmen can choose the amount ofdeclin- ing balancelhey want, but in cer- tain increments s~tch as the c.ost often or seven meals.

I'll first list my reasons for favoring the tri- mester system,. then discuss the issues raised by the proponents of the semester system. College Calendar\ which ap- peared this fall. The authors ex- pressed their frustration with the current calendar, especially the \forced march\ from January to June and the hectic pace of the ten week term. I agree with them that these aspects ofthe trimester sys- mester classes are typi- cally 50 minutes three times a week for 14 weeks, for a total of 2100 minutes. The difference is about 7% less time for the trimes- ter compared to a 14 week semes- ter, an identical time compared to a 13 week semester.. Of course we could make dass periods to-elite colleges listed, including, Skidmore and Trinity. They also rated Union as one of the top 20 \Party Schools\ among the 254 schools listed. It is not the fault of the students that Union is con- sidered by them to be a party school. The fault rests squarely on our shoulders. I understand that such surveys.are unscientific, but it suggests that we an, on both sides of this issue, could be chal- lenging our students more. If we were to go to a semester system, its proponents are con- vinced they will be able to in- crease student output and get in a \full semester's\ work. I hope that this will be the case, but I am not convinced. As stated earlier, class time will not be increased appre- ciably. Time outside class will be increased by 40% (14 vs. 10 weeks). However, student com- mitment to the course will be de- creased by 33% ( 4 vs 3 courses to study for). It is hard for me to imagine that the extra 7% out-of- class time will be sufficient to al- a semester system, it makes even more sense under the trimester (although class size would be in- creased even more), because it would be easier for faculty to cre- ate one tenn with a lower teach- ing load which would free more time for scholarly activity. The trimester system offers ad,.. vantages not possible under the semester system. Its most appeal- ing aspect to me is its flexibility. It allows us to schedule our large introductory courses twice a year, giving students scheduling op- tions not available under a semes- ter system. It allows faculty to schedule tlieir cldad so that they have a lighter load one tenn to do research. It sets faculty teaching loads to an average of two con- current courses, whereas the se- mester will require three for at least one of the semesters. It al- lows science, and even some en- gineering, students to go on terms abroad. The number of science students going abroad would cer- tainly decrease under a semester system. It also reduces schedul- ing conflicts. With our extensive General Education Program and more demanding majors, Union has more· requited courses than most o1.'het liberal arts colleges. Scheduling these courses at ap- propriate times is difficult enough under the trimester system. It will be a nightmare l}nder the semes- tem are its major draw- b:!cks. The authors present an alternate cal- endar which combines the standard semester system with a decrease in the number of courses required for graduation from 36 to 32 and a re- \Embedded in the working paper are other changes in the current program that are not directly related to the semester calendar, such as the reduction of faculty teaching load from six to five low the extra books and papers promised. However, I wish them luck. Another aspect of the semester system touted by the authors of the working paper The aspect of the proposed se- mester system that would have the largest effect on our current program is the reduction of the number of courses required for graduation from 36 to 32. This would have an effect on the num- ber of courses required for the major and General Education. Many semester schools require as few as eight courses for a science major whereas we require ten in Biology. Although this differ- ence may seem small to some, it is important for two major rea- sons. The first is that these extra courses are upper level and there- fore more sophisticated in their content. Our students are edu- cated with more breadth and depth than those from an eight course major program. They are exposed to more concepts and methodology and can compete very well with students from schools with more prestigious names. Once they leave Union, our students return amazed at how much they know relative to those from other schools, no mat- ter whether the student is in medi- cal school, graduate school or pharmaceutical sales.

Ients. These issues are all sepa- rate and should be discussed in- dividually with regard to their ef- fect on our current program. Our current starting and stop- ping dates are inconvenient for many, especially our late gradu- ation date, and the 23 week mara- thon in the winter/spring is try- ing to both students and faculty. These problems could easily be alleviated under the trimester sys- tem by splittingwintertenn. For instance, this year we could have started classes in early September and had a full exam week and a one week break over Thanksgiv- ing. Three weeks of winter term could be completed before De- cember 16th, followed by a two week Christmas break. Then we could have seven more weeks of winter term, a week of exams, two weeks of spring break, and we could graduate in late May. This may provide some difficulties for the terms abroad, but it would solve many of the concerns people have over the current cal- endar while retaining the advan- tages of the trimester system. With faculty resolve to ensure that the three-week pre Christmas ses- sion is not wasted, it could work. longer if we wished, and semes- ter length differs among schools from 12 to 15 weeks, so the above comparison is only a rough ap- proximation. As I have always understood it. the trimester was originally conceived to have been academi- cally comparable to a semester, therefore the roughly comparable amount of time allotted to the classroom. This topic is the one that generates the most heat when faculty discuss the two systems. The semester camp accuses the other of force-feeding their stu- dents and making them jump through hoops, and the trimester camp often assumes the other could work their students harder tO get?n .a 'run semester's work in ten weeks. This dichotomy could occur due to a basic misunder- stan4ing of each group regarding the tf;ii\Ching of the other's disci- ,pline, .and it cannot be easily re- solved.

This miliar, Grinnell's, has only a one week longer summer break than Union. Embedded in the working pa- per are other changes in the cur- rent program that are not directly related to the semester calendar, such as the reduction of faculty teaching load from six to five course equivalents. Of course I am in favor of a reduced load- who wouldn't be-but it will al- most certainly lead to larger aver- age class size unless the faculty is enlarged, even if the number of courses required for graduation is reduced to 32 (a 16% reduction in teaching time and an 11% reduc- tion in courses).

Its effect on our program would depend on how we chose configure the se- mester schedule and major re- quirements. There will also be a log-istic squeeze in finding enough classrooms and laborato- ries for the new schedule.

...... , November 10, 1994, page 6 LETTERS. How Fair Is tbe Current Work-Study Pay Scale? To the Editor, I would like to call to everyone's attention what I con- sider to be one of the truly un- fair aspects of Union College. As a work study employee in our library, I earn the federal minimum wage of $4.25 per hour. I will admit that a work study job is hardly deserving of a high wage, but why must work study employees at Union Col- lege work for the lowest pos- sible wage that the federal gov- ernment will permit? I know stu- dents at other colleges and uni- versities who earn up to $5.25 per hour on work study jobs. Union College has ~pparently forgotten about the fact that about a century ago, our law- makers passed legislation to pre- vent the exploitation of labor. As a work study employee, I am not allowed to work more than ten hours per week. Thus, I can never earn more than ei.ghty-five dollars in any two week period. A Resident Assis- tant (RA}, on the other band, earns one hundred dollars every two weeks, and a Head RA re- ceives and impressive two hun- dred dollars every two weeks! I am a person of humble back- ground, and I am only slightly exaggerating when I say that I need every penny I can get. For some reason, however, my bi- weekly paycheck is less than one-half that of a Head RA who may or may not .come from a well-to-do family. Does this make sense to you? Union Col- leges hands out large, biweekly paychecks of at least one hun- dred dollars to RA's and Head RA's who may not necessarily need this money, while finan- cially strapped worked study employees are paid the federal minimum wage, thus receiving no more than eighty-five dollars' ev- ery two weeks. Forcing work study employees to earn no more than the federal minimum wage is surely one of the best ways to breed bitterness and animosity among Union Col- · lege .students. No wonder there are so many unhappy people qn this campus. For the sake affair- ness, work study employees at Union College really ought to earn more than just $4.25 .per hour. At least we ought to have the option of receiving a pay raise. It is hard for me to believe that the Head RA is entitled to earn- ing more than twice as much money per pay period than a work study employee. .Sincerely, Amand Rao, '96 Everyone interested in becoming a member of The Concordiensis staff should come to our weekly staff meeting today.

You were all so nice and friendly. My sister and brothers had lots of fun, too. My brothers loved the Haunted House but my sister was scared. I waited for them at the end because I am still afraid to go in to Haunted Houses. The clown was really great. She made me a dogball'oon that I brought to Nursery school to show my friends. Thank you for taking the time to make Halloween safe and fun for me and my brothers and sis- ters. You made us· all. feel special. Your friendly lion, Michelle Miltner (age 3) To the Editor, I want to complement Dining Services for the decorations they had in Upper-class Dinning this Halloween; It was wonderful to see that they had gone all out for us somewhat ungrateful students. Halloween is an easy holiday to forget because nobody gets a va- cation. a few of us still trick or treat, but for some of us, as kids Halloween was one of the best times. You got to dress like some- Micllelle Mitner, age 3, in her Hallowee11 costume. one totally different from your normal self, my personal favor- ite costumes were Wonder Woman or Princess Lea, and eat candy till you became ill. It was so much fun then. Walking up to Upper-class Dinning on Oct. 31 and seeing the cobwebs, candied apples, tablecloths and everyone dressed up, made it all fun again.

STUDENT FORUM November lO, 1994, page 7 Me~t The Candidates For Freshman Class Representatives . ., :·. . D'(J.·Not Forget to Vote Inside Of The College Center Friday, November 11th .:. ::·~ ; Akinwunmi Sawyerr My name is Akinwunmi Sawyerr. I was born on the 9th of September 1977 to James and Rose Sawyerr who both gradu- ated from Union College and The College of Saint Rose respec- tively. I am the second of four children and the only son of my parents. I am a patient, understanding and hard working person who is not happy unless everyone else is happy. Moreover. I am easy to talk to. Of all the attributes a good leader should possess, I believe sensitivity is the most important. A good leader should he sensitive to the needs of the people he is serving and he should take the time to understand them. 1 am sensitive, and this characteristic the lord bestowed upon me sepa- rates me from my fellow candi- dates. , This statement may be differ- ent from any other statement you have read. This is because I am not your typical political leader- period. I tell the truth and I will fulfill my duties and obligations as the president of freshman class. So if you want sensitivity, service and leadership vote me, Akinwunmi Sawyerr as your class president. Amy Rilling There are five hundred and forty six of us. We come from all over the United States, and from all corners ef the world. We are the class of 1998! All five hun- dred and forty six of us have had seven_weeks to explore our new home, meet our new friends, and begin a new life here at Union. Now, all five hundred and forty six of us have to make our first decision as a group. We, as the freshmen class now face choos- ing the class president. I, AMY RILLING, am the person you should choose. Some of the candidates rum1ing may impress you with what they did in high school. If that is the case I should·tell you that I was the President of Student Council, the Vice-President of the School Band, the Vice President of the Stock Investors Club, the Presi- dent of the Spanish Honor Soci- ety, and most importantly the President of my Senior Class. So in the case ·of experience, yes, I am experienced in leading groups of people and in organizing events. If you, the freshmen class, de- cide to elect me as class president at the elections on November 11th, I will work hard not to dic- tate to you, but rather, to listen to you. The point of being a class representative is to work for the class not against it. I can not promise you better cafeteria food, 01 more social options on cam- pus, all I can give you is one hun- dred percent dedication on my part. When the Class of 1998 de- cides what they want to me to do, that is what my goal will be. As a candidate for class president I can cmly make one promise and that is to listen to you and work for you, the freshman class. I am not running to get a power trip, I am not running to change everything on campus, I am running because I want to be the voice for five hundred and forty six very impor- tant people on this campus, the Freshmen! So, on November 11th, please vote for AMY RILL1NG! Henrick Haeckel Hello, my name is Henrik. Some of you may know me, most of you probably do not. I am a Political Science major and I re- alize as Freshmen and Fn:lshwymn we have many grave concerns at stake in this academic year. Food Service is over charg- ing us while reducing quality, Campus safety, the design forth~ new library, college participation in urban redevelopment of the neighborhood, the conditions of the residence halls and so many more issues are at stake. I know that this election will be one of random probability, since we as class do not know each other very well. Iwishmyfellowcandidates and look fmward to the up com- ing election.

Over the course of this campaign I have had the opportunity to meet and talk with many of you about your ideas and interest for the upcom- ing year. You have many differ- ent and equally important con-· cerns and 1 plan on addressing as many of them as possible. As you cast your vote in tomorrow's elec- tion, please select the candidate who can best represent your in- terest. I will bring to this position the experience 1 have had in similar leadership roles in high school; President of my Senior class, Edi- tor-in-Chief of the newspaper, Governor of Student Govern- ment, Captain of my sports teams, and President of a community service organization. Experience is going to play a crucial role in the equation of success in this year's administration. In compar- ing the records of myself and my opponents, you will find that my well-rounded past experiences separate me as the most qualified candidate for office. As a representative in hall gov~ ernment I have become aware that Student Government is a very powerful organization on this campus and the decisions it makes have tremendous influence on every student here at Union. A determined, goal-oriented leader is the key to successfully representing the needs of the freshman class- I believe that I fill this role and hope for your sup- port.

Michelle VanderLoon Hi! My name is Michelle V anderLoon and I hope to be- come your Freshman Class Sec- retary. First off, I'd like to tell you a little about my involvement in High School. I was Treasurer and President.ofthe Key Club (a community service club that is affiliated with Kiwanis), Presi- dent of the French club for two years, a Peer Leader for two years, a National Honor Society member and an active member in many other activities. I was nominated as Ambassador to the Hugh O'Brian Youth Leadership Seminar, a foundation that en- courages and builds on leadership potential. I was student of the Year and awarded the Principal's Recognition Award for pride in my school. In my community, I worked with an organi711tion (Ca- nine Companions for Indepen- dence) in which I raised and trained a service dog for the physically challenged. I hope to make my years at Union just as outstanding and productive. I've started by becoming an active member of the Crew Team. This is a very exciting year in that as freshmen, we are entering Union College in its Bicentennial Year. Therefore, we should strive to make our class stand out amongst all others in school spirit, participation, and academics. We can do this by electing peers with enthusiasm, compassion, vision, and integrity for class office. I hope to fulfill these characteris- tics .as Class Secretary. By ful- filling each task presented to me with efficiency, organization, and enthusiasm, I will be able to reach our class goals. Also, I am always open to new ideas. Some ideas I wish to bring to you are establish- ing a photo-telephone book for Union. I will also strongly push for freshmen being allowed to have cars on campus or if that is not possible, to establish a \shuttle system\ that will take stu- dents to the mall, grocery store, and other frequented places. I'll also support the continuance of our trimester system. We can launch our class to new and bet- ter heights. The sky is the limit! However, goals are dreams with deadlines and therefore we must act now by voting. If you vote for me, I will try my hardest to help our Class leave an imprint not only in our school, but in our lives as well. So remember to Vote Dutch, Vote VanderLoon!

. ' November 10, 1994, page 8 STUDENT FORUM ' .... More Freshman Student Forum Statements Suzanne Dougherty After two months on this cam- pus we all now have some idea of what we love here and what we hate; what we think works well and what is inconvenient or a problem. Below is a list of goals and strategies that I would address if I were elected to the Student Forum as freshman representa- tive. Increased Safety and Improved Escort Service As we all know, there have been numerous problems on the cam- pus concerning student safety. This is a problem that has been, and must be, addressed seriously and with great efficiency. A few solutions: expanding the escort service to include either more vans or a walking escort and more and brighter lighting. Broadening Social Options Forthose UniQn students who are not big fans of the \fraternity party scene\ the social options are limited. More attempts need to be made to recruit outside orga- nizations and lecturers onto the campus. Expanding the Use of the Vali- Dine Card Every Union College student\'s savior, the Vali-Dine card be- comes most students' way of pay- ing for almost everything.- With this in mind, I would like to ex- pand the scope of the card to the laundry facilities and the college bookstore. Better Laundry Facilities Scenario: you go to the laundry room to find that there are no washers available or in working order. You wait twenty-five min- utes until one is available at which point you notice that the washer is eating your quarters. Many kicks and about $3.00 later it fi- nally works. Sound familiar? More and better quality washers are needed for those students who prefer to wear clean clothes. Employing the Housekeeping Staff on Weekends The one time of the week when the halls and bathrooms are the least dean/most disgusting is the weekend. The one time when the housekeepers are not working is the weekend. Employing the housekeeping staff for the week- end would make the dorms a more pleasurable place to live on the weekends. It is now Union College's Bi- centennial year, the perfect time to make changes on the campus for the better. While the Student Forum does not have the power to make all the changes it does have the power to make a differ- ence. With your vote I will be able to be a part of this and lend my ideas to the Student Forum as freshman representative. Vote for the candidate with the innovation to change. Vote for Suzanne Dougherty. Laurel Kaitlyn Salzman Hi! I'm Laurel. (Laurel Kaitlyn Salzman, but I like to go by Laurel.) You've probably seen me around; I'm the one that wears a brown sweatshirt and an orange hat. As you know, I would like to be a Class Representative for the Class of 1998. As freshmen, we've only lived here at Union for a month and a half. That doesn't give us much time tore- ally formulate solid opinions on big issues, because we're still try- ing to figure out what it's all about. So, I'm not going to ramble on about stuff! ike: \This ... needs to be changed at Union\ and \Believe me, if you elect ME all of your dreams will come true\ or \If I'm elected I promise to do this and this and ... \ or \You just wait and SEE the changes that take place on campus once I'M elected\. No. What I can promise, though, is.that I'll be dedicated, do my job to the best of my abil- ity, and always be open for sug- gestions. What more can you honestly ask for? I guess you'll just have totrust me, and wait and see for yourself. Just in case you forgot (because it took you so long to read my HUGE, LENGTHY message to The People), my name's Laurel. It's a good name to store in some little compartment in your brain. You won't be sorry. I promise. 'Til be good.\ If you have any further questions regarding anything at all, write to me-it'sbox 1903. I'dliketomeet 'Graham Bryce Are you tired of the same old routine? Are you tired of getting drunk every weekend? Are you wishing that Union's student body would become more spir- ited at home athletic events? Are you one of the hundreds, if not thousands, of Dutchmen search- ing for an alternative? I am tired of always asking questions and feeling confused; I want an al- ternative! I want to see the class of 1998 lead the student body to- wards the answers to these and many more questions. One goal would be to increase the number of dances. These dances would be open to the entire student body, but on occasion I would encour- age every class to have a separate dance of their own. I would like to have students fotm a spirit club or a pep band. These new orga- nizations help create a winning atmosphere for all of Union's team·s, especially when a team is expe~iencing a tough season. Above all else, I want to encour- age every student and faculty member to become involved in Union College's events. lbelieve that with everyone's efforts, the phrase \There is nothing to do,\ will change into \There is too much to do.\ Do you-really want to help create new altematives, or are you, instead, only interested in complaining? If you are, in- deed, tired of the same old rou- tine, vote for Graham Bryce as vice-president of the class of 1998. I am from Casper, W¥oming. My main interests are tennis, golf, and traveling. My key academic interest is math, but I enjoy most other subjects. I have participated in Student Senate, National Honor Society, drama club, Span- ish club, tennis varsity team, Crime Stoppers, and th,e math team in the past. Tammie Rosen Hey, What's up? My name is Tammie Rosen and I am run- ning for Secretary of the class of '98. I am sure you are asking yourselves why you should vote for me. Well, I have plenty of good reasons. I take a true vested interest in what goes on in cam- pus, which is why I would like to hold this position. As Class Sec- retary I will be able to find ways to improve daily campus life. I am a very vocal person, therefore I have no problems in speaking for or against issues that are impor- tant to the freshman class. I am very creative and feel that my cre- ativity and ideas could help with the planning of events for our class. I have lots of experience with planning events and raising money from high schooL In high school, I was responsible for ob- taining and organizing funds for our prom and many other events. Organization and efficiency are my greatest strengths. These two qualities are essential in creating class unity and successful class events. I feel that I can and will do a tremendous amount for the class of '9 8. Your vote fonne will ensure good things to come for the freshman class. Mea,g,han Ruth Kanser Hi, I am Meaghan and I am nm- ning for representative of the freshman class. I am a good !ism tener and as a class rep will sup- port your needs. I will get down to the grass roots of our most important issues \!don't want to sell anything, buy anything, or process anything as a career. I don't want to sell anything bought or processed or buy anything sold or processed or process anything sold, bought or processed. \ -Say Anything This past .summer, I donated some of my time working with migrant workers children inN orth Carolina. Now, I would like to donate my time to make our class needs understood and acted upon by the administration. Please vote for me Meaghan Ruth Kanser as class representative. Stacey Dossman Stacey Dossman I have always been actively involved in my community and have voiced my opinion in order to carry out change for the betterment of my surroundings. I spent the last four years serving as Treasurer of my Class for the Student Senate in my High School. Being at Union for the past two months has afforded me many wonderful new oppor- tunities. I am running for Fresh- man Representative for the Class of 1998 in order to help maintain the high standards that Union has to offer and to promote change for things that we need to be accom- plished in order to make our time at Union more pleasurable. Toby Proctor What do you want to gain from your Freshman year of college? New experien<:Jes? Indepen- dence? Representation of your views? If so, a solid line of com- munication between the student body, fa cult<;, and administration is essential. My name is Toby Proctor,. and as President, the class of 1998 will achieve these goals and reach new heights. My experience with student governments spans from being the president of a small a cappela singing group to, my present po- sition, the Treasurer .of Davidson Hall. These jobs require the ca- pability to tackle many types of responsibilities and to c~ them out precisely. It also requires a strong relationship between stu- dent and faculty. I think that my experiences will show their im- portance when applied to the of- fice·ofPresident of the Freshman class. What I want to gain most from our Freshman year here is to see our class become the most out- spoken, listened to classes the fac- ulty has ever encountet:ed. To achieve this, every person in the class has to know how student government works. Once we know this, we will know the ap- propriate steps with which we can voice our opinions. I want every one to become familiar with the format of the government and how it can work for them as a whole and an individual. While feeling out my boundaries as class president, I wjll incorporate the views of the class members in all ofmy decisions. This is the best way to represent the class and to express to the faculty how we feel. If I am elected, I promise to keep an open mind to all of your views and to make ·sure that we have an impact on the schooL A vote for me will ensure a strong voice for the whole class and a bright future for the Class of 1998. Jason Beckman Beckman .... Jason Beckman. In my candidacy for President of the class of 1998, I'm not guarantee- ing that the Marriot Food Service will be ousted, Big Head Todd will be playing with The Samples, or that beer pong will become a varsity sport at Union. I am not making any ·promises to the stu- dents that I cannot fulfill. If elected for presidetn, I will be in office to listen and respond to your needs. By electing me, you ~re giving yourself a better chance of being heard. I will b.e the voice for the students by mak- ing sure that your concerns and needs will be met.

More Freshman Student Forum Statements James DiStefano To say anything otherthanl am the best candidate for ferum would be a lie. My name is James DiStefano. In high school I was on the school committee as well as the curriculum steering com- mittee. I was never afraid to.speak up, even if I made an ass out of myself. When sober, my ideas are as good as gold. If you want a rep- resentative that you can relate to, I'm your man. I will try to im- prove the food in West. Also, I would like to see if there is a way to stop the muggings on campus; Finally, I would like to make condoms more accessible to the student body. In my opinion, the food service at West lacks variety, flavor, good vegetarian options, and let's not beat around the bush, it's crappy. I am sure that I am not the only one in this school who is sick of pizza and pasta every day. •• > -t' • • •• Also, I am sick of almost break- ing my teeth on the lumps in .the mashed potatoes. In addition, I am fonning a heart condition as a result of all ofthehatnburgets I bave eaten since I have been here. Our school employs a profes- sional food service, and it is about time they started acting like pro- ft:ssionals. To solve this problem I would implement standards that would have to be adhered to ev- ery day. These standards would include a limit as to how many times a dish can be served. in a week, a tasting of the food to be sure that it is serviceable, and a requirement of several options for the vegetarian diners. The crime rate at Union has considerably increased this year. There is no reason why a student should have to be worried about walking across campus without a personal bodyguard. Steps to stop this problem could be to hire more security or to improve light- ing on campus. Another issue of concern to me is the availability of condoms on campus. Union is not exactly Sunday school, students here are sexually active. In order to en- sure that every student knows where to go to get a condom at any hour-of the day, they should be placed in every bathroom. In addition to the ideas that I have mentioned, I have many more. I am willing to speak up about any problem our class is facing, and I won't shut up until we have our way. Give me a chance, I promise that you wHl not be disappointed. Matthew Cohen Behold are the personal state- ments of several candidates for positions in our student forum. Although my opponents talk about what they might have ac- complished while on student gov- ernment is high school, my main concern is about what will be done in college. As .all of you can see, college life is more compli- cated that just studying and par- tying. The student forum is here to listen to your comments and suggestions to make life at Union less complicated. By electing me to the student forum there will always be someone to answer your questions. If you ask my friends they would tell you that I am loyal to my word. My main goal on the student forum would be to protect the freedom that the administration gives us and an- swer your questions. The fact is that I was not on stu~ dent government in high school. I am running for this position to get a taste of what politics is. One issue that it important to me is that of Dining Services. If you want to take a break from studying late at night and get something to eat, you should be able to. As a mem- ber of the fotum, I will also ex- amine the use of the profit of our meal .plans to Dining Services. I hope my statement is closely examined and that all of you will take the time to read everyone else's statements thoroughly be- fore deciding on who to vote for. Thank you for taking the time to hear my point. Jessica Weaver even eaSier to ptck up.

A Recipe For Confusion: A Brain Tap Shuffle by Alex Shapiro Living Editor When time starts slipping by a little faster than you suspect it should and -the skin on your hands starts looking too thin for its own good, it's time to break south and head to Stark Island. Stark Island is a cozy little nook just west ofMargaritaville and south of Nirvana that is the native home of the last free- roaming wild Stark birds of New York state. It's always warm there, and the cupboards are never bare. The island has all the modern amenities: a large television andV.C.R. with all kinds ofmovies and cable, a big stereo that isn't afraid to play disco music as loud as you can take it, a toaster oven and a real oven. The birds have names, Mr. Stark and Mrs. Stark. No-one knows for sure what the birds do all day, rumor has it that they lead secret double lives as mild mannered reporters at the Sun, but there's no reason to believe that they don't fly around watching over the smaller birds in town al'l day. Everyone is welcome at Stark Island, it's like Cheers without Cliff Claven. A few years ago, someone even taught the Starks to speak English. Now they talk all the time, telling jokes they pick up during the day and relating po- litically relevant news that is often eerie in its accuracy. They know about UFOs Mr. Stark even claims to have been kid- napped. Mrs. Stark is a wicker basket designer in her spare time, she says she gets her in- spiration from the moon. When the doors to Stark Is- land are open and the light is on, the picnic begins. Every sup-: per tops the last as the wild birds work their strange magic over roasts of beef, unbelievably healthy bread, that is always warm, com, mashed potatoes with gravy like they talk about in \Naked Lunch;\ if you can imagine it, they have it. It is a table spread in the wilderness. It is the call of the wild. It is a river flowing in all directions at once. It is the sound of one hand clapping. It is always hard to leave. The importance of Stark Is- land to life here at Union can- not be overestimated. Everyone needs someplace to go where no-one is going to get on your case. The island is just far enough from the mainland and it isn't swamped with people. Hanging loose is the rule, it's in the air, it's in the wine, it's in the special vinegar on the salad, it's inescapable. Going to the island is like say- ing good.,bye to the world for a little while. Just like jumping off the spinning wheel and watching it go around on mo- mentum. for a while; then watching it slow down and al- most stop; then jumping on a different wheel, at least it's a fresh wheel. That's what a tri- ''mess\- ter system can do to a human. It's like a circus here. It's bad enough that our bodies run on twenty-five hour cycles and the universe on twenty- four. Places like Stark Island are too rare in academia. Well, that's really a shame, but fortu- nately Mrs. Stark was kind enough to shareherwinterrem- edies for the Schenectady brain- tap shuffle bug that takes over our campus usually around this time of year: The Wild Stark Recipe for Beating the Brain Tap Shuffle: Ingredients; One bottle wine (warm cider may be substituted if you are under twenty-one, or don't drink) A couch (A bed with lots of stuff on it will work in a cinch) Lots ofFood; it doesn't matter exactly what it is as long as you honestly like it and it isn 't some healthy stuff you 've falsely con- vinced yourself you like.

That's what a tri- \mess\- ter system can do to a human. It's like a circus here. It's bad enough that our bodies run on twenty-five hour cycles and the universe on twenty- four. Places like Stark Island are too rare in academia. Well, that's really a shame, but fortu- nately Mrs. Stark was kind enough to share her winter rem- edies for the Schenectady brain· tap shuffle bug that takes over our campus usually around this time of year: The Wild Stark Recipe for Beating the Brain Tap Shuffle: Ingredients: 0fle bottle wine (warm cider may be substituted if you are under twenty-one, or don't drink) A couch (A bed with lots ojstuff on it will work in a cinch) Lots of Food; it doesn't matter exactly what it is as long as you honestly like it and it isn't some healthy stuff you 've falsely con- vinced yourse!f you like. A Good Movie (preferably one where the plot involves a lot of suffering that you are not a part of or one that you have seen enough times to know a lot of the words). Whatever Other Things You Can Find That Make You Feel Good; this one is up to personal taste, you know what you like better than the Starkies care to know. ·A Blanket Optional: a cordless phone with an answering machine. Instructions: Lay on the couch until you get bored and cold. Get up and round 1:1p all the other ingredi- ents. Tum on the movie and start consuming all the consum- able goods. Occasionat:ly think about how busy you should be doing other things, it helps you to enjoy not doing it all the more. Do not, under any cir- cumstance, answer the phone. It could be anyone, you might have some meeting that can't happen without you, or it could be anything that you don't want to deal with, if it's really im· portant they 'Ill eave a message and you can call them tomor- row. Surrender yourself to complete relaxation. When you wake up the next day, take it slow, no fast movements. Af- ter a couple of days everything will be just fine if not just try it again.

Directed by Branagh. Rated R, Tri-Star Pictures. Rating: **112 (out offour) by Larry Paska Of the numerous adaptations of the classic horror story, Franken- stein, this version certainly can be considered the most faithful to the original work written by MarY Shelley in the nineteenth century, when she was only 19 years old. However, while some dialogue is actually taken line-for-line from the book, whaPs left is a visually- unappealing mess, created by some of the finest filmmakers in the business today: The second retelling in a pro- posed horror trilogy by Francis Ford Coppola (he plans to remake The Wolf Man next; he co-pro- duced Frankenstein), Franken- stein is not directed by Coppola (as wasBram Stoker's Dracula in 1992), but tUrns the helm over to Branagh. noted for transforming challenging Shakespeare into popular, well-crafted·films. One would expect Branagh to do the same for classic European litera- tore, especially since Franken- stein is far easier to work out in film than Shakespeare is. Unfor- tunately, Branagh's debut in mainstream American filmmak- ing is sorely below his usual stan- dards. As Victor Frankenstein, Branagh continues to prove him- ')elf a competent actor, handling his roles with ease. He plays the brilliant scientist, passionate about creating life from death, where be- comes his goal when his mother dies in child birth. He falls in love with and plans to marry his adopted sister, Elizabeth (Carter), but only after he perfonns his ex- periments on recreating life. A professor at his university (Cleese, unrecognizable and unfunny in his role) dies suddenly, and it is his intelligent brain that goes into the making of Frankenstein's cre- ation. A friend and fellow student (Hulce) persuades Victor not to go overboard, but he does, alienating his family in the tiame of science. The result: a malevolent being that breaks free of Victor's laboratory story arid examination of ''where only wants a friend and is instead man should draw the line in sci- banished by all who see his ence\ it wants to be.

For all this pretension, there is little explanation. It would be hard to consider Branagh over-his-head in this film because his first film, the dif- ficult Henry V, was nothing short of a masterpiece. However, he simply has not created an excit- ing film. Even his Peter's Friends, which was nothing more than a grown-up brat-pack film, did more for comedy than this does for horror/fantasy. Quinn, as the ship captain whose crew is stranded on a ice- berg in the Arctic, is wasted in a small role as a man who listens to Victor's explanation ofhis cre- ation. Holm, as Victor's father, is also wasted as the man who is proud of his son's accomplish- ments. However, we never real- ize what the whole creature-cre- ation has really done to him. Set between 1773 and 1794, the film might depict the past as a bit more technologically-advanced than it was, including a giant sac- like structure attached to the ceil- ing of Victor's lab that suggests the mother alien's cocoon in Aliens rather than an eighteenth- century scientific invention. Overall, though, it succeeds in being more faithful to the origi- nal source material than Dracula was, as well as being far more entertaining. Nevertheless, Coppola should stay away from horror films; he doesn't do the whole concept behind these sto- ries justice, preferring stylish scenes over logical stories. Ev- eryone tries hard to make it work, but it falls flat. It also remains one of the most grotesque and disgusting films to come around recently, with every- thing from dismembered anns to ripped-open hearts plainly dis- played for viewer pleasure. Just be warned of a truly unnecessary climax that forsakes any misgiv- ings that might have been forgot- ten in favor of cramming too many details in without sufficient expla- nation.

Even though the teams were not Facing for fish heads, they proved their racing superi- ority against the opposition. Sepa,rate races were set for A, B, and C boat competition for both the men and the women. The men raced three eight man boats. The A, B, and C boats placed first, second, and first in their respective races. Their com- petition included RPI, Skidmore, and Albany. The women raced two eight man boats,. which both came in .second in their races. Their opposition included Skidmore and Albany. With the end of the crew sea- son having arrived and departed, the season, although not com- pleteiy victorious, proved to be a stepping stone for building an ex- tremely strong team for the spring. The twilight of winter training now lingers upon the team, and to everyone a congratu- lations and good luck is greatly deserved. . \'\i~Li~ ~\d~ 201.

·SPORTS November 10, 1994, page 15 A Week of Upsets in the East Gives Union an NCAA Longshot; . . Dutchmen Finish Regular Season 7-2 After Beating Rochester by l.(en Berman Sports Editor This past Saturday the Union football team traveled to Roch- ester, New York, to fmish their season against theY ellowjackets of the University of Rochester. They left the home fans feeling a bit stung (no pun intended), as they ran all over the Rochester defense, winning 44-14. This win left Union with a fi- nal record of7-2, something that they may look back on in disbe- lief. Because of losses to Coast Guard and Dickinson, their sea- son may be over. Academy) or Union. The Dutchmen finished the season with two impressive road wins by a combined score of 94- 14. Union thoroughly dominated Rochester and they hope the poll- are the same two factors that truly great teams, at all levels of play, must possess. Union rolled up an incredible 514 yards on of- fense, including 327 on the ground. Chris Irving ended his game, when they knew that chances for a playoff spot were so dim. The perfect example of this hannony on both sides of the ball centered around Union's first scoring drive. Rochester was the drive with a 22 yard effort. Two weeks ago the Dutchmen were ranked ninth in the East,the likelihood of obtaining an NCAA bid extremely improbable, As a result of several recent upsets, Union could be back in the thick ofthe NCAA playoff hunt. Last week Rowan, Cortland State, and Kean all lost. Kean dropped from 2nd to 4th in the East, but it is likely that their 30-6 loss will not be forgotten by NCAA pollsters when they make their final selec- tions next week. Though Ply- mouth State and Ithaca are sure Has Cltris Irving played his last game as a Dutchman? Only time will telL (File Pltoto) The defense was forced to rise to the task on Rochester's very next drive. They drove once again down the field, all the way to the Union 10. On third and one, nosegurud Brad Duffy met running back Tim Powell at the line, and Rochester was left with a choice. They opted to go on fourth down, and Pessolano once again carne up huge. He stopped Powell on a sweep, enabling Union to take over once again. This time they went 90 yards on only 4 plays, the key being Kojo Attah 's 65 yard gaHop to the Rochester 2. Irving punched the ball in for the first of his three touchdowns. Neither team was able to do much on their next few possessions, until Irving stepped forward. With four minutes to go in the half, he went up the middle for 63 yards, all the way to pay-dirt. This made it 20-0, and one more standby the Dutch- men defense, and one more drivl.! by the offense left the scort: at 2 7- 0, and the home crowd silent. sters notice. · to receive bids, the next two spots could go to Buffalo State, Kean, Kings Point (Merchant Marine The keys to this victory were the same two things that had been all season: a strong running gam~ and a dominant defense.

More importantly, he tied the Vlad Telemaque's all time Union touchdown record of 30, scoring three on the day. This execution allowed them to hold on to the ball, and control the game. The defense did it's part as welt as it had all year, shut- ting out the Yellowjackets until the fourth quarter, when the score was already 27-0. It's a tribute to the entire team for playing so well in their final driving, and had gone as far as the Union one yard line. The Dutchmen called a time-out, hop- ing to regroup. On the very next play, they forced a fumble, and Kevin Pessolano recovered for Union. This huge emotional turnaround was the lift that Union needed. They proceeded to drive 96 yards on 7 plays, in- cluding two for 69. A screen pass from Keith Lombardo to Irving was good for 4 7, and sophomore fullback Justin Bourque finished The third quarter was score- less, and the most interesting sight of the fourth (and a telltale sign of the times) was watching Rochester running back Chip Cooper, apparently unaware of the score, highstep into the endzone. Whatever. Bourque scored his second touchdown of the day, and Keith Crumb added another, as Union finished off their day, and the season, in style. Best of luck to the team for next year, and congratulations on a great season. Swimming Dominates in First Meet of the Season by Julie Ivanyi Concordiensis Staff The men's and women's swim teams began their seasons this weekend at the Union Relays, entertaining both parents and fans; PerfOimances were-excep- tional, enough to surpass rivals Hartwick and Coast Guard. Fif- teen men and women teams at- tended, including Albany, Coast Guard, Hartwick, New Paltz, Rensselaer, Skidmore, and Vassar. The rookies proved them- selves in their first showing at Union. As the meet went on, Union showed their competition what to expect for the rest of the season. For the first time, the Men's team won the Union Relays. Throughout the day, the score was close between Union and Coast Guard. It came down to the iast relay, the 400 Freestyle Relay, where Scott Bowden, Chris Riley; Mike Darbyshire, and Mike H~phreys came four seconds away from beating their own record. Out of the 11 relays, including 2 diving relays, the men placed in the top 3 in all of them, with 4 first places. Senior Matt .Baumgartner and freshman Brian Field brought the Men's team 2 second place finishes in the. 1 and 3 meter diving. The 800 Freestyle Relay, Mike Darbyshire, Than Stuntz, Chris Riley, and Kevin Mackarowski plowed through to outbeat Hartwick by 2 tenths of a second. Hartwick has previously beaten the Meri in both dual meets and State Championships. In the 600 Individual Medley Relay, Kevin Mackarowski, Eric Majeron,. and Scott Bowden surpassed Coast Guard by more than a body length. ) The Women eclipsed the com- petition by winning all of the re- lays, except for one. This in- cluded 2 diving relays where jun- ior Amy Lamphere, sophomore Nicole Rubin, and freshman Aixa Ola.zagasti towered over second place finishers, Hartwick. The 300 Backstroke Relay of senior Anne Rozwadowski, junior Jenn Allaire, and freshman Sarah Spaulding beat the competition by more than a body length. The 300 Fly Relay consisting of Mo O'Donnell, Alyson McKee, and Jackie Crane led the rest of the teams by a quarter length of the pool. The 300 Breastroke Relay, comprised of two rookies, Megan McCarthy, Melissa Pomerleau, and sophomore Alyson McKee buried the other teams. The freshman anxiously began their careers at Union with very strong sWims. Overall the teams swam very competitively, and revealed to the future competition that Union is definitely a team to strive to beat. This weekend the swim team travels to Rochester where they .will have their first dual meet. They are convinced that they will swim as exceptionally as they did this past weekend, as they con- tinue to strive to be champions. -

November 1 0, 1994 PAGE16 .. --~ Lederer!The Col}cordiensis Troy Stevens celebrate:; with teammates after a Union goal during the Skating Dutchmen's 4-3 victory over Army this weekend by Dagan La Corte llockey ~orrespondent On Friday October 28, the Skating Dutchmen of Union opened their season against the Friars of Providence College. The endeavor did not bode well for the Dutchmen, as the Friars came out victorious by the score of7 -5. However the losing trend would not persist for long, as the Dutchmen earned two wins this past weekend, against the Black Knights of Anny and the Min- utemen of the University ofMas- sachusetts. Before a sold out crowd of 2~504, the Skating Dutchmen played host to the Black Knights of Anny on Friday night. Union opened the scoring first, midway through the first period. Captain Cory Holbrough tallied his sec- ond goal of the season, on assists by Seabrook Satterlund and Ryan Donovan.

Anny got on the board before Andrew Will scored his first goal of the season on a nice individual effort. While on the power play, Will received the puck from Stevens on the blueline, skated through the Army defense and shot the _ puck into the lower righthand corner of the net, making the score 3-1. So the Dutchmen ended the first period leading Anny by the score of 3-1. The next two peri- ods did not go as well for the Dutchmen, as their play lapsed significantly. In the next two pe- riods the Dutchmen were outplayed, outshot, and outscored 2-1. Goalie Luigi Villa and a third period Chris Ford goal, kept the Dutchmen's victory alive, as they squeezed in a win by the score of3-2. The next night went far better for the Dutchmen, as they played their best hockey of the season, dominating the Min- uteJ11en ofUMASS, 6-3. For only the second time in the past three years, a goaltender started a game who's name was not Mike Gallant or Luigi Villa. Coach Bruce Delventhal gave freshman Trevor Koenig his first chance to show that he was a ca- pable net•minder. Koenig an- swered the call, playing strong against the Minutemen, making 19 .. saves on 22-shots. However the night belonged to senior Chris Albert, who showed his offensive strength scoring his first career hat trick. The Dutch- men scored first, but were down 2-1 at the end of the first period. This time the second period went extremely well for the Dutchmen, as they outscored UMASS, by a 3-0 margin. Chris Ford scored his third goal of the weekend five minutes into the period, on assists from Ryan Donovan and captain Cory Holbrough. Twenty five seconds later, Craig Reckin re- ceived a pass from Jamie Antoine and blasted it by a bewildered Minuteman goaltender, for his first career goaL Things conpnued to go well for the Dutchmen in the third period, as Jay Prentice scored an unas- sisted goal to extend the Dutchmen's lead to 5-2. Less than one minute 4ater, Albert completed his hat trick in fitting style, as he received a beautiful pass from Dean Goulet, broke in on the UMASS goalie, and put it past him. This weekend the Dutchmen play host to their rivals from the north St. Lawrence, and the highly touted Golden Knights of Clarkson. TEAM PT1 1. Mtnneaota (10) 100 2. Michigan State 80 3.

Athlete of the Week: Chris Albert Gets Hat Trick by Jason Starr Sports Editor As assistant captain, much is expected of Chris Albert this year. Union hockey has benefited from his outstanding play for three years and the Dutchmen hope the '94-'95 campaign is as produc- tive for Chris as his previous three seasons have been. This senior forward from Nepean, Ontario took a big step in that direction this weekend as he poured in three goals against UMass-Amherst on Saturday to complete his first career hat trick. On the strength of these three goals Union beat the Minutemen and completed the weekend sweep, upping their record to 2- l. In addition to his prowess on the ice, Chris has maintained a high GPA and last year received the Dukehart Award for academic excellence. As any athlete will tell you, this is no small feat; jug- gling schoolwork and daily prac- tices can be very taxing. Albert, number 7 for the Dutch- men, was recruited out of the Ontario Central Junior A Hockey League where he played for the Gloucester Rangers. His scoring totals have steadily increased since his freshman year topping out at 29 points last season. He has remained a solid and reliable all around player for Union never once missing a game. With per- fonnances like the show he put on Saturday, Albert should sur- pass his previous scoring marks and prove a valuable asset to a Union hockey team on the rise.

On Tiu.ir~day, November 10, Suzi Landolphi educated the . Union College community with • her comedy routine, \Hot Sexy and Safer\ in continuation of AIDS Awaren.ess Week. Landophi reaches her audience . by using humor to discuss issues like masturbation, alcohol and sex, the emotional aspect of viewing one's \private parts,\ the explanation of the female orgasm, communication in sex and how to correctly use a condom. She also involved stu- . dents from the audience to help in demonstrations. The show began with an in- troduction by Lisa Hall, chair- person for the AIDS Awareness Week Student Committee. .

The Protestant Campus Ministry Board sponsored the in- stallation. TI10se attending the service included members of her fonner congregation, local clergy, and various Union College stu- dents, faculty and administration. Nate Coffin, President of the Student Forum and friend of Rev- erend Buckley, welcomed the at- tendees. Other student partici- pants included Heather Daly, Class of 1997, Ancell a Evans, Class of 1996, Beth Wheat, Class of 1998 and Amy Beth Kessinger, Peer Facilitator and Class of 1996, who gave the Charge to the Campus. Barry Smith, Associ- ate Professor of Theater and member of the Protestant Minis- try Board, gave the Sennon. All proceeds from the offering will benefit the Schenectady Damien Center, a living room for those with HIV/AIDS. \We are fortunate to have Kathleen as part of the Union community. She brings with her many gifts and will no doubt make this a better place,\ said Coffin. Some Scheiiectadians Take Offense to Union's Antics by David Levine I.!Jditor-in-chief Not only do many Schen~ ectadians stand firmly against Union's proposal to renovate G.E. Plot properties for adminis- trative offices, but the school's reaction to the recent political and legal stalemate has exacer- bated the already weak relations between locals and the Union administration, according to rep- resentatives of the plot. One active plot resident echoes the sentiments of some other Schenectadians. \President Hull is pitting neighborhoods against one an- other. He has contempt to the Nott/Seward neighborhood. This is an area that he obviously doesn't want to be in. Yet, Hull makes it seem as though plot resi- dents are mean, elitist people who want to dump their problems on residents of other neighborhoods. As a resident, I find it offensive that [he] is pitting neighborhoods against each other.\ This resident believes that the current administration is not sending the right messages to the community. \There is a unique climate that comes out of the ad- ministration. The climate ema- nates from the President. One bad guy can do a lot of damage. A bad guy did a lot of damage 20 years ago.\ \This is an administration that likes to gather money and build things. This is not dissimilar to previous Union administrations. This is how abuses start to mount, such as the hockey scandal ofthe 1970s. Mter the abuses, the school reverts to an academically and culturally enlightened ad- ministration.\ According to plot residents, although the school outwardly states that it is seeking a compro- mise, the administration's actions are not consistent with their rhetoric. \There is a discrepancy be- tween the public statements the administration has made., and what they've done in terms of actual behavior. There are lots of options. He [President Hull] is fixated on what he wants to do.\ The plot residents also contend that the school is trying to force an unfair resolution. \The Presi- dent is threatening the city coun- cil by including tax revenues in the discussion.\ A resident firmly disagrees with the President's contention that the school will add a stabi- lizing element to the neighbor- hood. \Class envy and fear-mon- gering amongst neighborhoods doesn't constitute stability.\ Plot residents are further con- cerned that the school is over- publicizing its public service con- nection with Schenectady. \In the past 24 years there has never been an administration that has so stridently pointed to what they do for Schenectady.\ The· coriununity does believe that the Union community should be made aware of the potential repercussions of the school's 'strong-ann' tactics. \Students need to be made aware that there is a distinction b~tween the college and the ad- ministration. A lot ofirreparable damage can be done. There are major political issues that are at stake. When all is said and done we will have to work together.\ Some residents do not believe that Union is willing to fully un- derstand the community's per- spective. According to Barbara Blanchard, Preside:ht of the Union Triangle Neighborhood Association, \Roger Hull is way off base in calling plot residents NIMBYs.\ The community of- fered the alternative of housing administrators in the plot houses, which would enable the President's house to be freed for other uses. Schenectadians are equally dis- traught with Hull's unwillingness to move offices to non-residen- tial areas in th·e city, according to Blanchard. \All of our neighbors in the city are distressed that Hull isn't lis- tening to the community. He started Schenectady 2000, yet what he's doing now is in direct opposition to the restoration plan. We are quite disappointed that he isn't following the principles he himself set for the city of Schenectady. The residents of the G.E. Plot do not believe that the DEIS is a complete and meaningful assesment of the environmental impact of Union's proposal. \The DEIS was written by Union College . Union is paying for it. Although it is required, we believe that it is an inadequate document.\ \Even if the impact is suppos- edly nothing, they [the residents of Schenectady] wouldn't want it. Besides, it is cheaper for Union to move to alternative sites. The ADA requirements are extensive and turning the houses into of- fice space would be prohibitively expensive. It is better for Schenectady because it would be foolish to take the houses off of the tax rolls.\ Reinhold Sidor, President of the G.E. Realty Plot, believes that the controversy has been blown out of proportion by the local Continued on page 4 ... , •. ·.~.b .. ':,

The geol- ogy conference, featured on last week's front page, not only al- lowed geologists to present their research, it also honored college seniors throughout the country. Thirty-one colleges across the country accoladed graduating se- niors for their outstanding achievement. The students that were chosen for this award were provided with free accommoda- tions paid by the convention. Bemis was commended for her notable work in geology at the conference. She presented a poster titled, \Control of Peat Land forms and Hydrology by Bedrock Topography and Subservice Stratigraphy.\ This geophysical research included using seismic shock waves to map bedrock that underlies in April Bemis was tile o11ly student to attend Annual Geological Society of America Conference. (plloto by Josl1ua Haines!TC) North em Minnesota. Bemis con- cluded from this research that there are two types of vegetation that underlie in Minnesota: one is acidic which is incorporated by bogs, and the other is nonacidic which consists mainly of Spring Fen. The shape of the bedrock determines the flow of water. If there is an up flow of water, than the main type of vegetation that grows in that area is Spring Fen. If there is a down flow of water, there is an abundant growth of Bog. This conclusion was first generated by a computer model which Bemis set out to prove. The research Bemis presented is also being incorporated into her senior thesis. She has been working with her advisor, Geol- ogy Department Chairman George Shaw, and hopes to con- tinue her research towards her masters.

The plot fears a decline in property values if it decreases in size. \An insti- tution is what we don't need.\ The community does not lend much credence to the accusations that they oppose Union's proposal because ofNIMBY. Sidor argues that other neighborhoods have reacted positively to the possi- bility of housing Union's admin- istrative offices. \Both the Goose Hill and West Side neighbor- hoods would be very happy to have the college come.\ According to Sidor, the DEIS is not complete because it does not reflect the true impact of building on alternative sites. Residents of the G.E. Plot believe that St. Anthony's church has been pressured into arguing '\against any construction .in the Nett/Seward lot. Additionally, Plot residents believe the school could purchase social services buildings in that area for what amounts to nomie naJ prices. Sidor is not convinced that the city will benefit as much finan- cially from allowing Union to use their plot houses for offices. Al- though Hull has announced that the school will pay the lost city and school tax, he has not speci- fied how Schenectady will be about AIDS, she invited to the stage Chris Hancock and Kojo Attah, both from the Class of 1996, to explain how irresponsi- bility is a factor in the spread of AIDS. She next addressed, very di- rectly, the femat.e audience. Landophi stressed the importance for women to view their bodies. Women are taught by society to hate their \private parts\ because they are \ugly dirty, etc.\ Her goal is to help women have pride in their bodies and also to under- stand how they work, including the female orgasm. Landolphi's three keys to a great sexual experience are com- munication, honesty and trust. Again, she used audience partici- pation to communicate this point. Josh Katz, Class of 1998, and Jean Victor, Class of 1997, helped demonstrate communication and trust in a sexual relationship. Finally, with the help of audi- ence participation, she taught the campus how to put on a condom correctly. Michelle Woodward, Class of 1997, put a condom over the head of Tim Rainen, Class of 1998,. who then inflated it with. his nose. Landolphi, who has a college age daughter herself, has been do- ing this comedy act for six years with the hope of promoting safer sex and sexual confidence.

However, there were some who saw it coming. On November 7, former presi- dent Ronald Reagan disclosed to the public that he is in the early stages of Alzheimer's, an incurable, degenerative disease publicly, before he was elected President, that he wanted to be watched for signs of senility because ofhis mother, who be- came senile a few years before her death at the age of 80. Observers have reported that the former president had been known to doze off at White House meetings and be depen- dent on cue cards for all his \Speculation ofMr. Reagan's mental status has existed throughout his years as president.

His revelation .has brought a flood ofcontroversy and debate Over exactly how long he has been suffering from this dis- ease. The jokes made of his faulty recall during the Iran- Contra hearings now ring with an ironic twist. The question has risen of whether or not he was suffering from Alzheimer's during his much publicized 1990 memory lapses. In one extreme instance during ques- tioning; Reagan was unable to even remember the name of his Chairman ofthe JointChiefs of Staff. · Speculation .of ·Mr, ~ Reagan.'.s. ·'ttfen6tf• St'a'tu'S··· h•a·s· e';Cistett throughout his years as presi- dent. :Mr. Reagan himself stated press conferences.

It was also around this time period that the theory of senil- ity changed. Scientists no longer described it as a res4It .of a series of small strokes but rather a hereditary brain dis- eas.e. Considering the case of Mr. Reagan's mother coupled with the memory lapses he is re- ported to have suffered offers strong. evidence that the early stages of Alzheimer's m.ay have started while he- was in ,office. . Mr. Re<Jgan 's. doc;:tors,~ bqw-; . ever, are adamant in denying that Alzheimer's was respon- sible for any of these behaviors. They have cited other medical problems, such as the subdural hematoma Reagan suffered af- ter being thrown from a horse, as a possible cause of his memory difficulties. Dr. Ruge, a White House physician, has also suggested that Mr. Reagan's dangerously low blood pressure after the assas- sination attempt may have also affected his mental status dur- ing that time period. All doctors agree that Alzheimer's disease is difficult to diagnose in any patient. De- tection methods includeverbal tests and physical examinations. Often patients are evasive dur- ing testing and answer questions vaguely, making it difficult for a physician to confirm his or her diagnosis. It is also important for physicians to rule out other forms of mental illness, such as depression, before diagnosing a patient with Alzheimer's. Mr. Reagan's forthrightness has been lauded by the public. Doctors have said that Mr. Reagan's disclosure was a very brave act. It is often common of Alzheimer's patients to deny the existence of a problem.

Lifting the Arms Embargo: A Wise Decision? by Matt Sandler Conco_rdiensis Staff The Bosnian Muslims and their Croat allies have launched a coordinated offensive, captur- ing the town ofKupres. They advanced past Serb positions and captured abandoned weap- ons and munitions. This is no way an indicator of the tides World News Opinion being turned, however, it does represent a significant change in the nature -of the war, with the previous one-sided Serb on- slaught. The U.N. Embargo on Serbia has forced its President Milosevic to close its borders between Serb controlled terri- tory in Bosnia and Serbia, in an effort to ease the stress of the embargo. He is blamed for fu- eling ethnic tensions that started a war that had been repressed by Tito's Communist govern- ment. The main force used to take the town was the Muslim dominated Bosnian Army, which took key tactical ground to reclaim the city. The town of Kurpes, before the war was mostly populated with Croats, however, this town has key strategic implications. Once the Muslim-Croat Allies have complete control of the town and surrounding hilltops, they will control a key highway between central Bosnia and the main Croatian seaport at Split. Previous travels into central Bosnia forced journeyers over mountainous terrain and un- paved roads. Bosnian Serb President Karadzic warned of a counterstrike, and said, \We must break the back of the Mus- lim army,\ and called the Bosnian Army and Croatian Defense council a \temporary coalition of local interests.\ Croat Serbs living in Croatia, have said that they will send units to augment the Bosnian Serb army and help them counter the Bosnian army of- fensive. The Bosnian Serbs still control 70 percent of Bosnia and Herzegovina. So, although the Bosnian-Croatian alliance has made gains in the war, and h~ve achieved a significant vic- tory; it is too soon to tell how substantial that victory has been. The history of these ethnic groups is very bloody. The ha- tred that has boiled below the surface for many years has fur- thered their warring. Outside intervention has been powerless to do anything substantial in the way of effecting peace. The U.N., the European Commu- nity, and North Atlantic Treaty Organization have failed to grasp that a Western solution to the chaos in Yugoslavia will never come about. The war- ring ethnic groups will continue to fight, no matter what solution is posed or the way it is pre- sented. The only way to end the fight- ing is to restore the centralized control under Communism, however, that is only a tempo- rary solution to a problem creq ated by history. One example of the hatred is during ww n, the Serbs were massacred by Croatian Ustashe units, units that corroborated with the Na- zis and were so brutal that they horrified their Nazi overseers. Imagine horrifying the Nazis! There was a General Assem- bly Resolution that was in fa- vor of lifting the anns embargo against the Bosnian Muslims by a vote of 97 to 0 with 61 ab- stentions. This does not carry tl1e weight of a Security Coun- cil Resolution, but might spur the Security Councilin to action. The Security Council Resolu- tio-n proposed by the United States of lifting the embargo would not go into etTect for six months. However, there is the matter of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan that must be con- sidered. The United States, mainly through the Central In- telligence Agency aided the Mujaheeden war against Soviet troops. The Afghan people fought hard against Soviet troops and overwhelming odds, and forced the Soviet Union to have its \own Vietnam.;' The significance of this is that today Afghanistan is a major center for terrorism training and is large producer of opium. Clearly, not in the United States • best interests! This is further example of the U.S. throughout the Cold War, \jumping the gun;\ aiding people, groups, and countries in an effort to counter the Soviet Union, and not weighing the long term consequences of that aid. Bosnia could be different, however, based on history, the United States should proceed cautiously before we allow weapons into the fonner Yugo- slavia. What worries me, is not the present, but the future of Bosnia. Will it be another indi- cator of history of actions with- out thought. Bosnian Serb President pre- dicted that the Bosnian and Croat aJJiance will split, and they will be fighting again, as they were fighting before they formed the alliance. This is reminiscent of situation in Orwell's 198-1, in which we have a three faction war where the sides are constantly being flipped. If that prediction is true, it means that by allowing the anns embargo to be lifted, and the alliance breaks up, you will have a bigger conflict than you would have if the embargo was in effect. This attempt by the West to effect the situation has the real possibility of back- firing and might make matters worse. · Very often government lead- ers rush to action, without ana- lyzing the consequences.

Tiwugh the construction has been an eye sore on campus,-students and faculty patiently await its near completion. Over the years, the Nott Memorial has become Union's chief landmark. It is the manifest soul of Union College. While the memorial is regarded and praised for its connotation and architectural beauty and greatness, there is much more behind this bold structure. While studying the slowly de- teriorating structure of the Nott Memorial in the mid-1970's, ar- chitect J .I. Mesick stated: \A building can be remarkable in its own day by reason of creative innovations or by the way it sums up the aspirations of the time. It can become remarkable in sub- sequent centuries by the mere fact of its survival or by the human associations attached to it over tim.e. Nott Memorial is remark- able in all these aspects.\ l11e hemt and soul behind the memorial, Eliphalet Nott, the man for which the memorial was named, is that human association. Nott, a visionary, had a dream ror Lh{i0,1\t~ne~e~··a 'drearrrwnid1: l;a~')ilii~~~/~ite \'8MI~g~ ·f~?~~m:· progress and advancement over the years. Eliphalet Nott was the president of Union College for 62 years, from 1804 to 1866,. the longest term any coJ.lege president has ever served. Because he served the college for such an extended period af time, Nott left a deep, timeless impression on the insti- tution. He set high goals for the institutian and gave his generation a new concept of higher educa- tion. President Nott launched a program of modern liberal educa- tion well in advance of other in- stitutions of higher education in America. His program sensibly reflected the needs of the devel- oping nation. Not restricting stu- dents to the study of classical sub- jects, Nott instead offered and encouraged students to take courses in the sciences, the mod- em languages, and contemporary government. He wanted to offer students the freedom to explore on their own. Nott initiated this radical pro- gram during his early days in Schenectady and led Union to become one of the nation's larg- est colleges. Under his leader- ship, Union College became a prestigious national institution for higher education competing with only the best: Harvard, Yale, and Princeton. Nott ~a,s not only an influen- ti~L soll~~~~,r~:sid:l}t, p~t~~l~~h. more. By 1845, Nott, aChnsttan minister was recognized as a tern- perance leader and a vigorous advocate of abolition. In addition, he was the inventor of the first an- thracite-burning stove and devel- oped the first steamboat to use coal for fuel. Playing various major roles in American life, Nott was a remarkable man with vast and numerous accomplishments. His goal was to expand and im- prove the America ofhis day. In its early years, Union was crowded into \Stone College\ lo• cated in the center of Schenectady. Here, the president, faculty, students, classrooms and commons were all crowded un- der one roof. Because of this, President Nott conceived a, new campus for Union. In late 1812, ground was bro- ken for a new building on a piece of land Nott had acquired about one mile east of the old college. Soon after, in 1813 Nott found himself an architect, Joseph Ramee from Hamburg. The two ambitious men had great plans for the campus. In fact, Union would be the first planned college cam- pus in the nation. Nott envisioned a central building surrounded by an arrangement of other academic buildings and natural terrain. Lack of funding thwarted cam- pus construction. However, Nett's constant efforts finally paid off when in 1858, he was able to lay the cornerstone to Graduates Hall, the anticipated central b~ild­ ing to the campus.

TI1ere have been many afternoon when I've been hanging out with my friends, bored to tears.

Please don't take the prospect of voice-mail lightly. It is one thing Union offers us free of charge, and if you are not tak- ing advantage of this opportu- nity you are hurting no one but yourself. Go ahead, pick up the phone. See how exciting the world of vaice-mail can be. If you don't know who to harass, give me a call. Ye;,h, so I'm des .. perate, but it's never been so fun. P.S.

Eliphalet Nott did not live to see Graduates Hall rise any higher than its foundations. The project eventually resumed but made slow progress. Finally, in 1882, the building assumed its final form. The structure, a 16- sided polygon with gothic exte- rior was engineered in stone and iron. With tri-colored slate roof .. ing, large oak doors, an Hebrew inscription, and several other spectacular features, the stmcture was a ~rue masterpiece r~flecting. the innovation, tafi::nt, ·and ambi- tion behind it. Its first two floors were originally used as the li- brary, while the lower level was used for banquets and other func- tions and the third landing was a museum. Soon after its comple- tion, the building was rededicated as the Nott Memorial Library, known today as the Nott Memo- rial. Eliphalet Nott led Union Col- lege to greatness and paved its way for a bright fi.1ture. Like the Nott Memorial, Eliphalet epito- mizes. the. spirit and traqition of Union College.

SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY November 17, 1994, page 9 New Diagnostic for Shellfish P.athogen by Andy Salama \ Science Editor Since the late 1970's oyster growers, and dealers have lost mass amounts of business due to news :of people dying, and get- ting very ill after eating raw oys- ters. On the national level, sales have decreased by 50% .since 1989. Large buyers such as Red · Lobster, and Marriot have stopped buying oyster of any kind, raw or cooked aU together. In the early 1980's scientists iso- lated the culprit of this deadly shellfish sickness, a saltwater- loving bacteria called Vibrio vulnificus. Of the more than thirty species of Vibrio identi- fied, only eleven are toxic to humans, ten of which are linked directly to raw oysters. V. vulnijicus is responsible for nearly all of the oyster related deaths in the past two decades .. V. vulnificus is an opportunis- tic pathogen, and most people are able to defend themselves against the organism. However imrtm- nosuppressed individuals, such as those suffering from HIV, and AIDS are at great risk. Last spring the FDA decided to hold tamination of oysters by V. its first workshop on ways to de- vulnijicus. The FDA discov- velop strategies to decrease con- ered that the organism is highly Like crimson fireflies, cells of vibrio vulnificus bacteria glow red after being treated with FSU 's gene probe doped with rhodamine, a jlourescent chemical. Also visible in this sample are other cells-round clumlps of Staphylococcus epidennidis and long rods of Bacillus sub til lis- which the probe bypasses on its wtzy to identifying only the vulnificus microbe. resistant to natural biologi,.. cal stresses, such as season$ and currents. Unfortunately . . the concentrationefbacteria needed to induce toxicity was not established at this meet- ing. In 1992, a group from Florida State University re- sponded to the urgency of this crisis by developing a fast diagnostic for V. vulnijicus. The typical analysis required ten days for a single sample. They de- veloped a vulnificus-sensi- tive genetic probe. The group finally managed to iso- late a DNA fragment only twenty base pairs long that appeared to be unique to V. vulnificus. The single strand complement of this fragment will bind to any complemen- tary strand in the sample (DNA or RNA). Researchers then had to tag the DNA with. fluorescence or radioactivity. In this way the DNA could be tracked to see if it bound to any DNA in suspected samples. DNA probes, coupled with fluorescent tags, are easy to visualize in samples by the use of special microscopes. The ac- curacy of the test is very high. Single stranded DNA naturally binds to its complementary strand. The group decided to concentrate their efforts on RNA because the probe would hybrid- ize to it much more efficiently than DNA, as it is singled stranded by nature. The chance of finding another similar se- quence is one in 420. The pro- cess of screening samples for base pair homology .is called hy- bridizing. The test can be per- formed in as little as two hours, and will hopefully reduce the amount of fatalities caused by this insidious pathogen. This is not a new technique, but its application to the field of parasitology may open new doors for future meth- ods of diagnosis, and testing. An Environmentally. Safe Plastic Making Process Nicotine is Worse Than You Think by Kenny Lee Science Editor Tobacco products are often, and rightly, criticized for their carcinogenic effects. In the past few months the public has be- come increasingly concerned with the levels of nicotine in ciga- rettes. Most of the arguments have focused on the addictive na- ture of nicotine, but have ignored several other physiological ef- fects of the drug. The extent of these effects de- pends on the particular physiol- ogy of the subject. A non-smoker or non-tobacco chewer would be dramatically effected by even small doses of nicotine, which could induce nausea and vomit- ·· ii}g. However smokers build a .· tolerance to nicotine and are af- fected to a lesser extent. by Kenny Lee Science Editor Most of can not imagine liv- ing in a world without plastics. Plastics are so prevalent in our society that people take them for granted. Companies that use plastics preach how good they are and how any other medium would not be feasible to use. However, from an environmen- tal standpoint plastics have a bad reputation. Their are two ma- jor reasons tOr this. One, they do not degrade in landfills and two the production of plastics requires the use of various or- ganic solvents which are harm- ful for the environment. in or- der to reduce the criticisms of plastic scientists have to come up either with ways to degrade the plastic or they must find a less hazardous way to produce the plastic. A group of scientists at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, led by John DeSimone, have come up with a cleaner way to produce the plastics. The original and the new process are similar except that the new process uses a gas, carbon dioxide, instead of liq- uids like water and toluene to produce the plastics. The pro- cess in~olves many steps. First the plastic monomer is placed in the organic solvent where an initiator is also placed. The ini- tiator causes the monomers to link end ~to end, to form a polymer'. The chains then form into .small spheres which are able to be shaped. This is where the prob- 'em begins. The left over liquid is classified as hazardous waste even if it is lightly contaminated water. DeSimone's solution has been to change the solvent to a supercritical carbon dioxide. A supercritical gas is one that is at such a high pressure that the den- sity begins to resemble a liquid, but its viscosity stays as that of a gas. The process of transform- ing the carbon dioxide is an easy one that can be done at room tem- perature and this gas is much easier to separate from the plas- tic polymer than the contaminated water. The problem with the new process is that many monomers do not dissolve in the carbon di- oxide. The monomers that do come out of solution as soon as the chain reaches a small length so that is no good either. This group now had to come up with a solution to yet another problem, how do you get these monomers to stay in solution long · enough to become polymers? The solution has been surfactants, the basis for most detergents. These molecules have two dis- tinct parts, one that likes the car- bon dioxide solvent and the other that likes the monomer. This bridging has allowed these short chains to stay suspended and grow to more than 3000 units ,in length. .j Now we need to know if this plastic is as good as the plastic that we presently have. A chemical engineer at the Uni- versity of Texas, Keith Johnston, feels that this new plastic may have advantages over present day plastics, be- cause the ability of the carbon dioxide to get between the monomers of plastic allow it to be more pliable. The carbon dioxide/monomer interaction creates a sponge-like consis- tency in the plastic and this plas- tic may have implications in drug delivery. Is this process economically feasible and can it work for all monomers? The jury is still out on whether or not this process can be applied to all monomers used to make polymers, but test- in~ is being done on many other polymer making processes to· see if this new process is appli- cable. Economically, the price of manufacturing must be less than the present price of cleanup for this process to work. Since one is working at high pressures of carbon dioxide the process gets a little expensive compared to the liquid process, but if cleanup is no longer needed then all that money is saved.

As with all drugs, toxicity is related to dosage size. In fact, concen- trated nicotine derivatives are often used as insecticides. In the human body, nicotine mimics a common neurotransmitter, ace- tylcholine. Acetylcholine and nicotine bind to protein receptors in the tissues of the autonomic nervous system. This bindi.ng induces a series of reactions which affects heart rate and blood pressure. These chemi- cals also bind to receptors in the adrenal medulla which causes the release of other chemicals that affect the central nervous system. The effects can be stimulatory or inhibitory. Low doses of nicotine can cause an increase in blood pres- sure. constriction of blood ves- sels, and accelerated heart rate. Smokers and tobacco chewers trying to quit can look forward to a myriad of unpleasant with- draw symptoms which include nervousness, irritability, anxiety, drowsiness, and increased appe- tite. The actual withdraw I symp- toms last about 48 hours, but the mental addiction can persist for sometime. Toxic levels effects of nicotine, usually not received by smoking or chewing tobacco, are some what more dramatic than non- toxic levels. Higher doses may induce nausea, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, sweating, and abnormal respiration rates. In \ very few cases have people died due to nicotine overdoses, but it is possible. The mutagenic ef- fects of smoking and tobacco chewing do not emerge for some time in users, but the more im- mediate effects of nicotine should act as a red light telling you that tobacco is not welcomed by your body.

November 17, 1994, page 10 Let Students Help Resolve the Plot Controversy Though some of the involved parties deny that tensions are soaring between Union and Schenectady residents as a result the G .E. Plot controversy, it is plainly obvious to any bystand€r that the debate could tum into a seemingly endless legal and political grudge match, at great cost to the community and the school financially, ·and by way of deteriorating the school's positive association with the city. It is clearly in the best inter- est of both parties to settle this issue expediently to avoid any long-term hostility. Though there have been local meetings and a well-publicized Schenectady City Council meeting, the feuding parties appear no closer to a resolution. With the in- terests of current and future students in mind, the editorial board of The Concordiensis respectfully submits to host a sort of Town Meeting at Union College, during which students can be made fully cognizant ofthe how a resolution of the conflict (or lack of a peaceful solution) may impact them While ad- ministrators come and go, the student body will be forced to deal with the repercussions of a protracted legal and political battle for many years. The students are genuinely interested in forming their own opinions on whether or not each side is taking strides towards compromise. In addition, holding a meeting such as the one proposed, would enable students to meet some of the impor- tant local community leaders who are involved in this debate. It will give students a much greater sense of the school's in- volvement with the community, and will hopefully expose them to avenues of involvement in on-going community discussions. Until students are given the opportunity to see what the vi- able solutions to the problem are, they can neither exert their influence, nor pretend to even care about stopping future ero- sion of relations between the college and the community. We hereby propose to hold a extended 'group discussion' on the Union campus during the early part of January. We want to encourage all concerned Schenectady residents (from G.E. Plot residents to members of the Union administration) to attend the discussion and to listen to how the students react to the proposals ofboth parties. It is conceivable that student involvement is the recipe to solving this heavyweight bullying match. e:~ •.•..... · Attsltdit¢r:S. · · · . Spons·l!dttor$. Copy E;ditor .

If the present level of service and quality is contin- ued, I'm not likely to be the last either. I realize that improvements have been made in response to past student suggestions. and I hope that the dining service will continue to take our input seri- ously. I am not writing this col- umn to complain about the work- ers in the dining hall, because in my experience they are hard working and friendly. My prob- lem is with the way things are run. Every Monday Wednesday and Friday I eat breakfast at West. The food on the \Hot line\ would more appropriately be called the \Luke warm line.\ The food served from the hot line is often not very hot at all. For some rea- son the problem of cold food hap- pens to be particularly severe at breakfast. The dining service must find a way. to improve this prob- lem. Even good food served cold is often not enjoyable. This brings me to my next com- plaint. I know it's hard to serve a large group of people really high quality food, but I think that we deserve a higher general quality of food than what we are being served. I think if Marriot tried to serve the food they serve to us to customers in a restaurant or ho- tel, theywoufd quickly find them- selves out ofbusiness. The obvi- ous objection that Marriot would make here is that we don't pay as much for our food as customers in a restaurant. This financial problem could be solved if the $250,009 dollars being saved by Marriot were applied to buying a higher quality food. Here the problem may lie not with Marriot, but with the school's administra- tion. Another source of annoyance is the lack of quality control con- cerning the cleaning of plates, trays and silverware. I often find I have picked up a dirty plate or tray while I'm on line. This shouldn't happen. Someone should be responsible for making sure all plates and trays are clean before they are put out for student use. The issue of cleanliness re- cently became a major concern of mine. Last week at lunch, I dis- covered that in addition to eating my pasta I was also consuming a long dark hair. My hair is short and brown. At this point I was not particularly happy, and if the sug- gestion I dropped into the sugges- tion box showed a little too much of my unhappiness I apologize. I hope, however, that the issue is addressed, because eating some- one else's hair is an experience that everyone will agree is un- pleasant. The thing that we as students must remember is that we are con- sumers. We pay for the service we are receiving. ~f you went into a restaurant and received service that was less than satisfactory you would complain, or perhaps never patronize that restaurant again. Unfortunately, the student body, and particularly freshman are forced into using the food service. Because of this limitation the only way we can hope to change the quality of the food service is by voicing our opinions. I would encourage everyene who thinks he/she has a complaint about the food service to write it on a sug- gestion card and hand it in. Despite all tny negative com- ments, I would like to close the column on a positive note. I would like to say how much of a treat the dinner we received on Halloween was. It was very en- joyable and reflected a notable effort from both the food service management and workers. Editorials, Letters & Disclaimers - - ' . . .

LETTERS Work-Study Job Pay Scale Cannot Be Compared· To Resident Assistants To the Editor, This letter is in response to Anand Rao's article,. circulated in the November lOth issue of The Concordiensis. Dear Anand, it is clear that in your article you are attempting to make the point that people · with work study jobs deserve a higher hourly wage. However, you attempt to do this by com- pariugym1rown work study job. with a non-work study job, that of the Resident Assistant. By doing so, you do Resident As- sistants a great disservice. To begin, the Resident Assis- tant position is recognized by Union College as a para-profes- sional position. The selection process by which RA' s are cho- sen is composed of an intensely scrutinized application, and is followvd by an extensive series of interviews. If a student is ac- cepted as a potential RA, that student enters an t;mpaid train- ing program which lasts two weeks. It is given during sum- mer recess, and thus, potential RA's lose two weeks of sum- mer. It is truly a different type of student who chooses to do this. Even after summer train- ing ends, RA' s are required to attend training sessions every twe weeks, for the entire school year. Secondly, the Resident Assis- tant position requires a large amount of responsibility. It is the RA who checks every room while a fire alarm is going off. We are the people residents go to when there is a roomm(Jte conflict. We are responsible for creating an environment condu- cive to learning. We are re- quired to uphold and demon- strate college rules and guide- lines. Is any of this comparable to a library work study job? We are on duty once per week, from eight PM until eight am. While you may leave after your shift ends, we never leave. After of- ficial duty, we return to being an RA, twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week. This is the responsibility bought for $100.00 every two weeks. You state that you find it \hard ... to believe that the Head RA is entitled to earning more than twice as much money per pay period [as] a work study em- ployee.\ You unfortunately have been misinformed concerning the amount a HRA is paid. Head RA's make $160.00 every two week pay period. For this extra $30.00 a week, a HRA assumes an enonnous amount of respon- sibility beyond that of an RA. Be- yond dealing with all the RA' sun- der their supervision, liRA's are required to investigate all inci- dents which occur in their build- ings. They also attend weekly meetings with the Assistant Dean of Students and the Resident Life professional staff. These duties require an exorbitant investment of time. Thirty dollars is a bar- gain. In conclusion, while you sit at your work study job, reading a book, and thinking of ways to jus- tify being paid more, you are mak- ing a foolish mistake in attempt- ing this justification by compar- ing yourself with an RA or a Head RA. Sincerely, Andrew Coccia, '96 Resident Assistant, South College Send all letters to the Editor to Box 2577 by Mondays at 4PM. All letters must be received on a HD disk on Word 5.0 or lower. casli prizes The 9th A.1tnual November 17, 1994, Page 11 Get Out of the Seventies! To the Editor: I was one of two-thousand thrilled fans to see the Union College hockey team play Clarkson and St. Lawrence this weekend. It is a great change from my freshman year, when we only won one game the whole season. In years past, we would have been happy to leave the rink alive, butnotnow. Now, the team is out for victory, and is capable of it as well. One thing I have always complained about is that Union does not have its own band. I know that we are smaller than all of the other ECAC schools, but we must have a few talented folks here, who would be willing to cheer on the school. In the past, the lack of one has hindered students abilities to properly cheer on the home squad, but technology has helped us in overcoming this lack in our lives. Putting in a sound system was a great addition, but I thought the systems operator might need a little advice. Are you listening? Get out of the Seventies! YMCA and the Top Gun soundtrack are neither good songs nor are they particularly motivating. Now, that are team has improved so drastically we aren't laughed off the ice for that, but I don't want to be laughed out of the rink either. A little techno is always good, Eye of the Tiger works, although old, We Will Rick You is always a team favorite. Think about getting the Mighty Ducks II soundtrack. They have all of the old favorites crowd pleasers there. Just do something. I didn't want to give the Clarkson band any reason to laugh, only reasons to cry.

If I played an instrument I would start one myself, but I have a tin ear. I need help with this one, but I would love to see us move even closer to competing with all of the other snotty ECAC schools. There are plenty of loud obnoxious fans here, who just need something to get all of their loud obnoxiousness into sync, to have those great cheers we all hear on the road. If you are interested in helping to harness the school spirit at Union write a letter to Box 2577, and I will make sure to check in there.

November 17, 1994, Page 12 STUDENT FORUM 1lrly~ C!tnncnrm.ensis Run-Offs For Freshman Student Fol'Um Representatives The Run-off will be held tomorrow. Please do not forget to vote agai~. The rules are the same. You may vote for up to three candidates. The students with the highest three vote totals will be· representatives to the Student Fo,rum. The student with the highest ·vote total will be class President. Suzanne Dougherty After two months on this cam- pus we all now have some idea of what we love here and what we hate; what we think works well and what is inconvenient or a problem. Below is a list of goals and strategies that I would address if I were elected to the Student Forum as freshman representa- tive. Increased Safety and Improved Escort Service - As we all know, there have been numerous problems on the campus concerning student safety. This is a problem that has been, and must be, addressed se- riously and with gr¢atefficiency; A few solutions: expanding the escort service to include either more vans or a walking escort and more and brighter lighting. Broadening Social Options For those Union students who are not big fans of the \fraternity party scene\ the social options are limited. More attempts need to be made to recruit outside orga- nizations and lecturers onto the campus. Expanding the Use of the Vali- Dine Card Every Union College student's savior, the Vali-Dine card be- comes most students' way of pay- ing for almost everything. With this iQ mind, I would like to ex- pand the scope of the card to the laundry facilities and the college bookstore. Better Laundry Facilities Scenario: you go to the laun- dry room to find that there are no washers available or in working order. You wait twenty-five min- utes until one is available at which point you notice that the washer is eating your quarters. Many kicks and about $3.00 later it fi- nally works. Sound familiar? More and better quality washers are needed for those students who prefer to wear clean clothes. Employing the Housekeeping Staff on Weekends The one time of the week when the halls and bathrooms are the least clean/most disgusting is the weekend. The one time when the housekeepers are not working is the weekend. Employing the housekeeping staff for the week- end would make the dorms a more pleasurable place to live on the weekends. It is now Union College's Bi- centennial year, the perfect time to make changes on the campus for the better. While the Student Forum does not have the power to make all the changes it does have the power to make a differ- ence. With your vote 1 will be able to be a part of this and lend my ideas to the Student Forum as freshman representative. Vote for the candidate with the innovation to change. Vote for Suzanne Dougherty. Toby Proctor What do you want to gain from your Freshman year of college? New experiences? Indepen- dence? Representation of your views? If so, a solid line of com'\ munication between the student body, faculty, and administration is essential. My name is Toby Proctor, and as President, the class of 1998 will achieve these goals and reach new heights. My experience with student governments spans from being the president of a small a cappela singing group to, my present po- sition, the Treasurer of Davidson Hall. These jobs require the ca- pability to tackle many types of responsibilities and to cany them out precisely. It also requires a strong relationship between stu- dent and faculty. I think that my experiences will show their im- portance when applied to the of- fice ofPresident of the Freshman class. What I want to gain most from our Freshman year here is to see our class become the most out- spoken, listened to classes the fac- ulty has ever encountered. To achieve this, every person in the class bas to know how student government works. Once we know this, we will know the ap- propriate steps with which we can voice our opinions. I want every one to become familiar with the format of the government and how it can work for them as a whole and an individual. While feeling out my boundaries as class president, I will incorporate the views of the class members in all of my decisions. This is the best way to represent the .class and to express to the faculty how we feel. If I am elected, I promise to keep an open mind to all of your views and to make sure that we have an impact on the school. A vote for me will ensure a strong Geology Seminar: voice for the whole class and a bright future for the Class .of 1998. Ruthie Strosberg For all of you whom I haven't yet met, my name is Ruthie Strosberg. I am originally from Schenectady, but I am not a doid because I don't actually live in the heart of the city but a few miles away .. I would love to be our class president. Amongst the many tdeas I have in mind for class activities, fund raisers etc .. , I wish to see some more class bonding. I mean, I don't know about you but I had a blast at Playfair. Standing ovation, any- one? Additionally, I realize that as freshmen, we don't have an abundance of power on this cam- pus. I will try my absolute hard- est to change that! I am not at all embarrassed to voice an opinion. So, if you bring me your ideas to me, they will certainly be heard and acted on to the best of my ability. I am an ambitious and. cooperative worker. And remem- ber, if you elect me, I will clean your room for free! Ed Dombroski Fellow classmates, my name is Ed Dombroski and I look forward to representing you as your Fresh- man Class President. Over the course of this campaign I have had the opportunity to meet and talk with many of you about your ideas and interest for the upcom- ing year. You have many differ- ent and equally important con- cerns and I plan on addressing as . many of them as possible. As you cast your vote in tomorrow's elec- tion, please select the candidate who can best represent your in- terest. fwill bring to this position the experience. I have had in similar leadership roles in high school; President of my Senior class, Edi- tor-in-Chief of the newspaper, Governor of Student Govern- ment, Capta_in of my sports teams, and President of a community service organization. Experience is going to play a cmcial role in the equation of success in this year's administration. In compar- ing the records of myself and my opponents, you will find that my well -rounded past experiences separate me as the most qualified candidate for office. As a representative in hall gov- ernment I have become aware that Student Government is a very powerful organization on this campus and the decisions it makes have tremendous influence on every student here at Union. A determined, goal-oriented leader is the key to successfully representing the needs of the freshman class- I believe that I fill this role and hope for your sup- port Geomorphic (Landscape) Evolution of the Rio Grande,. northern New Mexico during the Quaternary Period This talk will focus on the surfical geologic processes that have shapes the Rio Grande region of New Mexico over the last ca. 2 million years.

ARTS & ENTERTAINMENT November 17, 1994, Page 13 The Theatre Department Expands Its Horizons New Challenging Courses Are Now Offered to Students by Leena Mankad Arts Editor Many things in the Arts tend to go overlooked on the Union Col- lege campus. Lately, the attention grabbing Yulman Theatre has been the topic of much discussion and many ideas. Discussion for new courses is one such topic, and an exciting new course will be opening up the new Theatre win- ter term, along with numerous other courses offered from the Visual Arts Department. with the complex techn_ical sys- tem the Yultnan Theatre has to offer, and to anyone who wishes to explore tech on future produc- tions. This is not the only exciting course being offered next term. There are also a number of act- ing classes available. These courses are sometimes over- looked by students as blow off courses which mean nothing. This is highly untrue. Everyone should definitely take one class in their four years here. Theatre courses involve the art of ex- pressing yourself in a way that cannot be done through any other means. Acting isn't just making stuff up and pretending. Acting is something you take from your- self, pieces of your experience that you apply to written words in a script. First off, this exciting new course is entitled ll1eatre Produc- tion, an introductory course which will explore the technical and de- sign aspects of piecing together an entire theatre production. Stu- dents wiH be able to design and build the set, deal with props, cos- tumes, lighting and sound for Barry Smith's production of The PrimaryEnglishC/ass. Theplay, which will be put on during win- ter term is a very dark comedy about the inability to communi- cate. In taking a theatre course, one really finds out what is im;;ide of them, what their emotions are really 1aying beneath the surface. These concepts can be found in Barry Smith'sBeginning Acting class. This course offers the stu- dent many things, not just learn- ing about the art of acting. Any- one wishing to become more confident of their emotions, more confident of their speaking and dramatic skills, more confident in one's self should definitely con- sider taking this course. Many efthe e~ercises ~are fun and origi- nal and may include playing with beach balls and other neat con- tact. exercises. Other exercises help the student develop charac- Set and lights for the recently performed play Charles II by Professor Steckler and Professor Miller All technical aspects ofthe play will be taught and mastered with this course. The course will cover the beginnings of set construction, including the use of tools and machines, scenic construction, painting, and lighting and sound systems. Students will gain won- derful experience that will be learned hands on, and which will be presented to audiences. No previous experience is required. TI1is is a must course for anyone wishing to acquaint themselves ter and emotion. This is done by learning to intertwine real life ex- periences with a script and find- ing its reality. New Yulman The- atre Director Bill Finlay will also be providing acting courses which will be equally wonderful. With the addition of Professor Finlay, the Theatre Department's hori- zons will be expanded in great ways, with more to offer students. In other terms, much has been said about improvisation classes. These courses are non scripted and focus on ways of releasing one's creative poteptial. Acting with the use of inner emotion without a script is fun ancl unpredictable, an Selection of Student Drawings at the \New York Studio School of Drawing, Painting & Sculpture\ Courtesty oftlte Visual Arts Department An exhibition of approximately thirty charcoal and acrylic draw- ings by students at the New York Studio School will open at the Union College Arts Atrium on November21, and remain on view through January 13< 1995. The drawings, some over ten feet high, are transcriptions of masterworks; a second group of related draw- ings are figure studies by students enrolled in the fall Drawing Mara- thon. The innovation of Dean Gra- ham Nickson, the Drawing Mara- thon jump-starts the semester with an intensive two-week workshop in which all students draw from live models, a hallmark of the school since its inception in 1964. Despite individual approaches, guest faculty share the strong be- liefthat working from observation is the wellspring of art. Says Nickson, \From qe Kooning to cavemen te Mondrian - they all drew from observation .... Drawing is the fast- est line too experience. It's the probity of art.\ In a short time, students are ready to tackle the five foot by seven foot drawings shown here from Nickson's class. Meticu- lous plottings in space and time, the gradual accumulations of marks serve to both locate and measure. The elaborate set-ups which first appear as backdrops, become unified through the per- sistence ofvision. A second group of drawings features transcriptions of master- works, carried out in conjunction with the school's annual fall ben- efit exhibition of historical works and student and faculty transcrip- tions. Based on the theme of The Great Interior, form the Roman 'Villa of the Mysteries' cycle to Balthus ' 'La Chamhre ·,the draw- ings on view display a variety of . interior settings as painted by the great masters, ranging from the intimate harmonies of Vermeer to the baroque drama of Tintoretto. \A transcription is not a copy,\ explains Nickson. \It is a ... tangible visual record of the desire to get the core of the master'-s own being.\ Students worked in pairs, and teams, on scaffolding in transcribing, in many cases, life-size drawings. Many discovered that drawing with others energized an acceler- ated the process. Among the many drawings to be exhibited include Water Seller of Seville, by Jean-Paul Torres, who graduated from Union as a Visual Arts major in 1994. The exhibit will be in the Arts Atrium from November21 to January 13, 1995. Are you interested in informing the campus about the arts at Union? Contact Suzanne at x6155. experience like no other. A challenging string of courses, but still eventful are the directing courses. This course, taught by Professor Smith as well, focuses on students actu- ally directing and handling their own theatre scenes. Students are taught to juggle the responsibili- ties (i)f real directors, including creative and technical direction. Maybe you could be the next Oliver Stone. On the more technical side, as features in another article, Charles Steckler and Jolm Miller offer wonderful courses on set design and lighting. Design for theatre involves set design, cos- tumes, props, masks, posters for theatre, and various studio experi- ments. A theatre practicum with John Miller will definitely sit well with anyone interested in design- ing or operating lights. John's superior command of the area provides for an interesting course. The theatre department pro- vides some wonderful courses. It doesn't matter if you're an engi- nee~; or an English major, these courses are designed for anyone· that has an interest in theatre and public speaking.

Louis makes the choice to become a vampire, with Lestat \instructing\ him in hew to use his immort~l powers. Lestat can move with lightning speed, se- duce aristocrats (his speciality) and drink their blood, and is particu- larly disturbed at Louis,. who re- tains a bit of humanity in not pre- ferring to kill humans.

The film delivers its shocks in the fonn of grotesque neck and ann-biting, scenes which inten- sify the passion and sexual over- tones of these characters. Rats, chickens, and humans are drained of blood left and right, but these vampires exist for the chance to become \spiritually-connected\ to their prey, or so it would seem. Lestat indulges in prostitutes, Louis defends his moral code by only eating animals at first, and Claudia (true to a young child) cannot get enough, drinking from many fresh victims against the behest ofLestat not to. Pitt deserves above-the-title billing as Louis, a vampire who has matured into an almost som- ber-state by the time he exists in 1994 San Francisco. Cruise proves he is becoming more than Arguments Over the. Sequel We've All Been Waiting For by Leena Mankad Arts Editor With all the hype about the up- coming movie sequel .\'car/efl. a continuation of Gone With the Wind. there have been numerous arguments about the idea of the sequel. When a movie or book is ex- tremely successful, chances are, a sequel is produced. This is of course doi1e in effort to keep the money rolling in for a longer amount oftime. In this case, Mar- garet Mitchell's Gone With the Wind was both a successful book and film, hence propelling these- quel Scarlett by Alexandra Ripley. The book was a success, intriguing many readers into the I ife of Rhett and Scarlett yet again and this week, its movie version will be airing on NBC. I hate seq\Iels. Frankly, I en- joyed the ending to Gone With the Whul where Rhett basically spat in Scarlett's face. I enjoyed hav- ing a nice and complete ending with no qttestion. Why must we make up a~other story and con- tinue the saga? Goodness, Gone With the Wind was saga enough. A close to five hour saga about a melodramatic woman chasing her sister-in- law's husband during the Civil War. Scarlett, a spoiled brat de- cides she needs this guy Ashley for her life to be complete and goes after him without regard for poor sweet Melanie, his wife. Af- ter she gives up on that ordeal, she decides she still needs a man and ends up marrying four men in the process. And then there's Rhett... some egotistical, witty man v. i1o falls for Scarlett like a fool, and for some dumb reason wants to spend the rest of his life mak- ing her happy. What a dork. He fi- nally gets fed of in love with im and storms of the door with the \Frankly my dear ... \ bit. Oh, I for- got, she delivers a baby, saves a handful of soldiers, rebuilds a plantation named Tara, and falls down a set of velvet stairs all while she's screaming hysterically. Then again, she seemed to be rather bitchy throughout the entire film anyway. The question is, why is this con- sidered to be the greatest film of all time? I don't understand why this film is regarded to be some epic in cinematic history? All it rr.:11ly is a long story with a lot of melodrama. Yeah yeah yeah, the film won a bUnch of shiny awards in 1939. So what? I think it was dull. Personally, I think that The Wizardc?{Oz, which was also up for best film that year, should have won. Call me craz)r, but I thought that watching a bunch of munchkins dancing around was much more entertaining. The story was much more moving besides. The Tin Man received a heart, the Scarecrow a brain, and the Lion got courage. These were all things that they had in- side them anyway. The symbol- ism is much better in this movie than in Gone With the Wind. I leamed more from the Wizard of Oz than I ever did from Scarlett and her frolics. At any rate, the sequel Scarlett I assure you is going to be an- other melodrama providing much annoyance to all. Not only will the plot be superficial, but the players will be different. No one likes replacements in their favorite films or soaps, and this just forces the audience to wince. If your a fan of the so-called classic lo\e tale of Scarlett and Rhett, then you 'lllove Scarlett. If you thought that Terminator was more meaningful than Gone With the Wind, then don't watch ,\'car/ell. It's bad enough Shannen Dougherty played Mar- garet Mitchell in a tel'evision movie about her life last week on CBS ... from Brenda to southern belle, I think not. If you want to oppose my views, I would be more than welcpme to receive your letters in Box 1236. just a pretty .. boy actor; he handles his role with confidence and pur- pose, transforming his Top Gun image into a stable and dynamic presence on screen. Unfortu- nately, his motives are too com- plicated to be conveyed effec- tively in what is ultimately Louis' story; hopefully, Rice's sequel novels to Vampire will be adapted to the screen soon, when we can get a better look at Lestat. This mainstream shocker is not your conventional fare, and direc- tor Jordan (best known for 1992's The Crying Game) portrays these vampires not as monsters but pas- sionate creatures who thrive on spirits. Even Slater is mesmorized by Louis' story. Unfortunately, as with most screen adaptations of great nov- els, this film concludes with an ending that is nothing short of a cheat. The viewer has come all this way just to see this? The clos- ing credits theme, performed by Guns and Roses, is lyrically per- fect but destroys the sense of eter- nal passion brought about thmugh these creatures. Nevertheless, Jordan has made a ·fine film, but one which, due to its graphic nature, may not appeal to all tastes. Rice twists the tradi- tienal vampire stories and makes them better, which is why all view- ers should discard notions of Count Dracula and flying bats when watching this film. Compar- ing this work to the most recent shock-fest, Mary Shelley's Fran- kenstein, one can see that grandi- osity can have its place in these films. What Kenneth Branagh, the director of Frankenstein, should learn, is that there is a time and a place for pretension. Vampire uses all that gore and gut-wrenching special effects to its credit.

November 17, 1994, page 18 SPORTS Former Islander Attends Union the ability to .positively contrib- ute at any time. \Their talent can carry them a long way. If they can put together a winning streak, they will have the confidence in th~mselves to play as a unit,\ as Loiselle well knows from his experience with two Stanley Cnp semifmal teams. \If. you are a team on a streak, you have the confidence and be- lieve that you can beat anyone no matter what the situation.\ ground instead of working to- gether for the bettenne.nt of the sport.\ Loiselle feels that the NHL needs to come up with a different· agreement rather than a salary cap. by Andy Auerbach Contributing Writer As most Union College stu- dents search unsuccessfully for the NHL on TV nowadays, a former NHL player walks to class with us every morning. Claude Loiselle's professional hockey career began in 1981 when he was selected ~y the De- troit Red Wings in the first round ofthe National Hockey League's entry draft. The next four years Loiselle spent his time traveliqg back and forth between Adirondack of the American l Iockey League and Detroit. Af- ter a fom year stiJ.lt v.ith the Red Wings. Loisellt: was traded to the Nt:\\ Jersey Devils; \\here he sp~111 th~ next three years of his cuccr Durin!,! that time. he c:x- pcric:JH.:cd \\hat was perhaps the high point of his career as a cru- cial memberofthe 1987-88 Devil squad whose incredible playoff run landed them an appearance in the Stanley Cup semifinals. Following the 1988-89 season Loiselle was traded to Quebec where he played for two years. Then, after a one year stay in Toronto, he ended his 13 year career playing for the New York Islanders. Before retirement, he helped them shock the seemingly indomitable Pittsburgh Penguins in the I 'J92-93 Patris;k Division Finals in one of the more stirring upsets in NHL history. Now, he is the newest member of the Union College Hockey coaching staff. After being drafted in 1981, Loiselle had to decide whether to attend college or step directly into the Nlll.,. Despite being recruited by many schools, Union included, he chose the latter and began play in the Red Wings minor league system. While he does not neces- sarily regret this decision to by- pass school, he does now offer dif- ferent advice. \I feel now that the college route is a smarter route since you end up with an education that you can usc after professional hockey. I am glad to sci! that more of the players today arc going to get their education first before pro- 1\.:ssional hockey, because it will help them in the long run.\ Now that his NHL days are behind him, Loiselle has returned to school, setting his sights on at- tending law school some time in the near future. As a lawyer, Loiselle is planning on staying involved with sports either by working with arbitration cases or becoming an assistant general manager somewhere in the NHL. When asked, \Why Union?\ Loiselle replied: \ I chose Union because of its affiliation with Albany Law, and 'l'lhlis is the last issue of The Concordiensis for the fall termo As always, thanks to all of our contributors, and we look forward to serving the campus during the exciting winter term.

Once Loiselle made his decision to attend Union, he contacted coach Bruce Delventhal and asked ifhe could get involved with the team. Delventhal was more than hap~y to acquire Loiselle's services, hir- ing him as a volunteer assistant coach. Concerning the Skating Dutchmen's chances for the up- coming season, Loiselle seems to be more than optimistic. \I like the team a lot. l11ey are a great group of guys with a lot of talent.\ What has seemed to impress Loiselle the most is the fact that the team has four very strong lines, all loaded with talent and As a former NHL player, Loiselle obviously has strong feelings regarding the current la- bor strife between the players and the owners, one that has resulted in missed games, lost revenues, and angry fans. \There is no reason that this issue could not have been settled last year. Both sides are being stubborn and standin.g their \It makes no sense to have a salaiy cap,\ he argues, \because the players should make whatever the market dictates. On the other hand, total free agency doesn't work either.'' Loiselle suggested that maybe there should be a profit sharing agreement between the players and the owners. This might help alleviate some of the pressure placed on the owners to bring in all the money, thus transferring some ofthat pressure to the shoul- ders of the players. Until then, though, Loiselle is content to work with the sport's future stars wearing the garnet and white. Swimming Demolishes Rochester by Julie Ivanyi Concordiensis Staff The Swim Team traveled to Rochester this past weekend to begin their dual meet season. After being in the water for less than a month, Union anticipated a competitive meet. In the last couple of years, the Rochester women have greatly improved, therefore giving Union a run for their money. Once again, the freshmen, both men and women, eagerly swam in their first colle- giate dual meet. The men dominated the meet right from the start by winning the Medley Relay. Freshmen, Jeff Fawcett, Mark Anderson, Mike Darbyshire and Sophomore Mike Humphreys set the pace of the meet by touching out Rochester. Divers Brian Field and Matt Baumgartner captured 1st and 2nd in the three meter diving event, setting themselves apart from Rochester and leaving a mark for the upcoming competi- tion. Scott Fitzgerald swam the 1000, placing a close third with an admirable time for this early in the season. Senior Adam Horst also swam this race, beat- ing two men from Rochester and scoring for Union. This dominance continued with freshman Matt Glogowski swimming a quick 50, as well as scoring in the enduring 200 Fly. Eric Majeron claimed the 200 Fly, beating his opponent by one tenth of a second for first place. · Mike Humphreys and Scott Bowden took 1st and 2nd in the 200 Back, leaving the rest ·Of the field a body length behind. The prosperity prevailed, as Eric Menard swam the 200 IM and the 500 Free. The winning 400 Free Relay consisting of Than Stuntz, Geoff Wolfe, Pete Spaulding, and Chris Riley finished the meet with a score of 145-92. Although the women swam as well as the men, it took them to the third event, the 200 Free, to claim the meet as their own. Jackie Crane beat the rest of her competitors in this race by a mini- mum of eight seconds and com- ing just three seconds away from breaking her own record. Flo Chretien and CeCe Buchanan swam the grueling race of the 1000 Free and later went on to swim the 200 Fly and 500 Free, respectively. Jonathan Meade, Eri Hayashi and Sarah Spaulding only gave up one place to Roch- ester in the 50 Free, taking 1st, 3rd, and 4th. The 200 IM gave strong indications of the future with Jenn Allaire, Megan McCarthy, and Alyson McKee seizing close places of 1st, 2nd, and 4th. Divers Amy Lamphere and Nicole Rubin all scored within a two point spread. They placed 1st and 3rd, respectively, in the one meter event. In the three meter event, Rubin placed 1st and Lamphere took 3rd. Aixa 01azagasti, in her first year of competitive diving, dove well scoring 4th for Union. In the strenuous event of the 200 Fly, Mo O'Donnell came from behind to just miss catching her oppo- nent for 2nd place. Jenn Allaire and Sarah Spaulding came two seconds and four seconds, respec- tively, away from making the cut- offs for Na1ionals. Freshman Colleen Reilly swam back to back events of the 500 Free a.nd the 200 Breast, and scored in both. Freshman Melissa Pomerleau also swam the 200 Breast, beat- ing her opponent by a mere three tenths of second to finish a pow- erful 2nd. The women out swam Rochester with a winning score of 141-95. The Dutchmen will strive to continue their winning streak at Wesleyan this Wednesday. This will be the last dual meet until January, when the team begins biweekly meets. The first week- end in December the Dutchmen host an Invitational meet, which will include some of the compe- tition that will also attend the State Championships in Febru- ary. Join the Concert Committee - Call Elissa at 346-9140 Anyone interested in becoming an editor of The Concordiensis staff should contact David or Heather at x6155 or stop by CC 303 before the end of the term. Positions officially change over at the end of the winter term, and we need interested candidates.

SPORTS November 17, 1994, page 19 NCAA Selection Committee Bypasses Union; ··nutchmen Will Host ECAC Championship by Ken Bel'man Sports Editor The Union College football team received some mixed news t,his past week concerning its playoff possibilities. The bad news is that Union will 1~ot be making a rctum trip to the NCAA playoffs this year (amid a sketchy selection process), but play will continue for the squad. Instead of the NCAAs, they will compete for the ECAC Northwest ch<un- pionship this Saturday on famil'-' iar Bailey Field, against an 8-2 UMass-Dartmoulh squad. Kick- off is scheduled' for high noon. Although Uilioi1 can not be ter- . rib1y disappointed in a season culminating in its ninth playoff UNION appearance in the past 12 years, a better ending could have cQme for the season. Union finished ranked fifth in the Eastern Re- gion of the NCAA, which in most other years would have been ac- ceptable with a 7-2 record. I low- ever, given the rash of upsets to afflict most of the regions top teams, the Dutchmen could have easily been one of the top four teams in the poll, tlms securing a pi ayoff spot. They have the best case against Buffalo State, who stumbled to the finish line with a mediocre 6-3 mark. The obvious qt1estion to ask here is how a 6-3 team fin- ished ahead of a 7-2 team. The given (and only possible explaination) is the fact that the November 19, 1994 • Bengals opponents finished with an overall record of 43-41-3, while Union's foes tallied only a 39-45 mark. But should this be pertinent infonnation, given the differing records? One should think not. We also should won- del' about the possibility ofhigher political powers at work in the selection committee. Regardless, what's done is done, and the ECAC playoffs arc nothing to be ashamed. of. UMass-Dartmouth finished with a schqol record· 8 w.ins (against 2 losses), and will be a good test against Union.

The Dutchmen, who at times this season have had trouble running the ball, should be able to get it going against a suspect Dartmouth run-defense.

The weather should be unseasonably warm, so you have no excuse to take a time~ out from the hockey season and watch the last football game of the year.

November 17, 1994 PAGE20 Union Throttles St. Lawrence, Ties Clarkson Dutchmen end first weekend in third; extend regular season conference unbeaten streak to 11 by Dagan LaCorte Hockey Correspondent This past weekend the 1994- 95 Skating Dutchmen opened their ECAC season, playing host to the Saints ofSt. Lawrence, and the Golden Knights of Clarkson. Coach Bruce Delventhal wasted no time in testing freshman goalie Trevor Koenig in league play; giving him the start on Fri- day against St. Lawrence. Koenig; and the Dutchmen, re- sponded well, turning in perhaps the most convincing win in their Division I history. Union opened the scoring eight minutes into the first period, while on the power play. Ryan Donovan scored his first goal of the season, with assists going to Reid Simonton and John Sicinski. The Dutchmen took a 1-0 lead into the locker room, but that didn't last long as the Dutch- men exploded for four second period goals. Five minutes into the second period the Dutchmen went up 2- 0, on a beautiful goal by Andrew Will. Defenseman Dean Goulet picked up the puck in the defen- sive zone, passed it to Troy Stevens who saw Will heading up ice. Stevens passed the puck to Will, who carried it inside the blueline and blasted it by the Saint's goaltender. Less than three minutes later the Dutchmen extended their lead to 3-0.

Thirty one seconds later Russell Monteith scored his third goal of the season, on as- sists by Ryan Donovan and Reid Simonton. However Union's lead would not last long, as by the end of the second period Clarkson had tied the score on the strength of two power play goals. For the next twenty five min- utes of play, Union was able to hold on to their one point due to Gallant's efforts~ tunting away all of the Knight's final 16-shots. Union played well despite forfeit- ing a two goal lead. Kudos. go out to Dean Goulet, who thus far this season has been a defensive wall, leading all Dutchmen play- ers with a plus/minus of nine.
