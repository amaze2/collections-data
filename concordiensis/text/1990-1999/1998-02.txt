Papanickolas Staff Writer During dte past year there have been more than a dozen trips to the hospital conceming a varfety of problems. Nevertheless,. most of these trips hav~ been a resu:lt of alcohol consumption. This issve is of growing concern tp_ the Union College administration andconse- qt1ently it has tightened itsgripon Union's social atmosphere. Many wonder what can he done to stop this overindulgence or at least create situations that would deter such behavior. A group of students has begun a proc:ess to help the community; it W()t!ld in tum aid on the back-e1id of this apparent problem. UMED has.pro- posed to the administration and se- curity a plan to start an Emergency Medical Service on Union's cam- pus. The idea behind this pragrarn is two-fold: first it will .allow students to getquick medical attention here on campus and second \it will hopefully limit the number of stu- dents needing to go to the hospi- tal,\ says the president ofUMED, Katie Bartok The way in whichthe plan woald work is that if a student were in need of care and they were to call security UMED technicians woald then be dispatched. Once UMED arrives to the scene ofthe call they will be able to determine the appro· priate course of action: either handle the emergency themselves or radi<> security for ambulance assistance. At first this program· would be ef- fective during Friday and Saturday nights from6 pmto6am, which are prime hours for Union's social scene and which tends to he peak times for accidents to occur. There are many l0gistical con· cerns to the plan that still need to be worked out with security and the school. In addition, Union's law· yers still need to rcev-iew the liabili· ties of the program and detemrine .if it would be feasible at aU. Regard. less, security,. Dean Alford, and President Hull find the idea to be very interestingand, if at all feasible suppert it. The advantages pf this program to students would be tremendous. If the proposal were to pass as sub· mitted then the following action would occur if a student were to call UMBO arrived and evaluated the situation to determine that No hos· pitalization was neede<:l, the student would only suffer a first offense dis· ciplinary action, which would con· stitute speaking with the deans and paying a fine, However, if the s111dent were to go to the hospital, the conse· quences are a fine, a letter to their parents, a meeting with the deans, an alcohol awareness class, and all the hospital and ambulance charges. It is easy to see that the , benefits to the community would be great. A time-frame for·this program if it were to pass quicltly and unhin- dered could be anywhere from , four weeks to the beginning of spring term. Yet, this proposal is in the process of being evaluated by the President's board, Union's lawyers, and security. The plan has a long way to go but the idea is promising. Bartok believes that, \campus wide EMS is something that every campus shoQiqhav~ and its long over due at Union.\ Hopefully, the admin- istration agrees and with any luck UMED and the school will be able to work .around any legal ob- stacles that may arise. · For those interested in the pro- gram, UMED is looking for more members, regardless of experience or certification. The organization will train anyone who may be in- teFested. On Tuesday, February lO, 1998 at 7pm in Humanities 115 UMED will be holding a meeting; and, anyone interested is urged to attend. Otherwise, those inter- ested should contact tile officers of UMED: Katie Bartok, Craig Champion, Adam Murphy, or Tim Lash. Ringing in The Asian New Year by Michelle Neier Staff W1·iter Friday night marked Union's first celebration of the As ian New Year. Mostcommon'ly celebrated in China, the new year does not occur on January l 51 , but later on in the winter. A dinner to honor the holiday was organized by the Asian Student Union, whose presi- dent is Li-Hsi Wang. Following the dinner was a dance organized with the help of both Shakti and Student Activities. Students at the dinner enjoyed a great meal, heard a speech by vis- iting Prof. Jianping Feng, at1d were entertained with the \Dance of the Lion.\ The new year in Asia begins on January 28. It is based on a lunar calendar and each year represents a different animal. This year is the year .of the tiger. Prof. Feng, ex· plained the rituals and customs to bring in the new year in China. She explained that the holiday is typi• cally one marking a time of rebirth and l'enewal. PeoJ>le try to settle debts, clean their lives (both liter· ally and figuratively), and also if they can afford it, buy new clothes. Typically, the night marking the start of the new year, families eat a large dinner together after setting off fireworks at midnight. Also, friends and family .exchange littl~ envelopes with money in them as gifts. Another popular Chinese custom celebrating tl1e new year is the \Dance of the Lion.\ Two stu- dents at the dinner danced in the costume of the lion while another student played the drum to accom~ panythem. A11 of the students enjoyed the speaker and the perf()Jmers as well as the food. The appetizers, espe- cially the sushi, were enjoyed by all, as were the main dishes. The food represented some of the ma- jor Asian countries, including Vietnam, China, Thailand and Ko- rea. Junior Christine Myo, a mem- ber of ASU explained that the din- ner was a way to teach the stu- dent body about some of the ritu- als in Asia. She said tlmt, \ASU has been trying to focus on more traditional aspects of Asian cul- ture.

Campus News Call UMED Instead of Ellis by Nicholas E. P:apanickolas Staff Writer During the past year there have been more than a dozen trips to the hospital concerning a variety of problems. Nevertheless, most of these trips have been a result of alcohol consumption. This issue is of growing concern to the Union College administration and conse- quently it has tightened its grip on Union's social atmosphere. Many wonder what can be done to stop this overin<lulgence or at least create situations that would deter such behavior. A group of students has begtm a process to help the community; it would in tum aid on the back-end of this apparent problem. UMED has pro- posed to the administration and se- curity a plan to start an Emergency Medical Service on Union's cam- pus. The idea behind this program is two-fold: first it will al'low students to get quick medical attention here on campus amd second \it will hopefully limit the number of stu- dents needing to go to the hospi- tal,\ says the president ofUMED, Katie Bartok. The way in which the plan would work is that if a student were in need of care and they were to call security UMED technicians would then be dispatched. Once UMED arrives to the sceme of the call they will be able to determine the appro- priate course of action: either handle the emergency themselves or radio security for ambulance' assistance. At first this program woald beef- fective during Friday and Saturday nights from 6pm to 6 am, which are prime hours for Union's social scene m1d which tends to be peak times for accidents to occur. There are many logistical con- cerns to the plan that still need to be worked out with secarity and the school. In addition, Union's law- yers still need to review the liabili- ties of the program and determine if it would be feasible at all. Regard- lesos, security, Dean Alf<Jrd, and President Hull find the idea to be very interesting and, if at all feasible support it. The advantages of this program to students wowld be tremendous. If the proposal were to pass as sub- mitted then the following action would occur if a student were to call UMED arrived and evaluated the situation to determine that No hos- pitalization was needed, the student would only suffer a first offense dis- ciplinary action, which would con- stitute speaking with the deans and payiRg a fine. However, if the student were to go to the hospital, the conse- quences are a fine, a letter to their parents, a meeting with the deans, an alcohol awareness class, and all the hospital and ambulance charges. It is easy to see that the benefits to the community would be great. A time-frame for this program if it were to pass quickly and unhin- dered could be anywhere from four weeks to the beginning of spring term. Yet, this proposal is in the process of being evaluated by the President's board, Union's lawyers, and security. The plan has a long way to go but the idea is promising. Bartok believes that, \canpus wide EMS is something that every campus should have and its long over due at Union.\ Hopefully, the admin- istration agrees a11d with any luck UMED amd the school will be able to work around any legal ob- stacles that may arise. For those interested in the pro- gram, UMED is looking for more members, regardless of experience or certification. The organization will train anyone who may be in- teFested. On Tuesday, February I 0, 1998 at 7pm in Humanities I 15 UMED will be holding a meeting; and, anyone interested is urged to attend. Otherwise, those inter- ested should contact the officers of UMED: Katie Bartok, Craig Champion, Adam Murphy, or Tim Lash. Ringing in The Asian New Year by Michelle Neier Staff Writer Friday night marked Union's first celebration ofthe Asian New Year. Most commGnly celebrated in China, the new year docs not occuronJanuary !\'' lateran in the winter. A dinner to honor the holiday was organized by the Asian Student Union, whose presi- dent is Li-Hsi Wang. Following the dinner was a dance organized with the help of both Shakti and Student Activities. Students at the dinner enjoyed a great meal, heard a speech by vis- iting Prof. Jianping, Feng, and were entertained with the \Dance ofthe Lion.\ The new year in Asia begins on January 28. It is based on a lunar calendar and each year represents a different animaL This year is the year of the tiger. Prof. Feng, ex- plained the rituals m1d customs to bring in the new year in China. She explained that the holiday is typi- cally one marking a time of rebirth and renewal.

Another popular Chinese custom celebrating the new year is the \Dance ofthe Lion.\ Two stu- dents at the dinner danced in the costume of the lion while another student played the drum to accom- pany them. All of the students enjoyed the speaker and the performers as well as the food. The appetizers, espe- cially the sushi. were enjoyed by all, as were the main dishes. The food represented some of the ma- jor Asian countries, including Vietnam, China, Thailand and Ko- rea.

Markowski said, \$50 is a lot of money. People should make the best of it.\ The committee, which currently meets weekly, hopes to spur new activities and looks not to fundal- ready-existing activities. The pro- posal review process is by no means a simple one, as three out of the four proposals. reviewed this week have not yet received any approval. Alford stated that these were not necessarily dead propos- als, and the committee would rec- ommend proposal changes so that the groups could benefit from the new fund. For instance, one group re- quested money for an off.campus trip to another school. The com- mittee will recommend to that group that they should present some .sort of activity on Union's campus after the trip to share what they l~arn or teach others what they have been taught. Senior Ed Dombroski, who sits on the Planning and Priorities Com- mittee:, is thrilled to offer such op- portullities to the campus and hopes the students follow through on utilizing the money. \This is a lot of money, and it shows an in- credib-le commitment by the 'P and P.' The future of the program is based on the response and num- berofproposals the committee re- ceives. If this response is posi- tive,.[ see no reason why it would not continue.\ The grant committee invites any student interested or who has questions to contact them for more infon11ation. Additional information can be foun() in the Dean of Students Of- fice O>n the third floor of the Cam- pus Center.

Maturity? Look in the Mirror First Over the past two weeks, many people have suggested that the President · United States, Bill Clinton, should step down because the example he is setting the country is, in many ways, dangerous to impressionable minds. Dt~ringthe 200 years, some parents have told their children that tile President is someone emulate, but now, some of those same parents do not know whether tlJ.is is longer true. Here at Union, we would like to emulate our adult role models in th.e fashion. However, of late, this has been a self•defeating prophecy. The liJllount maturity, for the most part, shown by the student body, has equaled, ifnot passed at times, the amount shown by the administration and faculty of tlie · tion. It was students that stepped LIP to the challenge last tenn to head offiUlY backlash from the national drinking deaths. The IFC, Panhellenic Cotancil, other students swiftly, yet methodically forinulated a set of guidelines which people, including President Hull and Dean Alford, agreed would help calm \problem\ofdrinking at Union. After ten academic weeks·ofhard work and consuming meetings, those guidelines were nearly ready to be enforced fully. Now, however, those same students are scratching their heads at reaction made by Dean Alford when he called for the \probation weekend.\ did not give the policies a chance to even work, helping to render them, in the of many people, as futile. This is the same man who tries to teach students to before they act. So, the question becomes: should we foHow what our adult model teaches us to do an.d make guided, infonned choices, or should we ..., ... u\'''\l Dean Alford and make quick decisions with possibly ham1ful consequences? The problem is by no means confined to Dean Alford or the aoJnir:!istration.j Last Wednesday, Professor Wilson Bryan Key gave a presentation abo;utth.e duction of advertising and advertising ex.ecutives' abilities to use sex · to sell their products. Dvring the presentation, students were abuzz allout interesting the presentation was, even if they did not necessarily agree with points. Enter Professor Greenberg, who felt Key had no facts to back up his. claims • Instead of using a calm, interrogative tone with Key to prove his: poimt, he tempted to grandstand and even take over the presentation of our invited What Professor Greenberg di·d was, in actuality, attempt to use his fie!~ of chology as a weapon against Key. As long as we have attended Union, we have been taught to respect others opinions, even if we do not agree with them. We have also been shown polite to use our own knowledge so that we can have intellectual debates in: a forum. Again, do we emulate our elder role model, in this case Professor G:reen or do we follow what he and his colleagues have taught us during otJr stay Union? Just like in the case of students, the grand majority of the administr:ation faculty are respectable, polite people who follow what they teach. Howe-ver, are always a few exceptions. Students are asked perpetually to repri111and fellow students who do not show that level of maturity, but our elders do mot reouttl their colleagues who make parallel mistakes. This helps enlarge the fissure tween the students and the administration. Union students want to work with and learn from their elders, not against We have seen here that the student body, the faculty, and the administl'ation indeed composed of very similar people. Therefore, all three groups nee(! to to each other and give equal consideration to their points. Once everyome that respect is something we must earn, and is by no means a given, a \more feet Union\ can finally be achieved. Drinking Options There is a new alcohol policy in the works. If this policy is put intc effect, Greek houses on this campus would have two options - either do not l-et fresh- · man into parties or keep parties between fraternities and sororities clos:ed to all except members of the houses hosting the party. The aim of this polic:y seems to be to curb opportunities for freshman to drink. I do not understand bow keeping parties closed would accomplish this goal, although it would keep freshman who were not new members of these organizations from drinking at parties. I cannot help but see some shortcomings to this policy. Freshmen drink in their dorms. If they were not allowed into partiies, they would continue to do just that. When I was a freshman, plenty of my class- mates drank in their dorms. We drank, and this year's freshman class clrinks, at parties too, but if the goal is to prevent underage drinking, this policy will not work. However, no policy is perfect, and a step in the direction of the g;oal does help. There is another issue here, one that affects the Greek system. Yes, 1 do have a biased opinion about this, because I am a member of one of the Greek organi- zations that will be affected by this. However, it is an opinion echoedlly many people with whom I have .discussed this. The Greek system is the soci~~:l system here, but responsibility for un~erage drinking cannot be placed full;y on the Greek system. What ever happened to taking responsibility for oneself? Un- derage students should be able to go to a party where alcohol is bein~ served and just not drink. The presence of alcohol does not imply the necessity of drinking it. Peer pressure is strong, but no one has a gun to anyone's head at these parties. I.f you can't control yourself when you drink, no ma\iter what your age, drink less or don't drink at all. Imagine the uproarthis campus would see if parties became closed to inde- pendents. This Opinion section would sure be busy. To those in policcy-mak- ing power who do not wish. to see fraternities and sororities.become elitist and exclusionary, this would be a step in the wrong direction. Members .of houses have independent friends whom we welcome when our parties open. I cannot imagine that fraternity or sorority members would wish to exclude th~ir inde- pendent friends. I know I wouldn't want this. Such a policy would arouse the anger of many people, would create tension between Greeks and indep-endents, and would increase drinking in dorms. The administration might try alterna- tive policies that focus on the problem rather than circumvent the problem. Some suggestions I have heard are wristbands to be worn by those 21 a:nd older or treating parties like a regular bar - show identification or don't expect a • • ntons Still Keeping \U\ .Safe Tbe R~pe of Mr. Smith The law discriminates .against rape victims in a manner that would not be tolerated by victims of any other crime. In the following example, a holdup victim is asked questions similar in form to those usually asked a victim of rape. Officer: \Mr. Smith, you were held up at gun point on the comer of 16th and Locust?\ Mr. Smith: \Yes.\ Officer: \Did you struggle with tbe mbber'r\ Mr. Smith: \No.\ Officer: \Why Not?\ Mr. Smith: \He was arm~d.\ Officer: \Then you made a conscio11s decision to comply witf:J his demands rather than to resist?\; Mr. Smith: \Yes.\ Officer: \Did you scream? Cry out?\ Mr. Smith: \No I was afraid.\ Officer: \I see. Have you ever been held up before?\ Mr. Smith: \No.\ Officer: \Have you ever give11 money away?\ Mr. Smith: \Yes of course ... \ Officer: \And you did s<> willingly?\ Mr. Smith: \What are you getting at?\ Officer: \Well lets put it like this, Mr. Smith. You've given money away in the past. .. in fact, you·have quite a reputation for philanthropy. How can we be sur(!! that you weren't contriving to have your money taken away from you by force?\ Mr. Smith: \Listen ifl wanted ... \ Officer: \Never mind. What time did this holdup take place, Mr. Smith?\ Mr. Smith: \About llP.M.\ Officer: \You were on the street at llP.M.? Doing what?\ Mr. Smith: \Just walking.\ Officer: \Just walking? You know that it's dangerous being out on the street late at night. Weren't you aware that you could have been held up?\ Mr. Smith: \I hadn't thought about it.'' Officer: \What were you wearing at the time, Mr. Smith?\ Mr. Smith: \Let's see. A suit.

Assaf Yosha's Views From Spain by Assaf Y osha ClJntributing Writer As most of you should know, last week the Pope; made an his- toric visit to Cuba, a communist island that lies no more than ninety miles off the coast ofFiorida. I sa:y most of you because, as I under- stand it, there has been some tur- moil re<:ently concerning the pri- vate affairs of our president, Blll Clinton. Unfortunately the scall- dals may have overshadowed some (}.f the worthier events that have taken place throughout tile world. Here in Seville, Spain tlte situatiO'll is slightly different. For exampl-e, in last Monday's El Pais, one ofd1e major newspapers of tile country, the first five pages were dedicated solely to the Pope's vis.it to Cuba and the state of Cuba as a whole. rhe relationship between Cuba and Spain is special because of the unique history which they share. Cuba had been one of tlte first nations colonized by Spain duringtlte 16th century, anditwas the last colony to gain. its indepc;Jn- dence fiom Spain (with the aidnf the United States). In 1898, tlte year in which Spain lost its richest and last colony, the Spanish nati()n underwent a massive period of dis- illusioll and depression, since tile loss of Cuba signaled the death of an empire. So strong were the feel- ings toward the Joss that they in- spired anew literary wave known as the Generation of'98. This year Spain commemorates the both the one hundred year anniversary of the end of the empire and the Gen- eration of '98. When Fransisco Franco, the Span ish dictator from 1939 to 197 6, passed away, the new Span- ish socialist government re-estab- lished relations with Cuba. Cur- rently, Spain has great economic interest in Cuba, especially in the sphere oftourism. As a whole (and this is a generalization); Spaniards sympathize with the plights of the common people of Cuba and the growing poverty and lack of suf- ficient nutrition and medicines. Many here believe that as an hu- manitarian superpower that exists next to Cuba, the United States should be giving their assistance to those who are suffering. Unfor- tunately, US politics, that is to say the Helms-Burton embargo and its many supporters, does not always see the suffering of the poor nor the hypocrisy of their very own ideology. While that may be the general opinion here in Spain, ·many people also realize that the goveJllment of Fidel. Castro also contributes to the worsening social condi.tion~. , of . his, .. nation. So the Pope visited Cuba. Now what? What did he do besides drive around in his Pope-mobile and yawn a Jot? Was the Pope, the pontificate of the Catholic Church, the man on EaFth who speaks the word of God, able to achieve something substantial? A few in- teresting facts first. While Castro, when he took control, declared his communist island as an atheistic state and· denied the authority of the Vatican, the Cuban populace continues to practice a religion. Bttt neither qm Cuba be consid- ered a 'Catholic' nation (as Spain is with a Catholic population of ninety percent). The majority of Cuba practices Santeria, a r~ligion of African origin that was brought over during the slave trade of the colonizing· era. According to El Mundo, another large newspaper her~ in Spain, Cuba has a Catholic population that does not reach ten percent! Nevertheless, the Pope was re- ceived by Castro and thousands of Cubans left their shanty homes to go a11d hear him lead amass. From the articles I have read and the lo- cal people that I have spoken to here in Seville, this is what I have gathered. Firstly, as a religious visit they believe the Pope has served to inspire hope in the hearts of the many impoverished Cubans • living on the island. and in the hearts of the large anth·Castro Cu- ban communities living in exile in FIQrida. But will hope be enough to improve their live.s or return them to their abandoned homes and families? While these are questions of humanity, their reso- lution lies in the hands of politics, and the Pope has a large amount ofpol itical power.

AsU11ion c,tlumni we were reallyplea:sed to see a Union student ventut'ing out of their comfort zone t() better understand the world ~rl)und them.

Heath also mentioned that he felt like a \stranger in a .s.trange land.\ Througl1out his article, Heath ind.ic:ate.s that he llelieves that \religion\ is a\:)()llt what people do to reach out t<J, or understan<l god, their WI> r.l d, or themselves. Fro1r1 this perspective, Excel is per!laps a stranger \land\ than he rt7alized. Few•if any of the 1~2()0 high schoo.J atudents there were engaged in \religilln\\ as he understan<ls it Rathel', they were there to build or explor.e their relationship with the G()d who created them. Christiallity is about what God has do-net<O reach out to as through Jesus, rather than vV:hat ''religious\ people are doing tO< reach out to god. This is what di:stir:1guishes Ch;istianity from all otruer philosophie.s and what personally attracted us to God ma11y years ago. 'fliis business ·of Christianity being about a perso;nal rel:ationsh ip with God raises a11other question we had cof:lc•erning Heath's artic:le.

For my part(Matt Hopkins '88), g.rc:wvi.ng up in a non-Christian family, I did \inherit\ many of my pa:re:nts' values.

I agree with Matt that eveiy person atsome time in their life has to decide which of their parents' values and beliefs they t.V:llll make their own. I ,also know that my faith is based on what Je:sus did to make knowing God possible, not on what my parents did_ Heath's response to Sarah's statement about wanting to follow God reveals a very popular philosophy that we saw all over· the Union Colle.ge campus during our years there. When he encouraged Sarah to consider if \it wasn't better to' live life the way she wanted to,.\ Heath was \preaching'' mainstream Secular Humanism by implying that mankind is the end all of reality and therefore is its own source of authority. We wanttoencourage Heath and other Union students, who recognize that they hold such beliefs, totake Heath's advice and \ask yourself, 'Do I believe this be¢a\lse it is something I have experienced and found to be true, or has it been handed down to me from another source?\' We can't agree with Heath more. We should all carefully examine the underlying assumptions a:bout truth and reality that lie beneath statements we mak.e each day and see if they are consistent with the . reality of our lives. We want to close by inviting Heath (and any other Union students for that matter) to return Excel next year.

Ordinarily, I am not a letter writer. With all the writing I do day in and day out, one of the last things on my list ofpriorities is to >VTite a letter to Concordiensis or any other publication. However, after reading the lead .story in last week's issue \Union Students Seek Off-Campus Places to Drink,\ 1 felt it more than necessary to convey my d1oughts. My issue is not with l)e~n Alford's dry weekend, nor is it with Geppetto's owner Paul LiGhorat's decision to break the law by serv]rrg. beer and h:ard liquor to underage students (as stated in paragraph two, sentence two). My issue, or shoulcU say \concern'~ is with those students who could not last one weekend -two days -without a: desire to d.rink. I am nottaJlcin.g about those who wanted to protest Dean Alford's dry weekend, I'm talking directly to ifuo~e students ~11o could not survive the weekend without the desire to drink- and then drinking. For those who claim ill.~y need to <irinl< to \relax I am concerned. For those students who claim they drink because ''there is1:1' t anything else to do on campus,\ I am concerned. There was a time in my life when I h~d myself co:nviEJced that driolcing was the only way that I could relax. It was one- and only one -of my \'good;' reas()ns to drink. I C<ln tell you honestly that I have never been more relaxed, more happy Dear Editor, With the increasing availability of lasers, especially as pointers, it might have come to your mind-how safe are these things? Probably their misuse has caused more concern than their legitimate use. Basketbal'l fans have been observed to ·shine the beam from laser :pointers into the eyes of the opposing player who is attempting a foul Sh()t. Receivers on a football team have been the reception of the beam roving around thdr eyes in an attempt to blind them to the ball. Goaltenders' vision has been effected by these beams. Other people h~ve been curious about how far their beam might travel and in doing so have their beam reach into the cockpit of passing airplanes. Police oJ,ficers walking through a neighborhood or while passing through in their patrol cars have been the object of.these laser beams. Others try to see how long they can stare directly at the beam. Except the latter e){ample, the other uses pr@bably will not cause any direct damage from the beam to the individual. Laser pointers only have an adverse effect from over heating tissue and with normal use the exposure is · short enough not to overheat tlssue. Of course if the tissue is inside the e::y.e and the time of exposure is long, the damage might be permanent. Le<Jking directly at the beam for relatively short periods of time can c~use permanent damage. Healthy individuals normally are not ca- p able of looking Into the beam for sufficient time to cause permanent darn.age. Although the above cases, with the exception cited, do not cause · direct damage, they have alarmed police officers who think they have . ·l>een targeted by a laser gun sight. So far no one has been shoot as the , result of a protective reflex reaction. Pilots have been temporarily lbli ndecl and have temporarily lost control of their aircraft. I don't lcnow what happened to the athletics. The legislation to stop these iilciaents is being drafted. One additional c0ncem is the legitimate use in the classroom as point- . er~. It turns out that when an absented minded professor sweeps the beam through the audience 1 it will not cause any permanent damage to s0meone with normal eye reflexes. Those drugged or drunk might ha.ve problems but these cases are not likely if the beam is just casually passing past their face. Nevertheless, speakers should avoid this mis- use of the pointer. The beam being reflected from a projection screen • 'v'lill have little effect on those in the room unless they are right on top · of the screen, then it will cause temporary blindness. Observing the beam through a mirror like surface can cause harm. Observing the beam through a focusing lens could also cause a problem. These examples having been given, it should be clear that when used in an appropriate manner, laser p<Jinters are safe. There are pos- sible problems if not used appropriately. In addition, newer versions of the pointers are using longer wavelengths and the eye reflexes are not as good in these regions. This increases their potential to cause damage. My recommendation is to realize that laser pointers are safe f:Jut caution should be observed so that potential harm will be avoided. there is nothing gained by leaving the beam pointed on a highly re- i1ective surface for an extended period of time. They are great point- ers and once the object has been identified remove the beam. Moving 1l1e beam around reduces the potential for harm as compared to leav- iag it focused on one spot. Ifyou find yourself blinded by inappropriate use of a beam, estab- lish which eye is effected and look through the other eye until the affected eye recovers. More likely than not the loss of vision is like snow blindness and is not permanent effect. Respectfully submitted, Professor John R. Sowa Laser Safety Officer for the College Views From Spain ...

Opinions Prof. Greenberg Asks: Where is Honesty Last Wednesday's lecture on subliminal advertising provides a great opportunity to explore one aspect of '\-vhat has been referred to as the '~dumbing\ of America. I am concerned about the c,tpparent inability of some to discrimi.nate between science and science fic- tion·. In an effort to convince us that those bastards from the adver- tising world have stooped to an all time low by appealing to our more base instincts at a subliminal (un- conscious) level, Dr. Key leads us on a pictorial search for s.exual in- nuendo in a series of advertise- ments. The venture was reminis- cent of looking through a \Where's Waldo\ book, but this time it was \Where' s Penis and Vagina.\ Embedded in one ad af- ter another, as Dr. Key saw it, were concealed references to vaginas, penises, death masks, and homo- sexuality. His discussion was right up there with the supermarket tabloid's searcll for two-headed alien babies. If society views the discussion as entertainment, all is fine, but what I witnessed that night led me to the troubling con- clusion that even at a prestigious institution of higher learning, Union, a substantial portion of our citizenry is not very skilled at dis- tinguishing conclusive support from conjecture, data from opin- ion, thoughtful discussion from lu- dicrous claims. What one student said to me after enduring my rather loud and critical Fesponse to the lecture was that \it is your opin- ion against Dr. Key's, and he has sold more books, so why should we believe you.\ Amen. It was that remark, and hearing the student cheers that accompanied Dr. Key's claims that professors are \simple\ people who are not capable of un- derstanding his points, and that psychology is a bunch of \non- sense,\ that compelled me to write an analysis of his presentation. To begin, lett~s·tryto understand the positions tak.en by Dr. Key. First, he argues that ads contain material that the mind does not detect. Second, the material is so cleverly concealed that our minds must rearrange the printed mes- sage, unconsciously, to discover its hidden elements. Third, these ele- ments are generally sexual, or death-linked. Fourth, such refer- ences should make the product more appealing, because themes- sage is taboo. Fifth, these \spe- cific\ appeals will be so powerful as to prompt us to purchase the product. Some were confused by his supraliminal message, so I hope this sets it straight. OK, fair enough-so what's the problem? Essentially, that not one of the five claims (or assumptions) Dr. Key has made have gained any scholarly support. or make any sense. I begin by describing a few of his more notorious examples to illustrate his logic and his failure to acknowledge the data. I con- clude with a general warning about his tactics. In one example, Dr. Key shows us a cigarette ad wherein he sees the word \cancer\ on the label of the hockey equipment\displayed in the ad. Interestingly, as he notes, the company that makes the equip- ment is \cooper'' o·r something similar. He blows up the picture that appeared in the magazine so we can see that the letters may ac- tually spell cancer. Great! First, it is just as likely, given the blurry nature of the font, that in fact the mystery word was actually cooper. Second, in order to detect the word he had to enlarge the selectedpart of the picture a:bout 1 00 times, Now does he suppose our brain does that as well, i.e., go through mental exercise of exploding an image to uncover a message that it has no way of knowing is there? Further, several students, includ- ing one who did a thesis analyz- ing the ad ( 60 pages he claims,.. must have been captivating, a 60 page thesis on one ad), never saw the word cancer. The student must have looked at the ad for several months. How exactly, is our brain going to detect .information that months of constant and close scru- tiny failed to uncover? Assuming he is cerrect about the brain pick- ing it up, what value is there in in- serting the word cancer in the ad? According to Dr. Key, it reminds us of death, an~ smokers want to die. What data does he have to sup- port that-have you asked your smoking friends lately whether they wish to die? But assuming again he is correct, and our smok- ing friends don't know they want to die, why must the word appear in the ad? Well, Dr. Key argues that the ad carries the message to convey the information that ciga- rettes kill in order to entice smok- ers with a death wish. Perhaps, he should have shown us the bottom of the ad, where the government warning carries pretty much the same message. So, the question for Dr Key is why would a company need to insert this death-wish mes- sage, when this ad, as do other smoking ads, carry the message anyway? How would this ad gain an advantage when virtually all ads for smoking indicate the health risks? Dr. Key's point is cute, but fails to address why such a point would make the ad a bigger seller than other ads where the same claim is made, and hence why an advertiser would need to make a point subliminally that is already is part of the visible landscape. Further, and this is crucial, there is no cognitive research to support the claim that we process sublimi- nal information in ads, no support that hidden items are more persua- sive than messages not hidden, no evidence that people who smoke wish to die, and no evidence that an appeal to a death wish works. I submit that there is considerably more support for the claim that tobacco companies have tried to downplay the harmful aspects of smoking, not emphasize it. (See recent legal suits).Let'·s think this through, Dr. Key. Most rmpor- tantly, there is no support that even had the ad got it right, that the un- conscious .message would trigger a respo!lse to ptuchase. When I · sayn0 support·, I mean exactlythat, since many of these claims have been tested by the scientific com- munity. The second ad is a rum ad. Dr. Key actually ran a test of rum ads early in :his career, and had ob- tained evidence that hidden rnes- sag~s in the ·ice cubes made one rum more preferable than others. However, when research psy- chclogists repeatedthe study (ref- erence V okey & Read, American Psychoi<>gist, 1985, 1231·1239), no preference was shown. It is re- ported that in the original Key study, the ruin with the hidden message also dajmed '\extra spe- cial\ in fa II vi~w ·of his readers, unlike th.e oth·er ·TUih atls. In aodi- . tion, the special rum was darker in color, and was the ohly rum iri a high-starus brandy snifter. We call these other factors. coilfoundbJg variables. Key's work is not han:. ored in the scienti fie press becaqse it is so p(Jorly controlled. penises and vaginas all over the place, but I suppose if given the task, 'Ye could find dashboards, tulips, toads, etc. Who knows we may even find clams in a plate of clams. How does Dr. Key support his contention that subliminal ads work'? Well many of the. ads he describes are successful, ~., they are used again and again, make money, etc. Has it ever eccurred to him that su-ch ads !llay work for other reasons? Manipulations of subliminalmessages in ads, in con- trailed research, have repeatedly failed to lead viewers oftho~e ~ds to indicate a preference for those ads over others, ot select products thatthose ads favor. Of course; he knows all that, and this is why this entertaining presentation becomes · rather disturbing. In order to counter the evidence of which he mtiSt be aware (scientifi-c journals are·notpublished &.ublimirial1y), he hnmedt~tely.p~int~ ~ut· in 'his lee- . ~_re that t.}l.e !?C~9J~r!y con1m6nity, the psychologist, the professor;the scientist, doesn'.tlq'low very much.

Of C(Jurse, one could pencil in Dr. Key, clever marketing, it does whatever one wants. Dr. Key finds not demonstrate _understanding, ex~eHence of argument or perfor- mance. Dr. Key indicated his ignorance in so many ways. For exa,mple,_he claimed at one point during the lecture that since Skinner came along, psychology has failed to study conscious and unconscious processes. That is what have cog- nitive psychologists been studying the last 30 years. Remarks like that indicate how out of touch he is with the work about whkh he speculates! So whell'a student suggests it is. just my opinion against his, and we both have an equal opportunity to be correct, the student is .missing. . the point about education. While we can all engage in speculation, and briNg forth fresh ·ideas, We are' also obligated to test those ideas, expose them te our colleagues and await their verdict. Should it be shown that our claims are incor- rect we should move on. Thus, it is not simply a question of whose ~-\opinion?? is correct, but,what have we learned by testing a pafticular hypothesis~ln the case ofpr. Key, the field for twenty years has failed to support his position, and he ig- ' nores the results. Dr. Key bypasses the normal channels, so as not to face the verdict about his work from his peers. Instead, he _enters a campus, where fresiL:tninds, un- familiar with the evidence, wish to grasp the Wbrld aHttle better, and with humor and slickness, he sells a \scientific\ view without foun- dation. The irony is that Dr. Key is warning students about the sleazy adve.rtising profession that is trying to get them to spend their money, as he walks away with a fat check forth~ presentation of his discredited position. The goal of education is to make one a more informed and analytic consumer .of information. If at Union College, students fail to discern the differ- ence between a reasoned presen- tation and a clever lecture gim- mick, I am troubled by what is ahead. Freshmen's Fake IDs Plague Geppetto's I am writing this letter in regard to the a.rticle in the January 28, 1998 issue of The Concordiensis, entitled '\Union Students Seek Off- Campus Places To Drink.\ I must say that the article was well-writ- ten and quite informative. How- ever, I feel that myself and my business were treated rather un- fairly by Ms. Pertoso. First, I would like to state tllat I was blatantly misquoted. I never said that my establishment was very bu:sy due to the dry weekend on the Uni(Jn College campus. I simply stated t11at there seemed to he a few more Union students than usual f<>r a Saturday night. Obvi~ ously, we I(Jve catering to the col- lege crowd. As I stated in the ar- ticle, \we never had any problem with Union students drinking too much. Usually, students come in for a bite to eat or a cocktail be- fore going out on campus.\ I am an active supporter of Uniool ath- letics and student body. Many times, the senior students athletes and student body will stop in to unwind after an athletic event. I enjoy my interaction with the stu- dents at Union. I would hate to see this jeopardized by the misrep- resentation of my establishment due to Ms. Pertoso's comments. I am quite perplexed by the sec- tion of the article that states that I serve freshmen here at Geppetto' s Restaurant. It may be easy for Ms. Pertoso to recognize who is a freshman, but is not that easy for· my doormen. All patrons are asked to present a valid drfvers li- cense at the door. Maybe I should ask the freshmar. to wear their freshman orient.ation t-shirts. Ob- viously, we do the best possible job in admitting people into our establishment. I take great pride in our doormen, two of whom are Union College alumni. In conclusion, I simply ask why someone would write such things that are malicious to ahy bar owner. I have always done my best and will continue to serve both the citizens of Schenectady and the students of Union College.

Science & Technology What Was That Called Again? Memory! by Victoria Hargreaves Science & Teclwology Editor Where are my keys\! What is that person's name? Wh.at was I supposed to buy at the supermar- ket? What was the h()lllework as- signment? Although these may be common questions for some, they are increasingly becoming the concerns of the middle-aged and elderly as researchers are finding that early detection is the key to treating Alzheimer's disease, \a common disorder ass<>ciated with aging.\ Alzheimer's disease, which af- flicts approximately 4million Ameri- cans, is a fonn ofdementia, \a loss in the brain functions responsible forth inking.\ Although memory is not fully understood, some scientists be- lieve that as we age, thebrain' s \re- trieval system\ slows down mak- ing it harder and taking it longer to remember. The Departn1ent ofPsy- chology at University College in London has recently re])orted that they believe aging only affects the \intentional conscious retrieval processes,\ not the «automatic, unconscious retrieval processes.\ \However when this slowing pro- cess is accompanied by a loss of problem-solving ability, language difficulties, and a general dete- riorationofthinking ability and behavior changes severe enough to interfere with activi- ties of daily living, there may be a memory disorder present.\ Further research is necessary to fully understand the memory. Former Presid.ent Ronald Reagan who will turn 87 this · Friday was diagnosed four years ago with Alzheimer's. The Alzheimer's Association and Nancy Reagan advoca,te the impor- tance of an early diagnosis. Mrs. Reagan said, \Getting an early di- agnosis allows more time to plan for the future.\ Alzheimer's disease occurs when brain cells die resulting in a \loss of thinking and remembering abilities.\ The chief causes of Alzheimer's disease and memory loss are believed to be aging, de- pression, sleep deprivation, ill- ness, drugs, head injuries, and al- cohol. Even one glass of wine can distort a person's memory. Symptoms include memory loss, mood swings, repetition of .ques- tions and stories, selfneglect, and dependency on others to perform tasks one once did with facility. Unfortunately, there are no cures for Alzheimer's currently, hut \an early diagnosis gives people with the disease a greater chance of benefiting from existing and experi- mental treatments.\ These current treatments include medication, be- havioral tactics, and the help of a nurse. By analyzing a person's medical life history, performing a physical and neurological exam, and mak- ing a psychiatric evaluation, a doc- tor can detennine if a person has Alzheimer's disease. Doctors and psychiatrists recommend the fol- lowing tricks to combat a faulty ·memory: make lists, stick to a daily or weekly schedule, con- nect ideas in your mind, be or- . ganized, write important ap- pointments on a calendar or in a personal organizer, keep ob- jects you need daily in the same location, and repeat a person's name when you are introduced. Some physicians suggest running through the alphabet men- tally to remind yourself ofthe first letter of a word you have forgot- ten. Some books on il;nproving memory advocate mnemonics, a system first used by the Greeks, which associates words with let- ters and sentences. A \memory enhancement\ study conducted at Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York, found that confidence is important irt memory. Dr. Cynthia Green, the di~ rector of the Memory Enhance- ment ?r.ogram at Mount Sinaj, be- liev~s that without confidence, the problems,ofaperson who. has dif~ ficulty rememberin~\snowballs.\ Although the subjects did notre- tain infonnation after a long period, their confidence increased.signifi- cantly (Gilbert F 1 0). Ellen Lang, a prof~ssor. 0f ps~chology at Harvard University believes that rnem()ry can he improved by \'mindful' learning\ which encomr- ages originality and analysis (Hilts f;J-7).

That gives businesses less than a year to find and fix all possible references to a date in their reams of code. individual computer user will see little effect on the applications used ()n a daily basis. However, if the businesses fail to face this problem, it could have an enormous impact on all of our lives. by Jennifer Tmtts Staff Writer One month into 1998~ how many of you are thinking about the year 2000? Not many, I'm guessing, and fewer still are thinking that it will be the end of the worldas we know it. However, by dismissing that thought as simply a tabloid proph- esy, we are ignoring S()me impor- tant facts. Sure, you've all heard of the \Year2000 Problem''mthe \Mil- lennium Bug,\ but hovt many truly understand the implications of January I, 2000? We often do not realize our dependence on comput- ers in our daily lives. Everything from drivers licenses to air traffic is controlled with computers. Even our economic system draws its life- blood from the flow ofdigital in- formation. Slowly but surely we have converted from the Gold Stan- dard to the Electron Standard. Imag- ine the chaos if these systems failed. So what is this horrible thing that threatens some ofthe rn<>st funda- mental parts of our society? On Saturday, Januaty 1 ,2()00 most of you will still be sleeping off a wild party(ifit is even over), and com- puters all over the world will be happily processing avvay. The problem lies in wl!at they are processing. The hardVI'are will not fail, and the softwarevvill probably not crash, but the calculations that are made have the pot<lntial for di- saster. For instance, I was born, in 1977, so in the year 20()0£ will be- 3 3, right? I will be to a program that calculates age with only two digits rerresenting the year. Ry default. the year 00 is assumed to be 1900, so if you think yuu ha v~..: pr()blcm::. paymg your bilb on time as i.t is, JUSt wait until they arc overdue by 100 years! As absurd as that con- cept is, it's a definite possibility, and it would have larger implica- tions than you might imagine. How could this have happened? Is it so difficult t<J have an extra two digits in the date1 In this day of 4 GB hard drives as standard equipment on a personal com- puter, it seems silly to have left them off. But when computers first entered the business world in the late '60s and the early '70s, they were very expensive. This 'ex-. pense' was tied directly to two as- pects of computing: how much data could the computer store and how fast could it process that data. Even tiny, incremental increases in either attribute resulted in huge cost increases. We compromised on accuracy vs. cost when it was decided to store only 2 digits (')[the year. Part of our reasoning was that surely our code would be replaced within 30-40 years. We assumed that the program we were writing in the '60s would not be in use 30 years from now. That particular assumption was wrong, very wrong. We have way too much old code, known as 'Legacy Systems' in use today. Major applications are still using code developed in those early days. Some companies have on the or- der of 1 00;000,000 (or more) lines of legacy code. To give you an idea of what a huge project that implies, consider the job of reading through that many lines. Assum- ing 8 hours a day, .5 days a week. It would take you just over 13 years to look at all your C()de. ·or it would take 13 people one year. Or 156 people could do it in a month. So, just hire a bunch of people, slap them down in front of a tcnninal and voila, problem solved, right? • \ > ,. ~ ~ .. ~ • \ ~ ' e • ,j ~ V ~ • 0 .. .o- 0 0 > A < ... f • • ' 0 ~~ •• • ·., ' 0 - 0 Wrong. ICall you had to do was do a search for the word \Date\ in all of your code, it might be that simple. Unfortunately, there are no stan- dard naming conventions within the programming industry. So, you could be looking for \Bdate\, \Week\, \Expires\, or even \Snow- ball,\ for reasons only the pro- grcimmer (long gone) knows. All right, so we brought this on ourselves. But fhat isn't the worst of it. Even today, with less than 2 years to go, programmers .are still building applications that depend on only 2 digit years. Why? Fun- damentally speaking, humans aren't known for thinking ahead, even when it is staring them in the face. This is especially true in the computer industry where job life- times are usually in tlie range of one to five years. The programmer feels little responsibility for the future of the code they leave be- hind. To make it worse, our deadline is not OliO 1/2000, as we would ,all like to think. Enormous numbers of changes have to be made, some as simple as changing a line of code, others more complicated. In order to be sure the code still funcm tiolls after all these changes are made it has to he tested, So if you j,ust barely make your changes by New Year's 1999, what do you do The deadline is fast approaching, but few companies really grasp the significance. Many are waiting for someone to discover a magical cure, waiting for a knight that will ·never arriye. There is no simple solution to this problem. It will be a huge, costly project for all that embark upon it which is why not all have. Again, with our eye on current cost, we miss the price we will pay later. Most of these warnings go out to corporations and government agencies with legacy code. The The millennium may bring utter chaos and ruin to us, but an al- mightyGod will notdeliver it, in- stead, it will be from our own lack of foresight. The majority of the population regards the problem with varying degrees of concern, mostly on the lower end of the scale. We are so confident in the abili- ties of our technological advances that we assume ~omething as slmple as a date co\lld never lead to our downfall. Only time ~ill tell ifthat assumption is valid, or if it is as poor as the one made 30 years ago.

World News & Views New US Policy Allows for Nuclear Force by Liam JClynt WorldNeJPs Editor In the face ofa!lo.ssiblemilltary conflictwith Iraq, the Clinton Ad- ministration has cl'langed its policy regarding the use of nuclear weap- ons. In November, P're~ident Clinton signed a directive allowing the use of tactical nuclear weap- ons against \rog.u state.s'\ that use weapons of rruss destruction. Such an attack by the U.S. would violate the Nuclear Nonprolifera- tion Treaty that b<Jth the U.S. and Iraq have signed, but U.S.. officials say Iraq's pursuit of nll.elear weapon technolo:gy forfeits their protection by the treaty. Tactical nucle.ar weapons are designed primarily to destroy small, short rang<C sites; opposed to strategic nuclear weap()ns that aredesigned to deli\er a larg;er im- pact from a long ra11ge strike. The policy was change<! largely in re- sponse to fear5 that Saddam Hussein will use Scud rockets to deliver Anthrax S}Jor~s throughout Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and Israel. The types ofbDitlbs used in a tactical nuclear stJil<e are kn()wn as \mini-nukes.\ Th!e B61-7artd B61- 11 warheads have about one kilo- ton ofexplosivef()rce. Inc&mpari- son, the bomb .dropped on Hiroshima in W\Vllhad 13 kilotons of explosive force. The 851 war- heads still have 300 to S<JO times more power then tile largest non- nuclear warhead in the U.S. arse- nal. The B61-7 is dropped from a fighter-bomber mdexplodes either above or directly at the surface. It is suspected that such a bomb would throw up a cloud of radio- active dust. The B61-ll was de- signed specifically for deployment by B-2 stealth bombers and the warhead dri'lls into the ground be- fore explosion. It is still under de- velopment and is intended to de- stroy undergroti'nd bun- kers. Since it explodes un- derground, it would not cause large nuclear fallout. This new policy by the Clinton administration is · the strongest stance in fa- vor of using nuclear weap- ons since the Reagan ad- ministration. During the Persian Gulf War in 1991, President Bush said in a speech that the U.S. would retaliate with nuclearweap- · ons if Iraq used biological weap- ons, but there was never a defini- tive policy directive developed as with the Clinton Administration. Many analysts believe that Saddam Hussein never used his stores ofbiological weapons in the GulfWarbecause of the statement by President Bush, but others. say that it was poor tactical planning that stopped him. With the Clinton administration continuing to warn iraq of \sub- stantial\ force if they do not com- ply to United Nations weapons in- spections, the new nuclear weap- ons policy solidifies the strong U.S. threat afforce. Although the U.S. a11d other United Nations Security Council members are still attempt- ing diplomatic solutions, the U.S. is taking steps to increase their military forces in the Persian Gulf. Ecuador Attempts to Sue Texaco research done by scientists work- ing for the plaintiff, there is sub- stantial pollution of the rain and ground water near drilling areas. .Since most Ecuadorians do not have running water, theydrinbain- water, now filled with toxins.

The suit was filed by two American law firms in United States District Court for the South- ern DistrictofNew York in 1993 and asked for more than $1 billion in damages and cleanup costs. The case was dismissed last year, but is presently being reviewed 1:fy the United States Comi of Appeals. If the Court ·Of Appeals uphold the district courts case, it will probably be appealed to the Supreme Court. Texaco began drilling for oil in Ecuador in the early 1970s and pulled oat of the country in 1990. By 1977, Texacowasonlyajunior partner to Petroecuador, a state owned oil company. According to ian countryside. Either way, the resolution of this case will be precedent setting, since it deals with international standards for pollution control and the liability offoreign companies in the countries they preside. IMF Criticized Borrowing money from the In- ternational Monetary Fund has never been a favored option by countries suffering economic mis- fortune. Wllen the I. M.F _ loans a large sum of money to a country, they also expect to dictate certain aspects of that countries economic recovery. In essence, when a coun- try borrows from the LM.F. they are giving up some of their sover- eignty. Usually, these directives by the I.M.F. attempt to stabilize currencies and banks while retu1111- irtg the faith in the market of for- eign investors. Unfortunately, this often comes at the expense of tile common citize11. When Mexico was bailed out in 1995, I.M.F. p()licies stabilized the peso and regained the faith of for- eign banks, but atthepriceofhuge unemployment, social unrest, in- creased poverty, and econom.ic in- equality. Similar scenarios have been predicted for Indonesia a11d South Korea, who have both re- cently accepte<l large loans from the I.M.F.

However, effective this rmming (2/5/98), I, FrankS. Rossi, ll, resign a Editor-in-Chief of 1k Concordiensis four issues short offulfilling my me-year tenn. There are several reasons for my resignation, and I will give you a few. Naturally, a senior's workload is not conducive to many ext:racurricula activities.

I will still help all that I can, so do not expect my name to vanish completely from thl n~paper. . Ancther reason, probablythe reason that pushed me towards this decision, is that I do not believe V\bat I help publish every week an)\llDfe.

II.: ', ' ·.___.:__:_. w New US Policy Allows for Nuclear Force by Liam Joynt World News Editor In the face of a possible military conflict with Iraq, the Clinton Ad- ministration has changed its policy regarding the use ofnuclearweap- ons. In November, President Clinton signed a directive allowing the use of tactical n tiel ear weap- ons against \rogue states\ that use weapons of mass destruction. Such an attack by the U.S. would violate the Nuclear Nonprolifera- tion Treaty that both the U.S. and Iraq have signed, but U.S. officials say Iraq's pursuit of nuclear weapon technology forfeits their protection by the treaty. Tactical nuclear weapons are designed primarily to destroy small, short range sites; opposed to strategic nuclear weapons that are' designed to deliver a larger im- pact from a long range strike. The policy was changed largely in re- sponse to fears that Saddam Hussein will use Scud rockets to deliver Anthrax spores throughout Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and Israel. The types of bombs used in a tactical nuclear strike are known as \mini-nukes.\ TheB61-7andB61- 11 warheads have about one kilo- ton of explosive force. In com pari- • son. the bomb dropped on Hiroshima in WWII had 13 kilotons of explosive force. The B61 war- heads sti 11 have 300 to 500 times more power then the largest non- nuclear warhead in the U.S. arse- nal.

Gulf War because of the statement by President Bush, but others say that it was poor tactical planning that stopped him. With the Clinton administration continuing to warn Iraq of \'sub- stantial\ force if they do not com- ply to United Nations weapons in- spections, the new nuclear weap- ons policy solidifies the strong U.S. threat of force. Although the U.S. and other United Nations Security Council members are still attempt- ing diplomatic solutions, the U.S. asked for more than $1 billion in damages and clean up costs. The case was dismissed last year, but is presently being reviewed l:1y the United States Court of Appeals. If the Court of Appeals uphold the district courts case, it will probably be appealed to the Supreme Court. Texaco began drilling for oil in Ecuador in the early 1970s and pulled out of the country in 1990. By 1977, Texaco was only a junior partner to Petroecuador, a state owned oil company. According to !MF Criticized Borrowing money from the In- ternational Monetary fund has never been a favored option by countries suffering economic mis- fortune. When the I.M. F. loans a large sum of money to a country. they also expect to dictate certain aspects of that countries cconom ic recovery. In essence. when a coun- try borrows from the I.M.F. they are giving up some oftheirsover- eignty. Usually, these directives by the I.M.F. attempt to stabilize currencies and baNks while retum- ing the faith in the market of for- eign investors. Unfortunately, this often comes at the exvense of the common citizen. When Mexico was bailed out in 1995, l.M .F. policies stabilized the peso aAd regained the faith of for- eign banks, but at the price of huge unemployment, social unrest, in- creased poverty, and economic in- equality. Similar scenarios have been predicted for Indonesia and South Korea, who have both re- cently accepted large loans from the I.M. F.

13,- Micltelle Tham J!.eatlll:es Editor Okay, the time I have been spending at Sunnyview hospital is . obviously co11suming my life. I am devoting yet another articl-e to my experiences there and the ·effect that they have over me. One of the results ofhavin g suf- fered a stroke for some patie11ts is an inability to control ern«>tion. Some burst out .laughing pe:ri:odi- cally while otllers cry unco•mtr()l- lably. It's a strange thing we hu- mans possess, the ability to :sup- press or express anything firo•mjoy to elation to a11guish. Losin:g that capability can be a terribly diffi- cult thing to deal with. I guess what struck me most about my work this past week was the fact that one of the men siarte<l crying in the middle of on.e o0fthe recreational .activities I was ilelp- ones. Crying is an embarrassment, a denial of everything that is mas- culine and male. I am sorry that it is such an unaccepted action for guys to show amongst themselves. I melt when gu:ys cry over some- thing meaningful because I can catch a glimpse of their sensitiv- ity, but 1 will also adrni~ that it's not the most attractive thing to see a guy crying because someone said something mean or insulted him. I know there is a terrible double standard at work here. It's perfectly fine for me and my fellow females to release a dam of tears simply because we accidently wore two different socks to class one day and someone noticed, but for a guy to get upset because someone decked him and broke his nose is an embarrassment, right? (I'm only kidding ing to set up. It came out of no- where, suddenly tears were stream- ing down his face and he had to .leave the room. .--------------------. of course.) ~' Truthfully, though, tears arren 't so ter- riiJle. They are a lt'ay to letAJut peFtt-up aggres- s~on, anxiety .ttnd hurt.\ It's such a strange thing, the way the two dif- ferent sexes have developed emo- tionally. Tears represent precious moments and times of intense bonding between women. The value of o~r greatest I think that more than anything, he was embarrassed. He kept apologiz- ing to everyone and covering his face. Myheartwas breaking at the sight of hi.m. l ~------------------~ memories is based wanted to tell him it was okay but there was nothing I could saxy that would take away the shame·lhe felt in crying in front ofthe other mem- bers of the stroke group. The whole situation wa:s just very strange for me. When I was high school, I cried so often ()\fer test grades. My parents had a.lvvays had some ultimatum overm)Jhead as to what would happen to me ]fl dared score below a 90% a.Jn any- thing. Many times, the pres:sure would just catch up with me and I would end up bawling i11 the middle of the hallway. I always had caring friends to consl()l e me, but I was still embarrassed by the tears and rush of emotion I allowed myself to express in front of ev- eryone. Over time, though, I realized that crying actually made 1!1 e feel better in an ir()rtic sort of ~\Y· I equated crying with an em0ti()nal release ... the ultimate exp.res~ion of emotion a11d pain. Built-up stress melted ;away from me and gushed out .) n th<J form of salty tears. Althougb I am definitely the extreme case:,s,; in I cry more than any other P'elfSI()n I have ever met, I do think th!at ~Cry­ ing is a healthy form of hmrman expression. And sometimes I just w~it f()r the tears to c<>rne; because I feel so much better afterwards. ;[ think .that that is something guys dl()n\t have. Men have been given the: \Ill- bearable job ()f being the \stl'()ng\ on how hard we cried and how red our eyes were. Tears for men, on the other hand, are reserved for such meaningful things as thei~ favorite team win- ning the Superbowl or the loss of their favorite mesh shorts. Honestly, I am exaggerating a bit, but stereotypes often h(l.ve their foundation in the truth. I guess I do w·ish that crying was more ac- cepted for the opposite sex, and that they actually used them for appropriate situations. It is a wonderfully soothing re- lease and maybe if guys cried more often they wouldn't have to get in fist fights to let out their aggres- sions. Wait, just kidding. I am walk- ing a fine line here. I am not say• ing that men are completely insen- sitive, just that they need to be more confidant in their own feel- ings. Truthfully, though, tears aren't so terrible .. They are .a way · to let out .pent-up aggression, anxi- ety and hurt. And they are even better when they are due to happiness. 1 think that one of the most w~mderful sights I have ever seen is my uncle crying when he gave away .his daughter on her wedding day. That was an admirable display of emo- tion, and something he was proud to show. There was nothing embarrassing about the salty streaks running down his face. Those tears com- manded respect from everyone in the room. THE DANGER ZoNE by Jason Everett Staff Writer No, this is not a s1i~-up With the layout people, and \The Danger Zone\ has not been mistakenly placed in the Features section. After .countless rave revrews (well, enough froih people who matter), 'I have decided that havillg this column solely in the sports section was too inhibiting and I needed a little more flexibility in what I could write .about.

The Interview Part 11 Continued from last week. H you missed the newspaper last weeJ<. for some unknown reason-, then you missed part orte ofan in· terview with Classics Professor Michael I. Magin II. In part one we found out all about Prof. Magin as a teacher and an educat()r. This week we dive deep into the social life of a professor. Now, I know that most of you out there are thinking to yourself \Professors don't have social lives!'~ Well Union professors do have lives, and so without further ado lure we go R.T.P- Prof. Maginwhat are some of the things that you like do in yo.ur spare time, when yau are not preparing for class or g;rading papers or tests? Prof. Magin- Well I persanally like ta travel. In the winter when we have off my wife and I ;go ski- • ing. This past break we we11tto ski in the French Alps. It was some of the best skiing that I have ever done. I also like to go to .the mov- ies every once in a while. Or just reading a good book is enough to make me happy. R.T.P• You mentioned your wife, would youmindtalkingabout her? Prof. Magin- Not at all. Her name is Alison, she teaches danc- ing over at Skidmore. R.T.P- How did you two meet? Prof. Magin- Well, back in 1987 I was out in Nevada, Las Vegas to be exact. There was a conference on the use ofmilitary strategy du.r- ing the Carthogian Wars. One night I was doing a little gambling, it was Las Vegas after all. I won big ... R.T.P-Ifyou don't mind me ask- ing what is won big? Prof. Magin- Close tg a million dollars. I was playing Baccarat, (Writers note: that is the game that James Bond 007 plays) I wanted to take a risk so I was playing at the players table and I won. It was one of the biggest shocks of my life. I mean I make plenty of money as a professor, but to win a million dollars in less than ten minutes is unbelievable. R.T.P- So, you won a million ~ dollars, was your future wife at the table? Is that where you met her? PrQf. Magin- No, I met her at a ...... Club. R.T.,P- Well then, you two are have been happily married now for nine years. Any children? Prof. Magin· No, no children but I.arn an uncle three times over. My sister has a little girl and my brother has two little boys. No kids for me now, but I do love my nephews and niece, very much. In this point in the interview his telephone rang and we need to stop. So next week the stunning con- clusion of the interview. . - ' . 'llrlyt C!!cmm-.bi.ett1ii~ ·February 5, 1998 ·Page 15 · Union's Academic Opportunity Program by Patrick Devonish Contributing Writer When I first arrived at Union over the summer, I met a group of peopl'e who were very unique and talented. They were people who came ftom urban towns and cities, and survived their setbacks in high school to get something that cer- . tain peopie dreamed of getting,. a college education. They are the Academic Opportunity Program's class of200 1, on a mission to come together and change the campus community. I observed and got along. with this group during the summer to take classes. They were bright, tal- . ented, and focused on what they were doing. While we were in h·igh school, some C!lffie from new schools, from overcro~ded schoo Is, and from some of the best. We survived the setbacks that we had to overcome to graduate and come to Union on a mission to change the campus and to be suc- cessful in the long run. At this point, some people are already living up to that mission. For example,. L'erin Davis has a show on WRUC called \Big Draws\ (Fridays 5-7 PM) who ·a line of clothing with the logo. Also, Jose Vargas(Latin Rhythms, Fridays 1-5 PM), Lanier Burwell, and Alana Beniot (Sultry Funk, Fridays 1-3 AM) also have shows on WRUC. Some of these students partici- pate in other activities also. For example, most ofus joined the Af- rican and Latino Alliance of Stu- dents in which we promote Afri- can and Latino Heritage around campus,. and some join other clubs like the National Society of Black Engineers, the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers, and Circulo Estudiantil Latino- Americano. But, we come together in times oftrouble and grief. -----,_------------------------------------1 with. Nicolson Jean-Francais play Also, we have teamwork and respect for one another. I remem- ber this past summer when we had to do a last minute skit to be played for a conference the next day while arguing for days about what we were going to do. Some people did not want to be part of it because of poor communication and ideas. But that day we came together, planned the skit, and the next day at the conference we were remark- able and everyone congratulated us. They will leave Union hope- fully with a sense that they accom- plished something and to go out into the world really prepared for a new life. I am fortunate that I am part of a group like this and I will look back twenty years from now remembering this and to feel proud that we accomplished a mission, a miss.ion to change the Union com- munity.

Once again there isn't too many major events happening this week so I will have to improvise. For the second straight week, I will start this column off by directing my attention to our nation's capital. This week I will try to lay off Bill Clinton's personal life. It is a lot of fun and it can take up an entite column but it isn't really fair to make fun of our nation's leader. Sure his whole family is ugly and he thinks with his pants but I will lay off him this week. What I will comment on, though, is his foreign policy, mainly concerning the current.situ- ation with Iraq. Instead ·of hiding behind his wife, he should take a stand and insteadofthreatening to attack Iraq, actually do it. He would look better if he just wiped that annoying country offthe map. I have heard many reasons why we haven't attacked them yet. One is that we do not have a strong enough military anymore to oblit- erate Iraq like we did during the Gulf War. So 1 have proposed an alternative plan so we can save lives but get Iraq to surrender peacefully at the same time. This plan is only dangerous to one group of people, the Iraqis. If we were to send Attorney General Janet Reno into Iraq, they would definitely surrender immediately. She's the most hideous looking thing I've seen in a long time. And I say thing, because I am not ex- actly sure what gender it is and if it fits in a specific gender category. Hillary isn't scared ofReno be- caus·e she knows that even Bill wouldn't touch her with a ten foot pole. But then again, he did get out of Whitewater and his host of other legal problems. Maybe he is ... nah. Well, so much for not bashing Billy Boy and his family. I am starting to get a bit fms- trated with the Jack of major par- ties going on at this campus the last couple of weeks. We just need a release. So if you have the re- sources to throw a good party, like Nike says, \just do it.\ I would like to end this article by paying tribute to a man that has meant so much to The Concordiensis. Outgoing editor Frank Rossi. This is his final pub- li.cation as editor. We are all grate- ful for his dedicated service to this fine publication that you read ev- ery week. Are there enough involved people to step into the giant shoes that Frank left behind? In the next few weeks, many of these ques- tions will be answered. He may be small in stature, but he is large in the amount of time, work, and dedication he gave to this paper. He will be missed by all.

Term Abroad Series Continues: Immersion in Japan by Stephanie Slobotkin News Editor '\Tadaima (I'm home) I yelled from the genkan, an area ina Japa- nese home where one is no longer outside, but not quite considered inside. My shoes do not slide off as easily as many of the Japanese, as they are often accustomed to wearing open backed shoes, slip- pers. and the like. My shoes are dirty, stick to my sweaty feet and resemble something used, some- thing unwanted and merely old. Had they been worn by a Japa- nese {hey WOJ.l.ld most likely re- semble the bright color in whiCh they were bought and undoubtedly he smaller in size. Mine looked tattered, worn, beaten and even the Nike symbol on the side, proudly exclaiming the epitome of Ameri- can merchandise was barely vis- ible. I placed my size 9 shoes next to the other slippers and loafers, feeling too big in foot size and aU too large for the 2x2 space that the genkan provided. It was my second day in Japan. I found that my identity spoke for itself. Maybe it was not so much national identity that caused me internal conflict, but simply the fact that I was so big and looke<l so very different. My long brown curly hair also contributed to my difference in identity. I am almost 5' 6\ and tower over the majority of Japanese. Ironically, however, these differences dissipated in time and the more American Girl I sa\\ in me, the more Japanese 1 be- came. It happened with my home- stay family over dinner, and since by Heath Fradkoff Staff Writer This is the one that got away, The picture I didn't take. In December, I worked at an in- ternship for the Museum of Con- temporary Art, Downtown San Diego. On De.cember tenth, I found myself outside the San Di- ego PubJic Library at 9:30, a half- hour before opening. I was th~r~ to do some research for the oat- reach program but seeing as 1 was too early, I had some time tokiU.I struck up a conversation with a: gentleman of about 25 years of age who was wearing a hat very simi- lar to the one I had just bought. ]a talking to him, I learned that his name was Brian Clark, he had just moved into the Reagal Hotel, and he had \left\ (been fired from) his job in telemarketing the day be- fore. As our banter progressed, we delved into topics such as the true meaning of success, of happiness, and the validity of higher educa- tion. I asked ifl couldjakehis pic- ture (he was leaning away from me with his hands on a parking meter and the light was beautiful) but he said he really didn't feel comfort- able with the idea. He hated being photographed. We continued talking. It always amazes me just how in-depth you can get with a complete stranger. Maybe it's easier that way. After all, if you've just met someone, especially if it's in a place you know you won't be for too long, you can certainly be liberal with then I have never been quite the same American I was when I left the stat<;!s in August. And that is to say; if l was ever really so American after all. I arrived home on the later side just in time for dinner. My otosan and okgsan{home-stay father and mother) sit on either side of me at the dinner table, low to-the ground where we knee 1 on thin pillows, in- stead of chairs. Immediately I am overly aware of the fact my legs . are too long and my knees will in- evitably be marked by the edge of · table. I am also aware that just moments after sitting in the tradi- tional Japanese style mr ankles become slightly tingly and I yearn for the Indian-style position or the . Romans' reClined way of dining.- · My .akasan first hands my otoscm . his pair of chopsticks and then hands mea slightly bigger pair, ex- plaining by means of elementary Japanese and charades that I am · ·'bigger' and might han~le the -wider wooden chopsticks with more . ease. 'from this moment I feel out of place. Not uncomfort- able with the family or even ner- vous or scared, but just too big. Americans don't like to be told they are anything but petite or beautiful. I am told neither here. I am only told I am big. With my big chopsticks in hand, which looked ridiculous in be.,. tween my large fingers, 1 only wished l could shrink, just a little bit to fit in with the petite perfec- tions that lay before me. My American .parents said they knew I had piano fingers from the rna~ ment I was born, apd since then, what you say. If you have no in- tention of impressing someone, it is a l~t easier to be open and hon- est with them. Anyway, as Brian went on, I uncapped the lens of my camera and took a light reading off the street. I intended to press him again for the picture and I figured if I had the shot all set up and could be quick, maybe he wouldn't get so bugged_out about it. As I worked the camera, a pale, over- weight, oppressive figure appeared behind me. This is when it got weird. The new gentleman (though I use the term loosely) told me that he worked for the govern- ment and couldn't be pho- tographed. He was wear- ing a short-sleeved shirt; jeans that hung on for dear life beneath the weight ·of a gigantic beer-gut, and a non- descript baseball hat above dark sunglasses. He was as much a gov- ernment official as my Dad is Wayne Gretzky. I began to explain that I', in fact, had no intention of photographing him. I couldn't even rationalize .wanting a picture of him unless I were doing an in-depth study of prime fat-farm candidates. The more I assured him I had no de- sire for his. picture, the more he seemed convinced I was lying. He started spewing out stories ofother photographers who had tried to photograph him on the street, how he had beaten them up, taken their even in America my hands are larger than most. So here,. in J.a- pan, in my smaU home, with an array of small plates before me, my big hands look foolish, .awkward and oh-so-un-Japanesque. Be- yond the food, which I try to grace• fully guide from the intricately decorated plates to my big Ameri- can mouth, l find that my family is intently staring in a comical type fashion. As latternptto pick up the small and slippery edamame or soy beans lam far from successful. At each attempt to grasp the pea-sized vegetable, upon dropping them my otosan cannot help but laugh and display the correct form of using chopsticks while eating beans. Additionally, holding the tea-cup I felt like Alice in Wonderland, drinking a potion from a tiny.cup and hoping it will make me smaller. However, the potion merely made me sleepy, preparing me for a good night's;rest in what I as- sumed would be a bed or futon. film, and pressed legal action. I told him that was complete bull be- cause pictures made in public places are covered under Public Domain. This basically states that if you end up in a picture taken in a pub lie place, there's little you can do about it because it was your choice to be there. This goes for movie star~, regular people, and angry beached whales like this guy. He wouldn't listen to me, though. Instead, Moby Dick .got right in my face and threatened to \beat the sh*t\ out of me if[ tried to take his picture. Once again, I smiled and assured hint I had no intention. He turned and walked back to where he had been stand- ing and resumed hitting on the two toothless women sitting by the door. Brian and I recommenced our conversation, this time talking about the paranoid whale that had just threatened me. Brian made sure that every crack was just loud enough for the gentleman to hear. I kept my camera uncapped and pointed over in Moby's direction To my utmost surprise I was for- tunate enough. to see a raised mat- tress, instead of the traditional tatamimat. · there was a comfort- able looking blanket and a pillow that looked ready to serve a pur- pose of a long night of dreams. To my dismay I slid into bed and dis- covered the true length of the mat• tress, or lack thereof My feet dangledoffthe edge and the fluffy comforter did not quite cover the bottom half of my calves tothetips ofmy toes. Furthermore, as I sank my head into the seemingly soft piUow I w~ shocked, to say the least, to hear a crunch instead of a silent familiar mush. The pillow was the size of a bean-bag and was stuffed with rice. So my big head lay on the small pillow while my long legs hung off the short bed. . But I was not unhappy. ThQugh I wished to be small, to fit into the realms .ofth is Japanese family and ~heir way of life, I realized that I am American and though I may be too big for their small world I would somehow fit in. This first night and possibly for the last time in Japan, I felt Ameri- can in my futon. With my dan- glingtoes, ,rny head burrowed in a rice pillow, the smell of incense my okasan burned for the dead pervaded my room and filled my nose. From that night on I came tomany vast realizations; I needed and desired to completely embrace the Japanese \Nay oflife in my long arms and extend my neck too see beyond and between the small and private lives I learned to live with, . grow with and eventually call my ·OWn. with my finger over the shutter- just to keep him edgy. He then shouted something over to me. He said that another reason he wouldn't be photographed was that it conflicted with his religious beliefs. This intrigued me and I ap- proached him. Moby went on to say that he was half Greek Orthodox and half Alaskan Indian. He showed me this silver ring he was wearing. It had been intricately carved with the symbol of an eagle and he said it '-Vas the symbol of a medicine man. At this point, Moby was just mak- ing stuff up off the top of his head, I'm sure, but 1 played along. I told him that I could sympathite with that. I said that I could ·understand the spiritual side of his desire to avoid pictures. I pointed out that he would have gotten me to comply much more easily if he had stated that particular view in- stead ()f oatright threatening me. I then asked him why he chose that route. Why resort to violence in an initial request? He said that's how he has always done things. I don't dol;lbt it. Some people seem to flip vio- lent tendencies on as casually as if they were light switches. Violence is never a good way to solve a problem and I have a hard time seeing the logic in trying to get your point across by threatening someone. If your first reaction to something is anger, you will only succeed in making the situation I eventually became somewhat Japanese over the weeks and months, and my initial American monstrosity was alleviated as I learned to tiptQe upstairs, eat beans slowly, rice methodically, and fish perfectly. In time it became diffi- cult to define myself as American. Though I looked different, bigger and taller I had become accus- tomed to the Japanese way of life and no longer knew or felt any strong bursts of Americanism aside from mydirtyNike's. At the time I wondered if fitting in so well in their eyes was a truth or an at- tempt on their part to make me feel welceme to their ways of life. I later discovered that there never a moment of falsity and we later learned to laugh - at everything, especially at my height and shoe size. In the midst .of my imrn~r­ sion in the Japanese culture I en- countered various differences that highlighted the American in me; I only felt too big, or too clumsy or too sloppy. \You big Americans,\ my okasan said laughing.. So I laughed too, knowing she meant not to insult me, but to be honest and make ligllt of the biggest dif- ference, besides language, in our two cultures that I experienced. I realized that I later did become smaller. My gestures became more discreet and I forgot about being American. If I ever had an American identity before I left for Japan, I do not remember. I only saw the American in me while in Japan when I innocently craved a queen size bed and fluffy-feather- down pillow. worse. This is common knowl- edge. It just frightens me at times when it seems rational communi- cation is the exception rather than the rule. A few minutes after I ended my conversation with Moby Dick, an- other gentleman approached me. He introduced himself as a retired professional photographer and he said that j\lloby had been full of crap- that what I wanted to do was covered under Public Domain and I should shoot all the pictures I want. Brian and I asked him ques- tions about his previous work and he went on to tell us about his job in the army photographing the Vietnam War. He used to ride above the firefights in a helicop- ter. Other soldiers in the chopper would be armed with their rifles and he only with his camera. He used to hear tbe bullets pierce the ann or of the chopper and was even wounded twice. I said that I couldn't imagine anything scarier. He said the scariest part was when he had to identity the broken body of his best friend and accompany the corpse home to the boy's mother. I would love to be able to tie all this together with some poignant social commentary but I fear it is all too much. Brian, the down-and- out young man; Moby Dick, the angry unchanging antagonist; and the old photographer, weathered by life; maybe they all speak for themselves. We had a whole por- trait ofhuma11ity outside the San Diego Public Library that day, and I didn't get a single picture.

• I' I Third Time's a Tie for Dutchmen After two previous losses, Mens Hockey finally gets points against RPI By Jonathan Gastllalter Editor-in..:Chlef When you take penalties, you limit your scoring chances. The Skating Dutchmen learned this two weeks ago whenthey took sixty-six minutes in penalties en route to a 7-2 loss to the RPI Engi- neers at Achilles Rink. Saturday night, the Dutchmen,. coming off of a 6-3 win against non-lea~ue opponent Army, faced nff against the Engineers at >the sold-out Houston Field House on the eve of the \Big Red Freak Out.\ The teams played just as physical as at Achilles, but there was one major difference- Union was more disci- plined, at least until the over1ime period. The Dutchmen came out ofthe gate flying, as Uniongot: four quicJ.<. shots on net including two from just off of the face-off by Jason Ra:Jph that RPI netminder Scott Prekaski snared with his glove. The Dutchmen continued to .main- tain solid pressure, as junior tri- captain f\1ark Szucs moved in on Prekaski. However, the RPI goalie remained solid andturned away the shot to add to his nineteen-save total for the period. TheEngineers got on the board first, scoring on the powerplay. Danny Riva got his first goal ofthe evening, knocking in the rebound of a Steve Caley shot. Down a goal going into the sec- ond stanza, the Dutchmen fought back to go up 2-1 early in the pe- riod.

Union's women's hock.ey team is at the point of the season where they are playing better then ever. Even though they fell to some very difficult varsity teams in the previ- ous weeks, Union has finally stepped up to the challenge and is showing the school what they are all about. Last Friday was a prime example of what to expect in tile coming years at Union when the team reaches the varsity level. The scene at Achilles Rink was unbe- lievable, as Union welcomed the Golden Knights .of Clarkson to Schenectady. With the biggest crowd of the season, l<Jud pump- up nii,!Sicblasting, and team alumni on hand, this was definitely going to be a long game for Clarkson, and it was. Once again, a few notable fans attended the game, especially Dean Alford and senior Shana Meyer, who was cheeri11g on sev- eral of her sorority sisters. Actually, Clarkson came out quite intimidating atfirst, With big- ger players and different types of warm -up drills then usual. Union responded to this threat by :Win- ing the opening face-offand domi- nating the overall action in the first period.

Women's Hoops Coming of Age Dutchwomen lose two out ofthree, but signs ofimpravementarenoticed by David Weiner Staff Writer As the saying gees, \practice makes perfect.\ While th;e girls basketball team was unable to im- prove their record much as they dropped two .of three this week, they were able to implement what they have learned in practice to continue on their upward r()ute to- wards success. Over tb>e past weeks, this team has made tremen- dous strides on defense, learning to pressure other teams well, to defend passing lanes, and t()> elimi- nate penetration. In doing so, the girls have added another dimen- sion to their ever-growing reper- toire. The final step· for this team, as their season slowly cQmes to a close, is to put all they have learned together and reach the potential that, in years to come, will allow them to be a terrific team. Unfortunately, this past week was not the week where every- thing came together as the team lost to both Hartwick and St. Lawrence sandwiched ar&und a victory over Clarkson. Hartwick 74- Union59 Coming into the first of a three game homestand, the Union girls were faced with a tough challenge. Their opponent, Hartwick College, holds an eight win and fiv-e loss record and is ranked eigth in New York State. Knowing this p()sed to be a tough task, the Union girls were looking for a solid effort both on the .offensive and defensive sides ofthe floor. Unfortuaately, they were only able to fmd the suc- cess they needed in the second half and thus, could not ptdl out the victory. Part of the Dutch women problems this season have come in sluggish begi11nings and stagnant finishes. ntis game was no different as Hartwick pulled out to a considerable lead part way through the first half and beldtheir lead through the conclusion of the game. Playing well for Union was Cap- tain Leah Olivieri who posted twenty eight points and nine re- bounds, leading all scorers in this game. Kathleen Furlong also put fourth a strong effort as she made numerous drives to the basket but was unfortunately unable to finish on some of those drives. All in all, Union bad a dismal day on offense, shooting a horrendous twenty-four for seventy-five from the floor. While the team held dose through the second half, they were unable torecover from their first half Til is- takes and this ultimately led totheir defeat. lJnion 67- Clarkson 62 This game took a completely dif- ferent path than the game versus Hartwick as Union adopted a new philosophy of how to begin a game in an up-tempo, concentrated man- ner and keep that concentration throughout the game. Coach Burt and her staff decided to begin the game in a full-court press, thus dic- tating the teams offense through their defense. This fast paced play allowed the girls to find the fast paced rhythm with which they like to run their offense. In doing so, · Union started four guards) thus giving up height for quickness, a gamble that ultimately paid off. With fiveminutes elapsed, the team then changed to a bigger lineup, thus '~dogging\ the middle of the paint and enabling Union to exploit Clal'kson 's inept perimeter shoot- ing. And finally, with just minutes remaining in the half, the team switched back to their small line- up and the fast, run the floor of· fense/pressure defense. This con- tinual change perplexed Clarkson and enabled Union to build a twelve pointhalftime lead, but more importantly, move past their lacka- daisical beginnings and conclu- sions. The low point for Union in this game was that their leader, Leah Olivieri, could not play as she was hospitalized due to a foot injury. The team's new game plan, along with strong, fundamental play from post players Beth Perry (21 points), Shawn McQuade, and Mindy Cohen allowed theDutchwomen to successfully carry out their game plan. As the final buzzer sounded, this Union team that was looking desperately for a win not only f()und their victory, but did so ,in a controlled, organized manner that left both players and coaches ex- tremely happy with the perfor- mance. St. Lawrence 76- Union 68 Facing a St. Lawrence team that had not lost to Union since 1994, the Union girls once again knew they faced a large challenge. Once again without their leader Leah Olivieri, this challenge felt even larger than it shQuld have been. Although every. player in a Gamet and White uniform .put forth val- iant efforts, Union was unable to overcome St. Lawrence's experi- en<:e and size. Because the game plan versus Clarkson worked nearly to perfec ... tion, Union decided to run the same 5 minute, 10 minute, 5 minute se- quence through the first half in hopes of gaining a lead and find- ing a rhythm. When these two teams were running the baH up and down the floor, trading baskets, and applying pressure, Unjon found quite a bit of success. Un- fortunately, without Olivieri, Union was forced to start Sarah D' Arcangelo, who normally plays guard, started at small forward. Thus, Beth Perry was the o11l)t'post player in the game, givin_g St. Lawrence a distinct height 4dvan- tage and clear rebounding ability. While Union gave up hei.gllt on defense, they also hoped this would pay off on offense as a St. Lawrence post player would be forced to step out and co0v.er D' Arcangelo, thus openi n~ up some outside shots as well CIS in- side layups. Although the ga111ble . did pay off in some instance5, St. Lawrence was u·ltimately a:b le to cover their weaknesses an<l take control of the game. Even with these many factors . playing agianst Union, the girls stuck in the game, always keeping within two to three points. How· ever, as the final minutes. ap· proached and each team fotJnd themselves on the foul line It10re, it was St. Lawrence who ca.lrnly buried their free points while U'njon struggled and this proved to b.e the difference in the end. · With eight games remai11in~ in their season, this team will \)egin to face many teams they have played·earlier in the season. As the team continues to work ()n new · philosophies as well as the funda· mentals they have stressed ttll sea- son, they soon hope to find suc- cess. Assistant coach David D' Agostino poignantly stilted, \We have been working on a,tlUm- ber of things in practice, espec illlly with the guards, and the git:ls are finally beginning to use in g!llUes what they learn in practice.. rhe entire team is extremely willing; to learn an:d if they continue to im- prove at the pace they have so far . this season, there is no telling'-Vbat · we may do in the future.'; It i~ tllis that motivates the team thi'DU.gh what has been a growing seasen and clearly, only they will dictate what does happen in the futu:re.

The weekend schedule usually con- sists of two Slalom races on Satur- day and two Giant Slalom races on Sunday. The racers get two runs and the winners are decided by the best total time for both runs. Be- cause of fraternity and sorority Rush, only four men and four women showed up this weekend to compete in the races. Even though Union was disappointed in its lackofnumbers, both the men's and women's teams were still vic- torious.

Every four years, athletes from around the world convene in the pre·detennined city to participate in the Olympics. This two week period of numerous athletic <:on- tests between countries is antici- pated by millions around the world and for many athletes, become the defining moments of their career. Another key aspect of the Olym- pics is that the athletes Wh{) par- ticipate are ·amateurs. They prac- tice their sports for hours on end not for money, hut for the love of their sport. The prizedOold medal, . at this time, is more important to them than the money that com.es with professionalsports. Unfortunately, in recent Olym- pics (namely the summer Olym- pics), prof('!ssional athl'etes ltave · been, aiJowed to participate. W11ile these athletes are the'best at tl1eir respective sports, I believe t:hey detract from the true meaning or the Olympics. Professionals should not be allowed to paJtici~ pate in the Olympics. When the United States com- piles their numerous \Dream Teams,\ they are great for public- ity and lam sure they create mil- lions of dollars in revenue for vari- ous companies, but is it really that entertaining to watch the United States basketball team trounce ev- eryone .of their opponents and by David Weiner post extremely lopsided scores? Sure; it broughf a tear to the eye when Larry Bird, Magic Johnson, • and the other \Dream Team I\ play- ers stood on the podium during the Gold medal ceremony in 1992, but was their any doubt that they would wiri the medal? Honestly, was there any opponent that posed a challenge for them? No. · This year, the winter Olympics are being held in Nagano, Japan, and commence on February sev- enth. Participating in those Olym- pic's will be .many players from the National Hockey League. For two weeks, the League is shutting it- self down to allow its \})'layers to return to their respective countries, join the National team, and com- · pete in Nagano. Is this really nec- essary? The Olympics have oc· curred J!lany, many times through· out the years and each time, every co\untry that participates has eas· ily filled their teain with qualified and determined amateur athletes. The requirement has always been that to participate, one must be an amateur. The Olympics are often the time when an athlete can truly show their talent in front of a world audience. These performances are what sometime lead to ptofessi()nal careers in people; s respective sports. While watching that Dream Team of I 992 walk their way to the Gold medal was somewhat entertaining, the 1988 Gold Medal game loss to the Russians by a team of college players was much more thrilling to watch even though the United States lost the game. That same year, in the Winter Olympics, the United States Olympic hockey team was comprised entirely of collegiate players, many of whom now play in the NHL. Before the Olympics, few people knew the names of any players on this team. ·.While the US was unable to bring home a medal as they lost to Cze~boslovak.ia: in .the Bronze medal game; the entire Un·ited States puUed for their team and they battledtheirwaythrough each round ofthe grue,ling comp:etition. This was exciting to watch. By allowing proftissional ath- letes to complete in the Olympi~s, some of the glamour is taken away from the athletic spectacle known as the Olympics, but on a larger scale; the opportunity for amateur athletes to shine is shattered. Olym- pic competition thrQughout the yeats has been exciting and capti- vating. There is no need for pro- fessional athletes in the Olympics, so tell the professionals to keep their greed solely concerned with money and leave the medals to the amateurs who are· driven by desire. Undefeated Nc More Of the 308'Division leo liege basketball teams, two, Stanford and Utah, entered the week undefeated. Both teams faltered and joined the other 306 schools in the loss column. hi the match up .of the week, Stanford got man handled by aqukker, ll]Ore athletic Arizona team. The Cardinals let Arizorla {19-3, 9-'0 conf.) dictate the pace of the game and could no1 ·keep up witb their high powered offense. To compound their athletic disadvantage, Stanford center Tim Young was in foul trouble most of the second llalf, forcing them to play without their main inside scoring threat. Mike Bibby and Michael Dickerson each scored 26 points as Arizona broke Stanford's record 20 game home winning streak and handed them their first loss ofthe season. The dejected Cardinals hosted Ari- zona State on Saturday as they looked to prove they weren't as bad as Arizona had led many to believe. However, that other school from Ari- zona handed Stanford their second loss in three days, this one in over- time. Jeremy Veal had a tremendous game for the Sun Devils ( 14-8 4-5 con f.), scoring 27 points, 8 of which came in overtime. The victory was ASU's first againsta:ranked opponent since March II, 1995 when they coincidentally beat Arizona. This is a week Stanford would much rather forget, but they must continue to play well if they are to prevent a downward spiral. This coming week they visitS torrs, CT to take on 7th ranked Uconn Huskies. Utah visited New Mexico (16-3 6-1 WAC) on Sunday and joined the defeated in a slightly better fashion than Stanford. New Mexico's 3 7 consecutive home victories are second to only Kansas and they did everything in their power to keep the streak alive. Utah led 73-67 with 1:27 remaining, but the Lobos Royce Olney drained three three's in the final 1 :27 to bury the Utes'. Utah shot 6 I percent from the field and got a solid game from point guard Andre Miller (22pts), butthe Lobo's were too much to handle at home. Utah should learn from Stanford's mistake and play their next game like they are still undefeated in order to avoid a let down. Dllke Living up to Expectations Quite frankly, I was sick'ofhearing and reading about how Duke's freshman class was going to retumthem to the final four. I wanted to see them actually play before I gave them my accolades. Afterall, a few questions still lingered. For .instance, how was coa.ch Mike Krzyzewski going to satisfy their demands for playing time and would the younger players gel with the returning players? It's safe to say these questions and others have been answered. Duke's most high,ly touted recruit, Elton Brand, started the season on fire and was leading the team in scoring and rebounding., but he broke his foot and will have to sit out the remainder of the season. Duke's other freshmen, William Avery, Chris Burgess, and Shane Ba.tti.er, have meshed superbly with the other Blue Devel's and have he.lped lead them to the top spot in the polls. Duke is led by All-American candidate Trajon Langdon who is averaging 14.1ppg, butgets c.:,mtributions from all ends. Eight players are averag- ing over 7.5 ppg and their have been no disputes about playing time or who the go to guy is. The team has blended meshed well and has destroyed virtually allcompetition, Their one blemish came atthehands ofMichigan wl1ere they blew a 19 point lead. Duke (20-1, 9-0 ACC) is off to their best start in conference ~ince the 1963-64 season when they start€d I 0-0. At this point in the season Duke looks m1stoppable and anything less than the final four would be a disappointment. Duke will be severely tested when they visit North Carolina this Thursday. Player of the Week Nazr Mohammed C Kentucky Mohammed is the only thing that prevented the Wildcats from losing twice this week Mohammed banked in a shot in the closing seconds to give Kentucky the victory over Vanderbilt 63-61 on Wednesday. Ken- tucky went on to lose Sunday to Florida, but had it not been for Mohammed they would have dropped~ut of the top ten.

Shoeless Joe Comes t:o U\ n.ion by Chris Leone Sports Editor Do you think that Shoeless Joe Jackson could stop by and visit Union on his way to Co()perstown and the Major Le<ague Base- ballHall ofFame? If you believe in the movie Fie hi of Dreams, and I do, than llll!ything is possible, even Joe Jackson getting inducted intbeHall. L~t week a story was repot:ted that Hall ofFrumer's Ted Williams and BobFeller were actively pushing ·acting Commissioner Bud Selig, to allow for Jackson to be i11ducted. In 192:1 ,Jackson, who holds the third highest career batting average, was one of eight Chicago White Sox members that were barred from baseball for life for their involvement in the fbdng of the I~ 19 World Series. For those who are unaware of the scan- dal, the briefhistory has alleged that Am old Rothstein, a fam()us Boston gambler, paid eight White Sox players, including Jackson, $10,~00 dollars a piece to lose ,the series. Afttr playing the 1920 season, all eight of the players were suspended, by then com- missioner Judge Kennisaw Mountain Landii.s, for conduct detrimentalt() the game of baseball. Se why does Shoeless Joe belorng in the HallofFame? Simply answered~ \)ecause he may llave been the best outfielder to play during the 1910's. Yes, possiblybetterthan the great Ty Cobb, who called Jackson, \the greatest natural hitter I ever saw.\ Wllile the suspensions may have been justiffied, it has never been proven that Jack- son did not play to t'lis full potential during · the serries. He batted .375, drove in .six runs, hit three doubles, and hit tile only home run of the series. Unlike many of his counter- pans, Jackson committed no errors and has never been cited for not IJlaying any pos- sible ball hitto left field. For those who argue tnat a series does not make a career, they just need to look at Jackson's numbers. Over his 13 seasons in the big leagues, Jackson hit .356, had 1774 hitsandonJy struck out 158 times. Jackson's averaged nearly 1.5 hits per game, and had an on base average of .416. Despite playing far less than others in his generation, Jack- son stats speak volumes. The great play on the field is only part of Jackson's legend. The stories of his begin- nings gave inspiration to thousands of kids that they too could play the national pas- time. While other players in his day, such as Cobb, were lawbreakers and scandal mak- ers, Jackson played the game he loved with pride. There are no stories of him berating fans or running with notorious characters. Ignorance is not an excuse for mistakes, However, if does allow for a b~tter under- standing of Jackson's mentality~ Bom ·ifi ru- ral South Carolina, it has been stated that Jackson was i !literate and signed his name to his first corrtract with an \x.\ As a young outfielder in the Cleveland; Indians organi- zation, he initially r.efused to come to the major leagues because he was scared of the crowds and the big time. Only after the Indi- ans sixth attempt did Jackson come to the pros to stay. I believe in baseball legends and subse- quently the great Shoeless Joe. In a day and age where sports legends are a rarity, and fallen heroes are either arrested or in court, it would be right to praise legends of the past. Inducting Jackson into othe Hall would be the right move for a country of scorned baseball fans, and most importantly for the game. Williams may have said it best.Iast week, \he has served his sentence. How severely does a person have to be punished? It was a lifetime ban and his life is over.\ *' *' *' * * \I ant going to give upgiLIIibling ... as soon as I break even.\ Well, I blew the U dollars last week. Ac- cording Doug Schneider, Urrion was an un- derdog and with the tieactually won. I can't catch a break. The deficit is atanatr!Ocious 145 U's. This week, it's double or nothing on Michael Jordan. Who cares who MJ is playing against? I figure he will be mad after the · Sunday debacle at the Forum and drop a double nickel somewh~re. ' This will be the last issue for editor Frank Rossi. Wbile l may not have always agreed with Frank, I will say be is.a good person who worked hard for the ,paper and will be sorely missed. When l first met'Frank, he was a sports re.porter and. became sports editor after I took some titne away from school. He used to teH me how he knew nothing about newspaJ>ers and then would always be late witJl his deadlines. Something's never changed. Good luck to you, Frank, in all your future ~ndeavors. As you once said, \a p.Ja\e at a computer will always be reserved for :you.\ . In other news ... less than ten days remain until pitchers and catchers report for spring training. I am curious t(} see how Hideki \I- robbed-u\ looks. Last y.ear he was the J apa- nese version of Gilbert Brow11. He was big and could only last half the game. I would like a well-writtrm letter from an intelligent student to r~sprmd to the ques-. tion if Union needs a new hockey rink. A decent submission will appear in place of my column next week. -Q ._ :.a~::;t:. . : -e-.-:,Sp,otligb·t~- ~ .· -. i1 :io~ok ~t Non~·~~~~.fiftFii~#:r~;·~-iifiiJ;(~:t:lit~iei :·-_ . , .- ··-- \·-- ., - -. - ..

Page 26 • Febt·uary 5~ 1998 • 'QI~t ((J:.:,ntu·drien~ill Sports ShoelessJoe Comes t:o Union IJy Chris Leone !;p(}r/s Editor Do you think that Shoeless Joe Jackson could stop by and visit Union on his way to Cooperstown a11d the Major League Base- ball Hall of Fame'? I fyou believe in the movie Field of Dreams, and I do, than anything is possible, even Joe Jackson getting inducted in the Hall. Last week a story was reported that Hall ofFamer's Ted Williams and Bob Feller were actively pushing acting Commissioner Bud Selig to allow f()r Jackson to be inducted. In I 921 , Jackson. ·who holds the third h ighcst career batting, average, was one of eight Chicago White S.o:xmembers that were barred from baseball fori ife for their involvement in the fixing ofthe 1919 World Series. For those wh<> are unaware of the scan- dal, the briefhistory has alleged that Arnold Rothstein, a famous Boston gambler. paid eight White Sox players, including Jackson, $10,000 dollars a piece to lose the series. After playing tlu l 920 season, all eight of the players were suspended, by then com- missioner Judge Kenn isaw Mountain Landis, for conduct detrimental to the game of baseball. So why does Shoeless Joe belong in the Hall of Fame? Simply answered, because he may have been the best outfielder to play during the 19J()'s. Yes, possibly better than the great Ty Col>b, who called Jackson, \the greatest natural hitter I ever saw.\ While the suspensions may have been justified, it has never been proven that Jack- son did not play to his full potential during the series.

Unlike many of his counter- parts, Jackson committed no errors and has never been cited for not playing any pos- sible ball hit to left field. For those who argue that a series does not make a career, they just need to look at Jackson's numbers. Over his 13 seasons in the big leagues, Jackson hit .356, had 1774 hits and only struck out 158 times. Jackson's averaged nearly 1.5 hits per game, and had an on base average of .416. Despite playing far less than others in his generation, Jack- son slats speak volumes. The great play on the field is only part of Jackson's legend. The stories ofhis begin- nings gave inspiration to thousands of kids that they too could play the national pas- time. While other players in his day, such as Cobb, were lawbreakers and scandal mak- ers, Jackson played the game he loved with pride. There are no stories of him berating fans or running with notorious characters. Ignorance is not an excuse form istakes. However, it does allow for a better under- standing of Jackson's mentality. Born in ru- ral South Carolina, it has been stated that Jackson was illiterate and signed his name to his first contract with an \x.\ As a young outfielder in the Cleveland Indians <>rgani- zation, he initially refused to come to the major leagues because he was scared of the crowds and the big time.

A Look at Non- Varsity Sports and Athletes By Pike Mody If you are J()()!\Lng for one of Union's most successful athletes, you won't fmd them at a bar every Friday or Saturday night, drinking the night away. Although this athlete goes to the gym everyday~ Union's facility is not where they lift. You won't fmd them adorned ina team jacket strutting around campus or shouting out against or for Greek rights. If my guess is correct~ the majority of you will say \Who'?\ when I drop this athlete's name. Where you wi!l fwd her, and yes I did say her, on a Friday night is in the Thurber Room, working on her thesis like mad so she can graduate early in March and head on to an intemship and then a Ph.D. program in some specialty of marine biology. Although this tenn is the first time since she has been at Union that she hasn't played a sport. no watch or blanket with a large U on it will be headed her way at the Block U dinner this spring. That is why this week.,s article is dedicated to one ofUnion's most successful and quiet athletes, known to the col lege as Sara Gower. She began her career here as soccer player, making the varsity squad her freshman year, before falling victim to a hip injury that would prevent her from playing a lot of the season. From there she dove into women's basketball, where she quickly found herself starting at point guard. A iter a tough 3-and-something-no-one-wants-to-remember season, she was lead to the rug\y pitch by then sophomore and basketball teammate, Jennifer Lelas. Under the assumption iliutt it would keep her in shape for soccer in the com~g fall, Gower began a career that may be the most successful in the 13 year history of the women's club, if not the 32 year history of organized rugby at Union College, Her stats are unbelievable, although no one knows what they are for sure. Being that women's rugby is a club sport, staticians are nllt a fringe that club can indulge in. Playing both serum-half and fly-half, .Gower has managed to tally what most coaches agree is more points than ever scored by a member of the ~omen's club. To add to her enonnous amount of tries ( 5 points a piece), she also handles all ()[tile team's kicking, which nets her both 2 point PATs and 3 point field goals. She is note<! around the league for her blinding speed and quickness, aggressive competitiveness, and hard working attitude. It has given her much notoriety in the rugby community. St. Lawrence coach Kelly Davis was quoted as saying \If you can stop #9 [Gower], you can stop Union.\ Her own part-tin1e coach, Dave Johnson, a US National Sevens team merrnb-er himself said \If! had 14 more just like her, we'd be on the international circuit.'' Why i.sn' t she then is the question. I Although she excelled very quickly from the start, Sara faced a problem that many !women face in not only rugby, but in women's athletics, an organized process to pick aU- 1 1stars. It took until Lhe fall of her junior ye~r for there to be a women's all~s~a:team f~rm~­ lated, and she was, of course, one of the maugural members. After a trammg session rn Rochester, NY, the site of the decade and-a-half old men's East-West all-star game, she and three other Uni()n women were invited to Amherst, MA to play for New York State's ' travelling all~strus. Afte~ setting the pace of play for both t~ams once again, she drilled ~er 11ame finnly mt() tile scnpt of the first ever Northeast National Women's all-stars, wh1ch competed in the larg.est rugby tournament on the East Coast. Known to the rugby world only as \CanwA.m\ the Saranac Lake Canada-America International Rugby Tournament k.icks off every ye.ar in the first weekend of August. Limitea to 1 io teams in four divisions, Men's Club A, Men's ClubB, Old Boys(Over40), and Women, the.Ciut~Am tourney allows spectators a chance to see some of the best 15 man/woman rugby in the country, as well as a World Cup Seven•s match between Canada and the United States. Under the name \Babylon\ the Nt»rth East Rugby Union enters collegiate tnen's and women--steams into the tournament where the· will most likely . lay the best com etition most layers b.ave ever faced. This year was no exception. Babylon faced Beantown, who is always in the fmal four in the US National Women's Championship~ Although Babylon suffered a good beating, they did manage to impress a number of opposing players, most of whom I would adrn ittedly run away from during a game. · Most importantly, Northeast all-star's coach, Tom Milner, mentioned that Beantown was not only impressed with Gower's talents and attitude, but would like for her to play with them after she graduates this year. Milner stated ''For someone as good as Sara, this is a great opportunity to go a long way in a sport that doesn't get the recognition it rea! ly deserves. This is the perfect example of a college kid defying every stereotype that people have about rugby players and making it to the top from a program that is fairly young.\ If she is such an amazing athlete, where is the watch and blanket with the Bi.g ''U'' on it, right'? So, here we are, a Union College athlete making it to the top of her sport, just as it is evolving to let her do so, even if it is considered club. What happened to soccer and basketball? At first not willing to give up soccer, a summer stint with Mono and then CFS (Chronic Fatigue Syndrome), left her unable to train for and hence compete for Union soccer in the fall of her sophomore year. After taking the reins for rugby that fall, she had no reason to go back. That still leaves basketball. Poised for entry into the state champi- onship tournament in the fall of 199 5, Sara was asked to make a tough decisi<Jn. The last game of the regular seaso:n fell during the beginning o,f the pre-season for basketbalL Alth<Jugh it was basketball team policy that any athlete that is competing in the fall for a varsity team is exempted from pre-season training, rugby is not a varsity sport and is in the athletic department's eyes, inferior. Sara was told if she played in the game, she was no longer part of the basketball team. Being tom between the two, Sara debated and finally picked basketball. Without their leading scorer, Union won their last game, but being tied in the league with SUNY Albany, Uni()n had scored l p<>int fewer and was denied entry to the tournament. The difference was a 2 point PAT that was missed in the last game. The following year, the same ultimatum was levied by the coach. end your rugby season early or don ~t plan on playing basketball for Union. That fall she decided rugby was more impo-rtant and she made the all~star team. I really guess that what we should all get out of this atiicle is two things. The first is that you don't have to be a varsity athlete to be one of the most successful in the entire school (who else can claim to be offered a spot on a top national team after they graduate. I don't hear Denver or Green Bay calling%). Second, and most important, why was this woman denied the opportunity to play basketball? The answer is because people have stereo- typed rugby as a drunkard's sport. I pose this question then, how many individuals from the athletic department have ever made a single game played by either rugby team? Is it possible for people to take the stereotypes of rugby players that they had during their college years and attribute them to all the players that are playing now? I guess so because that is what is happening. Union College and USA Rugby have made great strides, espe- cially since my fi·eshman year, to make collegiate rugby some of the most competitive in the world, with the old emphasis \0~5 on the field; 5·0 in the barroom\ long since disintegrated. Yes, lam afraid that was how things used to be, but its not 1972 anymore. lfyou play with that mentality you won't survive long, and I think everyone likes it that way. Now, I am not calling for an end to the NCAA empite, and the establishment of rugby as our national pastillle. Can someone explain to me why a woman who has risen to the pilmacle of her sport at the Division I level (definition ()fBeantown Rugby Club) was and is disallowed to miss ~. e·season basketball ractice because she doesn~t lay in a \reO;\l s ()rt?'~ . - .

Funded by Student Activili es, the event was organized by six Prograrn Assis.- tants: seni0rs Stacey Drossman and I<enley Smith,junior Tom Marino, and sophm!Tlores Andy Markowski, Liz Schmitt, and 'rv:lichael Winn. The large turnout for eacil of the carnival's events sent out the message that Union students can still enjoy thenselves during a dry weekend. The weekend began with Friday's Cas in() Night, held in Old Chapel and Hale llollse. Over three hundred students showed up t<J gamble during the course of the C\iolet1i11g. Tables were set up, at which Student Forum members were stationed as dealers. Students were given chips with which to pl~c:e bets, and those who had a lucky hand vve~egi.ven raffle tickets. At the end \of the (JVetling, names were drawn and several priz:es, in- cluding a cordless telephone, a portai:Jl~ CD player and a color television were rafffl ed. \Casino Night\ (upper left), According to Pmgram Assistant Uz Schmitt, the night surpassed Stud~nt Ac- tivities' expectations, and was well V\lorth the extensive preparations. \We\v•e been working for two weeks straight 'rWith()ut sleeping,\ she explained. \We were de:i:iuitely worried about the [response], since tl'le cam- pus is dry this weekend. But we're really happy with the way it turned out\ Junior Class President Tom Marino• V()iced similar sentiments. \We had some d ifficul- ties organizing it because the administration wouldn't Jet us go with the compa11y we had originally wanted,\ he said. ' 1 We btd to go with a last minute decision, and fortimately it turned out well. It's a really positi . that's happened here.

Textbooks of the' American past have various strands and we need to deal with selective things because of space.\ Okihiro said. \We need to comprom1s.e, to frac- ture narratives with different posi- tions from the past.\ He also told a series of stories ranging from poetic perceptions of the transcontinental railroad to in- dividual experiences of Asians who are like ghosts, \and don't leave footprints in the sand,\ .Okihi:ro said. He talked of how en- tire peoples, minorities in particu- lar want to feel included because of the American promise and the American dream. However, he says they often go unseen. Okihiro made a point to display the fact that Asians have made their mark on American soil; from Japan to Vietnam and from Madonna;s n.ewest video to Fendi's perfume called Asia. Okibiro claims, \Asians didn't come to America- America went to Asia.\ American history was the f<Jvlis ofOkihiro.'s main points. He spl)ke of how Asian Americans Settled in North America even before the birth oftheAmerican nations. He further proved Asians \right\ to the land by pointing out that America had great desires for Asian products.

Campus News FIJI Changes National Alcohol Policy Follows Phi Delta Theta as Second Fraternity on Campus to go Dry by Aa.kasll Agarwala Contributing Writer The Phi Gamma Delta Interna- tional Fraternity, better known as FIJI has decided to implement sub- stance free housing as of July 1, 2000. The decision to go sub- stance free was made by the inter- national board, and was an- noumced 011 October 2, 1 997. It will affect all 125 Phi Gamma Delta chap· ters, including those in Canada With this \'substance-free\ policy, eacliJ chapter will no longer be rec- ognized under a national insurance policy in regards to alcohol con- sumption. \Alcohol has. too much influ- ence on today's college students and our members,\ said Douglas H. Dittrick, presidentofPhi Gamma. Delta's governing board. \We must take action against it.\ As would be expected, the policr was not taken well by many of the: fraternity chapters throughout the: nation, as some of these chapters sent angry letters and deactivatio11 threats to the Internationals. Ed Dombroski, a member of the alcohol awareness committee ofPh1 Gamma Delta here at Union, and correspondent between the schoo I and the fraternity confirmed thai there has been a lot of negative feedback from brothers all over the nation. He feels that the decision has been made prematurely. \I knoV't' there has been a lot of debate a:S far as brothers both nationally and internationally,\ said Dombroski. \It is an iss11e that has come to a decision without as much thougbt as shoul<l have been given to it.'' FIJI is currently in the process of deciding how exactly they are going to enforce the alcohol polic,, but has been unable to reach agreement on a proper method of implementation. President of FIJI at Union, Craig Kazmierczak, stated that the iater- nity is still in discussions with its national about the future of par- ties. \Thingsareunsureasofnow and we still have to talk about our possible options,\ he said. The national chapter of ~he fra- ternity has chosen to stick by their decision despite the outcry made by many of their collegiate ct.!ap- ters. \The board made the policy,\ said Bill Martin, Director of Phi Gamma Delta International Frater- nity. \It believes it is in the best interests of the frat em ity.\ According to Martin, significant numbers of parents showed sup- port for the motion for substance- free housing. He stated that they (the FIJI Ilational fraternity) had re- ceived hundreds of letters from parents. Recently at MIT, a student named Scott Kreuger, who was pledging FIJI died of alcohol over- dose. The plans to go alcohol free were made before the student's death, and the delay period before which the policy change will go into effect has been provided for the fraternities to adjust to the changes. With the pledging process grow- ing near, there has been sorne con- cern with regards to how this change in policy may affect stu- dents.' willingness to j.oin Phi Gamma Delta. Dombroski believes that the lack of alcohol will make no change in the desire of stu- dents to join the fraternity. \I think that the change in our alcohol policy will have no effect on students who wish to pledge our fraternity,\ said Dombroski. \Students choose the our house because of the brotherhood that exists here.\ Union freshman David Andrews remarked on the matter. \This is no doubt, the time for people to enjoy themselves, by having par- ties and drinking,\ said Andrews. \It is an option open to us, simply becaase there is so little else to do on campus. If by getting rid of the alcohol, other activities were pro- moted, I would be for it.\ Many of the other students not affiliated with the Greek system questioned, tended to support the standpoint of Andrews, bringing out once again the lack of alterna- tive enjoyable activities available for students on campus. ,. Members of the Fraternity itself are opposed to the constraints placed on them by the national level. \The people at the national level made this decision to disassociate themselves from the idea of drink- ing, by making a decision that af- fects us negatively and improves their images,\ said Steven Borer, a junior member ofFIJ I. \Their deci- sion has simply aroused anger. We are mature enough to make our own decisions, and to have alcohol within the house.\ If the decision made by the In- ternational board remains effective, then FIJI will be the second frater- nity on campus to go substance free, the first being Phi Delta Theta. \We wish we could eliminate the prob !em [excessive alcohol con- sumption] by edict,\ said Dittrick. \We hope many chapters will act . quickly.\ The board may provide incen- . tives for chapters that decide to become alcohol tree earlier than the marked deadline. 'There is still a lot of discussion left on this matter between the na- tionals and our house before any- thing becomes final,\ said Dombroski. \This is by no means a dead issue.\ \W·hose History Is It Anyway?\ .. continued common or foreign. He reiterated the title of his lecture, \Whose History Is It Anyway?,\ ma11y times emphasizing that he does n<lt take it seriously. Okihiro touched upon the need to change tile views written in his- tory books. \It should begin at tlhe start. Textbooks of the American past have various strands and V'-le need to deal with selective thin:gs because <lf space.\ Okihiro said. \We need to compromise, to fr1tc- ture narratives with different posi- t ions fr<Jm tile past.\ He also told a series of stories ranging fi·olll poetic perceptions of the transco!tli nental railroad to in- dividual ex.periences of Asia.ns who are like ghosts, \and don't leave footprints in the sand,\ Okihiro said. He talked ofhowen- tire peoples, rn inorities in particu- lar want to feel included because of the American promise and the American dream. However, he says tlley often go unseen. Okibiro made a point to display the fact that Asians have made their mark on American soil, fr()m Japan to Vietnam and frl)m Madonna's newest video to Fendi 's perfume called Asia. Okihim claims, \Asians ditln 't come to America- America went to Asia.\ American history was the focus ofOkihiro's main points. He spoke of how Asian Americans settled in North America even before the birth of the American nations. He further proved Asians \right\ to the land by pointing out that America had great desires for Asian products. The markets kept American fields growing and pros- perous, leaving no skepticism about the idea that Asian influence was necessary in America. Okihiro talked about the hard- shipsofDavid Mallo,Maria Wong, Tiona Connie, and others. Though each story he spoke of had a glimpse of a personal struggle, Okihiro made it clear that each ex- perience was one that either sup- ported education, women's libera- tion or human diversity. \By telling stories about the oppressed individuals, Okihiro fur- ther amplified the core ideals of America and made good points about how everyone in America would like to believe in the Ameri- can dream,\ said junior Lindsay Schwartz. In summation Okihiro said that his stories are what \keep the dream alive. We Asian Ameri- cans, after years and years, be- long here. There are a range of nation's builders and we are all part of it, but blinded.\ 111 a question/answer session that followed Okihiro touched upon language and suggested it is a means by which to resist Americanization. He also com- mented on his advocacy of a bi- lingual education and said, \soci- ety can and should sustain that ideal.\ \'Okihiro seemed knowledge- able on the subject of Asian American history and the flow of his speech kept me interested,\ said junior Evan L. Morris. Okihiro is the author of several award-winning books on Asian American history and has built Asian American Studies pro- grams at Cornell University and elsewhere. Okihiro is editor of the Journal of Asian American Stud- ies and has served as president of the Association of Asian American Studies. Okihiro addressed larger ques- tions of ethnicity and gender in America. His lecture examined the nature of history and the place of Asians in American history.

Page 4:• C ampus Steven M. Schuler In filling the vacated position of Vice President ofCai!lpus Life I will ensure that Union is a fun yet safe place for aU students_ In obtaining this position I will be an advocate for students who do not want their social life diluted as the result of the mistakes of the irresponsible. I want to avoid the underground drinking that would rest1lt on a perma- nently dry campus. I also want to protect students from having to drive, dangerously, off campus to drink. The campus needs more weekend alterna- tives to drinking before parties; such as small bands. This would de- crease some students drinking, and avoid Ellis trips that c()uld further curb freedoms for the whole campus. I wi:JL also keep patties open for independents. There is a policy proposal right now that would close parities to all, but mem- bers of the Greek house that throws it. This would result in a large portion of the campus being cut off. This can not happen; it is unfair to the people who choose to be independent. At the small liberal arts school Connecticut College, the majority of campus parties Fesemble this past weekends Wiater\-Fest an open theme party at a campus center, but with provided alcohol for all stu- dents and a police presence, I will not allow this to iJe Union's fate. Winter-Fest is a fun activity and a good break, but sh()uld not be our only type of social option. In voting tomorrow look for someone not in the system, so much has aJready been conceded and s<:arce new op- tions have been proposed, look for fresh views that will help make Union a fun yet safe place for everyone.

Sincerely, Brian Roache Global Climate Change Series • by Sbaun P. Montana Staff Writer Throughout February, the Envi- ronmental Studies Program is host- ing a four-part seminar series on global climate change. The series will highlight the advances in un- derstanding various aspects of cli- mate change, but also wiH address the increasing public awarene;ssof this issue. Talks are being pres.ented by Union College professorswho are involved in aspects of climate change in their scholarship. \The planet is warrningup, carbon diox- ide levels are increasing, sea level is rising. These are facts, but do we need to worry? Is there any- thing we can do? Are humans causing global warming, or is the change natural?\ Professor John Garver, director ofthe Environmen- tal Stmlies Program, raises these questions. \The important ques~ tion,\ Professor Garver continues, \is whether human impacts have· driven the most recent changes. On this front, the scientific com- munity is divided.\ The series at- tempts to answer these questions and present different aspects of the results of global climate change. The,first presentation was given last Thursday evening in the Col- lege Center Auditorium by Profes- sor Jonathan Marr of the Physics Department. Entitled \The Deter- mining Factors of Planetary Surface Temperatures: A Comparison Be- tween the Greenhouse Effect on Earth and Venus,\ Marr' s hour lec- ture focused on potential similari- ties between the Earth and our near- est planetary neighbor, Venus. At- tended by about forty members of the college community, equally di- vided between faculty and stu- dents, Marr presented a lively and entertaining discourse. H~ started with a discussion of the basic tem- peratures which affect planetary surface temperature. Using a setup of stands, a !_amp to represent the sun, a beach ball to represent Ve- nus, a globe for Earth, and two smaller balls for Mercury and the Moon, Marr showed how· some energy radiating from the sun hits planets but sCJmea!so misses them. Solar radiati()n is only one of the factors affecting planetary surface temperature, accordifrgto Marr. He further explained that size and dis- tance from tlte sun aJso were fac- tors. With assistance from Garver, Marr useq an a~etylene torch and a copper wire to demonstrate how, upon heating, a body will absorb some heat but will a1so radiate heat in an attempt to ceO! of(. Most of this energy is in the infrared spec- trum, which means it has slightly less energy than the visible light human .eyes can see. As each planet is heated by the sun, Marr explained, .itgivesoff energy in the fonn ofinfrared:Fadiation. On Earth ~and Venus, portions of this radia- tion are real>sorbed by the atmo- sphere. Carb<lll dbxide, Marr said, is one ofthe most efficient absorb· ers of infrare<l radiation. This cycle ofradiation and reab- sorption is what forms the green- house effect. Using slides, Marr explained the basics of the effect. He stressed that the greenhouse effect is a natural occurrence and is actually very necessary to life on the planet. According to scien• tific calculatio11s,the average tem- perature oJ the: Earth's surface should be -16.6(F, much too low to support life. With the greenhouse effect, the Earth's actual average surface temperature is 46.4(F, ca- pable of SllJ)'porting life. Accord- ing to Marr, tile potential danger we face is that by releasing too much carbo11 ~i.oxide into the at- mosphere, the greenhouse effect will be muchgteater, as it is on Ve- nus. There, with an atmosphere consisting <>f96°/() carbon dioxide, the actual a\Verage temperature is 878(F highertba:n what calculations say it should be!) Currently the Earth's atmsp.bere is mostly nitro- gen and QXyg.en, so it is not very probable that it could increase to 96% carb()ll dioxide. By burning all the fossil ftJeJs that are currently . found on Ecntll, Professor Marr in- dicated that tllis would only result in a seven t() e.lght percent increase in the amount ofcarbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Marr stated, \A common argllment against global wanning isthat, if you look at plan- etary hist()ry,thetemperature of the Earth has fluctuated over time. Fou:r to five hundred years ago,. it was one or two d'egrees colder than it currently is.\ The current increase i1;1 global temperature may be nothing more than a natural oc- Ctltrence in the long life cycle of the Earth. Marrconcludedl!is iec- . tttre by showing a slide that sltowed the correlation between tn e amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. and average global surface temperature. The graph indicated a dose relations]:rip be- tween the two, and contained an extrapolation that showed a large increase :both in carbon di<Jxide and average global surface tem- perature. The extrapolati~n was done accordingto,current amounts ofexc.ess carbon dioxide released i11tothe atmosphere. \To me,\ Marr concluded, \the scare is n<lt what has happened or what is happen- ingnGW, but what might happen cin the future.\ Following the lecture, M:arrtook questions from the ~audience. Many faculty members del>ated the .p{)tential affects of increased lev- els of carbon dioxide in the atmo- S(lhere. Professor Lestie Hall of the Chemistry Department ques- tioned if We should be co11cerned a tall with the levels of carbon di- ()Xide in the air, as it is such a small percentage of the atmosphere and s i!lce water is a more efficient ab- S<Jrber ofinfrared radiation. Many <:>f the faculty member.s in atten- dallce took up various points from tltis comment, and a short diseus- !;ion ensued that added to the in- formation presented by Marr. The lecture was followed. by a wine and che~se reception in Strauss Lounge. Marr gave an i11formative and interestingpresen- tation, kept the audience i11Volved · artd conveyed a lot of knowledge to all in attendance. This week's tecture is tonight at 7:10PM in the Nott MemoriaL Professor Donald T. Rod bell ofthe Geology Depart- ment will talk about \EI Nino: A Geological Perspective.\ lt should prove to be as interesting and in- f()rmative as last week's presenta- · tion, so please come to ltear this fascinating discussion o:n global climate change. Plan Presented to Student Forum .. : Continued from page 1 convert the two floors that the bookstore now occupies into a new pub-style bar area, a two-floor version of Chet's. Other ideas for that area include a potential coffeehouse area or additional dining space. \It is going to be a good thing[forthe bookstore to move off-campus] because i1: will serve as an an- chor for what could be in the future a very attractive mini-college town,\ said Ed Dombroski, '98, a member of the planning committee. \It also great potential for the campus to expand more into the community.\ of the library, will be transformed into office space f()rthe many language professors who currently have offices at36 Union Avenue. cia! space with a proposed game toom on the balcony. \This could Qne of the most positive things that this cal11IJliS has seen since I have been here.

The bleachers on the football field will be reconstructed (the plan that is in the fundraising stage ooday for improvements to the stands in the coming years will J>.e completed) and new stands will be built ()n the east side of the field next to the Phi l}elta Theta Fraternity hoU:se. Other improvements for the campus in the first phase of the plan include an updating of the Achilles Rink facility to include a var- sity weight room in the basement, locker- room space for the women's ice hockey team, as well as new ice making equipment. Aca- demic buildings will also be touched in the initial stage of the proposal. Science and Engineering, Humanities, and Social Sci- ences will have their classrooms updated with new furniture as well as technology. Also, the language lab space in Humanities that will become vacant after the completion Other major proposed changes include moving the Admissions and Financial Aid offices Ctlrrently housed in Becker Hall into the Al(lha Delta Phi Fraternity to make it more like tltose ()[Colgate and Hamilton. Becker Hall woald become student housing. The planning board and administration of the college also endorsed the idea of the col- lege n<lt renewing the leases ofbothPhi Delta Theta and Sigma PhL ••tnterms of AD, we saw them on the same course as Delta Phi several years ago, and saw a great opportu- nity to preserve both the house and the fra- ternity. Before any plans would be finalized fortheuse of the house, we would first find another suitable site to have the fraternity housed on campus,\ said Dombroski. Other parts of the plan that C()uld be completed as early as this summer include adding a con- necting stairway that would link the Rathskellar with Old Chapel. Old Chapel and its balcony would be used for student so- Phase two ofthe plan would commence in 2004 and end in 2009. This part ()f the pro- posal calls for renovations, n1EJcli like those .slated to done in North CoUege, to be made in Fox and Davidson Halls a11d S-outh Col- lege. In an administrative 111ove, the Registrar's office will movet()the frrst floor of Silliman Hall and the persottn€'1 office now occupying that space will ll1()Ve to Fero House. The Delta Phi Fraternitybouse that has been condemned for the pastthree years and is scheduled to be razed :in the near fu- ture, possibly as early as this Spring, will be the site for additional student ltousing. Athletic facilities are also affected by this phase. An addition will be mad..e t() Memo- rial Fieldhouse that will allow br anew bas- ketball court as well as better use of space Phase three of the proposal will begin in 2010 and becompletedin 2014. Thispartof the plan calls for a renovation of West Col- lege, amove of campus safety to Fero House and campus operations to an off~carnpus site. The current campus operations complex will be demo! ished. Additionally, Memorial Fieldhouse could potentially undergo further additi()ns. Are- placemellt fund for all computers in the range of$8()0,0(}0 to $1 million willalse be estab- lished. The plan contains ways 1C> rectify the park·illg problem on campus. The overall plan still needs to be voted on by the B()ard of Trustees. Today in the Reamer Campus Center auditorium,infonna- tionalpresentations will be held at 12:30PM, 3:30PM, .and 6:30PM. ,..

This winter the Red Cross is in dire need to increase its blood supply in Northern New York. The ice storm early in January forced the Red Cross to cancel many blood drives causing a shortage ofmuch needed blood. The Red Cross is hoping to acquire 75 pints of blood from this Blood Drive at Union College. Over one thousand pints are used daily in upstate New York. This blood is used primarily for treating cancer pat:ients but can also be used for dialysis, surgery, and emergencies. One donation, which is on the average one pint of blood, is usually separated into judgements about who deserves treatment. If a doctor can deny a person treatment on the basis of rape, then is it possible that he or she can do the same based on size, age or skin color? The g~neral sentiment of the ev,ening was that the lecture/dis- cussion went very welL Students felt comfortable asking questions and sharing their views, while Pro- fessor Baker was informative and interested in hearing what people had to say. Host Jill Hit~itc:ufuu!!. was happy with the turnout and looks forward to seeing enthusi\- astic aadience participation in the weeks to come. All are welcome and encouraged to attend the lec- tures every Thursday at 7:30PM at Wells House. u€afti-€~J~~mtt•i*Y Se~~! ~·av · ~:::~!~~~~:!fl!x~ .. •·1l'~~~~·~~!,,..Ff\~~('f .. ,. . ... ;~~s~~:~;,::E£~~~~~ fib J[/f!:~ • ·13·a\-~ 'n:e·'· ,;{i~P,~·,•9~~tep · :~:·f.:!i:~:':£2f.:;;i~~ tration, preparation, the actual do- nation time( approximately 1 0 min- utes), and recovery.

inter Carnival a Success Complaints about a lack of alternative social activities other than ·fraternity parties at Union have increased over the past few years. Those complaints vanished from the critics mouths this past weekend at tlle Winter Carnival. The Carnival was a tremendous success as hundreds of students participated in the \Casino Night\ at Old Chapel on Friday 1 ... ~, ... , the ice carving contest and series of workshops on Saturday~ and finally the Winter formal on Saturday night. The events were put to~ getherby the student activities program assistants. This group wo11l<ed long hours coordinating everything from the delivery ofthe 300 pound •u1u-...,\ of ice for the carving contest to purchasing a supply of roses to resel'l at the formal. They all deserve praise for their commitment to making the weekend the wonderful time that it was. The fact that all of the events were well attended and that both Greeks and non-Greeks participated shows that the campus can have · fun outside of a fraternity party. The turnout of approximately 550 people at the formal on Saturday night, the culmination of the week- end, illustrates that the campus can join efforts to engage in a common Fraternities willingly closed their doors this weekend, one ~\'\-\'\'\' after the \dry-weekend after a request from the planners of events.

The OJ for the dance on Saturday night was scheduled only untH lam, but she was asked to stay until2am. Upperclass dining ro'?m was jammed all night, the midnight buffet was a success with a variety of finger-foods, and Chet's served alcohol and other beverages to those oflegal age. The student activi\'\ ties program assistants should attempt to plan other events like the one's past weekend in the future. Despite the fact that the work takes a lot of energy and is quite time consuming, it is well worth it. The next event, which is sponsored by the fashion show commit- is on Saturday, February 21. This second annual Fashion Show of Support is sure to be a success. FreshiDen Should Drink In regards to the question of the week, \Should freshmen be allowed to drink on campus?\ yes. Although we as a class are blatantly underage, let's face it, so is most of the student body. If they were not, then they would all be grabbing a beer at Chet' s after class, and not running to Mohawk or Gepetto's instead. I agree with you that there is a problem in our class, II students is definitely too many, but why should our entire class suffer the repercussions of the ·careless ac- tions ofa few? Some of us actu- ally drank in high .. school and know our limits, however it is obvious that not all of us experi- enced this same degree of free- dom. College is a time when you shou~d be able to have a good time on the weekends, even if drinking is involved. If freshmen are no longer allowed to attend fraternity patties then they will simply drink more often in their rooms and off campus. If fresh- men are no longer allowed to at.., tend fraternity parties then they will simply drink more often in their rooms, off campus, etc. Banning them will accomplish nothing, except maybe add to the list of patients at Ellis with drunk · driving related injuries. . For many freshmen this is the first time they've been released . from the watchful eyes of \mom my and daddy\ a time . they've been waiting for most of their lives. And, sadly, many will be damned if they let anyone tell them that they can't. They WILL find ways around it! Does anyone who came up with this ridiculous idea remember Prohibition? Does anyone realize that, if anything, it only led to defiance? To the for- mation of organized crime? Those.· who forget their history are bound to repeat it. If the person(s) who came up with this idea had taken the time to read any of our required Freshman Precept. works they would have recalled the teachings of the Tao, the warning, \not to use force to conquer .... this would only cause resistance .... Force is fol- · lowed by loss of strength.\ On the same note, the freshman class can learn from the Taoas well because, as it suggests, \Knowing when to stop averts trouble.\ Danielle Marquis Class of 200 I ' Dry Chardonnay, Perhaps -But Dry Union? by Peter Sorensen Contributing Writer WhaCs the peint of dry week- ends? That's a pretty tough ques- tion,..around here these days, Af- ter the firs~ 9ry we~kend this term, a survey indicated that we all got loaded anyway-albeit at our own expense. The second dry week. end, which I understand was vol.,. untary on the part of the Greeks, was qodoubt also secretly wet (ex.., cepting the cash bars at the Casino and Chets, which were officially acknowledged and approved of). So if closing down the fraternities doesn't prevent us from drinking, what's the point? Several posibilities come to mind ... l. The administration wishes to stimulate the intellectual environ- ment at Union. Hands down, a sober crew of students would be more conducive to that, but we don't need another survey t() re- veal that fraternities aren't a pre- requisite for cold beverages. 2. The administration wants to (eventually) break with Union's herit&ge and tradition, and join the crowd of newly Greek-less schools, most of Whom rank higher than we do in those tacky annual surveys. Noble, but not necessar- ily the best 11\.eans; bribery works, too. 3. If Chet' s is the only on-cam- pus option, why, we' II all go there. Right. In all likeliness, it's some com- bination of #'s I and 2. It is my own conviction that what we are experiencing here is not merely a fluke oftl~e·tetm, ;bq.t,rather a de- liberate .trend in policy on the part of the administration. Union is moving up in the world: we have a new scholars program, the pet- centage .ofapplicants we accept is dropping, and our freshman are statistically smarter thao our. se- niors. To boastadrycampus, even if only in theory, might be ju_st what Union needs to sharpen it's image as a serious academic envi- ronment. And when you get right down to it, that's all we're sup- posed to be here for, anyway-the rest is just details. But it's well known (though never stated) that it is the details (read: diversions) which keep stu- dents content. And the students must be a contented lot, else prom spective students will find more exciting places to get an education. Let's not forget why fraterni-ties are so big here in the first place- there's not much else to do; this isn't exactly NYC .. And fun though Saratoga be, a half-hour of DUI at 3 am just isn't worth it. The administration knows this, but they're in a bind; they don't want to kill an the fun, but public image must improve. Truth be known, I bet the school doesn't care that everyone will drink any- way. They have only -to worry about the press we get...ma,rketing, as it were. The enly problem I can forsee with this scheme is that it Is diffi- cult to .create ambiance and origi- nality; these things mustcome into their own, often quite by chance. __..What I me\J,n is that an open-mic at Psi-U (everi if Dean Alford plays) is.n 't quite the same as an .. open..,mic at Mother EarthCafe, or Cafe Dolce, or even the Coffe~ House. Similarly, a party in the college center just isn't the same as, well... you know: This is the perennial problem with most school-sponsored events: they're inherently lame.lt'sno one's fault. De.spite the ice-sculpture of Bhudda and the dec<lrations, the first thoughts that struck me upon aniving at the Winter Fonnal were \I'm at Dutch. Wheeeee.\ and it only become fup when enough of us showed up and forgot where we were (to it's credit, the bicenten- nial Gala was a notable ex:ception). During rny tenure at Union, I've often heard·students proclaim that we live in·a bubble. This is prob- ably true; in a sense that's the point of a college environment. And it seems that this little bubble is in for some shaking, like one of those winter-wonderland globes that snow when you tip them up- side-down.

inter Carnival a Success Complaints about a lack of alternative social activities other than fraternity parties at Union have increased over the past few years. Those complaints vanished from the critics mouths this past weekend at the Winter Cam iva!. The Carnival was a tremendous success as hundreds of students participated in the \Casino Night\ at Old Chapel on Friday night, the ice carving contest and series of workshops on Saturday, and finally the Winter formal on Saturday night. The events were put to- gether by the student activities program assistants. This group worked long hours coordinating everything from the deli very of the 300 pound blocks of ice for the carving contest to purchasing a supply of roses to resell at the formal. They all deserve praise for their commitment to making the weekend the wonderful time that it was. The fact that all of the eveRts were well attended and that both reeks and non-Greeks participated shows that the campus can have fun outside of a fraternity party. The turnout of approximately 550 people at the formal on Saturday night, the culmination of the week- end, Hlustrates that the campus can join efforts to engage in a common interest. Fraternities willingly closed their doors this weekend, one weekend after the \dry-weekend after a request from the planners of the events. What this shows is that the lines of communication be- tween the program assistants and the Intranational Fraternity Council and the Panhellenic Committee. There were no problems involving over consumption of alcohol this past weekend and part of that reason was that there was something going on all over campus on both Friday and Saturday nights. The lesson from this weekend is simple: the college commu- nity can have a lot of fun at school run events. The DJ for the dance on Saturday night was scheduled only until I am, but she was asked to stay unti12am. Upperclass dining room was jammed all night, the midnight buffet was a success with a variety of finger-foods, and Chet's served coho! and other beverages to those of legal age. The student activi- ties program assistants should attempt to plan other events like the one's this past weekend in the future. Despite the fact that the work takes a lot of energy and is quite time consuming, it is well worth it. The next campus-wide event, which is sponsored by the fashion show commit- tee, is on Saturday, February 21. This second annual Fashion Show of Support is sure to be a success.

Does anyone realize that, if anything, it only led to defiance? To the for- mation of organized crime? Those who forget their history are bound to repeat it. If the person(s) who came up with this idea had taken the time to read any of our required Freshman Precept. works they would have recalled the teachings of the Tao, the warning, \not to use force to conquer. ... this would only cause resistance .... Force is fol- lowed by loss of strength.\ On the same note, the freshman class can learn from the Tao as well because, as it suggests, \Knowing when to stop averts trouble.\ Danielle Marquis Class of200 I Opinions 1------------------------------------------------------------------------ Dry Chardonnay, Perhaps - But Dry Union? by Peter Sorensen Contributing Writer What's the point of dry week- ends? That's a pretty tough ques- tion around here these days. A f- ter the first dry weekend this term, a survey indicated that we all got loaded anyway -albeit at our own expense. The second dry week- end, which I understand was vol- untary on the part of the Greeks, was no doubt also secretly wet (ex- cepting the cash bars at the Casino and Chets, which were officially acknowledged and approved of). So if closing down the fraternities doesn't prevent us from drinking, what's the point? Several posibilities come to mind ... I. The administration wishes to stimulate the intellectual environ- ment at Union. Hands down, a sober crew of students would be more conducive to that, but we don't need another survey to re- veal that fraternities aren't a pre- requisite for cold beverages. 2. The administration wants to (eventually) break with Union's heritage and tradition, and join the crowd of newly Greek-less schools, most of whom rank higher than we do in those tacky annual surveys. Noble, but not necessar- ily the best m..eans; bribery works, too. 3. IfChet's is the only on-cam- pus option, why, we' II all go there. Right. In all likeliness, it's some com- bination of f:J' s 1 and 2. It is my own conviction that what we are experiencing here i~ not merely a fluke of the term, but rather a de- liberate trend in policy on the part of the administration. Union is moving up in the world: we have a new scholars program, the per- centage of applicants we accept is dropping, and our freshman are statistically smarter than our se- niors. To boastadrycampus, even if only in theory, might be ju:>t what Union needs to sharpen it's image as a serious academic envi- ronment. And when you get right down to it, that's all we're sup- posed to be here for, anyway-the rest is just details. But it's well known (though never stated) that it is the details (read: diversions) which keep stu- dents content. And the students must be a contented lot, else pro- spective students wi II find more exciting places to get an education. Let's not forget why fratemtties are so big here in the first place- there's not much else to do; this isn't exactly NYC. And fun though Saratoga be, a half-hour of DUI at 3 am just isn't worth it. The administration knows this, but they're i11 a bind; they don't want to kill all the fun, but public image must improve. Truth be known, I bet the school doesn't care that everyone will drink any- way. They have only to worry about the press we get...marketing, as it were. Th~ only problem I can forsee with this scheme is that it is diffi- cult to create ambiance and origi- nality; these things must come into their own, often quite by chance. What I mean is that an open-mic at Psi-U (even if Dean Alford plays) isn't quite the same as an open-m ic at Mother Earth Cafe, or Cafe Dolce, or even the Coffee House. Similarly, a party in the college center just isn't the same as, well... you know. This is the perennial problem with most school-sponsored events: they're inherently lame. It's no one's fault. Despite the ice-sculpture of Bhudda and the decorations, the first thoughts that struck me upon arriving at the Winter Fonnal were ''I'm at Dutch. Wheeeee.\ and it only become fun when enough of us showed up and forgot where we were (to it's credit, the bicenten- nial Gala was a notable exception). During my tenure at Union, I've often heard students proclaim that we live in a bubble. This is prob- ably true; in a sense that's the point of a college environment. And it seems that this little bubble is in for some shaking, like one of those winter-wonderland globes that snow when you tip them up- side-down.

Some scientists fear that these transplants ct~u ld spread a deadly virus similar to AIDS which they have nicKn:arned \xenozoon oses.\ A !thou ghsciell- tists do not fu 11y undetstan:cl. t!Jes~ viruses and their potentiaJ risk.s, they say, \Some viruses ma.y not pr()duce disease until years:fltter a person is infected, and s.ornce 1ltat may cause mi~imal sympto11ts in ani.1nals might be lethal to hll- ma.ns.\ In October, the Foo<l and Drug Admi>nistration stopped Nextran's experiments as well as several others when they discov- ered \that a hereditary pig virus can infect human cells.\ The Brit- ish , government banned xenotransplantation last year after scientists reported that they found the genes for viruses which can infect human cells in many species of pigs. British researcher Dr. Robin Weiss believes that this vi- rus is more likely to be transmitted to humans as scientists \geneti- cally engineer\ the pig's organs. Unlike pig organs, insulin from cows is \processed so they do not pose the same health risk as trans- plantin~ living organs.\ - While Antonio Benedi, a liver recipient and former president of Transplant Recipients Interna- tionalOrganization stated~ \But for us to have our lives saved at the potential expense of the public needs careful consider- ation,\ Dr. Suzanne llstad, a surgeon at Allegheny Univer- sity of the Health Sciences said, \To stifle it [\research into cross-spec.ies transplants\] would be to deny many of its benefits.\ As they wait for the F.D.A. to revoke the ban on animal . organ transplants into humans, doctors and researchers are be- coming impatient. Dr. Levy had to deny a patient in need for a liver transplant a pig liver as a result of the ban. Bythetimeahuman liver was available, the patient had al- ready died. However, scientists have not given up all hope for study into xenotransplantation as they are st,UJ experimenting by transplanting pig organs into baboons. British re- searcners are especially unhappy with the ban as \'each animal or- gan was expected to sell for $12,000, with the potential market in 2010 claimedto be $6 billion.\ They similarly predicted the \de- mand for immuno-suppressive drugs would also have increased, from $1 billion in 1'994 to$5 billion in20l0.\ These debates have raised sev:.. eral ethical issues as welL Sheryl Gay Stolberg of the New York Ttmes asks,. \Should anima'ls be killed to save people?

It blows cold. It brings fire and rain; feast and fam- ine. But what is El Nino? El Nifio is like a season that comes at irregu- lar intervals and stays for an un- specified period oftime. The same way yellow-orange leaves are associated with fall, or snow with winter, during El Nino, there are certain ex.pected changes in climate and weather patterns. These changes, which begin in the tropical Pacific Ocean, have come to define El Nifio. During an El Nino, the normally gusty trade winds along the equa- tor in the Pacific fade. As the winds fade, a huge po<?l of warm water off the coast of Indonesia begins to flow eastward toward the Americas. This warm water heats and adds moisture to the air above it. This in tum alters storm tracks that blow across the United States and the world. No one knows when the first El Nino occurred, but ice-core records from the Andes in Peru suggest that these climate fluctuations have been part of Earth's weather cycle for thousands of years. Some scientists speculate the topsy-turvy weather patterns be- gan when glaciers stopped reced- ing and sea-levels stabilized some 5,000 years ago. Others believe they have identi- fied EI-Nifto signatures hundreds of thousands of years old in coral growth rates. Way back in the 1500s, fisher- men in Peru noticed that unusu- ally wann coastal currentsred11ced the:ir anchovy landings. Jl..t the sa111etime, local farrne·rs notictdtbe wa:rming coincided with incr:il.lilsced rainfall.

But from the mariners' logs and farmers' almanacs, it was impos- sible to piece together the El Nino story or even to define a normal . year in rainfall and water tempera- ture. - Interest in El Nino was rekindled in 1972-73, when a monster-sized warming event rolled across Peru, collapsing its anchovy fishery, then the largest in .. the world. As the fiscal effects of a fishmeal shortage rippled around the globe, the price of pro• tein alternatives such as soybeans skyrocketed. Poultry farmers in the United States passed their soaring feed . costs on to consumers, raising re- tail chicken prices 40 percent. This was the kind of science that interested Wall Street. El Nifio, it was learned, is as much an atmospheric event as an oce- anic one. Tile winds and the wa- ters communicate with each other half-way around the world. . which seems to be constantly . expanding. But is the laptop really . worth it? The newest laptops can cost from$ I ,000 to $10,000, and they arc; almost always priced above desktop computers. The reason for the difference is in the hardware. . Laptops require special hardware: an LCD screen and smaller customized components. LCD screens are very expensive and therefore consume the largest portion of the sticker price. There are several types available including Dual Scan, Active Mattix, and Fast Scan. Even among · these choices, there are differences in size and resolution. These screens are also very fragile. Even closing the laptop too quickly can .cause damage to the screen and its many components. These traits make laptops both very fragile and expensive. The specialized components in · a laptop can include a small hard drive, integrated motherboard; and specially designed CD-ROM. Producing these specialized components raises the price of the computer relati:ve to the more abundant desktop components. Also, these components, if brok.en, must be replaced with the same component from the s·ame manufacturer. Desktops do not require this type of specifically designed components and thus. have a wider assortment of products available. Laptops, both Apple and PC generally cost more than a desktop for less computillg power. They are also very fragile and expensive to repair. Laptops do provide portability, if needed, but at the cost of both p<t:rformance and dollars. Even though laptops are convenient, I would not recommend them over a de.sktop. These portable computers are not worth the extra trouble, in my opinion.

World News· World News & Views Yeltsin Implies WWIII May Be on the Horizon by Liam Joynt World News Etfitor Last week, Russian President Boris Yeltsin warned that U.S. international aggression might start a world war. Most regard Presi- dent Y eltsin' s remark not as a threat against U.S. military action against Iraq, but as a warning not to use tactical; nuclear weapons against Iraq. U.S. diplomats in Russia as- sured Russian officials that the U.S. is well aware of the immense ramifications of such an attack .. Mr. Yeltsin's comments did not slow U.S. officials in their attemptto secure support from members of the United Nations Security Council and countries neighboring Iraq. Defense Secretary William Cohen spent recent days traveling through Europe and the Middle East to solidify support for pos- sible military force against Iraq. German Chancellor Helmut Kohl pledged to back the United States in a military venture and of- fered the use of German bases fora launch- ing point, if needed. Duet~ Gennany's large distance from Iraq, it is doubtful the U.S. would use their bases. Cohen did seek mili- tary support from Saudi Arabia, but was un- successftd. Although Saudi leaders said they diplomatically supported U.S. military force against Iraq, they would not allow U.S. airplanes 1o fly over Saudi Arabian airspace. So far, Kuwait and Bahrain (a small archi- pelago in the Persian Gulf) are the only Arab countries to offer the U.S. unlimited military access if an attack on Iraq became imminent. to Richardson, most of these countries would like to see the issue resolved diplo- matically, but they realize the need for the· threat of military force. Britain remains the only country directly backing; the U.S. on a possible military strike. British Prime Minis- ter Tony Blair has fully backed the Clinton administration and stated that Saddam must be dealt with one way or another. There are presently four aircraft carriers in the Persian Gulf(three U.S. and one British) with over four hundred airplanes available. Forty more United States planes were assigned to the region over the past weekend. Charlie Trie Surrender Overshadowed by Lewinsky Scandal Bill Richardson, the chi~fUnited States delegate to the United Nations, has been visiting top officials from members of the United Nations Security Council, in an at- tempt to win their support for an armed con- flict with lraq. He has met vrith leaders from Gambia, Sweden, Portugal, Gabon, Kenya, Costa Rica, Slovenia, and Brazil. According Yah Lin Trie, known to his colleagues as Charlie, surrendered to the federal authori- ties last week after fleeing the country last year. Mr. Trie, an Arkansas resident and Democratic fund-raiser, has been an associ- ate of President Clinton's since Clinton was governor of Arkansas. According to charges levied by the Justice Department, Mr. Trie has been indicted on a fifteen-count felony. The charges include illegal fund- raising for the Democratic National Commit- tee for President Clinton's re-election cam- paign in 1996. Trie and his friend Antonio ?an are both accused of buying White House influence for foreign countries through donations to the DNC. Trie is known to have met with both President Clinton and Vice President AI Gore on several occasions. Mr. Trie's close ties to Chinese officials have brought the Clinton Administration 1,mder suspicion of influence -from foreign coun- tries. Although these charges are much more serious than those of the Lewinsky case are, the national media has given little attention to them. Prosecutors may offer Mr. Trie a deal for his testimonyagainst high-ranking White House officials, possibly including the Fresident or Vic~ :President, leading to a reduced sentence (}l' ilo prosecution at all forhJm. slowly.

Sarah Ahart, Deborah Cederbaum, and Amber Johnston accompanied Professor Karen Brison and Professsor Steve Leavitt to the island of Fiji for 11 weeks. They lived with Fijian fami- lies, participated in Fijian culture, and investigated different aspects of culture. They stayed in a north- eastern nual areaofBiti Labu, one of the two main islands of Fiji. The students stayed with sepa- rate families and focused on dif- ferent aspects of Fijian culture. Amber researched gender rela- tions from high school age to mar- riage age and found a conflict be- tween tradition and Western influ- ences. Tiley are beginni11g to in- corporate Western ideas, such as choosing one's own spouse rather than practicing arranged marriages, while retaining .some traditional ways, such as the great iafluence of parents in the choosing a mate. Amber emphasized how 111cky she feels to :have been given this op- portunit;', saying, \I really had a great home-life in Fiji. The idea that I could fit in without knowing their languag-e well was amazing. I would bok around and say, 'How did I get to do this?'\ Deb visited a school for the disabled., a high school, and three primary schools to find out abeut issue of education for disabled children. She found that disability carries a huge stigma in Fiji. The Fijians believe that disability is caused by spirits' curses for immora.l acts. They are not comfortable with the subject, and therefol'e there are not many resources available. The children ofthecornmunitymade Deb's visit memorable: \I would play rugby and Frisbee with them around five or six o'clock at night. They were so uninllibited and willing to talk ... which many of the adults were scared to do.\ Sarah also explored education. Fijian scltools are Indian only, mixed, ()f Fijian only. The Indian and mixed schools can prepare stu- dents for higher .education, while the Fijiall schools teach practical life skills.

Every- one say Hi. l met them this sum- mer in Boston. There's. a beautiful little music shop right around the comer from The Berklee SchoQ 1 of Music that I like to stop into·oc- casionaUy and check out what I can't buy. I was just fooling with · this beautif:UI eight string bass when Ray came in and remarked about something; I was playing. We got to talking about mu.sic and instruments and such. He's a ·wonderful mus.i:Cian. He had started on saxophone years ago but was mainly a bassist with occa- sional inclinations toward guitar, ·keyboards, and dr<ums. His father had worked as a musician. Rebecca joined us inside after finishing her cigarette. He intm- ducedher as his girlfriend andthen returned to our previous conver- ., (j sation. She had a look of polite dis- interest with the whole music thing and I could tell they had been to- gether for a long time. After talking and playing for half an hour l fe]t about two inches tall in comparison to his musical expertise and decided to excuse myself from any further embar- rassment. I bid them farewell and left the store. About ten feet from the door, 1 remembered I had my camera and asked myself why I hadn't asked them for a picture. I went back in. Ray was a'll about the idea of having his picture made; Rebecca more hesitant. I took them about a block down where the light was better, uncapped the lens, and just let them do whatever. As soon as she saw how into it he got, she loosened up and went with him. They were kissing and posing. He picked her up and spun her around. They lit cigarettes and acted funky. The two ofthem were such wonderful subjects I shot the whole roll and I ended up with some pretty decent prints, This is one ofthem. I tried to send them a copy of one of the prints but the address I had written down .was wrong somehow and it came back. I can't · find anoy further means of contact so this picture is all I have. That happens a lot, I think We keep pictures as memories ofmo- ments we can't have ba.Ck, We keep them as proofofwltat once was. R.ay and Rebecca C()uld be broken up for all I know. They could have had a fight or he .could have joined a band and moved out to California. Who knows? The pointis that this photograJlh, with Ray s~nding protectively in front of her., may be the only proof of. how luppy they once were. Du~ne Michals has a wonder- ful piece of work on this subject. The ()hoto depicts· a man and a wom11n sitting on a bed, her arms wrapped around his waist. They. both r.egard the camera, smiling conte:rrtedly. The handwritten caption reads: \This photograph is my proof. There was that after• noon, when things were still good between-us. And she embraced me; and we were so happy. It had hapJJened. She did love me. Look see for yourself.\ I li.now this is pretty heavy with Valoentine's Day coming up, but it's true. A romantic relationship is o11e of the most diffi-<:ult things to maintain in this life. It takes coarage, strength, and a certain amount of rationality in the face ofdeep emotion. Love is some- times a battle; a competition. Sometimes there are both winners and losers. Sometimes people ke~p score. We try. We fail. We try again. So, for all of you who find yourselves with some()ne on this Valentine's Day, I wish youluck. S~y true to what you have but • m()re importantly, to yourselves. What you undertake is the most difficult of all huma11 endeavors but also the most rewarding. For th~ rest of us, well, just keep in milld that Valentine's Day is noth- ing more than a conspiracy put foHh by candy companies to sell those damn pastel hearts that no on~ would eat otherwise.

He pulls a gun on officer Michael RoO'ker(StanZedkov) and is shot. It turns out that the drug dealer was the child ofthe very powerful Mr. Wei (Kenneth Tsang). Mr Wei 1'!'\E:fk,f•.iJi: :;;'J'X'';;;.:J wants revenge, but rather than hav~ ing the cop killed he decides that he should watch his son die and experience the pain of losing a child. Mr. Wei.calls upon his best assassin, John Li (Chow Yun~Fat) to do the job. He promises to free John from his obligations to the syndicate if he is successful. At the moment of truth, however, John.can not bring himself to kill a cnild. Mr. Wei hiresreplacements for John and orders that John must · die. Thus begins The Replacement Killers. a When John realizes that he is not truly a killer, he knows that Mr. Wei wi U kill his mother and sister who are living in China. In order to travel to China to protect his fam~ ily, John needs falsified documents. Enter Meg Coburn (Mira Sorvino), the fake passport dealer. Their en- deavor into the world of fake ID's is interrupted by Mr. Wei's hench~ men, and Meg findsherselfcaught up in the plot to kill John. At first, she wants nothing to do with John's attempt to protect her but agrees to make him a new passport. This leads her into more as everyone who has anything to do with John ends up dead. Their lives become even more complicated when Meg convinces him that he must save Officer Rooker's son, because letting the child die is no different than pulling the ,trigger himself. John accepts this crusade, which begins a race to sav,e the boy. Chow Yun~Fatmakes his Ameri~ can debut playing John Li, the one~ . ~ cold blooded killer who suddenly has a heart of gold. Although Chow attempts to create a believ~ able character, he fans short. Chow's English is great (at least compared to Jackie Chan), as he has two well delivered 'speeches' )n the movie. When he speaks in short ~.entences, however, he sounds stiff. Mira Sorvino is cast in the sup- porting tole of Meg Coburn. Her portrayal of a girl who has been in trouble with the Jaw since the age of 14 is somewhat believable, and - -· ----,.------- --- - --·---, --- ··.- ''KILL OR BE .. . - - . . . . .

Sorvino has appeared in a \!ati~ ety of recent movies 1 including Romy and Michele's High School Reunion, Mighty Aphrodite, Quiz Show and Mimic. In a season chock full ofTitanics and Good Will Huntings,. The Re~ placement Killers is the first good action movie we have seen. It is a good, yet typical, shoot 'em up fl.ick. The fights were choreo- graphedwell, andblendedwith in~ teresting camera angles. This had the potential to be a great movie, yet it fell drasticallY. short The worst thing about it was that it got really cheesy in the middle, like when the story attempts to fomi a deeper story with John's personal dilemma of being a professional killer. Another instance was when Meg tells John that she has never made a fake ID for someone she has never wanted to leave (ohhhhh ..... isn't that nice). These just seemed tacked on. Stu.fflike that has no reason to be in an ac~ tion movie, unless followed by a gratuit()US sex scene. If drama is what .pe{)pk wanted, they wou:ld 'have. seen Titanic.

Concordy · .. 'II .... · I '• . .; .: 1 I II \ I II Page 16 The Replacement Killers A drug deal turns sol!lr when it is busted by the local cops. An unknown drug dealer is chased through a port and comered. He pulls a gun on officer Michael Rooker (Stan Zedkov) and is shot. It turns out that the drug dealer was the child of the very powerful Mr. Wei (Kenneth Tsang). !Vlr Wei wants revenge, but rather than hav- ing the cop killed he dec ides that he should watch his son die and experience the pain of losing a child. Mr. Wei calls upon his best assassin, John Li (Chow 'Yun-Fat) to do the job. He promises to free John from his obligations to the syndicate if he is successh I. At the moment of truth, however, John can not bring himselfto kill a child. Mr. Wei hires replacements for John and orders that Jol1n must die. Thus begins The Repla.cement Killers. a When John realizes thElt he is not truly a killer, he knows that Mr. Wei will kill his mother an<i sister who are living in China. ln order to travel to China to protect his fam- ily, John needs falsified documents. Enter Meg Coburn (Mira Sorvino ), the fake passport dealer. 'Their en- deavor into the world of fake ID's is interrupted by Mr. Wei's hench- men, and Meg finds herself caught up in the plot to kill John. At first, she wants nothing to O() with John's attempt to protect her but agrees to make him a new ]Jassport. This leads her into more danger, as everyone who has anything to do withJohnends up dead. Their lives become even more complicated when Meg convinces him that he must save Officer Rooker's son, because letting the child die is no different than pulling the trigger himself. John accepts this crusade, which begins a race to save the boy. Chow '\Yun-Fat makes his Ameri- can debutplayii~g John Li, the once\ cold blooded killer who ~suddenly has a heart of gold. Although Chovv attempts to create a believ- able character, he falls short. Chovv' s English is great (at least comparee to Jackie Chan), as he has two well delivered 'speeches' in the n\()Vie. When he speaks in short sentences, however, he sounds sli ff. Mira Sorvino is cast in the sup- porting role of Meg Coburn. Her portrayal of a girl who has been in trouble with the law since the age of 14 is somewhat believable, and -- ~--------------- ~---~ ~ ''KILL OR BE REPLACED.'' she seems to have fun in the ac- tion scenes. She is not, however, a Linda Hamilton from The Termina- tor. Sorvino has appeared in a vari- ety of recent movies, including Romy and Michele's High School Reunion, Migl1ty Aphrodite, Quiz Show and Mimic. In a season chock full ofTitanics and Good Will Buntings, The Re- placement Killers is the first good action movie we have seen. It is a good, yet typical, shoot 'em up flick. 'The fights were choreo- graphed well, and blended with in- teresting camera angles. This had the potential to be a great movie, yet it fell drastically short. The worst thing about it was that it got really cheesy in the middle, like when the story attempts to form a deeper story with John's personal dilemma of being a professional killer. Another instance was when Meg tells John that she has never made a fake ID for someone she has never wanted to leave (ohhhhh .... .isn'tthat nice). These just seemed tacked on. Stuff like that has no reason to be in an ac- tion movie, unless followed by a gratuitous sex scene. If drama is what people wanted, they would · have seen Titanic. The bottom line: RENT IT ***** This Week's Campus Center Movie: I Know What You Did Last Summer The.scene opens with four high school graduates enjoying their last summer together. 'Their future seems bright and promising, as they partake in one last night of reckless abandon. Everything changes, however, when a drunken accident turns their celebration into a nightmare. The victim's body is buried and a pact is made to never speak o.f it again. The events of that fateful night comes back to haunt them, for some~me knows the truth. We felt that this movie had the same feel as Scream but with an interesting new plot. Aimed at the younger generation, high school and college students will enjoy this movie. It takes a whHe to get go- ing, as the firsthalfofthe movie is spent building the story, so· that the thrilling conclusion may un- fold. This is definitely a movie to see with a bunch of friends as a screaming audience greatly en- hances the film. Having seen it in a sold out theater, it is the most fun we have had at a movie in a while. This does not mean that is a great movie, but it is entertaining. With an interesting plot and ending that will keep you screaming, we highly recommend this film. And for the pure joy ofbeing startled, it should be viewed on the big screen. 12 Angry Men Add to Winter Carnival all eleven men found themselves developed, providing a wonder- Caplin also made b<lld choices respecting this man, finding truth fully truthful presentation of the with sound and lighting, along with in his argllment and declaring the human condition and of human the help ofRasheet Patel and Dave boy \'not guilty\. beings in general.

Yield features 13 new Pearl Jam tunes including Gin:n lo Fly, the first radio single off of the al- bum. Y icld starts of \Vith a bang in, Brain of .J, a punkish fast paced track. This track is a revisit for P J to the fa:ster paced rock heard on their firsttwo albums, Ten and Vs.

In Yield, Pearl Jam seems t() step away from the ex- perimental rock that was featured on prcvioLJs albums, Vitalogy and No Code. The Seattle rockers seem to move back to the grunge rock found on earlier albums. Other note- worthy songs on the album: faith- jill. do' the evolution, and many fast cars. Although Yield is a some- what fast album, songs like: All those Yesterduys and low light, are mostly acoustical pieces that rival slower Pearl Jam hits such as Eld- er~\' Woman and Off lie Uocs. These tunes provide the album with di- versity and variety, making it great record. Yield is worth giving a se- rious listen to. Overall lwould rate this album 8 out of 10, definitely demanding a trip to the music store. Thisalhum isagem to mod- em rock listeners everywhere and should he purchased as soon a<> possible.

Hockey Continues to Falter Two more road losses leaves men Js hockey in jeoprady ofbeingfrozen out By Rich Croce Contributing Writer The Un.ion College Skating D11tchmen came into this weekend's games with Harvard and Brown on a high. Coming off a 6-3 win at Army and a hard fought 3-3 tie with rival RPI, the Dutch- men were expecting good things. Unfortunately, Harvard and Brown would play the role of spoilers in the Dutchmen's stretch run to- wards the play-offs. Friday night's game against Harvard was a slow paced grind- ing style of game. The offense for both teams ·.-,as severely lacking. Leeor Shtrom once again got the start between the pipes for the Dutchmen after impressive perfor- mances at Army and RPI. He had 26 saves in the contest while J.R. Prestifilippo just off a bout with mononucleosis stopped just 12 for the Crimson. The first period saw very little action for either side as dump and chase hockey predomi- nated. Harvard tallied first in the second period after a delayed pen- alty to the Dutchmen provided a 6 on 5 advantage for the Crimson. Graham Morrell put a rebound past an outstretched Leeor Shtrom to give the Crimson a one goal ad- vantage.

Devouring Union a Year at a Time: Katie MacOow_ ....... by Jason Everett Sports Writer Despite not having yet led the cross-country team in competition, junior Katie Ma'CDowell has unde- niably led the team in one thing - the number of activities partaken in and memorable moments at Union. In just over three years, MacDowell has the resume of a dozen seniors combined. Even though she is just midway through her third year, she has run three seasons of cross-country, three seasons of indoor track, two sea- sons of outdoor track, done two years ofballet, taken several intro- ductory athletic courses, served on the Student Athletic Commit- tee, served as an Orientation Ad- visor and will be an Orientation Chair this coming fall. Although she admits most ofher extracurricu- lar activities are \'athletically ori- ented,\ MacDowell has undeniably immersed herself in the Union ~ommunity in a wide variety of ar- eas. Cross-country coach Charlie Casey says that, \Katie speaks well for Union as the consummate Union student who takes advan- tage of everything that Union has to offer.\ MacDowell, from nearby Delmar, New York. began running com peti- tively in highschool where she ran four years of cross-country and outdoor track, in addition to three years ofindoortrack.

Many of you may not be aware, but there is a serious legal battle cturently being waged between the PGA (Professional Golfers Association) anti Casey Martin. Just to brmg many ofyou up to speed, Martin has a debilitating leg injury called Klippei~Trenaunay-Webersyndrorne. This is an extremely · rare disorder in the circulatory system where bloodpo()Js in Martin's lower right leg. Fon:easons that are far beyond the scope ofthis column, Martin's right tibia is l>ecoming more and more brittle. Now if you do not · already know, Martin is a golfer and according to the rules of golf, the use of mechanized golf carts are · ' prohibited. This thus forces Martin to have to walk the 18 boles every time he woLLld have to compete. . Martin is suing the PGA under the 1990 Americans with })isabilities Ac4 in order to forc.e the PGA to allow . him to compete witb the use of a cart. The PGA conteJtds that walking is part ofthe game and allowing • Martin to use the cart would create an unfair advantage. Martin, under a court injunction won a Nike Tour event a few weeks ago where he was allowed to use a cart. If you are wondering why Martin needs a cart, . . the answer is the following: Every step Martin ta:kes, whc;;ther it is to his mailbox. to the refrigerator, or over . a sprawling golf course, it is one more painful agonizing step towards the dreadful day when Martin takes . . a step where there wiU be none following. Martin says) \I only have so many steps left in it.\ Martin may eventually lose this leg, but it should not occur sooner rather than later. AUowing.Martin to use a cart Wotrld allow him to save his leg just for a little longer and thus allow him an attempt to fulfill his dreams as a professional golfer. · Even though many golfers sympathize with Martin, the prevalent view is that Martin should not be • allowed to use a cart. lam not here to present the entire debate for and against allowing Martin to use a. cart. I am simply here to state my views on this matter. The P<LA i& wrong. This is the same PGA who for years tried to keep blacks ofoffthe tour by saying that allowint~them on the tour would mes$ with the ''tradition\ of the .game. That's rich. The PGA is now saying thatall{)wing Martin to use a cart would too mess with the tradition of the game as well. Give me a break. I have never seen a cart hit ashotout()f a sand trap to save par, or seen a cart hit a 40 foot putt for a birdie. Perhaps a. cart would give Martin an advantage over other players, but isn't he already spotting them something'! ~ I hope Martin wins this legal battle. We all should. MMtin is a real hero in a sports world today filled with too many fake ones. Martin is showing heart, courage, detennination and persevera11ce.

MacDowell jokes that she was \am. intimidated little girl\ at first, but quickly \be- came very comfortable being here on campus.\ At the NCAA eligi- bility meeting the firstday at Union freshman year, MacDowell walked into the meeting late, and upon entering the auditoritnn, the 1 00+ athletes present tun~ed and looked at her, putting the atten- tion on an admittedly \nervous\ freshman. To make the situatioH more awkward, MacDowell quickly took a seat and was given the paperwork to fill out. Unsure of what to do, MacDowell asked the person next to her for a pen, which turned out not to work and MacDowell had to ask somebody else. MacDowell laughs at the situation in retrospect but it was certainly an interesting way to start her collegiate career. MacDowell attributes her quick adjustment to Union to assistant cross-country coach at the time, Liza Morse. The fact that Morse had been a student here and run for Union as well provided MacDowell with someone who could easily relate to her and pro- vide sound advice on adjusting to college and collegiate athletics. MacDowell has many fond memories of competition at Union, but one of the more humorous memories came while out to din- ner with the cross-country team her sophomore year at NCAA regionals in Ros;hester. The team went out for dinner the night be- fore competing and went to an Ital- ian restaurant. During the course of the meal, the restaurant had some musicians and an Italian singer who would go from table to table to perform. When they came to MacDowell's table, the singer took a liking to Katie and did not leave - serenading her with Ital- ian love songs and violin music for several minutes. MacDowell admits that she was \so embar- rassed\ by this, but regards this as one of her best memories from cross-country here at Union. Athletically MacDowell's best cross-country moment at Union came this past season at Saratoga,. MacDowell had loved competing at Saratoga since high school and at this meet broke 21 minutes (20:54) for the first time for 5 K. MacDowell said she has \always peaked in the middle of the season ... and always at Saratoga,\ so this performance should not have come as a surprise. One of MacDowell's goals is to be \con- sistently under 21 minutes in cross-country.\ In track, MacDowell hopes to bring her personal record in the 1500m down to at least 5:07 (MacDowell ran 5:14 last year). Even though she has not yet been able to achieve this consistency in cross-country, MacDowell does not allow herself to get discouraged. She says, \I do not get too upset [over bad races]. .. [I] get over it and move on. It makes me more calm and at ease.\ Although she is fiercely competitive, this view on running has given MacDowell a valuable perspective on athletics and life. \Occasionally I wish i could do better, but I know I try and as long as I try, I know I will be happy .... as long as I give l 00% in my races, no matter what [my time or place is], I know I will be satisfied. In high school I just did it [ran xc and track] to do it. .. now I do it because I love it.\ Being conteHt with her perfor- mances and enjoying the sport a111d all that comes with it is the most important thing for MacDowell. She says that, \I find running so relaxing. I am now used to the workouts in cross-country. I love runnilflg on the trai.ls and just love running in the fall when the fo!.iage is out.\ An additional thing that came along with tile sport that MacDowell has eBjoyed has been \eating at the diners [at away meets.]\ Affectionately called \The Chow Hound\ by her team- mates, it has been these opportu- nities when out eating that Katie has really gotten to know her team- mates and, not to mention, gotten some good food. Casey added tongue-in-cheek that, \MacDowell never misses a practice and never misses a rn eal.\ One thing that MacDowell does miss is former assistant track coach Todd Donnley who is not back this year after one season coaching the women's distance runners. MacDowe I! says that, \I feel so guilty .. .I was always picking on him and giviHg him a tough time. He was very creative with work- outs but at times I thought he must be joking with some of them. One day he wanted us to play ultimate frisbee, while continuously run- ning around. I thought 'aren't we supposed to be doing real running or something?' I almost dropped dead while playing. He made it so much fun even if it was a tough workout. He was a great motivator and always gave us encourage- ment.\ In addition to the coaching staff in track and cross-country, encour- agement has also come from MacDowell's family. Her family has often traveled to watch the team at away meets as far away as Will- iams. Casey says that, \it is obvi- ous that K.atie has some really posi- tive support coming from home.\ In addition to home, Katie's younger sister is now a freshman at Union, thus providing more sup- port. Katie says that \it is really nice [having Jennifer here] ... we are really close.\ In addition to Casey saying how much support Katie receives from others, MacDowell commented on how much support she and the team, receives from Casey. She said, \I love Charlie. He is very understa11ding and sincerely inter- ested iA what we are doing outside of running. He is always there to help ifyou need anything.\ Whether it has been with her teammates, roommates or coaches these past three years, Katie MacDowell has developed several kinshi ps that have made her time at Union so far tremendously re- warding and fulfilling. The memories she has can last a lifetime, so it is scary to think how much more there is to come for her, in her remaining four terms. MacDowell hopes to teach history after Union and may even be back here for graduate school, hence· more time at Union. The Chow Hound is definitely taking a bite out of Union and all that goes with it- one activity at a time, one mile at a time, and one year at a time. s W( te< thf .. du V< bo re1 pt< 20 th De Ri fin Th M aN an1 cr Ki tht M< tirr fir! 55 hir of: Un 50 I - 1 t 1 reg Sht pot I gra nC( stri gat as on ski· I thi dec Du to bo1 La1 Wi anc by Du um RP nig gin wit an< Joe Wlf ~ Rol wa. abc mo 5-1 sea to s Mo 1 the 5-0 mg ute! ing to s hov

With clear blue skies and warm sunny weather, the team had some tremendous victo- ries. Whiteface Mountain, commonly known as \'lccfacc gave the rac- ers some tricky courses, but the skiing was phenomenal. Not only did Union's racers enjoy the beau- tiful mountain range as seen from the top ofWhitefacc, but they were skiing in the presence of some of the best skiers in the world. U.S Ski team members Chip Knight and Bode Miller were training for one last day at Whiteface, before head- ing offto Nagano, Japan to com- pete in the Olympics. Union's team had the chance to talk totheseracersas well as watcll them train slalom. Aside from seeing the Olympic greats, Union's racers also got to ski on the 1980 Olympic downhill run. Forth is team the weekend waS full of Olympic glory which couldn't have been better timed than thestart ofthe Olympic games this past Friday. The results of this weekend's race snowed the Adirondack Divi~ sion what Union was made of. On Saturday, in the Giant Slalom event, Katherine Donnellan placed .fifth, Linda Pazral placed lOth and Kathleen Lamey and Reuel Daniels bothmade top twenty. Forthemen, Mike Fuller took home an amazing victory, placing first, Corey Allen and Jason Shames placed tenth and eleve11th respectively, and Dave Kashman and Josh Talbert placed in the top twenty. Racing for the B team were Andrew Beebe and Seth Wolfman. Slalom \Vas raced on Sunday and the results were as follows: for women, Donnellan placed third, Pazral placed a remarkable fifth, Lamey a!ld Daniels placed four- teenth and sixteenth respectively. For the men, F11ller was fourth and Seth Wolfiuan twelfth. Due to the icy and harsh terrain of the course, many of the Union men failed(() complete the Slalom run. Overall team totals gave the Union women a second place in Giant Slal<>m and a second in Sla- lom and gave the men a third in Giant Slalom and a fifth in Slalom. The weekend was highlighted by many tllings. The racers were finally able to ski at a competitive mountain, and they were able to see some of skiings greatest young racers train for the Olympics and on Sundaytlley were able to watch some of collegiate's best racers compete in the division one carni- val race. Such schools as Dartmouth, University of Vermont. Bates, Middlebury, and Williams College were all competing in this carnival and next year the Union ski team hopes to j<>in the carnival teams. As for now, the USCSA Regionals are looking promising for both the men's and women's teams. Next weekend will be the last Division race for the Union team and it will be held at Labrador Mountain up near Syracuse. Sup- port the ski team. -

Georgetown Loses Top Scorer ·Upon e.ntering freshman y~ar of college, students face many con- cerns. Wh~lt ifl have no friends? What ifl can'thandlethe work load? Will I get along with my roommate? How will I survive without my childhood friends and family around the comer? Tltose are just a few of the questions facing a normal colleg~ freshman. Now put yo.urselt: in Kenny Brunner's shoes. Brunner, from Cornpton, Calif., traveled 3000 miles to Georgetown, to be the startinJ?; point guard for the Hoy as. For- get about finding friends, perforrni11g well in school, and anything he may have left behind in California. The future of Georgetown basketball rested in his hands and he had to perfonn. Few fans care about what is going on in the player's life, they just want him to put the ball in the basket. You have a test tomorrow at one of the most challenging univer- sities in the country? Forget about it, we want to win the Big East, not do well in Calculus. People forget that these players we see on TV, representing our favorite college basketball teams, don't just play bas- ketball, they are people as well. For Brunner, who was leading the team in scoring, assists, and steals, the pressure was too much and he has withdrawn from school. ln a statement read by school officials Brunner was said to have .left because he is \ex.periencing some emotional diffi- culties.\ Brunner will rejoin his family,in Compton andmiss the duration ofthe season. Brunner's decision carne after a period when his where- abouts were unknown and many were concerned. Upon being found, he told coach John Thompson of his decision and felt it was necessary in order to better address the problem. Georgetown, who has already lost several players this season, wi II greatly miss what Brunner brings to the team. However, fans must be C()ncerned with Brunner the person/ student and not dwell on the fact that Georgetown lost another player. Michigan St. Shocking Many in Big Ten I recently checked the standings in tile Big Ten and was surprised to · see Michigan St., not Purdue, in first !>lace. The Spartans are a young team who were supposed to reside a.t the bottom of the Big Ten and provide teams like Iowa and Purdue easy victories. Michigan St. (17-4, 10-1 Big Ten) has disappointed those .skeptics and are <:urrently riding an eight game winning streak, whicltilas put them on top of their confer- · ence. Much of the Spartan's success can be attributed to sophomore Mateen Cleaves. Cleaves was a McDonald's AU-American in High' School, but was hampered by injuries last season and has just now . begun sllio~ing his true ability. Cleaves (l6.3ppg, 7.7apg) is one of only • two Micl:!i_gan St. players averaging in double figures, but they are in no way a 011e man show. In their victory over Iowa on Saturday, Cleaves was helc! t() just 4'points.

This happens once every fout yeats and for the ~'VO weeks they do take place, entire countries pull together and root for their re- spective teams. This is the time, · and tile only time, that people cheerfor sports such as speed ~kat­ ing or downhill skiing or luge, or a · variety of other low scale sports never hear do except during the Olympics. Unfortunately, the hastles of school work ancl careers often interfere. with people's abil- ity to watch the various events on television. Wouldn't it be nice if the world, iike the National Hockey League has done, shut down for two weeks and everyone could simply be couch potatoes and watch whatever Olympic events they chose? This obviously is unrealistic, but wouldn't it be great? Think about it. For fourteen days every four years, no one had to work, but in- stead could follow the superb ath- letes who make the Olympics so special. It would be an opportu- by David Weiner nity for countries toO forget about the problems and cllallenges the)' face and enjoy the competition the Olympics so eloquentLy provides. Now, because the Olympic host country, Japan, is located in a time zone some ten hours ahead oftile United States, the majority nf events take place, US time, around two in the morning. If not for the few hours of edited tape played l>y CBS each night, no one would have any idea what is happeni11g in Nagano. Yet, then again, are you really interested in watching an edited tape with bits and pieces of vari~ ous events sandwiched around cheesy reminiscences of Olympics past and announcer <:omments? And, who, in their right mind, is going to stay awake until 2a.m. silll- ply to watch speed skating live? I realize that not everyone shar~s the same enthusias.m for sports that I and many others do, and for them, this idea ofputtlng the world on halt is ludicrous. But, unlil<e the NBA or the NFL that so many people hate due to salary caps and free agency, the Olympics are not ordinary sports. The Olympics are battle between countries to earn tlle right, for four years, to call yourself the best. This distinction is:what drives athletes to perform, and this idea is what drives me to \-Vant to watch. By the time this article is printed, tbe Olympics will have seen half its days pass. How many events have you watched on television? I k11ow that with the amount of scl1oolwork I have these days, I have not been able to watch ANY, let alone the ones I really would like tosee. Just think how different life Vlould be if, for fourteen days, no ()11 e had to do homework, but in- stead could simply enjoy the comraderie that follows Olympic compet1t10n. While this idea, I understand, is far-fetched, it would 1Je a dream come true. The oppor- tllnity to watch Olympic competi- tiot1 24 hours a day for two weeks. What more could one ask?

Everything continued on rage 5 \Show Me the Money\ by Douglas Baski.es Staff Writer With every new school year, there is a price to pay. Now, raising tuition is recognized as more of a standard at universi- ties and colleges. Un.ion College decided to raise tuition at its B.oar<;tofTrustees tri- annual meeting held on February 5 1 hand 6th. But hidden within this approved 3. 79% tuition increase, there is a positive perspective. Diane Blake,. Vice President for Finance and Administration, said, \Tuition went up for many rea- sons. We have to maintain the ex- cellent faculty that we have here, and we have to retain the low stu- dent-faculty ratio. But that is what we think makes Union College a distinctive place andthafs why we are worth the price.\ lt is the sixth consecutive per- centage decrease and the smallest percentage increase oftuition since records were first taken in 1970-71. Currently; the 1997:.98 school year costoftuition alone is $21,945. The students graduating in the Class ofl'999 will now be p~ying $22,929 fortuition. The total costto gradu- ate as a 1998 gniduate is $28A65, comparedtothat ~a 1999 gradu- ate being $29,546; this figure rep- resents the price paid for tuition, room. board, and activities. ews: When the budget is puttogether, one figure the Board of Trustees. must propose is what the tuition increase will be, as tuition is the major source of income to the col- lege. As expenditures rise, so do revenues, which is why tuition has to go up. Total funds are accumu- lated from tuition, the annual fund (fundtaising), and a \take down on the endowment,\ which is a cer- tain percentage of money the en- dowment raises. Professor Werner, one ofthe two Union College Faculty Board of 'Trustees members, said, \The to- tal funds, combining the annual fund andthe 'take dow~,' the col- lege will bring in is between $12 ~nd $15 million. The test of the $77 million budget has to come out of tile tuition. But these tuition inw creases mostly benefit students, wh<> are limited by income; if you restrict the increase in tuition, you are going to restrict the education which Union students are to take advantage of.\ With tu.ition going up, other fees have also increased marginally. The student activity office asked for an approved increase in fees, lrom a previous $190 to $200. Hous- ing fees remain the same because \we recognize that the hOuses need to have some work done,\ Blake said. The fee for food also is by$87. omen's Hockey Goes· Varsity Page 3 According to the Admissions Office, such a tuition increase does not make a difference on the en- rollment from year to year.

Eight faculty candidateswere approved for tenure. The other issue, which took up most of the Board ofTrust- ees time, was hearing about the new campus plan. Werner said, \The expectation is that decisions will he made in June at the next board meeting, which will give the campus time to respond to the pro- posal and discuss it internally.\ The administration feels that it has cut things that they feel will not impact on the program. Blake said, \We haven'tcutfaculty, and we llaven't cut things that go on in the classroom. But what we have d()ne a very good job of is taking a look at everythingelse that it takes to run a college and doing what we can to do things cheaper, better, and more efficiently, without hurt- ing the reason why we ate here.\ Nikki Stone '97 Wins Uniort'gradtiafeNiR:kt\Stone won the US'.S fourtb,golrl medai.tllis tuesdtW wifll a neal-1~ flawless fteescyle]ump.

After taking off eight consecutive winters to concentrate on her skiing, Stone graduated in 1997, Stone started skiing after out~growing gymnastics as a teenager and used her background to master aerial events. Aerials are one of the tougher Olympic sports as it causes a .large strain on the body. The skier must go off jumps at a 70·degree angle, often ending up nearly sixty feet in the air.

Associate Dean of Academic Services and Planning D\N ight W0o:Jf gave details as to wily the change was made. According to Wo'lf, the change to start school on Labor Day has come about for various reasons. There were five factors that the faculty had to take into account in developing the fall schedule. There is pressure from many members ofthe faculty to ha~ethe summer extended as long as pos- sible so that the~ may be alJie to co11tinue their research for longer duration. This preference is in agreement with students, as they would like to havetheirsummerva- cati:on extended as .. long as. pos- sible. These are the primary factors that drive scheduling later in the year. One of the factors driving the starting date back is that many of the students want to complete the term before Thanksgiving, S() that their winter break begins from Tha11ksgiving and lasts until after Nev; Year's Day. At many other in- stitutions, students go home for Thanksgiving, and are then re- quired to return for final exams, at the end of which their winter break begins. In addition to this, the faculty is also under pressure to schedule the orientation period and the first week. of classes away from the Jew- ish :holidays in September such as Y orn Kippur, which happens to lie on September 30'\ and Rosh Hanshonna which lies on Septem- ber21\1. The fourth factor involved in the faculty's decision deals with the athletic teams. Many of the sch()ols on the semester system start their games aB.d preseason early on.lf school were to start at a later time, many of the students in the athletic departments would by Sliallll·P.

The main reason for notre- newing the lease is basically to gi-ve the college control over its own destiny.\ The committee recommended that Sigma Phi be turned into a col- lege-owned housing building. But this doesn't necessarily mean that the chapter will be forced to .Jook elsewhere for their own housing. \It is entirely possible, if not prob· able,\ according to Alford, \that Sigrna Phi would continue to live there, under the same laws as ()ther fraternities and sororities on cam- pus. They would periodically have to petition the SAC for permission to li\Ve there, and demonstrate both a positive contribution to the cam- pus and an enrichment of its aca- demic environment. They would be :put on the same footing as other fraternities~' Chris Weiler, President pfSigma Phi, said that the house is not yet too concerned with the possible implications the master plan might have for it. Weiler said that he \met with Dean Alford last week, and at this time, there are really no defmi- tive plans for our house. As it stands for the first phase of the plan, our house is not going to be affected. Basically, we' II be unaffected \ until the Board of Trustees meets again in June, and that's when Accordin_g. to Phi DeltaTheta House Corporation President John V ero, \The only plans for Phi Delta Theta are fi()t t() re11e.w the lease. Beyond that,. tile college has not presented a11y 4efinitive plans.\ Vero explaineci that the chapter, which i.s ow11ed by the alumni Phi Delta Theta Ch1b ofSchenectady, has looked into t:he possibility of having to finJ a new house. \We've hired a11 att()rney to meet with the school.ancli t() explore our options with rega.Fcl t() our present bon dioxide has had on mean glo• bal terrtperat!Lre over the past 150;000. These cor~ records rely primarily oFt pockets ofcarbon <li- oxide found ill glaciers, pockets that had closed up over many years, trapping jhe gas inside. Ac- cording to Ro.dbell, the records in- dicate a close C<lrrespondence be- tween an increase in temperature and an increaseofcarbon dioxide and als.o meti)al1e in the atmo- sphere. Lookiflg over more recent global geological history, he went on to show that the last large gJg- bal warming occurFed approxi- mately 10,000. years ago, during which the mean global surface tem- perature inc::reased five degrees Celsius over potentially a few de- cades. If the gedlqgica:l rec()rds are correct, once such a huge increase starts, \it goes very quickly,'! Rodbell explained. What causes such a quick increase in mean glo- bal surface temperat:ure? Usrng viewgraphs, Rodbell discussed how it is apparently due to the cir- culation pattern of the North. At- lantic Ocean, and its potential t() lose fresh water and not have it :re• placed, increasing the salinity of the water. This situation is simi Jar to the E-1 Nino effect in the Pacific. Recently R()dbell has spent much time oa tne western coast of South America~ particularly in Ec- uador and Pem, working with un- dergraduate students from Unfo11 and Syracuse to examine core samples and lo()k at El Nino from a geological per&pective. His fi.nd- ings have potentially resulted in a geological record of El Nino, events that have happened over the past 10,00() years. Switching gears, Rodbell went into a brief ex.- planation of what El Nino is. \El Nino is defined as the appearance of anomalously warm surface wa- ter off the coast of Ecuador and Peru for at least four consecutive months, and is the Pacific Ocean's response to the atmosp~eric forc- ing known as the Southern Oscii· lation.\ Rodbell continued to ex- plain that the warming in the East- em Pacific causes a lessening of the easterly trade winds that move warm water offthe coast of South America to the Western Pacific near Indonesia and Australia. When El Nino is in effect, which occurs ev- ery three to five years, the warm l waters move back east due to the lessened easterly tradewinds and increased west~rly tradewinds due to the warmth of the water in the Western Pacific. \Whi'le the areas location and ()the:t: locations as well,\ he said. Vero says that Phi Delt's housing future is still up in the air. \It's possible to go off cam- pus, and it's possible for us tore- main on campus. This is something we're really not sure about_ right now.\ While the lease develop· ments have been recent, Vero said, \We've kind ofbeen aware ofthe possibility of this for aVv\_hik.\ Vero emphas.iz;ed that \the rea- son we hired an attorney was not to combat the school, in any fash- ion. The reason we did it was so we could gather information, in cooperation witlt the college, from both alumniand..students. We want to make sure that the students who currently live th.ere are going to be a part of this process. It's so illl- affected the most by E1 Nino are the coasts of Ecuador and Peru ... and the Western Pacific ... , regions farther afield can also be affected as is evidenced by the extreme rain- fall events on the westcoast of the U,S,,\ Rodbellexplained. Thegeo- logical' record suggests that El Ni,no has been a natur.ally occur- ring event for thousands of years and will continue to be so. The questi·on that is rai~ed is how a greenhouse-enhanced world will affect tile severity .of El Nino. As the cycle is controlled by ocean ternpetatute, particu lady in the Pa- dfic, win El Nino increase in fre- quency and strength as the ocean temperatures rise due to the in- creased greenhouse effect? \As two of the most severe El Nino events in the last 200 year~ have occurred since 1980,\. Professor . John Gar~er includes, this seems to be tru~. In the past, \giv~n the Jack oflcng(>2500 year) geologic archives of El Nino events, the de- pende:nce of El Nino .severity on sea surface temperature remains somewha.t unclear - this new find- ing (Rodbell' s work in South America)\ gives more clarity to the issue. Adding to the claim that glo- bal wam.ing has an impact on the severity and frequency ofEI Nino is the fact that scientists using buoys in the Pacific were able to perfectly predict the last El Nino. As with the following week's presentation, a question and an- swerperiod fo II owed during which more knowledgeable members of the audi.ence asked numerous questit;>-ns reg~ding Professor Rodbell 's findings. The lecture was fo II owed once again by a wine and cheese reception, which was held this time in Old Chapel. Rodbell added to the everyday in- formation of all who were present, and received an enthusiastic round of applause for his presentation at it's concJusion.

Science & Tecb:nology Science & Technology An A£ternoon Nap Helps to Rejuvinate by Victoria Hargreaves Science & TeclullJlogy Editor Naps: we used to despise them as they took us away froni oar sand castle--building, bicycle-riding fun, but now we crave them as an en- ergy boost and a release from w0rk. Although naps are often asso- ciated with laziness,. scientists. have pr<>ven that it'isa \biological urge.\ Many famous, world-changing people including Napolean Bonaparte, Albert Einstein, Win- ston Churchill, Thomas Edison, and John F. Kennedy took naps. Few would describe Einstein as lazy. By rneasuringthe body tempera- ture, researchers have djscovered that this \biological urge\ gener- ally occi,Jrs between I and 4 PM. Although Americans usually dis- miss.napping, many cultures em- brace it. Mexico observes an af- ternoon siesta. Greece similarly rests in the afternoon by closing its businesses froin 12 to 4 PM. \Shift work, transpottation de- mands, and continuous operations engender sleep loss and circadian disruption. Both ofthese physi- ological factors can l'ead to in- creased sleepiness, decreased performar:tce, and a reduced mar- gin of safety.\ To better understand fatigue on pilots, NASA investigated the effects of 40 minute n~ps on pi- Jots.

The most com- mon disadvantage of taking a nap is sleep inertia which is a difficulty adjusting to the environment ~m- mediately upon waking up from a nap. Sleep inertia can last from ,five to thirty minutes. Naps can also affect later sleep intervals. \A long nap at ce1tain times of the day, can disrupt the quantity and quality of later sleep periods.\ Unfortunately, approximately 80% of people who nap during the day do not sleep well at night. The remaining 20% of people find themselves alert and revital- ized after a nap allowing them to sleep better the next night. \Naps can maintain or improve subse- quent performance, physiological and subjective alertness, and mood.\ For those who find naps benefi- cial, researchers recommend keep- ing the nap between a half an hour and two hours at the maximum, napping in the afternoon when brain activity decreases or in the mid-morning when \it's mainly rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep,\ napping in a place where there are few interruptions, allowing oneself to overcome sleep inertia, and nap- ping before a time ofreduced sleep rather than after. • Trade Old CD's For a CD Writer by Jeff Ausfeld St'!ff Writer Wouldn't be nice to be able to make your own CD's? Fortunately, CD writers are now becoming af- fordable to thegeneral pub lie. Be- fore I go on, I should discuss what a recordable CD-ROM is and how it works. A normal CDconsists of essen- tially three layers, the middle be- ing the layer that holds all of the information, and that layer is cov- ered on both sides by a protective layer. A CD-ROM reads a disk by bouncing a laser beam off the sur- face of the disk with great preci- sion. The beam passes through the protective layer, hits the data layer, and bounces back to a re- ceptor. But, how does the receptor tead the information? Digital data is an arrangement of ones and zer<ls. Even your music COs are just bunch of ones .and zeros. Well, if one looks very closely, on the surface of the CD is a bunch of really tiny bumps. These bumps change the deflection angle of tile laser. Let's assume that there are two receptors: one that reads only ones and the other only reads zeros. When the laser beam does not !lit a bump, it reflects to the one re- ceptor, and when the beam hits a bump, it is defected to the zero re- ceptor. This is how the data is ex- tracted from the CD and is put into your stereo or into your computer. Does the recordable CD-ROM work like that? The answer is yes and no. The defection process and the receptors are the same, but there are no bumps. There are tiny burn marks on tile surface ·of the CD that deflect the laser beam and act like bumps. How much information can I put on one CD? The average recordable CD can hold six and a half zip disks or 650Mb. What ifl make a mistake when burning a CD? If you are using the new re-writable CD's, don't worry,just record it again. Let's talk startup cost. The ini- tial cost of the drive is about $400 for a good one, and if you don't have a SCSI (small computer sys- tems interface) card, that will cost another $100. Wow, that is a lot of money. That is the problem with recordable CO- ROMs, the initial cost. But, ifthe math is taken out long tenn, it ends up being a savings. The zip drive will cost between $15 0 and $17 5. Each disk costs about $10. They can hold I 00 Mb, and they do not !lave universal acceptance. For $10 you can get two COs, most ofthe time more, and they can hold $130 worth of zip disk information. In the long run, the recordable CD- ROM owner will save hundreds of dollars. What are recordable CD-ROMs good for? One major advantage is you can back up your entire com- puter on a few COs and then go to any computer in the world that has a CD-ROM and you can have all of your files handy. Have you ever bought a bunch ufCD'sand you only like listening to a few songs on each one? Well, just record your favorites onto one recordable CD. One CD can hold 75 minutes of audio music and any stereo in the world too can read yournewCD. These are just a few of the countless applications of the re• cordable CD. For those who have one or are getting a recordable CD- ROM, happy burning.

Commonly kno-wn as \roofies\ or '\the date-rape drug\ Rohypnol (chemical name: Flunitrazepham) is an additive sedative, ten times stronger than Valium, which is illegal ill the US but available by prescription in 64 countries, including- Mexico. Many users falsely assume ·that the drug is safe because it is s<;Jld on the streets in the manufacturer's original packaging_ It is relatively easy to get and a single dose can cost as little as $3.00. When slipped into a beverage, be it a plastic cup of beer or a bottle of Snapple, it can leave anyone subject to sexual assault, either because the victim is unaware of her or his altered state or because she or he is unconscious and unable to resist an attack. Furthermore, RQhypn o I can produce partial or cOtmplete amnesia, making it impossible to remember what yo\! did-. or what was done to you-while under its influence. This effect is heightened when the drug is ingested with alcohoL Rohypnol is usually found in tablet form and perpetrators most often drop whole or crushed pills into a victim's drink while she or he is not looking. When dissolved in a drink, the drug is im;possible to see, smell or taste. Although the effects of Rohypnol may vary de- pending on the amount ingested and the amount of alcohol or other drugs consumed with it. telltale signs include: -Appearance of intoxication dis- proportionate to th.e amount of al- coho! consumed (or despite lack of alcohol consumption); -Unexplained drowsiness, dizzi- ness and/or impaired motor coor- dination; -Confusion, impaired judgement and/or loss of inhibition; -Impaired ability to remember ·details. Rohypnol is only one of many substances that can be used to se- date victims in order to rape them. While this is not a new practice, the prevalence of substance-related rape has increased significantly irt recent years. The tragic fact' is that rape usu- ally happens for reasons that have nothing to do with the victim. It can happen to anyone, even you. Although such drugs are hard to detect, there are precautionary steps that U can take to reduce the risk ofbeing victimi;zed. -Ne.vet leave beverag~s una{. tended. -Do not accept beverages from someone you do not know and trust. -At a bar or club, accept drinks only from the bartender or server. -Be alert to the behavior of friends. Anyone appearing dispro- portionately inebriated to the .amount of alcohol they consumed may be i.n danger. -If you experience dizziness, ex- treme drowsiness or other sudden and unexplained symptoms call someone you trust. Find someone to drive you to an emergency room or call 911 for an ambulance. If possible, try to keep a sample of the beverage for analysis. (Suggestions courtesy of the D.C.

I tried some thing new this week- . end. No, I don'texpect a medal nor do l want to he showered with flow- ers from adoring fans. \So what, Eugene tried something new this weekend, big deal, I try new things all the time and J don't waste my time by writing about them in the newspaper.\ OK, you're right it is no big deal that I attempted a new activity this weekend, 1 promise that there is a point to this weeks article! As children we are told \Don't judge a book by its cover.\ I know that al'l of you out there have heard this statement at least once 0ur short, uneventful lives. Yet how many of us truly knc!>w what It means? Sure, we can immediately say that one is not to make a rush or snap judgment just because the outside looks like s&*t. Yet how many times do we foll0w this over used cliches. I've made snap judgments in the past, and l'm sure I'll do it in the future. One ofthese is mal<fng an uneducated decision about a group of people who only want to have fun. Snowboarders! I used to feel· that snowboarders sucked, they are the bane of every skier. They race down the mountain at bJeakneck speeds, not caring for anyone who gets in their way. Snowboarders push all the snow to the side efthe trail making the majority of the slope icy. Most of them can't ski worth anything and the rest are try- ing to be all cool al}d alternative, but in actuaiity just look retarded. They seem to think there is a feud between the two groups of snow loving creatures but again it is all in their delusional, pot hazed .• I arn c0ol. .. really I am, look how rebel- lious my clothes and hair are. Any- one can see from this description how I felt about the majority of SnowboaFders .. 1 didn't hate all of them, my brother snowboards·and so do my cousins,. but hey what do I have in common withthern'? The stage is set for what hap~ pened this weekend. With a cara~ van of my friends, I took off for Hunter Mountain. The entire way up all I couldthinkofwas how nice it would be to strap ·an a pair of skies and hit the various trails that · Hunter had to offer. There was only one problem, my ·skies were at home and I was racing on tile New York Thruway. What was I to do? 1 did not want to rent a pair o{skis, so the only logical step fo:r me in my twisted mind was t0 rent a snowboard and take a lesson. Early the next moming I was doing something I had vowed I would never do. You have all seen the American Express ad about Jake Burton, well my view Of snowboarding and those who doit could hav.e been summed up by those dm:nb kids who have that i<,ii- otic laugh in the ad. Snowboarders annoyed me and here I was about to try it. I know its a little hypo- critical, but hey I am young, ·sue me. After getting my equipment I stepped out into the brigh,t morn- ing sun. I was ready to con()uerthe mountain as a Snowboarder. This is where 1 got my~elf into some trouble. Forthe.firsthourthatl was on the mountain l was on my butt. l could not stand upto save my life. It's very painful. Luckily, I signed up for a lesson at 11 :30 AM. This was not pretty, there was more fall- ing involve& Not just \hey I fell,\ but more like '\hey I have fallen, slid twenty or so feet on m:y face, tried to get back up, feU over again and felt like :Jo got kicked in the head by a donkey.\ Then, the inevitable came, we had to go up to the tqp of the trail. I got on the chairlift with no problem. I did a face plant get- ting off. It then took me 45 min- utes to get down one simple green circle trail. I am not kidding. During this45 minutes, I learned my valuable lesson of the week. Every time that I fell ormadesome other idiotic novice mistake on the trail, some complete stranger snowboarder would offer some ad- vice. They were doing what so many people today don't, these strongers who knew what they were doing were helping out someone who did not. Beyond the multicol- ored hair and the big \alternative\ styled clothing, there was sub- stance. At that moment or I saw beyond the \cover.\ So what did I learn then ... is the fact that sticking with.skiing is safer for my body. And just because I don't like the style of dress or the choice of hair design or color does not give me the right to make any decisions about those people. Only after an encounter like the one I had this weekend, it is only then once you know them can a judgment be reached. And while I don't think that l will snowboard in the near future I do know that l won't be so quickly to . curse out a snowboarder the next time I go skiing. NO MORE BEAUTIFUL DISASTERS by Matt Aronowitz Staff Writer This is the most self-centered ar~ ticle I will ever write. It's also my last. This is officially my retirement article. Why Matt? Why? Well there are a few reasons. It started when I received a letter from fel- -low staff writer David Kay. He didn't appreciate being ripped by me a fewweeks back. We corre- sponded by campus mail until we realized that it waS- an inunature way of dealing with things. So we had a heart-to-heart. We cleared things up. He didn't really say much, but some of the stream of consciousness things that came out of my mouth got me thinking. Why do I write these articles? My-first thought was: to get chicks. That certainly didn't happen. If anything, it helped me make more female friends, which I already have enough of. My second thought was that I wanted to point out things that we all thjnk about, but rarely discuss. (e.g. The Art of Saying Hi Article, and The Snigglets) That one actually worked. My third thought was that I wanted to make people laugh. I'd like to think that I did, sometimes. I'm running out of ideas, though. The thing is that I'm not very absorbed in the mainstream cam- pus community. I find it hard to strike up conversations with cer- tain groups of people. So [ feel that obscure references don ~t go over well 1 also have zero involvement with the Concordiensis. I write, drop off my disk, and pick it up· the next day. I'd rather be forced to stand tinder the leaky awning in Upperclass where you rerum your tray, than attend another bulls&@t gathering that they call Concordiensis Staff Meetings. But 1 digress. What it comes down to is that, as much as I love having 3 0 friends tell me how much they l<>ved the current week's article, [ wanted more. I wanted campus wide rec- ognition. Sort of like David Kay gets, but nothing like that at all. He's Beavis and Butthead; I'm The Simpsons. I'm not saying that f'm an amaz- ing writer. Ijust feel that some of my articles have been extremely refreshing and have provoked in• telligent conversations. lhavere- ceived zero feedback from people that I don't know, and 1 feel that this column is not worth the men- tal effort I put into it. During my conversation with Mr. Kay, l said something. that stuck .in my mind, \On this campus, everybody is nobody.\ AH tile cliques concentrate, so- cially, on themselves, and most students here couldn't point out me or David Kay in a lineup. We're just faceless authors. Who knows, when I come back from Israel next January, 1 might give it another crack. I just hope that this article doesn't get every sentence cut off a la Frank Rossi. Trying to read his resignation was like being on the receivingend ofaMcDonald's drive-thru order. \Two large pshhhh. And a number chchhcchc. Hold the grrrrr .. \ Later. I'll leave the paper with a top ten list. These things are great for the sole reason that I can put things in them that would sound awkward in prose. (Kind of like that last sen- tence.)

• Sphere 1 ;000 feet below the Pacific, a 400 year old spacecraft is d·iscoverecl. • In atop secret military operation, a team of professionals is formed to descend into the icy depths and make first contact with .an alien life form. Within the bowels of the vessel lies an enormous and per- fect .sphere of shimmering gold. Discovering the sphere, the team unleashes tremendous power. .. and their worst fears. Norman Goodman (Dustin Ho:ffman) is a psychologist who prepared a report for the Bush ad- ministration outlining protocol for a firslcontact situation. The docu- ment proposed a team consisting of a mathematician, an astrophysi- cist,. a biologist, and a psycholo- gist. Goodman believes the report to be a joke until he firtds \1im.self in the middle of the Pacific being briefed on the crashed spacecraft. Goodman chose a psychologist to lea<! the team as the primary Qb~ stacle to facing the unknown is fear. Samuel L. Jackson plays the mathematician who is responsible for communicating with any dis,.. covered inte11igence, and Sharon Stone is the bioiogist who will study any life form encountered. Liev Schreiber is the astrophysi- cistwho will determine from where the came,. but what he discovers seems even more unbe- lievable than .first contact. And of course, what team would be com- plete without the military aspect played by Peter Coyote. Living in a habitat on the ocean floor, the team is separated from humanity by 1,000 feet of freezing water. They venture into the spacecraft, only to find that it is not what they expected at all. As with an good science fiction,. once they encounter the sphere, everything goes to hell. A myste- rious entity Qan hear their thoughts and kills without warning or re- morse. They must rely on each other to survive, but in the cold dark11.ess of the ocean, fears be- come reality and reason turns to panic. The aU-star cast gives an excellent performance, and the sense of isolation and despair be- comes all too reaL · \It wasn't as good·as the book, it wasn't as as the book, it Smashing Pumpkins Guitarist Goes Solo by Mat Barry WR UC Music Director James Iha finally got bored sit- ting around with Billy Corgan and fellow Smashing Pumpkins mem- bers and decided to record a solo album. Iha's solo project CD is titlc;;d Let It Come Down, and this aibum lets you do just that. If you are any type of a modem rock or Smashing Pumpkins fan, stay cleat: of this album! lha does a complete 180 with his guitar style on this album playing with a slower country/western style unlike any Pumpkins album. All eleven tracks are mellow acoustic love ballads that leave the listener ready to doz.e off and go to sleep for hours on end. Missing from this album are the loud gui- tars and strange effects -that Iha is known for. His shy voice and coun- try style leaves listeners asking, ''When is lha going on tour with Garth?\ It's a nice attempt' by Iha, but maybe he should stick with hi~ day jobofplayingwith the Pumpkins. I doubt you wJII hear any ofthis al- bum on the radio unless you listen to songs such as Sound of Love and Jealousy. HUM: After a somewhat long break from the music scene, the alterna- tive rock band Hum comes back with a new album titled Downward is Heavenward. This record fea- tures the same solid rock that was heard on their previous album, I'd Prefer to be an Astronaut. Some ofthe tracks are mellow enough to allow one to sit com- fortably reading a novel. Other tracks such as The Inuit Promise will have you playing air guitar in the middle of your room.lnthis al- bum, Hum adds new dimensions to contemporary modemrock, mix- ing and matching certain sounds and notes. Downwal'd is Heavenward makes the listener rethink rock and what it is really about. This album is defi- nitely worth. the drive to the music store. This is not a classic album but none the less should be bought by any modern roc)c listener.

The Bottom Line: Matinee Coffeehouse Plays Dutch Hollow - by Kimberly Rohback A&E Editor • Last Tuesday you may have noticed that there were no tables or chairs at Dutch Hollow. Com- fortable couches. and 70;s style armchairs were strewn about the Campus Center courtesy of the Coffeehouse. Members of The Society bor- rowed a truck from Campus Opelfl,.. . tions and lugged all of their fumi- . ture, lamps, coffee bar, coffee thak- ers, cappuccino machines, het chocolate, coffee, sugar, stirrers, and sound equipment down to Dutch Hollow. Underthe supervision of Coffee- house president Douglas Dakin, the crew transformed Dutch Hol- low in under two hours.

i '' Spotlight .on Actor Carey Miller by Kiml>erly Rohback A&E Editor When one thinks of Union Col~ lege Theater, on.e of the biggest names which comes to mind is Carey Miller. Miller has been a major contributor to the arts at -Union sine'() his freshman year. This term, perhaps in his greater:;t achievement, Miller is directing an all African-American cast in th.e gospel drama \Mama I Want to Sing.\ During th1l Fall term ofhis fresh• man year, Miller played a student in the department production of \The Primary English Class\ di- rected by ~arry K. Smith. Miller then touk a brief· h ia:tus from the th~ater and retut11ed with a starring role in Fred UITich's pro.,. duction of'\Six Degrees o.f Separation.\ Miller played Paul, theho'mo- · sexual charac- ter. \Paul was an exploration character,\ said Miller, \it was a good learning a tot' from his actors and pushes them to get it.\ In the same term Miller was also working on a two m!l.n show di~ rected by Jessie Schaeffer. ''Sizwe Bansi Is Dead\ was a breakthrough play for Miller. It was a two man show, which place a lot of pressure on Miller and his co·star George · Tiggle. • In addition to the growth oppor· tunity the play afforded;, \Sizwe Bonsi\ wasan African~ American . play. ltwas a good.attempt at open· ing the minds of the campus com~ · munity. Unfortunately Miller felt . \certain people didn'ttake us seri~ ously. They saw George and l as individuals and missed the point of the play.\ \ T h e ·Seagull\ was Miller's latest theatrical en· deavor. Under the direction of Sara Chazep, Miller de- scribes \The Seagul I\ as a chance \to work with a new and refreshing directing style as well as to play a character with which I felt very comfortable. Dr. Dom was Cbekov' srendition ofhimself. I got to play a laid back man of wisdom.\ Professor by KimberlyRohback A&EEditor Professor William Lacy is the visiting director at the Yulman The· ater this term. As a world re· nowned expert on Shakespeare, Lacy is directing this term's depart- mentproduction of\Two Gentle· men ofVerona.\ Lacy's.involvement with Union College began three years ago when he played Eliphalet Nott in the bicentennial celebration \God Delivers\ directed by William Finlay. Lacy's relationship with Finlay began while he was the di- rector of Theater at the University ofBoston. · Finlay was working with move· menttraining. Lacy considered the play an opportunity to not only catch up with a friend but also to get to know the school and the stu- dent body. Lacy's next trip to Union was last term. Finlay asked him to di- rect a two day workshop working students through Shakespeare's elevated text. The workshop placed an \emphasis on the train- ing of the student in handling blank verse ... the beating heart at the center of the play.\ This workshop laid the groundwork for Lacy's big- gest Union project. \Two Gentlemen ofVerona\ was chosen because, as Lacy admits, \while it is not one of his more popular plays, had Shakespeare not written Hamlet or King Lear, it would still have met with much sue- cess.\ \Two Gents'~ was also writ~ ten by a very young Shakespeare about the trials and tribulations of young people. Lacy felt it was a show that Union students could. relate to. Another reason for the selection ofthe piece was due to the experi~ mental nature of it. ·~shakespeare tried everything in \Two Gents.\ It is a good play for young actors in a college environment.\ The piece itself is built around themes of courtly love, clowns, and Robin Hood ou:tl~ws. Lacy describes the piece as a romantic comedy. The play isbeing directed as a workshop and every rehearsal is an attempt for the actors and the director to read the words and ex- plore them. \The actors come to the text in- nocently with no preconceptions. They then explore it in terms of its rhythms and all ofthe little devices Shakespeare uses to indulge the actor and stimulate the appropri- ate responses. Tlu text .plays through the actor.\ Lacy instills the power and per- suasion ofthe words in his actors. \We tend today to use words as labels, so when an actor confronts elevated text there's a tendency to want to do something with it. What I try to do is reverse this process; to play the words truthfully, invent- ing them and reporting truths as you speak,\ says Lacy. This kind of training is the \heart of theater,\ according to Lacy. The experience is awe inspiring to the students. \When con~ fronted by what looks like a lot of language, most actors feel intimi· dated. But when they discover that language is an elaborate score, the actor starts to welcome it.\ Con- temporary theater says less. It forces actors to play \between the lines.\ Shakespeare puts the inner stuff }n exquisite detail, and it is then brought to the verbal. Com- paring the contemporary theater to that of Shakespeare is like \com· paring a six note jazz piece to apiece by Mozart.\ Lacy's personal work focuses on these practices. He works with other authors of elevated text like the great Greek tragedians and Moliere. Lacy commented on the fact that Shakespeare wrote these plays very qHickly and put them on with no rehearsals. His work attempts to explore how they were produced, because the direction must have been hidden in the text. \Two Gentlemen\ was written in the 1590s, while the theaters were closed due to the Plague. The piece deals with the contrast between friendship and love. It is rather ironic that this \celebration of health and vitality\ was written amidst such disparity among the playwright and his patrons. Lacy says he enjoys working with such an energetic cast and is delighted to be back at Union. \Two Gentlemen of Verona\ opens next Wednesday.

HousewiU be coming to Union College to perform a play titled \Their Untold Story.\ The play will be held at the Coffee House and will feature children ages 5~14. The C.O.C.O.A. House was started in January of 1996 by Rachel Graham 1 98, Savita Rathore '98, and AlexandriaBeuchert '98. The letters stand for \Children of Our Community Open to Achieve- ment\ and its main goal is to pro- vide children with a positive in flu~ ence that they might not be rece iv • ingathome. Rachel Graham explained that growing up around Hamilton Hill exposed her to numerous prob· I ems. These problems include teen pregnancy, drug use, and violence. Also, many of the children in the area have that did not at· tend college or graduate from high school. Every Wednesday from 4:30-6:30 PM, a group ofUnion stu· dents go to a local church where C.O.C.O.A. House is held. They tutor children from grades K-12, and after their homework is com- plete they get hot cocoa. To the children, college students serve as role models as well as mentors. In addition to tutoring, the children are exposed to other venues of educational enrichment. Each week, the C.O.C.O.A. House tries to promote a new theme, such as music and art aprredation, Japa~ nese culture, or theater. While homework and grades are impor· tant, education has a lot more to offer which cannot be obtained through textbool,s. The most recent project the C.O.C.O.A. House has been work· ing on is a play featuring the chit~ dren who go there. The play is titled \Their Unto ldStory\ in honor of Black History Month. The play features numerous lesser known who have contributed great amounts to our history. These historical fig- ures cover several aspects of American life including sports, sci~ ence, politics, art, music, and the· ater. The children have been working extremely hard for this and say that they are very excited to be perfonn· ing at Union. The experience gives them a chance to learn about an important part of our history while it allows them to express them- selves through theater. The play is open to the entire campus and community. There is no charge and coffee and other vari~ ous refreshments will be served. In celebratimi of Black History Month and our youth, everyone is strongly encouraged to attend. Also, if anyone would like to par- ticipate in C.O.C.O.A. House, a van leaves from the campus center ev- ery Wednesday between 4:00·4:30 PM. If you have any questions concerning the organization, con· tact Rachel at 372-5416. Doing it for the kids: Underprivelaged Scheneetady children can receive academic helt

World News & Views U.S. Exp ores Diplomatic Options in Iraq Conflict by Liam Joynt World News Editor Kofi Annan, the Secretary Gen- eral of the United Nations, is plan- ning a trip to Baghdad to seek a diplomatic resolution to the arms inspection crisis that has arisen their. Annan has met with the five permanent mem hers of the United Nations Security Council (U.S., Britain, China, France, and Russia) several times over the past week in an attempt to reach the speci fie demands that would avoid a pos- sible confrontation. The United States and Britain have both ad- vocated the use of military force against Iraq if officials do not al- low United Nations weapons in- spectors unhindered and uncon- strained access to all sites sus- pected of arms construction. France, China, and Russia are all seeking a mGre diplomatic resolu- tion, making their top priority the avoidance of military conflict, in- stead of access to weapons sites. Since the U.S. and Britain are the two countries willing to use force, they claim that the guidelines for a peaceful resolution will cater to their desires, since it would be pointless to pursue any other guidelines. The United States main objective is to make it clear to their allies in Europe and the Middle East that although they will remain unyielding in receiving access to all sites, they plan oil exhausting every diplomatic option before the use ·Of force. For the United Nations to use military force a m.Yorityofthe mem- ber countries of the United Na- tions Security Council must vote in favor of the action and all of the five permanent members must ap- prove the action. Since three of the five permanent members would vote against the use .of military force, any military action against Iraq will be done without the sup- port ofthe United Nations. Pres- ently, the United States, Britain, Germany, Canada, Australia, Ku- wait, and Bahrain have all sup- ported the use of mHitary force against Iraq. United States troops and weapons have been bolstered in Kuwait, the most likely point of attack on Iraq. Iraqi officials hav,e warned Kuwait that there wi II be ser,ious consequences if the U.S. is allowed to attack Iraq through their country. Other Middle East states that are U.S. allies have shied away from supporting military force against Iraq, primarily because it would be unpapu Jar with the people of those countries to attack another Islamk nation without a threat to their own sovereignty. Saudi Arabia would be a crucial ally in an attack on Iraq, as a launching point for United States planes, but they have re- fused to support the use of mili- tary force in favor of a diplomatic solution. Kofi Annan will meet with the entire fifteen-member United Na- tions Security Council before leav- ing for Baghdad. Then he will work to end the standoff with the help (but not bound by) the guide. lines obtained in his meetings with tile U.N. Security Council. Canda Moves to Stop Seccession of Quebec The Supreme Court of Canada is presently hearing a case, brought before it by the federal government of Canada, questioning the right of the province of Quebec to se- cede from Canada. The main ques- tioo before the court is whether a referendum in Quebec affirming secession is legitimate or if the en- tire country must do the voting. The question will be addressed from aConstitutionallaw perspec- tive (Canada's) and from an inter- national law perspective. Secessionists in Quebec are outraged because they think the federal government is infring- ing Upon their s0vereignty to de- cide what is best for Quebec. The s&:cessionist movement is led by the French-speaking minority in Quebec, but a 1995 referendum on whether Quebec should secede was defeated by a very narrow margin. The Premier of Quebec, Lucien Bouchara, has hinted at another referendum as soon as this spring. Russians Create Possibe Uncureable Strain of Anthrax Through gene-engineering tech- nology, Russian Scientists hiwe created a new version of the highly communicable disease Anthrax, which has often been speculated as a great germ for biological war- fare. Anthrax usually affects ani- mals, but in large quantities it can be very harmful to humans, even causing death. It is unclear why the Russians are pursuing this technology, although it may be simply to strengthen their vaccine. But if this strain of Anthrax is un- affected .by the present vaccines given to U.S. soldiers, then it could be a devastating weapon. In light of Russia's close ties with Iraq and their unwillingness to bear arms against them, the thought of this technology falling into Iraqi possession is frighten- ing. lt is thought that Saddam Hussein's main stockpile of bio- l'ogical weapons is Anthra){, al- though there is no indication that he has possession of the new vim· lent strain created by the Russian scientists. Cuba to :Free 200 Prisoners 'Followi~g Pope's Visit Last month, Pope John Paut 'II gave Fidel Castro a list of over 300 prisoners (many thought to be po- litical dissidents) that he would like to .see released. This past week,. Castro announced that, although one third of those ori the list were no longer in prison, all the' Fest would be released in the near fu- ture. According toCt;lbanofficials, the prisoners were being released regardless of their crime, meaning that both \common\ criminals and \political\ criminals would be granted the same clemency. The Vatican response expressed the Pope's gratitude towards Castro and claimed the action was a call to the whole world, not justa favor to the Pope. Sinn Fein Banned From Peace talks? Due. to the Irish Republican ·Army linkage te the kiHing of two civilians in Belfast last week; the British governmentis contemplat- \\ing a ban against the Sinn Fein (the political wing of the l.R.A.) in fur- ther peace talks. Supporters ofthe Sinn Fein say that the attempt to expel them from the peace talks is a misattribution by the British Gov- ernment and Ulster Unionists (the pro-British political party in North- em Ireland). Those in favor ofthe ban claim that the direct violation of the ceas·e-fire supposedly in place by the I.R.A., warrantsaloss ofpowerby the Sinn Fein. lfthe Sinn Fein were banned from the talks, it would be a heavy blow for those who support the reunifica- tion of Ireland and increased influ- ence by the Republicoflrelandin Northern Ireland. Wealth ofOil May Lead to Distribution of Wealth Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, and Turkmenistan have tremendous potential as oil-producing nations. All three of these countries, lo- cated on the Caspian Sea, have shown to be the so rich in oil that the region faHs 'behind only the Middle Bast and Siberia as the worlds third richest region of oil With development projects under way wJth help from Westem inves- tors, these presently poor coun- tries are predicted to gain much wealth. Presently these countries are authoritarian governments and they are slated for huge profit in- creases beginning around the year 2005. With virt.uallynomiddleclassand few precepts of democracy, it is very likely thatonly the wealthiest persons in these countries will ac- tually benefit from the predicted twenty-fold profit increases. Thus, these nations will verj'likely remain mostly poor with little technology, education, or infrastructure.

Dis- senters to these efforts think that Western countries should leave n<>n- Western nations to develop on their own with their own cul- tural integrity. Professor Prevost Shares Cuban Experience by Aileen Quigley Staff Writer Though few students on this campus are old enough to have borne witness to the dramatic changes in Cuba over the past 40 years, Professor Gary Prevost '69 shared his experiences and obser- vations of the metamorphoses within its political and socioeco- nomic climates. On Thursday, Feb- ruary 12, in the Nott Memorial, he cited the papal visit to Havana as direct evidenee of these changes. Information about the country's past was crucial to the audience's full comprehension of the extent of the change. Thus, Prevost began ltis lecture by juxtaposing the present stance of Cuba with its his- tory. Greg Van Holt '99 was \im- pressed\ with Prevost's attention to both the positive and negative aspects of the culture and his com- prehension of the need to couch his lecture within the appropriate context. Prevost cited that, from 1959-1990, Cuba had developed one of the welfare states and had the best life expectancy rate (75.6 years), far higher than most 'third world' countries. Its educational system could also boast an adult literacy rate of94%, and everyone had at least eight years of formal schooling. During this period, com- munism was in full force and re- mained a very salient aspect of Cuban life until about I 0 years ago. This was in direct opposition to the capitalist policies of the United States, prompting the Reagan Ad- ministration to instate a policy of isolationism. From 1989 to 1991, Cuba experi- enced a significant downfall, and Prevost explained that the newfound U.S. involvement in the aftem~ath was a calculated attempt to thwart communism. With the country's infrastructure in trouble, America saw its chance to tighten its reigns against the influence of communism of our Cold War op- ponent the Soviet Union. Over the next few years, Cuba was able to rebuild its tourism and promote ·its biomedical center and its good doctors, and tried to become more agricultural self-sufficient. Cuba had previously relied on commu- nist countries for many of its prin- ciple needs. It used to trade nickel with Russia for food and oxen with other Soviets, but in light ofU. S. influence, it started to investigate outside sources. Cubans solicited support from private companies, Prevost stated, and have made sig- nificant changes ever since. For the first time in 40 years, fam- ily restaurants were allowed on Cuban soiL The government l!eal- ized that the people needed those businesses in order to survive. Nevertheless, this stands as dra- matic evidence that capitalism has begun to establish a definite foot- hold in present day Cuba. It is con- troversial to many in Castro's re- g,ime since privately owned busi- nesses like restaurants are blatant reminders of the changing atti- tudes of the citizens and the glo- bal community at large towards communism. The Pope's visit is ;:tlso indica- tive .of these major changes. The presence of religious figure,. spe- cifically a Roman Catholic church offi.cial, makes on think about the growth of tolerance between our societies where there used to be isolationist animosity. Cuba is try- > ing to make a link to the outside world, according to Prevost. Whether or not the United States will be that link remains to be seen. Get Involved.

Down and Out at Achilles Skating Dutchmen drop two more as ECAC Tourney hopes fade By Jonathan Gasthalter Editor-in-Chief Wh~n any hockey team is in the cellar trying to climb its way into the top ten of twelve teams in the league to qualify for a playoff berth, good goaltending is essen- tial, but scoring goals is even mote important. The4-l7·2 (2-10 .. 2 in the ECAC) Dutchmen understood this principle when they faced off against St. Lawrence an<i Clarkson Friday and Saturday nights at Achil:les Rink in front .of a Valentine's weekend crowd.

Instead of fold- ing during a five-game losing streak, the Dutchmen defeated the Skidmore Thoroughbreds for the second time this season, 82-79, and came back home for the final time this season to beat the Hobart Statesmen, 78-66, The wins brought the team back to the \Mendoza Line\ as their overall record became 11-11 and UCAA record moved to 5-5.

........ For those of you who looked and missed me last week, due to a scheduling error on my part, I took a brief one-Week hiatus and am back in fun forc.e to deliver my riveting commentary on club athletics at the mighty Mecca that is Union College. It seems that my articles have started a little buzz (in tenus of controversy, folks - all symbolism aside) in the athletic community here at Ole uc,·and 1 have to say that it is about time. I have been working here for four years trying to make people open their eyes to a few things that should not go unnoticed, and it appears that I .have finally found the proper medium to do so (meaning my loud mouth for the first three years obviously clidn 't do the trick). So, if I angered anyone, I probably should apologize, but I am not going to. I am reporting the truth as far as I see, possibly subject to my own opinion, but I am not going to argue the value of truth through ones own perception because that's really what is going on and it's a debate that's better left in philosophy class. In any case, instead of apologizing, I am probably moving farther into the world on controversy this week, if not in the eyes ofthe students then probably by the faculty- and staff. I am a senior, and frankly, I don't care who thinks I am wrong. I am sitting on a writing career that w ilJ end its affiliation with the Concordiensis in about 15 weeks or so, and as long as I am not lying about what I write, if my column angers students, faculty, administrators, or staff, my mailbox is always open. Besides, I still have yet to see any mail about anything, and since I still have a few more weeks to cause problems, so I can always hope. What controver1Y might I be referring to? The past is the past, so its time to delve into new waters, or something like that. Without further adieu, \In The Spotlight. .. \ (like I have a staff or something) is ready to bring you the Union College men's club hockey team. As the end of its ·inaugural season rolls to a close, the men's club hockey team has seen an up- and-down season in many aspects of its existence. Despite the team's new founding, it registered 32 members for what was going to be its 8 (or so) game season. Although the season was cut to four games due to cancellations, this is a team that can do a lot of boasting. I briefly spoke with Nick Campbell, a freshman team member, who stated that \the team is intensely competitive. A lot of these guys could have gone Division 3, but decided to come to Union instead.\ How competitive does that make them, these could have been D-3 players? They recently took on Mohawk Valley Community College's Varsity team (MVCC is known mttion wide for its excellent athletic program at the junior college level) at the Utica Auditorium, home of the AHL Utica Blizzard.

They look like a l()ng shot for the NCAA tournament unless they turn things around immediately. This is the same team that defeated defending national charn pion Arizona, and looked good doing it. One of their lowest points came over the weekend when they were handed their worst home defeat ever by Clems,.n. In the 78-49 thrashing FSU was held to just two fi.eld g()a]s in the first half.

The shut-out weekend at Achilles Rink was put behind the mind$ of the Skating Dutchwomen, who wanted some revenge for the two disappointing games. Union went to Skidmore last Tuesday and had no problems in their 3-1 ,.win over the. Thoroughbreds. Qn Saturday, Union traveled to Clarkson, look- ing to repeat the score in their pre- vious game against the Golden Knights, in which they crushed them 9-0. The Dutchwomenplayed upto their potential, and again beat Clarkson, bythescore of7-0. Scor- ing for Onion was sophomore ;Beth Gabriel, who conne9fed for two goals. The offensive line, consist- ing of all freshmen, scored four of Union's seven goals. Michelle Stein and Ali Trownbridge each tallied one, while Arika Bjorkedal registered two for the team. Also adding to the score was junior Sara Moss. \We definitely were the dominating team. We skated and passed much better and played most of the game in Clarkson's zone,\ coach Tim Benson said.

Busy Week for Women's Basketball Leads to TwO L<?sses by David Weiner Staff Writer This was yet another busy week for the women's basketball team as they endured three games versus strong league opponents. Al- though the possibility for post sea- son play left the women's minds early in the season, their desire to learn and play has carried through what many would say has been a successful season. While tjle team lost to league powerhou~es RPI and William Smith, they were able to pull off a huge road victory ver- sus Skidmore, a team that had pre- viously defeated Union by seven- teen points. This victory was an indication of the potential the Dutchwomen possess and what can happen when that potential is turned into reality. RPI 70-lJnion 49 Suffice it to say, this game did not go as well Union would have liked, facing an RPl team that held a 17-2 record and sat second over- all in league standings, Union knew that grasping a victory on the En- gineers home court was a tough task. While the team did a good job of working the ball in their of- fense and running the various schemes the learned in practice, it was RPI' s experience and second half adjustments that ultimately got to the Dutchwomen. As the first half concluded, Union was trailing by just nine points, a fllargin they w.ere some- what pleased with. However, RPI picked up their defense tremen- · dously in the second half, shutting down theperimeterofUnion's of- fense, thus preventing Union from running their offensive patterns. In doing so, RPI was able to create forced shots, grab rebounds, and find · their way to the basket, opening up an insur-. mountable lead. The positive point to this game for Union was the return of injured Cap- tain Leah Olivieri who had missed two weeks due to a foot injury. Without Olivieri, Union had been forced to use their three point shot • more often than usual, playing withaweakened inside game. The return. ofOlivieribmught some overcompensation as the Dutchwomen at- tempted to move the ball inside too much. Unfor- tunately, having missed · · tow weeks, Olivieri's timing and conditioning were a bit slow. Her return; however did spark the of- fense as she played approx·imately half the game, scoring nine points and slowly feeling her way back into game form. Also playing well for Union was Erin McNamara, Beth Petry, and Sara D' Arcangelo, who all scored eleven points each. This loss was a difficult ()ne for the Union team to swallow, but the few bright spots it showed pro- vided the incentive to look ahead to their weekend matchup with Skidmore. Union 75- Skidmore64 As coach Mary Ellen Burt put Ski Teatn Earns a Spot at Regionals Next Weekend byReuel.Danielsand David Kay Staff Writers ... In the last official race ofthe sea- son at Labrador Mountain last weekend, both the men and women's ski teams qualified for the United States Collegiate Skiing Association (USCSA) Eastern Re- gional competition. Top male skier Mike Fuller stated that the accom- plishment was a great leap for both teams. \Over the last three years we have gone from having no team to a very small team to being one of the best and going to Regionals.\ Last week on a cold and icy course at Labrador Mountain, both men and women placed well enough to qualify for regionals next week. Fuller won both the Sla- lom and Giant Slalom competitions. However, the men's ski team faced trouble when three of its top racers crashed. Two of these men include Seth Wolsman and Corey Allen. However, the team stood strong and placed fourth qualifY- ing as the final team for Regionals. The women's team also placed fourth last weekend, leading to a rank of second in the league. Out of three possible spots -for Regionals, the women's team quali- fied with room to spare. The team's top skier, Katherine Donnellan was unable to compete, however. To compensate for this loss, Linda Pazral placed eighth in the slalom and tenth in the giant s1alom. Reuel Daniels and Kathleen Lamey both placed in the top fif- teen. Both men's and women's teams qualified forRegionals which will be held at Waterville Valley Moun- tain ski area on Sunday and Mon- day. Schools from all over the Northeast region will partake in the race. Racers describe the C()urse as both long and fun. World Cup ski races have been held at the course. \This is a big step for both men's and women's teams becaase it is the firsttime Union has qualified . as an entire team. Hopefully good things will come of the Qpportu- nity for our ski team,\ elaborated Fuller. For the w<>men's ski team, Donnellan will return givillg them a boost in regional comp-etition. However, Jim Bryant, who !las been out all season, will not be back next week. Mike Win11, a top male skier, stated that last week was C<the cli- max\ of the season and is an excit- ing moment in Union skiingllistory. \After such a long !ll>sence, Union skiing has overc~Jtne all odds to make a great comeback We . have overcome all odds to;qualify for regionals despite the fact ,that we have been missing ()Ur- top people.

After one hatf of play, Union trailed by onlyninepoints andju:st a few minutes into the second half ttaiied by only five. The key to this success was that Union was s.coiing points and staying even with their opponent. However, approximately eight minutes into the second half, William Smith be- gan to take over. The fresh legs from their bencn·p.rovided the of- fensiv-e and defensive spark they needed and while Ufliun played a stroll.g game, they were un;rble to stick with a super.ior team. The William Smith bench scored nearly twenty points and posted fifteen. rebounds, stati.stics any coach would be pleased with. As the minutes ticked away in .this gaflle, William Smith slowly took control and demor'lstrated why they are the league's number oneteam. Witll this loss, Union's record fell to a mere six wins and fifteen losses, leaving tliem as the ceilardwellersofthe UCAA. How- ever, if Union is able to defeat Clarkson and St. Lawrence this .coming weekend, a feat that is ex- tremelyrealistic, they will finishthe seas.on in fourth place in the UCAA, a feat unexpected of this young team, but one that would give their ·confidence a strong boost into next season. While this week brought to losses sand- wiched between a tre.mendous vic- tory, it is the victory that will be remembered and the victory that wiUpropel this team through their final week of a growing season. Dutchmen Hockey Continued From page 17 ruary 25, 1994 against Brown. Koenig, despite the record looked to the future. '\I enjoyed the game even though we lost it was excit- ing, It is too bacl that we could not score a couple of goals to get the win. W~ have to get one win at a time to try to make the playoffs,\ he said. Tile Dutchmen, due to the vari- ous injuries, dressed only sixteen healthy skaters for the game. Freshman forward Bryant Westerman spent a lot oftime on defense. Sophomore tri-captain Ryan Campbell summoned up Union's disappointing weekend, saying, \Friday night against St. Lawrence it was just a siniple case of us just not playing a full60 minutes. Sat- urday night, we played well and took the body t<> them very well. Koenig played well- 55 saves- he didagoodjob ofkeeping us in the · game. It was :a stop and go game with penalties and died not have a very good flow to it.\ Union, now 2-12-2 in the ECAC and 4-19-3 overall spend the next two weekends <>n the road visit- ing Dartmouth and Vermont next weekend before traveling to - Colgate and Cornell on February 27 and 28. The Dutchmen, al- though in the cellar are still not mathematically <>ut of the playoffs.

t I i Homeopathic Medicine Works by Peter Flynn Cont;iJmting Writer Doctor of homeopathic medi- cine, Larry Malerba, spoke about his practice in Classical Homeo- pathic Medicine last Thursday night at Wells House. Malerba's lecture was the second in a series offour events as part of Health Is- sues Month, this month at Wells House. On Tuesday, February 17, a workshop on HIV and AIDS was held at Wells House. All Union studeHts are welcome and encour- aged to attend these lectures. The last lecture will be this Tli!esday at 7:30 at Wells House. Malerba discussed the differ- ences between traditional (or allo- pathic) medicine and homeopathic medicine. He explained that there are two distinct philosophies as- sociated with these differing styles of medicine. Homeopathic treat- ment involves \looking at the big- ger picture,\ according to Malerba. Whereas in traditional medicine, the treatment or \cure\ for a dis- ease is based 011 the disease itself, in homeopathic medicine, treatment is based on the medical history of the patient. When the symptoms of a patient are treated through tra- ditional means, the bac~eria or vi- rus is usually suppressed by the drugs and not actually \cured.\ Sometimes the virus will surface again a year later in other forms. Doctors typically will not link the two sets of symptoms and will again treat the \new\ virus by sup- pressing it This can continue for years as the patient's health de- clines. In these cases, Malerba explained that a homeopathic spe- cialist will examirre patient's whole medical history and research the symptoms in an attempt to develop a homeopathic treatment that will reverse the stages of the virus un- til it is completely cured. To illustrate the process of ho- meopathic treatment, Malerba dis- cussed one of his patients as an example. A young boy, who had developed the itchy skin condition of eczema, sought an allopathic treatment that suppressed the vi- rus. The boy did not have any prob- lems for about a year until he de- veloped asthma. Again, the asthma was treated allopathically. Another year passed and the boy developed behavioral problems due to attention deficit disorder. The boy was sent to a psychiatrist who prescribed Ritalin, a common drug that improves a person's abil- ity to focus. The boy's health did not improve until he saw a homeo- pathic doctor. The homeopathic doctor found an organic cure that reversed all of the symptoms th(!lt the boy had suffered over the pre- vious years until the virus had left his body for good. Malerba explained that one of the biggest problems with the widespread acceptance of homeo- pathic medicine is that although it has been proven time after time to work when conventional medicine has faHed, it is very hard (if not impossible) to explain why it works. Homeopathic healing is re- liant on a complete evaluation of the patient by a qualified doctor. When considering options for the best treatment, patients should keep homeopathy in mind. It might be the only option. If you have any questions con- cerninl?; the Health Issues Month, please contact Jill Hirshenfang at 388-6703. Cocoa House a Sn1ashing Success by Marisa Schneer Contributing Writer On Thursday, February l9'h, in Raymond North, the Cocoa House presented a play in honor of Black History month. The Cocoa House, which stands for Children Of Our Community Open to Achieve- ments, is an after school tutoring program started and supported by members of the Coffee House. Ev- ery Wednesday from 4:30 to 6:30, Union students tutor children from the Hamilton Hill area in various subjects. The program was started two years ago by Rachel Graham, aU nion student. She explained. \I started the program 2 years ago in 1996, for interaction with the com- munity, especially the Hamilton Hill area. Basically we meet every Wednesday for 2 hours in the Hamilton Hill area to help tutor the children with their homework. Then there's a cafe scene after the Homework, like a coffee house, but we serve cocQa.\ The play entitled, \The Untold Story,\ briefly traced the lives of ten African-Americans, each who have made a great impact in his- tory. The idea for the play was sub- mitted by Graham, to two other Coffee and Cocoa house members actively involved in the theater. Together, they created a script es- pecially for the children to perfonn. For each person portrayed, one child would narrate that person's life, while another child acted out the events described. The children confidently took the stage and charmed the audience with their adorable performances and over- sized costumes. Some of the fig- ures depicted were White House Advisor Mary Mcleod Bethun~:, Actor Sidney Poitier, and musician W.C. Handy. At intcm1ission, Eli?.a- beth Graham, Rachel's younger sis- ter, read a poem entitled, \States of Matter.\ The high school student \\Tote the inspirational poem for a project on an anthology of Black Art. Elizabeth is also a partaker in her sister's program; '\I needed some help with some subjects, teachers aren't always available, and other tutors are often costly. The Cocoa House tutors really helped me with my ecorromics, and a college course I was taking.\ After intermission a boy, ap- proximately ten years old sat down crying hysterically. After a few min- utes of consoling him, one of the tutors handed the boy a camera. Suddenly his mood changed, and the small boy was transfonned into the next Mario Testino, photo- graphing Madonna for the cover of Vani(l' Fair. The tears disap- peared, as he ran towards the stage, snapping pictures of his fellow ac- tors. By the time his tum comes around to play basketball player Chuck Cooper, the boy is happy and eager. The girl who handed him the ca~nera, watched him proudly. The ages of the children seem to drastically range, from s\)me as ) oung as 7 or 8, to High School students such as Elizabeth. The children that appeared in the play were the regulars at the Cocoa house. but Rachel clarified that there are many random participants each week. Residents of the Hami !ton Hill area were notitled of the project in 1996, when Rachel handed out fliers advertising tu- tors. Today, while there seems to be a significant amount of children in the group, Rachel says that she \could always use more tutors.\ If interested in the program, Rachel can be reached at 3 72-5416. Watching the tutors and chil- dren interact, it is evident how grateful both are. The Cocoa house is nothing less than a success. GPS: An Engineering Triumph by Professor Frank Wiclls Contributing Writer You can now rent a car at the airport in a strange city and on a panel mounted keybQard input the address or name of your destina- tion.

Montana Staff Writer This past Thursday eveni:ng in the Nott Memorial, the third part of the Envirol1lllental Studies Program four-part seminar series on global climate change was prese11ted. Pro- fessor Peter L. Tobiessen of the Union College Biology Department gave his talk entitled \Global Wann- ing-· What, Me Worry? The Ef- fect on Plants and Animals.\ Tobiessen discussed the potential effects of global warming on vari- ous plant and animal species and what may happen to them should global wanning continue at its cur- rent rate. He added anew perspec- tive to the first two talksgiven by Professor Rodbell ofthe Geology Department and Professor Marr of the Physics Department. Switch- ing gears, Tobiessen reflected not as much on the changes a11d their causes, but rather on their results. The presentation and ensuing question and answer period was the longest yet,. but also the most entertaining. Tobiessen's relaxing and comical, but serious approach to the talk provided everyone present with a very clear picture of how global warming can change nature as we know it.

While valid in theory, Jupiter was notal- ways visible and it was found to be impractical to track these moons from a moving ship at sea. Determination of longitude re- mained the biggest problem for 11avigators that caused many ships to be lost at sea. In desperation England's Parliament in 1714 passed the Longitude Act that of- fered a prize equivalent to $12 mil- lion in today's currency for an im- proved method. The race between the astronomers and mechanics was won by the watch maker John Harrison who defied the experts by engineering clocks with an error of less than a second a day, or a twelve rnile longitudinal accuracy on a 60 day voyage. upon the natural frequency of ing how hard predicting the effects atomic vibrations along with the ofglobalwarmingwas and likened developmentofrockets and orbit- it to predicting the weather. ing satellites has led to the GPS.

As the glacierreceded and temperatures wanned, 12;0()0 years ago, pine, birch, and many furs had migrated into Connecticut. As the temperature continued to, increase, about 9000 year& ago, oaks began to move into Connecticut, aad to- day, oaks are the primary tree found there. According to the p<>llen grains found. in core sam pies, the spruces and firs that moved to Connecticut migrated from present-dayGeorgia. Thevegeta- tion that is in Conne~tkut now used to be around the nortltem part of Hudson Bay in Canada, 12- 14,000 years ago. Tobiessen .ex~ plained that as the temperature decreases, vegetation moves south, and as temperattlre in- creases, v~:<getation moves aorth. The rate for this migration during the last glaciation was about one kilometer a year, an incredible rate for trees. Tobiessen then went into a brief discussion of how til is may have occurred. As he then went' on to say, \But who cares.!?!',. An- swering his own question, Tobiessen explained how com- puter models show that sugar maples, which are abunclant in Pennsylvania today, will move north to Maine and Newfoundland if the current amo'!lnt of car.bon di- oxide in the atmosphere <ioliNes. This doubling is predicted to oc- cur within the next one hundred years. Tobiessen went on to explain how plant migration can effect ani- mals. Species need habitats in or- der to survive, and if certain habi- tats disappear, the species that live there will either have to adopt to a new habitat or die. This happened during the last Ice Age in Europe, where animals and plants were sur- round by glaciers in the n()rth, the Atlantic Ocean in the west, and high mountains in the east and south {the Urals and the Alps and. Pyrenees; respectively). fie also explained how human preserva- tions, while a good intent, make it hard for species to migrate. When a particular area is closed off and preserved, the surrounding area is usually developed. When tempera- tures raise and northward migra- tion begins, species are cut ()ff\fr()n1 moving north by the holls~s, roads, and commercial busi11esses that have been built around the preservations. The resultirtghabi· tats may not be suitable for plants and animals that live in the preser- vation. Wann-blooded animals can adapt, but cold-blooded animals will have a harder time. necessary for photosynthesis. But once the forest has reached matu- ration, equilibrium will be achieved and no new carbon dioxide will be absorbed. This process takes about one hundred years. Even cutting down forests once they no longer absorb anymore carbon di- oxide is not a viable option as de- forestati<>n ·is one ·Of the largest contributors to increased levels of carbon di()xide ,jn the atmosphe.re. The biomass of the ea:rth stores about2 +/-.05 x 1 0\'9 metrictons·of carbon dioxide a year, and scien- tists are s1ill uncertain where this is stored. The ab~ve, however, explains that it is not trees and plants which do this, only grow- ing trees and plants. So while pre- serving mature forests and stop- ping deforestation doesn't add to the carb<;>ndioxide levels in the at .. mosphete, it also does not help to decrease the amount of carbon di- oxide that is being released. Tobiessen concluded by saying there are many unknowns in the big picture, but some extinctions are certain should global warming continue, and that some factors are certain as welL Opening the floor to questions, Tobiessen addressed the points and concerns of almost a third of the audience who brought them tip. In so doing, Tobiessen provided even more knowledge than he presented. In responseto Professor Leslie Hull's question, \What about the food supply?,\ Tobiessen responded by saying~ \Buy land in Alberta.\ He explained this by saying \that's where the U.S. corn belt will be if temperatures keep rising.\ Many of the following questions dealt with the q11estion of where the 2 x 10\'9metric tons of carbon dioxide are stored each year in the biom- ass and possible explanations for this. Various audience members attempted to provide different per- spectives on where it might be go- ing. The thirty-five people in atten- dance, m()stlyUnionfaculty, Were thrilled with the presentation and gave Tobiessen two rounds of ap- · plause. The best part of the pre~ sentation was that Tohiessen many times allowed the audience to draw its own conclusions in- stead of always saying this was true and that was true and so on. Based on the ever-improving pre- sentations~ the final discussion this evening at 7:30 in the Nott Memo- rial shoU'ld be the best of them all. Professor James M.

Another community member said that Union has proven commitment to the restoration of the Nott Me- morial and, \the city nee.ds to be strong and recognize those factors as well as tile idea that education should betl1e number one priority in the country.\ According to other GE Plot residents the expan- sion of Union onto the historical s.ite vicinity, would enforce a healthy ec()nomic gain. \Union involvement adds positive contri- butions to Schenectady,\ another life-long resident, Caroline Nichols said. In terms of involvement in the community the Town Counsel Meeting also commended Union College for-their beneficial actions in the community.

The cortunittee had been engaged in preparations since the end of October, and as Becker said, \It was a really long proc.ess. At first l thought it was never go- ing to be over.\ Kanfer added that the models themselves had \do- nated three to fout weeks of their time.\ Becker explained that the task became less formidable as it progressed. \Once we got the clothes from our sponsors, and once we had out ad campaign [ es- tablished], things started rolling,\ she said. \I felt that it went really well. People appreciated the diver- .sity [among the models], the mu- sic was fun, and the outfits were fun.\ As for how this show com- pared to last year's, she said, \This year it might have been more of a known event, and so a lot of differ- ent people came to it. But we raised almost the exact same. amount of money as we did last year, and I think that overan, both shows were equally great success.es. We could have used a few more people on the committee, because each indi- vidual ended up having to do a lot of work. But I was really happy with the way i~ turned out.\ The reason for the increase, as he- 1-------------------------- said, was because of \the huge N · kkt. St< one Update Junior Ron Zuckerman also saw a greater issue addressed by the event's turnout. \My overall im- pression was that the Fashion Show of Support left a good im- pression on the audience,'; he said. ' 1 People cheered when their friends came down the runway. This spirit alone shows that students are not necessarily apathetic about Stu- dent Activities' events. If mote events like this were to be insti- tuted.throughout the year, it's pos,.. sible that problems in t_he arena of alcohol consumption and the like could be alleviated.\ :The fashion show was orga- nized by an.executive committee of nine-students: Senior Chairs Dave Kanfer and Sloane Silver; and se- niors Matt Cohen, Sarah Matt, Tammie Rosen, juniors Emily Becker and Spencer Wanderer, and Kanfer pointed out that the ticket sales had increased over last year's, even though the ticket price had increased; as well. Last year's <turnout last year. We figured we _· 1 _ . _ · could increase the amount of money raised and still have a lot of students show up.\ The cost ofthe show, including publicity and setup, came to about $5,QOO. Half of this figure was provided by the Forum, and the remaining half was covered by President Hull. Kanfer also commented that the switch in location from Upperclass Dining Hall to Memorial Chapel was a good one. \This year's show was much more elegant, because it was in a much nicer venue,\ he said. ' 1 0verall, things went more smootllly this year, as we were able to learn from some of the mistakes we had made last year.\ Cohen agreed, saying that \the work that last year's committee did was invaluable to us, as far as giv- ing us a blueprint to work from. The fact that we were able to use Me- morial Chapel was a big plus.\ Cohen also felt that the idea ofhav- ing an after-show reception worked welL \The Pipers and the Minstrelles were fabulous, and it was nice because people were able to talk to the models and mingle together after the event.\ Courtesy of Public Relations If Nikki Stone decides to retire from the demanding and sometimes dangerous sport of freestyle aeri- als, she may be betterprepared for the transition than most of her peers. Her senior thesis ()11 \Elite Fe- male Athletes' Retirement from Sports\ explores how athletes re- focus their lives after leaving an intense, singular pursuit and a small circle of fellow athletes and coaches, said Don Spring, her the- sis advisor. \When any elite athlete retires, it's a tremendous letd()VIn,\ said the assistant professor of psychology. \You retire and yo11r identity is gone after your whole 1ife has been wrapped up in the sport, you don't just walk away from \.Vho you are or what you've been. \I was intrigued to learn from her that~here is a social cleath as well since all your friends- your major source of support · are on the team,\ Spring said. \So you have to get a whole new set of friends.\ Stone, who for most of the last decade has associated with other wo riJ-\:Iass .ath ictcs <tl training and completion sites, interviewed about 40 women. In her thesis, Stone found that to the extent an athlete is well rounded and has other pursuits besides her sport, the transition to retirement will be smooth, Spring said. Stone, wl:!o has said she is con- sidering a second career as an in- vestigative TV reporter, has anum- ber of other interests besides ski- ing. Many athletes retire from their sport embittered by disappoint- ment at having been injured or fall- ing short oftheir goals, though this will not be the case with Stone, he added. \I never .realized the level of in- tensity in a sport like this, and Nikki is a very intense woman,\ Spring said. \She has amazing responsi- bility,drive, and focus. You don't have to tell her to do something. She is a real self-starter.\ As a student at Union, Stone made good use of her training in psycholog:y, Spring said. She used visualization techniques to help her with her jumps, and she used im- agery to ()Vercome shoulder and back injuries, Spring recalls. \She had to pla:y her mind game realty well because she had suffered a lot of injuries.

Youhearabout them on the news. But are they just for quacks? No. In fact, herb- alists have been using medicinal herbs to heal' wounds and revital- ize patients since 500 BC. Paracelsus, one of the first re- corded. herbalists proposed that plant's physical characteristics predict its effect on man. He used Lady's Mantle which resembled a woman's cervix to aid childbirth and yellow dandelions to treatthe liver. Surprisingly, his predictions proved true. The Indiana Botanical Gardens state, \Dandelion helps to enhance the flow ofbile from the liver, which assists in healthy digestion. Fora healthier liver, we highly recom- mend Dandelion for you.\ Noble women during Medieval Times were expected to know how to use herbs to tend to their sick and dying husbands, fathers, and brothers. The following is a compilation of the herbs most recently in the news. As with c:t'll drugs, one should consult his physician be- fore taking these supplements. Echinacea, a North American black-eyed Susan-like herb, is relatively easy to fmd as it grows alongside roads, in prairies, and in fields. Like the In- dians who Hsed echinacea as an anti- dote to snake poison ~and to treat every- thing from tooth- aches to smallpox, today echinacea chiefly functions as a blood purifier and an antibiotic. Scientists believe this herb works by stimulating the body's immune system to ward off invading bacteria. Some researchers believe echinacea can be used to kHI tu- mor cells. They hope to hone its anti-inflammatory natllreto treat ar- thritis. St. John's Wort, another herb can be found in the Northwestern United States and throughout Eu- rope. Its popularity began in the Middle Ages when people be- lieved it warded of.f evil. The plant acquired.its name from St. John the Baptist. Christians would immerse the plant's leaves in olive oil to produce a red oil they Scientific Interest Results ~rom the \Superman Gene\ in Plants by Jennifer Trotts StaffWriter Interest in using methylation to fight liver disease, cancer, aging and cardiovascular disease in hu- mans has resulted in scientific in- terest in the mutations of the so- called \superman gene\ in plants. Mutations that- inactivate the superman gene cause Arabidopsis, a small weed in the mustard family, to produce an abundance of sta- mens, the pollen-producing male sexual organs ofthe flower. Scien~ tists have. known thisfor some time, but Caltech researchers Steve Jacobsen and Elliot Meyerowitz. Meyerowitz have discovered that a process known as DNA me- thylation ean also inactivate the superman gene to give weaker mu- tations, which they call the \Clark Kent mutations.\ According to Jacobsen, methy- lation is a process in both plant and animal cells that results in a tem- porary modification of the organism's DNA. This modification does not change the sequence information of the gene, although it can alter a gene's activity just as DNA se- quence mutations can. The normal function of the su- perman gene is to ensure that the flower makes only six stamens, Jacobsen .says. Under a low-pow- ered microscope, the tiny white flowers of the small green plant can be seen to have six yellowish sta- mens at their center. In the mutant plants, however, there can be a dozen or more stamens. \There's probably no advantage to the plant for this mutation,\ Jacobsen says. urn fact, the plant is somewhat sterile.-Butthe \Clark Kent mutations\ have allowed us to understand how methylation can affect this gene.\ Methylation has been a topic of interest to biologists for sometime because it is apparently a compo• nent of cell memory which allows divided cells to have the same states of gene activity as the par- ent cells. In mammals~ methylation also seems to play a key role in the inactivation of one of the two X- chromosomes present in females. \Mutants that reduce methylation overall seem to result in overniethylation of the superman gene, for reasons we don't under- stand,\ says Jacobsen. \But ifwe can learn to control methylation in the plant, then it's possible that we could use it to control gene expres- sion.\ There may be little advantage to regulating this gene, Jacobsen says. On the other hand, there could be considerable payoffs in both medicine and agriculture. For example, certain cancerous tumors have been associated with overmethylation of genes. A greater understanding of me- thylation at the cellular level could perhaps be exploited for medical ap- plications, Jacobsen says. A better understa!lding of me- thylation in plants could have ap- plications for agriculture. The plant Arabidopsis has no real usefulness outside the lab, but the ability to manipulate its methylation could likely be extended to other plants. Since plants often reject genes that scientists have inserted, the cur- rent research could also lead to protocols for overriding the rejec- tion. This would be ,a significant advancement for biotechnology. \The important discovery is the methylation itself,\ Jacobsen says. \Our strategy now is to use Arabidopsis as a model genetic system to identify and eventually isolate the genes in the methyla- tionpathway. \Once you've id-entified the genes and studied thiem in detail, you can begin to control them.\ Source: Caltech Homepage called the \btood of Christ.\ Al- though throughout its over 2, 600 year old history St. John's Wort has mostly been used as a \nerve tonic,\ scientists today recommend it as an antidepres~ sant. By adjusting the chemical balance in the brain, St. John's Wort improves a de- pressed person's thought process. Scientists feel its anti viral qualities may help combat AIDS. Physicians strongly advise against tak- ing St. John's Wort in addition to or in substitution of other anti depressants. Kava kava is named · after its discoverer Captain James Cook. Herbalists have used kava kava for over 3, 000 years as a seda- tive. Some herbalists currently use the herb as a substitute for aspirin to reduce pain. Although kava kava sharpens the ability to focus, relaxes the body, an<! allows for restorative sleep, an overdose can distort con- centrati<>n. Ginseng, the most famous Chi- nese herb, has provided medicinal benefits for over 7000 years to China, North Korea, Japan, and now the United States. It relaxes the body, sharpens the senses, and increases immunity. Placing it in nearly all prescriptions, Chinese herbalists stand by ginseng stead- fastly as they believe it can cure respiratory problems, shrink tu- mors, and minimize the effects of aging. GinkgoBiloba, the oldest living tree, has survived for nearly 200 million years thanks to the Chinese monks. Like ginseng, ginkgo biloba is believed to enhance memory, bol- ster energy, and diminish the ef- fects of the aging process by im- proving blood circulation in the brain. Doctors now hope to use ginkgo biloba to aid in organ trans- plant acceptance and to relieve asthma. Bringing Video to the Home PC by Dan Kelmanovich Staff Writer The evolution of the computer and its enhanced processing power has provided an increased ability to hand.le video images. The processing of full motion, 30 frame per second video requires massive computing power. The 286's of the past lacked this power but new processors are al- lowing users to manipulate and record their own video on their home PC. Mmydigital video cam- eras exist which can capture images and video into a PC. These earn eras vary according to input method, cost, and quality. The easiest camera to install is the parallel port camera. This camera runs off of power from the key- board port a11d plugs into the par- allel port to transfer the informa- tion. This easy connection sacri- fices some video quality and speed. Other video cameras require a special video capture card to be installedinthecomputer. This card is not overly expensive; but it does greatly impr()ve video quality. Some of these cards can also uti- lize a comm<>n video camera by using regular analog cables to con- nect the camera. The last type of video capture device is connected directly into a PCMCIA port on a laptop. These video devices are fast and provide good quality video because of the speed of the PCMCIA port. One of the most popular parallel port cameras is the Connectix Color Quickcam 2. This video camera at- taches to the parallel port of the computer and provides images of upto640x480pixels in 24-bitcolor. The quality of the images ar.e good, but sometimes frames are dropped due to slower transfer speeds. The camera can handle up to 30 frames per second, depend- ing on the computer attached, but usually captures at slightly less. The camera also includes a manual focus that allows focusing from one inch toinfmity,a5.7mm lens with 46° viewing angle, elec- tronic zoom, and a tripod socket. The camera costs about $150 de- pending on the model. Other video cameras include the Panasonic Egg Cam which requires a video capture card and the Cre- ative Labs Quick Cam. Intel also makes a video camera named Proshare which requires a capture card but provides better quality than most of the other cameras. All ()fthese cameras provide the ability to do video conferencing by using l11ternet phone type pro- grams. Any ofthese cameras pro- vides more than adequate perfor- mance for video conferencing and allow the common PC user to add video to their computer.

Ginkgo Biloba. the uldest li\ ing tree, has survived for nearly 200 million years thanks to the Chinese monks. Like ginseng, ginkgo bi lob a is believed to enhance memory, bol- ster energy, and diminish the ef- fects of the aging process by im- proving blood circulation in the brain. Doctors now hope to use ginkgo bi loba to aid in organ trans- plant acceptance and to relieve asthma. Bringing Video to the Home PC by Dan Kelm:tnl{)vich Staff Writer The evolution of th(;! computer and its enhanced pr<Jcessing power has provided a11 increased ability to handle video images. The processing of full motion, 30 frame per second video requiTes massive computing power. The 286's ofthe past lacked this power but new proce!;sors are al- lowing users to manipulate and record their own video on their home PC. Many digital video cam- eras exist which can c.apture images and video into a PC. These cameras vary according to input method, cost, and quality. The easiest camera t<J ill stall is the parallel port camera. 'This camera runs off of power from the key- board port and pl11gs into the par- allel port to transfer the informa- tion. This easy wn11ection sacri- fices some video quality and speed. Other video cameras require a special video capture card to be · installed in the comp~ter. This card is not overly expensive, but it does greatly improve video quality. Some of these caFds can also uti- lize a common videD camera by using regular analog c:ables to con- nect the camera. TfJe last type of video capture device :is connected directly into a PCM C lA port on a laptop. These video(] devices are fast and provide good quality video because of the speed of the PCMCIA port. One ofthe most popular parallel port cameras is the Connectix Color Quickcam 2. This video camera at- taches to the parallel port of the computer and provides images of up to 640 x 480 pixels in 24-bit color. The quality of the images are good, but sometimes frames are dropped due to slower transfer speeds. The camera can handle up to 30 frames per second, depend- ing on the computer attached, but usually captures at slightly less. The camera also includes a manual focus that allows focusing from one inch to infinity, a 5.7 mm lens with 46° viewing angle, elec- tronic zoom, and a tripod socket. The camera costs about $1 SO de- pending on the model. Other video cameras include the Panasonic Egg Cam which requires a video capture card and the Cre- ative Labs Quick Cam. Intel also makes a video camera named Proshare which requires a capture card but provides better quality than most of the other cameras. All of these cameras provide the ability to do video conferencing by using Internet phone type pro- grams. Any ofthese cameras pro- vides more than adequate perfor- mance for video conferencing and allow the common PC user to add video to their computer. ~~~------~--~--~~----~----~------~ '' ...

1 I I ' / t: ' r l t ; ' ' 1,1 t i Communi Union College students, both Greeks and independents have of- ten been involved in philanthropic events, giving hundreds ofdol- lars to local and national organizations .. Additionally, the college community has often worked together with the City ofSchenectady in the attempt to better the surrounding areas of the College. We Care About U Schenectady, a~ on\campus organization, devotes many Saturdays. du~ing the year to both razing andre building homes in Schenectady's impoverished areas. Union's Big Broth~rs and Big Sisters allow for younger neighborhood children to .enjoy them- selves both during the week and on the weekends with a student who is willing to take time to talk and play with their younger brothers and sisters. Still, other students volunteer at the Zoller Elementary School, serving as lunchtime aides and helping stu- dents to learn to read and write. This past weekend, Union students donated $6,500 (forget abou! .the cost of the Fashion Show to the College community} to the Make a Wish Foundation, a charity that. grants terminally ill chil- dren a chance to go somewhere or do something special This coming weekend, Sigma Delta Tau and Kappa Sigma are collect- ing donations. for the Diabetes Research Fund and are planning a walk around Crossgates Mall this weekend to raise even more funds for the organization. Union students, as demonstrated by the largeturnout at the Fash- ion Show and by the number of donations for the benefit of the Diabetes Research Fund, are committed to donating money to char- ity. However; as demonstrated at Monday night's City Council meet·ing, many surrounding area residents, including the members .of the \Triangle Association,\ feel that Union students add noth- ing to the community and care only about themselves. What this gt:oup of enraged people do not seem to realize is that without Union, the surrounding community is nothing. Ignore the fact that many of these residents collect rent from students who live just off-campus in apartments on Gillespie Street, University Avenue~ and Union Avenue. Union students often provide their sons and daughters with after school help and spend time with them through the aforementioned programs. We, as Union College students, will always be-the victims of criticism from the surrounding community. However, we must remember that we provide an economically depressed City of Schenectady with some enjoyment. The college community should continue to get involved in the aforemention.ed community. service activities and continue to give money and have events supporting various charities. Regardless of the berating attacks that we may receive, Union students are helping to light the eyes of a child some- where, and that is 'ble for critics to take away. \\ I c __..' '2 weeks .p r~~-----......- Inactive Activities?~ By Peter Simon Op·ell Editor As a proudmernber of the Class of 1998, I write to the Union College students, urging all of you to wake up a11d take a stand against your so calle!l ••class leaders\ and administrativ~ orficials. Union College over the past four years has gone fr()m an institution for students to gain academic knowledge ;and to promote self- expression, to a place where brainwashing tactics are forced upon the st11dents by the Union College Adm illistration. Looking at events which have occurred on campus from 1995 to the present, Jt is clear tfuat there is a serious problem witiJthose in charge of the planning of studentactiv itics. I am referring to the Student forum as a whole in C()njunction with the Student Activities Office, whom have taken :it u·pon themselves to entertain the: a.dministration before the Students. Let me relllihd.you that we, the students, sl1ould be your main concern. We are the ones paying . . top dollar to receive a quality well- rounded education. Well-rounded is referring.t~ the ultimate college experience, which includes a stimulating ~ducation during the week; and a stimulating social life on the we~:~cnd. I don't \\'ant to w~ke up one morning and find the only thing I look. forward tu is eating a haU-cook.ed, ridden with food poisoning. chicken fajita al Dutch Hdllow because the Administration and the Student Forum have taken the privilege of planning the rest of my college weekends with boring events. We look to our student body leaders in confidence that they will bring events to our campus that will satisfy the desires of a majority of the student popu \ation. Unfortunately, many of those lea:ders are situated on the Student Forum, and those members have been prostituting themselves to the Administration for the past two ye.ars, leaving us, the students, \High and Dry\ to say the least. You may say I don't know what I am talking about, yet I have had the opportunity in coordinating events with other students at this school, and it seemed with every step taken in pi ann ing, there was a little voice that went off in the back o.f our heads, \What's the Administration going to think?\ Well, guess what, its this type of questioning that prevents Union fro1n ever gaining notoriety around the country, because the students are being opprc:;scd. These arc our four years, not theirs. So let's live itup to the extreme, because we've ca\n hitched ourselves a ride on a one-way street called Life, and there's no place for U-turns. My point is not to put an end to Student Activities events, but rather change the events that arc being offer~d. We need events that w illlcavc us missing \:ollcgc when its over. A<:.. of now I am not going to 111iss anything thJt the Stud:nt Activities Office has produced in my four years here. When I look back at my college social activities I' II rem em her traveling off- campus to see concerts at SPAC, the Palace Theater, and Skidmore, I'll remember the craziness of Spring Break, and I'll remember the fraternity parties. This may sound biased because of my role on campus, but we really need more concerts at Union, I mean that is what college students talk about these days. People ask me, \What bands have come to your school?\ I still answer, \uh The Samples .... but we had a Midwinter's Night Thing, and a Gala where we aH acted like forty year olds who had forgotten their childhood.\ Perhaps a giant Union College Rave would besomething to look into, that would at least better represent our current student body. Don't get me wrong, SA has not done everything poorly. 1 fee 1 The Party In The Garden is a very successfu I e.vcnt for <~11 students, for anytime you mix booze, music, and a wooded area where one can go off and smoke a heated blunt. you cannot lose. So let's face it, we need events that represent om gencrc:ttion, not the generation of the Administration.

I I 'l 'i OPJED·· · ,. ,,,,, .. --}.\ .... -·'-'<~.'''\'\ _,.,, Union Benefits The Communi Union Cot:lege students, both Greeks and independents have .of- ten been involved in philanthropic events, giving hundreds of dol- lars to local and national organizations. Additionally, tire college commulil ity has often worked together with the City ofSchenectady in the attempt to better the surrounding areas of the Col!lege. We Care About U Sd1enectady, an on-campus organization, devotes many Saturdays during the year to both razing and rebuilding homes in Schenectady's impoverished areas. Union's Big Brothers and Big Sisters allow for younger neighborhood children to enjoy them- selves both durin.g the week and on the weeker:~ds witn a student who is wi !ling to take time to talk and play with their younger brothers and sisters. Still, other students volunteer at the Zoller Elementary School, serving as lunchtime aides and helping stu- dents t() learn to read and write. This past weekend, Union students donated $6,500 (forget about the cost of the Fashion Show to the College community) to the Make a Wish FoundatioH, a charity that gra11ts terminally ill chil- dren a chance to go somewhere or do sornething special. This coming weekend, Sigma Delta Tau and Kappa Sigma are collect- ing donations for the Diabetes Research Fund and are planning a walk around Crossgates Mall this weekend to raise even more funds for the organization. Union students, as demonstrated by the large turnout at the Fash- ion Show and by the number of donations for the benefit of the Diabetes Research Fund, are committed to donating money to char- ity. However, as demonstrated at Monday night's City Council meeting, many surrounding area residents, including the members of the \Triangle Association,\ feel that Union students add noth- ing to the community and care only about themselves. What this group of enraged people do not seem to realize is that without Union, the surrounding community is nothing. Ignore the fact that many of these residents collect re11t from students who live just off-campus in apartments on Gillespie Street, University Avenue, and Union Avenue. Union students often provide their sons and daughters with after school help an<l spend time with them through the aforementioned programs. We, as Union College students, will always be the victims of criticism from the surrounding community. However, we must remember that we provide an economicalty depressed City of Schenectady with some enjoyment. The college community should continue to get involved in the aforementioned commurtity service activities and continue to give money and have events supporting various charities. Regardless of the berating attacks that we may receive, Union students are helping to light the eyes of a child some- where, and that is impossible for critics to take away. ..

By Peter Simon Op-ed Editor As a proud member of the Class of 1998, I write to the Union College students, urging all of you to wake up and take a stand against your so called \class leaders\ and administrative officials. Union College over the past four years has gone from an institution for students to gain academic knowledge and to promote self- expression, to a place where brainwashing tactics are forced upon the students by the Union College Administration. Looking at events which have occurred on campus from 1995 to the present, it is clear that there is a serious problem with those in charge of the planning of student activ itics. I am referring to the Student Forum as a whole in conju11ction with the Student Activities Office, whom have taken it upon themselves to entertain the administration before the Students. Let me remind you that we, the students, should be your main conccm. We arc the ones paying top dollar to recci vc a quality well- rounded education. Well-rounded is referring to the ultimate college experience, which includes a stimulating education during the week, and a stimulating social life on the •~ eckend. l don't want to wake up one morning and find lht.: only thing 1 look. forward to is eating a half-cooked, ridden with food poisoning. chKken I~IJita at Dutch llolloV~~ because the Administration and the Student Forum have taken the privilege of planning the rest of my college weekends with boring events. We look to our student body leaders in confidence that they will bring events to our campus that wiU satisfy the desires of a majority of the student population. Unfortunately, many of those leaders are situated on the Studt'mt Forum, and those members have been prostituting themselves to the Administration for the past two years, leaving us, the students, '\High and Dry\ to say the least. You may say l don't know what I am talking about, yet I have had the opportunity in coordinating events with other students at this school, and it seemed with every 5tcp taken in planning, there was a I ittle voice that went off in the back of our heads, \What's the Administration going to think?\ Well, guess what, its this type of questioning that prevents Union from ever gaining notoriet) around the country, becau~e the students arc being oppressed. The~c arc our four years, not theirs. So let's li\.e it up to the extreme, because we 'vc each hit~.:hcd ourselves a ride on a one-way street called Life, and there's no plm:e for U -turns. My point i!l not to put an end to Student Acti\ ities C\ c11b, btl\ rather change the C\ enb that <ll·e being offered. We need events that will leave us mi::.singcollege v.hl.'n ib over. As of no\\ I am not going to miss an) thing that the Student Activities Office has prodt~~.:cd in my four years here. When I look back at my college social activities I'll remember traveling off- campus to see concerts at SPAC, the Palace Theater, and Skidmore, I'll remember the craziness of Spring Break, and I' II remember the fraternity parties. This may sound biased because of my role on campus, but we really need more concerts at Union, I mean that is what college students talk about these days. People ask me, \What bands have come to your school?\ I still answer, \uh The Samples ... but we had a Midwinter's Night Thing, and a Gala where we all acted like forty year olds who had forgotten their childhood.\ Perhaps a giant Union College Rave would be something to look into, that would at least better represent our current student body. Don't get me wrong, SA has not done everything poorly, I feel The Party In The Garden is a very successful event for all students, for anytime you mix booze, music, and a wooded area \\here one can go off and smoke a heated hlunt. you cannot lose.

None of us want to Qf like to ad- mit thatwe have any weakness but the truth is, we all do. It is about self-improvement, people!

By the end of last weekend, I was still as puzzled as ever as to why Union was no longer the happy place it had once bel)n. Then, the other night it hit me like a ton of bricks. I had something of a satori, a sudden enlighten- ment, ifyou will. This is what I came up with. I want to tackle each of these as I have experienced them in the last several weeks. We, as a college, don't seem to be able to laugh any- more. Every action has some se- cret meaning behind it. Each re- mark is turned into a hot poker aimed towards the heart. Students have the impression that there ate assassins lurking around each and·every comer with a knife made up of a diatribe. I, Eugene Schultz, state that this is really not the case. Union College, relax. Not everyone is out to get you! Not every remark, joke, or parqdy is aimed at you or at you1' expense. No matter what we like to think, none of us here are the center of the solar system. It is sad but true, the center of the solar system, as far as. I know, is still the Sun. Yes, the Sun - some 93 million miles from Schenectady. Now that you have all recovered from that shock let me continue. . Laughing, some smart person once said, is tbe best medicine. People, thatis most Likely the best piece of advice that you will ever get from my article, so taRe it to heart. The last problem not only causes the most problems, but it is the one that gets my goat every time I see it happen. I will repeat it one more time just so that you all get a clue out there in Lalala land. There is no need, none whatso- ever, to act any older than were- ally are. We are all still either teen- agers or have just turned into young adults. I don't need some one who is one year older than me acting like he is 30 years my se- nior. You're.not, so give it up. We are young; have fun, cut loose, smoke a bowl,J don't care just stop acting like you have the weight of the world onyour shoulders. When it comes down to it, you don't, OK?

CARTMAN: Screw you, you piece of crap. Like you Wells people don't haze people. Dude, like people really would do community ser- vice ,without being forced to. Ask Stan, he was forced to do it during orientation in the fall. STAN: That's right dude, I'd never clean crap up in the streets if someone didn't make me. CARTMAN: Yeah, community service sucks. KYLE: Dude, if community service and helping people is so lame, why were you begging to get in the fashion show to raise money for a charity? What about it fatty? You fraternities don't do anything good unless forced to when the \man\ starts coming down on you threaten- ing to take away your lame-ass houses. CARTMAN: Ah, screw you Kyle. If it wasn't for us, you theme house geeks wouldn't have anyplace to party. KYLE: Hey Cartman, wily don't you do a walkathon or something ... not only can you raise money for charity but you can lose some weight. CART MAN: Man, your really pissing me off goddamit! STAN: Shut up you dum bass Cartman. We need more beer already. (KNOCK KNOCK] KYLE: Dude, its security eh! CARTMAN: Oh.sh**! [Security enters] SECURITY OFFICER BARBRADY: Ah, there are more than two people here. This is a social event and you're not registered. You're also losing a game of pong to an independent freshman. Your an em- barrassment to any Greek. Your house is now on probation and Kyle, your house is guilty by association. You can only shovel one driveway a week for the next month now. [Leaves] KYLE: That sucks, dude. Not only did we not get to finish the game of pong, now my house has no place to drink on the weekends. Plus, we can only shovel one driveway a week instead of the usual five. · CARTMAN: Not only that, now my house has nobody to coordi- nate community service events with us. Dude, this school sucks. KYLE: Dude, I learned something today. I learned that us theme houses and independents need fraternities to provide us with a social scene, while fraternities often depend on us theme houses to coordinate events with them. - We both need each other. You provide an essential service to the school plus provide the manpower in community service events that we cannot do completely by ourselves, no matter how many events we plan. . Not only that, I learned that one does not need to be a member of a fraternity to get free alcohol. You may be pressured to do community service, but you do do them, and that's what matters most of all. CART MAN: Dude, I learned something too, I learned that too many vodka shots can se~d you to Ellis and really fu** you up. I wish Kenny realized that earlier. STAN: Dude, this is pretty fuc*** up right here. You guys are get- ting along huh? Hey, where's Wendy? I can't believe that the Olympics are over.

In talking to people around campus (and some alumni), not one person knew who she was. I found one kid who said that he thinks that he might have saw here once, but no one remembers hav- ing a class or conversation with her. So my point is that this is a small campus where everybody knows everyone else and every- thing about them, so why doesn't anyone know her? She was here from 1989-1997 and no one knew who she was until last week. I just thought that I would bring that to everyon~'s attention as being a little bit strange. I am out oftime already. And I don't have anythmg else to say this week so this worked out kind of nicely. Oh, one more quick thing, l decided that I would like to know what my readers think of my ar- ticles (kind of like David Kay, ex- cept the whole campus doesn't want to see me dead). So send let- ters and envelopes containing cash to Box #2037. KYLE: Dude, I think she took off with all the J. Crew clothes after . being in the fashion show.

Star ship Troopers Due tiJ .technicaldiffkult ies, we were unable to review one of the many movies released this week- .::h'~E;;;,\Y!'+\i:~ end Instead, we have decided to dedicate this entire column to the promotion Q/J.heFilm Committee's Movie of the Wee/(, Starship Troop- ers. In a term of great movies in the Coltege Center auditorium, this is the one which thrives on no · name actors, special effects and blood. Next week, for our final . review ofWinter Term '98,. we will be reviewing the highly antici~ · paled Dark City, starring Kiefer Sutherland. In the future, Earth is ruled as a technicallyadvanced Federation in which citizenship is granted only · to those who have served in the Federation's armed forces. Having united the planet under a single form of govemme11t, the Federation turns its eyes to the stars. Earth begins to send expeditions out to find planets suitable for coloniza- tion. Unfortunately, Earth's ships corrie too close to a planet inhab- ited by gigantic space bugs. FJ:·om across the galaxy, these space bugs attempt to rid their 'pest' problem by slinging asteroids at Earth. Meanwhile back on Earth, a group of teens from Buenos Aires have just graduated from high school. With the ambitions ofbe- coming a fu II fledged citizen, each decides to join up with the Fed- eration and fjght the bugs. This tight group of teens include Johnny Rico (Casper Van Dien), Dizzy Flores(Dina Meyer), c;annen Ibanez (Denise Richards), and Carl Jenkins (Neil Patrick Harris, a.k.a. Doogie Howser, M.D.). Rico and Flores are assigned to the Mobile Infantry, the s<Jidiers who go ground zero against tfie bugs. Ibanez is sent offto become· a pilot and Jenkins, having tested posi- tive for psychic powers, goes off to read bug minds. Starship Troopers is split into two halves. The first hour is de- voted to the development of the young protagonists who joined the Federal army right out ofhigh school with high hopes and aspi- rations. Johnny Rico is the riehkid who goes against his parents' wishes by following Carmen Ibanez, his girlfriend who dreams ofbecoming a pilot. A love triangle (or is it a square?) develops when Carmen dumps Johnny for Zander Barcalow (Patrick Muldoon). an- other pilot, and Johnny begins de- veloping feelings for Dizzy Flores (Dina Meyer), the girl Who's had a .crush <>n him since their high school days. This amounts to sixty minutes of a cheezy melodramatic rehash of any and every episode of902!0or Melrose Place shown, complete with bad dialogue, bad acting, and slow pace. Nothing in the first half really amounts to any- thing. The second half of' the movie is where the action begins to pick up. Ani DiFranco's Ne-w- ~ . Little Albutn by Mat Barry WRUC Music Director Self-mademusician/woman Ani DiFranco has just released her ninth album of the decade titled, Littl~ Plastfc Castle. This album shows no sign that DiFranco is los• ing her touch with music. Little Plastic Castfe has several tracks that will see radio airplay and may possibly earn DiFranco a return trip to the Grammy' s. As Andy Langer states from MTV, \DiFranco ttnnsher rage into range and self angst into self con- sciousness\ on Little Plastic Castle. DiFranco, like in previous records, writes songs about her- self and self-related instances/ex ... '))eriences. Many ()fthe songs fea~ . ture the same acoustic ballads with a small touch of ska. Lyrically, DiFranco uses the same technique that has made her popu- lar with angry yet refined w<>rds that touch the 1 istener. Tunes sue h as Deep Dish show a different ex- perimental side to DiFranco. Some -of the notable songs on the album are Pixie, Fuel, and Loom. One song, Pulse~ is four- teen minutes long and features ()fie simple chorus. Overall, it is a good album; typical Ani DiFranco mu- sic. Tfyou like DiFranco's style you will enjoy this record put out by this Righteous Babe, which coin~ cidenta11y happens to be the name ofher label. Questions? Comments?

After Buenos Aires has been de- stroyed by the bug asteroids, tile gang is sent off to war. The bugs attacking are just amazing and tbe interaction between the bugs and 'humans are seamless. The only preblem is that the battles get old quickly as the movie adopts a cycle: Humans attack, bugs coun- . terattack, humans retreat, startover again. Also, one can not help but wonder during the &econd hairs battles: Why don't we just nuke them? Where are the tanks, heavy artillery and afr support? Maybe it is just more fun to fight it out Aliens-style with high power ma- chine guns and rocket launchers that blow the bugs to slimy green pieces one at a time. Director Paul Verhoeven, known for such films as RoboCop, Basic Instinct, and. Total Recall, may have salvaged his career with this movie, following his $40-millioR flop entitled Showgirls. With that single movie, Verhoeven had tumed from a star director into a laughing stock ofthe film world. With the $100-million budget on Starship Troopers, Verhoeven could have shared Kevin Costner~s fate following the $100-million do I· lar disaster, Waterworld However, instead of spending money find- ing pairs of breasts, as in Showgirls, Verhoeven invests the. money in special effects, and then finds cheap, no name actors. This was an ingenious move, as the computer graphics are by fru: the best part of the film, There are hordes of ten,..foot spider,..Iike arachnid warriors,, with their click- ing legs and ra~oPsharp talons are a sight to behold, swatrning across the mountains in a seemingly end- less wave. The battle scenes on land· ~re filmed in rapid fife wnich throws vicious gore at us fro:n1. aU angles,. but never stops to contemplate it. No bonesaboutit,Starship Troop- ers is one ofthe more violent mov- ies to come out in recent years. So. much is happening so fast, how- ever, there is no cllance to think about it. People die bythe thou- sands at the hands of the bugs, and death is never pretty. Yet, like RoboCop, Verhoeven invests a gruesome thrill aspect to the vio • lence, so there is almost a feeling of being let down ifs<;Jmeone dies a less-than-grisly death. The fact that most of the characters are one-dimensional .gives us the added benefit of not feeling too bad when they become Insect fod- der. Based on the famous sci-fi novel by Robert A. Heinlein, Starship Troopers is carefully constructed to appeal to the .rambunctious, devil-may-care 12 year old boy in all of~s. It is not, howe.ver, appro- priate for 12 year old boys. Loud, garish, and full ofspurting blood, disemboweling, dismemberments, and beheading, Starship Troopers is like a nonstop video game as- sault on the senses. Once it gets going, it does not st{)p t<> look back or even take a breath. So if you are looking for a way to unstress be- fore ninth week; and want a good, no brain required action packed movie, this is the o11e for you. · Photo by DaljdM~didliavtfC Scene from Two Gentlemen of Verona: Now p1ay1ng at the Yulman Theatre • I p Thi: Chet's Bryan recent ist in I 'Troy, honor .on th~; ing M of the launel turn (www Sin1 theBe WAN Recot Local Reser at UUi thenc mas c Apart Carll WCF ber19 fill~ ofP enst: Tl D incl arne figu

Some have argued that the s<~ngwriter is the love child of the Artist Formerly Known as Prince and Jorti Mitchell There is ,no cort- ctet¥ evidence to support this theory other than the funky, folky music, or; as he likes to call it, the \feHne~ funky,jungle,jazzy, sexy, slippery solo acoustic.'; This Wc;dne~day, March 4 1 h, Chet's presents singer/songwriter Bryan Th~>mas.

He admires the detachmentshe can achieve even in intensely per., sonal songs.

Basketball Surprise Season Closes at 11-140 By FrankS. Rossi StaffWriter While the Union College Shoot- . ing Dutchmen will not make the playoffs again this season, it is app11opriate to say that they played one hell of a season. Last week, they finished their 1997-1998 campaign with a minor stumble, losing games to Micl<llebury, nationally • ranked St. Lawrence, and Clarkson. Sophomore Dave · Copdand had a car.eer . week forthe Dutchmen as he scored double digits in ali three games. Against Middlebury, Copeland scored 11 points and grabbed eight rebounds forthe Dutchmen. How- ever, Middlebury dashed the Dutchmen's waning hopes for an ECAC layoff slot by beating them 85- 69. The non-league loss . moved the team back be- low .500to 11-12. JuniorRobGroelz scored 15 points to lead Union, and senior Rob TeCarr contributed 13 of !tis own. Copeland came back three days later last Friday as he pitched in another l2 points against nation- ally ra!lkedSt. Lawrence. For the second season in·a row, the Dutch- men plaredthe Saints tough in the Saints' 1()\7/n gymnasium, playing to a two·J>Oillt deficit at halftime. 6 and assured that the Dutchmen could not finish at or above .5()0 overall.

The Dutchmen's. 11-14 season may be disappointing to some as the team surged during the midseason, but failed to fully carry their momentum into the . final few weeks of the season. However, their 11 wins are the most since their 12-win season in 1994·1995, and their five league wins are the most in their short UCAA history.

Union opened up the game with a 15-0 run and Women Winning at Home by Brian Terlinsky Sports Writer The Skating Dutchwomen were back on their home ice this past weekend, facing-off against the tough club teams of UMass- Amherst on Friday, and Boston University on Saturday. Coming off two big wins against b<>th Skidmore and Clarkson; Union ..vas detennined to extend their wiming streak to four games. Unfortu- nately, the Dutch women were ()ll ly able to take one out of two games, as they lost hard to the Minutewomen; 6-l, but recovering the next day to beat a solid Terrier team, 3·2. On Friday, it was the battle of the maroon and whites at Achilles _ Rink, as both Union and UMass skated with their respective·CO,l()rs of their schools. Team UMass, ..vbo is one of the best club teams i11 the tial, Union was ready to strike hard and fast, as they did. Union fresh- man Ali Trownbridge was the first to hit the scoreboard, as Union took an early lead 1-0 in the first period. Suddenly, the tone ofthe game had been turned around for Union, from the moment of the opening face-off iri the second period. It was now UMass who dominated the game, as they scored 4 goals in this rough period, taking a 4-1 lead. Heading into the third, Union was in trouble oflosing their third con- secutive home game. Despite the goals scored, junior goalie Lauren Locke made some key saves, help- ing Union to keep the score close for a third period comeback . Union's response in the final pe- riod would not be enough, as the game would eventually end with Union losing by the score of 6-1. The loss was Union's first to a club league, consists of players rang- team, as the Skating Dutchwomen ing from freshmen to graduate stu- were very upset with their overall dents. The attendance at Achilles play in the game. was once again impressive, as the Some Union players felt this numbers of fans coming to cileer game was an incentive to \step it on the Dutchwomen have beenin- up\ against Boston University on creasing each game.

Skat- motivational factor to gear up for ing· and, playing upto.-their p()ten\'· ,, our next game against BU ,\junior forward Sara Moss said. To say Union was not pumped up for the Terriers on Saturday Would be· an understatement. Af- ter the tough lose on Friday, Union was ready to rebuild their winning streak. Union played with much intensity throughout the whole game, as did the team from Boston University. This was probably the best played game ofthe year for Union, as they sketted hard and put on an intense show for the crowd. The score was bounced back and fourth during the whole game, as when one team scored, the other quickly came back to tie it up. In the first period, Union freshman Michelle Stein cennected first, scoring for the Skating Dutchwomen. In the second period, BU would tie it up, sending both teams into the third period tied at one a piece. The third and final period would be the deciding factor for both teams, meaning whoever had the most strength, would win the game. Union sophomore Kristen owad took some tension off the team and coaches, as she put Union ahead early in the final pe- riod. But, once again, BU was able to keep up, as they tied it up with less then eight minutes remaining. It would be Moss, who would lead Union to victory. With only 33 sec- onds left in regulation, she put it past the BU goalie, which would be all Union would need to win. The 3-2 victory for the Dutchwomen really showed their passion for the game, as they kept into it, until the final seconds. \It was a really good game and we played very well too. Since we skated hard during the whole game, made it one of the most exiting games of the season,\ Stein said. Although Union was victorious, the game-wining goal scorer con- gratulated BU for their tough com- petitiveness. \Boston University was a very aggressive team. Even though we were better skaters, BU still was able to keep in the game, and made it a very competitive game,\ said Moss. The coaching staff was also de- lighted with. the win and felt the team played hard. \We played a great game against BU, who was an evenly matched team. We kept up our intensity throughout the game, especially in the third pe- riod, when we needed to make key plays,\ coach Tim Benson said. Union's next game will be home at Achilles Rink against Holy Cross University on Friday. while Russell Sage recovered to within ten witll eleven minutes re- maining, the Dutchwomen went on a 6-1 run, putting the game away for good. Erin McNamara also put forth a strong effort for Union, add- ing fourteen points to the total. This seventeen point victory pro- pelled Union through a solid three days ofpracticebefore making the trip to the north country to face rivals St. Lawrence and Clarkson. St. Lawre11ce 67- Union 56 The five hour bus ride up to St. Lawrence gave Union plenty of time to ponderwhat might happen when they face off with their rival. Union has not defeated St. Lawrence in their last ten meetings and most recently lost by eight when the two teams played here at Union a few weeks ago~ Unfortu- nately forthewome.n in Gamet and White, this meeting was no differ- ent than the previous ten. The effort put forth by Union was a valiant one as they nearly out rebounded St Lawrence. How- ever, Union gave up twenty offen- sive rebounds and from those re- bounds, St, Lawrence netted twenty points. Playing outstanding games for Union were Kathleen Furlong, Beth Perry, and Kelly Johnson. Furlong once again led the team in scoring with 28 points as she was 11 for 21 Co11tinued on page 25

Also having an outstanding meet was Jermel Royal in the weight throw and shotput. Royal threw for distances ofll.l4m and 13.02m respectively and put himself into contention to making states in the w·eight throw. Ben Blackwood had an excellent showing in the shotput throwing for a distance of 13 .40m, thus quali- fying him for states. Turning to the track, the men had an excellent well-rounded showing in the mid-distance events. First was Martin Knapp who was victo- rious in the 500m in a meet record time of 1:07.20. This time was two seconds under the state qualify- ing time and places Knapp in the top 6 in the state. Also victorious was junior Peter Flynn in the 3 <lOOm.

O.ne.oftheJ,igge$tdifferen'c~~ · between varsity and club teams, besides recognition (-i~e, Var$.ity Jett;~rs,. aW£\rd,s, and. press) is financial backing by the schOol. While some chtb tea:tris ge:tgoo<} :ti,lndi;ng.frol.ll Union, none get the funding varsity teams enjoy, and although som~.maythink that this isn't all that important, let me mention why I bringthis up, . · This past Saturday, the. indoor track team traveled to Ha~lton College to compete in tbe . annual Hamilton Invite {which all of you .can read about in Jason Everett; s article}. While the track team is composed ofm®y hard working athletes, the team has not been the most · successful in tecent years, especially in the men's throwing events. (since the graduatic:>n · of National Champ, Rich Pulver). Funding for the team, while adequate, is also not especia.lly overwhelming, and we often fmd ourselves borrowirlg JS~poundhammers (it's · a big ball with a handle for all those lacking track~lingo~oWledge) ;yld shotpu~ from other teams such as RPI and Hamilton. For one, it's embarrassing, and secondly, it's not easy to throw well with an- implement that you have never thrown before. We have also lacked the funds to buy good quality implements; whiclJ. shows in the rate at which we · break them (which is extremely high). This season, after we broke one or two hammers and · · our three shot puts were judged to be .illegal, head coach Larry Cottrell took it upQh . · ·himself to purchase a high quality shot put, a medium quality. practice h~mer, and a high • q1.mlity competition· hammer,. How much do these things <:ost? A l6~pound hard plastic · balJ shouldn ~t c_ost all that much,.right? Itset the team back $1391 Get to the point, I know. ·If has been:s;ince my· freshman year, with thethfowipg pheniml\'?:hon Ptilver blasti:ng • shotputs into places I couldn't hit-if I tm~w ittwiee, that a Up.ion thrower bas qpalified for the State. Championship (which is being held at Union on friday and Saturday ... so go . check it out) .. ·We entered Hamilton with one thrower,juniorJermel Royal, being preliminarily · qualified for the shot championship at 12.25 meters. After an amazing day of throwing, 1 . qualined provisionallywitbaPRofl2,91 meters, Roy~ll?etteredhimselfto aPRofl3.03 meters;· and sophomore Ben<fllackwood, blasted aPR of.l3AO meters to quali:fy.as well Three throw~rs set personal·records in one day, one betten~d his state standing and af:finned a more solid place at the championship and two qualified thathadn't even been all that close before. ,l am .not saying thatthe shot put tn:;tde .m,e a g9od thrower.. 1t was Coach Bowls who had a hand in making me a better one. It just goes .to show that good • funding spent the right way with goodcQaching.can make things happen. Although this was a long drawn out way to explain my point, good coaching alone can't do the job, you · 11eed the resources as well; which is why the support of club teams, both fmancially and by the campus community is crucial for a club team.'s succ~ss. It wasjust a thought. Notto take away from this week's In >The Spotlight... showcase,.I will move on to m:y . look atUn:iOn College's chib water polo team. Started hl1'9.89,by~Clifistoplier Walsh; the . water polo team has competed every faU and springf~r the past nine years. Described as · \a brutal game that requires endUr8!JCe enough to swim many 50 yard dashes, but at the . sametimeanunbelievable amount of team camaraderie and fun,\ by senior MattGlogowsk.i, . the team consists of about 10-16 peop-le, composed of both swim team members an<! regular students. 'They compete in two to fourtoumaments a season; which generally last a weekend and consistoQfthreeto five games a to\lmament. Having six people and a goalie . in the water at once can· often cause much confusion for. the untrained player, which is . why,. with the ·help of:colle.gt} funding (notice,the great tie m .... ) the team hired 1996 Hartwick .grad,uate, KeithMurtay, to help directthe t~am a11d coordinate a mwe powerful offense and defense. Murray, who ts tile founder of.Hatt:Wick's water polo :team, has helped tr~mendously in l)uilding team cohesiveness and strategy, according to Glogowski. '\Keith Mun::ay has really made quite a difference for the team and .has helped share tile . responsibility of directing us, which is a big help since he can see a lot more ofthe team out ofthe water than we can in it. It [Murray's hiring] also helps out freshmen and rookies because his grip·on the game is a gre~t one and his direction can help progress a new com- . ers confusion into skillmore quickly than we could before.\ As for competition, the team reaches fill' and wide across New Y orlc.state. As a member ofthe CWP.A(Collegiate Water Polo Association), Union faces RIT,. University of Roch- ester, RPI, Hartwick, Army, and Columbia. One of the most iqteresting facts thatone may have not known is th4t this club team isn't known as the men's water polq t~am. That is simply because the team is co~.ed. \Having four women on the team n;takes it a ver:y diverse· sport and really enhances the game,. I think,\ Glogowski said wlien asked about competing with and against women.

For N.C. State it wa<> like a national championship game. With their 15-11 record, the post season seems like a long shot, but with a proficient game against North Carolina they had a chance to prove they were still a formidable opponent. N ;C. State, led by CC Harrison's 31 points, looked as good as any top 25 team and stunned the number I Tarheels in Chapel Hill.. The Wolfpack got various contributions in their upset of the Tarheels.lshuaBenjamin scored 16 points and had 7 thefts while Kenny Inge added 16 points, 12 rebeunds and 4 blocks for State. They won in spite of making only 7 field goals in the second half including just 2 over the finall3:24. With State making twenty-seven of twenty eight free throws in the second half, the Tarheels couldn't mount a comeback. Despite solid. effot1s from Shamond Williams (23pts}and Antawn Jamison (20pts) North Carolina could not overcome Harrison's 8 of9 three point baskets and State's flawless shooting from the charity stripe. North Carolina did not expect much of a challenge from the Wolfpackarid they came out cocky. \I expected to just come out and beat this team,\ said Ed Cota Carolina's point guard. North Carolina's Antawn Jamison added, \Usually an N.C. State team will get rattled and things will turn around, but they did a terrific job.\ Carolina, whohadn't played in a week, fell a game behind league leading Duke in the ACC. While the Wolfpack won their national championship game Carolina learned they have to take everyone seriously on their road to the final four. Brand New Blue Devil While North Carolina spent.the weekend falling a game behind Duke in the ACC, Duke welcomed back Elton Brand, their leading scorer and rebounder. Brand, who has been out since December27 after breaking his foot, had been having a sensational fi:esllman season. Brand played only 16 minutes in Duke's 120·84 r.ornp of the number 12 ranked UCLA Bruins. However, Brand' spresence was obviously felt as he scored 14 points and grabbed 7 rebounds in a limited appearance. Duke got a career high 34 points from senior Trajon Langdon and 23 from Rosh own McLeod in their 36 point demolition of the Bruins. The victory returned Duke to the top of the polls for the third time this season. The return of Brand could not come at a better time. Although Duke lost only once in Brand's absence, his big body was sorely missed. In their loss against UNC their outside shot~ were not falling and they got little help on the inside. Had they had Brand's wide body in the paint it might have been a different story. Brand still must get back into playing shape, but has plenty of time before the NCAA tournament begins. He will get his first taste of the Tarheels this Saturday in the game of the week. Playerofthe Week Ruben Patterson, F, Cincinnati Thursday morning Ruben Patterson learned his mother died of a heart attack. Instead of joining his family, he felt the only way for him to cope with the death was to play against Alabama-Birmingham that night. After spending the entire day in tears, Patterson was ready for tip off. He scored a career high 32 points and hit three pointers. After each three pointer, he pointed to the ceiling as a gesture to his mother. Patterson inspired his team to a 93-76 victory and a first place tie in conference USA. Match,.. Up of the Week North Carolina @ Duke Saturday. February 28th Once again Duke enters the game as the number one team in the country. The Tarheels, who won 97~ 73 on February 5th, should have a much more difficult game this time around. With the return of Brand and Duke's home court advantage, North Carolina will find themselves facing a totally different Duke team. The game will not only have huge implications on the ACC standings, but also on the NCAA tournament. Botll teams seem destined for a number one seed, but only one team will be able to remain in the East. If Carolina can beat Duke twice the selection committee should reward them.by putting them in the East.

A Look at Non--Varsity Sports and Athletes By Pike Mody Before I get underway with this week's article, 1 would like to take a minute to point out something that came to my attention over the past week. One efthe biggest differences ·between varsity and club teams, besides recogllition (ie. varsity letters, awards, and press) is financial backing by the schooL While some club teams get good funding from Union, none get the funding varsity teams enjoy, and although some may think that this isn't all that important, let me mention why I bring this ttp. This past Saturday, the indoor track terun traveled to HamiltonCollege to compete in the annual Hamilton Invite (which all ofyou can read about in Jason Everett's article). While the track team is composed of many hard working athletes, theteam has not been the most successful in recent years, especially in the men's throwing events (since the graduation of National Champ, Rich Pulver). Funding for the team, while adequate, is also not especially overwhelming, and we often fmdourselves borrowing 35-poundhammers (it's a big ball with a handle for all those lacking track-lingo knowledge) and shotputs from other teams such as RPI and Hamilton. For one, it's embarrassing, and secondly, it's not easy to throw well with an implement that you have never tllrown before. We have also lacked the funds to buy good quality implements, which slwws in the rate at which we break them (which is extremely high). This season, after we broke one or two hammers and our three shot puts were judged to be illegal, head coach Larry Cottrell took it upon himself to purchase a high quality shot put, a medium quality practice hammer, and a high quality competition hammer. How much do these things cost? A 16-pound hard plastic ball shouldn't cost all that much, right? H set the team back $139! Get to the point, I know. It has been since my freshman year, with the throwing phenomenon Pulver blasting shotputs into places I couldn't hit if I threw it twice,. that a Urtion thrower has qualified for the State Championship (which is being held at Union on Friday and Saturday ... so go check it out). We entered Hamilton with one thrower,junior Jenne! Royal, being preliminarily qualified for the shot championship at 12.25 meters. After an amazing day of throwing, I qualified provisionally with aPR of 12.91 meters, Royal bettered himselfto aPR ofl3.03 meters, and sophomore Ben Blackwood, blasted aPR of 13AO meters to qualify as well. Three throwers set personal records in one day, one bettered his state standing and affirmed a more solid place at the championship and two qualified that hadn't even been all that close before. I am not saying that the shot put made me a good thrower. It was Coach Bow Is who had a hand in making me a better one. It just goes to show that good funding spent the right way with good coaching can make things happen. Although this was a long drawn out way to explain my point, good coaching alone can't do the job, you need the resources as well, which is why the support of club teams, both financially and by the campus community is crucial for a club team's success. It was just a thought. Not to take away from this week's in The Spotlight ... sh0wcase, I will move on to my look at Union College's club water polo team. Started in 1989 by Christopher Walsh, the water polo team has competed every fall and spring for the past nine years. Described as \a brutal game that requires end1:1rance enough to swim many 50 yard dashes, but at the same time an unbelievable amount ofteam camaraderie and fun,\by senior Matt Glogowski, the team consists ofabout 10-16 people, composed ofbotll swim team members and regular students. They compete in two to four tournaments a season, which generally last a weekend and consist of three to five games a tournament. Having six people and a goalie in the water at once can often cause much confusion for the untrained player, which is why, with the help of college funding (notice the great tie in ... ) the team hired 1996 Hartwick graduate, Keith Murray, to help direct the team and coordinate a more powerful offense and defense. Murray, who is the founder of Hartwick's water polo team, has helped tremendously in building tean1 cohesiveness and strategy, according to Glogowski. \Keith Murray has really made quite a difference for the te.am and has helped share the responsibility of directing us, which is a big help since he can see a lot more of the team out ofthe water than we can in it. It [Murray's hiring] also helps out freshmen and rookies because his grip on the game is a great one and his direction can help progress a newcom- ers confusion into skill more quickly than we could before.\ As for competition, the team reaches far and wide across New York .state. As a member of the CWPA (Collegiate Water Polo Association), Union faces RlT, University of Roch- ester, RPI, Hartwick, Army, and Columbia. One of the most interesting facts that one may have not known is that this club team isn't known as the men's water polo team. That is simply because the team is co-ed. \Having four women on the team makes it a very diverse sport and really enhances the game, I think,\ Glogowski said when asked about competing with and against women. He stated that \it's an opportunity that one doesn't often get in sports, and from my experiences with this team, that is really unfortunate.\ What a cool idea, I thought. We fmally have a team that combines both men and women in the same area of competition and it only helps the game. Often we find that men and women cannot compete well against each other becau.se of differences in size, speed, and strength. Although most people attribute these differences to men and thus make the game much more difficult for women to compete, this isn't always true. I can tell you that there were plenty of women in China thatcould have absolutely whipped my butt in Kung • Fu. Don't laugh guys, I'll bet they would have made most of us here cry before the reverse was true. I am not saying that your average 130 pound woman (relax I don'tmean that you . should weigh 130 pounds to be average, it's just a number that popped into my head) should put on the pads and go out for linebacker, but I thQught that this is a sport that . women can be very competitive in, both w'ith and against other women and men. That's · not something you see often, and it definitely adds a lot .of dimension to team spirit. I can tell you that traveling with the women's rugby team and the women's indoor track team is always a lot more fun than traveling without them. In any case, the ability for this type of . co-ed competition to exist at the college level is sometllingout of the ordinary, and there• fore I thought worthy of at least a little attention. Besides, this is not an .easygoing pick- up game anyway, let's not forget that.

SENIOR _CAPTAIN ROB TeCARR MEAN·S MORE THAN POINTS TO UNION COLLEGE'·s BA~SKETBALL GAME By Dana Murphy Sports Information Writer Schenectady, NY-As the only senior. on this year's basketball team, captain Rob TeCarr meant much more than points, rebounds and assists. The Bedford Hills na- tive came into his own this year and provided the young Dutch- men with experience, s,tability and leadership. While Union finished with a sub-.500 record (11·14), the Dutchmen won four games more than last year and had their most wins since the 12-win campaign of 1994-95. The Dutchmen looked to TeCarr all season for both his leadership and his play at the small forward position. He finished third on the team in scoring with a career-best 320 points, including a team-high 49 three pointers. TeCarr, who started all 25 games, finished with a 12.8 scoring average, fourth with his 3. 9 rebounding mark, and third in both assists (with 36) and steals (21) while averaging 33 minutes of playing time. T~Carr began playing basketball at a young age but it was not until his sophomore year of high school that he became serious about 1he sport.

The three-year letterwinner and co-captain from Calgary, Alberta, has been a key contributor this sea- son, serving as a leader as well as a top goal- scorer. With a young team that includes 12 freshmen and five sophomores, Moxham's experience and guidance has been ii1tegral to the development of the younger players and the team as a whole. It was not long ago that Moxham was a freshman hirnsel[ When he first arrived at Union in 1994, after playing two seasons for the Calgary Royals, he had never seen a college hockey game. That changed quickly for the Bishop Grandin (high school) gradu- ate as Moxham played in 29 games his rookie season on a Skating Dutchmen team that finished 9-16-4 overall, 6-12-4 and in 1Oth \place in the Eastern College Athletic Association's Division I standings. He was the leading rookie scorer with 14 points on five goals and nine assists, playing on the team's top line with Chris Ford, who went on to become Union's Division I all-time scorer. Moxham's early success came as a. surprise to him. \My freshman year was something that I never expected,\ he says. \Coming in, I wasn't sure if I [would] be able to compete at this level, but I got a lot of ice time and it went really well. I was really lucky to get all that experience.\ After the initial offensive success of his freshman year; Moxham spent the next two years as a more defensive- minded forward on a team heavy with up- perclassmen, His ice time diminished con~ snderably, and the great speed and work ethic that be had exhibited in his rookie campaign were used more defensively. He scored six points as a sophomore and only four points during his junior year. Moxham's struggles for ice time led him to focus in on academics. \After my second year I was starting to reevaluate things,\ he said. \I had put my focus into school, and the science course~ I was taking started to take up a lot oftime,\ says Moxham, who is a Geology/Environ· mental Science major. \When things with hockey weren'tgoing real well, I kind of fell back [to] school to keep me going.\ Moxham js devotion to academics has paid off for him. Last year he was named the '96- '97 Charles N. Morrison Award winner, . which is given to Union hockey who demo devotion .to the lege and to acatdeJnie achievement. \I began to about life hockey, about what wanted to prepar myselffor,\hesaid. While Moxham sti11 considering playing hoc~kev ation, he is also considering a career in the sciences. \I don't want to have to bank on playing hockey; I'm glad that here at Union I've prepared myselffor something else.' 1 Since the arrival of head coach Stan Moore last year, Moxham has felt revital- ized. \Stan has been a breath of fresh air,\ says Moxham. \He's very approachable and down to earth. He's like a kid at heart; he's always out there skating with us at practice, making the game fun.\ While last year Moore continued to play Moxham in a defensive role, this year he .has let Moxham loose on opposing goaltenders. With four games remaining in his career, Moxham has scored~ career-high nine goals (which equals his output for his previous three seasons), inc!udi11g cne shorthanded tally. While he has scoredj11st 36 points (18 goals and 18 assists):i:n no career games, if is Moxham's winingne:sst<l accept any role that has made him ln~o~a:ltJable to the Dutch- men during his career. \In terms of effort a:nd intensity Charlie has no equal in ho~ he approaches the game,\ said Moore, who was the first fresh· man coach named asthe ECAC' s \Coach of the Year'' last seasoll: Mo<Jre led the Skat· ing Dutchmen to a Schl()o!:..record 1 8-win sea· son in 1997-98 and a<f1fthplace ftnish in the league. \Charlie has been blessed with tre· mendous speed and tllat makes him a scor· · threat everytime a.v._, ... u·••\ the puck. the ·defensive his speed has nenoea to cover m is· made by our uncler1c:la:ss players.\ Moxham has \. ........ -., ing teams' n~'\'\'~ play, disrupt· the flow witb .,. ......... , 1ntoa breakaway scoring opportunity. '\Thebreakaways are something that I'm !l'e:ally proud of,\ says Moxham. \It's great for tile team when you can create those opp()ttunities which you otherwise wouldn'tlhflve. It's an ability I have, to use my spe~ed to create those op· portunities for the te:arn~ and I'm glad it's been productive fo:n.ISi. 1 ' Moxham's effortsha:veespe~ially paid off lately. He netted si\ g()als. within a six game span in January, whicih included two-goal outbursts at both Y~le: and Army. He also had a goal in each (){ 1J nioli • s league games with cross .. town rival Ile11ssa!aer. However, Moxham's bigg~st s~ote of the season came in November at sec()n(\-place when he tal• lied the game-tyinggoa.t Hiseffortwith four seconds left in regulation helped the Dutch .. men rally from a two-goal deficit with just over three minutes .left to play. This success is a direct result ofMoxham's unwavering work ethic and dedication. \That's always been how I've tried to define myself as a player, by my work ethic,\ he explains. \I really think that you get what you put into it. T've put in a lot ofeffort on the ice, and I'm benefiting as a player and as an indi· vidual aH the time.\ Moore is not only pleased at What his se- nior captain has brought to the Dutchmen · this year, he is impressed withthe way Charlie has led through example, both athletically and academically, throughout his career. \I feel strongly about Charlie both as a player and as a :person,\ stated Moore. \Charlie is not a big rah-rah type of player. He lets his hard work on and off the ice do the talking. He leads by example. Besides the amount of time he puts into hockey, he is successfully completing two majors and a minor. Charlie is an example that any one of our players can proudly follow.\ That attitude is rubbing off on this year's underclassmen. A large part of Moxham's role this year has been as a leader and men .. • tor to the younger players, as he is both a captain and the most experienced skater on the squad. \I may not be the most vocal of guys in the locker room, but Coach Moore .and I understand that my role is to lead by example,\ says Moxham. ''!just try to go out there and work as hard as l can.\ Moxham's been happy to be able to pass his experiences along, and to help the fresh· men develop as both players and students. \I've got some of the experience necessary irt order to answer their questiot1s and help them out, whether it be with ,hockey, or classes, or whatever else.

) ) . . Goodbye to a Legend and a Friend by Chris Leone Sports Editor The last week in the sports world was mis- erable. No, this was not bec;:ause of the Olym- pics or the failures .of the American men's hockey team. It has become so that when a bunch of drunk athletes trash a hotel there is not even a reason to blink an eye. The reason for the terrible week was that major leaguebaseball lost one of its most charis- matic people with the passing ofCubs an- nouncer Harry Caray. In a 162 .. game season, there needs to be humor.· When a $1 0 million athlete strikes out three times in a game and then benches himself after being booed, there needs to be humor. If a child asks for an autog~:aph and the hero turns the other way, you need to laugh. Caray made us laugh and let us en- joy the historic game without the garbage of the modem era. As the sun sets on this century of base- ball, one that Caray saw most of, changes are rapidly occurring, and maybe the sport is dying. With the ever-changing leagues, players, and teams, maybe th1s was a fitting time for Caray to depart, but only .if it had been under different circumstances. Whether or not you liked his broadcast style did not really matter. Yes, his off-the- field activities were at times questionable. However; the pure joy and excitement, simi,. lartoa c~ild at Christmas, thatCaray brought to each game will sorely be missed in a time when it Inay be needed the most. For over a century, baseball has been about characters. It has not always been about role models or the best players. The stories of those individuals who never make the show are sometimes far more captivat- ing than the gossip on the stars. Since its inception, baseball has been a game that tran- scended through time past on from father to son. Now that the ga111e.is in jeopardy and people claim that baseball is past its time, and no longer the past time. roug!l times. Two b110ken legs in 1968, a stroke i11 19S7, and fmall~ a collapse in 1994 could n()t stop him. After each battle, Caray came b<~ck. stronger and more dediCated to the ~port h.e loved an<! cherished. Like the game,. Caray yvas a warrior that had out-lasted time, <Jr so, it seemed. baseball fans, not only in Chicago, but all Only if the Cubs could have won a World over the world? Series. Only if a man who had given so much It was the fact that Catay was real. In the to so many could have received his biggest time ofhigh profile athletes with highly ob- wish to call a game with his son and grand- noxious attitudes, Caray was a regular Joe son. Only if life were longer, maybe even with average talent who loved a game. He perfect. But, the days of dreams are behind made it fun for the family ,to go to the ball baseball, and unfortunately behind us all, par.k or to just listen to the game on the tele- even Caray. vision. His nonsensical ramblings made the Carey will undoubtedly join the other mem- time between pitches seem relaxing, and his bers of Broadcasting Hall of Fame at that forgetful ways were representative of the eternal baseball game. With Red Barber and game. \!'v1el Allen beside him, Caray will have some \I really believe that the way 1 react to good company in the booth. I wonder if what goes on <luring a game, whether it's a they will let him sing. Maybe the dreams home run or an error or an umpire's call . . . still exist wherever he is. Caray was against those nay-sayers. Like the game, he had battled through some Fa111oU:S for the saying \holy cow,\ Caray's voice delighted baseball fans including White So:x and Cubs fans, for nearly 54 years. His seventh inning stretch version of \Take Me Out to the Ball Game\ is considered a classi~ tradition, but only 21 years old. His announcing skills often left a great deal to be desirecl, and his memory for players' name:s\~Were an atrocity at best. What was it the11ab()ut Caray that made him so loved by well, that's the way the guy in the bleachers It is time to go out and play catch, it is would react,\ Caray said. better that way. Why Penalty Shots? by David Weine:r With the integration of profes- sional hockey players into the Olympics, the men's ice hockey competition was supposed to be better than ever. The NHL stars were supppsed to bring excitement a11d splendor to an Olympic sport that already topped the list. The United States, Canada, and Swe- den all had Gold medal hopes and every team in contention help real- istic goals of bringing home a medal. Unfortunately, these highly an- ticipated games did not bring the action and excitement everyone was looking for. The United States was eliminated after only two games, both of which they lost by a large margin. The one game that was competitive, the Canada vs. Czech Republic semi-final game ended in the most boring fashion possible - a shoot-out. Olympic competition only comes about once every four years. When teams are playing with hopes of grasping the beloved Olympic Gold, no game should ever end with penalty shots. Let's think about this. Through sixty minutes of regulation play and five minutes of sudden death overtime, the Canadians and Czechs were dead locked. How- ever, if one noticed the pace of play closely, they would see that it was the Canadians who started slowly, but gradually built up their level of play, in the end dominating the Czechs. The Czechs, on the other hand, began quickly and tapered off as the game wore on, eventu- ally trying to waste time to reach in hopes of reaching the shoot-out. Now, what exactly does a shoot- out do? It ends a game more quickly than waiting for one team to score. This is seemingly the only purpose of a shoot-out. and this shoot-out is undoubtedly a game of chance andluck. A coach must pick five players he feels are the most capable of scoring on a goal tender protected only by the pipes he stands between. While some skill is required,. this is merely a gameofinches. Wh.e wantstowin the gold medal b'(!cause,just at th.e right momen:t, a member of your team got lucky and scored on a penalty shot? rllat is not the way to decide Olympic medals. Had that Ca11ada- Czech Repub- lic game traveled into a second overtime, there i.s n() doubt in my mind that Canacla would have es- caped victori{)US.. Throughout the first overtime period, they domi- nated the pace of play and any time the Czechs con:tr()lled the puck, they attemptetltovt.aste time, sim- ply passing it arou11d in the neu- tral zone, thlls preventing Canada from grasping; any more scoring chances. Hov.'ev er, at the same time, the Cz:eclls tlid not have a shot in the ov~rtime period. They were clearly c.<lotent with ending the game by way of penalty shots. Were this rule llOt .in effect, the Czechs would have been forced to attempt to score, tht1s opening the ice up for the C<~nadians who un- doubtedly vwul d have scored the next goal. Although tl1e Czechs won this game and we11t ()n to make for an entertaining Goldrnedal game with the Russians, it vvas disappointing to see this semi· :fi11al game end on such a boring n()te. Had penalty shots not be'Cn J)at1 of the gatne, the outcome wo11ld have been sig- . nificantly different, and more excit- ing. In fouryears,\.oVben the next win- ter Olympics rolls around, the rules committee sllould consider making this drastic chan.,ge to allow for more exciting, hard fought hockey games. Hoops Continued of six from three point range. The highest note for Union, however, was their turnovers. The team posted their lowest number oftum~ over this season with eight. Point --------- Spotlight Continued from the field and 4 for ten from guard Kelly Johnson played a three point land. Perry once again put in her double-double perfor· mance netting ten points and grab· bing eleven rebounds. Johnson, · after using this season to learn what playing at the college level. is like, played a superb game at the point guard position, running the offense extremely well and calling the Ijght plays at the right times as St. Lawrence continually switChed the defensive sets. · The boost for Union was there· tum of Leah Olivieri. The last time these two teams met, St. Lawrence walked all over Union in the post as their center scored 22 points. This game, however, Olivieri shut · that player down, holding her to just four points. While this was a disappointing loss, the effort Union put forth after sitting on a bus for five hours left a positive feeling in their minds going into t\le final game of the week and final league match-up with Clarkson. Union 83- Clarkson 76 Traveling down the road from St. Lawrence to Clarkson for the sec- ond game of the weekend, Union took the persitive aspects· of their loss to St. Lawrence and put to- gether wha~ they needed to grasp victory. Once again; Kathleen Fur· long took her team and calmly helped lt:@d them to victory over a strong league opponent in Clarkson. Furlong netted 24 points and down the final stretch of the game, Furlong was ten for ten from the free throw line. She was the go-to player in the fmal minutes as · each time Union inbounded the ball to Furlong, she was fouled and calmly cushioned Union's lead · with two more points. Adding to Furlong'sstrong per- . fotmance was Leah Olivieri who scored twenty five points from the post position and Erin McNamara. who scored 13 points and was three whopping 3.3 minutes without a referee is looking the other way. I turnover in this contest. think it was Deacon Jones who With only one game remaining in this season, it is clear that Union has grown exponentially as a team. At the beginning of the season, this team played as a group of in- dividuals, all of whom had great talents, but did not know how to play as a team. Now, after fifteen weeks of playing. together, this team has learned quite a bit. They have improved their defense, know- ing when to help a teammate and how to recover from lending that help. Offensively, they have im- proved on their individual moves to the basket, thus allowing three or four different options for each player when the team runs their offensive system. One key to this week's victories was the full court press defense. This is a notion that Coach Burt had wanted to implement all sea- son and was one ofthe final teach- ing aspects ofthis season. This is a defense the team used versus Clarkson and Russell Sage, two games Union won. Clearly this is a defense the team, in the future, ~ill put to use much more frequently. As this season conclufies, the one thing Coach Burt wants her players to know is that the time when a college player improves the most is between the.ir freshman and · sophomore year. She wants her players to know the importance of · weight training and personal work, for those who work in the off sea- soil will drastically improve their games. The teams goals for next season are to bring in four more players, thus filling their roster to fifteen. In doing so, the team will gain the depth they need to allow their start- ers some rest time and give the entire team the ability tQ run with any team for an entire game. While once said, \It ain't cheatin' if you don 't.get caught.\ Well, maybe it wasn't him, but I won't digress. What exactly constitutes the rules? Are there penalties and ejections and such? Matt pointed the finger at his own brother when I asked about the officiating of the game. Known to the water polo world as a \kick-out\, fellow senior Joel Glogowski, currently leads the team in the 30 second penalties (some- what like hockey's penalty box) for either refusing (by accident or pur- pose) to surrender the ball when possession has been granted to the opposing team, or for dunking op- posing players, which although common in recreational volleyball, is illegal at the collegiate level. \It's just a lot of fun. I know that a lot of people are in tim ida ted by the amount of swimming that goes on, and although it can be exhausting, it is such a great time that it's worth the workout,\ Glogowski noted, \we'd love to have people check out what we're all about this spring .. I can't stress enough. how much I have enjoyed playing and · how great a sport water polo is.\ Anyone interested in playing should contact Matt Glogowski {I spelled his name about fifty times so you should be able to punch it into the phone) or Bill Flick. Al- though tlle team is always looking for new members, its first practice begins the first week of spring term. this season, numbers wise, did not tum out as well as sotne may have hoped, the Union women's basket- ball program made tremendous strides. When the team returns f()r the 1998-99 winter season, they will be a much different, more intelli- gent, and competitiveteam that will pose problems for a number of league opponents. - --
