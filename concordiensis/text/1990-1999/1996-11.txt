JORDANA MALLACH: J)i>cllssed Multi-culturalism. Motion to adjourn 7:45PM. by Nalini Gupta Staff Writer A troubled teenager, an intro- spective psychologist, and a herd of six blinded horses made up the main cast ofUnion College's lat- est theater production, Equus. The production, which was in- spired by Peter Schaffer's 1977 play, was directed by Helena Binder at the Yulman Theater. The drama presents a psycho- . logical portrait of a boy named Alan and involves an intense ex- amination of repressed sexual identity, dysfunctional parenting, and religious conflict in distinctly - Freudian tradition. SimuJta .. lieously, the play also explores the psychologist Dysart's fascination with Alan's passions and his probings into the nature of his ow,n psyche. \Binder's interpretation fo- cuses on the fury and forbidden passion in the piece and presents a harrowing experience chan- neled through an impressiv~ young cast,\ wrote critic Michael Eck ofthe Times ljnion. Guest artist Marc Hayden, star- ring as Alan, successfully enacted the part through his use of English accent and his dynamic perfor- mance in the play's famous fran- tic horse scene. Sophomore Ari Gottileb, starring as Dysart, also portrayed a complex role with continuous internal conflict and ultimate epiphany. Senior Hillary Gallay played the character of Jill, an intelligent, sexy girl who trig- gers Alan's s'exual frustrations and leads him to blind the horses who have witnessed his sexual failure.

The intent to form a \community\ has failed in their opinjon 'because integration can- not be possible if the school en- dorses such things as ethnic theme housing like Thurston House. This accusation attacked Hull's earlier comment about op~ posing discrimination, but Hull said, \Theme housing is not dis- criminatory because it is not only for Asians. I \:m opposed to any organization set up by race or ethnicity.\ Thurston House is open to any member of the col- lege community who is interested in learning about the Asian cul- ture. In the attempt to uphold equal- ity, Jim Owens asked if themes houses will have to abide by the same rules and regulations as greek organization~. For ex- ample, greeks are held account- able if a house exceeds the al- lowed number of people for an unregistered event. What is at stake is whether or not theme houses will fall under the same guidelines. To answer the criticism of the meal plan, Hull succinctly s_aid, \It was a financial decision based on equity, and that makes Union more of a community.\ Hull aims to equalize the lives of indepen- dents and greeks and to allow ev- eryone to have the same oppor- tunities in their college experi- ence. \I want to raise opportuni- ties for independents without tak- ing away from fraternities and sororities,.\ Hull said. Steve Petenza, IFC Vice Presi- dent and President ofPsi Upsilon said, \The only problem is the meal plan, but if that is the only thing we disagree on, then frater- nities and sororities are in pretty good shape.\ Now that Delta Phi has deterio- rated to a condemned state, the school has arranged a plan to aid greek-owned housing in main- taining their houses. Greeks pay a lease fee to the school, and it is set aside into a fund for their up- keep. Dan Laible, President of Alpha Delta Phi, was very vocal in mentioning that they do not see the money for their maintenance, and sai'd that the money was only enough to \'buy toilet paper for their house.\ Conversely, Potenza mentioned that the \the financial plan has helped us to improve the quality of our house . [Psi Upsilon].\ One last issue that arose was Hull's lack of presence on cam- pus. Jesse Shafer explained to HuH that \part of the frustration is that you're a mysterious fig- ure.\ Jen Pool', Presid€nt of Delta Delta Delta summed up most stu- dents' feelings·by saying, \As stu- . dents, we feel he should have more interaction with the student body.\ President Hull explained . that he does try to .interact as much as his extremely busy schedule allows, but finds it very . difficult. \l think the meeting was quite successful. While the debate be- came heated at times, it was an effective way to 'clear the air' regarding the President's position on the Greek system~ President Hull clearly came out being pro- Greek and acknowledged the many contributions individuals in fraternities and sororities have made to Union College and the Schenectady community.

Haunted House Screams of Success Last year,. Union switched from Coke to Pepsi as its primary dis- trib.utor, primarily for serviceand economic reasons. Coke was poorly servicing the cam pus, commented Steve Pearse, Head of Dining Services, so Union had to look elsewhere for business. Dean Alford, Dean of Students, and Steve Pearse both stated that they Information regarding Pepsi Co. and its business in Burma can be obtained through several web sites, including http:/ www.efund.com/ burma links.html and http:// www .envirol ink.org/orgs/fcg/ sdb/1 inks.htm I. by Michelle Tham Staff Writer It was a night of ghoulish laughter and screams. On Hallow- een night from .5 p.m. to 9 p.m., Webster House sponsored a haunted house for Union College students and the surrounding community. Visitors from the Schenectady area and even as. far as Albany came to yell and cry in complete fright as students in cos- tume recreated scenes of horror. The Haunted House, planned and coordinated mainly by Sara Amann and Josh Chaplain, con- sisted of a variety of theme rooms. Tour guides led guests through everything from an insane asylum to an operating room to a torture chamber. A combination of the dark and a couple of creepy voices added to the overall effect . and left many a frightened child. Adults weren't immune to the fear as a local Schenectady resi- dent said, \When I saw that man chopping up the kid on the table I screamed so loud.\ The event was the product of a lot of hard work. Funds came from Residence Life and were ap- propriated by the Student Forum and Government. It took 2-3 weeks of planning and supply- buying. Webster RA Gabriela Dory commented on the work put it planned for. Tyrone and into the event saying, \I was hon- estly surprised at the amount of residence dedication to the Haunted House. It was my first time working at it, and I was also impressed by the amount of ef-. fort and time that resul1ed in such a sophisticated production.\ Terence Butler, 8 year-old twins L.....o..------------------------ Many children in the Schenectady area do not have the opportunity to go trick-or-treating in a safe environment, so the Haunted House at Union was a from the local community had different reactions. to the display of ghosts and mad scientists. Tyrone said, \You call that scary? I was not even close to being afraid.\ His brother, however, didn't have quite the same re- sponse. \I saw a bloody hand on the floor and I kicked it and screamed. It was gross!,\ said Terence. Halloween can also bring out the 5-year-old in everyone. Even college students can be amused by ghostly fun. Junior Megan McCarthy came out of the Haunted House and with a bright smile said, \I loved it! It was so much fun!\ Freshman Joanna Tai said, \I've never been so scared in my entire life! But it was great anyway.\ The . Haunted House was a com bi- nationof creativ- ity~ fun, a little bit of laughter, and a lot 0 f scream- i n g . Even if the dark nice alternative. Josh Chaplain, one of the haunted house's coordinators re- marked, \I think that what we did represented one of the many good things about Union College.

Ironically, the Haunted House didn't always have the effect that Halloween; after all, is sup- posed to give children a little bit of excitement amidst the chang- ing seasons. Thankfully, Webster House did just that. little bit too much, there was candy waiting at the end that made it all better. After all, a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup can make anyone smile.

EleCtion Watch. Republicans Will Rule for Two More. by Brandon D. Declet Political Staff Writer Tlte election of 1996 will go down in history as the election in which the American popu- lace decided that divided gov- emment is better government. At 11 :40 PM eastern standard time, CNN declared that the Republicans would retain con- trol of the House that they had won back in 1994, after 40 years of Democratic control. Prior to tonight's results , the political pundits had thought that the Democrats could have a chance of regaining the House by a slim margin. However, the reality of \divided govern- ment\ had been ingrained in the mimls of the American voter. The concept of complete con- tro 1 of government by the Democrats apparently had left the J>eople with the notion that the Republicans and the Demo- crats could \balance each other.\ When Democrats had control ()f·Congress and the Presi- dency, not much got done, de- spite the fears of those who said that Democratic control would :result in a more liberal agenda. On Tuesday night, it seemed evident that the people believed it was possible to moderate the political agenda by voting for Clinton and Republican Con- gressional incumbents. Tbe supposedly vulnerable Re[>ublican House freshmen apparently weren't as vulner- able as was once thought. By Wednesday morning, the Re- publican House freshman had survived the barrages of attacks that had connected tbem with the extremely unpopular speaker, Newt Gingrich. The Democratic strategy of connect- ing these freshman to the· revo- luti~nary Contract With America had obviously failed, with a count of 208 to 190 by 1:00 a.m. on Wednesday morn- ing, with the Republicans lead- ing. Though the Democrats have picked up seats, it seems clear that the dreams of Speaker Gephardt were dashed, because the coattails that the President was supposed to have had came up short.\ Secendly, the Demo- crats overestimated the ability of labor, and in particular the AFL-CIO, to provide the nec- essary votes to push several highly visible Democratic chal- lengers to victory. The AFL- CIO had po11red over 35 mil- lion dollars in to the election in hopes that the Republicans could be defeated simply through the saturation of the radio and television airwaves.

Seeing that the popular V()te was close in relation to the president, it only proves that . he is respected, a man of integxity, and someone who didn't give up without a fight. The election wasn't a total loss [in] tllat we still retain the Congress. The Republicans will have. the last laugh when the indictments come out within the ne:xt two years. -'Tom Marino '99 Clinton winning was not a huge surprise, although I'm quite happy about it. My main concern was whether or not the Democrats would win back the House and Senate. These outcomes are really important to me, given my involvement in the Womyn's Union, because the issues that affect women are more than issues on this campus. They are national issues. -Autumn Cohen '97 I don't understand why the electi()ns are held on Tuesday, because in France we· vote on Sundays so everyone can vote. I .arn surprised, because people are not very interested. -Christelle Marc, French Teachin_g Assistant · Clinton is the man. -Brandon D. Declet '97 Arizona, was a prime target of the AFL-CIO. Sy late Tues- day night, the race for the seat was too close to call. In a state that has consistently gone Re- publican, the prospects for a Democratic victory in the Presi- dential race or in any congres- sional races is far from a cer- tainty. Also, it sh(')wed that despite strong financial support these elections could not be bought by special interests. So now that it seems c.ertain that the Republicans will con~ \\ trol both Houses, it might por- tend further friction between the White Hause and the Gingrich Congress. No word yet on an- other Contract with America, but it is guaranteed that the Republicans will try to force an extremely conservative agenda. Clearly, . the Republicans will see their victozy as a mandate on their conservative agenda, and they will most likely. move further to the right in another effort not only t() discredit the President, but ~~o to satisfy the groups who tried to .get them there, namely tll.e Christian Coalition.. The electkm is ()Ver for now, but the two years coming should prove to be excit]ng for both parties and for tlle American populace. Will we see a con- tinuation of last y-ears politics or a more,harmonj()us govern- ment without the 'government shutd9wns? The pundits will definitely~ have S()rnething to talk about Unti11~98. The Democrats will surely try to come back in 1998 with another push for <:olltrol. lfthe Republicans push their agenda too hard or too farl the Demo- crats could h.a\.e another chance. Secondly,. if President Clinton sticks to bis moderate agenda, he coul-d p-rove to be the emly man wh.o truly speaks fot; the AmericaE;:fJeopte. Clinton Wins ·. t'd ... con· landslide some had expected. The final vote gave Clinton 375 of the electoral votes, Dole 148 votes, and Perot 0 votes. Dutch Hollow exploded with a variety of reactions when . Cli;nton emerged victorious. Most were. unsurprised. by the fmal results. Jodi 'Tesser and Robin Goldberg said, \The election was really no big sur- prise. The political scientists predicted that it would be a Clinton victory, and it was by a landslide.\ Others were not so pleased by Clinton's victory. Tassi Karabinis declared, \I think Dole would've been good. Clinton was not the most hon- est president. \ Exit polls conducted by CNN · throughout the day on Tuesday showed that the voters still have ·dou.bts. about Clinton's trust- worthiness and honesty. This did not stop them from voting for Clinton, however, when they entered the polling booths. The same exit polls showed that people were swayed into Clinton's direction by the economy's relative strength and Clinton's compassionate image. The popUlar vote results fluc- tuated throughout th.e evening, but final tallies on Wednesday morning showed Clinton with 50 percent, Dole with 42 per- cent, and Perot with S percent. In the 1992 election, Clinton only received 43 p:ercent of the papular vote, despite his vic- tory. This yea:r the Clinton camp was looking; to not only gain re-election hut also get a majority of the .PO!Jula.r vote. If this was not achieved, Clinton would be the .first J>T~sid~nt to be re-elected to .a second term without receiving a majority in either election.

Many of the political experts did not find this surprising, considering the relative lack of interest that voters displayed in this year's election. Union's campus proved that they were interesteli in the elec- tion, however. Mike Ferguson, one of the studen1 coordinators of the election p<B:ty .

Election Watch What Presi·dential Exit Poll Predictions Really Mean . _ ...... by .Jody Mousseau Staff Writer After Clinton took New Hampshire, the scene for the next four years was set. A little after 9 p .. m. , Clinton was crowned victor with 275 votes from the Electoral College, and Dole was left in the dust. The results from California had not yet arrived. Clinton's victory may not surprise or startle many people. Weeks ago, the race was called off by the media, by officials, and by the general public. The campaigning for the 1996 Presi- dential Elections was, at best, boring and uniformative. In this situation, the incumbent wins 99% of the time. Con- sidering that the media's opin- ion on the race convinced. vot- ers that the race was over be- fore it began, what effect did the media and the exit poll situ- ation have on Election Day? Throughout the day on Tues- day, November 5, exit polls were taken to determine who would be the president who would lead us 1nto the next millenium. The Voter News Service conducts exit polls. where people in key districts are questioned as they leave the polls. In the exit polls, a. ran- dom sample of people ate asked whom't{ley voted f(>r and other questiQns, such as whether or not they believe that they are better off than they were four years ago and which issue de- termined to whom they would cast their vote. A portion of the CNN Exit Poll that aired at 11 p.m. on Tuesday stated that . 44% O.f men voted each Repub- . licanand Democrat, as opposed to 54% of women who voted Democrat artd 37% of wo:n;ien who voted Repvblican. Ac- cording to CNN, it was the largest gender gap in an elec- tion. , The problem lies in the fact that the polls in the Western states are still open while the votes in the East and Midwest are being counted, Though exit polls are not used as official means for determining the out- comes, the \wotd\ gained by inquiry through exit polls are sometimes used to write offthe results in the Western states before they even arrive. The news determines the winner, not the exit polls. The prob- lem is that the exit polls are often mistaken as the winner by many of voters in the West, where polls naturally close later than in the East. One source stated, \These '[exiting polls] tell who the projected winner or loser is going to be. This can be bad· for the people- in California when they hear tliat one candidate is winning by_ a landslide. They might not even vote because they will not think that their vote will make any difference. It is being debated whether they should wait and tell the public who will be the president until 2 a.m. Eastern Standard time. This way, they could prove if the exiting polls have any effects on voters.\ To make.,~a fair conclusion, ~xit polls mean very little in Senate Stays in_Republicans Hands by Frank Rossi Staff Writer In one of the biggest shocks of election night, Republicans have secured at least one more seat than they had at the start of the night, leading Democrats 54-45 at 2:45a.m. The remain- ing seat comes from Oregon~ where Republi.can Gordon Smith narrowly leaas his race by one percent over Demo_crat Tom Bruggere, with a quarter or precincts reporting. The shock was not caused necessar- ily by the existence of the con:. tinuing majority but by how the majority carne about. In order for such a majority, many people felt that the Re- publicans would have to win the two hottest Senate races on the map, Massachusetts and New Jersey. In Massachusetts, Gov- ernor Bill Weld was declared the loser to incumbent John Kerry right after Massachusetts' polls closed at 8:00 p.m. The final margin was a larger-than- expected nine-point win of 53- 44. Even with Weld's popular- ity in his state, he was unable to beat Kerry as Weld's popular- ity might have hurt his Senate chances. Some voters were found to deliberately vote against Weld in order to keep him as governor. Bill Clinton also won ()Ver Bob Dole by around 32 points, too large a Democratic electorate for Weld to crack. In New Jersey, Demo- crat Bill Bradley's retirement left a wild and dirty race to form · throughout the campaign sea- son. Democrat Robert Torricelli and Republican Dick Zimmer got involved in mud- slinging in one ofthe nation's most expensive Senate races. Voters thought that Zimmer was the candidate more guilty of slinging, and this led to his 11-point loss of 53-42. Again, President Clinton won by around 18 points in New Jersey, hurting Zimmer's chances. With these two early disap- pointments, Republicanshadto hope for a surprise, and they got one. In the South, the Republi- cans were able to tum around Senate seats once held by Democrats, giving them new life. This, combined with a number of close races that mostly went the Republicans' way, reversed the Democratic momentum in the Senate. In Maine, Republican Susan Collins beat Joe Brennan by a narrow three points in a race that was unofficial for several hours ( 48-45); and, in New Hampshire, Republican irtcum.- bent Bob Smith got into a heated race with Dick Swett for a two-point victory. The possible 55-45 majority included victories by long-time Republican Senators in the Carolinas. In North Carolina, Jesse Helms, the NEA's biggest enemy, won by a 53-47 count, and in South Carolina, 93-year- old Strom ThunJlond won by a large margin. The record- breaker for the oldest man to be re-elected to the Senate will likely remain President Pro Tempore oftheSenate. The majority for Republicans in the Senate along with a smaller majority in the House is important for reasons other than legislation in the 1 05th Congress. With the various questions arising from Bill Clinton's handling of the Presi- dency, Republicans would have likely been unable to force in- vestigations into those ques- tions. Now, the Senate will re- tain its Republican chairmen, including Clinton opponent Alphonse D' Amato. In his vic- tory speech, Clinton refused to comment on a Democratic loss in Congress, stating that too many seats were close even though all major networks de- clared Republicans the victors. One sure thing is that the next two years will be .extraordinar- ily divisive between the Execu- tive and the Legislative branches as President Clinton will be put under the micro- scope by S.enate Republicans. determining or persuading what will occur in an election. The primary conflict with exit polls and negative voter in- fluence rests primarily with the West-East conflict in poll- ing schedules. lf CNN, NBC, ABC, and CBS had never analyzed the exit polls, the outcome in the 1996 Presidential Election and the House and Senate elections would not have been changed by a significant margin. Per- centage points by which Clinton was leading Dole have changed slightly over the past months, but most voters know that the race wasn't called at 9 p.m. on Tuesday. It wasn't called with the first reports of the CNN Exit Polls. It was called when the \liberal\ media claimed Clinton the lesser of two evils, and it was be\ieve.d by the American publi~.

Administrator oftlze Week: Even though this award has only been offered for a little less than a month, we h;we our first ever second-time winner! President Roger Hull has once again claimed the honor. How? you ask. Why? you demand. Well it seems that our daring president recently attended the opening night of Union College's production of Equus. Sitting in the front row, cast members noticed Mr. Hull sleeping happily. Gasp! How 'can this be?!! Are we the first small colle.ge to have a narcoleptic president? Alas faithful reader, this seems to be the case. Fortunately, the fact that Presidert.t Hull was in fact sleeping did not hinder his ability to come back-stage after the play to congratulate the cast members on a great show, to which one member replied, \Thanks for staying awake for it\. What strikes me as odd is the interesting coincidence that opening-night was in fact the same night the play was reviewed by the Albany Times-Union. The reviewer loved the show calling it, \simply fabulous, perfectly executed theater\. Unfortunately, President Hull missed a great show, and that seems to be the greatest injustice. Maybe he had a long day fund-raising, or forgetting student's names. But the fact of the matter is that he gave his congratulations to something he'd slept through. All I'm saying is if you sleep through something, then sleep through it. Don't lie to students, who've put countless hours of work into something, and know the kind of man you are.

Eschew- ing the visual media, his blonde- locked companion erupts with spir- ited mirth into a rousing lounge ver- sion of\Champagne Supernova'', ala the Love Boat theme.

In a sense, this heatkens back to the universal childhood which most ofus will never fully outgrow. We are all taught by our elders as we grow up to think before we speak, and so, we cannot always say things like, \Hey Dad, has Mrs. Peterson always been that fat?\ In a sense, societal norms dictate that we must communicate with prudence, orelse sufferthe wrath of an upturned hand. We get mixed signals as we grow up; each stage of development, both physically and emotionally, marks a \rite of passage,\ but we must cher- ish our childhood years. This makes us growing up looking f01ward to the age when we can be 18, and when we get to that age, we wish we held on to all these times in kindet:gardert when naptime was a ful!Mfledged,.. class.(remember naptime!

Aftf3r some soul searching I came to the conclusion that I was h\e- coming too negative of a per- son. So, after a phone~call to 111)' high school guidance cQun- .selor, serious meditation, and.a well balanced diet, I've become a riew man. For the rest of this term Planet C will no longer tear down the administration or make greek·jokes. From this day forward, I will strive to highlight all the good and beautyofUnion college. With- out further ado, I'm proud to in- troduce my first feature article on UniQn 's nicest staff member, Angie ... She knows your narrie, do you know hers? She's been here for 14 years, you've been here for 5 or less. Chances c;tre she's handled your Valedine and read it. Her name is Angie, she works in the convenience store, and she loves to make you happy. ~ Born and raised a Schenectady resident, Angie was here when GE was thriv- ing and Schenectady was a bus~ tUng industrial city, She got her ·start in the food industry at Kelly's pub as a ca- terer. When Kelly's went under she moved down the road to Union and continued het car.eer as a catere-r for Union's pre-marriot dining services. In her years here at Union college she's seen a lot of changes. When I asked her about the selling ,out of the schools food service to marriot, she had nothing but positive remarks to make. \'I think very highly -of the way they run ttreir business ... they re- ally khow what they're doing.\ When I asked ller to comment on the more recent' switcn from coke to Pepsi, she related that stu- dents see:tn.ed to adapt to the change well: So in turns of product quality she was satisfied with Pepsi. However, af- ter she found out about Pepsi's monetary suppert of human rights abuses in Burma, her tune changed completely. Pepsi does business in Burma, which is ()ontrolled by a military regime. This regime believes that enslaving its people in labor camps is the best way to improve its economy. Her response to Pepsi's contin- ·' Hungry, but not Enough Bananas to Share by Peter Sorensen Features Editor Who saw Ethnic Man last Friday night? Wow, ten ofyou? Oh my gosh. This campus is, like, so apathetic. And ifi were being serious right now, I'd have to give myself an affec- tionate slap across the face for . stereotyping, generalizing and posessing an undeserved supe- riority complex. But it's so easy to do, right? Remember last year, when anyone who wasn't into the same stuff as you was deemed \apathetic?\ We may be over the a-word, but it rep- resents a basic human tendency to divide and conquer, segre- gate and label and generalize and judge (am ·I generalizing?) Ethnic Man subtlety alluded to our instinctual ability to cat- egorize as he described the ra- c;ial predjudices he was subject to as he grew up, but race is only one small example. Lds look at some of the exclusive, separatist boxes we on this cam- pus createandstuffpeople into: the \greek societies are stupid and pointless 11 box; the 11 R.A.'s are pigs\ box; the \everyone else drinks too m1;1ch and doesn't care enough about the world of academe\ box ... and then the less serious conversa- tional-type stuff like skiing is cooler than snowboarding, J. Crew beats Gap, and English majors are better in bed boxes. It's all part of the fun; I myself subscribe to .the notions that vegetarians taste better and politics are crap. So where do stereotypes come from? I know, I know, Protestants created 'em. Oops, that was a stereotype. My theory is this: we are mostly left-brained, categorizing crea- tures; we see similarities and differences and then classify. Unfortunately, such an ap- proach to life prevents us from tasting the honey-the beauty of unabashed, ego-less open- ness to everything {except re- publicans). The ego is probably largely at fault here, for it is difficult if not impossible to supress a sense of self, to say nothing ofpersonal cosmic im- portance. What audacious crea- tures we be, hmm '? Enough said. A philosophy major could probably write 17 theses about this, I only get half a page, and I have a story to continue. Last week as I lay on the pavement in pain seeking a divine sign that everything was dandy I wrote that \she ap- peared, carrying a sign.\ l hope I did not :tn.islead anyone into thinking that \she\ was Bjork or Elle Macpherson or that cute girl from Potter house who doesn't know I exist.. .that •1' wouldsitnply be way too tacky. \She\ was Spanish professor Merediz, and the \sign\ was a stack of papers she held. Pro- fessor Thorn as stood to the side, smoking a butt and shaking his head. \You are going to kill yourself with that board,\ he said. In my hazy vis·ion I eyed the carbon monoxide jets streaming from his nostrils and politely remarked that we all I-tave our vices, and I am mlJch more likely to break my head then kill myself, anyway. Anyway, I was in a bind. I was supposed to be studying for a test, reading a short story and writing a paper. In Spanish. And here was my personal Jimin.y Cricket, smiling and shaking her head and subtlety alerting me to an intense aware- ness of my foolishness. So I stood, slowly, made pleasant conversation to the effect of \I'll be off to the library now\ and I-lobbled home with my skateboard between my legs. ued involvement in Burma was direct and concise, \that's bad, very bad ... [if it were up to me] I would not buy Pepsi products, absolutely not.\ Whether the change is to a privatized dining hall, or to a socially irre- sponsible soft drink company, Angie has managed to maintain her love for her job. \I'm very flexible, very flexible.\ When asked about what she like most about her job, she replied \I like everything about my . job.\ When forced to narrow down her answer, she defini- tively stated \I like working for the students ... they're my first priority, I' II do anything for them (she later retracted that statement, fear- ing a rush of students making ridiculous de- mands).\ \I always find [Union] students very pleasant. Hey, they're far from I-lome, and if I can make them feel more at home, I'm glad to. I especially like to welcome the freshman, and make them feel comfortahle .. .I've always liked working with people, I doubt if I could work in a office ... You students keep me young.\ A tradtional woman, she lists her husband, six chi-ldren, and catholic faith as her inpirations. These inspirations apparently serve her quite well, as she is one of the most treasured staff members by Union students. Whether, it's the special way she makes your slushy or her cheerfull demeanor, she seems to find her way into the hearts of most students she contacts. Angie is quite popular with students on campus. \She's such a cool lady,\ commented Owen Fitter. \I I o v e h e r ... sh e al w a y s knows my name,\ marveled Josh Cote. A bit more con- cerned Matt Nermoe wondered \how does she always know my name? .. I try to stay low-key.\ There is definately something unique about a woman who never gets tired a giving a per- sonal hello to every student who's ID card she handles. It takes a little extra enthusiasm to remind patrons that she'll be there for them until I I. Though I have to admit, she doesn't have actually have the names of every student memorized. Angie told me it would be OK to share her secret with the stu- dent body, \I read the names off their cards,\ she said. .

The First Pachyderm Road Movie is a Big, Big Stillker \Larger Than Life. \ Starring Bill Murray, Jeneane Garofalo, Matthew McConaughey, Linda Fiorentino: Directed by Howard Franklin. Rated PG, United Artists Pic- tures. Rating: * (out of four) Sometime back in the Lincoln Administration, the premise for this movie could not have looked more suited to Murray's style: the famous actor travels cross-coun- try with an elephant. With Murray's way of getting into the wrong situation at the wrong time, the comic twists and turns of such a concept would seem end- less. Can't you just picture Murray dropping his bags, pac- ing back and forth and whining at the large beast in front of him, looking perfectly content? Apparently, the filmmakers could not because what they have created: is the perfect Bill Murray vehicle without a single drop of personality. In essence, Larger ThanLifeshouldhave been called Lacking Life. Murray :plays his usual cynical self, this time in the persona of a motivational speaker hosting re- ally lame conferences like a chair- makers' convention. Then one day, lle receives word that his fa- ther has died, an estranged figure who has left Murray with an in· heritanc.e. What has he inherited? An elephant with thousands of dollars worth of property damage attached to its trunk. The el- ephant, named Vera, is now the .nrc•n ... r-h of Murray, who has only a few days to sell it so he can return to his C()nvention-speak- ing gigs. The dilemma: who will be the highest bidder for Vera so he can pay off the damages caused by this beast? The usually spunky Garofalo, who is given approximately no funny lines (give or take one), plays an animal ex. pert who wants to purchase the elephant and send it to Sri Lanka where it ·can roam freely. Murray's character.is interested in money, though, and is consequently more attracted to the financial offer (and character) of Fiorentino, an animal trainer who turns out to be the \bad gui' ofthe movie. What makes this movie so com- pletely awful is its lackofprepos- terous situations. Murray and Vera have the daunting ta~k of going across tile country in just a few days, and yet, there are no run-ins with the law ,.only a pass- ing nod to Vera's need to con- sume massive quantities offood, and a few cute close-ups of Vera reacting to Murray's tired shtick. Knowing every comedy-maker's infatuation with bathroom humor, it's a wonderthat there are no ref.. erences to Vera'.s bowel movF rnents. Surely scmetime along thisjourney, M unay would have found the goldell opportunity to comment on his companion·s body odor. As for conflicts along the way, the only majcr one is when Murray is giwn a lift by a psy- chotic tnrck dd ver played by ·McConaughey.

The game was televised as the \ECAC Game of the Week,\ and Alfred's 950 fans had a lot to cheer about in the first halffor the television audience. In their first possession, the Saxons charged downfield after a 31-yard comple- tion from quarterback Ryan Woo- druff, but the ensuing 40-yard fi.eld:..goal attempt knuckled wide left. Union used the miss as an opportunity to jump into tile lead after faking a punt just across midfield. The fake went to run- ning back Justin Bourqae on a fourth-and-two play, and Bourque gained five yards to con~ tinue the drive. Tom McKeown threw a 35-yard pass to running back Shuron Morton, wile, two plays later, ran in a three~yard touchdown. Woodruff an.d the Saxons answered with a field goal on a drive in which Woodruff completed four passes for 45 yards. Late in the first quarter, receiver Ryan Smith retLJmed a kickoff 30 yards to mi<ifield. Str.ong running by Mort<ln and Sourqu!:.l mov.ed .the ball to the I I, where McKeown passed to tight end Leon Grebla in the endzone. The 14-3 Dutchmen lead ap- peared safe, but it was not. On the v.ery next play from scrim- mage, Woodruffcompleted a67- yard pass to Tom Callen to quickly answer the Dutchmen touchdown. After missing a two- point conversion, the Saxons cut the lead to 14-9. In the middle of the second quarter, Union continued to back- track on both sides of the balL After safety Brian Brodt inter- cepted a throw from the Alfred place-kick holder (the snap was bad), Union was forced to punt. Regular punter Judson Zachar left the team before the game last week, so Ben Blackwood was in charge of booting the ball on Sat- urday. His 33.2~yard average was very good in such bad weather, but his 34-yard punt at this point could only pin the Saxons back to the 50. All Alfred needed was one play, a handoff to Jeff Colasanti, to score their next touchdown. Another failed two- point conversion gave Alfred a 15-14 lead, which was only the second time the Dutchmen have been down this season. Two plays into Union's next drive, Tom McKeown passed the ball to Alfred's Wil Green as Green hid behind a Union receiver and tele- graphed the path ofMcKeown 's pass. Green had 24 tackles on the day, which was more than the top two Dutchmen tacklers combined on Saturday. The interception and run back gave Alfred the ball on the Union 16, but Alfred could not get a touchdown or first down. Their 30-yard field goal wa.s · good, and it gave Alfred their fif- teenth unanswered point. Late in th.e second quarter, Roger Egbert j.ust missed a 36- yard field goal, giving Alfred the chance to run out the clock with a four-point lead, but the Saxons' poor clock management gave the UCAA Update UCAA Football: Offensive Player of the Week: Shuron Morton, Sr. -Had 24 carries for 171 yards and two touchdowns before taking the fourth qLJarter off in a 45-31 shootout in Aflred.

Fol- lowing a Dutchmen penalty, McKeown threw a 19-yard pass to running hack Joe Latella on a third~and~20 play, and Coach Audino went for the remaining yard on fourth down. Bourque took the ball on to the left side and gave Union new life with a 15-yard gain and a minute left in the half. McKeown then tossed a l9~yard pass to receiver Peter Buscemi,. but Buscemi remained inbouads with ~he clock running out. McKeown called for the Dutchmen to set for a clock-kill- ing spike, but he faked the spike and passed to Buscemi in the endzone for Buscemi's first pass- ing touchdown ofthe season. The \Dan Marino\ play (used by the Dolphins to beat the Jets two years ag9) gave Union a 21-18 lead and the momentum they needed going into the second half. To start the second half, Shuron Morton carried the ball 41 yards on Union's fifth play ofthe half, leading to a 12-yard touchdown run for Justin Bourque. Two pos- sessions later, Union took the ball over at their 47 after a poor Alfred punt.

Justin Bourque took the baH 43 yards and led to the sec- ond Shuron Morton touchdown of the afternoon, with a two-yard run by Morton. With the Dutchmen do ubi ing the Saxons' score, 44-21, Alfred tried to recover. Ryan Woodruff completed four passes for 74 yards, including a 23-yard shot for a touchdown. After a third missed conversion (wide kick), the quarter came to a close. ln the final stanza, the Dutchmen put together a 13-play, six-minute drive which led to a 22-yard Roger Egbert field goal. The Iength and success of the drive helped ensure that the Saxons could not come back. With the second teams in for Union, the Saxons scored another touch- down and field goal, but it was not nearly enough, as the Dutch- men won 45-31. With the win, Union moved to an impressive 7- I record, and Alfred moved to an unrepresentative 3-5 record. Wild & Wooly Play The teams combined for 1,010 yards on Saturday, which is by far the most seen in a Union game this season. It was also the first shootout in which Union has par- ticipated of late, and the of- fense answered several questions on snowy Merrill Field by scor,. ing 45 points. The defense had a ro1.1gh day as they keyed-in on running back Max Fre~man, the expectetl: ·w.eftpcm. (or Alfred, bu.~. he·only c(!rried 19. tiPles for 70 yards.

Alfred's net of 473 yards, though, was stillle~s than Union's 537, as Union gained 373 yards on the . .ground. Shuron Morton and Justin Bourque sur- passed 100-yards rushing for the first time in the same game this. season as Morton tallied. 171 yards and Bourque gained 109 yards. Backup Joe Latella also fared well with 59 yards, his best total of the. season.. Tom McKeown also had an outstand- ing day, completing 13 of 26 passes for 164yards, three touch- downs, and only one interception. Pete Buscemi, after a rough few weeks, came on strong towards the end of the first halfand caught four passes for 49 yards and a touchdown for the game. On the defensive side, senior linebackers Mario Maltese and Bobby Champlain both had con- sistent days. Maltese tallied 11 tackles, and Champlain added 11 tackles, two for losses, to his in- terception. Charrod Riley had seven solo tackles, and sopho- more Jim Rozakis had four assists as the secondary saw more action than normal on Saturday.

The Dutchmen lost fo11r players to graduation after· last year's disappointing 6-19 .season (Jamie Haver, Bill Bahrs, Chip Sindait~o, and Matt Sugarman). The team also welcomes a new head coach, as Coach Bill Scanlon resigned after last season. Coach Robert Montana takes o;ver the helm, and he is very confit':lent about th~ players he has this se~­ son. \At this point in the season, the team is in pretty good shape, and they have been working very hard to maintain that condition- ing.\ Coach Montana has only one full-season experienced player returning in guard Rob TeCarr, but he also has three other players returning with some ex- perience, including Matt A vis, Doyin Richards, and Shol-a Richards. · The Richards twins left half- way through last season after be- ing diagnosed as having a heart ailment that caused Doyin to col- lapse during a practice. Alter sit- ting out that half-season, the twins decided to return, and Coach Montana said, \They're very en- thusiastic, and they worked very hard throughout the summer and fall. They diq a great job, and they're in good shape:\ For a· successful season, they will have to be in good shape, as Montana has a large_ hole. to fill with the graduation of Jamie Haver. Haver had 95 three-point field goals last season, a Union single- season record, and overall, the four graduates took 39.5 points per game with them. Coach Mon- tana is practical about the state of New men's head coach Robert Montana (C(Jurtesy of Sporis Information Department) the team as he stated, \The big- gest drawback that this team will be faced with early is their lack of experience, but I think there is certainly potential [in the fresh players].\ Montana, a former assistant coach for the Dutchmen, does not ~hink that his first season will be a \rebuilding year,\ even with a 6-19 record posted by the team last season. With Rob TeCarr's 4 7 three-point field goals, the Richards' potential shown in the first half of last season (Doyin with 12.5 points per game, and Shola with 9.6 points), and a whole slate of good freshmen and transfer students, Coach Montana may have the right mix. to avoid the \rebuilding year\ title. Mon- tana wants to take one · arne at a time, however, as he said, \We' II work as hard as we can to be ready to play the first game, and then we' II work as hard as we can to be ready for the second game.\ That first game is on November 26 at Hartwick. As for the Dutchwomen, Coach Mary Ellen Burt returns as head coach after a slightly disappoint- ing 5-19 season last year. Coach Burt, however, is confident that her team will go ''onward and upward\ this season as she com- mented, \This year, we're already ahead of where we were last year with the practices.\ Coach Burt said that the team is adapting to her style of coaching a lot better this year, since many players have a year of her techniques under their belts. Women's head coach Mary Ellen Burt (Courtesy Sports lnfor/ll,(ltfon Department) Senior Amy Hitz returns after an impressive season last year. Hitz led the UCAA with 11.7 re- bounds per game, and she is within 232 rebounds of former player Robin Romer's record (Hitz has 70\0 Romer had 932). Hitzalso led all players with 14.4 points per game last season. Burt said of Hitz, \She is certainly a lead~r on the team.\ Hitz is also eighth on the all-time Dutchwomen scoring list with 78.8 points in her three seasons. Amy Dougherty also returns for her senior season, after coming on strong at the end of last season. After dealing with some health problems, Dougherty brought her average up to 6.9 points per game and 4.6 rebounds. Senior Tanya Capparello will be rejoining the team after January I after her in- ternship is complete, so Coach Bllrt will have the ability to test some of her younger players early in the season in Capparello 's po- sition. Mary Schultz also returns for the Dutch women after a great freshman season. Coach Burt was quick to point out that there are no juniors on the te11m this season, so even after Hitz, Dougherty, and CappareJJo graduate, the team will have a lot ofvotential. The freshmen play- ers to watch out for this season include Leah Oliveiri, Leigh Ann Moriarty, and Shawn McQuade. Coach Burt said the team is ex- cited to begin game play, which starts on November 30 against Jol1n Carroll (Ohio) in the Roch- ester Tournament. 7/,e 1e&e ~w~~[D)5 Women's Hockey Swimming Victory over Umass to start season [iQIT\\ [g)[Jl dTI~l ~ All short stories and poetry to the idol box in the college center All art submissions to main office of the arts --------~--------------------------------------~ by Jody Mousseau Siaff Writer The Skating Dutchwomen opened the season with a 5-2 vic- tory over UMass Amherst on Sat- urday, November2.

The Union women's ice hockey team will have their home opener at 4 p.m. on Friday, Octo- ber 8 against Holy Cross. For- ward Laura Felton feels that that the combination of skilled rook- ies and sol.id veterans will help to improve the team. \We are much better now than we were at this • time last year. We have some rookies who can play and a solid line~up of veterans. We have been working hard in practice and I think that rea:lly paid off in the first game.

Women's Soccer Dismissed in Playoffs by Aaron Sicotte . Staff Writer The women's soccer team left Tuesday night for their game against P-lattsburgh excited and expecting an upset victory; but upon arriving to the field on Wednesday, they discovered the field covered in a thick layer of mud. It seemed more fit for mud wrestling than for a soccer game. Trying to play on the mud proved extremely difficult, especially for a Union team that was used to playing on nice grass fields. Uil ion came out playing hard and ready for the game, but the mud eventually wore them down. Halfway through the first half, Plattsburgh began to take control of the game away from Union. It. began slowly and innocently enough, but once it :began, it never stopped. With twenty minutes gone in the half, Union's defense broke down. Plattsburgh converted a comer kick with a quick shot in the back of the net. They never !coked back. Within five minutes, they were given another corner kick opportunity and again con- verted to bring the score to 2-0. Before the end of the half, they scored another goal, and Union Women's Soccer could not overcome Platsburgh, a!!!tltey had St. Lawrence during a mid-season game (File Ph&-io I TC) went into half-time down 3-0. - two quick goals S-()On after Union Union managed to get on the scored and raisedthe final score score board in the beginning of to 5-1.

Division III Football Playoff Picture by Fran~ Rossi Staff Writer Union dl'opped out ofthe top six this Wt.Jek, making my salc;:s job a bit tougher. Union (7~ 1) has over a 50% chance to make the playoffs; and, for once, Union can sit back and watch as the Dutch- men .opted for a bye weekend. Assuming Union is seventh in the poll (Coast Guard simply inched above them}, let us look at th.e poll and the teams at>ove Union. The East Poll is made up of voters in the northeastern states, NY, and other states (e.g., New Jersey). The voters are usually the athletic directors of schools in the region. The East Region is overseen by the Plymouth State athletic director. Starting midway !hrough. the season, the voters rank their top teams for the poll (released on Mondays), and at the end of the season, the top four in the poll go to the playoffs. In past years, the Dutchmen have not received much respect in this poll, as can be seen by Coast Guard's jump over Union without Union losing. The rea- son is twofold. First, Union sup- posedly plays an \easy\ schedule. With their only loss to Coast Guard, a 6-2 team, with wins against Albany and RPI, and with a tough game against Carnegie Mellon to come, those critics have invalid claims. Second, Union has a bad reputation. If you look at the top four, you have three state schools and a military acad- emy. Union is one of the few pri- vate schools which vies for the NCAA playoffs in the East, but with the prestige associated with Union comes a small price-the idea that we are spoiled rich kids. The top two teams, Buffalo State and Cortland, would prob- ably have tc lose two games to fall below Union as they have only lost to Division li schools. Here are their chances of losing both oftheir remaining games .. I . . Bp.ffalo St. - 5% Buffalo State, 6-1, plays Roch\ ester this Saturday.

(File Plloto lTC) The following week is an im- portant matchup for Buffalo State at Ithaca. Ithaca gets the home- field advantage, and that will even this already good game out. The chance for an Ithaca win is 50%. 2. Ithaca - 22.5% Saturday, 6-1 Ithaca travels to CortJand State, a team ranked just behind Union. Cortland beat Springfield in overtime last week, 33-30. This is another g'ood · 3. King's Poi11t - 68% The Merchan1 Marine Acad- emy at King's \Point now 6-1, plays at Western Connecticut State, an up-a11d-down team.

As Union knows, ((last Guard has a powerful team, <:apable of beat- ing King's Poillit, but it will be tough for Coast Guard playing away. Give King's Point a 40% chance for a loss here. 4.

Coast Guard- 65% Coast Guard, 6-2, visits WPI Saturday, and if Coast Guard plays like they played Union, this will be ugly. WPI has home-field advantage and 15% chance. As mentioned above, Coast GuarQ visits King's Point to close out thejr ten-game season. King's Point has a 60% chance for vic- tory. Using a long system to com- pute the probability for Union to make the playoffs, Union has a 55o/o chance for the playoffs, as- suming they beat Carnegie Mellon in two Saturdays. CMU will be a tough game for Union, but a lot of scenarios will be fig- ured out by that time .. Even with only two weekends left, Union's chances are still alive and welL Men's Soccer Ends S.eason by Josh Adams Staff Writer The Union Men's soccer sea- . son came to a conchisionthispast Saturday with a 1-0 loss to Springfield.. Coach Aldo Nardiello believed that everyone was on edge for the season-end- ing contest. It was the senior's last game ever, and everyone wanted to do well. The team struggled from beginning .-o end. The loss finished the season for . the Dutchmen with a record of 6-8-1. The Dutchmen were .guided this 1ear by Coach Nardiello and · by the four senior standouts GeoffSipperly, Ted Doran, Greg Walters, and Eric Kujawski. This is a very young team, which holds tremendous promise for the upcoming years. They only lose the four seniors and there is· only onejunior on the team. There is nowhere to go but up f(Jr this skillful soccer squad. Coach \f\lardiello called this season a \roller coaster ride.\ He said that there were some pea,ks, along with some lows. Th:e Coach pointed out the Skidmore game as the defining moment in the season .. \We put together an outstanding game against Skidmore. Th'e loss took the wind out of our sails. We never bounced back,\ he said. A bright spot in the lineu.p this season was freshman goalie Jeff Thomas. Nardiello sa:id that he was \a big factor to why we did so well.\ Thomas, time and again, kept Union in tight games and always rose to the occasion. In the game against Middlrebury College, a 2-0 lo-ss, Thomas was injured by a Middlebury player. Sophomore Craig Ellman be- • l ' ' came el)raged at this incident and received a red card. Union had to play a man down.for 7() min- utes, without ~heir star goalie against a nationally ranked team. The fact that .they only can:te . away with a 2-0 loss speaks vol,. umes about this soccer team. They have shown that they can play with the best of the teams in the nation, and with a few years of maturity, they have, the distinct possibility of being one of the best teams in the nation. Coach Nardiello also pointed out that Thomas's backup, Neal Dockherty, stepped up well in place .of Thomas against Middlebury. \[Neal Dockherty l did a very good job against the Middlebury ons.laught,\' said Nardiello. Nardiello also said that senior Ted Doran would be sorely missed. He cited Doran as one of the best players in the region, it will be hard to replace the level of competitiveness and ski II that Doran brought to the field. The new year brings with it new expectations and new hopes. Nardiello feels that the new sea- son begins now with a newly de- signed weight program·. If the intensity that they share during the off -season, is anything like · what they had during the year, then we can all look forward to an exciting few seasons of men's soccer at Union College.

Kanell on sev- eral other occasions showed the knowledge to audible out of a play to avo.id an oncoming rush. The qualities that he disp.Jayed in such a short time are the things that Dave Brown is still working tolearn. · It is wrong to replace a player due to an injury, but in the case of' the Giants' current situation, this would he more than accept- able. The young team has made great strides on thedefens.ive side while the offense has struggled all year, including during the recent blow-out of Detri:iit. While the defense is poised to become only better with age, the offense needs a change. The time has come to see if the young Kanell is the man to lead the Giants into the next century.

Merrimack scored on a giveaway in the defensive zone, as a Union pass was inter- cepted by a Warrior and two quick passes and an Eric Weichselbaumer shot gave Merrimack a 3-2 lead. The Dutchmen fought back, but Thibeault was ready, stopping a Donovan breakaway at 16:25 and nice shot by Ryan Campbell with just under a minute to go. With Koenig pulled and a sizeable Achilles rink crowd on its feet, lJnion mustered one last offen- sive attack. The Merrimack de- fense held strong, and the War- riors handed Union their second loss of the season, 3-2. Union's goaltender Koenig felt that the outcome of the weekend showed · that the Dutchmen would have to play hard each game. \We have to play every game tooth and hail,\ he said. Senior defenseman Seabrook Satterlund echoed Koenig's sentiments, saying \The season is young and it takes time for a team to gel. We have to play hard, because we are capable of winning games like Providence.\ The Dutchmen begin their ECAC schedule next week, when they will travel to Dartmouth on November 8th and to Vermont on November 9th to battle the Cata- mounts, who are ranked second in the Nation. Sophomore defenseman Mark Will com- mented oil the upcoming week- end, saying \These are our first ECAC league games ofthe year and we're starting on the road.

Skating Dutchmen Break Even at Home Falter against Merrimack after beating lOth ran.ked Providence --------------~-------- by Jonathan Gasthalter Sports Editor This weekend marked the first home games of the 1996-97 sea- son for the Union College Skat- ing Dutchmen and new Head Coach Stan Moore's debut at Achilles Rink. The Dutchmen, coming off of a tough 3-2 loss to Hockey East power New Hamp- shire, faced off against the lOth ranked team in the nation and winner of the Hockey East Tour- nament, the Providence Friars, on Friday, November 1st. The Dutchmen came out flying, just as they had against UNH, skating fast, making quick, crisp passes, and taking the body. Union controlled the tempo for much of the first period, with the defensemen leading the rush into the Providence zone. The Dutch- men, despite controlling the play for much of the first stanza, missed a couple of opportunities to bury the puck in front of the Friar net. Finally, after junior goaltender Trevor Koenig cov- ered the rebound on a Providence shot, the Dutchmen's strong at- tack forced a Friar mistake. Brent Ozarowski, rushing down the ice, sent the puck deep into the Friar zone. Providence second-string goaltender Mike Kane. who had communication problems with his defensemen all night, mis- handkd the puck, and it bounced to assistant captain Ryan Donovan. Donovan quickly fed a pass to a streaking John Sicinski, who tapped into the empty net for a l-0 Dutchmen lead with just under two minutes to go in the period. The second period featured more of the crisp passing and strong checking that the Dutch- men had shown in the first period. Koenig shined midway through the period, snaring a point-blank shot heading for the upper left corner. Soon after, Providence captain David Green took a bad penalty behind ihe play. Union took advantage ofthe power play. Russell Monteith, after being stopped once by Kane; found himself in front of the net and fired the puck past Kane fora 2-0 lead. With the 1,552- Achilles Rink crowd rocking, the period ended. The third period belonged to Koenig as he made 14 saves, a number of them in heavy traffic, to thwart any chance of a Friar comeback. Maintaining his po- sitioning and confidence, Swimming Open-s Strong by Kelen Barr Staff Writer This past Saturday; the men and women's swimming and diving teams started their season with the annual Union Relays meet here at Union.The teams in the meet included Coast Guard, Skidmore, RPI, New York University, Hartwick College, Vassar, Springfield College, and New Paltz. The mens teams finished with a strong second place to Coast Guard, and the womens teams tied for second place with Hartwick College. The meet consisted of all relay events such as the 300 yard breastroke relay, with three swim- mers each swimming 100 yards, and the 600 Individual Medley relay, with three swimmers each swimming a200 1M. The Union Relays meet is a fun way to start off the season, letting the new swimmers get a feel for college competition, and also for the teams and coaches to see the strengths of other teams in the area. Being Division IU, Union will not swim against most of these teams in the regular season. However, it gives the teams an idea of their abilities, and for the swimmers to see where they are in their training. \You've got to know where you're at to know where you're going;\ says head coach Judy Wolfe.
