20 Schenectady, New York May 2, 1991 ---- Daniel Lundquist Named Dean Of Admissions President Hull Kicks Off Bicentennial Campaign Courtesy of Public Relations Daniel Lundquist has been named dean of admissions and · financial aid at Union College. Lundquist, 37, served as associate dean of admissions at the University of Pennsylvania from 1983 to 1989. Currently, he is the university's campaign director of development. In announcing Lundquist's appointment, Union President Roger H. Hull stressed the importance of the role of the admissions dean at a time of intense national competition for students. \With his extensive background in admissions work and his proven abilities,\ the president said, \Dan will bring a broad perspective to this challenging assignment. He is the right person at the right time for Union.\ Lundquist will assume his duties at Union on July 1. He succeeds Kenneth A. Nourse, who is retiring after directing the admissions program at Union since 1979. Lundquist said, \Few colleges combine Union's strength, heritage, vitality and resources. Taken together, these give me great confidence that we'll succeed as we face the tasks ahead in admissions and financial aid.\ A native of Philadelphia, Lundquist is a 1976 graduate of Amherst College, where he majored in American studies and English.

Lundquist began his career in education in 1977 at Coe College, in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, where he was an admissions officer and lecturer in English. He joined the University of Pennsylvania as director of transfer and international admissions in 1980 and became associate dean of admissions three years later. During his six years as associate dean, he was responsible for the implementation of all recruitment strategies for the university, directed the Admissions Selection Committee. managed a professional and support staff of 25. and advised on admissions policy and recruitment planning. He also was a co-founder and Continued on page 3 \We are a liberal arts and engineering college in a city, surrounded by beautiful countty, and w(}.arededicated to giving our students a world vision for the coming global century,\ he said. The president noted that key elements of the $150 million campaign are increased endowment for scholarship and student aid, extensive support for teaching and faculty research. and major improvements to the historic Ramee campus. The campaign is scheduled to conclude in 1995, Union's 200th anniversary. Specific campaign objectives are to increase expendable support for the operating budget by $25 million through the Annual Fund; to build endowment in four areas-- faculty support, financial aid, academic programs and library and labo1ratory support-· by $87 million; and to attract Continued on page 3 Marian Wright Edelman to Speak at Graduation By HALLIE NEUBERGER The commencement speaker for 1991 is a representative of what the Union College community has been striving to achieve and should continue with more effort to enhance-- diversity. The speaker is Marian Wright Edelman. Edelman is a Mro-American woman yrho is characterized as one who is willing to take necessary measures which will provide everyone with an equal chance at a healthy and happy life. As founder and president of the Children's Defense Fund, Edelman has contributed to one of the most crucial projects of our society-. . that of stri. ving to enhance the lives of children. One may also recognize her name with that of the civil rights movement of which Marian Wright Edelman was a pioneer. Marian Wright Edelman has been perceived by various sources as \one of the four most exciting young women in the country.\ She graduated from Spelman College in 1960 and then received a law degree from Yale Law School in 1965. She became the first Mro-American woman lawyer in Mississippi and utilized this degree as a staff attorney for the NAACP. In 1968 she left Mississippi to pursue her fight for low-income people. This is apparent in her active involvement with the Poor People's Campaign as a congressional and federal liaison. Edelman is referred to by a member of the Senate as \the 101 st senator.\ This exemplifies her enduring attempt to make refonns for causes she believes arc too substantial to merely skim over. Marian Wright Edelman participated in a world summit for children in October of 1990 where seventy-one heads of state converged at the United Nations to discuss the f uturc of the world's youth. Edelman Edelman is referred to by a member of the Senate as \the 10 1st senator.\ argues that \with nearly 13 million poor children, we have · • a third World within our nation. One of every four U.S. infants and toddles lives in poverty. And American children are two or three times more likely to live in poverty · than those in· countries we . -consider our peers and competitors .... \ Marian Wright Edelman has seen various leaders of reform fade from the picture; however, she has done just the opposite. She is a representative of high ideals and morals and is deeply concerned about the present and the future of our society. Marian Wright Edelman will warn the graduating students entering the next phase of their lives of the harsh realities that exist outside of the Union College community. I . In This .

Apparently, the Administration has been engaged in talks with the fraternity for about two weeks regarding possible infractions. While Assistant Dean of Students Fred Alford was surprisingly open in discussing the situation. Dean Mammola hesitantly told Concordiensis that \there are at least three separate incidents which we've been concerned with over the past month.\ The most recent incident in question transpired this past weekend when Dean Alford entered the Delta Phi house at approximately 11:15 Sunday morning to ask fraternity members to clean up their outside grounds which were a \mess.\ Inside the house, he encountered a number of pledges who were in the act of doing what appeared to be push-ups, while one brother sat by and watched them perform.

· 1\JEW!i AI\JAL Y!il§ May 2, 1991 New Blood Needed In Today's Political Forum ·By JIM POLITES A.ssociate News Editor The game of politics often leads to a broad spectrum of results such that many a figure, whether loser in art election or established incumbent, is constantly subject to feelings of uneasiness and paranoia-- a certain outcrop of the cutthroat competition that pervades each and every state in the Union. Our political system is rooted in the principles of democracy, and the election of officials throughout this country is geared towards popular representation, where the areas of most inhabitants are granted a proportional. number of delegates. The United States' structure abounds with people who, with a backdrop of patriotism a.nd flag waving, revel in expressing all the virtues 0f a society that can both hear the voice of the masses while still maintaining a high degree of control and sanctity. Of course, there is mu.ch more to the politics of America than simply a scheduled vote and subsequent vict()ry speeches and lectures concerning the virtues of our system. Behind the scenes of what we vi·ew in person and on television-- the joyous rallies, crowded public appearances, and all-but-staged confrontations in debate-- is often a sordid, surreptitious display of brutal influence and maniplllation that can't help but defame the legitimacy of politics. There has always been a number of divergent tlloughts pertaining to the defjnition of excactly what politics should encompass: the most staunch conservatives see it as a way of maintaining the status quo through control of the legislative bodies that regulate almost all facets of the nation. The steadfast liberal seeks to utilize politics as an avenue for change, for the fact tbat there are so many social ills stiU present in society means to them that our system is not reaching everyone it could. Social unrest and popular discontent from the middle classes is what will bring the. most rapid mandate for change here in the Uriited States. Once that voice has been hardened by resolve, it will then be time to attack the volatile issues that confront our elected officials every day. Back in the 1960s, a period that fostered widespread protest in the U.S. over any number of ·issues, there were political figures en masse who enveloped the spirit of this era with a liberal stance. This new liberalism induced many to fight vigorously for various goals producing a national frenzy of political activity unsurpassed to this day. Before legendary people such as John F. Kennedy, bolstered by such wondrous words as 'ask not what your country coulci do for you, but what you can do for your country,' were able to develop a near cult following by having a sympathetic national constituency carry such topics as racism and war to the brink of societal upheaval. Kennedy, though known as an often vicious political mastermind who wo11ld abuse his far-reaching strength put of the public eye~ was instrumental in orchestrating a / Democratic party that identified with the common people, some~hing that seems simple but can be easily overlooked when confronted with the vast problems of a nation. In the same time frame, Martin Luther King Jr. rallied an oppressed people to fight for equality and the outright elimination of discrimination. He, with an unsurpassed charisma and vitality to point out a most hideous societal inadequacy, was effective in convincing the black race that they indeed were not inferior. The common denominator and bottom line here is that both political legends transformed their respective arena into a showcase of talent that produced a feeling of accomplishment in America, while turning society's attention from the shadier aspects of politics. In essence, .the diversion was instrumental in pointing people , in a constructive, not demoralized direction. Maybe ilT\\our nation today, someone like ·a Kennedy or King 1 is ~~;~d~d. to inJ~~.t. passion arid purpose into a field that for too long has been downgraded because of dirty dealings and hollow promises. This should surely not be taken to advocate a throwback to the sixties, where peace · rallies, sit-ins, and anti- g.ove:rnment campaigns p~rvaded all·of society. That is an era gone by, for a new generation now dominates society. · Perhaps, though, it would be beneficial to a:ll of the United states if there were some significant strides made toward bettering the entire system, a:p effort that everyone can participate and rally around. W ~ need to return the pride and esteem to politics that has been lost for some years. Hopefully in the near future a worthy group or organization will step forward into the national spotlight, not because of scandal, but progress and accomplishment. It's doubtful that there's another JFK out there to invigorate an entire population. But the possibility that there miglit should be enough·· to keep u~. go\ng· . .fm;. the timt being.

Dean Alford also added that it would be much appreciated if anyone in the school community, who has any pertinent information concerning the matter, would contact the Dean's office. According to Dean Mammola, the investigation will be completed \as soon as we feel that we have all the necessary information. co.ncordiensis' efforts to obtain a comment from the fraternity proved to be futile. Adam Paget, President of the Delta Phi fraternity, would say only that \the house is doing everything we can to cooperate with the school.\ A Delta Phi pledge, when asked for his ,feelings on the matter, responded with a hostile expression of \no comment.\ No other response concerning the allegations could be obtained from the fraternity at this time. The investigation which hss been underway for some time now, will not be closed until all possible information regarding these incidents is obtained. For the present time, the Delta Phi fraternity will remain \in good standing\ with the administration.

May 2, 1991 FEATURES (!lonrorbirtt.shl s The Deadly Combination of Drinking and Driving By SHERYL DE VORE Courtesy of Curr~n t Health All he had was a few beers. \I'm fine,\ he told his friends as he .got into the car to drive them home. Minutes later, two cheerleaders who were in the car with him were dead. Another teenager, also in the same car, was paralyzed from the waist down. Chances are that something like has happened in your hometown. In fact, each year 8,500 teens are killed in alcohol-related accidents .. while another 40,000 are disfigured. Alcohol-related highway deaths are still the number-one killer of 15- to 24- year olds. What is it about the mixing of drinking and driving that is so deadly? What you may not realize is that the first thing affected when you're drinking is your judgment. When you've had even one or two drinks, you may think you're able to drive safely. Youire not. Slowing Down Alcohol slows the muscles that enable you to .react quickly to a child darting out in front of you on the road. It may take you twice as long to slam on the brakes, and that could mean the difference between life and death. Alcohol also .slows your eye muscles, reducing your ability to control the amount of light entering your eyes. Your vision may become blurred. Your eyes may not focus on that headlight coming towards you until it's too late. The effects of alcohol on any individual depend on many factors, such as how much you drink and how fast you drink it. Teenagers who ·chug-a-lug beers get drunk faster than a person who sips one cocktail in an hour. Statistics show that if you're not experienced at drinking and you've also been driving for only a few years, alcohol can negatively affect your driving ability. The fact is that drinking drivers between the ages ·Of 16 and 24 years have three times the number of fatal auto accidents as older drivers. Why not? Because alcohol is a depressant. When a depressant gets into your bloodstream, it depresses -- or relaxes -- your central nervous system. Alcohol might make you feel relaxed, confident, and less inhibited at a party, but it will also give you a false sense of security on the road. You can't be laid back when you're drivin.g. You need to stay alert to watch for.cars that come out of nowhere and for unex.pected curves in the road. Th.e effects of alcohol also depend on body size. If you weigh 100 pounds and drink two drinks ip an hour, you'll have more alcohol in your bloodstream than the 160- pound person who drank the same amount in the same period of time. All of these factors affect your blood alcohol content Reduce, Reuse, Separate And Recycle Are ·You \ Happy With ··Your Meal . . Plan? * WANTED:. · Students interested in itnproving the . . . . . . \ . :· Meal Plan through .weekly meetings ' ·with Dining Services managers.lf interested, meetings ate Wed. 3,~4, contact ~ox 1914 or call x4096 or x60SO. . · (BAC), which is the amount of alcohol present in your blood. In most states, if your BAC is .10 or higher, you are legally drunk. That means that there's one-tenth of one percent alcohol in your blood. If you drink two drinks in one hour -- beer, wine, or mixed drinks -- you can be legally drunk. Inueasing the Effects If you take a cold capsule or an allergy pill and then drink, you're likely increasing the effects of alcohol on your driving ability. Mixing other drugs with alcohol can more quickly impair your ability to drive safely. Two cold capsules and a beer may be all you need to lost the .good judgment and coordination you must have when you get behind the wheel. Don't expect a cup of coffee. a glass of cola, a cold shower. or fresh air to lower your BAC and make you more fit to drive. It has been proven that none of these so-called drunk remedies can sober you up. You won't be sober until the alcohol is out of your system. That takes time--about an hour for each drink you've had, whether it's been a can of beer, a glass of wine, or a mixed drink. Recent studies have shown that your driving ability can be impaired for some time even after you've sobered up. Getting Arrested When you drink and drive. you're risking the chance of getting arrested. The number of drunk driving arrests in the Vnited States has increased by 300 percent in the past 20 years~ When a police officer stops you, you. will be asked to perform some tests, such as closing your eyes and touching your finger to your nose. A police officer .can often guess your SAC just by shining light into your eyes .. He knows that your pupils react to light differently when you've beeo drinking. After the tests, the police officer may charge you with. drunk driving, read you your rights, handcuff you, and bring you to the police station where you'll be tested for your BAC. In many states, if you refuse the BAC test, you automatically ;lose your license for a minimum of three months. That's a long time to rely on others to take you to a friend's h:ouse, get you to .a football game, or get you to work. If you are found guilty, you can lose your license for even longer. You can also be fined $1,000, and you can even be sent to prison. Facing the Law Drunk driving laws are getting stricter every year, especially dri ,rs under the age of 21. Some examples: • In Maine, drivers who are under the legal drinking age and have a BAC of .02 or higher may lose their license for a year. {One beer can give you a BAC of ;02.) A similar law exists in Or~gon. • In Illinois, Indiana, and other states, drivers under the age of 21 now carry licenses that boldly display the words, \Under21.\ • Second offenses carry stiffer penalties. In some states, an 18-year-old twice-convicted driver may be witllout a driver's license for three years. • Drunk driving records are available to the public. Police may release reports to local newspapers that print the names of those a.Frested under bold headings such as \Driving Under the Influence.\ • Insurance companies greatly raise the auto insurance rates of drunk drivers. They may even cancel their policies. • If you're looking for a job you ma:; find yourself answering this question on an application form: \Have you ever been convicted of a crime?\ Drunk driving is a crime. There is an alternative. Teens who are in a situation where there is drinking should choose a \designated driver,\ one person in the group who abstains completely from drinking so that he or she can drive friends home safely. The next time you've had a drink and are planning on driving, or the next time a friend who has been drinking tells you he or she is OK to drive, think twice. Consider not only the way alcohol affects your ability to drive but also what may happen if you get stopped for drunk driving. SENIORS Thought About Speaking At Commencement?

!R!I 6 ill111t0lrbtrttzts 11\ITERI\IATIDI\IAL FEATURE!i . _May z, 1991 Under The Russian Gun Eye On The orld y Ed Menke Just yesterday, someone said to me, \Doesn't it seem Eke Bush · just got elected? I can't believe we're starting d1e campaign (stuff) already .... And, while some of us are following our graduation countdowns (the magic number now hovering somewhere around · forty-five) and others are counting down the number of days until the next May Day (now cl()sing in on the three hundred sixty mark), there are still others who are blowing the fresh dust off their campaign calendars, scheduling appearances and speeches and 'photo opp's, and figuring out who will beat whom in 'Ninety-two.\ · Yes, Ninety-two. In just twenty short months, America will be deciding who will be the nex.t President of the United States. In over a year and a half, we will have the right to vote for our country's leaders. But it is the job of some, rather, the job of many to begin the insulting, mud-slinging, painstakingly lengthy process which has typified the American Presidential campaign. · Why do we, who cling so dearly to our freedom of speech, feel the . need to exercise tllis right over a period which covers one half of the term in question? Where in the First Amendment does it list the right of an incumbent to insult his or her opponent for half of the time that he or she serves as President? In other countries, the campaign process is limited to several months, or even weeks (GASP). In Britain, campaign budgets are minute in comparison to those in America, and parties campaign for only several weeks. In Austria, the same is true. In France, as in most other countries, the campaigns are not based, as they are here, on debasing opponents and delving into the private lives of those who are on the campaign trail. That's not to say that tabloids don't dig for 'the big story' on some candidate's closet skeletons, because they do. But, in only two, three, or four weeks, how.much t;an you find out about a candidate? A journalist has to get right to the issues, or he or she will run out of time. So why don't they do it this way in America? Wouldn't it be nice if Washington, D.C. was concerned about what's going on in this country and in the world, instead of worrying about \Four More : Years\ for the Dynamic Duo? Why not? I'd much rather see our President serve a full four-year term, and not serve two years in office and two more on the re-election campaign. One option is to · have all Presidential terms last six years, without chance for re- election. This has some merit and some shortcomings, but it's worth discussing. Anything different from the current system ought to be looked into. But that's just one guy's solution. By LARAE TUMIDAJEWICZ It was 11 pm on a Saturday night. Like many students here at Union, I was getting ready to go out. This particular night I had an i.•wite to a semiformal and I was really excited about going. I had just dabbed· on some perfume and was grabbing my jacket to go out the door, when my next door neighbor came running into her room shouting, \the Russian's coming!!!\ I tried to lock my door and escape, but it was too late. Andrey had arrived armed with his new $14.95 deluxe water gun from Woolworth's. I had no choice but to jump back into my room and slam the door shut behind me. I could hear the strong blast of water thrashing against my memo board. I was being held hostage in my own room. My evaluation of the situation was that if I sit tight for a few minutes he would go away without any major confrontations. Boy, was I in for a surprise. Five minutes had passed and I hadn't heard much commotion in the lounge. I figured it would be safe; I peeked out through a slightly opened door only to get a squirt of water in my face. This meant war ..... Although I do not own a water pistol, I planned to take on this little Russian with anything and everything I had. My first form of ammunition was a large milk that I had saved from the Skellar from that Monday. It smelled pretty bad, which made it even a more enticing weapon. I opened the door and threw it straight at him. A direct hit! I was very GOOD NEWS! Foreign language news programs will be shown in the Language Lab (HU OJ 0). All are we[c()me to attend.

He had gone tQ the bathroom to wash eff the milk--so I had thought. flis real reason for leaving was to reload to 'really let me have it now.' Next I tried to reason with him, explaining that there was a time to have fun, but that one must know when to stop. Unfortunately for me, Alldrey felt the same way, but that the time to stop was not now. I searclted around my room for something to use next. My roommate had gone home for the weekend, so I was on my own in tile adventure. Aha! Just what I was looking far-- cheez whiz. Not any old cheez whiz, but the kind in the spray can. Again I slowly opened the door a crack and sprayed. Damn it. The sttipid stuff got all over me! This .only made Andrey laugh and i got even angrier at him. It was at this point I could not take any more of this nonsense. It was already 11:28 pm and l was late to meet my friends. I had to take action fast, so I threatened him with a call to the police. I figured a naive foreign student m:ight believe Sl!Cil a scheme. The thing I ha<i neglected to recall was that .Andrey was in good with the Schenectady police, after a visit to the police station in, the ~all. Jh:e sergeant loved his questions ·,and even gave him one of those ridiculous· silhouettes of men that cops practice shooting at as a souvenir. I had no choice but to telephone the campus security. \Hello. You're not going ·to believe this, but I have to be at a semifonnal and I cannot leave my room because the Russian exchange student is holding me hostage at water gun point. Can you help me?\ The officer taking the call wondered if I had been drinking, but said someone would be right over to assist me. As luck would have it, a friend from Moscow had phoned Andrey and he had left me alone. Mr. Gibson, the security driver, thought I was nuts, But I was able to get an escort to where I wanted to go, and I arrived safe and sound. I was mad at Andrey for several days after this incident. Now I see it as being one .of .the fond memories I will have of him when he returns home to the Soviet Union. I realized that his stay in America is just like an extended spring break for any one of us~ We all want to have fun and to make the most out of our vacations. I still get mad at Andrey sometimes when he takes his little things too far, but I realize these are the things which make him such a fun person to be with. These . are-· the things that make me proud to say that he is my friend.

May 2, 1991 11\JTE.RI\IATIDI\IAL FEATURE§ <!brnrvrbirnsts ' Sun, Sand, and Spanish Class By STEPHANIE DAVIS and KIMilERLEE BRODY WhHe most of Union was battling the harsh Schenectady winter, those on the term abroad -to Mexico were enjoying its many pleasures. The sun was out every day and there was an abundance of Corona and Cuervo. We recently talked with Denise Adams, who had many good things to say about the trip. Her Mexican family consisted of her \father who is an accountant, and her \mother who is a housewife. She had a seventeen year old \sister\ and a fourteen year old \brother.\ Her \sister\ was the only one to know a little bit of English. Denise was fortunate to have her own bedroom, bathroom and television. able to get to know Prof. Nichols. She would like to say a special thanks to \The Skipper,\ \for being a great friend and making it a great ten weeks.\ Being immersed in Mexican society allowed fer great improvement in the Spanish skills ·Of many of the students. Thus, Denise encourageseveryone to go on a term abroad \to meet other people and experience the best Opportunity available to Union students.\ g:. ' .'Wfil'. \Everyone sitting on a pyramid.\ Invitation to A Brazili11n Film . , .Iub~aba Classes were taught at Centro Bilingue. Denise took Spanish grammar, a Mexican history and customs class, and Global Development with an emphasis on Mexico, taught by Byron Nichols, who accompanied the group in Mexico. Classes were taught from 8:00-2:00 every day. In addition, Global Development was taught from 2:00-4:00 two or three times a week. This is certainly different from the Union schedule in Schenectady. There are a few warnings before you pack your suitcase and grab your passport. Don't drink the water. Many .suffered from illness due to the difference in the composition of the water. An ice cube could even be hazardous to your health. The presence of scorpions and huge cockroaches must also be considered before grabbing your sunscreen. However, they pose no real threat. (About Brazilian Race Relations, Love, and Afro-Brazilian Religion) May 8 Mobile Lounge - Colll!ge Center 4th Floor, Room 406 7:00 - 9:00 P.M. Denise enjoyed many aspects of the trip. She liked living with her family very much. She said that it was a good experience living in a new environment. She also remarked upon the closeness of the group. With a group of less than twenty people, it was easy to get to know everyone well. Denise also said that she was While the trip to Mexico is a great experience, it only takes place every other year. Nex:.t winter, the term abroad takes place in Spain. While the environment is completely different, it is just as enjoyable. Spain is in close proximity to the rest <>f Europe, which allow for a great deal of traveling. Right now is a great time for student travel with such services as the International Student Identification Card, youth hostels. and Council Travel, which all provide substantially lower prices on travel costs and lodgings. Visit the term abroad office for more infonnation on all of the term abroad programs and student services. This film, in Portuguese without English subtitles, is easily understandable to Non-Portuguese spe~kers. Before the film, _Pro;. Jacqueline Weinstein will discuss the Jorge Amado Book, Jub~a (1944), on wnich the film is based. There will be a discussion after the f.ilm.

EDITORIAL (!!Jlltfllfbirnsis -----Founded at Union College 1877---- No No Support, ltnprove~nents While the college community eagerly awaits the impl~rnentat~on of President Roger H. Hull's numerous proposals for tmprovmg Union College, it has become increasingly apparent that present conditions at our institution are by no means conducive to even the most minute degree of transformation. . Although most of ·the turmoil has died down re.gardm.g .the decision not to review Visiting Professor of Enghsh W1lham Hathaway's contract, the issue remains uru:esolv~. ~ltho':lgh o~er 1,000 students signed a petition announcmg therr dissausfacuon with the way in which the Hathaway case was han~led. most ~e unaware of the results of a faculty vote on a resolution requesting President Roger Hull to perform a review of the immediate case in addition to existing procedures. In light of the surprising victory of t~e resolution ~nd Wl!idst the student apathy which ensures, the ball1s now back ~n Hulls court. Although it is unclear as to whether or ~ot he will. succu~b to faculty pressures, it is obvious that Presrdent Hull IS now m an extremely precarious situation. . If Hull decides to do nothing regarding the facul~y's req~est, hts . relations with the faculty may in fact be irrepar.ably J~opardized. <?n the other hand, if he changes his stance, his positiOn. as. Ch1ef Administrator will be dangerously weakened. Moreover, m light of all the publicity, it is unclear as to whether or not Hathaway can still receive a fair trial. Unfortunately, President Hull has proven to be a very astute politician, eager to please all, at all times. For. the sake of the present college community and in hopes. of a bnghter.futur? ~or Union College, let us aspire that our pres1dent mak~s his dec1s~on in such a way that will allow us to dispose of th1s unbecommg characteristic. . Furthermore, let us assume that President Hull will do what Is best for the college community. It is time. to restore the recently misplaced trust on this campus. Why not gtve the man the benefit of the doubt? After all, if we work with him, as opposed to against him, there is always that possibility that he may indeed begin to work with us. _ On a lighter note, any educated person could allude to th~ fact that Hull has some great ideas for this instit';Ition. Perhaps •. If we begin to give this man some support, he will be able to ms~ll . his much needed ideas for improvements. The college commumty was unhappy with President Morris because he ~d no~ing. 'l}le new president wants to do a lot. Unfo~unately, tf v:e fad to gtve him some slack, changes will not be vtable and wtthout change, there will be no improvement. Where, Oh Where Did Cainp Union Go? As spring term progresses, the void le~t by the elimination of Camp Union becomes more and more obvtou~. The .~eeke~d-l~ng celebration was for many years Union Colleges tradtttonal Spnng Fling.\ It was a time when students could show ?ff the school to their friends and everyone could join together m a weekend of partying sponsored by the school. It was the weekend that everyone looked forward to as the highlight of spring term. . . However with the changing of the New York State drink~ng laws, the administration came to the conclusion ~at Camp Umon was too problematic to continue. Instead of commg up wtth ~ays to eliminate some of the problems or replacing the weekend With a similar festival, the entire event was scrapped. This measure once again left the role of entertaining the campus to the Gree_k supported events. Unfortunately, th~se. days ~e Greek system IS struggling, against new restnctwns m!-posed ~y th.e Administration, to try to give students somethmg to do m therr free time besides go to the library. The events allowed to run include the Greek Volleyball Tournament, Greek week and the Delta Gamma Olympics. The only real eve~t s~onsored by the administration is Fitzhugh Ludlow Day, whtch ts only one ~Y long. None of thee can really compare to the success and populanty of Camp Unions in the past. With the elimination of Camp Union, Union College beco!lles one of the few well-known colleges with no large scale festival sponsored by the school. When-one is. comparing it .to other institutions this shortcoming makes Umon stand out m a less than favorable way. When prospective students c?nsider c?lleges, they worry about many things.--academics, locat1on, houst?g and also social life. Thus, if Umon wants to stay afloat wtth ~e increasing competition between colleges, it must begin to provtde a satisfying social life to its student body. It is not good for Admissions, when upperclassmen answer questions about the social life by sayin~, \Well ~e used to h~ve thing during the spring called Camp Umon, but thmgs are gettmg a lot stricter now and they got rid of it.\ The time has come for ~e Administration to think about creating new ways t? entertam students or at least stop taking away the few that extst and are successful. LETTER!i· May 2, 1991 Short -Sighted Assumptions On Feminism To the Editors: I am writil)g to comment upon your April 25 editorial \Coeducation is Acceptable, Feminism is Not.\ The assumptions inherent to it are unreasoned, uninformed, and short-sighted. Co-educaton theoretically is the idea that men and women are allowed equal cpportunities, both in and cut of the classroom. Just because women have been granted the ability to co-exist at Union has not automatically made them equal on campus. Although you imply that women are the sole beneficiaries of co- education and that women can only gain advantages at the expense of men, you fail to see that true equality does actually \contribute to the Union College community as a whole.\ Although you are able to \universally\ define and approve of co-education for us, you do not undetstand that \the education of men and women at the same institution\ is meaningless unless it is equal. You do not define feminism, but it can be said that its general premise works toward the equality of women and men. You contradict yourself by stating that \co-education does not mean that feminism is acceptable,\ unless you mean to say that it is all right for the education of men and women to be unequal so long as it is not separate. Co-education is feminism in action. While you attenpt to \assert that gender discrimination is virtually nonexistent\ at Union College, you state no specifics which lead you to this conclusion. In fact, sexism is alive and well in most areas of theis campus. In November 1988, the Co-education Study Group reported the responses of 284 women who answered questionnaires about their experiences and observations on campus. When asked if \Have you ever been treated in a sexist manner\ by male faculty, 31.0% agreed; when asked about their male peers, 67.5% agreed. When asked \Have you ever experienced ALL LETIERS TO THE EDITOR MUST BE TYPED, DOUBLE SPACED AND SUBMITIED TO THE CONCORDIENSIS OFFICE BY 4:00 P.M.

Taking into account recent Crosstalks, these figures still reveal a valid evaluation of women at Union. In a discussion last term about graffiti on campus, slides disclosed the extent of sexist attitides towards women. For instance, a person defined ••wife\ as \something you screw on the bed to get the housework done\ and a list of women students followed the title \Ten Biggest Whores\. In the classroom, women experience incidents of overt sexism, such as professors discrediting their intellingence in order to motivate the class {\If Blondie understands, then everyone can. In my next life, I'm going to marry a blonde.\) Fwthermore, as a result of the male-taught, male-dominated classroom, women are ignored, verbally dismissed, and outwardly silenced by male professors and students who do not think the contributions of women are worthy of recognition. In another area of student life, women athletes face inequities in staff, facilities, publicity, and equipment. They are not acknowledged· for their achievements comparable to those of men. Your editorial reveals another point :on· which you are uninformed about gender-- discriminaton. Of the recent changes made toward the betterment of co-education, those which you find to be \a sheer and utter outrage\ you cite only the attempts to change the school motto and the switch from Gatesman to Gatekeeper. According to the Guidelines for Nonsexist Use of Language (published by the National Council of Teachers of English in 1974) \'Sexism' may be defined as wot:ds ot actions that arbitrarily assign roles or characteristics to people on the basis of sex.\ Consequently, our motto and the title Gatesman are sexist. Your view concerning these changes as \an illustration of our distorted conceptions and acute ignorance regarding co- education\ is another blatant contradiction, unless you think it is all right for sexism to exist in a co-educational community. Sexism wiH continue to exist if the misconceptions about co-education and feminism that you promote in your editorial remain unchallenged. If gender discrimination \is virtually non-existent\ as yon contend, then editorials such as yours would not be published.

1991 Feminist Stereotypes Consolidated In Editorial To the Edi!C_)rs: We feel compelled to express our disagreement with· the editorial in last week's Concordiensis entitled \Co- education is Acceptable, Feminism is Not.\ Firstly, the editorialasserts that women are continuously and selfishly ~rying to make things better for themselves without regard for their male peers. Clearly, the author does not understand the definition of feminism. Feminism does not mean that women totally disregard the status of men. To the contrary, feminism ad vacates the equality between men and women not the exploitation of one by the other. Is achieving equality a selfish intention? Until reading this article, we had assumed that most educated people had transcended beyond the antiquated notion that feminism is anti -male, yet that stereotype is perpetuated in this editorial. Secondly, the editorial states that gender discrimination is virtually non-existent at Union. Is Union a gender utopia? Does Union fund athletics equally? Are acquaintance rape and sexual harassment issues that do not need to be discussed here? Perhaps the author has not witnessed any sexual discrimination in h-is/her academic or .social life here at Union in which case· he/she is fortunate. We do not mean to suggest that women have not made tremendous strides here at Union in the last twenty years or that discrimination is rampant, but to deny its existence is foolish, clangerous and simply untrue. The stereotypes that the aathor associates with feminism tum the focus away from the real issues of concern about equality on this campus. Maybe changing the school motto and the nam~ of the tour guides is not the best approach toward achieving equality, but the stereotyes that the author supports oaly defeat the strive toward equality in a co-educational environment such as Union. Sincerely, Jennifer Holmes Susan Kannel False Pretenses Given to Feminists To the Editors: The editorial of April 25th entitled \Co-Education is Acceptable, Feminism is Not\ misreads and assigns false pretenses to the feminist movement in general and to the role of women at Union College in particular. Feminism is not the female counterpart to male chauvinism; rather, it is the belief that women should have the same rights as men. Similarly, the Civil Rights movement is not an attempt to dissolve the rights of white people, but to dissolve the ignorance that leads to discrimination. Obviously the author has never been the one woman in an otherwise all-male class who is often complimented by the male professor about how good she looks. Obviously the author has never been at a fraternity house where a man demanded that she \suck back or suck (sexual organ)\ in an attempt to convince her to drink a beer. Obviously the author has not noticed that the prime residences on this campus are mainly reserved for men. Obviously the author has never stood out in the rain in a windbreaker given to the field· hockey team as a rain jacket while a football player stands nearby ill: a fully lined, hooded poncho. Obviously the author has not noticed that 16 or ·19 department chairs are: men, a figwerwhich roughly parallels the fa-culty as a whole. In addition, the author has obviously not noticed that not one of the four dea11s or four vice presidents at this college is a woman. If women have made such great strides, as the author contends, then how can these inj11stices continue? lf the author has not noticed any of thse things, then she/he is either writing from ignorance or does not recogni:ze these occurrences as symptoms of sexual inequality. Tradition does not excuse discrimination. Moreover, if no one ever tried to enhance their position. because of a \tradition\ of op]Jression, then there would still be slaves, children would be laboring in factories, and the United States would still be part of the British Empire. The women here are not disregarding their male counterparts, they are trying to overcome the traditionof ignorance that has led to inequality. Sincerely, Karen Nedderrneyer '92 Andrew Seewald '91 An Ad Hoc Tenurability Committee has been formed for Donna Burton, Assistant Professor in the Library. Members of the College community wishing to comment on the professional perfonnance, scholarship, or college service of Ms. Burton should write to Martin Benjamin, Department of the Arts, Arts Building. <llnn.rnr.btrnsis 13 Feminist Editorial Testimony to Lack of A ware ness To the Editors: I would like to comment on last' week's Concordiensis editorial \Co-Education Is Acceptable, Feminism Is Not\. First, there apears to be a basic misunderstanding of what feminism is. To many, the word has negative and anti- male connotations. Modern scholarly feminism, however, encompasses many perspectives: liberal feminism, radical feminism, socialist feminism, marxist feminism, 1 conservative feminism. 1 Feminists are not a unified colleetiveity, yet underpinning all feminist theory are the following common features: I. a belief that women as a group are socially subordinated or disadvantaed, 2. a recognition I of the extent to whjch social 1 life is gendered, and 3. a commitment to exploring points 1 and 2. Gender, like race and class, is a profoundly important categorization that divides and disadvantages some members of our society, that shapes social interaction, and that influences public policy. As members of a distinguished institution of higher learning, we at Union should welcome the exploration of such issues, not dismiss them. The editorial cited two recent actions that it claimed advance 1 the cause of women on campus to the detriment of men. They were: changing the name of our campus guides from Gatemen to Gatekeepers, and the proposal to modify the wording of the College motto to include women. The editorial wrongly implied that these were the actions of a conspiracy of feminists. They were not. The change to Gatekeeper was an action taken by President Hull {other people, of course, may also have suggested it). The proposal to change the wording of the College motto was initiated by Professor Carl George. Regardless of who initiated them, I fail to see how either change harms men. Finally; the editorial asserts that there 'is no discrimination against women on campus, that everything is fine. Union College is a fine institution, but everything is not fine from the perspective of many women students. The editorial is itself testimony to one of the most serious problems, namely, a lack of awareness. At last week's cross-talk on equality of treatment in the classroom-- a cross-talk attended predominantly by women students-- numerous indidents of sexism in the classvoom were described. An earlier cross-talk discllssed gender inequities in athletics. Serious sexims occurs in the social environment. Too many male students-- certainly not all, but too many-- belittle women. Some do so in response to peer presssure; others may regard their behavior as trivial or amusing. Nevertheless, unwanted and taunting stares, unflattering and unsolicited comments, loud descriptions of women's bodies or appearance, put-downs of women's opinions and ideas are harassing behaviors. Such actions are not trivial. They create anger and confusion. They can attack a person's self worth. They contribute to disengagement. No one can be fully engaged, emotionally or intellectually, in an environment that demeans or is hostile to them. Those students who indulge in such behavior or condone it by their silence are also contributing to a climate in which more serious harrasssment and abuse can take place. For the good of all students and for Union College as a whole we need to recognize what the .problems are and work to change them. We need to make Union an environment that is equally welcoming, supportive, and non-threatening to all students. Many female and male faculty administrators, and students are aware of gender inequities on our campus. We need to work to inform those who are unaware. Then we all need to do something about them. Sincerely, Sharon Gmelch Associate Professor Department of Sociology/ Anthropology and Director of Women's Studies. Misuse of the Word \Co- Education\ To the Editors: A few weeks ago, through publications and advertise- ments, it was brought to the attention of the entire student body that Union would be celebrating a very special 20th anniversary Friday and Saturday, April 26 and 27. Til is \20th Anniversary Celebration of Coeducation at Union\ as it was so entitled, would feature receptions, speakers, entertainment, exhibits, and discussions concerning all sorts of relevant \cooducational\ topics. It was my impression that the term \coeducation\ implied education of both females and males. In fact, according to my copy of the Random House Dictionary, coeducation means \the education of both sexes in the same classes.\ Thus, it was surprising to me that when I attended a few of the events for the weekend, only females were featured, leaving out the male part of \coeducation .. each time. In fact, when I later looked at the schedule of events pbmned for the two-day celebration, I discovered that 011t of nearly 50 studeqts, faculty. and alumni speaking d 1ing the weekend. only three Ithose were male. During the · \20th Anniversary Celebration of Coeducation at Union\ it seems unfair to feature over 45 female speakers and presenters, md only three males. This is especially noteworthy since the three males participated in a panel discussion which took place at 11 a.m. Saturday morning, an event which was least attended in comparison to later events by current Union students. Perhaps it would be unfair not to mention that, in addition, nine other men participated in the weekend's events-- that is, the male acappella group, the Dutch Pipers. who sang background music during the 12:30 luncheon at Old Chapel. However, barring the small male participation • the celebration this past weekend was essentially not \coed\ but rather \female\. This actuality, though, is not the problem at hand here. In fact, I strongly believe that this 20th anniversary is a valid and appropriate event to celebrate! There is no question in my mind, especially after attending some interesting and enlightening presentations last weekend, that the decision made by the Colleg in 1969, to admit females into the graduating class of 1974, was one which successfully strengthened Union, propelling the College through tb.e last two decades as the prestigiious coed11cational institution it continues to be today. What I am addressing, however, is tb.e misuse of the word \coeducation\. If the anniversary was to be entitled, \The 20th Anniversary Celebration of Coeduation at Union\ then let it be just. that. One should expect, as I did prior to reading the schedule of events for the weekend, that both male and female speakers would be featured. One would hope that an annivesary of coeducation would emphasize the successes of both men and women at Union, and perhaps place a spotlight on achievements of both sexes together. However, if the intentions were different, then that is fine so long as the weekend's logo and title reflected the true meaning of the anniversary. Three cheers go out to the \20th Anniverscary Celebration of Women at Union\. The presence of women on this college campus has helped pace the growth of this institution with the constantly changing times of the past two decades. But, please, if that is the celebration, then title it as such. Let's reserve \coed\ for both sexes and give some credit to everyone, both males and females, for the continued success and prestige of Union College and its students, faculty and alumni. Sincerely.

<lloltfllrnfrn.sis Minerva Trail Of Tears To the Editors: \We are all brothers under the eyes of Minerva\-School Motto. Minerva, the goddess of wisdom and learning, has shed a light over the Union campus since its inception in 1795. Minverva looked witll great favor on Ol:lr campus, which was founded as the Union of all faiths. This non-religious aunosphere helped to generate a feeling of brotherhood among the men that came to Union College in the past almost 200 years. Religious toleration was practiced and was an integral part of our school since the beginning of our school. Since 1970, Union has added me and my sisters to the campus and together we have strived to hold Minerva's hand as she leads us down a path of learning and knowledge. However, with the Kit Hathaway affair causing ripples of concern througbout the campus community. I unfortunately must tell another sad story about the Ludlow Community in Webster House. Ludlow was founded by the students of Union College as a place of learning and study. It had the noble goals ofbringing together people from different backgrounds and allowing them to learn by simply being together. This program was to be strengthened by the enforcement ofa substance-free environment that would allow people's minds to be unclouded and unpolluted. However, Ludlow is a mockery of these goals. My frrst challenge to Ludlow is that there is no longer a way for people of different backgrounds to apply to Ludlow House. Sure, in the surface, everyone is welcomed to come and join us in our \Living-Learning\ experience. However. the truth is that like many other institutions on this campus, there is an unwritten series of political and social tests that applicants must pass in order to enter Ludlow House. This is just a manifestation of the desire of some .people to have power over someone or somethin,~r. Yes, Minverva, i·t is ugly ~u please turn away. Those applicants that are deemed \undesirable\ are simply not ailewed to live among us. How can we achieve the noble goal of learning from each oth.~r if everyone here is a carbon copy?? What can we learn by communicating to, in essence, ourselves?? The second statement, that Ludlow is a substance-free environment, is simply a parody of reality. Now, I am not saying that L wish to make everyone on this campus not drink or partake in illicit drugs. That would put me in the same light as a crusader telling .the people to either convert or die. No, I simply wish to make the statement that this was the major goal or ideal that the Ludlow House wanted to achieve. The best example of this comedy was our wine tasting party where close to a dozen bottles of wine were consumed by my brethren. I would also like. to point out that Ludlow House receives a great deal of m~ney for \floor activities\. Wine: is not cheap, and though I can make no directconnectio11 nor do I state that I have .any further knowledge of the financial records of Ludlow House, I cannot rule out the possibility that money from Union College may have been used to purchase this alcohol. If this statement is true (which I sincerely do not know), we could become trendsetters. Why have a fraternity with dues for the members wh.en maybe you can get the school to buy the alcohol for you? The only people that can be blamed for this corruption of our ideals is really the people that live inside Ludlow House. We set our own high standards for achieving something more than just a classroom education. Minverva is weeping for her children, who have gone so far astray from the true course. Susan Kersch '91 The Bad Boys of x6911 To the Editors: On Sunday evening around 8:00, we were inv<>lved in an incident where we were harasGed and eventually chased by a man in the VanVranken, Nott Street area. Mter we fled to safety in a frienll's apartment, we called what we believed to be the emergency quick dial to the police- 911. We spent two minutes on the phone with the operatQr who even asked us to spell Schenectady! Despite what you see on television, 911 is an expensive s\ervice. not subscribed to by every community. If you are in an emergency situation call 374-7744 to reach the Schenectady police or 370-6911 to reach campus security, NOT 9'11! We would like to thank the campus security and safety department fO<r their quick response to our cCall. Sincerely, MargMet Parsons '91 Kristin Neibergs '92 · EARTH DAY ..

We commend you for your vigor! However, after reading your article, we we~e baffled by your perception of feminism and left wondering who is to be accused of \distorted conceptions and acu.te ignorance.\ · ·Your assumption that feminists are women who are \continuously and selfishly trying to make things better for , themselves on this campus without any regard for their .. male peers\ is faulty on two counts. Firstly (and this is perhaps the most glaring oversight in your argument), you fail to acknowledge male feminists. Secondly, you assume that only women are to benefit from actions taken to aid the progress of equality between men and women. By choosing to admit women to Union (which was certainly a breach in tradition at the time), Union recognized that men and women greatly benefit each other in the educational process. The college also made a long standing commitment to continuously strive to make this environment of education a better one, which includes openness to change. As for your statement on preserving tradition-- we are in full support of preserving the tradition and principles of diversity and inclusiveness ~:~pon which Union was founded. The vary name \Union\ was symbolic of the merging of churches in Schenectady. Also, the school motto was written in French, rather in than in the old style of Greek or Latin, as a sign of Union's progressive nature. Your ignorance is further exemplified in your choice of the two examples to demonstate female feminism gone awry. If you had done your homework, you would be aware that the change in school motto finds a strong proponent in Professor Carl George, and the move to change \gatesman\ to \gateskeeper\ was supported by President Roger HuH (unless we are mistaken, both of these people are of the male persuasion). We do support these changes and acknowledge them as moves towards inclusiveness, not attempted exclusiveness or female superiority, as your edi to:rial seems to suggest. We realize that the significance of such change lies mainly in drawing attention to greater inequalities at Union and more serious· change needed. On what basis do you rest your assertion that \gender discrimination is virtually nonexistent\ at Union? We wish that you would, in your own ' words, \stop hallucinating\ and recognize _ - -~·. that there is plenty or~rliom for improvement at Union. A survey · conducted in our sophomore year by the Committee on Co-education found, among other things, that 68.7% Qf women respondents had experien(;ed unwanted comments in a social setting due to their gender, 67.5% had been treated in a sexist manner by male peers, and only 16.7% were satisfied with the way in which the . ahtletic budget was allocated. This yea_r, two panel discussions were held where women and men testified to inequalities found in both the athletic and academic arenas (there will be an article in next week's Con c Qr die n.s ls dealing with the \Cross-talk\ on inequalities faced in the classroom). Finally. we would like to suggest that although your vigor is to be praised, your energies would be better spent educating yourself on the issue of male/female relationsltips at Union; perhaps attending a workshop led by the peer facilitators, or a look .at the Report of the Committee on Coeducation, would be a step in the right directio11. The \College comunity as a whole\ needs more and better communication between men and women-- not intolerance and discouragement of dialogue. Michael Migliozzi '91 KaraMerrill '91 • • • And Bennett's~ Four Points To the Editors: This letter is regarding that very \eloquent\ editorial in our noteworthy newspaper, The Concordiensis on April 25, 1991. I do not think it worthy of too many words, but I do wish to say the following: did not exist then the existing status of women at this college would not be in question. Wouldit? · away with two hundred years of tradition\ at Union College, then by all means, it mtJst be done. 1) Co-education and gender discrimination are not mutually exclusive. That is like saying racism disappeared with the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. As a woman of color on this campus, I am intimately associated with both forms of discrimination. If it 2) If co-education is acceptable, then feminism must also be acceptable. Since it is through feminism that women could become educated at this bastion of tradition. How else does the editor think she got here? 3) Co-education does imply that we must mofidy that part of tradition that prevented women from entering institutions of higher education. If it means \doing 4) I think that the editor will realize that all the privileges that are granted to her (and- all the other women who support her views) now as a young, white woman will all cbange when that youth that is her trump card in this patriarchal society disappears. Perhaps, then feminism will become a real issue to her. Perhaps then it will be acceptable.

May 2, 1991 Administrators or Public Relations Officers? To the Ediwrs: After almost three yearsh~re at Union, I can honsetly say that I am thoroughly disgusted with the actions of our unresponsive administraton. After several instances in which I have dealt with the administration, all that has been accomplished are empty promises, false accusatons, and a long stream of cover-ups. Ale you administrators or public rel~tions officers? Stop telling the students that you're listening to what we're saying. Stop telling us that you're doing the best that you can. SHOW us that you've heard us. ACT on what we've said and done. ·After a nation-wide search, an almost unanimous departmental vote, two administrators, in their infinite wisdom, have made a· heavy- handed , irresponsible, ad-hoc decision, regarding the dismissal of Professor H,athaway. This decision is an insult and a slap in the face to Professor Hathaway, the English department, and to the students. Not only has this decision undermined and devalued the professional opinion of the faculty, it has sparked an enraged student body, faculty and staff to demand reconsideration ofthe decision. President Hull claims''ibe decision was based \solely on the [student] evaluations\ {as stated in the Concordiensis on 4/11/91). These student evaluations are extremely important and should be taken into consideration, but can a system of numbers ranging from one to five warrant the dismissal of a well respected professor, artist and scholar? Shouldn't the hundreds of protesting students and faculty members tell you that maybe ... just maybe you've missed something? If you sincerely took the time to read all 337 student evaluations (which do not even cover 1/2 of the time Professor Hathaway has been here) wouldn't it also be worth your time to listen to your faculty, or give Professor Hathaway an interview? Presid~nt Hull has admitted that the procedure \was probably not handled as well as it should have been ... However... if the matter had been conducted differently, it would have arrived at the same conc-lusion.\ What kind of a statement is that? That is like a judge saying \that trial probably wasn't as fair as it should have been, but the defendant is probably guilty anyway .•.. so hang him.\ In a court of law a fair trial and due process are guaranteed as Constitutional rights. Among professionals, I guess it would simply be expected or assumed. As administrators, you have wrongfully put yourselves in the position of judge and jury, and you have made your decision without the consideration of anyone within the college community. And. by doing so, you have left an innocent man to hang. This debate is not a 4ebate over the quality, talent, or value of Professor Hathaway. I think that has been clearly established by his students, colleagues and peers. It is a debate over a procedure by which 011e administrator, can overrule an almost unanimous departmental vote (9-1), dismiss a professor of seven years and receive full support from th.e president of the College. It is about a process by which two men can dismiss a Professor against the best judgment of the faculty and offer no defense, no explanation, no reasons. After about three weeks of protests and letters on behalfof Professor . !fa,th_a~~Y, ., the administration had done nof:l).ing . but admit a personal bias toward the English department, admit procedural mistakes. and hop.ed that this mess would pass over. Now, it has been approximately four weeks now and the petitions are gone, the protesting students have given up their signs and banners, and this entire issue has, for the most part, been laid to rest. As students and faculty, we should not let this debate die and be covered up along with all the other problems and bad decisions that our administration has brushed under the carpet. Perhaps we have been forced to accept the dismissal of Kit Hathaway; a man whose ingenuity, invention, innovation and intelligence should never have been questioned. But, if we are pacified and content to let this decision stand without reconsideration and reevaluation through a fair and just process, who will be next? Sarah Dudzic '92 . The English Dept. is conducting a reappointment review of Professor Bonney MacDonald. All members of the Union community familiar with her teaching, scholarship, or college service are encouraged to send written comments to Prof. Peter Heinegg, Chairman, English Dept. LEIIER!i @nnr.orhitttsf.s 1s Alumni Supports Hathaway To the Editors: The following constitutes an open letter to President Roger Hull. The word is rapidly , circulating among alumni, from Massachusetts to Arizona, about the campus unrest resulting from Union's firing of Professor William Hathaway. You are new to the college, President Hull, it is expected that mistakes will be made early on in your term as president. It is unacceptable however, that many will suffer the consequences of this error which you alone have the power to reverse. · Of primary concern are the students. The College has · swindled them out of the · opportunity to study with a great man. Little by little, the College pares away the layers of intellectual diversity that are the binding force of a worthwhile education. Kit . Hathaway is one of the finest teachers at Union precisely because he does NOT swim with the current. His words and actions are informed by a life · lived among people and nature, not by a life spent cloistered in the dark corners of a research J.ibrary collecting nuggets of obscure wisdom for a PMLA article. His ideas are fresh; they arise out of well-reasoned personal conviction and intellectual rigour, not out of .convention.al wisdom nor sluttish political correctness. And so one more free soul is gone from Union College, and no longer will students reap the benefits of a perspective intended to make them think for themselves as true individuals. As a student and as an alumna, I came to know Union from a variety of vantage points that elude most students; I feel entitled to say that some of the professors who are most Hkely to be invited to stay at Union, those who wear the uniform you expect them to wear, are participants (real or pretend) in the College's unwritten policy of herd mentality. By firing Kit Hathaway, you send a message to students and professors alike: Do what is expected of you, whether you believe it or not, and you will be safe. Yes, they will be safe. What a lofty goal, indeed, for education! It may surprise you to learn, President Hull, that a college's worth is not measured by its endowment, by whether or not it reaches its fund-raising goal, nor by how huge a fete it can throw for its bicentennial. At the time that Kit Hathaway's fate was being secretly determined by the administrative crowd, I read your letter in the alumni magazine, where you upped the fund-raising ante to $150 million. Now, many ·Of us who know Kit's true value as a teacher, poet and friend wrote letters of supreme support for him. No one in the administration answered us, perhaps because no one bothered to read them, or perhaps because the administration were too preoccupied with digging up anonymous student evaluatoins . that would serve the witch- hunt. How willing you are to come to alumni for their generous input i11 order to further your own agenda?! How hypocritical that alumni have no true voice, however, when it comes to decisions such as the administration made regarding Kit's fate (although I'd wager that if I'd stuffed a check for $5 million in the eavelope with my letter, you might have listened). Does a man of original ideas threaten you so profoundly that you would fly in the face of alumni who hold him in such high esteem that they would act in his behalf, and in lhc face or AAUP regulations governing the terms of how long a college can ethically keep a professor before giving him job security? l sec 110 evidence to the contrary. When you were short-listed for the vacant position, President Hull, I read your impresssive curriculum vitae with interest and admiration. It is unfortunate that your actions don't live up to the integrity one would expect in someone of your credentials. It is unfortunate, too, that you lack the honor both to admit that you made a mistake and to correct it. It is worse than unfortunate-- it sets a dangerous intellectual and moral tone for the future of my alma mater. With deep regret, Joy E. Runyon '88 Term Abroad Laced With Hypocrisy To the Editors: As a perspective, one of the most alluring aspects of Union, were all the opportunities presented for study abroad. The administration made it appear that students had the option to participate in a program that best met their needs, be it run by Union College or another institution. However. as of lately, this is no longer the case. Students now applying for non-Union term abroads, are required to petition the school, by writing an essay, proving why the classes they would take, would be more :beneficial to their major, and education in general, than those offered on a Union program. However, apparently, there must be another issue here, because this is a lot easier said than done. The fact is, Union is refu~ 1 ng to accept the credits from other programs, disenabling students from participating in non-Union term abroads, on the grounds that their educational needs can be equally met on Union programs. It is rather naive for the administration to assume that the experience abroad takes place exclusively in the classroom. As most students that have gone on a term aboard will agree, there is much more to be learned on a term overseas. I find it very hard to believe, as quoted in one student's denial letter requesting credit transferal from a program in Australia, that their \goals could just as well be realized in a Union program in England.\ Apparently, the administration feels that the cultural experience is of secondary importance to that of the classroom. If this were the case~ and the classes were all that mattered, then everyone could stay right here and take them in Schenectady. It appears that the issue here is not solely what is academically beneficial to the students. Perhaps it is that Union is wary to give up all of the tuition that would be lost from students withdrawing, in order to go on other programs. It is rather hypocritical of the administration to encourage terms abroad as they have, even making it part of the General Education curriculum, and then deny many students the opportunity to g(). Maybe more spots should be allotcd on Union pro_gams to accommodate every student who wishes to study abroad or more programs established, perferably in major cities, for students to choose from. And lastly, perhaps the administration should reevaluate what is actually in the best interest of the students.

16 Q[vnrnrbirn~s LETTERS Seniors Surprised By Graduation Speaker To the Editors: We wish to address the senior class and the college community on the issue of the graduation speaker for the class of 1991, Marion Wright Edelman. We believe Ms. Edelman will be an excellent speaker for the ceremony. However, as student representatives to the Hon~rary Degree committee, we are dismayed at the procedure employed to choose this speaker. We intend to report our activities to the senior class, explain the process utilized to select the speaker, and suggest several reforms needed to ensure student participation in the selection of a graduation speaker. During faU term, we sent surveys to all members of the senior class in order to get a sense of the kind of speaker our class favored. These surveys, we stated at the time, were not a voting procedure but were rather a suggestive measure intended for us as representatives to know where our class stood. We intended to ascertain whom our class would support as nominations to the full committee and also to take a step to diminish the widespread im,pression on campus that students have little say in administrative matters. These surveys were an overwhelming success. We were pleased at the response made by the class to these surveys and we made several nominations that we believed corresponded to ,the desires of the class. The committee presented a list of possible names to President Hull in early January. Throughout winter term and during the difficult process of contacting possible speakers, the student representatives were not informed of the progress of the search. In fact, the committee did not meet at all during winter term. In mid- April we were formally notified, to our surprise, that Ms. Edelman would be the speaker. (This was, of course, after she had accepted the President's invitation to come.) We were informed that Ms. Edelman had been a candidate for an honorary degree from Union in previous years, and thus she was still eligible. However, she had not been discussed at any committee meetings this year. From the perspective of student input, the Honorary Degree committee did not achieve the expectations seniors had of its being a representative force for students. The Honorary Degree committee, in the past, has been a purely consultative body having solely the power to suggest possible speakers to the President, who must make the final decision to ask an individual to speak. At present, the committee is composed of two administrators, four faculty members, and three students. This distribution does not accurately reflect the persons on whom the attention of graduation should be placed - the graduating seniors. President HuG had pledged that for the future, no speaker will be chosen or asked to .speak without the full approval of those representing the senior class. lt is now incumbellt on future classes to see that President Hull is fully informed of students' wishes. We propose that the Honorary Degree committee be reconstituted to reflect the interests of students. For the class of 1992, we are currently organizing an interim committee of juniors to begin preparing a list of speakers their class might be interested in. Ideally, this committee should present a list to President Hull by October 1. We would be pleased to work in conjunction with the present committee in establishing a procedure to select more students for representative positions and in choosing a speaker for next year. We are extremely pleased with the speaker chosen for this year. Marion Wright Edelman should be warmly received by the senior class, faculty, and parents. For the future, we hope to have more speakers like Marion Wright Edelman - but chosen in .a manner that the students can substantially participate in. Sincerely, Daniel J. Keniry '91 Hallie Neuberger '91 Facts And Proposals For Eating Disorders At Union To the Editors: I would like to thank all of the students and faculty who responded to my survey dealing with anorexia nervosa and bulimia among Union College women. In return for your assistance, I would like to share some of my findings with the college community, My survey of Union College women reveals that 79.8% are or have previously been on a diet, and that 70.9% exercise regularly. Our society puts forth the message that women \can never be too thin,\ via the media, and through pressures from peers, family members, and the opposite sex. This is reflected in the 69.7% who responded that they were not satisfied with their weight and physical condition; of these women, 57.1% thought they were overweight and 30.6% wanted to be both more toned and thinner. Eating disorders, anorexia and bulimia, are prevalent among white, middle to upper middle class American women in their teens and early twenties. Recent national statistics show that l-4% of women suffer from anorexia, while 6.5 - 18;6% of young women have bulimia. The percentages of both of these disorders were greater than that among Union College women. The student survey revealed that 17.7% of Union women have stopped eating for period of time; 21.1% of the female respondents have forced themselves to throw up to facilitate weight loss. The study also found that there is an increased use of both laxatives and diuretics among women who suffer from an eating disorder. Several trends were revealed. indicating which women were more likely to develop an eating disorder. Bulimia seemed to be influenced by the respondent's year, with 75%of all reported cases of bulimia affecting juniors and seniors. The rates of both anorexia and bulimia were greatest among women living in off campus apartments. Membership in a sorority also seemed to be correlated with the development of an eating disorder, especially bulimia.Although a solid causal relationship cannot be established in one study, these findings suggest that women in a sorority, especially those living in their house. are more likely to ,develop bulimia. Union College women recognize that eating disorders are currently a problem in American society and that they affect a substantial numbet of Union women. According to the student survey, 96.3% of the respondents felt that eating disorders are a current societal problem and 76.2% of the women lmew a Union student with an eating disorder. At the time of my study, the Dean's Office and Health Services were aware of very few Union College women who were afflicted by an eating disorder. It was stressed that help is available, but that the student has to request it. One can receive counseling either on campus or from an off campus counselor. There is also a self- help group run by Conifer Park, that meets at Union once a month. If there is anyone who wants to receive help, or more information regarding either disorder, I urge them to contact either the Health Services, the Counseling Center, or the Dean of Students. Because there is a high rate of eating disorders at Union, I recommend that there be highly publicized educational programs available on campus. For example, I suggest a mandatory program during freshman orientation to inform incoming freshmen women of the problems, their siRns and symptoms. Througho11t the year, there could be workshops in the dorms. I think that greater publicity about where and how to receive help, is of primary importance in preventing and/or curing these disorders. Finally, I want to thank all of my respondents, Ms. Patricia Williams, Assistant Dean of Students. and Ms. Sandy Mosher, Director of the Health Services, for their time and assistance. Melissa Klein '92 May 2, Piri Thomas To Speak To the Editors: I would like tb take this opportunity to encourage my fellow students, as well as all faculty, .staff, and administration members, to attend Piri Thomas' reading and lecture this evening at 7:30 pm. Piri Thomas is a Puerto Rican playwright, essayist, and distinguished author. Thomas has written many books, but two of his best known works are Down These Mean Streets, and Stories From El Barrio. Some Union students may recognize Down These Mean Streets, as it was read in Professor Sharon Gmelch's \Race and Ethnic Relations\ class. Pl~se attend this evening's reading and discussion. It will be at 7:30 pm in the Social Sciences building, Room 113, and promises to be both entertaining and enlightening. Hope to see you there!

In order to prevent any misconceptions about the nature of this centest, we would like to address the fact that the individual fraternities' participation was on a voluntary basis. It was made Start Adhering to 500 Word Limit clear that if they were not comfortable with the contest they could decline. Last year it was quite apparent that the participants took the entire event in the spirit of good humor and we are confident that it will once again be seen in the same light. We hope the entire campus will help us raise money for our national philanthropy - the prevention of child abuse. Thank you for your support. The Sisters of SDT That's it, no more Mister Nice Guy.

Spring term was somewhat of a disaster. Things were progressively being wiped off the calendar as red dots were being spread throughout the campus. Well, this year it looks like we're going to .actually have an epidemic· free spring term. This includes the visiting day of college-~ Parents Weel\end. This idea excited me at first. I mean, this year everyone's parents will be here, not just the ones who have been inoculated for measles. Tllen I started thinking. Half of the student population has never experienced a full fledged Parents Weekend, including myself. The bottom line is, we really don't have a clue what we're supposed to do with our parents for an entire weekend. To make the situation worse, the weekend has to include Sunday because it's Mothers' Day! Well, don't worry about it because I've done the research and there's actually a lot to do. Let's start with the on- campus activities. All weekend long Mountebanks is putting on a production of \Ten Little Indians\. The show is at 8 p.m. on Friday and Saturday nights and at 1 p.m. on Sunday afternoon. Also on Friday night at 8 p.m .• Davie Lanz, a pianist, will be performing in Memorial Chapel. On· Saturday, Professor Berk will be speaking on \The World in Crisis\ at 10 a.m. in the College Center auditorium and at 1 o.m.. there is a rugby game on Library Field. Saturday night, Judge Robert H. Bark will be speaking in Memorial Chapel at 8 p.m. on politics and the constitution, and at 10 p.m., there is a Student Cabaret. There is even more going on than what I have listed, and you can find out all of the details of all the events by speaking with Student Activities. Now, for those of you who want to get away from school, there is also a lot to do. My favorite activity off campus is going out to eat. Basically everybody knows that the Shipyard and Cranberry Bog are both good Parents Weekend types of restaurants. Others do exist though! For those people who like Chinese food, China Pavilion on Wolf Road is pretty good. Right near there is Pare V Cafe. I've never been there but people always have good things to say about it. Anyone who likes really good Italian food should go to , Nicole's Restaurant on Delaware Avenue in Albany. I have been there and it was excellent! For daytime activities, there is always Saratoga. There are cute restaurants, shops and parks and if it rains the outlet stores are very close by. Now, for Mothers' Day, here is my suggestion. Go to the Albany Hilton because they have a huge brunch every Sunday that is unbelievable, but make your reservations now because these places will book up fast! Most important, pray for good weather and show your parents a good time because this is our moment to help them rationalize why they are paying such an outrageous amount for us to be here.

May 2, 1991 ART!i &. EI\ITERTAII\IMENT <lrlUlfllrbirn.sis 23 Blues Masters To Legendary Perform at the Empire C~enter The Empire Center at the Egg announced today that it will be presenting living blues legends Robert Jr. Lockwood and Clarence \Gatemouth\ Brown, plus the original \blue- eyed\ blues band, The Blues Project,. on .three separate dates this spring. Delta blues guitarist Robert Jr. Lockwood, who for decades has touted himself as the only adopted son of seminal blues guitarist Robert Johnson, has played througho-ut his extensive career with almost all the great bluesmen, including a long association with hannonica virtuoso Sonny Boy Williamson. The guitarist has played with and influenced generations of blues fretmen, including B.B. King, Albert King, and Muddy Waters, while himself being influenced by the jazz phrasings of Charlie Christian, T -Bone Walker, and Count Basie. Mr. Lockwood's duo will perform at 8:00p.m. on Thursday, May 16, in the Lewis A. Swyer Theatre.. Tickets for all seats are $10~ The Texas-born multi- instrumentalist Clarence \Gatemouth\ Brown will bring his guitar. violin, mandolin, harmonica, and piano wizardry t~l the Lewis A. Swyer stage at 8:00 p.m. on Saturday, June 15. One of the original crossover artists, \Gate's\ heady co-mingling of blues, cajun, Tex-Mex, and big band swing is, as the Washington Post noted, \as rich and varied as the American music tradition itself.\ The veteran of dozens of tours world-wide, Mr. Brown's shows wit his four-pieee band are, as New York Times reviewer Pater Watrous wrote, \loaded with wit, the sort of creativity that keeps an audience in thrall, and allows a musician to keep on playing, roadhouse after concert hall after roadhouse.\ Tickets for all seats are $10. For '6()s blues enthusiasts, the annual reunion of The Blues Project is indeed cause for celebration. The New York City ba'Sed enclave .of white blues purists that included keyboardist AI Kooper and guitarists Danny Kalb and Steve Katz; set the course for the tremendous blues revival of the mid-1960s. The regrouped band, featuring Kooper, Katz, and Kalb, will play their only concert date outside of the New York area at tile Lewis A. Swyer Theatre on Wednesday, June 19, at 8:00 p.m. Tickets for all seats are $15. T() celebrate this series, the Empire Center is offering a \super \Subscription rare\ of $25 for tickets to all three events. For tickets and reservations, and fnrther subscription information on this series, please call the Empire Center Box Office at (518) 473-1845.

HOROSCOPES By LOLLI TAURUS: During the early days of this week your emotional scales are unbalanced. Fortunately, at the end of the week you'll regain your equilibrium. GEMINI: You will soon be receiving an awaited reply from a very important person. If romance beckons, don't hc~it.ate to follow. CANCER: Do the lyrics in specific songs sometimes cause a spark? Well, maybe it's about time you listen since you do not follow the advice of your friends. LEO: Lately you have been making many people happy. Your good spirits will always help those around you who may feel down. Pay attention to other's emotional changes. VIRGO: Travel is highlighted, possibly involving mmance. Take advantage of all the opportunities that come y()ur way this weekend. LIBRA: Watch what you say early in the week-you'll have to live with it later. Purchases, socializing and maybe even some mischief arc this weekends highlights. SCORPIO: Stop asking so many questions and doubting your vulnerable feelings. Open the door and let your energy go and you will accomplish great things. SAGITARIUS: Had a rough past weekend? This wec:k make up for it, and re-think your past behavior. Don't rush into a new relationship so soon. You know what always hapJ}ens. CAPRICORN: Mind games, little white lies, and jealousy will get you nowhere. Start playing fair, and have more consideration for other people's feelings. Otherwise everyone will lose in the end. AQUARIUS: Competition will help you achieve your goal this week. A few people will undermine your achievement. Have eyes in the back of your head. PISCES: You may have a lot to organize and plan b11t try to include in your schedule those who care for you. You may not be confident, but those feelings will change after a boost from a friend. ARIES: Pessimism can be a loss of hope. Your mood swings can be the result of two things: A change of diet or indecision. Don't take you ill feelings out on someone you'll hurt. Want To Express Your Opinions .... Legally?

!iPORT!i Women's Track Heats It Up :By MEG PARSONS The women's track and field team is on fire!! This Saturday at the Hartwick Invitational Meet the weather was great and the performances were stellar. The weight throwers racked up the points with Alix: Goldschmidt reigning field event goddess placing first in the javelin and shot put, 33'12 and 11.51 respectively. Lori \my woman Lowie\ Simkins threw a personal record of 21'74 in the javelin and Kerry \my hair is so finicky\ Evers threw a personal record of 8.58 in the shot put. On the track juniors Sandy \haircut\ Anselment and Rika \hurdles\ Poor ran solid races in the 1500 and the 400 meter hurdles respectively. Sandy placed second in the 1500 and Rika ran a personal rect>rd time which qualified ner for the state and ECAC meets. The sprint events were a showcase of Union tale11t. The 100 and 200 meter trials and finals featured Denise \is back\ Saunders, Tasha \.Ben\ LaBarre, Joy \my legs are fine\ Grillon, and Meg \iron girl\ Parsons. In the 100 final Saunders placed first, Parsons seco11d, and LaBarre fifth. In the 200 meters Parsons placed fifth, LaBarre sixth. Grillon and ParsQns also placed fourth and first in the 400 meter dash. The relays were the real showstopper for the Garnet Gabby Girls. The 4xl00 meter team: Parsons, Poor, Saunders and LaBarre placed second but their time of su:7 is a new school record and one dispensable second away from qualifying for the NCAA meet later in May. The 4x400 meter team with the same names, different order won by about a mile and a half, and came within two secoads of the school record set three years ago by assistant coach Jen Lee, Terri Thomas, Clare \Mrs.\ Megathlin, and Meg Parsons.

Union Invitational Hampered By Extreme Conditions Men Tracksters Perform Well at Hartwick By GREG BARRETT Those unyielding spectators last Wednesday at the Union Open knew that this meet was far from normal. It was cloudy. pouring rain, and a few scattered bolts of lightning, at least until the meet was called off. Despite the horrendous conditions, the Dutchmen that did get to race performed very well. Shawn Mowry spun off a 102'2-1/2\ toss in the discus for a new PR Matt Decker also had a great day capturing second in the 1OOm dash with an 11.4. Then nature stepped in and everything screeched to a halt. Maybe one year in the future, the Union Open will not have to succumb to weather or the measles. This Saturday, the weather was the exact opposite-- sunny and 80+, which is what is always the case at the Hartwick Invitational. The weather did not hinder the Dutchmen. They performed with their usual standard of excellence placing in many events and posting many new PRs. The sprinters really put their competition to the test and left many in the dust. The 4X100m relay scored its best finish of the year pounding out a third place finish. Matt Decker, Bac Ngyuen, Rich Zembek and Will Allen poured it on to cross in 45.7. Matt Decker later picked up another place finishing fourth in the open lOOm dash with an 11.64. Bob Lyndyberg and Will Allen had their annual duel in the 400m dash and finished fourth and fifth respectively. Linclybarg won this time with a leaning 51.10 just topping Allen's 51.14. The 800m was the next high point of the day with all of the Dutchmen dropping their PRs. Bac Ngyuen was the ftrst with a 2:02.5, knocking almost four seconds off of his previous best. Chris Ryan was next with a major PR of ..... _~ . 2:12.6. Mike Emmi was close behind in a 2:15.9. Ed \Rhino\ Rothenberg toppled his PR in the 2500m, crossing the line in 4:45.3. The Dutchmen surprised their competition in the field events capturing a second, a third and a fourth. Rich Pulver set a PR and qualified for States with a put of 45'5\ and a second place. Glen \Crash\ Meizell followed his lead sailing over 13'6\ in the pole vault for a third. Pulver then carne back and spun off a 120'6\ toss in the discus for a fourth place. This weekend, the Men's Track Team travels to TTenton State where their entire conference will compete in the Collegiate Track Conferences. This is an extremely important meet with everyone gunning at their last chance to qualify for States at Buffalo on May 10-12.

Union Seeded Third in Men's lacrosse Event Dutchmen Tr11vel to Ht111'Wick on Friday Union College received its third consecutive ECAC Upstate New York men's lacrosse tournament bid yesterday. The 9-2 Dutchmen, who are seeded third, will travel to play No. 2 seeded Hartwick (6-5) on Friday af 6 p.m. Union's game with Hartwick will be a rematch of the second game of the season when the Warriors posted a last-minute, 12-11 victory at home. \Its going to be a great game,\ said fourth-year head coach Chuck Priore. \We look forward to opportunity to play them again. It will be a chance for us to avenge one of our two losses this year.\ Hartwick is ranked 12th in the country according to the latest NCAA poll. Prior to playing the ECAC game, the Dutchmen have an important Capital.Cup contest with visiting Albany on Wednesday at 3:30 p.m. Union, which has won the Cup each of the first five years, needs a victory over the Danes in order to avoid a three-way tie with Albany and RPI. Union defeated RPI, 6-5 in overtime, while the Engineers captured a 7-6 victory over the Danes. The first tie-breaker in detennining a three-way tie is best goals allowed total. \If we weren't playing a Capital Cup game I'd be worried that my players might get caught looking ahead to the ECACs,\ said Priore. \But they've been in this situation each of the last two years. They know we need to beat Albany in order to retain the Cup. I'll let them know about the Hartwick game and then we won't start dealing with it until after Wednesday's game.\ Priore, who guided the team to a 9-5 record and an ECAC bid in 1989 and an 8-5 mark and an ECAC bid last year, has a chance for his team to take its place among some of the great lax squad's in Union's long history. In 1974, the Dutchmen set the record for wins in a season with their 11- 3 record. That team lost to Geneseo in the ECAC championship showdown. The 1966 squad was 10-1 and the team of 1929 was 7-0. In 1989, Union received its first ECAC bid since the '74 team. The Dutchmen, who were seeded fourth, lost to eventual champion Clarkson 8- 7 in the final 57 seconds. Last year fourth-seeded Union dropped a 19-1 0 decision to Nazareth in the first round. Senior attackman John Keller continues to lead Union's offense with 60 points on 35 goals and 25 assists. He is nine points away from setting a personal season high and shows 229 points for his outstanding career. Sophomore Nate Fitch is next with 29-13- 42. Senior netminder Brian Lucey and sophomore Bill Van Order have combined to post 154 saves while giving up 79 goals. Lucey has a 65% save average while Van Order is at 67%. Sophomore John Bang has won 90 of his 160 faceoff opportunities, 56.2%. SUPPORT UNION SPORTS The Women's Lacrosse Team looks to finish up their season on Tuesday against Williams. IIU~mR May 2, 19~1 Union Softball Shines 13 Wins Tops All-Time List By RON BIRNBAUM This week has been another of importance for women's softball. Sweeping an away double-header against RPI this past Saturday, the squad went on to defeat Binghamton at home before losing to St. Rose here last Saturday, and now has a 12-4 record. The two victories versus RPI were expected throughout the game. While the first game Union played well with 9 hits and 3 runs scored by the first 3 batters in the first (5-l win),· the second game was not played as well offensively with only 1 hit for the entire squad. The team held defensively and at bat got on base off errors which the Dutchwomen found difficult to capitalize on, shown by the low 2-0 score. RPI's sole run came in the seventh inning of game 1, on base on errors, after Union had taken the score to 5 in the fifth. Junior centerfielder quad- captain Roselle Eisma and junior catcher Robin Romer each scored twice and sophomore leftfielder Dawn Harrington scored once. In game 2, sophomore rightfielder Lauren Seidman score the 2 game-winning runs in the second and fourth innings. Yet, more important as a victory was Thursday's Binghamton game, which gave the team a 12-3 record, 12 tying the school softball record for wins in a season. Concerning the state tournaments coming up next week for post-seasonal play, there was a need to impress Binghamton's coach, one of the judges on the state tournament committee, with quality playing and even better with a win, which it got (9-6). In the firt, Binghamton's first batter in the top of the first walked and stole second before getting the game opening run. After quic~ rotation of the orders in the second and third, Union scored 4 runs in the fourth. After the first 3 scored again the fifth, in addition to Harrington and Eisma, Binghamton's lead off batters for the bottom of the inning rallied a comeback attempt with 3 runs beginning with an opening double, a hit, and an error. After Union came close to scoring again in the sixth, Binghamton scored 2 more runs this inning. The toughest game of the week was vs. St. Rose at home, eventually a 4-7 Dutchwomen loss. With a 21-1 record, St. Rose, though an area team, is going division 2 next year, and gives sports scholarships. While a win would have been great versus this team as a confidence- builder, a loss was not as important. This team was only slightly better than Union by a couple of hits and Union having a couple more forced errors. In certain crucial situations with the bases loaded for St. Rose, their lead runner could not be taken out. A similar situation arose in the top of the fifth with St. Rose leading 4-3. With Lawliss on second after a bunt, Romer hit a shot up the middle which was stopped but not caught by the pitcher, dropping to her feet. This was picked up to throw out Romer for the third out. Freshman outfielder Chris Weske scored again for Union in the sixth after a walk to tie things up, but St. Rose pulled ahead in the sixth with 2 runs and one in the seventh for the final 7-4 defeat. Despite the loss this was a well-played game. Statistics wise, the team is still scoring most of its runs in early innings and outscoring opponents by more than a 2: 1 ratio. Yet, this scoring is choppy, brought in with walks, SACs and steals instead of hits seen as necessary. With Dudzic's still low 1.5 ERA and the teams' batting average at 269, the pitcher serves as the team glue, wins or losses a team effort. This past Monday, the Dutchwomen beat Albany 5-1 to set a new school record with 13 wins. In addition it was the first time that Union swept Albany in a season series. The 2 final seasonal games are versus North Adams, and Russell Sage, the last a double- header at home this Saturday, May 4th at il:OO am and 1:00 pm. Russell Sage, with a similar 13-2 record to Union is seen as the Dutchwomen's largest threat to a seat in the playoffs. In terms of teams in the near area, Sage has lost to both St. Rose and Skidmore while Union has lost only to St. Rose. If the squad is elected for playoffs, it leaves one week from today for the tournament beginning on Friday.

Bork returned to teach law from 1977 to 1981 at Yale. After a year of work in a Washington law firm, Bork was nominated to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. The United States Senate confinned Bork by a unanimous vote in 1982 to the bench. In the early summer of 1987, Justice Lewis Powell announced his resignation, and President Reagan nominated Bork to fill the vacancy on the U.S. Supreme Court. After an . intense political battle that raged throughout that summer and dramatic confirmation hearings before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Bork's nomination was rejected by the full Senate.

President Hull Responds To Faculty Resolution By JORDAN LIPPNER and STEPHANIE FRAY EditorGin-C hiej After almost a week of deliberation over a faculty resolution that he re-evaluate faculty review procedures, President of Union College, Roger H. Hull recanted his original position offering visiting Professor of English, William Hathaway, \A one- year terminal contract with the clear understanding that his teaching duties during the 1991-92 academic year be approved in advance by the Dean of the Faculty.\ Although Hull's decision expressed in a May 6 memorandum to the faculty, deemed \a classic liberal attempt to achieve some sort of compromise,\ by Professor of English, Frank Gado. Initially appearing to be a capitulation to the demands of both the majority of the student body and the faculty, the memo ultimately failed in mitigating the ensuing unrest regarding the issue. Hull, who had previously approved the decision made by Dean of the Faculty, Jim Underwood, not to rehire A classic liberal attempt to achieve some sort of compromise. Hathaway, modified his stance in \hope that the one-year contract will bring this matter to a close.\ Hull also cited the administration's mistake of not entering the search process earlier, and the fact that Professor Hathaway was informed .of his dismissal \at an unusually late date\ as additional reasons for tendering Kit this new offer. However, this last statement of Hull's seems to contradict an earlier statement in which the President had said that he \believed that the decision of Dean Underwood was both substantively and procedurally correct.\ problem with some pretty uninspiring administrators\ as he was never \offered a private meeting with Presi<ient Hull or Dean Underwood.\ Moreover, Hathaway is sure that \they were counting ()fl him not accepting\ the offer. Although Underw()od assert- ed that the decision \'seemed to be the right thing.\ Tile general consensus among faculty was that of disappointment in terms of both its poignant content and innate predictability. Chairman of the History Department Stephen Berk deemed Hull's memorandum a \most unfortunate offer\ in that it \never considered the quality of mind\ of Professor Hathaway and ultimately did not \pay attention to\ the faculty resolution. He was The College has a problem with some pretty uninspiring administrators. concerned with the \tone of arrogance which pervaded Hull's letter and what this augers for future issues.\ Matthew Futterman, a senior English major graduating with honors, called the offer \a political decision that tries to sweep the issne under the carpet.\ He added tllat \it was wrong because it .ignored what the faculty said\ and that it \did not grant what the students asked for.\ \The big problem with the decision is that it was made unilaterally in all attempt to appease both the students and j the faculty,\ said former Editor· Continued on page 4 Acceptance Rate Protnising For Class Of 1995 By LISA HOFBAUER Things look promising in the Union College admissions office for the 1991-92 academic year. The number of both applications and admitted students has increased, and in spite of the rising cost of tuition, 498 deposits have already been paid. The college experienced a four percent increase in applications this year, and accepted roughly 63 percent of the applicants. This acceptance rate seems high, but many private colleges across the nation are also having to accept more students in order to insure financial security. For example, the University of Pennsylvania admitted 48 percent of their applicants for the 1991-92 school year. Ann Fleming Brown, Associate Dean of Admissions, cited three reasons for the increased acceptance rate: (1.) rising costs of higher education, (2), fewer students in this year's high school graduating class, and (3.) the complications and inadequacies of financial aid for private colleges. Union received 2992 applications for the coming year and admitted 1828. The admissions department hopes for the class of 1995 to be composed of 540 students. There is no statistical analysis as of yet about whether the increase in numbers will cause Union to drop in academic 1 rank. . · ...

This popular movement that called for the press's increased role in evaluating our highest public officials was originally galvanized by the work of Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein. Their illuminating investigation into the infamous Watergate scandal was landmark in that it ushered in an era that demanded gTeater mass participation in this democratic system. Even more importantly, though, their findings spelled the end ~o a president's political existence, as Nixon's resignation and hollow plea that lle in fact was not a crook were all that remained in a shattered civic career. This entire episode displayed the potency of a societal entity that for many years was suppressed and heavi'ly influenced by the brutal tactics that epitomize the American game of politics. To witness the toppling of a Chief Executive must have truly been a sight to behold, for more often than not, the President is treated with such esteem that he is almost considered above any legitimate challenge to power. While this monumental event was instrumental in propelling the American press to a position of glory and respect, the past twenty years since Watergate have brought an esc alation of hounding, cynicism, and underhanded Fitzhugh Ludlow •. . . .

Most recently, the delicate heart condition that has troubled George Bush over the last few days is a colossal story that understandably forged into the nation's limelight. In fact, as of Sunday, the President bas suffered through his second consecutive day of an irregular heartbeat. Rather than focusing on the disturbing condition of a man who has achieved a modern record for popularity following the country's triumphant war victory, the press has instead looked to rekindle the debate surrounding the prowess and (in)eptitude of Vice-President Dan Quayle. Ever since Bush made the controversial selection of this Indiana Sen a tor as the Republican ticket's number two man in 1988, reporters have regaled in harassing and digging up dirt on this most unfortunate scapegoat. The All of this new found journalistic vigor has arrived at the exact conclusions that the original queries did: that Quayle is not prepared or ready to assume the responsibilities of Chief Executive should the need arise. Time Magazine released a poll saying that only 19% of people asked replied that they felt confident in the Vice-President's ability to lead this country, while some 67% did not. CNN conducted interviews with Republican analysts who said that Quayle was one of the only black marks on an otherwise clean ticket. Reports are being released that tell of renewed Democrat spirits in terms of the 1992 Presidential election, for the challengers now have an issue with which to stage a furious popular comeback. The bottom line here, though, is that Quayle has taken a great brunt of press scrutiny over the past four years; enough, in fact, to cover Even the ;greatest of political speakers and diplomats will trip over their tongues when a earner~. spotlight, and twenty microphones follows. them around every minute of the day. The sad truth is that the scrutiny and magnification of Quayle's mistakes is an unwarranted attack on a man who is asked to perform the tasks of Vice-President, not of perfection. There is no refuting the fact that press coverage and reporting has made great strides over the past decades. The rough treatment Qf Dan Quayle, though, gives the impression that this drive has been one in futility, not improvement. Perhaps it is time to reevaluate the ethics and purpose of the press. For then maybe figures can be gauged on their merit, and not simply how many newspapers are sold with the accounts of mistakes they unavoidably will make in the line of duty.

May 9; 1991 I\IEW!i AI\IAL Y!il!i C!rlllttllrbtrnsi.s 3 Against \Borking'' ll.Y DANIEL J. KENIRY \Robert Bor:k's America,\ Senator Edward Kennedy began in his Senate speech on July 1, 1987, \is a land in which blacks would sit at segregated lunch counters, rogne police could break down citizens' doors in midnight raids, school children could not be taught about evolution, writers and artists would be ce11sored at whim ... \ These remarks were delivered not forty-five minutes after President Reagan announced his intention to nominate Robert H. Rork, then a United States Court of Appeals Juclge in Washington, to the Supreme Court. \Kennedy set the tllemes and tones for the entire campaign,\ Bork's book, The Tempting of America: The Political Seduction of the Law, plac~s the controversy over his nomination in perspective and ably presents the case for original intent in constitutional theory. He explains precisely why the tragedy of the affair was that \to Bork\ (see below) became a verb and should be entered in Safire's political dictionary, and why this state of affairs is a serious crisis for constitutional government. Bork will carry his message to Union at Parents' Weekend, where he will expand on his concern for politics and the law. Bork's \tempting\ refers to the politicization of America's legal culture. Bork laments the fact that our society is lured to the judicial branch .to strike a political success that cannot be achieved through legislation. This, for Bork, is a perversion of the original intent of the founders. The intention was, through the separation of powers, to insure that the will of the .people would be supreme in the legislative branch and the \peculiar ,province\ of :the American courts would be to interpret the law and not make it. The Constitution is law, and is the supreme law of the land. To arrive at a particular constitutional decision, the judge must remain faithful to the text of the document, and through the records of the constitutional debates, the intentions of the founders. Bork asserts that judges have tended toward a decision- making theory that decides on the basis of a judge's private morality, a particular political agenda, or public opinion. The opponents of Bork's nomination, in the Senate and in the interest groups, certainly gave in to the \temptation.\ After Kennedy gave his speech on that summer day in 1987, a political campaign of enon:p.ous magnitude began. Judiciary Committee Chairman Joseph Biden first delayed the hearings on Judge Bork's nomination until September 15, with the express purpose of allowing lobbying groups and activists time to organize. Kennedy contacted civil rights and iabor leaders and urged that they oppose Bork. The National Abortion Rights Action League chose \target\ senators. People for the American Way ran TV and radio ads and sent mailings to editorial writers around the c<Juntry, and the AFL-CIO pl\\dged aR undisclosed amount to oppose Bork. Planned Parenthood noted Bork's adherence to \obscure academic th~ory\ in a full page ad in national newspapers (Bork p()ints out this is the same \obscure\ theory propounded by Madison and Jefferson). Thoere is nothing repugnant in ~he~e activities for any j)()IJUcal campaign. The poi11t is that such a campaign had never been conducted in public for a judicial nominee. 'The founders believed Supreme Calllt justices should not be p~tisan and certainly not be resvonsive to public opinion in the way that any successful leg,islator must. Senator Gordon Humphrey of New Hampshire called the cllarges against Bork at the hearings \political poppy-cock, p11re political poppy-cock, 9~.9% pure, so pure it floats.\ The full Senate unanimously C()n:firmed Bork in 1973 to be Solicitor General, and once ag;ain when he was nominated to the Washington Court of A))peals in 1982. In these co11firmation proceedings, Bork's writings as a faculty member at Yale Law School were not considered in the reocord. These theoretical tracts were quoted widely by the opposition Senators and gr()ups, despite their lack of r~levance to Bark's perfonnance <Jn the bench. In 1986, the Senate confirmed Antonin Scalia by a unanimous vote to be an Associate Justice on the Supreme Court. One study, noted at Bork's hearings and in hi~ book, indicated Bork and Scalia, who served together on the Court of Appeals, voted together 98% of the time. A final atrocity was the comment Biden made to the Philadelphia Inquirer in November 1986: \Say the Administration sends up Bork and after our investigation he looks a lot like another Scalia, I'd have to vote for him and if the groups tear me apart, that's the medicine I'll have to take, I'm not Teddy Kennedy.\ Unfortunately for constitutional government, Biden became a Kennedy prototype after he was visited by prominent liberal interest groups within a week of the nomination. Bork's conception of how a judge ought to behave is vital for the surviva1 of a representative system that wishes to maintain functional checks and balances and the separation of powers. Bork's conception of original understanding does allow for some construction. It is certain that Madison. Jay, and Hamilton could not conceive of fax machines or air travel but one should not then conclude that a reasonable interpretation of where such modern innovations fit in the Bork states, quite candidly, that he believes conservatives would have made the same revisionist decisions on the Court and would have mounted a similar political campaign if the historical circumstances somehow reversed. Constitution is not possible. The constitutional jurist can interpret the intentions of the founders (or a legislature) according to the text and the debates. However, this reasoning process must take place removed from the results, good or bad for society, of the particular decision. Only an unbiased and rational approach such as this will lead the nation as close to justice as we can attain. Bork states, quite candidly, that he believes conservatives would have made the same revisionist decisions on the Court and would have mounted a similar political campaign if the historical circumstances were somehow reversed. This is an important point as it demonstrates that proper legal reasoning and the application of the law is the judge's role; he is not to decide· and legislate the best result. The alternative is a judicial branch in which judges were free to decide cases on the basis of personal political morality or what they think the desirable social outcome should be. be deprived of life, liberty, and property, without due process of law. Bork notes, \the clause ·(due process) says nothing about what the substance of the law must be ... How did Taney know that slave ownership was a constitutional right? Such a right is nowhere to be found in the Constitution. He knew it because he was passionately convinced that it must be a constitutional right.\ This was the introduction of substantive due process, and this would serve as a precedent for later activist judges. Roe employed similar tactics to find a constitutional right of privacy that could be stretched to include a woman's right to have an abortion, contrary to 46 state laws restricting the practice. Justice Harry Blackmun's decision in Roe recounted the history of abortion, criticized \Victorian social concerns,\ and suddenly without explanation, stated that \this right of privacy .. .is broad enough to encompass a woman's decision whether or not to terminate her pregnancy.\ The Court cited cases to prove the Constitution protects certain zones of privacy; some dealt with religious freedom, others were further creations of unfounded rights, and one struck down a law baning racially mixed marriages. These cases are all very interesting but certainly have little bearing on the issue of how the Constitution could allow the notion of a zone of privacy to be so inclusive as to allow abortion-on-demand. A similar case was Lochner v. New York (1905), which utilized substantive due process to overturn a state law that limited work hours for bakery employees. Bork states that \once it is conceded that a judge may give the due process clause substantive content, Dred Scott, Lochner, and Roe are equally valid examples of constitutional law ... Who says Roe must say Lochner and Scott. This is vehemently denied by today's proponents of judicial policymaking, but the denial is hollow and merely means that they like the policies being made.\ If the things that Bork's opponents charged about him were true, people would indeed have reason to be afraid. The simple fact is that Bork, armed with his ideas about justice being reasoned and blind stood in opposition to popular political thinking today. (Some conservatives thought Bork was too liberal - they also missed the point that he was an independently minded jurist.) Bork would not use the bench to legislate for either party or ideological persuasion. He represented an institution that Bork's two best examples of the judiciary at the service of politics (the majority of his book is devoted to these examples) are Dred Scott v. Sanford (1857) and Roe v. Wade (1973). In Dred Scott, cannot be controlled by ideologues whose agenda are defeated at the polls. Bork makes a sharp cry to all of us political creatures that the most effective way to ensure democratic freedoms is for the judiciary to remain outside the arena of ideological squabbles Chief Justice Roger Taney of Maryland promoted his views on slavery and expressed his resentment at the northern opposition to southern culture. Taney found a right to own slaves in the fifth amendment's guarantee that no person shall and partisan concerns. to Bork-(verb) to be systematically and without due regard for factual evidence misrepresent, contort, or lie about the credentials, historical record, or previous remark

4 @mrrnrhitttsfs May 9, 1991 Bork To Speak Saturday Kappa Alpha Initiates Three Women Student Forum Spotlight Continued from page ·1 Bork described his judicial theory in a 1987 speech as follows: \What does it mean to say that the Constitution is , law'? It means that the words of the document, and their historical meaning, constrain judgment. The words must control judges every bit as much as they control legislators, executives, and citi.zcns ... The philosophy of original intent takes the values the founders specified in the various provisions of the Constitution and applies them to the different circumstances of today's world. That is not easy or mechanical, but it is also not impossible.\ Bork's talk at Union will be entitled \George Bush, Politics, and the Constitution.\ By MATT TUCKER and JEFF GREEN Assoc. News Editors Kappa Alpha, this past weekend, made an extremely surprising change that could alter the direction of fraternities in the future. The society, which was founded in 1825, helped to pave the way for the American fraternity system. K.A., along with other fraternities that were founded at this school, is credited with making Union College known as \The Mother of Fraternities.\ Now, though, \The Mother of Fraternities\ has changed its ways because in the last few days, it became evident that Kappa Alpha tore down the coeducational walls and initiated three women into its society. Through a telephone interview with Kappa Alpha's president, Adam Gahtan, Kappa Hull Responds To Hathaway Issue Continued from page 1 in-Chief of Concordiensis, Andrew Seewald. ,Moreover, \Tiley intended to turn the tables on Hathaway by making him accept the offer thus, signing his own resignation. The big issue was about administrative autocracy. We students will not accept this.\ Thus, the effects of what Professor of Political Science Joseph Board characterized as a \tragedy for Union College\ continue to plague the college community. As Professor of Theater, Barry Smith stated, \This is no way to start a relationship between the administration and faculty.\ The Poison Of Power An Open Letter to Union Colleagues By PETER HEINEGG \I do not know what effect my accusers have had upon you, gentlemen, but for my own part I was almost carried away by them; their arguments were so convincing. On the other hand, scarcely a word of what they said was true: --Plato, The Apology With Roger Hull's memo (which arrived in faculty mailboxes yesterday even as Deans Weiner and Underwood were delivering its dismal terms to Kit Hathaway and myself viva voce) the administration evidently hopes at long last to bury an explosive and embarrassing issue. But though they have the power to end Kit's career at Union, they can't cover up the truth. The English Department conducted a scrupulously fair national search. I read all the student evaluations twice and found them basically JX!Sitive; I told this to my Department. I have observed him teach and thought him wonderful. He gave a brilliant presentation (usually the key to any job search) and won the Department's overwhelming endorsement. It was \Hathaway first and the rest nowhere.\ The sequel to this story is common knowledge: the Deans intervened and fired Kit, and the President rubberstamped their unilateral decision. When protests broke out on campus, and a majority of faculty and students promptly sided with the English Department, the administration resorted to inuendo and smears. And now that the vote has gone against him, the President offers Kit a •one-year, terminal conlract\--a pointless reprieve that adds insult to injury by asking him to countersign his own writ of execution. First Kit is told he's not worthy to teach at Union, then he's given an extra year-so that Union students can waste their time and money on a teacher already damned as \not challenging. • This strange maneuver is presented as an act of mercy. The axe, it seems, was \unusually late\ in falling because (1) \the administration sllould have entered the search process earlier\ (i;e., they should have fired Hathaway sooner), and (2) \the English Department chair failed to malyze existing data as other department chairs have done\ (i.e., Heinegg should have talked himself and his eight colleagues into stlaring the administration's bias). The whole argument refutes itself. The President takes \strong-very strong issue with the manner in which Professors Heinegg and Hathaway have acted. • Speaking for myself, I can't imagine how he expected me to respond to such a stunning example of bad judgment and autocratic procedure. Does my sin lie in talking to the press when the administration refused to listen? In sending the trustees a copy of the President's letter to me confirming that Kit was fired? In praising the students who rallied for it? Should Kit's supporters have bowed their heads and mourned in silence? The President says he hopes •the one-year contract will bring this matter to a close.\ Well, It has quite properly turned down the contract, but \the matter\ won't just go away. Henry Adams once sadly observed ttlat power is poison; and when power gets used in a poisonous way, its toxic effects are bound to be felt long afterwards. Alpha answered some questions but also honored their :r:eputation for secrecy. Apparently a total of three women were initiated. Of the thnee, two women are juniors and one is a senior. When asked about the decision to initiate women, Gahtan simply stated that the reason is a \private matter.\ Nevertheless, the transition raises more questions. At at time such as this where President Hull seems to be pushing for co-ed housing, what will the repercussions be on the rest of the Greek houses located on campus? Will the actions of Kappa Alpha affect the Union College community as a whole or will the consequences be as secret and silent as the Society itself? The answers to these questions are unknown at the present but time will clue us in on the future of Union College and the Greek system. The highlight of the past two weeks wOFk on the Forum was the completion of the budgeting process for next year's dubs and student activities. After days of hard work by the Forum finance committee, tile budget pro- posals were made ,last Monday, · and all were vassed by the end · of the night. Clubs interested in finding Ollt their budget · allocations for next year may · do so by .stopping at the · Student Activities Office on the fourth floor of the College • Center. In addition, the Dance Ensemble was approved to ; receive $200. Waterpolo was granted $1963. Arts Club was granted $300. and the Rugby Club was given $625. All of these allocations are effective immediately. John Meier~ Senior Trustee, reported the dates for Student Forum elections and the procedure they will follow. Petitions are now available in the Student Activ,ities Office, and are due on Monday. Elections will be held on Friday, May i 7, and all students rue urged to vote. Other topics that were brought up included hold,ing another retreat for Forum officers next year. Concern was raised over the rumor that $60,000 from the academic budget for next year was going towards the hockey program's move to Division I status. Although only a rumor, Forum members agreed that it was deserving of further investigation. The next Forum meeting will be this Monday at 6:00 p.m. Anyone interested in attending is welcome, and any students interested in running for Student Forum positions should pick up their petitions now.

But he will return next week with yet another enlightening piece .... Tuesday, May 14 HU 010 (Language lab) 7:30 p.m. Woyzeck (1978, 82 min., in German) directed by Werner Herzog, with Eva Mattes and Klaus Kinski. Woyzeck represents one of the most extraordinary events in the history of literature. Written in 1836, just before its author's death at the age of 23, Buchner's drama anticipates by some 50 to 100 years the literary movements of the 20th century. Herzog's version of Woyzeck is a film without shadows. This caustic tragedy of an ordinary man's headlong plunge into madness and murder is filmed with a terrible clarity, punctuated by bursts of unexpected and devasting lyricism. In the title role, Klaus Kinski delivers a harrowing and unforgettable performance, as stark and unsentimental as the razor with which the hero carries out his chilling destiny.

Usually this consists of calling friends, . wandering the halls, taking a stroll to check the empty mailbox again (and maybe to waste time at the college center), and anything else that seems like a better thing to do then start that darn paper or study for tomorrow's exam. When you start to pour coffee down your throat and your eyes just can't seem to stay open any longer, you often say to yourself, why the hell was I not doing this work earlier instead of putting it off until now. But if you are fortunate enough to know Andrey, you know that your procrastination time with him was well spent. Whenever I need a reason to not start studying just yet, he is there to entertain me. You can say that you shared in a cultural exchange instead of just wasting time fooling around. When people get together with Andrey, they never know what will transpire ... ; One time a bunch of people from the floor had gathered in the lounge to make small talk and to convince everyane else that they in fact had the most work to do that evening. The conversation topics moved quickly from elves to Alf. Andrey who had been relatively quiet during this rap session titled his head quizzically and blurted out, \Now I am confused between elves, Alf, and Dean Alford.\ Y 011 never know what he's going to say next, but chances are it will be funny, like the Russian joke about the 'fireman who got away'. Nobody ever understands his jokes, and that's what makes them so hilarious. Of course it is amusing to hear the KGB stories about how Andrey is transmitting secrets to the Russian government from the top of the Nott Memorial. He speaks so frequently about the KGB activities, some of us are beginning to wonder ... But there is a serious side to Andrey that is to be appreciated as much as his humorous side. Many times he will stop into my room to talk before he goes to work or begins his own studies.

From him you hear it like it really is over there, and net just the propaganda that you read from the newspaper. I love to ask Andtey questions. Sometimes they are silly, but I want to know how life differs in the Soviet Union. He enjoys talking about his homeland, and I benefit by learning new customs and traditions, although Andrey has become much mo:re adapted to the American ways of life. His favorite pa.sttime is \scamming\ the Tri Delts who lay outside his window sunbathing. I wonder if they realize that they are bringing so much pleasure ami satisfaction to his dreams of American women. One night we played a Russian game called \lifting someone through the ceiling.\ It involves someone being blindfolded and standing on a chair, and then three people assist in doing the lifting. Mter that, we put the chair up against the wall and asked Andrey to bend over with his head on the wall and pick it up. All the girls demonstrated that they could do it, and he was clueless as to why he could not do the trick. Later we explained that it had to do with the male center of gravity and not with any personal defects. Another time my roommate decided to teach Andrey how to waltz. This activity looked interesting, so I grabbed Andrey's roommate to dance with me. A lot of people would think this was dumb, but it was fun, and how many times in your life are you going to get the chance to 'Yaltz with a Russian man? I can remember Andrey wanting to teach my roommate the Russian lambada. There never is a dull moment when Andrey is involved. I recall another night when Andrey answered our plea for a reason to procrastinate. We were listening to 'Unchained Melody' and really wanting to dance with someone ... who better to fulfill this than our little Russian brother. He thought we were out of our minds, but he danced with us. I think he enjoyed himself too, although he would much rather have been slam-dancing with us to his favorite song, \Shout at the Devil\ by Motley Crue or the Scorpions' song \Still Loving You.\ Even though these events and ideas seem so strange, that is what makes c1>llege life so special. lf all anyone ever did in c1>1lege was to study to get that piece of paper at graduation, it would be a boring four years. College is not just about g.etting an academic education-it is learning about li:fe that is important. Thus procrastinating is not always a bad thing, if one can gain knowledge through the experience that can sometimes be better than any formal education. It is not a degree tbat makes or breaks our lives after college, ·bufwhat we have learned how to do with them. We cannot possibly remember all the facts and formulas that we learn in classes, but we will remember times with our friends. It is the experiences we sl1are that will make the lasting memories on which we can build a happy and prosperous future.

FEATURE§ <!ranrnrbfrust.s ' Washington Whispers By JON KELLER Things have gotten pretty str.ange around here, ya know what I mean? Weirdness has been refined to a bizarre sort of art form. But it's sad, you see, because it's not the sort of weirdness that one might normally consider to be hip, not the kind of whacked-out nonsense that we as young people find extraordinarily appealing. It is not this sort of laudable, non-sensical behavior, such as that exhibited by the inflatable mannequins, as they take turns diving off the diving boards of some of Macy's finest above-ground pools after hours. No, my friends, I'm afraid it's not that interesting. You may at this point be so inclined as to ask me what the hell I'm talking about. Beats the hell out of me. \Oh yeah, I forgot to tell you,\ said the disparaging theologian, \there is some sort of argument being posited here. I just know it.\ Sorry, Rabbi, I said to her, \but could I interest you in a cup of coffee?\ \I don't think so,\ she said, much to my disappointment. I mean, how many transvestite preachers am I gonna meet in this lifetime? I once had the pleasure of making Jerry Falwell's acqllaintance. He had a sex change,. you know. But then he went back, realizing that people W()uld give him odd looks when he used to go out and booze it up with Ed Meese and drUg czar William Bennett. In point of fact. there is only one reason wlly these guys are so twisted. These guys are so twisted because they are politicians. They are a ridiculous breed of rich blowfish, fore-ver spouting out nonsense and getting lit at some of the seedier establishments of ot.J..r nation's capitol. OK, so I guess I'm going to talk dirty politics, since that's wh~t sells. There's a little known story that's been tossed. ~bout among Washington's inner circle. You know, the all-powerful, elite group that nobody ever heard of. That's why I'm in it. Anyway, here's how it goes: One evening, during one of Reagan's cabinet meetings, the usual thing ha:ppened. Ronnie started dozing off, while signing something; or other, perhaps a declaration of war against the Swiss. Who knows, that's not the point. The point is, that while the Gipper's head slid down his forearm and onto the table, Meese and Co. made their move. Ever so slowly, they got up out of their seats, gathering up their crossword puzzles and Rubix cubes, and tiptoed to the door. Then they bolted, down the hall, around the bend, and through the labyrinth of corridors inside the White House. Tripping over secret service and security officers on their way out, they strolled out the back door and into the night air .of our nation's capital. Tonight's crew consisted of the usual hard-drinking contingency. Ed Meese was of course there,. along with Bill Bennett, David Stockman and Elizabeth Dole, who was wearing a very revealing dress. It was satin, with silver streaks running down the sides. She wore high heeled shoes, black. The first bar they hit was Ed's long-standing favorite, The Chealsea. What a place. If the striptease isn't entertaining in and of itself, if the psychodelic music pumping out of the wall-length speakers doesn't freak you out, then one can always find sanctuary in the back room, where the real weirdos hang around.

What goes on in here is almost too ridiculous to describe, without the use of special tools, such as underwater ph·otographic equipment, etc. You know, it's really too bad that I couldn't legally describe what exactly goes on in this place. But if I could, I would probably mention the fact that Reagan's core of astrologers partook heavily of the festivities. They were everywhere, climbing the walls, dancing upside-down on tables, and kicking over pinball machines. To their credit, however, it is a known fact that these star gazers never missed a cabinet meeting. Nope, not a single one. In fact, it was because of their testimony that Colonel North was eventually acquitted. To quote directly from. the transcript of the trial, the following statement was made by the administration's Secretary of the B.A.I. (Bureau of Astrological Investigations), who commanded a yearly salary on the order of $100,000, with incentive bonuses accrued to the number of times Reagan scored bingo on Tuesday nights at the church of the rnoonies: \After a thorough investigation of all astrological signs, relative to the position of Orion, in careful consideration of the fact that Colonel North's sign is Pisces, we have determined beyond any reasonable doubt that the Colonel is in fact innocent of all charges.\ Unfortunately, however, the testimony proved to be of little use. When Reagan was put on the stand, he couldn't recall the fact that he was indeed a Capricorn, asking not once but twice about whether a Capricorn was anything like a unicorn. It'd be neat, he said, for a man to be both President of the United States and a mythical beast at the same time. He mentioned also the fact that if a unicorn were to be elected to the presidency, it would prove to the world once and for all that the United States is not in fact a discriminatory society. \We will not be a society,\ he proclaimed, \which fails to consider the rights of the figments of our imaginations.

I s <nvnrorbirttsis By DASS SEAMAN Have you ever been downtown Schenectady? I've been down there for this and that, and I've always wondered about the people. Who are they? Where are they going? Where have they b~en? What brand of toothpaste do they use? (Excuse me for the tangent I'm about to write, but you must have some background.) For my art project, I have to make a collection. It could be of anything, but it has to be rare. For instance, I could only collect grass on Sundays between 5-6 pm when an elephant does the polka on my shoulder. That would be one FEATURES M.r. Disney Of Schenectady rare blade! I decided to make a collection of signatures of rand.ern people. Condition namber one: the person has to strike me in a certain way <preferably not across the right cheek), and condition number two: I have to have an interesting story to write about him or her. Since my new direction in life, I never leave home without my bic and paper. Sounds boring, right? Not so tonto! (This is where the Schenectady part comes in.) Last week :I walked down to the bank and lo! there was a worn overcoat, jeans, and sneakers. He was also wearing Mickey Mouse sunglasses and the Mouscketteer ears, and humming \It's a small world after all,\ while feeding the &irds. Seize the day, Dass! I said to myself. I whipped out my bic and paper and approached this guy. \Excuse me,\ I said. He looked up at me with the most frightened expression, screamed feebly, aad began to shuffle away. I couldn't be left there with bic in hand, so I decided to pursue my fleeing 60-year- old Mickey Mouse fan. I chased him all the way down Jay Street. I never saw an old man shuffle so fast. When I finally caught up with him, I wheezed, \Sir? What's wrong?\ \Marge?\ \No. Dass.\ Taking off his glasses, he said, \Oh I thought you were sPR.,.iNC:; TE~IV\ P~O<:tR..N-\ S.c:.. 4G ou 1-E.... my ex-wife. I'm really sorry.\ \It's OK,\ I said. \1 was wondering if I could have your signature for my art collection.\ \Sure he said. Hank Gruld was his name. \So you're a Disney fan, Hank?\ I was curious. \Yep he nodded, smiling. I a.sked him to tell me about his lut. \It's a long story, got a couple days?\ It turns out that Hank visited Disney World when be was a ·Child. Ever since then, he tb:eamed of working there.. \I wan ted to marry Annette Funicello,\ he admitted. He also loved horticulture. When lte was nineteen, he went to Walton, Georgia to Disney's School of Shrubbery. There he learned how to sculp Disney dmracter shaped bushes. He was a master with clippers and May 9, 1991 could snip a Goofy in less than tWo hours. (He knew whether Goofy was a dog or not, but refused to reveal his secret. Dam!) He was top ofhis class. When he graduated, he was recruited to Disney W odd as Head of the Hedgecutters. He worked at Disney for many years. Did you ever see a fifty foot Donald Duck doing the backwards crawl made out of rhododendrons?\ Missed that, Hank! Now he's retired and living with his aunt's cousins' dog's previous neighbor, in Schenectady. We exchanged addresses. Yesterday I recei vcd a small Chip and Dale (the chipmunks, not men) shrub.

Any questions - Contac1 Steve or Jay x4153' By CARL FRIEDRICH~ Jr. A sort-of famous ex-editor of C oncordiensis once said in my presence, \Carl your articles have nothing to add to our newspaper.\ I was a little swprised, not because of what be thought about me, but that be thought this was a newspaper. I never have really given a boot what others thought about what I did or said or wrote, because I thought I was expressing myself in a way which others could relate to (most of the time). You see, I bave learned in my four years l!ere that there exists a certain ~rnount of people who enjoy being entertained as much as being informed. Noticing recent news articles, I must even question the legitimacy of the latter of those two iotas. I feel that there is something missing in the news periodicals cf today. There used to be a time, way before any current student came to union, when tltere was a place for entertainment in the paper or pen~cal.Nowk~msth&rr yoll're not seriolls, no one takes you seriously. That's too bad. The only place off the top cf my noodle that allows fun to exist in \serious\ print (for arguments sake we'll assume Ce>ncordy is a serious paper) is ·Barron's Weekly (Egad! Hew Unintellectual!), who run anaside column on Wall Street called \Up and Down Wall Street.\ That would surprise a lot of people, I'm sure, because fi11ance is supposed to be Reduce, Reuse, Separate And Reeycl~- serious stuff. But at least in the world of finance, they still can have fun. Fun in the politically correct (sometimes) college newspaper is an \abominable thing,\ and must be hidden on some page filled with ads. But, as not to detract from my title, why is this so? Is there no place for fun in writing anymore? I think part of the problem people have with writing is a fear of humor. Again, they think if they try to be just a little funny, or God-forbid entertaining, no one will take them seriously. And maybe they're right, but as for myself, I say go for it. In Concordiensis and elsewhere, I've paid a large price for being serious, and I hope I've sworn seriousness for life. Serious people aren't funny, and serious people are detrimental to human relations. They also tend to carry the weight of the President on their shoulders, which is always great for parties. So say bah humbug to me once again. And as staff writers for Concordy, rem em her never to have fun in your writing-they'll bury you as they tried to me. Stick to the gossip section-oh, I mean news section. You're sure to move ahead by hearing half of the story, and embellishing on what you think is the other half. Oh, and thanks to those of you who have stuck by me-I've only got a few articles left. and they are all dedicated to you.

FEATURE!i @.omrbirttsfs 9 By in fact a God-fearing. tax- CARL R. FRIEDRICH, Jr. paying, good-natured fellow, Ever wonder how much our world is reliant on trust? Without it, .society couldn't run, but when asking the average Joe or Jane if they're generally trustful, they'd look at you a little suspiciously. Trust is a basic component of human nature, yet when being confronted by others, we almost always automatically assume that we wouldn~t trust said person \as far as we could throw them.\ Let's take an example, I happen to spend a great deal of time on Amtrak's Hudson River Line, to quench my recurring appetite for New York City grime. But each time I hear tile voice on the above head speaker say \All Aboard\ (if it's working), I for a moment think of a news flash from my youth-of derailed trains and coked-up conductors. Settling into my river-side seat, however, I gradually begin to believe that the person with the throttle is who does not want to conduct hari ..:karl somewhere between Albany and Poughkeepsie. And take me with him. But then again, if I were to meet this hopefully stable individual in Charlie O's around the comer from Grand Central Station, there's little doubt in my mind that anything he might say to me would·fall on deaf ears (i.e. \sure ,par'). Trust, trust, trust. I think people are naturally deceitful, and that's why their 'trust' is lacking. But no one seems to really care, either. As long as it's not them who gets screwed. If a clerk gave you too much change for your Slush Puppie, would you give it back, or get out of the store as fast as possible? Most might say \it's their own fault,\ and vamoose. But if those same people got shortchanged, they'd be the first ones to raise a brow. and finger that well meaning cashier as a rip off artist. \You owe me twenty-three cents! Can't trust anybody these days, can Trust you?!\ Ah, but somewhere in the last paragraph are those trigger words of trust-· getting screwed. Getting screwed over is the lesson you hopefully learn once. \I can't believe it, I trusted him,\ you moan to Bartholomew the barkeep. \Hey he responds, \You broke the golden rule: never trust anybody ... :By the way, you owe me twenty bucks.\ But how tempting it is to trust again, even with th·e foreknowledge that some potential breach-of-trust may reoccur. Your stock broker buddy calls you up and tell you the hot tip, and all you can think of are his falling quails of tile past. you know you shouldn't, but ... oh the temptation! And after you've committed, and the \trust me on this stock\ fails yet again, you'll cut your losses so fast it'll look like you came out twenty percent ahead, instead of forty behind.

It was just some lousy change from an overpriced Coke.\ \Yeah I know,\ was my response, and just shrugged my shoulders and took the ribbing. But the next time I went there, they gave me a free one. Washington Whispers Continued from page 7 the Hobbits, and the Rurnplestilskins in our lives?\ Naturally, the audience stood up and applaudea. while C.I.A. director Casey reached for the tranquilizer gun. Anyway, back to the story at hand. Meese, Bennett, Liz Dole ancl Stockman strolled into the crowded bar room. Meese then fought his way to the front, ordering four double martinis and a club soda. The club soda was for Ted Kennedy, who was slumped over the pool table in the comer, babbling to Liz about how he always admired her intellectual prowess, not to mention her dressmaker. After a short time, she had had enough of the senator's blather, and wanted some real action, so she curtly excused herself and hustled onto the dance floor. Bill was already there, waving his designer tie around above his head, his burly hips flying to the left and to the right. Just as Liz began to peel off a few layers, everyone in the bar suddenly stopped, in mid whatever. There was an ominous presence in the room, and everyone could feel him coming like the plague. The Vice-President strolled in. He had come straight out of bed. His hair was tasseled, his glasses were on the back of his head and his Aqua Man underoos were visible below the thigh level of his bathrobe. But make no mistake. Though he looked ridiculous, his face revealed a sense of deep disappointment. It was at this point that Liz, Ed, Dave and Bill all knew they were in big, big trouble. Bill made a point of picking his beer-drenched tic up off the floor and fastening what was left of it to his collar. What did the evil Vice- President do to the delinquent members of his cabinet? Did Ted Kennedy ever make it home that night? Did Reagan ever repeal the declaration of war against Switzerland? Tune in next week ,when, provided that I'm not serving a summons for these remarks, we'll find out just how this ridiculous mess worked itself out. Until then, I'm a person of relative unimportance, and you were twisted enough to read my work. BROADWAY ..... HERE WE COME!!!!!! TO: COLLEGE COMMUNITY!!!!!!

. '\ 10 <Ir.onr.orbirnsf.s EI\IVIRDI\IMEI\IT May 9, 1991 Energy Efficient Lighting for the Indoors By MARK HARRIS When we think of conserving home energy ,we usually try to improve upon the efficiency of the big appliances-- refrigerators, air conditioners and hot water heaters. While these energy guzzlers account for considerable home energy use, we tend to overlook an energy hog we use almost every hour of the day-- the incandescent light bulb. Knowing that the average home has sockets for 27 light bulbs, we shouldn't be surprised to hear that almost seven percent of our total home energy use goes to fuel them. Fortunately, there are a nwnber of ways to improve on the standard bulb, as well as ways to replace it with more efficient sources. The Essence of Incandescence: The standard light bulb hasn't changed much in design, function or efficiency since Thomas Edison invented it over 100 years ago. Electricity passes through the base of the bulb up into the tungsten filament, causing it to glow and radiate light. The heat gradually burns off the tungsten, blackening the inside of the globe. Eventually, the filament breaks and the bulb burns out. While creating a nice \warm\ light, the incandescent lamp actually generates much more heat than light-- a whopping 85% more-- and is generally good for only 750 hours of use. Despite their inefficiency, incandescents are the best- selling bulbs, due to their widespread availability, low price (about $.75 apiece) and the fact that most of our lamps are designed to hold them. Nontheless, in an age of rising energy costs and growing environmental concerns, manufacturers have been busy trying to make these bulbs more efficient One way they have done so is by filling the bulbs with inert gases usually krypton or argon. This limits the rate at which the tungsten deteriorates, improving on the efficiency rate by a little more than five percent. Manufacturers advertise these bulbs with slogans such as \the light of a 75-watt bulb for on:ly 70 watts.\ General Electric's Miser, Philips' Econo- Miser and Sylvania's Energy Fincher are some of the more common brands available. However, as they usually net a savings of just five to eight watts, you'll save only a little energy and a few pennies on your electric bill. Even with improved energy efficiency, incandescents should be used sparingly, such as in closets or hallways where light isn't needed for extended periods. Halogen Lamps: A more efficient variation is the tungsten halogen lamp, which uses halogen gas to delay the evaporation of the filament. It burns at significantly lower temperatures and lasts up to four times as long as its standard counterpart. The Sylvania 72-watt Capsylite replaces a standard 100-watt incandescent, and lasts 3,500 hours. Halogens come in both standard and small sizes. Standard-sized bulbs fit ordinary lamp sockets, while narrow, 1\ long, halogen tubes are designed for specialty desk and reading lamps. The tiny halogens can be found in most hardware stores, but standard ones seem to be primarily in electrical supply stores and catalogs. Depending on the model and the size, halogen lamps can range anywhere from $5 to $26, a high price, but one made up in lower energy use and longer life. Due to their crisp, tightly-focused light, halogens make good reading lights. Florescent Lamps: The flourescent light first appreared on the market in the late. 1930s as an altemati ve to the incandescent bulb for home and industrial use. In flourescent tubes. electricity passes into the bulb via electrodes, ionizing the mercury gas inside the tube. The gas, in tum, generates ultraviolet light which excites the fluorescent powder coating ihe inside of the ~.ube, causing it to emit light. Flourescent lights last from seven to twenty times longer than standard incandescent lamps (the higher the wattage, the longer the life) and use only a fifth as much energy. The quality of fluorescent lamps has come a long way from the days of those long buzzing tubes that brightened your high school hallways with an antiseptic white light. Improved ballasts have all but eliminated loud humming sounds, and recent blends of various powders have achieved a warmer, more natural light. For this quality of light, look for lamps with a Color Rendering Index (CRI) in the 80's (on the scale of 1- 100). These models usually distinguish themselves from regular cool white lights with labels such as \daylight\ or \warm light\. Flourescent tubes and circular lamps are easily found in most hardware and lighting stores, and range in price from $4 to $15, depending on the wattage and model. Because of their bright and diffused light, flourescents are ideal for task lighting, such as in kitchens, bathrooms and workshops. Getting the Most From What You Have There are ways to stretch the energy efficiency of your lighting even further. By Attaching your lamps to dimmers and timers, you match lighting to a particular task. In the dining room, you can turn down the li~hts-- and the energy output-- for intimate dinners, and then turn them up for cards or board games. Three-way bulbs, which are also available in energy savings models, can serve the same purpose. And finally, don't forget that the most energy efficient bulb is the one that's not burning. In this day of rising energy costs, it's clear that the most \enlightened\ of us turn the lights off when we don't need them. This article was reprinted from The Environmental E- Magazine.

May 9, 1991 El\IVIRDI\IM:EI\IT Environmental Education By ISABEL C. LIRIANO Environmental Editor As an adult I realize that it is very difficult to change our habits to help our environment; however, all our efforts · should not be in vain. It is advised that we start teaching our children at a very young age how important our environment is and what they can do to help us change it. \Children must be told, and shown, that they can accomplish wonderful things for the earth, they need to feel the satisfaction that goes with doing something right and good. Children in the 1990s will need the confidence that they can change the world.\ Felicia Libo Wilbert (MER) Mothers for Environmental Responsibility. With all the budget cuts that are already taking place in programs to teach about the environment, environmentalists now more than ever need the help of parents. For example, · parents should start the children off with their lunchboxes. They should be encouraged to substitute earth friendly goods which are more comfortable to use and at the same time wise such as stainless utensils and cloth napkins. There is a widely available range of reusable containers that are useful for storage of yogurt and potato salad, for example. Parents can nurture children's creativity by asking their help in making disposable party favors such as masks, hats, or homemade pinatas that can be made from recyclable materials. such as egg cartons. Party planners such as balloons which are not biodegradable should not be used. A good advice to adults is that they should reinforce the environmentally sound habits they teach their children by practicing them too. If everything they learn in the home creates an impact on a child's life then the environment is ' definitely something they should learn about. Are You Happy· With Your Meal Plan?

Then they snap another loop on a stationary object. Result: They drown or strangle themselves. • Pelicans catch fish by plunging into the water. Occasionally, one will dive straight into a six-pack ring. Result: The bird ends up with the ring stuck around its bill; unable to open its mouth, it starves to death. • Young seals and sea lions get the rings caught around their necks. As they grow, the rings get tighter, and the animals suffocate. Some states now require six- pack rings to be photodegradable - which means they break down in sunlight after 30 days.

Union Medical Response Team To the Editors: A whil'e ago, a letter was printed in the Concordiensis cqneemiqg the formation of an Emergeu,cy Response Team/First Aid Squad. After some time and considerable work, tbis has become a reality. The name of this squad is UMED (Union Medical Response Team) Its service will be to provide Emergency First Aid at major college events such as Parent's Weeken<L Commencement, and Footbal1/Hockey games. Trained New York State Certified Emergency Medical Technicians along with other studnets will be manning these stations. Furthermore the squad will be working closely with Security and the College Administr2tion in order to maintain efficient and safe services for the college community. In addition, I would like to take this time to thank various people for there time and help in organizi11g the squad: Dean Mammola and the Dean of Students office, Paul Rieschick, Mr. Sakala, Mr. Delventhal and the Department of Athletics, Health Services, Student Forum and the Finance Committee, my friends, and anyone else I missed. Finally I would like to take this opportunity to thank Mr. Paul Mantica (Director of Security/Campus Operations) and the whole Security and Safety office for their Lime and patience and working with me .through the many meetings, problems, nuisances, and difficulties I caused in trying to set up the Squad-your help was extraordinary. lastly I would like to thank Security Officer Mike Hilton for undertaking the task as our Advisor. If anyone has any questions, would like more information about the squad, would like to join the squad, or request it at an event deemed necessary, please contact Arnon Rubin at Box 1777 or 386-4091. Thank you. Arnon Rubin Captain UMED The Basic Laws of Supply and Demand To the Editors: In the last few months, the administration has tightened its grip on the students of this institution. The policy of the administration to have all undergraduate students living on campus as well as on a meal plan is simply ridiculous. Economically, it makes sense to have all students on campus for more college income but to force them is an entirely different topic. Instead of making an irrational premature decision, the admiaistration should figure out wb.y students desire to live off campus. Could it be the cramped rooms? How about the dorms that are run down and covered with a ten year layer ·of pond scum? Or. maybe, possibly, it is the astronomical sum of money it costs to live in some of these sweaty hell holes. Off campw housing provides limitless meal options in a personal kitchen, easy access to campus, much nicer and larger living spaces, and a much lower cost when compared to college equivalents. The fact is, you get wllat you pay for off campus and you get something else when on campus. The administration should realize that .some students are not happy with the living conditioas available on campus. Instead of forcing students to live on campus, the administration should realize a basic law of economics: supply and demand. The school has two choices here. First, they could simply lower the price of housing to lure more renters in. Second, they could spend some money on the poor housing to make it worth paying the phenomenal sums for. As a sophomore at this school, I have been perfectly happy with my living conditions for the past two years. This does not mean that I am happy with the administration's. choice to ban off campus housing. I, along with other students, would like to keep my options open for the years to come. The administration is here for each and every one of us via the twenty thousand plus dollars it costs to come here. We are not just students, we are also customers. This college was picked by us for its various value. The administration is by no means above capitalism. I will gladly vote for a policy which forces students to live on campus just as soon as the administration and faculty are forced onto a full meal plan. Respectfully submitted, Chip Sudolnik '93 LETTERS <1i.llltCllrhirnsfs 13 Honorary Degr~es To the Editors: As this year's Chairman of the Campus Committee on Honorary Degrees, I believe it is appropriate to explain the process and report the honorees, and to comment on the May 2 Letter to the Concordiensis entitled \Seniors Surprised by Graduation Speaker.\ The Committee is comprised of two seniors, one junior, a faculty member from each of the four Divisions, and two Vice Presidents. This year's members were students Daniel J. Keniry '91, Hallie Neuberger '91, Rachel Rapaport '92, Professors Brenda Wineapple, Clifford Brown, George Butterstein and Frank Wicks, and Vice President for Institutional Planning Jack Maranville, and Vice President for College Relations Robert Rasmussen. Suggestions for Honorees and Graduation Speaker were solicited from students, faculty and staff, and alumni, and this solicitation resulted in 173 individuals to be considered by the Committee. The Committee met three times during the fall term. to consider these suggestions, and after substantial discussion and deliberation the Committee agreed upon 18 individuals to be submitted to President Hull. The Chairman submitted these 18 individuals, along with biographical briefs for each, as a letter to President Hull on J anu2cy 3, and copies of this letter were sent to each member of the Committee. The letter noted that while this list represented the Committee's recommendations., it is the President's prerogative to s11bmit additional names to the Board of Trustees. It was also noted that the Commencement Speaker should be selected from the honorary degree recipients; While this letter to the President completed the work of the Committee, President Hull did keep the Chairman informed of his actions, including the fact that he was sending invitations to two of the Committee's recommendations, and exercising his prerogative for selecting two additional Commencement honorees, including the Commencement Speaker. Three of the four invited individuals were able to accept. These Honorees are Marian Wright Edelman for Doctor of Letters and Commencement Speaker, and Gene E .. Likens and Edward Villella for Doctor of Humane Letters. It is also noted that John Ostrom '51, who was recommended by the Committee, was Founder's Day Speaker on February 28 and recipient of an honorary degree on that day. The Chairman has also disc11ssed possible improverncmts of the process with Committee members, including Mr. Keniry and Ms. Neuberger, and with President Hull, and has found that aU are committed to sustaining the Union tradition of honoring outstanding individuals. One agreed upon process improvement is for President Hull to meet with all members to review the committee's recommendations. In addition, President Hull has said that no speaker will be chosen without consultation with those representing the senior class. Finally, the Chairman wishes to thank all members of the Union College community who submitted thoughtful recommendations, and thank all members of the Committee for their excellent and dedicated performance in researching and deliberating upon this long list of very distinguished individuals. Sincerely, Frank Wicks Chairman and Division IV Member of Campus Committee on Honorary Degrees Hullocratic Process To the Editors: Students and parents should be aware of the repugnant autocracy which Roger Hull, the president of the college, has displayed during the so-called \Hathaway Mfair.\ $21,000 per year worth of educational priorities are at issue. The English Department's 9- 1 selection of Kit Hathaway from among a national search of candidates for a three-year visiting position was ignored by Hull. The student rally, accompanied by direct appeals to the Board of Trustees, was ignored by Hull. Perhaps we should have expected that the Board would ignore the pleas of the faculty, for they had ignored them during the college's presidential search mst year, when the faculty had begged that Hull not be given the job. But the students had liked Hull. Most of all, we thought that he would work with us, and not dictate to us. We thought wrong. About one thousand students, more than half the body, signed a petition asking that the Hathaway decision be re-evaluated by a fair procedure that students, faculty, and administrators could all agree upon. The faclllty passed a similar resolution. Students and faculty were distraught that Hull had acted unilaterally and with questionable motives, and that is what we protested. Some were particularly upset that a brilliant and accomplished poet was dismissed, but all were interested in making sure that decision which affect students and faculty would be made, at least in some measurable part, by students and faculty. Hull's response to the students and faculty missed the point, because again he ignored both groups. We objected to a unilateral decision and Hull has tried to remedy the matters by issuing anotller unilateral decision. He has further asked that the matter be laid to rest The matter will never be laid to rest, because Roger will continue to make decisions that affect students and faculty. With each decision, Roger may think he is right, but none among us is omniscient, and that is why we are not asked, nor would we want to be asked, to unilaterally determine what is best for others. There must always be dialogue and negotiation, \processes\ that will usually yield not only a more favorable decision but also a decision that is more favorably received. Maybe Hathaway can no longer be saved for Union. We had asked Roger to reconsider - and not to rule by decree - and he handed us an edict disguised as a fiat in the form of an announcement circulated to the faculty. If only we could go back and reconsider Roger. Perhaps that is what we should have asked the Board to do when we rallied. Sincerely Andrew Seewald '91 ' ', ', \ '\ S.S. Union Sinking Errata To the Editors: You'll be llappy to hear that I shall be brief. I almost barfed up my Wheaties when I heard that my commencement speaker would be Ms. Marian Wright. It's not tnat I have any vendetta against her or what she stands fer, but that it was dropped on us without discussion {do figure). Up to last Thursday, I thought the Honorary Degree Committee was working with the results of last Fall's student surveys in mind. I for one voted for John Cleese. I know a lot of other people did too. I'm not saying we were in the majority, but the \type\ of speaker which Ms. Wright appears to be was not even on the survey. rm not sure what rm getting at, so I'll end this letter soon. Whomever is steering the S.S. Union may want to check for some leaks in the hull. With My Undying Love, Carl R. Friedrich, Jr. '91 · .

Respectfully submitted, Chip Sudolnik '93 LETTER!i <irllltrorbirnms 13 Honorary Degrees To the Edi,tors: As this year's Chairman of the Campws Committee on Honorary Degrees, I believe it is appropriate to explain the process and report the honorees, and to comment on the May 2 Letter to the Concordiensis enti tied \Seniors Surprised by Graduation Speaker.\ The Committee is comprised of two seniors, one junior, a faculty member from each of the four Divisions, and two V icc Presidents. This year's members were students Daniel J. Kcniry '91, Hallie Neuberger '91, Rachel Rapaport '92, Professors Brenda Wineapplc, Clifford Brown, George Butterstcin and Frank Wicks, and Vice President for Institutional Planning Jack Maranville, and Vice President for College Relations Robert Rasmussen. Suggestions for Honorees and Graduation Speaker were solicited from students, faculty and staff, and alumni, and this solicitation resulted in 173 individuals to be considered by the Committee. The CommitLee met three times during the fall term to consider these suggestions, and after substantial discussion and deliberation the Committee agreed upon 18 individuals to be submitted to President Hull. The Chairman submitted these 18 individuals, along with biographical briefs for each, as a letter to President Hull on January 3, and copies of this letter were sent to each member of the Committee. The letter noted that while this list represented the Commiucc's recommendations., it is the President's prerogative to submit additional names to the Board of Trustees. It was also noted that the Commencemcn t Speaker should be selected from the honorary dcgrc.c rccipicnLs. While this kncr to the President completed the work of the Committee, President Hull did keep the Chairman informed of his actions, including the fact that he was sending invitations to two of the Committee's recommendations, and exercising his prcrogati vc for selecting two additional Commencement honorees, including the Commcnccml·nt Speaker. Three of the four invited individuals were ahlc to accl.'pL These Honorees arc Marian Wright Edelman for Doctor of Letters and Commcncemen t Speaker, and Gene E. Likl.'ns and Edward Villella for Doctor of Humane Letters. It is also noted that John Ostrom '5 I, who was recommended by the Committee, was Founder's Day Speaker on February 28 and recipient of an honorary degree on that day. The Chairman has also discussed possible improvements of the process with Committee members, including Mr. Kcniry and 1\ts. Neuberger, and with President Hull, and h<L'i found that all an: committed to sustaining thL~ Union lradition of htHH)ring outstanding indi\'idual'-'.

Sincerely, FrJnk Wicks Chairman ami Division IV l\kmher of Campus Committee on Hnnomry Degrees Hullocratic Process To the Editors: Students and parents should be aware of the repugnant autocracy which Roger Hull. the president of the college, has displayed during the so-called \Hathaway Affair.\ $21,000 per year worth of educational priorities are at issue. The English Department's 9- 1 selection of Kit Hathaway from among a national search of candidates for a three-year visiting position was ignored by Hull. The student rally, accompanied by direct appeals to the Board of Trustees, was ignored by Hull. Perhaps we should have expected that the Board would ignore the pleas of the faculty, for they had ignored them during the college's presidential search last year, when the faculty had begged that Hull not be given the job. But the students had liked Hull. Most of all, we thought that he would work with us, and not dictate to us. We thought wrong. About one thousand students, more than half the body, signed a petition asking that the Hathaway decision be re-evaluated by a fair procedure that students, faculty, and administrators could all agree upon. The faculty passed a similar resolution. Students and faculty were distraught that Hull had acted unilaterally and with questionable motives, and that is what we protested. Some were particularly upset that a brilliant and accomplished poet was dismissed, but all were interested in making sure that decision which affect students and faculty would be made, at least in some measurable part, by students and faculty. Hull's response to the students and faculty missed the point, because again he ignored both groups. We objected to a unilateral decision and Hull has tried to remedy the matters by issuing another unilateral decision. He has further asked that the matter be laid to rest The matter will never be laid to rest, because Roger will continue l() make decisions that affect students and faculty. With cacll decision, Roger may think he is right, but none among us is omniscient, and that is why we arc not asked, nor would we want to be asked, to unilaterally determine what is best for others. There must always be dialogue and negotiation, \processes\ that will usually yield not only a more favorable decision but also a decision that is more favorably received. Maybe Hathaway can no longer be saved for Union. We had asked Roger to reconsider - and not to rule by decree - and he handed us an edict disguised as a fiat in the form of an announcement circulated to the faculty. If only we could go back and reconsider Roger. Perhaps that is what we should have asked the Board to do when we rallied. Sincerely Andrew Seewald '91 S.S. Union Sinking Errata To the Editors: You'll be happy to hear that I shall be brief. I almost barfed up my Wheaties when I heard that my commencement speaker would be Ms. Marian Wright. It's not that I have any vendetta against her or what she stands for, but that it was dropped on us without discussion (do figure). Up to last Thursday, I thought the Honorary Degree Committee was working with the results of last Fall's student surveys in mind. I for one voted for John Cleese. I know a lot of other people did too. I'm not saying we weFe in the majority, but the \type\ of speaker which Ms. Wright appears to be was not even on the survey. I'm not sure what I'm getting at, so I'll end this letter soon. Whomever is steering the S .S. Union may want to check for some leaks in the hull. With My Undying Love, Carl R. Friedrich, Jr. '91 The Concordiensis would like to apologize for its publication of the Letter- to the Editor entitled \Minerva Trail of Tears 11 on page 14, of its May 2 issue. The letter, although signed by Susan Kersch '91, was NOT written by her. We urge the college community to disregard the content of the letter. Once again, we extend our deepest regrets for any inconvenience or misconception the letter has caused. Anyone with information regarding the actual author of this letter is urged to contact either the Concordiensis or the Dean of Students Office.

' ., Olrurrnrbirnstn LEIIER!i Libelous Letter to the Editor To tlle Editors: This letter is written on behaU of the members of Ludlow House. In the May 2, 1991 issue of the Concord i ens is , there appeared a letter to the editor entitled \Minerva Trail of Tears\. In this -letter, accusations about our program were made that were so libelous and grossly inaccurate that they can only be explained as an act of vindictive malice. However, by far the worst crime committed was that the person(s) responsible for this letter took the liberty of submitting it for publication under the name of Susan Kersch. As part of this College, the program known as Ludlow House has striven not only to uphold, but to advance the principles of Minerva which the author of the letter so carelessly and self-servingly invokes. In the interest of dispelling any doubts about Ludlow House which may linger as a result of the accusations made, we would just like to make a few things about our program clear. The idea of a substance free environment is for us a means to an end, rather than an end in and of itself. As we see it, the purpose of Ludlow House is to augment Union College social alternatives, not to replace or probibit those which already exist. As such, those who are of age and who wish to do so are free to consume alcohol. We simply do not design the bulk of our social interactions around its consumption. As to the allegation that our applicaton process is \an unwritten series of political and social tests that applicants must pass in order to enter Ludlow House,\ we are simply baffled. We are perhaps the most concentrated group of diverse individuals to be found in one place on campus, spanning most of the majors offered and being involved in virtually every variety of extracurricular activity available. Furthermore, we cannot fathom where the accusation of arbitrary selectivity originated from, as almost everyone who has ever applied to Ludlow House either has or is currently living here. Our selection process is done democratically by all members of tile House and our criteria are based solely on perceived ability to contribute meaningfully and actively to the program. Finally, we feel it necessary to address the serious allegation that we have used College funds to purchase alcohol. Frankly, this is simply absurd considering that material help from the college has manifested itself primarily in the form of magazine subscriptions and food for barbecues. Ludlow House funds used for Ludlow House activities come from Ludlow House members. It is a reprehensivle act of base cowardice that someone would falsely (and for no apparent reason) attack us in such a fashion. Furthermore, it is intolerable that they would then not even affix their own name to the serious charges leveled. As if this were not enough, it is an act of blatant and personal cruelty that the party reponsible would descend to the level of using Susan Kersch's name to further these ridiculous allegations. We at Ludlow House hope ~hat the college community will ignore the allegation~ made in the letter and will help us in discovering and prosecuting the person(s) responsible. Sincerely, Mark Kuritz, Beth Isenbrg, Susan Kersch, Marc Unger, Cheryl Urbanczyk, Martin McKee, Dave Shepard, Ashley Reeve, Amy Yuskaitis, Xavier Cheynet, Steve Kinne, Rudy Paul, Audrey Bell, Hyla Sweet, Jenifer Bennet, Victoria Mamzeleva, Charles Calkins, Jen Park, Eric Fullar, Rich Ahl, Dallas Pitt. William Stevenson and Pete Ivanyi. The Real Susan Kersch To the Editors: Just for the record. I did not write the letter to the editors published in last week's issue of Concordiensis titled \Minerva Trail of Tears\ which bore my name. This article contained nothing but misinformation and lies. Anyone who has lived in Ludlow House or is at all familiar with their activities would realize this quickly. I do not wish to address the false claims the incorrectly named author put forth. Rather, I wislt to question the fact that the letter was published at all. I am disgusted by the complete incomJ)etence revealed by this act: it has long been the responsibility of a newspaper to confirm sources for all pieces submitted. Having a name typed on the bottom of an article or letter does not substantiate its source. Obviously, the 500 word limit on letters to the editor is not all that is being ignored. I am also seriously dismayed that someone would actually send a letter bearing some unsuspecting person's name. It is a sorry indictment of the Union College community that a person like this exists among us. Furthermore it is a dangerous precedent that such a piece can find its way to publication. The real Susan R. Kersch '91 May 9, 1991 Students Will Continue To Be Heard! To the Editors: I wish to address the editorial in last week's Concordiensis entitled \No Support, No Improvements\. In addition to paying lip-service to the uncooperative Roger Hull, the article is an insult to the student body. Instead of appealing to students and faculty to roll over and play dead as Roger makes unilateral policy decisions with little or no regard to student and faculty input, you should be appealing to Roger Hull to cooperate. The author makes some dangerous assumptions. She calls to the Union community recommending that we \assume that President Hull will do what is best for the college community.\ Is she suggesting that members of the faculty, many of whom have been at Union for decades, are incapable of determining what is best for Union? And what of students, many of whom have been here three years longer than Roger? The campus community has sustained itself for years following a system in which faculty members maintain a good degree of autonomy in making important academic decisions. Roger and his cohorts, Jim Underwood and '!'erry Weiner, have severely violated this autonomy. The Hathaway case is just one example and students and faculty responded justifiably with protest. Students, too, have always exercised an important role in making certain decisions. One example of this-- and one that has been completely ignored by the Concordiensis editorial staff-- is the decision involving the graduation speaker for the Class of '91 (See the letter in last week's Concordiensis by Daniel J. Keniry and Hallie Neuberger). The fact that this decision resulted in an excellent commencement speaker does not excuse the autocratic manner in whiclt it was made. Both the Hathaway case and this decision lend credence to the argument that Roger talks a whole lot about student and faculty input, but acts in spite of it. The final point I wish to address is that of what the author calls the \student apathy\ that ensued in the aftermath of the rallies. Nothing, I assure you, could be further from the truth. There are approximately 20 students who took part in organizing our information campaign, the petition drive, and the rallies. Our meetings have continued through the present. (Furthermore, I find it extremely ironic that this statement was made by an editor-in-chief who didn't even find the student rallies worthy of student newspaper coverage! Now that's real apathy!) The editorials this tenn have repeatedly taken defeatist stances on important student issues, which surrender the role of Concordiensis as the student voice. We are not apathetic! Students across the country at various educational institutions are no longer sitting down as decisions that directly affect them and their education are being handed down by despotic administrators. Union students are not alone. During these times, we all need the help and support of our fellow students, not defeatist jargon. Let us look out for our own interests, cooperating when the situation allows, but without hesitating to display our discontent in a public arena when our interests are trampled. We shall continue to have our voices heard. Sincerely, Franz T. Litz '91 In Defense of the English Department To the Editors: If a mere fraction of what I have been told about the venom of the faculty meeting on April 22 is true, what took place was nothing less than a trashing of a group of scholars and. teachers of unusual quality. This behavior should not pass without response. Members of the English department have a record of professional achievement that measures up well against that of any college English department in the United States. The department's current members have published well over 20 books, and dozens and dozens of articles, reviews, stories, and poems in the best journals; its members regularly deliver conference papers and chair conference sessions. The department's faculty has received fellowships from the Guggenheim Foundation (two), the National Endowment for the Humanities (two), the National Endowment for the Arts,. the American Council of Learned Societies, the Ingram Merrill Foundation, and the H11ntington Library, among others. In short, members of the English department have received virtually every prestigious fellowship award available in the Humanities. During my years as English Department Chair, I was told repeatedly by members of the Facility Review that the department placed at the top of the school in the college's rating of teachers. Subsequent Chairs received a similar message, and it has been consistently substantiated by tile bigh number of merit awards given to members of tile department each year. This demonstrable excellence in the classroom has been steadily applied to what a team of disting11ished outside evaluators praised as an impressive selection of departmental, college-wide, and multi- disciplinary courses. Members of the Englislt department have also served, and served well, on virtually all major college committees. Contrary to rumors and accusations, the English department is, by-and-large, comprised of individuals who respect each other, who argue out disagreements, who readily submit differences to resolution by discourse and majority vote. If the department has made any mistakes, it has done so honestly, and only after careful considerations, open discussions, and the full vote of all members. It's worth noting when evaluating the department's .ability to make successful recr11itment choices that every member of the English department hired to fill a tenure track position since I began to teach at Union college 15 years ago has passed his or her tenure review. To what extent, then, is the department ';divided\ and \troubled?\ Although members of the department may have differences of opinion, one senior member remains \divided\ from the department, \troubling\ it from within and without with a two-decades long campaign of vilification. Efforts begun over a year ago to get the Dean to help the department resolve this \trouble'i have elicited no conclusive action of which I have been informed. When I asked recently what I would wish my two sons to carry away from their educanons,Iresponded,fmally, that I hooe that they'll be able to apply what they have intellectually experienced to the ways they live, the ways they behave. I want them to take the things they have learned to their logical consequences in human action. I want them to \do the right thing.\ I believe that the English department with substantial support from students and faculty has done the right thing, and that is the true measure of its exceptional quality.

.., ... ~- 116 @JillCI)rltimis LIFESTYLE§ . May 9 • :J ~-. By RON EUGENIO \I have a big problem with labels. I think they're too narrow to at least describe myself. I think that I have more depth than that. I wouldn't consider myself to be a feminist, or an animal rights activist, or an environ- mentalist, although I do possess characteristics of all of them, or even a Deadhead for that matter! I think they're too narrow, and too shallow to describe most people. II It's hard to talk about the Union stereotype and where a student f.its in, when that self- same student refuses to acknowledge any stereotypes whatsoever. Exuberantly open- minded, Stana Cahan may be the perfect target for Union's new plan of future diversity. As a Freshman she chose this college over Skidmore (\Only on the last day they took acceptance letters\) and it's not surprising that Union's student make-up is a lot like her hometown of Greenwich-by- way-of-Saratoga. But once again. conformity and stereotypes narrow. \I don't like giving descriptions, On Campus Activities For Parents• Weekend THURSDAY, MAY 9 1 L30 a.m. College Center Aud.

THE WOMEN SERIES: Starra Cahan - An Interview With No Label typical descriptions, because I think that stereoLypes are just too narrowing. I've never thought about it because I'd rather·not think of people in those terms.\ Our conversation took place in her suite at Davidson, in her room festooned with ballet posters, ballet prints, and a pink pair of ballet slippers pinned up. Mter five years of dancing, she was even offered a ballet scholarship at Skidmore. It was no surprise, then that one observation against Union is that there's only one (beginning) ballet class here. Otherwise she's quite unfazed, stressing people she has met and the three years she has left here. Next year she plans on getting involved in other activities (Big Brothers/Big Sisters popped up), and will start thinking about her future, which includes Law School, becoming a judge, and making an impression, a legacy, for generations to come. And she has a great middle name (Jazzle). A few Starra Fun Facts! -She does a Blues show on WRUC with Kevin Jones from Midnight-2:00 a.m. on WRUC -She doesn't like the word \dumb\, and likes the sound of the word \rebel\. -She doesn't watch a lot of T.V., with the exception of the occasional L.A. Law. -Twice in the course of the interview, she excitedly told me to \Ask me more questions! II -When I asked her how she liked her floor (3rd Davidson North) this year, she replied \I like it; it's co-ed.\ Q-How do you feel as a female student here at Union? A-I don't feel as a 'female' here at Union; I feel as a person here at Union. I feel good about it. Basically, I like Union College. I really do. A lot of people are quick to say they don't like it for specific reasons, just because it's human nature to be discontent in your surroundings ... Q-Or cynical? A-Yeah. But I really like it. Of course there are a little stupid things that I don't really like. Occasionally I find myself saying I don't like something, but nothing really important. Q---As a female, or as a person, would you change anything here? A-I don't know, what are you looking for? Well, I like the trimester system, I don't mind that. I do think it's dumb in that we go back two weeks into September and get out late into June. I'd rather go in with everybody else-we're ready anyway. I would prefer to go back September frrst. Q-What's the cheesiest pickup line you've ever heard? A-Actually, there are two: \Hi I'm wearing black underwear\ and \Hi do you dream about me?\- Q-Ewww, how cheap!

American Psycho: Portrait of a Man (or an author?) A Book Review By JULIE MEDON Arts Ellltor Brct Easton Ellis, age 26, is the author of Less Than Zero and Tile Rules of Attraction. Ellis' latest novel, America11 Psycho, is his third attempt at writing a novel reflecting die fast track drug culture of the 1980s. Anyone who has read Ellis' previous works knows what to expect from A.m eric an Psycho: shaHow, wealthy, appearance-conscious characters who are utterly selfish as they speed down the road to ruin. ~ell, Ellis threw everyone, mcluding his publishing company, Simon and Schuster, a curve ball this time. Patrick Bateman, the main character in American Psycho, is not your ordinary stoclc broker on Wall Street. Yes, he embodies all the necessary elements mentioned above ... plus one. When Bateman is not at work , he doubles as a freelance serial killer. Interesting? Possibly. But apparently, Simon and Schuster didn't agree, for they decided not to publish American Psyclto late last November. The.~ novel was picked up less than a month later by Vantage, and was released in early March. The controversy over the contents of the novel (brutal murders of prostitutes, beggars, homosexuals, cab drivers, dogs, and children, to name a bunch), led the National Organization for Women (NOW) to throw a major fit, asking that the book be banned due to its anti-feminist depictions. But the good old U.S. of A. has a little \freedom of speech\ rule that overrode NOW's concerns. (Isn't it funny how our government enters the scene on pornography, but not on womens' issues and racism? Food for thought!) I decided to read American Psycho in order to get a better understanding of wily the novel has been such a debated topic. I'd like to quote a few passages to you, although there are very few that are even \clean\ enough for me to want to print here. \A good personality consists of a chick who has a little hardbody and who will satisfy all sexual demands without being too slutty about things and who will essentially keep her dumb f-ing mouth shut.\ A male chauvinist pig's guide to life, wouldn't you say? There is so much more from where that came from, and those comments don't have anything to with the murders that take place Believe me, it gets worse. Our psychotic hero, Pat Bateman, uses a nail gun to keep women's hands attached to the wall before he kills them. He cuts off their lips. He sprays mace in their faces while calling out \bitch\. He bites off nipples. cuts out vaginas and \deflates\ breasts. Afterwards, he eats his victim's intestines and brains, while rolling around in the blood and the gore. And the irony here is that Bateman is never caught. He goes to dinners and lunches in the best restaurants in Manhattan with blood on his shirt sleeves, confesses to almost everyone, and yet no one even hears him. Conversation revolves round \Can I wear argyle socks with a suit?\ alld \Nice tan ... do you go to a tanning salon, or is 'thatQT?\ The fact is, Ellis isn't even a good writer. His characters are completely underdeveloped, so much so that you don't even mourn them when they are dead. I · found the dialog11e between torture scenes to be relatively banal and the writing style weak. (For example, the first sentence of the book is also the first paragraph of the book. Ellis, .apparently, did not take precept) In fact, I enjoyed the m mders the most, because at least tllen something was happening. Ellis devotes entire chapters to Bateman's analysis of Huey Lewis and The News, Whitney Houston and Genesis. Although I tried to find relevance in tllese musicians, thinking may!) e Ellis is striving for deeper meaning, I could not make anything connect. Then I thought,\Oh?! Ellis, like T.S. Eliot, is saying that there in fact are no connections, no meaning at all, in modem life.\ Don't be ridiculous, Jul. There is nothing in Ellis' analysis of nothing that would make it worth anything in the long run. If American Psyd1o accomplished anything, it probably gives some sick guy in Manhattan the idea to kill for a hobby. One more thing: the last line of the book (which is also the last paragraph of the boolc) ends with \This is Not An Exit.\ This, to me, means two things: Pat Bateman will always be free, and Bret Easton Ellis will write another novel. Please, don't let the latter come true. Women's Union Film Series May9 Cadi's Family ,. (Social Science 16) · Wome·n's Liberation .

If this release gains widespread popularity that question will come up, and I can't tell you which I'd pick. I still think \Children of the Revolution\ is their all-titne best song, but that's just my opinion. Others will hear their remake of \Do You Really Want to Hurt Me\ and fall in love with the Femmes. Whatever the case, this is an exceptional release from a great band. I give it four and half singing birds (out of five)! David Butner- Strange Journey (Susquehanna Hat Wednesday Movie: LOVE STORY (bring tissues) 7:30 and 9:30 (C Auditorium Co.) - by Aaron Ambrosino David Butner's Strange Journey is just that. This eight-song album combines modem rock with a blend of reggae, funk, jazz and R&B to take the listener on a strange journey. All songs on the album were written . and produced by Butner himsetl. He also has an all-star cast of musicians (Ronny Drayton, Delmar Brown and The Uptown Horns to name a few) who accompany him on the album. Strange Journey artfully combines many different sytles of music without offending the listeners' ears. \Strange Journey\ the title cut, has a rock edge to it witll a screeching guitar solo to satisfy your cravings. \Birthday Party\ has a funky feel with a gr~t hom solo to match. The last track, Boxes, Bags & Cart on s is my personal fav()rite on the album. It is a jazzier sounding song that resembles Elvis Costello's \Pads Paws & Claws\. It's a so11g most college students (especially seniors) can relate t<>. If you like rock, jazz, reggae, fllnk and R&B, and are a great fan of horns, then this album wo11't disappoint you. It's a great step in the direction· of crossing over different styles of masic into different musical realms.

Comm.ents from the College Community are solicited and may be addressed to Box 2224 or any member of the Committee. Note: This is member a of all I. The Committee's Charge and Procedures ln November 1990, President Hull formed a comniittee to examine the recommendations of the Middle States Committee on the Freshman Year and Residential Life. A major Tecommendat:ion of the Middle States Committee was that all campus housing be made coed. President Hull asked our committee either to \endorse the Middle States recommendations, in whole or in part, or to modifY them in any way you deem appropriate.\ Given the far reaching implications of the issue we were charged to investigate for student life m general, and for Greek housing in particular, the committee was composed of two deans who oversee aspects of student life, four faculty with different views on Greek organizations, and four students representing both Greeks and Independents. 1 The preliminary recomrnendatiotts we put forward in this report are based on ten weeks of intensive inquiry, during which we solicited the opinions of the campus community through a memo an<! notices in Conc()rdiensis, met with 40 individuals and groups, conducted two S11I'Veys 2 , and reviewed the findings and spoke with staff at other colleges which have recently conducted their O\vn studies of residentiallife 3 . We also toured and did some participant-observation in the residence halls and one of us spent a few days living in West and Davidson. In addition, 35 students in an anthropology course gathered data about life in the residence halls, fraternities and sororities. 1 Committee members are Antoinette Ai.me, Class of '91, Eugene Bernard, Class of '91, Barbara Boyer, Biology, George Gmelch (Chair), Anthropology, James Kenney, Economics, Andrew Seewald, Class of '91, Lisa Stillman, Class of ;91, Hilary Tann, Music, Trish Williams, Assistant Dean of Students, David Wood, Director of Residence Life. 2 A questionnaire was sent to all students asking their opinions on a variety of issues concerning campus housing. Only 289 of the more than 2000 questionnaires sent out were returned. A second questionnaire, sent to the Admissions Staff, Athletic Coaches, and Gatekeepers, was aimed specifically at assessing the possible impacts of the Middle States all coed housing recommendation. The detailed results of the questionnaires may be reviewed in the Residence Life office. 3 We are indebted to administrators and the committees that examined residence life at Bucknell, Colby, Kenyon, Southern Vermont, and Wesleyan. Our ideas and recommendations have been shaped by their experiences which tlley generously shared with us.

24- OJoiDrbitltsis RE!!iiDEI\ITIAL LIFE COMMITTEE REPD·RT May 9, 1991 We began our deliberations by reviewing the findings of other Union •C()rnrnittees that had examined these same issues. We were surprised at how fre<juently residential life llas been studied at Union--there have been five reports siace 1979. 4 And we were disappointed that the considerable time and effort that went into these excellent studies appeared to have realized so little change. All of t.he reports, except the most recent one, appear to have been shelved and largely f()r_gotten. Initially, our committee was asked to submit its recommendations to President Hull at the end of winter term. However, given the impact that our recommendations might have on student life, we requested a one term extension i11 order to allow the campus community time to review our proposals. Hence, this repa.rt is a working draft. We invite and encourage you--students, faculty, and stEtff--to consider what we have proposed and to give us your reactions. We aim t() spend the next month listening to your views before drafting our final report by the end of spring term. II. Residential Life and the College Mission Statement The day-to-day living experiences of students in the residence halls and in carnpus activities figure prominently in the shapiDg of their values and in their personal development. Like other colleges who have recently examined residential life, we found that Union students consider campus life as important to their personal development as their academic learning. Yet, our committee found that quality of residential life at Union College has received scant attention, beyond pfovidi.ng basic housing and amenities. We found a disturbing separation between t:he academic and social lives of our students. Like other American colleges who ()flicially renounced in loco parentis authority over the conduct and moral behavior ()ftluir students in the 1960's, Union has largely neglected what takes place ()Utside the classroom. In recent years many campuses have responded to that aeglect and are now paying closer attention to the residential life of students. Many colleges now think and talk in terms of a residential system, while Union's approach remains haphazard and piecemeal. We have tended to treat problems as they arise; our planning of residential life has not been guided by a set of ()Ver-arching principles or explicit goals. As we examined residential life at Union and sorted through the specific pl'()blems and issues, several basic principles guided our inquiry. The most irnpntant is equity. Our investigation confirmed what the Middle States Committee had reported. There is serious inequity in the distribution of living and S()da.l spaces between Greek and non-Greek students and indirectly, therefore, l>etween men and women. All members of the Committee believe this to be unjust a.Jld tllat students must have equal opportunity in their choice of housing and that within college housing all students should be treated the same. A second guiding principle is our belief that the College's residential system shollld offer students choice of living arrangements, as well as leadership opp()rtunities and social interactions in a safe, comfortable, and supportive atnosphere where all students are equally valued. We also believe there should be linlcage between the academic and the residential/social goals of the college. A third principle was the desire to preserve the freedom of students to associate socially with whomever they please. We believe that Union's residential life system should strike a balance between the values of independence and privacy on tlte one hand and of community on the other. Recommendation: Plannin~t for changes in Union's social and residential structures should be guided by the goals of the College's M:ission Statement. We recommend that the College formulate the basic pri.ndples on which Union's residential life is founded and incorporate these in the Mission Statement. III. College-Owned Housing: Upgrade Union's residence halls mirror the history of the College. All of our dorms were constructed when Union was an all-male institution and when a high Jlercentage of the student body joined Greek organizations during freshman year. Most of our residence halls were designed to provide the freshman class with little mor-e than a place to sleep. It was expected that most student social life would ta.lte fllace in fraternity houses. The residence halls were designed to provide a l!lrumnum number of beds; hence, most of our residence halls were built without la'i.IIldry rooms and without adequate entry ways, lounge spaces, study /reading :r~or:ns, and recreation areas. The absence of attractive commons space or lounges in most residence halls lias inhibited the development of a sense of community within the buildings. With fe~ e:xceptions, only the Greek organizations have a strong sense of community. In tl:te w-ords of one student, whose sentiments are shared by many: My dorm isn't the kind of place where you want to hang out. It's just the place where you sleep, and then you get out .... All the social life here is the frat parties where there is drinking and it's all free. If you don't go to the fraternities at night then basically you don't go out. In recent years the college has modified some residential spaces to meet student needs. However, the renovations have been largely cosmetic and limited i:n scope. As a consequence, major structural renovation is now required to put our residence halls on an equal footing with those on most other campuses. The Committee found that many Union students believe that their housin,g oeoeds have been neglected by the College. A refrain frequently heard in the dorms i:n response to unhappiness with the food service, deteriorating conditions, and CJVerdue repairs is, \And we are paying $21,000 for this.\ Most students believe tliat the cost of their room and board is excessive for what they receive and that t:hey- can live better and more cheaply in off campus apartments. Committee members were shocked at the poor and inadequate conditions we [()un d in our tours of the residence halls, such as erratic control of heat and hot water for showers, and general shabbiness in some halls. We believe that students YYI\lo roast or freeze in their rooms or who are scalded in the showers are being 4 Report of the Committee on Student Life and Student Affairs for the Middle States Commission, 1979; The President's Commission Subcommittee on the Attraction and Retention of Women Students, 1986; Report on Residence Life, 19~6; Report of the Committee on Coeducation, 1989; and The Middle States C~mmittee's Freshman Year and Residence Life, 1990. neglected at the most basic level The College's apparent lack of concern for the residential needs of the studentslll.ay contribute to a ·lack of respect for college property. Acts of vandalism by st111dents worsens the pl'oblem by diverting labor and resources required to maint.ai.n the residence halls. Recommendation: The College should respect the basic needs of its student population in terms of heat, light, and bathroom facilities. We recommend that all College·CIWied housing be upgraded to achieve certain acceptable standards in terms of lighting, space, condition, and bathroom facilities. Furthe~,. we recommend that procedures for routine maintenance be established l>y the Campus Operations Staff in collaboration with the Office.dr Residence Life. Recommendation: To ~aise the standard of cleanliness and to address the chronic problem ·<»f making repairs in a timely fashion, 14 members of the housekeepmg staff and 4 general maintainers responsible for maintaining the residenc~· halls .should report directly to the Office of Residential Life. This require:s additional staff, t~ot merely the reassignment .of maintainers :from physical plant to the Office of Residence Life. Recommendation: All Cl~llege housing .shollld attain a certain minimum standard of commow space. In residemce halls each floor should have commons space lfJaBerous enough to accommodate social events for the entire floor. Recommendation: To emhance the College's ability to create a sense of community in the residencBi balls and a more stimulating living/learning ·environment~ each residence hall should have a live-in director. Ideally the director 'Would be a member of the faculty. The stipend and the accommodati<»D. should be made attractive enough to appeal to faculty. (We note tha:t other campuses which have faculty living in residence halls express a high degll'ee of satisfaction witlJ. this arrangement. It greatly increases student contact ..vith faculty and faculty presence on campus and in the residence halls after hours :and on weekends. It also provides new faculty with affordable housing and hastems their socialization into the college community.) IV. College·iQwned Housing: Expansion Union College advertises itself as a residential college. Yet, we only have enough space to accommodate 7(3~ of our students. Consequently, 279 of Our 469 seniors currently live off campus. In College-owned housing there are beds for 1435 students of which 314 are re:served for Greeks (89 in three sororities and 225 in nine fraternities.) Among the ll.l21 beds available to independent students, 63% are in coed residence halls and 371% in single sex residence halls. (See Appendix 1 for details of student housing.) ']he vast majority of the off-campus students we interviewed said that they would. prefer to be on campllS if adequate housing were available to them. Further confianation can be found i:n the 1986 study of residence life in which 129 of 13~ students who were living off campus indicated they would return if apartment style dorm,s were available. 5 Research at other campUSEs, and confirmed in DIU survey of Union students, indicates that the housing prefere11ces of students change as they advance through their college years. Residence h:alls are designed to fit tb.e needs of younger students, particularly those who a.:re gregarious and interested in group participation. As students matura>, independence, privacy and the ability to prepare one's own meals become importBlllt. In a three volume review of the research on the impact of residence halls on students, Blimling (1988) reports that residence halls are judged unsatisfactory n.<lt because they fail to meet the needs of freshmen but because they fail to meet the lleeds of upperclassmen. The Middle States Committee found that, while freshmen were content with their dorms, 67% of upperclass women were dissatisfied with the opportuni-ties for housing available to them (p. 91). [t is important to niClte that the college community benefits from the presence of upperclassmen on caJDpus, for the leadersh.:ip they provide and for their participation in campus social life. We note that the construction of townhouse apartments was recommended by the Middle States Committee (p. 107). Townhouse apartments should offer students the same benefits that poresently make living <lff campus so attractive (e.g., control over their meals, p~'Vacy, and independen<:e). A townhouse complex could also be used as summer hlll,jlsing for campus conferences. Possible locations include: 1. between West and Richmond; 2. on the knoll overlooking Jackson Gardens (it would not be visible .firom the gardens); 3. on the corner of Lenox and Union. Upon completion of the townhouse complex, Union undergratluates will generally be expected to live in ~!lege owned or reco{Plized housing. Special permission wouid have to be obta:ined in advance by students wishing to live off campus. Recommendation: To :a«Jhieve our stated goal ol being a \residential college\ and to provide a mol'e attractive housing option for upperclassmen, the College mould build a 60 to 165 unit townh()use complex: with kitchen faciliti~s to house appro:!dmately 250 jlllliors and seniors. V. Retention of Opport.-uility to Live in Single Sex Residence Halls The Middle States Committee on the Freshman. Year and Residence Life recommended that all campus ll.olllSing be made coed (p. 105). Our survey of students, admissions staff, gatekeepers, athletic staff. as well as conversations with parents and fieldwork in the do:m!S, has convinced us that there is a strong student demand for single sex: l\.(!Sidence halls, particularly for women. A majority of the students living in single se::x dorms prefer them to any of the alternative living arrangements. We receiv~Jd two petitions with 135 signatures C>f students, facUlty, and staff requesting that Richmond and South remain single sex.. A group of women students in Richmond' 'Wrote to us: It is essential that students be given a choice or all female housing. We regard this not as a privilege but as a right, since many of us feel that all female housing is necessary for our privacy. The most frequently mentioned reasons for preferring all women residence hall were privacy, quiet, and fe'il'er distractions which made for a better environment in which to study. ..Also, students said single sex living minimizes unwanted socializing. In the w4lr:ds of one sophomore woman: We like living in Richmond b~use we can study in our rooms. It's quiet here ... most people keep their doors closed and you don't have to leave the dorm if you want to study. If we want to party or socialize we can go to the fraternities or the other :tiorms. 5 Report on Residence Life, llJ86.

h p May 9, 1991 RE!i:IDEI\ITIAL LIFE CDMMilTEE REPORT <!tonrnrnirnsis 2s The Committee did not fmd the same benefits for the men's residence hall or men's floors in coed buildingS. In comparison to both the women's d()rm and coed. floors, all-male housing is generally dirty, noisy and sometimes rowdy. In. a survey of admissions st_aff and gatekeepers we heard strong opposition to the Middle States all-coed housmg proposal. Again and again we were urged to give students a choice, to ''keep the options\ ·• to retain one dorm for women and one for men. We were told that most applicants react favorably to Union's c~rrent ch.oice of living arrange~ents ·· single sex, coed by floor, and coed by room (l.e., men m one room, women m the next), and Greek versus independent. We ~~re convinced that the availability of s~gle sex housing, not just single sex floors, 1s rmportant to the parents of some foreign students,. and that the failure to previde this kind of living arrangement may discourage them from sending thek daughters and sons to Union. One ,professor wrote us to urge that we consider the principle of diversity; he cautioned against the College imposing on its students a \sin vision\ of what it deems best. While we support the retention of some single-sex housing in order to preserve the right of students to choose with whom they live, the Committee beli~ves that priority in future housing policies should be given to coed living. While the research concerning the impact of coed living is unclear, 6 we note that the great majority of colleges and universities which have examined residential life have cencluded that coed living fosters better relations between men and women. Even the majority ·of Union students surveyed (N =289) share this belief. In the words of one student who moved to a coed dorm after being in an all male dorm his freshman year: I can talk to girls more openly now .. .I can talk to them as easily as I can talk to guys. In living with girls you learn a lot about how girls think and act. They don't seem so strange to me anymore. Someday I'll get married and having lived with women before will make it easier for me to relate to my wife. A 1986 study of Union's residence life found that 94% of men and 90% of women responding to a survey preferred new housing on campus tp be coed. 7 The Committee is fully aware that there are some costs to coed living. Coed dorms are invariably noisier and more social than women's dorms. This is a typical comment about the coed floors: It's very hard to get work done here. There's too much noise, I just can't read here. I can't concentrate here. I really need quiet to do my work so I go to the library or the College Center to study. An anthropologist who spent two years living in dorms at. Rutgers University found that women, in order to be treated as near equals in coed dorms, must act like men. Women move more in the direction of older male gender patterns than men move toward older female patterns. 8 While these may be problems for our current student population, they are likely to lessen over time, as long as the gender relations between young men and women continue to change ana mature. Recommendation: The College should offer a diversity of living arrangements and should guarantee students freedom to choose the arrangement they desire, provided it doesn't result in racial or religious discrimination or segregation. Recommendation: We recommend that the College's housing policies give priority to coed living arrangements. However, we also recommend our current single sex r~idence halls (Richmond for women and South for men) be retained as long as there is student demand for them. VI. Equitable Treatment of Students in College Housing Union does not .treat students living in College-owned'housing equally. Current policies discriminate against those who are not affiliated with a Greek organization and against women. Perhaps the most shocking finding of our investigation into residential life was the enormous disparity in the privileges enjoyed by some segments of the campus community and denied to others, with the main beneficiaries being members of Greek organizations, see Table 1. We believe that inequities between Greeks and Independents influence the daily lives of students and their perception and understanding of what the college values. Table 1 Inequities Between Greeks and Independents Most Greeks eat downstairs from where they live Most Greeks have control over their meals and pay significantly less for them Most Greeks have 24 hour access to cooking facilities Greeks have large lounges, dining rooms, and commercial grad~ kitchens Greeks have more autonomy; they do not have to pass through a house desk check point at night Independents eat at central facilities outside of their hall Independents have little autonomy and must choose from a limited number of meal plans for which they pay more Most independents do not have access (only residents of Richmond, North, Webster, and Hickok have kitchenettes Independents have much smaller lounges, no dining rooms or commercial-grade kitchens Independents have less autonomy; most must show an ID to enter Fox, Davidson, West, Richmond and North from 10:00 PM to 7:00AM 6 In a review of the residence life literature, Blimling (1988) found no clear support for hypotheses that coed residence halls influence personal growth and development, academic performance, participation in extracurricular activities. He speculates that what benefits of coed living have been found may be the result of more gifted students self selecting themselves into a coed environment, and that more research is needed (1988:39). 7 The 1986 Report on Residence Life of the Student Affairs Council. 8 M. Moffatt, Coming of Age in New Jersey, p. 47. Greek men are able to have parties with alcohol Greek behavior in house is not monitored by College on daily basis Greeks have separate entry ways for members Independents follow the same policies but do not have access to the same facilities to hold parties in Independents behavior is monitored on daily basis by RA's and area coordinators Independents share with other building residents The following, an incident that occurred in Davidson on a Saturday nigh.t when 8 to 10 students were having a having a party in their rooms, exemplifies one of many inequities in privilege: The students are drinking whiskey sours and the music is loud. The RA of the floor arrives, very agitated. (he had recently been reprimanded by the residence hall director for a previous dorm party). He announces to everyone, \Get those drinks the hell out of my sight and all of you who don't live on this floor leave or I'm going to call Security. You can't have parties on this floor or I'm going to be shit.\ Meanwhile, elsewhere on campus, in several fraternities, students are playing loud music and drinking liberally without supervision. We were disappointed to discover that, though these inequities have been noted by a number of committees over the years, little has been done to correct them. In 1979, for example, the Committee on Student Life recommended that \all housing policies should apply to all residents in College-owned buildings.\ Members of our Committee expressed considerable concern over the unwillingness of the College to apply the same standards to Greeks that it applies to independents. Recommendation: One common set of rules should govern all students in College housing, whether they be Greek or independent. These rules refer to decoration, damage, alcohol use, fire drills and security. VII. College Housing Policy: Greek Organizations The Committee believes that freedom to live together with fraternity brothers or sorority sisters is appropriate as long as it does not create problems for its members Dr the larger community, and as long as these organizations foster values that are consistent with the mission of the College. While we believe it is appropriate that Greek organizations be permitted to occupy college housing, we do not believe they--being exclusive groups--should have priority in the assignment of college housing (we will return to this point in Section VIII). Given the diverse backgrounds and affiliations of our committee, we were often divided in our assessments of Greek organizations. To describe all the shadings would not be particularly useful. But it may be useful to set forth the matters on which we found ourselves in general agreement. We agreed that Greek organizations have considerable potential as student-run organizations. They depend on self governance and therefore provide opportunities for their student members to develop leadership skills, as well as fiscal and managerial responsibility. Their members work and raise funds for charities and social causes ~u~h as B.ig ~roth~rs, ~ig Sisters. They require shared responsibility for common ' livmg which 18 qwte different from the independence of the residence halls. The bonds that develo!l between members of a Greek organization are generally closer and more supportive than those found in residence halls where the population changes every year. Students in Anthropology 10 who were living in dorms or off campus ~ere as~ed to .study a fraternity or a sorority. In general they came back rr_om the~ expenence ~pre~d with t~~ comraderie .S?d strong bonds among 'bro~h~rs and am~ng sisters. Fratermtles and sorontles are quite good at proVIding f~llowsh1p and a support system for their members. A psychologist in the counseling center, for example, told us he has fewer worries sending a troubled student ba~k to his fraternity than an independent student back to the dorms. \In the fratermty,, y~u know his brothers are going to look after him, but in the dorms there usually ISn t much of a support group.\ Bonds between students in Greek or~zation~ often become lifelong friendships. At other colleges these same positive attributes can also be found in co-ed Greek organizations. . . . Fr~ternities _are the College organizations that provide campus-wide parties and a. social fo~us ~or all students. Although Greek organizations do not provide the kind.of social life that most faculty and staff would like to see encouraged, most Uruon students support them as the primary providers of campus social life. In t~e war~ of one student~ \We're the ones who live here; it's not the faculty. Until there lS some alternative to the social life the fraternities provide, you shouldn't take them away.\ This dominance of social life can be viewed as ~erently discriminatory, however, since from the perspective of women students It creates a dependency on men for entertainment. n . The Committee found evidence and heard considerable testimony that Uruon's fraternities have a negative influence on campus social life and student attitudes. In the minds of many faculty and some students fraternities are associat?d with anti-intellectual and anti-sodal values. Th~ir very existence undermmes the ~ducatio?al mission of the College, denying women students equal acce~ t() cho1ce ~ousmg and the other benefits that go along with fraternity membershi~, lll!der. Umon's pr~sell:t system. Fraternities are also regarded by many to be mstitutions that objectify and belittle women and foster sexism. Women students report frequent verbal harassment and occasionally worse at fraternity parties. One woman student who speaks for many wrote: G~eek organizations definitely lead to a division between the sexes. My friends at other schools have many more close friends and closer ~elationships with me~~rs of ~h~ ~pposite se;c- I think because people live m clo~ knit groups • livmg, soc1alizmg, attending meetings . with members of thetr own sex exclusively, they don't have to reach out to the other sex to gain a better understanding. · The Committee heard testimony from admissions staff that the large number of fraternities at Union and their significant influence on the College's social life discourage some women from conling to Union College. We also heard from our faculty that a number of students, men as well as women, have left Union because of the undue influence of Greeks on campus life. The 1989 study of coeducation at Union noted that a majority of the nation's college students today are women and that Union will need, in a shrinking applicant pool, to attract strong women students in the futw-e. 9 Some faculty expressed serious concern over the influence of Greeks on the way Union is portrayed in national guides to colleges and universities. For example, one professor wrote: ·'

RE!iiDEI\ITIAL LIFE CO;MMITTEE REPORT May 9, 1991 Union is perceived es a close chum of the old time. old boy's men's college it was with its strong Greek tradition and separate, privileged housing arrangements. We should do everything we can to bury this \boys and beer\ image... Our co-edacational achievements are not jllSt overlooked ... b-ut are often undercut by the dominating presence of preferential male housing at Union. Fraternity men are also harmed if they are led to believe th.at they are more important than women an<! more entitled to privilege. Voicing a commonly held view, a senior faculty mern9er observed: Since I came here in the early 70's, people have talked about fraternities and abo-ut the problems of excessive drinking. The college has done virtually n.othing about fraternities because no one has the balls to deal with ti:J.em. It's because fraternities are an established power base--they ltave influence on the board, they're heavy givers, and they'll make afuss if you take way their privileges. This professor, like many other members of the Union comnnmity that we spoke to, believes that the solu tioa is not to ban fraternities, but to rein them in and make them clearly accountable for their actions. Because fratermties are currently the only places on campus where alcohol is served at large gatherings, they are associated with excessive drinking and with occasional vandalism and. abuse to women. Much of the offensive behavior associated with Greeks way be related to their houses being the venues for parties where free beer leads to dru.nkenness. If similar parties ()Ccurred in the dorms, similar abuses might folloV\V. The elimination of the double standard, which. now means that the only venues for parties with alcohol are in fraternities, along with other measures outlined in this report, may eliminate many of the problems now associated with fraternities. Recommendation: The College should permit Greek organizations to apply for the privilege of living together in College-owned housing, as long as they contribute to the mission of the College and are held accountable for their lleb.avior. Recommendatio:n: .Fraternities and sororities should be encouraged to make their housing f.acilities more accessible to the larger College community. Offering m.e.al plans to independents and operating a snack bar (during the evening and on weekends) are two possibilities. Recommendation: Fraternities and sororities should be encouraged to host one or two intEr-national students each year. This would provide a service to both our international students and the Greeks themselves. (Housing some of our international students in fraternities and sororities W()uld help to break down our cuzr~mt isolation of international students in Ludlow and Webster; it would put thew in a setting where they are more likely to have an \American experience,\ which in most cases is their motivation for coming t() the United States, and to Union, in the first place. Second, their presence wo-uld help internationalize, albeit in a small way, our Greek organizations. Our prim!UY motivation in inviting students from abroad is to \internationalize\ the campus, but under the present system cnly independents, and only in a few select residence halls, have much contact with our international students. Unless some of t:hese students are housed in fraternities and sororities, their members will have little opportunity to become acqtiainted with international students.) Other recommendations C{)ncerning Greek housing are contained in Sections VI and VIII. VIII. College Housing Policy: Inclusive Groups While recognizing tlu value of single-sex housing {Chapter VI) and tb.e role of Greek life in the College (Chapter VII), the Committee urges the College to develop new housing policies which will give priority to inclusive membership, coed housing groups. An inclashe-membership group is one which meets these criteria: 1. any student is welcome to join, regardless of gender, race, ethnicity, creed, ideology, sexual preference, or financial ability; and 2. membership rules are not discriminatory. (Groups th.at exclude students on any basis, such as gender, are exclusive-membership gr<laps.) We believe inclusive grou}ls to be valuable an.d necessary alternatives to Greek organizations and to unaffiliated living, eith.er in residence halls or in off earnpus apartments. Giving priority in housing to inclusive groups will mean that fraternity and sorority housing will be at risk. That is, some Greek organizations are likely to lose their current housing to inclusive groups. However, Greeks do have the option of becoming \inclusive\ groups themsel-ves, by admitting members of the <lpposite sex. Th.e Union commllllity aa a whole should be made aware that the Ccllege owns both the residence :halls and all but four of the fraternity-occupied buildings on cam}Jus. Moreover, leases for the land on which t?e f()~ remaining b~dings sit will expire during the next several decades, at which p<>rnt the land willl'eve.rt to the College. Thus, follovving the recommendations of t:bis report, at some pomt in the near future the DeDI of Students Office will have at its disposal College- owned fraternity buildings and theme houses, upgraded residence halls, an.d newly- constructed townhouse apartments. This constitutes a pool of housing whic::h is available, by application, t() all student members of the college community. In developing procecluzes for the allocation of housing campus~ wide ti:J.e Committee believes that tbe College should favor diverse. inclusive, coed groups, which pr()vide a service t() th.e college community at large. Groups ~ay ~ange in size from small blocks of friends who seek adjacent rooms to fratermty-s1zed communities of thirty and :more. The Committee explicitly encourag.es the formation of mixed class th.eme houses. A mixed class theme house IS a coed group of students, from second t() f()urth year, whose bond is usually ~rovided by . residence in the house rather than by previous club membership, and who Wish to cooperate with neighbors t<J pursue a common interest or program .of activit~es. Each \house\ should have m theme (e.g., language, cultural, academic or semce) and receive college support t() pursue that theme. On wwe campuses these houses include dining coops or \eating clubs.\ Each such house sb()uld occupy a residence hall, or a wing, division, or floor of a residence hall. Each slmuld be governed by its residents, with access t() special college funding for activitie-s relating to its theme or l?urpose. Eac? should be . assigned the use of a loung-e and a kitchen where available. We w1sh to ernp~astze the importance of having a kitchen as it will make. th:se groups. more a.ttractlve to students. The selection of students should give prwnty to preVIous residents, b~t otherwise the selection pl'Qicess should insure that each house is coed and contruns a mix of classes. 9 Report of the Committee on Coeducation, 1989. Clearly, given the Committee's recommendations, the development of a commonly held set of criteria for the allocation of college housing is crucial to the successful implementation of a new housing policy. {Our primary reason for circulating this preliminary draft is to encourage broad discusston of what these criteria must he.) Recommendation: The C()llege should pe~t student-organized social or special-interest groups to apply for the privilege of living together in College housing. In order to be accountable to the College such groups should reapply for group housing every other year. Recommendation: Applications for group housing in all College- owned buildings shouid be evaluated by the Dean for Residence Life in conswtation with a standing subcommittee of the Student Affairs CoUllcil. When evaluating and ranking applications for group housing, the coUege should determine whether each group bas an inclusive or exclusive membership policy. 10 Priority should be assigned to the applications according to the f()llowing criteria: inclusiveness, diversity, pmsuit of a common interest or program of activities in accord with the College•s mission, and service to the College community. Recommendation: Each student, after the freshman year, should be free to select hlsfher (same-sex) roommate and free to form a small block of friends (of the same sex or ~oed) who seek housing in adjacent rooms of a residence hall. The College should limit the size of these housing blocks, however, to no more than six students of the srune sex, or eight students in a coed block. 10 0ur recommendation for addressing the problems of inequity in campus housing--by giving priority in housing to \inclusive groups\-·was borrowed from Kenyon College. See Kenyon's Report of the Commission on Student Life, p.16. Appendix! Postponing Rush Until the Sophomore Year The Committee discussed a proposal to postpone rush until the beginning of the s~phomore year. The idea was strongly supported by several members of the committee, and equally opposed by others; several Committee members favored the idea in principle but felt that the problems of its implementation would divert attention away from the central concerns of our study. Nonetheless, the Committee agreed to allow the sup}Jorters of the proposal to append to this draft of the report the argument for sophomore rush. The proponents of delaying rush until the sophomore year believe it will encourage a stronger identification of freshmen with their own class. It will mean that freshmen will be together for the entire year, whereas now many are siphoaed <lff into fraternities and sororities. Other colleges have found that once freshmen enter Greek organizations, they tend to :participate less in other campus activities, as much of their time is taken up by Greek activities. Postponing rush until the Sophomore year is also likely to result in more juniors and seniors being actively involved and living in their houses. We believe this is in the best interests of both these organizations and of the larger campus community since seniors are likely t[) have a positive influence on fraternity behavior. Postponing rush will also mean that Union students, by not moving into fraternities and sororities until their Junior year, will spend an extra year in the more heterogenous environment of the residence halls.

Ted Corrigan sailed on the \airwaves\ as he cleared his seasonal best of 6'3\. in the high jump. Rich Pulver \connected\ with the shot and finished in fifth place. His put of 44'6\ was not far off his best. Greg Barrett also had an impresssive day as he used his \spare\ to come up with a seasonal best of 2:05.5 in the 800m. Pete \eh-heenh\ Protzell put up his usual excellence in the 400m with a 54.5. Will Allen was a mere .06 seconds off his PR in the 400m. His 51.2 brought him in second place for his heat. Bob Linyberg also RPI 7 put up an impressive time in the 800m. His 1:59.1 was only 0.4 seconds slower than his recent PR. Ed \Dog·Horse\ Dorsey was t:he last of the competing Dutchmen. He came up big in the 1500m with a time of 4:32.2. Despite having to travel \ ... here, there and there ... \ for dinner. the Tracksters had an excellent day overall. Many marks were the best or second best of the season. They have chosen to sacrifice the lobster dinners of parents' weekend to strut their stuff at States.

.. ! ' l 1 May 9, 1991 !iPORT!i Union Stickmeri End Outstanding Se:ason at 10-3 By DAN STRUM and Sparts Information The 1991 Men's Lacrosse Team faced off against Hartwick in the opening-round of the ECAC playoffs. They lost 9-8 in a thrilling overtime contest. This put an end to an outstanding season which the Dutchmen put up a 10-3 record. For their efforts this season, the Men's Lacrosse team has been selected as Concordiensis Sports Athletes Of The Week. The overtime loss was a tough way to end the season. \It was an unbelievably great game,\ said fourth-year head coach Chuck Priore, who has guided the Dutchmen to an overall record of 33-21 and three consecutive berths in the ECAC playoffs. \It was a super season ... I know we can pick up where we left off next season.\ Two of the three losses the Dutchmen received this season came at the hands of nationa:lly-ranked teams in Hartwick and Williams. They were trying to equal the all- time record number of wins in a season with 11 but they fell --~~-­ Coach Chuck Priore just short. The 1991 Lacrosse team is graduating seven seniors who re worthy of re..-:ognition. All- American candid 1te Jon Keller has been at the core of Union's program. He is a four-time leading scorer and has notched 238 points over his illustrious career. In addition, he is a two- time All-American honorable mention. Attackman Alan Fleischer ends his career with 38 points. Midfielders Scott Daniels and Dennis Baldwin finish up with 18 and 20 points respectively. Jon Garguilo and Pat Lawson have been two of the anchors on Union's defensive squad. Their leadership will be missed. Finally, goalie Brian Lucey ends his career with an 8-2 record this season and an 11-4 record overall. Next year the Dutchmen have several talents who will look to step up with the loss of these fine individuals. However, this year's squad put forth an. effort which is rather commendable. Once again, congratulations to the 1991 Men's Lacrosse team, Concordiensis Sports Athletes Of The week! 1991 UNION COLLEGE MEN'S LACROSSE STATISTICS FINAL 1} Name John Keller*** Nate Fitch* Tim Fisher* Alan Fleischer*** Scott Daniels*** Dennis Baldwin** John Bang Gene Ray** Pat Lawson*** Bill Winship** Cort Boulang-er Ted Sidel John Wehrum** Chuck·Mamone* Mike Richardson** Robert Kraft* Brian Harris Dennis Foley Mike Cassidy Dave Donaldson Damon Keller Scott Whitney Goalies Yr.

This past weekend brought one of them. Alpha Epsilon Pi successfully held their second annual Frisbee For_ the Homeless Tournament. Many thanks to Matt Kaslyn, David Kobl and Mal Poret for ·making this event possible. Eacb team donated a sum of thirty dollars to enter the tournament~ which amounted ~to a totaL.of four hundred · dollars. This money was given · · to the local city mission to help the homeless in the area. In addition, many other sponsors helped the event to succeed. Lee's Trophies and Plaques donated the seven trophies awarded to the winners. Northern Distributing Company donated all of the bottled water that was available during the games. Many other places donated gift certificates used as prizes. The turnout was excellent-- both in participation and observation. Eight fraternities particiJ,>ated-- Alpha Epsilon Pi, Sigma Chi, Chi Psi, S_igma Phi,Theta Delta Chi, Kappa Sigma, Fiji and Delta Upsilon. Of the four sororities on campus, three participated, Sigma Delta Tau. Gamma Phi Beta and Tri-Delta. In the local games, Delta Upsilon beat Fiji in the men's championship game. Gamma Phi Beta won the three-team round robin in the women's division. All in all, it was a fun way to spend a beautiful Saturday afternoon . The brothers of Alpha Epislon Pi would like to thank ·oean Mammola's office, and everyone else who helped make their event such a success. C!rnlllllrbirnzf.n 31 NHL Update By DAN STRUM Sports Editor Hockey is an interesting sport containing many facets. Teams toil over an 8()~game season, going through numerous streaks, enduring countless injuries, with the same goal of making a bid for ·Lord Stanley's most cherished prize. However, once the playoffs roll around, each team displays different colors. The : , Edmonton Oilers, after being seeded third in the Smythe Division, came back to capture the division title with some impressive wins over the : . Calgary Flames and tile Los · Angeles Kings. The defending Stanley Cup Champion~ know how to turn it up a notcll once April and May come around .. Many fans could see the myriad of banners ruffling in the wind at Northlands Coliseum. As of late these gusts have turned into mere zephyrs. The Minnesota North Stars are directly responsible. The Stars, continuing their improbable playoff run, have taken a 2-1 game lead over the Oilers. Back in February. the Met Center contained sparse crowds made up of true Nortll Star fans, the same kind of fan who may aimlessly follow their team, perched from the blues, even if they haven't won a Stanley Cup for 51 years. The outlook for the team's future was, to be polite, bleak. In May, the atmosphere has changed ever so subtly. The North Stars are currently 18-2- 2 in their last 22 home games. The Met Center has been revived with an electric atmosphere which has ()pened the eyes of all sports fans around the nation. Sbayne Churla has become a household name ... well I wouldn't go that far, yet. This past Monday night the place was shaking as Minnesota beat Edmonton, 7- 3. The entire city ha~ been transformed into North Star fans. You have to love a team which takes on the number one and two teams in the NHL, and beats them both. Now tlley are in the process of dethroning the current champions. How far will their momentum carry them??!! It all comes down to clutch play and emotion. The Stars have won 10 games so far in the playoffs. I think that is more than Quebec had all season. Ma11y of theit younger players have caught .fire while the older players add leadership to provide the necessary stability come playoff time. Veterans like Brian Bel'lows and Neal Broten have led the team on their quest while goaltender John Casey has made enough spectacular saves to make a highlight tape three times over. The North Star players believe that they can take on any team and win. With the reinforcing support of their vociferous fans, the Stars have ridden an emotional high which has carried them this far. On the other side of the draw, the Boston Bruins are matched up against the Pittsburgh Penguins. This was a more likely matchup as both number one seeds have advanced. Boston had jumped out to a 2-0 series lead before Pittsburgh stormed back at home with an impressive 4-1 win. This cut the series lead to 2-1. Many people wonder whether the Penguins' high powered offense can hold up against the Bruins' tough checking style of play. In this series, home ice has proved to be an extremely important factor. In the Bruins' backyard. a rink which is one of the smallest in the league, Boston is able to frustrate and wear down their opponents with physical play. In the Igloo, a ratl:ler large rink with vast amounts of open ice, the Penguins are best able to utilize the talents of Mario Lemieux and Mark Recchi who thrive on the wide open style of play. It is difficult to determine who will be left alone, parading around with the Cup. Will it be the explosiveness of Pittsburgh, the perseverance of Boston, the experience of Edmonton, or the emotion of Minnesota? With the almost magical characteristics already present, it looks like it might be Minnesota over Boston in seven! Big Brother I Big Sister Informational meeting Tonight! Thursday, May 9 at 8 pm.

Union Baseball finishes at 10-13 Parsons Defends State Championship at New York State Meet By SANDRA ANSELMENT The women's track team brought home a plethora of medals from the New York State meet this past weekend. One of the many medal winners was senior co-captain Meg Parsons. Parsons, who was Indoor State Champion in the 800m run, protected her title by winning the 800m run in a very fast time of 2:18.8. This was Parsons last state meet of her college career and we would like to wish her good luck as she goes on to compete in ECAC's this weekend and also attempts to qualify for Nationals. Outstanding performances were contributed by many other mem hers of the team as well. Beginning with the sprints, junior Denise Saunders burned up the track and her competitors in the 1OOm dash to place third overall with a time of 13.03. This 3rd place finish moves Saunders up two spots from her indoor finish of 5th place. The Union squad ran three competitors in the 400m run. Sophomore Tasha LaBare held her own among the tough competition to finish 3rd overall in a time of 60.3. Senior Clare \Mrs. Megathlin\ also competing in her last state meet, ran a strong, smart race finishing with a time of 64.6. She has been shaving down her times all season and will aim for a personal goal time at the Union Classic. Come on out and cheer her on! Sophomore Joy Grillon, competing in her first state meet ever, ran an outstanding 400m finishing with a time of 65 .3. Junior Rika Poor, a newcomer to the 400m hurdles, but not a newcomer to the track, ran a fabulous time of 1 :07, but missed placing by tenths of a second. Sandra Anselment ran amongst a tough field in the 1500m run and also missed placing. The relays, however, brought great rewards to the team. The 4X100m relay team of Saunders, Poor, Parsons, and LaBare not only placed 3rd, but also set a new school record with a time of 50.77. This relay team is one to keep your eyes on because if they get those hand-offs down, look out, they will be on their way to Nationals! The 4X400m relay team consisting of, yes, the same four runners, also captured 3rd in 4:06.6 In the field events, Union captured its second gold medal. However, it wasn't really a medal, but rather a carnation. Junior Alix \Taz\ Goldschmidt captured 1st place in the hammer throw with a toss of 38.84m. This event, however, is an exhibition event at the state meet, and scores no points. Sophomore Lori Simkins captured 6th place in the hammer with a throw of 29.42m. Hopefully, next year these places will count! Union was awarded points, though, in the shot put and javelin for outstanding throws by Goldschmidt. Alix placed 2nd in both events with throws of 11.09m and 34.46m respectively. Simkins just missed placing in the discus, but she did set a new school record with an outstanding hurl of 33.16m. The Union team placed 6th overall in the meet out of a field of 13 teams. The team would especially like to thank assistant coach Jen \Fajita\ Lee for all her advice, confidence, patience, support and driving ability! We couldn't have done it without her. up port May 9, 1991 Softball Seeded· First In State Championships By RON BIRNBAUM Wow! It has been a season of firsts for the women's varsity softball team. Not only did the team defeat SUNY- Albany for the second time this season on Monday, April 29 (a first), but with the same victory it recorded its 13th win, another school record. To top things off, after sweeping Russel Sage at home in a double-header this past Saturday, Union secured a place for itself in playoffs as well as the # 1 seed, another first. Their record before the last game, against North Adams, is 15-4. The Dutchwomen faced Russel Sage at home and in the first game, with the opponent up by one run after the top of the first, the tide turned fast. Kathy Lawliss, Dawn Harrington and Robin Romer hit three quick singles and Romer, Kim Twombly, and senior third baseman co-captain Teresa Sanchez responded with RBis. Twombly, Romer and Harrington all scored again in the third. These same three scored again in the fifth with Union settling into a pattern of three runs every odd inning and three quick outs in the even innnings. Also in the fifth, Brenda March drove in three runs. With the score 6-1 Union, after the third, Sage began a comeback attempt in the fourth with a run on an error and a wild pitch and two more in the sixth on a fielders's choice and an error, but could add no more and fell to the Dutchwomen, 9-4. In Game #2, the guests led Union after the f:rrst by a 1-0 score. but Union tied it up in the second after Sanchez walked and was later brought home with a walk. Marsh was on third for the go-ahead run this , inning when the final out was made. Sage led again after the top of the third with two more runs, only one of which was earned. Not to worry, however. since Union came back in the bottom of the third with four earned runs from Harrington, Romer, Sanchez and Marsh and two earned in the fouth from Lawliss and Romer. In the sixth, Sage came back with three runs, two earned, almost going through the entire order. With its lead threatened by the close 7-6 score, Union needed to pull ahead and it did with five more runs to double the guests' score, 12-6. Sage was left stunned after a short seventh half-inning. Team member co-captain Roselle Eisma said of the Sage games, \There was a lot of hitting from everyone, pretty much the whole lineup. The balls were all over the place,\ referring to the fact that the game was more based on hits than SACs and errors. \We swept these two, but they're up a game, so it was a big advantage to win these games for seatings,'' stated head coach Suzanne Zaloom. The North Adams game to be played this past Monday was looked forward to in a more relaxed manner, in preparation for post-season, and to give subs game playing time. Celebrating the team effort that has gotten the squad thus far, freshman outfielder Chris Weske commented, \It's great. We've managed to beat some tough teams and our hitting came around really well, a big key. Defense did well, but people hit the ball when we really needed it, and we played well under pressure. I'm very excited for the upcoming weekend\ Of extreme importance is junior Sarah Dudzic, wlto has been the pitcher for all 19 seasonal games. She bas an ERA under two and wolis very well with Romer, the catcher. One more plus is coach Zaloom's game approacll with. the fundamentals of base running, bunting, and stealing. Stated assistant coach George Cuttita, \The top of the order is excellent, the· middle: of the order has timely hitting, and power. Put all of that t()gether and you've got a winning team.\ Of final importance is the leadersship of team captains, including Lawliss, Eisma, Sanchez, and Dudzic, wbo have pulled a team from a 0-7 record in Florida exhibition games to a winning one. \We've gotten consistent pitching from Sarah and our defense is playing good, solid, confident ball, and we're running when we get on base. We're looking to cap a great year with the: state championships. The championship is presently the issue on mind. As Union is ranked first, it will play the eighth ranked team, Binghatmon. If it wins, it will play another team from the winner's bracket in this single elimination tourney on Saturday. If not, it will enter into the consolation bracket. All teams entering are good teams with a .650+ record, similar to Union. This will be the Dutchwomen's sixth trip to states since the start ()f the program, the highest se.ed· ever for Union. Winning the state championship would be a first ever for Union, its llighest previous finish being tltird in 1985. Regardless of results in the tournament, however, Zaloom sums up by saying, \The key is to not defeat ourselves.\ nton ports

I \ 2 <Uvnrorbirnsis 1\JEW!i AI\IAL Y!il!i The State Of The Union By JIM POLITES Associate News Editor The recent tur!J1oil on Union's campus, a direct result of Professor Kit Hathaway's unceremonious dismissal, is now slowly fading into a fond memory of students rallying for an estrange;d teacher. Though President Hull has suggested we leave this incident behind us all; not everyone is simply going to allow this issue simple passage into a benign foregone conclusion. Granted, Professor Hathaway will be leaving the school come June-he has rejected an offer to stay on board a divided ship for another year and has no intention of court action against Union. The end seems definitive and debate, even conjecture, would be a practice in futility. Well, although this column has always examined issues on a national and international scope, this week's focus will be narrowed to the Union community and the plight of Kit Hathaway. Call it .a desire to give the un<lerdog his fair due. Maybe it's that I'd like to keep the flicker ().:f llope going. Probably most !Lppropriate'ly, though, I think 1tlle guy got a raw deal and he deserved much better. Though Presid~nt Hull has suggested we leave this incident ,b ellind us all; not ever:y()o_e is simply going t() al'low this issue simJlle passage into a benig11 forgone conclusion. This article has a. foundation in past weeks U>pics: integrity, manipulation of p()wer, unfair treatment, and fillally the need for new blood. This com- bination can all i11 one way or another be translated in to terms we witnessed :ri£ht here on campus. The clirn~x, of course, lies in that a tbree-pronged clash between students, faculty, and administrator.<~ ensued and most disturbingly left a myriad of questions unanswered. The facts that have been readily publicized seem clear indeed. First of all, Hathaway asked for a review of his case months ago and never even got a response. It's impossible for this writer to perceive how this couldn't be construed as a plain slap in the face. Aside from the common courtesy that would have accompanied a quick response, Hathaway's position of status as an associate professor was made a mockery. A governing few deemed this man expendable and passed judgement that a majority of others would think the same. His integrity, and contributions to the school for that matter, was heavily questioned and that in itself was defaming enough. At the same time, President Hull lashed out at an English Department that backed Hatha- way almost un~nimously. He again questioned the integrity not of nine students, but of his own faculty. Hull was livid that Chairman Heinegg resorted to the surrounding New York press for exposure, but, well in plain terms, good for him. Heinegg, as well as Hathaway, did not succumb to the President's exertion of verbal power. One must stHl wander, though, what exactly the motives of our esteemed President were. A,:; a leader of the Union College community, President Hull lashed out at an English Department that backed Hathaway unanimously. He questions the integrity , not of nine students, but of his own faculty. his first responsibility should be to lead by example. To say that the English Department does not warrant the respect of say the Engineering or Political Science faculty is absolutely absurd. There is one common body of professors here at Union, not a hierarchical structure that weighs teaching material differently. If nothing else, this trying episode and disturbing chapter here can serve to remind all of us that though we are fenced off from many of the realities of that brutal world out there, some of the tactics and characteristics do whirl around the Nott Memorial today. As much as we all would like to think that the bureaucratic power at Union is only a symbolic entity that we attempt to poke through over four years of college, we all know better. What we encounter is actually a microcosm of nearly every structure that runs effectively in the world today. Some tactics are warranted, and even accepted. But what happens more often than not, is that anJndividual or party is slighted in some way, and victims are left on the outside looking in. Kit Hathaway will leave this institution with a great following, probably in much better spirits than he came. He leaves a system that was questioned and stained, yet he still rides off with dignity, promise and the knowledge that many found his cause worthy. Unlike Hathaway, President Hull will return next fall to resume his position at Union College. By then, this whole issue will have filtered out of campus activity and been laid to rest; our Chief Executive will be rid of the stigma attached to his inefficiency, and harmony will reign again. Allow Hathaway his due of a proper swansong here, Mr. President. He's already coming way out on top of this episode anyway. Budget Inefficiency Sparks Concern By MICHAEL and THOMAS RIZZO Ahh, Spring is here. The birds are chirping and the air is warm and friendly. Oh no. what is that in the eastern sky? Dark, menacing clouds have appeared just to the east of our lovely campus. They don't appear to be approaching, but I feel a sense of dread as I look at the darkness. Wait a minute, I think I know where those clouds are forming. Yes, they are over Albany and centered right above our budget crisis. Sorry to be a little melodramatic, lJut the budget debacle is quite ominous this year. The state, 8!l you may or may not know, is facing a six billion dollar bud.,get gap. This problem is com(Jou.nded by the fact that for the se:venth year in a row, we do notha-ve a budget by the April 1 d~dline. So, you ask the m.ost basic question, what doos this mean to me, a student llt a private New York State University? What it means is financial aid cuts and greater mes. The New York based Regents Scholarship was The New York based Regent's scholarship was tossed aside in order to close some of the gap in the budget. tossed aside in the budget process in order to close some of the gap in the deficit. What I am happy to say is that the Abcrn tne. order cJ succeson- if somethtns hapP.enb to Bush, a.m I beBore or att€r Fer;gie ?,,, assemblywoman that I am interning for, Cathy Nolan (D- Westem Queens), put in a bill to reinstate the Regent Scholarship. However, this bill met some stiff resistance and was eventually defeated. Now, a Regent Scholarship only amounts to $250 a year for four years if the New York State resident goes to college in New York. $250 is really not a lot of money, but it does pay for books, or a month or two of rent, or some other vital part of college life. A more lucrative ~d more difficult to attain scholarship program, the $3,000 Empire State Scholarship, is also slated for elimination this year. This will lead to a shift of the burden from the state to local colleges. Inevitably the colleges will have to face a choice, to raise tuition or slash financial aid, neither of which is a desirable option. Basically, by passing a last minute budget with these substantial cuts the state government is hindering the opportunities for people to gain higher education in New York State. ATTENTION.

Now that spring has arrived, countless numbers ()f Uni()n students flock to West Beach-on sunny afternoons to work on their tans. Fashion designers are coming out with their new summer collections, while millions of Americans conform to these latest standards for society. All this talk made me wonder what kind of fashion statements arc being made for the summer in the Soviet Union. Fortunately I was able to ask my g()od buddy Andrcy who is from Moscow State Technical University to get the answers. Here is an unedited version of the conversation. Q. \Do men wear ripped . ?\ Jeans. A. \We arc not crazy!\ Q. \Do women sunbathe in bikinis?\ A. \Some do not wear tops at all...\ Q. \What kind of bathing suits do the men wear?\ A. \Men definitely wear bikini style swiRlsl:lits -- long boxers do not provide good tanning.\ Q. \So do guys wear their shorts shorter than the ones here?\ A. \Yes very short shorts.\ Q. \What kinds of shoes are most pcpular?\ A. \Lots of sneakers, but imported ones are too expensive.\ Q. \Do guys wear baseball type caps?\ A. \Yeah ... especially if they are baseball players.\ Q. \How about sunglasses?\ A. \Of course we wear them ... any kind, but Ray Ban are most impressive; they cost $150 here and the equivalent price in Russia is about l/8 the price of a car.\ Q. \What else is very popular?\ A. \Bandannas.

May 16, 1991 11\JTERI\IATI~OI\IAL FEATUJ«E!i Eye On Th·e orld y Ed Menke At this paint in time, all of us who have ev((n glmced at a newspaper in our lives know something about the Mandela family. Nelson, leader of the African National Congress, and his wife, Winnie, Wllo, I understand, does not have friends named Tigger, Eeyore, Kanga or Roo. (Although she might like honey) Not only do we know something about the family or the names, but we also have an idea of what they stand for as well. It's not easy to work against an entire government, especially one based on racial hatred and stupidity. In fact, Winnie just found out recently how hard thestruggle against the South African government and powers tllat be in and around Johannesburg. For just Monday, Winnie Mandela was convicted of kidnapping after a 14-week trial. According to the New York Times, Judge Michael S. Stegman took six and a half hours to e:xplain why Winnie was convicted of being an accessory after the fact to the assaults. According to the Judge, Winnie Mandela \ ... showed herself on a number of occasions to be a calm, composed, deliberate and unblushing I • II Jar. Maybe I'm too boo ked on L. A. Law to really understand what a legal system is like. Maybe I've seen too many Perry Mason movies to be able to comprehend how judges are supposed to hand down verdicts. Maybe I've watched Night Court too often to understand that not all judges are as funny as Harry. But come on. Winnie is, in this case, a victim of an imperfect system. When you have biased judges insulting the defendants, the system isn't working4 When people who have untouchable alibis are still convicted because of their race, se:x, religion, or family name, the system isn't working. When people of national importance ue being locked up just to prove a point, the system isn't working. The problem which remairis, however, is tha't Winnie's case is not the only case of \injust justice\ in South Africa. Also, South Africa isn't the unly country whose legal system needs a \check-up from the neck up,\ so to speak. All over the world, there are imperfect legal systems, and even in the most democratic of situations (see United Su,ttes). When I talk about the death penalty with my peers, they insist that tlle death penalty should only be used in a legal system witho11t flaws; you can't put some<Jne to death and hope that you're right, Joe Six-Pack would say. · But, the fact remains, people· like Winnie and Nelson and others will continue to be the immediate victims of an international epidemic of inept and deficient \justice~'. And, while we might not get locked up, we are the indirect victims of something which l<Joks good on parchment under six-inch catastrophe-proof glass, but something which is lacking in its application . Under the Russian Gun By LARAE TUMIDAJEWICZ In Part One of the adventure with Andrey and his infamous watergun toy I was trapped in my room without any hope for escape. Now I can update you on the water war situation, with the outcome being in my favor ... It was a beautiful day out on Friday afternoon; beautiful that is until Andrey decided to put a little of his \I was just having fun\ type humor into it. My friends and I had gotten Skellar take out food for dinner and were having a nice little picnic outside of Webster. Things were pretty normal except for a few minutes when some fraternity men tied a guy to a tree outside of Tri Delt. Then something odd happened. We were sitting in the sunniest spot on the grass, but we could feel raindrops. Water was getting all over the french fries; but it wasn't rain, it was the squirting water from Andrey's toy from his second floor window. One of my friends threatened him with pain if he did not stop. but he was safely inside and knew we had no means of revenge. But we had taken just about enough of this foolish behavior from our little buddy. Now it was our turn to play games with him. So each of us got containers full of water and decided to gang up on this Russian bully. Our donn is a square type of building plan and it has lots of little nooks and crannies for hiding in. At first we didn't do so good in battle, taking many blasts of the cold water. But after we took a few minutes to get our plan together, we were ready for anything. One of us was in the kitchen, one in the bathroom, one in the stairwell, and I was waiting in the closet. One by one we threw the water at him. He could not believe that we did this to him; he thought this game of his was going to be one-sided against us forever, but we proved him wrong. Well, now he was mad and much more determined in his pursuit of us to get even. Andrey ran downstairs to refill his gun for the final showdown. He did not realize that we, too, were preparing for the fight. My friend filled a large bucket fuU of ice cold water, and waited silently at the top of the stairs. As Andrey cautiously walked up, looking much like Don Johnson in a Miami Vice episode, we were ready for him. He aimed to shoot and was in complete amazement when Lhe bucket was dumped down on him from the balcony of the stairs. He stood there dazed and dripping wet. We watched laughing and then decided to run while we were ahead. Andrey was taught a lesson about what happens when you take a practical joke too far. And we all learned that there is strength in numbers. Andrey had his fun with his water gun that day, but for once the last laugh was on us ... it felt good.

FEAT·URE!i <lrllltfllrbirnsis 1 A Gathering Of Eagles By CARL R. FRIEDRICH, Jr. As I was led to my fate the other day, that above mentioned phrase, made famous around these parts by Professor Berk, rang in my ears like never before. You see I had a few minutes to kill before his class, and upon infmming my friend Josh of this, I was being led to one of those video-game type things. Even my excuse that I didn't have a quarter was to no avail-- Josh flipped one into the entertainment-droid for me. The game I was about to play sounded familiar,! think I had heard some football-types speaking of it once with marked reverence. It was called \Smash T.V.\ and there was no getting out of it now. Josh had hit the \2 contestant\ button. As the nondescript video warm-up music jingled out of the single speaker, I worriedly asked Josh what to do. \Move with the left, shoot with the right-- shoot everything.\ Well, that seemed easy enough. The game soon begun and computer bullets showered the screen. Not only was I unaware of who my \contestant\ was, but I also was trying to remember what \the left\ and \right\ did. Josh proved to be both a worthy player and quite a commentator. \Hal Take that!\ he would say, as a victim of his machine gun fire would ooze with blood and evaporate from existence. Occasionally he would laugh at my ineptness, but never long enough to fail to remind me of what I should be doing. Before I began to get the hang of it, the \first round\ was over. As Josh watched his bonus points ring up, he turned to my meagerness and said, \Ours is not to ask bow and why, ours is just to do or die!\ Yikes! Round Two s2w myself quickly eliminated. I just couldn't keep up with the speed and Josh's intimidating hip checks from time to time (I guess by hip checking me, his \contestant\ \\IBS able to live a moment or three longer). More startling than my departure from this game was the quick cut in made by someone standing behind me, who was all too eager to get in on the blood-and-guts world of \Smash T.V.\. (I still don't understand how the name of the game is associated with the course of play). I sauntered off by myself, feeling ashamed that I had not done my family name justice on the plains of computer warfare. On my way to class, I ran into none other than my larger- than-the-average-bear friend Brian, affectionately known to me as Bry. \Hey Bry, what's up?\ I said, a quite typical ACADEMIC AFFAIRS COUNCIL April 26, 1991 Meeting #22 MEMBERS PRESENT : Dean T. Weiner; Professors 8 Reynolds (Chair), G. Gmelch, S. Kellenter, N. Mazur, R. Olberg, K. Zimmermann.; Student T. Fallati, E. Matloff, A. Rudolph. Ex Officio: M. Schadler, Associate Dean of Undergraduate Programs J. Underwood, Dean of the Faculty 1. The minutes of April19, 1 991 were· accepted. 2. Dean Weiner continued to review the current full·time faculty assignments at the college. The responsibilities and expectations of Visiting vs. Tenure Track faculty was discussed. 3. The following courses were unanimously approved as permanent offerings: HST-070 History ot the Arab-Israeli Conflict HST-074 Latin America and the Middle East: A Comparison of Revolutions HST-076 Islam, A History (The preceding cou.rses were approved with the understanding that they will be offered during the day, as opposed to the evening, as soon as possible.) HST-083 Mystics, Magic, and Witchcraft in Medieval and Early Modern Europe Nazi Germany Polymers and Material Science Genetic Engineering and Modern Plant Biology Democracy in American Politics Greek and Roman Tragedy in Translation HST-151 CHM-018 810-069 PSC-075 CLS-030 CLS-033 Greek and Roman Comedy and Romance in Translation 4. The following academic minors were unanimously approved: Anthropology, Arts, Biology, Chemistry, Classics, Computer Science, Economics, English, Geology, Modem Languages, Physics, Political Science, Psychology, Sociology. 5. The AAC endorses the Biology Department report on curricular revision and facility improvement. In particular: , a. The curricular revisions proposed are in line with the recommendations of the external review committee (The Cox Report) and are pedagogically sour:td. b. The teaching imposed by the addition of Gen-Ed courses •. the senior writing requirement, and an expanded honors program w1ll generate some additional course enrollment. c. Due to urgent space needs of the Biology Department, we recommend that the proposed iacility improvements be begun as soon as possible. Since these improvements are crucial to the academic program of the department, and since they do not expand the boundaries of the Biology Department, they can and should be implemented soon, rather than waiting for a major reconfiguration of the Science and Engineering Center. Unanimous vote. 6. The meeting was adjourned at 10:00 am. Respectfully Submitted, Neal M. Mazur remark to enjoin him with. \Hey Dude, 'jus finished about three Cokes and am goin' over to Carnegie Mall to play a little Smash T.V.\ I couldn't wait until he asked me to join him. Bry is known to be a \Smash T.V.\ threat and has been in steady training for the nationals to be held next month. l was quite relieved when he mentioned that \his partner was meeting him there.\ Upon wishing the best of luck to Bry, I drifted off into a daze. I started to think where this all started. I concluded that back in our youths, when the Japanese were looking for a way to beat our pants off, they decided to put a bug in our system. What they came up with were video games. It started with Atari (for the home), \Space Invaders\ and \Asteroids\ (for the mall/pizza parlor). Now it has progressed to \G3..T.e Boy\ which can be - Reduce, Reuse, Separate And Recycle band held, muted, and fits nicely behind the back of the person sitting in front of you in Economics. It's all a Japanese conspiracy to further our demise. A friend of mine on Wall Street recently told me that they are also not irnmune~­ one can buy video games for one's desk-top computer, and switch to stock prices by just pressing a button (when the boss walks by). Sitting down in my chair, awaiting a killer question from Professor Berk, I remembered h.is classic introduction, \Hello my friends ... arc there any questions? No? O.K .... The creme de Ia creme of American youth. One of the top fifty schools in America. A Gathering of Eagles.\ I thought of Josh and Bry hip--checking each other as he spoke those immortal words. Please don't call on me, I don't know my left from my right. FORGET ·STARTING MAY 20 TO SIGN UP FOR YOUR MEAL PLAN FOR NEXT.YEAR.

s <U.nnr.orbitttsis ENVIROI\IMEI\IT May 16, 1991 Local Heroes Saving· The Planet Kids Style By AMY BELLEAU From school blls gatherings to the Today show, a group of elementary schools kids in Freeport, Maine are getting their environmental .message heard. Familiarly known as CAKE (Concerned About Kids' Environment), the group has a simple mission: Find ways to tackle the envimnmental problems they have been learning about in school. In two years, the group has grown from four kids who met and organized on a school bus one afternoon to lGcal chapters in elementary and junior high schools throughout Maine. The original CAKE chapter, whose members hail from George C. Soule elementary school, decided to tackle polystyrene (the generic name for Styrofoam and similar products) as their first major project after watching television pro grams about global warming and the depletion of the ozone layer. For a local slant, the kids suggested banning the plastic foam in Freeport. \Kids know far more than we think they d(),\ says Kathleen SulHvan, a clinical socia·l worker and mother of founding member Bridget Sullivan Stevens, now 11 years old. \They read magazines and watch TV, and so they fear what's going to happen to the env~ronment if we don ',t take care of it.\ The CAKE group caused quite a stir in Freeport: They took on a squad of well-heeled lawyers and executives imported by a local fast food restaurant to fight an ordinance banning poly~tyrene. The kids started out with at least one council member on their side: Bridget's father, Robert Stevens, a lawyer who had drafted the ordinance, which was later approved. Their victory made national news when Bridget and fel'low founder Anna Brown (now 12 years old appeared on the Today show in July 1989. Instead of basking in the limelight, though, the Freeport group has continued with weekly meetings, recruiting new members, and forming new chapters at elementary and middle schools throughout Maine. Says nine-year-old Kay Bradley, a two-year CAKE veteran, \I think we're doing a good job.\ Mter watching the CAKE crew on the Today show. kids in Santa Fe decided to start their own chapter. Following their creed -- think globally but act locally-- individual CAKE chapters select a topic - from preserving wetlands to saving dolphins - and decide on a local focus. Some teachers have brought scientists into the classroom to help the kids decide on a focus. Last year, the Soule elementary group raised money for the rain forests. This year; the problems of oceans are at the top of their list. \I think these kids will be fascinating to watch in the next 10 or 20 years, because they have a very strong sense that they can make a difference when they work together and when they do, they can be very effective,\ Sullivan says.

LIRIANO Environmental Editor By now the garbage, wastes and damp problem has become so great, that it has now brought up an almost undoubtable question. Did a municipal garbage dump/land-fill in New York City cause the death of a ten year old girl? Can an illegal toxic wastes landfill cause leukemia, cancer and eventually death? These were questions that a mother of 10 year old Kerri Nonnon of Pelham Bay had to struggle to get answers for. Not only did Patricia Nonnon want answers for why the illegal landfill which she lived a couple of blocks away from, had been filled with toxic wastes as well as hundreds and thousands of gallons of industrial wastes, she also wanted the New York City Department of Sanitation to do something about it. Once Patricia discovered that the pew place she had moved into had a landfill that according to the State Senate Sub-Committee on Crime, between 1975 and 1979 mob linked carting films illegally threw an estimated 1 million gallons of hazardous wastes such as: contaminated solvents, waste oils, lacquers, PCBs and yyanid~s. she knew her neighbors had waited too long. · Whenever it rained the vapor from the wastes would be inhaled by hundreds of New Yorkers. When Patricia's neighbors heard about the little girl who had developed leukemia, they started to wonder why at least 10 other kids within the same block had also been attacked by the fatal and painful disease. The· people of Pelham Bay all got together to fight the city and through many stmggles and setbacks they got it to agree on cleaning up the landfill which otherwise would not have been done before the end of this century. The city has started on the clean up and it should be free of toxic wastes by 1996. Kerri Nonnon died on Ash Wednesday of 1989 at the age of 10. She first started to develop the illness at the age of 4 and while her family thought all would get better and that she would not die, she leaned more towards Lhat direction. Yes, this is one ' specific case out of many others which had to take a life and . incredible community effort to get anything done. I know it may be too idealistic on my part to continue thinking that we can stop these tragedies from happening, but I will conth1ue to believe that we can surely lessen them from happening. After all we ourselves are causing them. The passenger pigeon~ The heath hen. The Labrador duck The Carolina parakeet: Gon -e The list of extinct animals grows. But it doesn't have to.

Working for the Nature of Tomorrow TN NATIONAL-WILDLIFE FEDERATION In 1982 offi:cials in A.lbuquerque, New Mexico d,etermined that local residents were generating 1 .6 million pounds of hazardous waste -- and were dumping 90°/o of it into sewer systems, garage, or the groun~d. Hazardous wastes often found around homes inc:lude: paints and paint thinners, car batteries, oven and drain cleaners, mothballs, floor and furniture polish, brake or transmission fluid,_ antifreeze, rug and upholstery cleaners, pesticides, and furniture strippers. , Even products used to clean toilets are considered hazardous. People seem to have little idea when they're dealing with hazardous wastes. ~ccording to Environmental Hazards Management: \It has been estimated that in an average city of 100,000 residents, 3. 75 tons of toilet bowl cleaner, 13.75 tons of liquid household cleaners, and 3.44 tons of motor oil are discharged into city drains each month.\ Simple things to do: Store hazardous material properly. • Keep them in a cool, dry place. • Keep them in their original containers.

·.·.r .,.. . .LI:FE!iTYLE!i <lrnnrorhitnms A Little Greek Competition .( Dy JULIE SCHLANG Lifestyles Editor The Greeks on campus are all over the playing fields this week. Between Greek Week, Fiji volleyball and the DG Olympics, everyone is .getting in shape. It's a good thing too, because bathing suit season is creeping up quickly! Well, I attended a few of the so:t:ority games yesterday and it seems like a lot of people are .really getting involved this year. Besides the actual players, there were tons of sisters there to cheer · on their teams. The enthusiasm was overwhelming. This inspired me to write an article as a plea to everybody, Greeks and intlependents, to be a part of this year's Greek Week. . First of all, if you're not interested in playing, !.here are other ways to get involved. Watching your friends play is one way. The games get pretty exciting because this is the time when people who are not necessarily on teams here come out and show their hidden talents. People also come out who've always wanted to try playing a certain sport This adds a little comedy to the game. Anyway, it's just nice to see such friendly competition; so go watch tennis or volleyball or softball. If nothing more, you wiU get a good tan! It is particularly impor.ta~t this year that everymie show support for this event because our sponsor is the Make A 'Wish Foundation ratlter than a beer distributor. This organization uses the money they raise to grant wishes to terminally ill children, so please buy a tee shirt in the C()llege Center to supp()rt this cause. Dori't forget that when .the games are all over, there w.ill' be bands and a llBQ over near Fiji on Saturday. The willncrs ofGreek W ee.k and the Greek Gocl competiti()n will be revealed.

16 EDITORIAL (l!nttrDrbfrnsis -------Founded at Union College 1877--......_ Hot, Hot, Hot As spring term progresses here at Union College, one question often comes to mind-- why is there so little air conditioned space on campus? As the students sweat away in the Africa-like heat and humidity, we wonder why we are forced to endure such poor living and studying conditions. The sometimes unbearable temperature of late spring often makes life at Union extremely uncomfortable. It is sad that, due to feelings of imminent heatstroke, people who gathered to see such prominent speakers as Judge Bork and Rabbi Harold Kushner last weekend had to leave before the lecture was through. It's sadder that those who had the strengtll to stay couldn't concentrate on the talk, because of the sweltering heat. Students who pry themselves from the temptation of West Beach to go to the library soon find themselves leaving the building because of the impossibility of studying in the heat. People toss and turn at night in their sweat-drenched beds, unable to sleep. Many students empty their wallets in order to buy industrial size fans so that they can maintain a shred of sanity in their own rooms. The heat in the classrooms is so unbearable that many professors opt to hold classes outside although they know the class won't be able to concentrate as well outdoors. It is time for the administrators to step out of their air conditioned offices and homes and into the sweaty shoes of the student body. If they were to switch places with a typical student for just one day, the serious need for improvements in this area would no longer go unseen. Money Talks Once a year, we find ourselves congregating among those who are in perhaps the most instrumental positions of authority at Union College. One niight think that President Hull is the catalyst of change in our humble community. However, ifone were to ponder who the real proponents of policy are,. one must conclude that the chief facilitators of modification are neither the president, the administration, the alumni, the faculty, nor the ~tudents. Rather, this clout-holding status is in the hands of our parents and ultimately, at the mercy of cold hard cash. The fact that money is the chief instigator of metamorphosis is irrefutable. After all, it is not by chance that only one room in the entire Fox House dormitory has two telephone lines. Why does the student residing in this room have privileges that the average student does not? The fact of the matter is that the Telecommunications Office would laugh in any of our faces if we were to walk into the office this afternoon and demand an additional phone line. It is a different story though if one of ()Ur parents were to enter in with a big check. Yet, it is unfair to single out the Telecommunications Office in this grand scheme of indiscretion. Events such as Parents' Weekend remind us all of the way in which this school regards our parents. It is not a mere coincidence that all of our parents happen to be present the one weekend a year during which the school decides to host prominent speakers and sponsor numerous exciting and interesting activities. One is forced to conclude that the activities which transgress over the course of the aforementioned weekend are a ploy on behalf of the administration to impress our ever so generous parents.. In short, Parents' Weekend is a campaign to convince the customers that they are indeed getting the most for their money. Yet, while the school is so in· tune to its financial supporters, it is rather· ironic that tuition bills are addressed respectfully to the studehts. Given this state of consumer relations, perhaps the Admissions Office should begin to screen parents during the initial admissions process. Moreover~ it is ·obvious who the administration wishes to cater to; maybe students would be better off sending their parents· to school. \LETTER!i Unfinished Business in Wake of· Hathaway To the Editor: Certain newspaper articles on my case have given, predict- ably, a somewhat inaccurate account of my v1ew of events and I want to he sure to express the deep gratitude I feel to the students, faculty, alumni and staff who have supported me. I appreciate all of this support and, though I did not in fact solicit the press or initiate any activities on my own behalf, I think these protests against abuse of authority are good for the college. President Hull takes \strong-very strong- issue with the manner in· which Professors Heinegg and Hathaway have acted,\ but .the simple truth is that his own behavior has generated this \hullabaloo not any rabble- rousing on my part or from Peter Heinegg. We have responsibly corrected untrue statements made about ourselves and the English Department. And apparently, Underwood and Hull now have some difficulty finding amusement in their own joke. i The gnawing facts of my case have put their candor, good faith and competency in question. My friends and I have behaved with dignity and restraint. At the general faculty meeting that discussed my issue, only the attendant students conducted themselves as an adult body. I think these questions of administrative integrity are very real and should he pursued. My own business with Union is finished with this term but Union College still has some serious unfinished business to ALL LETTERS TO 1HE EDITOR MUST BE TYPED, DOUBLE SPACED AND SUBMITIED TO THE CONCORDIENSIS OFFICE BY 4:00 P.M. ON THE TUESDAY PRECEDING WEEKLY ISSUANCE OF CONCORDIENSIS. ANONYMOUS LETTERS AND THOSE OVER FIVE HUNDRED WORDS Wll...LNOTBE ACCEPTED. Letters to the Editor do not necessarily reflect the • • OplDIODS of the Editorial Board The resolution whicll the faculty voted for urged the administration to review deficiencies of evaluation that might have occurred on both sides. The English Department welcomed this opportu11ity to ex,plain its criteria for u~:i11g the student e·valuations and to explain all its procedures •. The administration still has .refused to reconsider actual procedures. I deCisively won a three-year non-tenure track positioa in a pational search. While Dean Underwood ignored all eVi.({ence except evaluation stati:stics, any competent social scientist understands that statistical analyses ef specific groupings compared With a heterog;eneous college average is extremely defective as a data intel)lretive tool and can only hold significance in conjunction with more substantial inter- views and observations. It is quite basically a matter of elementally compete11t re- search. In my case, there was more than sufficient evidence to indicate that I a.m a sufficiently interesting teacher to interesting students. It should be argued tha:t if, hypothetically, other depart- ments are making faculty decisions solely on the basis of raw statistics, their procooures deserve censure and correction. Faculty and students wh() 1mow nothing about my teaclling or personality have seen that the administration's procedures seem illogical and unfair. How could politically savvy administrators get in such a mess? A brief polite letter to me in November explailling a change. of personnel policy, would have precluded all this dismay. Why have they stonewalled every honest inquiry? I don't know. I did note with astonishment that the Associate Dean of Faculty thought it a matter for boasting that Union College has consistently let go professors who have become world famous scholars. I would venture to speculate that Union College has been burdened for some time by an ethos of aggressive mediocrity which delights in patronizing originality. Under no c:iicumstance would I accede to the insulting lie that I am not a good enough teacher for Union College by accepting the contemptuously tossed ·bone of a one-year job- tendered with the snide proviso that the dean must monitor which courses I am capable of teaching. Personally, I need no further vindication than the excellent support I have already received. I would like to express ·my ardent support for those who must continue the struggle against this cynicism. I have been quoted as saying \I hope this is the end of it\ and I do hope that my job-issue as a particular side-track is fmished, but I hardly hope that Union's best will lapse into sullen fatalism. But that is not a fearful hope; none of this hullabaloo has really been about me from the start. It has been about who really cares about what we do here and Who really does not.

M~y 16, 1991 <llllltfllrbirn.st.s 1 7 . Big Brothers/Big Sisters Budget Cut Lack of Consideration To the Editors: I would like to express a concern I have about the attitude which appears to exist among members of Student Forum. As a member of the. Executive Committee of Big Brothers/Big Sisters, I prepared a budget proposal for the Student Forum. In our proposal, we carefully looked over even.ts held in years past and asked for money only for those events we thought we might like to do again next year. We figured that it was pretty likely we would receive an amount similar to the one we had been granted this year (at least somewhat similar). The fact of the matter is that Student Forum granted us less. than half of what we received this year. In speaking with our finance representative, I was told that Finance Committee had recommended we receive something close to what we received this year, but that it was Student Forum who voted d()wn this amount. Our fmance representative was told that the reason Student Forum cut our m.oney was that Big Brothers/Big Sisters did no deserve so much money since it was not going to benefit Union College students. Therefore, I feel an e:xplanation ·Of the ll'ig Brothers/Big Sisters Club is necessary. We are a group which, through the help of an under~taffed,. non-profit agency, matches Union College students with a child from the Schenectady community who needs a friend to give them some guidance. This match, as it is called, is a relationship l:Jetween the student and the cbild from which both ·benefit. lm addition to matchinlt smdents with children from the community, this club also is active in an outreach program catted the Reach Out Center in tile evenings at the Central Park School. Both of these programs benefit the Union Cc,)llege student. Both / programs give the student an opportunity t~ learn about the real world which exists outside of these iron gates. We can understand that the current fiscal situation does not allow us to receive as much money as we did last year but without this money our club will fall apart. Most of the Union students who are Big Brothers or Big Sisters do not have a lot of extra money to spend on their Little Brothers or Sisters. The money received from Student Forum every year goes towards trips, barbecues and movies for the matches. By cutting the funding of this club, Stud,ent Forum is basically saying they do not support what we are doing. Would it pain our stud~nt government too much to allow Union Students the opportunity to give something back to the community? Kelly McGowan 346-4722 To the Editors: The Big Brothers/Big Sisters Club recently received the following letter concerning an event involving the Gamma Phi Beta sorority and the youth from the Reach Out Center (ROC). We feel its contents should be brought to the attention of tlie student body. \We appreciate the invitation to the April 28, 1991 Barbecue sponsored by the Gamma Phi Beta sorority. However, we have concerns about the way the event was handled that we would like to bring to your attention. however, that it was not the Gamma Phi sisters or pledges who did not eat, i·t was the children. In addition, few members of the sorority who were the supposed hosts to these children attempted to interact with the kids or even acknowledge our presence. Since our goal at ROC is to offer positive role models and self-image enhancing experiences for the youth involved, this event was disappointing. \Surely these problems were unintentional and we do appreciate being included in your plans.\ Unfortunately, this is not the first event of this nature sponsored by a Union College organization which has expressed such a lack of consideration. We sincerely wish that any such programs put forth in the future, be it to fulfill a philanthropy or for any other reason, are done so with care and concern. Committment to Conlmunity and JSU \The 22 youth from the ROC, Reach Out Center Program, had been invited to an afternoon af games (a scavenger hunt} followed by refreshments at a barbecue. When the staff and youth arrived. no recreational activities were organized and our ,own staff had to improvise some games in order to keep the group busy. Secondly, there was apparently not enough food provided; the food ran out before everyone was served. It is important to note, Sincerely, Stephanie Kossin Wolos ROC Coordinator Jerry Juliano To the Edit:ers: It is my pleasure to inform the Union Community that Prof. Stephen Berk was recognized for his outstanding dedication and commitment to the Jewish Community at Union .College. To the Editors: On Monday night I introduced Rabbi Harold Kushner, author of When Bad things Happen to Good People. He spoke on his latest release Who Needs God. I would like to thank everyone who bas made his appearance possible. Therefore, THANK YOU President Hull, Dean Mammola, Speakers On Saturday morning d~g .Parents' Weekend, the JSU made a generous donation to th.e Children's Pavilion being built at Had-assah Hebrew UJJiversity Medical Center at Ein Keretn, which will consolidate all pediatric facilities and services. This Thank You F<>rum, Minerva Hour C()mmittee, Dean Underwood, Dean Wood, Prof. Berk, Prof. Huggins, Student Activities, tile Protestant and Catholic Ministries, and a special thank you to Prof. Heckleman for her llelp and guidance. I must also say that this event would not have been }Jossible without the aid and dedication of the Jewish Student Union Board. \o···~··. •e,·· · ·• ·· ' .............. ·.· ...

The performance was videotaped and anyone who is interested in viewing it should write to Box 559, and I will arrange it. Thank you, Seth Ellis former Co-President oftheJSU Stay Sober and Help \Make a Wish\ To the Editors: This upcoming week marks a change in Greek affairs. In the past years, the Interfraternity Council has organized many successful Greek Week competitions. This year, hopefully. will be no different. But, what will be different is tile role of alcohol during the events. To further move away from the role of alcohol, the IFC has decided to donate the money raised from the T -Shirt sales to charity. This year, the charity involved is the \Make a Wish\ Foundation in which terminally :ill children are granted a wish they always wanted. The \Make a Wish\ Foundation makes possible the wish through donations from altruistic organizations like the Interfraternity Council. But in order for this week to be a success, the responsibility falls on you, the student. To promote the non-alcoholic nature, the IFC asks that students do not bring alcohol to the events, barbecue, band, and the award ceremony. If everyone acts responsibly, not only will Greek Week be exceptionally fun; it will also help a very special child.

! A.RT!i &. EI\ITERT AII\IMEI\IT May 16~ 1991 People Are Dying to Attend A Review of Ten Little Indians By JULIE MEDOW Arts Editor Mountebanks production of Agatha Christie's classic murder mystery Ten Little Indians opened last Thursday in the Nott Memorial. There w i 11 be three · more performances this weekend starting tonight and running through Saturday after which time the theater wi!l close for repairs. In fact, th~ Nott will no longer be the home of Union's theater. The Memorial building will most probably be turned into archives, and (hopefully) a new, and more practical, theater will be built somewhere else on campus. There was apparently a debate among the members of Mountebanks during the winter over whether they should put on a musical or a mystery this spring. although a musical production is usually done every year, the members decided that a change of pace could be interesting and challenging, as well as being less- of a problem; finding people who sing well or who are willing to play instruments can be very difficult and too time consuming. Needless to say, the decision was in favor of a mystery, and, after seeing the premier perfonnance of Ten Little Indians a week ago, I cannot help but think that Mountebanks made the corFect choice. The well chosen cast consists of eleven Union students, ten of whom play victims to the one mystery killer. The entire death-trap is based on a simple nursery rhyme about little Indians who disappear one by one. No, not everyone dies, but each time another one turns up dead. the suspense becomes all the more thrilling. When it gets down to two characters (my favorite suspect was .already dead at this point, which confused me greatly), get prepared for some intricate plot re-arrangement and typical \Christie-like\ twists, which culminate in a surprise ending. (Of course, I turned to my Mom and said \I knew it, I told you so.,\ but since we can't all be as prolific as I am, don't be upset if you guess incorrectly.) The set is a wonderful re- creation of an art-deco style living room, complete with a faux marble floor, a mahogany drinking cart, and a terrific turquoise-stone fireplace. The acting was also very true to life, even in the over- dramatized comic caricatures played by Andy Lipman (a Gatsby-ish polo playing type), and Max Heinegg (as a quirky, somewhat senile retired general). Everyone is to be commended for their respective performances, as well as for their interaction with other members of the cast (for e:l\ample, Stacey Cervellino and David Lopiano had me convinced by their emotional reversals towards one another). Even the English accents were, for the most part, very well projected. The only problem I had was in the ending of the play, which to me seemed to be a bit contrived. But this had nothing to do with the cast, rather it is the fault of Agatha Christie herself for writing such a silly ending. However, this did not take away from my overall appreciation of Ten Little Indians. I still think it is something worth seeing over the weekend. You can purchase tickets at the table in the College Center, or at the box office in the Nott. QQ '1 Oc.J. <::RR,INC:!, TE.~IV\ P~~~ S.c..

The program will start with improvised duets between · acoustic bassist Wilbo Wright and pianist Jeff Presslaff and continue with a presentation of Dusenbury's work with improvised accompaniment by Wright and Presslaff. P'aul Dusenbury is a Seattle- based artist who has developed various techniques for painting on glass slides which when prcjected, effectively extend interplay of light, color, and space beyond the confines of traditional easel painting. These \lightscapes\ unfold in real time in a similar way to improvised music. D11senbury is a graduate of Hampton University and the University of Washington, Seattle, and has shown his work in galleries in the Pacific Northwest over the last 20 years. Wilbo Wright was last seen at Union College with the Jeff Presslaff Quintet, with whom he plays regularly.

.~ . - !iPDRT!i Men's Track Beats The Heat In Buffalo Uy GREG BARRETT States proved to be full of excitement for the Union Tracksters. The five hour trip to the University at Buffalo brought home some record times despite the blistering hot track. All of the fastest competition from all over the state including both Division I and Division III schools were there. Defending National Champions and State champions greeted the Dutchmen with a sickly grin. Glen \crash\ Meixellled off their scoring drive clearing 13'6\ in the pole vault. This sent him skying to fifth place. Rich Pulver followed his lead popping a 13.40m toss in the shot. This wrapped up a sixth place finish. Pulver came back the next day and picked up a major PR in the discus With a spin of 38.59m. The SOOm dash proved to be another strong point for the Dutchmen. Senior Co-Captain Bob Lindyberg scored a big PR with a 1:58.0 qualifying for the finals. He carne back the next day and racked up a seventh place finish with a \hot\ 1:59.6. The 4 x 800m relay was another high point. Bac Nguyen PR'ed with a 2:01.0 leading the relay to its seasonal best time of 8:30.1. Greg Barrett, Pete Protzel and Rich Zembek rounded out the relay with times of 2:07.1, 2:13.3 and 2:09 respectively. The 4 x 400m relay saw the Dutchmen crush everyone in their heat and break into the fast heat to tie for sixth place. Bill Taylor, Bob Lindyberg and Bac Nguyen ran 50. 79, 51.57 and 52.79 respectively. Senior Co- Captain Will Allen dropped a new PR as the anchor leg with a 51.06. Their combined time of 3:26.2 was a new seasonal best. The Tracksters have one more meet at home on Friday. The Spring Classic is the last chance for many athletes to qualify for Nationals and the competition is always extreme- ly fierce. The meet starts at Spm (so there are no excuses) so come out and watch your favorite Dutchmen go head to head with the hottest, fastest runners, jumpers and throwers in the nation.

COME SBOlf YOIJII SUPP.OIIT FOR 'l'liE ONION GREEKS I II May 16, 1991 Women's Softball Ends SeiSOII on High Note~ Ranked Second In State ,By RON BIRNBAUM This season was the best ever for Union's softball finishing with a 17-5 record. The Dutcbwomen al~o took second at States. This took place as part of the New York State Women's Collegiate Championship Townament, a 3-round .single elimination competition, where Union defeated both Binghamton and RIT before losing to Brockport in the finals. In the first game vs. Binghamton, Union scored the first 2 runs in the fourth after sophomore rightfielder Kim Twombly and senior .thirdbaseman quad-captain Teresa Sanchez singled to get on base, brought home by teammates Brenda Marsh, freshman firstbaseman, and Lauren Seidman~ sophomme DH. Binghamton tried to rally with a couple of hits that inning but could not score. In the fifth, junior catcher Robin Romer tripled but did not score, and Union scored its third run in the sixth, sophomore ,rightfielder Liz Trip scorin-g off sophomore leftfielder Dawn Harrington's RBI. After 3 quick outs to end the inning for Binghamton, Union scored its final run with Romer in the last inning, singling and scoring with Marsh's RBI, ending the game 4-0. Senior shortstop quad- captain Kathy Lawliss also had an RBI. Against Rit the fight was closer, the final score 6-5. In the first, RIT's frrst 2 batters got on base and scored, while Harrington singled and scored the sole run for Union, the inning ending with RIT up 2- 1. Between the second and sixth innings, Harrington scored 2 more runs on 2 walks, the only runs scored for either side, though Romer, Twombly and Sanchez came close, stranded at third. Harrington's runs included the tying run in the third and the go ahead run in the fifth, taken in with Sanchez's 3 RBis. Otherwise, the outs were quick. In the seventh, each side scored 3 more runs. For RIT, the 3 runs scored with 3 consecutive batters, giving the team a 5-:3 lead after 3 straight doubles.:. Yet, for Union, Harrington·- scored again after a hit on Romer's double/RBI. This was her second run which included a stolen base. Romer also scored, for which Sanchez got her fourth R:SI, as well as Marsh, off Seidman, who again was DH. The final game ended with a 5-2 score, Brockport leading throughout. It lead off with 2 runs in the second, arid getting a third in the · third. Unfortunately, Unio11 through the fourth got 3 consecutive outs each inning. Brockport also scored again i11 the fifth and the sixth, one roll each. In the fifth, however, with 2 outs Marsh for Unio11 doubled, advanced on a passed ball, anq pitcher Sarah Dud2ic R.Bid her with a double. Union scored again the seventh, R.omer on base with a single a11d scoring with the aid of a st<>len base and a passed ball. In terms of the final finish, head cooch Suzan11e Zaloom stated, \I can't be proader of us as individuals or as a team .. \ Referring to the start of the season versus RIT and Oneonta, \They didn't let a d1ree-game losing streak bother them. Instead they went out and won six more games.\ The key to winning was pitcher Sarah Dudzic wh<> had a final 1. 79 ERA, with 5 seasonal shutouts and less than 3 walkS per game. Romer had the highest team bating average at .425, 25 runs scored, and 17 RBis, tied with Matsh.· Marsh, excellent in infield, was given title Rookie of the Year. Eisma was essential with 23 of 26 stolen bases in the .past 2 years and great in tile field. Harrington, Seidman, and Lawliss contributed also to the stolen base effort. Twombly was particularly useful for hitting, and freshman Chris Weske, one of tile team's fastest players, will aim for staring outfield next year. In addition, junior infitlder Wendy Getty, as the m(}St 11nselfish team player accordiltg to both coaches Zaloom and assistant George Cuttita~ is great in the field, to start at ftrst next year. Subs Sunny Shailam. Liz Trip, and Tara Rabinowitz added to the team as pinch runners and hitters where needed. Also of mention were Jill Bernstein and ICim Keller, team managers wh<> went to all games and kept book.

The women traveled to Ithaca College for. the ECAC meet where they placed a record high of sixth overaJI. This performance is especially impressive when you consider that six was also the number of Union women competing in ~e meet. In an exciting race the 4xl00 meter relay set another school record time of 50.1 seconds and placed third. Their time was fast, yet not quite fast enough for the Gabby Girls; their goal is the NCAA qualifier of 49.4 seconds.

The Playo fs By JOHN SCHACHNOVSKY Okay, enough is enough! · What started out as a joke has tumed into madness~ When the Minnesota North Stars defeated · the aU-world Chicago Blackhawks in the ftrst round of this year's National Hockey League playoffs the sports world was buzzing with the possibility of Minnesota in the Stanley Cup finals. Come on though, Coach Gainey. we were all just kidding . .. You know ... trying to make you feel better. This was not supposed to happen. Oh, don't worry Coach 1 ohnson, we have not forgotten about you and your igloo full of Penguins, who have as much right in the finals as Geraldine FeRaro did to be in the Whit House in 1984. We at the Concordiensis realize that the Minnesota North Stars have been in the paper for the past month now. However, they're going to stay here as long as they continue this magical playoff run. We also feel that many .hockey fans are blowing this~ acllievement off like it's nothing. Well here are a few more facts. to whet your appetite for the c~ming finals: This is the first cup final between two teams from the United States since these same North Stars i<>St to the Islanders in 1981. In the past eight years the Penguins have been in the playoffs only one other time. These two teams have been in tile NHL 46 years. Their combined number of Stanley Cups is easy to count ... 0! If Minnesota wins, they will be the first under .500 team to win since the 1948-49 Toronto Maple Leafs; that's right, 1948-49! Well, the stage is set. The teams are in Pittsburgh ready for the opening face-off. The only thing left t& do is thank our lucky stars, so to speak, that no West Coast team is in the finals so we can all get to bed before midnight. Adios, and good luck to the hundreds upon thousands of North Stars fans who have appeared within the last week. Intramural Update Spring 1991 The scouting of these past weeks is the reason .that there hasn't been an update on intramurals. Before I go in depth I will tell you the leaders in the reSJlective sports. CoG R e c Soft b a II: Sigma Chi \A\ Softball: D.U. \B\ Softball: Sigma Chi Cooties Lax: Chi Psi Volleyball: FIJI Here are some of my spring evaluations: First of all the Yanks led by Bill Benson and the rest of the athletic staff disappointed us all by not only getting blown out in their rust game, but by then forfeiting out of the softball league. This team with all their experience and talent is definitely the disappointment of the spring. the intramural committee is still investigating the payment of the $10 forfeit fee. The surprise of the spring is the \B\ league softball team the Ex Cooties. The league leaders have performed admirably and way above original expectations. Led by coach Mike Kimber the Cooties have come through in the clutch all season. A wild~ card playoff entry tast year, this team has only one goal this year: to cooter. The trophy is still up for grabs, but Sigma Chi can clinch it with a few Intramural championships (which they haven't in over a ~nn). --CATCH YOU NEXT WEEK Scoreboard Women's WHiiams 18 Lacrosse {4·9) UNION 4 UNION UNION Softball State Tournament 4 Binghamton 0 6 RIT5 Brockport 5 UNION 2 -

.. , Young Dutchwomen lax Team Ends At 4-9 Courtesy of SPORTS INFORMATION The women's lacrosse team at Union College took some lumps this year, but overall the Dutchwomen finished the 1991 campaign a little richer for their efforts. In what second- year head coach Charlyn Robert knew would be a rebuilding season, Union ended with a respectable 4-9 record against some of the best competition that was offered by New York and New England. Union will graduate just four seniors from this year's squad and will return 14 letterwinners next season. One of the biggest graduation losses that will be suffered by the Dutchwomen is that of three-year defensive wing starter Lynn Hyde. Hyde, who earlier this year became the first Union woman to be named as one of just 10 New York State Women's Collegiate Athletic Association Scholar Athletes, tallied 11 points this year (8-3). More importantly, her leadership and competitive spirit will be difficult to replace. Classmate Jen Brandwein topped Union's scoring chart with 16 points (13-3). The two-year lctterwinner, who participated in the program all four years, incraesed her point output by 13 from last year to this season. Senior point Wendy Kaplan earned two varsity letters during her career at Union whle netminder Ketrina Knuff did a good jol> in her first season in the program. Union should be solid, and balanced, in the attack department next season. Junior Robin Bidstrup finished with 15 points (12-3) while picking up her third varsity letter and classmate Kirstin Neibergs earned her first letter and scoreed 11-2-13. Junior len Pompliano earned her first letter and tallied 9-1-1 0 while alternating between attack and defense while sophomore Sabra Hall also scored 9-1-10 while earning her second letter. Junior Robyn Sachs, who played two jayvee seasons before lettering this year, should be ready to step into the starting goalie spot in 1992. Sachs, who saw quality time as the backup this year, gave up 17 goals with 11 saves. Sachs will also have the benefit of a more seasoned defense in front of her next season. 1991 Final Union College· Wom~n's' · Lacrosse Stats . · · · · · . .

!iTUDEI\IT FORUM ELECTIDI\I!i <lln1tfllrDtrnzi~ 25 President Brendan Clifford AramFuchs Hi, my name is Aram Fuchs I, Brendan Clifford,. am running for the Student Forum Presidency and would like your vote. After going through my qualifications, I will present my understanding of tl:e Student Forum and what I intend to do with that organizaton if elected. · and I'm running for president because, quite simply, I believe it is time for some change here . · at Union College. . We, the students at Union, are attending the university at a : critical juncture in its history. For the past three years, I have been actively involved in the activities of this campus. As I am in the midst of serving my second term as president of Theta Delta Chi, I have become quite learned with regards to issues involving Greeks. Although I believe that the Union Greek system must expand its contribution to the Union community, I have and will continue to defend their rights to exist We have a newly elected presldent and . we are approaching our 200th anniversary. At this crucial time in our history, it seems as if the Student Forum has been invisibile in :representing us. We, the student body, have an · obligation to empower our sole representative voice on campus. We cannot let it be overrun by people who seem to have one eye on Union and the other on their own resumes. At Union, we have been angered by the deans forcing their· housing plans upon U.s. We are outragedby the method Through my positions as class representative and member of the Student Affairs Council, I have also become educated to issues that involve the entire student body. For example, I have been an active participant in the review of the Middle States and the Committee on Residenced Life's reports. Indicative that I do not represent a limited portion of the Union community are my votes in favor of housing for Gamma Phi Beta and of increased funding for the President's Committee on Diversity. As I have for two years as class representative, I would use the office of the Presidency to best serve the interests of the entire student body. · . the teacher evaluations have been handled, We feel the pain of a seemingly endless spiral of tuition increases. More than being part of the solution, our Student Forum has been part of the problem. Due to my experience, I know how the Student Forum operates and more important I recognize its limitations. I will not use a platfonn of \Student Forum bashing\ as a means to get elected because I believe that Jay Freeland has improved the organization's responsiveness to the student . body in comprarison to the previous year. Yet, I still believe there is work to be done. If elected I intend to · maximize the Student Forum's potential to serve the interests of the students. Sincerely, Brendan Cliffa:d No matter how good the intentions were, the time is gone when a letter to the editor, an editorial, or a protest in reaction to an administrative folly will suffice. The time has come for students to be honestly involved in all aspects of their student life from the beginning. The time has come for the students to have a strong, viable and representative governing body that will act and not react. If given the chance, I will establish one. Thank you very much. ! .• , ' .. . .·,_,_·v :i • :· ' ·_. ·. ,· . ' ,•,,-., :- ·.• .-:·~:.· :~ .'.'.::--: . .

The position is important beca~;~se the Board mates decisions that o£ten directly and immediately effect . the student body. I want to be at Board meetings to express the students' opinions. I have been extremely active for the · past·two years and have learned . a lot about Union. One of the . bigg(1st. problems is the lack of communication on all levels.

I believe that students can make a difference. I hope that you will consider me for this position. Thank You. Jacques Etienne Hi! My name is Jacques Paul Etienne and I am running for the position of Junior Trustee of the Student Forum. It is very important that the entire sutdent body take part in the selection of these officers, specifically the Junior Trustee since he/she will; for two years, be the ambassador io the Board of Trustees. I seek this position because of my dedication (at driving) to create a better Union on a more equitable term. This means a place where the students will have a strong voice in matters and move from a reactive to a proactive mode. Over the last two years, I have held key positions and have participated in an array of organizations (AlAS, SPAA, Alpha Phi Alpha, Inter Fraternity Council, Orientation · Committee, etc.), which help shape the Union that we know. As a recipient of the Wendy Bernstein Award, I have been recognized by my peers as the sophomore who has given superior service to the college and its community. A vote for me is a vote for sincerity, active leadership and excellence in service. Julie J am.ieson This .student body representative to the Board ·Of 'Trustees is a two-year position wltlch I fully intend to dedicate myself to if elected. The Junior Trustee should be committed to tile student body, and be an effective liaison between the Beard and students. I feel I have tile commitment and ability to bring students' views and concerns to the Board and return to the students with the decisions of the Board. My interest in and knowledge of · U11ion is apparent through my involvement around campus: as an intern in the Annual Fund Office, A gates keeper, an Qrientation Advisor, and in my scrority. It is in the best interest of the entire Union community if student concerns are expressed and acted upon.

On Friday, May 17, you must elect a .student to best serve our interests. It is imperative that all Union students have a leader i11forming them about the various issues facing this campus in the future. Also, we need a leader not only conveying om feelings about those issues to the Board of Trustees, but also a leader conveying the feelings of tile Board members to the students. I am not going to write a tedious and prolonged speech • because there is no need for one. However, it is important that you know I am Pro- Student beca.usc of my involvement in many .student activities, and lhat 1 am Pro- Greek because of my involvement in· the Greek System. Although there are a number of different interest groups on campus, all Union students must take a stand together in order to promo.te our self-interests. This is a critical time for Union. Already, major changes aTe taking place. Union studellts now and in. the future need their interests represented in the best possible way. It is vital. I feel that my credentials qualify me for the position l()f Junior Trustee. At home, I have worked with various Congressmen and was invited to speak about J!eer pressllTe by my local police department. At Union, I am a Region.al Director of Ambassadors, member of the Ge11eral Education Board-assisting in the discussions concerning the GenEd requirements, memoor of the Maxcy House Use Committee-assisting in the determination of the future u.se of what once was the Beta Theta Pi Residence, a \Union Today\ Alumni Host f()r tile $150 million Bicentennial campaign, and involved in athletics.

I understand the obstacles various student organizations face because I myself had to face many of those obstacles also. At the same time I also understand that there are certain regulations that must be followed in order for the Finance Committee to successfully carry out the duties that are required by Union College. If elected for this position I will be sure to perform all duties over and above what is expected. I will do my best to make sure that all decisions are based on fair review of all - available information. I will do my best to make you feel confident and proud of your decision to choose Tyrone L.

This experience would help me to understand the problems confronting the Student Forum from different people's points of view. I also participate in several different clubs and activities such as the Human Subjects Committee, the Recycling Club, the Philomathean Literary and Debating Society, and I am also a Gatekeeper. All of these help me to understand the student body's feelings on issues. However, if elected, I would encourage you to contact me with any problems you might have.

I am running for this position and no other because I am sincerely interested in having a hand in all of the Forum decisions which will affect our class in the coming year. Since 1988 I have had the opportunity to meet many of you, and in the past three years I believe that I have gained enough insight into the chemistry of our class to bring many of your interests into the Student Forum. If elected, I would make an even greater effort to keep in touch with you and be as accessible as I know how.

The fact that I have never before served as a member of the Student Forum works in my favor as it is clear to us all that Union College is in desperate need of refonn.

MarcyWein After sitting on Student Forum for a year, I have seen what it takes to be a valued member: open-mindedness, a good working knowledge of the college and determination. Student Forum, as well as my experience with the residential lfie program, Panhellenic, and Student Mffairs Council, have endowed me with the ability to act in a representative manner for the student body. Over the past year many controversial issues arose during Forum meetings. I was able to hold fast to my opinions. AU that I have experienced has taught me what it means to be useful to the student body. Please remember to vote on Friday, and thank you for your support.

2s @lltlfllrbirn.sts Senior Class Rep. Mike Rolnick Fellow Classmates - For those of you who don't know me, my name is Mike Rolnick. I'm running for re- election as your class representative to tile Student Forum. I offer you the following credentials to support my bid for re-election. I've served on Student Forum as your class representative for tl1e past year. My experience on the Forum gives me an anderstanding of how to better represent our class in issues which arise each week. My campus activities include: National Director of the Ambassador Program, Gate- keeper Coordinator. and Orientation Committee. My involvement in campus activities reflects my ability to serve on the Student Forum as an effective representative. I would appreciate your support in my bid for re-election as Senior Class Representative tomorrow. Thank you_ Mike Rolnick My name is Lee Popper and I am running for Student Forum representative for the class of 1994. I believe that tluough my past experience in student government, vice- president of my class for two years and a member of our student government council for four, I can help to enrich the Union College community through dedication and determination. I intend to enhance the student involvement which will be beneficial to our school. Students need to be more active in the workings of this school and should be given the opportunity to voice their opinion. I believe the decisions made by the Student Forum should be known by all Union students. The student body should have a strong impact on tflc usc of the money that Olii budget provides. Our budget should be used to improve the college life for the students. College should be made as beneficial and as enjoyable to the students as possible. I would like to have the opportunity to enhance these aspects at Union College. Thanks for your s11pport, Lee Popper !iTUDEI\IT FORUM ELECT.IDI\l!i May 16, Sophomore Class Representatives Jennifer Baldwin WHY? Why do we sit around not stepping forward to tell the administration what we feel and what we want changed. Why does it always seem that we are upset because once again the administration has stepped in and changed or created rules that hamper our college experience. I want to be the one who win speak up and step in the way of the administration. I feel that I have the qualities that will enable me to communicate easily with the administration. Being involved with swimming, Greek life and admission programs I have become acquainted with a broad spectrum of the school. I can therefore speak with the voices of many people instead of just a select few. I am ready to listen, and act with everyone's views in mind. Vote today for sophomore representative; make the right choice. ; Mia Caetano After serving this past year as one of your three Class Representatives, I feel that I have gained valuable liaison experience with regards to communication between the administration and student body. By having the opportunity to learn from the junior and senior members of the Student Forum, I have developed a better understanding of how the governing system functions here at Union. One of my main goals to achieve during my years at Union is to not only participate in the campus community, but also to make a significant contribution as well. By Re-Electing me to the office of C I a s s Representative, you will be giving me the opportunity to achieve this goal. On Friday, May 17, VOTE MIA CAETANO for CLASS REPRESENTATIVE. Thank you for your support. VOTE ',~r Kristina Frenyea I know that this is a time when everybody is worried about how dark his/her tan is, but I'm asking you to take some time to think about next · year. As a sophomore representative in the Student Forum I would promote responsible student government. 1 understand the perspectives of both the administration and the students, so I could act as a competent liaison between the two parties. I have been involved in a spectrum of activities ranging from being an editor for the Garnet to working with prospective freshmen for the Ambassador Program. I was also chosen as an alternate RA for next year which will offer me greater interaction with the administration. All of these things combined will help me to represent our class effectively, so vote for me! Patrick Haskell In today's society, many people take government, and the leaders of government, ve:ry lightly. As a result, the majority of the public does not take part in politics. I feel that as educated women and men, we should put forth the best effort to participate in the process of choosing future leaders so that we, together, may protect the \certain unalienable rights\ of \life liberty. and the pursuit of happiness\ which Thomas Jefferson put forth in the Dec1aration of Independence. The right that we all have to life consists of bow we go about our day to day living; things such as housing and meal plans bave to be taken seriously. The representatives of the Class of 1994 have to force the administration to provide u.s with housing that people will want to live in, both because it is an affordable alternative, ad because the housing is an enjoyable relaxing environment, not cramped with lack of proper facilities. Also, the dining services should make the meal plan something that people want to have day in and day out; not just when there is an ice sculpture for Parents' Weekend. The money spent on special gatherings and little unnecessary \niceties\ should be put fotth for better cooking facilities, or cash incentives for the employees in the dining llall to give them added incentive. The right of liberty is the freedom for ~veryone on this campus, regardless of race, color. sex, or creed to function unbiased in .all their campus functions. Issues need to be · brought out, both outright and underlying, that deal with discrimination and the violation of personal liberties of all sorts. This dm be done by bringing in more speakers, and providing forums for students to deal with questions that are often swept under the rug. Many of these already exist, but I feel that they need to be expanded, and pushed into the limelight, not only by faculty or a few conscious interest groups, but by the student government. Hopefully by doing this, we as a college community can make Union a microcosm of what life should be like. The \Pursuit of Happiness\ is the right all students have to find happiness in their lives. This needs to be encouraged by providing more recreational activities that both Independent and Greek students can participate in together. That is not to say that the right of the Greek system should be downplayed in its role of providing a special bond which some students seek which is important to them, but that we should all provide another avenue that everyone can enjoy as a community of one, not of separate entities. Tirrougb my past experience as an Officer of the Student Council in high school, I realize the commitment it takes to represent your peers properly in an elected office. By utilizing this experience along with an open mind for all ideas, I feel that I could contribate a large part in moving our class and campus close to the previous stated goals. I hope that you are willing. to take a chance with me in the years that we are most able to embrace life. VOTE FOR PAT . HASKELL FOR YOUR REPRESENTATIVE! Blaine Langberg As summer ever so slowly approaches the metropolis of Schenectady~ and our Freshman year draws to a close, we must begin to plan for next year. In order to lay the groundwork for a successful Sophomore year, we must select dynamic class representatives. What exactly does a class representative do, you ask? Not to take away from my fellow representatives, but being both Freshman Class Vice President as well as the most active Freshman in the Student Forum, I know the answer to the question better than anyone. As a class representative I attended Student Forum meetings and took part in discussions on academic, financial, and social proposals. Unfortunately, Freshmen were not allowed to sit on the committees which formulated these various proposals. This inequity is the primary reason why I want to return to Student Forum as a Sophomore. Having the experience of being a Freshman Class Representative behind me, I am ~tter suited to serve another year on Student Forum and now as ·a committee member as Sophomore Class Representative. So, if you want an experienced candidate who will actively convey yoi:rr opinion, vote for Blaine. Vote'· \·· ' .

The police arrived at the site but tlJ.e alleged. perpetrators had already fled from the scene of the crime. The pursuit led onto campus and proceeded towards Library Field. One of the assailants ran into the Psychology building and was soon after caught by one of the policemen. The other alleged burglar ran from the Psychology building toward West Beach. At this point three Union students decided to assist by chasing the offender toward West Beach. He then dodged a tackle by one of the students and then made his way over the West Beach Wall and landed face down on the grass. Immediately after the fall, Roger Smith, a freshman, dove on top of the intruder and, with the help of Lou Acquatulo and another student held him until the police handcuffed him. The two assailants, one a juvenile and the other a young adult, are being charged with attempted burglary. Campus Security is charging the two with Criminal Trespass Third Degree. Paul Mantica, Director of Campus Security, stated that the efforts of the students should be applauded and that they will be receiving letters of commendation from the Schenectady Police Depart- ment.

1\JEW!i AI\IALY!il!i May 23, 1991 ·• ... Inside the Political Spectrum By JIM POLITES Associate News Editor This week's news analysis, after a short hiatus, will return to the national scope of politics by touching on a number of pertinent issues that pervade our country today. First of all, something must be said about George Bush's Chief of Staff John Sununu and his· clandestine sojourns u:iing government air vehicles. This underhanded practice has cost the American taxpayers hundreds of thousands of dollars, and its uncovering has had numerous adverse effects on Bush's administtation. When running for office in 1988, our current Chief Executive's platform included a plank that called for pragmatism, integrity, and honesty, one where public officials could be trusted in running our nation. Sununu, who for three years presented the image of a loyal, though Gone, But Not Forgotten. The passenger pigeon. The heath hen The Labrador duck. The Carolina parakeet. The list of extinct animals grows. · But it doesn't have to. The National Wildlife Federation is worldng to save endangered spedes. join us while there's still time. The National Wildlife Federation, 1412 16th Street, NW, Washington, DC 20036· 2266. Working for the Nature of Tomorrow,. NATIONAL WILDLIFE FEDERATION tough, individual has done much to tarnish the luster of a President and his Cabinet that for so Umg appeared to walk the straight and narrow. Though angered at the actions of his employee, Bush was no doubt embarrassed more than anything. A harsh reality of being under public scrutiny is that even in tile best of times, the press will always forge ahead to find one inadequacy that warrants illumination. Unfortunately, Sununu's blunder comes at a time when Americans were very content with the powers that be. Coming off of an inspiring war victory in the Middle East, President Bush had to deal with covering and explaining for Sununu, a task that couldn't have been appealing. Bush, more than anything, would have liked to ride his post-war popularity to its limit~ at once maintaining his positive rapport with the public sector TL.e· ~;::1-1 .·- while conti11ually building a fo·undation i:n his bid for re- election in 1992. Speaking of the imminent national ele.ction, there has been much discussion over the possibility <>f Bush selecting another person to be his Vice- Time after time the Chief Exe~utive has backed Qua,Yie, and some are beginning to ask whether or 11ot he wants to defend Quayle for another four years. President come next year. Dan Quayle has suffered through an extremely trying tenn in office - he has been ridiculed and targeted as a man of relative youth who laclcs the energy and personality t<J be an effective leader. Many writers and members of the press have been outspoken in denouncing every facet of QuayLe's make-up; and once again President Bush has attempted to ~cQme to the aid of his slighted companion. Time after time the Chief Executive has backed ·Quayle, and some are beginning to ask the question of whether or not he wants to defend Quayle for another four years. There would be numerous legacies and consequences if Bush decided to replace his twq-man with a less controversial :tigwe. First and most importantly, Bush would be conceding that he made a mistake in fuis first major decision as President, an admission he would just as soon suppress. Also, the political implications that would surround Quayle's replacement would cause a clamor not only amidst Bush'~ inner circle of leaders but the general constituency as well. Aside from a few minor incid~nts, the Bush administration has progressed and prospered since . 'Thafu r~hl. Dcrit l~ 1t out too far, or its hard to contro\.1\nd hold ti9-}lt, So it wonl flY aTVay.. 1988, The Prcsid~nt, therefore, would do well to take a 'don't fix it if it isn't broke' attitude. An admission of fault will be nQthing more than a sign of panic t:o the country as a whole. Changing the number two spot ori; the Republican . ticket would only appease the alannist and satisfy the cynics. The bottom line here is simply that finding things wrong with the Bush camp is a difficult task these days. His Chief of Staff took a couple of ski vacations - while it's grounds for punishment, George Bush certainly won't be run out of office for it. Dan Quayle isn't living up to most vice-presidential expectations - we've all known that for a long time now. The press will always forge ahead to find troubles where very few lie. Heed the fact that George Bush surrounds himself with a team that, with very few exceptions, maintains a clean slate. The credit is all his. I r

Please sign up in Student Activities Office, cc. 408. * * * By JASON HABINSKY From 12:00 noon of May 14 until 12:00 noon of May 15, the brothers of Phi Delta Theta completed their annual Softball Marathon. For twenty-four straight hours, the Phi Delta Theta brcthers were challenged by several formidable softball teams comprised generally of Union College students. All proceeds raised by the Softball Marathon were donated directly • to the Schenectady Unit of the American Cancer Society. This year's charitable event was able to amass a considerable amount of money. (Unavailable at press time.) In order to generate such funds, the participating brothers were supported by sponsors who offered to pledge a small sum of money for every inning played by each specific brother. Those who participated in the marathon were able to lend a hand in the fight against the deadly disease. while enjoying endless hours of invigorating and competitive softball action. Perhaps the most memorable highlight of the softball play was Phi Delts' 21-10 thrashing of the Schenectady Gazette in the traditional midnight game. Th.e Phi Delta Theta team dazzled those in attendance with a hitting and fielding exhibition, only to be topped off by a 15 run 4th inning. Most importantly, Phi Delta Theta's Softball Marathon was successful in generating invaluable funds for an ever-so worthy cause. Community Service Chair Jim Paprocki was quite pleased with the results of this year's marathon. \I believe that it is necessary for the Union College community to become involved in such charitable endeavors. Events such as the softball marathon can provide needed assistance to those who · are less fortunate, while providing positive light to the much criticized Greek system.\ Phi Delta Theta would like to thank all of those people who have made this event possible. All Union graduates who plan to attend Albany Law School next year are invited to apply for Saxton, Porter, and Speir Scholarships. Applications will be available until June 15 at the P:olitical Science Dept. Office.

I would once again like to ask for your vote for Junior Trustee. This student body representative to the Board of Trustees is a two- year position which I fully intend to dedicate myself to if elected. The Junior Trustee should be committed to the student body, and be an effective liaison between the Board and students. I feel I have the commitment and ability to bring students' views and concerns to the Board and return to the students with the decisions of the Board. My interest in and knowledge of Union is apparent through my involvement around campus: as an intern in the Annual Fund Office, A Gateskeeper, an Orientation Advisor, and in my sorority. It is in the best interest of the entire Union community if student concerns are expressed and acted upon. If elected to Junior Trustee, I plan to best represent the student body in the decision making process that will best benefit Union for us NOW and for those who will take our place in the FUTURE.

However, there is a Run-Off Election for the Junior Trustee position this Friday, May 24, and once more I wiil need your support The Office of Junior Representative to the Board of Trustees is the most important position in Student Government. I would like to take this opportunity to inform you about the position. First, it serves as a direct line to the BOARD OF TRUSTEES. The position holds a .fu II vote with regards to all issues before the Board. Second, it is a two year term. Third, the entire Student Body votes for this position. On Friday, May 24, you must elect a student to best serve our interests. It is imperative that all Union students havae a leader informing them about the various issues facing this campus now and in the futme. Moreover, we need a leader not only conveying our feelings about those issues to the Board of Trustees, but also a leader conveying the feelings of the Board membeFS oo the students. It is important that you know I am Pro-Student because of my involvement in many student activities and because of my involvement in the Greek System. Simply, all Union students must be represented in the best possible way, particularly with major changes already taking place. It is vital. I believe that my credentials qualify me for the Junior Trustee position. At home, I have worked with various Congressmen and was invited to speak about peer pressure by my local police department at elementary schools. At Union, I am a Regional Director of Ambassadors, member of the General Education Board-- assisting in the determination of the future use of what once was the Beta Theta Pi Residence, a \Union Today\ Alumni Host for the $150 million Bicentennial Campaign, and involved in athletics. Most importantly, my relationship with Norton Reamer, Chairman of the Board of Trustees due to working with him during Spring term gives me a significant advantage for this position. I will be an effective member of the Board. Elect JOE PECORA your Junior Trustee, Friday, May 24. Thank you. VOTE ' • Friday, May 24 9 a.m. - 3 p.m. JUNIORS DID YOU MISS IT?

I do want to especially thank Dean Alford for attending .the evening's events; it is nice to know that one administrator doesn't just talk about things. he stands behind what he believes in. As for student participation in attending the show, it was \Administrators want to bring the world to Union, but not at International Nite .. \ pathetic. Only a mere handful of people intended to come to the show and a few stragglers stOppped on their way through the college center. Even those who came to the Dutch Hollow for dinner did not watch; they chose to sit in the \pit\ and other areas behind where the show was taking place instead of enjoying the entertainment. Thanks to the 20 or so students who did come to support us in the show. What bothers me is that the college community has many students who complain that thee is no social alternative to the fraternities, and here was a free non-Greek social event, but where were they? The show was earlier enough in the evening that people could have come to it and still gone out afterwards. It is sad that there is so little support for fellow students here at Union. If I sound angry, it's because I am. There was so much time and effort put into planning the show. Linh Duong, co-chair of the International Student Union was the main person who made the evening possible. Many volunteers took their own time to get costumes and prepare music and scripts so that the audience would share a beautiful cultural experience. Thanks to Lisa Plotnik who was the master of ceremonies for the evening.

There's little incentive t() teach tons of material when the ultimate measure is based on p-otential and not the specific classwork. AP tests are on the right track with this, but, according to Lynne Cheney, chairwoman of the National Endowment for the Humanities, in the May 20 is:Sue of the New York Times, \[An advanced Placement test] is taken by only Professor Staff about 7% of American students.\ We watch it on Letterman, we see it in the papers, we hear it on the streets, the damned Japanese are advanced way beyond us and are buying up everything we have. While I don't see it this way, I understand the fear that people have of our country being taken over by another people, another culture, another country. Instead of being racist or resentful or insulting, maybe we could learn some lessons from the succcesses of the Japanese (and other) education system(s). Instead of sulking and wishing that our college graduates were smarter and more efficient, why not try new methods to improve their work habits?

The team members were: Vicki Sardi, Kristin Lupoli. Lai Horn, Marisa Purpora. Bruce Patryn, Pete Brown, Mike Scaccia, Larae Tumidajewicz, Christina Horaz, and Andrey Fyodorov. The captain for the team was Leah Sebesta. The team was off to a good start, taking second place in the banner competition with their global absolut bottle logo done in air brushing by Alex Horaz .. Christina, Larae, Pete, and Andrey had their mouths full as they were the chosen ones to suck up a.ll the jello they could. Next was the relay race, one of our best events of the day. Everyone pushed themselves running backward, hopping, crabwalking, doing cartwheels, and the somersaults. A special recognition and thanks goes out to Pete and Andrey who volunteered to do somersaults across the field immediately following all that jello; they exemplified the true meaning of determination in sportsmanship. The orange pass from chin to chin was a big success. Ollf floor really \bonded\ together on this and we came in first. Then it was time for mass hysteria, where everyone throws their shoes into a big. pile in the center of the field. Each member must run to the middle put on his or her shoes and run to the other side. We could not find Audrey for this event; he was off with his camcorder scanning the chicks. Once we found him and explained what he had to do, we were prepared. Although we pushed ourselves hard for this event, we did not succeed in winning it. Another one of our favorite events was the 5-legged race. The team roared with power and strength as we stormed across the field to a near first place victory. The water balloon toss followed.

8 aJonr:orbtrnsf.s EI\IVIRDNMEI\IT May 23, 1991 One Deal That Was Too Good For Exxon ' ' • ' ' • ' • t \ • • •• .~ • • ~ • ~ ' • • • '~ ' • - ' ' • ' ., Women's Union Filni Seri!e:s It may be the world's biggest oil compamy, but Exxon could learn a trick or two f:ram a common street crimi11al: if there's one thing a judge wants to see when a miscreant takes a plea, it's remorse. Yet in March, right after Exx!i>n agreed to pay a fine of $100 million to settle criminal misdemeanor charges arising out of the gigantic oil spill in Alaska's Prince William Sound, chairman Lawrence Rawl showed anything but. He told a news conference fllat the agreement, along with tile deal to pay an additional $I billion over 10 plus years to settle civil charges filed by the state ancl federal govemments, \looks pretty good to us ... It will not have a si~~n ificant effect on our earnings.\ The corporate braggadocio did, however, have a si<~nificant effect on the federal district judge in Anchorage. U1st week Judge H. Russel \Holland rejected the settlement, writing that the fines-- the largest ever proposed for environmental crime-- \do not adeCfuately achieve deterrence (and suggest) ... that spills ue a cost of business that can be absorbed.\ Officials at the -- J nstice Department, who SJ)ent two months hammering out the criminal plea in the h<Jpe of avoiding a long a11d costly trial, cite Rawl's comments for helping to scuttle the deal. But other arguements swayed the judge, too. Tax laws would have cut Exxons' out of pocket costs on the $1. 1 bill ion Thank settlement to $440 million, according to the Congressional Research Service. Since the plea included an unusual provision for the public to offer its views on the proposed settlement, critics deluged Holland, a politically conservative Reagan appointee, with letters charging that Exxon was ·getting off too easy. Salmon Catch: Much of their dissatisfaction turned on how dirty Prince William Sound remained. Exxon claimed in March that the \plant animal and sea life are healthy and abundant, the water is clean and the area is well on its way to a robust recovery.\ It also noted that the hydrocarbon concentration is below the maximum allowed in drinking water and that last summer's pink-salmon catch of 44.2 million fish shattered the previous record of 29.2 million. Environmentalists didn't buy that. \The beaches may 'look better, but if you dig a hole you can find smelly pockets of black ooze,\ says Eric Jorgensen, an attorney with the Sierra Club Legal Defense Fund in Alaska. Other facts were hard to come by. On 1awyer's orders, the data from most of the studies assessing the condition of Prince William Sound remain sealed. But in early April, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration released a synopsis of some findings. They concluded that You Campus Operations For Your Efforts on Recycling! The Recycling Committee ~ . . .: ' .., . : . . ~ ~ . ' ~ ' environmental damage was more lethal and pervasive than Exxon claimed: between 3,500 and 5,500 sea otters, and as many as 580,000 birds, were killed. Some species of kelp in coves were decimated, imperiling the foGd chain. Economists put the damage at $3 billion to $5 billion. Judge Holland gave Exxon 30 days to decide whether to renegotiate a deal, to stand by its guilty plea (which leaves it liable to up to $700 million in fines) or take its chance with a trial. Last year, in the only trial growing out of the accident, an Alaska jury acquitted tanker captain Joseph Hazelwood of all serious charges and convicted him only of negligence, a misdemeanor. Holland's decision also threw into doubt the $1 billion civil settlement: it made some state legislators think they can cut a better deal. They'd like to open the secret scientific studies and wring more money out of the company. Exxon itself has until next week to pull out of the agreement and go to trial in the government's civil case. But that option will worry both its corporate counsel and treasurer, for there is virtually no limit on the amount a jury might award when the target has deep pockets. Last week at its annual meeting, Exxon reported first-quarter profits of $2.24 billon, the largest for the company since John D. Rockefeller organized it in 1882.

EI\IVIRDI\IMEI\IT 4tomr.Ditn.sis 9 Toxic Chemical Pollution Down By PAUL OVERBERG Washington -US manufacturers apparently are reducing toxic chemical pollution, the Environmental Protection Agency .reported Thursday in releasing figures for 1989. The report shows 5.7 billion pounds of 320 ~hemicals were released into the environment. The total was down 11 percent from 1988 and 18 percent from 1987. Agency officials said they were cautiously optimistic that the drop is real, and not just an improvement of estimates or other technical factors. But environmentalists said the report should be widened because it covers only a fraction of the nation's overall toxic chemical pollution. Agency officials acknowledged the limitations, especially where manufacturers submit estimates. \It is clear that to some extent there are refinements in the way people are estimating releases, \ said Mark Greenwood, ·the head of the agency's Office of Toxic Substances. But he said emissions dropped between 1987 and 1989 despite production that rose by several percentage points in most industries. Between 1897 and 1989, air emissions dropped 8 percent; water emissions dropped 54 percent; land dumping dropped 39 percent; and discharges to sewage plants dropped 11 percent. Greenwood also cited a 1990 law that will require disclosure of manufacturers' pollution reduction plans beginning next year. Thursday's report covers just the third year of data collected under the law, but already 13 states have built it into their own anti-pollution laws. Maine and Washington state have required phased in :reduction in reported emissions. BiJls to update two major federal anti-pollution laws - covering water and solid waste - would require the same kind of across-the-board reductions. Thai trend requires that all sources of toxic pollution be identified, said Sen. Frank Lautenber, D. N.J., who with Sen. Dave Durenberger, R-Minn., Thursday endorsed a new campaign by 16 advocacy and environmental groups to broaden the inventory. \Information is not a substitute for regulation, but it can help speed things along,\ said Deborah-Sheiman of the Natural Resources Defense Council, an author of the report. It highlights billions of pounds of pollution released each year but not reported under the law. Some of the pollution is chemicals regulated under other laws but not by the one requiring the toxic chemical inventory. Reprinted from the Poughkeepsie Journal The passenger pigeon. The heath hen.

Not Working for the Nature of TomorrowlM NATIONAl WILDLIFE FEDERATION Will We Succeed In Saving Our Pla·net? By ISABEL C. LIRIANO Environmental Editor Most of us know that the biggest environmental problems we have facing us now are the greenhouse effect and the depletion of the ozone layer. The Greenhouse Effect: Heat tapping gases in the abnosphere gradually warm up the earth's surface. Ozone Depletion : CFCs (choloro-fluorocargons) destroy ozone in the stratosphere, allowing mme ultraviolet radiation to reach the surface. One of the ways in which the greenhouse effect can be prevented, is by reducing emissions of the gases that trap heat in the atmosphre. For exampJe, carbon dioxide is released into the air when coal,oil and natural gases bum. This together with CFCs, solvents, and foam blowing agents cause a major chomp in the ozone layer. Greenhouse gases can be cut substantially without making people suffer. Many people do not realize that by rducing emissions, such as making buildings, machines, and cars more energy efficient, we would actually save more than just energy. Yet many people refuse to believe this. Society has come to believe that to making things better takes too much .of what they cannot or will not give. Unfortunately energy efficiency has been too much equated with sacrifice. National Research Council (NRC) scientests have ideas of using goo-engineering to defuse the greenhouse effect and bag some rays. The Possible Solutions? 1. Let loose bilJions of aluminized, hydrogen filled balloons into the stratosphere to .reflect sunlight. 2. Fire dust filled shells into the upper atmosphere to create a sunlight-reflecting layer of particles. 3. Deliberately pollute the atmosphere with a layer of sro~ which blocks sunlight. 4. Install infrared lasers to zap rising CFCs causing them to harmlessly ran out of the atmosphere. 5. Orbit mirrors to deflect'\ the sun's rays. These could very weJI be solutions: however, they can create other problems such as political and agricultural. This e:xperiment can become a risky business, considering that even the Environmental Protection Agency has its doubts about whether it will work. To them, this is a very serious problem since the vanishing ozone layer has been disappearing twice as fast as was expected. According to environmentalists this needs to be more than just an e:xperiment by the (NRC) National Research Council because there is a 12% ozone loss predicted over the next 20 years and an accompanying 20()~000 more skin-cancer deaths. • • ' t - ' • • • • • ~ . .

EDITORIAL ClLnnrnrhfrnsis ----Founded at Union College 1877--- Student Apathy Resurfaces At The Election Booth The turnout for the Student Forum elections last Friday was less than impressive, 'lending support to those who criticize Union's student body with cries of apathy. The actual numbers are disheartening. Only 707 students overall, 34% of the student body, found it necessary to take a couple of minutes to vote. Most upsetting was the senior class, probably the group who best knows what kind of leaders the students need: only 123 seniors voted. One could be more understanding if the process of voting was a long one or if it was in some inconvenient location like the fieldhouse. However, neither of these possible explanations applies. The voting took place in the College Center over a six-hour period. Because of the College Center's, centrality, practically every enrolled student walked by the elections booth at least once during voting hours. Yet, only a third of them stopped to vote. \ Even worse was the outrageous lack of candidates for several positions. The race for Junior Representative was hardly a fierce competition, with only two people running for the three positions. Similarly frustrating was the shortage of candidates for the newly created Alumni Council positions. The unbelievable indifference of the student body to the elections is the highest form of hypocrisy in a school where the students constantly complain about their lack of power. How can the students expect the Student Forum to have any influence on the Administration when it doesn't even have support from its fellow students? How can the students expect to have strong and intelligent leadership when there aren't enough candidates to fill the positions available? Only when the Student Forum has the support of the students will it be able to reach its full potential as a strong and influential representative body. Anti-Semitism Lingers On The unfortunate incident which transpired at Psi Upsilon last weekend can be characterized as a blatant display of the widespread anti-Semitism w~ich permeates this campus. In short, the occurrence ts a sheer and utter outrage. Although one might be quick to condone the curre~t brothers of the Psi Upsilon fraternity for their pubhc reproachment of the bigotry displayed by their fello~ alumni, one is merely compelled to address the anti- Semitism which irrefutably runs rampant among numerous undergraduate students at Union College. Hatred of a people, be they an ethnic group, a religious group, or a racial group, survives ~mong the misinformed, the ignorant, and those wtth whom contact with the targeted group does not exist, or exists tangentially. This abhorrence was implicitly reflected at Psi Upsilon on Friday evening. The stereotypes which have been passed dow~ fr?m individuals blur to disintegrate when contmumg relationships between peoples commence and continue in that manner, unless the interacting parties can see that the stereotypes have little or no validity. Unlike their older counterparts, the existent members of P~i Upsilon are auspiciously a vivid portrayal of thts exception. By the same token, it is rejuvenating to see that a fraternity, once deemed an anti-Semitic house, has reassessed its posture and has not only ceased to portray its former typecast, but has also made a concerted and coherent effort to reprobate those who continue to behave in such an inexcusable an opprobrious manner.. . . . As for the lingenng antt-Semltes on the Umon College campus, their offensive behavior is both repugnant and repulsiv~. ~oreover, the~r blat~nt disregard for the very pnnctples upon whtch Umon College was founded, is reprehensible and s'hould be deplored.

Semitism Dear Union College Community, and most especially the Jewish members of this Community: At a time when our fraternity should. have been strengthening its brotherhood bonds, and celebrating a Banquet weekend with fellow alumni, brothers and new plooges, it has come to my attention that instead, immature and disrespectful behavior prevailed.

EDITORIAL <!rnnrorbirnsis -----Founded at Union College 1877--- Student Apathy Resurfaces At The Election Booth The turnout for the Student Forum elections last Friday was less than impressive, lending support to those who criticize Union's student body with cries of apathy. The actual numbers are disheartening. Only 707 students overall, 34% of the student body, found it necessary to take a couple of minutes to vote. Most upsetting was the senior class, probably the group who best knows what kind of leaders the students need: only 123 seniors voted. One could be more understanding if the process of voting was a long one or if it was in some inconvenient location like the fieldhouse. However, neither of these possible explanations applies. The voting took place in the College Center over a six-hour period. Because of the College Center's centrality, practically every enrolled student walked by the elections booth at least once during voting hours. Yet, only a third of them stopped to vote. ... Even worse was the outrageous lack of candidates for several positions. The race for Junior Representative was hardly a fierce competition, with only two people running for the three positions. Similarly frustrating was the shortage of candidates for the newly created Alumni Council positions. The unbelievable indifference of the student body to the elections is the highest form of hypocrisy in a school where the students constantly complain about their lack of power. How can the students expect the Student Forum to have any influence on the Administration when it doesn't even have support from its fellow stude11ts? How can the students expect to have strong and intelligent leadership when there aren't enough candidates to fill the positions available? Only when the Student Forum has the support of the students will it be able to reach its full potential as a strong and influential representative body.

' • ' ••• '. \•'' \I LEIIER!i Something New Under The Sun Fall Term Academic Calendar, 1991-96 To the Class of '91; Springtime is not only a period of admiration for nature's beauty, but also a symbol of life's fragility. As your class moves on in life, one nopes that the friends and acquaintances of Dylan Kelley and Simon Nottidge will net leave their memories of these men behind. Though the two deaths produced more questions than can be answered, one still does not stop asking why? Author Harold S. Kushner offers a comforting perspective when he talks about Homer's Odyssey: \We come to realize that Calypso envies Ulysses because be will not live forever. His life becomes ·more full of meaning, his every decision is more significant, precisely because his time is limited, and what he chooses to do wi~h it represents a real choice.\ Kushner further states that without death \humanity would be deprived of that-sense of a fresh start, that potential for something new under the sun ... \ and isn't that what spring is all about? Simon Nouidge's former roommate, Robert Ackerman (former member of class of '91) Marblehead, MA Support For Bangledesh After digesting some of the concerns registered by faculty, staff and students, the 5- Year Calendar Committee made several adjustments in last year's proposal. The \new\ version was submitted to the former p:r:esident of the College late ,last spring, but no official action was taken. Several more concerns were raised and after a few more discussions the Calendar was accepted by the adminstration early in the spring of this year. The committee consisting of students, faculty, and administrators adjusted the previous proposal to allow for a later starting date in two of the years in the five year window. In order to do that, however. it was necessary to suggest that some finals be offered over a weekend. These exams would be given Saturday night and/or late Sunday afternoon so as not to conflict with religious observances. Consequently, the present calendar .provides for a longer summer break on average than did the earlier proposed calendar, i.e., both· calendar years 1991 and 1994 begin ten days later than was first prop()sed. These adjustments were made in response to some faculty upset over the average length of the summer breals. The new calendar permits a Thank:sgi ving dismissal in four of the next five years. A concern of students was t:lle expense of the Thanksgivillg trip home only a week or :!;o before they returned for tile winter vacation. This was seen as a particular burden lor students with less funds a.nd those that would have to travel great distances to be with family during a Thanksgiving recess. This concern is magnified by our plan ~t() recruit students from a wider geographical area. The calendar minimized Jewish Holy Day disruptions, i.e., students will be on campus early enough to allow the College to as~ist them in finding local horne hosptality if they wish it, and there is no direct conflict between Jewish Holy Days llnd freshman registration or tile first day of classes. The calendar also considers administrative concerns abo11t a prolonged isolation of athletes on the campus. Athletes rn11st arrive early both for F.dl preparation and the playing ()f league games in early September. The committee and the Athletic Director agreed that that it would be best for these students to experience a \nonnal\ academic and social atmosphere earlier rather than later. The calendar represents our best effort to balance a variety of important concerns. We realize that no one group is getting all that it wants-- the plan is a compromise. Many committee members believe that a serious and more comprehensive discussion of a future calendar should begin shortly. There remain a number of unresolved issues. For example, both faculty and students appear to be upset over the gruelling demands of a winter/spring schedule that keeps us going for 22 weeks (with less than a week break). The 5- Year Committee only addressed the Fall term issues, it is up to another committee to tackle the whole academic calendar. To the Editors: We would like to thank the Union College community for their generosity and support in amassing donations for the Bangladesh Relief Fund. Students, faculty. alumni, and parents have donated over $1,800 in cash. More importantly, we appreciate the emotional support and concern. We would especailly like to acknowledge the large donations given to the fund by the brothers of Delta Phi, the sisters of Delta Gamma. and tile members of Kappa Alpha. All proceeds have been hand- delivered to the person in charge of the relief committee and will be shipped directly to Bangladesh. Unfortunately, communication lines and transportation have not resumed normal function. However, your concern has been comforting.

She expressed her concern with the Student Forum decision to cut their budget in the 1991-1992 school year. The amount that Big Brothers/ Big Sisters Club will . receive was discussed and decided upon by the Finance Committee and then brought to the Student Forum. The Forum then passed the budget recommended by the Finance Committee. Although the Forum did discuss the budget, they never altered the amount presented by the Finance Committee before it was passed. The reasons for cutting the budget, discussed by the Finance Committee and the Student Forum, were many. They felt that it was not up to the entire student body to pay for all the activities done by the club.

All Wednesday exams prior to Thanksgiving would fini~h by noon. This year, the Finance Committee was working with lire same amount of money and several ·more clubs than previous years. Therefore, many activities had to be cut. The cuts. did not promote a lack vf support for any activity.

All Wednesday exams prior to Thanksgiving would finish by noon. This year, the Finance Committee was working with the same amount of money and several more clubs than previous years. Therefore. many activities had to be cut. The cuts did not promote a lack of support for any activity. However, after lengthy consideration, the committee did feel that certain clubs could continue without an equal amount of funding as they previ(}usly received.

'\With Ginsu, you can cut off tile head of a chid's toy and then cut a tomato just like this.\ Then there were about a hundred knives suspended in mid-air, waiting. I felt like I was in a Tom and Jerry carto<Jn and I had swallowed a magnet, because all of a sudden the knives were magnetically ;;~ttracted to me. In that same h>Ud voice I hear, \But wait, there's more. We've got paring knives, grapefruit knives, and a 12-set of steak knives. Don't forget we specialize in dasser knives.\ What?

He became frightened when my A von Lady in Cosmetic Armor came to my rescue. \Here honey,\ she said. \I've got this wonderful and powerful hair tonic that wiU do just the trick.\ I felt like a new woman.

\') 14 @n.nrnrbirttsi.s ART!i & EI\ITERT AII\IMEI\IT May 23, 1991 De La Soul- De La Soul Is Dead Better Thall Booting By MATT FULLER Jioodo() Gurus - Kinky (RCA) They still know how to really cut loose (\Brainscan\), they jus~ do it less frequently. By RON EUGENIO De Ia Soul- De Ia Soul is Dead (Tommy Boy) Dead on. De Ia Soul answer the question, \How do you top a debut like 3 Feet High and Rising by dying?\ so this collection of 27 tracks (though seven of 'em are less than a minute) could serve as background music to one hip wake. Actually, what the trio killed is their image of day-glo wearing, daisy sniffing wackos from Mars. That era is over. This year's model of the Soul is just as light (songs about rollerskating on Saturday, peas, Burger King, answering machines, Noo.dle-O's, et al.) but this time around they toss venom to \the brothers who didn't have faith;\ posers like M.C. Hammer and Vanilla Ice, and hardcore Jheri Curlers like Easy-E and EPMD. But this is hardly De Ia Firing Squad. Mostly these songs float free, and float home. The surrealistic game show that ran through 3 Foot High •.• is replaced with a children's read-along book that is just as weird, but there's a point to this story; it opens with Vanilla Ice in the limelight and De La Soul in the garbage. The strip ends with the album; the tape is thrown back in the can, and its listeners wonder, \What happened to the pimps? What happened to the guns? What happened to the curse words? That's what rap is all about, right?\ In between these skits are samples that go from the Doors' \Touch Me\ to Frankie Valli's \Gfease\. From Bob Marley's \Could You Be Loved?\ to the children's rhymes \Peas Porridge Hot\ and \The Three Little Pigs\. De Ia Soul would rather rap like Elmer Fudd-- check out \Pease Porridge\-- than brag about their Bozacks. They rap for rap's sake. Which brings us to the songs themselves. Like their improved image, like the rest of the album, the best tracks are kitten-playful with a touch of gristle. The single \Ring Ring Ring\ is about demo tapes handed to them from strangers. \A Roller Skating Horoscopes By Lolli GEMINI: Even though you are looking forward to your summer activities don't forget to think about the present. make sure not to neglect exciting activities this weekend due to your apprehension. CANCER: You are excited for up and corning events that you are honored to attend. Be careful not to party too much that you forget past emotions. ~ely you have been handling situations well but you are \walking on eggshells.\ LEO: You have a whole new heightened self-esteem. That is great and all your friends are excited for you. Don't let it go to your head that you offend other people. VIRGO: Kick back and let others start calling the shots. You have been stressed-out and it has affected your relations with others. Now is a time for repair. LIBRA: You will soon reach a cherished goal. Perhaps this may disturb you because it could wind up to not be what you expected and you will be disappointed. SCORPIO: Are you having a bad influence on others? Maybe you are just trying to give needed advice. Tell someone close to you how you feel and it will make you happy. SAG IT ARIUS: Old relationships may haunt you now. Don't forget your feelings for that special someone and be wary of your future. CAPRICORN: You have been facing a difficult decision lately: You must make your choice soon. Think twice and make sure you ae not cutting off your nose to spite your face. AQUARIUS: You have been lucky in love lately. Count your blessings and keep your head about you. Don't get frantic and your good fortune will continue. PISCES: You have been held back by a loved one lately. Free yourself and do as your heart desires for these last few weeks. Yon deserve it. AIRES: Your emotions have been flairing lately. Take a step back and make sure you think before you speak. The price would be a real high. T ARIUS: THese days having fun is up to you. Be sure you are fitting in all those people who are important to you. Good luck academically this week. If you forgot to get a Parents' Weekend T-Shirt you can still buy one at the bookstore for $6.00 Jam Named Saturdays\ is a joyous '70s disco groove that delights (no pun intended) in weekends. \My Brother's a Basehead\ is a true story. De la Grow perhaps? \Keeping the Faith\ is the last song and no ' I > Its not sampled from Billy Joel. It's a reaffirmation that De Ia Soul isn't really dead. Just Silly. It seems sophomore slumps don't exist in rap: L.L. Cool J's Bigger and Def\fer swaggered harder than Radio, M.C. Hammer's second sold more (through the eyes of Hammer, success is equated with dollar signs), and Public Enemy's so-called slump album was lt Takes A Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back. Enough said. For De la Soul Is Dead, it serves as untouchable fare, an escape, an extension, and a reflection on how far rap has gone in the course of four years or so. When my packed car leaves this place, once and for all, this tape will most likely be playing in my deck. Seems fitting. Weekend Movie HAMLET 7, 9, 11 p.m. cc Auditorium A UNION of · ALL PEOPLES After their 1989 release Magnum Cum Louder, The Hoodoo Gurus simply anished oat of existence. While songs such as \Come Anytime\ and \Another World\ scored bigh on alternative charts across the country, :i:t was not eaough to land them a major tour. After almost two years of small club dates and studio work, the Gurus are back witha great album. Kinky may be the break that the Gurus have been waitibg for. It's got elements of Magnum Cum Louder combined with some toned- down pieces. Wide definitely more refined than its predecessor, Kinky still retains all of the Guru's energy. Out for Justice Stone Cold A Kiss Before Dying Oscar \Miss Freelove '69\ the current single, has a nice, mellow funk flavor. Whether it based on a relation of theirs or is fictional is beyond me. How would you like to meet the person who won that award? \1000 Miles Away\ and \Head in the Sand\ both have single potential, and will catch on with some airplay. \I Don't Mind\ is a track reminiscent of their old days. Faulkner's unique vocals turn this into (in my humble opinion) the best track here. I could go on all day about these songs. since they are all e~cellent-- but I'll spare you. Ptck up Kinky and take a listen. You'll like what you hear. Also. if they go on tour, catch them! I give it 4.25 leather whips (out of 5). Mannequin II 'Vhat About Bob?

·:· ... May 23, 1991 ARTS &. EI\ITERT AII\IMEI\IT . ' * Special Summer Movie Preview * By NED WALLEY Associate Arts Editor The beautiful summer weather that is finally upon us (knock on wood) is a sign of the approach of the end of another school year. We will all have more free time. So, O~ly the Lonely Officer Dann~ Muldoon is a lonely. good-hearted Chicago cop who finally finds true love when he meets Theresa Luna, the shy daughter of a local mortician. Unfortunately, their romance has a dramatic effect on Danny's relationship with his -cantankerous, overbearing widowed mother, Rose, with whom he has spent his whole life. This outspoken Irish immigrant feels threatened by the new woman with whom she must compete for Danny's attention. She responds by tightening the apron strings around her son's emotions, which only complicates his affair with Theresa. As Danny's relationship with his mother begins to sour. his guilt evokes a series of comical fantasies, all of which portray her life in grave danger. A John Hughes Production of a Chris Columbus Film, \Only the Lonely\ stars John Candy as Danny, Maureen O'Hara (returning to the screen after an absence of almost twenty years) as Rose and Ally Sheedy as Theresa. Also starring are James Belushi, Kevin Dunn, Bert Remsen, Milo O'Shea and Anthony Quinn. the geniuses in Hollywood decide to bombard us with a plethora of hopeful box office smashes. With summer movie season almost upon us, I have compiled a few press Feleases we 'have received so you can choose which ones you would like to see (if any). Point Break Johnny Utah (Keanu Reeves) is a rogue, a rebel. Always looking for the edge, always living on it. When injuries kill a .promising pro football career, he joins the FBI, and the Bureau transfers him from the midwest to Los Angeles, where sun, surf, traffic and smog somehow coexist with New Age music and 20th Century spirituality. Assigned to investigate a near-perfect string of bank robberies, special agent Utah takes a lead from his partner (Gary Busey) and goes Wldercover among the maverick fringe who surf off the Southern California coast There for the first time he meets his match: a mystical mastermind who personifies the union of mind, body and spirit. Bodhi (Patrick Swayze) proves to be a dangerous teacher, one who-·shows the young FBI agent a whole new way of looking at the world; and himself. Now as Johnny Utah stalks his quarry, in an escalating series of explosive encounters, he will learn the truth of Bodhi's most important lesson: If you want the ultimate thrill, you have to be prepared to pay the ultimate price.

He's to pick 11p his girlfriend's son, Doyle, at an Atlanta boarding school and drive him home to Chicago for Thanksgiving. Dutch, an honest, good- hearted man who leases cement trucks for a living, figures the long drive home will give him and Doyle a chance to get acquainted. Unfortunately, Doyle does not share Dutcb•s enthusiasm for the trip~ He is a snobbish. arrogant, blue- blooded adolescent. and he cares little for Dutch or his working- class values. Taken from his sheltered and privileged world, Doyle Standish is going to learn about life in the real world whether he likes it or nat on what turns out to be an extraored.ifutry road trip home. Ed o•Neill stars as Dutch Dooley in \Dutch\, a John Hughes Production of a Peter Faiman Film, written and produced by John Hughes and directed by Peter Faiman (\Crocodile Dtritdee\).

The Super· Louie Kritski is every tenant's worst nightmare: a landlord witbout a shred of conscience. Joe Pesci plays Louis Kritski in \The Super,\ a comedy with heart about a slumlord who is court-ordered to live in 011e of his own decrepit tenements. Repeatedly charged with housing code violations, which he has flagrantly ignored, Kritski is sentenced to house arrest in one of his own buildings. wllere the judge orders him to live until acceptable repairs are m~de. Wheii the·· tenantS, who have never had anyone to complain to about the atrocious conditions in the building, gleefully discover that they have a captive audience, they show Kritski no mercy. And as he gets to kn()w these people and sees how he has made them live, Louie the Super gradually undergoes a transformation from slumlord to human being. Barton Fink In this new comedy from Joel and Ethan Coen, set in Hollywood during the early Forties, John Turturro plays the title character, an earnest New York playwright enjoying overnight fame and critical acclaim for his new play. a celebration of th.e common man. When a movie studio offers him a screenwriting contract, Barton sets aside his qualms about pandering to .a mass audience and moves to Los Angeles, where as a concession to his social conscience he checks into a rather seedy hotel. There, during a brutal heatwave, he struggles to carry out his f'Irst assignment for the studio, despite a terminal case of writer's block and the intrusions of his new neighbor, an affable, talkative salesman named Charlie Meadows (John Goodman) who seems to embody the virtues of the common man. John Turturro and John Goodman star in \Barton Fink,\ also starring John Mahoney, Judy Davis, Jon Polito, Michael Lerner and Tony Shalhoub. The Circle Films Presentation is directed by J oct Coen, produced by Ethan Coenand written by Joel Coen & Ethan Coon. The co- producer is Graham Place, and Ben Barenholtz is the executive producer.

She's looking for a different kind of life, a life with purpose. Victor is a wealthy. educated man who is also trapped, by a debilitating illness and a domineering father. He longs to escape from a life that offers only sickness and isolation. But when Hilary and Victor meet, they come to realize that each has something to give to the other. And that perhaps they are looking for the same thing. A Twentieth Century Fox Production, \Dying Young\ stars Julia Roberts and Campbell Scott and is directed ·by Joel Schumacher (\Flatliners \Cousins \The Lost Boys\).

Vincent D'Onofrio, Colleen Dewhurst and David Selby also star. The co- producer is Duncan Henderson. Wednesday Movie: The World According to Garp 7:30 and 9:30 CC Auditorium The Commitments In his acutely observed, touching and frequently hilarious new film, director Alan Parker chronicles the efforts of a fictitious group of working class Dubliners to form a soul band together: The Commitments. Jimmy Rabbitte is the avid music fan who places an ad in the local press. for a band with a mission, to bring soul to Dublin. He guides and manages the young band as it expands from the original members, Outspan and Derek, to include Dean on sax. Billy on drums, Steven on keyboards, Deco singing lead vocals, Mickah, th.e roadie with the most feared forehead in Dublin, the three girl backing singers, lmelda, Natalie and Bernie, and the enigmatic Joey \The Lips\ Fagan, coach and mentor, who claims to have played trumpet with everyone from James Brown to Otis Redding -- and maybe he did. We follow the band from tlleir shaky beginnings as they fight adversity, and one another, in their attempts to become more accomplished and saccessful. But their mission is mmplicated by that rock 'n' roll demon, sex. In the ensuing m4yhem they achieve their moment of greatness, however fleeting, and each one of them is touched and altered forever by the experience. Hot Shots \Hot Shots!,\ a PAP Inc.

Love Potion #9 It's the ultimate fantasy of every lonely hearted man and woman: a love potion, an etixir so potent that it has the power to make members of the opposite sex fall suddenly and deeply in love with you. Imagine the social implications if such an aphrodisiac were truly to exist. Inspired by the popular Leiber and Stoller tune \Love Potion ·#9,\ versatile screenwriter Dale Launer, the creator of the hit comedies \Ruthless People\ and \Dirty Rotten Scoundrels,\ has crafted a plausible tale based on that novel concept .....

liege 1877 No. 24 Schenectady, New York May 30, 1991 :Second Town Meeting A·s Inconsequential As First by Stephanie F1·ay Eflitor-in-Chief Unlike the fJrSt Union Town meeting held in April, the . second of these now routine open forums could be characterized by a practically empty room comprised of a • small fraction of the college community. While the issues addressed at the meeting held on Tuesday, May 28, were merely a reiteration of this year's already talked out agenda, one found oneself confronted by both contradiction and mitigation of prior statements made by President Roger H. Hull. For example, Hull obliviously dismissed implications of student apathy in light of the fact that only a handful of students actually attended what could have been an constructive and worthwhile meeting ()f the minds. Although Hull reasserted his position concerning the non- · historic chain-linked fence . surrounding the lower Nolt and Seward portion of campus, deeming it both ugly and a poor security measure, he now proposes that the fence be replaced rather than simply destructed announced that while Maxcy House wili indeed ho-u.se various student club offices come fall term, the first floor of the :building possibly may be utilized as a coffeehouse. Other issues that were addressed included cultural diversity in addition to the possible fallout resulting fmm Hull's decision requiring the Admissions Office to exceed the criteria that makes the institution \highy sela:tive\. President Hull at Tuesday's Town Meeting However, Hull appears to be waiting to hear from his wide array of committees formed to examine a wide slough of issues pertinent to the college community. Until then, it would appear that Hull will continue to publicly perceive Union College according to his politically convenient, uni- formed image. Shelly Szymko Chosen As Watson Fellowship Winner by Lisa Hofbauer The Watson Fellowship is a program designed to help graduating seniors achieve a goal that they never could have without the program's help. The winners are offered a year . abroad in any countries they wish, in which they are to explore a certain interest they might hav€?. The current value of the ~a~ol'\-~Fellowship is $13,000. T-he current Union winner of the program is Shelly Szymko, '91. Shelly is planning on travelling to Yugoslavia, Poland and Hungary to study the integration of capitalist ideas and socialist ideology. She was chosen from the four finalists at Union. Union also had an alternate winner, Alan Eisenberg, who would have been awarded a fellowship if someone were unable to go on the year abroad. The two other finalists were Hans Schwartz and Edgar Letriz. The Watson Fellowship is offered at about 50 small liberal arts colleges, such as Middlebury, Wiliams and Hamilton.

May of 1989 witnessed the eviction from campus of the Delta Chi fraternity, while last spring Beta Theta Pi was given permanenfoff-carnpus housing privileges. Now as the spring of 1991 comes to an end, four fraternities, Delta Phi, Beta Theta Pi, Psi Upsilon, and Zeta Beta Tau, are each finding themselves to be the focus of investigations conducted by the Union College administraton. As reported by Concordiensis two weeks ago, the administration has been conducting an investigation of the Delta Phi fraternity for incidents which, according to Dean of Students, Joseph Marnmola, \involve the use and abuse of alcohol, the careless and irresponsible behavior that flows from that, the treatment of pledges by the fraternity brothers, and the behavior of the pledges in relation to their becoming brothers.\ The investigation, which included interviews with members of Della Phi National, all of the pledges, and some of the brothers, was completed this past week, affirming both the validity and severity of the allegations. The administration has found the Delta Phi fraternity to be guilty of serving a minor, ominous treatment of the pledges, and unacceptable conduct at their social gatherings. In regard to the charge of serving minors, Mammola cited \irresponsible use and behavior\ as major areas for concern. Individually, none of the incidents may stand out as a major violation similar to those which have previously occured on this campus; however, the college is concerned with the pattern of behavior. The administration also found evidence of \possible use of alcohol by an off- campus minor which led to personal consequences for that minor.\ As well, all of the incidents in question took place in the absence of a formally registered party. In passing sentence, the administration has put Delta Phi on indefinite social probation. The fraternity mtJst review alJ pledge activities · with Dean Alford and make a11 1 \exceptional effort to clean up the house environment.\ As well, the school will continue to work with Delta Phi's alumni advisers and their National, while holdi11g periodic meetings between the officers and the administratio11. Dean Mammola, commenting on how tile school reached a final judgment, stated that the\College took the action it did, after weighing thC' responses which the pledges and brothers gave. As with any investigation, there are always differing points of view. and suffice it to say there were various versions given :in response to the same situation.\ The college is satisfied with the action it has taken. \It is meant to be a formal warning which it fully expects the fraternity to accept,\ remarked Continued on page 3 Scene of the crime.

I\IEW!i AI\IAL Y!il!i May 30, 1991 Racism In America Today By Jim Polites Associate News Editor Discrimination. Prejudice. Bigotry. Inequity. These loaded terms all represent different facets of a burning societal question known universally as racism. For decades now, this issue has remained at the forefront of our political system, always garnering legitimate attention but never making the thrust to complete rectification. Over the past forty years. starting with the Brown vs. Board of Education decision in 1954 that declared school separation was indeed unequal in this country, great strides have been accomplished in the now majority movement to promote equality among races. One effort that has been utilized to highlight the long struggle and plight of blacks in particular, is the national recognition of Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday. Throughout the 1950s and 60s King was an individual symbol of an entire people's oppression and battle for political representation and social freedom. It took much too long to recognize this great individual for his vigor and dedication. As long as his accomplishments eroded in relative obscurity, it was as if America had decided to turn :its collective back on an entire race. Unforttlnately. there are numerous incidents in the United States that indicate many of the problems associated with black discdmination. White supremist organizations like the Klu Klux: Klan, their publicized marches and scathing rhetoric, are a constant reminder that many still believe in a bipolar system of oppression. Even more alarmingly, the mainstream public sector seems to be infiltrated by a class of people who harbor a distu~bing superiority complex. In particular, the episode of police brutality in Los Angeles a few months back exposed to an entire nation the behind-the- scenes acts of violence that are instrumental in constructing racial barriers. We, as a country, have an inherent obligation to provide a society where achievement, advancement, and recognition is based solely on merit, not darkness of skin. For establishments like the KKK, their narrow perception is of white America, period.

STARTING MAY 2() In order to champion.aH of these wrongs that still hover Qrninously overhead, effective, charismatic leaders· must be bred and prepared to ·forge a challenge to inhibitive existing structures. A Martin Luther King or medern day Jesse Jackson does not simply thrust himself into a national spotlight by ehance. These figures, at best, might come around once a generation. In terms of education, a popular and heated point of debate in the United States today, there is also a very distinguishable problem in need of rectification. A recent Newsweek article showed that just 23.5% of black students of college age are enrolled in some type of higher education - the number for whites is some two-and-a-half times greater. This evidence leads directly to the question of whether or not quotas should be used to provide a more racially · balanced national student body. The answer here is a resounding \yes.\ The consensus is that whites are indeed not inherently more intelligent titan blacks, but that their relative scholastic achievement is a direc1 result of weak socio-economic status. Whites .argue that there is reverse discrimination in this measure toward qualified students of their own race. Furthermore, these people think that it is .unfair that they should step aside just to set precedents symbolically prov- ing that we are not a racially divided nation. Undoubtedly, radsm and discrimination is (and well should be) the foremost domestic concern in our country today. Too many expect blacks to take every possible initiative and storm the political and social scene to gain equal acceptance. The problem remains that as· they try to get their collective feet in the door of opportunity, there is always concerted effort, apathy. and bigotry to slam it shut. Those who do not see racism as an issue in dire need of fixing should certainly embark on internal re-evaluation. Maybe then we, as a unified nation, can live up to the esteemed obligations our Constitution calls for. NEXT WEEK: Distordy's Ultimate Game ~ v.our p~\dan \m CPncerned aoollt Y,our activitY l~:ve1.

In what is proving to be another situation of tremendous implications, the Beta Theta Pi fraternity is finding that its \current status and future standing on this campus\ are in jeopardy.

The present brothers of tbe Beta Theta Pi fraternity have been the subject of much criticism from the other Greeks throughout the year, for their alleged \boorish\ behavior on the campus, primarily at parties. Secondly. the fraternity has allegedly refused to cooperate with the administration or tbe Inter-Fraternity Council in Greek related matters. In addition, the Betas have been accused of creating a hostile environment for women during the past week by singing lewd and obscene songs, directed at women in Fox, Davidson, and Richmond dormitories. It is for these reasons that the \college is deeply concerned about the behavior and practices of the Beta ThetiPi fraternity.\ Rich Sgueglia, president of the Beta Theta Pi fraternity believes that the administration is \... blowing it out of proportion.\ He feels that this is just another example of Dean Alford attacking his house. Furthermore Sguegli feels that his fraternity is in \very good standing\ with the IF C. In other Greek news, Fitz Hugh Ludlow weekend was marred this year by the actions of the Psi Upsilon fraternity. Two specific incidents, one concerning a party tent which Chi Psi had erected, and the other a gross display of anti- Semitism, have given the school cause for alarm. The first incident, involving Chi Psi, has already been resolved by the two frternities. With regards to this incident, Dean Mammola stated that \the school is not happy with the event. but restitution and an The investigation which the administration is conducting is seeking, among other things, to uncover whether or not the incident was the working of a few alumni, or in fact, there were current members of Psi Upsilon involved. Whatever the case, the incident has resurfaced negative stereotypes which scar both the school and the fraternity. Lastly, the school is investigating an incident in which a member of the Zeta Beta Tau new \initiate brother\ class smashed a window with bis arms. The incident required an ambulance to rush him to the hospilal where he received an excessive number of stitches. As of now, the school has been told a number of versions as to how and why he did what he did. The college is continuing to investigate the nature of these injuries, as ihc incident continues to be studied. · Overall, the college is very concerned about the \apparently out of control character of some of the (pledge) events\ as well as the unusual number of . incidents stemming from pledging and alcohol, resulting in personal injury. With the clear exception of incidents involving alcohol or potential personal injury, the majority of incidents can be classified as silly and stupid, \the future of the Greeks on this campus depends very much on this kind cf action stopping.\ Further- more, \If it does not, the Greeks will he responsible for their own demise-sooner rather than later.\ ·.·.xt·e·: :JJ..,I;.h .. ·····x,···t····•·.···.· · ' ·.·.~···~.:~. ·. lf,TJ·· . .. · ·.·· .··· ·, .. · •.

Tatiana, a gynecologist, have had to take courses and exams in order to practice in the U.S. Roman has just recently been accredited to practicing psychiatry. Tatiana said that the wait wasn't easy for Roman, tho11gh Tatiana herself works part-time and is taking ·Courses so that she, too, will have the opportunity to practice in the U.S. Their son is in first grade. The Kutsys enjoy their new lives in America and they feel that they will reach their dreams as they had heard they would be able to do even before they left the USSR. \It is wenderful to be free, II said Tatiana, \and to study whatever you want. The opportunities for self-expression and fulfillment are endless.\ The major difference for the Kutsys in reference to practicing Judaism has been the opportunityy to openly announce their beliefs and practice their religion here. \in the USSR, it was absolutely impossible to practice Judaism. There was just one way. Here, in the United States, we have found the true meaning of what it is to be a practicing Jew. The tradition of the faith is .so great here and the holidays are celebrated so brilliantly. This would not have been possible in the USSR and we owe OIJ.l\ thanks to the wonderful experiences that we've had to the hospitable American people and to the Jewish Community Services.\ Putting one's tail between one's legs and sulking all the way home is no way to make a political statement. Being a crybaby and whining to the world how unfair the Olympic Committee is makes a poor political statement as well. Greece isn't at war with anybody. nor vice-versa. Boycotts should be used for times of peril, not times of immature pre-adolescent hotheadedness. (An Opinion by the Associate Editor) I challenge the country of Greece (not that they or anyone else is going to read this) to prove to the world that they are above this sort of first-grade-if-I-don't-get-what-1-want-I'm-going-home mentality and show up in Atlanta in 1996 and give it their best shot. I challenge Greece to accept someone else's decision and live with it. Lastly, I challenge Greece to be mature enough to, in the spirit of the Olympics themselves, to share with other countries the competitive spirit which all of us, all over the world, hold in our hearts. If they are not adult enough to do it, then they should stay home. because the Olympics would be better off witho11t them.

Despite ·the Many Miles Between Our Countries, There Is No Gap In Our Understanding Of One Another by Vicky Mamzeleva and Shelley S:zymko For us. Vicky Mamzelcva and Shelley Szymko. the distance is great between our homelands, the USSR and the United States, respectively, but our understanding of one another and each other's country. customs and people is remarkable. Vicky says, \I am a junior economics major who has developed a strong sense of what it is like to be American. Having spent this year as an exchange student at Union, I understand the American university sy$tem, American youth ~nd American culture. I have enjoyed being here very much. In terms of the people, Americans are very .friendly and hospitable. My roommate and friends are evidence of this. I think that your culture is much less traditional than ours. But this is because we (the Soviets) have a much deeper history, and therefore, our culture has evolved over many yars. We once had czars th-at ruled Russia, and it is this great heritage that accounts for the numerous and elaborate palaces in my country.\ Vicky comments that the family in Russia is a much closer unit than in America. \We (young people) tend to remain close to our immediate relatives .after we get out of college. It is much less popular and it is looked down upon to leave your family and be independent. The family is very sacred and close proximity confers this. One must also remember that in the USSR, housing is a great problem and many young couples live with their parents. My husband and I are an example of this; we live with my in-laws. Please don't forget that there is this silly thing, a propiska (a permit), that allows each person to live only in the town in which he or she was hom. Living with a spouse or relative or finding work in another town is the only chance we have to live in another city.\ \As for American college life,\ Vicky laughs, \it is fun! My friends are great! I enjoy going out to fraternities to dance, but there is too much drinking. It's so crazy! But students here (in the U.S.) have a much more demanding academic schedule than we (Soviet students) have and American youth channel the stress from studying into fraternity life, drinking and partying. Maybe this is good, maybe this is bad. Generally speaking, Americans work a lot more and a .lot more intensely. American life is so fast-paced.\ \I like America very much and hope that I can return here some day. I had hopes of staying in the U.S. next year to get an American college degree, but it looks like this won't work out. I will return to my country on June 19 to finish two years at the University at Odessa, the Ukraine. I do intend. however, to return to the U.S. to go to graduate school. I'd like to get a Masters or Ph.D. to teach Russian here. This is a dream that will become a rality. I have many wonderful American friends who will invite (an invitation to come back to stay with someone is necessary) me back to d1e U.S. and help me. At -this point in time who can tell what will happen? All I know is that I miss my family You are cordially invited to a celebration for and will return home with great memories of America the Beautiful!\ comments Vicky. \Having spent last year as an exchange student in t:he USSR. the most notable difference between America and the USSR, are the vastly different economic systems. We have a capitalist system with free enterprise and ownership, ,profit-making and unlimited consumer goods. There is only state enterprise in the USSR a.nd it is the state that controls productivity. The Soviet :people own nothing and socialist ideology ~tates that no man should live better than the 11ext. The profit motive, therefore, is non-existent,\ Shelley explains. \And it is distribution problems that force Soviet people to wait in food lines. The· Soviet Union has the resources to grow all the food that it wants; it is a lack of technology, lack pf people who want to work hard (because they're tired of not being justly rewarded for their effort), and the poor organization and planning that have caused Soviet economic morass.\ \I love the richness of Soviet culture much more than American culture. Soviet culture combines folklore, a deep connection to religion (whether it be Russian or Ukranianian, Orthodox, Islam, Catholicism or others), economic and political history, along with a paradoxical wish to keep this \old stuff' and bring in West~m ideas and :philosophies and a Western way of life. The manifestation of all these concepts into Soviet culture makes it illteresting and sometimes - confusing as to what Soviets Yvonne Huxhold for her dedicated service ... .to.. \' The Department of Modern Languages and Literatures and to Union College and to wish Yvonne happiness and joy in her retirement Tuesday, June 11 .. 4-6 PM - Milano Lounge Contributions for a gift may be sent to Nancy Edwards in the Terms Abroad Office want from life. As for American culture, it's too trendy for me.\ \My love for the Soviet people is immense because they are so warm and caring. A Soviet person will give you something that he or she treasures very deeply. without thinking how difficult it may be to find or pay for the item. With regards to this example, I find Soviets to be so much less materialistic than Amerians. American mater:ialism is faulted by capitalism, as Soviet scarcity is equally faulted by economic centralization. Soviet people, women in particular, seem to engage with others from the heart, in a very enchanting manner. I find that Vicky possesses this quality, which is reminiscent of days that I spent with my Soviet grandmother and aunts.\ Shelly comments, Soviet university life is much different than it is in the States. Throughout the USSR, university education is for five years and when a student chooses a major, he or she has little, if any. chance to change it. A liberal arts education is non-existent. A student can choose what language he or she wants to study throughout college, but I recall a friend who wanted to switch from studying German to English and it was impossible to do so because of the fact that he made the decision to study German a year earlier. His initial decision was irreversible, even though the opportunity to switch would've enhanced his career pl1ms. I'd also like to say that Soviet education is quite a bit weaker than American education. This is a generality, but I saw too many Soviet students doing nothing (and that ·included course reading) all semester because one exam is given at the end of the semester. There are fewer assignments throughout the tenn and I find that professors don't have a good idea of how a student is doing ia the class. To base a course grade on one exam contradicts with the sytem I was raised with. This was something that I had to deal with.\ My friendships with Soviet students were great. Everyone was enamored with the fact that I was American and of en joked, \Why did you come to my country? Can't you see that we have nothing except food lines?\ I was often asked to trade clothes and tapes with them, we talked about classic as well as American and British rock and about the coming out of Soviet rock and heavy metal.\ \I will most definitely go back to the USSR to visit family and friends and to see how the economy has changed. These two things are most important to me for it is the quality of Soviet life that must be improved upon.\ \All in all. we can say that our understanding of one another is fantastic and that we will not be able to wait until we see each other again. We've had some good times together hanging out in the dorm and at fraternities and working at the Upperclass Dining Hall. We've been there for each other when times have been tough. We feel that we're evidence that the Cold War has ended and that a Soviet-American understanding has been reached. We hope that this understanding between our nations blossoms in the future.\ GOOD NEWS! Foreign language news programs will be shown in the Language Lab (HU 010). All are welcome to attend.

EI\IVIRO·I\J.ME.I\IT May 30, 1991 Belize Creates In Rainforest Reserve COLLOQUIUfl(l Marked by lush mountains, meandering rivers, unexcavate<f Mayan ruins, caves an<! waterfalls, Belize's new Blade11 Nature Reserve is one of the most exceptional rainforest areas i'n Central America. \For a small country, 50 square miles is a lotof acreage-- that's bigger than all other Belizean parks combined,\ says Victor Gonzalez~ of the Interior Ministry.\ ... (Setting this la11d aside) shows the world we're doing something about global warming.\ Belize is a ten-year- old republic on the Caribbean coast. Bladen was established last June after an extensive domestic and international lobbying campaign, with local efforts spearheaded by tile Belize Audubon Society. Eut Gonzalez was first approached about saving the Bladen watershed by the Santa Fe, New Mexico-based LighthaVik, a group which flies policymakers, scientists and journalists over threatened areas via helicopter. In 1988 Lighthawk founder Michael Stewartt flew Belize's former Minister of Natural Resources Dean Lindo, over Bladen, ce>nvincing him to cancel proposed logging concessions which \would have had a devastating effect on thousands of acres of tropical wilderness,\ says Stewartt. \Instead the reserve is now a permanent habitat for hundreds of plant, bird and mammal species, some of which are endangered\ Also involved are the World Parks Endowment, a Washington, DC-based trust providing the financial resources necessary to manage the park; and Manomet Bird Observatory, a Massachusetts- based ornithology research facility. Three years ago Manomet prepared an extensive ecological study, concluding that the Bladen \could become an internationally fam<;>us tourism destination.\ But such conclusions may ignore socio-political realities, says Earth Island Institute'·s Dave Henson, co-coordinator of the Environmental Project on Central America (EPOCA). \If we really want to preserve land in Central America we should be working toward more democratic systems that favor food before profit,\ says Henson. \Ecology groups are slow to catch on to that, thinking it's not their business.\ Judging from studies of similar conservation schemes n nearby Guatemala and Costa Rica, \Landless peasants and Invite one to Dinner At UPPERCLASS DINING Thursday Evening May 29, 1991- 5:00-7:00 PM local economies are too ofen displaced by such effortS,\ says Henson. \Sometimes Western models of preser~ation are imposed without any meaningful imput from the people who will be most affected.\ Gonzalez says that this has not been the case in Belize, which has had an \agressive loc at enviro11men tal movement\ since gaining independence f-rom Britain in 1980. Belize's population density is low, fewer than 200,000 in a ~9untry the size of Massachusetts-- aild Bladen occupies an uninh.~bited area that's too rugged for farming, he says. Down·stream agriculture will be assured. says Gonzalez, who anticipates that jobs \for Belizeans will be· created as low-impact tourism is gradually introduced. Under the reserve's protected status. access is limited to foot-trails, and all development is prohibited. So far, say those involved, Belize had managed to preserve its most ecologically senstive areas without routing any indigenous people from their llomes-- a good example for otber nations to follow.

EDITORIAL . . - -~ .. • (J!llllfllrbirnsis -----Pounded at Union College 1877--- Roger's Rookie R.eview As the end of spring term approaches. one is compelled to reflect upon President Hull's first year at Union College. In short, the year must be categorized as the epitome of political finagling. While Hull started out extremely strong, proposing such appealing, inspiring and unique programs as CAUSE and a mandatory term abroad requirement, his behavior became increasingly contradictory and disappointingly appeasing. Case in point: the president stressed the need for a mandatory term abroad at the commencement of his tenn in office. Now, less than one year later, the administration has toned down its efforts merely calling for increased tenn abroad participation. As the campus community was being bombarded with promises that the decision to join the Division I Hockey League would not affect the academic integrity of the college, the Admissions Office was simultaneously being told to exceed the criteria required for the institution to retain its \highly selective\ status. Although controversial, Hull took a strong position in the Hathaway affair, only tC> subsequently back down in response to faculty and student disenchantment. The list of inconsistencies and idiosyncracies could go on forever. However, the real issue is whether or not the wrong choice was made for the position which Hull now holds. Ironically, in retrospect, if one were to assess his capabilities in tenns of his resume and in accordance with his performance fall tenn, one must conclude that he is indeed the mover and shaker that the position so greatly warranted and that the college community so eagerly awaited. Unfortunately, his performance became less and less impressive as the academic year evolved. While it is true that our displeasure with former President Morris resulted out of stagnancy, one cannot infer that the solution to our dilemma is turmoil and disgust. If Hull's actions over the past two tenns are any indication of what the future holds for Union College, perhaps the student body should give him a graduation of his own C()me Commencement Weekend. The Forgotten Memorial Day Last Monday, as the rest of the United States celebrated Memorial Day and paid homage to the lives of U.S. soldiers killed in war, Union College continued its proud,tradition of ignoring national holidays and everything they stand for. The fact that the school does not in any way attempt to add to the memory of our war-dead is not only disrespectful and unpatriotic, but downright unjust. It is not unjust in that the members of the Union College community have to go to class or work when everyone else they know has the day off. The injustice is done to the soldiers and the families of the soldiers who died in the wars of this country's past. They made huge sacrifices in order to protect freedom and democracy, so that the rest of the world could go on with normal life. In return for their lives, all they wanted was for us to remember them and what they stood for. All of the major corporations in the United States, whose only reasons for existence are economic, take the day off despite the monetary losses. It is unbelievable that an institute of higher education, whose only reason for existence is teaching, theoretically that is, would ignore such an important aspect of American life. What kind of lesson is the school trying to teach its students and employees? Each year, Union College grants diplomas to approximately 500 people who have spent the past four years overlooking their nation's most important holidays. One would think that such a well respected college would cancel class on these days and have special programs. These programs could include speakers and presentations about the meaning of the holiday, just as educational as classes and much more appropriate. The college even has a perfect place to hold these events-- Memorial Chapel, which was specifically dedicated to the war-dead of World War I. So take some time today, on the real Memorial Day (Monday was the otticial day to observe tt) to remember wnat our college would have us forget. Remember those who died fighting and those who sacrificed their loved ones so that freedom could be preserved around the world. Step, just for a minute, out of the sheltered world of Union College and rernern ber. -.- ..... LETTERS -- l,\'lay 30, 1991 Request For Security Precau~ions To the Editors: Late Friday night of May 24, my roommate, Chris Diemand, was viciously jumped and attacked by tbree Schenectady youths~ After leaving a friend's apartment off campus, Chris proceeded to walk along VanWranken Street alone, where he was eventually clubbed over the head and beaten unconscious. He was fortunate enough to escape the incident without serious or permanent injury .. However, this unfortunate event has brought to my mind several serious questions and doubts about this place that we call home for nine months a year. First of all, I have to question the safety of the town of Schenectady. We 'have all heard of incident .after incident of Union students either being harassed or injured by the inhabitants of the town. Is the Schenectady police force competent? Or is it out of their jurisdiction to protect Union students since we invade their town every year from places that are far from Schenectady. Unbelievably enough, an eyewitness did see the incident and reported it to the police. Soon afterwards, the police did actually pick up the three thugs. However, a few days later, when Chris called the police station to ask question conceming the police report he had filed earlier, be was infonned that they had either lost or \'misplaced\ the file. A lot of good that does. I also ·have to ask myself whether the Union College Campus and Security. can help prevent incidents like this. Perhaps the security force of Union can provide some type of surveillance in the· area immediately outside of the locale of our campus. As everyone well knows, a significant percentage of the Union College community either lives off campus or attends social events and parties off ~pus. Because we leave the campos~ does that mean that we give up our right to be protected? Why can't the Union College force patrol or cruise the perimeter of the college on Friday and Saturday nights? It sounds simple enough to me. If the potential derelicts were to see that the streets around the college were well guarded, perhaps they would take their shenanigans elsewhere. Granted the Campus Security and Safety provides a legitimate safe tides service that offers transportation to .those reluctant to walk. However, ·ooe must realize that· it is impossible to provide and convince each and every student to liSe such a service. Therefore, we must be ·protected Finally, I have to qqestion whether it is in the college's best interest to adopt the program of college-community integration as Hull has proposed. What significant transactions will result from such prop0sals as the removal of the Seward Street fence? Will .this trigger an atmosphere of love and affection between campus and community? I d0:n't think so. It :wiU, however, make the campus more susceptible to trespassing and loitering, which will increase the possibility for possible wrongdoing. Why does the administration propose tile conjunction of community IUld college yet beef up security to immeasurable proportions fer each and every campus-wide event? What are they afraid of? Go figure. Respectfully submitted, Jason Habinsky '93 Slave to Alcohol To the Editors: I wish to comment on a sobering editorial which I published in the April 25, 1989 edition of The Union Sentinel, when I was Editor- in-Chief during my sophomore year. The editorial in question contained the following assertion as a lead sentence: \Alcohol-induced drunkenness is intrinsically wrong.\ Mter a lengthy commentary on the campus alcohol policy, in which further moral arguments were raised, I concluded with the following: \Part of the fun of being young is to experience of challenging authority.

CUltltrJlf~tfltSis 11 The Real Story The Genius of Hilary Tann To the Editors: This letter is rega.-ding the article titled \Union Students Apprehend Campus Intruder,\ printed May 23~ 1991. I was curious where the Concordiensis staff received its information. The events reported were not completely accurate. 'The unnamed student involved in the incarceration was Michael Emmi. Roger Smith did ilot \dive on top of the intruder.\ He did push the suspect down to keep him from running. Michael Emmi, the only student in contact with the perpcttator at the time of arrest, jumped the wall and held him down until ;the undercover police officer arrived. Emmi and the officer held him until the clothed police arrived to cuff him. In the future, I would suggest verifying your information before you print it. Isn't that what good reporting is all about??? - An eyewililess! Suzanne Glass To the'Editors: They say a prophet is not recognized in his own land. We as a college community do not fully appreciate or take advantage of the cultural offerings on or off campus. A case in point was the world premiere of Professor Hilary Tann's ccmposition, \Earth and Ayre,\ which was performed at the Pleiades Art Gallery in New York City last · Sunday. Professor Tann is one of the foremost cemposers of our time. Every time I have heard her music, e.g. the \Open Field\ with the Schenectady Symphony, it has been far more than just a concert. It is more like a happening, an awakening of the deepest recesses of one's soul. The work in New York was scored for flute, clarinet and percussion. It had a sense of timelessness that caught you in its vortex, which is impossible to describe. Professor Tann offered a nnique blend of Japanese meditative aspects and the extroverted expression of the Welsh love cf nature. The work seemed to create itself as it went along; it was one of the most captivating experiences of my life. It seemed to have no beginning and nc end! Later I learned that the work was 15 minutes long -- to me it seemed in retrospect. more like 2 minutes! It was a truly moving experience. I hear next April we will have the privilege of hearing it performed on campus. Thank you.

FEATURE& @.onr.nrbirnms 13 Regressing To Her Young Dassling Years by Dass Seaman She took me by the hand and led me to the Mom's clothes place. While she browsed and perused I decided to wander in and out- of the isles created by c,ountless clothes racks. As I walked, my legs grew weary. I began to drag my feet. My eyylids became heavy. The musak was lulling me to sleep. I plopped down at the feet of a mannequin. Gazing up at her, I said, \Hi'!\ No response. \Don't you get bored, too?\ - She just looked straight ahead and smiled a plastic smile.

I glanced around to see if any of the shopping moms noticed, but they didn't seem to hear it. They just kept on doing their \mom\ stuff. I recogniz_ed the music now. To my delight, it was the theme played on my favorite cartoon, \Tarzan Lord of the Jungle\! What happened to my clothes? I was no longer wearing my buster browns, the bell bottoms that my mom had made, or\ my favorite Snoopy turtleneck. Instead I was dressed for safari. I now wore khaki bermudas, shirt, kneesocks, shoes, the whole bit! I even had one of those hats. I was no longer in the Mom's clothes place. I was in Sooth America. All the racks had turned into exotic floral bushes, the mannequins were statues from ancient ruins, and the moms-- they were. the enemy! I was no longer Dass, but Safari Dass, the famous explorer. I had a mission. Treasure, hidden treasure. Yes, and I had to find it without being captured. I had to act quickly. I was ·in the open. they could spot me, capture me, take me to their leader. Then I could be tortured by being brought to the linen and bath towel place. I hit the floor. On hands and knees, I started to crawl-- really low. I could get the rug burn disease, but I have the antidote. So it's okay. I found shelter underneath a circular rack of shirts. I lay there. I was safe for now, I was camoflauged. Alert, eyes darting, I looked for danger. \Oh!\ I gasped. Right in front of me was a pointy pair of heels, Red ones, the're the worst. They're quiet and sly. When you least expect it, one will step on you with its single vicious venomous tooth. Then, you're a goner. I held my breath and the heels slowly withdrew and disappeared behind a counter.

I did a forward roll (that's what Tarzan does) ever to the next closest circular rack. I went underneath the draping blouses. stood up in the center of the rack, and peere(J up and out. I had to observe my surroundings and make a plan. I couldn't really see anything, I was only four feeuall and the silly racks were little taller than me. I went on my ti})pytoes and stretched my neck as long .as I could. I bulged my eyes as if maybe to gain some height. \E:xcuse me. Excuse mel\ something bellowed. It was one of them! I had been discovered! \Little girl, I don't think you should be in there. Where is your Mommy?\ I turned my head to see this red- lipped~ fuming, grey streaked, crincl<ily, crackily, bad breathed mom monster. I scteamed in horror, and went tearing out of the rack, knoclcing several hangers and blouses to the floor. I dove into the wall rack of long winter coats. No cne should find me here. I allowed myself time to catch my breath. I could feel my heart pounding. I was frightened by the monster, yet I was excited by the adventure. I felt a sense of victory because I defied a mom monster and got away with it. My mission, however, was not complete.

14 <!Tonrornftltsi.s FEATURES May 30, 1991 Juniors: Helpful Hints for Winning the Watson By Shelley Szymko As a graduating senior, the most commonly askedquestion is, \So what are you doing ncx.t year?\ Instead ofretorting the usual, \Well I guess I'm going to get a job or go on to grad school,\ take the time to prepare a Watson proposal that will allow you to travel anywhere in the world with S 13,000. It's easy to ,come up widl a proposal if you take your interests and dr.eams and confidence and just go with it! To provide you Juniors with a bit of background, the Watson is a fellowship that allows seventy-five graduating seniors from a variety of cone ges across the U.S. the opportunity to devise a project of their own and to investigate the project in any country, or cC>un tries, that the student wishes. The project can be anything from Work Ethics: Integration of Capitalist Ide:as in to Socialist Ideology in Eastern E 11 r o p e (my project) to illlvestigating amusement parks around the world. The topic sbould: 1.) have personal significance to you and 2.) be able to he easily researched (Lhat is, contacts must be made so that you indeed will not eiicountcr problems in Later? By Andrew R. Rosen And suddenly, he began to dream. He would not remember it tomorrow, but he would wake up to a cold, stench-laden sweat. And he was perplexed; his dream .. mysteriously returned night after night. It was the same dream, always. He could swear he saw the future, a later campus, similar in appearance, yet tilted with abnormal change. 011e day he remembered his dream and wrote it down ... Have you ever walked to class? Just walked. Nobody ever walks any more because they feel the breeze lick their face and spit on their shirts and they are overwhelmed by our most \excellent\ spring. They hurry because that's what we do. We also don't sit in class. We adjust, turn, slide and squirm not because tbe chairs are uncomfortable or lacking the proper orthopedic support but because the blackboard is just that--black, or brown. It would be notorio11s for a school like this to ponder the acquisition of change, i11somuch as our humble dassrooms could tolerate it, of course. We may begin to have a blue blackboard in every building beginning with a consonant whose numerical value in the alphabet is divisible by 7. E. very building following the e::xact advice prescribed above billt adhering to the number 11 would be orange, 3 would be bight, flaming red- of course tbe letter V would be blue instead of red (not all letters need conform to this h:Ypothcsis)- 13 would be green (we need two of those), and with the exception of 26, all others would be divided into four equal divisions of brown, nuuve, purple and turquoise. People would come to class, envisioning this illusionary paradise, following their vision md leaving, dazed, frayed and p11zzled. Well, my friend, if tbey enter the correct room they would enjoy class so earnestly and preciously. They would stare at those black- nay AJtered! boards; pondering the TELECOMMUNICATIONS GIFT CERTIFICATES.

What should you do as you embark upon summer vacation? Start thinking about what you'd like to be doing for a year and where. you'd like to be doing it. Talk with me, the professors on Union's Watson Committee, friends, parents and faculty about your ideas. Perhaps it may be helpful to think of a past foreign travel experience or .to see if there was something :that has always fascinated you but that you've never really asked. Ask yourself why you might want evolution of thought with tenacity and zest. They would question their own beliefs: Is reality a matter of our own perception? Is there truly anything smaller than the quark? Is the scaffolding binding the N ott to its fragile health not a covert coup d'etat planned and executed by the Art's department? Is any athlete truly worth more than $5 million or a free ride? ... the point remains that people (clients? students?) would never miss a session. Of course they wouldn't learn anything, but I don't offer guarantees. How about West Beach? Must we constantly wade through the fresbly cut grass trimmings- cut at exactly 7:00 am to wake everyone- listening to Schenectady's sirens crying down Seward? I offer this proposal: every 9th day in April and every other day in May, we establish that for 10 minutes, each student residing no further east than Schaffer Library carry no more than 3 kilograms of the finest Carribean white beach sand- purchased, of course by. student forum- to West Beach (Chi Psi, Alplla Delta Phi, Psi to learn about this or that and sit on your ideas for a while. Develop contacts by meeting with insightful people, and by calling and writing. The honor of being selected as a Watson Fellow cannot be described as it is one of the most prestigious awards that an undergraduate can receive. The $13,000 award is taxable and is used for any travel or personal expenses for the year. If a Fellow fails to use up his or her entire monetary award, the remainder goes to the Fellow's undergraduate institution and will be added to the following year's award. If the Fellow spends his money before the year is over, the Fellow can Upsilon and members residing in the Memorial Chapel may wish to fight for this right). At the same time., those living no more west than the aforementioned, the same controversy and its suggested solution applying (pre-laws please aid the pre-meds in deciphering these instructions) would need to carry one black fluorescent light to be plugged into every socket in Phi Gamma Delta, Zeta Beta Tau, Phi Sigma Kappa, Delta Delta Delta and the Registrar's office. At Dean Wood's command, all members of West Colle&e, Richmond. North, South/ East and West Colleges (built to accommodate the sudden onslaught of on-campus housing requests), Fox and Davidson (Webster, unfortunately, would not be considered by the administration in this argument) and fiv;e impartial residents of Seward Place apartments would be ordered ento the now luxurious and quite tropical west beach to tan and enjoy Schenectady's fmest weather, be it natural or electric. · use his or her own money to continue the Watson; otherwise, the Watson is over. Upon a Fellow's feturn to the States, he or she must submit a report on his or her findings. The report needn't be long and can include photographs or any other pertinent information relative to the proposal. The year is a Wanderjahr and should be enjoyed, but should also be effectively researched. So Juniors .. .it's time for you to start seriously thinking about what you'd like to do after graduation. I hope that your thoughts will include plans to try for a Watson. Good luck! 'f;here does exist one element of this plan that may cause chaos: where does one obtain beverage. The answer is quite simple. All the students that send their deposit into this school before May 1 preceding their :freshman year receive a special \beach card\ that may now be used only at the freshman dining hall, located at the now reacquired Guiding Center (or the Rathskeller after 9:00p.m.). Each card entitles the,- bearer to one complementary glass of iced Snapple (an introduction fee for the card does not apply). Does this provide an ample solution to a serious problem? If tHe school's curiosity pennits such simple craving, then experimentation is the only mode of conviction. If the administration should forego any of the suggested improvements, maintaining its present course of swift and domineering social improvement, then we must simply accept this campus for whatever it is perceived to be. Writing about stupid and rather odd dreams may be a good start as well. An ad hcc tenurability committee has been formed to review the teaching of Professor Kurt Hollocher. Members of the College Community who wish to contribute information are invited to contact Professor C. Scaife, Chair or any other member of the committee. Committee members are: C.

·., .. May 30, 1991 ART!i & E'I\ITERTAINMEI\IT It's Nott Dead Yet by Julie Medow Arts Editor Contrary to the rumors spreading across Un1on 's campus that the Nott is oat of commission as .a theater come words of hope from Lee Bloomrosen and his directing class. Who spread these nasty rumors? 1 did. I apologize. I think everyone was pteparing for a spring burial, but acccording to Bloomrosen., the Nott's :theater will be witlt us until some time next year. In fact, Bloomrosen and his 10 students .are preparing for \Direct This ... A Weelc of Theater\ which begins on Tuesday, June 4, and runs through Friday, the 7th. All but one of the plays being performed will be seen in the Nott. The students in .the directing class are responsible for two projects throughout the term. The first project, which counted as their midterm, was to direct a scene for \A Night of Scenes\. This event was open for the college community and performed in the Cabaret Room. The :final project is similar but extended: now the students are tacldin.g a full one-act play as opposed to just a scene. Bloomrosen has divided the course into three sections: Out for Justice Stone Cold FIX 2 Oscar Hudson Hawk Mannequin II Home Alone homework, rehearsal, and perfor,mance. Homework is similar to that done in other classes, basically reading texts and doing outside research. In the rehearsals, the students play with what they have learned, and experiment throug·h worki11g with on.e another. But, because \theater is a perfonning art, tests should be performances.\ says Bloomrosen. This makes perfect sense to me. I have looked over the list of plays being performed, and they are great. They range from the 1920s aU the way to the present, with plays such as Baby Witk the Bathwatet by Chrisropher Durang (writer of Beyond Therapy, which was done here in the fall), and Sexual Perversity in Chicago. Interestingly, the tides of the three plays being performed on Friday can be combined into l Can't Imagine a Coupla Chicks Sitting Around Talking About Sexual Perversity in Chicago. Pretty cool, hub?

College Center 1#302 Schenectady. NY For information: (518) 37Q-620l 8 pm Rensselaer County Council for the Arts 189 Second St., Troy, NY For infomution: (518) 273-0552 FREE The Doors: Not just a box-office sell-out by Brendan Pollack Except for the occasional documentary or parody, movies about rock groups never seem to be any good. This doesn't necessarily mean that rock music is a bad thing to base movies around. The Doors, for instance, are certainly a rock groap,. if ever there was one, whose music and aura are rich material for an insightful adaptation. to the medium of film. Particularly. The Doors are rich material for a heavy film in much the same way that Vietnam .and the Italian Mafia are heavy topics in modem film. So why isn't the new \Doors\ movie an audio/visual roller-coaster of apocalypse and fury? ... Because Oliver Stone blew it, that's why. Although director Stone is presumably rich enough to go out on such a limb, he passed over a big opportunity to make really creative, psychologically powerful and introspective film on Jim Morrison and the Doors as pioneer electronic musicians and performers. This is unfortunate because many of the technical aspects of the movie are impresssive and well put together. Also, Val Kilmer malces an exc·ellent Jim Morrison; his screen presence and adaptation to the character are quite convincing. The · Morrison character as it is written into the film, however, focuses too heavily en the soap opera and sensational aspects of his life at the expense of more serious and detailed character development. Stone sacrifices too much to pupular myth and/or personal fantasy by over concentrating on Morrison's self-destructive personality and sex symbol status, Although these are sure seiUing points and a major part of Morrison's persona, it is also most widely evidenced in currently available material by and about the Doors. Would it be interesting to try to discover. for instance, why the biggest American rock saperstar of his day lived almost possessionless and in rela:ti ve squalor? Or. would it be a better gamble to recreate all the famous sexual scenes and back-stage stories in Morrison's life. In writing \The Doors\ Oliver Stone seemed to have the box office in mind instead of prestige as an innovative film maker; no new ground broken here. It is also disappinting that, despite the title of the movie, Stone doesn't pay any attention to the Doors or their music as a whole: the characters of the other Doors are so flat that they detract from other aspects of the movie. Although the many live concert scenes are elaborate and well orchestrated, they fail to capture the more unique and powerful components of the Doors' music and their performances; instead, they 'concentrate on Morrison's machismo and sexy camera shots. During one such scene. in the space of two minutes, the soundtrack melds together parts of three songs for the sole purpose of delivering the climactic crescendo of each song, in rapid succession: what cheese. The film definitely would have ben.efited from one or two deep excursions into a Doors performance and a look at what made them such unique and powerful experiences. For example. the dramatic cycles of build-ap and release in their music or Nietzsche's philosophy of tragedy that lay behind Morrison's conception of audience involvement and excitement For the most part, Stone interprets a Doors performance to a modem MTV, short attention span format instead of taking the opportunity to show how a Doors concert 24 years ago was drastically different from anything on lhe music scene today. \The Doors\ is not a very bad movie but it is a disappointment. Despite the excellent cinematography, Kilmer and Lhe complexity of the concert sequences, the · movie is largely disconnected and vague, packing no real punches at all where there could be a knockout. Aside from an overall boost in Doors nostalgia and associated profits, \The Doors\ doesn't do the Doors, Morrison or the truly interested spectator any justice. It is simple idolatry like a CBS special on Kennedy's Camelot. In five odd minutes of \Apocalypse Now\ Francis Ford Coppola captured the real power of the Doors more effectively than Oliver Stone did in an entire picture. Surprising Echoes - Music Celebrating Nature From the Arts Dept. Jalie Kabat offers a special gift for spring to her home community with Surprising EchGes, a new program of music and light celebrating nature. In two performances, at Union College, Thurs~y.

1 16 <lfJillfllrbttrulis ART§ li, EI\ITERT AJI\IMEI\JT May 30 •· 1 ::J :0:::-:.: !!II ARTS EDITORIAL: A Little Summer Reading Couldn't Hurt This may sound crazy to yo11, b11t I believe that a student's mind tends to atrophy if not at least slightly stimulated over the summer months. I'm not talking heavy duty work-out or anything, but a little beach reading could prevent a dangerous slump from setting in come September. So for your benefit, as well as for the benefit of the professors who must face U11ion College's post-Labor Day sloths, I have compiled a list of potentially educational and definitely inspirational pieces <lf ficHon. Explore your bookstore. Raid your parents' shelves. Go nuts. Short Stories. Many novelists lJegan their careers by writing short pieces for magazines, and many continue to do so even after publishing novels. The New Y ()rker is well known for the quality of the shorts stories it runs weekly, but if you want more than one at a time, there are a good deal of collections to be found. Short stories are good for the sumrner because they don't require the continuous auention span needed f()r novel reading. In one sitting, you can easily take in an enjoyable story without having to save your place or remember what happened in the chapter before. - Kurt Vonnegut's Welcrnrr.e To The Monkey House. Vonnegut is wonderfully inve11tive in the way he portrays life on the planet both now and in the future societies he creates. Stories such as \Harrison Bergeron,\ \'Tomorrow and Tomorrow and Tomorrow,\ and the title story are so out of tilis world crazy, that the underlying truths in them a-e tllat much more biting. There is also a five-page love story to die fer called \The Long Walk To Forever.\ - Jon Cheever's The S11ort Stories of Jon Chee11er. These mostly deal with suburban versus urban life in Westchester and Manhattan in the 195()'s and 60's. Cheever confronts alcoholism, infidelity, and all tile other goodies of modern existence. - J.D. Salinger's Nine Sllort Stories. Although Salinger is known for his novels, this small book of stories is excellent. Every one of them is a perfect little exploration into random situations. Contemporary. This category covers a few great novels written over the last thirty years or so. - Tom Robbins' novels are fast paced and addicting, and they all contain humorous situations and bizarre characters. His most recent novel is Skinny Legs anti All, which recently came out in paperback, but don't limit y()wself to just that one. I highly recommend both Still Lif~ With Woodpecker and Even Cowgirls Get The Blues. - Ken Kesey's One Flew 011er The Cookoo's Nest is a comi-tragic story of life in a mental institution. - Tom Wolfe's novel The Electric Koolaid Acid Test is along the same lines as Kesey's fiction. It isn't \light\ reading, but it's .. uh .. mind expanding. Also consider his latest novel The Bonfire of The Vanities, whjch is about a stock broker whose luck takes a turn for the worst. -Pat Conroy writes wonderflllly and descriptively about pretty screwed up family relationships in his novels which include The Prince of Tides and The Ore11t Santini. - Margaret Atwood is one of rny favorite writers of all times. Her fiction is dense and thought provoking, and her stories revolve around women. Some people disagree with me about Atwood, but I think both The Handmaid's Tale and Cat's Eye are wonderful ... the kind of novels you underline. There are a bunch of writers whose novels I have not read, but they have been recommended to me. I'll list them briefly, but it's up to you to find out more about the subjects, etc. Toni Morrison (Song of S()/omon), Judith Freeman (The Chinchilla Farm), and other writers such as John Barth and Joyce Carol Oats. I don't go in for \spy\ stuff, but if you do, there's always John LeCarre and Tom Clancy. I promised myself I wouldn't recommend anything too cheesy, but sometimes pure fluff is just what the doctor ordered for the summer. I read a romance novel last summer called A Knight In Shining Armour by Jude Devereaux that was actually well written and definitely entertaining. Erica Jong writes novels that border on slime, but who cares as long as they are a cut above Danielle Steele and Jackie C<Jllins. I'm reading Any Woman's Blues (A Novel of Obsession) now, and have heard that Fear OJ Flying is her best. Her latest orle j11st came out in paperback, but I cannot remember the name ofit. Well, that's it for now. I .apologize if I have left anyone's favorite author off my list, but I tried to round up a goQd v-ariety of writing styles and subject matters. Have a great summer. I'll see you when I'm a senior.

I'm not talking heavy duty work-out or anything, but a little beach reading could prevent a dangerous slllmp from setting in come Scptrmbcr. So for your benefit, as well as for the be11efit of the professors who must face Union College's post-Labor Day sloths, I have compiled a list of .potentially educational and definitely inspirational pieces of fiction. Explore your bookstore. Raid your parents' shelves. Go nuts. Short Stories. Many novelists began their careers by writing short pieces for magazines, and many continue to do so even after publishing novels. The New Yorker is well known for the qtulity of the shorts stories it runs weekly, but if you want more than one at a time, there are a good deal of collections to be found. Sllort \tnrics are good for the summer because they don't requi~e the L'Ontinuous attentiOn span needed for novel readillg. In one sitting, you can easily take in an enjoyable story without having t() save your place or remember what happened in the chapter before. - Kurt Vonnegut's Welcome To The Monkey Hollse. Vonnegut is wonderfully inventive in the way :he portrays life on the planet both now and in the future societies he creates. Stories such as \Harrison Bergeron,\ \Tomorrow and Tomorrow and Tomorrow,\ and the title story are so out of this world crazy\ that the underlying truths in them are that much more biting. There is also a five-page love story to die for called \The Long Wall: To Forever.\ • Jon Cheever's The Short Stories fJj Jon Cheever. These mostly deal with suburban versus urban life in Westcllester and Manhattan in the 1950's and 60's. Cheever confmnts alcoholism, infidelity, and all the other goodies of modern existence. • J.D. Salinger's Nine Short Stories. Although Salinger is known for his novels, this small book of stories is excellent. Every one of them is a perfect little exploration into random situations. Contemporary. This category covers a few great novels '-Vritten over the last thir.ty years or so. • Tom Robbins' novels are fast paced and addicting, and they all contain humorous situations and bizarre characters. His most recent novel is Skinny Legs and All, which recently carne out in paperback, but don't limit yourself to just that one. I highly recommend both Still Lift! With Woodpecker and El'en Cowgirls Get The Blues. • Ken Kesey's One Flew Over The C11okoo's Nest is a comi-tragic story of life in a mental institution. • Tom Wolfe's novel The Electric Ko()laid Acid Test is along the same lines as Kesey's fiction. It isn't \light\ rea<ling, but it's .. uh .. mind expanding. Also consider his latest novel The Bonfire of The Vanities, which is about a st<Jck broker whose luck takes a turn for the worst. -Pat Conroy writes wonderfully and descriptively about pretty screwed up family relationships in his novels which inc 1 udc The Prince of Tides and The Great Santini. - Margaret Atwood is one of my favorite writers of all times. Her fiction is dense and thought provoking, and her stories revolve around women. Some people disa!:,'TCC with me about Atwood, hut I think both The Handmaid's Tale and Cal's Eyl arc wonderful ... the kind of novels you underline.

Well, luckily for you, I am writing this article to hel~ you direct your funds. In my opinion, the best way to spend money is of course on food. The way I see it, food is a necessity for life so going out for dinner is by no means a waste of money. So if you have the time, take a study break and go out for a relaxing meal. The only problem is that I hope you are craving Italian food because I was, and as a result all of my suggestions for this week are Italian restaurants. My first few suggestions are all moderately expensive so for those of you who want · to spend less money please bare with me. There is a restaurant in Glenville called Lucia's which is about fifteen minutes away. The restaurant is medium sized and has a very nice atmosphere. As for the food, it is supposed to be excellent. Their specialtY is homemade pastas but they have a very large menu which includes. other items such as veal and chicken. They also have a big selection of dessert& and wines as well. AU: entrees come with a salad and a side dish of pasta. The cost is somewhere between twelve and eighteen dollars a _person depending on what is ordered. Another res~urant for about the same cost is Nicol~ 's on Delaware Avenue (in Albany). This is a really small restaurant which again has excellent food. Solution to \Some Old Flicks\ .-.--.~-- --~-.-.-.

The entrees come with both salad and pasta here as well. When I went, I had veal marsala and it was very good. The atmosphere is quite nice but the people there were very business-like and much older. If you're in the mood for a fancier atmosphere out of Schenectady, dther of these two places is the way to go. The last suggestion I have for the 12-18 dollar/person price range is The Clare. Now, the best part about this restaurant is you don't have to go very far. It is right across the street from St. Clares hospital (around the corner from Price Chopper). From the outside, this restaurant looks like a dive, but don't be swayed by your first impression. Supposedly, the food there is great. This is a smaH restaurant with a rather small menu but quality outdoes quantity in this case. Their menu consists more of interesting pasta dishes mixed with seafood or chicken. All entrees come with a salad and they have a nice selection of homemade dressings. I was told they also have delicious homemade bread that comes with the meal. This is the place to go if you want to be pleasantly surprised. Now, for the times you don't feel like getting dressed up, traveling twenty minutes and spending a lot of money, there are good casual Italian restaur- ants in the neighborhood. One suggestion is Luigi's on Join the Barrett Road. I have never been there but it is supposed to be pretty nice with a big selection including good lasagna and pastas. The prices ave between five and twelve dollars a person depending on what is ordered. I still 'like Castelf()'S for inexpensive Italian though. They have a huge menu including Greek food as well as Italian and they eve11 deliver (very slowly) if you dbn'L feel like going out at all. Comparatively, some people say that Luigi's has a nicer atmosphere and they think it is a step above CastcJ:Io's but some people feel that the food is better at Castello's. Well, I hope everybody uses my suggestions and has fun eating in the next few weeks.

May 30, 1991 SPORT§ Cup Final Update By John Schachnovsky That's it! Just like that the Pittsburgh Penguins have taken the spotlight away from the rest .of the sports world. If only for a fleeting moment, they are the kings of th~ late night sportscast. For the· past five weeks the Minnesota North Stars were not only in the spotlight, they owned it, cleaned it, and plugged it in when they felt like it. If losing was bad enough for this band of Cinderellas, midnight came like a freight train. Going into the third period of the sixth game, Pittsburgh led 7-0. Are you kidding me? In the arena where those lonely Stars became the talk of the town, in the arena where season tickets for next year are selling faster than they can be printed, in this arena. the Stars decide to play their worst hockey of the year. Okay, so it's over. The North Stars tried, but could not finish the job. The reason I mention the North Stars at all in my article is because I wanted to be the only sportswriter in the country that did not kick them off the fact of the Earth the minute the second period carne to its gruesome finish. I feel this achievement should be cherished for a little while longer. The Stars deserve at least that. ..... Okay. that's enough HOW ABOUT' THOSE PENGUINS. Finally Mario has won that elusive cup that had passed by him at the round table of the elite player£ in the NHL. First year coach \Badger\ Bob Johnson has led this team to the promised la1td like Chuck Knoll did for the Steelers in the late 70's. Tom Barrasso, who only a feu' months ago gave bone rnarrow to his critically ill daughter to save her life, can now rest easy knowing that his life has taken a complete 360 degree tum for the best. And fmally, the entire Penguin organization can relax. The city appreciates you. The team that played second fiddle to the Pirates and S teelers for all these years cannot take the driver's seat for the playoff date ... well, we'll see what happens. I told you it wotild be easy to forget about the North Stars.

Keg O'Riles May 30, 1991 Union Sports Year ·In Review by Dan Strum Sports Editor with Sports Information The 1990-91 Union sports campaign was filled with many memorable moments and highlights. Each season brought out strong team efforts as well as fine individual accomplishments. Here is a quick list of some of Union's standout performances. FALL The Football team put together an excellent follow up Stagg Bowl appearance of last Stage Bowl appearance of last year. They finished up with a 9-1 record, on their way to an ECAC North Championship. This solid program has put together a record of 26-6 over the past three years. The team's outlook for the next year is very positive. They will have 25 players returniiig for their senior season. With such a strong nucleus, look out for a possible return trip to the NCAAs next year. ·The end of Coach Bob Magee's 18~year career was the big news of the M e n ' s Soccer season. He compiled a 147-93-18 record with five NCAA appearances, four ECAC appearances, and ECAC Championships in 1974 and 1980. Coach Magee is replaced by Aldo Nardiello. Formerly from Albany State, Coach Nardiello had a 51-16-3 record with three consecutive berths in the ECAC tournament, highlighted by a championship in 1989. With nine starters returning, the Men's Soccer team is looking to excel under this new leadership. This year the C r o s s Country team was honored by hosting both the New York State Championships and the NCAA Regional Qualifier. They will host thell! again this fall. The Women's Tennis team bounced back with a 5-3 record. This was the first winning season since the record 9-2 season of the 198.2 campaign. WINTER Perhaps the biggest news of the year in the Union sporting world was the announcement that the Ice Hockey pr.ogram was moving up to ECAC Division I. They have been an outstanding Division II team throughout their history. Next year they will be travel partners with rival RPI as they face the unknown challenges of the D- I The Women's Swim team came away with many team and individual honors while posting an 8:..2 record. They finished third in the State meet. Jeanne Cutrone became the first women's All-Americn as she finished in the top eight of the 100 meter butterfly. Cutrone, Kelly Bevan, Julie Benker, and Amy O'Neill all received All-American honors for their seventh place finish in 4 Year Letter Winners William Allen Debra Berman Maurits Boon J.

This year the Skating Dutchmen finished up with a 17-6-3 record. They are losing three excellent seniors in Terry Campbell, Brian Lucey, and Bill Sedergren. The Men's Basketball team opened up their season with an impressive 6-game win streak. To cap off their superb season, the Dutchmen captured the Capital District Tourn- ament Championship. In addition, they were invited to the ECAC Tournament.
