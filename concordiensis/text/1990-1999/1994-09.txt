Volume CXXIV, Number I __...·· nnror~i.ensi·s Tlte Student Newspaper of Union College Since 1877 Schenectady, New York Celeb•·ating Our Bicentennial. September 29, 1994 Of/With a Bang! Union's Bicentennial Celebration Begins Adrian MacLean Co11tributi11g Writer The Bicentennial Year opened in a celebration of success at last Tuesday's Convocation. Students, faculty and parents filed into the Memorial Chapel to take part in the celebration. Speeches came from President Roger Hull, Professor George Butterstein, Chairman of the Faculty Executive Committee, and Nathan Coffin, President of the Student Forum. President Hull elaborated on the value of risk taking built off the foundation of tradition. One of Union's unique qualities is the progressive attitude it has taken to establish itself. \Unless we are willing and able to aggressively seek change and to take pmdent risks, we can neither maximize our potential nor be true to those who came before,\ said Hull. Hull briefly touched upon the history of the college. The college became the first non- d~nominatjonal college to pr'escrve the right for ·students of every religious background to receive the benefits of higher education when residents of northe111 New York state petitioned for an institute of higher education. Hull explained that since its founding, Union has been a risk taking pioneer in higher education. Among those risks was the dismissal of Latin, traditionally emphasized by colleges and Union's adoption of French. Greek was also replaced due to the development of modem languages. Looking into the future, President Hull is setting a goal to minimize the gap between engineering and the liberal arts. \Perhaps most important of all, and certainly most in keeping with the tradition that is Union, we need on the eve of the Sesquicentennial of the engineering to bring the liberal arts and the engineering closer together,\ said Hull.

As the Union affiliates turned to leave, a gun shot was fired. \We turned around and we had not taken two or three steps when the gun was fired. It pierced my ears, it was so loud. I was expecting one of us to fall to the ground,\ the Union student said. There are three assailants connected with this incident. Two are identified by their accents as being Hispanic. At least one of them has short black hair. All three are in their late teens or early twenties. They were driving a black sports car. Fortunately, both the student and alum escaped without physi- cal hann. As a result ofthis inci- dent Dean Alford sent notices to all campus boxes informing the Union commuttity of the assault and listing safety precautions. Alford is also planning to have safety workshops within the next two weeks. l11ese workshops will educate students how to protect themselves from being put in similar terrifying situations. The entire student body is st~ongly encouraged to attend. \Union can't create a com- pletely safe environment -no one can,\ Alford said. There have been similar incidents at other colleges. Even ntral schools such as Dartmouth, Clarkson and Colgate have had tragidies that mirror Saturday night's events. One way to make the campus safer for students is to \practice common sense,\ Alford ob- served. The Schenectady Police said they wouldjncrease their surveil- lance of the campus. \[TI1e po- lice] are strapped so they do not know how long they will be able to provide the extra patrols,\ in- fonned Alford. Some precautions students can take for safety are: to walk in groups if they go out after dark, use the escort service, keep doors and rooms locked and become familiar with the emergency phones on campus:

The group was greeted by a crowd of approxi- mately 30 Union alumni, stu- dents, and friends. The canoeists were serenaded by a bagpiper and New York City Commissioner of Parks. Henry Stern, officially welcomed the adventuresome group on behalf of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani. An upbeat President Hull waxed philosophical at the po- dium in the boat basin rotunda. \Casey Stengel once said, 'They say it can't be done but it doesn't always work.'\ Hull explained the reasons why he wanted to take the trip. In addition to commemo- rating Union's receipt of its char- ter, \I've long been a devotee, a fan, of Thomas Jefferson. His philosophy was that it was impor- tant to develop one's body and mind.\ Indeed, the trip was rigorous. The group came in four boats. The canoeists paddled approxi- mately 30 miles a day, spending most ofthe daylight hours in their boats. l11e evenings were spent at the homes ofalumni along the Hudson River. The paddlers carried personal flotation devices, maps, tide and current charts, first aid equipinent, and extra food. TI1ey used mo- bile cellular telephone and two- way marine radio to maintain contact with an escort vehicle that followed the group along the east side ofthe river. From Nyack to New York City (the widest and most heavily traveled stretch of water), the group was accompa- nied by a power boat. In welcoming President Hull to New York City, Commissioner Stem literally took the shi1i off his back, presenting Union's presi- dent with a N.Y.C. Parks Depart- mentt-shirt. Hull reciprocated by removing his Union shirt, pre- senting it to Stem.

Students Join Community in. Retaking Neighborhood by Nalini Gupta Contributing Writer The third annual Steinmetz Park Clean-Up Day began with a blast last Saturday, September 24, to give the Schenectady com- munity a chance to take back a part of its neighborhood. The event provided fun for people of all ages, with free refreshments, free COs and a live broadcast from radio station Fly 92. Sevetal community groups joined the Bridge Center of Schenectady in the rigorous refur- bishing efforts. The Bridge Cen- ter is a residential treatment pro- gram for people ages 17-30 with drug related. problems and is de- signed to help each resident es- tablish better living skills as an alternative to dmg abuse. The residential program, established in 1972, is a \miniature\ commu- nity _structured and behaviorally area. The Bridge Center plans to use the comfort station as a cen- ter for youth programs next sum- mer. The nature trail, which ha~ fallen into severe neglect over the past few years, will offer visitors a scenic route full of old oak last Saturday (photo by Racllel Goldjille) oriented center. Groups such as Project Pride, the United Way, Union College students, the Boys and Girls Clubs of Schenectady, organizations from the Goose Hill Association, and many caring neighborhood residents also joined the endeavor . This year's efforts included re- painting the comfort station, re- storing the nature trail and trim- ming and pruning the lake side trees, wild geraniums, trout lilies and mandrakes. By restoring Steinmetz Park with its tennis courts, swimming, playground equipme11t and picnic areas, the community hopes to bring its sta- tus closer to the level of Central Park. Asked how the project was funded, Public Relations Con- sultant, Cheryl MacNeil an- swered, \We have no budget. l11e entire program was organized on the strength of the volunteer re- sponse we received and there was no money involved. Everything, including food, drinks, working tools, labor and music were con- tributed by the participating orga- nizations.\ Supervisors were pleased to see the large tum out of people willing to make an effort and are eager to continue with the project on an annual basis in order to inspire a l:,'feater involvement in maintain- NEAREXIT2W ON NORTHWAY Student Activities Exposition Thursdov. 9/29: 1 - 4 PM CC Front lawn Rain Date: 9/30 ing public facilities. \I even brought my grandchildren to join the fun,\ said one resident who enjoyed seeing her three-year- old grandson zealously doing his part.

September 29, 1994, page 4 NEWS In Admissions Union Bucks National Trend college was reluctant to sing its own praises. l11e college focused inwardly, concentrating on im- proving itself from within, and 11ot promot- ing itself on the outside. While this. dedicatio11 made Union what it is to- day, it caused -the school to re- main un- known. When Union deferred the opportunity to brag, other schools used this opportu- nity to s.ell themselves. Therefore, Hamilton a n d Skidmore can use their established College all over the world. TI1e sizes of the last few freshman classes are good indications that Union is growing in popularity. Tite fact that 31 percent of the ad- mitted stu- dents attend Union means that it canbemore selective. According to Dean Lundquist, Union is one of the most selective schools in New York. As Union's f>Opulari ty continues to increase, it wiHbecome naturally more selec- tive and thus the quality by Heather Manley Assistallt News Editor When looking for colleges, many students applying to Union College also apply to what are considered similar schools, such as Hamilton, Colgate, Skidmore or Franklin & Marshall. These schools are what admissions staffs refer to as \overlap schools.''· Students apply to a group of similar schools based on the general coi1sensus that they are ofthe same quality. However, admissions statistics fmril 1993 show that Union is ranked higher than these same schools that, in many cases, have a better reputa- tion. The long-standing belief that Union js on the same level as Hamilton or Skidmore, for ex- ample, is no longer accurate. According to Peterson's Com- petitive Colleges 1994-95, Union is ranked in the upper half of 22 similar institutions in three cat- egories. Union accepts 49 per- cent of its applicants, rating sixth among its peer institutions. Ranked tenth on this scale is Hamilton College, which accepts 57 percent and sixteenth-ranked Skidmore, which accepts 64 per- cent of its applicants. These sta- tistics demonstrate the trend that tJnion, a school frequently com- pared with Hamilton and Skidmore, is more selective. Similarly, of the students who are offered admission to Union, Jl percent accept while only 25 percent accept admission to Hamilton and 22 percent accept. admission to Skidmore. The irony is that Union is still consid- ered to be on the same level as these schools, when according to statistics, it is ranked above. In addition, 49 percent of the stu- dents admitted to Union are in the top 1 0 percent of their graduat- ing high school class. Convocation Opens Union's 200th Year Preside lit Roger Hull basks ill the glory of tile momeut. (photo by Joslma Wills Hai11esjor Tile Collcordiellsis) Co11tinued from page I \It is apparent that we need to make sure that, both symbolically and factually, women are treated as fairly and well as men,\ said Hull. The celebration contiimed with refreshments and a giant birthday cake of Union's campus. Ice sculptures carved in the shape of the Nott Memorial were lit up on the Libraty Plaza. Following the activities in front of the library, fireworks lit up the sky to officially begin the celebration of the college's bicentennial yeac The convocation was attended by over 2000 people and was only a small indication of the festivities tlu~t are yet to occur in celebration of Union's bicentennial. Dean of Admissions, Dan Lundquist, explains that when ranked strictly ·by the numbers, Union is among the best. How- ever, its reputation and popular- ity are·not at par with the others. Union is an instih!tion that is ob- jectively better than its reputation. The problem, therefore, lies in image. Coniparatively, schools I ike Hamilton and Skidmore, whose admissions statistics are tanked lower, bank primarily 011 their reputations, according ·to Dean Lundquist. The result is that Union is a \wei! kept secret,\ says the Dean. Unfortunately, the school needs to tell its secret to high scl10ol guidance counselors and employ- ers. The key is perception. No statistic canies any weight as long as Union continues to be per- ceived at the middle of the pack. Why is Union's reputation such that it is? Dean Lundquist ex- plained that for many years, the reputations to sell themselves. As of late, the Admissions Of- fice works at promoting Union ofthe student body will improve. As Union's statistics improve, its reputation will not be far behind. Telecommunications Installs Voicemail Tips For Familiarizing Yourself With the System The college completed instal- lation of a voicemail systern in • August, and students were the first to receive their voice mail- bpxes wh~n they arrived on cam- pus. .(VoicemaH for faculty .and staff will follow). Over 2000 voiceinail boxes have been issued thus far to stt!de1its who are en,. C!Ouraged to initialize their per- ~onal boxes so they can statt send- ing and receiving messages. \We understand that there is some confusion over how every- thing works so this· artic1e will at- . tempt to explah~ a few voicemail 'highlights' and features as offered to Student subscribers,\ said Diane Winkler or\Telecommuni- cations. Any assistance/personal instruction needed in initializing a voice mail box is available at the Telecommunications Office ¥on-Fri. 8:30-4:30ptn. Winkler had the following tips for new users. 1. Follow the flowchart in the pink brochure from the left to the right to perform the functions desired. You can always press \0\ when you are in your own. mailbox, and ''Marsha\ will give you prompts. To backup or start over,. press *. You cannot break the system, even if you hang up in the middle of some function. 2 .. If you :want,to senda mes- sage to another subscriber, enter your own mailbox first: dial6688 : or ,*5_, enter your mailbox num- ber and password and in the Main Menu, press [ 2 ] to send ames- sage. Record the message and se11d by either dialing the last name of the recipient or ent€}ring their 4 digit voicemail box num- ber. You can mark it urgent, · · private at'ld even request notifica- . tion of receipt. 3. T11e Dial by Name Direc. • tory message wi\ll be_ heard when you have called a room other than a single, and there is no answ.er after 4 rings or the line ·is busy. You are asked to enter the last name and then can leave a mes- sage in that subscribers voice mai · !box. For those i11 singles, t h e caller will be forwarded directly to that person's voicemail box on a no answer or busy. 4. You can transfer any caller to the Dial by Name Ditectory from any phoi1e by entering [*I] then Ext. 3333. By dialing #3333,... you call it directly, from which po~nt you can send a voicemail message to another subsctiber. It is still better to send msgs. using #2 di.rections above. 5. When you dial the last name, and \Marsha\ says to keep dial- ing, you 11eed to start adding the letters of the firsf name until she makes a match (usually 1 or 2 more letters). If a last name has iess than 4 digits, you must al- ways key in the letters of the first name until a match is found. 6. Call waitiilg is still provided on studeilt lines unless you tell us otherwise. When you hear the call .w_aiting tone, you have 16 seconds to take the 2nd call, or it will go to voicemail (as long as the caller hangs on that is). 7. If a subscriber has not initial- ized his/her mail box (eg. set up a ~:,•reeting) messages cannot be sent to him/her no matter what the sender does. It's worth to travel extra mile for good food .. We're just a mile down the road.

September 29, 1994, page 6 NEWS Students Forced Off Campus By Large Freshmen Class Security Report by Martin Metz Colltributillg Writer As the size of the Freshmen Class increases each year, the campus is presented with one major problem. Where do we put all of these people? This year's Freshmen Class of 543 students is the largest since 198 7. As a result, the Office of Residence Life was forced to find housing for everyone. In order to make room for the freshmen, Smith House and Wells House were set up to house upperclassmen. These houses hold about fifteen persons each, and Wells House is expected to expand after the school gets a variance from the state giving them pennission to use the third floor. However, there still was not enough room to house everyone. TI1e transfer students repre- sented another problem for Resi- dence Life. Housing representa- tives were not able to house some of the transfer students because keeping all of the freshmen on campus is a top priority. In re- gard to this, Residence Life was in a bind when it came to hous- ing the remaining few transfer students. Over the summer, Resi- denceLife called the students and asked them if they wouldn't mind looking for off-campus apart- ments. A few weeks later, Hous- ing found several apartments across the street from Webster and decided to lease them. T11e transfer students were called and asked if they would be willing to live in these new apartments. Luckily, they said yes, and the Wade Lupe apartments on 15 Lafayette Street became their new home. Each apartment, housing mostly transfer students, is set up to hold three people per unit, and has a kitchen, two bathrooms, and two bedrooms. Although some of the students didn't get their room assignments until Septem- ber 1, they seem to be happy with the new apartments and one stu- dent described them as \real nice places\. Of course, living in the Wade Lupe apartments has its dis- advantages. Mainly, they would like to be closer to the center of things, and they are sort of de- tached from campus, so it is harder for the transfer students to meet people and get involved r-----:..------------------1 I I I = I I OF NORTHEASTERN NEW YORK I I YOUR LOCAL SOURCE OF AFFORDABLE HEALTHCARE I I Now Offering confidential HIV testing for men and women I I I 1 Services Available ToWomen Available To Men & Women 1 I • Complete.Ob/GYN Exam5 • Confidential HIV teetin0 1 1 • Primary Care Services and coun5eling 1 1 • Pregnancy Testin0 • Birth controlsuppliea (condoms, 1 1 • Pregnancy Options Counseling Depo Provera, Norp!ant, etc.) 1 1 • Comprehensive Prenatal Care • Educational ree;ource center 1 1 • STD Testing & Treatment • RapeCri6is Service (346·2266) 1 1 • Abortion Services • Volunteer/Intern Opportunltler; 1 I Confidential STD testing and treatment service:; formen I I are available now at our Clifton Park health center.

Wire dt:onr.orbiensis NEWS September 29, 1994, page 7 - Alumni Council Meeting: State of Union by David Levine Editor-in-c/lief One-hundred and eighty of Union's most active graduates gathered this Saturday for the semi-annual Alumni Council meeting, and according to Presi- dent Roger HuH, \Union is mov- ing in the right direction.\ Hull, who used the meeting to deliver remarks on the state of the col- lege, stressed the importance of distinguishing Union from other liberal arts colleges as the insti- tutiotl enters .its third century. According to Hull, Union has always been a pioneering college, and he foresees a more complete integration ofliberal arts and en- gineering as the next step which will enable Union to \leapfrog institutions which are far wealthier than us.\ In tenns of admissions, Hull believes that Union had a banner year. This year, Ul1ion welcomed 545 members oftheclass of1998, and 40 transfer students, giving the school its sec011d largest en- ro11ment in history. According to Hull, Union has attempted to meet the full finan- cial needs of every student. $12 million of last year's budget was dedicated to Financial Aid, rep- resenting 19 percent of the total budget. Hull is satisfied that once at Union students have been ac- tively involved in community ser- vice. As examples of student in- vol'vement, the president cited Union's involvement with Big Brothers/Big Sisters and tutoring in Schenectady schools. \If pe<:Jple don't leam between the ages of 18 an~ 22 at a first rate institution the importance of giv- ing to their community, where can they leam?\ Financially, more than fifty percent of alumni participate in the ammal fund. This number can be misleading, however, because recent graduating classes have had much lower participation rates than older classes. With in- creasing class sizes, Union's overall participation rate may de- cline, according to Hull. The col- lege lms actively sought contribu- tions from alumni {for the fund- ing of the Nott Memorial), and will continue to seek alumni con- tributions for other projects, such as the proposed $17 million reno- vation of Schaffer Library. \We want a first rate library for this institution for the first two de- cades of the 21st century.\ In trying to ascertain the rea- sons why only 50 percent of alumni participate in the ann~tal fund, the school has found that students who receive financial aid are more likely to contribute to the fund.

Bill Curtin, of the class of 1982, was elected to replace Rex Moon, class of 1944, who had to resign. Moon was forced to resign because the offi.ce's policy states that the Alumni Trustee must leave uffi~o:c after reaching the age of 72. Curtin will finish out the next two years of Moon's tenn and then be eli- gible for re-election into a four yeartenn. Curtin came to Union in 1978 and became an active member of his class. Not only did he partici- pate in Union athletics, both on the varsity ·level and in intramural$, he found the time to be the sports editor for The Con- cordien'iis, public address an- nouncer for home basketball and football games, and he was the Treasurer of Chi Psi fraternity. Curtin graduated from Union as an economics major with a Bach- elor of Arts Degree. Since he graduated, Curtin has become Managing Director and Chief Fixed Income Strategist at Lehman Brothers, a global invest- ment banking finn. For the last five years, Cmiin has been natned to the Institutional Investor magazine's All-America Re- search Team. Even with the great William Curtin responsibility his job demands, Cmtin has remained involved in Union College life. Curtin has been extremely ac- tive in fund raising for Union since his graduation. He was Head Agent of the class of' 82 for ten years, and a member of the Executive Committee of the An- nual Fund for five years. For the past four years, Curtin has been a member of the Terrace Council and has contributed to the Alumni Fund every year since graduation. He also actively recruits Union students for his employers and helps other Union students in the New York area. As a Trustee, Curtin,\ ... would tackle the task of getting the alumni of the late '70's, '80's and '90's more involved in the .future of Union College.\ Curtin also looks forward to \challenging the younger classes to continue this proud tradition.\ legiance are also positively re- lated to probability of participa- tion. · In terms of the diminishing state aid the school has received, Hull blan1ed Governor Cuomo, whom he claims \does not believe in aid to private institutions.\ The President added, \If Cuomo is re- elected I expect the Bundy Aid we receive to be reduced to zero.\ Currently, the school receives only $270,000 in Bundy Aid from New York out of an annual bud- get of $65 Million.

September 29, 1994, page 8 SCIENCE AND HEALTH Simpson vs Mother Nature: A Long Shot For The Accused by Andy Salama Co-Science a11d Health Editor Anyone who reads the news-· papers or watches television knows all about the 0 .J. Simpson case. 1l1e Simpson defense, lead by a one Shapiro had demon- stratedhis ib'11orance ofthe power of DNA sequencing. As of yet, the defense's stratef:,')' haS'focused on dismissing valuable evidence (i.e. improperly obtained items, DNA sequencing, biased police officers). I am by no means an expert on DNA sequencing or legal matters for that fact, how- ever I do know that DNA se- quencing is very accurate. It ap- pears the best strategy for the de- fense team would be to claim that the blood samples were mixed up. Despite the fact that tests in- dicate that Simpson's blood was at the murder scene, it does not conclusively prove anything. DNA is composed of nucleic acids, four different monomers called nucleotides connected lin- early and then matched to a complementary strand. The nucleotides, Adenine(A), Guanine(G), Thymine(T), and Cytosine(C) are composed of three parts; an organic base, a pentose (5~cm·bon sugar) and a phosphate group. The exact se- quence of ones DNA is deter- Ill ined by ones parents. The DNA is coded for the production of certain proteins, as well as in- struction for the production (trail- scription) ofRNA needed for the production of the protein (trans- lation).

At that time and before that, the science world concentrated more on controlling the manifestation of the disease. They looked closely at what deficiency or abundance of chemicals cause the disease. There have been speculations that the disease was caused by aluminum, which are not true. There has also been shown that a deficiency in estrogen may lead to premature Alzheimer's, especially in post- menopausal women. of the negative results. Presently, research is being done in a test tube to see if there is a link between zinc and Alzheimer's disease. Researchers at Massachusetts General Hospital have just repmted that zinc can cause one form of AB protein to form clun1ps which resemble the amyloid plaques found. in the disease or is it the cause? All three of these points detract from the findings, but that is not to say that these initial findings are not important. l11e next step would be to model the experimental environment to more closely resemble that of the brain and see if the results agree or conflict. As is the case with research of this kind, the findings must be taken with a brains of . . \There 1s g•·eat debate over Al2henner's . patients. these findmgs because of the grain of salt.

First, the exp&rriment used free zinc ions, where in the brain zinc is normally bound to other proteins, secondly, this AB protein is able cannot jump to the conclusion that zinc is bad in our diet and that we should stop using it, because that is not true. Doing that could have greater effects on one'·s health.

The four termination reaction (A,T,G,C) are run adjacently ort the gel. They migrate down the gel in such a fashion that they form the exact DNA that s~­ quence. Once the gel is dried, it is exposed to X-ray film, the ra- dio-labeled compounds wil1 emit energy which will expose the film. 1l1e result is a photographic film with exact arrangement, and order of the DNA sequence.

So, one is left with successively longer pieces of DNA, each with a dis- tinct molecular weight. There are problems with DNA sequencing. The polymerase chain reaction has been criticized as contamination by air borne pieces of DNA can give false re- sults .. However, scientists believe that for diagnostic purposes the technique is highly accurate, with the exception of DNA obtained from identical twins. Usind DNA as evidence in court has received recent praise, and it seems that the Simpson defense will really have to squinn their way out of this small, yet vital, piece evidence.

Domestic Violence Exists Everywhere: Even At Union by Diana Sedita Copy Editor There is a major problem on college campuses around the country that all too often gets overlooked. l11is problem is non- discriminating. It could happen to women of all races, creeds, ages and social classes. It is rela- tionship abuse ... both mental and physical. Thanks to the O.J. Simpson murder trial, domestic abuse has become a \hot topic\ on the mit1ds of the public, but it seems as though they can not fully understand the problem. Victims of abuse go through ab- solute hell and pure horror. In addition to the lawsuits and trials, eye-opening statistics have caught the attention of the pub- lic. In the United States an esti- mated 2 to 4 million women a year are physically abused by their partner. Also, more than 50 percent of all wometi will be abused by their partner at some point in their lives. Between 1988 and 1992,42 percent ofmurdered women were killed by their inti- mate male partners. Today a woman is just as likely to be at- tacked by her pminer as an ac- quaintance or a stranger. These statistics are startling but are most likely inaccurate. This is because often times the instances of abuse go unrepmied. This is almost al- ways the result of a fear or threats from their pax1ner. Victims often hear, \If you ever tell anyone, you'll be sorry!\ And after be- ing repeatedly beaten and men- tally abused, a woman is petri- fied to confide in anyone after hearing threat after threat. The startling reality is that be- cause of that fear, a m~jority of the charges that do get brought up against the abusers are dropped because the victim re- cants her story and drops the charges. l11is is usually the re- sult of the· abuser's threats or the shame the victim feels. Also, women get sucked in by the \honeymoon phase.\ This is when the abuser completely changes his personality for a short period of time. l11e rela- tionship soars, the abuser acts caring and sweet, but things al- most always return to violence. When the abusers are not pros- ecuted, they feel that they are above the law and can get away with the violence, so the beatings get worse. Abusers tell their victims that it is their fault they are beaten and that if they did not do a certain thing they would not need to be reprimanded. The abuse is a learned behavior. Men see how their fathers or peer treats their girlfriends or wives and they \leam\ to act the same way. It also works the same way for the victims. If a woman grows up seeing her mother abused, it is very probable that the woman will also be abused. What the public does not con- centrate enough on, is the affect abuse has on women. Their self- esteem plummets, they become submissive and no longer think for themselves. l11eir abuser be- comes their decision maker and \ruler.\ A woman is constantly \walking around on egg shells\ wondering what will enrage her boyfriend. Will she say the wrong thing? Will she look at the wrong person? Will she not call him on time? This abuse not only affects future male relationships, but also her current and future relationships with her female friends. l11e abused woman will always worry if she is going to do something wrong and lose the relationship. This is a direct re- sult of the mental abuse the woman endures. They are told that they are not wmih anything and that no one would ever want her as a friend or girlfriend. Af- ter hearing this day after day, month after month the woman actually believes that the abuse is her fault and that if she leaves her abuser, she will be utterly alone. Women need to recognize the first signs of abuse. Some women feel that their boyfriend's jeal- ousy is cute. It is not. As soon as he starts putting you down infront of friends, making unreasonable requests (like to stop hanging out with yourftiends because he does not like them), or if he hits or pushes you once, leave. No one should have to endure the humili- ation, fear and hurt. A common question asked of the victims is, \why do they con- tinue to stay with their abusers?\ When are we going to start ask- ing the abusers, \why are you beating her?\ Editorials, Letters & Disclaimers Letters to the Editor should be addressed to the OP-ED Page and must be received by 5 p.m. the Tuesday before publication.

LE'TTERS September 29, 1994, page 11 A Shot Heard Around Union Womyn's Union Explains Change in Name ·by Elizabetlt. K. DeKoven Associate News Editor Last Friday night I sat on the back steps of Hickok House and commented to a friend how nice it was to live on the side of campus that was so residential. We rtnJtually agreed that we felt like we were part of a neighborhood. We both felt safe and sectire m our new environment. Last year J lived in West College and fell asleep listening to what is commonly refened to as the \Schenectady National Anthem,\ a song pelfonned by an orchestra of police vehicles, ambulances and fire trucks all blaring their sirens. 1l1is year I was excited to know that most likely the most intrusive noise that I would be falling asleep to would be the faint sounds of music escaping from the fraternity house next door. When I retumed home from the football game on Saturday, I was disturbed to find a sign posted on the front door of Hickok House waming everyone to beware of strangers lurking around the house, to lock our doors at all times and never to prop the door open. I couldn't ima1,rine what had happe11ed to violate my false sense of security. I knew I always had to be cautious, but froni the impression I got from the si!,'lt on the door, I knew that something had happened the previous night to force us to have to be extra careful. As I walked down the hall to my bedroom I heard everyone buzzing about a gunshot. Some of the girls thought it might have been a car that back fired and others were sure that they had heard a gunshot at around three in the morning. It was later confinned to me that two people had been mugged outside of Hickok House on Friday night, the same night that I had discussed feeling so safe up campus. A gun had been fired, but luckily the gun had been filled with blanks. As a student at UnionCollege, I am petrified. What would have happened ifthe gun had not been filled with blanks? Well, it would have too late to talk about what ifs, we would all be talking about the terrible tragedy that !tad occurred. We, as a student body, have got to become more cautious of the city that surrounds us. The campus, with its iron gates, may give us the illusion that we go to school on a contained campus, but we are by no means dosed off from society and we are by no means safe. This is not a problem that the administration can solve, all that they can do is warn us to be careful. We must make sure that we do not let our guards down, and we must never, regardless of whether we are male or female walk around alone after dark. Guns are not sexist, they strike at anyone the barrel 1s pointed at. To th~ _f:ditor, At the end of last year Union students may or tnay not remem- ber that the Womyn's Union changed the spelling of their or- ganization from WOMEN to WOMYN. This seemingly not so drastic change was met with whispers and gasps from men and women who questioned why this · change was necessary. The most practical purpose behind this was · to draw some attention to an or- ganization which does most of its work unnoticed. From the reac~ tions and comments that we heard, our intention worked. The other reason why we wished to change our name was to clarify the intent of the WOMYN's Union. The etymol- ogy of the word \woman\ is, wife of man, and clearly, we are not only the ''wife of man.\ We are a group of strong indepe11dent women who do not wish to 1 be defined as such. In an organiza- tion which tries to give women on this campus an identity, and voice, loud enough to be heard, we must make it clear within its definition that we are not calling ourselves the \wife of man.\ We want to appeal to all women (and pro-feminist men) and thus we do not want to have anyone feeling that they have to be the wife of man to join. (Undoubtedly this is why so few men weFe involved before, but with the new spelling, please feel free- to join.) We are not a group of man hat- ing crazy feminists, we are con- cemed people who want to make the school, and world, a little more comfortable for women. In a place where a woman some- times has to scream to be heard, it sometimes helps to have many voices yelling together. Sincerely, Kate Durocher Womyn's Union Academic Honesty Commitee Welcomes Students To the Editor, The students of the Academic Honesty Committee would like to welcome back our fellow upper- classmen and congratulate the freshmen on their acceptance to Union. For those of you who don't know, there is a group of students on the Academic Affairs Council who meet regulat'ly to discuss ways to promote aca- demic honesty and maintain the academic standards which we all, as Union College students, have agreed to uphold. We realize that some fonns of cheating, espe- cially plagialism, may sometimes be a result of student misunder- standing. 1l1erefore, our first goal is to encourage you to talk to your professors about proper citation and ask them to clarify the tenns under which you are expected to complete your assignments. Re- member, we're on your side; to- gether we can maintain the stan- dards and integrity of Union.

LETTERS September 29, 1994, page 11 A Shot Heard Around Union Womyn's Union Explains Change in Name by Elizabeth K. DeKoven Associate News Editor Last Ftiday night I sat on the back steps of Hickok House and commented to a friend how nice it was to live on the side of campus that was so residential. We mutually agreed that we felit like we were part of a neighborhood. We both felt safe and secure in our new environment. Last year I lived in West College and fell asleep listening to what is commonly refen-ed to as the \Schenectady National Anthem,\ a song perfonned by an orchestra ·Of police vehicles, ambulances and fire trucks aU blating their sirens. This year I was excited to know that most likely the most intmsive noise that I would be falling asleep to would be the faint sounds of music escaping from the fraternity house next door. When I retumed home from the football game on Saturday, I was disturbed to find a sign posted on the front door of Hickok House waming everyone to beware of strangers lurking around the hm1se, to lock our doors at all times and never to prop the door open. I couldn't imagine what had happened to violate my false sense of security. I knew I always had to be cautious, but from the impression Igot from the sign Oil the door, I knew that something had happened the previous night to force us to have to be extra careful. As I walked down the hall to my bedroom I heard everyone buzzing about a gunshot. Some ofthe girls thought it might have been a car that back fired and others were sure that they had heard a gunshot at around three in the morning. It was later confinned to me that two people had been mugged outside of Hickok Hmtse on Friday night, the same night that I had discussed feeliBg so safe up campus. A gun had been fired, but luckily the gun had been filled with blanks. As a student at Union College, I am petrified. What would have happened ifthe gun had not been filled withblanks? Well, it would have too late to talk about what ifs, we woHid all be talking about the terrible tragedy that had occurred. We, as a student body, have got to become more cautious of the city that surrounds us. The campus, with its iron gates, may give us the illusion that we go to school on a contained campus, but we are by no means closed off from society and we are by no tneans safe. This is not a problem that the administration can solve, all that they can do is warn us to be careful. We must make sure that we do not let our guards down, and we must never, regardless of whether we are male or female walk around alone after dark. Guns are not sexist, they strike at anyone the barrel ts pointed at. To the ~ditor, At the end of last year Union students may or may not retnem- ber that the Womyn's Union changed the spelling of their or- ganizati,on fr01n WOMEN to WOMYN. This seemingly not so drastic change was met with whispers and gasps from men and wot11en who questioned why this change was necessary. The most practical purpose behind this was to draw some attention to an or- ganization which does tnost of its work umwticed. From the reac- tions and comments that we heard, our intention worked. The other reason why we wished to change our name was to clarify the intent of the WOMYN's Union. The etymol- ogy of the word \woman\ is, wife of man, and clearly, we are not onlythe\wife ofman.\ We are a group of strong independent women who do not wish to be defined as such. In an organiza- tion which tries to give women on this campus an identity, and voice, loud enough to be heard, we must t'Nake it clear within its definition that we are not calling oYrselves the \wife of man.\ We want to appeal to all women (and pro-feminist men) and thus we do not want to have anyone feeling that they have to be the wife of man to join. (Undoubtedly this is why so few men were involved before, but with the new speiling, please feel free to join.) We are not a group of man hat- ing crazy feminists, we are con- cemed people who want to make the schoo'l, and world, a little more comfortable for women. In a place where a woman some- times has to scream to be heard, it sometimes helps to have many voices yelling together. Sincerely, Kate Durocher Womyn's Union Academic Honesty Commitee Welcomes Students To the Editor, The students of the Academic Honesty Committee would like to welcome back our fellow upper- classmen and congratulate the freshmen on their acceptance to tJmon. For those of you who don't know, there is a group of students on the A eadem ic Affairs Council who meet regularly to discuss ways to promote aca- demic honesty and maintain the academic standards which we alL as Union College students, have agreed to uphold. We realize that some forms of cheating, espe- cially plagiatism. may sometimes be a result of student misunder- standing. T11erefore, our first goal is to encourage you to talk to your professors about proper citation and ask them to clarify the tenns under which you are expected to complete your assignments. Re- member, we're on your side; to- gether we can maintain the stan- dards and integrity of Union. Sincerely yours, Academic Honesty Subcouncil of the Academic Affairs Council ... 8U\ MI-l !

•. September-29, 1994, page 14 FEATURES Spanning Half a Century Professor Finkelstein Reflects on Changes During His Career at Union by Elizabeth DeKoven Assista11t News Etlitor Professor Joseph Finkelstein, a 51-year veteran of.Union College, recognized several significant changes to the campus since his anival as a student in 1943. \Over the past 50 years one of the most significant changes to UHion is the redoing of the cam- pus,\ said Finkelstein. Finkelstein reported that in his first ten years at the college two \magnificent\ rows ofelm trees died, the build- ings received very little attention, facilities were modest, and the Nott was already beginning to fall apart. ''The library, which was located in the Nott, was impos- sible,\ said Finkelstein. \Kappa Alpha was about to fall· down and the Biqlogy building· was wart like, you could hear the rats across the pipes.\ Finkelstein n~ted that with all of the new buildings and construction that has taken place the campus has finally begun to look quite \handsome''. Another change that Finkelstein commented on was the \improvement and professional ization\ of the fac- ul.ty. ''After the war, tl1e faculty changed substantially in the direc- tion of academic quality,\ said Finkelstein, \Since then, Union has had a beth~r.. stronger faculty.'' The addition of women to the campus was felt as an extremely positive. \Although nirvana hasn't come, they seem to me to adopt the sta11dards of a male fra- temity culture,\ said Finkelstein. \Union is a better, healthier place than it was wheli it was all male.\ The deterioration of the intel- ,lectual curiosity of many of the students was a negative ch.ange at Union sadly CO!nmented on by Finkelstein. \1l1e faculty say that the best students are as good as the best students anywhere,\ said Finkelstein .. \There are not enough of these kinds of students to pltll the rest of the sttidents out of this .anti-intellectual trqugh.\ Finkelstein said that studetlts no longer ask questions nor talk about inteUectual issues .. Some are even intimidated by the social environment of Union. \The problem is students work for grades, study for tests and party too much,\ said Finkelstein. \Union is very good for some, but . disappointing for others.\ \In my career, I have taught close to 15,000 students, most of whom I have really liked,\ said Finkelsteiil. \At one time r had a love affair with the college, but I don't have that now.\ As for tradition on Union's campus, Finkelstein said that it has com~ and gone in fluxes. \When I began to teach after the war, collegiate traditions were lacking.

They did not want frater- nity hazing,~' said Finkelstein. \But much of these !raditions have been brough.t back, espe- cially in the eighties.\ Overtheyears, Finkelstein has \planted\ his mark on Uni·on College's campus. Finkelstein donated two flowering cherry trees on campus, one on Nott street and one behind the college center, which died. Additionally, two years ago Finkelstein donated 250rhododendrons totheschool. \I was to plant 50 a year,\ said Finkelstein.\ Buttwo years have gone by, and I will not continue becaase my pFOject is not work- ing out. The college does not have sufficient staff or commitment to the gardens to take care of them.\ Finkelstein graduated Union College after seven consecutive terms in September of 1945 to attend Columbia Law School. \I got to leave Ui1ion early because of the war,'; said Professor Finkelstein. \We were a11owed to attend classes around the clock.\ Finkelstein retumed to Union as a professor of both history and economics in February of 1945 after deciding not to pursue a law degree. \When I attended my graduation, I marched in with the faculty, not my classmates.'' After two and a half years of teaching at Union, Finkelstein at- tended Harvard University where he receive.d a graduate degree in Josepll Finkelstein, Unio11 's most tetmred professor. (pltoto by Micltelle Rosemanfor Tire ConcordiellSis) economic history. He then com- pleted his education at the Lon- don School of Economics. Here- tumed to Union in 1953 to resume his position as a Professor of His- tory. Finkelstein now teaches half of the time for the history depart- ment and half of the time for the Graduate Management Institute , which he helped to start over forty years ago. \I alli currently on either my last sabbatical or a two year win- dow that will end in 1996,\ said Finkelstein. \I am working on a book, I would like to finish one more.\ Auditions \ for Charles the Second by Union AluJ:?nus John Howard Payne and Washington·Irving \ Wednesday, September 28th at 8:30 P·m Thursday, September 29tb at 7:00 PM in Old Chapel Written inl824, Charles the Second was considered one of the best comedies of the Earl American Theatre.

I look around at my peers and see how much they've changed in our time together at Union. They look older, more \put to- gether.\ Their clothes are match- ing, and tucked in. Some are even beginning to adopt that \corpo- rate look.\ I look at myself and see the exact same person I was in high school. I do not look or feel my age, but I am beginning to feel the pressures of it. In re- sponse to the popular question, \What are you going to do after d t . \ \ I, gra ua 1011, my nonna reac- tion is to scream and cover my ears. Enough said about my ma- tmity. My goals are simple. I don't want to work. I want to have enough money to travel the globe comfortably, and I don't want to have to answer to anyone. Is that really so much to ask? Why should I, at the tender age of twenty-one, have to chain myself to a desk during what should, could, and WILL BE the best years of my life? After I leave this wonderful, nurturing institu- tion I am free to do what ever [ please. At least in my mind I am.

I'm talking beside the post-graduate period. No, I don't want to \head west\ and be a ski bum in Colo- rado, as most people with my \Generation X\ (how stupid is that?) career anxiety syndrome seem to do. Not that there's any- thing wrong with that, it's just that I'm not the best skiier in the world, and I'd feel a little silly bringing my sled to the slopes when everyone else was skiing. Not only that, but I want to take this fleeing reality thing to the extreme and leave the country. Get me away from this whole damn .place, and I'll be back when I'm ready to deal. I really just need to escape the following conversation: Q: What are you doing now that you've graduated? A: I don't know yet. Q: Well, what was yourmajor? A: English. Q: Qh, so you want to be a teacher? A: Not at all. Q: Oh, a writer then? A: I don't know. Q: Well, who is your favorite author? A: I don't have one. Q: Did you say you went to college?

ARTS & ENTERTAINMENT September 29, 1994, page 17 Union College Welcomes New Director/Coordinator ofYulman Theatre by Leena Mankad and Suzanne Robinson A&E Editors In its Bicentennial year, Union College has been blessed with a brand new stage. The new the- ater built near Richmond House will bring a breath offresh air into the entertainment and dramatic community here at Union. l11e highlight of this new theater is surely its 11ew director, Bill Finlay, who was hired last fal'l by both the Mountebanks theater organization and the administration. We had the pleasure of i11terviewing Mr. Finlay this past week and got the inside scoop on his plans for the upcoming years. Mr. Finely's office is supposed to be in the new theater, but ru- mor has it that the actual opening of the theater might be delayed until May. so we had to interview Mr. Finlay in his temporary office in the Arts' Building, which was most unique <;Ind appropriately decorated for a stage director. Deep within the old sculpture room in the Arts building is a quaint office fumished with the- CHOIR! ater props from the Nott memo- rial, everything from chairs to unicycles. Unicycles? Yes, uni- cycles. We'll get to that i11 a minute. Mr. Finlay is not just your av- erage theater director. He has some great ideas on directing as weJI as drama classes. Mr. Finlay and the college have a strong commitment to explore the lib- eral arts in new ways by creating some unique new classes. Among them are circus work- shops and com bat theater courses. Mr. Finlay's' unique background in this area will surely refresh the current curricu- lum in dramatic arts with both entertainment and fun. Mr. Finlay would also like to concen- trate on courses in advanced act- ing, scene study, movement for actors, and numerous workshops that hopefully will generate and further the campus community's interest in theater. Mr. Finlay taught at Boston University for 14 years prior to his new position here as a senior faculty member of the perfor- mance board. He was a theater DANCE! major at Rhode Island College and received his MFA in directing at the University of Connecticut. he is married and has one four-year old daughter. About halfway through the in- terview, we were interrupted by a very interesting phone calL A Spanish actress, who is teaching in Barcelona needed to speak with Mr. Finlay. Not your typical phone call, eh? When he retumed 'from his phone call, he was vibrant with a story involving his cmTent project. It is an off- Broadway production of Viva Commons. a project that Bill Finlay has been working on for ten years. The musical is based on the poetry of e.e. cummings. Some of us may know e.e. cummings as the guy with the .cool and somewhat bi- zarre structured poetry. Finlay was the only one to receive rights to the poet's work, which is an im- pressive feat all in itself. So far, Viva Commem· has played in the- ater festivals in South Ame1ica and will hopefully play in Denmark in 1996. Mr. Finlay hopes that one day, Vi1't1 will be big. Hey, Cats was based on T.S. Elliot's poetry, and look at how successful that became! Bill Finlay will definitely make things happen for the drama here at Union. In con- junction with the Mountebanks, the Perfonning Arts Department and the students here at Union, new and exciting things will defi- nitely occur. Who knows maybe, if you're lucky, Mr. Finlay will let you ride one of his unicycles. ORCHESTRA! JAZZ ENSEMBLE !

September 29, 1994, page 18 ARTS & ENTERTAINMENT THE REEL PICTURE: Terminal Velocity The Always Negative Film Review Column by Larry Paska Concordiensis Staff Starring Charlie Sheen, Nastassja Kinski. Directed by Devan Sarafain. Rated PG-13. Rating: ** In Terminal Velocity, Charlie Sheen attempts to do to his falter- ing box-office potential what Keamt Reeves did for his before .'ipeed, in Point Break. -When Poinl Break was released in 1991, Reeves was known only for his comic side as Ted Logan in the popular \Bill and Ted\ franchise. Although it was not a hit, Poinl Break made many aware of his action potential, and the fact he carried his acting abilities well above the star power of Patrick Swayze. But the new action \star cata- pult\ film does not do justice for Sheen, largely because it is as bland and devoid of life as Sheen's acting. He has never been a great action or comedy star, but he is a good action-com- edy actor (Hot Shots! is a good example). Throwing him in the already dead script of Velocity makes his faults really apparent. As skydiving instructor \Ditch\ Brodie, Sheen plays a man with a history of reckless- ness. When he reluctantly takes Kinski as his student, he does not watch his back carefully: in an instant, she has fallen out of the plane, never pulling the chute, and crashing to the ground. Brodie is blamed for the accident, with an FBI agent (Christopher McDonald) hot on his trail. But has she died? More impor- tantly, are we ever made to care? The answer to both questions(big surprise-she's the star of the film, stupid!) is no. Soon, Sheen displays his trademarkthe baffled . Even if you get thro\lgh this wildly improbable plot, it is doubtful you can make it past the lack of excitement and tired for- mulaic devices generated by di- rector Sarafain. Velocily rips-off or implies a rip-off to many good Should we say ''Strike Three, You're Out!\ to Sheen this year? This is mentioned· with his earlier duds, The Chase and Major League II, still in recent memory. expression when he meets Kinski and another fellow alive again. It tums out he has become the pawn of renegade espionage agents, and that Kinski is involved with all this. action films, like the cargo plane sequence from the Bond film, The Living Daylights. Unlike Bond, however, Sheen is not fun to watch. Perhaps anticipating this, Sarafain deliberately avoids fre- quent close-ups of Sheen in com- bat. A good idea, since the ac- tion sequences lack thrill and dar- ing-even when filmed from 5000 feet. This Point Break-wanna-be's. only salvation is that the time passes really quickly. Wheil the mild, nothing-you-haven't-seen- before scenes are through, you feel relieved it's over but glad you saw it, just to get to the finish. Incidentally, the comic epilogue doesn't agree with the film's tone, but if it was what the director had in mind, it would have made Ve- locity a fresh send..,up of preten- tious action films. Should we say \Strike Three, You're Out!\ to Sheen this year? This is mentioned with his earlier duds, 1Y1e Chase and Major League II, still in recent memory.

Don't Stand Too Close to a Naked Man, Couplehood hy Suzanne Robinson A &E Co-Editor Tu111 the TV on one night this week and you will more then likely catch a stand-up comic do- ing his routine. They won't be on the regular comedy hour. but more than likely they will have their own sit com about them- selves. You will be lucky if it isn't named aft~r them like Seinfeld or Ellen. Many have followed this new fad. some have failed, some have succeeded. But now stand- up comics have moved on to something other then TV shows about them - books about them. It first started with Seinfeld's Sein/,anguage and now is being followed with Tim Allen's book I Jon 't Stand Too (\lose lo a Na- ked Alan and Paul Reiser's ( ·ouplehood. Tim Allen, also known as Tim Taylor on ABC's hit show I lome Improvement, first decided to write a book in hopes of gaining new material. He wrote it be- tween takes of San/a, the movie he is staring in. He thought it would be fun but soon found out that writing a book isn't as easy as it seemed. He admits that just remembering the experience makes him upset. He did how- ever get help from David Rensin who helped him in \forming complete sentences\ and \orga- nizing the material\. In /)on 't Stand 1iw ('lose to a Naked Man, Allen talks about everything from the obvious- men's love of power tools- to the not so obvious - the 20-month prison term he served for selling drugs. However, at least half of the book is devoted to the battle between the sexes, the basis of Home fmprowme/11. Allen admits that his favorite line from the book is \the fact that no matter how much trouble men are to women- and it's a lot- it's women who raise us, who fonn us, and so they have to take credit for what we are.\ Allen closes up Don 'I Stand Too Close to a Naked Man, with the surprising joys of raising not a son, but a daughter. If you love his show and can't get enough of· it, then this is the book for you. Another newly released book wdtten by a stand-up comedian is Couplehood, Paul Reiser's latest book. You've all seen Reiser on his NBC show Mad Ahou/ You, battle out the trials and tribulations of marriage with his screen wife, Helen Hunt. In Couplehood, Reiser probes even fat1her into the depths of couples. TI1e book starts with Reiser's dilemma about how to propose to his future wife- \Should I be on my knee? Two knees? Should knees even be involved?\ and re- inforces his lovable character throughout. The book ends with their decision not to have children just yet. In Reiser's opinion on children he states, \Ideally they should give you a couple of'prac- tice kids' before you have any for real/ Sort of like bowling a few frames for free before you start keeping score.\ If you want to take a break from studying and want something light, these are the books for you.

September 29, 1994, page 22 The Curse Was Still There by Greg Kalish Assistant Sports Editor To know Ranger history or to know the history of the Stanley Cup is to know Red Dutton. Once the managing partner of a New York hockey team called the Americans, Dutton's team rivaled the Rangers from 1926 until 1940. It was in that final year, the year the Ranger's won their third Stanley Cup, that the Americans' lease to play at Madison Square Garden expired. The powers-that-be in the Garden hierarchy refused to renew the lease, in part due to the tre- mendous success the Rangers were enjoying. As a result, the Americans were forced to disband. Upon hearing the news, Dutton grimaced and is believed to have said \The Rangers will not win the Stanley Cup as long as I live.\ Thus, the curse of Red Dutton began. On June 14, 1994, as Craig MacTavish swept the puck off the face-off into the corner with 1.6 seconds remaining, the curse finally ended. Ten Presidents, three U.S. wars, and fifty-four years, three months and one day after their last Stanley Cup, the Rangers were once again hoisting the silver goblet. It was only the second time the Cup had made an appearance at Madison Square Garden, the first time being when the Bruins beat the Rangers in 1972. But do not think for one second that the infamous curse had been a non-issue. As a matter of fact, it loomed larger than it ever had. After sweeping through the Islanders in Round l and mak- ing quick work of another long time rival in the Capitals in Round 2, the Rangers looked as if they were going to breeze through the playoffs and conquer what is often thought to be the most difficult trophy to win in. all of sports with rela- tive ease. This would not be the case. While Dutton's curse must have been elsewhere while the Rangers won eight of the first nine playoff games they played, it made it's 1994 Garden debut in Game 1 of the Conference Finals. The Rangers took a one goal lead into the final minute, only to give up the lead and lose the game in double overtime. Curses! However, this team was greatly different from previous Ranger teams who had entered the playoffs with the same wealth of optimism and potential the 1994 team possessed. Unlike previous teams which opted to shy away from the aura of the curse. this team stared 1940 right in the face. So after the Game 1 setback, while fans were fearing the worst, the Rangers bounced right back taking Games 2 and 3. But after losing the next two, including a horrific home ice per- formance in Game 5, it looked like this was going to be another year of failure. The curse would once aga,in reign victorious. Or would it? What happened after the Devils took a 2-0 lead in Game 6 is something that will go down in sports lore as one ofthe greatest single game performances by any athlete. Mark Messier, after guaranteeing a victory the day before, pulled the Rangers from the fire by registering a third period hat trick to lead the team to victory. But that curse refused to quit. It was alive and well when Valerie Zelepukin tied Game 7 with 7. 7 seconds remaining in regulation. It made its way into Kirk McLean's goal crease in overtime of Game I of the Finals when fifty-four shots on goal were not enough to beat the Canuck goaltender. It was doing all it could in Game 5, when the Rangers came home with an opportunity to win the Cup on Garden ice. After trailing 3-0. the Rangers mounted a furious come- back to tie the game in the third period, only to be followed by three Vancouver goals and a Ranger loss. Then finally, Game 7. The Rangers led 2-0, but nothing could come easy, not with the curse still wreaking havoc. It was 2-1, then 3-1, then 3-2 with fifteen minutes remaining in the third period. The longest fifteen minutes of a Ranger fan's life were to follow. The team worked hard, the fans screamed incessantly, and the curse was swept out of the Garden rafters. With five minutes left, Nathan Lafayette hit the post just to the left of goalie Mike Richter, the last gasp. Soon thereafter, it was over, and a celebration the likes of which sports has rarely seen was underway. Won- der of wonders, miracle of miracles, the Rangers won the Stanley Cup. SPORTS Athlete of the Week: Jen Manna by Mike Ledi'ng Concordie11sis Stoff As a new year of Union sports begins, we are yet again honored to continue the tradition of Ath- lete ofthe Week. The first honor of the bicentennial year, goes te Women's Soccer goalie Jennifer Manna. Manna, a senior from Clifton Park, New York, has en- joyed much success in her four years with Union Soccer. ln her freshman campaign Manna re- corded twelve victories, nine of which were shutouts. As a result of her excellent rookie season, Manna was awarded the Terris Award at the Block U banquet. Her sophomore andjuniorcalll- paigns were not as successful as her first. but her numbers we~e still impressive. Through the I 992 and 1993 seasons, Manna recorded fifteen more wins, and posted an additional eight shut- outs .. Manna's senior campaign has seen the Women's Soccer squad off to a 2-4 start, due in no part to her excellent goaltending. Through the first six games of the season Manna has allowed only ten goals 011 88-shots, an ph ot\ hy SctJft impressive feat. Her most recent accomplishment was a t .. o shut- out (the eighteenth of her career) versus Clarkson. The victory snapped a four game losing streak for the Dutchwomen.. Congratu- lations to Jeimifer, and good luck to the entire Women's Soccer squad in the rest of their endeav- ors .. Soccer Succumbs to Vassar by Jason Starr Contributb1g Writer Union's men's soccer needed this game. This was to be the game that would save them from a disappointing record of I and 4 and boost the team to a respect- able level in their division. TI1e team was coming off an upsetting ove1time loss to Albany and look- many missed opporttmities for the Dutchmen. Vassar's answer to Union's threat was provided .by a fresh- man named Rob Morrissey. . It was midway through the second half when Morrissey beat the last Union defender at the eighteen yard mark and booted a low roller past the Union goalie and into the lower right comer oft he net. This Jeremy Lieblwff in pursuit of tile hall. (photo by Joslt Haines/TC) ing forward to this game afa. pos- sible win, something they have not had since Sept em her 13 when they beat Hamilton. Unfortu- nately things did not work out for Union in this one and that dreaded I and 4 is now theirs. Tite game started out as a see- saw battle played at or near midfield with neither team able to penetrate the opposing defense. After ten minutes of this type of play it was dear to everyone in attendance that these two teatns were evenly matched. The first bit of excitement came when Union's Jeremy Liebhoffmade a run that was initiated from a Vassar corner ~ick. He pen- etrated deep into· the Vassar de- fense but failed to get off a qual- ity shot. This was the first of gave vassar the one-nil advan- tage. At this point in the game, Union's offense seemed to open up and create some decent oppor- tunities for itself. One of these chances was ruined by an offsides call. Another was foiled by a beautiful sprawling save by Vassar goalie Chris Miller off a decent shot by Liebhoff. But pet- haps the best scoring bid of the ftt•st half came off a Union cor- ner kick that settled on the foot of midfeilder Thomas Feldman. However, the kick sailed high and the Dutchmen were forced to settle for a I -0 half-time deficit to a team that they outplayed for the majority of the half. At the outset of the second. half, I expected to see Union's offense come out firing, but it did not. A flat Union offet'lse meant that Vassar controlled the ball and put a few scares in the hearts of the Dtltchi~en and their supporters. Two Vassar shots came off cor- ner kicks and another from a pretty run by number 13 Ben Jacobson who managed a hard shot that was stifled by an equally pretty save. Twenty minutes of this type of play was enough to prompt Union's coach, Aldo Nardiello, to pull members of his defense up on comets and throw ins deep in Vassar territory. David Granwetter was used in this ca- pacity as he went from defender to offender in these situat·ions. However, Miller was able to handle the extra Dutchmen of- fense by grabbing many of the comer kicks out of the air before a Union player could make a play on the ball. With fifteen minutes left to play, the momentum of the game began to shift in Union's favor. Vassar began to sit on their lead and seemed content to try to run out the clock by playing a game of boot and run. This is when Union's offensive pressure be- came most heated. Liebhoff and sophomore Geoff Sipperly ap- plied most of the pressure for the Dutchmen. Unfortunately for everyone involved in Union soc- cer, the Vassar defense was able to hold off the Union attack de- spite a good number of quality chances supplied mostly by Liebhoff and Sipperly. Although a record of 1-4 is not a desirable thing, the Dutchmen can salvage the season if they tum things around today. nley have no more time to spare. For this reason, their next game against Middlebury means everything.

SPORTS September 29, 1994, page 23 Women's Tennis lmproJJes· to 4-2 Behind Strong Performances (SI) The women's tennis team at Union College got offto a fast start as they won their fitst three matches. Senior Julie Anderson (Glens Falls, NY), Union's No. l singles player throughout her ca· reer, has won five of her six matches and now shows a cai·eer singles record of25-l2. Her only loss this season was to Williams. Seniors Chantal Von Saherand Rachel Goldfine, Union's second and third singles players, .came into the season with respective career records of 18-13 and 16- 4. Von Saber, w;I10 is 3.:3 this sea- son, has been the Dutchwomen ;s No. 2 player throughout her ca- reer while Goldfine, who did not play singles as a freshman, played No. 5 as a sophomore aud No. 4 last year. She is also 3-3 out of the No.3 position thus far. Junior Atny Kessinger is 4-2 out of the No. 4 position after posting an 8-1 reeord .last year from the No.5 spot and freshman Katherine Ott is 3\3 from the No. 5 position. \These players are competitive and willing to work hard to do what it takes to be successfttl,\ said second-year head coach Joanne Little.

Fair weather, ary:l a pmticularly grotesque pitch, set the stage for the U .R.F .C.'s first match. Doz- ens of faithful spectators came early. Surely such a display of spm1s· manship in friendly competition has not been witnessed on cam- pus since the old days of fifteen man rugby. \Creative criticism and witty banter were the themes of the day,\ said Union prop, Ja- son .. fists offury\ Rothschild, in Football Rolls to Another Win Continued from page 24 rolled up 415 yards of total offense. Hobart managed 313, but only 64 of those came in the first half, when the game was still in question. There were some flaws in the Ui1ion armor (including four lost fumbles)that they will have to work on, but as for now, they are playing well enough to win, and. win big. a post-match interview. Union began the match full of optimism and Bloody Marys, led by captains Chris \Ate Man\ Bangs and George. M~ral sup- pm1 was of course sttpplied by the wearer of the magic socks. The first try of the game was scored by Chris \Bionic Legs\ DeLano (a wing!), assisted by the truck and rookie Angelo Bagodoughnuts. Serum l1alf and club president Seth \the only rugger in history to not have a nickname\ Brown converted the tty to give Union a 7-0 lead at half time. The final minutes oft he second halfbelied the detennination and incredible physical condition of Union's Cocks. A three point penalty kick and a fluke try by R.P.l's backs clinched the match at 10-7 in the engineers' favor. All agreed afterward that the star of the game was definitely the Referee who, for some reason, got out of town really, really quick. Union's B-side, composed al- most entirely of rookies, played a fine match, defeating R.P.I. 's B's by at least 87-0. Union's rookie Serum Half, John Q. Stinkee,.did not stop grinning 'tin Monday aftetiloon. Come out next Saturday to watch Union's stalwart ruffians battle the Potsdan1 Polecats, at one o'clock under the grim shadow ofthe Nott Memorial. X-Country Runs- Well The women's cross country team at Union College opened with a pair of wins as the Dutchwon:ten took the meet's top three spots against New Paltz and Oneonta. Junior captain Liza Morse won the 5 kilometer event in 21 :26 followed by freshman Kelly Jamieson, who had a 21:54, and sophomore Sarah Morse with a22:l7. Unlo11 bested New Paltz, 15-47, and Oneonta 19-39. Jamieson was Union's top fin- isher in an 15-50 loss against Hamilton and placed 32nd in the Williams Invitational with a 23:19. The DLttchwomen fin- ished eighth out of nine teams with 228 points. Meanwhile, the men opened with a 23-34 ·victory over New Paltz for first-year head coach Charlie Casey as the Dutchmen captured three of the top four positi10ns.

September 29, 1994 PAGE24 Fighting Dutchmen Bombard Hobart 42-14 Football Team to Take 3-0 Record On theRoatl Against Dickinson . by Ken Berman Concordien,sis Staff In an impressive display of a powerful offense and a big-play defense, Union humbled visiting Hobart on Sattrrday, 42-14 before a crowd of 3,000 at Frank Bailey Field. Frank Attah led Union on the ground, with 114 yards rushing and I touchdown, while Keith Lombardo directed the traffic at qumterback, completing 10 of his 16 attempts for 155 yards and two touchdowns. Mario Maltese and Mike White led the defense all day long, with 18 tackles between them. The game was Union's from the outset, as they roared to a 28-0 lead before the end of the first half, allowing them to simply glide through the second half. l orning into the game. the teams seemed to be two StJuads going in different directions. llohart. picked early on lobe one of Union's toughest opponents of the season. was 0-2 and coming off ;1 bad loss last \\eck. Union. meanwhile. vvas 2-0. ranked number ttl in the New York Poll, and flying high from a 29-10 victory over WPI. The script played out to perfection, as Hobart won the opening toss, and lost everything else. The Statesman received the ball, and could muster only 3 yards. After receiving the punt, Union took over on their own 37, and marched down the rest ofthe field in only 7 plays. Attah accounted for 46 and the touchdown by himself, mnning over, around and through the hapless Hobart defense, leaving one particular defensive back with a clear view of the blue sky. Union led, 7-0, and the game was barely 2 minutes old. Frank Attall agai11st Robart. Tile junior runni11g back ruslledjor 114 yards in Union's 15tll straigltt win.(plwto by Scott Druckemiller/TC) The teams traded their next three possessions. neither squad being able to secure a firstdown. Hobart, on their fourth possession, was faced with an important 3rd and 1., in Union territory. They completed the pass, but tlley immediately fumbled, and Union end Denton Randolph was there. He picked up the ball and scampered home 61 yards for the touchdown making it 14-0 midway through the first. Union stopped the visitors twice more, but their own drive was stopped by a fumble. They were eager to score some points, though, and were not to be denied again. Taking over at their own 36, they drove for the touchdown in 7 plays once again, highlighted by a 26 yd. Chris Irving run, and a 24 yd. TD reception by Sharon Morton. A 4th Dutchmen touchdown to end the half left Union with 28 points, Hobart with only 64 yards of offense, and the Statesman faithfuls looking for ticket refunds. Hobart came out flying in the second half, but it proved to be too little, too late. Two long touchdown passes from Waye to Heitner pulled them to within 14, but the Dutchmen, feeling a slight sense of urg.ency, got a touchdown only 5 plays later on a 52 yd. pass from Lombardo to Bemardo, to put the game out of reach. A 37 yd. pass from Scott Newton to a rambling, tackle- breaking Sharon Morton rounded out the scoring. Kicker Egbert finished his day a perfect 6-6 on extra points. All told, Union Contilmed 011 page 2J Young Field Hockey Team Competitive (SI)- Coach Charlyn Robert's · field hockey team has won three of its first seven games and has been extremely competitive in all seven outings.

Freshman Kathryn Gross has contributed three goals while four other players- senior Missy Lombardoni, juniors Michelle McCarte and Lorene Kaminski and sophomore Christina Jabbour have all found the back of the net twice. Junior goalie Elana Goldberg, a backup the last two seasons, has done a solid job for the Dutchwomen. Goldberg has re- corded43 saves while allowing nine goals with one shutout. De- fensive tnates, senior sweeper Jen Brown, senior center. back Molly Pearsall, sophomore left back Karin Averill, and fresh- man right back Stefanic Speanburg have done a good job in front of Goldberg thus far. Union's defense, which lost its goalie, sweeper and left back from last year's I 0-A-1 New York State playoff team, have limited the opposition to an av- erage of 10 shots a game. \I'm very pleased with the progress of our young defensive players,\ said Robert. \We knew we had an experienced attack to start the year, the ques .. tion was how long it would take the defensive people to get to- gether as a cohesive unit.
