Daughters II Examines Women in; U~ion 's History by Emily Schwartz Contributing Writer Our College motto states: \Un- der the laws of Minerva, we all become brothers.\ However, who is Minerva, and what are her laws? This past weekend, perfor- mances of Minerva's_Daughters //attempted to answer these ques- tions by portraying the lives of fivewomen in Union's history- women who were important to Union before the admission of women in 1970. The show, a \Docu/Dance/ Drama,\ used 'historical docu- ments. like newspaper articles and personal letters. as well as dance and drama to pass on the stories of five w,omen of the 20th century, woven together with the story of the challenge between Minerva and Arachne. Arachne was the best weaver among hu- mans and wished to supersede Minerva as the greatest among both gods and mortals. The first story ofthe show was that of Maude Adams. Maude, played by Jean Kestenbaum, was an actress who received the first Honorary Degree Union ever be- stowed upon a woman. In addition to playing well- loved parts sliCh as Peter Pan, Maude also wor~ed at GE to de- velop stage lighting that was easier to work with and more re- liable. Alma Gluck, a Metropolitan Opera singer, sang at the dedica- tion of the Payne Gate and gave a concert to raise money for Alumni Gym. During her story, in which Alma was played by Sylvia Briber, the audience learned of Alma's generosity to- wards the school. The. audience even got to hear Ms. Briber sing during the show. Ruth Young Jandreau, the third woman portrayed in Minerva's Daughters II, was played by Carole Smith. Ruth was a pow- erful woman who sat on a national labor union board and worked towards things l-ike day care cen- ters and equalpay for equal work:· In the 1970'sshe was the Assis- tant Dean of Graduate and Spe- cial Programs at Union. Sally Gage, played by Etta Fink, state& proudly \I was married to two . · Union College.Men.\ Sally wor~e9, in her twenties as the \Vogue Girl,\ working with high school girls to sell sub,. scriptions to Vogue Magazine for a commission. Later, she worked as a teacher' for gifted students. Janet Fentiman Crandell, played by Janet herself, workedatUnion and, upon discovering that col_; fege employees were pennitted to take .one class per terrn free of . charge, began to work towards her bachelors degree in sociology She was one of the first five fe- male graduates from Union, and was one of two of Union's first female inductees into Phi Beta Kappa. Other parts were played by Vaughn Ward, Gail George, RacheHe Smith-Stallman, Carl George, Dan West and students Karen a Cronin, Raquel Millman, Emily DeSantis, Justine Willey and Leena Mankad. Cronin, commenting on work- ing with the older women in the cast, said, \The actresses were as energetic, talented and intriguing as the women they portrayed. It was a wonderful experience to work with them.\ . The show was not only enter- taining, it also showed how women were an important part of Union through out its history. Michelle Jester said thatthe show was \a fascinating project that brings to life the women behind the scenes ofthe male dominated stronghold we affectionately call Union.\ In fact, Minerva's Daughters !I was a well per- formed piece that could teach ev- eryone at Union a little rnore about who Minerva was, what her laws were, and the WGmen who helped make U11ion what it is to- day. this friday .,. · G·,ANT MfJD-SliDE Olin _Deconstruction Day • The 20 foot bridge weighed only ISO pounds and was assembled by Barth, McNerney, Wies, and Stolicky in 5 minutes and 12 sec- onds. During the load test, the steel bridgedeflected about one-half of an inch with 2500 pounds (1 1/4 tons) on the road surface. Union College won first place in the con- struction .speed, economy, and aesthetics categories. This was enough to eam the team firstplace overaH in the Pen-Del Confer- ence The second place bridge from Penn State weighed only <.l2 pounds, but required a 17 minute asserrtbly time. Next the team will travel to RJT along with the concrete canoe to compete in the Upstate New York Conference. A first or second place finish in this conference will eam the team a trip to the national competition in California.

' New Political Group Starting on Campus \Grass Roots'·' Offers All'Parties a Political Forum by Matt Sandler StaffWriter Does anything happen? This · is the most asked question and topic of many articles in The Concordiensis. Grass Roots is a new Political Science club that has doubled its number in two days. Wewanttodouble it again. So what is this club? First and foremost it istohave a good time. Second, it is to raise awareness of political issues through a Voice, your voice, and Action, your ac- tion. Our debates will NOT con- sist of whether the school should go totrimesterorsemester. To an- swer the question, it will stay the way it is. Rather our debates will consist of Abortion, Affirmative Action,. the Death Penalty, · Ebonies, alild other con~roversial issues. Both sides will be fairly represented, however, it will still be a Crossfire environment. So what is this new group go- ing to do? On May 6,.at 12:15 in a room in the Co liege Center (the room number will be provided) the tlrst in a series of bi-weekly lunches will take place. This is an infonnal get togetherto.discuss · issues, meet new people, and plan whem we are going. Currently, the Constitution and budget are being formalized for the fall. Week eight is planned for ourtirst debate, most likely on Abortion (information will be provided at a later date). ~ Our plans tor the fall · ' coJ1sist 6f'possible trips into Al- bany and/or Washington, D.C. We want to bring in speakers, and continue our debates and bi- weekly lunches. The issue has been raised of forming a bi- weekly political cartoon, pro- duced by the members of Grass Roots, to raise awareness, to get people involved, and to bring out creativity. The long tenn goal is to engage in letter writing campaigns, inter- actions with Congress, and other grass roots initiatives. Tremen- dous lobbying is already taking place inside the organization to press the Federal Budget and En- titlements to the forefront. The problems defined briefly and how it will effect you: *Social Security is a tax and there is no trust fund. Current workers pay current retirees ben- efits. The trust fund is an ac.count- ing device, nothing more. The system was fine in 1950 when there was 16 workers to one re- tiree. Today the ratio is 3:1 and will soon fall with the Baby Boomers soon to retire in 15 years: your parents. *The economy grows with a strong savings rate. The U.S. lags behindthe industrial world. *Medicare is almost bankrupt. *If nothing is changed, by 2012 Entitlements and interest on the National Debt (currently over $250 billion on a $5.3 trillion Debt) will consume all tax rev- enues collected by the federal government. *Social Security has liabilities (promises to current retirees and soon to be retired Boomers) of$8 trillion, yes TRILLION. i-~ *Mil•itary and Ciyil Service pension has I iabilities of $7 tril~ lion. *Even with a balanced budget by 2002, the Congress would have to cut an additional $465 billion, $93 billion a year for the next five years to account for the money \borrowed\ from Social Security. ';f<The Cost of Living Adjust- ment (COLA) based on the Con- sumer Price Index is overstated by one percentage point (in other words it is wrong), a change to the real rate would save $281 bil- l ion over seven years. *The National Debt increases by $9000 a second. There is more and this will be discussed on May 6, but this is a representation of the problem. How it will affectyouPERSON- ALL Y, is that YOU and later YOUR CHILDREN will PAY HIGHER TAXES and enjoy a LOWER STANDARD OF LIV- lNG. Also, when benefits are cut, and do not think they will Rot be, your pareRts will be affected. We did not create this mess, but the buck has beeF! passed and can only go so far, and it will fall to us. It is in your best interest to get involved. Our efforts will seek to address these issues. There is no need for paralysis of fear. A voice joined by many, acting, is a political force. Thank-you. Again, we will deal with serious issues, but we want to have fun as,w.el/.

Upper Hudson, a:long with 33 other Planned Parenthood groups will participate in the trial .until 3,000 women have used the drug treatment. The drug combinatio.n is an in- jection of one drug along with a vaginal use of another drug. Ac- cording to Plaimed Parenthood officials, the drug will induce a \miscarriage\ effect of cramps and bleeding. Medical abortions are being looked at as the new possible availability for women who want them. In Europe, the drug-induced abertions are widely available, however, because of political rea- sons, women have not had access to the dmgs. The benefits, suggested by doc- tors, is the comfort doctors have in administering a prescription procedure. People ages 15-18 will need parental permission be- · cause the process :will be occur- ring at home. The drug injected to begin the aborting process is Methotrixate which prevents fetal ~Is from dividing. Tl:ie vaginal drug which women insert vaginally five to seven days later is called Misoprestol which will cause the uterus to \contract and conclude the pregnancy.\ The drug com- bination is 90 percent effective in causing an aborti011.

Congratulations, Jared! (And don't forget about fellow \Student of the Week\ Adam Richman's Art Show on Page 18). by Jared Richman Cartoonist & StaffWriter I have met the Anti-Christ here at Union Col\ege, W~ll, at least I have seen some pretty convincing evidence of llis exist- ence. After all, there is a fine line between good and evil. You don't believe me? Look at the average politician (local, state, national, or even student). Many of these fine men and women truly believe that their task is to better the I ives oftheir con- stituencies, and some actually succeed in transcending the lures of corruption. But there is probably an equal number of pol i- ticians who \serve\ the public only to serve themselves. Now, don't get me wrong, I see nothing inherently evil in being self- serving now and again; dreams and hap- piness are often achieved by single-minded selfishness. However, like I said, there is a fine line between good and evil. Step- ping on someone else's fingers on your way up the ladder does not constitute what I consider to be a \good\ type uf selfish behavior. When one deliberately and knowing!;' takes advantage of a situation, doing others wrong while themselves gain- ing from the misfortune of others, this my friends is evil. Theologians and philosophers have been arguing over the existence ofgoo<l and evil for centuries. Certainly, I am not quali- fied to make grand statements about the moral nature of men and have it become dogma. I'd leave that to the church.es of the world. However, by expressing my opin- ions I have often been accused of cynicism and pessimism, especially in regards to this campus. Statements like these always make me chuckle a bit. I just don't have the heart to tell them that I am a fully con- fessed romantic. The fact that I try to ex~ pose depravity and apathy may seet:n to make me an arrogant cynic (perhaps true as well), but I think it also stand as a testa- ment to my faith that WE CAN DO BET- TER. I know we can, because I have seen it. If college has taught me any one thing, it is that we live in a world of extremes. Good, evil, sober, drunk, fat, skinny, loud, quiet, bald, hairy, smart, dumb, ignorant, wise- these exist as relative terms. For every ignorant, prejudiced moron I have met a Union (trust me they exist, I have met an equally open-minded, hrilliant saint. l am continually coming in co11tact with ge- nius here everyday in the form of students who love that they do, be it painting, play- ing music or football, arguing about Goethe ·or Greenspan, bettering the -w<Jrld or them- selves. I thank God for these people, for they reaffirm my belief in the benevolent nature and capacity for greatness I see in the human race. And as for evil, I suppose I can only put my faith in karma. For those individuals who seemingly lack the soul of a spiritual being there must be a special place reserved in hell, roasting in eternal fire right next to Hitler and Manson. Yet, the little portion of my heart that wants them to burn is none- theless a vestige of that evil that I myself denounce. I am, perhaps, uverly concerned about the actions of others, a11d should, as I have been repeatedly told, worry more about myself. Good advice for a Utopia. But we live in a different W<lrld of harsh reality where good does not a !ways prevai I -at least not initially. Realistic? Yes, people illuminate the good ofthis life. If I seem to highlight wl1at'swrong more often than I highlight what is right, then I am achieving my goal: asking the world to open its eyes to injustice and will have to suffice as the extent of rny ,gushing. So, while I know what some day, those lying, cheating, self~serving bastards will leave my College, they will be replaced by oth- ers, and I will enter a world filled with more than I can count. It would he foolish to assume that I could erase allofthe evil, but then again if we did, wha:t -would I write about? ·comments? Questions? Praise for student ~nitiated research projects not pertaining to film? Drop me a virtual line at richman.i@idoLunion.edu.

. . . Page 6 • May 1 , 1997 • ijJJp,~ QLnu;odti£asis ·. · National News. National News Opposing Viewpoints Jody Mousseau Staff Writer The issue of prayer in public schools did not end the issue O<f the separation of church and state h1 the United States. On Saturday, April 26, an article appeared OR the internet stating that \Republicans Urge Americans to Pray More;\ Re- publican Representative J.&hn Christensen of Nebraska announced a national day of prayer on May 1 for the purpose of Americans to, as the article stated, \make praver a part of their lives.\ By no means do I oppose rrayer, nor do I oppose complete freedom of religion. For those individuals who do choose to practice religion, prayer is a significant porti(}R of their lives. I do oppose, however, the Republican request to have a national day of prayer on May 1. One of the basic rights and fr~ed:oms which disting'i.tishes our nationfron1 many other contemporary societies is that we have the freedom of reli- gion. This means that any i11di- vidual has the right to practice any religion he or she wishes. It also implies that any individual has the right not to practice a religion.. Although the national da:y of prayer is by no means a natkmal holiday, by annou11cing that M.ay 1 is a national day of prayer, the Re- publican request disrespects the right of those who choose not to practice a religion. Those in<lividu- als who would take part in the na- tional day of prayer are most lil<ely those individuals who are in cl1t.trch or synagogue on Sahtrday or San- day. The primary reason why pro- claiming a national day of prayer is wrong is the common argumenttll.at From the Left. • • this country was built to maintain a f.PJ:'Iflration of :-':11.:m:oh ~:n.d state. Some argue otherwise, but proclaiming na~ tional prayer by any means of legis- Iati<m or as a part of any goverm.nen- tal exercise goes against this convic- tion. For this reason alone, the issue of prayer in public schools remains an endless d.e bate. To maintain a separation of church and state, we must practice a separation of church and state. If May 1 were not pro- claimed to be a national day of prayer, those who wish to pray on any day, including May 1, would by no means be prevented from doing so. Another reason why a national day of prayer is wrong is political motives. In the article cited, Christensen was quoted as stating, \We can pray that our partial-birth abortion ban becomes law.\ TI1e day of prayer is meant, in a political sense, to strengthen fan1ily values and to strengthen trust and vi:rtue in society, which is fine. However, it is also implied that ther~ is a hidden political agenda. What.about those individuals who do notwishto pray for Republican legislation? Can they too be included on this day of prayer? The Republican intention of pro- claiming a national day of prayer is good hearted, though it occurs in the Iigll.t of a twisted political agenda. Christensen's announcement only contributed to the enduring debate of the conflict between religion and state, which does not shed light of being solved any moinent soon. Though I am not against prayer or the freedom of religion, proclaiming a national day of prayer is constitu- tionally wrong. People will pray ac- cording to their own beliefs . when and where they wish, not just on May1. Mark Anderson Contributing Writer Congress in the next few weeks will be voting on some critical mea- sures that will affect most Ameii- cans. The Republicans have de- cided that in the 105th Congres-- sional session, one of their major agendas is a reduction of the capi- tal gains tax. Although briefly aban- doned, Newt and other fellow Re- publicans determined that this tax would be an instrumental factor in changing the entire tax. code. A reduction in the capital gai::ns tax is challenged by tax and spend liberals. Dick Gephardt, Democrat minority leader,. claims that this tax only goes to the wealthy:, or those who make more than $200,000 a year. However, he is wr01~g. This tax goes to everyone who realizes a loss or a gain on assets, land, real estate, or stocks. Simply, anyone who owns a house and then tries to sell it for a higher price than they paid for it, pays at least 28 perce11t of that. It is hardly fair for the fed- eral government to collect money to which it is not entitled. A tax reduction for the rich is hardly true. Seventy-three percent of the realizations on capital gains comes from families that make ttn- der $75,000, and raises to 83 perce11t for families with an income of less than $100,000. This tax can affect at least 44 percent of the elderly (over the age of 65), which takes away from retirement funds. Now, Republicans dd not want any of the elderly to be forced out onto the streets, Rather, we want to let them keep their money so they can live luxuriously. Besides help- ing the middle class, this tax also does benefit the upper class. When From the Right. • • the upper class has more money, it trickles down into other the classes, which helps them in many ways. Therefore, the stat~ment that a tax redu.ction goes mainly to the rich is false; while the wealthier income tax payers show the highest dollar amount of capital gains, there. are also more loweT- and middle-in~ come taxpayers realizing capital gains. Lowering the capitalgains tax can ultimately raise federal revenue. How can that happen?, you may ask. The answer is simple. There are many investors who will not cash in on their gains, thereby \locking in\ l:hejr money into real estate or shares of stock. With a lower tax rate, in- vestors will be able to realize these gains, which will more than make up for any loss from the lowered tax. Thus,· it raises the federal revenue. After all, rt1ore revenue for the fed- eral government is g~od for the na- tion. This tax helps business, too. It is true that a reduction in the capital gains tax increases_investment. An increase in investment by business creates job openings ahd therefore helps the middle and lower classes. Most importantly this helps small businesses, by which the majority of Americans are employed. One cannot fathom the reasons put up by the opposition. A reduc- tion in the capital gains tax s~ems only to help America and the people that make it work. Even Clinton has said that a reduction is possible, but unfortunately his word cannot be trusted and a veto can be expected. Hopefully.~ Republicans and Democrats in Congress :realize the importance a capital gains tax reduc- tion. Then and only then can Re- publicans work on the largest task of all, reform of the income tax. President Calls for Hand-In-Hand Action Erinn Gregg Staff Writer In the shadow of Independe11ce Halt President Clinton kicked o:ff the President's Summit for America's Future early Monday morning. \The event, which has been planned for two years, brought in over 1 1 700 community and state delegatesr who represent over 170 rural and urban communities, all 50 states, and five territories. The group will meet for three days in an effort to provide the 11 million young people at :risk in America today with the resQurces they need to succeed. Among those joining Presi d tJnt Clinton are his cochair President Bush, Nancy Reagan, and the Gen- eral Cha,irman, Colin Powell. Orga- nized at the initiative of the Corpo- ration for National Service and the Points of Light Foundation, the group has three majol\ goals. First is their commitment that every young person has access to five ba- sic fundamentals for life, including an ongoing relation with a caring young adult whether it be a mentor, a tutor, or a coach; safe places and structured activities during non- school hours in order to learn and grow; a healthy start; marketable skill through effective education; and opportunity to give back through community service. Next, national leaders are to announce their own commitments to action. Finally, the delegates will work to- gether to turn the message of the summit into concrete plans for ac- tion. On a day that President Clinton said would \redefine citizenship/,. the ceremonies began at the Penn- sylvania Convention Center in downtown Philadelphia. In their opening mission statement, the President and his predecessors chal- lenged America's youth to volunteer to ensure a better future for th.e country's youth. President Clinton spoke to the crowd of 3,000 Mon- day, saying, './The era of big govern- ment may be over, but the era of challenges is not.\ He then contin- ued by calling Americans to an era of big citizenship believing that \[w)e can change America if we all do it together, hand in hand, com- numity by comniunity.\ In conclu- sion, the President pledged that over the next four years the Department of Defense and Transportation would mentor one million children each, while federal agencies would adopt 2;000 schools, Throughout the week, the del- egates will be meeting around the city of Philadelphia, dedicated to their reforms and to the call to ser- vice in which they ask all Americans to participate. They feel that with everyone's individual commitments to service and voluntary action, we can make the future of America a better and brighter place for the fu- ture.

The letterwasshortand tucked away in the corner ofthe page, so it wasn't unti I I read through the paper iater that evening while relaxing on the porcelain throne that I even dis- covered ~he article. It was puz- zlingly titled \The Final Word on The Fashion Show,\ by Jermifer Trotts. Initially, I wonderedwhy the editors had decided to imply in their headline that discussion was finished. I later came to find out that it was not their intention to imply this but was rather due to their apparent circumvention of any thought process. Two sentences into the article, I thought it was going to be a short Did you ever stop to think about why people are so much nicer during spring tenn? Maybe it's just us, or we could blame it on the nice weather. That is, if any nice weather comes soon. It's not that being nice is bad or any- thing. Hey, it's almost May, and you know what that means, right? Well, as every other college finishes school, we are still here in full-effect. We think thatthis is definitely a good thing. It does not seem like if s time to go back home and to have to deal. We mean to actually work to make money, so that we can come back next year and spend it. Just think about all your hard work putnp- ing gas or flipping burgers when you decide to waste your money on beer ... we mean video games. Well, everything is under con- trol, we guess. We continue to see naked people around the cam- pus. Walking around catnpus naked in daylight is especia11y letter telling me not to scrutinize acharitableeventtoo closely-· a somewhat legitimate point. My indifference to her article quickly ceased before the end of her first paragraph when she referred to fair racial representation as \an overrated issue.\ I really couldn't believe I was reading a legitimate signed letter from a \student\ of higher learning, as she continued on to say that she, as a Californian, had as much a right to fair and equal representa- tion as blacks, Iatinos, or any other racial minority. Right on, Jennifer--the selec- tion committee was extremely narrow-minded in neglecting to represent the unique culture of California. I must admit that I, as a snowboarder, was extremely upset that they did not include any classy when you see a tour. Maybe the Gatekeepers should get in on it and give their tours naked. How does that sound to you? We were just wondering if this was a nudist college in the spring. Maybe we were misin- fonned. First~ all that we knew of were the naked Nott runs, but we guess this school has much more to offer. Hey, if that's the way you want to portray yourself, then go right ahead. You could even start your own club or some- thing. Hey, remember how nice we just said people are during spring term? Well, we'll have to take one step back. This rotten weather makes everyone feel a little down. Just don'ttake your · low spirits out on some unfortu- nate souls. Chances are, they feel the same as you do.

I'm wnting an article for thi11 wee)('s paper. · Who should I write about this week? Honestly, I'm kind of sick of your articles. They ar-e rude. degradillg. and insulting. All of your articles are personal attacks. Why don't you try . focusing ort the positive aspects of Union? people have something culturally different to share with the ·com- munity (even Californians). You would probably also agree that we could not possibly represent them all, so choices have to be made (or ignored, as they were in the fashion show). This choice should not be completely arbi- trary. Rather, the prevalence and strength ofa culture should influ- ence this decision, keeping in mind that we are aH students, who, by definition, desire to be exposed tonewthings. There are several large organi- zations on campus, such as ALAS and CELA, that exist to represent racial minorities and to promote the respect and understanding of their various cultures. In other words, there are large numbers of students who identify themselves as belonging to a somewhat unique cult1:1re~ many of them believe that they should be fairly represented in events like the fashion show ... and why shouldn't they? I would not be concerned if the ignorance had escalated to. its peak atthis point, because up un- til this point .of the :Jetter I was only in sharp disagreement with Trotts. . By the last paragraph, however, my disagreement quickly changed to shock You wrete how you were tired of '\hearing about minority students waiting to have things handed to them on a platter.\ My initial re- action was to write nothing in re- sponse. If you had advanced this far in your I ife and education and still possessed these beliefs, what could I possibly write to enlighten your ignorantself. Then, after having a few ran- dom conversations with people on campus, I began to think that Ms. Trotts was frighteningly far from alone in 'her beliefs. Once again, as \so .often is the case, many Union students just don't get it, and probably won't ever. I may be too optimistic about our student body, but I hoped that if I wrote, somebody might be motivated to do some~ thing about their ignorance. T h u r b e r v ill e ·~by Rawson Thurber After a short creative respite, I'm refreshed and ready to go. So, what could possibly be this week's Top Ten List? Well.; there are many students .in the senior class working diligently to bring a two- faced antique clock to Union as the Senior Gift for the class of'97. ·While I personally teel that a Gazebo in Jackson's Garden might've been the wa:y to go, l will bow to the voice of the maj9rity vote and . pull with all the force I can muster to aid the class of'97 in our effort to leave something behind besides the random sidewalk . puke-stain. So, without further adieu, here's this week's list. Top Ten Rejected Senior Gift Ideas 10. Tuberculosis Vaccine for All Students. 9. Bag ofHalf-EatenChe~tos. 8. Bronzed Statue of Janice the Security Guard. 7. More Handicapped Parking Spaces. 6. Faster College Center Elevator. 5. Toupee for President Hull. 4. Giant Laxative-Filled Pinata. 3. One Usefur Book for Shaffer Library 2. Soiled Condom 1. S.h*t in a Hat Students of tile Week Well, the first winner is someone who I'm sure all the ladies either know or want to know. You know him as the cutest kid on campus. He is none other than Union's own Keit/1 Crumb. What did he do t~win this award? Wel-l, those.ofyou who listened to WRUC's Love Lines this past Tuesday night (11 PM-I AM) know why. For those of you who don't know why,. let me put it to you this way: Keith is now much more aerodynamic. Atta boy, Keith! The second winner of this week's award is one of Keith's close friends. The man I speak ofis one Ian McConnel. He could have ·received this honor for the very same reason as Keith, but Ian deserves recognition for something else .. You might have noticed Ian hobbling about on crutches. He protmbly told you that he hurt himself saving stranded puppies from a burning building, and this might very well be true, but he also might have hurt himself while naked and drunk. I'll leave it to my faithfulreaders to decide. The tinal winners are the campus vigilsAdamaRd Jared Riclunall. Most of you probably know how much effort Union's Talented Twin Tandem put into researching the VLA dub and its beginnings. The result of their collective effort was to uncover that VLA had done absolutely nothing illegal. Congratulations to the twins for their effort. I know I feel more secure !mowing that there are people on campus relentlessly checking into completely legitimate clubs. I can't wait to see which club they check on next! Comments? Hate Mall?

I am a junior who feels that there is simply not enough unity qn campus. While our campushasa great variety of multicultural groups, there is no unity between the groups. Mote often than hot, people spend their free time in homogenous groups. Although this may be the most natural and comfortable thing to do, it is eon1- p letely contrary to what the word \Union\ stands for. The position of VP for Multicultural Affairs is still a young position and in the recent years has encountered difficulty .in coordinating student unity on ·campus. The college experience encompasses more than just aca- demics and partying. It is about exploring different cultures and broadening our horizons. At what point in our lives, outside of col- lege, do we have the opportunity to interact with such an eclectic group of individuals? Lefs not squander this rare and valuable opportunity.

My name is Sloane Silver and I want to be next years Vice President of Campus Life. My beliefhas always been that in or- der to get things done, you must do them yourself. Taking the ini- tiative and accomplishing the goals,set before me is something I continually strive to achieve. It is the job of the entire student body to make Union the best place that it can possibly be. Rather than sitting around and complaining lets change things. My highest goal is to have Union reach its fullest potential. I am involved in a multitude of activities on campus. For ex- ample, as Booking Chair of the Chet's Committee,! plan weekly campus wide activities. This has given me the opportunity to en- hance the life at Union beyond the classroom. My most recent accomplishment through Chet's, for the position of Vice President of Campus Life, I would like to first introduce myself. My name is Peter Simon, I'm a junior here atUnionCollege? and a European History major. Freshman year I became a member oftheConcert Committee and a DJ at WRUC. Now, in my junior year, l have been able. to take my invC!vement a step further.

As a member of Safe Space, I have the opportunity to educate the campus on serious coiJe.ge is- sues. It is important to me that students feel safe, and know the facts about rape. This is just an- other way to make Unionlifebet- ter. It is also important f()r me to portray Union to prosP._ective stu- dents in the highest regard, This way future students can geta taste for life here and in turh~ we·cah get the best possible student body.

To me it W!ls obyious that the author was disappointed that the Orientation Committee, and the chairperson in particular (whom the author herself proclaimed as her friend), did not make a spe- cial exception for her. The Ori- entation Comm.ittee, who for so many years has made selections based on a.sub_jective networking offriends, has finally decided to take astand an<! make exceptions for no one. Had tt!e author truly lacked the energy to complete the application 011 time, submitting her so-ca11ed \article\ by the deadline would seem an unlikely po~sibility .. The author took the liberty of comparing the Orientation Chair- person with Fidel Castro, Chair- man Mao, Napoleon, and God. However, was it not the Nazis in World War II Gennany that used propaganda based on irrational and emotional responses to slan- der the innocent in the same man- ner as the author has done? Am I truly justified in my outrageous comparison of the author and the Nazis? I suppose my exaggera- tionsare as outlandish as her own.

Students eceived both a voice-mail message and a written flyer on ·riday explaining that a student had active tuberculosis and hat those in contact with him or her would be contacted hortly by the Health Services office at Union and by the Schenectady County Health Department to be tested for the · isease for free. The entire Union population seems to have . een kept in the dark. Calls by those inquiring which dorm the infected person · lives in were ignored by Health Services, which gave the ·. nswer that \that [infonnation] is confidential.\ However, ne must realize and understand that at a school where all · 000-plus students live, eat, and participate in classes on a aily basis with each other that a student with a disease such as tuberculosis is a llealth threat to all of the campus popula- . ion. The college, regardless of whether the student has had ontact with only five people on a regular basis, has anobli- · ation to inform tlle student body of where the disease is · located, so that persons who reside on his or her floor and · · ho sit in his or her classes may take the necessary precau- . ions to prev~nt contracting the disease. . One emploYee of health services,. who answered a call on unday, explained the fact that if \somebody has HIV, we · ave to keep it confidential. The same goes for tubercula- is.\ Unfortunately, tuberculosis is not even close to being ·n the same league as HIV. It is airborne, and therefore has e ability to affect tnany more people. Healtfl Services does ot and should not provide the name of the infected student, ut it should at least provide information about where he or he lives. Obviously, Union does not want to receive bad press as . . erspective students are taking tours of the school and nar- owing down their choices. That is c1early understandable; owever, when something is a potential health threat to a arge number of students, the student body has a right to . ow immediately, not in a week, where it is centralized, so. hat they can take the necessary precautions to prevent con-, racting the disease. By keeping the student body in the dark and not informing them of the potential serious threat to their ealtl1, the college is shirking its responsiblity to those who. atter most. By doing so, Union is committing a serious \njustice as well as a massive breach of trust, of those who ake this lace what it is.

I arrived at the fraternity around 12:30 AM, as I had a bit of work I had to finish before going out for the night. _I went 1() a fi:at~mity~~n~':\n fo.r its \Late Night.\ ·However, Friday night, it was anything but \late.\ At 2 AM, the fraternity shut down its party. This disturbing occurrence is not an is9lated event. Recently, according to Dean Schurick, security requested a meeting with _ her and Dean Alford. Security told the deans that they believe most fights around the campus start after 2 AM. By enforcing the infrequently-enforced \2 AM Rule\ (which says that fraternity parties must end by 2 AM, or else . the fraternity faces probation), fights would have less of a chance to occur on campus. This is a simple solution, right? Wrong! The \2 AM Rule\ is a dangerous thing for several reasons. When the fraternity party I attended last weekend ended, I exited to find drunken students getting into their vehicles. These students were not heading for home, unfortunately. By closing the doors at 2 AM, the administration and security have opened the doors to students to go to bars in Schenectady and Albany. When people go to fraternity parties, they are not there just to visit. They are there to have a good time until they choose to go home. If the fraternities are not there, or if studenJs' partying is cut short, . then the students will find alternative ways to have fun. These already-drunken people can possibly cause damage to themselves and to others by getting into accidents or getting into brawls. It is not that I do not trust my friends at this school, but I realize that when I drink on occasion, I donothave all the common sense God gave me. For some people, this means not letting their \buzz\ dissipate at any cost. Administration and security, you are putting the lives of students in danger. Fights will happen, regardless of the location, if a person is set off for some reason If the fight happens on campus, security is there to break it up and file an on-campus report. The pub! ic relations problems do not normally exit the gates of Union. If the tight happens off campus (or if Union students perpetually get stopped tor DWI), the school's public relations will sink to unrecoverable levels. This \simple solution\ is putting too mu<;h at stake. I appreciate what security does on campus, and I do not think that fight mediating is the only part of their job description. However, if Union takes aPR bath, security will find it tough to swallow less wages when less students attend this school. Neither security nor I can take all of my friends' car keys away from them. Fraternities should be allowed to stay open and to serve alcohol, at least until Schenectady bars have to close (around 4 AM). After that, most people will be ready to turn in for the night. I urge the I FC and administration to meet and to come to a com promise. I realize that the IFC is attempting to take care of the \One Guest Per Fraternity Member\ Rule currently, but that rule does not put lives in as much jeopardy as does the \2 AM Rule.\ Fights will happen, students will party, and people will get drunk. These are things the administration thinks they are preventing by enforcing such rules. However, they must tailor their decisions toward the inevitable instead oftrying to put together the\ easy solution.\ The easy way out could kill someone.

Thaf's the major highlightofGrosse Pointe Blank,. an unusual piece of screenwriting that carries a few pistols but can't help missing .key shots as it veers from being part- Pulp Fiction to being an original action-comedy. The concept is fresh and unique for a mainstream feature. Cusack-a professional killer- gets an invitation to attend his tenth-year high school reunion back home: He is concerned about how to face his past, especially considering his career. \Whatdo I tell people? Hi, I killed the presi- dent of Paraguay with a fork? What do you do for a living'?\ His secretary (played by real-life sis- ter, Joan) pushes him to return home, and at her insistence; he does. Not first,. of course, with~ out consulting psychiatrist Arkin (who is truly wasted as the thera- pist who is not interested in Cusack's psyche). Once home, Cusack finds Driver, who he stood upon prom night a decade earlier and who is now a local disc jockey. Shehumiliateshim on the air (as payback for the hurt she's endured for a decade), but soon, the couple are dating once more and going together to ·the re- union. While home, Cusack has an assignment (his last, he pro- ·claims, because he's developed a conscience) and must contend with thwarting his \nemesis Aykroyd, who plays the competi- tion-a rivalhitman. Something has happened to Aykroyd, though. Lately, any movie he appears in tends to waste his comedic talents. (Wit- ness Celtic Pride.)

Professors Curran and Graille have collaborated on several projects. This eJCbibition which stems from Graille' s research,. re- flects their common interest in eighteenth century views of other cultures. Profes~or Curran is happy with the reception that the exhibit has generated, and he hopes that that the exhibit clari- fies where stereotypes about A f- ricaevol·ved. He had also hoped to bri.ng an exhibit that encom- passed aH the disciplines of a lib- eral arts college. ''It is only relatively· recently that the academic disciplines have been totaliy separated , and that from an eighteenth century per- spective we would be looking at this collection of illustrations from the widest of vantage points~ where the observer would be si- multaneously historian, 'ethnolo- gist,' and ~hilosopher\ added Curran. GrailleandCurran'sobjectives in this exhibit were two fold; they wanted to diffuse the misconcep- tions of slavery and the cruel treat~ rnents ofAfricans. -Curran also wanted to create an exhibit that· encompassed the ideals of a I ib- eral arts college. An exhibit that could be spoken of from an an- thropological perspective or the perspective of a historian just as well as an literary scholar. Re- cently colleges have separated the disciplines in a college contrary to many European Universities of · the eighteenth century when aU the sciences, hard and social were together, related and studied as a whole. Union is one of the few institu- tions that owns several of these seventeenth and eighteenth cen- . tury works. This exhibit is an ex- ample of the many possil:lilities that are available for exhibits within the Union College's collec- tion of rare books and art. when he does appear, his menac..: ing demeanor comes across as a psychotic adolescent more than a wacky hitman. Cusack, though, steals the show. He dresses like an FBI agent but acts like a sales- man, not a hitnian-. all the mo.re hilarious, since his stature does not give him away. Some scenes are cleverly staged, such as a fistfight between Cusack and a goon in a school hall and the dumping of a corpse in the school's boiler. But for scenes likethesewhichechosimi- lar dark comedies, there is a no- ticeable lack of genuine comedy. Some lines are smart (Cusack's secretary noting that the major difference seen in people at re- unions is swelling) while the ro- mance between Driver and Cusack is not very romantic. The movie's pacin~ evokes more chuckles than hoV~Is oflaughter. Still, the irony of some staged scent!~ restdts in some creativity.

Unfortunate·Jy, only four of last year's 15 start- ers were left on the field at the start of the first game ofthis year's tournament.. The Dutchmen took the pitch against Le Mayne in the first round, and once again their lack ofexperienceshowed early. Af- ter three minutes of even-played rugby, a couple of penalties and a momentary lapse of concentra- tion allowed the Le Moyne team to punch in a try.

We have a lot of inexperienced rookies, and hopefully we will have a more successful season next year.\ Coach Milner was very excited about the progress of rookies Clark and George Edwards and first-year players Tom Burke, Levine, Brett Lussier, and Ryan Martinson.

In spite of a strong wind and cur- rent, that's exactly what they did. Em barking on the three-and-a- half hour drive to rthaca at 6:00 AM, all squads stepped on that bus knowing the challenge that lay ahead-to take down one of the strongest teams in the state. They had been practicing, they had been training, and they knew that they were prepared. The novice men were the first cultivated a11 season to defend to rna e t 1st e1r est race to ate their perfect record. Coxswain Tim Losee steered his boat across the finish line first, leaving Ithaca in its wake and holding on to its undefeated status. Congratula- tions to Steve Eichfeld, Dave Brooks, Tim Lash, Jon Moeller, Adam Murphy, Andy Martinson,. Jay Pyo, and Corey Greenhouse for a job well done. They stated, \We owe all our technical .success to the Master of Rowing Mr. David Polizzi and would like to thank our coaches Tom White and Kim Littel for their outstanding coaching this season.\ They then cheered on the nov- came through in the aggressive- ness they took to the starting line.

Theyhad no such luck. Although they I ost to both Vassar and Oneonta this past week, the Dutchmen do not consider the losses a complete disaster. Jun- ior captain Jordan Pinsker went undefeated tor the week, show- ing his teammates what it means to be a top~seeded player and· a team leader. On Tuesday, April 22, the team traveled to Oneonta. Upon ·arrival, tlle Dutchmen were taken by surprise, physically, when they discovered that they were tq play on indoor courts.

Freshman Jared Sheikh and Pinsker were the only ones to ~~lk away vic- torious. Pinsk~r stated after the match, <'We sho1:.1ld have beaten [Oneonta]. I was a little disap- pointeq we lost ... but it was a close match.\ It came down to the fact that Oneonta had more depth than Union. They dropped the first two matches to Union, but we were able to look toward their lower-seeded players for strength. Three days later, Vassar ar- rived on Union territory and de- feated the Dutchmen by a score of 6-1 . Looking at the numbers, is undefeated, but we put up a good fight, and we were all re- ally satisfied with our perfor- mance.\ At Ithaca this past weekend, the varsity team was able to gain valuable racing experience, which they will take with them to the New York State Champi- onships this weekend.

Kenley Smith, who sat bow in the women' sopen-weight four com- mented on the concentrated ef- fort that they put fot1h and felt one would conclude that the team was slaughtered. However, this was not the case. The men's ten- nis team kept each match very close. Sam Berger and Sudheer Potluri, the third and fourth seeds, respectively, played very strong matches, Sheikh was handed a tough loss from Vas,sar's number- one seed. Once again, Pinsker came out on top. Being down one set, Jordan \The Doctor\ Pinsker reached into his medicine bag and pulled out a second and third set victory against Vassar's number- two seed 1-6, 7-5, 6-2. Remark- able, simply remarkable. Next up, the Union College Men's Tennis Team takes on UCAA Tournament Champion Hamilton College on April 30. Soon after, they will face top- ranked Skidmore College and ·Williams College. Coach Scanlon, when asked how he believed Union would fare against the three toughest teams on the schedule, said, \We are showing signs of continuous improvement .... We need to play them one game at a time, one point at a time, and we 'II see how we do.\ Pinsker agreed, CCWe'll do very well against Clarkson and Hartwick, but it'll be close with Williams, Skidmore, and Hamilton.\ It should be noted that the ten- nis courts behind Lamont House have been completed, allowing the team to conduct more productive practices throughout the week. The men's tennis team will end their season at home versus Hartwick on May lO. Come out to support the Dutchmen. that \even though we didn't win the race, it was a good race for our boat. Mentally we were very con- fident and focused. Our power was centralized, and we went after the race.\ In the end, however, with Union's technical complications and the home-court advantage, Ithaca held on to their lead and fin- ished ahead overall. Nevertheless, the State Competition in Rome, NY is approaching in several days and brings with it the opportunity to settle the score. Junior Katie Ott, captain of the varsity women, is confident that the boats \ ... are really coming together, and we're looking forward to States.\

Sports Softball Captain AmyNyren: A Real Team Player by Hannah Blum Contributing Writer As captain of the softball team at Union College, Amy Nyren is no stranger to responsibility and leadership. Coming into Union as a freshman, Nyren knew very little about what it would take to lead a team. Now as a senior co- captain of the Dutchwomen, and former president of Gamma Phi Beta sorority, the Sutton, Massa- chusetts native has learned the virtues of patience and determi- nation. Playing softball at Worcester Academy in Massachusetts taught Nyren a lot. However, it was not until she started playing sports at the college level that she realized the importance of athletics. Many of Nyren's personal develop- ments have been because of her involvement with the softball team. \Amy now takes herself more seriously in terms of getting her- selfphysically and mentally pre- pared for a game,\ said Union second..,year head coach Brian Speck. Speck expects his captains to have strong leadership skills and a positive attitude geared toward the benefit of the team. Nyren has acquired both. Her relentless de- sire to improve Union's Division III softball program does not go unnoticed. A four-year letterwinner and two-year starter, Nyren has been among the team's leading hit~ ters the last two seasons. Last year she hit .370 with nine extra base hits, 19 RBI. and 19 runs scoFed while anchoring third base for 31 games, So far this year Nyren is batting 284 with 14 RBI (second on the team), 10 runs scored and four ex- tra base hits. In 22 games, Nyren has started at either third or first, depend.ing on where the team needs her. high school career as she also played volleyball, tennis,. and was a member ofthe ski team. Non- athletic extracurricular high But being a starter and one ofthe team's top hit- llt40~Ni:t:>·'i'''(':<'J·!s;;.·\'····•··: ters is only a fraction of what she has actually ac- complished. Nyrenstarted playing softball in third grade on a little league team. During fifth grade, she moved to a more com- petitive team and earned ~j:;tj::Jii.:;._,__,_ __ ~____::.;~~-~-\\\ a position on her high school var- school act,ivities !ncl~ded' cia~~ sity team as a freshman. Like vice presid-ent, ·wind ensemble many other students, athletics member, and commuhitysetv'ice . . . played a large part in Nyren 's tutor. Upon entering Union in the fall of 1993, Nyren continued to get involved as she pledged at Gamma Phi Beta and joined the softball team. Both activities, among oth- ers, have helped· · Nyron grow as a per- .. son. N yren 's greatest collegiate benefit, overall, has been her maturity. \I''ve learned a lot, especially in the last two years,\ she says .. \I had to learn to grow up and discover who I was in college. l used ·to get mad at myself and not be able to pick m-yself up. Now, its like you make a mis- take but you have to move on.\ Speck feels that this . year in particular has taughtNyren about be- ing. a team player and holding a responsibil- ity 'for the team. \The changes that she has made, her growth, have come from ~ithin,\ lie says. \She takes herself more seriously and she has learned the importance of putting priorities in her life.\ Nyren has grown as a player and as an individual, both on and o-ff the field. She has used soft- ball as a catalyst in achieving her goals and the goals of her fellow players. She has learned that a loss does not represent failure but is instead a learning experience. She has also learned thatthe game is not over until it is over. \We have those games where we are dowh seven to nothing in the first inning and we have to come back. We have done that several times this year. Some of the games we've won and others we haven't but in all cases some- one had to be there to maintain the positive attitude.\ The captain represents much that is crucial to the team at Union College. She not only represents the players and the desires ofthe coach, but she represents the school as well. Being a leader and liaison has taught Nyren patience and given her the ability to listen to what others have to say. A biology and psychology ma- jor, Nyren will be attending chiropractic school next year. For now, though, she is looking for- ward to her remaining career as a starter and feader of Union College's Dutchwomen softball team. So,ftball Continues on. BasebaH.Shiil·es, L.ooks· Toward Playoffs Thrf!e. Wins'Shy of·Bre(lkifl:g., Te~lf!-· Win Record Their Losing Streak by Carrie Heroth Staff Writer This past week was not a suc- cessful one for the women's soft- ball team. Facing RPI, SUNY New Paltz, and Skidmore, the team lost all six games extending their losing streak to nine. The Dutchwomen enter their last week of play hoping to add some wms to their record. Union first squared off against local arch rival RPI at Rensselear's home site. RPI took a 4-0 lead until Union came the plate in the fifth inning. Shan- non Lawlor, Cassie Lawton, and Carrie .Heroth had RBI singles and Beth Gabriel added a RBI fielder's choice to ignite a four run inning. RPI sealed the win, however, in the bottom of the fifth with two stolen bases and a sacri- fice tly. The Engineers went on to win 5-4 The second game belonged to RPI as well as they produced a six run third inning. RPI sent II players to the plate and tallied six runs off five hits and three errors. Union's offense was led by Lawton with two hits, Gabriel with a two run double, and Taryn Sarno! with a RBI double. RPI defeated Union for a second time with a score of I 0- 3. Union returned home on Thurs- day to face SUNY New Paltz. Once again, the results were not what Union had hoped for. New Paltz took control of the first game with a four run first and a four run fifth inning. The Dutchwomen could not produce the runs that they needed to bounceback Samol and Gabriel each added a RBI in the third bringing the fi- nal score to 10~2. The second ~ game saw even worse results for Union. New Paltz broke the game open with four runs in the second. That is all the insurance that they would need. The Union Dutchwo1nen were not able to put any runs on the board and were defeated 7-0. On Saturday Union traveled to Skidmore. It looked as if Union would be in control ofthis match- up as the women took a two-run first inning lead. Samol had a RBI singl·e to propel the attack. Union could. not hold on to their lead, however. as Skidmore brought across four runs. DanieHe LaCrosse pitched a good ga1ne for the Dutchwomen, allowing only two earned runs off of eight hits. Skidmore's pitcher held Union to only three hits. The second game turned out the same way. Amy Nyren knocked in a RBI single in the fourth and Stephanie Sienkiewicz followed with an RBI in the sixth to lead Union's attack. Union out hit Skidmore &-4, but they could not make the plays that would seal the win. Skidmore went on to win 4- 2. Melanie Barbato pitched an- other good game for Union only allowing four hits to Skidmore's offense. With these losses.; Union's record extends to 7-20-1. Head coach Brian Speck is looking for Union to finish their schedule with some victories. \We've been in every game and we are competing hard. With a few breaks we hope to end the season on a positive note.\ The Dutchwomen will play their season closer today on Alexander Field against Albany. Game time is 3:00. · by DanielS. Queen ·;.'Sports Editor ,Un,ion's baseball tem11 com- pleted a very successful week by winning three out of their last four games. They are playing their best ball of the season with the second season right around the corner. Usually at thi-s time of year, they are ·playing out the schedule, but this is not the case quarters of the way through the season are Todd ElLis, who is leading the team in hitting at a .455 clip. Not too far {?ehind is Eric Kujawski, who is also kifl.- il'lg the ball, hitting .443 .. Third in the team in hitting is Jeremy Lamb at a.420 pace. Obviously, Union'S: offensive prowess speaks for itself. Ryan Smith leads theteam in homeruns with seven. One interesting sta- Almstead leads the team with 4 victories whieh·Jeads the team. This Tliursday,'Union plays at home ~gainst Skidmore in a rare night doubleheader. On Friday, they face-offasainst Vassar in yet another twin-bill, and on Sunday, they challenge Williams in an- other two games. Junior Jeremy Lamb said, 'The team's goal is to make the ECAC or NCAA playoffs. Everyone is starting to this season. The team is in serious ECAC playoff contention, and if they finish up strong in their last .six games, a playoff spot might be in store. The Dutchrnen are also trying to break the all- time record for school wins of 16 in a season. Right now, they are 14-13 with six games to play. It is the first time they have been over .500 since facing Albany on April 15. Union played a doubleheader against Hartwick on April26 at~d split the two games.

Josh Soldo pitched a master- ful game and brought his record to 3-4. The next day, the team took the field at Utica in another twin-bill, and they came away with two vic- tories. In the first game, Ryan Almstead pitched and got his fourth win of the season against two losses. The second game saw Craig Kazmierczak even his record at 3--3,and they eeked out a 6-5 de- cision. Some standoutS' three tistic in regards to the team and its opposition is that they are outscoring their opponents 214- 182. Their pitching staff has also come a~ound lately especially Josh Soldo who is returning to his dominant form of last season. Craig Kazmierczak has the team's lowest ERA, a scant 3.80, The only unproven aspect of their pitching rotation is who is going to fill the closer's role. Only two pitchers have saves on the team. Rich Nespola and Soldo each have one save a piece. Ryan home games for the rest of the season in hopes of securing a playoff spot.

This was the first competition f-or the 'team since Williams two weeks ago. The UCAA champi- onships that were to be hosted by Union last weekend were can-- celed due to weather related con- cerns.

Overly talented, and often un- der-appreciated senior co~captain Dave Riggi, had another standout day. Riggi anchored the winning 400m relay and finished second in the lOOm to RPI's Krishaun Gilmore once again. Riggi came down with a severe case of shin-splints and decided to \scratch\ in the 200m in order to save himself for the state champs next weekend where he is the defending state champion in the 200m.

Flynn later decided not to run on the 4x800 team due to se~ere blisters on both feet. Like Riggi, Flynn will be called upon to compete in several races next weekend at states at RIT, and made the pru- dent decision not to risk further injury by racing. Flynn will most likely be running the 800m, 4x4()0, and 4x800, while Riggi will be called upon in. the I OOm, 200tri; 4xl00, and 4x400.

• • Final Exam Schedule PagelS New-Look Student Forum Election.s Draw Close Races Student Forum Elections were held on Friday, May 2 in the ~earner Campus Centt')r froJ1! 10 AM until 4 PM. This year there was a new vo.ting process that allowed students to select as many representatives as they deemed viable for each position. The new ''Ap- proval Voting\ system was perfonned ·inside voting machines, another first for Student F arum elections. The system was installed in order to legitimize the winner's victories, as most ·approval winners will re- ceive majority approval. The new system and voting booths, however, led to lower voter turnout this year. There were 726 voters compared to the nearly l ,000 voters in last year's elections. Voters tendedJo take longer in the voting machines then they would take filling out a paper ballot. Thete were also only two booths in which students could cast their votes, thus slowing down the process and causing longJines. Due to time concerns and class schedules, students were dissuaded from voting. Some students were unhappy with the new system. SoP.homore Matt Peluso stated, .. Basically, I totally disagreed with the idea of voting for more than one person for the same position.\ ' Those who took part in the voting process this year had many difficult decisions to make. Tl'!e two high~ est-profile races, President of the Student F~rum and Junior Trustee, each offered f1ve candidates among which to choose. The nominees participated in a de.: bate held at Chet' son Thursday night in the hopes that the student body woul·d attend and be persuaded to vote for them. Most races, with the exception of the Junior Trustee race, were close in number in the tina! tallies. In the Junior Trustee race, sophomore Jonathan Zandman captured over 500 approval votes out of the 726 vot- ers. \I liked the approval voting system, because I think it gave people a chance to vote for who they re- ally thought was.qual'ifled. However; I think there need to be minorrefinements, because in some races a clear majority was not received. I also think we had a very . ualifiedgroup of nominees, and I look forward to a ' . solid forum for the coming'year,\ Zandman said. The other candidates -in the nice did not fare as well, with Zandman,s closest competitor receiving nearly 25 per- cent approval. The race of the presidential candidates was much closer. The victor was junior Christopher Brantigan, who garnered nearly 40 percent approval. Brantigan' s closest rival was fellow junior Frank Rossi. Moreover, all five candidates performed wen under the approval voting. \[ think people need to be more infol1l1ed about ap- . proval voting. Unfortunately, there was poor turnout for the election. To my knowledge the small percent- age who voted only chose one candidate for each race anyway. Although there were signs explaining it, people were in too much of a hurty tobother,\ Brantigan said. One of the biggest surprises of the .day was in the race for Vice President of Academics. Freshman Andy Markowski defeated junior David K.anfer and sopho- more Josh Chaplin to become the VP-elect. \There was some excellent competition. I don 1 t think many people gave me a chance being the only freshman in the elec- tion. I was confident that my supporters would make things happen for me, which they did, ' 1 Markowski said. In other election results, junior Suzanne _Dougherty defeated Junior Class Vi.ce President Stacy Drossman, in.another close race for Vice President of Administra- tion. Even with a last-minute write-in campaign staged by junior Tom Marino, sophomore Frank DeLorenzo de- feated sophomore Graham Lucas to become Vice Presi- dent ofF inance.

This year there was a new voting process that allowed students to select as many representatives as they deemed viable for each position. The new \Ap- proval Voting\ system was performed inside voting machines, another first for Student Forum elections. The system was installed in order to legitimize the winner's victories, as most approval winners will re- ceive majority approval. The new system and voting booths, however, led to lower voter turnout this year. There were 726 voters compared to the nearly I ,000 voters in last year's elections. Voters tended to take longer in the voting machines then they would take filling out a paper ballot. There were also only two booths in which students could cast their votes, thus slowing down the process and causing long lines. Due to time concerns and class schedules, students were dissuaded from voting. solid forum for the coming year,\ Zandmansaid.

The canoe races were held at Mendon Ponds Park in the city of Rochester on a cold and rainy Saturday. The Union College team fought against the elements and managed to win second place in the men's and coed sprints and placed third in the women's dis- tance race. Professor Jewell and Professor Ghaly took first place for Union College in the faculty races. Later in the day, canoes werejudged by ASCEand Mas- ter Builders representatives at the RIT campus. Union College took second place in this event with a computer-generated presentation produced by Ray Lai '97.

Harvard Professor Speaks at the Nott ~ by Anj~li Balasingham Staff Writer On Tuesday, May 6, Phi Eeta Kappa presented \The Signifi- cance and Legacy of the Archi- tecture ofFrank Lloyd Wright,\ a talk by Harvard professor and architectural historian Neil Levine. Wright, whose I ong career spanned almost seven decades,continues to hold a sin- gular place in the architectural world. According to Levine, Wright built more buildings than any other modern avant-garde architect. He is perhaps the most posthumously relevant architect, Levine pointed out, as his name is still well-known even in pDpu- Iarsociety. Wright ls the subject of an upcoming opera, a Ken Burns' documentary, and he is thus a cultural icon. ness.\ This theme of continuity pro- vided the theoretical foundati()n for much of Wright's work, \Wright's idea,\ said Levine, \was that everything had to be integrated.\ This philosophy was exerriplified by Wright's model for the ideal urban America, in which each community would consist offour acres ofland. Each fantily would be given a mini- mum of one acre, on which they wou.ld perfonn all activities nec- essary for subsistence, including fanning and working. The goal.., Levine said, was to create a liv- ing arrangement in which \every aspect oflife would be integrated: city and country, home ancl work ... \ create one major space,a11d con- centrate \all their effort into the one major reason for tile l)Ui!d- ing being there.\ One of his most famous works, New York's Guggenheim Museum, features a single large space for social gath- ering. The design of the Johnson- Wax corporate building. simi- lar! y, creates a social atmosphere out of a professional structure by bringing \the entire clerical staff into a family environment.\ ~------------------------------------------_, The key to the originality of Another major aspeot of Wright's architectural philosophy was his interest in the relationsh i(J between building and landscape. He was one of the first, for e~­ ample, to design homes that were: structured specifically to trap maximum amounts of solar en- ergy. Another one of his famou~ works was a house built on top of a stream, such that even though its waterfall could not be seen from inside the home, the sound of the water falling could b~ heard. This created the \sense that the house was one incident ofthe stream, and in fact part of the rhythm of the stream.\ . All these components, Levine said, make Wright'sdesigll5more than simply functional. [n trying to give meaning to his work, Wright elevated architecture to \a level of poetic development.\ He saw architecture as an abstract art, representing a universal la11guage which, by virtue of its ~'lack of cultural specificity\ could suc- cessfu11y bring all its elements together to create a sense ()f con- tinuity and completeness.

Levine said, rests in the way in which he \deconstructed and pulled apart the elements of the house in or- derto create a living organism ... \ In undertaking this deconstruction, Wright createdan open plan house, whose interior interacted with the exterior to cre- ate a sense of continuity. In keep~ ing with this idea, he designed homes with heating and lighting circuitry incorporated into the structure of the building itself. such that the house \gave an im- pression of a kind of unbounded- Perhaps the most important fea- ture of Wright's buildings. Levine emphasized. is the fact that they Levine described the attitudes towards Wright and his designs as being a Jove-hate relationship. The Guggenheim establislled his reputation for being an \'a(m()st egomaniacal architect who would do almost anything for his own purposes.\ Wright has also been perceived as an inconsiste11t art- ist, because of his need for \re- gionally appropriate architecture\ as opposed to fonnulated design.

He claims that the government has been doing business similarly to that of 3'0- 40 years ago. ·Due to the GE fall out, the re- gion suffered and therefore af- fected the local economy. How- ever, there was agreement for the idea that the cities in the region mustcoalesce to look atthe larger picture for the benefit of e~ery­ one. Kevin O'Connor, president f~r the Center for Economic Growth in Albany, suggested that the fu- ture of the economy is based on the efforts of the local colleges · and universities. Specific indus- tries and various companies have grown in past years and begin at the university level. The objective for the region's future is to give peoplethe same opportunities as a metropolitan area without high monetary dis- advantages. Middle School Can't Get Hon.,rs Teachers at Schalmont Middle Scho0l will not serve on a cmn- mittee to select National Junior Honor Society students because their old contracts expired June of 1994. The teachers are·not getting their usual double in raises and are therefore refusing to serve as a rebuttal tact. Because the selection committee is not a re- quired part of their jobs~ they do not feel the need to .comply with the school's requests. Field trips were also an event that teachers refused to participate in due to the volunteer label placed on them. Students say that they feel rejected and the teach- ers are against them, The Gazette reported. Some teachers were even considering boycotting graduation. The students are at a disadvan- tage fro1n this lack of teacher sup- port because the teachers want higher salaries and more payment for. their extra eff<Jrts. Hazardous Waste In Schenectady, on Stanley Street, a dangerous pile of trash was found filled with new and used hypodermic needles and medication. The woman who supp()s~dly lived in the house had been sick and died weeks earlier. Apparently, the property owner had been responsible for placing the debris on the curb. The main issue was that the trash was put out too early. According to The Gazette, for this reason, the now three year- old policy was made to fine people $50 if garbage is out for pickup too early. Regularly, uash cannot be put on the curb until 2 PM the day before collection. Other homeowners in the area had also been violating the trash collection schedule. Since the new policy was installed, ap- proximately 200 people have been billed. -- compiled by Stephanie Slobotkin- News Editor Cheryl Duncan Visits Union College by Aileen Quigley News Editor '\The color ofblacks is caused by a rare, congenital disease calle-d Negritude, which derived from leprosy,\ and \the only evi- d-ence of a cure\ was when the skin color turned white. This statement was not made by some Hitler-esque Neo-Nazi but r~ther the ~father' ofAm.erican Psychia- try Dr. Benjamin -Rush, whose face still can be found on the seal of the American Psychiatric As- sociation. He also believed that interracial marriage would spread this disease among the whitepopufation, so he called for sexual segregation ofthe races. On Apri130, Cheryl Duncan pre- sellted these and other facts as evidence of\calculated psychi- atric attacks on blacks and mi- nority racial and religious groups.\ · Mrs. Duncan. is a board mem- ber. of the Metropolitan area chapter of the Citizens Comtnis- siol1 on Human Rights, an inter- national organization that exam- ines cases of patient abuse, insur- ance fraud, and institution injus- tices. In addition, CCMR also runs a hctline tD assist patients that have been raped or sexually abused at the hands of their therapists and has testified in court on their be- half. Through such intervention, the CCHR hopes to combat the \psychiatric war on culture'l they bel i~ve is being perpetrated \in the guise ofhelp.\ The roots of modern psychia- try, according to Duncan, are foanded in the \science of eugen- ics.\ The term eugenics was cre- ated by Francis Galton, meaning \good stock.\ He chiimed that \judicious matil1g could give more suitable races or strains of blood a better chance of prevail- ing over the less suitable.\ This idea was furthered by psychologist Herbert Spencer, who coined the tenn \smvival of the fittest long before Darwin. Spencer believed that selective breeding would purify the race, weeding out the unfit. To carry this plan out, psychia- trist Eugen Fischer ofthe Kaiser Wilhelm Institute of Anthropol- .ogy, Hun:Ian Heredity, arid Eu- genic~ i~ Berlin \urged the an- nihilation ofNegro children.\ He theorized that \blacks were devoid of value and useless for emp l~y­ m e n t other than f o r man ua 1 crafts.'' In compli- ance with t h e s e i d e a· s , leaders in the field, of psy- chology felt that \psychia- try should takeama- jor tole in purifying the race.'' In the United States, steriliza- tion laws were put into effect as early as 1905, and over 15,000 were performed by 1931. The common theme behind the segregation and sterilization was thatiQ's large role in determin- ing behavior and status. Psy- chologist Lewis Terman, an \ex- pert\ in IQ testing, deemed that \83% of Jews were feeble- minded, that children ofthe poor could never be educated, and that Mexicans, Indians, and blacks should never be allowed to repro- duce.\ In a study entitled \Intel- ligence and Race- ·a Review of the Results ofthe Army Intelli- gence Tests - The Negro in 1918,\ Dr. Paul Popenoe judged that \the IQ of blacks was deter- mined by the amount of white blood they had; tile lighter their skin, the higher their IQ.\ Such ideas have· resurfaced as recently as 1958 in the book Psy- chology am~ Liie, which stated . thatiQ scores were indicative of \the presence ofnative [genetic] differences between Negroes and whites.\ In 1994, Murray. and Herrstein 's book The Bell Curve, reinforced this position, cJaiming that AfricanyAmericans perfOI'm worse on intelligence tests than their white peers because they're \genetically disabled.\ Furthermore, t11ey argue that certain subgroups in society in- cluding the poor, criminals, school dropouts, and unwed mothers were \low in cognitive like hallucinations, tardive abilities.\ dyskinesia (uncontrollable shak- These notions formed the ba- ing of the extremities), and sis of psychiatric ex peri menta- sexual dysfunction. tion, whose residual effects, ac- The impact of this testing on cording to Duncan, are visible to not only on the individual, but this day.

If you guessed that this is. the record of a Union baseball pitcher, you are incorrect in this case. This statistic represents the number ofwomenand 1ninorities~ re- spectively, that ran for office in the recent StLLdent Forum EJec- tions. After the Fashion Show, we saw in this secti·on of The Concordiensis complaints about ignorance and discrimination. Women and minority groups on campus are quick topo.int out that· the campus does .not have compassion toward their causes. Over- all, they are correct. Union is not the most compassionate campus known to man. The first question at last week's President of Student Forum de-. bate concerned the candidates' views ofwomen and their relathte absence from the ballot. Another question concerned whether or not the candidates had any knowledge of multicultural groups on Union's campus. These questions were both necessary, but they raise other concerns. , . When only three out oftwenty candidates (orfHleenpercent}are. women and even less are minorities, the ability for those groups to get their ideas and issues heard cannot increase. It simply gives the Student Forum another excuse to say that those groups are lazy or apathetic complainers. This is a wrong and correctable situation. In the Student Forum debates, Leena Mankad's name was brought up several times. As Vice President of Multicultural Affairs, Lee11a incessantly did her job to promote multicultural issues and repre- · sen ted one of the unfortunately few women's voices on the Forum. Unfortunately, her voice was drowned out, and often .ignored. She did not have anybody on the Forum who was willing to help her put forth her ideas. This is certainly not her fault, but it is the campus' loss. Umang Desai, who was the only candidate for Leena's posi- tion, will certainly do a comparable job, but it appears that he will face similar odds. It is not enough to have bne person speaking for and supporti11g your ideas in the Student Forum. lfthis remains the case, minori- ties will remain virtually voiceless in the pol icy-making areas of this college. Women and minorities, you have the chance to change this situation this week by picking up a petition tor class representa- tive. Sure, odds are that you will lose for various reasons. How- ever, you will get your issues out in the open and show, through your vote total, th:;1t your voice on this campus hears listening to. Sitting on your hands and hollering will not get the job done. Finally~ to the Student Forum: your latest choice to prevent 11ext year's tenn abroad students from running for class representati-ve positions is discriminatory. If you are concerned that there is a lack of women candidates, consider this: more women statistically go on tenns abroad than men. You have just made it tougher for women to enter the Student Forum. This decision is yet another \simple solution\ made by a powerful campus group which will have large, . unwanted ramifications.

The Society was, by far, the biggest theme house, and the first whose aim was to provide social alternatives. In the same year, we saw two greek houses kicked off campus. The administration was bend- ing over backwards to help theme houses, while aL the same time maintaining a \Zero Tolerance\ policy with the greeks. Though I did not necessarily support the administration's course of action, I soon came to the conclusion, along with the majority ofthe stu- dent body, thatthe administration consciously boosted theme houses as a much-needed way to improve the quality oflife for in- dependents, while giving no help to the existing order of greek stu- dents. I used to believe that these housing decisions were con- sciously made. Now I just believe thattheadministration is not co11- scious. What caused my sudden change in opinion, you ask? Al- low me to quickly sum up the events which culminated with a rncnumentally idiotic administra- tive decision that was made about an hour ago today (press night). As spring tenn approached, we (The Society) were faced with the task of filling our 35-bedhouse. !his was no easy task, as I saw ten of.our 35 disgruntled mem- bers transfer out of school be- tween the time we were given the ho1,1se and last term. The April lSthdeadline for filling our house caine and went. despite niuch warning and urging from Resi- den<;e Life and the Dean's Office, and we were still at least ten mem- bersshort. We began to scramble t() find new members and to meet with administrator after adminis- trator, The story is complicated, but it boils down to the following facts. Due to some miscommunication between us and the deans, we sud- denly found ourselves with one day to come up with 14 con- tracts-needless to say, we failed. Our first floor was taken away t() be given away to a yet un- named and conceivably nonexist- ent group. After this decision had been made, we continued to try to fill the house, hoping we could de it before this group was named. In fact, we succeeded and came up with 35 names by the Thanks Concordy Staff Dear Concordiensis, Okay, I'm ready for a little lovefest. You know, positive stuff, one big personal of overall rrtush.

Although I had a list of nearly 3 5 independents who wanted .to I ive in the coffee house, Dean Williams told me I would have to turn them away. When I brought up the fact that she was giving our floor of\independenC housing away to a sorority that was just kicked .off campus last year, she said it \Yasn 't Tri-Delta moving in, but 16 individual Tri- Delts. At this point, Dean Williams might of had a leg to stand on (a very weak, shaky leg, but never the less, a leg), but as I have come to find out this situation isn't as coincidental as it seems, and her figurative leg is nonexistent. Early today, I am told, Dean Wil- liams called the president ofTri- Delt and asked ifthey had 16 girls who would like to block a floor of Raymond. An apparent incensistency de- velops: our floor wasn't offered to those who couldn't get into block lottery but was specifically given to Tri-Delt. Furthennore, Jake Luskin, a junior and one of four last-minute additions to our roster called and spoke with Brian Canavan of Residence Life ear- lier that day. Like the Tri-Delts who had been given block hous- ing, he was noteHgible forb lock housing (because ne missed the application deadline)~ he asked if there was any space left available to block. He was told, defini- tively, \No.\ Because of these questionable decisions made by Residence Life jointly with the Dean's Office, I am now in the position of having to turn away interested next-year juniors because our entire first floor was taken away. These juniors l1ave missed lot- tery and are ineligible for release off campus, and they now will have to I ive in housing that wi II likely be inferior to that of most of next year's freshman class. Meanwhile, \Tri-Delf' was un- able to get a full 16 girls to sign up and are now currently short four or five hea<ls. Furthermore, two ofthe girls in the list will be next year's seniors, who are given lowest preference in the lottery. Their presence on the list further discredits the argument that all these girls are ·~coincidentally\ Tri-Delts. Why would two soe• niors want to live way up cam- pus in a cramped double? My gut feeling is that the first floor of the coffee house is to become Tri~ Delt's hew, unofficial chapter house, and that these girls are making a sacrifice so that their sorority can gain housing. I am not against Tri-Delt re- gaining housing on campus; more: power to them if the administra- tion chooses to give them a house. I do, however, have a proble11l! with the fact that the administm- tion is using hollowclaimstotake away a floor of independent hous- ing. They didn't offer our hoLise to block housing rejects; they gave it to Tri-Delt They didn't do it because they had to fill t:11e rooms; they could have filled ·it: with interested independents Cl'l the same night. Not to menticl'i the fact that Tri-Delt hasn't SLIC- ceeded in filling the hall to capac\- ity. They claim that they want 1()1 do everything they can to helpo give independents a better expe- rience at Union, but like all their other claims, they don't back it up with their actions. Thank You To The Campus In addition to slipping and slid- ing down Psi U's hill this past weekend, we must take a moment and thank the Administration of Union College, the Student Body of Union, and the Greek System in general. Firstly we must thank the Administration for their ac- ceptance and understanding that college students go to extreme measures to have a good time in spite of the weather. Unfortu- nately, the College will have to replace the tom apart greenery in a such a centrally located lawn space on campus, yet the amount of enthusiasm displayed while the event was happening made every naked slide worth the damage. Secondly, we must thank all those who attended the event. If it were not for the courageous stu- dent body who would do anything for booze, bands and burgers, the rainy atmosphere would have scared most college's students away. The turn out for the event was more than expected due to the weather, and the amount of fun that transpired VIas positively the most that could have occurred in the pouring 45 degree rain. So all of you that came out and listened to the music, carrying your trusty coffee mugs, thank you for your attehdance. Finally we 1nust thank the Greek system and the Interfrater- nity Council for producing and organizing the entire afternoon. The Interfraternity Counci I of Union College funded the event and brought in Michael Powers and the Powder Keg from New York City. The Greek System opened their porches, their hills and their kegs (after 4 p.m.) for the entire campus to have a great time. There were certain individu· als who spent significant amounts oftime on the adm in istrati ve end ofthis affair. Planning the sched- uled music, contacting dining ser- vices and having them supply the food, as well as cleaning up the atrocity leftbehind by the student hurricane was all taken care of by a hand full of fantastic people Those people need not be named, tor we thank you and your efforts are certainly commended by th~ campus. So if all of you think back b I ast year's \m udfest,\ the student body this year did even more damage, ate more food and hacl even a better time doing it. Sincerely~ Jason Kellman \A Greek Enthusiast\ Who and What is The Real Problem Mr. Owens, I find it very interesting that one has enough time on his hands to write on why students ought to use drugs. What's the matter, get- ting high alone too often and need company? Why not put your spare time into something useful such as reading how drugs not only harm the user (and thank God they do), but how they af- fect the moral, i.e. non-users. Stu- dents who use marijuna are 85 times more likely to move onto harder drugs than those students who have not. Maybe thattoo is your aim. Perhaps you don't mind that school playgrounds are in- fested with dealers; or that peop I e can't leave their windows open on summer nights~ or that women can't walk alone after dark. Marijuana isn't even the prcb· lem. For that matter, drugs are11't the problem. You'retheproblern Without users there would be 110 dealers, much less crime, and bei· ter editorials in the school neVIs- paper.

Growing Pains by Michelle Tham Features Editor Well, this past weekend I par- ticipated in the Crop Walk to save hungry people or something like that. And as I was bouncing along that little six-mile hike, I realized something very odd. I 'mold. be dragged inside even though it was dark out ancl I hadn't eaten in hours? Nowadays, I can't bear to miss a meal (sadly, they'reusu- ally a highlight in my day) and a mile on the treadmill is quite an effort. ' .; . ' c Okay; so maybe I'm being a little bit melodramatic here, but it's in my nature to exaggerate. I'm only 18 and that's hardly the age for am id-1 ife crisis. The thing is, when I was in elementary school I could stay up for hours on end; running, jumping, chas- ing boys, riding my bike, playing hide-and-go-seek, climbing trees, you name it. I was awesome at freeze tag and except for those games of dodge ball with the nasty boys who never let me play .. .I had a pretty active child- hood. If I wasn't outside caus- ing some sort of a ruckus, I was in my house just driving my par- ents absolutely mad. I wonder where all the energy went. Did I lose it all to Iate-n ight study and staying up past two o'clock? I'd hate to think that I'm in a downward spiral towards old age. I am trying to held on and preserve some sense of the six year old thatstilllives in me and comes out to play once in a while. Of course I have my moments of maturity (though they are brief) but I am scared that I'll find my- self yelling at my little brother to come inside because it's dark out · or that I 'II tell him not to do some- thing because he might \lose an eye.\ Tales from the Suitcase: A Student Speaks Granted, I am still one of the most hyper people youwill ever meet, but I've lost some of my spunk. Come to think of it, 1 can't remember the last time I played gotch last with anyone (I used to do that a lot.. .even in high school). And yes, I was one of those girls who was obsessed with playing ManHunt late at night with the neighborhood kids. It was quite a sight, anigh school senior, and a girl for that T)1atter, chasing kids around the block and hiding in bushes. I had the best time and most people just got a kick out of the way I was still a little kid. And I know that some- where under there I always will be. So here I am now and after a gorgeous day out in the sun walk- ing with some of my best friends, my body aches and I'm tired. This is ridiculous. I'm not exactly bed- ridden and I dou 't need medica- tion or anything, but what hap- pened to the days when I couldn't All I can do for myself right now is remember to catch a few rightening bugs whenever I get the chance. I still love Popsicles and green Jello .... so I think that for right now I'm still okay. I'll !:Jave to work on the playing out- side all day thing ... but hopefully the summer sun will cure that one. I don't want it to have to be an effort, because being youthful should be a natural thing. I think I tried too hard to listen to people when they,,told me that college was about growing up and find- ing a level-headed personality. I want to tind a way to never grow up. Not to sound too Peter Pan- esque ... but nature's first green is gold. I'd rather be a first grader with lunch box in hand and Smurf bookbag on my back. I want to make mud pies and laugh just because. I want to be silly and hyper and never have to go to sleep. by Daniel J. Andelman Staff Writer First of all,./ would lilce to pref ace this article by admitting the fact thatlts title should tech~ically be \Tales from a Luggage Alum- nus. \ However, since l'malt.etuly a graduate ofthisjine instituti()n of higher learning, I n.o longer have to abide by silly singular aJ'ld plural rules.

It may sound cliched, but four years in this little paradise in Upstate New York passes very quickly. So, to help you <:razy un- der-grads maximize your time while you're here, I've compihd a list of stuff you should d() be- fore yon graduate. Please no4e: this I ist does not include Sllch sophomoric (my apologies to the sophomore class) goals as doing Sweet Sounds ofUrtion's Dutch Pipers by Randy Pellisb Staff Writer The CD we've all been wait- ing for is here!! Our beloved Dutch Pipers (DP) have served up their long awaited CD, \Brandywine Diner,\ and it is yummmmmy. The DP CD is as great as a late night visit to everyone's favorite diner. Like the menu at Brandywine, the Pip- ers have given us an array of dif- ferent tunes to please our palate. There are beautiful tunes of past and present. The songs offer en- joyment while providing lots of advice about life. These guys ob- viously know a lot about women and love from which we can all learn. The DP CD is not just mu- sic for the soul; it is music for the mind, for the body, and for ev- ery Union ear. All songs are great. I 'II men- tion some just to give you a sample of the menu. Definitely one of DP's best, \If I Had A Million Dollars,\ fills the listener like a full plate of gravy fries. \Loch Lomond\ featureing Jer- emy Lynch '99 soothes the wild beast in us all with sweet, wistful chords just like the soothing at- mosphere at Brandywine. Myste- riously, the Jazz Singer, Neil Dia- mond, can be heard in \Girl You'll Be A Woman Soon,\ al- though rumor has it that it is just Morgan Hargove. The tune \Slam\ even shows us that DP does not always get along as this tune captures a chance argument between Hargrove; Steve Hoyt, and Jon Zandman. Sure the Dutch Pipers are celebrities, but they're real people. They have their share of tifts as they create beautiful music. The Piper's not only provide us music with this CD, but give us songs describing life and the im- portant people we meet. In \Fire- man,\ Jeff Druzba tells us about the family life of firemen. In \Why Don't We Do It In The Road\ Marty Metz gives us all important, solid advice about traf- fic rules and safety precautions<Jn our nation's infrastructure. '\Mf:lil- man\ tells the story ofltappy let- ter carrier (use Cliff Clavin as a visual). And then there is always the mellifluous and euphoni()us voice ofJeff\Kaz\ Kasowitz and the bassy baseman Jeff Sacllar whose tones attract more attenti<On than the Pied Piper. I surveyed others about the new CD and the responses we're in- credible. Janci Karp and Quinlan Murphy responded witb nothing as the DP CD left them speech- less. Eric Svenson responded with, \I thoroughly enjoyed ev- ery meal on the menu and was pleased to be greeted by good old. fashioned service with a srn ile.\ That man knows his Bra.ndywi11e. I have to say that to let this CD pass by is a terrible sin. This i:s a moment that should be seize<! by all. Carpe Diem! I You must !).uy this musical compilation of eu- phoria. Go for it. trust me!

T h u r b e · r v ill e ;~~ by Rawson Thurber If you missed Frat-Stock, then you've missed the coolest thing to happen at Union this year.

Student of tl1e Week: This week tile award goes to Ken Berman. What did Ken do to deserve this honor? Well he is most probably the staunchest defender of democracy at Union College. During this past election, Ken was among the overwhelming 35% of students who saw fit to express their I iberty at the polls. Ken stepped .into the booth and attempted to pusll the big red lever back to its starting position so thathis vote could be recorded. Unfortunately however, the reset button hadn't been switched, so the lever was locked in place. This of course d.idn't stop Mr. Berman. He put his entire weight behind the next thrust, and subsequently threw his back out, and thereby recorded the first instance of injury due to a Union Collet?;e election. I, for <>ne, think that immediate and over-reactive action should take place. From now on, students should not be allowed to vote. Instead, a select pa11el of administrators should review the flyers of each candidate and select officers based on the use of puns~ fonts, and scanned photographs. Administrat(}ro[tl1eWeek: Those ofyou who were still around when Dean Alford walked ·to the top of mud-slide llill in pressed khakis, loafers, and a Union sweatshirt to the.chantsof\ ALFORD, ALFORD, ALFORD\ witnessed howour beloved Dean did not bend to the encourage- ment and incitements of students. No, Dean Alford would not mud- slide, and I for one congratulate him. He set a great example of how to be your own person. Had he thrown caution to the wind and flung himself down the slope, he would not only have been extremely mnddy, but he would have gone down in Union College history. It's not every day that a man can stare history in the face and exclaim, \Not I! No! I will not be remembered! l will fade into history forgotten!\ Kudos to Dean Alford. By the way, don't let him fool you. Dean Alford was rumored to have been mud-sliding in a blue helmet (how fitting) with students on Friday. Maybe he's more cool than we think he is. Just One MCJre Tlting .... Last week there appeared a ''paragraph\ to the editor, in which an alumnae by the name of Karen Gado expressed her distaste for my brand of repetitive and often unfunny humor. I usually don't waste time responding to my critics, but this was just too sweet to pass up. First, I would I ike to say in my defense that I would like to know where it is written (except in the dictionary) that humor has to be funny? And secondly, if l was an alumnus, fretting over a hack columnist in the Concordy would be the last thing one 111y \To Do\ list.

However, the over- all quality of the film was en- hanced by his political agenda. As compared to traditional ro- mances, this movie made the au- dience reconsider~'standard\ defi~ nitimis in a world that is rapidly veering from such views. CLYDE: I agree that it seemed the director was trying to get across prophetic messages, and often the characters seemed to come out with l.ines that appeared far too rehearsed for the spontaneous. moments duringwhich they arose. For example, when the lesbian asks hernew friend, \Is there any- thing you want-to ask me?,'' in re• gards to her sexuality, the ques- tions he asks seem to explain the character's motivations a little too directly. There is no roo111 for sur- prise~ since everything is too straightforward. Also, although I know the di- rector likes to include the two char- acters, Silent Bob and Jay, in his movies for comicrelief(Smith him- self plays Sile11t BolJ), I felt their appearance here was too distract- ing and long. They approach the comic book artist in a restaurant andspout their own vulgar views on love for too long. BONNIE: I disagre~. The movie ·~eemed too concentrated on the tllree main characters, and with- ottt sa<;h interruptions by Silent Bob, Jay; or Hooper, the charac- hnwould have drowned in their own depressed self-importance. F()f those of you following the· racial controversy in the Concordy, a subplot brought to light a char&cter named Hooper, V/h() was publicly am ilitant Black 'Htnther and privately a soft and :fu:zzy homosexual who makes a · . r atlghing stock of the whole race issue.

Mallrats, so I was quiteim- ])ressed that he treated the issue~ ]:)resented so well-very directly, :honest! y, and not stereotyp ically. Alth<;>ugh his dialogue was highly vulgar, for some reason it con- 1airied the character's hearts and ~esires very truthfully, although .again many ofthe \charactermo- thations\ were recited as if staged. BONN1E: One of my favorite parts was the way he connected his pre- vi<>'uS movies' plots to this one. A.lyssa, .the lesbian love interest; relates an oddly familiar tale of her best friend, who·slept with .a dead guy in a convenience store bath- ro()m, and who now resides in an ins.ane asylum. Alyssa's main. dr~twback was her voice, a whiny' version of Melanie Griffith that reallygratedduring the numerous screaming matches she had with H()lden, the main character.

Well, sort of The nonnally calm wa- ters of the lake were white cap- ping early Sunday morning, mak- ing conditions too dangerous to row and leading to the cancella- tion of the final round of compe- tition. As one team 1nember ob- served, \Crew depends on the weather, and that is something you justhave to learn to deal with.\ The team left for Rome under rainy skies at 6:00AM Saturday morning, groggy yet optimistic for the races that awaited them. They were confident in the train- ing and the hard work they had put in up to this point in the sea- son, and they felt ready to chal- lenge their competitors. The first round of races was the Varsity Women's Open Four, with graduating senior Caroline Nemet, Susanna Ryan. Kenley Smith. and captain Katie Ott. Coxswain Katie Murray, also a graduating senior,. commented, \Despite the weather, l felt that we had a really solid race.\ The fi:ve women came off the water drenched and shivering from the pouring rain, but with the fastest ()Verall time, which placed them in the final round on Sunday.

They did not make the finals, but they knew rain and focused their combined power in an impressive collective effort. \Swearing to each other to make the finals,\ commented . Davis, \we rowed with our hearts and fi.nished first with the best overall time. Unfortunately, we could not get the gold in New York as the finals would be a veritable force to contend with on the water.

I pushed myself harder than ever and, for this reason, the season turned out to be a success.\ The Varsity Men's Four dem- onstrated that same level of COI1- centrated energy and team cohe- siveness, crossing the finish ahead of allcrews not just in their heat, but in their event.

Sp()l:fs Lacrosse Ends Disappointing Season With a Loss by Jamie Griffin Staff Writer The Dutchmen lacrosse season came to a close this past week against Hamilton and Williams. Union played very well against Hamilton, picking up their fourth win ofthe season. Williams, who had already clinched a playoff spot, proved to be am uch tougher contender. The Dutchmen challenged Wil- liwn~ this past Monday. Williams came out with a lot ofconfidence and offensive drive and scored four quick goals. After these goals, the Dutchmen were able to ke~p the game pretty close through the third quarter. In this period, Chad Kimball tallied up three goals, and Dave Parrot had two. Meanwhile, the defense in this time was able to keep the ball on the offensive. Senior defenseman Jason Pinney, also known as the \Long Stick Legend,\ played outstandingly in his last game as a Dutchman. Goalie Grant Pollock also played very well: he made a bunch of important saves and was able to hit the attackman and mid-fielders for the fast break. During the fourth quarter, Williams pul.led away by scoriAg a number of unan- swered goals and won the game by a score of 16-6. The last win of the season that the Dutchmen was against Hamilton last .Friday. The final score of this game was I 0-8. There were many positives for the Dutchmen in this game, both of- fensively and defensively; it was a come-from-behind win for the Dutchmen. Offen~ively, many players contributed to the victory. Pollock P'layed the full game, Softball Ends Season ... ( Continued From Page24) leading22 RBI's. Cassie Lawton and Beth Gabriel led the freshman with averages of .342 and .340, respectively. Finally Amy Nyren rounded out the attack, finishing her senior year with <i .305 aver- age, I 9 RBI' s, and 13 runs scored. The Dutchwomen will be say- ing a sad good-bye to three won- derful seniors. Amy Nyren, a bi- ology major from Sutton, Massa- chusetts, was a four-year player, a three-year letter winner, and a two-year starter. A captain of this year's team, Amy played third base and first base and finished the season with a .305 batting average. Amy led the team in triples and drove in 19 RBI's. Kelly Nadeau, a chemistry major from Penacook, New Hampshire, was a four-year player and a three-year letter winner. Kelly has played second b~se, third base, and shortstop during her career. Kelly finished this sea- son with an outstanding .935 fielding percentage. Amy Hitz, a psychology major from Acton, Massachusetts, was a newcomer to the softball· team this year. Amy was an iiTepla~eable part of the te'am with her constant enth u- siasm and dedication. Although . there are not any solid sta~istics to show it, Amy was always the on.e to look to when the team needed a boost or a seventh in- ning pinch hit RBI game winner. These seniors will be greatly missed, and we would I ike to take this opportunity to them how much we appreciated their lead- ership and dedication. Thank you seniors! making some necessary saves down the stretch and some excel- lent passes into the mid- field. Defensemen Pinney and Nick Goaterplayed very well once 1:1gain. The fourth quarter was the Dutchmen highlight, as they kept a vic- tory well out ofHamilton's . reach. The Dutchmen's season was somewhat disappoint- ing for the players. As sophomore mid.-fielder Stephen Hoyt said, \The season ended below what we were expecting. There were some things that will make us look forward to next season, and possibly we will hav.ea winningteam.\ The captain~ for next year are Pollock, Kimball, and Rich Ferro. The team feels that these selec- tions will lead the Dutchmen to victory. \There is a strong junior class, which provides good leadership for next season,\ said freshman attackman Chris Moran. Overall, the Union College men's lacrosseteam finished bet- ter than last season. The Dutch- men played many close losses against some tough teams that could have gone either way. This year's captain, Pinney, said that\ things with the program seem to be getting more serious.\ Granted, the number of graduat- ing seniors that are leaving will set back the Union Dutchmen, but as long as the players work hard on the off-season, they should have a successful season next year. Baseball Going to Playoffs ... (Cont'd From Page 24) proved Kazmierczak's record to 4-3afterthe2wl victory. The Dutchmen's five-game winning streak was put on the line on Friday against Vassar. The Skidmore sweep gave the Dutch- men 16 wins for a tie of their pre- vious regular-season victory record (which they tied last year). A win against Vassar would give the 1997 Union baseball squad a place in history. The first game was nip and tuck record .. ---------------------------------------1 throughout, but with President All season long, Union has had a great mixture of pitching and hitting. Offensively, Union is led by junior outfielder Jeremy Lamb, whose .440 batting aver- age and four home-runs were tops on the team. In 100 at-bats, he had 28 RBI's and recorded 65 total bases. Sophomore third baseman Todd Ellis was second on the team in batting, hitting .4 22 in 83 at-bats. His 30 RBI' s led the team in that offensive cat- egory. Tennis Team ·Beats Cliarkson Struggles Against Skidmore, Hamilton by Peter Simon Staff Writer The Union men's tennis team finished up its toughest week of the schedule. Play- ing the two best teams in the league, Hamilton and Skidmore, the Dutchmen gave it their all, but still fell short. Clarkson would be the only win earned by the Dutchmen this past week and a much deserved win as well. Starting with the Wednesday match against Hamilton, the tennis team, un- der the leadership of Captain Jordan Pinsker, looked to put a dent into the team's impeccable record Unfortu- nately, Hamilton was unyielding and handed Union a tremendous loss. All seven matches were taken by Hamilton. However, Union was not easily defeated, six of the matches were lost in the third set Furthermore, \The Doctor\ Pinsker and Jared Sheikh showed off their doubles skills and defeated the be.st doubles team in the league by the scote of9-8. The overall score in the match does not reflect the win, because two out of three doubles matches need to be won in order for a team to colfect a point. Hamilton was able to win the other two doubles matches andre- ceived a point. Union's fun did not end there. On Sunday, Skidmore arrived on the courts behind Lamont House equipped with their high-powered serves and high pitched grunts. The Dutchmen did not have the energy to fight off the powerful \Saratoga Springers.\ Sam Berger suffered a tough loss to Skidmore's \Grunter.\ At the end of the day, the score was 6-1 in favor of Skidmore. Although keeping each match close, it was not exactly the outcome Union was in search of Shiekh, while restringing his racquet, com- mented on both the Hamilton and Skidmore matches, \Considering they are the two best teams in the league,! feel we did really welL six matches were lost in the third set... mak- ing people aware that in the future, Union will be a team to look out for.\ Clarkson learned the hard way about · Union's motivation toward becoming the best in the UCAA. The Dutchmen did not drop a s.ingle match against Clarkson. Pinkser played amazing ten- nis as did number one seed Shiekh. The match ended with Union blanking the Golden Knights by the score of7-0. The Dutchmen have an away match against Williams on May 6, and a home match against Hartwick on the May I 0. Union tennis fans shouid not be discour- aged by the two losses to Skidmore and Hamilton. The Dutchmen are not out of . the race for a good placement in states competition at the end of the season. Right now \vith top seeded players Pinsker, Shiekh, . and Berger, all playing in top form, the men's tennis team shol:lld go undefeated for the re- mainder of the season. Roger Hull in attendance, the Dutchmen picked blp their record 17th victory in a 5-3 defeat of . Vassar. Rich Nespola ptcked up the victory, moving his record to 1-1. Game two was close until the fifth inning, when Union scored nine runs. David Kline was able to hold off Vassar for the remaining innings in the 16-2 Union victory. Kline moved his record to a team-best 3-1. Sunday, due to the previous day's inclement weather; Union was forced to complete their regu- lar season at RPI against Williams (RPI tarps their field). Williams, a perennial powerhouse i11 most collegiate sports, overpowered two strong Dutchmen pitchers. In game one, Ryan Almstead re- corded a defeat in a 13-3 final. Game two brought the same re- sults for Josh Soldo as Williams defeated Uni()n 16-7. Soldo's fi- . nal regular-season record is 4-5, and Almstead' sis 4-3. The losses · gave Union their final record- breaking 18-15 · lar~season The final .400 hitter 011 this year's team was senior Eric Kujawski. who in I 08 at-bats hit the ball at a .417 clip. As a whole, the Dutchmen hit an impressive .338, while scoring 253 runs in 33 games. Defensive.ly, the Dutchmen are led by soph()more Craig Kazmierczak and junior David Kline. Kazmierczak went 4-3 on the year and had an ERA of3.88, while Kline was 3- I with a4.41 ERA. Kline feltthatmak- ing the playoff is a great for not only the team, but athletics at Union. \It's great for the school and for the baseball program that we got into the playoffs. We are finally getting the noteriety and attention that we deserve. We are excited to play Binghamton We have been working towards this game since September,\ hesaid. lfUnion is victorious, they will playthewinnerofthe other semi- final game between Oswego and Oneonta on Saturday at 1 FM in the tournament championsllip.

A Tribute to KJ After finishing his best season as a pro~ the. Sun's Kevirdohnson is retiring at the age of 31. A ·string of injuries ·pFOmpted his early retirement. This season was his firstrelatively healthy year in ~ four years. Heplayed in 70of82 games this year: He missed 109 games in the previous four years. The Suns made the playoffs nine times in his ten 'Years as starting point guard. He and Charles Barkley led Phoenix to the NBA Chmnpionship in 1993 against the Bulls and ·lost in six games. Johnson is one of only six play- ers to surpass 11,500 points, 6.,000 assists, 2,000 rebounds, and I, 100 steals. This season he av- eraged over 20 points and nine assists. He is not your typical point guard because he is not only .a great playmaker but also a great scorer. The Suns lost to the heavily favored Sonics in the first round in five games. They had a chance to.close·out the series on their haine court in game four af... ter Rex Chapman made an off balance three pointer in the dos- ing secondstosendthe game into overtime. Seattle· went on to win game four in overtime, andclosed KJ's career and the Sun's season by winning handily in game five on their home court. · KJ is also a tre- tfi.endous am-bassador to the . gatn.e. Hewouldhavebeenafree ·agentafterthis seasonand would have commanded big bucks ifhe chose to phi.y another year. Johnson finished his career on a tremendous note, and he said .he only has highl:ights to remember and no regrets. The $uns and the NBA would Jove to see KJ return for another season and get a chance to win a NBA Championship. If not, the NBA is losing a true gentlemen and a great player. KJ is going out on_ his- terms, and will hope- fully be remembered for his in- tense desire to win and his classi- ness on and offthe court. Big-Time Performer ofthe Week Penny Hardaway of the Or- lando Magic who played bril- liantly afterhis'team lostthefirst two games oftheir opening.tound series to the Heat in resound'in.g fashion. No one predicted the Magic to do what they did after falling be~ hind by twenty in game three at home. Horace Grant did not play ataH in the series. Rony Seikaly was injured early ··in game three and missed· the rest of the series. Nick Anderson and Dennis Scott the other. two starters were non .. factors. All Penny didtolead his team to two victories at home by scoring 42 and 41 points respe~­ tively. His performance re- minded me of Michael Jordan in his early yearS when he wasa one man team. Hardaway picked up and-carried the Magic on his back. In game five; .he scored 33 points while playing all but one mittute of the game. Penny also faced . constant double and triple teams. His supporting cast was a bunch ofCBA players. Hardaway brought his team back from 16 to only down three late in the fourth quarter, I fPenny and the Magic cou.ld have. squeaked out a victory in game five in Miami, it would have been one ofthe biggest upsets in NBA playoffhistory. The Heathadjust finished offtheif best regular sea- son in franchise history by win- ning 61 games. Miami did not break under the game five pres,.. sure and won by a score of91-83 and will go and face the Knicks in the second round. If not for Penny's heroics, this series would have ended in three games. Penny Hardaway's pedormance was extremely special andmemo- rable. ,Penny is my big-time per- fanner of the week. · Pitino toCeltics? The BostonCeltics have report- edly offered the stand-out Ken- tucky coach a lengthy ten-year contract worth a monstrous $70 mill ion to become the next coach of the once proud, storied fran- chise. · Pitino planned to make an of- ficial announcement this past Tuesday. Sourcescloseto P:itino and the Celtics. believe he will take the job for a variety of rea- sons including the great 5pportu- nity to coach a team steep with tradition. The cJ1all:enge of m<ltivating pro players is also another incen- tive of becoming an NBA head coach again. Anotherreason for him to take the job isthatit would ·return Pitino to Boston, an area where h~ played four years at UMASS, and was head coach at BU and Providence. Piti-no also indicated that he does not want to take overa team from scratch, and believe it or nat, the Celts have some building blocks, including Antoine Walker, who played for Pitino at UK. In addition, Bos- ton is guaranteed at least one of the top three picks in this year's draft, as well as the Mavericks' ·number-one pick, which should be a high lottery pick as well. lfPitino does not take this job, he plans to stay at Kentucky for the remainder ofhis coaching ca- reer. Pitino has received other offers from NBA teams in past seasons that he has turned down- -most recently, the New Jersey Nets last off-season. The Celtics last won an NBA title in 1986, an.d have failed to advance past the first round of playoffs since 1992. The last time they reached the playoffs was 1995, andtheteam teamjustcom- pleted the sorriest season in their history with a 15-67 record, lead- ing to last week's resignation of so-called coach M. L. Carr. l am a diehard Celts fan, and I know there are a. lot of us on this campus who would love to see Pitino take the job and begin the long rebuilding process. With Pitino taking over the helm, two lottery picks, and Antoine Walker, the Celticshave finally started to tum the comer and things are looking up in Beantown! It's abouttime! Banner Weekend For Riggi A_nd Track Team At States State Meet Concludes Decent Season For Union Track and Field by Jason Everett StajfWriter Track team members partici- pating in the state championships traveled to Rochester this past weekend to conclude their season. Several men and women from the Union squad made the trip to compete both on the track and in the field. Although the team scores for the men and women are not overly impressive, they do not even come close to reflecting how much heartanddetermination the Union participants personified over the two days of competition. Starting off the competition for the men was Bryan Roy in the decathlon. Roy, displaying tre- mendous versatility on and off the track finished fourth in the ten event competition with 5450 points. In addition; Roy com- peted in the jumps and in the 110m hurdles. This next athlete, senior co- captainDave Riggi, set out to ac'- compiish one thing- place in the 100m and place in the 200m, Competing in his laststate cham- pionships here at Union, Riggi had whatwas arguably one of his best state championships. Riggi competed in three events, the lOOm, 200m, and 4xl00. In all three he medaled. Truly an ex- ceptionalachievemertt consider- ing the short recovery Riggi had between events. Riggi started the final day of competition off by anchoring the 400m relay team of Clark Searle, Jesse Prisco, and Jason Jennings. Riggi received the baton in gr.ea~_P<?.~i!ion from Jennings and brought the team home to finish in fourth place in 43.57: Riggi next competed in the 1OOm. After a 11.22 in the pre- liminaries, and a 11.01 in the semi-finals, Riggi managed a l 1 .13 in the finals to finish in third place behind a Hartwick runner and perennial top finisher Krishaun Gilmore ·Of RPI. Next up was the 200m where Riggi was the defending champion from last year. In this last race, after a gru- eling 24 hours of preliminaries (22.65), semi-finals (22.97) and finals, Riggi, despite tying his personal best, finished third in 22.50. Although he did not re- claim his title, Riggi undeniably had a tremendous meet, season, and career here at Union. Also making his final trip to states was senior Jason Jennings. Jennings competed in the 200m, long jump, and triple jump. Jennings' had a bit of an off day in the 200 flnishingcin 23.29 for seventeenth of twenty:- three. This 23.29 was off the 22.6 he had run last week at RPI. In the long jump, Jennings finished twelfth of twenty with a leap of 6.16m. In the triple jump, he finished ninth of eighteen with a hop-skip-and- jump of 12.76111. Also compet- ing i'n the triple-jump was Roy who managed a jump ofi2.96m to land hjm in sixth place overall good for a medal. In the long jump, Prisco fouled on all of his jumps. The 800rn trialswere held on Friday night with Union's Nick Conway and Pete Flynn competing. Flynn and Conway can be described with one word : exceedingly determined. In the -trials, Flynn and Conway finished in seasonal bests 1 :58.45 and 1 :58.14 respectively. Slightly under two hours later, this dy- namic duo teamed up with co- captain Jay Goldberg and sopho- more Nate Childs to defend Union's 4x800m title from last year. With former member ofthe sqt:md Mike Leding in attendance, this foursome took to the track in what was one of the most men1o- rable performance of the season not so much for the \spLits\ re- corded, but for the heart shown. Childs, in only his second 800m race ever, led off the race and ran smart in his two lap tour of the track to hand off to Goldberg slightly behind second place after a2:04 split. Goldl>erg proceeded to walk down the Hartwick runner on the b:ack- stretchand attempted to close the gap on the first place runner. Goldberg ran a seasonalbest 2:03 and handed off to Conway who set out to spill his guts on the track. Conway running with tire and determination caught the leader with a 1:59 split and. handed off to Flynn with a slight lead. Flynn, perhaps not fully recovered from his 1:58 only two hours earlier, went through the 400m in slightly under 59 sec- onds, but the demons grabbed hold of him on the backstretch and Flynn finished with a 2:05 split in second place. The team finished in 8:13.19 for eighth place off last yeal''s 7:52 winning performance. Despite the disap- pointing team finish, the bri.ght side is that this squad may be in- tact come indoor next year and Yt' s of the team for outdoor next year. ln. the 11Om high hurdles, Roy finished fourteenth in 20.12 after havin~ trouble with one of the hurdles. In the hammer, also in his last trip to states, Jon Gainor finished seventh with a thmw of 41.48m. In the javelin, R<Jy fin,.. ished tenth of twenty-one with a throw of 45.78m. ldris Abdui- Aziz finished twelfth with a 45.06. Jennel Royal finished ·nineteenth with a 35 .24. In the 800m finals, Nick Conway once again ran with fire. With ardent Union track sup- porter Mr. Leding in attendance screaming one word- \\lets :See the Conway kick:' Conway ran a tough race to finish in fourth place in 2:01.08. Flynn ran tough as well, butthe future of Union track had what.had been inconceiv~ble, a second somewhat off race in the span of 24 hours. Coach. Larry Cottrell attributed this to Flynn's missing indoor track due to term abroad contributing ta Flynn's \lack of base;'. Flynn ran a 2: 1254 still good for eighth place overall. Overall the men's team finished in eighth place out of thirteen schools with 39 points. The Union women finished in 14th with 2 points. Sophomore Katie MacDowell had a bit of an insipid race in the 1500m. Un- like indoor states, MacDowell was unable to make the finals of the 1500 and finished in seven- teenth place in 5:18.85. MacDowell attributed herslightly \off' time to a q11ick first lap. In the SOOOm, Kelly Jamieson was coming off a personal best 19:57 last week at RPI. Just as MacDowell had a fast first lap, Jamieson followed with a slightly more damaging fast first mile. Althoogh Coach Todd Donniey screaming incessantly \You gotta go,\ Jamie13on wasunahletokick in the last two laps and finished in thirteenth place in 20:45.52. In the long julnp, new. Union record holder Autumn Renn fin- ished in fifteenth place with a peal of 4.63m. Also in the field, fel- low new Union record holder Jordanna Mallach was clearly a , \smooth operator\ clearing a height of 1.53m in the pole vault to finish fifth. In the discus, sometimes overlooked Carolyn Cieslowki had a tremendous meet finishing seventh out of nineteen with a throw of 30.l4m . .In the hammer competition, in her last Union meet, co--captain Michelle · Woodward finished fourteenth with a throw of28.64m. Last but not least was the 4x 1OOm squad ofRenn, Daniell a Chiulli, Brenna Maguire, and Mallach. Afterastrenuous week of practicing the execution of the baton passes, the time came to compete. Renn ran a magnificent lead off leg on th.e tum to hand off to Chiulli. Chiulli proceeded to run the backstretch and ex- ecuted a textbook pass to Maguire who then handed off to Mallach. The squad finished in thirteenth place overall in 59.46, four sec- onds offlast weeks 55.55 perf or- mance at RPi.

Softball Colllpletes Season Full of Highs and Lows Dutchwomen Break Losing Streak, But Lose Their Final Game to 4-!bany by Carrie He roth Staff Writer Tile Union College softball team finally had reason to ceiM ebrate last week as they brok~ their 11 game losing streak against Russell Sage. After two more disappointing losses to Utica earlier in the week, the DLJtchwomen decided to pull it together for two solid victories against Sage. Unfortunately, Union finished their season closer with a loss to Albany and were rained out of their last chance at a win in the second game. After being rained out twice, Union finally traveled to Utic~a to take on the sixth-seeded team in the New York State Tournament. Union lost the first game w~th a . scor.e of 3-2.

Comic Hypnotist Draws 300 Students by Frank R()ssi Editor-in-Chief Last Wednesday, the freshmen class sponsored one of the high- est-attended entertainment events at Union this year. Three-hun- dred students gathered in the Memorial Chapel to watch local \comic hypnotist\ Michael Ray. Ray asked the audience to per- ,., '· form two hypnotic tests before asking for over thirty volunteers. After narrowing down the volun- teers to those who were the most susceptible subjects, he began the real show. Hypnotized students performed acts such as exotic dancing and acting like Madonna. Ray, a Saratoga Springs, NY resident, taught himself how to perform hypnotism just seven years ago. However, he started to delve into magic starting at age nine. \I've always wanted to do continued on page 3 National News .................................... 8 Features ................................................. /2 Op-ed ................................................. 9 Art.\· & Entertainme11t .. ...........................

This trip provided a group of Union stu- dents with a fir3:t han<!' look at health related sch<Jol~ as well as an opportunity to llleet with Union alumni whoarel:lealth care professionals. This id.ea was first proposed by the Pre-!Iealth So- ciety officers over a year ago. It was not until last May thatthe trip began to take shape, a.s Dr. An- thony Romanazzi, a dentist from Glens Falls, New \Y ork.who is an alumnus ofboth Uni()n and Tufts, .offered the society a guided tour ofthe dental school. rhe pieces slowly came together through the hard work of Stev·e Epstein, Floren Robinson, and Professor Karen Williams. Before they knew it, the group waos on their way to Boston. The first part of the trip was high-lighted by a visit to Sargent College Of Allied Health Profes- sions (part of Boston Uni-versity). This program was arranged by Union alumnus Rachel N urick '95, a speech therapist student at Sargent Rachel, along with her fel tow classmates. provided Union students with infonnation Tufts University's Medical and Dental Schools.

Often the first time a student goes to the medical very important. Professor Karen Williams, director of the Pre- Health Society, said \pre-med students often exclude other op- tions to just medical schools with- out knowing if medicine is what they really want.\ The group then proceeded to then met with Union alumni Todd Ray and Laura Immanuel,. first and second year dental student re- spectively. who guided a tour of the medical and dental schools. They showed the gross anatomy Jab, where two Tufts medical stu- dents were reviewing for an up- school is when they go for an interview or even the first day of class.\ On Saturday May 3, a recep- tion with Boston area alumni was held in the Tremont House Ho- tel, arranged by the Alumni Of- fice. This was a perfect opportu- nity for Union students to talk to alumni whoare currently practic- ing in the medical fields. The alumni gave their personal in- sights on preparing for medical school. A number of them stressed the idea of not rushing into medical school. They sug- gested that a year of clinical ex- perience, medical research, or further graduate studies would be beneficial in deciding if the medi- cal field is suitable for the pre- med students. In fact, Union graduate Todd Ray(' 96), stressed the point that the average age in his dental class is 26. The recep- tion was truly advantageous for Union students as a great deal was learRed from the alumni. This trip provided students with insignts on medical school admis- sions and life in medical school in general. Besides being able t() get the first hand look at the medi- cal and dental schools and to talk to alumni in the fields, students were able to enjoy the city of Boston in their free time. Next year's trip is in the making with the destination looking to beN ew York City. Anyone interested in helping to plan for this trip should contact Professor Karen Williams at the Undergraduate Health Pro- fessions Office (x6062). Professor Berk Describes Judaism in the 20th Century by Michelle N~i.er Staff Writel' On Tuesday, May 13, the Jew- ish Student Union. an<! the UJF sponsored a speech by Professor Stephen Berk about Judaism at the end ofthe twentieth century. The talk encompassed issues re- lating to the three major popula- tions of Jews in the vt<Jrld, those irt the former USSR., the United States, and Israel In tne course of the hour, he touched on the major problems concerning Jews around the world and possible solutions. Concerning the Jewish people in the former USSR, Prof. Berk raised the issue that at th.e present moment their main <:oncems are not necessarily those ;()[Judaism but rather those of humanity - avoiding starvation and dehu- manization. Also, another thrust of their interests is the question of the survival of democracy in their country. As a nation rebuild- ing itself, the Russia11 people are fighting to survive. In forming a new identity, though, many Bus- sian authors believe that the people are looking for a stronger authoritarian rule. Berk com- pared the role of the Germans in the first half of the century to the modern Russians with res'pect to their present instability. Also, Berk pointed out that in the midst of such turmoil, anti-Semitism becomes more prevalent. The most moving argument he pre- sented was that a slogan has re- cently been used again which says \Beat the kikes and save Russia.\ The solution, however, Berk pro- nounced, cannot be brought about by other countries but by Russia itself. Berk presented today's Jewish society in the United States in contrast to the Russians. The question Berk presented is not whether or not anti-Semitism ex- ists in this country. hut rather how prevalent it is. He feels that, af- ter the tragedy of Auschwitz, it would be a mistake not to be aware of anti-Semitism. Th·e dan- ger involved in today's society is the extreme assimilation of Jews. To elaborate on his point, Berk told the story of a great rabbi who was asked whether the Jews of his town sh()uld support Napoleon Bonaparte or the reigning Tsar. The rabbi's answer was that i fthe Jews supported Napqlcon they would not be oppressed but they would Jose Judaism. If, however, they were to support the Tsar they would still be living in ghettos under horrible conditions but they would still be Jews. In short, the rabbi believed that the people should support the Tsar. So in answer to the question ofh()W the Jews should live in America with- out losing their religious arid cul- tural affiliations, Prof. Berl< 'san- swer is .. With great difficulty.\ He presented many ofthe prob- lems facing Jews today such as the loss of education and Jewish roots. Berk also touched on the idea of intermarriage, which many people cite as one of the problems within the Jewish com- munity. Ultimately, Berk made clear that, although the I eaders of the comniLmity can support vari- ous attempts to keep Judaism alive, the solution lies in the per- sonal decisions. \There is no panacea for Jewish continuity,\ Prof Berk said but he also urged that the \preservation of Judaism is too important to leave to rab- bis.\ He supported the idea of en- countering Jewish tradition both culturally and religiously in or- derto continue Jewish life. The last Jewish community Berk spoke of was that oflsrael. Like those living in the former USSR, the Jews in Israel are not primarily concerned with the im- mediate role of Judaism in their lives. Instead, they are faced with the political struggles of their country, especially that ofthe en- suing peace process. Although he insisted that he is not a \prophet Berk did say that he believes within five years there will be some sort of peace agree- ment. Ffe insisted, however, that he did not know Umt this would be a true peace or an end to the violence. The idea is to acceptthe role of history and use it as a back- ground to predict the future. Ultimately, Berk feels that we \are the most fortunate Jews in history\ Israel has been a place which not only accepts but also defends Jews and takes a stand in their support. As American Jews, \Israel has enabled us to remain Jews.\ It provides a place to renew our faith and interest in both the religion and culture of the people. The route to survival of the Jews, Berk proposed, can be found in four main ideas: politi- cal support, Jewish institutions to combat assimilation, personal choices, and lastly, the use of money to feed, clothe, and sup- port those who are less fortunate. Berk left the aud.ience with the question, \If all that being Jewish means to you is eating a bagel and lox, why be Jewish?\ Comic Hypnotist Michael Ray ... ( Continued FroiD Page 1) stage,\ Ray said. .His intention was to make money,and accord- ing to him, ·'The Jast three years have been self-supporting.\ bne of the fun11iest acts oc- curred when Ray hypnotized two participants into sp(laking \Mar- tian\ language, with ()ne acting as the interpreter. He said that the funniest moment in llis act over the past seven years was dudng such a segment when ;a participant told the crowd how 'Martians use McDonald's hamburgers to wipe theirunderarms. We(]nesday, the participants simulated \Martian sexual positions'' to the crowd under hypnosis. The portion of the show that drew the .largest response from the crowd of 300 occurred when Ray hypnotized freshman repre- sentative Greg Auerbach into for- getting the number four. When Auerbach attempted to count Ray's fingers, he could not say the number \four.\ Later, Ray embarrassed the rest of the crowd when he made them forget their first names. After about 100 minutes of be- ing hypnotized, some ofthe par- ticipants were given final instruc- tions for when they returned to the crowd. Ray then woke up the participants and asked them how long they thoughtthey were hyp- notized. Answers ranged from \a couple of minutes\ to \less than a half hour,\ when in actLiality, it was much longer. Ray then told a story which included phrases meant to gain one final response from the participants before they were completed conscious again. Ray said that the beauty of hyp- notism is that he could \perform the same show night after night, and the show would never con- tain the same results twice.\ While his goal is to play in ven- ues such as those in Las Vegas, he has been doing well locally. This year, he has already equaled his income from last year. The well-attended show drew several compliments from the au- dience. Comments included, ''I'm glad it wasn't me on stage,\ to \1 can't wait to blackmail my friends with the pictures.\ Most people said that they hope more acts such as Michael Ray's show will find their way onto the Union Campus. If anyone is interested in hiring Ray for any type of event, or if you would I ike to purchase avid- eotape of the show last Wednes- day (to complete that blackmail- ing of your friends), contact fresh- men representatives Michael Winn, Greg Auerbach, and Andy Markowski, who were respon- sible for bringing Ray to Uni()n

Fitz Hugh Ludlow Rocked Those Who Attended by Con or McKenzie Staff Editor Hard-core in the morning- perhaps not the natural way to open up the Fitz Hugh Lttdlow celebration this past Sunday, but those who attended received it with enthusiasm. Checksix, a Union\based band, played what wiH unfortunatelybe one their last perfor- rapper thrown in (Fatty B)~ Belizbeha plays their own style of music, combining elements of Jazz, Hip-Hip, Soul, and House. Belizbeha is unmistakably a dance band-· an infectious one at that-but the size Gf the crowd and the time prevented any wide- spread dancing until the encl. De- spite the lack of dancing, the crowd was quite enthusiastic, female singers, and some that combined all these elements. 1'hotJgh some were enamored with the singers, many seemed to be particularly thrilled with Fatty B. 'The world needs more people like Fatty B\ said Pete Sorenson. ''Fatty His the man.\ Continued Arya Chowdhury, \His rhymes were fluid and clever, and his girth alone would have intimidated The Notori- mances with the re• · turn of their singer and now ex-student Larry Golden.

By three o'clock, Belizbeha was on stage underneath wann sunshine and a clear sky. Origi- nally from Bmlington, Vennont, Belizbeha has gained success around the country and in Europe. They might best be described as 1------------~-------------l a cross between The Brand New Multicultural Advisory Group Heavies and Jamiroquai with a some of them choosing to move lawn seats in front of the stage. Of those who were there, it seemed they were .loved nearly unanimously. Although Union students typi- cally need to know by heart the words of the songs being played in order to give any response, this largely unknown band received unprecedented support. Said Douglas Tanner. \I'd never se.en them before, but they were sick as hell.\ Throughout their set, Belizbeha alternated the style Gftheir songs~ some more hip-hop, some more jazz, some with Fatty B on the mic, some with their two lovely turn, the small crowd responded by bursting into dance. Enough respect cannot be given to Belizbeha for inspiring 50 sleepy, hung-over, work-plagued, Union students to dance. When the en- core was finished, dozens of the fans immediately headed to sign theinnailing list. If the response given by this small crowd is at all indicative of the smdent body in general, then given. the right set- ting and a big crowd, Belizbeha could theoretically dance half the student body into exhaustion. As Rich ApostolGu put it, .. I really don't see how anyone couldn't like Belizbeha,\ (even Union stu- dents). Tlujfuiticultura/Advisory Group, established in 1993 by President Roger H.

On May 5, Cindy Schulte, Supervising C()ln- munity Health nurse at Schenectady County Health Ser- vices (SCPHS), headed the skin testing of those students who were contacted by mail. There were 148 people in the group to be screened, but Schulte said that 30 of those students did not reply or show up for the test. The SCPHS has been on cam- pus twice since the original test- ing date and plan on sending an- other reminder to those 30 people. The second letter will inform people that on May 19, at the SCPHS, on 600 Franklin Street there will testing all day. \We want to reassure students that we're following up even if they don't reply at first.\ From the information gathered from those who were tested the SCPHS said \the results, which are still coming in, show a group of people reacted to the Tubercu- losis skin test because they had received a vaccine for TB.\ Ac- cording to Schulte, the anti- Tu- berculin immunization called BCG was given to that particular group of students who are not from the United States. The vac- cine is not offered here. There were also four other people whGse tests were determined positive. HGwever, this means that they have the Tuberculosis virus but not the actual disease. Schulte emphasized that they are not con- tagious, but are still being treated with the proper medications. The coalesced efforts of Union's health services and the SCPHS will continue through July, when they will conduct a baseline test as a follow up to all those who were originally tested. The twelve week interval is the amount of time it may take for Tuberculosis to be exposed in the body'ssystem. TheJulytestswill make sure that all core group tested students were not exposed. Although school will not be in session, reminders will be sent \literally around the world,\ Schulte said. This later test date is the fonnalized hospitalization date of the patient. \This is an epidemnlogy,\ Schulte said, which is the means by which a disease is investigated and the procedure of contacting various individuals. Health ser- vices and the SCPHS said that based on the results in the core group, there is no reason to test any other students on campus. The Tuberculosis infected stu- dent is still hospitalized and pend- ing discharge. \We as nurses and the health department will con- tim.Ie to monitor the health of the patient even after his discharge and until he is fully recovered.\ The SCPHS was adamant about assuring students and the commu- nity that there are no health risks present and that all related cases are being closely watched. \We don't just let.the ball drop,\ Schulte said, \we'll keep people updated and make sure everyone is safe and aware of the circum- stances at all times.\ e il b t r I

Future Site of the Union Crew Boathouse Still in Question by Aileen Quigley News Editor Though Union's Crew team will finally receive varsity status next Fall, there are doubts as to whether or not their long awaited boathouse will accompany them. The need for their own facility be- came evident when space at the Aqueduct Rowing Club was se- verely reduced. Four years ago, there were abo.ut 65 rowers from local high schaols, but as that number expanded to over 400; Union knew that they had to look elsewhere. · One ofthe first options consid- ered was in Schenectady, located in the Stockade. President Hull became aware of this space through his involvement in Schenectady 2000, an organiza- tion that seeks an active role in improving the city. However, the proposed site for the boat house was classified as \city park land,\ which could only be sold to the college through an \alienation process\ in the State Legislature. This process, completed as of last summer, now put the land offi- cially on the market for roughly $45,000, according · to Joe Mammola. However, Hull was only willing to pay for1~atspace ifthe city was willing to commit to improving and maintaining the property. According to Hull, meeting the fair market value was not unrea- sonable, though he stated that there were obstacles fhan mon- etary .issue in the way ofconstruc- tion. HuH stipulated that the col- lege would agree to build on this cite if the city provided adequate lighting and maintained: the gen: eral grounds ... 1 won't put a $400,000 investment,\' he stated vehemently, \behind anunattrac- tive area that is unpavecl, u.nlit and unclean.\ Additional drawbacks to the Stockade propo.sal, Mammola informed The C oncordiensis, include the \tight relationship\ of a swimming pool located next to the site. The close proximity ofthe two I imits acces- sibility and complicates parking, though there would be adequate room forthe team's b()ats to ma- neuver around the waterfront. In spite of these complications, the benefits of utilizinl) this site as Union Crew's new base of op- erations present just as convinc- ing an argument. It is c1ose to the campus, and Mammola described ''In Your Face'! Theatre by Emily Schwartz Staff Writer In their style of wacky perfor- mances and nights of scenes, last weekend the Mountebanks pre- sented \A Night ofln Your Face Theatre,\ containing three scenes directed and performed by Mountebanks members. The first scene, \The Interro- gation of Clevinger\ was an ad- aptation from Joseph Heller's novel, Catch-22, directed by Alex Beckers. It starred Eric Wisotzky as the Colonel, Josh Chaplin as Metcalf, Lori Greene as Popinjay and Dan Brennan as Clevinger. The scene was the interrogation of a soldier accused with a crime. By means of confusing tactics, and much of the time clearly not making sense, the Colonel finds Clevinger guilty. Clevinger is guilty because, as the Colonel states, \If you hadn't been guilty you wouldn't have been accused. Therefore, it is our patriotic duty to find you guilty.\ Perhaps a mockery of the military justice system, the scene was very hu- morous and well presented. The second scene, from Harold Pinter's \the Birthday Party,\ was directed by Emily Schwartz and starred Eric Wisotzky as Goldberg, Dan Brennan as McCann, Sang Yun as Petey and Josh Chaplin as Stanley. In this scene, Goldberg and McCann are visitors at the boarding house where Stanley is currently resid- ing. It is Stanley's birthday and the owners ofthe boarding house are throwing a party in his honor. Before the party, however, Goldberg and McCann jnterro- . gate Stanley to the point of insan- . ity, asking him strange questions like \'why did the chicken cross the road?\ and \is the 11umber 846 possible or necessary?\ The scene is almost dizzying and like much of Pinter's. worlc, is not meant to be understood. Despite this, the scene was well done. The third scene, a one act play called\F.M. was directed by Morgan Hargrove and starred Gabriella Dory as Constance Lindell, Kim Rohback as Suzanne . Lachette, Allison Evans as May Ford, and Morgan Hargrove as Buford Bullough. The play takes place in a creative writing class in a small college in the south. During the course of the class, the students read their manuscripts and take offense at the actions of Mr. Bullough, whose writing does not agree with the standards that the southern women expect. Af- ter Ms. Lachette and Ms. Ford · storm out of the classmom, Mr. Bullough continues to read for Ms. Lindell, the professor, from his novel about a love affair with his mother the morning after her funeral. The scene, while of a bit of a different nature than the first two, was nonetheless captivating and well perfonned. The \Night of In Your Face · Theatre\ was the fourth in a line of similar Mountebanks' nights of scenes. These nights of scenes are presented in order to allow Moun- tebanks members and other stu- dents to act in or direct scenes that they choose, and to provide a night of free theatre to the cam- pus community. the Stockade as \a wonderful area.\ Hull also confirmed that theresidents oftheneighborhood were very supportive ofUnion 's effortto build near the waterfront. In fact, Mammola feels that the Stockade has the potential to cre- ate an atmosphere of a commu- nity focus on crew, stemming from the site being cJosely situ- ated to the Aqueduct Rowing Club. Aqueduct is presently used by over 400high school students, and Union's presence nearby could enge11der a sense ofsolidar- .ity for the sp()ft, which is becom- ing more a11d more popular. Nevertheless, despite the con- venient location of the site and what Mammola cites as an eager- ness of the reo liege to share in a positive, cooperative effort with the city, HuU wanted to ensure that the area would be kept in the best possible condition both for the safety of the team members and the welfare of the equipment. On February 7, Hull sent a letter to Schenectady Mayor Jurcynzski reiterating Union's need for a contract that would commit the city to improving and maintain- ing the Stockade site should the college decide to build there. He also stated that Union would have to explore other options unless they agreed to \resolve these is- ·sues\ and sign a contract by the end of March. As of two weeks ago, that exploration has begun. Niskyuna and Scotia were inves- tigated as two viable contenders. Along with President Hull, the crew team's Head Coach Tom White and captains Nick Papanickolas (men's team), Sue Zelnick, and Molly Shaner (nov- ice women) visited each of the sites on Monday, May 5. These two areas were about 10;.15 min- utes farther than the Stockade, though they were more private and could accommodate more parking. ln a comparison of the locations, Mammola felt \'better about the boathouse having its own integrity,\ as opposed to hav- ing it placed in a more space-re- stricted spot. White feels that ap- proaching each site as a competi- tive option is a necessary step ~ince \the clock has not stopped ticking\ on the project's Falll997 completion goal. Another press- ing concern is the team's present state of practice space and stor- age facilities. Over $75,000 worth of equipment is being exposed to the elements and consequently depreciating with each passing day. The boats are outside; strapped down to wooden sup- ports next to the rented airplane hanger that houses the three sets of oars. White emphasized it is not only not in compl<iance with United States Rowing Associa- tion requirements, but it is not safe. It is impossible to secure the safety of the supplies, which con- tributes to the urgency of the need for a permanent facility. Hull es- timates that actual construction should take about two to three months, so the target date is still feasible. Although the transition period between leaving Aqueduct and getting the boathouse of our own has seemed extensive, to say the least, wheels appear to be mov- ing forward on this project. As of last Monday, the City Council has committed $84,000 to begin the refurbishing ofthe Stockade site. However, negotiations still have to take place before Schenectady will commit future funds toward the area's maintenance. At any rate, skeptics believe that this. is yet another speed bump in the road of Schenectady-Union legal processes, though the relationship may finally be headed for smoother ground. Students to Study Relationships Between Engineering and Social Sciences of Brazil by ,\ileen Quigley News Editor Applicaticms are being now being accepted for Union's new- est tenns abroad program to Bra- zil. For three weeks during next winter break, ten students will be studying the role of engineering on the sociology of Sao Paulo, Brazil. These select few wi'll re- ceive one course credit and work hands-on in the community to explore how water resources has effected the people and the economy. Class for the \Brazil Project\ will begin on November 30 and run untl December 21. It will be registered as engineering credit on student transcripts, though it will be tailored toword non-ma- jors with a strong emphasis on the anthropology and socio-econom- ics of the country's culture. Par- ticipants will get an opportunity to witness how water resources have shaped the environment and thepeoplelivingwithin. Some of the topics covered will be an ex- amination ofhow problems such as industrial pollution and inad- equate water transportation in slums have contributed to un- equal distribution of wealth a11d resources. On May 12, Eduardo do Val described of the role of engineer- ing in Brazil and the effects ofthis infrastructure on the social economy. He emphasized that this is a national issue in Brazil, and that running water as a power source and for consumption must be carefully allocated. Do Val stated that, even though the coun- try has made significant improve- ments in recent years in its legis- lation, there is still large scale pollution being \thrown\ by huge pipes into the ocean. In addition, pipes carrying water for con- sumption to large cities are some- times illegally tapped, yielding a Joss of about 20%. These are acts of desperation since, in certain areas, sewage is left to run down the street like rainwater. Engineering has, in recent years, become a veritable force in using regions such as the fertile Rio del Plata to bring such impov- erished areas much-needed run- ning water. Do Val explained that \we are transforming our slums into residential areas ... by not moving the popultion but by im- proving the environment.\ This winter, Union students will get their chance to see this transfor- mation as it is happening. Engineering students would be able to use this as an opportunity to lighten up their course load by fulfiHing one credit. In additio to studying the water system o the country, Professor G a! pointed out how they could inves tigate the effect of constant flue tuating of the dollar's value o budget for building project. Pro fessor Huggins added that thos students interested in the trip' social science aspect would als see how the constuction ofhouse in slums and in the city is Iinke to the economy, which ties in t the role of the water systems i that community. All students par ticipa1ing will be required to do final project, which could be term paper, a photojoumalisti essay, or any combination th two. Projects are to be presente at NCUR or Steinmetz, serving a continuum of the knowledg gained in Brazil. In addition, ther will be cultural preparation ses sions in the Fa11 to get student acclamiated as to what the should expect during their stay: Finally, to conclude the experi ence, there will be a series oflec tures in the Winter term. Interested students should con tact Professor Martha Huggin (sociology), Professor Sno (civil engineering) or Professo Thomas (terms abroad) as soo as possible. Applications are du atthebeginningofnextweek,an ten students will be acceped.

Also, University at Albany stu- dents started a petition and Administration Wields Power in Coffeehouse Decision Both Sides Admit Mistakes but Decision Will Stand by Bhavani Meduri Staff Writer The decision to allow Tri-Delta to occupy the first floor of Raymond North has been unfa- vorably received by many stu- dents on campus. It has especially been disagreeable to The Society, a theme house that occupies the restofthe building in conjunction with the Coffeehouse.ln a letter aimed to all concerned persons, Conor McKenzie, president of The Society, reviewed the facts leading up to the decision. Although the members of the Society were originally granted the entire building, they lost the fir.st floor because they were un- able to come up with enough people to fill all of the dorm rooms by the April 15 deadline. However, they assert that they were assuted by Admissions that a Greek }louse would not be given the' floor due to what the Society felt would be a \conflict ofinterest. 11 They were told that the most probable course of action would be to offer the floor to indepen- dent students on the day of lot- tery. Yet when The Society showed up on the night of block lottery with enough signed con- tracts to fill the rest of the house, they were told by Dean Williams dence Life treated Tri-Delta with favoritism because they -were of- fered opportunities that were maded unavailable to any other group or individual except for the Tree House which is also theme house. ... the floor was never open to being occupied by inde- pendent students during the lottery. that they, had missed their chance. It was too late for the Society because Dean Williams had al- ready called Tri-Delta earlier that day and asked its president, Jess Clement, if she could find sixteen sisters to fill the space in Raymond North. Thus the floor was never open to being occupied by independent students during the lottery. The Society feels that Resi- Neither Tri-Delta nor the Tree House was awarded space by SAC which is an organization that is responsible for alloting hous- ing to special interest groups. Thus the Society feels tllat both Dean Alford and Dean Williams circumvented school p()licies in order to accomodate tl!ese two groups. Although Dean AlfQrd con- cedes that such actions to()k place, he does not believe that the deci- sions were unfair He feels that Residence Life was under the obligation of finding a group of students that would completely fill the remaining spaces. He fur'- ther claimed that he knew many students would not choose to 1 ive so far up campus if the floor had been offered during the lottery . The Society contends that they have a list of 17 students who would say otherwise. Currently, there ate over a dozen students who have not been accomodated in on-catnpus hous- ing. And under the assumption that they would get receive hous- ing through the Society, they have missed their lottery. The Society does not want to turn these events into a Greek vs. Theme House issue. They believe the administration is at fault for offering the floor to both the Tree House and Tri-Delta without con~ sidering any other Union stu- dents. McKenzie stated in his let- ter that he hoped that each of their situations could be resolved in a way that is favorable to both groups. collected 300 names to en- force John's resignation. John pleaded guilty to both her DWI and her blood alcohol level of 0.014 per- cent. Although she apolo- gized and paid a $300 fine, attended a drunken driving class and a victim impact panel, and had her license suspended for 90 days, she still would not resign. Many of her supporters are con- cerned because they know she is completely in the wrong.

N ational~News The itewater Saga Continues by Suzanne Dougberty Natio11al News Editor The tangled Whitewater web further weaves its way through the federal govern- ment as the White House submits a petition to the Supreme Court. On May 2 the United States Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled against the White House in a case that re- quired Hillary Clinton to tum over the notes taken at a meeting between Mrs. Clinton and government attorneys about the Whitewater probe. The federal court ruled that the lawyer was a gov- ernment official, not the First Lady's private attorney and thus immune from at- torney-client privilege. The White House has since filed a petition asking the United States Supreme Court to overturn the federal appeals court ruling. Independent counsel Ken- neth Starr requested the notes almost a year ago for the Whitewater grand jury in Little Rock, Arkansas. Starr is conducting a wide- spread investigation of evi- dence relating to possible wrongdoing in Whitewater. He claims that Mrs. Clinton is a \central figure\ in the case and all documents rel- evant to her actions are im- perative to his ongoing in- vestigation. These notes that are so heavily in demand summa- rize two conversations held by Mrs. Clinton and a team of government attorneys and private lawy-ers. Former White House deputy counsel J:ane Sherburne was briefed by Mrs. Clinton on the six hours of her testimony upon return to the White House. The first conversa- tion was held on July 11, 1995 and the second was held on January 26, 1996 during a break in grand jury hearings. The White House, how~ ever, has refused to give the notes to Starr claiming that they are confidential docu- ments that are protected by nly attorney-client privilege. Starr accused the White House of impeding the probe by relinquishing the notes. White House special coun- sel Lanny Davis said th.at Starr's claim is \nonsense\ and. called his move to un- cover the notes \a fishing ex- pedition.\ The White House has in- troduced the slippery-slope claim. They have argued that if these notes are put into the hands of the grand jury than \the next step would be for the grand jury to require the White House counsel or other government attorneys to testify about conversations with the presi- dent or other government n COME ITO MOTO PHOTO FOR SUPER SAVINGSI ' lcllenlclldy 1041 11111 Street 882·6778 ONE HOUR ( MOTOI'HOTO officials concerning the legal advice they have given and the information they have gailiered in their internal in- vestigations.\ Sta·rr feels that the Clintons are \duty-bound\ to give the notes to the in- vestigation. He believes that \to allow any part of the fed- eral government to use its in- house attorneys as a shield againstthe production of in- fomlation relevant to a fed- eral criminal investigation would represent a gross mis- use of public assets.\ The White House petition states, however, that the White House counsel's office was necessary part of the defense team. and should be pro- tected.

F~ustrated With an Irresponsible Admi~stration by Conor McKenzie StafjWrlt~r Having spent the better part of last week disputing .. the administration's decision to :move Tri-Delt oQto the first floor of the Coffeehouse; I have to admit that l have little :time or energy left to continue arguing their decision.

By the time of my culminating meeting with P'resident ·HuH, Dean Alford and Williams had both admitted in one way or an- other that policy was not followed •' by offeting the first floor exclu- sively to Tri-Delt.

So, not only is this pro- cess unfair, but it is inconsi~ten~ in that it anly actually requires houses to maintain complete oc- cupancy in the fall. Communication Amongst theDean.s: Throughout my individual meetings with Dean Alford and Dean Will'iams, I was continually ~hocked by the apparent lack of communication between them. When Dean Alford was pressed with a tough question, he would frequently say thathedid not have the answer, and Dean Williams was the person we should ask. Interestingly, Dean Will'iams con- sistently refused to speak with us individually, because she claimed · that she made all her decisions collaboratively with Dean Alford. Though much of this \ignorance\ and \lack of communication\ was pr~bably merely claimed igno- rance-claimed as a way of avoiding personal responsibility, the fact remains that they obvi- ously have next to no idea what the other is doing or saying. Policy on Housing Privileges: Though this is the most impor- tantand disturbing of my points, it can be said in very few words. Are Residence-Life and the SAC the only bodies with authority to distribute college-owned hous- ing? Or , as is apparently the case, is the Dean's Office a third group that has this power. The answer to this question should be simple; ifthey are the third group with power to grant housing privi- leges, th~n this should be made public so thatall interested gro1.1ps have the opportunity to apply for housing from the Dean's Office. If the Dean's Office should not, in fact, be making these decisions, then they should first apologize for making a mistake in this case, and second, commit to not mak- ing this type ofdecisionagain. As a result of this complicated andtax.ing \scandal\ I have been left disenchanted with Union's administration. I have learned that even when students have le- gitimate arguments, and are able to present them; the administra- tion has no ebligation to act on them. , Currently, thepowerofthe stu- dents is puzzlingly inferior to that oftheadministration. Who is this school here for? Who is the ma- jority? Who has the power? (ide- ally, the answer here should be the students, and not the administra- tion) What is the point in having theSAC (a committee where the administration has \generously\ allowed students to have the ma- jority) when it can be circum- vented, at will, by the administra- tion? Ifthe administration is not bound by policy, and bears no re- sponsibilitY. to correct for its m is- takes, then howcan it pretend to tare about the needs of its stu- dents. Get a \D\'.

Ql(. TRI·SH,WE ONL'Y_t.JEED HALF.ACUP OF COFFEE, Way Beyond What We Were By Jared Rh:~llman Staj[Carto-onist Dan Andelman's recent rum- blings about \alumni luggage\ have spawned several ideas in my head about luggage itself: or more specifically, baggage. There's a lot of talk about emotional bag- gage, and I never quite under- stood tlle concept until this year. -..¥, ·,( ' You might say I had what alco- holics call a moment of clarity. For me, this moment entailed a realization of just how much bag- gage we create andthen tote along with us in our lives. · I suppose my impending, or should I say looming, graduation may have brought this realization on, and why not? This will probably be the last regular time shift in my life-at least for some time. But I digress, back to baggage. Actu- ally, there's more to it than just Danny's comment; I suppose I owe a little to Randy Pellish's speech at the Senior \Wine\ and Cheese reception, as well (by the way, thanks for the free cheese, Union). Randy provided us se- niors with a lovely retrospective moment when he asked us to re- member that first term of our freshman year. And I did. You see, that first term here was probably thebesttime of my life. When I left high sclmol I relished the fact that I was leaving every- one in my town, moving away for four years to someplace where no one knew me (well, except my brotller, but you get the idea) nor me them. No one knew I liked to draw,. that 1 W2;S at best a medio- cre athlete, that I'd had three back operations before the age of six- teen, or that I had stuttered since the age of seven and had endured ten years of teasing. It was a fresh start, a second chance. For three months we freshmen looked at each other without seeing Greek I etters emblazoned on each other's foreheads (or in J:..jj.fl.' s or · :E8T's case, on their butts), nor did we see the drunken hook-ups, the arguments, the breakups, the sport's losses, the scandals, nor the lies. Instead, we looked at each other as merely human be- ings, who perHaps seemed unfa- miliar and odd( as we were still toting· some prejudices as bag- gage), but ultimately as other in- coming Union students like our- selves. Then came four years of expe- riences. Tennysmfs Ulysses la- n'lents \I am a part of all that I have met,\ but I think that seems too egotistical. He may better have served himself by realizing that all he has met was a part of him-each experience, each mo- ment is collected and stored within us, creates us and recreates us. Thus, th.at baggage lives within. When I look back at my four years at Union I cannot pos- sibly begin to understand how each of my experiences has changed me, but I would be fool- ish not to realize that they had. To me the saddest part is that much of this so-called emotional baggage keeps me from resolv- ing the many conflicts I created. And, then, I guess I have not grown all that much. How many of our \freshmen friends\ do we no longer talk to, spend time with? Why is this? Petty argu- ments and silly lies? Foolish lines drawn by \coolness\? Funny, I thought all college would be like that first term, without the high school cliques I hated so much. But it is, in fact, far worse. More baggage less living. So I suppose the question is just how heavy do we let our baggage become, or better still, can we empty those suitcases and live· free? Pretty philosophical questions, there, I · apologize. But sooner.or later we'll all come to a point where we have to look back and won- der why we are wasting so much effort carrying along our hatreds and fears. As for me, I just want my college to be a nice place, to graduate on time, and stop wor- rying so much. Will I? Probably not. But I can have that last beer, toast to ole Union, the college on the hill, and move on to the next great experience with a whole new set of luggage to fill. Questions, comments? You've been pretty quiet up to this point, so I won't e.xpect any great change. Still, I can be as opti- mistic as the next guy. Drop me a virtual line at ricJimanj@idol. union.edu.

'ilil~e illoHJ:nt'ttil'usis · May 15, 1997 · Page 12_ - .· · -Features Not-So-Quiet Before the .Storm by Mithelle Tham Featllres Editor I used to live in apetite, button of a house on Rock Drive in Val- ley Cottage. Somewhere in the summer before fifth grade, J left that foundation of my childhood and moved into a crisp, white colonial in New City. 27 Prides Cro.ssing, that's my address, that's my home. But moving into that 'scary, open house was not such a thrill when I first got there. Leaving familiarity and faHing into new experience ]eft me uncertain and afraid. I crept into my new home on a humid, sticky day in Jtdy. The firstthing I noticed was how big the place was, how far away my parents' room would now be from 'my own, how frightening the floors arid waUs looked. Ev- erythingwas so bare .. As night fell, I tried to sleep amic;lsttheuncomfortable glare of unfamiliar shadows. And then in myhai:eofsleep and fear, asifto make things worse, came rolling sounds and bursting light. A thun- . derstorm was fighting in the sky, and I was not -exactly thrilled. Lying on a mattress that had not even been placed on a bed be- cause the movers had to come back with itthenextday,myheart was racing and my limbs were squirming despite my attempts at some sort of control over them. I felt alone, cold, petrified .. And that is how I still react to- day. When I see the sky afire and hear the whip of crackling thun- der I can't help but spin back to that first-:summer night in a strange place. J. still feel my heart race and my body start to quiver. Maybe a little bit less now that I've grown older, but my initial reaction is still the same and just as harsh. People have always tried to help me get past the fear. They tell me that the gods are bowling, or the clouds arejqstin a fight, or the heavens are at war, These little analogies never seemed to coma fort me, they just made me more upset, because why on earth would the gods be bowling when they had so many other responsi- bilities? And as for people who said that it was just the sky cry- ing, I could not help but feel sad that the sky had to cry for our amusement. It's funny, though, how some childhood fears never leave some people. As for the majority of my friends here ... thunderstorms are hardly a source of stress or un- rest. In fact, most people love them and actually like watching the sky tom apart from their front steps. l do .see some sense of beauty in tll~ ;mesh of colors that attack the sky in a sudden surge, hut the dark before the stor.m frightens me still. Watching the cloudsbleedto black and the .light slowly swallowed hy the dark leaves me shaking.

And yes, I suppose I'll have to deal with it one day, but for now it suits me just fine. The Most Unlikely Accessories by Jeffery Druzba Staff Writer It's springterm when all iliose bright new colors and patterns of the rainbow reveal themselves in everybody's wardrobes. I've no- ·ticed that a lot of Union students have a well formulated fashion sense. In fact, one's sense of style is heightened at a school like ours. Some people take fashion a little too far: Sometimes, the best ac,.. cessories aren't things· you can wear. A lot of Union College stu- dents accessorize for life. One surefire style tip isto walk around everywhere on campus with a puppy on a leash. Dogs, and especially puppies, are an ef- fective way of completing any ensemble and the compliments you'll get are well worth the cost of maintaining that dog. Every- where someone goes with a puppy, they're .stopped and the puppy, an obvious extension of its owner's appearance, is compli- mented for being. so cute and beautiful. For some people, their full grown dogs are like a substitute for a trademark car, as recogniz- abieas·theGeneralLee. \Johnny must be here. That's 'his black. lab.\ By tying a dog near an en- trance to a buildingyou can leave a mark that tells everyone, \l'm in here and I'll be back in a few minutes.\ Dogs are fine if you can own one and you-live off-campus but, what are the rest of Union's stu- dents supposed to accesorize with? We11, if you;re female, there's the option of using each other as accessories. It'sthe big trend with all the lady types to I ink arms and stride all over the place like Laverne and Shirley hitting the big time. The key is to walk around holding hands while swinging them between you and acting like little kids. The sister- hood of women is very fashion- ablethese days. One of the most innovative ac- cessories that I've seen at Union is for people to actually use their- academics·as an accessory. De- pending on what term it is, tak- ing a particular class can be the best statement of sfyle. Every Union student can. tell you that anyone who is anyone takes the Holocaust in the spring term. . Aren't some classes the best way to reveal something about yourself anyway? What better way to attract' a woman than ~o Junior Economics, Managerial Economics, take Gender and Society to show her that::you're down with the worn~ thing? Who could dis• agree that the best way to look 1 ike the troubled thinker would be to take a philosophy or ethics course? Then, when people ask you what y()u'r9 taking this term,. you just say~ \Yeah sometimes my head hurtS because I think too hard aboutt:Jthical problems of the world.\ Ifyou're a member of the Gree~. system, one of the best accesso- ries you can ,;own\ is the pledge. What better way to show those . aroundyou that you've got power around this place? Ordering some pledgearound shows people that \when I speak, people listen.\ Hollow, .temporary authority is truly the definition ofUnion style. Union students are truly scime ofthebestand brightest...when it comes to innovative ways to make their own Impressions on others. I wonderifall that creative energy will be put to good use when Union students join society at large. I can just imagine Elsa Klensch and her world of fashion being grudgingly overthrown by a bunch of 20-sornethings in the next few years to come. · Industrial Economics Majors .

- ' Features 'illlp? <!Inncnroicnsis ~ May 15, 1997 · Page 13 Hey guys, how's itgoing? Af~ ter our brief hiatus last week, we are glad to be back in full effect. If you ask us what we were doing during our little time off, we'll that's getting a little too personal. However, we can say that we had · fun doing it. Jusdtthinkofitas a Iitt;e bit of fiel\d work that was definitely necessary to write this article ... which brings us to our latest concern ... PDA, otherwise known as Pub- lic Display of Affection, defi- nitely exists on this campus. Each and every day we continue to see the same people committing these nefarious acts where they really should not be done. Now,doyou really want to be sitting in some eating area on campus (not to name any specifically) and to look over to yourright only to see two regular suspects all over each other, or God forbid going at it. We mean, can't you guys hold off for like 30 minutes!!! Go back to oneofyoutrooms if you feel out of control. It just seems that PDA has become so prevalent this term. We were just wondering if it had anything to do with the fact that it is spring. We guess it's a time where every- . : body is supposed to be happy. However, it does not make us happy to see couples displaying their great love for each other in pqblic, .. in broad daylight. But hey, we have to leave it up to you on how to act. Just think and maybe less people will stop and stare. Next on discussion, handi- capped parking. Now this does not concern us directly, but dur- ing a routine ATM withdraw! last. week at Fleet Bank, we identified a major problem. Upon arriving at the bank, we narrowly avoided being mauled over by a woman who found it absolutely necessary to park on the sidewalk. Now, there are handicapped spaces all over the place. Not to mention this lady did not have a handicapped license plate ... she only had a permit in her rear view mirror. Can we say slacker, or just a woman who was using some minute excuse so that she would not have to walk the extra few feet? Now, not to give ac'- cessibility to the handicapped is not our point. However, we ex- pected to see a crippled women to exit the vehicle. After all, this woman practically parked inside Bank. Hello, the drive-up window is outside, not inside. Maybe she wasunsU1.7e, but we are still not sure. Our main point is just that people should not take advantage of things in life,' and use them as excuses. This lady could have parked in a regular space and stiJ:l been all right During some other off-campus tesear,ch, we followed this woman to see if she used this penn it as an excuse everywhere that she went. On her next stop, Dunkin' Donuts, there was a lack of spaces. This same woman parked all the way across the street. Isn't thatannoying? But hey,who are we, what can we do? Well, after aU this intensified field work this past week, we would have to say that we are definitely tired. We had to do a lot of research and disguise our- selves as we went behind the scenes to get the most infonna- tion. we hope that we did not hurt anyone's feelings because it's all in good fun. So, Whitney and Cari are signing off, as we leave you with our customary Snaps: \Your mother is like a TV set- ·Jri· anyone can tum her on.\ --TCF Crew ... BYE !.~ Mom Dining Services by Jeffery Druzba Staff Writer I was eating lunch with a friend the other day, looking at people . by the salad bar, when I had a moment of inspiration. I've got an idea for a new kind of dining services at Union College. The idea is simple: First, those financial types • drQp a couple thousand dollars off ofthe cost for Union's board. . Already, you've increased inter- est in the college because it's cheaper to go here and I haven't even rcv~aled my idea yet. My plan would save the college money. Next, you replace the dining service staff with a group of paid mothers. Here's my theory: I am convinced that Union students have too many dining choices. · We have a multitude of options · when we get up there and you can eat as much as you want. I think . it would be better if there were people in Dining Services who only made one meal at a time. You go up to Upperclass and there's a sign there that says, \Tonight's Dinner: Pork Chops, Apple Sauce, Stove Top Stuffing, and Brussel Sprouts.\ That's it, with the exception of an ample vegetarian option. You go up there and you get your meal. No decisions, no students complain- ing that there's no more this or that on the salad bar. What's more, if you ask for more, the people working in Din- ing Services would just give you a simple yes or no and when you asked them why you can't have anymore Stove Top, they would just reply, \Because I said so.\ Wouldn't it be neat if they brought the food out to us? You go to a table and some of these employees bring out bowls and plates offood. Everyone eats fam- ily style. And when you're fin- ished, you leave your stuff there for them to clean up after you. During the time when the em- ployees weren't making the meals~ they could spend their time by making cookies and pies free for the students to take. Heck, why not have a big bell that they ring on top of the col- lege center when food is ready. There could be someone there with a megaphone, yelling out oneofthewindows, \Come'n' get it! Dinner's ready!\ I think that would separate Union from all the other colleges in its league. Creative solutions to modern day college problems- That's what I'm here for.

Bruce Willis is a Han Solo for the 90's? ''The Fifth Element.\ Starring Bruce Willis, GaryOldman, Milia Jovovich, Jan Holm, Luke Perry. Directed by Luc Besson. Rated PG-13, Columbia Pictures. Rating: ** 1/2 (out of four) Some are calling it the Star Wars of the 1990s, but this eclectic jour- ney into one director's \futuristic vision\ is a busy and visually con- fusing $90 million concept. Why are all visions ofthe future so cen- tered on instant gratification? That answer is not revealed here, b11tBruce Willis' apartment, with concealed beds and kitchen ap- pliances which hide military offic- ers from the NYPD Blue, seem to depict living in the 23rd century in NewYorkCity (whereelse?)as a simple as pushing a few buttons. The story's individual plot de- tails-too numerous to describe and many of which are highly in- ventive-still don't explain how Willis, as an ex-military officer, manages to pilot his taxicab fifty stories above the New York streets and yet still have to answer a tele- phone by picking up a receiver. He is out to find the fifth element (earth, fire, wind, and rain being the other four) which, when com- bined with the other elements, will cast out evil from the earth for the next five thousand years. Of course, the uni- versal personification of \good\ is a 5-foot, 9-inch woman of about 20 that is anorexic and completely ignorant of the English language, makingherthoroughly helpless in the comforting arms of Willis. Luckily enough, she can kick butt when it comes to maul- ing bad guy-mercenaries that look like throw-away designs for the guards in Jabba the Hutt's palace. They talk tough, however, and are very mean. But they do go down easily when confronted with a good blaster. Oldman plays a weak villain, as Zorg, the evil mastermind who sets out to find the p.recious stones which contain the ability John McClane in Die Hard; at least he's wearing shoes this time. With so much visual style, this film;is probably more artful than one is lead to believe, and its vi- sion is straight out of a video game.

Holm, as a priest, wants the stones to protect the earth from people like Zorg. Zorg'scharacter is highly ineffective for a number reasons, beginning with the pointless plas- tic casing over his forehead and ending with his Texan accent that accentuates his idiocy. How did such a man come to such power? The Fifth Element owes more inspiration to Stargate than it does Star \The Fifth Element owes more inspiration to Stargate than it does Star Wars .•. \ Wars, per- haps due in part to its opening scene set sions follow. The film's laterdis- traction of comic relief comes in the form ofRuby, a talk-show host who annoys Willis during a cruise he's won and ends up being an accomplice to the hero's saving of the day. Adored by his fans but annoying to the film audience, Ruby's screeching whine and pestering manner make him the perfect character to both hate and laugh at, but Willis finds a use for him as a prop in the killing of the disgusting beasts. His second- ary function is as \luggage boy,\ in the desert and nods to mythical forces guiding the fate ofaH civiHzation. On the other end of the galaxy are a group of earthlings watching a planet expand~ this is the source ofthe \evil which will strikethe earth if the elements are not br:ought together. But just when all the philosophy gets too tire- some, outcomes Willis, spending plenty oftime flying through the air and landing behind exploding bars, performing a number of im- pressive kills video game-style. He's come so far from his da:ys as carrying the stones which will save the universe. When the fate of mankind rests in Arsenio Hall's hands, humans are doomed in- deed.

• ·:· -· • \ • _.< ' .. ,. :. ·(. / . Student Dance and Choreography At Steinmetz byKimRohback Staff Writer On May 9, for the Steinmetz Symposium, the Perfortning Arts Department exhibited a collection of dances, both choreographed and danced by students. Under the sponsorship of Professors Miryam Moutillet and Darlene Meyers, twelve students created their owncostumes, selected their own music, and perfonned their own dances for a packed audi- ence in the Dance Studio of the Arts Building. The program opened with an introduction by Professor Meyers, who announced Carrie Madsen '99 as the recipient oflast year's Edward Villella Fellowship. The award and the generous fund- ing for the event were both do- nated by alumnus Charles Lothridge '44, who was presented with a rose from Madsen to begin the program. In the few years that Meyers has introduced her cho- reographyclass, the program has increased from four participating students to twelve. And the class will hopefully still rouse interest as the large audience on Friday proved thatthe Union community is interested in dance. Kathy McDowell '99 opened the perfonnance with her piece en- titled Promenade. McDowell chose folk music and traditional black;shoes to perform her tradi- tional style dance. . Next Justine Willey '98 performed her piece called A Search for Unity. Justine in- corporated a colorful costume and four flash lights into her dance. Monet War- ren 00 'was next to perfonn· her piece Gestures. The piece was danced to a smooth yet powerful song, by Composer .Kuduz, which was complemented beauti- fully by Monet's bold and graceful choreog- raphy. Sari Levant then performed her piece Untamed Spirit;. which combined the elements of classi:cal ballet and the dynam- ics of modem dance. dreaChristina. &elections ofthe poem about one woman's and the feeling of the music with dance. Her striking orange cos- tume created feelings of suspension in her piece and it greatly comple- mented her original dance. Senior Stephanie Fmchtman danced her piece, Aspiration, as an '~ex.pressive modem bal- let.~· She explained that she had chosen this title for the piece because of her approaching gradu- ation and her own \as- pirations.\ Jennifer Jalcbowski '97, danced her piece Escape, and e:xplained in her intro- duction that performing washer one escape.

Kristen said that SAC got the name based on her own interpretation of the music. Carrie Madsen told the au- dience that she usually likes to dance to classical music but for this Steinmetz, she chose instead something more challe11gi •• g. She chose a more modem Irving Ber- lin piece. \I'm really glad that in- terest in the program has grown so much and that [they 1 had such a great audience\ said Pagano. The final dance was performed by senior Kira Sobczak. Her piece was called Departure. Before her dance she gave a short speech on the dance program at Union and an explanation of the process of choreographing dance. She ex- plained some of the basic ele- ments of choreograph, and how each dancer must consider, lev- els, musicality, space, and many other elements when a piece is created. Sobczak danced her piece as a tribute to her college memo- ries and her departing moments. The successful performance moved the audience through the beauty of the dances and the dedi- cation ofthe perfonners. Theost interesting aspect of the after- noon was the variety of dance and the different levels of the dane- ers. Whale Watch Tests Students' Stomachs By Jill Hirschenfang Contributing Writer On Saturday, May 3, 40 Union College students and faculty set outfor Provincetown~ Cape Cod to experience a whale watch. Al- most everyone on the six hour bus ride dreamt of the whale watch they hoped to soon be on. In their sleep, they smiled as they pictured themselves on a whale watching boat with the sun on their backs and whales breach- ing.around them. But at 2 PM, as the bus pulled into Provincetown, the heard an omi- nous weather forecast of 100% chance of rain with possible thun- derstorms,\ sighs were heard across the bus with disappoint- ment, no one expected the whale watch to take place, so everyone was surprised when Professor Butterstein announced that the whale watching company, The Dolphin Fleet, would still take out a boat at2:30 PM. The boat left the wharf and headed out into the ocean at 2:45 PM. Everyonewas so excited that the cold did not seem to matter and almost all of the Union stu- dents opted to stay outside on the deck .. Soon, dolphins were spot- ted and everyone·\oohed\ and \ahhed\ as they watched these animals ride the waves. But this was a whale watch and the boat eventually continued on to the Stellwag en Bank Sanctuary where many whales reside. As the wind and size of the swells increased, the watchers reached the sanctuary and many students began searching for spouts of vapor into the air which is the most common way to spot whales. Eventually; a finback whale appeared and the boat ap- proached this 85 foot ma~mal as it blew a jet of vapor at least 15 feet into the air at a speed of 400 miles per hour. The entire group peered over the edge of the boat to try to get a peakat the whale as its small fin on its back cut in and out ofthewater. Unfortunately, hardly anyone was able to get a good view ofthe whale because the strong sevenieen foot swells quickly threw tltem if they were not holding 011 ,to the railings for dear life. F orthenext45 minutes, the ina- rine biologist on board informed the crowd oftllnee other finback whales \insight\' but only brief glimpses of tbe:se whales were actually seen llecause everyone was preoccu~ied with nature's rollercoaster. \T:he swells became so large that the front of the boat would practicall~ dip into the wa- ter as it descelllded down the surges. Almost the entire boat was drenche<l from head to toe with ocean water as each indi- vidual screamed with either laugh- ter or seasickne:;s. As the win<! increased to forty- five miles per llour, the captain of the boat decid.ed to head in early since it would iake longer then usual to get back to land. The captain then ordered everyone to go inside the boat for the trip home. As the speed of the boat increased the captain's warning was soon understood. Previ- ously, the boat had somewhat gracefully climbed and descended the swells, but now with the in- creasing speed of the boat all gracefulness was eliminated. The ro llercoaster at Riverside Park in Massachusetts lasts approxi- mately 60 seconds, unfortunately for the people on board last week's 2:30PM whale watch, the rollercoaster lasted an hour and a half. As every individual's face turned green, the boat threw them left and right, forward and back- ward. Each person clenched onto the boat trying to steady them- selves while at least ninety per- cent of the people on board also grasped a pi astic bag for their sea- sickness. Finally, at 6 PM, the Dolphin Fleet made it back to Provincetown, Cape Cod's wharf. As each person stepped back onto land they moaned a sigh of relief After a hot shower and per- haps a nap back at the hotel ev- eryone was recovered and headed out into central Provincetown to refill their stomachs with a hardy ocean-side meal. The following morning, the Union College students and fac- ulty rode the bus to Boston where they would spend the afternoon. With laughter, everyone remi- nisced about the events of the whale watch that each person swore they would never forget. Although almost everyone's stomach churned on the May third whale watch it did not effect the future plans of the Union stu- dents and faculty to attend the Biology Club event in future years. The weekend was definitely a time to remember and even with the \bumpy ride,\ everyone en- joyed the weekend. Dutch. Hollow Special Purchase 2 Fajita Wraps and receive a free 22 oz. soda.

After los- ing to Wi II iams the team managed to pull itself back together to de- feat Hartwick in their last match of the season. The team was not too disappointed with the loss to Williams, considering the Ephmen are ranked number one in New England, and top four overall in the nation. against Hart\Wicl<'s number two seed. Berger had no problem in his match, winning by the score of6-3, 6-0 U11ion won the match ,, 6-1, endingtJ1e season strong. Looking back, the Union Dutchmen had. a very interesting season. C<Jach Scanlon com- mented, ''It was a strange season, very few dos-e matches.

Freshman Cassie Lawton won the Terri L::ynch-Jackie Havercamp Memorial Award, presented to the freshman female student-athlete wh() has shown desire, dedication, sportsmanship, and inspirational lteadership on the field of competition as well as in her daily life. Lawton was Union's top singles tennis player last fall and was a starting out- fielder and first baseman for the softball team this spring. Junior David Kl.ine won the Fred W. Bruhn A ward, presented to the member of the varsity base- ball team who has made the great- est contribution in tenns of inspi- rational leadership, sportsman- ship, te11m and college loyalty, and service as a player. SeniorGreg Walters won the Bryan T. Bakker Memorial Award,presented annually to the member <lfthe men\ s soccer team who disJJlays the highest ideals of sportsmanship and leadership on and off the field. On May 6, the team traveled .to Williams in search of pulling off the biggest upset in Union College's history for any sport. Williams, being ranked number one in New England, was very confident going into the match. The Dutchmen, realizing the numbers were stacked against them, gave it their all, but came up empty. All the matches went in Williams' favor. Union'snum- ber one seed Jared Shiekh came closest to victory with a 4-6, 4-6 loss to Williams' number one seed Keith Tonkin.

A~ a team, the Dutcl!men role this season, as many people thought the Dutchmen would be able to beat last season's record- tying win total (16)this year. As by Jason Everett Staff Writer Although the Union men's and women· s track and field teams have concluded their 1997 cam- paign, there is already an optimis: tic enthusiasm for next year's in- door and outdoor seasons. Cre- ating such ebullience is the num- ber of returning talented under- classmen and seasoned veterans. Despite these athletes, the Union squad will look to minimize the effects of graduating several key athletes this year. The men (as difficult as 1t will be) will look to fill the holes cre- ated by the loss of super-sprinter Dave Riggi, sprinter/jumper Ja- son Jennings, thrower Jon Gainor, and mid-distance star Nick Conway. The women will look to re- bound frotn the loss of thrower Michelle Woodward. Although there is optimism for next year, it is time to take a look back at this past season, not yet to season's ahead. Both the men's team and women's team welcomed back runners and.bid temporary fare- wells this past season. The men enthusiastically welcomed back senior Nick Conway and sopho .. more Peter Flynn who were on tenns abroad this past winter, thus 111issing the indoor campaign. The men also welcomed back senior Steve McCann from term abroad, who had a productive sea- son in the distance events, while Conway, and Flynn, despite some rustiness, pulled outa fourth and eighth place finish in the 800m at the state championships. The women bid farewell to In addition to Jamieson, there were many more 'new athletes with the team this season who did not compete during indoor. Sophomore Autumn Renn made her presence known in the long and triple jumps this season. Renn set a school record in the long jump at RPI with a leap of 4.77m. Charity MacManaman also rejoined the team and set a school record in the 2IC steeple- chase .. The women also welcomed Jordanna Mallach wh() became · the first women's pole vaulter in . Union College 'history. In the mid-distance, s<>phomore Katie MacDpwelHortlte women had a good follow-up season af- ter her tremendously successful indoor season. MacDowell set a personal best in the 1500m at Williams with a time of 5:14. MacDowell, looking back at this past season reaped pJ:aise upon the new women's distat1ce coach. MacDowell commented,\! felt I had a successful season due tothe coaching abilities of [new coach] Todd [Donnley].\ In the men's mid-distance, jun- . ior co-captain Jay Goldberg rounded into form by states and ran a 2:03 for the 800m. Sopho- rnore Nate Childs looked sharp as well in his second 800tn race ever at states running a 2:04. The men's team also saw encouraging . signs from the ever improvin~ In the sprints, senior co-captain Dave Riggi was hi-s usual brilliant self finishing in the top half of every race he ran and concluded his final season at Union College by taking third in the lOOm and 200m at.states. In addition Riggi anchored the fourtll place 4x 100 team ofCiark Searle;} esse Prisco, and Jason Jennings. Jerinings and Prisco also had a fine season in the jumps as well with several outstanding efforts. Not to be forgotten is freshman Bryan Roy who finished fotuth in the state in the decathlon anti should be a valuable member of the Union squad for another few years. . In the women sprints, Randi Spiegal had a succ~ssful season in her Union outdoor debut. Also of notice was Emily Beck in the · hurdles and Carrie Cieslowski in . ' the high jump. In tile field for the men, freshman IdrisAbdui-,Aziz had a fine season in the javelin and ran some quick times in the • 200m (23.7 atRPI). Despite the outstanding efforts of Riggi at states, the men were unable to defend their crown in the 3200m relay. The tearrt looks to avenge for this next year in outdoor as well as recapture the 3200m title during indoor which it did not defend til is year due to two members ofthe squad being . abroad.

The first events began on Fri- day with the Varsity Men's four who started the entire regatta with the first heat of the day.

The Varsity Men fared no better this day as they too were bounced in the semi-final round. The Varsity Women (stern to bow: Caroline Nemet, Kenley Smith,.

The men (stern to bow: Steve Eichfeld, Dave Brooks, Tim Lash, Jon Moeller, and cox Tim Losee) finished their season with a strong sixth place in the nation behind Champion SUNY Maritime. The Union rowers this season have pushed the program to new hei·ghts.

Pennsylvania at the Dad Vail Re- gatta (Nationals) The boats, coming off a disap- pointing cancellation of states, were eager to show their stuff against teams from all over the East Coast and Mid-West includ- ing teams from Canada, Seattle. and Texas The first events began on Fri- day with the Varsity Men's four who started the entire regatta with the first heat of the day. Up against th.e likes of NYU. US Merchant Marines, and William & Mary, Union's Varsity four (stern to bow Mike Sherwood, Aaron Reidy, Nick Papanickolas. Rob Davis, and cox Ted Wallace) were able to ease their way into the semi-finals, as the top three of each heat advanced to the fol- lowing round, coming in second in their heat behind a powerful Temple crew. The Varsity Men had set the tone for Union Crew and the Women's Varsity and Novice, and Men's Novice fours continued the push each by tak- ing second in their respective heats to advance to the semi-fi- nals on Saturday. Saturday arrived. The sun re- placed the over cast of the day before and the wind arrived blow- ing in inconsistent directions. making the rowing in some heats tricky. With Saturday also came more nerves and more elimina- tion as the heats would determine the boats left for the finals. later in the day. The Novice Women's four (stem to bow: Molly Shaner. Tara Marcone, Melissa Sullivan, Nael]1mah Tan, and cox Melissa Cook), after being put together the week before Dad Vail, showed a lot of heart, poise. and pride as they raced boats that had rowed together all season long, but unfortunately, this experience was the difference as the women were eliminated from competi- tion. The Varsity Men fared no better this day as they too were bounced in the semi-final round. The Varsity Women (stern to bow: Caro-line Nemet. Kenley Smith, Katie Ott, Susana Ryan, and cox Katie Murray) came within inches of advancing, as they missed qualifying for the fi- nals by two sec·onds Tl1e only boat left was the Men's Novice four who remarkably moved into the final round after rowing in a four for the first time two days prior. The men (stern to bow: Steve Eichfeld, Dave Brooks. Tim Lash, Jon Moeller, and cox Tim Losee) finished their season with a strong sixth place in the nation behind Champion SUNY Maritime. The Union rowers this season have pushed the program to new heights. The intensity, heart, pride, consistency, and motiva- tion has created a level of com- petitiveness that allowed this team to accomplish much more than was expected. In addition, it sets a strong basis for the team enter- ing its first year of Varsity, July I. Lastly, to Caroline Nemet and Katie Murray, the two seniors, your leadership and desire to be the best has been a great example for all of us and your presence next year will be sorely missed. Good luck in the future - the Union Crew Team. I· ' I, I I . il ~ .

Levin spent twelve years researching Hopper's biography, and her talk thus concerned Hopper's life story as well as his art. \One of the biggest revelations I encoun- tered while researching him was how his life intersected with his art,\ she said. Edward Hopper, an American landscape and city-scape painter, was born in 1882. His work was recognized largely for the way in which it expressed the loneli- ness and vacuity of various en- vironments. Some of his most famous pieces include Night Hawk's ( 1942), Hotel Room ( 1931 ), Office at Night ( 1940), and A Woman in the Sun ( 1961 ). Hopper believe that an artist \changed little from birth to death,\ Levin said. \What he once is he always is,\ he had once said. So, Levin explained, it was important to return to an artist's background in order to understand him. Hopper's per- sonality,accordingto Levin, was an accurate reflection of the mood of many ofhis paintings. He was a self-described intro- vert, and had great difficulty expressing his emotions. He was physically outstanding, lanky and six feet five inches taU. \One ofthe ways he communicated,\ Levin said, \was through his caricatures.

By rolling this in his hand, the blood flows faster by contracting and releasing muscles in the arm. Once the donor is comfortable, the nurse inserts the needle in a vein. For the next six to ten min- utes, the donor rolls the bike handle and.theblood is collected.

Here, the students are reminqed not to do any heavy lift- .ing for the next five hours, and to increase their fluid intake for the two days to follow. Overall, the Red Cross and the organizers ofthis drive were very pleased with the turnout. Sarah Moss, a member of Tri-Delta, stated that the original goal was 50 donors. This number was based on the small attendance at _previous drives, but after 76 people had registered within two days, it became clear that the cam- pus community was enthusiastic about taking part. By the end of the registration period, Dave Meronsaid that 1 09 people had signed up, and over 80 people did actually sllow up, but by the end of the da:y there was not enough time and beds to ac- commodate them all. Kappa Sigma brother Sibu Janardhanan felt that the blood drive was \excellent and a great sucess. It was a heartening feel- ing to see the campus become so involved.\ Athletes Honored at Block u Ceremony Fashion Show ... continued from page t• by Ste,phanie Slobotkin N~sEditor On Wednesday, May 14, this year's Block U represented all in- tercollegiate sports from the fall, winter, and spring.

Those who partici.,. pated on any sport for four years received a varsity letter and a watch. Three-year var- sity members received a letter as well as a Block U sweater. MVP winners were given an additional unidentified gift. Prize Day winners received their awards during the ceremony as well. President Roger Hull was · recognized among the student athletes for his support of Union athletics and was given his very own Block U sweater. Hull also made a speech about scholar athletes and emphasized the importance of the combina- tion of sports and academics.

National Ne\vs . . National News A Modest Compromise? An Opinion About the \Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act'' by Steve Potenza Contributing Writer Senate Democrats have fi- nally gotten it right; but we can help them get it even more right. We, the people of these United States, need most fervently fo protect the health of our women. What better way to protect a woman's health than to de- stroy the health of another person? In fact, what better way to afford American women a guarantee of health than to kill a baby, a \viable fetus\ in medical lingo, that jeopardizes their physical or mental health? Senators Tom Daschle (D-SD) and Barbara Boxer (D-CA) have valiantly tried to establish just such protection and may well be considered the hero and herodne of WO!J.len, in- deed the guarantors of health for all American women, through their tire- less effc;nts to defeat the Re- publicart bill before the Sen- ate that would ban partial- birth abortions in the United States. Senators Daschle and Boxer each introduced amendments to that hill that would allow partial-birth abortions when the life or health of the mother is in danger. Sure, \health\ is a vague, virtually undefin- able word that would give doctors license to conduct the procedure almost with- out restriction. For ex- ample, there must be some doctor outthere.whowould testify that the psychologi- cal trauma of, · say, a Senato{ s daughter having a child out of wedlock would do irreparable damage to such a woman's rnental health. Butthat'sokay. We, the people, need a bill vague enough that it will not alto- gether stop the use of par- Clinton· Promises AIDS Vaccine Within Next Decade tial birth abortion. If a baby poses a mental threat to its mothe.r late in her preg- nancy, by all me<tns it must be partially delivered and stabbe_d through the back of the head. That's choice. That's protection of women's health; and the Republicans in the Senate are heartless women-haters to suggest that such. an act is wrong. Not only are Republicans wrong-headed, they place the Senate in jeopardy o~ failing to recognize the s:ingle greatest threat to . a woman's health- newborn babies. By keeping the fo- cus of debate on the baby it?- the womb, our lawmakers overlook the serious threat to a woman's health posed by infants between the time they are born and their first · or second birthday. Think about it--sleepless nights, changes in life-style, endless headaches. The list could go on forever. Wake up Art1erica! We need not only partial-birth abortion hut full-birth abortion. Some may call it infanticide, but such people miss the point. This is women's health we are talking about. If we Americans were so con,.. c:erned about infanticide, we would not suppoFt members of Congress who seek to al- low partial .. birth abortions. After· all, what's the differft ertce between deliv,ering a baby partially and stabbing it through the head and de- livering it all the way and stabbing it? A few· inches. That's it. there is no differ'- ence. So I offer a proposal to fel- low C(}\Untry and countrywomen who ear- nestly desire to protect the health of women-stop bick\ ering ab()ut this partial-birth stuff and pass real legisla- tion.

Glaser, MPHto speak at a ben~ efit dinner for the National Bone Marrow Donor Program,and he graciously_accepted. The event was held on Friday evening, May 16, 1997 at 7:30 in the evening at the Sigma Phi Place at 1 Li- brary Lane. The Brothers of the Sigma Phi Society hosted alumni, invited guests, admired professors, and members of Union's administra- tion on this memorable evening. Mr. Glaser was invited to speak because of his past expe- rience in donor recruitment ef- · forts for bone marrow trans- plants; hence,. the Sigma Phi So- ciety thought he would be an ideal speaker on this topic of el'ninent importance in current biomedical treatment. Mr. Glaser worked for the National Bone Marrow Program under the United StatesNavyand Department o.f Defense after graduating from the University ofMaryland. He is currently the Assistant Director of the Bclne ·~ Marrow Donor Program at Georgetown University Ho~pital , jn, Washington, bC and has re- '- cently received his master's d~­ gree in health administration. In addition, Mr. Glaser spoke from the personal perspective ~f a bone marrow donor; he do- nated bone marrow anony- . mously to a leukemia patient on the west coast in 1989. Conse- quently, he addressed any inis- .infonnation or unqualified con- cerns relating to the transplant procedure. · Although the Alpha Chapter of tl1e Sigma Phi Society has been involved in several philanthropic efforts in the past, the active brotherhood was enthusiastically seeking to widen the scope of its charitable energy by benefiting the bone marrow donor program. The funds raised from this nonprofit event benefited the Greek Newspaper Beginning This Fan· by Jason Kellman Future Editor The tnterfraternity and Panhellenic Council of Union College are working on the con- struction of a Greek newspaper to be distributed to the campus starting· next fall'. This eight-page publication will be an assortment of articles written by various Greeks at Union. There will be columnists who can contribute their insights on the Greek system every issue, there will be a monthly calendar printed ofupcmhing events, and a philanthrdpic page display-ing fund~ raising activities that have transpired. Our dbjective is for this paper to allow every Greek organization, recognized by the Greek councils, to discuss their house function and insi about the future and to act as a voice of approbation by the Greek community in regard ·to Union College in general. · I There will be room for liter- . -- ary submissions as well as vari- . ous and sundry advertisements and announcements. This news .. -paper is designed to promotethe Greek system and to allow.. stu- dents to express their· feelings on how we can improve our exist- ing situation.

. . Page 8 · May 22\~ 1997 · 'IDlpr (!Jo\tnwoirn~tl2' . . - · OP/ED EDITORIAL Is the Campus Without Fault? Fre'}uentreaders of TheConcordiensis might have noticed that the to11eof.the newspaper has changed. Over the last few years, the campu:s has dealt with numerous issues, such as the meal plan and Greek problems. Seven issues into the term, the paper has had two fashi•m'Sh()WS, a saved rink, and several speakers on the frontpage. Except fcJ: the VLA and Coffeehouse stories, the newspaper has almo:st looked like an Admissions View Book. We thought we would search for the cause-ofthis change in demeanor. · We first guessed that the students have become more apathetic. If sru-den:ts do not care about problems, then there are no \problems\ . to deal with. However, the Fashion Shows and the Comic Hypnotist brought cut a decent number of spectators. So much for apathy. Then, we guessed President Hull and the administration became more stlld~nt-friendly. Let's face it, Hull lost his voice cheering ·with stuclents at the RPI playoff series. Yet, Dean Alford and · company got themse1ves into a jam recently with the Coffeehouse/ Tri-Delta :situation. 1n addition, Hull's exposure has been limited after several cameo appearances this term. So what has caused this blissful tenn? Certainly notthe weather, the .administration, or student apathy. Is it the new editors and their \Co~ser~ative\ stances? Well, you can make that call. However, we have found a more legitimate explanation for the spring change. We believe thatthe students are l'Ruch more aware of the events around them than they have been in the past. This includes political · activity, as. shown by the twelve candidates running for Sophomore Class Representatives, social activity, such as the Hypnotist and · F as:h l()n Sltows, and academic activity, I ike the near -record number of Steinmetz presentations. The ad ministration should be thriHed with these student accomplishments. This is what they have been striving for over the ,]ast few years. Now it is time for the administration to start acting with the same awareness the students have adopted. · Resiide11ce Life has an obligation to inform students whether or not tfuey eari live off campus much earlier than they do. The delay causes. several rental problems for otherwise trustworthy stude11ts. The Dean of Students had an obligation t-o speak to the SAC to see whether or not the Coffeehouse needed to go to the lottery process. Inste:ad, he assumed that Tri-Delta would pass an SAC review, cattsin:g st11dents to vjewlottery as meaningless. . A fllH loo.k .at the administration~s perfonnance this year will be printed ne-xt week. However, one thing is for sure. Students have taken a certain degree ofr~sponsibil ity(things are not perfect with studeMs~ lmt they have improved). Instead of being rewarded, though, 1nany students are being hurt by errors and ridiculous policies. While we are not asking for a doggie biscui~ for our better behavior, what we do want t~ see is the same consistency expected from us p\lt forth by the administration. An organization which cannct trmst its own advice loses its legitimacy. The administration . need:s to 1::tke a step back and learn from the student body before the studentbQ!dy decides to follow such an inconsistent example.

Recentlyhowever, · my ()ptimism has been tainted. : On several occasions this yeat, 'I ha~eheard students assert that li~­ ing..., arrangements \such as , Thui-ston House'; are detrimental i - . to our campus. I mention . Tltllrston House in particular since it Is often the target of such outlandish claims. Those who perlletrate this ignorance often charge that by ~'separating them- selves,\ Asian students inhibit · othe-Is from experiencing cultural dive1sity at Union. Not only does this assertion fail to recognize the cultural diversity within Thurston ' Hollse, but it also refl.ects a bro11der Imstility towards ethnic differences. I write, not as a resi- dent of Thurston House, but ratlier as a non-Asian student who feels personally enriched by the existence of the house. In 1996, . Tll.U rston House was founded wi11l the intention of promoting Asian cultural awareness. Due to ign'orance, many Union stu- . de11ts think that a homogeneous grollp ofstudents lives together in th-e house. In reality, Thurs~~:m Hotlse offers the most cultural(y diverse living opportunity on calllpus. Thurston is home to pe()p]e from China, as well as '· . Koreans, Burmese, African Amerieans,-ana Caucasians. At Uni~n, ·ifsthedosestthing we've. gotto the, UN General-Assembly. Rather than criticize Thurston House, we should ernul ate it. · Although my fellow students enjoy talking about «cultural di- versity,\ they fundamentally mis- understand the very meaning of \ct.llture.\' According to Web:ster'sDictionary, culture is, \the body of customary beliefs, so'Cial fonns, and ttiaterial traits constituting a distinct complex of tradition of a racial, rei igious, or social group.\ We must recog- nize that the very existence of culture depends upon commu- nity. ·Thurston House plays a criti- cal role in facilitating the presence of'various Asian cultures on cam- pus·. If all- Asian students were ·dispersed evenly throughout cam- pus, you may be more likely to have an Asian neighbor. however you·would be fat less likely to experience Asian culture. The frequently voiced opposition to ethnic groups who «segregate themselves\ reflects. a pervasive hostility in America towards true diversity. These self-proclaimed propo- nents of diversity are kind enough to welcome anyone who is will-. ing to leave their culture at the door. What type ofdiversity de- mands confonnity? If cultural diversity :is important to us ln truth, not only in words. we will abandon our fears and miscon- ceptions and encourage the type of diversity which: relies upon comnmnity ,. .. Perhaps the most unjust criti- cism -I have recently heard is that ethnic housing groups don't ac- tively expose the campus to \di- versity.\ Such-comments:almost always emanate from students who never .attend the multitude of cultural events on campus. Aside from offering movies and discu:;sions on a weekly basis (which are not only open to ev- eryone, hut a•lso advertised), Thurston House frequently spon- sors major cultural events on campus such as the Fifth Annual Cultural Expose and Fashion Show this past week, and Tea Time .in Nott Memorial with au- thentic Asian snacks. It seems to me, that the individuals who cry that Union .doesn't expose them to cultural diversity are wearing blinders. Wake up and smell the sake! You can'texpect a group of flamenco dancers to rush into your room and take you as their dance partner.· Leaming about other cultures is an active process which requires some personal ini- tiative. Maybe these critics would be happier if Union made origami and perforrtJ.ingthe Japa- nese Tea ceremony a requirement for graduation. If my fellow Union students really waqt to ex- perience cultural diversity, as. they claim, then they will take the first step.

Conner '98 Get an \A\ On Your Thesis, Win Absolutely Nothing:!.: A Response to Tony LaVecchia's Op-Ed Article Another Response to LaVecchia by Lawren~e Paska Staff Writer Kudos to Tuny LaVecchia, whose article last week on the shameless distribution of certain prizes at last week's Prize Day exposes the sad truth about award-giving. Let's face it: hu- mans love to praise and be praised, and what better way to find gratificati<ln than to work hard toward achieving awards at ceremonies? I come from the school of thought that believes awards cer- emonies are somewhat pointless, because they often exclude many people who deserve notice for their accomplishments, even though their work may pale in comparison to the \towering greatness\ our esteemed student leaders have reached. Of course, I am being a little harsh; many of those who received prizes de- served them and I know they worked hard to achieve recogni- tion. But how is it possible for us to single out one person mul- tiple times for awards when all of us, in our own way, are wor- thy of a good pat on the back? Yes, Tony, it disturbs me, too, that \if you're well-liked and af- filiated with an organization, they can take care of you on prize day.\ Of all tl1e les~ons one is supposed to leam in life, the only one that truly has stuck in my mind is the one you are not re- ally taught, but you pick up through experience: life is a popularity contest. It is impos- sible to s out for their accomplishments, butwhen people are awarded who are bla- tantly undeserving of ~q.~h praise, it really frustrates me q,at there are hard-working people out there who are overlooked when it's time to hand out the honors. It is one thing to win a pri;ze, but did Ben Fox deserve to sweep the ceremony with three? Wasn't there room to recognize another student, particularly on,e with high scholastic achievement to his name? When I scan the I ist of prize recipients, I am happy to see some very good stu- dents earn just recognition. And then I see the name of someone who bashes this school in his weekly column of the Concordiensis listed as a recipi- ent of a College Service A ward! Wasn't this pillar of our commu- nity suspended from school years back for alleged connections to a hazing incident? And the Top Ten Reasons he was honored were? ... It is a shame that when we single people out for distinction, we do so multiple times and do not allow others to receive a prize. One Prize Day recipient received a whopping five awards. I am not in a position to judge this person's merit, but do you mean to tell me that no one else even came close to measur- ing up to the standards of these awards? By distributing the awards across more students, we can better represent the diverse efforts of more students who work-. in their own ways-to better themselves and the school. To the Editor: I am concerned with the most recent article in this newspaper highlighting Ben's thesis tra- vails. Has this become a running soap opera on this campus? Will Ben pass? ~~11. Bl!n graduate? and now should Ben be getting his award? Well, I say yes, he definitely deserved that award, without question. There are two components to the award-out- standing contributions in schol- arship and student activities. I don't think there is any question as to Ben meeting the second re- quirement. He was president of the IFC, served on the Student Forum, sat on the SAC, sat on the Finance Committee, co- chaired the Fashion Show of Support, co-chaired Youth Olympics, etc .... Do I really need to continue? He was con- tinually come above the call of duty to serve this school and make efforts to improve it Tony La V ecchia feels that Ben does not meet the first standard of con- tribution to scholarship. I challenge that he does. No- where in the description of the award does it say thatthismeans that Ben must have the highest GPA or even a good GPA. This is not about numbers, it is about a contribution. It can be made in a number of ways. Yes, a contri- bution could be seen as high aca- demic achievement, but I think it can be done in other ways as well. In Ben's case, I think the contribution he makes is in his ability to add valued comments and opinions to discussions. He took a class about women and politics: himself and 30 women. I only wish I could have been in the class to hear what he had to say. So I argue that Ben's force- ful and articulate personality in the classroom make him the best candidate for this award. So in- stead of judging someone be- cause he/she doesn't meet your own standards, why don't you respect that he/she met someone else's and give him/her a con- gratulatory handshake. I for one would like to congratulate Ben for all his hard work!! Sincerely, Courtney Feeley '99 Editorial Examined Dear Jon, Thanks for the illuminating article on the situation up here at Raymond North (The Coffee- house). Man, you got it! f tell you Jon, most Editor in Chiefs. would have a tough time writing an unsigned editorial without any facts, Dagnabbit, you've got guts-! like that in an Editor in Chief. To be able to impugn with such ease and (ifl do say) grace requires INTELLIGENCE. You is smart. But I tell you Jon Gasthalter, what I really find special in you is your uncanny knack forknow- ing just the right time to break the rules. Your stated letters policy says that, \editorials re- flect the opinion of a majority of the editorial board,\ You brushed that policy aside with uncommon veracity. Printing that editorial-un- signed-without the consensus of the editorial board. Some would call that cowardice, but I call it savvy. You should think of a career in the administration at Union. No, but seriously you con- temptible fool, your dishonest and deceptive letter casts doubt over the entire paper. I admit~ when I first read the article I just thought lt was painfully pro- Greek. Upon reevaluation I realize it's just \pro-idiot\. It is frightening that the Editor in Chief of our school paper would write an edi- torial whose very prern ise is based completely on non-truths. You realize, Jon, that the people being housed on Lenox road had CONTRACTS already signed with the school guaranteeing them housing in Raymond North. When our floor was taken away the school was merely ac- commodating the broken con- tracts. You claim that we are whining to get our floor back. Jon, we stated from the begin- ning that we didn't want to de- bunk those seventeen Tri-Delts, and we never asked fQrthe floor back. Therefore, we have to question the motivation behind someone who would write an editorial criticizing us for trying to get our floor back. Do you fear the mighty pres- ence of theme houses? Don't worry Jon, they can'ttake away your pin. With Sympathy, ConorMcKenzie '99 Scott Stedman '99 Do Like to Take Photographs? If Yes, then contact Laurie Kirschner at x6155.

Student Forum 1997 Class Representative E:lections Twelve Candidates For Sophomore Class Repres~ntatives Michael Winn I'd would like to initially send out a debt of gratitude to the en- tire class of2000 for giving me a chance to represent you during our Freshman year. I hope that your first year at Union was as good as mine. Being your class representative this year has been David Dussault Hello, my name is David Dussault, and I'm a candidate for Sophomore class represenative. This election means a lot to me because many things need to be changed on campus, and a strong voiced individual, I ike myself, has to step forward to take initia- tive. I possess many qualities that can help me with my goals. I am a dynamic person with a new out- look on how the sophomore class should be represented in the stu- dent forum. We need to come together and utilize the democ- racy here at Union College. A leader needs to fight for us in the forum in order to have anything accomplished. There are two ways I intend to go about accomplishing this task, fighting for my ideals as well as bringing back the true democracy that our school was founded upon. I will not use my elected position as a power, but as a pub- lic servant as it is meant to be. I am willing to open my mailbox to the members of the Sophomore class for suggested ideas and Roger McShane One night last term I was go- ing off on one my tirades about how I disliked college life when someone came up to me and said, \If you hate it so much why don't you do something about it.\ So John Czajka As our Freshman year comes to a close, we can look back and see how far we have come since those first few days. Throughout the year we have had many inter- esting and fun experiences. If elected, my first priority would be very time consurning, but quite worth the effort. Doing a success- ful job representing our class -in the Student Fotum and serving you were my two objectives when l was first elected. As a Fresh- man on the Stadent Forum, I have been quite vociferous and any- thing but rel actant to speak up about topics that concern the Freshman Class, and the rest of the student body. I have orga- nized events for the Freshman Class, with our other two Fresh- man Class Representatives. Events such as the \Comic Hyp- notist\ have been very success- ful, and I plan on holding similar events that will bring our class together. Although I feel I have accom- plished a substantial amount dur- changes, and upon consideration will fight for that in the student forum, as the system was truly founded to do. We must remem- ber that not one student controls the student fmum, but the multi- tude of enrolled students does, and I'm running_tp be able to rep- resent the Sophomore class and fight with an iro11 fist. Although I intend to rest the ideals tor change on the students of our class, 'I also have a few main goals' that I want to fight for in the forum. We have three years left at Union College, and our social life consists of going to fra- here is iny chance to do some- thing about it. I am not running in order to gain a title or boost my ego. I could really care less about that stuff. I am not going to run off a laundry I ist of my accom- plishments and activities, rather I will tell you tl1at for the past year I have been a normal college freshman just like you. I am run- ning because I want college to be the four most enjoyable years of our I ives. I fe~l thatthis year was a good start to o11rcollege careers~ however I als<J feel that so much more can be dorteto improve our enjoyment of college. For ex- ample I am a huge fan of frater- nity parties h()wever I don't feel like they shoul~ be the only op- tion on Friday and Saturday nights. The C()mic Hypnotist was a good example of an alternative to expand up<Jn them and other areas that we, as aclass, feel nee~ essary to address. It would be my privilege to represent the Sopho- more Class to the best of my abil- ity. I will pay particular attention to the class expectations of me as well as to the specific requests of the class. ing this past year, I don't feel I Greg Auerbach am close to doing everything I canforourclass,andthisschool.

My name is Jennifer Caruse and I'm running tor Sophomore Class R~presentative. As a Fresh- man, I have been involved in vari- ous organizations both on and of the cam pus. I am a on the staff of the Concordiensis, a volunteer at the Sclmectady Damien Center, Orientation Advisor and a Big Sister for the Big Brother Big Sis- ter program. I feel that I possess many personal qualities that will make me successful as your class represerttative. I am very friendly, hard working, and diligent. In any community such as the Union college community, it is very important tor the people ~s voices to be heard. I believe that the students should be involved and deserve to hear that their opinions and feelings should be valued by the administration and other fellow students alike. As your Sophomore Class represen- tative, I will assure you that your coricemswill be heard. I am very enthusiastic to hear your ideas and concerns. I feel that it is very important for the Sophomore class to unite as one. This first year of college, flew by and before you know it, we will be graduating. When elected, I want to provide the class events so that we can become more together as a class. [ am very enthusiastic to hear your ideas, so don 'thesitate to stop me. I wish you all the best of luck for the remainder ofthe·school year and for a relaxing summer. On Friday vote Jennifer Caruso for Sophomore Representative.

Page 14 · May 22, 1997 · <!Jlre ill1ntcnrohusis . · ' · Features ' ' . ' College: Is· it a Sitcom? by Michelle Tham Features Editor College is just one big sitcom. It's a sort of strange idea to have, but I have discovered over the course ofthisyearthat my life and the lives of those around me seem to strongly parallel many ofthose TV. shows that never seem to leave us and will be reruns for- ever. Forme, being in a somrity has sort of felt a little Beverly Hills 902 I 0-esque. Not to sound overly cheesy or annoying, but honestly, I remember that random episode where Brenda, Kelly, Donna and Andrea rushed sororities. In are- ally scary way I think our experi- ences in the beginning were pretty much the same. Choosing a house, deciding if going Greek was the right thing to do, choos- ing who would be friends for life and who you would just have to Jearn to tolerate. Granted, there is no Peach Pit here and a group of us girls can't completely neg the Greek system and decide to go form our own sorority centered around burgers and fries, so I sup- pose we'll just have to deal with what we've got. As for the rest of campus life, the Rent-A-Greek event is quite reminiscent of what teeny-bopper television series? Yes, you've guessed it, Saved by the Bell. Ev- utc eryone wanted to buy Zack and Slater, but nobody really wanted poor Screech. I mean, when I watched that show I never hon- estly thought that anything I ike that ever happened in realllfe, but apparently it does. Somehow, the auctioning off of actual human beings seems a Jittle too outra- geous to be nonfiction. In keep- ing with the whole Saved by the Bell theme, there will be p.ie- throw.ing sometime this week at a group of eager young ladies. This, yet again, brings up memo- ries of the events at a certain car- nival sponsored by no less than those cool kids at Bayside. As for crazy college occur- rences, Charles in Charge seems appropriate. BuddyandCharles were a magnificent duo, always lookii1g for some way to win d1e girl and to party hardy. Every college campus has a set of them, ready and willing to do anything completely asinine simply for a laugh. Of course, we can't forget that classic spring break episode where they were arrested with a group of girls for being naked. How many girls did Charles normally go through in the span of a week anyway? See, T.V. really does parallel college life. I also can't help but add The Cosby Shan•, since it is the tale of woe of every college boy and 0 • girl to beg for money .. In the classic style of the one and only Theo Huxtable, calling mom and dad for the solepurpose.of cash seems familiar. Ofco.urse, he ,came home once in a while, for either the occasional load of laundry or his daily rai(} of the refrigerator. Oh, if every guy on campus was only dose enough to home to steal a bologna sand- wich every day. Maybe this col- lege would be an even happ.ier place.

However, the restaurant was quite good. I am biased, though, because I was starving when I Went there. That is why I chose the buffet. CLYDE: We both ordered the $8.95 dinner buffet, which fea- tured a soup bar (Hot and Sour, Wanton, plus chicken wings and boneless ribs), the main entree bar, which featured over twenty dishes, ranging from Sesame Chicken to Roast Pork Egg Foo Young to Vegetarian Delight-a mix of vegetables in a light sauce. BONNIE: Ordering a buffet is al- ways risky. You are at the mercy Dinner Date: Take Two of the waiters' timing.

The exhibit featured a va- riety of works by both artists. In· their introduction to the show, each of the artists explained their sources for inspiration.

Gabriela Dory felt the show was enoouraging and felt that musicals are manageable and that Union -has tlle. talent necessary. The large size of the audience showed that:people want to see· moreniu- sicals. In the past, Mountebanks and the Performing Arts Depart- ment has stayed away fr()m musi~ calsbecause they felt that the tri'- mester system does not allow the time necessary to fully execttte a musical. The live musicperforrned by junior Jen Angerosa on pi2no and freshman Ian White on drums added to the intensity o.fthe pro- duction. TheNo-Frills Revue combined a pl~asura.ble mix of solo acts and company numbers whjch w.ere bofll energetic and evol<ed a tre- melldous resp6nse from the audi- ence. which absorbs the ink to create the desired image. The second technique used in Verge was the linocut. The artist creates a linocut by taking a sheet of linolithane and carving all of the parts ofthe sheet that he/she de- sires to be white. The artist then takes the carved sheet and rolls it with ink. The impressed portions remain white and everything not carved is colored. A variation on this technique .is' the reductive I inocuL Following the same ba- sic techniques of a linocut, the reductive linocut allows the artist to roll several colors over the piece. The artist first carves out everything that he/she does not · want to be painted the first color of choice. The artist'inust repeat this proqedure again and again ·until all of the desired co lots have been rolled over. This is especially difficult because the image does not truly start to take shape until the.lastfewcolorsarerolled.

The perennial leader of the Union track team for the past four years saw h:is last season competfng for Union col- legecome to a close. Should this beatime for regret? On the con- · trary, it should be a time when fol- lowers of Union athletics stop to appreciate the efforts of a talented runner who is undoubtedly one of the best runners in the state and arguably the best Union athlete in the sport. This athlete is Dave Riggi. As his senior year and last season here draws to a dose, it is proper that the Union community now has the opportunity to learn about the Dave Riggi who walks to the college center, not the one who is consistently one ofthe top three sprinters iri the state or con- sistently winning championships. Coach Aldo Nardiello at the Block U dinner this past week said it most directly, Dave Riggi-fastest man at Union Col- lege. · Soon after corning to the con- clusion that ''football wasn't for [hitn]\ and listen-ing to the advice of friends, Riggfdecided to go out for the track team at his high school at nearby.Schalmonfhigh school his sophomore year. In his ' firstrace everinthe 100m, Riggi finished second to a teammate, and for the next seven' years, never lost to a t~ammate' in the 100m. In his re!Jlaining time in high school, Riggi became the three-time \.mdefeated sectional champ in the lOOm and 200m. In addition, he set several sch.ool records and won numerous cham- pionships. After learning about Riggi's outstanding high school career, Dave Harrington took an interest in Riggi early on, an~ thi~, c~m­ binedwith Uniori;sclose proxim- ity' to home and good reputation, · made Union his first choice. Al- though he- had been recruited by Harrington, Larry Cottrell was his first track coach at Union. Once at Union, Riggi did not lose his top form. In his fresh- man season, Rigg.i was unfazed by the competition and placed second in indoor states in the 55m .. in the time since, he has set sev~raJ scho()] records both in in- door track and outdoor track in the 55m, 1 ()Om, 200m, and in the relays, ofwhi.ch he is most proud. The highlight of Riggi's time at Union can unquestionably be his win in the 200m at outdoor states I ast year. This past season, Riggi was unable to repeat as champion but finished third in a personal best time. Duringbis four years at Union, Riggi had tremendous success at the State Championships. Here is ~ brief r~cap: freshman-· (in- door) 2nditJ 55m, Jrd in 200m and (outdoor) 4th in 4xl 00; sophomore~(lndoor) 2nd in 55m, 4th ih 200m and (outdoor) 4th in lOOm, 4th in 200m; jun- ior-(indoor)2nd in'S Sm. 3rd in · 200m airc{ (outdoor) I st in 200m, 3rd in JO(!m. ·4th in 4xHfO; se- nior-(ind~IJ,.)2nd in5Sin, 5th in ?OOm and (outdoor) 3rd in 1OOm, 3rd in 200m, and 4th in 4x 100. Acade1_:nicaUy, Riggi came to Union thinking . .about an engi- neering major, but similar to his switch from football to track be- cause he \'just did not have the love for it,\ Riggi soon switched to applied math where his true love was. In June, Riggi wfll graduate with an applied math major and an economics mi11or. He hopes to go into computer pro- gram analysis o~ computer con~ suiting. In what is truly al) ironic story, three years ago there was a tal- ented local track runner who, similar to Riggi, had Union as 11is first choice. For whatever reason, this athlete chose RPI instead, and for the next three years went on to plague Riggi and the Union track program.. This runner is Krishaun Gilmore. Riggi had raced himd1,uing high schoQl and had strongly 11oped that Gilmore would come to Union because he felt \it would be great for the pro- gram\ to have two num her-one sprinters. Now is where the ques- tions of what could have been begin. Over the next three years, in both indoor and outdoor track, Riggi has finished belli nd Gilmore in every single race in which they have raced head-te>- head. Gilmore has won several state championships in the 55m, 1OOm, 200m and this past indoor season won nationals in the 55tn. Last year he won the lOOm. Riggi says that \[GilmoreJjustkept get- ception one of'the [few] athletes ting faster and faster while I just in the 90s who came to Union to k~pt getting consistent:: Despite be a track star. .. he has been a never being able to break through leader on and off the field and has and beat Gilmore, Riggi has IJot been a great ass~tto the program.\ become discouraged b)/this.

Her use of humor to convey such messages was appreciated by junior Josh Katz.

At the beginning of the event Cronin, who currently has Cystic Fibrosis addressed the audii:mce with the facts aheut her .experi\: ence and the fact that the d·isease is the nuinber one killer of chil- dren. Last year's function took place because one of Laurel's friend, Kristina was afflicted. with Cys- tic Fibrosis and was in dire need of a double-lung transplant ~nd did not have the money to pay for it. However, the only hospital able to perform this is in Califor'- nia, and the family's expenses would have exceeded $30,000. Ms .. Cronin looked to the event to help herfriend. Unfortunately, Kristina passed away before the event occurred, but the $1,$00 raised was donated to the Cystic. fibrosis Foundation. This year, the money, which surpassed last year's dollar amount,. was do- nated to the same cause. Those who participated were required to fulfill tasks for the peeple who bought them. The service period, when the bidders. got their money's worth, began at midnight on May 22 and lasted until the stroke of midnight on Friday, May 23. The students ful- ·filled their services but were not required to do anything against their will. Freshman Jordanna Mal1ach and junior Frank Rossi chipped in $40 to buy Ch~is Brantigan, newly elected President of Stu- dent Forum. \We had him do some laundry and othet light · tasks,\ Rossi said. Jesse S~aferwas bought by the Theta Delta Chi pledges for about $50 and other peeple were bought for about the same price. A.;cording to Fox,sen:ior Rawson Thurber and junior Anne Swasey were extremely enter• taining. 'The two were real crowd pleasers and their spirit added to the energy of the event. lt w::ts a pI easure to Bee those who came out to show their support for Laurel and this good cause,\ Fox said.

Boat House Update by Aileen Quigley News EditfJr The Stockade in Schenectady has been chosen as the location for the long~awaited Union Co.l~ . lege hoathouse.In a meeting last Wednesday, President Hull met with Schenectady Mayor AI Jurcyrtski and Gary McCarthy of the City Council's Finance Com~ mittee. They solidified a \verbal agreement\ on the nearby site and Hull projectsthat \there is a very good chance of having the boat- house by the time the students return in the Fall.\ Hull stated that several main issues were discussed during the mediation of this agreement. . First, the question of security was raised to ensure the safety of the Union students who would be usi11g the facility, and to do so, it would be paramountto maintain a police presence. Secondly, maintenance .of the property itself aiso appeared on the forefront ofthe negotiations. Hull wanted to feeJ.confidentthat the land would be kept free from garbage and vandalism, and that propet lighting and paved side~ walks would be installed. The fi- nal consideration that had to be addressed was the swimming pool Jocated·nexttotheprQperty. The college was granted an assur- anee that, should the city decide not to operate it, the option tolmy it would be offered to Union. Now that this rnaj!1)r hurdte has been circumvented, the let:~gtby but mandatory lega:J: process has begun tn get the .project ph:ysi~ cally underway. Attorneys from Union and the city are in the·pro~ cess ofcompleting numerot~sper~ mit applications and coordinating plans between the architect and the contractor, P.lank Construe~ tion Co.

On July 2, 1997, the college will appear before the Zoning Board with this infon11a.,. tion to apply for a \special use penni(;\ securing the appeal for the land. Issues covered in this final stage will inciude fire safety, electrical plug .plaeement, and access for emergencies. With these assurances.that1he paperwork is underway and soon to be completed, actual collstrl;!c- tion of the boathouse has become a very ral possibility.

Qox5679 \ ' Boat House Update by Aileen Quigley News Editor The Stockade in Schenectady has been chosen as the location for the long-awaited Union Col- lege boathouse.ln a meeting last Wednesday, President Hull met with Schenectady Mayor AI Jurcynski and Gary McC~rthy of the City Council's Finance Com- mittee. They solidified a \verbal agreement\ on the nearby site and Hull projects that \there is a very good chance ofhaving the boat- house by the time the students return in the Fall.\ Hull stated that several main issues were discussed during the mediation of this agreement. First, the question of security was raised to ensure the safety of the Union students who would be using the facility, and to do so, it would be paramount to maintain a police presence. Secondly, maintenance of the property itself also appeared on the forefront of the negotiations. Hull wanted to feel confident that the land would be kept free from garbage and vandalism, and that proper lighting and paved side- walks wuuld be installed. The fi- nal consideration that had to be addressed was the swimming pool located next to the property. The college was granted an assur- ance that, should the city decide not to operate it, the option to buy it would be offered to Union. Now that this major hurdle has been circumvented, the lengthy but mandatory legal process has begun to get the project physi- cally underway. Attorneys from Union and the city are in the pro- cess of completing numerous per- mit applications and coordinating plans between the architect and the contractor, Plank Construc- tion Co. Vice President of Cam- pus Planning Joe Mammola re- ports that the team \has made a I ot of progress this week.\ Over the course of the next few weeks, Mammola estimated that the \culmination of getting all of our infonnation together\ should be completed. On July 2, 1997, the college will appear before the Zoning Board with this informa- tion to apply for a \special use permit,\ securing the appeal for the land. Issues covered in this final stage will inciude fire safety, electrical plug placement, and access for emergencies With these assurances that the paperwork is underway and soon to be completed, actual construc- tion of the boathouse has become a very raJ possibility. Hull projects that it should take close to two to three months to finish. Mammola concurs, saying that \it should be ready by the beginning of September ecr shortly there- after.\ \I'm del igl:!ted 1h.at we are go- ing to build in Schenectady, \stated Mammola, \Schenectady is our home ... and I'm delighted that we are be able to make this contributttion to the city.\ He also noted tllat, of the ma- jor cities in the ar:e.a, Schenectady is the only onen()tto have devel- oped its waterfront for recreation. '<Hopefully this vvi U make the wa- terfront more attFftctive.\ Now that the Stockade was the official, chosen location, Mammola persoitally contacted the elected offkials of the con- tending sites withtilne decision. He was very impress:ed how \they have such a h i~h regard for Union ... we should be proud of that.\ He cited how '\'tremendously helpful\ they were and how happy they were f~r us. \We went to them at thei,r invitation,\ he said, \ ... they would have loved to help US.\ He hopes Uni()n students will be able to bring great events and activities down to the Stockade. Races and eventu~lly, a large re- gatta, could bringrnany people to the city. \It's a win-win situation for everyone.\ -: · .. _·.Fin'al WRUtt.B.r~adcast: Saturday, J.une 7 1-3-.AM . · ..... . ' . .

l l I Auction Items Put to Good Use for Good Cause Rent-a-Greek from LlLlLl and E>LlX by Stephanie Slobotkin News Editor On Wednesday, May 21, the coalesced efforts of Delta Delta Delta sorority and Theta Delta Chi fraternity raised money for the second annual Servant-for-a- Day Auction, which benefited the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation. Senior Ben Fox and junior Lau- rel Cronin, both 1nembers oftheir respective Greek houses, orga- nized the event that attracted over 200 students, faculty, and staff. At the beginning of the event Cronin, who currently has Cystic Fibrosis addressed the audience with the facts about her experi- ence and the fact that the disease is the number oae killer of chil- dren. Last year's function took place because one of Laurel's friend, Kristina was afflicted with Cys- tic Fibrosis and was in dire need of a double-lung transplant aad did not have the money to pay for it. However, the only hospital able to perform this is in Califor- nia, and the family's expenses would have exceeded $30,000. Ms. Cronin looked to the event to help her friend. Unfortunately, Kristina passed away before the event occurred, but the $1 ,500 raised was donated to the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation. This year, the moNey, which surpassed last year's dollar amount, was do- nated to the same cause. Those who participated were required to fulfill tasks for the people who bought them. The service period, when the bidders got their money's worth, began at midnight on May 22 and lasted until the stroke of midnight on Friday, May 23. The students ful- filled their services but were not required to do anything against their will. Freshman Jordanna Mallach and jm'lior Frank Rossi chipped in $40 to buy Chris Brantigan, newly elected President of Stu- dent Forum. \We had him do some laundry and other light tasks,\ Rossi said. Jesse Shafer was bought by the Theta Delta Chi pledges for about $50 and other people were bought for about the same pnce. According to Fox, senior Rawson Thurber and junior Anne Swasey were extremely enter- taining. \The two were real crowd pleasers and their spirit added to the energy of the event. It was a pleasure to see those who came out to show their support for Laurel and this good cause,\ Fox said.

Recentinterest in tum- ing .the city govef11ment over to the county suggests that Schenectady's current situation is irreversible. This interest has de- veloped in part from the city gov- ernment finally acknowledging that it had spread itself too thin. Soon Union College will be one of the primary employers in Schenectady County, as\ General Electric continues to lay-off workers and demolish buildings, with the added effect of other businesses leaving the area. Schenectady seems to be a city · whose time has .past, with the ex- ception of Union College. Schenectady has enjoyed a strong intellectual reputation; the city can· boast of having one of the highest concentrations of Ph.D.'s in the nation. Although the city has been stripped ofmany vital resources, it is still possible to preserve this image of intellec- tual quality through those with an academic background and a love of the Capital Region. Among these resources are th()se who work and play ih the community of Union College. Therefore, it would seem logical to eJCpand Union's physical influence throughout the city. While ,Schenectady ll~s suf- fered through the last f~ years, Unimt has fl!)urished dramati- cally. The Office of Adrn issions reported a record year f(lr fresh- man class enrollment in 1996~ 1997 and a record numb.erof ap- plications this year~ a theater was constructed and a library,is being renovated; and the cente.,iece of this institution, the Nott Memo- rial, was brought back to life in grand splendor. In addifi()n, the $9 million Olin Center is under- going construction, a further tes- tament to the strength~Iting of academics at the College. Recent attitudes on campus havealso re- flected~ a change in the ti.mes: I enns Abroad opportunities. have increased, more studentspartici- pate in independent stu~li.es and research or intemships, a:Jid more students express intolerance to- ward many \traditional C()rnpo- nents, of a college society, such as hazing. While traditi()n is still llpheld at Union (witne.ss the painting of the Idol), cJ1ange seems to be the only cons1ant .in 1990s America. With this in mind, Uni()tJ needs to change. Nottosimplychange its course offerings o.r activity schedules, but to physically eJC- pand itselfbeyond the boutidaries andlirnitationsofa 100-acrecarn- pus. The natural direction of im- mediate expansion is, of~:;ourse, west (\Go west, young College, go west\) For Union to stand on PHOTO . . .the forefront of being a supreme academic institution, it needs to establisl'l itselfbeyond the perim- eterS of its gates and walls and rriake its presence feltthroughout the surrounding area, where many houses and buildings are cur- rently in states of d·iSrepair. The ptoposal to buy up the land of Seward Place. and convert the houses int() dormitory space seems a: lqgical first .step. The Seward Place community is~om­ posed o:f: many decaying resi-. dences; under the ownership of Union, tlo:wever, Seward could become an attractive street once more, wltte:re students (and staff) could .reside together on If thor- oughfare which does not separate Union from the- city, but serves .as a comrtt\lflity gateway through the heart ·of an extended carnpus. · Some bus:inesses do operate in this area. !Jutsuccessful melding ofUnion with Schenectady would .include preserving St. Antl10ny' s Church ( ~orner of Seward and Nott)--the church, on the \new campus grounds,\ would invite local residents onto Union'scam- pus to usetheirfacility.

. Opinions Prize Day Statements Found Erroneous by Jen Lawless Contributing Writer Let me preface this letter by stating that it is meant to be nei- ther a defense, nor ajustification for the distribution of prizes In eatly May. I do not care to di$• pute the manner in which certain people may have been 9ver- Jooked in the ceremony and I do 110t want to take timeto argue the case for \multiple recipients., Rather, I find it my <>bligation to correct blatantly erroneous and contradictory asseliions which appeared in an article written by a cantributing writer last week. Considering that many Union stu- dents conceive of The Concordie.nsis as a source of news, its contents sho11ld. be ac- curate and grounded. in fact. Whether certain stories are news- worthy is a different issue that I have neither the time nor the in- clination to debate. In lastweek'sissue, Lawrence Paska commented <ln the egre- gious inj\lstice Union College committed when it awarded mul- tiple prizes to various recipient~ during the annual Prize Day cer- ~mony. He concedes that many of the award winners deservedly merited their prizes, as they \worked hard to a~.hieve recog- nition.;, When he turns to the .. ~!:Jt~jPkle9,piynt~_,_l;lo:,vever, Mr. Paska' s tone and line of reason- ing dramatically change. Rather than accept the fact that a student can work hard and achieve rec~ ognition in the fonn of more than one award, Paska assumes that such cases involve a selection process which is nothing tliore than a flagrant «poptdarity con- test., In other words, we should be leery ofindividuals whose aca- demic contributions are recog- nized more than once. Asking how it is possible to \single out one .person multiple times for awardswhenallofus, inourway, are worthy of a good pat on the back?\ Paska suggests that the prize allocation process not only overlooks diligc;:nt students when it is \time to hand out honors,\ but also that the college does not support diversity since it doesnot distribute prizes across the board. At a quick glance, Mr. Paska's comments appear harmless and perhaps even legitimate; When we carefully dissect his argument, however, it becomes painstak- ingly clear that not only does he failto pr.ovideappropriate back- ground information for his asser• tions, but he also fails to recog- nize the very diversity that the prizes do, in fact, represent. Perhaps the most basic and logical point on which to focus involves the utter contradiction ~n which J?aska.,s_ argument is predicated. He refers to the stu- dent who received a \whopping five awards,\ and although he explains that he is in no position to judge this person~ s merit, he is virtually certain that other stu- dents came c/oseto tn.easuring up to the standards of these awards. Foremost, unless r misunderstand the entire process of winning and losing, men and women are awarded prizes not for coming close to .the required standards, but rather fo'f actually attaining them; Paska, himself, employs the phrase come close, never suggest~ ing thatother students were actu- ally as qual.ified. Furthermore, Mr. Paska does apparently judge this individual's merit although he has never even met, let alone been exposed to her overall aca~ demic penonnance. None of this matters; though-he is qualified to question, albeit subtlety, her merit merely because he thinks it looks suspicious that she won five awards. The second and, incidentally, more fundamental flaw of Paska's argument involves that lack ofinfonnation on which it is based. Obviously Paskabothered to ask no one about the actual se- lection process involves in Prize Day. He quickly touts the word diversity, of which he claims Union has none, and eagerly avers that a cross section of achieve- ments can be r~presented only with a cross section of recipients. We .. , unlike Paska's this letter is actually based en well-researched facts. Two ofthesepr-izes were based solely on grade point average. There is no discretion in either of these categories; both prizes were endowed on the basis ofthe GPA credential. Moving to the remain- ing thr-ee awards, we see that al- though one individual received all of them, quite a bit of diversity inhered in the allocation process. One award was selected by the pre~law advisor. Another was chosen by a committee consist- ing of members of the Political Science, Anthropology, Sociol- ogy, and History departments. The Women's Commission Prize was selected by a committee which contains members of each division. Not one person on any ofthe committees overlapped and not one individual was involved in the decision of more than one award. Essentially, five separate decisions were rendered pertain- ing to five separate prizes in five distinct categories. The only common factor was the recipient. I can think of 110 better way \to repr~seht the diverse efforts\ of students than by exerting efforts to incorporate a large number of faculty, from various fields, in the ~rize Day process. Of course, Paska opts not to mention this fact~ it is more fruitful and pro- ductive to suggest favoritism and imply unfair play. I find it striking that Paska is quick to condemn and allude to injustice, yetunable to furnish his readership with substantive facts. There is nothing more admirable than voicing an opinion in a pub- lic forum. But there is nothing more reprehensible and danger- ous as hand! ing as newsm isinfor- mation which is digested at face. value. As for Mr. Paska, if he is so troubled and distraught about Prize Day's representation of winning and losing, he should concentrate his efforts oh a fun- damental reorientation of the sys- tem. Maybe more than one per- son could receive each award. Or perhaps new awards could be in- stated tor different kinds of rec- ognition. In reality, though, we all know that he will do nothing of the sort. After all, this is the same person Who has no trouble crying foul, but cannot even take the time to substantiate his claims. RegardlessofPaska's inability to articulate thoughtfully and thor- oughly his position, one fact re- mains: no one \hands out hon- ors\; students earn them! And even Paska's sour, critical tone cannot change the fact that recipi_- ents deserve just as many pats on the back as they received. We Cali'Do - The'Flltu-re of Union Continued.~ ...

Eventually, the push off-cam- pus could spread in all directions. Lenox Road has been a source of conflict between Union and Schenectady, .because of the road's historic properties-some of which the College owns. How about designing a \Union mu- seum\ in one of the homes, where social science majors can create a historical project which re- shapes the city' sproud history by restoring a home as a museum with ongoing exhibits centered on the residence? In keeping with zoning laws and the history ofthe homes, Union could convert some property into offices and residences, but with some creative flair: dorms and offices could appear as they would a century ago when these h()rnes were con- structed. Students could live in a tmly historical home, the Col.lege could utilize these propertie.s withouthassles from the city, and the city's heritage could be well- preserved. . · Obviously, these are all big dreams, thought out quickly and not accounting for one major ob- stacle: funding. These few ideas I have aione would cost tens of millions, al)d they would take years of development before our administration 'could begin rais- ' ing money fordev~loped projects. But my point is stil\ this: Union is standing on the bri~ ofbecom- ing a \name school,': not the state's \best-kept secret\ Let's stop allowing this instit~~n to remain a \sleeper school\ (bor- rowing a term used in films. to describe an unknown movie which becomes a modest hit) and. capitalize on its rich and proud i history. Lefs use this school to our advantage. Many critics ar- gue that they do not want Schenectady to become merely a «college town,\ because its busi- ness history is too strong for that. While this may true, one thing ·must be recognized. before both the city and College slide: it is better for Schenectady to be a college town than a ghost town.

The Concordiensis is the only true watchdog at Union Col- lege. Despite its misinformed critics, The Concordiensis has al- ways been unbiased.

The by Robert Cohe-n Staff Writer W'hen I was asked to write a final dissertation for the -last Concordy, I could not pass up my last chance to make fun of the school. What was I to write about?

He began to look like \one of the guys\ as he raised havoc at the RPI hockey series with the students, and he sud- denly became omnipresent (there was one five-day stretch that I remember see~ ing Hull four out of five days). Since the announcement that the hockey teams are staying put, Hull has yet to falter badly. At the Alumni Council meeting, he raised some eyebrows when he dis- cussed his disappointment with Union's exit from the New England Small College Athletic Conference (NESCAC) twenty years ago. However, he helped bail out Dean Alford re- cently after the Coffeehouse lost their floor. Hull offered the Coffeehouse a Lenox Road property to house four of the students who were left in limbo after Alford and Residence Life awarded the floor to Tri-Delta. needs to continue focusing on the students, even when the ''bottom line\ may be slightly compromised.

He ap- peared at Student Forum meetings more than any other member of the admin- istration, showing his dedi- cation to student causes. · Other than that and his atten- dance of the Multicultural Awareness Group (MAG) meetings, he has kept a low profile.

Security When I was a freshman, Union had a crime problem. The gates were not keeping violent crime off campu.s, and security reacted to the problems immediately (emergency ph<me, light bars on cars, etc.). The last couple of years have brought overall calmer times at Union, and a lot of it is thanks to security's ef- . forts. I do fed a little safer with Union security guard- ing the. campu~. However, th-ere have been some questionable calls over the last year. Pursuing en- forcement of the \2am Rule,\ as I hawe stated be- fore, is not th.e smartest of moves.

Athfeties Union athletics have gone 1hrough rocky waters this year when it comes to struc- 1ures, but overall athletic e\Vents were promising. The Achilles Rink situation al- most pulled the1carp.et out Stude.nt Forum Mann}' Cunanan is a good man, and that was his fault this year as Student Forum President. He is too nice. Often, the Forum would step on him, making him look powerless (almost a figure- head), and he would allow too much to occur at times (though he often stopped bickering· before it became uncontroHab le later in is term). The other members were a mix of super nice to disin-· terested to power hungry. These d·iffeFences 'led to sev- eral minutes of irrelevant in- tegrity shooting ap.d overall ugly conditions. The F omm failed to act on many of its plans to try to save the rink for unknown reasons, and the Forum could not control ifs own Finance Committee at times. Man:y i:nemhers com~ plained that -it used to be fun to be on the Forum (they would still get policies pushed through while they had fun). This year became pa:inful for many of the for- merly motivated members, and that means that efforts were wasted. Unfortunately, this year's Forum gets a C+ for its overall efforts (though not all members deserve tis grade). For improvement: I think next year's Forum provides a solid base of experience and willingness to learn. If this is true, the Forum will be able to be a '\fun\ job again while the school ben~ efits from the policies influ- enced by the Forum. Listen- ing to the people that voted the members in, however, needs to occur a lot more. When students feel like they have losttheir voice9 they no longer will hold the Forum in high regards. Fin-ance. Committee ... . .. Patt of the reason the F o- rum got a C+ was becau,se some of the ill activity that occurred in the Finance Committee.· Again, not aU members were responsible for the ills, but some deci- sion always seemed to be at the forefront ofthe next Stu- dent Forum meeting. Thi~ caused the Forum to tread water, at times. While the Finance Com- mittee preaches fiscal re- sponsibility to clubs and . threatens not to endorse funds to those that do not· comply, the Finance Com- mittee needs to take some of its own advice. Fiscal re- sponsibility was lacking at times, this year, and this forced the \holding account\ to near $0. The Finance Committee has seen better days, and that is why it receives a C for this year. I admit that the mem- bers were dedicated to their causes, but their were some serious shortcomings in many categories that need to be addressed next year. For improvement: The Fi- nance Committee can avoid a world of problems if the members keep tabs on their assigned dubs' books. If a club starts to slip, major problems can be averted with a discussion with the club's leaders. The Concordiensis almost ended up in the red because nobody nipped the problem before it became a problem. Also, consistency will be neces- sary if the members want their decisions to be consid- ered legitimate by the Forum and the student body. IFC/Pan-Hel Exposure, exposure, expo- sure. The IFC apparently has realized that exposure is key to maintain public rela- tions. Even if the Greek newspaper next year fails, there is definitely a step in the right direction by the lFC occurring now. This goes for Pan-Hel as well. Pan-Hel needs to be care- ful about hpw much they bend on sorority rush, or they may begin to lose their autonomy ifthey bend to the administration too much. The IFC needs to work on the \2am Rule\ to go along with the new policy they are attempting to pursue con- cerning the number of guests allowed in fraternity houses. Greeks have had a rela- tively quiet year, but that does not mean that there is reason to sit back and relax. More activity and uniformity needs to be seen in the IFC and Pan-Hel for the organi- zations to be effective. This cooperation has not always been existent. The decent year gives these groups a combined B+ for the year. For improvement: Coop- eration and continued pub- licity are necessary. Theme House Consortium Exposure, exposure, expo- sure. I feel like a broken record!> but the THC has lacked this of late. The So- ciety (Coffeehouse) is essen- tially the only Theme House which C()nsistently adver- Hses their events, but others do not. This has led to na- ivete on the part of non- Theme House students as to the goals of Theme House on Union. Theme Houses need to be taken a little more seriously, or the administration may start to back off of their former pro- Theme House stance (right now, that stance is in limbo}. Theme Houses have refused to reach out to Greeks to share ideas and manpower this year, hurting both of their causes. Theme Houses, to their credit, had easy sailing over the first two terms of the year, and the rocky road may be a short-term phenom- enon. However, the THC receives a B- for the year as their trend is not up cur- rently. For improvement: Coop- eration and publicity are nec- essary here too. Cooperat- ing with Greeks in service events would help both or- ganizations grow. Ben Fox I could not let Ben Fox go unnamed un this issue of The Concordiensis. Ben has handled the digs made at him all year in a decent fashion (no pun intended).. Ben knows that if he complains a little, most people will not . push the envelope much furm ther, and that is why Ben bas grumbled ~ little bit during the last term.

Obviously, everyone has regrets, a list of \woulda shoulda, coulda's,'' as my high school lacrosse coach liked to say.

I ask you aU to consider the words of Dixon Ryan Fox, one of the greatest presidents of this insti- tution: A college does not belong to the living generation. save. that [or a time they own its opporlUnity. It's nearer to the mark to s.ay that th-e living generation of students and teachers beiongs to the college. Individuals who come by this opportunity, musttake on an obligation of trust. They may use the college, but they must not use it up. More than that, every good member adds to the strength and richness of the college tradition;for as has been ohsef'lJed, that tradition is the sum of the achievement of those who have lived and worked in it . .. It was a great institution long, long before you and I were ever thought of, and it will be a great institution long, long after you and I have laid down our labors; for it flourishes not as the single human lifo that grows and withers, but as an eternal light to America and to human- ity. We know it will be strong; but just what its strength shall be de- pends on us ... As for my legacy, that matters only to me and my ego. I know what I have done these past four years, and perhaps even those memories will fade with time. It has been my distinct pleasure and great honor to entertain, irritate, educate, inform, and know you all these past four years. I bid you all good luck and Godspeed. Say, \Good night,\ Jared.

Page I() •_l\lay 29·, 1997 ··Qfh, llhmnnoimsis . . · ---------~ Special rcaturc Union College's Mrs. Lorraine Marra: After serving the college during four separate decades, Mrs. She has been around Union longer than the Achilles Rink and most faculty members. The school turned co-educational after nearly a decade of her working at Union. However, she does not hold a position of immense power. It does not seem to bother her, though, and many students give her more respect than they give to most school officials. The woman described is Mrs. Lorraine Marra, and her 35 y·ears of service at Union are about to cotne to a close with her impending retirement at the end of this school year. by Frank Rossi Editor-in-Chief Mrs. Lorrain,e Marra worked at General Electric for a few years before she came over to Union College in 1962 for apart-time job. After the two-week position expired, the school called her in for more work. Thirty-five years after that call back, she has never looked back. She says, \[t was the best move that I made.\ Many people agree with that statement. Mrs. Marra quickly found her way to a Student Activi- ties position after working in other areas at Union. Her position has involved work- ing with thousands of stu- dents trying to improve the state of the campus. \It's been my life work- ing with the students. They've been wonderful, and they're a challenge; which we all need. They're very bright and our future leaders. I can't imagine an office on campus not work- ing with students.\ Memorable Moments For Mrs. Marra, there have been several memo- rable moments during her tenure at Union. The most memorable moment ofher 35 years came in the 1970's when the new position of \Director of Student Activi- ties\ became available. \They were looking for a director, and some of the faculty and a lot of the stu- dents felt why should they bring somebody in to pick my brains and not give me the position.\ The ad~inistration, how- ever, could not look past the fact that Mrs. Marra did not have a degree, With all of the student and faculty sup- Activities have move.d around. the campus several times over the last 35 years, but in the mid-1980's, the office found a pe~manent home in the newly-built College Center.

So Long, Farewell, It's Time to Say Goodbye ... Looking Towards the Uncertain TimesAhett;d by Michelle Tham Features Editor . A year ago I was decicling how to cope with leaving high school and fighting with the fact that 1 had to go to college.! didn't want to cmne here. I wanted to live in a warm, comfortable place that never surprised me and never felt anything Iessthan absolutely se- cute. Home was hard to leave, but my friends and family were pretty stable in their geography . . . I knew that they'd always be there in my little town waiting for me on the holidays. So,. 1 am looking around me now and something is so strange. The place I was pushing away from me for two months last sum- mer is so important to me now. These peo,ple I have found are spectacular. They fill my days with laughter, my heart with Well kids, this is.it--our last ar- ticle of the year. Try not to weep openly now, because this one's going to be great. Sorry about the little hiatus last week: we were a little preoccu- pied preparing ourselves for Springfest ... we mean studying for finals. Here are some of our thoughts about the past few weeks. Back to the topic of PDA. Yes, we know we have tocused on this one a lot lately, but it seems to be getting worse. It's a colossal problem here at Union, and the worst part about it is that now it's even more out in the open. We need to emphasize one thing--please refrain from making out in the dining hall. It's not pretty. No one wants to look over from the already-unappetizing food that they're eating to see two people blatantly mackin' it over at the potato bar. Enough is enough. Save it for the summer when we aren't sweet memories~ my head with dizziness from keeping straight all that's happening in their! ives. I came. to ·college and reaJ.ized how much 1 Iovepeople--so many ofthen:L I guess what I don't understand now i:; that some ofthese people have to leave me: They are going to some far off place that I can't even understand or fathom. 'In a time when I have finally found a way to live in college and deal with this form of:independence, my friends are finding another kind of freedom. :1 don't know if they are wel- coming the change or running from. it, but from my perspective graduation seems scary. My freshman eyes, however, don't always let me see too clearly. To be standing on the edge of adistantcliffwithahazy film of. air blocking the view-that is all I can ima,gine college graduation to be, J.n such an uncertain step around to see it. Next we want to address the topic of the much-awaited but kind of disappointing Springfest- -overrated. There were many unfamiliar faces.sprawled out on West Beach on Saturday, all claiming that they were visiting friends here. We bought this at first, butwe were deeply troubled to see these same people roam- ing around unassisted at parties later that evening. Thank good- ness those people were there to entertain us though .. Was it just us, or did the Pharcyde play for ten minutes? We went upstairs to get another drink at the beginning of the set and came back down to hear \Thank youtothewonderful state of Albany! Y()LL.'re a great crowd!~' Get these men an atlas please. Tell them to lay off the pipe ... something ... help ... anyone. Other than that, the show was · pretty good. We. especially liked towards true, unbridled adulthood there seems to be no turning back. What loomsahead is areal world, filled with buzzing alarm clocks that c~n 't be ignored, two o'clock mee.tings, electric hilLs; kitchenware and grocery lists. How wiU it aU be handled? How can someone possibly manage a world that they alone hold with their own hands? Then again, there may be an entirely different perspective that l am missing-one that 'I can't see because I haven't been through enough to understand~ after al:l, I just started loving college. Graduation may be a chance. It may be hope for the future and a bright place just beyond the. horizon that simply makes sense at this point in many people's lives. It is leaving the shadow of parental dependence and wal-king into self- sufficiency. I imagine that must be a good thing. So, I send them off. Idose my the free-style rap contest after'\ wards.

However, one ofUnion's own students has an arsenal containing covers of inany different music sryles and lots of original songs. Jun- ior Frank Barbarino is on his way up the ladder to songs--':Back in the·Tenth,\ \So Many Times,\ and \Shade of Grey.\ Barbarino correctly depicts his style as «pop· rock,\ and these songs show three different styles of Barbarino. \Back in the Tenth ' 1 is a slower song, instilling memo- ries ofhign school and times past. \So Many Times\ is a more up- beatsong, showing Barbarirto's r o c k edge. \Shade of Grey,\ which stardom, Barbarino and you d~scribes still have as a time to f'spiteful catch him.

So, as I sit 'here penning my final installment of T_hurberville, I must admit that I am overcome by a wash of emotion. What did it all mean? Is this going anywhere, and if so, do I have enough - fare for the tolls? Were Troll Dolls such a good idea? Why are car-crash programs and shows about neat fatal accidents so popular? How come I'm not aHowed to put any more money on my Val idine'? What are people who wear black fingernail pol- ish thinking? Is peer pressure really such a bad thing? Is it possible to go through · your -entire Union College career without being mentioned once in The Concordienst$? Is the space allotted in the Concordy inversely propor- tional to one's intelligence, or does it just seem that way? . . . You get the idea. At any rate, I have enjoyed my time writing for The Concordiensis. From my humble and optim jsti c beginnings as a fresh- man staff writer to the jaded, loud- mouthed, insulting, and petty ways of a senior, 'I feel that I have .come full circle; but mostly I was just . drunk, My predecessor Doug Bartell (a.k.a.

I suppose I could attempt a final dissertation on Fro-Yo, but there arejust sooo many flavors. Anyone who attended this past weekend's Spring Fest events undoubtedly had an enjoyable few days.

·Page 24 • May 29, 1997 • illl~l' oionrorbintsis Ans & [ntcnainment \The Lost World: Jurassic Park.\ Starldng Jeff Goldblum, Julianne Moore. Pete Postlewaite, Richard Attenborough. Directed by Steven Spielberg. Rated PG-13, Universal Pic- tures. Rating: ** (out offour) Shame on Steven Spielberg, who for decades has been enter- taining America with grand pop- com movies and making rni II ions in the process. Jaws, E. T., Close Encountersofthe Third Kind, the Indiana Jones Trilogy ... the list of films is endless; where his imme- diate presence is not known, his Amblin Entertainment company logo graces the credits of many other films. People were appalled when Spielberg had never re- ceived an Oscar for his work-- such oversight on one of America's biggest draws (and cre- ative entertainers) was corrected with the Best Picture award going to Schindler's List in 1993. Since then, Spielberg decided to take a fewyearsofffrom filmmaking. His return, four years after creating one of the decade's most sweep- ... ing films, is a journey back to rec- reating the sense ofjaw-dropp.ing wonder and eventual horror of cloning dinosaurs. What Spielberg has done, however, is create a ludicrous sequel that is mind-bogglingly awful in compari- son to its predecessor. In short, and to paraphrase the film's hero, chaos theorist Ian Malcolm (played by Goldblum, who yawns mostofhis lines), \this istheworst sequel in the history of bad se- qu~ls.\ So loosely based on Michael Crichton's novel that it needs the extended subtitle of \Jurassic Park\ justto help people remem- berit'sadino-flick, The Lost World is a dark, mean thriller which re- ally isn't for kids. Among the list of returning dinosaurs a're velociraptors and T. Rexs, and among the newcomers are stegasauri. The effects are seam- less~ one cannot see the differ- ence between animatronic crea- tures and computerized images very clearly. Crichton's novel--a sequel to t11e movie, not the first book--was not very good. The plot was pa- per-thin, the characters illogical, Steven Spielberg's First Film in Four Years .i.s a \Lost\ Movie, Indeed! and the unfolding ~ction did not seem to make for an exciting screenplay. It only had superb action sequences on its. side. Nonetheless,scl'eenwriter David Koepp threw the entire premise aside (good action scenes and aJil) in favor of creating new, more menacing characters (abig-game hunter played by Postelwaite) who want to trap the newly-found dinosaurs of Site B (the \produc- tion factory\ fi:om the first film, hitherto unknown) and bring them back for a stateside amusement park. Meanwhile, Jurassic Park creator Jolm Hammond (Attenborough) appears briefly to persuade Malcolm toretum to the region of the original island and conduct more research. The hook: M~lcolm 1 s girlfriend, Sarah Harding (M<JQre ), is already there, which enrages her overprotective theorist-lover. Instead of two kids, we nave one in this film: Malcolm:'s daugh- ter\ On the island, the hunters and the scientists keep their distance until Malcolm's crew discovers the evil deeds ofthe hunters and sets about fr:eei ng the trapped dinosaurs ... until the T. Rexs attack. What made the book a moder- ately interesting read was Malcolm'sd1aracter: he was alive with expl anati ons,justi ficati ons, and scientific reasonings. and his I ogical manner propelled him through another dino-sized night- .m:a.re. In the film, he is merely re- duced to a typical actioN hero, holding on to ropes while dan- gling precariously over a cliff He lacks a'll the fun his supporting role allowed him in the original ftltn. Moore is bland as his scien- tist-girlfriend, a plae co.mparjson to Laura Dem' s character .in the first film. But the real villain here is not the velociraptors, although their relentless pursuit of the heroes through the island is heart-stop- ping and pulse-pounding, Rather, it is Spielberg, who has made a mockery ofhis really inventive film franchise by turning the concept 011 its head .. The characters have no purpose, the inventive devices are not utilized much (the \high hide,\ for example, is a tree-!ine observation tower which the velociraptors cannot see--the book made Ltse of it), and even the blood flOwws down streams veryartifically. The film's.worst moment: when a T. Rex stalks the streets ofSan Diego. Whether this was i·ntended as comical, this moment throws any sense of bewilderment this film managed to recaptureuom the original right in thetrashoan. Sure, it's humorous to see a dinasaur stalk a major American city, but why not include some :of' the de- tailed visions ofT. Rex and his inate protecting the family on the island more, instead? Because it does notlook .as impressive to the viewer bred bytwistersand nour- ished by alien invasions ofNew York City. J.n an ageof impressive visuals. The Lost World has no choice but to top the competition. As a result, lie sacrifices true moviemaldng magic and alienates the viewers who appreciate his style--and l~ve his handling of delicate subject matter (the Holo- caust), It's a sad day when a man can develop a truly emotional ac- count of the Holocaust and can't even make a coherent thrill-ride adaptation .of a simple-to-read book.

Professor Miryam Moutillet, vis- iting guest artist in dance and Pro- fessor Hillary Tailn~ the chair of the performing arts department introduced the program Edward Villella: Recollections of a Dancer. section ef Jewels: Unfortunately, \Prodigal Son,'' one ofVillella's most exciting pieces, was not available on video. Villellll;, who was the first ' American male dancer to · perform with the Royal · Danish Ballet, was alsothe . only American ever to be asked to dance an encore at the Boloshi Theater ifi Moscow. He has danced for President Kennedy's inau- guration and for Presidents . Johnson; Nixon, and Ford. Villella's lecture focused on his. role in the dance world, Including training . with the School of Ameri- can Ballet. He also spoke of his career as principal · dancer with the New Y otk · . . . ties which has forced him to stop dancing. He admitted that al- though he is no long~r able to Balanchine, who choreographed many pieces for him at the New York City Ballet. As an Artistic Director, ViHella is now working with many <Jf Balanchine's pieces ami has begun to take them apart in order to teach them to his company. Through his work, Villel.la has realized the complex\ ityofBaJanchine's genius and each time he works through a piece he gains more appreciation for Balanchine·choreography. His work as a director and clloreograhper has inten· sified his I ove of dance. sional ballet schooling. The class wasals()an opportunity for quali- fied stl.ldents to audition for the Villella Fellowship. The fellowship is presented with the help of Union C<Jllege Alumni Charles Lothridge. This years Fellowship recipient was freshman Jennifer Jakbowski, who is currently en- rolled in Darlene Meyer's Ballet Practiclllfi class and w~ .:hosen following her audition. \I was very excited to have won the fellowship. I feel it is every dancers dream to work with some- one as accomplished as Edward Villella\ saidJakbowski, who will study at tile Miami City Ballet in the upco-ming year. The evening's program was made possible by the generosity of Charles Lothridge '44, and in- cluded a lecture and video presen· tation.

Flamenco dances and Span- ish songs into this production. There were many times when the characters spoke in Spanish and, along with the help ofUnion Span~ ish professors Pilar Moyano and William Garcia the actors and di- rectors were very sensitive to Blood Wedding's heritage. The success of Blood Wedding was achieved in its ascetic beauty which was accomplished T<· • lrnl,I<Tn very ctmvincing with her gestures. Greene had the only solo dance number in the play, which high- lighted her role as the servant. Tiggle, who pla~d the young man gave an enthusiastic perfor- mance as a confidant to Leonardo along wi~ Miller, who played the moon. Simple movements in the play became elegant gestures and the Spanish dances were framed by the poignant red and purple Ji,ght- ing.

Te.chnical director of the Yulman Theater, John Miller, used a combination ofprojection light- ing and blends of color to achieve a unique perspective on the play. \In other productions of Blood Wedding that I have seen, the em- phasis on blood was too strong, and in our production of Blood Weddingwetried to keep the em- phasis on the wedding and the beauty and brightness of such an event\ said Miller. And they did succeed, along with the striking set design by ar- tistic director Charles Brayle Steckler, the play was framed into a tragic story about the conse- quences ofunfttlfilled desires.

i I' Summer Vacation+ Fall Term+ Winter Break== agood long vacation from Union. I just figured that little formula out about a week ago. Though l' d been planning on going abroad next f~U for some time now, I didn't realize the full extent oflny vacation from Union until I pu~ in the context ofthe whole year. Ever since this revelation 1 I've come to two related conclusions: first, that I am now a much, much happier man, and second that I should probably write one last PlanetC-witil or without inspiration. Fully aware ofthe fact that this being the last issue, nobody wHI have the ability to reply to anything I write, I thoughtl might take advantage of this special protection from responsibility and list a few things I'd I ike to see changed hete at Union before I return. This list will be short, and not .especiaHy inspired, but it is the last dose of Planet C anyone will get for about six months (gooq luck-. withdrawal can be a killer). · 1. · New \Substance Friendly\ Dorms to comp1iment the ~'Substance Free'' ones:.· A Look Ahead to Some Much-Needed By Conor McKenzie Changes At Union The inequity•isobvious. Those who need to be sur- rounded by \sllbstances'' in their living space don't have anywhere neat the dorm options available to those who sh11n substances. Same ideas to make dorms more \substance friendly\ might include installa- tioQ of: a. c;:entral vacU1Jin retrofitted to become a \central hookah,\ or an independent- study hydroponics. lab 2. A raise and a promo- tion for Dean Williams. I don't need to.say much here. Trish works so hard to accommodate al'l students, and does so with so few problems and an undvaled degree of professionalism., that I think it's time fotherto move up (!>resident, Ambassador, Dhali Llama, Pope . _ . ?) 3. A new fleet of \pimped-out\ vans. Winning is half mental right? So, imagine the advantage that Union club sports wouldgain automatically just by showing up in the parking lot in otie of Union·s new pimp-style rides. Get some new vans with tinted windows,chromeexhaust, · custom-paint, velvet interior, . : hydraufjcs;,pi.Jrpl-e tlmescen~.,: lights for the under carriage, a hom that plays the Dukes of Hazard theme. instead of beeping, and ofcourse a kicking sound system, and soon all the other teams will feel so inad- equate that the various Union squads will be able to walk all over them. 3 1/2. An Amusement or Water Park instead of a Parking Lot at D•Phi. Though the parking situation here at Union completely and absolutely sucks, I'd still rather have a little rnore fun than a slightly improved parking situation. Being the flexible guy I am, I'll allow Roger to pick which one he considers most appropriate to build. 4. A new look f<w Union's Greek and Theme House System. Most of the houses on campus are in dire need ofa face lift, and myplim could be just the plasti~ ~urgeon they need. I think there-should be a inter- -\ - ' house exchange program, in the interest of improving.relations ' and increasing diwrsity. The program would run something like this (hypothetically speaking, of course}: two ' ' members ofKA move into Fiji, . two membersofFiji move into KA two from Ludlow move , into AD, and two from AD move down to Ludlow~the exchange would last one year. There might be a few problems, such as deciding who gets to tnove into the. sororities. but all in all it should be a fairly positive experience. Well, that's it ... I'd like to see all these changes completed by Decem her so that 1 can verify them before I again grace Union with my presence. I'm serious-1 wantto see all four of those changes made (well, except number 2. I was exaggerating_a little bit-giving Trish a governorship would pro'bably be sufficient).

This section will take a look back at a greatyear in Union athletics, away from the controversies and outside issues. This is a- tribute to lhe athletes, coaches, and supporters of 1996-1997 Union Athletics. Fall Sports by Frank Rossi Twenty years ago, it was un- thinkable that fall sports would be as successful as they are today, but in 1996, fall sports teams compiled the best composite win- loss record of the three terms .of sports. Inparticular, football (9- 1 ), field hockey (8-8), women's soccer(8-7-l ), voHeyball (19-14), women's tennis (7-6), women's cross country (3-3), and men's cross country (4-2) were at or above .500 during the fall term. The fall sport which always gains the most attention is Union football. The team presented an experienced defensive line and a relatively less..,experienced of- fense. However, both teamed up to bring the Dutchmen to a 6-0 record after the \Dutchm'en Shoes\ game against RPI. The following week, however, the Dutchmen could not beat their exhaustion or the offensive power of their opponent, as they lost to Coast Guard for the second time in three years. The loss proved pivotal as the Dutchmen, who came back in the following two games after trail- ing both Alfred <!_nd Carnegie Mellon well into both games, men1, however, just naving the chance to play in the state tour- nament, as heading into their last week of play, the team was 5-7. Men's soccer did not dose their season quite as well, as they lost their final three games. Their 6- 5-1 record quickly changed into a 6-8-1 record, insufficient for state playoffs. Field hockey started the season Dutchmen basketball team hafa tough season, finishing. in atie-:t{>r fifth place with Skidmore witlt a. record of 7 and 18 overall and four and eight in the UCAA. 1he Dutchmen were led by senior Doyin Richards, junior R<lb TeCarr, and sophomore RtJb Groelz. Union's future lo()ks bright as freshmen Zena Woldeyesus, Shane Cahill, and Scott, BtianRoy, and Travis Reap to carry the team next season. The women's team boasts a tre- mendous amount of talent in sophomores Jessica Goveia and Katie MacDowell, both bona ti.de runners who will lead the Dutchwomen team in 1997-98. The team. graduates co-captain Michelle Woodward and will look for Daniella Chiulli, Brenna could not run the table for an un- ...; defeatt,:~s~ason. Tl:-t;ir8::-l rt;.corq .

After struggling early, the Dutchmen defeated formerly-un- defeated Salve Regina for the title and a final 9-l record.- Coach John Audino will return his team to the field in early Sep- tember against Yale University in a preseason scrimmage. Audino will have a large nut to crack without the defensive prowess of linebackers Mario Maltese and Bobby Champlin and defensive backs Bill Mehleisenand Charrod Riley. He also will lose some scoring ability from the gradua- tion of running backs Shuron Morton and Justin Bourque and wide receiver Peter Buscemi. Women's volleyball also will be losing a senior star in Gretchen Voegler. A record holder in Union's volleyball, Voegler helped lead the team to a 19-14 record.. After a five-match win- ning streak midway through the season, the team Jost four of their final next matches. In the state tournament, the ninth-seeded Dutchwomen finished in respect- able ninth place. The team also placed third in the UCAA Tour- nament and won the Union Invi- tational earlier in the season. Women's soccer was also able to reach their state tournament this past fall. The team ended the season on fire, not losing one of their final four regular-season games. In the state tournament, Plattsburgh was too much fotthe Dutchwomen, and they were de- .feated 5-1. It was an accomplish- on fire with the experience of players like Stefanie Speanburg, Christina Jabbour, and goalie Rachel Rothschild. They began with a 5-1 record, three victories in overtime. The next games were touch-and-go for the Dutchwomen, as they went 3-6 in their remaining regular•season games. Their 8-7 record was also enough to get them into the state tournament, but a game Ithaca team defeated the Dutchwomen 4-1. Nextyear, theteamwill have a new head coach as this year's head coach, Marty Morrison, will be leaving Union. Both women's and men's cross country had excellent seasons as both finished at or above the .500 mark. In the state tournament, the women finished 12th out of 14 team.s (315 points}, and the men finished somewhat better, in sixth place. In NCAA Regionals, the women finished 16th cut of 18 teams, while the men had a great meet, finishing tenth out of 25. The men were propelled by Dave Riggi, who you will read a little more about in the winter and spring sections. AU told, the fall sports went a combined64-41-2 fortheterm,a winning percentage of6l percent {incJuding playoffs}.· Even though fall boasted the best record this year, it is not to take away from the other terms, where much improvement was seen in most sports. Winter Sports by Jonathan Gastbalter The freshman-dCJminated Rich Gilooly all had strong ro()k:ie- campaigns. The youn:g teatll, which will work hard in the off- season, has a strong character atld a will to play hard and win. Witl'1 one season under their belts, the rookies will mature and bring the team some well-deserved victo- ries in the 1997-98 season. Contrary to the men's basket- ball team, the Dutchwomen team had a front court saturated witll seniors .. Amy Dougherty, Amy. Hitz, and Tonya Caparello, the heart and soul of the team, all graduate in June, and they lwve some holes to fill. The team l!ad a tough season, finishing .last ill the league at 5-19 over~;tll and J- 1 I in the league. Aside from tbe bright spots of Dougherty, Hit:z. and Caparello, freshmen star Leah Oliveiri and first-year pla:y~r sophomore Mary Schultz btd solid seasons. It wiH be thesetw.() players who will be called on t() lead the team in the 1997-98 cain\- paign, as Oliveiri is a shooti11g threat and Schultz a defensive standout. With a fresh recruiti11g class coming in, Coach M.ary Ellen Burt will have a lot to lolJk forward to for the upcoming sea- son. The men's and women's track teams had a solid ·indoor track season. The men's team was led by Jason Jennings, Dave Riggi~ and Jason Go.ldberg. Jennillgs and Riggi both graduate in Jlln<l., leaving. a hole for the team~ as both were staples ofthe squad for four seasons. TheiJ,am willloCJk for Goldberg, as well as ju11lor MikeMartinand freshmen Ken11y Maguire, and Sara Qower to pick up the slack next season. The men \s and women's swim- ming and diving teams had an- other incredible season. The men's team finished for a third straight first in the Ne\\V York State and an exceptional fourth at nationals. The women's team also had a stellar season, finishi,ng third in the state and tenth in the nation. Leaving in June will be Kevin Makarowski, • Mike Humphries, Than Stuntz, Stephen Potenza, Alyson Mckee, Jackie Crane, CeCe Buchanan, and Heather Kanser. who have throughout their four years made this team what it is today. Fortu- nately, with the help of new cap- tains Brian Field, Matt Glogowski, Kelly Jamieson, and Megan McCarthy the team will continue to see the same or even better performance next year. Under first year and ECAC Coach of the Year head coach Stan Moore, the Skating Dutch- men had their best season in six years of Division I play. Behind junior all-American goal-tender Trevor ,Koenig, who boasted the best goals-against average and save percentage in the nation, giv- ing up only I .99 goals per game and stopping .934percentofshots against him, the Dutchmen went on to finish the regular season at 11-8-3 in the ECACand 18.-ll-3 overall, tied for 5th with Princeton. The Dutchmen lost in the semifinals of the playoffs to RPI. The Dutchmen lose 13 se- . niors: Andrew Will (the co-win- ner of the ECA C Best Defensive Defense,man award), Greg :Buehanan, Bill Moody, and Seabrook Satt:erlund on the blue- line, and forwards John Sicinski, 1 00-point scorer Chris Ford, Jay Prentice, Patrick O'Flaberty, Craig Reckin, Jamie Antoine, Chad Thompson; Russ Monteith, and Ryan Donovan. Union will look to captains Charlie Moxham, Mark Szucs, and Ryan Campbell as well as to Brent Ozarows.ki to lead the Dutchmen offensively in 1997-98. On defense Union will rely on sophomores Mark Will and Joel Bond as well as fresh- men Neil White and Jeff Sproat to be strong around the net. With a large number of recruits com- ing to the team in the fall, the Dutchmen have a bright future ahead ofthem. In recent Skating Dutchmen news, sophomores goaltender Leeor Shtrom and defenseman Joel Bond and senior Ryan Donovan were selected after atry- ' out to play for the Canadian team in the Macabee Games this sum· mer in Israel. This will bethefirst time that hockey will be played at the games. Bond is excited about participating in the games and about playing with profes- sionals. \I think it is going to be a memorable experience, and I am looking forward to playing with ' some ~rofessional's and' being coached by Jacques Demers.\ Demers is the former coach ofthe Montreal Canadians. Spring Sports by Geoff Sullivan The spring sports· season·was one where young teams gained valuable experience at the colle- giate level. Every team, with the exception of baseball, had a los- ing record during the spring. While this may be disap.pointing in some regard, many positive signs resulted as the young teams gained more and more experience each time they took their respec- tive fields. Baseball finished its season with a Union College record of 18 wins. Due to various weather - problems, the team was forced to- play on short notice many times, and quite frankly may have been even a better team than their 18- 16 record indicates. Their season ended with a 9-6 loss to ·Binghamton in the ECAC semi- finals, but fans are already begin- ning to generate excitement for next years team. Juniors Jeremy Lamb and Ryan Smith will lead the team offensively next season. Both had outstanding seasons, and along with returning pitchers David Kline and Craig Kazmierczak, should form a solid nucleus iri producing one of the ·strongest clubs the team has had in q.uite some time. Men's lacrosse had a vary rig- orous schedule that included some of the top teams in the east, such as Middlebury and Will- iams. Unfortunately, the team · continued on page 31

SJ>m·ts . , -: 'Ztrl c <!Iuucoroicns1s • May 29,.1997 • PHge 31 This was such a· monstrous week, and especial:ly weekead, in sports that I am going to cover as rnuch as I can, but not as exten- sively. Detroit vs. Pbilly. Before the NHL Play{)Jfs started eons ago, 1 gav~ 11ry pre- dictions right here in the '~Q\ Ball that the Red Wings a11d Flyers would meet el'l.ch other in the Stanley Cup Finals. Phaladel=phia closed out the Rangers in five games on Sunday, and my Jlick to win itall,.Detroit, defeated tl~eir arch-rival Colorade ·iii a grueling six-game series. The first game of the Finals starts on Saturday evening, and I alh not goin,g to change my preqiction nt>w,. so look forthe Red Wings to winthe series and to hoist Lord Stanley in the air in game six. The Rocket Roger Clemens became the major leagues' first nine-game winne~: on Monday night~ all.ow- ing four hits in seven i11nings as the Blue Jays defeated theRaj1g- ers 8.,.1. Clemens -(9-0) gave up one run, struck out seven in win- ning his sixth stFaigh.t in a tow, and lowered his ERA t(} a minus- cule 1.81. Clemens rec()rded h. is 200tli win in New York the week before. His start this season is very reminiscent of his best start. in 1 fJ86, when he went 14-0with the Red·Sox, Mourlaing Guaranteed Win Miamf avoided elimination Monday afternoon, and a sweep party by Chicago; by winning 87a 80. Alonzo Moumirig.guaranteed that the. Heat would win this game. No team has ever come back frorn ·a 3·0 deficit but . ' - . . ' Alonzo backed up his talk with 18 points and 14 rebounds. Til'n Hardaway -broke out of a series shtmp to score 25 points, 1 8 of them in the. first half Miami looked tnuch more rel·axed and played with nothing to lose, thanks to a nightmarish shootii1g game by Mr. Jordan. Michael missed 20 of his first 22 shots before finding bis range and lead- ing a fourth,quarter come-back. He scored 20 of his 29 points in the final quarter and accounted for all hut three ofthe BulJ's points in the quarter. Chicago got within withonewith2:171eftbut.could not ov~rtakethe Heat. Gatne five is Wednesday night back in Chi- cago. Look for the Bullsto close out the series then. Princeton: Lacrosse Claamps Ptinceton sp~inted toa &-0 lead in the first qT.:larter Mond:ay and coasted to a 1 9-7 win against the Terrapins to win its sec<md con- secutive NCAA men's lacrosse championship and fourth in six years. Jon Hess, a junior attackrnen, led the way with three go'als and five assists and for his efforts was chos~n :the most out~ standing player. The Tigers are led by their attack tl}reesome of Hess, Jesse Hubbard, and Chris Massey, who .are all j:uniors. Hubbard had.fourgoals and three assists, and Massey scored: three t,Jmes. The attack threesome has combined for 100 poir.~ts in its eight career NCAA tournament gatnes. Congratu.Jations to the Princeton Tigers for winning their second consecutive NCAA La- crosse Championship! Utah-Honstort T.ied at Two Thanks to the heroics ofEddie Johnson, the Rockets evened up their best of seven .series at two with Utah with garne five sched- uled for Tue·sday night. On a bro- ·ken play with one-tenth of a sec- ond left on tl1e clock, Johnson heaved up a three.,pointer five steps behind the three point line. The shot swished t11rough the b~­ ket, and it stunned the Jazz, who won the first two games of the series easily in UtaJ1. Johnson's perfonnance came on the heels of an electrifying perfonnance in game three. He was mired in a · huge slump throughout the play- offs, but in game three he nailed fivethrees ina 12 f()r 17,31 point explosion coming off the bench in a 118-lOO Houston victory. It is now abest-af-threeseties with two ofthe games in Utah. I look for the Rockets to carry their momentum into game five and win the series in six games. Barkley Blasts Storm and NBC In an interview 011 Saturday with NBC's Jirn Gray, Barkley said '\a lot\ of his veteran Hous- ton teammates were 'Liackadaisi- cal,\ but noted that Eddie Johnson, Sedale Threatt, and Kevin Willis had a \sense of ur- gency that 1 feeL\ Storm, who had done an ad1nirable job filling in for Bob Costas, deduced from these comments that he was talk- ing about OI~juwon, Drexler, or Mario Elie. When Drexler con• fronted Charles on Sunday on who his comments were directed towards, Barkley blasted Gray and Storm and suggested he would not work eveutually work for NBC, despite an earlier agree- ment. Charles made some outrageous comments towards Stonn by say- ing \women should not be an- nouncing men's sports.\ He was definitely out of I ine in his re- marks, but this is notthe first time Charles has been outlandish in his comments and feelings towards people. Hopefully, in the futureCharles will leam to keep some of his thoughts to himself, because nei- therhe nor Houston need this type of distraction in a series tied at two with a best of three remain- ing to get to the NBA Champion- ship.

In four of the team's los:ses;·· Union was only defeated by ()ne goal. While the season may ap- pear to be a disappointing one, every game was excitfngtowatch with the exception of the first game loss to Hartwick, 19-l . Se- niors Jason Pinney, Justin Perkins, Dave PaFrott, and Chris DeLano will all bemisse<i, astl1ey had treinendous careers at U 11ron.

Going 5-7 for a young squad certairtly can be looked upon as a successful' sea- son. The core of the team returns, which can only improve now that the players ha veat least or.~e year of experience under their belts. Junior Lauren Pastor l1ad a tre- mendous offensive year that has put her into a position.to become Union'sal1-time goa:! scorer next year. The team also returns jun- ior Liz Kittleman and sophomore Sarah Moss; who were key play- ers for the Dutchwomen this past season. Freshmen Abby Harris and Sam Rya1l will be expected to contribute with their strong play on the field arid help lead the team back into the post.:season play. With a new C()ach next sea- son, the Dutcllwomen have a bright future ahead Qfthem. Softball had a disappointing season with a record of 9-23-1. The season began in Florida, where the Dutcbwomen were only able to win tw() out of nine contests. Fmm tllere, the team was not able to respond, losing their next seven out often games. A bright spotfor the team is that many of the players will be re- turning next season to help the Dutchwomen find their winning ways. Sophomores Taryn Samol and Carrie Heroth will be counted on for leadership both on and off the softball field, as will junior starting pitcher Danielle LaCrosse. Both men's and women' strack had to deal with weather condi- tions that left both teams with only one scoring meet, i11 which both teams lost, to Hamilton early in the season. The UCAA meet at Union was ca11Celed, and the RPI Invitational was a non-scor- ing meet. Senior Dave Riggi fin- ished a tremendous four-year ca- reer and will certainly be missed next season. With many of t)Je a.thletes returning, track should be just as strong 11ext season. Men's tennis finished tbe sea- son going 5-6. A relatively young team, the Dutchmen were led by senior Sam Berger and junior Jor- dan Pinsker. Pinsker, who will be at Albany Med next year, has not announced whether he plans ~o play again next season for his final yearofeligibiJity. Ifhe does, the Dutchmen should have a strong team for next season. Freshman Jared Sheikh will be counted on to continue his win- ning ways, and along with fresh- man Josh Winograd, 'Will be looked at as a leader on the Dutch- 111en team. -INTO MOJO PHOTO FOR SUPER SAVINGS!
