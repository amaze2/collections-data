The stude.nt doing the research project had first approached Mik.eWinn, President of the Student Forum, but Winn delegated authority to Andy Markowski, one of the co-cllairs of the election board. In order to conduct the study, positi()nS were placed on the bal- lot that did not exist. There are no positi()ns at Union College named Student- Assistants to the Dean of Students, Dean ofFaculty, or to the Alunrni Council. Neither the Dean of Faculty, Dean of Students, nor the Alumni Council were made aware of these elections, an<! had nothing to do with them. Dean AJford went as far as calling around the college to find out what was going on. Secondly, these positions were placed on tile bal- lot without the consent oftllree of the-five members of the election board, a body whose job is t() \ad- minister referenda, surveys, and Student Forum elections,\ (Stu- dent FQrurn Constitution Article X, Contilmed on page ti ·Election gate Study's Defense Freshmen Winners . - .

In addition to his elec- tion:, there was a general election for which the entire student body was. ~ligible to participate in should they have chosen to do sa. A to- tal of five questions 'were on the baU()t in the special election, two referendum questions and three other positions. The two referendum questions wer~ regarding which type of aca- demic calendar students preferred. At th.e :request of the student fo- rum, these questions were devised and ])iaced on the ballot in an· at- tempt to gain better insight into stucle11t sentiment on this issue. F()ilowing these tw() referenda · questions, the remaining three po- sitionts might have seemed quite mysterious to some.

However; neither these po- siti()ns, nor these students, exist. This portion of the election in fact served to facilitate an i11dependent study carried out by a· student in . conjlll1ction with political science · · Professor Richard Fox.

Since Union freshmen have only been together for a single term, she feels it is crucial to establish adass focus and for freshmen to come to·- gether and to truly think of t!J.em- selves as a class rather than 540 individuals. Her campaign stra1egy was almost a polar opposite of most of her competitors. While sarely everyone saw numerous posters with campaign slogans and pic- tures littered all over the campus center and dormitories, Pooja did not approach her campaign this way and instead took a more per- sonal approach. \I'm a really outgoing person by nature.. The first couple weeks it was my personality to meet people and that is what I think helped me the most. I took advantage of those first couple of weeks to get to know many people in my class.\ Pooja closed her comments to the Cvncordiensis with a strong message to her class. \I'm a dedicated and fo,used person and if there is something I am responsible for, I won't carry out that responsibility half heartedly. It is all or nothing for me and I [will] put all of my effort in to it.\

The debate was held at the Phi Gamma Delta fraternity house as part of the ·Symposium's weeklydiscussions. This week, the question pre- sented was, \Is Union Caught in the fifties?\ It was brought about by a co.Uege magazine statistic la- beling Union as one c>f five schools caught in a time warp. · . The discussion was open to the entire campus and members of the Ctlffee House; Phi Gamma Delta, the Symposium, Theta Delta Chi and a number of independents were present. In addition to the students, three faculty members, Professor Scullion. Professor Feffer and Dean Alford, attended the discussion, The discussion began with questions about racial tendencies. Many wondered whether or not Union is attractive to minorities. Several students felt that it was not only the responsibility of admis- sions, but that of the entire admin- istration andstudent.body to make the campus more diverse and ra- cially .interactive. The discussion was soon swayed to male/female relations and whether single sex. options on the campus are tooal>l.Uldant. The idea that males and females must live separately was defmed as out- dated and many re,ruested more options where both sexes can co- exist. Members of the community par- ticipated in a mature, intelligent fashi<>n. to keep the discussion lively and substantive. Eventually, matters again swayed somewhat away :ftQm the original topic. Social options were discussed and the Greek system was ques- tioned. Instead of an intense, heated argument, the discussion remained calm and ~11 sides pre- sented thoughts abo11t the current social state ofUnion and its future. Many took this o-Jl!Portunity to question people theynormally do not see face to face. A!Jsides made relevant points and tlt<e debate re- mained a mature foruoo for discus- sion. At the event's con<ilrusion, many felt relieved and more accepted by other members ofth.e.catnpus.

This visit was part of a larger <ampaign visit in support of Schenectady's cur- rent Mayor AL Jurcy-nski, who is running for reelection this year. The overall intent of the governor's visit to Schenectady was to support the may.or by ex- amining and praising the relation~ ship between the college and the city. President Hul1 met with both men on Huron str,eet and dis- cussed the Union..,S~henectady ini- tiative to revitalize the college park neighborhood. Governor Pataki seemed genuinely impressed with the current relationsl1ip between the college and the city. At a news conference later tbat day at city hall, he pledged his support for the project as welf as <tlle relationship that has develope·d between Presi- dent Hull and MayorAl Jurcynski. The highlight <()f the visit for Uni<;>n College stucteats, more spe- cificidly the CreVI te~ came when Governor Patak:i~d ,JJ.e mayor vis- ited the boat ihollse. The boat house is in the !historic stockade district and is gellierallyrecognized as on of the mO<Ie: p()sitive addi- tions to that area in recent times. The waterfrotlt is often key to redeveloping an,l .. redefming a city. Cleveland rece:tJtly updated its waterfront and !Las seen increased prosperity as a result. Albany is also working to tlevelop its own waterfront along: tbe Hudson river. At the boat hous~ there was gen- eral talk of wayst(). improve the area along the Mohai'Vkriver. Although it 'INas. nd: specifically mentioned, thereis tile possibility that the park alom~ the: river will be extended further down so that it runs directly to the boat house. Although he was on a tight schedule, the governor did briefly ·converse with some of Union's · Varsity rowers. He solicited Senior Robert Hoppenfeld's opinion • about the change in the city,- tn response, Hoppenfeld stated, \Overall there .is a better feel to the city.\ The g()vemor appeared to like that response and continued to talk about that better \feeling\ that Robert ha.s experienced. Governer Pataki 's visit was a success because it helped to high- light the positive relationship be- tween Union College and the City ofSchenectady. Hopefully,regard- less of the res:ults ofthe elections, the college will still enjoy an excet:- lent relationship with the mayor-'s office. It is also a matter of pride for the crew team that they are involved in a program that is part of the posi- tive change now occur in Schenectady. C.O.C.O.A.

Tuesday, the club sponsored a trip to Proc:tor' s The- ater to. see the play Annie. There were 30 bigs and littles sitting to- gether in the theater for the perf or- mance. Annie is a hear!VI'arming story for kids of all ages to enj.oy, and it was clear by the standing ovation that everyone at the show enjoyed ·it One of the Littles sta,ted, \Sandy was my fav(}rite part ·Of the show.\ The attention the dog receivedfromthe crowd was a sure sign ofh()w the dog stole the heart~ of the. audience.

There was pumpkin paint- ing atTri-Delta, a haunted house at Fiji, and aHalloweeupizza party/ dance at Chi. Psi oil Satqrday. Again, about 3-0 bigs and littles showed up for the event.

A few weeks ago you may remember ran· dom women kn-ocking on your door.asking you for pennies. A signjficant amount of money was raised with illis penny drive, however more. funds are still needed! Delta Gamma recently met with the Resident Assistants in Richmond House and they have agreed to help organize a penny war between the four floors in the building. Each floor wilt have their own container and for every penny that is deposited in these contain- ers the floor will receive positive points; however, for every quar- ter nickel dime or dollar that is de- pgsited in the containers the floor will loose that many points. For example, four pennies and one quarter in a container would give a floor a total of negative 21 points. In the end, the sisters of Delta Gamma will collect all of the . donations and determine which floor is the winner. In addition to this fundraiser, Delta Gamma will also be selling cookies and milk for finals in the campus eoenter Tuesday th1C>ugh Thursday of tenth week. Students can place an or4ier to have mini-milk and tbree ccokies delivered to their friends cloors be- fore final exams.

Moreover, the rationale behind hazing practices is the same in both fraternities and sororities, Westol travels to hundreds of campuses yearly to spread his message to the Greek system, ''Hazing has got to go. [The Greek . System] has to do with helping people become better people.\ He. believes that the ftrst casu- alty ofhazing is that what it is sup- posed to accomplish, it does not. Hazing has little to do with the Greek system; it is a direct cause of the human ego. Westol suggests that hazing is one's \human nintendo,\ a pro- cess used to protect the ego and manipulate the minds of others to the point of total and utter embar- rassment and humility. Westol ex- plained that he is not at all against the Greek system, he believes that fraternities and sororities are won- derful organizations dedicated to the campus community and the advancement nf involvement within its members. The sisters of Sigma Delta thank the members ofthe Greek commu- nity who attended tonight's work- shop as well as the brothers of Phi Gamma Delta fen co-sponsoring this event. 150 ll.and-written invi- tations were extended to the fac- ulty, and to oUI utter disappoint- ment, only .one member attended.

A traditional meal was served - tacos with met, rice, and beans, followed by dessert-to the tunes of Ricky Martin, Salsa music~ and Mexican rhythms. The festivities also included a pinata to fulfill the candy custom that is commonly associated with Halloween. Students who are travelling abroad to Spain or Mexico were able to gather and discuss their up- coming trips. Others not spend- ing the wt11ter tehn in a foreign country could simply relax, have a good meal, and enjoy a bit ofSpan- ish culture. All of this cost attend- ees three dollars off oftheir declin- ing balance. Candice Tilhnan and Clare Cantwell, the co-presidents of the Spanish Club, led this aptly planned event. They figured that many parties had already been scheduled for Halloween weekend, and did not want the program to interfere with these other gather- ings. The timing of \El Dia de los Muert()s\ was perfect because stu- dents could easily attend and not miss any social activities on Fri- day or 'Saturday night. Candice noted that there was a decent hlrnout at the dinner, most likely due to the fact that it was on a night when most people were free. This was for the most part, how- ever, expected. The Club usually attracts a g<Jod number of people. For this parti<;u- lar event, though, they couldn't advertise as much as they wouJd. · have liked because the Club was limited by the amount food to be ordered and prepared.

Page 8 ·November, 4 1999 · C!IllltC.ro:hiellsis t Show Your Support Last week, the women's soccer team hosted the first round of the New York State Soccer Championships. The sidelines were two-deep, and ex.cited fans were diligently cheering for their horne team. However, this was one of the first times these women re- ceived such enthusiastic support. In fact, this was the first time this tenn that any Union athletic team, excluding football, received a significant amount of fan support. The fall season is a perfect tirne for students, faculty and staff alike to support the Union teams. Field Hockey games bar~ly attract a handful of fans and a popular sport like football strnggles to fill the · grassy hill behind the visitors' bench, with the exception of Home- coming weekend. So why is attendance so poor? For the past ten weeks, eight varsity teams and two club teams . have been holding athletic competitions at Union College. They have been held on the soccer field, the tennis courts, the football field, the rugby field and the Field House, all within walking dis- tance of every residence hall as well as :all 0ff-carnpus housing. Game times and locations are advertised throughout the school and can also be found on the Internet, both of which make the informa- tion readily accessible. Anyone who is an athlete or who works closely with a team un- derstands the time commitment involved in becoming a member of one of these organizations. Each season, ath.letes put countless hours into perfecting their technique and honing their skills in order to become a greater asset to their team. When all the numerous . hours of practice finally come into play and athletes find themselves in competition with another team, it is heartening to lock up and see an enthusiastic group of supporters. On Friday night, the hockey team will kick off their home cam- paign with two ECAC games against Colgate and Cornell. Last year Cornell had more fans at Achilles Rink than Union, and their band drowned out what was left of the Union faithful, taking our home ice advantage. Tickets to these games are free to students, faculty and staff, yet based on the attendance of these games, one would think that ticket prices had soared through the roof. We can only hope that the fan support for winter sports is not a repeat of the behavior exhibited this fall. Union athletics are not · only fun to watch, but also a way to escape the burden of the classes and homework.. They offer the chance to sit back and relax · with friends while cheering on peers as they strive for athletic ex- cellence. This weekend provides a perfect opportunity to show your sup- port. There are two hockey games, a football game, and a swim meet. The football team is vying for a playoff bid, the hockey team is looking to start the ECAC season on the right skate, and the swim team is kicking off their season with the annual relay meet. We encourage you to leave your rooms and cheer on the Gamet and White.

This past Friday An election was held for three new positions to stu- dent forum. For those of you who did not get out to vote the new positions consisted of Student as- sistantto dean of faculty, Student assistant to alumni council, and Student assistant to dean of stu. dent affairs. These positions were up for election along with the fresh- man Class representatives, and a .poll on the trimester system that our school follows. I did not personally know about any of these elections, aside from the standard freshman class elec- tions, till I picked up my copy of the Concordensis on Thursday the day before the elections. I was upset to find out about these new positions had been created for the student forum, and wondered why no one in the school had know about them before Thursday. As I read the Concordiensis to find out about these freshmen I had seen flyers for in every conceivable plate on this campus, I wondered why I had not seen flyers for these other positions that I never even knew existed. The speeches seemed normal though no one had mentioned the duties of their posi-- tion, or that it was a new pasition. Also this poll on our current aca- demic system that I didn't even know was being voted on till a friend confronted me in the cam- pus center on Friday. I know many people that voted <m Friday were baffled. The 2 voice mails that were sent out late Thurs- day or Friday morning also both- ered me. I did not think that the student body was that apathetic that we needed to reminder:s to vote, especially ifthe election. was so important that we only found AM out about it on Thunda.y. The 24- question exit poll that I was bad- . gered iii to completing was also odd.-Nonnallythese exitpolls are short and to the point asking whom you votedfor; nc one really cares why. Then on Saturday night, as I was enjoying myself at a Halloween party, it was broughtt() my atten· tion that these three new positions a hoax, they were an eJCperiment to see if the students on this campus were involved in the politics around campus or if we were apa- thetic and voted randomly.

I wouldb~ fine if it was sorneones senior experiment, but they would need to ask for con- sent from the students that they used and they did aot. As a union college stildent I have a right to vote if it is. a matter that effects me and the elected body that represents me as well as the other students on this campus. But it is no ones right of anyone to cre- ate an experiment at1.d not ask the people involved for consent. What disturbs me evell more than this experiment is tha:t the student forom had to have gone along as supported this experiment. The positions were supposedly stu~ dent forum positions, and they were run by the student forwnalong with the freshman elections. The mle of the student fonnil is to :re])re- sent the student body and pmtect its interests, not consent for :it to be used iii an experiment to pr(}ve that union _students are ign()rant, . and .apathetic. I know that the damage hasb~en done, and I think every stu<lent that did or didn't vote. should be outraged. I wouldmostlike tos~e the perpetrators of this experiment come forward and apologize. A formal apology would, it wouldnot rectify the situation, but how can you trust someone who uses y-ou with out your permission in an e)C- periment. I do not pay my tuition for anyone to take advantage of me. Another solution is to f~ll()W democratic procedure, and make changes to the .student forum elimi- nating the elements that supJJorted · this experiment. I feel that the student p<lpala- tion has been pushed around long enough and I am not asking for a total riot, or even a demonstratio0n, but we are bring taken advantage of by they bureaucrats of this school and its not right. I ern not think of anyone I know, or fo:r that matter anyone on this campu:sthat can say that they would liket()pay $33,000 a year to be told wbai to do and what is best for them by a bunch of professors, or adminis- trators.

The letter asks for su~gestions as well as supplying a copy of the advertise- ment that will run in the Chroniclf3 of Higher Education, Black Issues in fligher .Education, and His- panic Out[ook. The letter was signed by Freel Alford, Dean of Students, Atm Anderson of the Mechanical En.gineering Depart· ment, Leuisa Matthew of the Vi- sual Arts Department, Robert Wells, Ch.arrofthe Committee and member ()fflle History Department~ _Tom Werner of the Chemistry De- partmentandJulie Wittekind, Presi- dent of the Sophomore class. The advertisement is very dir¢ct. It describes the qualities that are desired of a candidate, the me~od of application, and where the ap- plication is to be sent. Then, below the address, is a single sentence: \Union Collelleis firmly committed to Afflrmative Action and strongly encoure1ges women and those who are mem- bers of minority groups to appl::y.\ The inclusion of this Sentence in the advertisement is destructive to a·searcllfor the most qu;:ll:ified candidate. In the event that .th.e in- dividual who would best .seNe as Vice President and Dean ofFaCJal1y Affairs is a white male, then Iiley have been discouraged from apply- ing. I cannot imagine many wfli.te males that would apply for a JlCsi- tion after being told thatthey h~ve a mark against them simply be~ cause they were born a membe1 ()f the majority. It w9uld appear that the stu- dents, staff and faculty are lefto!lly to hope that the best candidate is, in fact, a member of the min()r-ity. We must count on luck, bec11ase the schoolllas managed to sh:ink the applicant pool unnecessarily. The Affirmative Action policy that exists in the United States does not help to alle'Vhateracial tensions. A white man watching a job he is qualified for go to a member of a minority groupj and knowing that he did not ha-ve a fair chance at earning the position, only helps to breed contempL I do not see how allowing for the gender and racial majority to expe:rience life from the perspective oftllose who were bi- ased against in the past can possi- bly be called ptogress. Rather, it seems as thoug:h we are promot- ing bias, only n()w we are making it legal, and changing the victims. In the end we w:ill have a society in which the numoers in the workforce are proportiona;lly correct, yet the bias still exists, perhaps. even stron~ ger. The person who eventually eams th(fpositi()n ofVice President and Dean of F:aculty may be the most qua.lifie<i individual. I think that the campus at large, however, would feel beiterknowing that the process was unbiased,. and that the best candidate 9/as dissuaded from even applying.

p An Auspicious Beginning After I had cast my ballots in Friday's 'election', I tried to walk away, and was acc9sted by a man with a clipboard and a pep. IIi the tradition of Frank Rossi and Union exit polls, I thought that I would fill it out, and move on. After I asked the pollster whom he was working for, he told me that he was doing it for the Political Science Department. After consulting the chair of said department, I can as- sure the students of Union College that this was not the result of the Poli-Sci Department, but in fact it turned out to be a research project ef an individual student who was working with a member of the de- partment. My initial response to this situa- tion was that there were three new positions created, and I had never heard of them. I decided to look into t:his, and heard one particular rumor several times, which con- cemed these positions previously being work-study positions, and in an effort to save money, the col- lege decided to make them elected positions. Now, any Union Col- lege student could believe this, es- pecially because it Iists-.the moti- vatinn as saving money, but that answer didn't satisfy me. l kept going becaus.e. not only were the positions brand-new, but the can- didates for them had been put forth, so said the rumor, by the deans' offices and the alumni board. I'm not used to Russian style elections where the people in charge put a name on the ballot and everyone else votes, so that rumor did not stop me. Another part of the rumor was that the seven can- didates were all Freshman Honors students, and the fact that the gen- eral student body was not able to run for each position pushed me even tilrther. This was the point that I got an anonymous tip, telling me to fol- low the names. Well, the names were the falling point of this rouge. I tried several times to contact these· candidates' by phone, to no avail. 1000 and 3333 were not working, so I then consulted idol, so as to send them each an email. That also failed, and then I started thinking more about a conspiracy. I then consulted the 2003 Fresh- man Record (the Facebook), a pic- ture book containing most of the Freshman class either in picture or text form. None of the seven 'can- didates' were contained within, and at that point I concluded that these people do not attend Union College. Odds might make itpos- S1ble to not be listed in the Facebook (i.e. Dan Tiegman, 2003), but to not have an email file or to be listed in Teleco:mmunica- tions I would deem impossible. rfhe Plot Thickens After consulting Shelly Ducatt, the Student Forum Advisor as well as director of Student Activities, concerning the event, I was told that \there is no story here.'' Mrs. Ducatt, 1 beg to differ. There was dent -w.orldng on a research project, were Of) the ballot. Presently there is a general malaise that effects most oftlie campus, and if Student Forum VI ants to change that I would recommend putting leaders on the baUot instead ofghosts. In the past,. Student Forum has had someles:Sthan inspiring initiatives and in tlte eyes of a n-umber of stu- dents, tb.ey 'waste' their budget, which tops $100,000. These are supposed to be the best that our student_hody has to offer, and when' student leaders' deceive the electorate on this level, it upsets any serr1blance of trust that ha:d ma,y hav-e been held in our elected representatives. If they thought students were apathetic before, whatdicithey expect to getto hap- pen by d:eceiving the entire student bod:y with a phony election? On Ivlonday morning I jour- neyed d.own to the office of one Terry Weiner, ch? irman of the Political Scier1ce Department. I had a s11ort chat with Professor W eineH:oncerning the 'election • ,. and l.after I had asked him if he knew anything about it, he gave me wha.t seemed to be an honest answer that he had no knowledge ofany suspicious goings on. I had to explain to him the details of the student elections on campus, and he saidthat he would be quite sur- prised ifa.nyone in his department was irrvolved in any such incident. I also asked him how he thought such a tl1ing would happen. He said tlut.t it would probably take more than just an act of subversion to pull off such an act, but the people in charge of the election wou:ld need to be \asleep at the wheel\ 1D not notice something of this level going on. In the elecJion, and in the sur- vey, 1 fi(Jted that I voted for 'None of the Above' for all of the elec- tions ex_{;ept for the trimester ques- tions. I feel that the election only included these two opinion ques- tions to draw people to the voting booth_ After doinga little research, I found that the trimester election was to be included on the machine, and then a student working on a reseanl1 project later added the other fhree names. I question whether or not the survey, and that seems to be all that the trimester question really was, was going to be posed to the students. I hav.e read the paper that went out the day boefore the election, and there was no mention ofany referendum con<;eming trimesters in that pulJ- IicatlotL I have since been told that the cost; which is a m:inor amount, but no small matter in principle to this wriiter, was being paid already because of the trinlester questi11m. I conte11d- that the entire question concer:nirtg trimesters was only included so that the student could have his questions posed to the cam!>US. To me this seems like the \gross ·tleglect of office\ that is mentio-n under impeachable of- fences in the Student Forum Con- stitutiol1. I believe that it is the place of the StudentForumto lookafterthe _ .~ct1·<?I1g~ te nghts of the Students.

It seems obvious, but I recall times where I judge a person based on the reflection of who they are. I know you people do this too. Of- ten we make opinions with respect to our judgmen~ or our belief sys- tems. Funny how the assumptions we make are usually offth.e mark. The best thing for us to do is shut our mouth, and let people do what they want to. Who understands their ac- tions better than the one doing the action? On that note, let us not judge. Each ofus has issues. Each of us has to learn to accept and to tol- erate eachother's faults or blem- ishes. After all, no one is perfect, maybe except for God. All of us realize that we have made mistakes at one time or another. We' have to learn to forgive. Most impor- tantly, we must also learn to for- give ·ol).rselves. Strife is avoidable tlrrough love ofthe person. We all want forgiveness when we make mistakes. Who has for- given us and learned to love un- conditionally better than our par- ents? When a time comes, thank your parents. Loving uncondi- tionally is thehardesttbing you can do. It's hard for me too. Even with Cornell girl. But you have to learn to accept those things in order to truly love an individual. Someone once said, .. Live, love and forgive. You will then be re- warded with the same.\ How true this is. Every single one of us wants acceptance, something built into our system most doubt. S9ci- ety has built us that way. We all crave love, don't we? I've found that maybe I've found it But who knows really when love appears? Fate decides. Our heart decides, and we really have no say about it. We all know that even when it doesn't make sense, we still continue to love a person, re- gardless of the transgressions they make, or how much they hurt us. We still come back for more, be it healthy or not. We do listen to what other people tell us to do, but ultimately, we make the decision. If you have to do something and someone who knows better tells you not to, you still do it. That is why we are individuals. We are what we are. So, if you have a real hunkering for something, just do it. No matter how much a pers.on tells you not to do it, you'll do it anyway. Just make sure thatit isn't detri- mental to your life or your health.. Reality is complicatmg isn't it? In the ·end, what people say doesn't matter. Ifs. your life, and so it should be your choice. People can only give you advice. That is what it is rea.lly 1 just ad- vice. People don~t decide the choice you make. You have that choice. So whateverit is, stick to your guns. It's your life, not any other's life Ol' mine: It will be you that lives with the decision. Not ~yone else. Just remember to take advice with your tongue in your cheek. Die advice you get may not.be for you. , · Do what you feel is right. Who cares what other people thillk? Jt's your life, not theirs. Speaking of tll.at, I still say that people don't know me. I'm not who I seem. None of us are. We are all deeper than w; portray owselves to be. We aU have des- tinies. We all have our own inner hopes. We all h.ave our dreams.

Someday, I hope that people can understand me. I figure people know ten percent of who I am. And that is the people whoreally know me. flinety percent is still an enigma.

Love does not like to be pushed. Love takes time. Your heart needs time to heal as well. Most of the time, time is the best solu- tion for most things. Things re- veal themselves with time.

Bet on the ttutle, because the hare is going to sink. Patience and perseverance get things done. Press on! ! Pre&s on!! You will achieve the greatest things with this in mind.

Maybe I'lll>e able to say this to her face. Time will tell. I don't know her en.ough, and she doesn't know me enough either. It will take time to see if we are meant to be. That is the truth. I just hope that someday I can proudly call her my wife. But who knows? Things change as we grow. That is inevi4!ble. Right now, I just feel that she is the one. It could be. Fate will give me a sign. But eithei way, I will learn about love, life, and reality. All we ask is companionship of a dif- ferent kirtd. We will find that someday. Be it now, or in the future.

Yulman Production of Antigone Not to Be Missed byL()ri Greene .A&E Editor Classic theater is back and mak- ing a smash hit throughout the- aters all across America. Our own Yulman Theater is no exception.! Antigo11e, the Greek tragedy hy Sophocles, is showing now through Sa11day in the Yulman Theate.r. First produced in 441 RC., Antigone is one of the first and most m<>ving tragedies ever written. It truly probes the nature of suffering. It is tne story ofthe struggle of Antigo11e. daughter of Oedipus, and her fee lillgs of morality against the tyranny and repres- sion of her Uncle Creon. When Oedipus, K.1ng -of Thebes, dies, there is a st1uggle for power be- tween his se>ns. Eventually the two brothers kill each othe:r and Oedipus' brother-in-law, Creon, becomes king. Creon decides that Eteocles will be given a noble burial and Polynices will be left to rot. lie also decrees that anyone trying to give Polynices a religious burial !rVill be sentenced to death. Ant:ig one's proud and willful choice to gi-ve her brother the proper burial sbe be- lieves he deserves lead to a series of inescapable disasters. What might these disasters be? For that, you will have to stop by the theater this weekend and fmd out for y()ur- self. Director William Finlay hills cho- sen a translation that is clear and simple to follow. The pm<lllction elements are top notch and tbe cast phenomenal. One of the m()s't in- teresting aspectsofthe play, which is unique to theGreek genrellfthe- ater, is the chorus. Fiillay has cast the chorus as fou:r women, led by the choral leader. These women serve as theliiik:between the audi- ence and the a.:tion. They echo the themes that arise throughout the play. They are more than just narrators as they interact fully within the world ()f the play. The choice t() cast woman as choral members is something that has made a difference in the shap- ing of the story an~ in the sensi- tivity tha the audience will pick up on. The cast, lead by Senior Fiore Leo in the roleo£ King Creon, does a brilliant job handling the elevated text. They are able to inhabit the worcls and the characters in a natu- ral and sophisticated way. This is a re~mlt of working with not <Only Finlay but also vocal coach Patsy Culbert and t:he great William Lacey. l:,a(;ey is a renowned ShakesiJettre and Greek Theater expert and tea;chei who was in ·resi- dence at 1f ruon im 1998, directing Two Ge11rlle~en ofVerona.

Rudy Wrong to Criticize Brooklyn Museum \s ''Sensation'' Exhibit byMicllaeiS. McGuire Copy Editor This past Saturday, October 30, while I was visiting my friend at Fordham University, I had the op- portunity to .go to the Brookly11 Museum of Art and view the \Sen- sation .. e:xhibit. This exhibit has drawn atte11 tion over the past month due to th:e attempts by New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani to cut funding based upon the dis- play of one of the pieces by Chris Olifi. Another source of contro- versy has been the questionable methods of private funding that the museum lias undertaken. The piece is a portrait of The Virgin Mary., entitled \The Holy Virgin Mary.\ The controversy is over the artisfs use of elephant dung in the portrait, which the mayor has £leclared is disrespe<;t· ful to Christians. I fail t() see h1lw this work is of- fensive. As the audio tour, read by David Ecwie, indicates, the breast of the virgin \is made of the manure thatnoudshes African soil.\ The rnanure is a symbol. lt is not inte11ded to tarnish the im- age or mock the religion. , Perhaps the greatest proble:m that lhavewith the mayor's ireo\\'erthis portrait is the fact that there were so many other more \offens.ive\ images portrayed in the exh.ibit. There are children whose faces are disfigured, having forms ofgenita- lia in place of there noses and other organs. Some are growing out of other • s torso's creating a question- able posture, taking into acc()unt that they are children that arre por- trayed. If there were to be anissue over the appropriateness o.ffilie ex- hibit, it would perhaP.S b~ who should be permitted to see: tll.ese works. All of the controversy, hoi'Wever, detracts from some of the more in- teresting pieces that are part of the exhibit. For example, there is th:e in- teresting cast of artist Marc Quinn's own face, called \Self.\ As the ac- companying placard d€ scribes, \Over a five-month periocd Quirin. had eight pints of blood e:xtracted from his body ( the average annount in the human body), whichbe then poured into a cast ofhis hea<l, froze and placed in a perspex cobe at- tached to a refrigeration unit. In- spired by a cast o'rWilliamBlake's face, \Self' is a meditation on mor- tality, tenuously held in frozen ani- mation.\ The pie.::e is disturbing to look at, however it makes an im- pact knowing that what you are observing is q11ite literally a sig- nificant piece of the artist. Another inte:testing piece is \Mask by Ron Mueck. The piece is a face approximately the h~ight of a tnan, with perfect detail. The eyes, facial han, wrinkles and lips all look extremely realistic~ There were several other works that ought not t() lJe overlooked: \Some Comf<>rt Gained from the Acceptance of the Inherent Lies in Everything,\ a11 entire cow, sliced into cross-secti4ms (Darnien Hirst); \Bullet Hole,\ the up-close view of the wound thai bears striking re- semblance to other anatomy (Mat Collishaw); \Deep Throat,\ which at first glance C~ppears to be a nor- mal table setting, but in the center of the plate is a the video o:f the artist's own thre>at, in the process of swallowing (Mona Hatollnt); and ''The Great Bear,\ which is a map of the Lonclon Undergrolllld, with the names ()f the stations re- placed with tht1 names of peQple, creating a Saints' Line, a phile»so- phers' lioe, a:nd many other lines, allowing f<lr interpretation as to where thte rrost bas decided to al- low the trains to ·~transfer.''

Don't forget about campus re- sources. Go to the gym and spot for each other: Shoot hoops or go to the pool. Have crazy dive com- petitions. Run a perimeter to- gether.

Y ~u will also get to see a more realistic siqe to your . date when you leave this world of Union College. The key to dating, and in par- ticular first dates, is that you do not have to spend a lot of money to impress someone! The purpose fJ'op tUn 91loVies ' . . of a frrst date is to get to know one another and to decide if you have things in common, not to try to im- press someone by breaking your ballk ..

De- spite most students' tendency to avoid downtown, it is rich in his- tory and looks quite lovely wrapped in a blanket of snow. It is also free! Just about every girl I know would much rather have a little bit of creativity than a lot of cash. First dates should also not be too long. Try to make progressive plans so you can easily quit the date at any time. Taking a first date on a day trip 1o Boston might be dreadful if halfway there you realize you can't . stand each other!

Page 14 ·November 4, 1999 · Analysis: New Hampshire Town Meetings by Michael:S. McGuire . Copy Editor Last Wednes_day and Thursday, Dem~crat and Republican· candi- dates held town-meeting style de- bates in the first primary state, New Harnpshire. On Wednesday, Vice President Al Gore and former New Jersey senator Bil'l Bradley faced- off. The followingnight the remain- ing R.epublican candidates met with a New Hampshire audience, m_inus Texas Governor George W. Bush, who had yet another excuse for ducking a debate that would possibly force him to declare a po- sition on an issue. The tormat ofthe town meetings, which was broad-cast on CNN, was the best to date. It allowed people in the audience to ask pre-screened questions of the candidates. The candidates had t0 answer in a fi- nite period of time, and the design was tQ force them to focus on the issues, rather than rhetoric and personal attacks on each other, which could develop in a traditional debate. The towri meetings allowed Americans to see some of the po- sitions of the candidates side by side, and make comparisons. We can now compare the candidates on a variety of issues. An important issue, perhaps the most important issue in the Ameri- can political system.today, is cam. paign finance reform. Most of the candidates had the opportunity to voice their opinions on campaign fmance reform. On Thl:lfsday night, responding to a question on how he would prevent future cam- paigns from being bought, Repub- lican candidate Steve Forbes pointed out George W. Bush's glar- ing absence. He said, ··r share the frustration that Governor Bush is not here tonight. He didn't come to a debate last week because he had a fundraiser. A couple of weeks ago, his plane got delayed, he had a choice between a fundraiser and going to a school in Rhode Island with und~tprivi~ leged kids. He chose the fundraiser. So, perhaps in the future at a fo- rum like this, if we call it a fundraiser, he might show up.\ Forbes went on to say, \unless you are blest like me with independent resources, they have ways of shutting you out.\ Mr .. Forbes failed to point out, of course, that the aspect of the system that allows the ex- tremely wealthy to bay their way into a presidential race is just as corrupt as that which allows spe- cial interest groups to have a larger impact than the averag,e American. He claims to be \independent\ and ' ••not beholden to special interests.\ This may be true, but a system that allows him to get his foot in the door due to his financial success, and prevents others who have not had such success, is not function- ing properly and rs nothing to boast about. . Arizona Senator John McCain, a long-time supporter of campaign fmance reform, hasmacle ii his per- sonal crusade and tied it to every other issue he stands. for. Repeat- edly throughout the evening, he pointed out that the issue being discussed could not be achieved without reforming campaign fi- nancmg. Former senator Bradley had a different approach. He said, \It re- ·quires a grassroots movement.\ He ·outlined three things that need to happen in order for reform to take place: first, there needs to be a grassroots movement among Americans, to show that this is an issue that is important to them; second, \people in finance, in busi- ness, in religion ancl in academic life have to step forward and say the current system is not work- ing ... \ and third, '\you need a presi- dent that is going to make cam- paign fmance reform oneofthe top three or four or five issues ... \ The problem 'Yith his pJ::oposal, how- ever, is that \people in fmance, in business\ and in religion stand to gain if the system stays as it is, beca11se they have a larger say than the average American. They will not step forward. A grassroots . ' movement IS not so easy to get started, and often the people's wants are overridden by the de- sires of the special interests in the end. Finally, a president cannot enact legislation without congres- sional help which does not seem likely at this time because of sena- tors such as those that AI Gore criticized Wednesday night in say- ing, HI thought the Republican senators attacking John McCain on the floor of the Senate ought to be ashamed of themselves.\ AI Gore had proposals of his own. He proclaimed, \I do not ac- cept any PAC contributions.\ He also pointed out that he \supported and proposed and co-sponsoTed in the Congress a bill to provide for public fmancing of elections. I support that today. Awful hard to get passed. It's hard enough to try to get McCain-Feingold passed.\ He declared his support for the ·McCain-Feingold bill, and sup- ported it \before it was watered down.\ Senator Hatch had a different take on the situation. He has de- cided to ~ to fund his campaign on thirty-six dollar donations. He said that if he got a minic:m thirty- six dollar domitions, he could have enough money to compete with George W. Bush <md win the nomi- nation. He criticized Senator McCain indirectly, implying that he preaches reform but still accepts donations. He failed to acknowl- edge, however, that in the current political climate a candidate must · accept donations, and McCain will stand a better chance of making an impact by winning the nomination or a,t least staying in the race until the end than Senator Hatch will by running out of money and drop- ping out early, as he most likely will do. The campaign fmance reform is- sue is likely to be a key issue in next year's election, possibly more so in the senatorial races where Republican senators will have to defend their anti-reform stands ·against Democratic challengers who will be pro-reform. It will be interesting to see, in the ftrst de- bate Governor Bush bothers to at- tend, in early December, where he stanas on this crucial issue for American democracy. It will take a lot of spinning for Bush to defend his ftmdraising prioritizing against two' reform-minded candidates like Hatch and McCain, and even more in a potential general election against Al Gore. · EgyptAir Flight 990 Crash Kills 217 by Steve Nemeth Stqf[Writer After 36 hours of searching for survivor's, the US Coast Guard an- nounced that it would be moving on to the next phase of the investi- gation - that of search and recov- ery for wreckage and bodies of EgyptAir Flight990. Coast Guard Rear Admiral Rich- ard Larrabee announced the state- mellt during a press conference early Monday morning. \We be- lieve-at this point it is in everyone's best interest tCl no longer expect we will find survivors. It is now a search and recovery operation.\ He a I so pointed out that the sear<:h effort far exceeded estimates for human survival. \The average life expectancy in water temperatures of 58 degrees is five to six hours,\ Larrabee em- phasized that during the search over six cutters and a number of aircraft were used to scour a 9,000- square-mile area. He pointed <>ut that significant pieces of wreckage were found along with a number ofbodies. One piece was so large that it had to be removed from the water by crane from the Navy recovery vessel Ju- niper. Only one body has been recov- ered but human remai:ns have beelll found along with seats, cushions. clothing and paperwork.Aside from the Coast Guard recovery ef- fort, the National Traffic Safety Board (NTSB) and the FBI began an investigation into the causes of the crash. Investigatms have no idea why the Boeing 767-300ER with 217 passengers plummeted over 33,()00 feet in less that two minutes less than an hour after taking offfrom JFK Airport in New York City. None ofthe wreckage so far re- covered has had any bum marks - a sign of a fire or explosion. 'The lack of a distressca11 is also a mys- tery. FBI and other investigators from intelligence agencies are in- vestigating the possibility of sabo- tage or terrorism. but a preliminary check of the passenger lists has yielded no one suspicious, accord- ing to a senior counterterroristof- ficial. The chance that a terrorist use-d an American alias is a possibil_ity being taken into account, but in- vestigators at this point have seen no evidence of terrOJiSt activity in connection with the crash. As a precaution, FBI officials have interviewed airpm1 workers and mechanics. This has been characterized by officials as \'stan- dard procedure\ and does not nec- essarily mean any wmkers- have been deemed suspects. The FBI is also q1aestioning pas- sengers on the flight that got on at Los Angeles and ~ot off at New York City. Officials at the Port Authority, which oversees allofNew York's · airports, confmn.ed2llluggage had been x-rayed but a<irnitted that they were not sure wllat security pre- cautions were takeii with non-pas- senger luggage. Edward McLaug:hlin, one of the passengers who got on at Los Angeles and got off at New York, is a consultant on h<uman resource issues for EgyptAir, including deal- ing with crashes. On Sunday, at a pre.ss conference,McLaughlm stated that he was working with families of the passengers on the flight on behalf of EgyptAir. He did n<?t reveal his connection to the flight. A signal which is believed to be from one of the plane cockpit voice recorders had been received late Sunday night. It may be recovered Tuesday when divers from the Navy ship Grapple arrive on sta- tion at the crash site which is cen- tered 60 miles south ofNantucket Island. Weather in that area is ex- pected to become more inclement throughout the week. From early evidence, investiga- tors have gained a preliminary pic- ture into the last moments of the doomed jet. The plane took off at 1:19AM Sunday :fromJFK Inter- national Airport and began to climb to cruismg altitude. At 1:50AM, the plane dropped 14,000feetin36 seconds to an alti- tude of 19,100 feet. From there the plane plummeted, the last radar sig- nal occurring at 1:52AM. With those statistics the plane dropped at a rate of over 300 feet a .second, an obvious sign of a catastrophic failure of some sort. Yet even during the plummet the plane still had enough power to have its transponder relay the plane's altitude during the plum~ met which has caused some avia- tion experts to speculate that the plane did not undergo an immedi- ate breakup. The fact that the plane still had power during the descent in- creases the likelihood that the voicQ.and data recorders, if found, may yield valuable clues. Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak ex- pressed his condolences for the families of all those aboard and ex- pressed his confidence in the NTSB. The Egyptian govermnent, de- spite conventions of international law, has allowed the NTSB to lead the investigation and has pledged its full support so a precise expla- nati~n can be drawn about what happened. President Clinton expressed his condolences for all those on board a:nd pjedged that the NTS~ will do a .th()rough and complete investi- gation on the event. New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani also ex- pressed his condolences and of- fered, ofi behalfofthe city, any as· sistance that may be needed.

World News Gr!T.tttnrbiettl'fili • November 4, 19?~ ·Page 15 F-ederal Surplus Larger than Projected byDavidGnmei' Stqf[Writer On Wednesday, October27, 1999 President Clinton announced that the federal governmenfran a larger surplus th.an the administration projected for the 1999 fisc;alyear. \This trl.Jlle digit surplus is larger than projected, larger than last year's and.,. in fact, larger than any .surplus in1he history of the United· States.\ Such overconficlent re.- marks are Cl reminder thatClinton.'s \economic strategy has paid off.\ · Speakiag from the White House, Clinton uav eiled that the 1999 fis- cal year, which ended September 30, shows a surplus of$123 billion. The administration had previ(lusly estimateda$115billionsUII>lus. By unleashing a larger-than-expected surplus Republican Cengressienal leaders ha-ve new reason to renew the large tax cut: a 10-years $792 billion. President Clinton vetoed the bill a month ago citing that passing the bill would :prove irresp<Jnsible and. defective: Yet, in the same sen- tence he also staied that ta:xes should by increasedby S82 billion. over .five years. It seems as tho~gll the latterpartofhis sentence seems more ''irresponSible and defective.'\ Republican leaders were quick t() defend Clinton's attad-.s, disre- garding afly declaratiOilSI involving: petty immaturity. Inst~ad of con- stant argument, Republican lead· ers would like to work with the - . . - . President to meet America's :tim- damental priorities. Theywantto give the American. people an honest, credible bud,get that extends the life ofSocial Se- curity and Medicare, meets the country'~ responsibility in educa- tion and other important areas while aHowing the country to pay dowtl that {national) debt ~nd be on tar- get to he debt-free within the next 15 years, and still have an. afford- able tax cut for all people and their subsequent classes. President Clinton, unable to re- spond effectively, referred to the fact that this year is the second straight yeat the government has generated a surplus, the flrst time that Ius occurred since tb.e Eisenhower Administration in 1956 and 1957~ Representative Bill Archer (R- Texas), chaii:man .of the House . Ways and Means Committee and co-author of the $792 billion, 10- year tax cut hill sent to President Clintop:, said that surplus is a vic- tory forGOP fiscal strategies. ''this is what happens when Re- publicans take care of the govern• ment checkbook and hold the line against tax hikes and more spending ... ;:. huge victory for American taxpayers and is the lat- est in a string of victories that Con- gress h.as won for our country and our economy,\ Archer said. Joe Lockhart, White House Press Secretary, denounced the' Reyublican' s. claim to fame, stating that it was the Democratic budget in 1993 that was not supported by any Republicans that paved the way fvr the surplus; .. It's an ex- traordinary use of se lee ted memozy, \he said of Archer'' s state- ment. The surplus is an interesting topic and has been ofrecent con- cern in Washington. Social Secu- . rity and Medicare have already been put aside, locked up for an indefinite amountoftime. What to do with the rest C>f the money is the bigger question: should the debt be paid off or should people receive tax cuts, money so crudely taken from them in large doses ever since Clinton was c:lected in 1993? Republicans and Democrats have battled for months making minimal decisions, and creating much distress in an already tense atmosphere. The future? As of now, there hasn't been anything or anyone that seems likely to passbefore the session is adjourned for the holi- days. And that prolongs debate even further, which will ultimately he a downfall as the next millen- nium unfolds. Whether a Republi- can or Democrat, C<>ngressional leaders must realize that such petty immaturity will not solve anything, only through compromise will \leadership\ truly- transpire such as the leadershjp witnessed in the 1980's, whilePresidentReagan was in office. The country has a llirge amount of money avaihtble for whatever the country's desires. Democrats have failed in their capability of maturely deciding how to allocate \the pot of gold\ and Republicans are not far behind. Hopefully, things will work-Re- publicans will come to their senses, spend the money wisely, andre- vert back to the positive agenda set a few years back while Speaker Gingrich was in charge. From there, the people will respond and vote for anew and different White House in 2000; and an effective leader. Commentary: What Makes Buchanan Try by Dan Kirsch StqffWriter Pat Buchanan is probably the most intelligent presidentialcandi- date currently in the race, or .even in any of the races he's been in- volved in. He began in 1992 as a protest candidate against elitism, and has sold himself as that same package ever since. His '\peasant army\ has been one that would follow hi:n:i any- where, butwould rather follow him to the White House. Bachanan probably has no chance in the fi- ery Catholic Hell he b~lieves he won't he .g.oing to, but that begs the question: What drives him? What makes Pat tick? Thi.s writer believes it could be his true altru- ism, beliefin God and Cowttry, love of fellow man, and his staunch be- lief that l:le can lead America t9 a better tomorrow. A w. Isn't that sweet. No, as much as Pat Buchanan is ·a grea.t orator, ·a persuasive author, a funny ~uy and a person of prin- ciple~ I must agree with his naysayers; Pat loves the spotlight. He plays politics \For the Love of the Game .. \ Let's back up a bit to the light JJ.is supporters have cast themselves in because of his rheto~ ric: They see him as patriotic, and who does one think .of when that sacred word ·~patriotism\ is ut- tered? George Washington and Thomas Jefferson, of <:ourse. When l3uchanan pretend:s to be- long to the same \economicnation- alist\ category as Alexander Hal.11ilton and General Washington and the Federalist, Whigs, and Republicans of old 1 what is he re- ally thinking? What is he thinking whenever he brin.gs up the tired example of Ronald Reagan protectin~ Harley- Davjdson motorcycles when try- ing to prove Reagan was also an ''economic natiorta:Hst\ .... (by the way, simply a euphemism for \pro- tectionist,\ one who favors high taxes on. imports to keep business in Americaanddiscourage foreiga goods from entering tlte U.S. mar- ket). Buchanan is cas~g bims~lf in the light of history. He believes that history runs in cycles, and he is the latest result ofthat cycle. He believes for one that politics runs in about 20 year cycles electorally and 100 or 200 years ]Jhilosophi- cally. Wben.he ran against Busll in 1992, he was playing Reagan t() Bush's Ford of '76, and trying to unseat a sitting moderate president who was only elected (or ap- pointed) because offue conserva- tive proceeding him. In Buchanan's workin.g-class social conservatives who are now the coveted vote for any presidential election. The problem was that in 1996 the pub- lic didn·'t think we had nearly as bad a president as we did in 1980 and times were ,fme. ~uchanan just seemed to be an iconoc'lastic Den- nis the Menace, stirring up trouble and annoying old Mr. Wils.on, knoWl~ to us as Bob Dole. Now Buchanan again is casting, himselfi!t the lightofhistory. He has three times run for the Repub- lican presidential nomination, and bas thrice failed, twice been a foil, and o11ce been merely a nuisance. It is now much worse than a Reagan complex, however, or even a Washington complex. He now ·. ~~iv~,~ J!uchtJ;~n tt;gtt~tt i~:.r;asti~g himsel '-.-~-''\:' ---~_-.·\ -_\···:~::-:_·:: __ ,_~> .':~>;:. .. :--.~~-:·-.:~ .. ~·:~':'_.-::-:··_·--·.·:·_=,,..:::-:,-'. _:/·>~-::.-_=,:.:_.- ->~ _· ' ... -4 in .. the Jfg}&(iJfltiJiiifY.~\'llle .ha~ three_ tzmes . rt:ttfft;Jr. t/i¢ l,lip(l~li~itii i!tes.idenJia[ nomi- nati~n,:· artd4tcis.~~tice:failea,.'iwice been a , .. ·, .. ·.' : : ·•; :. : :• :. . . • . : . : :c· .· ' > . < .. ,, ·:, ..

Four years later in 1980, Reagan won as a favorite of conservatives, and bad used as a springboard for his candidacy a wonderful off-the-cuff, prime time speechafterdefeatat tlle l976GOP Convention. Four years later in 199(), Buchanan tried to uni1e conserva.- . tives behind his ·candidacy be- cause he had meage1 Establisb:- ment opposition, as Reagan did in 1980. However, Buchanu prQved tc not be good enough of a candi- date to unite those .same conser- vatives Reagan did l>ecause he wasn't even wooing tllssame vot- ers. His appeal, it has been said, are the \Reagan Democrats,\ or casts b.imselfin so many different lights that he believes merely the tide of history will sweep him in, and his little triumphs of probably winning the Reform Party nomina- tion (the frrsttime he'll ever have won .any nomination or been able to call himself a \front~ runner\) and gairti~tg their $12 Million in cam- paign funds from the federal gov- ernment will be merely the begin- ning of a real underdog run for Pennsylvania A venue. He sees himself, in chronologi- cal order, ftrst as Ge.orge Waslling· ton or Alexander Hamilton, be- cause he will take us out of foreign entanglements. Second, Thomas Jefferson, because he will drasti- cally reduce the size of tlie State Department and the federal gov- ernment.- Third 1 as John Quincy Adams, because he will take us out of foreign entanglements and will be a foreign policy expert in the White House. Fourth, Andrew Jackson, because he wiU give power ba<:k to the states and be a true '\populist.\ Fi~, Abraham Lincoln, because he is the second nominee of a new major political party that is rival to the DemC>crats primarily and agrees with the .grass-roots of the major conserva- tive party of the day (their slavery is our abortion). Sixth, Theodore Roosevelt, because he's an '\eco- nomic nationalist\ and. corporate business hater who wants to see real\'reform\ or \progressivism\ in politics, and will run against the Republican Establishmentto do so. Seventh, he sees himself as a sort ofreverse FOR/Woodrow Wilson becau.se he's going to reverse the wrongs of interventionism. Eighth, he sees himself as a Herbert Ho01ver/Calvin Coolidge protec- tionist who will preside over a ma- jor prosperous period in the eco- nomic history of our country. Nineth, he sees himself as, of course, Reagan, who ran for the presidency three times before fi- nally winning at age 69. Buchanan is 60. Tenth, he sees himself as Goldwater, the unapologetic con- servative who realigned the Re- publican Party while simulataneously getting thrashed in the election of 1964. Ifthathap- pens, Buchanan thinks, so be it, but I'll be the Founder of a New Era. His greatest fear is to be{ elev- enth} George Wallace, the AJabama Governor who followed an inde- pendent line to the November polls, but still could not defeat Nixon, the social liberal whofought politics dirty and hard .. . Speaking of Nixon, Buchanan obviously likes to cast himself in the light of his old boss, wl10 saw himself as a crusader against elit- ist liberal establishment hacks who were all against him. \If you quit, they win,\ he said famously and ironically in his resignation speech. Nixon was a paranoid politician, one who no one should be proud to follow the ex:.arnple of, but Buchanan admired him for his guts and his triumph, his forty-nine state sweep of 1972 which, despite what the public th]nli:s, Buchanan thought was won fair in square: the Plumbers didn't make a damn bit of difference. Finally, he sees himself as Bill Clinton, the Comeback Kid himself. Why not? He lost two elections (Clinton, his congressional race and even his governorship at one point, Pat the last :two national presidential electi()lis). Buchanan has even let his study of politics go so far as England and Europe, where '\National Unity\ govern- ments occur all the time. He pledges to have \grassroots\ Re- publicans and Democrats, not just \elitists\ in his cabinet, where he will serve a four year term that saves Social Security and Medicare, radi- cally changes U.S. foreign policy for the flrst time since the end of World War II by ending our affilia- tion with the U.N. and NATO, and cuts government somewhere. Oh, and yes, he will \protect our bor- ders, clean the corruption out of government, save innocent lives, save American jobs. and keep our sons and daughters C>ut of war.\ Right. Buchanan is clearly a case study of someone who can c !early talk a good game and play hard, but not welL But, if you believe that a campaign is merely a work in progress and a piece of art at that, the Buchanan campaign is for you. If it's not whether you win or lose, Buchanan is :Your man. But if you care about the future of our country, you 'Udo as I do: read his book, remember his points, and study how they're either flawed or excellent, but remember one thing-he can't win, and he's a psychopath whocan•t be trusted. ........

' ' Page 16 •November 4, 1999 • Q!omnrmeusis S~ience· & Tec;hnology Science & ·.Technology ~hat is the Deal ~ith Y2K by Steve Ayers StaffWriter The novelty af the millennium bug or Y2K has worn off, too many people have used this possibly devastating computer virus in order to enhance their own economic situations. Computers have revelutio]lized Inany aspects of modern life, from our banking system to our nuclear defense system, however, our apparent inability to predict the arrival of the next millennium has opened the possibility that we will annihilate ourselves as a result of our ·own technology. Many of the most vital computer systems in America have been updated, alleviating some of our worst fears. Y2K poses some threat, but it seems to have been significantly reduced through intensive last minute preparations. The United States Social Security and FAA computer systems are supposedly up to date, and the director of the FAA has announced that he will be in the air on January first, ensuring the safety of air flight during this holiday session. On a local level, the Chief Informatio11 Officer of Ellis Hospital stated in an interview last spring that a student who shewed up in the Emergency room on January first would be treated as well as on any other day . .How- ever, the Red Cross does advise that people keep enough food and water on hand for a long storm. The United States seems to be leading other countries in Y2K readiness. At the most, students spending terms abroad could experience flight delays when trying to get back to school after the winter break Most citizens are unconcerned over this issue. In a recent meeting ofdtizens concerned over Y2K readiness in C,olorado, only a sm<dl fraction of the people pre- dicted actually showed up. De- signed to be a forum for.discuss- ing methods for informing people of Y2K readiness and methods of dealing with potential crises, it turned into a place for swapping war stories of public apathy and broken bank accounts·. Of coll!se, we will all' sorely re- gret it if Y2K does turn out to be everything that the doomsayers predicted itto be (if we are all still aroundto regret it). It: may even be a good idea to make friends with someone who is hoarding food and building a bom:b shelter ju.st in case, so that you can mooch eff them after the Y2K apocalypse. Nonetheless, the c1l!Tent attitude does seem s<Jmehow maYe appro- priate th.an paranoia over the Y2K crisis. Even if it is: just the digits changing, we ar~ reaching an _ event that Qnlyhappens every two\ thousand yeaq. 111 this situation, it seems that we should be proud, in- stead of up- set. We sheuld look · forward to what the next millennium w:m hotd for us. Ifwehave already :111ade it this far with- out allllihilat'- ing our- selves, then it seems pos- sible we w:ill ylk.conco.org survive the next one thou- sand years. True, there are signifi- cant problems witll the world to- day. We are turning our planet into a convection oven 1Jy polluting the atmosphere with our rapidly de- pleted fossil fuel SU]lply (of course, the problem ofpollution resulting from fossil fuels wiUcorrect itself when our supply runs out within the next fifty years). Then there .are aU of the social anclpolitical prob- lems, such as war, inequality and human rights abuses. However, even with this, my dumb human optimismtells1ne that somehow we will survive, and more amazing times lie alread for us. Human achievements willcontinue to sore in the next millenniUm..

The existence of the human race has been puzzling and by the Earth's standards, short. How long wili we be able to keep up this ludi- crous struggle against our own de- structive elements is uncertain.

Are You Getting Vaccinated Against Meningitis? by Sloan Miller Science and Technology Editor Today in Old Chapel, vaccina- tions for both influenza and bacterial meningitis are being given. Although meningitis is rather rare, it is a very debilitating and devastating infection. Meningitis is the swelling of the tissue around the spinal cord and the brain. The. tissue app.lies pressure onto your central nervous system. Pressure applied for an extended period of time can result in permanent damage to your body. The cause of bacterial meningitis is the bacteria meningococci. The particular vaccine offered today helps protect you from four of the five known strains of meningococci. This vaccination also protects against the contraction of the bacteria for up t<> three years, so there is no need to get another shot if you are an upperclassman who received one during spring term last year. The Federal health advisory panel has recommended that all college freshmen taking up residence wi.thin a dormitory should get the meningococcal vaccine. The vaccinations are being given this term because the peak season for the contraction of the bacteria is from November through January. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention {CDC) h~s anticipated an average of 85,000 d~aths resulting from influenza a year. In comparison to the influenza, meningitis seems relatively harmless. In the United States, it is predicted that there will be about three thousand meningococcal cases a year. Almost three hundred of these cases will result in thedeathofthe victim. On college campuses across this country, one hundred twenty-five to one hundred seven1y-five cases are predicted to- occur. A estimation of fifteen to twenty deaths, as a result of meningitis, has been made. College students are more susceptible to infection because they are at high risk and are in close contact with numerous amounts of other people who ate at high risk. Some fact<>rs which htcrease the risk of contracting the bacteria are a lowered immune sys- tem, poor nutrition, th.e use of drugs, sinus infections ()r bacte- rial skin infections around eyes or nose and: alcoholism. Pervious illnesses and sleep deprivation are predominate fact10.rs in the weakening of the b<ldy;s immune system. The b-acteria, menjngococci, is passed from victim to· victim through either direct or indirect contact In cases where there have been multiple victims folll1d with bacterial meningitis, the infected victims were members of the same household, boyfriend or girlfriend, or in dose personal con1act with the infected person for an ex- tended period of time. If you share a cigarette or a drink with an infected person yoa are also in danger because the bacteria inhabits your throat. The bacteria can also survive for a sh()]t time in the open air. So, if an infected person coughs, leaving diseased drcplets on the hat!dle of a door, when you come in contact with the door, you could have po-ssibly infected yourself. Most likely, at some point in your life you will come in contact with the bacteria. An average often per- cellt of the populati()n is presently carrying a strain of meningococci in their throats. However, not all . strains of the bacteria will result in the development of bacterial meningitis. Also, tlle bacteria can remain dominate in your body for a fi)w days or even a week. Early symptoms of meningitis are similar to mild flu-like symp- toms such as a feve1·, a sore throat, headache, a rash, nausea, vomit- ing, discomfort as a result of look- ing into bright lights, confusion -an<i a desire to sleep for extended pe1iods of time. If not properly treated, meningitis can result in pennanent brain da.:m.age, learning disabilities, deafness or even deatb. in a matter of a c<>u.ple of.hours. Proper treatrnent()fthe bacteria involves the use <lf antibiotics. However, they must be introduced into the body early in order to reduce the risk of permanent damage. Less than fifteen percent of the cases will result in perma- nent damage iftreated accordingly. The statistics are a little higher in cases concerning the elderly and the young, because they are more susceptible to infection because of a weakened immune system. If you feel that there is no pos- sible way foryou or other students to come in contact with bacterial meningitis, consider the recent events at the University of Mas1;achusetts at Amherst. In September, one freshman student was hospitalized. An additional student at the same Wliversity was hospitalized just last week with a case ofbacterial meningitis. For just seventy dollars you can protect yourself from this danger- ous illness. Is it worth the cost? Even though we are not going to be in school for the majority of the peak season in which contraction <lf the bl:lcteria occurs, I person- ally recommend you get the vaccination just to be safe.

The pro- gt~m that ac,;hieved this feat was aone other than ihe Varsity Soccer I' earn. In addition to this, the t~am. earned the first bid for the NCAA tournament in tlle program's his- tory after being deni~d ·this oppor- tunity last year. Union competed in the preli:mi-' nary round oftheNYS Tournament against Keuka College earJier in the week. This past weekend they de- feated SUNY Brockport and then went on to the fmals where they se.ized the championship in an overtime bout against StLawrence University. the week, while Shannon Powers, who is accredited with the shQ.tout against Keuka, received the Con- ference Goalie of the Week hon- ors. When asked for his thoughts on the Keuka game, Coach Brian Spt?ck said, \We came out a little flat, but we played as well as we needed to win. I think we did a good job possessing the ball,. but once we got into the fmal third of the game things started to break down.\ This weekend at .states the Dutchwomen struggled a bit, but managed to pull it together and claim two victories along with the New York State Tournament Cham- pionship.. On Saturday, Union faced Brockport in the semi-finals and won 4-1. George Cuttita/SiiD On Wednesday against Keuka, Union 'started off slow, ending the fust half in a scoreless deadlock. In the second half; Lauren Byrne didn't waist any time putting_ Union ahead as she scored off of a Carrie Price comer kick just three minutesin. · Brockport came out hard early and scored a quick goal. Stephanie Maycheck responded to the Brockport attack with ten minutes left in the first half to tie the game up 1-1. The team poses by the net after securing t\eir NYS Title. Later in tll.e half, Missy Matusewicz scored her 20th goal of the season with 15 minutes re- maining in the game. Her goal was assisted by Jaymee Wilson. Union significantly outshot Keuka 19-1. The final score was 2- In the second half, the game re- mained tied until there we~e just 13 minutes left in the game when Abby West broke the tie with an unassisted goal. Union never had to look back. The Brockport de- fense fell apart when Julie Cardettino clinched the victory just 33 s.econds later with a penalty kick. Katie Smith also scored with 0 in favor of Union. Matusewicz 21 seconds left in the game to make earned the title (}fUCAA player of the fmal score 4-1. Union then advanced to the fi- nals where they matched up against St. Lawrence, who had shut out Geneseo and Vassar in previous rounds. Union knew that this would be a tough match, and they went into the game prepared to accept the challenge presented bySLU. Maycheck got the DutGhwomen started right away with a penalty George Cuttita/SIIl Senior Abby Harris keeps the ball away from SLU during their overtime victory. .... kick to give·thema 1-0ad'Vantage. St. Lawience immediately re- sponded to the Union goal with 2 goals oftheir own in the remainder of the frrst half. Going into the second halfUnion was down 2-0, a position f.n which they rarely found themselves dm- ing the regular season. Samantha Ryall tied the score at 2-2 when her shot on goal bounced off a SL U defender. Matusewicz f(nmd the back of the net to take the lea.d at 62:49 with her record-setting 21st goal of the. season. The Union defense could~t't hold the lead and St. Lawrence scored with only 12 minutes left in the game. The score remained tied at the end of regulation and the Dutchwomen were propelled into a sudden death overtime. Lauren Byrne scored the winning, goal for Union with a hard drive past the SLUgoalie. Speck was pleased that his team was able to win, but felt they defi- nitely could have played better. Considering Union domin.ated of- fensively with a 20-4 sho1 ratio, and the fact that St. Lawrence mapaged to score 3 goals with only 4 shots, there were definitely some de fen- sive lapses. Captain Wilson .said, ' 5 We weren't communicating as well as we should have been. We did not expect to lose, even whe11 we were down, we knew that we were go- ing to come back and win.'' Captain Harris said, '\Neither games were clean, we just managed topullitoff. Weknewwewouldn't get the (NCAA) bid if we didn'lt. We thought\1/edeserved that bid.\ The Dut~h women should b~ given a lot of tCredit for what 1hey have accornpliis:h.ed. They played through the \1/eekend with several players injurt::a, and came out with a New York State Championship and a bid for the NCAA tourna- ment. 5 Byrne was !Lamed most valuable player of the New York State tour- nament. West, Harris and Matusewicz \lolere all named tour- nament team !tlf stars. Wilson '.'(a'S ecstatic about the outcome of the weekend: Sll.e said, \[t felt so good to teach our ~(}als. It was some- thing we hav-e :been working on fo;r four years.\ After be~gdenied a bid last year with a 13- 1-l record, Union wa:s hesitant to b-e optimistic with thi:s year's 15-2· 1 r.ecord this season. They had los:tto William-Smith by a score of 3-0~ and were defeated in an overtime Jteartbreaker by Wil- liams in the fiollowing game. However, tlney were completely determined tra:nnake an appearance at NCAA's, 11rrd they fmally g()t what they ha vee deserved since last year. At around 11 :00 PM on Sun- day night, Co.ach Speck began t() call his playeers and give them th~ incredible ne~Ws: .. Union will' tra'Vel to Ithaca this Wednesday for the first round of NCAA pla:y()ffs. Wish these· women luck a:s they begin to com- pete at amtlcmbigller level.

Tile Hawks went three and out on their first second half possession and managed only a 22-yard pU!lt. The Dutchmen then block fo:r junior Dan Hamister. Af- ter the ball hit WoO.<l, the Hawks recovered it. They could manage nothing, however, and turned the ball over to Union on downs. Union then drove 78 yards down field and scored on a 25 yard pass fromGi:lbert to Hamister with 3:08 left in the third quarter. The extra point kick by sophomore Steve· Morat sailed wide right giving Union a 34-7 le::td. Audino said about the reemergence of the of- fense, \I think we are making more of a cotmnitment to the run. We were more of a west coast offense,. but that didn't workout real well. Ben was off in the b-eginning and he didn't get :much protection.

Audino said at halftime. that Union would come out pressuring more. Union ended the day with two sacks, but put a hit on Pincelli nearly every other play.

Union's safeties were playing close to the line of scrimmage, pressuring Pincelli and stopping the tun. The defensive scheme worked beautifully for the whole game, with the exception of the two touclldown plays by the Hawks. Th~ defense held the hawks to 0 for 12 on thiid down conversion, and 0 for 1 on fourth dqwn conversions. The Dutch- men, conversely, converted 11 of 19 third downs, and one of four fourth downs.

Cancer Catches Up with Competition by Stephen Eichfeld Contributing Writer The Men's Varsity Crew Team traveled to Saratoga Lake this past Saturday to race in the Head of the Fish Regatta. They raced three eight man crews; one novice crew and two varsity crews. The condi- tions atthe two and half mile course were ideal with flat water, little cur- rent and perfect w~ather. The men's novice race began just before midday and consisted of 14 boats. All ofUnion'sdvals were present at the race. The men looked to send a message to schools such as Skidmore, Hobart, Army, and SUNY Albany. The novice men showed a great deal of poise for only having two months of rowing exp~?rience. They covered the course ina quick 13 minutes and 49 seconds at con- trolled 28 strokes per minute. Dur- ing the race they managed to pass .the University of Vermont and Middlebury College. John Mackey of the novice boat said, \The team 'srowing had come a long way this term\ and that the boat \was controlled and seemed to glide down the course.\ The men were extremely pleased when the res\llts were posted as they had finished fourth place behind two Cornell boats -~nd the Army crew. The result was evenrnore re- spectable considering the fltst and second place boats belonged to Cornell University; a Division I team. There were 28 crews in th.e men's varsity race that began at 3:45 PM. Once again, Union was racing against many of its sp:ringtirne ri- vals. The Union \A\ crew had been seeded in eighth place while \B\ crew w~s seeded in 20th place. The \A\ crew began the race be- hind Hobart and in front of SUNY Albany. They raced with the in- tention of passing as many boats as possible, but the crews were too far spread out for it to be possible. Instead, coxswain Will Genrich forced the crew forward with ag- gressive tactics. At the end of the race Genrich and stroke Robert Hoppenfeld btoilght the crews stroke rating up from30 strokes per minute to 34 in order to insure a solid finish that left nothing to chance. · The Union \B\ crew had a simi- lar ra.ce in that the crews were well spread apart. The crew,which was made up of some of the novice row- ers and some experie11ced rowers raced aggressively. They proved that their boat has c<;~re group of workers that will develop into fm rowers. The Union \A\ boat fm- ished tied for seventh wlrile the \B\ . boat fmished in 21st place. Coach Tom White was pleased with the results an4 the fact that whole team had made a lotprogress this fall. He claimed that this sea- son has been one of the better fall seasons in recent times. The re- sults of this weekend's races send a message to Union's rivals in New York State. Union will be training all through the winter in order to he prepared to take these rivals on again in the spring. ' Former Running Back Star by Vinod Voleti Staff Writer If you were to ask some of today's leading NFL rushers such as Marshall Faulk, Emmitt Smith or Curtis Martin which past NFL rusher influenced tbem the most, you'd probably get the same an- swer from all of them: Walter Payton. Payton is known as per- haps one of the finest athletes in America, as he rushed for 16,726 yards and 100 touchdowns in his career with the Chicago Bears. In addition to his ball-carrying abili- ties~ he also managed to catch 495 passes for 15 touchdowns and pass 34 times for 331 yards and eight touchdowns. There was no doubt that this guy meant business ev- ery time he set foot on the field. The past couple of weeks, how- ever, have been serious for the former footba(l superstar. Payton was diagnosed with primary scle- rosing cholangitis, which statisti- cally afflicts just 3 in 100,000 people. The cause of the disease, . which blocks the bile ducts and will ult:i.rnately .requite a liver transplant, · is unknown, but isn't related to al- cohol, steroids, hepatitis or im- mune deficiency. When asked if he was scared, the Hall of Fainer replied, \Hell yeah, I'm scared. Wouldn't you be scared? But it's not in my hands anymore. It's in God's hands ... .I can't lay around and mope around and hope everything is going to be OK. I'm still moving and groov- ing.\ Due to unfortunate circum- stances, however, the all-time lead- ing NFL rusher died on Monday in his suburban home at age 45. Since retiring from the NFL in 1987, Payton has stayed involved with football by serving on the Bears' Board of Directors and has also managed to host a weekly ra_- dio show and write for a football column weekly as well. Although Payton has managed to continu- ally contribute to the NFL, he has also embarked on a number ofbusi- ness v~ntures, such as own~g an Indy-CART auto-racing team, sev- eral restaurants and night clubs, founding and directing a bank, owning part of a power equipment company, and also attempting to start a St. Louis expansion team. Shortly after retiring, Payton also established the Halas/Payton Foundation to help Chicago's in- ner-city youth get a proper educa- tion. Having a degree in special education, the former NFL leading rusher had grave sympathy for those children who are deprived of a good education and ideal role models. Among his numerous records held during his NFL reign, Payton is famous for breaking 100 yards in a game over 70 times, playing in 186 consecutive games, and rush- ing for 275 yards in a single gatne against the Minnesota Vikings. · Payton was known not only for his spectactdar ball-carrying skills, but also for being a team P'layer and an overall nice guy. When asked how he felt after breaking the record for most rushing yards in a single game, Payton took the time to rec- ognize all his fellow football play- ers who never got tlle opportunity to break records due to injury, ill- ness, or death. After being diagnosed with the disease, Payton's physician immediately put Payton on a waiting list for available liver~. Though Payton is a well-known celebrity, he did not get preference over anyone else on the waiting list, and had to wait his turn. Unfortunately, however, cancer overtook his liver before his turn came up, which annulled his eligibility O·f getting a transplant. He was being treated at Mayo Clinic in Minnesota, which is a very prestigious establishment and known for its research and treatment of diseases. With a transplant, Payton's physician foresaw a healthy recovery. Because the disease was identified so late and because the disease is so rare, doctors at the Mayo Clinic were unable to slow down the disease in time for an effective tralisp lailt. Payton's past coaches, teammates. rivals, fans, and -most importantly his fa:qJ.ily mourn the l<lss of a fine athlete and role model at such a young age. . . • • • • • • • • • • . . • • I • ~ ~ .. ~ • ~ • ·II

Having placed fifth out of 43 boats in their last race in Connecticut,. the women had high expectations for the weekend on the Charles River. Although the men's team unfor- tuaately did not receive a bid to participate in the regatta, some were able to attend, while the rest were there in spirit. The women were driven to focus and make a strong showing for the integrity of the Union Crew. The women qrrived in Boston on Friday night and were able to row the course prior to race day. Expe- rienced coxswain Sharon Pozner, '02 was familiar with the bridges and turns of the 2.8 mile stretch. The crew was comprised ofMel- issa Sullivan '00, Naemmah Tan '00, Brae lin Pantel '01, Arnie Csiszer '02, Chris Vines '01, Tara Noyes '00, Susan Zelnick '00~ and Kat Fenis '02. .Saturday morning, the nine women were excited to race despite the less than ideal weather condi- tions. A strong head wind and cur- rent t1 ansformed the otherwise placid water to ocean like condi- tions. The 75 women's varsity eights warmed up·and prepared for the start under the Boston Univer- sity bridge. Union was <fSStgned bow number 34, which corre- sponded to their predicted finish in the race. The women were poised and contmlled in their rowing into the start of the race wurse. Clar:k Uni- versity started 15 seconds al!ead of the Union boat. Union,s first goal of the race was to catcll up and \walk through\ Clark. This was accomplished with detennina- tion within thefrrst half mile. A:s Union approached one ofthe major turns on the course, anofuer boat was in sight. An inside lane on the approaching curve w<>uld be advantageous; however, dtJe to the other boat's tremely admirable finish. The Union women appreciated all the support from fellow Union students, alumni and parents. The team then t()ok to the water for the last time this fall on 'Satur- day, October 31. The Head of the Fish Regatta is held annually on Halloween weekend in Saratoga Springs. Whathasin the past been a rather smallFegatta is quickly gaining in number and prestige as earlier that he was, \Very excited to see the novice boat ;race,\ and he was not let down!

CG)asidering the· cali- ber and presti,ge of many of the other crews~ (many Division I schools, and international crews were in their event) this was an ex- one o(the most competitive races at the collegiate level. This year, over 40 colleges and universities came out to the Fiiih Lake for the gorgeous fall day of racing. . The novice women were com- peting in one of th~:tust events of the morning. It w~ the l\ttst race ever for many of th@ eight fresh- man rowers. With two months of practice time together, they were more than ready to race in the Fish. Head Coach T ()m White had stated Division I crews surrounding them. The Varsity boat was ranked sev~ enth of the 35 boats in the ·event. Rowing right behind archrivals Skidmore and William Smith, the women were e~tremelyfocused qn a coiDpetitive and solid row. His- torica11y, the Skidmore'and William Smith'5 women eights have pre~ sented Union women with tough competition. Having a successful fall season thus far, the women were eager to pull hard, c~mpete and hopefutly come 11l()ugb with a win ovf;rSkidmore. . The start of the raee was-slightly ambigaou!>, but Pozner motivated her c:.;ew to bring th~r;~ting up to a speedy 31 strokes per minute.

The JV women work.ed:diligently all week preparing for the last race of the season and we:~;e-; detenni:ned to perform well on Sattu.:day.

Last time the two teams met, the Elec- tric City Smurfs out-maneuvered and out-performed the Albany Scams, who happened to be wear- ing dresses that were a shade on the long side for them to handle Union· s game. But when the University of Al- bany arrived at Union on Satur- day, ECP made sure that the Scams left the field in defeat with a final score of 15-7. From the start, ECP was able to put together an impenetrable zone defense that the inexperienced Scams were unable to break. With big defensive plays made by \Pretty-boy\ Josh and \The Wind,\ Al\any was rarely able to see the end zone. Offensively, ECP was versatile enough to score at will under any, and sometimes extreme, circumstances. \After a few of our players were added to the injured list due to their intense style of pla.y, we were not sure if the conditions were ripe for tournament ·play,\ said one player who re?tlarked on the game at the postgame luncheon at West. \Bllt then,\ he continued, \Isn't everyday a goDd day for Ultimate Frisbee?\ ECP has two more tournaments for the fall season.

Brooks Editor-in-Chief The playoff picture is far from dear for the Fighting Dutchmen. What is known is that if they want any hope of earning a NCAA biq, they must wintheir two remaining games against Rochester a:nd Springfield.

The conferences that are eligible for an automatic bid must have, among other things, at least seven teams in the conferences. Unfortunately for Union, the UCAA only has five. Even if the UCAA was eligible, it· would be tough for Un:iort to win the UCAA outright because· Rensselaer cur- rently stands alone at the top of theUCAA. Rensselaer wili most likely defeat Q-8 St. Lawrence this weekend, but ~could have a battle against Hobart . ' the following week. IfHobartup- sets Rensselaer and Union knocks off Rochester, then Union would share the UCAA title with Rensselaer and Hobart, since there are no tiebreakers. Fer an NCAA bid, Union is vy- ing for one of the nine bids given to nonMqualifying conference and independent teams. There are t~ee teams that are undefeated: Hardin-Simmons, Rensselaer, and Rowan. Rowan is nearly guaran,. ·teed a bid, while Hardin-Simmons still has to play a tough McMurry. If Rensselaer beats St. Lawrence and loses to Hobart they will most 'likely get in. Thus, there are six remaining spots if those three teams get in. There are nine teams with one loss, and eight teams with two losses, including Union. Although it is hard to know what the pollsters will vote, Union has an edge over some. of the one-loss teams and many of the two loss teams. Some. teams have a very weak schedule and Union not only has a tough schedule, but a 10 game campaign, somt::thing many other teams don't have.
