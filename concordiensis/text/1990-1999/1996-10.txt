There ate currently six houses on campus: Bronner (Cultural Awareness), Ludlow (Professor- INSIDE: I Student), Smith(Social Alterna- tives), The Society (Coffee House}, Thurston (Asian Aware- ness}, and Wells(Community In- volvement). The issue C>frepre- sentation fC>r theme housing sur- faced when the six houses formed the Theme House Consortium last tenn in order to present their in- terests. Several issues were raised dur- ing the debate, both by panelists and the floor. With regard to fea- sibility, Proctor and Feeley brought up the point that the fo- rum already has nineteen mem- bers. More members, they be- lieved, would only succeed in adding to the system's existing bureaucracy. ''If all the interest groups on campus were repre- sented, there would be forty or fifty people (in the Forum],\ said Proctor. \Nothing would get done.\ However, a popular audi- ence sentiment was that this was an \all or nothing\ issue. That is, either all groups should have the chance to be represented, or none should have the chance. The question of whether or not theme housing is a significant enough presence on campus sur- faced as well. Fox cited houses with l06members, compriseless than 5 percent of the student body; whereas the Greek system represents 40 percent of Union women and about 70 percent of Union men. Both .ofthese statis- tics were discussed later in the debate, but Fox also noted that the maturity of the Greek system was \' much greater than that of theme housing. \Some ofthe.Greekor- ganizations have been around here for 150 years ... We've proved our use.\ Ferguson, how- ever, countered this argum~nt with the point that, regardless of how old it is, theme housing has already established 21 programs without much financial support, proving that it has achieved «al- most unheard of success.\ Another item or' controversy was the demographics of the Stu- dent Forum. Decletcited thatonly four of the current nineteen F o- rum members are independent. Fox protested the significance of this statistic in pointing out that there are currently many ethnicities and religions that aren't represented on the Forum either. \This shouldn't be a Greek/non~Greek issue,\ he con- tinued. \There's no need to have separate group representation for each interest group.'; The financial issues behind rep- resentation provoked some de- bate as well.

Westinghouse grew up in Schenectady, studied at Union College, and was responsible for such revolutionary illventions as the fail-proof air brake system that is standard on rail£oads today. Westinghouse, a friend of presidentsand kings, was re- garded as the world' sgreatest liv- ing engineer in 1910, when he was elected to serve as ASME president. \Westinghouse himself saw two trains colliding because the brakemen could not respond to the engineer's whistle signal fast enough with separate hand-oper- ated brakes on each car. So he decided to make things better. That is the whole goal of the en- gineering field. It's true that by standing on the shoulders of a gi- · ant person like Westinghouse we can see further into the future\ said Frank Wicks, professor of mechanical engineering at Union College. Professor Wicks has published a detailed article on the wide- spread contributions of Westinghouse in the fields of electricity, communication, and energy in the journal entitled Mechanical Engineering. Among other achievements, Westinghouse was responsible for successfully harnessing 15,000 horsepower from Niagara Falls. The exhibit will include a bust ofWestinghouse, pictures ofhim and his family, the patents to his many inventions, atlases, maps, and a dog-powered butter chum The exhibit is featured in cel- ebration of the anniversary of Westinghouse 's~Oth birthday and will remain in the Nott Me- morial until December 1st.

Secondly, Union wants to up its rankings among small liberal-arts colleges in an attempt to com- pete with schoo]s J.ike Williams and Swarthmore. The advantages of the program include the opportunity forsel ected students' to work closely with individual .faculty during the first two years of college in the Union Scholars Preceptorial and thmugh an independent study on a topic of their choice, to explore a wider vari- ety of courses throughout the curriculum, to more easily have a. double major or a minor, and if they choose, to graduate one term ei.Ul ier or to applyto the Accelerated Scholars Program, which enables them to complete their undergraduate program in three yeats. Eligibility to this program is strictly controlled by the admissi<lns officers and faculty. Students who apply to Union and are in the top 5% of their secondary school classes, have combined SAT scores of above 1250 or have demonstrated extraordinary talent in an academic or creative area are eligible to be considered for the program. ;If stu- dents choose to become part of the program, freshmen will partici- pate in a yearlo11g Preceptorial that carries two course credits. Along with the Precepto-rial, Union Scholars will have to take GenED His- tory I and II as weH as seven other courses. This addition means that by the. end of the freshman year, Union scholars will have completed eleven com:se credits compared with the normal nine. The sophomore scholars will be required to begin an independent study in :m area other than their major which will culminate in a ma- jor paper and a required presentation at the Steinmetz Symposium. This independent study will be in addition to the normal course load of 9 courses for the year. In order to continue in this program and advance to their jtmior year students must keep a 3.2 GPA. The jun- ior in the scholar program will be able to go on a term abroad or off- campus internship t>f their choosing along with 6 other selected courses. In the senior year scholars will be required to do a senior project for honors in their respective majors. They will also be re- quired to take 7 additional courses and an optional extra course at no additional cost to the student. Since only 36 credits are required to graduate from Union, a Union scholar may choose to graduate after two terms during the senior year. Students who are in the Union Scholar Program and have achieved all the requirements after their freshman year can move to the Ramee Scholar program, an accelerated version of the scholarprogratn which essentially alloV!s students to graduate in three years. Students who want to enter this program must fulfill the requirements fortheUnion Scholar program., and in addition they must have 2 Advanced Place- ment credits befDre entering Union. The program allows the student to take 11 course credits a year and at no extra cost to enmll in an independent study program over the sophomore smhmer. Essentially, these students will have 36 course credits after junior year which will allow them to graduate a whole year early. ;fur K:na Chris*ian Staff Writer Last:fa]J:tenn, the meal plan be- came a rm:mdatory requirement for allsttide11ts1iving on cam- pus. ltlp•I'i()ryears, fraternity and son rity members living, in Greelc housing with open kitcll:ens were not required to partici!'!t.t~ in the meal plan. In fact, the majority ofdreek hous(lS: llad their own cooks, and riJeJnbers ate all meals in their hot1ses. AdiDinistration 's proposal to m~~e the plan mandatOJY beca1n;e ;a yery controversial issue dt1ring Spring Term, 1995. Greek members say that the P'T<lp()sal sparked tension be- tweell .adtninistration and Greek organi:zru.tions, and resulted in a numfler l()fprotests. Despite the complaimts, the plan was imple- mented, a.ond since IEJ.st· fall all Greel< 1n embers were required to partlciJJ~te in1he meal plan. Ad1T1i1:1istration implemented the req ui red meal pi an in order to ach-levre more interaction and senseof community among stu- dents. S1tu<ients argued t~at add- ing a.n, additional350 students to the rneal .plan would only result in overuowded dining halls. In add,iti<ln, it would increase costs for fraternity and sorority mem- bers. T().compromise, Dining Ser- vices .acitn.inistered an eq.uiva- lencysystem through which stu- dentscan use their meal punches towa.nl fiood a.tthe Rathskellar or towa:.n! .in Greek· kitchens. Stu- denison the 15 meal plan are en- titled to 12 equivalencies worth $5 eacih; students on the 1 0 meal plan re:ceive 1 equivalencies at $4 ·each; la.stly, students on the 7 meal.~ lam.receive 4 equivalencies worth o11ly $3. 12: The equiva- lencys:ystem provides both Greek and intdepe11dent students with a dining a.ltemative, while requir- ing tl\at at least three meal.s be used i11 tile dining halls, either Upper Class or West Fraterni- ties a11:d sor<Jrities who take ad- vant:a~e ofthe equivalency sys- tem tJSe tile reimbursed funds to pay for 1neals served in their houses.

The influx was noticeable, but was handled rela- tively well. Steve Pearse, direc- tor of Dining Services explains that the dining hall is most densely crowded on Monday, Wednesday and Friday at 12:27 PM and atll: 30 AM on Tuesday and Thursday. Seating aecom- modatioAs were a problem dur.., ing these hours last year. To avoid this problem, more seating and more tables have been pro- vided this fall In addition., more renovations were made in an ef- fort to create a less crowded at- mosphere. Generally, studen~s view the required pl_an as unnecessary, in- convenient and _expensive. Se- nior, Shari Berger comments, ••rt doesn't really affect me. It just creates more Jines and crowds in the dining halls.\ ·Despite the expense, most Greek organizations have struggled to continue serving meals in their houses . .Ten Gerard, President ofSigtna Delta Tau so- rority explains that her house still manages to have 7 meals together per week. \Before the meal plan was required, we were able to have 10 meals at the house and it was a lot I ess expensive. We used to pay $500 for l 0 meals, now we're paying over $700.\ Sisters of Sigma Delta Tau give up 12 out of 15 meal punches for equiv~lencies. With this money, they oan only afford 7 meals in the house. Other than the added expense, Gerard says that not much else has changed. She state~, ''I think the initial reaction was very negative, but for the most part the und-erd assman are fine with it. It'sa.ll they know.\ FIJI's in-house m.eals have qropped signi flca.ntly. Presi- dent Kevin Makarowski says that although the house pro- vides only 5 meal~ for it's members, theyare all relieved fraternity kitchens have not been closed. \1'he policy is ·' definitely a negative, but we're just h9p.py we were able to keep tbe kitchen open and provide some meals at the house. If the kitchens are taken away, that will defi- nitely detract from fratemi- ties.\ Steve Potenza, president of Psi Upsilon fraternity agrees that costs for his fratemity have \gone thr:oughthe roof\' Hecomments, \We've challenge<lthepremiseof the plan all along. Its goals are dubious. Throwing an additional 350 students into a dining hall isn't going to change tile sense of community ·here at Union.\ Potenza says that Fsi U psi! on has managed to keep eight meals in the house and reports. \Generally; brothers are satisfied. It's a change we have to work with. We're all glad weare still able to operate.\ Myles Kellam ofthe Sigma Phi Society relates, 'The equivalency system is a way f<>t the school to make money ... We don't get back even close to wlut we pay ... We're being overcharged!\ Sigma Phi eats eight scheduled meals in the house. Kellam says that the change was ·detrimental to the fratemity'srneals, as well as costs. He says that members are paying a greatdeal more than before, but wouldn't give up the rightto have mea.1s at Sigma Phi. \Meals are an opportunity for the Sigma Phi Society to take a break from the hum-drum ofUnion life. In the house or in th.e dining halls wesittogetheras agroup ... Ifthe school is so interested in the com- munity\ there are more effective ways to encourage interactioJ1 ... In my opinion, the schools actions .are .iust a microc()Sm of the real world. What ever happened to the laissez-faire mentality?\ The program itselfraises the caliber ofthe student hody and allows certain students to take extra courses at no extra cost to them. Unfor- tunately, the average Union College student will not be allowed to take advantage of any ofthese options and the program's implemen- tation is only in its infancy. This though, may be the first signal that Union College is. coming to the realization that despite ou.r impres- sive rankings this school is not challenging its students eno11gh. It also puts Union in direct competition will other higher ranking schools for those high caliber students that are competing for positions at many Ivy League schools. But the program. a combination ofGenEd and international study is a good start for Union and perhaps it may lead to opportunities for students in the fl!ture who are interested in further challenging themselves.

Like the United States population, the students ofUnion College are represented, whether they be Greek or independent, by their elected representatives on the Student Forum, just as national con-. stituents are represented by their congressmen in Congress. To expand this congressional analogy, allowing seat-s for special inter- est groups such as the IFC and thePanhellenic council is equivalent to allowing the tobacco lobby voting power in Congress. Special interest.groups have long wielded undue power in our student government. The recent inquiry to the Student Forum by the THC has brought this issue to the surface. Now that this issue has our attention, let's do something about it.. I fthe Student Forum is doing an effective job, then til ere is no need for special interest groups to sit on the forum. Therefore, special interest groups must be removed from the Student Forum in order to allow the elected officials to do their job.

There were crosstalks, Concordiensis articles and dis- cussions on campus. For an en- tire year we complained. Any problem that was cited was blamed on student apathy: how- ever, in the end, most of us be- came apathetic about our apathy and stopped both our complain- ing and our caring. While we were quick to point out the apathy on cam-pus and those who were to blame, we never picked up where we-left off to cite who continued the fight against student apathy and actu- ally did something about it. I'm referring to a specific group of students on this campus and ac- knowledgment for their achieve- ments is long overdue. Last year a group of freshmen were discussing the greek system on the campus and decid.ed that it would be reaUy great to have some kindof a co-educational fra- ternity thatwas socialliketheoth- ers, but more intellectual in a cof- fee-house 1yJJe atmosphere; They continued to pursue this idea un- til speaking with some the admin- istrative members of the col1ege who steered them away fro-Jh the idea of a fraternity, and enc<Jur- aged them to pursue some type of society where they cottld ac- complish many of the same goals. They did notgive up in their quest and eventually ended up with thirty people who loved tlle idea. After meeting with Brian Goldberg, a sophomore wllo was a founder ofthe society, I really felt that there should be more ac- knowledgment of these students and what they have acc<Jm- plished. Brian is not the .typical college student. He is enthusias- tic, outgoing and congenial The <Jther members ofthe society are very similar to him. They are all extremely active on the Union campus whether it be with Dutch Pipers, orchestra,.sports, theater, the newspaper, or some other type <Jf extra-curricular activities. They are all well rounded and enthusiastic about meeting new people and doing new things. Despite the wet weather, their first open coffee-house was a sue- cess. Poetry was read and music was played. The relax:ed, social, yet intellectual atmosphere that these students longed for became a reality. This atmosphere gives the students at Union a chance to get together to get to know one another· in a comfortable atmo- sphere. Rather than a brisk con- versation in the college center, or a muffled conversation at a party, now you can really get to know the people that you so often pass on campus. In my opinion, Union desper- ately needed this new society. It is about time that such a comfort- able atmosphere was created. I commend the members of this society; however, I really must first just remind everyone that this all started with a bunch of fresh- then who decided to do more than just complain about what is not being done on campus and decide to actually take action. They have set an example for all 0f us people. So this Tuesday night when you have some free time, stop up campus to Raymond House and see it for yourself. It's more than just a house, it's what happens when an idea becomes a reality.

To the Editor, ' This past Wednesday, a Crosstalk . concerning the repre- sentationofTheme Houses on the Student Forum took place. First of all; the questioi1 itself should be easy·to a11swer. Of cour§e, theme ~Duses should receive rep- resentation. This is an issue about representation and equity, and theme houses comprise a legiti-- mate group on campus. Under- standably, the Student Forum should be representing all of us but unfortunately, the current situation oh the·Fonun is not rep- resentative and is not equal. Cur- rently, the lFC and the Panhellenic Councils have repre- sentation <m the Student Forum, even if they only have 1/2 of a vote each_ THIS IS A SPECIAL INTEREST! No other group has this I uxury and the argument that the majority ofstudents at school are Greek is disputable. Right now, Greeks on this campus do not have a majority and for some to say that this campus is a ma- jority Greek is to overestimate the - ability of Greek houses to com- pete for Freshman. I attended the Student Fo-.rum meeting this past Tuesday as a concerned student who is inter- ested in seeing not only hmvthe Studet1t Forum was going to '\take on\ this issue, but also to measure the general consensus on this is- sue. Unfortunately, the Student Formtt has turned into a circus. Memb-ers stormed out left 11ncl right, people came to the brink of tears and nothing--absolu. tely nothing--got done. When the is- sue of a referendum was brotight up by Randy PeUish, the senior trustee, it turned immediately into melee. Ben Fox and Stephanie Lavine felt like the whole i:ssue was about the Greek vs. the Anti- Greek when, in fact, it has. It:oth- ing to do with it. It was about rep- resentation, not Greeks, and people were not being direct! J at- tacked. The fact that they -have representation and others c:lo not definitely brin.gs them int(). the discussion, but for them to say that they are being \blindsided'\' and \attacked\ because they are Greek is ridiculous. Hopefully, the referendum that Randy Pellish offered will be put to the students. Basi- cally, it asks the students one q\lestion. Should special interests be represented on the Student Forum? I would be completely satisfied to see the st\ldents vote either way. If they vote \YES\ then the Student Forum will have to grant representation to Theme Houses. If the students vote \NO\ then the Student Forum wiH be forced to remove the IFC and Pan hellenic representa- tives from the Forum. Hope- fully, the Student Forum will find the wisdom to sit down and discuss this issue without screaming and yelling at each other. Secondly, who honestly thinks tbat Theme Houses shouldn't have representation? Sincerely, Brandon D. Declet Protest to Media's Liberal Bias To the Editor(s): In an article in the September 26, 1996 issue of The Concordiensis, entitled \A Look ., ~t Dol~ and the R~publican Party,\ Ms. Erika Mancini's claims tilat the media, Holly- wood, and the faculty feed the liberal bias of Union College, as dol!s the tJ nited States, are ~ot only incorrect, but they are bor- dering on ignorance. While I do feel empathy for Ms. Mancini when she states that her political views caused her to remain si- lent in the fifth grade when faced with. a greater number of non- Bush supporters, I still do not feel that it is correct for the illustri- ous author to declare that the \lib=- eral agenda\ Of the national po- litical scene is set by the media. The media is demonized by the right as a bastion of immoral and unethical behavior. The fagt is, the viewers and purchasers of media set the agenda by paying for this choice of entertainment. This behavior is protected by the First Amendment's defense ·of freedom of expression. The in-- dictment of the faculty as liber- als who try to indoctrinate, mf'.ybe Ms. would to brain- wasll, is simply inane. The·fac- ulty and staff of Union Cotlege are professionals, who allow1heir students to make their own in- formed decisions. To say that they cannot help .~ut pass on 1heir libe'ral views to their students i.s · to say thatthe faculty and staff is anything but professional. Ms. Mancini's article also tries to show President Clinton. in an extremely liberal light. If Ms. Mancini had been paying a.tten- tion to American politics tllis year, she would have realized tbat this is just not true. By signing the Telecommunications Dec:ency Act and the Defense of Marriage bill, and by ending the social se- curity net first instituted by FDR, President Clinton showed· tllatlle is, in fact, far from a liberal. The TDA borders on being a fas- cist violation of J}le right to free- dom of speech between inc:li-vi<lll- als and majority and leaves tlte federal, state, and local go-vern- ments to decide what offensive material is.

Does Ms. Mancini feel that in a fifth-grade classroom with few supplies and forty. students, the teacher will be abl~ to provide a stronger, safer, more comfortable environment? Denying funding for education does little to ad- vance the image of America as a leader in protecting children, let alone to the promote an image as progressive national commu- nity. The same can be said for the issues of welfare and univer- sal health care. The traditional family is no longer the norm in this nation, and it is important for someone to step in and provide the services that the family should but cannot. The only organiza- tion with enough strength to shOulder this weight is the Fed- eral government. Finally, what does the term \flaming l.iberal\ imply? It seems to me the term is meant to be pejorative and. frankly, it seems to me that that just pro- motes the. image that Ms. Mancini is trying to dispel. Sincerely, Edward W.Abbott, III VOICE YOUR OPINION ON CAMPUS! WRITE A LETTER TO THE EDITOR! McKenzie Takes Some Heat To a large extent, Greek life . on campus has taken abuse through The Concordiensis. · While many understand that cer-- tain writers feel a need to focus on makiag others look bad, last week's Features article on the mistreatment of Schenectady citizens was written more as an attack on fraternities than as a ·serious student's concern for · · community relations. The article's introduction at- tempts to facetiously describe the entrance of our town ·s citi- zens onto the campus. The hu- mor was lost on me. Further- more, I would be surprised to learn that the brothers of Theta Delta Chi are not insulted at the misrepresentation of their fraternity's letters. A !so, I'm · positive that no member of any fratemity would be pleased with being quoted as a \brotha\. This article was simply insulting. As a member of Phi Delta Theta I was upset at the picture that Conor McKenzie has de- cided to present. There are prob- Letter to the Editor: After reading Conor McKenzie's articles entitled, \Epidemic on Campus: 'Do ids' at Frats,\ I was enraged. In the weekened to which Conor re- ferred, I had the bene tit ofbeing at a Fraternity where two \'Doids\ were asked to leave. Before anyone gets uptight shout this discriminating behavior, let me offer the facts. On the night of September 21st, I was a guest at a fraternity party. Now, let's . be honest with each other. We can all pick out a \non-Union student\ at a fraternity party, not by their clothes or by their skin color, but simply because we at- tend a. school of only 2000 stu- dents. A stranger is hard to miss. At this party, I was continually sexually harassed by these '\'Doids.\ I did everything I could to avoid them. I moved, l asked them to stop, and I even pushed one of them off of me. . Finally, while I was talking to a !ems with non-students entering the campus. This should not be limited to fraternity parties which have occurred. Perhaps tne ten inc.idents .of attacks/ muggings in the first term of '94- '95 school year are beyond Conor's memory. Perhaps if the students who were attacked had not been so rude to the man with a shotgun, it would not have happened. It is also clear to me that the citizens who . would like to gain entrance to our school's parties are not so- cial workers either. Clearing up the air between our school and the town in which we live cannot be ad- dressed in the manner in which it was presented in The Concordiensis. These problems can be addressed ina more suit- able manner. Just as there are articles which can be written in a more suitable manner. Kristian E. Sanchack Phi Delta Theta Fraternity President brother, they decided to leave, but not without grabbing my ass on the way out. I followed af- ter this young man to offer him a few choice words of my own. His friend then proceeded to grab me and throw me on the floor of the fraternity. It was at this point that the brothers ofthe fraternity escorted these \gentlemen\ out of their house. Now, I would like to take this moment to thank all of the brothers of this fraternity. I found their behavior to be nei- ther elitist nor discriminating, but corrunendable. Finally, Conor, I'd like to ask you if you saw what happened. If you did, what if your own sister or mother was the target of such behavior? What would you have done? Sincerely, Melissa I nfuma --I was at Chi Psi that night. and my mom doesn't go to frat parties. C.M

True, no woman in this election is actually run- ning for the presidency or the vice presidency, but neverthe- less, two key females sparkle conspicuously at the top ofthe presidential race. Already in the White House, Hillary Clinton seeks a second term as First Lady, while Elizabeth Dole will become the 43rd First Lady of the United States ifher husband is elected in Novem- ber. Af\'btltoos WoMeN ... As 1l\~'1 DoN 'r \f~Y lo - R~Fo~~ HeALlH tAJ:!~! Both First-Lady contenders are extraordinary women. Hillary Clinton and Elizabeth Dole are accomplished, career women in the fullest sense of the words. The fact that both Mrs. Clinton and Mrs. Dole have become successful women in the traditionally male-domi- nated worlds ofbusiness, law, and politics reflects the present day, when more and more women are seeking success through their careers. For the first-time, this is the case concerning both First Lady candidates. In fact, notions that these two women are as quali- fied as, if not more qualified than, their husbands--the can- didates--are crossing American minds. Numerous jokes allude to Hillary as being the \real'' controller of the presidency, and the latest articles on Elizabeth Dole question why she isn't running for president insead of Bob. It has become quite evi- dent that these; women are highly respected and regarded their po 1 itical philosophies. Both come fm1n close-knit Methodist families. Both graduated from prestigous col- leges and went on to law school. Finally, both women have be- come extremely successful at what they do. Since Hillary Clinton is al- ready the First Lady, the public already knows much about her. She graduated with honors from Wellesley in 1969. She went on to Yale Law School where she met Bill Clillton. In 1975, ·they married and moved to Ar- kansas where· they taught to- gether on the Ia\'\' faculty of the Clinton chaired the Task Force on National Health Care Re- form. This entailed 19 months of discussion with doctors, nurses, and health careofficiat.s across the country in order to learn more about current health care in Af11erica and how it could h~ improved. She also has written a book, It Takes a Village, which is one of the many ways she has worked to help children. Many would ar- gue that Hillary Clinton has re- shaped the position of First Lady for better or for worse.

As president of the Red Cross, she has raised over $587 million and has brought the $162 million corporation up to speed with the collecting, test- ing, and distributing of blood. Curreqtly, she. has takell a year's leave ofabsense to help campaign for her husband. Originally from North Caro- lina, Elizabeth Dole earned a B.A in International Affairs and Political Science from Duke University. While at Duke, she spent a summer at Oxford and travelled to Russia during the peak of the Cold· War. Other accomplishmellt~- during her college years include being on the Freshman Advisory Coun .. cil, the Wom:en ?s Judicial· Board, and thewomep' s student govemment~ofwflich she was . president. In tae. year that..she graduated (195&), the school newspaper named her Campus Lea(ier .of the Year-· for both the men's caJ:ll.-:PUS and ·the. women's campus. She attended graduate school !ltHarvardand got her M.A .. in Education and Government. In 1965, she. was one of 27 womentq graduate in a class of 495 ft~:?tn Harvard LawScho.ol. For a woman s() \.independent and liberated,\ :onen1ay .find it odd that Elizabeth Dole is not revered; or really even admired, by feminists.. This is most likely due to her conservatism and to the fact thatshe continues to up- hold traditional female roles. Elizabeth Dole was Duke's 1958 May Queen, which was in part a beauty ceutest, and she once held a job modelling suits at ladies' luncheons. She has never given up her femininity. In fact, having kept her tradi- tionally feminine roles seems to have enhanced her character and popularity. They say that l:::Iillary and Elizabeth are quite curious, in a competitive way~ about each . other. ,They an~ rivals not on~y in the sense that they are run- ning for the job of First-Lady, but they are opposing forces when it comes to women's roles. If a debate between the two were to takeplace, it would probably be watcned by more people than any of the presiden- tial debates. Don't you think? Tickets $4 in advance, $5 at the door.

Political Opinions POLITICAL RHETORIC AT ITS WORST WHAT DOLE HAS IN STORE FOR AMERICA . . - . . . . by Jody :Mousse~ll Stajf.Writer '~Let's ·win one for the Gipper,'' are words that the American public ·nears reiter~ ated in the·vaice of Republican Presidential· Candidate Bob Dole. Dole may have more to offer the United States., aside from senioritY (and bananas and · pineapples).

Both books were lost, and he hadn't even finished col- oring one of them.\ Along the same lines, Dole commented on Kemp, stating, \Kemp wants a business deduction for hair spray.\ The American public has now been told to entrust the futUre of their great her'itage, their $4 trill'ion deficit, their bil- lions worth of bombs and the future of their children to the hands of the two gentlemen who could not both cal1 the kettle black two years ago.

Potenza Contributing Writer Bob Dole \deserved\ the nomination of his party for presi- dent:--or so the pundits, gurus, and experts from coast to coast have explained with authority. The thinking of Republican pri- mary voters then must have gone something like this: Bob Dole is th~ majority leader of the US Senate; he's suffered through the heartbreak of failed presiden- tial campaigns so many times before; he's a well financed and well organized politician; and he was a war hero, too. Also, how old is he? Seventy-six? Well, he just has to be our nomi- nee. He is the most senior mem- ber of our party. We've all seen the stickers: \Bob Dole is 96.\ But t!1e sticker-makers and gurus who inspired them miss the point. Dole is not a candidate for presi- dent because Republican voters thought his seniority in Ameri- can political life obligated them to vote for him. Strom Thurmond is ninety-four and no one in the party is chomping at the bit to brighten the election season with the wisdom of his years. No, Dole is a candidate not because of seniority, but be- cause, unlike most others in poli- .tics, he has exhibited through- out his political career a pru- dence that is sorely needed in American political life. Pru- dence, most simply, is the abil- ity to govern and discipline one- self by the use of reason. Ex- tended to the realm of politics, this definition has a decidedly less individualistic orientation. As the scholar Russell Kirk ar- gues in his wonderfully insight- ful book The Politics of Pru- dence, one who exercises pru- dence in politics is one who judges matters of policy by their \long-run consequences, not merely by temporary advantage or popularity.\ In his campaign against Bill Clinton - perhaps one of the least prudential presidents in American history -: Bob Dole offers not mere seniority but an understanding of the need for · political prudence in the White House for which the institution of the presidency is wanting. For Clinton, matters of policy are judged almost entirely by their temporary advantage and popularity. Witness the signing ceremony of the welfare reform bill a few weeks ago and you witness not a man who believes that people will be better off in the long-run without the assur- ance of government assistance, but a man whose advisor told him, as a prostitute listened, that the welfare bill had to be signed. The polls showed that people fa- vored the reform rather heavily. Watch the news reports on the recent bombing of Iraq after a group of Iraqi Kurds re~uested Saddam Hussein's aid in fight- ing Iranian Kurds. Then watch Clintonjumptwenty points in the polls as most of the country scratches their heads wondering why US military force was needed at all. Or perhaps we should turn our attention to drugs. Not the marijuana, co- caine, and heroin whose use has increased well over a hundred percent in recent years~ but nico- tine, that scourge of American society that Clinton has prom- ised with campaign season pru- dence to combat with the full force of the federal government. These policy decisions are not the decisions of a prudential man; they are the decisions of a man for whom thinking about the long-term is of no consequence, unless that thinking is about the long-term of his career. Of course the savvy guru, cer- tain to save the president from the embarrassment that Dole may have much more to offer than seniority, would point out that Dole' too has made his share of policy choices based on short term gain - a proposed 15% tax cut by a man known as a deficit hawk has the air of Clintollesque imprudence. But does it really? It does only if Dole has aban- doned his life-long desire to shrink the deficit, which it does not appear he is about to do. What he has done is attempted to merge the ideas of two groups within the party-the deficit hawks and the supply-siders. Whether or not this syntl1esis can be made will be seen if Dole is elected; and only the cynic- or the guru- would dismiss Dole's attempt to unify his party on eco- nomic issues as a policy meant for short term gain. It's doubtful that Dole called his advisor at the Jefferson Hotel .to find out what the polls said about tax cuts. He used reason. Good, old-fash- ioned reason and faith tlmt people can use the extra money from tax cuts more wisely than bureaucrats in Washington.

My last column seemed to stir up some controversy and misinterpretations, so I thought one or two thoughts on the sub- ject would fill the space nicely. I sympathize. Never-the-less,. do anyone need to call every resident of Schenectady a .. Doid\? Is it really necessary to treat ev- ery resident with the as- sump- tion that they're all to get us. No one de- never serves that level of disrespect. On i n - tended terms of principle, the word to be- little anyone who \Doid\, is every bit wrong and may have been hurt by a resident disgusting as any racial epithet, ofSchenectady-to the contrary, or slang. In reference to lack of any re- spect due to the fraternities on this campus, I might of- fer this .advice. Don't act like you deserve the same reverence ap- propriate for a monastic order. Learn the difference between hq- mor, and an attack on your dig- nity. I, in turn, will write \T-0\ instead ofTee-Dee. 10. Many Union students not fascinated by small shiney objects. 9.

The way this place destroys the female self- esteem never ceases to boggle the mind ....... by Peter Sorensen Sketch Master Today I fell asleep on my couch wondering ifl werethe laziest per- son l had ever met. Then it oc- c'Urred to me that if I were both myself and the laziest person I'd ever met, I would be lazier than myself (impossible). This con- fused me, and I fell asleep. I awoke with a vague sensation of irrespon- sibility, and as my eyes searched for something to focus on, a famil- iar voice assaulted me from the periphery. \Come check out this story my old soccer coach sent me,\ the voice invited. I stared at the screen, a pleasant blur in the distance, and felt myself sink lower into the couch. I tried to think of other reasons to get up~ I'm hun- gry. I want to toss a disc, I shoula shower, I have work to do, it's 5 o'clock ... The voice gave way to laugh- ter, and though I was curious about the story, my body gave way to my ... stomach. I found the fridge. \This is pathetic,\ I thought as I ate some peanutbutter and chocolate pudding. I wandered outside on the fire escape and was enveloped. by blue sky and gentle breeze. My eyes closed, and I tried to recall the day. OK: I woke up, I went for a walk. I went home. I sat on the porch and read about ancient Greek purification rituals ... for 4 minutes and 37 seconds. I ate an omelet at West which made me seriously consider the benefits of fasting. I stared blankly at a secu- rity person while she yelled at me from below. I contemplated my situatio11. I stared blankly. I tried to ignore. Finally, I realized that I had to leavethefireescapeand un- propthe door. Yaaay, me. Then, l found the cot1ch. I'm not especiaHy proud ofth is~ it's now 7 o'clock, and I still have mountains of work to do, its too dark for Frisbee, someone else is in the shower and I'm hungry. It's days like this that all I really want is a scapegoat; uhhm ... l'm only lazy because my days are too long ... or, I'm not lazy, I just take my time. Or maybe I'll face the truth: really, my night was too long. I feel like a freshman, I won't do it again ... the weekend was too short. Heck, the whole tenn is too short. What an anti-climatic thought: Columbus day, a 3-day weekend! But no. that privilege would pertain to the rest of the world. We at Union just cram it all into those ten little weeks. I'm starting apetition. Take the Safe Space Challenge This upcoming Tuesday and Wednesday, Safe Space of Union College will present a challenge to the Union college community.

Twister, co-written by l\1 ichael Crichton and his wife Anne- Marie Martin, keeps everyone's adrena- line pumping thanks to the un- stoppable visual effects and awe- some, thunderous sound of vari- ous tornadoes ripping through the Midwest, destroying barns and hurtling cows through the air. Considering that the threat in this movie is a force of nature, the task of making the characters' I ives seem in constant peril is chal- lenging. Thisiswherethefilm's weakest links are, in pitting Bill Paxton and Helen Hunt (as stonn- chasers) against twisters of in- creasing ferocity and force. The duo were once a couple, and Paxton brings his new fiancee (Jami Gertz) along for the ride, but she cannot stomach the thrills, and soon Paxton and Hunt fall for each other again. Crichton tries to throw in other characters, like Cary Elwes as a \rival\ stonn ~racker, but his pres- ence adds little except for the thrill of a chase Unlike his usual self, Crichton doesn't seem to be in it for the science all that much. The script concerns itself with chatter about F -class twisters briefly at a dinner table conversation, but otherwise, Paxton and Hunt are mainly seen scrambling into their van to chase yet another natural disaster. Director Jan De Bont (Speed) turns this badly-written, small-plot story into a heart-stopping action piece. So what iftomadoesdon't generally happen as frequently as depicted in the film~ Whether the twister is two feet behind the stonn chaser, devouring fences behind them, or cleverly tearing apart a drive-in movie screen showing Jack from The Shining, De Bont makes tornadoes seem every bit as frightening and tough to es- cape from as the shark inJawsor the velociraptors of Jurassic Park. The parts of Twister which ap- pear used are overshadowed by the si1:nple fact that a fairly unex- citing concept could be made with such gusto. Now that Twister is available on videocassette (Warner Home Video, $22.95 sug- gested retail price), you can watch this visually-stunning film over and over One note choose the widescreen edition on tape.

rts & [ntertainment . · . : 'illlp· Q.h~ttcl1:rbiett£;Jis. • October 3, 1996 !I Pagf )3 CAMPUS FILM FILE: TWISTER by Lawrence Paska Arts Editor ·· Edttor 's Note:· Portions of this review appeared in the May 16, 1996 isstte<J[The Concerdiensls. Twister; co-written by Michael CI:'ichton arid his wife Anne-Marie Martin, keeps ever)'one' s adrena- line pumping thanks to the un- stoppable visual effeots and awe- some, thunderous sound of vari- ous tornadoes ri·pping through the Midwest, destroying barns and hurtlingcows through the air. Considering that the threat in this movie is a force ofnature, the task of making the characters' lives seem in constant peril is chal- lenging. This is where the film's weakest links are~ it'l pitting Bill Paxton and Helen Hunt (as stonn- chasers) against twisters of in- creasing ferocity and force. The duo were once a couple, and Paxton brings his new fiancee (J ami Gertz) along for the ride, but she cannot stomach the thrills, · and soon P~ton and Hunt faH for each other again., Crichton tries to throw in other characters, like Cary Elwes as. a \rivar' stonn tracker, but his pres- ence adds little except for the thrill of a chase: Unlike his usual self, Cri·chton doesn't seem to be in it for the science: aiJ that much. The script concerns its'elfwith chatter abottt F-tlass-twisters briefly at a dinner table conversation, but otherwjse, ,Paxton.and Hunt are mainly seen scrambling into t~eir van to chase yet another natural disaster. Director Jan De Bont (Speed) tums.this badly-written, small-plot story into abeart.-stopping action piece. So what if tornadoes don't general:Jy happen as frequently as depicted in the film:? Whether the twister is two feet behind the stonn chaser; devouring fences behind them, or cleverly tearing apart a drive-in movie screen showing Jack from The Shining, De Bont makes tornadoes seem every bit as frightening and tough to es- cape from as the shark inJawsor the velociraptors of Jurassic Park. The parts of Twister which ap- pear used are overshadowed by the simple fact tltat a fairly unex- citing conceptcould be madewith such gusto. Now that Twister is available oh videocassette (Warner Home Video, $22.95 sug- gested retail p~ice), you can · watch this visually-stunning film over and over. One note: choose the wiclescreen edition on tape. Somehow, the thrill of seeing the actors run from vuture will seem less thrill'ing when the tornado is cut from the scene to format the movie to y:ourtelevisionscreen. Rating: *** (outoffour) Thisweek'scampus film: Na- tional Lampoon's Animal House. If only Union's fraternities had John Belushi ... this classic first film from National Lampoon is brought back to the b.ig screen this Friday through Monday at 8 and IOPM.

Women's Soccer Overcomes Hamilton X-C{.No.t_es by Aaron J. Sicotte Staff Writer As the first half of last Tuesday's game progressed, it looked as though Hamilton would be walking away with an easy vic- tory. If not for the play of junior goalkeeper Sarah Retersdorf, Union would have found itself down a few goals early in the game. The play was concentrated in Union's defensive end (or the majorityofthehalf Union played caut·iously and tlat, as they got beat to I oose balls, and were gen- erally outmatched. Fortunately, even though they c0uld not get much going offensively, the de- fense played extraor.d.inarily. Lead by .Iulie Barton, Amy Powell, and Taryn Samol, Union was able to stymie Hamilton's chances and keep them away from the goal. But even they were not able to fend off the Hamilton offense. With twenty-six minutes remaining in the first half, Union experienced a defensive let-down, and an un- marked Hamilton player was able to capitalize with a perfect shot past a surprised Retersdorf. Union fought back. Surging forth thirteefJ minutes later on a rare first-half offensive rush, Union's Elizabeth Fisher Lofted a perfect cross into Hamilton's box. Freshman Samantha Ryall leaped up and connected with the cross and headed the ball past the • keeper into the back of the net, tying the game for Union. As the first half came to a close, both teams exchanged scoring oppor- tunities. With under eight minutes remaining, Hamilton created a great scoring chance for them- selves, but were turned back by a greatsave by Retersdorf. With un- der a minute remaining Union came forth with an opportunity of their own, but they two were stopped by a great save. Hamilton then pushed the ball up field and was able to take advantage of a quick strike, and took the lead with a 1nere thirty-six seconds remain- ing on the clock, and Union went into half-time down2-l. Inspired by the unfortunate tum of events, Union came out in the second halftired up and look- ing to tie the game once again. They continued to pressure Hamilton and back them up into . their defensive ena. With thirty- seven minutes remaining in the freshman Sarah Cardullo Women'sSoccer Edges Hamilton: (plloto by Laurie Kirsclter/TC) took it upon herselfto notch the tying goal. She dribbled inside the eighteen, froze a Hamilton defenseman with a great move, and fired a shot past a stunned Hamilton keeper. Union contin- ued to pressure Hamilton throughout the half, and tum away their offensive attempts: Junior Lauren Siegal came off the bench, and was a virtual de~ fensive wall, refusing to allow any Hamilton players near Union's goal. She created a great offensive play with thirty min- utes to play, which nearly re- sulted in a goal by Autumn Renn. Twenty minutes later, and after numerous opportunities, Union was finally able to take the lead. pass,. Ryall exploded past Hamilton's defense for a near- breakaway. As tJqe defe11se caught up to her, she lofted a beautiful shot of adiving keeper into the far cor- ner of the net torhersecor\d goal of the game. With the victory, Union raised its overall record 3-1, and its league record to 1-1. This is a great start for a team that is made up of over 60% freshmen, and only has eight players with varsity experience.

They emerged relatively unscathed, and only slightly nauseous. On September 21, Union traveled to Siena College to battle back from a disappointing season opener against R.PI. Siena's Knights were in fine form, boasting a shrewd game plan that featured a field designed to fit exactly 30 dwarfs. Unfortunately, both the Union and Siena sides were full sized (notable exceptions to the rule Lux and Smith felt extremely comfort- able on the miniature pitch), and therefore, play was somewhat constricted. Siena jumped out to an early lead, while Union concen- trated on thinking small thoughts. After the meditation led by Pike Mody, had settled everyone down, Union roared into action. Faced with a Siena team prone more tc fisticuffs than forward passes, the Smokin' Dutchmen reached deep within themselves ... and pulled out sev- eral gum v.rrappers, a picture of Erik Estrada, and most importantly, a bumingdesire to roll over every- thing in their way. Und~terred by a I 0 point deficit. Union pulled it- self together, and started to play rugby. Aftertheline scored a bril- liant try, the serum had its say. Union demonstrated fifteen-man rugbyby taking the ball down the field on one side, then recovering it and scoring on a brilliant 800- yard pass from Brian Field (the pass actually circled the earth four times and disturbed worldwide telecommunications) to Chris Weiler, who deftly dodged one Siena defender, and then ran three more over en route to scoring in style, with a swan dive. After Field added the conversion, it was up to the team to hold the lead ... and hold they did, despite the efforts of a clearly corrupt Siena line judge to give Siena points for a kick that actually was more off target than the humor in this article. Fortu- nately, Seth Brown was judging the kick, and the referee agreed with Seth's denial of Siena's un- earned points. The \B\ side ex-. hibited thrliller instincts we've come to expect from them and managed to leave Siena with a lot mote experience, as well as some souvenir Siena teeth. Last Saturday it was on to Oneonta, the top-ranked team in the division. The weather was typically rugby, which is to say that there were hurricane-force winds and torrential monsoons. U11ion, hurt by injuries, struggled in a veryshort first half(the ref• eree apparently had· forgotten that fO'rty comes after thirty). and was down in the first few minutes of the second half by 17 points. Yes, the team, displayed admi- rable resolve and hung tough for a second half that somehow (seriously! )lasted n minutes (courtesy of our unnamed and venerable referee, who we refer to only as \The Buddha,.\') Union fought back to score a try on an impressive 42-play G-se- ries run back the pack, which culminated in a smashing try by Erik Menard. Jon Kaufman lent impressive support and energy from the flanker position, while Union's two rookie starters Matt & Tom played admirably in their first A-side action. Union was robbed of an almost sure try by the infamous phantom whistle, and ended the game unbowed, unbeaten, but apparently de- feated. Fortunately, a crack \dream team\ of lawyers was assembled, and, after much pe- rusalofthe situation, it was de- termined by Judge Lance Ito that Oneonta had, in fact, been play- ing with ineligible players, de- spite warnings from New York State Rugby. This fact prompted the league to declare aU of Oneonta ~s wins to be for- feited, and Union belatedly acheived a victory. Union's B- side featured admirable play by many members, as well as an apparent identity crisis bej:ween Pike Mody and Matt Lux. For-. tunately, things seemed to work out, though the game was caJ.led prematurely due to intemperate cl i- mate and temper. Once again, the B's played a fierce game, led by scruin captain Mark G<JI oboy, and aided by a couple of shadowy char- acters who we will, to protecttheir identity, refer to as Mr. X and Mr. Y ·(though their real names are Seth arrd Lothar). Kudos to all of the Union rookies, who have displayed admirable courage, cunning, and determination. Thanks also to our opposition, arid we now look to roll on to Binghamton, to contest them for a berth in the State Champion- ships. 5.A.Audette 21:28 13. C. McNamara 22:37 14. K. Jamieson 22:00 22.

S JOiis · WI c illlllttt~roicnsis • Octobet· 3, 199'\' P:tae 15 Settli11g tile Score . ----- ---- -- Football Off to See the Wizard~ .. by Chris Leone Sport$ Editor St. Louis, Missouri - This past weekend the St, Louis Cardinals spent a three game series com- rnemoratingtlJe career ofthe gn~at shortstop Osborne Earl Smith, otherwisereferred to as Ozzie by those.he calls his.close friends and fans. He would he nicknamed the \Wizard ofO~\ for the amazing ease, grace. and superhuman. abilities with which he played the game over eighteensmnmer$. After-being tradeelfrom the San Diego Pa.Qrf)S to the C~rdina:ls in 1982'-0zzie_grew to bec.ome tbe leader of an organization that wouldgo.ontowinthe 1982 World Series and later add two National League crowlls in l98S artd 1987. ·Never known as an offensive pres- ence Ozzie was probably the quintessential defensive infielder of the past twenty five years. Between l980 and 1992, he took home thirteen gold gloves and would make twelve all star appear- ances. , On Friday night, I had the chance to take in one of those three games at Busch Stadium. The score of the game did not matter. Itdidnotmatterwho was winning, all that really mattered on that day was to catch a glimpse and say 'good llye to a legend. It had rained all day but that did not keep the crowd· away. Fathers brought their childnm to see a man that had meant as much to the franchise as Joe Dinag.io meant to the New York Yankees. The starting line up was an~ nouncedforthe gatne,an<l Ozzie was no ton the list.

It is\i!npossible to predi<:t if the world will ever see such a short- stop again. Some critic;s.sa.:y that Rey Ordonez is the next up and . coming wizard, but it might take ten to fifteen years to judge that claim. Inanerainwhichm()stplay- ers last five seasons in the 1najors ifthey ~re lucky, Ozzie played the game hard every season. Tn()ugh he never challenged the C()nsec~­ tive game streak like Cal Ri pken Jr.,. he always had the ability to bring magic to a g-ame at any given moment \Whatl did, I didevery day,\ Smith said. \Anyone can make a great play every now and then on any given day. But what I did~ I did every day:' He was not a player who we read.about on the back pages hav~ ing gotten into trouble with the law. That attribute in a career is as great as any stat compiled dUF- ing tltis era efbaseball. Ozzie did net let the spotlight get to him, and he stayed out of the fast lane of drugs and alcohol that has burned out so niany of the great gifted players of the I 980's. In- st~ad of delving into these prQb- lems, he became someone forchil- drentolook up to at~d for a city to embrace~ On Saturday, Ozzie closed his faiewell speech by thanking all the _ fa11s- \for traveling along his yel- lo-w brick road.\ It is .notthe fans wbodeservethethank you's, but it is the wizard himself who <:le- se-w(ls aU the accolades for creat ~ ingsuch a beautiful trip. * * * * * * * * * It-was the same story this week with Union Football. Shuron Morton and the defense lead the · way, while penalties almost cost the team the game. Last week I gave you an upset special and picked the Giants to beat the then undefeated Vikings. Fo:rall tflose who listened, I hope yournade a little spending money. Thjs week take the Raiders and the points over the Jet's, while Cincinnati will rebound and blow out Houston. My father insisted that l give h illl credit for .last weeks pick, and then proceeded to tell me that the Colts were going to beat the Bill's. Just so l can brag when he is wrong, pick the Bill's. A Nick Kammerman update: Citing obligationsto his academ- · ics and the Lacrosse team, Nick will unfortunately have to torgo writing forthe Concordiensis. He will be greatly missed but we in the sports section realize that this move is in the best interestofthe team. September 29th, came and went witl1 the passing of yet another great sports milestone. The Bos- ton Red Sox have once again gone another year without a world championship. Several people have com- plained about my comments di- rected at the Hockey program. A few even went as far as toques- tion my sources about students possibly paying for tickets. While my references are not going to be given out, I will say that these ru- mors did come from several people who are in some way involved with Union sports. There was no attempt made to demean the Hockey program. The Union Hockey program and its players are a class act. continuedftompaJJe 16 hope we win.''

Both goals were scored by fresh- man midfielder Bryn Heath, less than fourminutesapart. The team was anchored by the steady goalkeeping of Freshman Jeff Thomas aud the strong Dutchmen defense. Both teams slugged it out and played to a stalemate in the first half, with Union controlling the tempo for the m{)st part. Vassar had a few decent scoring chances, but the solid Union de- fense and outstanding goalkeeping by JeffThomas kept the game scoreless in the first half. Although Union controlled the ball for the majority of the half, they were unable to convert on any quality scoring opportunities. The Dutchmen appeared to have the momentum in their favor going into the second half To get the donuts off the scoreboard, Heath netted a goal as he crept past the Vassar defense. Sopho- more Ted Neuberg who hac:IIJeen playing well all day, set up the scoring opportunity by threading a pass through the loose Vassar defense, letting a wide ()pen Heath take the ball in for a goal. Heath said of the goal, ''Ted made a great play and gave me a great pass. I happened to he in the right place at the right time. The entire team played great.\ The. Dutchmen offense stayed on task by punching in an()ther goal less than four minutes after the first one.

Union Wins as Morton Breaks Record by Frank Rossi Staff Writer It wasn't the \St. Lawrence Sur- prise,\ but it was darn close. The Hobart Statesmen, especially their defense, kept the game interest- ing, literally until the last second, as they narrowly lost to the Union College Fighting Dutchmen 24 to 22 For the third-straight week, t Inion drew first blood. After just two minutes, senior tailback Shuron Morton took a backfield pitch 81 yards, giving the Dutch- men a quick 7-0 lead Morton would add another I S2 yards to give him a Union Dutchmen single-game record of263 yards rushing (averaging 7 7 yards per carry) Kojo A ttah hroke the same record last season against Roch- estenvith 250 yards (hreaking Sam llammerstrom 's 5A-vcarold record nf23Ayards) Afterhreakingthe record, Morton said, \Without the win, the yards wouldn't have meant anything. My heart was in my feet coming down to the fourth quarter. We survived, and every- thing is good now.\ Survival was the name of the game for Hobart as the Statesmen answered Morton's run with an interception return for a touch- down by Geoff Harrison, evening the game at 7-7. The interception was the first of the season and one of three Saturday thrown by quarterback Tom McKeown-. With heavy wind throughout the game, both teams struggled with passes and kicks. Union punter Judson Zachar averaged only 28 yards on his seven punts, but he ended up playing a pivotal role at the conclusion of both halves. With the score still tied at 7-7 and only one minute remain- ing in the first half, Zachar booted a 44-yard punt to Hobart's one- foot line. The Dutchmen regained possession at Hobart's 20 with five seconds remaining after a poor Hobart punt. Kicker Roger Eghcrt nailed the ensuing 3 7-yard field goal as the half expired, giv- ing Union a I 0-7 halftime lead. Nobody knew just how important that kick was at the time. The second half started strong for Union as Hobart went three- and-out and punted the ball only six yards to the Hobart 24-yard line Four plays later, running back Justin Bourque, who earlier left the game with a lacerated thumb, ran left for an 11-yard touchdov.n. I Iohart answered with a sevcn- m i nute touchdown drive of their own, helped hy three Union pen- alties With the score 17-14, Morton took control on the next drive with 57 yards on seven car- ries. The drive ended with a one- yard run for a touchdown, again by Justin Bourque. Union's ten- point third-quarter lead seemed safe, but it was not Sloppiness reigned in the fourth quarter. Judson Zachar had a punt blocked for the first time this season, giving Hobart the ball at Union's 27. Two plays later, though, defensive back Dom Pitaniello intercepted a Hobart pass. Sloppy play continued in Union's next drive as Tom McKeown had his third-down pass picked off deep in Union ter- ritory, and with 7: 19left, Hobart kicker Aaron Backhaus shanked a 37-yard field goal as it fell well Unioll runller squeezes through Hobart deje11sive line.

This turnover combined with an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty against Union helped lead to a touchdown for the Statesmen. After a successful two-point con- version, the Dutchmen's lead shrunk to 24-22 with 4:50 left. Union was forced to punt the ball back to Hobart at the 3:23 mark, allowing Hobart to drive to Union's 38-yard line. After two incomplete passes (one ofwhich was broken up by defensive back Bill Mehleisen), Hobart faced a fourth and eight with I :05 to play. Instead of kicking a long, poten- tially game-winning field goal of 55 yards, Hobart attempted an- other pass. Defensive back Charrod Riley knocked the pass out of bounds right at the first- down marker. With eight seconds remaining, the Dutchmen were forced to punt one final time, and Zachar barely avoided having an- other punt blocked as he angled the ball out of bounds. After some confusion, the referees learned that time had expired, finally se- curing Union's victory of24-22. Audino's Mood Mixed Head Coach John Audino had mixed emotions about the narrow win. He maintained his \a win is a win\ philosophy, and he pointed out that the crowd of 3,200 fans was phenomenal, often chanting loudly and cheering wildly. Audino said, \I thought the kids played with a lot of poise and a lot of heart at the end, and I think the fans were great. They were as loud as ever.\ When asked what he expects next week against Rochester, Audino replied, \I just continued on page 15 Field Hockey 5-1, Beats RPI and Skidmore by Jonathan Gasthalter Sports Editor The field hockey Dutchwomen opened the week with a 3-1 record and were ready to continue their four game road swing against Upstate Collegiate Athletic Asso- ciation rivals RPI and Skidmore.

Next week's games against Oneonta, Vassar, and St. Lawrence are going to be the deciding fac- tors. The game against St. Lawrence will be the true test,\ said Speanburg. The rookies and veterans have gelled well under rookie Coach Martha Morrison. Goaltender Rothschild has had a fabulous season, taking \Player of the Week\ honors for the week of September 16th. Rothschild at- tributes her success to hard work and practice. \I worked last year with a coach who had a lot of ex- perience with the game. The coach this year has been very patient with us as a team, and lets me take control back there, which allows me to see my problems and correct them,\ said Rothschild.

Acts of kindness are far from absent in the campus community, and a demonstration of that benevolence was shown by the Phi Delta Theta Fraternity this past week. Profits from their com- munity car wash held this past Sunday were donated to the American Cancer Society in or- der to help finance ~ancerrelated programs. One of the comments made by a memberofPhiDelta Theta was, \As a part of tile Union and Schenectady community, we feel that it is important to give back to that commu11itysince we have gained so much from it.\ The fra- ternity, which d()nated two hun- dred dollars in total to the orga- nization, will help fund ACS pro- grams in Schenecta<iy and tile greater Capital RegiO-n.

The Greenhouse was established as a replacement for the Melitus Conservatory which was dismantled when the time Yulman Theater was built. The Robison Thurber Greel)- house comprises two spaces in the fonn of a research la.b and a teaching lab. It was constructed in answer to the Biology Department's urgent need for re- search facilities in the botanical sciences. The research lab is de- signed to accommodate 1-4 fac- ulty members. It is 432 square feet and features a cutting bench, fluorescent and arc lighting, acrylic walls with aluminum framing, thermostatically co11- trolled ventingand heating/cool- ing, and a sealed partition to the teaching area. The teaching lab provides a space for the instruction of stu- dents and a collection .of plant . specimens. Jt is designed to ac- commodate 15 students and an . instructor. Similarly equipped, · the teaching lab is approximately the same size as the research lab. Besides providing a research and teaching arena, the Greenhouse will also serve as a site for plant propagation for Jakson's Garden, · especially for the Robison Herb Garden and the Levine Wild- flower Garden. The dedication ceremony was . held to honor the donors who con- tributed generous gifts to make the building possible.

With over 500 students in atten- dance, the festival was a great success. Students from all classes who participated found it infor- mative. Employers and graduate school representatives were im- pressed with the quality of Union stl:ldents. Tom Denham, Assistant Direc- tor at the Career Development Center, described the Career Fes- tival as '~the kick-off to the re- cruiting season.\ Denham claimed, \Because the festival is so early in the term, it gives stu- dents incentive to get a jump-start on their resumes.\ Many of the companies repre- sented at the festival will be re- turning to campus this fall to in- terview students. The CDC has re- ceived positive feedback from several of the graduate schools and employers. Albany Law School commented, \'Students made an excellent impression ... very professional in dress, manner and questions.\ Hewitt Associates replied, \Ter- rific! Looking forward to inter- viewing students.\ The represen- tative from the Center for Dis- abled wrote that Union had \the best group of students I've ever encountered ... mature, interested, professional, good questions, nicely attired.\ One Union student has already received an internship at Pine Bush Technologies as a result of the opportunities at the Career Festival. The Career Festival is just one of many events organized by the CDC. In fact, the CDC has a busy schedule of events lined up for this fall term. Throughout the following months, several com- panies will be recru-iting on cam- pus. In addition, on October 15, there win be a meeting for all stu- dents interested in the Boston and New York Recruiting Days. Other programs include an intern- ship workshop on October 16th, «What Can I Do With a Major in Modem Languages?\· on October 23, and \How To Get What You Want UsingYourUnion Connec- tidns?\ on October 25th. Tom Denham encourages stu- dents in all fields of interest to take advantage of the facilities, programs and counseling at the Career Development Center. The Invisible Woman .by Nina Co hell Crinttihuting Writer On October 2, Union College welcomed Jann Matlock, Harvard University Associate Pmfessor · ofRomance Languages and Lit- eratures. The lecture was spon- sored by the_Department of Vi- sual Arts, the Women'sCommis- sion, and Women's Studies. Pro- fessor Charlotte Eyennan of the Visual Arts Department arranged Matlock's lecture entitled The In- visible Woman and her Secrets Unveiled, which is a section of a paper that will soon be published in the Yale Journal of Criticism. She is also the author of Scenes of Seduction: Prostitution, Hys- teria and Reading Difference in Nineteenth-Century France. Matlock discussed the issue of gender in nineteenth-century France, most specifically she dealt with the experiment of the invisible woman. This experi- ment or '~marvel of society\ con- sisted of a box-like structure hanging suspended from the ceil- . ing with a hom-like structtue pro- truding from it. This horm held the voice of an invisible woman that could answer all questions about the people in the room and objects that they held for her in- spection.

Randy Thornhill and psycholo- gist Steven Gangestad took this idea of symmetry to college cam- puses to see how Just last week :P-rofessor Butterstein t(')ld his anatomy class about the female penguin's re- markable·itbility to journey sev- eral weeks away from her nest and find herw~ty back across the fea- tureless t~rrain.

New studies sbow that we judge each other une\on- sciously, using rules ofwhicll we are not even aware. Of C'()Utse there are some features which> we consciously admire, but we are also viscerally attuned to small discrepancies in the size and syy.m- metry of facial bones and varia- tions in the. placement of b()dy weight. Like the scorpion fly, people are highly attunedtosymmetry, For example, Denzel Washingtan 's face is alm()st completely sym- metrical. Lyle Lovett's, ()11 the other hand,. is not. One might argue that Western movies or magazines have defined what beauty is, but psycholo--gist matters of beauty? facial photegraphs. Each pair con- sisted of one face considered at- tractive by adult judges and one which was not. She found that infants gazed significantly longer at the attractive faces. She o b- tained the same results when she used white female faces, black fe- male faces, orfuale faces. There- fore, there must be some innate rules which steer us towards beauty. One idea is that people use looks as an unconscious gauge ofreproductive fitness. Animals seem to use symmetry in this way. Given ideal conditions. paired fea- tured such as eyes, ears, and wings would match perfectly.

They then had the people fill out confi- dential fonns covering everything · from temperament to sexual be- havior. They found that the most syntmetricalmales had begun hav~ ing sex three to four years earlier then the most asymmetrical. For both men and women greater sym- metry correlated to a greater num- ber of sexual partners. In later studies, Gangestad found women more sexually responsivetosym- metrical men, and symmetrical men less attentive to partners and more I ikely to cheat on then1. Oddly enough, one of the qual i- ties shared by attractive people is their averageness. More then a century ago research~rs discov- ered that by superimposing pho- tographs of several faces, there- sult is a composite more attrac- tive then any of the components. Langlois explains that, \Individu- als with average population char- acteristics should be less likely to carry hannful genetic mutations.\ While we find average faces at- tractive, the most gorgeous are not average. As New Mexico State University psychologist Victor Jolinson has shown, they are extreme. .I ohnston uses a pro- gram which generates 30 facial images, all the same gender. The participant rates the faces on a scale of 1-9. The program then creates a new face by melding the top rated face with one of the other 29. This new face replaces the lowest rated face in the pool, creating a more beautiful popula- tion. The game ends when a face is rated a perfect I 0. (You may observe similar, but unrelated, 10 point studies being performed at Dutch Hollow.) By collecting people's ideals and comparing them to reality, .Johnston can measure the dis- tance between fantasy and real- ity. He finds that the ideal woman has a higher forehead than an av- erage one, fuller lips, a shorter jaw and a smaller chin and nose. Ac- cording to a 1993 study, the ideal 25 year old woman would have the proportionally larger lips of a 14- year-old-and an 11-year-old's deli- cate jaw. Her small face would make her eyes and cheekbones prominent Other findings, which Johnston has not yet published, suggest that ideal features for men include a big jaw, a strong chin, and an imposing brow . .Johnston points out that the features which make a man attractive are the opposite of the features which make a woman beautiful. These features are the ones which separate men from women. They are the result of the deluge of sex hormones which bring on adulthood Johnston reasons that hormonal abundance would have been a good clue to mate value for early man. Perhaps even more important then facial features is a perfectly shaped torso. Men place more stock in this feature then women. Once again, there are probably bio~ logical reasons behind the mea- surements men find attractive . ..... While any man can produce sperm, a woman's ability to bear children depends on her age and hormone levels. According to Donald Symons, an anthropolo- gist at the University of Cal ifor- n ia in Santa Barbara, \a larger pro- portion of a woman's mate value can be detected from visual cues.\ Before puberty and after meno- pause, females and males have similar waistlines. But while men gain bone and muscle during pu- berty,. women place nearly 35 pounds of fat around their hips and thighs. Those pounds con- tain the calories needed to sus- tain a pregnancy, and the curves they create provide a measure of reproductive potential. Denvendra Singh, a psycholo- gist at the University of Texas, uses two measurements while studying the relative beauty of bodies: weight and ratio. Healthy women typically have waist-hip ratios of.6 to .8, meaning that their waists are 60 to 80 percent the size of their hips. He divides the women into underweight, nonnal weight, and overweight groups. When men were asked to rank the figures for attractiveness, sexi- ness, and health the favorite, re- gardless of the age of the man judging, was a normal weight woman with a .7 waist-hip ratio. Second place was a normal weight woman figure 'with a .8 ratio. The underweight group with a .7 ratio came in third. There are several disturbing implications of the new beauty research. The research suggests that we are designed to care about looks. Looks are not earned and reveal nothing about a person's character. We are judged on fea- tures whic.h bare no relationship to merit. Also implied is that sexual ste- reotypes are not entirely artificial. There is some degree of instinct which makes women favor domi- nant males over meek ones, and makes men favor youthful char- acteristics in women Perhaps these tendencies once had bio- logical justification, but that doesn't make them any less dis- concerting in modern society. Fortunately human action is mo- tivated by more then beauty and visceral impulse This article is based on \The Biology ofBeauty\ from the June 3, 1996 issue of Newsweek.

OP/ED . ·. ·. . · · · . lfri~c <!Innrnt.Otensis • October 10', 1996 · Page 6 ED·ITORil\L Priorities: The Schaffer Library Fiasco Unicn is continually advertising its commitment to the future and to the developl'nent of a rigorous and competitive curriculum. They have had some success at creating a demanding course load and ex:cellent teaching, but what resources are there for students . to use when attempting the research of higher learning? It is a pathetic commentary when senior thesis research is more like a term abroad to the SUNY library. Union has an adequate updated I ibrary in the works, but most juniors and seniors will be unlik~ly to benefit from the improvements. What plans does the school have to improve its research capabilities and aid its stu- dents with up-to-<iate and thorougn research? For example, the inter-library loan is a great place to end, but certainly not to begin. Brainstorming on ILL is an impossibility: if students are looking for material to help finalize a research topic, or iftl1ey need a book quickly, the ILL can takt~ a minimum often d~s. There is no way to rush the loan through the system be- cause lLL has no special priorities. While the opti.mistic student is waiting for the ILL books to arrive, an attempt to research the reference section has become increasingly more difficult. Over half of the reference section has · been moved into storage. The undeniable logic of the library fails when it would make more sense to move the books that haven't been clusted in years first, rather than targeting the frequently used reference materials. The question on everyone's mind is why ground work for a certain other, brand-new building (which will remain nameless) has been started; and the libr~ry has been forgotten? Last spring wewe:retold work would begin on the librai-y over this past sum- mer. Then, upon returning to school, we were told that ground breaking might oegin in the spring. Does anybody remember how fast the Nott was renovated? Practically overnight in comparison to the early stages of the library. This is an obvious injustice to students who pay over $27·,000 and expect access to research materials, nota pretty, sixteen-sided study room. The books have been moved, the plans drawrt, but there is the old library, covered with the dust of a new building which Is only in the creation stage. '(fiq.e <Tinncnrfti.ensis Tltt!

'(OG-ff IN AGAJ~ l'-' Thurber Lambasted To the Editor, Just this past week, I took a per- sonality te~t that told me that some- times I am inclined to speak be- . fore I think. I consider this a fault of mine, and it is something on which I am working. In reading Rawson Thurber's articles for the past two weeks,. l think this is a clear case of someone who writes but does not thiok .. ldo not mean t6,;risidtl'vk: th~rs int~lligence, because I am ·sure he is suitably bright, and to his credit I think his creative writing is of top quality. However, the content of Mr. Thurber's last two articles (\The Bases: Rules and Definitions for Collegiate Players,\ 9/26 and \Stu- dents of the Week,\ 10/3) have been at best of questionable appro- priateness for a student newspaper and border on bad taste. I would like to point out a few examples to illustrate my point. Two weeks ago in Mr. Thurbers article on redefining the so-called \bases\ of\ hooking up,U he made a point to say that it is okay to steal first, second. and third base, but that it is never okay to steal home, Planet C Clarification To the Brothers of Chi Psi: It has come to my attention that the members of your fra· temity didn't appreciate the ar· tide I wrote two weeks ago. I imagine this is because it was thought that I was singling <lut your fraternity for criticism .. Though I meant what I said · about \Doids\ deserving more respect, and though an incident at your fraternity was my inspi- . ration and example,' I didn't in- tend to _disrespect your organi- · zation. My intended .point was that we, as a student body ,should give Schenectady resi- dents more of a chance-some may disagree about how much My point however was not to attack any particular greek or- . ganization. I apoligize for any misinter- pretations. Sincerely, Conor McKenzie . because that would send you to jaiL I took this analogy to mean that stealing home wotild constitute rape. Well, Mr. Thurber is correc~ it is never okay to steal home~ [ would like to point out, however, that it is not okay to steal :first, sec- ond, or third base either. While incidents of rape on this campus are limited, sexual assault is a fairly common <>ccurrence. To define ·sexual assault· for.you, Mr. Thurber, in words that you created, it is to steal first, second, or third base. Anytime an individual is co- erced, pressured, or fQrced into any sexual act that they do not desire, then this constitutes sexual assault. It is a crime that often goes unre- . ported and unpunished, and it leaves the individual helpless. I assume that this is something that you did not take into consideration when you were writing the article. I do hope however that it is some- thing you consider when you are engaged in a sexual encounter. My seco\hd point l>f issue with you, Mr. Thurber, is your \Student of the Week\ article from last weeks Concordiens.is. I was not too fond of your top ten list on 11 Why Union is Better than Hooter's,\ but I digress. As the Resident Assistant on the second floor of Davidson South, I have a particular problem with your fea- turing my residents in your article. Perhaps you were not aware that your words could cause a problem for the women whose party you attended, or for myself, as their ' Resident Assistant. Having this function reported in the paper re- flects poorly on all the people in- volved. Additionally, because the incidence took place in a residence tJall~ there are consequences in- volved. My hope for you, Mr. Thurber, is that you try to remember that your articles are printed in our school newspaper, and that a bit of decency would be appreciated. While I am not an advocate of cen- sorship, I simply hope that you would want to reform the topics of your articles, so that other people <1n campus will not have to pay for them.

With results on Sunday afternoon of tile USA Today /CNN I GaU()p poll giving Clinton an 18peFcentage point lead over Dole , the debate became of critical importance to Dole.

Welfare, of ccurse, was created at a time when Americans were severely impoverished by the Great Depression anti had no otller place to turn. These days most Ameri- cans will agree that welfare is Dllt of controL Not only is the system being abused, but it is becoming an increasingly subs1antial financial burden as th-e national debt increases and the budget seems to be nowhere near being bal- anced. The Republican House of Representatives with their \Contract with America\ hawe been leading the cru- sade forwelfarereform. Re- putL icans strongly believe thllt the federal welfare sys- tem.llas grown too large to be efficient. They see a welfare system that is wasteful and th11tallows too many Ameri- cans to take advantage of and abuse its aid. Acc()rding to con- servatives, the fact that welfare is being taken advatttage of is de- stroyingtheworketbic in America. This is tl1eir big~est argument against welfare- that there is a wei fare class penna11ently addicted to welfare, and that this class is, in reality, being hurt rnore than it is bei11g helped. Tiley want to see pe{)ple getting thentselves offwel- fareand onto jobs. While the Democrats recognize welfare's need ofrefonn, their phi- losophy is based on looking out for th~ less priviledged in our country, mainly innocent ch.ildren who, of C()Luse, cannot help the fact that their parents cann()t sufficiently support tllem. They place the wel- fare system abovetbe cost of what it takes to ensure all the checks in the mail- no matter what the cost may be. It is the responsibility of the Federal government, according to liberals, to take care of its citi- zefls, a.nd not doing so would be d-etrimental to the brightness of the country's future. In 19'14 when the GOP became the majority party ill the House, Bill Clinton and the Dem'Octats had to face heavy pressure from the GOP for welfare reform. What resulted was the ~'Personal Responsibility theme highlighting his plansfor the future of the country. Fol- lowing an attack by Dole on Clinton's ideas for Medicare, Clinton simply responded with, \I think my i~.e~s are l:t~tter,fg~ the future.\ Dole-;on the•othet· hand. was quick to tell the viewing public that he thinks the country is in no better po- With four weeks until Elec- tion Day, Dole and Clinton are still battling to communicate their messages to the Ameri- can people.

The Debate Over Welfare Continues and Work Opportunity Recon- ciliation Act of 1996\ (HR 3734 - PL 104-193), a bill which President Clinton signed into law on August 22. This \Welfare Overhaul Law\ as it has been called, has two major aspects: Recipients must work within two years of receiving benefits, and they can only re- ceive five years of aid. Also significant about the new leg- islation is the broad authority that it gives to states over their own welfare programs. Guar- anteed federal checks will be guaranteed no longer, and in- stead states will, to an extent, create their own welfare pro- grams. Other laws that the legisla- tion establishes include deny- ing welfare benefits to indi- viduals convicted of a felony offense for possessing, using or distributing illegal drugs (states will make their own choices as to whether or not those penal- ized for drug abuse are eligible for emergency benefits such as emergency medical services). Also, unwed teenage parents (under age 18)will only qualify for state aid if they are attend- ing high school or involved in an alternative educational or training program and live with a parent or guardian. States can decide whether or not to deny wei fare to children born towel- fare recipients and whether or not give any at all to unwed par- entsunder age 18. The bill out- 1 inesthe refonn and gives states the authority to refonn it even more .. There are still, perhaps, a few glitches in the new system. What will stop welfare recipi- ents from moving to another state once they have used up their two years of welfare sup- port and won'tgetajob? Crit- ics say that some sort of a na- tionwide data bank would have to be fonned to keep track of who has already received their share of support, and it is not certain as to whether or not this can get und~rway b€fore the legislation goes into action. The results of the election will determine where welfare reform goes from here. IfDole is elected and the Republicans keep the majority, the move- ment will continue to move for- ward. If Clinton is reelected, or if the Democrats take back the House, substantial changes to the new laws will be made to slow down the process of wean- ing people off of welfare. \

.. Election Watch _ _ · . - _ Wl1_c Qlom:or.Ohmsis October. I(}, 1996 Page 9 .. Political Opinions Bob Dole Has a Web Page! Bill Clinton: Playing the Game by Karen Watts WorldNews EditoT Having watched the presiden~ tial debates this past Sunday-, it was obvious that the perso11 to watch was undoubtedly Bob Dole. That is of course h<Jw h.erwould communicate his mes- sage to the pl)blic. Of C()urse, among those that watch~d the debate, there seemed to lmve been two very differe:nt re- sponses to his rhetoric, or bet- ter yet his incahere:nt ram!).ling. Tllere were those that th()u,ght that maybe this guy is b11man after all, with his attem~ts at being humorous. In short,. this guy m,ay llOt be so bad. 'Then there is the other side th<lt:basi- cally felt embarrassed for Dole. How could he have pOS':~illly said what he did on natianal television? Well, if it is not already obvious, m,y res\)'Ollse is with the latter. It often amazes me at the= ~ay Dole's campaign advisorsallow him to be portrayed. Instead of downplaying his political faults, they chose to ac:centu- ate them instead. Sunda_y's debate was actually quite llu- morous, but instead of having people laugh with Dole they were laughing at him. Hon- estly., if you were running for President of the United States and the moderator of a debate asked you to finish your last sentence,(obviously the mod- erator .could not even follow his response to know that \food was the end of his sentence} would you simply look at the camera and reply, \ . . ·. c d?\ p b bl ummm .... 100 . ro a· y not. It would have ·sufficed for Senator Bob Dole to say that indeed he had finished his state- ment. Not only was Dole slow at responding to the questions asked, he really did not ever answer the questions. It made you want to hold up a sign that would jog his memory about the original question. Something along the lines of, \ ... And back to the issue of Cuba.\ It was actually quite a chore to try and follow where he was going with his responses. That is of course not to imply that President Clinton did not jump around, but at least he· presented the information in a co- he rent manner. And then there were the per- sonal attacks intended to hurt the PFesident. In reality. it had no real damaging' effect on Clinton, rather it only made Dole reveal his own character. Such attacks were made at how Clinton addressed Bush in the presidential debates of 1992. Who cares? Who even remem- bers that? Dole a]s() attacked President Clinton's drug history only to have the crime record turned against him. My ques- tion is who tells him oo say these things or does he say them of his own volition. Finally, we must not leave outBobDole's two minute clos- ing statement. The statement that Dole's response paled in comparison to Clinton's vision of America crossiflg the bridge into the twenty-first century, is being way too generous. In two minutes of free speech, Bob Dole could think of nothing more concrete to say tllan, \just don't do it,\ in reference to drugs. Of course the best part was when he told the Ameri- can public to chec:k out his home page. In case you were not aware Bob Dole~ everyone has a home page. 20% Off D a CJ D . An..y one,.

Starting pay $6.50 I 5@ I us Please contact: Schenectady Job Service 600 Franklin Street Schenectady, NY 12305 by Patrick Foley Contributing Writer Does the manner by which Bill Clinton conducts his personal life affect his role of President of the United States? The an- swer to that question, in the strictest sense, is \no\. However, we must ask a more important question: How has the media coverage of Clinton's continuous scandals influenced our per- ception ef the president and politics in general? When I have discussed the issue ef Clinton's morals with friends, the standard response is as follows, \Who cares ... what Bill Clinton does after-hours. has nothing to do with his capa- bility to run the nation effectively.\ This would appear to be the case as the economy has picked tip nicely since he has come to office, yet it would be naive to assume that any presi- dent could make such a quick impact on the strength of the economy. During this time, however, Clinton has been unde- niably successful at selling himself as a presidential-looking president. The question I then ask is this: \Since you are more interested in policy-mak~ng and issues than about the daily babblings of the tabloids, what specific views do you share with the president?;' On a good day, saving Medicare is tossed out as a possibility. Yet preserving something which is in the best interest of a large number of voters is hardly a conviction, so for me the question remains. It is generally agreed that . what we hear through the media is not about issues, but about the game of politics: winners and losers. Clinton can play the game well, so he is a winner. Although he has spent four years batter-dipped and fried in a tar pit of controversy, it seems to be okay with most of us. We say we vote on the issues, but most of us are uninformed. So what are we voting on? Why do we like Bill Clinton? I think the reason may be simple. Just one or two skeletons in a closet is a bad thing, but once you get an entire army of skel- etons, they may actually march in your favor. Certainly, popu- larity doesn't always go up as a direct result of corruption . .ff:o~.wrveJ;, I Qo ,f~yl tl)at in Clinton's case, the media has ex- hausted its power to the point where they have no more cred- ibility. The President is likable enough that the average citizen will passively defend him before going along with the media circus. When it's one thing after another, and the \victim\ is well-trained at flirting with the camera, the real loser is the media. Our senses are dulled by the over-load of scandals, we lose interest and begin to close our eyes. Our anger is si- phoned away and we are left apathetic and cynical. It is now much easier to hate the press and their political scandals than the President of the United States. This is where Bill Clinton stands right now. The media has played themselves out of the game and into oblivion, and we are left with a guy we like, but we don't know why. Basically, politics is about a bunch of buffoons and we are only fit to pick the cutest one. The bad news for Clinton is that such a sce- nario seems highly unstable. That protruding-jaw stare at Hillary during the State of the Union address was nice at the time, but it was almost like watching your little brother ham it up in the school play. It's cute, but almost painful as you look to see if everyone else is really buying this. While it's a credit to him to have come as far as he has, I don't know how long it will be until a lot of people get tired of it. Maybe Clinton can avoid it for a while, but this second honeymoon may come crashing down as fast as his first one. The good news, on the other hand, is that he only has to last until November, b11t will we . still like him once he doesn't need us anymore?

Apparently these pressures are quit~ great, as they have resorted to harassing small fuzzy mammals in order to vent their frustrations. Though they haven't actually begun beating them as the head! ine suggests (however, I thought it was quite catchy) they have been hassling a guinea pig named 'Gysco' enough to warrant a restraining order. The guinea pig's friend and administrator is Doug Tanner. Doug chooses not to refer to him- self as the pig's \owner as he can't stand the thought of degrad- ing his friend in such a way. It was initially hard for me to re- late to Doug's seemingly unprec- edented attachment to his pig. So, !asked him why he didn'tjust leave his pig at home, and with his shocked response I began to learn what a close bond Doug has with his pig. \I couldn't leave him at home ... he has to be properly cared for. lfs also a matter of personal pride and honor. When I asked my parents ifi could buy the pet, they made me promise that I would always take full re- sponsibillty for my pet.\ Doug resides in The Society (which holds a coffee house ev- ery Tuesday at &), and because of the space constraints in his cramped double, Doug put his pig's habitat in a corner of his house's upstairs lounge. All resi- dents were satisfied with the ar- rangement, and Doug cleaned the cage regularly to prevent offen- sive odors. \I must say I was a little sur- prised when I received my first phone call from Associate Dean Williams regarding the pig. My initial reaction was anger-1 wanted to find the rat!\ Sunday Morning Shampoo Fest by Jeff Druzba Staff Writer So~ l decided to take a shower the other day, as I do every day, when I realized something. I ran my ha.ir under the water, flipped open the cap to the shampoo, and tha{s when it hit me. On the shampoo bottle were several key phrases that just jumped out at me, such as \Protei!l Complex,\ \B-Vitamin' and \AJ'pha Hy- . . droxy:\ Wllat~s going on\heie? ' Think about it. Somewhere in this country, there are people who sit and de- cide what it is that will make people buy their product. There's nothing wrong with that, I guess, but do they think I'mstupid? Wait a minute! I guess I am. It took me until just recently to figure it all out. These are key phrases that they think people want to hear abouttheirparticularproduct. For some reason, people buy more shampoo if it's \complex\ or filled with a bunch of other chemicals. The more chemicals there are, the more clean your hair will be. Why do they need to lie like that? Why can't they just write: \Cleans Your Hair Real Good\ and \Smells Fruity\ in- stead of making up terms for things people don't have a clue about in the first place? Then,_ you roll the bottle over and look at the ingredients. I have to admit that when I was a lot younger, I took the challenge. Maybe some of you know what I'm talking about. What is that word and how do you say it: methylchloroisothiazol inone? I've never forgotten how to spell or pronounce it, because I would sit in the bathtub a few extra min- utes when I was little to learn it. I needed to learn that word. School- mates were not impressed. In fact, fourth grade is when we learned something even better: antidisestablishmentarianism. That's one hell of a ~ord, too: it puts any shampoo chemical to shame. A funny thing about shampoo is that it's importance can turn up anywhere. I remember the scent of a certain brand of shampoo I used when l was young and we used to spend a week or two on the N.~~}ersey sh,c?rrJJil. ~~~---s~l!l­ l')1eJ1i,rpe~ .. Jh~, sm.~~~~ ,qf,,Prfr~'in peopleJs halt can determme whether or not they are a'tt!active to the opposite sex. The smell of one's shampoo can even be a test of o-ne's manhood. '\Hey Johnny ... is that you who smells like Strawberry Shortcake?\ Who made up that word any- way? Shampoo? Is that from any Latin or Greek derivative? What language is that? Of course, when you finish with the shampoo, it's time for the conditioner. The same things ap- ply here and more. Why is sham- poo drippy and gooey while con~ ditioneris ploppy? Shampoo kind of pours out of the bottle while conditioner needs a squeeze. Why do I, without fail, no matter how many years I've been trying to stop myself, always squirt too much conditioner in my hand? Have you ever tried sucking shampoo or conditioner back into the bottle? It's pretty difficu1t to say the least You collapse the air out of the bottle and then put the opening near your ~xce~sive puddle of shampoo, and the air pressure sucks it back in. At least that's the technique in theory. It never really works, though, and you end up slopping around too much shampoo or conditioner in your hair while it takes twice as long as normal to wash out. Conditioners have two key words I ike the phrases on sham- ,poo. potties: ''Moisturizing\ and · \Emollients\. Man, they really mqst think we're stupid. What's with that scale on sham- poo and conditioners? Three cat- egories: Oily, Nonnal, and Dry. Who made that one up? Is there really a difference in the product ·between categories or is it the producer's way of making people feel like the company cares about them? Ifyouwereashampoo and co~9it\~n~r!1?ttlwrl'xy.~yldn 'tit by to ~o4r advantage to add just t~ . \'c -~)~\ \~·1r-j,'\1 t)~T~)~-·qs.;~ ,r htt e somethmg to mal<e people s hair oily In the \dry\ formula and something to make their hair dry in the \oily\ mixture? That way, people's hair is bouncing between categories for years before they realize that it's the shampoo they're using that's the problem. Of course, combining sham- poo and conditioner into one is a huge marketing strategy. People like convenience in their hair care. I can't believe these products are actually two products in one. First of alI, one would expect these combo deals to be just a little more ploppier in consiste11cy, and sec- ond, ifyou were a company mar- keting this, wouldn't you just not add conditioner an<l say it had conditioner? After the hair is done, what is left to discuss but the soap? Could someone tell ttle the purpose of that marbled finish on some brands? And how many different kinds of contours in our soap do we need? I've seen a lot of soap in my day and I've seen a differ- ent shape on every one of them. Curved, tapered, round, rectangul-ar ... it all ends up as a flat oval in a week anyway. Strange things happen in that shower we're so familiar with. Stop playing with the nozzle and do the reading ... you' Jl see for yourself. We need Sprouts ... to write curved, tapered, or rounded Features Articles! Call x615 5 for more details \When I calmed down, I as- sumed that the Dean was a ratio- nal person, and we woulcl be able to talk this out,'' recalled Tanner, Apparently not. \I received another voice mes- sage from Dean Williams, and that is when 1 learned how vin- dictive she is with small fuzzy mammals.\ The following is a direct trah· script from Williams' voice mes- sage to Tanner. \Doug this is getting really serious ... I\n gonna get campus safety up there and take it to the animal shelter.,.you need to .call me right back.\ The message started out inno- cently enough, recalled Tanner, «Youknow, 'HiDug·e-dug, this is Dean Williams, blah, blah blah' .. .I nearly dropped the pfuone when she mefltioned any- ane taking away my Gysco.\ At that point Dean Williams made her intentions towards small fuzzy mammals clear. She continued, \What is going \ \ on? .. 1 cause ·it sounds Hke you're not taking this'·seriously, so do you want to have someone go out and just tum it l?ose, so you need to getback to me .... bye ..

Administrator ofthe Week: Dean. S~hurick is the lucky winner of the second award, but unlike the above, her award is not given because she enjoys a'good time, but quite the opposite. With magnifying glass in hand, Dean Schurick deftly tracked down a supposed donn \party\ that oc- curred recently. Like any upstanding member of the Union Col- lege Community, Dean Schurick reads The Concordiensis the very day it comes out. However, last week she took matters into her ()Wn hands. With no hard evidence whatsoever (no Security re~ ports, no incident reports, no complaints or damage of any kind), Dean Schurick, in conjunction with an always helpful Residence Life program, was able to hassle an RA and various members of her floor for allegedly having a, gasp, party in two separate rooms. What clue did she. have t() go on? What small thread of evidence or strand of DNA did she use to squelch fun ()f any kind? Well, you need look n() further than yours truly. Apparently Dean Schurick read my .\Students of the Week\ section last week, the very same section that you are currently perusing, and found mention of~a weekend party. She wa:sted rio time ana. snapped into action by faxing a copy ()[my \article\ to Residence Life who in tum handled ·this heinous matter accordingly. What puzzles me, oh faithful reader, is the following: with no supporting evidence, how can anyone other than myself get in trouble for something that I have written? I might understand if there had been other repmts or complaints, but there were none. Only a simple paragraph written by a crass young man. So what occurs to me is the odd notion that I may indeed have unlimited power, for apparently I can cause anymie on this campus t() be called into the dean's office with only a few simple I ines of prose. Where am I going with this? Well, it seems very frightening to me that any()ne, let alone a powerful member of our administra- tion, would take seriously anything that r write. I mean for God's sake, this infamous paragraph was tucked under a \Top Ten\ list with the word \Hooters\ in the title. The fact that someone would take any of it seriously boggles the mind. Maybe Union should have higher ~tandards of intellect for certain positions on campus. I know I thank my personal god every day that the C()ncmdiensis doesn't. .

Calll-520-680-7891 EXTC200 Too Much Yoga, Not Enough Beer c:: by Pete ~orense11 · I had a dream about autumn leaves last night( not the jazz stan- dard). I ()nly vaguely remember · it, but I think 1 was walking ·on wooded paths under a canopy of orange and yellow and brown, drinking some hot, spiced, spiked cider fresh off the presses. Kate . Moss was working the presses. Now, this is strange for me. You ·, see, I never remember what l dream. Mostly my dreams get . stuffed in the inacessible vault of random thoughts, in this case ffied under \Cider\ {right next to . \Cheerios Com.mercials\ and \Caddyshack Movies\). Plus, I rarely dream about women. I don't know why. It's a bummer. So, I wonder, why was last night's sleepy adventure remem- bered? I must confess that all I'm going on here is a hunch; and once again, it all came together ()fl the damn fire-escape. Here is what l think happened: I woke up this morning with the intention of jetting down a p(}em that had come to me in ihe course ()f last evening. The poem is fairly strange, as was last evening. It goes something! ike this: Wandering through empty streets and se- renely un-dismal un- lighted blocks ... I perchance bumped · · inlodiidkn(;cketlflatdut · · a girl wearing mauve argyle socks ... She said \hello\ and I said \hey sorry 'bout that, could I buy you a beer over there tttyon frat?' 'You jest.' she re• plied. 'yon frat is a dive. l'fl not have their beer sloshing up my insides ... I paused, she was right. I needed a plan; something funky and suave ... / needed a scam. So I said. 'hey. I got it, there's no party in sight; how 'bout coming to my place tonight? · She cocked her head sideways and flashed a quirky grin. saying _ \blunt. I Wee that ... \ and {knew I was in ... Yaay me. I thought, whitest my insides tingled; and we headed to dutch to get Fro- Yo with sprinkles ... How we got home. l don't think I know: af- ter several cups of suds, my memory hit slow- mo ... But I had no urge to write right then; instead, I ·had a huge desire to drink somejuiceandstand out- side on the fire-escape to see what kind of a day was brewing. Which I did, in a fully ex- tended half-whisp (yoga position, very'stimulating). And as 1 stood there Igotthis feeling that some- thing wasn't quite right. It took several minut~s before my mouth began forming words such as, \Huh? and, \Where did ... ?,\ and eventually, \Hmm all the \ brightly-colored leaves are gone \ This, of course, was a bail-out and a bit non-sequential, because as you can imagine, I was thinking ab()ut my argyle-sock-wearing companion. Meanwhile, I simultaneously realized that I wasn't drinking hot cider, but a rather cold cup of can- teloupe juice~ and there were chocolate sprinkles between my toes. Dm1't ask where I got the juice~- Ms. Moss can work a mean blender. Anyway ... So basically, my. theory is this: because nothing was quite how I seemed to think it should be and I couldn't form coherent sen- tences, my sense <;>f perspective must have cmne fmm my dreams. That's pretty clever, right? After all, the autumn leaves are not quite falling in our faces ... yet. Yaaay, so what. It's reality- check time. Not only do I n()t get to go walkin' in the woods today, but fiiggin' security is heading my way to yell about the fire-escape do()r (again). To despair, or t() simply head tbr Jackson's? It may not be quite what I had in mind, but with a W()ol sweater ()n and mauve ar- gyle socks striding in step, the day sh()uld be quite nice indeed. As the plaque by the fountain says, \when the world wearies, and society ceases to satisfy, there is always the garden.\ Sure, . .l suppose so, why not? Now, if l could just get some work-study $$for gardening. Latinos Prepare for Historic March Join the Coordinadora in D. C. by Roberto Rodriguez Staff Writer On Oct()ber 12, ~'DRa de Ia Raza\ thousands of Latinos(- as) will participate in the first ever national Latino March and Rally i11 Washington, D.C. Coordinadora '96 has been organizing this event since 1994. This march comes in response to growing anti-immigrati<m policies in the United States .. including California's Propasition 187, · the federal 1996 im~igrati()n bill and, most recently, the clause in the Welfare Bill that denies government benefits t() legal immigrants. The Coordinad()ra '96 will present' seven crucial poi11ts with the objective of uniting forces throughout the United States. The seven demands ofthe dem- onstration are as follows: 1. Human and constitu- tional rights for all 2. Equal opportunities and affirmative action J. Free public education for all from kindergarten to the university level 4. Expansion of health ser- vices 5. Citizens' police review boards 6. L-abor law reform and a $7 per hour minimum wage 7. Extension of the eligibil- ity date for amnesty for immi- grants applying for citizenship. We do not want our C()mmu- nities to be ignored. \Ya Basta!\ (\That's Enough!\). Many Latino students here at Union strongly support the goals of this march. Coordinadma '96 is caiJing for self-determination for Latin()s, for all workers, and for immi- grants. These are principles that will help bring about a more just society.

(actuall~r~ at 7:30) ~ScREENING RooM by Larry Paska, Arts Editor ''That Thing You Do!\ Star- ring Tom Everett Scott, Steve Zahn. Charlize Theron, Jonathan Schaech. Liv Tyler, Tom Hanks. Directecf by Hanks. Rated PG. Twentieth-Century Fox Pictvres. Rating: *** (outoffour) Most movie stars who want to d irecttheir own film end up with either a grandiose flop or a big winner (witness Mel Gibson's Braveheart). Tom Hanks- who by now could run for President and win based on his likability- chose to make a small, nostalgic · drama for his first feature. This is a wisecareermove, because That Thing You Do/takes no risks and breaks no new ground in filmmak- ing, but it nevertheless ends up beingaiightand satisfying movie treat- much like eating lowfat frozen yogurt Of course, any success the film will have depends strictly on Hanks? popularity and box-office clout. (Honestly, would you see this movie if he didn't write, di- · rect, and star in it?) This is a shame, because Hanks plays a minor role, and if his name were not attachedto it, it would still be a fine and dandy movie .. The story loves div.ing into 1964 Americaas only Hollywood can preserve it for future genera- tions. Among a cast of relative unknowns, Scott plays Guy Patterson, a teen who works in his father's appliance store but as- c pires to become a percussionist. His big break comes when a few friends ask him to sub for their drum player at a concert, and when Guy speeds up the tempo on a song (\That Thing You Do!,\ of course), the crawd goes wild. The group decides to call them- selves The 011eders, but every- one thinks it's pronounced The O·needers,. sothename is smartly changed to The Wonders . .(lfs a real wonder no one figured that out sooner.) The band's leader, Jimmy (Schaech), his girlfriend (Tyler),andLenny (Zahn), a gui- tarist, are then promoted by a man- ager in a local nightclub. On the sudden rise to fame, the group is appreached by Mr. White (Hanks), the smooth operator be- hindtherising Play-Tone Records. Mr. White proceeds to put The Wonders on a state fair tour with other Play..:Tone \wonders\.; but amidst this touting entottrage of musicians, the teen sensation band shines like a star. There are two kim;is ofmovies: ones in which cliches and stereo- types work, and ones in which they don't. Happily, the contriv- ances in That Thing You Do! add to the charm Of the fantasy*'60's world Hanks has recreated. If you're going to paint that same old rosy picture of \gro\Ying up in the early '60's,\ then you might as well do it with a beach-p::1rty movie shoot. The Wonders get careeradvisementftom Mr. White and land a bit part in a Hawaiian musical comedy. (Look fast for one of That Thing's producers, veteran director Jonathan Demme, asthe movie's director). With the group dressed in tacky sailors' uniforms, one feels. a certain nos- talgia for Elvis movies. Staples of this type of fihn which are featured here include Theron(most recently seen in 2 Days in the Va/ley)asGuy'ssweet- heart who just can't get excited about her boyfriend's success; Guy's father, who thinks his son is chasing a foolish dream and should be working at home in- l..®cal Arts Calendar g. \ .

SUNDAY, OCTOBER 13 North America's premier medieval music ensemble, Altr1unar, will kick off a new and unique series at 7:30PM at the Troy Savings Bank Music Hall. The ensemble's name has its origins in the language of the tr<Jubadours. The name was given to the Near Eastern lands that lay \over the sea,\ where the crusade and trade effected the rich cultural exchange between East and West. Performing on a matched set of instruments fashioned especially. for them, Altramar combines ancient vocal works with instru- ments appropriate to the times and places of the music they perform. Blending song and story, drama and rhetoric, voices and instruments, Altramar transports the vi- brant tapestry of medieval culture into the present day. Altramar' s not-to-be-missed program entitled \Iberian Garden\ is a celebration of the extraordinary musical, literary, and spiritual diversity that . yielded the richly cosmopolitan world of medieval Jewish, Christian, and Muslim Spain.

WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 16 S.ix:ty members strong, the Tibetan Song a11d Dance Ensemble enraptures its audiences with its mystical and beautiful interpretations oftraditi()nal Tibetan music, dance, and theatre. The Ensemble, on its first U.S. tour, visits Proctor's Theatre at'8:00 PM. Originating in the ancient city of Lhasa, Tibet, the Tibetan Song and Dance Ensemble presents the · three major styles of traditional Tibetan music, dance, and theatre. Folk style, traditional palace style, and temple style are all representeo in the Ensemble's first American tour. The Ensemble performs traditional folk dances, the traditional palace music known as Kalu, the famous and mysterious deep chants. and the other-worldly tones of the long trumpets. Skilled Tibetan artisans have created the elabtlrate and colorful masks, costumes, and instruments, ensuring the authenticity of the perfor- mances. Tickets for the Tibetan Song and Dance Ensemble are $28.50, $26.50 and $24.50. Tickets for children 12 and under are $15.50. Tickets are available at Proctor's Th\'..atre ( 518) 346-6204 and at all TicketMaster locations. . stead; ·and, Schaech~ th€ band's temperamental leader who ruins the band and his h:mg-lasting re- lationship with Faye (Tyler) by being stubborn. None of these characters register any sort of depth with audiences; they are, in fact, drawn about well as stick figures, yet it doesn't matter. Hanks knows you've seen these characters all before, s0 h.e invites you to take another trip back to the age when pop cultt,~re was being defined. Fortunately, the song which makes the group into a «one-hit wonder\ is catchy and cheerful. Somehow, even after hearing it performed over ten times through- out the film, it never loses its charm. In th·is sense, it's a great tune, because. such hits in the 1960's were continuously big, even after repeated airplay. That Thing You Do! is the movie you should see, because it takes no chances, keeps a constant tone, and avoids the routinely tragic ending so prevalent in rock group biopics, whether reat' tlr imagined. It is preservative-free; and if you have trouble remem- bering all those young and unrec• ognizable faces in the movie, com- pare these actors to your favorite stars.

For those who .have seen it, you may recall the mo- ment in the film where Seagal gets sucked out of the airplane, after spending the first thirty mjnutes of the film sitting in a . conference room in military fa- tigues doing absolutely noth- ing. Audiences applauded this moment when Seagal met his fate, a turning point in his ca- reer, especially considering that he could have easily handled the role given to Kurt Russell in the movie. He may wish that he stayed dead after The Glimmer Man. Simply anotherpieceoftough meat cooked on the action for- mula grill, The Glimmer Man fades into nothingness rather quickly, despite a premise that suggests another Seven, but with an older Brad Pitt and a · younger Morgan Freeman. Seagal plays a Buddhist cop wlw is paired with hard-nosed Wayans (yawn!) to solve a se- ries of killings in which the vic- tims are «crucified\ on the wall. That's no slap-happy premise, yet the duo tries to work in comic dialogue whenever they can. When one of the victims is discovered to be Seagal's ex- wife, he knows someone is oil to him and is trying to set him up. Wayans, who learns that Seagal has a shady past, tries to un- cover the mysteries surrounding his partner. By the end of the movie, though, we still don't know a lot about him. (Wait, it's Steven Seagal. we're talking about here! There isn't anything to know!) If loud chases and pointless explosions are your thing, then even this movie will fail to sat- isfy, due to a certain credibility problem. No one can suspend their disbelief when the follow- ing twists occur: Wayans' apart- ment explodes while he is ill it, and the cop is hurled three sto- ries onto the roof of a car, and he survives without a scratch; Seagal kicks the back window out ofthe overturned car he is in and glides out of it without a scratch; Seagal never gets bruised in a fight (even when he is knocked down), and the one time he is struck, his entire face is a bloody mess; Seagal refuses to engage in one-to-one combat because of his religious beliefs, yet it's okay for him to shoot people dead at random. If you really want to take another trip into \Tough Attitude Cop- Land,\ then go right ahead. The film 'sone saving grace is the opening title sequence, which is particularly well-shot, with a techno-driven score to pump up the adrenaline and give feel to the unfolding murder scene. Unfortunately, that's as stylish as this factory-product gets.

Robert Neffson .fist & 5th Ave. of the masters of butoh, Kazuo Ohno, with whom she worked, be- came her mentor. She was very intrigued by his immortality and endurance at age 91 . Mouti11et is fascinated with dance in other cultures and hopes to share this interest with her stu- dents:. A.m6ng her-plans tor her course are building a collection of dance videos and books about dance around the world. She be- l ieves her switch from classical to modern dance is an example to students of the many possibilities in dance. \It is very rare that you meet a dancer that was first a classical dancer, then a modern dancer. Usually classical qancers stay in classical dance,\ said Professor Moutillet. She is excited about the current changes going on in dance and believes that modern dance was revolutionized in the 1980's, when it was again considered an inter- disciplinary art. What is most fas- cinating is that women started modem dance. It was something that started from women who wanted to get out ofthe Victorian corset and explore their lives and freedom. Moutillet said that she has ful- filled her need for perfonning, and when asked if she has any desire to perform again, she said, \I re· ally did everything I wanted to do, and I loved every second of it, I lived it to the fullest. Noyv, I want to give what I know, whati learned from many years of dane in g.\ Moutillet says she has always loved teaching . She always taught, and even when she was on tour, slle gave workshops and master classes. She has also taught at Concordia University in Montreal, teaching movement for all different disc~plines and to stu- dents such as ar:chitects, design- ers, and choreographers who needed to learn about \lines.\ Her work has been anything but boring. She describes her life as fulfilling and always interesting, having one thing bring her to an- other, creating many opportuni- ties. She wants to bring these components ofher I ife to the class- room. She plans on teaching with videos and I ive perfonnances and by giving the opportunity to ex- perience how important choreog- raphers worked. Moutill et current! y teacres two dance technique classes, one for beg1m1ersand an advanced class open to anyone in the Unioncom- munity who is interested. She is also choreographing a piece for Parents' Weekend with Union students. Moutillet believes that it is very .important to know what is hap- pening now in dance and to see its innovators. Her course is for anyone who wants to experience something different and anyone who is willing. She is confident that her background in classical dance and her mod€rn experience will bring a-different component to dance at Union.

Rugby Suffers Loss at Binghamton by PikeMody Staff Writer The Union College Men's Rugby team, which has suffered from injuries all season, lost to Binghamton, the number one team in the league, by a score of 13-3. Unio11 dominated the first half of play, hut was unable to capitalize on any of its scoring opportuni- ties, which a.llowed Binghamton to remain in the game. Hooker Eric \Squanto the Destroyer\ Smith lead the forwards to successful serums, which enabled Union to drive deep within Binghamton ter- ritory_ Unfortunately, penalties and dropped balls resulted in Union being unable to convert any of its drives into swres. On defense, Union managed to stop Binghamton from its usual pro- ductiotl of tries by keeping their faster forwards out of rucks and mauls as roaming tacklers helping support the line. Union's closest attempt for a ~core came after driv- ing deep into Binghamton terri- tory. Brian \Battle Moose\ Field booted a kick down to the Binghamton fullback. He carried the kick into the try-zone and touched it down which resulted in a five-meter serum for the D1:1tchmen. After Smith called for a ''flying squirrel.\ which involves the serum bullying the opposition backwards into their try-zone, Union pushed Binghamton down to the two meter tine. It was then that Eric \I thought you said G- ball\ Menard picked up the ball and barreled toward the try-line. He was met by three Binghamton defenders and flipped the pass out to Jamie \The Minister of De- fense\ Leahey. Leahey caught the pass and drove in for an ap- parent Union try, until a seedy looking touch judge gave a very belated, out-of- boundscall. This resulted in Union turning the ball overto Binghamton, whowasable to push their way Ollt oftheir end of the field. Moments later, Union suffered its ,firstmajor injury of the game. Chris ''The Slender\ Weiler, Union's largest prop~ strained the ligaments in his knee in the bot- tom of a pil~-up. He fought through the injury until he was forced to leave the game at the half. The 7:00am Saturday mom- ingdeparture had left Union with no substitutes for prop, so they called on wing forward Pike \This is gonna hurt in the morning\ Mody to step up to the ta_sk of propping. This move resulted in Leahey moving up towing For- wardand Dave\G.E ~oming in to play wing. Union found t:hat the combination of Mody being both banged up and inexperienced at this position greatly hindered their ability to dominate serums. To add to their woes, Menard soon suffered a six- teen stitch tear to his ear, There- sult was the return ofthe injured Freddy G, who filled in at center for rookie starter, Matt Scheller. Wing forward Jon Kaufman slid to Eight-man to cover for Menard, and Scheller, who had never played a single play with the pack, slid into the vacant wing forward position. With the completely jostled-up serum, Union's suffer- ing continued. This caused more problems for Union's young line bebat~se the pack's inGonslstenoy · in the serum downs led to an in- ability of the line to stay settled enough to run plays effectively. Union found itselfbeing pushed backwards for the firsttime in the game. With the line and the pack both struggling, Binghamton's offense received a breath of life. They eventually pushed into Union's territory arid battled the Dutch- men in two goal line st:f).nds which Union fought for a combined to-. tal of fifteen minutes. They even- tually broke and Binghamton jumped to a W-0 lead. After an off-sides penalty, Binghamton once again ·capitalized on a kick and ended their scoring at I 3. Union r:efused to give up and drove its way back into Binghamton'sterritoryand scored a penalty kick of its own. On the ensuing kickoff, with only four minutes left in the game, the · Dutchmen found that deep deter- . mination that led thf\m to a state title last spring. They exploded all over Binghamton, with crush- ing tackles, good running, and great support. ·Unfortunately, it was too late.

Men's Soccer Falls to the Engineers by Josh Adams Staff Writer The Union College men's soc- cer team continued its season this past week with losses to both na- tionally ranked Williams College andcross-townrival RPI. Williams is the defending Division III Na- tional Champion, and RPI is the 16th ranked team in the country. The Dutchmen played excellently against the Purple Cows of Will- iams but came away with a 3-1 loss. The team continued to play well beh-ind the veteran-like per- forman~offreshmen goaltender JeffTh(}mas. The final scores of the two games are deceiving; in both contests the Dutchmen de- fense eased up in the late goings, allowing for easy goals. Coach Aldo Nardiello thinks that his team can play with the best in the c<Juntry, and earlier contests this season have proven him right. Twice earlier this season Union fought against deficits to win the games. \We d:idn'tplay up to our abili- ties.\ Coach Nardiello said. \We got welded into the fact that they are nationally ranked. We are good enough to pl<>.y with RPI.\ The Dutchmen fell behind early 1-0. and played the rest of the game trying to catch up to their opponen1s. Union tied the game RPJ player muscles l1fs way to t/1e ball (p/10to by Brooke Kaminsky lTC) at one apiece with 16:04-left to play in the game.

RPI, however, showed why they are the I 6th ranked team in the country, and pulled away with 3 _goals in the last 15m inutesofthe game. The last RPI goal was scored with little time left in the contest. \When RPI went up 2-1, we played more of a high risk game,\ Coach Nardiello said. \We took gambles that we needed to take to win the game.

SettliJ-lg tl1e Score - ---- --- :- What a Dlfference a Year Makes byCh11is Leone Sports Editor A year a go this w~ek the New York Yan'kees were playing .golf and wondering howthey blew a2 game series lead·to the Seattle Mariners. Yankee fans were criti- cizing the front office for spend- ing a l6t ofmoney and then pro- ducing a mediocre product that could not beat teams from the west. If things were not bad enough; their talented manager Buck Showalter J·eft the organiza- tion to become the manager of a team, the Arizona Diamondbacks, which is scheduled to play its first game in 1998. The prospects for this year team were highly ques-. tionable at best. The 1996 version ofthe Yan- kees took the field and would have to play through some very tough situations. Injuries to start- ing pitchers like David Cone and Jimmy Key would leave the start- ing rotation as a patchwork group. The1995starting shortstop Tony Sene~as Tuscaroras Tonawandas Femandezwould break his ann in the preseason, and the starting second bast;:)man,-PatKelly, would spend most ofthe year doing re- hab. 1fthese problems ~ere not enough, free agent outfielder Tim Raines tore both his hamstrings and would spend up until the end of August on the disabled list..

The second half began with a sustained Dutchmen attack star- ringJustinBourque. AfterMark · Serio's 42-yard kickoff return to the Roche.ster 49-yard I ine, Bourque reeled off another 15 yards on the .left side.

Union's nextposses- sion belonged to Jason Noker. Noker caught a 1 5-yard pass to keep the drive alive, and four plays later, McKeown lateraled the ball to fonner quarterback Ryan Smith who threw the ball deep to Noker. Noker broke a shoestring tackle and scored a 57-yard touchdown. After a missed extra point, the score rose to 26-0. The score got uglier for Roch- ester when Union backup quar- terback Todd Ellis came in during the fourth quarter. After a failed Dutchmen drive, punter Judson Zachar pinned his opponents at the one-yard I ine for the third straight week Rochester's punter shanked his punt, and Union took over at the Rochester 34. Ellis passed the ball deep into the endzone to Marc Heller for both men's first touchdown of the sea- son. Another Roger Egbert 29\' yard field goal rose the score to 36-0. This was not the final, how• ever, as third-string quarterback Ryan Caputo handed the ball off to sophomore running back Barry Eisenberg with 30 seconds re- maining, and Eisenberg took the ball43 yards to the one-yard I ine. Coach Audino allowed Eisenberg to finish what he started as Caputo gave the ball back to him for Eisenberg's first touchdown of . the season. This gave the Dutch- men their biggest win of the sea- son, 43-0, and moved them to 12th in the Divsion III poll. Team Effort Wins Game Give equal credit this week to even if they were to hang on and win the division, which th~y d!id, thisteam was going to go no place if they had to face either Seattle or the Texas Rangers in the first round.

A Look Ahead Let the games begin. The Divli- championship, are expected to bring the Calder Cup back to the Capital District. Anchored by long time NHL veteran Petr Sidorkiwicz in goal, this team looked very promising in a 6-2 win. The Rats bring a strong mix of talent, youth and toughness to the ice and play an exciting brand of hockey.

The NFL picks for last week went 2-1, this week I am taking another three games: the Giants, Chicago, and Green Bay. If anyone happened to catch the Roy Jones Jr. fight last week, they will understand when I say that he is a bad man. The most beautiful sight of the past week had to be Wayne Gretzky playing with Mark Messier. Who says that legends don't live forever? Neil Smith cer- tainly believes that they do. sion Ill Regional Poll, which ulti- mately determines who goes to the playoffs, is due out for the first time next Monday, and the meat of Union's schedule is yet to come. Next up tor the Dutchmen are Albany, RPI, Coast Guard, AI fred, and Carnegie Mellon. In the words of Justin Bourque, 'These are definitely different teams. We obviously have to tum it up a notch. It's a much bigger game now. It's 4-0, and it's on the line.'' The Albany Great Danes have rolled over to a 4-0 record of their own, already defeating RPI 17-7 and narrowly defeating St. Lawrence 14-8. They have al- lowed no passing touchdowns and only 259 yards per game. Al- bany quart~rback Joe Savino is the best Union has faced this sea- son with 460 yards, three touch- downs, and three interceptions. The Dutchmen also face an easily excited Great Dane crowd as next weekend is \Homecoming Week- end\ for Albany. Albany moved to Division II last year, but 4-0 is their best start since 1979. Union leads the series by an 8-3 ad van- tag~, and next year at Frank Bailey Field, the teams will face each other for the final time. With RPI following the Albany game, Union will have to fight hard in order to ensure a playoff spot. Division lll Football Poll 1. Mount Union (OH) (4-0) 2. Wisconsin- La Crosse ( 4-0) 3.

Field Hockey First in UCAA Football hy .Jonathan Gasthalter Sports Writ~r The Dutchwomen field hockey team entered the week atop the Upstate Col1egiateAthletic Asso- ciation with a 5-l record overall and a 4-1 record in the league. The team, which has been pow- ered by offensive standouts se- nior captain Christina Jabbour and junior Katie Gross, is looking down the road to the UCAA play- offs, which start on October 28, with enthusiasm.

Dutchmen posted their. second shutout of the season Saturday aftemool) at Rochester's Edwin Fauver Stadium, 42 to 0. Union simply overpowered an · undennanned Rochester squad. Entering the week on the tail end of a four game road tripon which they had won the first three games, the Dutchwomen faced off against Middlebury on Tuesday October 1st, hoping to complete the four game road stint with a win. Playing on grass instead of the turf they are used to, the Dutchwomen lost the game 4-1. Goaltender Rachel Rothschild ex- plained that the ball moves slower on turf, therefore slowing down the pace of the game. \You don't have to wait for the ball on turf, but on grass you .. can't really sit backandwaitforit.

Declet Staff Writer The Career Devdopment Cen• ter, under the stewardship ofT om Denham is fast becoming one of · the most important resources for Union College students, espe- hind Union's success in placing . seniors into compan.ies like Anderson Consulting comes from its attention to detail and its alumni connections.

For ex .. ample, Anderson Consulting, one of the largest consulting firms in the country has consistently hired students from Union College in great numbers. _In fact, 20 stu- dents last year became employ- ees of An.derson Consulting. Tom Denham likes to attribute this success to, \the strong rela- tionship b~tween Union and Anderson Consulting.\ Appar- ently, a managing partner was a Union alumni and since the com- pany has been extremely active on campus there are a lot of Union College alumni who are currently employed. In fact, the company is the largest recruiter and em- ployer of college graduates in the nation and most likeJy employs well over one hundred Union alumni. Apparently, the relationship is so strong between Anderson <;on- suiting and the CDC that the com- Along with these services the CDC has every year put on a suc- cessful Career Festival which has attracted companies from all over the Northeast region. 1'his year, the CDC sponsored Career Festival was a great sue- . cess and according to Tom Denham many of the recruiters were impressed with the quantity and quality ofUnion College stu- dents. Though there was an ob- vious lack of major corporations at the event, those companies and graduate schools thai were there have made the commitment to search out for qualified Union applicants. Complaints were far and few between, but the eDC was quick to point out that only about 1 0% of all students look- ing for jobs actually find one through the recruitment process. by Anjali Balasingham Staff Writer Fortunately, the undergraduate · admissions process is over for Union students. However, the cycle ofstudent recruitment and . application evaluation never ends ' at the Admissions Office. On Monday, October 12, Admissions hosted an Op_en House for pro- spective students and their fami- lies. Over three hundred students, many of whom were accompa- nied by family members, regis- tered for the event. The day opened in the Campus Cente'r at8:30 a.m. President Hull and Vice President and Dean of Admissions Dan Lundquist later welcomed the prospectives and their families in Memorial Chapel Students. then spent the rest of the day visiting classes, going on tours, and meeting with various academic departments. Dean Lundquist and the Ad- missions Office were principally responsible for making the Open House a reality. \Tbegoal ofthis · event,\ said Dean Lundquist, \is to expose prospective students and parents to the academic and extracurrieular life of Union,\ · The most important part of col- lege visitations, Dean Lundquist continued to say, is \for a student to see how he or she will fit into a particular college's community.\ The Admissions Office sees the Open House as a chance for stu- dents to do that. The Admissions Office is busy year-round with various projects. Union hosts several Open House events during the month of Au- gust. Over Winter Break, partici- pating Union students visit high schools in their communities to continue the recruitment process. From December to March, stu- dent applications are processed; and during April, the Admissions Office is open seven days a week, with programs for ac~epted stu- dents. Union is currently coping with \a new level of popularity\ ac- cording to Dean Lundquist. Two years ago, over 3600 undergradu- ate applications were fileq, the largest number in Union's his-:- tory. Last year that number slightly declined, but records were still broken when the num- ber of students matriculating in- creased sharply. The increases come despite .the increasing costs of college education and despite the vast number of c.ollege choices that seniors have. AU of this reflects the fact that Union is becoming more well-known. This is a goal toward which the Ad- miss ions om ce is continually striving. \Every roadsign I can look at is pointing up,\ Dean Lundquist assessed. The recent surge in popularity has significant implications for Union, especially with respect to selectivity. \Two years ago, Union's acceptance rate was at 55 percent.\ Dean Lundquist cited. \Last year it was 52 percent. This year, [with a] conservative esti- mate, we're looking at an adm is- s ions rate of under 50 percent, which would make us one of the most selective colleg~;:s in New York, right after Cornell and Co- lumbia.\ Lundquist emphasizes that this will make Union selec- tive in \the most positive sense. Union will ~e able -to select a more diverse student body, with a broader [spectrum] of interests. I'm excited by that prospect.\ Picture Yourself in the Peace Corps Information Meeting at: Union C6Jiege Thursday, October 24 College Center Room 4090 3:30-Spm . pany actually provided new equipment for the CDC to con- duct mock interviews. In return, \the CDC gives outstanding ser- vice, we go above and beyond,\ said Torn Denham. Its hard to argue against the successes of the CDC, it gets the recruiters here and it provides seniors with an untold number of other services. Acco~ding to Tom Denham, \At least 50% of all jobs are landed by networking, making it the number one job search tool.\ That is why the CDC has begun a new database known as U-CAN which stands for Union Career Advisory Network. Currently, over 650 Union alumni have signed up to become career advi- sors. As career advisors they can either simply advise students or go as far as to actively recruit stu- dents for a particular company. -~· Calll-800-424-8580 ext.l \'- , Peace Corps: The Toughest Job You'll Ever Love ff&HJ..;:t~A;.

In addition, a description ofthe paper's readers was included with copies of the paper itself, which wasjlldged on content and appearance. How- ever, the largest contributing fac- tor influencing the rating w.as the ratio of read newspapers in com- parison with the number of people on staff. The rating given to WRUC was also based on the ratio of listen- ers to Drs. Angelo Spenillo, Pro- gram Manager ofWRUC said, \I was shocked at the results because many people on campus have more respect for the newspaper than they do for the station. Stu- dents look forward to the paper each week but tend to complain that the WRUC programming is not listener-worthy.\ He men- tioned that students are more likely to appreciate the efforts of a club or a student-run activity if there is a tangible product. How- ever, Spenillo thought that it was an honor for WRUC to be recog- nized in national terms. Rating seventh in the country, WRUC surpassed un'iver&ities and colleges such as Syracuse, Skidmore, and Frankl in and Marshall, which all have larger student bodies than Union. Rating fifth in the country, and due to the generalized nature of the survey, Union College's Concordiensis beat the Universi- ties of Virginia, Tufts, Pennsyl- vania State. Georgetown, and Brandeis, which all have specific schools for journalism and also have much larger student bodies. Union also surpassed Northwest- .ern University, which has a top rate school for journalism. In terms of the paper, Editor- In-Chief Adrian Maclean said, \The·resultsprove that people are interested in the Union commu- nity, and like to keep on top of the issues. The Concordiensis strives to create interesting ar- ticles, and our staff is constantly working to _improve the quality and content of the paper.\ \Students have started to learn that everybody can use the power of journalism as a voice and a fo- rum fo~ people to bring to the forefront issues on the campus. Last year, students became accus- tomed to getting the most up-to- date information,\ David Pinkowitz, Executive Editor said. \The Concotdiensis has begun to serve as a venue where students can voice their concerns and read about issues reflecting the cam- pus as a whole. People are start- ing to realize that the Concordy has become a focus of interest for everyone to share, and a represen- tation of the many different. voices on our campus,\ Pinkowitz . continued.

World News Muslim Fundamentalist ·Government in Afghanistan by Karen Watts Worltl N~w Editor Almost t:hree weeks ago Taliban militia forces seized the city of Kabul which is the capital oJ Afghanistan. The new government is a Muslim fundamentalist government. In the short span of time that the government has assumed power, it has issued anum- ber of stringent decrees on the Kabul middle class. Most pastimes -of Afghan children, as well as music and dancing have been. banned. In addi-. tipn, women and girls have been ordered not to be al- lowed to work or go to school. As a result, many families have chosen· to leave their homes and head towards the Kabul River and across the mountains. ill order that they w~l soon reach Pakistan. The majority of Afghanistan that are under Tali~an control are however happy about one thin,g: the fundamentalists have achieved. the end of a - ment has al~o promised to reunite the country. For these reasons many are sat- isfied with the govern- ment, except those in Kabul. 'fhe citizens in Kabul are on the whole more edu- cated than the rest of the population in Afghanistan, thus i-t is harder for the people in Kabul to adhere to the new government. However, there are also those who feel that any- thing is worth having the war finally be over, even being subjected to Taliban rule. In order to keep up rela- tions ·with other countries, the provisional govern- ment has indicated that it may look over some of the decrees they have issued that have been unusyally ltarsh. In doing this they bope to prevent loss of for sign aid.

It was11't well publicized, nor was it well attended, 'but the few : posters th:at did make it to the walls ofthe Campus center started a · buzz am<>ng upperclassmen. The poster·advertised an \info1mal\ . . ~ brunch with the three remaining sororities for ladies in the class of ' ~ '00 and it had students who had experienced rush in the ,past won- i dering ifitwas starting early this year. We here at The Concordiensis, IJ are wondering where the administration, and, m<>re importantly, · -~ the IFC aild Panhell are headed in planning Rush. These new \informal\ rush events have been planned and carried out with .the knowledge of Dean Shurick, who is in charge of Greek affairs. These events are allowed because they are supposedly \in- formaP'. These events are classi-fied as informal because they are . · held on a \getting to know you\ basis. lf\getting to know\ is the ; catch phrase for \informal\ rush, The Concordiensis wonders what exactly \'formal\ rush is supposed to he'? Is that the part where freshman .girls are judged on the way they present themselves dur- ing their forty minute formal rush visits? But we digress; the main point is not the real definition of\infor- mal\ or ·'formal\ rush. The question is why the greeks are moving · rush earlier into the academic calendar as opposed to pushing it . back. Instead of trying to create a new \informal\ rush process, perhaps tile IFC and the Panhel should consider the merits of rnov- . ing rush to sophomore year. Freshma.tl year of college is one of the most difficult and change. filled experiences in many people's lives. It is the first time that: young adults, freed of direct parental control, can begin to explore: who they really are. If the average freshman has not yet figured. out who they are, how can they possibly deci<;ie between indepen-: dence or tile variety of lifetime sister/brotherhoods offered by the! fraternities and sororities? Fuzzy Mammals Ag.ainst the Rules It was tile consensus among The Concodiensis editorial board' that havinga year to observe a fraternity I sorority rush would be all. invaluable resource to use in making the decision to pledge. Last year several sororities and fraternities had huge portions of tlleir · pledge classes quit during the pledging process. Chances are~ if these students had a year to watch the students in the year ahead· pledge they probably wouldn't have bothered to pledge themselves. '· saving wasted time and hurt feelings. Every house also has it's · members, who after experiencing bother/sisterhood realize that it's. not for them, but don't de-bother/sister because they choose not to rock the boilt. This leaves a house with uncommitted members, and members unsatisfied with their commitment. Many houses also · find that tlleir most dedicated members are those who decided to pledge sopilomore year. The Concordiensis is not advocating reform that originates from the administration. Instead the IFC and Panhellenic Conference should weigh the merits of delaying rush until fall of sophomore year. It is impossible to predict whether defaying rush for two terms . would decrease the percentage of those who eventually rush, but it is nearly certain that delaying rush could only strengthen houses by filling them with unique, informed and committed members.

Dear Editor, I would Iilce to address you al>out the Pfanet C article by Mr. McKenzie P.Ublished in the Oc- tober 1oth issue of the Concordiensis. In this issae, Mr. McKenzie s article titled \Resi- dence Life Beats Small Fuzzy Mammals\ insulted myself and IUY fellow Resident Advisers. If Mr. McKenzie and Mr. Tanner had read the student handbook t~at they have received every year tllat they haveheen here at Union, tlley would know that on page 78 ill bold print the topic of pet:> is addressed. It r~ads as sucll, \All animals, including those used as lab specimens, are strictly pro- hibited, inside or-outside all resi- ..dence facilities. Visitors may not 'bring pets inside tbe resident:e facilities .. Fish are permitted; llowever, tank size must be lim- ited to 10 gallons or less.\ Now, I believe that this is a very clear a11d concise ruLe. Mr. Tanner lives in a residence hall and there- fore must follow the rules on f\()using outlined in the Student lla11dbook. Now, if Mr. Tanner feels that his small furry animal ils .a friend, that• s fine and dandy, i b11t the fact still remains that Mr. 1'a:imer' s guinea pig \Gysco\ is in violation of the rule. Even in your article, Mr. McKenzie, it ap- peared that Mr. Tanner was given a warning that .action would en- !;Ue. It is not Residence Life•sjob t() continue to ask Mr. Tanne~ to fin.d a new home for hh~. friend, Gysco. If Mr. Tanner truly care~ f-(lr his friend he would have ei- tller talked witn Dean Williams i11s=tead of just getting voicemails, ()r he would have found a new ltorne for his friend. The bottom line is that there are rules that all students must follow. When th<Jse rules are broken, action mu.st be taken. If every person OJl tltis campus brought their fa- V()rite fuzzy friend from home to li-ve on this earn pus it would be- come a zoo. I c11re about the two cats that I had to leave at home, but ilteyare at home, not here. Mr. McKenzie, if y0u truly believe tint the office of Residence Life is trying to vent anger, you are making an even larger fool of yourself. Dean Williams, Mr. Giancola,. Mr. Canavan, and Mrs. Rodrigue are all hardworking professionals. To suggest that they are attacking a guinea pig is preposterous. Mr. Tanner was violatingarule and they were try- ing to fix the problem. Mr. Tan:.. ner should take more responsibil- ity for his actions and he should not feel that he was being at- tacked. Anyone who has a pet in the Residence Halls will be forced to remove it from the Resi- dence Halls. So I suggest to you, Mr. McKenzie, that you do your homework before making a fool of yourself once again in front of the restofthe col lege community. If you have any questions about the rules, it would be best if you called the office of Residence Life and asked before opening your mouth and sticking your foot in it.

Of the 2,000+ people at Union, only 635 committed themsel-ves to this end. According to statistics, one in four females will be the victim of rape, attempted rape, or sexual assault during their four years In · college. The students of Union are not exempt from this horrific fact. Safe Space ·created these sheets to illustrate Union's com- mitment to the issues of sexual violence. However, the results display an alanning indifference or ignorance ofthe issue. Some individuals dec.ided again~t signing the. sheets because they fe.lt that their personal dedi- cation was enough or that sign- ing the sheets would not actually reduce sexual violence on cam- pus. What will it take to make people realize that rape doesn't just ·happen to other people? Does it have to happen to your sister? Your brother? Your best friend? Someone is raped in the US ev- ery 24 seconds; people are get- ting raped while you read this let- ter. Why should it take a rape close to you to make you aware? It shouldn't. For those who did sign the sheets, thank you. We realize that your signature is your commit- ment to creating a safer environ- ment and we wholeheartedly ap- preciate your concern .. Rape hap- pens at Union; we arenotany dif- · ferent than any other colleges in · this manner. Don't think it can't happen to you, and don't think it doesn't happen here. When you think that rape isn't an important issue, remember that one out of . four women you know are living proof that it is ...

To the Editor, As Co-Chairmen of the Con- cert Committee, we are disap-. pointed by the fact that there was no _Jnention pf, or revie~ .for SkaFest '96 featuring Conehead Buddha and The Allstonians. As we were only 100 tickets short of a sellout, our show held in Upper-Class on Saturday, Oc- tober 5, 1996, proved to be a suc- cess. Both ba~ds played rema~k­ able' sets, and the audience seemed to have a great time at the show, skanking away for hours until dropping to the ground out of pure exhaustion. Part of the $97 that each stu- dent pays per year to Student Activities is put into the Concert Committee's budget of $24,625. As a committee, we did our best to spend your money by putting on a show that would appeal to a wide audience without bringing in a huge name. Basically, our budget did not permit us to bring The Dave Matthew's ·Band to cam- pus, sowe did our best to. put on a show that was relatively inex- pensive, and that we believed the college would like .. Unfortunately, as there was no evidence in the October 10 issue of The Concord{ensis, it is obvi- ous that a Ska show did not go over so well on this campus. In order to prevent this from happening in the future, sometime in the next couple of weeks, ttle Concert Committee will be put- ting in everybody's mailbox a list of possible bands to play here at Union in January, It would he greatly appreciated if you could circle one or two of the bands that you would like to see, and return our questionnaire to the mailbox of the Concert Committee.

Thurber Rejects Lambastment To the Editor, Let me begin s<Jrnewhere in the vicinity of the beginning. Last week Lauren Finkel' wrote a letter to the editor concerning two ofrtly 'recent articles. One entitled, \The Bases: Rules and Definitions for Collegiate Players'~, and the other my \Students ofthe Week\ award. Now before I begin, :I must say that I thought Lauren~s letter was par- ticularly well written and thought- fuL It was clear to me that it was not written in haste or out of per- sonal vengence. V/ith that said however, her issues with my writ- ing are woefully rn is~uided. · Lauren has accused me; of . · .• ·- . .R ' writting without ccnsidering the consequences, and:that the two ar- ticles in questio~ llave been of, \questionable appropriateness for a studentnewspaper,andborder on bad ~te\. Weill t11ust say that I take offense to that,. my articles do not border on bad taste, but rather wallow in it. The pieces I set forth revell in their \questionable appropraiteness\ tlleytake heart in the fact that some people findthem offensive and crass, in effect \bad taste\ and \inappr()opriateness\ are precisely my targ;et. So then it seems to me that tl1e two articles in «question\ have struck their mark true. Specifically thOLLgh, Lauren had a problem with the way in which I wrote about \stealing bases\. In this case, it is my fault. I was not clear with my intentions. In no way did I mean to imply that \stealing\ a base was analogus to sexual assualt. Here in lies the rub. What I should have· made clear was that when one is on the \bases\, oneiswith a partner (well hopefully, unless he or she is \walking\), arid that the decision to steal a base is made by both players, as partners and team- mates are adpt to do in the game. Unfortunately I was not clear in this issue, and for this incapacity or oppacity I do appologize. If I caused any readers to lie awake at 11ight wondering why 9r ho'f on earth J <;ould possibly make light of sexual assault, I do hum- bly appologize, and beg for par- don .. And if the above is not suffi- cient attrition, I would offer this, \Screw'em if they can't take a joke\. Lauren's second p~;:oblem was with the \Students of the Week\ award, given to her floor for an alleged party. It seems that Lauren specifically tQok issue with the fact that she and her floor got in trouble for what I wrote. If you want my opinion on the absurdity ofthat whole situation, read last week's \Administrator of the Week\ secti()n. In addition, Lauren hopes that in the future I would, \reform thetopicsof(my) articles so that other people on cam- pus will not have to pay for them\. Well as long as I'm being hon- est, and although I do indeed regret causing any trouble for Lauren and her floor (that obviously was not my intention), I must say that Lauren's final point seems to be rather irri- tating nonsense. Should a reporter, or any writer for that matter, not report something, or omit other as- pects of a story, so that it will not reflect, \poorly on all people in- volved,\ as Lauren stated? Does Lauren want a paper full of bland nothings? A paper so middle of the road that its only pragmatic func- tion is as bird-cage liner? Is Lauren a prop.orent ot censorship? Obvi- ously not. · J deeply appreciate her courage and candor concerning my articles. But as I will definitely work on be- ing more clear in my writing, I would hope that Lauren works on her sense of humor. Try not to take everything so seriously. Most of what I write is intended to be funny (whether or not it actually is, is an- other matter all together), but not harmful. If Lauren finds something i pen offense I would offer this ad- vice: take ten deep breaths, get a fro- yo, and get over it. How important is what I say anyway? Sincererly, Rawson Thurber Delta· Phi, or Parking Lot? To the Editor, Aftetreadinglastweeks' article concerning the ~ouse of Delta Phi; I felt that a response was nec- essary. none other than the esteemed Eliphalet Nott, in whose name the school prides itself. students be slowly robbed of their chance for an enjoyable college career? Delta Pgi has been an integral part in the Greek System since its' founding in 1827. Delta P'h i is the longest continuously running fraternity in the United States. In fact, if not for Delta Phi brother John Jay Hyde, the Greek system would have faded ·in the mid- 1800's.

You did an excellent job of de- ~~~~:::~'Frank Wicks His argument was so convincing The brothers of Delta Phi should be given a chance to pre- serve this history and receive aid in the renovation of their house. Delta Phi is not a fund-raising or- ganization, and needs help from the school in the solicitation of donations. The Administration is too quick to look at the down- side of Delta Phi, without weigh- ing the positive aspects of its' ex- istence on campus. As shown in last week's article about Phi Delta Theta, Greek organizations can give a good time to Union College through special events in the name of charity. Ask most alumni about their Greek expe- rience and they will tell you it was the best time they ever had. Why then, should today's Union If Union College supports the Greek system enough to mention it in the Student Handbook among the \firsts why is it so hesitant to lend a helping hand to a potentially beneficial organization? If Eliphalet Nott could support Delta Phi, why is today's Administration finding it so difficult? The lead- ers of this school should state their position on the Greek system. If they are against it, they should stop pretending to care. Ifthey support the system, they should do all they can to help it. The preservation of Delta Phi will help the school far more than a few extra parking spaces for visitor parking. scribing the exhibit and speaker that Union President at that time before the event accompanied Nott Memorial Exhibits Commit .. with photographs by Laurie tee Do U ha~ve tm opinion?

Election Watch · · · - 'illl1e \!Ion~ud1imsis October 17, 1996 Page 9 - Political Opinions Do The Debates Even Make a Difference? by Jody Mousseau Staff Writer \All -the world's a stage,\ and the Preyidential debates are no exception. The 1996 presi- dential campaigns have pre- sented a fair amount pf charac- ter bashing and il)sue avoidance. One source stated, --voters typically identify candidate de\ bates. as the source of the most influential information gained during a campaign.\ How true is this claim? Where does the influence which persuades voters' ()pin- ions of the candidates really come from? This is the ques- tion that we must begin with in order to evaluate the first ques- tion. In the New York Times on October 4, James Bennett commented that sources were \trying to explain wliy Presi- dent Clinton led Bob Dole by only 9 points on Saturday and by 25 points on Sunday.\ Per- haps the \poll point shifting\ phenomenon is not a salient is- sue_ to a .majority of the elec-· torate.

Abbott, ill, Contributing Writer In 1992, amid allegations of infidelity with a lounge singer named Gennifer Flowers. then Governor William Jefferson Clinton was elected President of Umted States. Soon into his pre-sidency, Clinton was named in a sexual harassment suit, where he reportedly dropped his trousers, exposed himself and. requested Paula Jones \d() it\. While these allegations of sexual impropriety are made issues by those who have little else to in- dite the Clinton presidenc.y on. they have become focal points of <;er!aifl movements against the President. The morality issue raised by Bob Dole has become the mantra of his campaign. Dole believes it is necessary to promote himself as a pillar of morality while denigrating Clinton as a .sexually proruiscu~ ous little boy, intent upon noth- ing else but bringing this nation to his level of moral depravity. What is the impetus for. this assessment of the president? The blame must' lay with the media, who act as leeches upon the jugular of this nation, slowly sucking the lifeblood from the centers of intelligence, morality and fairness. Clinton's philan- dering is important to a small number of people, his family, and should not be relevant to our decision making processes. We elect an official, not for their proficiency in sexuaJ affairs, but for the reason that we believe that they will be able to provide sound leadership. If the allega- tions of marital infidelity are true, then it is up to Hillary Rodham Clinton to pass judg- ment upon President Clinton, not the public, and certainly not the media. The media is fed by two sources; the lowest common de- nominator of the aware public, and those who benefit from al- legations against Clinton, i.e. the media themselves, and the Re- publican party. The.Republican party, or one of its mouthpieces, mentions that Clinton may not be the most moral person in the world, the media picks up the issue and tries to build headlines around it. The Repl,lblicans and their media mouthpieces, Sununu and Limbaugh, com- ment upon the article they saw in the paper regarding alleged infidelities and the circle is com- _ plete, the instant story line can be followed. PresideDt Clinton is a family man, havrng been only married to his law school sweetheart, Hillary R.odliam, while Rep. Newt Giltgrich and Sen. Dole are both divorcees, having tom the fabric ()(the American fam- ily and disregarding the sanc- tity of the, some may say, holy vows ofmatrimony. They have both remarried, and according to some religious doctrines, are living in sin. Yet because di- vorce is now accepted as nor- -mal practice, they are not at- tacked as lacking morality and they see themselves fit for gov- ernmental service. Using this rational, many people have ex- tramarital affairs, ergo they, the affairs, are a normal practice, and, evea if. it was any of the public's c-<>ncern, the ability of the practitioners of the affairs to govern is not impaired. The Clinton White House does not mention this though, for two reasons; firstly, whi-le logically true, it is an absurd argument, and secondly, President Clinton is runniiig an issue oriented campaign and his presidency is similarly motivated. For Presi- dent Clinton to delve into the realm of moral oneupmanship would seriously damage Clinton's reputation as a re- former and put him on the same level as a Dole, Gingrich, or D'Amato. While President Clinton's term in office may not have pro- vided reassurance to the Chris- tian right about his coll1111itment to family values, the signing of the Defense of Marriage Act, while unconstitutional, shows that outwardly Clinton is willing to make difficult decisions that may undercut his popularity within certain demographics who saw him in a favorable light. This alone should quell discon- tentment about Clinton's con- tinual campaigning and appease- ment of those who brought him to power. It should also show that Bill Clinton is a man of integ- rity. This integrity is not shown through his personal life, where we have no right to judge, let alone see, but tlrrougb the actions that we elected him for, the abil- ity to govern wen, keep the United States the strongest na- tion in the world. and to make the hard decisions when it be- comes necessary. healthcare in one debate, be- cause the public has already heard it.

It has al~ays been played out as \greeks vs. the ad- ministration\ and consequently, I never gave it much thought. It took an early morning mozz-stick session at one ofourcampus' fine eating outlets to make me realize how brilliant the administration's policy of forcing every on-cam- pus student to purc.hase the meal plan is. I was eating with a couple of friends, one of them a Sig Phi brother. Eventually, we drifted on to the subject of meals at his house. He buys the lO meal plan even though though he pays sepa- rately to eat at his house. The administration feels his pain, so they more than willingly allow him to give 7 ofhis meal punches to his house in the form of meal equivalences. And though we all pay over 7 dollars per meal punch, dining· services gives un- der 5 dollars back to his house, keeping a hefty percentage for a service charge. This practice-which amounts to no more than robbery-is ac- tually only the tip of the admin- istrations diabolical iceberg. Ev- ery student on this campus is forced to b.uy the tneal plan. Think about it; for four years, you will never have the chance to try and buy better meals with that $7.20 we are all currently paying to dining services. Though it poses quite a challenge to buy better food for $7.20, I'm sure many students feel they're up to the challenge. EconomicaJiy and positionally the administration is in an envi- able position. Most restaurants have to provide value and qual- ity in order to attract patrons. Dining services no longer has that burden, by cooking to a captive · audience, they could serve pea- nut butter and jelly at every meal Senior Interviewers Helping to Select Union's Future Students by Michelle Tham Contributing Writer In its fifth year running, the Se- nior Interviewers program at Union College is as successful as ever. The Admissions Office has discovered an innovative way of augmenting their st.affthrough the use of rising seniors. Typically ranging between 5-.8 student in- terns, the program has aided in interviewing an increasing num- ber of upcoming prospective freshmen. \We receive many more inter- view requests than we can possi- bly handle, and the interns ben- efit us in innumerable ways; con- ducting over a third of all inter- views on campus,\ says Kristine Gernert-Dott, the Associate Dean of Admissions and founder ofthe program. The use of students to show prospectives a more personalized view ofthe U11ion College envi- ronment has helped the school immensely. The interns act as a representative of the college and often times lend a less threaten- ing atmosphere to the entire ad- missions process. Gernert-Dott, a graduate ofthe 1986 Union class, created this program in order to give some- thing back to the college that gave so much to her. The Associate Dean of Admissions has also given an amazing opportunity to members of the student body. \The program has given me the chance to play a direct part in the application process and actually make an impact as to the type and caliber of students that come here,\ Erica Leipheimer said. The 7 interns on staff are: Jen- nifer Batts, Greg Buchanan, Ja- son Jennings, Stephanie Lavine, Amy Leavitt, Erica Leipheimer and Alyson McKee. Their work covers over a third of all the in- terviews that come through the admissions office. Approxi- mately 2000-2100 applicants are interviewed, and the interns each interview 100 of the prospective students. This rigorous process ·. involves over 8 hours of inter- viewing in a typical week in the months of September-February, April and May. The interns are paid $6/hour fo.r their time. The salary of the job is not what is most attractive to these int.ems. Jennifer Batts stated, \I love working as a senior interviewer because of the number of inter- esting, vibrant personalities that I get to meet. I'm usually a good judge of character, and that helps me bring out the student's life ( outside of what we receive on pa- per.\ That quality of wanting to meet people is one of the characteris- tics that Gernert-Dott looks for in a interviewer. A combination of confidence, poise, maturity and charisma may also go .along with finding the right senior. And that sense of personality is so impor- tant because it shows the Admis- sions Office that an interview with the senior will result in a successful evaluation. The application process for the interns begins some time in the spring and is followed by a se- ries of training sessions. Chosen seniors will sit in on anywhere from 8-1 0 actual interviews and by the fall term they are ready to interview on their own. The in- terviews last between 45 minutes to an hour and interns are re- quired to tllen spend about 15 minutes preparing a cohesive evaluation of the interview. AU these evaluations are ultimately looked over by Gernert-Dott and are usually perfect for the appli- cation file. The interns are also encouraged to foUow-up on their interviews and find out if admis- sion has been granted. . Besides tne benefitan applicant rec~ives from-having a senior in- terviewer, the interns themselves have found that the program has also given them a lot. Rebecca Gergely~ a past intern from the Class of '95 arid recipient of the Watson fellowship, now works in the Union Admissions Office and has gained so many life skills · from having been an intern. \What the program does is gives these students a chance to hone their own interviewing skills for the professional world. and leaves these bright youths with such great future success,\ Gernert-Dott said. What Gem ert-Dott and the Ad- missions Office have the given the Union community is a stronger chance of bringing vibrant and arresting student personalities to campus. They have also given ris:- ing seniors the chance to take on responsibility and make an impact on student life. \Kris has given me a lot of per- spective in my interviewing skills. She will always support my strong points and is never afraid to show me my faults,\ Intern Alyson McKee said of Gemert-Dott. The Senior Interviewers Pro- gram presents immense advan- . tages for Union and its students and through participating in the . process, students have gained im- measurable benefits.

Tllat in mind, I would like to hurnilly offer· the administration a11d ilill- ing services some ideas for eqall- sion oftheir current exploitation ' of the student body. 1. Require aU students to l).u;:y paper from the school !Jo>(J'I< store. Have paper made with auttique water mark, inflate the price in- credibly and force all stmlemt to buy it. With a little bribery all the faculty could require as>i~n­ ment to be passed in on official paper-· the profits could be lllcrra- tive. 2. Institute tolls Don't stand for the st11de:nt body trodding over ·all of y().ur walk-ways without pay illg a dime. Place toll-booths at al]!';i<le- walks and on Squire Whip~le's bridge, to charge exorbinant use- tolls. Then, strategically place students in dorms according to their class schedule so that ·long, expensive trips to class are un- avoidable. · 3. Put a coin slot in all ~ollege owned toilet paper.-dispensers Not only would this practice generate extra revenue, but it would cut down on waste and sewage .problems. 4. Remove all water fountains Give dining services the excluM sive contract on wateL This would provide added incentive to buy a large meal plan (most hu- mans drink more than once a day). Special bonus:· Charge extra for \Schenectady's finest\ brown water. 5. Charge for air Why should students freely use all that oxygen produced by col- lege-owned trees in Jackson's gardens. Require all students to wear oxygen usage meters, and, once again, charge exorbinate rates for oxygen use. Naturally, athletes would run up too large a bill to be incurred individually. Instead, have teams pay a flat rate per praetice or game. .~ Top 10 Quotes From Kenya 10. Those are colonial l.eft()vers.- Stephanie Master 9. Are you gonna eat tihat? - Laurel Salzman 8.

Administrator of the Week: The W_orld of W edgies by Jeffery Druzba Staff Writer Everything has a wedgie if you think about it. I don't think I'm overstepping the boundaries of the world of wedgies in making that statement. Wedgies are ev- erywhere. Oh, but let me clear something up first. I'm not refer- ring to the \wedgie\ of childhood days gone by (though that sort of wedgie is surely the foundation for the modem day wedgie). The wedgie has come to mean so m!lch more. It's a state of being in between something(s); a mo- mentary state of confusion. I think, to illustrate, we'll need to go over some of the many wedgies we stumble upon in ev- eryday life. Have you ever been driving along the highway, listening to the best radio station a part-icular region has to offer, when the sta- tion suddenly fades and melds into some other song (usually something by Randy Travis) on another radio station? What you've just entered is a radio wedgie. You'll soon be out of it but you'll also have to tum the station. The strange thing about the radio wedgie is that no matter how completely cool the station you aFe listening to is, without fail; it transforms itself over a three m:iJe ·stretch into the twangiest of GO!lntry stations on the dial. Sometimes y()u'H be walking along and you 'II see somebody approaching you. up ahead so you move to one side of the sidewalk only to find that they have moved there as welL Eoth individuals, realizing the c<>llision that will ensue on their present courses, then change to the other side of the sidewalk. Eventually, some- one stays where they are and the potentially dangerous situation resolves itself. <Juess what? For a moment there, y()u were trapped in a movement wedgie. Someone you know might walk by while you are in a rush some- where and say hello. Occasion- ally, you don't quite hear that per- son and it doesn't register in your mind that they said hello until you are a few yards past them. That's when your delayed response is thrown to the wind. Your ac- ']Uaintance is gone and next time you see them, they probably won't greet you. just because you seemed rude last time. Your \hello\ went where so many go ... the swirling eternity of the hello wedgie. When you put a CD in the player and it spins and makes a little noise while it's loading up the track list... that's a CD wedgie. That interval between when you click on a <omputer program to open it ancl when it actually opens ... a computer wedgie. The time period when you log in to your e-mail account and have to . wait a few seconds for the <idol.druz:b-aj> (or whatever yours says) prompt to come up ... that's ctn e-mail wedgie, As you call see, wedgies come in any soli of flavor. They might involve acti()ns, people, or objects but no matt~r how you look at them, they are wedgies just the same. Leavn 1 know, and be able to recognize the wedgies around you. Hopefu Hy you've already begun. By the w.ay, the time pe- riod between when you wake up on Thursdays and when you pick up your Concordy has a special name. You ka10w that feeling of being incomplete until you get yout own Co ncordy? That's caused by a wedgie known only to Union's c11mpus: (lsn 't it ob- vious by now? You're getting good at tbis .)

Secure your job today! • by Stephanie Slobotkin News Editor This past summer, President Roger Hull joined his wife, Anne · Dyson as a volunteer in a program called Hole in the Wall, for chil- dren afflicted with cancer or other life threatening diseases. Hull spent one week devoting his time to those in need and in doing so, found the experience both life giving and rewarding. The program, which was founded by Paul Newman, is funded by the $ t 6 m iII ion Newman makes in profits from his food product company. The program is held each summer in Ashford, Connecticut, has II ses- sions and hosts 170 children each weekly session ranging in age from 8-16. Coming from all parts ofthe United States, the children spend 8 days doing various activi- ties such as hiking, fishing, and boating. Hull was moved by many by aspects of the program but felt most strongly about a ceremony called, \In the Woods,\ in which a 16 year old student stood up who had a disease he had never heard of before. Th·e boy had re- ceived a bone marrow transplant, but the marrow rejected his sys- tem, causing llis body to look de- cades older than that of nortnal teenager, Hu11 said. The young man recited a poem about the in- credible time he was having in the program and how this was his re- lease; yvh_ere he could be himself. After Hull got over a natural fear of ill patients who were get- ting treatment, sttch as chemo- therapy, and looked too sick to be outdoors, he realized that this one week was the only chance for these children to i-ndulge in activi- ties they might never be able to do again. \Now I see through the eyes ofthe ill and appreciate that they no longer see the illness.\ Hull helped by volunteering with boating and fishing and en- joyed spending time with all of the children, learning more about the value of life from each indi- vidual, and all the while revering their enthu~iasm. Hull said he carried a young girl on h'is back who was too weak to walk, also knowing this was probably her last year there. Her father had recieved a transfusion, her mother had died and this was a week for her in the past for years where she could be herself. The highlight <>f the program for Hull was the j<Jy he saw ema- nating from the young boys and girls and the fulfillment they got out ofthe program. \They don't have to worry about what other people think of them,\ Hull said, \they relax, have fun, and enjoy the out- doors.\ Hull said there are two categories of people who work at the camp. There are those who get paid and spend the summer and others who may also stay for the summer, but are volunteers. Many of the volunteers are col- lege students and Sotne have had cancer or other diseases. Hull got in'Volved with the Hole in the WaH, n()t only because his wife is a pedi~trician and her fam- ily had supported it, but also due to the fact thatlle feels adamantly about taking part in volunteerism and standing u·;p for something. Hull also said after his summer volunte-eri n~ experience, \ I learned that although you plan the future, you I ive the present be- cause you dDn 't always know if there will be a future.\ Hull said the program helped him appreciate life to it's fullest. \It makes yousee how lucky you are not to have a disease, but also how great it is. to be able to help those who do. You get much more back th~n you put in.\ In relation to Union College and it's student body, Hull prac- tices what he preaches. As he said in his c<Jnvocation speech as well as at com111encement, \Stand for something - what you stand for is less imr>ortant than just get- ting involved .. \ He also said the men and women on this campus may do well , but they need to have the obli~ation to give back to the commun ity in one form or another. \Their experience won't be complete,'' 11ull said, \if they don't go out tl1ere and help oth- ers.\ He empllasizes his personal view as an e<iucator in wanting students to rn~ke a difference, do well, and do good. \People d<J well, but it's a ques- tion ifthey'lldo good,\ Hull said, \a fully educated person must do both - receiving as well as giv- ing.\ - .....

Dire.cted by James Foley. Rated R, Universal Pictures. Rating: ** (ont of jour) The Chamber is the kind of run- of-the-mill movie. adaptation of a John Grisham novel that has been raking up bo~ office dough for years now. Wbile mast Grisham books don't rna:ke compelling movies because plot turns and characters are lost in the transla- tion, The Chamber takes Grisham movies to new lows: a story with a minimal plot to begin with is drawn-out into a two-hour ordeal. one new movie a week, is the shin- ing star in this misguided movie. He plays Sam Cayhall,.a thirddgen ... eration Klansman who is sen- tenced to die in Miss.issippi prison for blowing up a Jewish lawyer's office in 1967 which ki!Jed the lawyer's two small boys and maimed tile lawyer. The story essentially concerns Cay-hall's grandson's efforts to free the ag- ing and defeated grandfather. Dunaway, looking like she's had one facelift too many, plays Cayhall 's daughter, who wants her father executed for the cold- bleoded killing she witnessed him make in her childhood. She's a true southern belle, entertaining many houseguests in a pretty dress and taking to the bott]e when her past returns to haunt her. Also adding to the list of \world's greatest throw-away ro:les\ whi.ch Sandra Bullock helped to create in A Time to Kill is Rochon as the state governor's. legal aide. Similar to Bullock in the summer Grisham movie, Rochon .Plays a woman just two steps from being the leading player's romantic interest. With 110 spark to ignite and no supporting role in Hall's case, she does noth- ing to make the plot more engag- ing. Thestorythistime around does not have a terribly significant is- sue to explore from the start. Hackman, who appears in at least As Adam Hall (the name was changed to hide the connection toCayhall), O'Donnell's interpre- tation of a lawyer is the most bland ina Grisham movietodate-even Tom Cruise offered more spark in The Firm.

Jackson, Brian C~.;;. Directed by Renny Harlin. J?.ated R, New Line Cinema Pictures. Rating: ***{<Jut of four) Maybe the phrase \first is the worst, second is the best\ has some truth to it. Dir-ector Renny Harlin, after ma.kirtg last year's MGM Pictures aw~sh in red ink with last year's ltlega-disaster, Cutthroat Islam!, is given some money to direct llis \vife, Davis, again in The -Long Kiss Goodnight. Knovv.lug; Harlin' s<re- centtrack·record, this is one movie that's easy to dislike. The truth is th·is might be the i\'est Kis~ to be released this fall. Harlin has created a mainstream film so off-beat, so daring, and so subliminally \Tanmtin()an\ in storythat it defies convention and is a tluill to sit through from its peaceful start to the explosive fi- nale. Suddenly, a director-actress team ~hat was ready to be laughed out of theaters has staged a mar- velous comeback. Dmds .is Samantha Caiue; who for eight years:has kn(!rwn no life o.therthanPTA meetings, school- teaching, and playing Santa's sexy wife in a town Christrn~ pag- eant. She knows she has amt:ie- sia, but she does not know what her Ji.fe was -like before. Her past returns in ffragtnents aftera: Christ- mas party, when sh'elcrashes her car into a tree after• hitting a deer. Ignoring the fact tha:t this is one ofthe .few movies· to show a deer getting hit ·dead-on j)y a. car, Caine's instincts lead her to snap the suffering deer's neck to put it out of misery. Soon, she is be- having radically different. Hertal- ents with a kitchen knife lead her to beJ.ieve she was a chef in her former life. When a thug comes to kill her at home, she properly takes him out, much to the shock of her husband. As Caine notes, \chefs do that,\ pointing to the bloody mess ofthe bad guy lying dead on the kitchen .floor. Caine remembers her former self as Charly Baltimore, and with the help of a cheap private detective played by Jackson, she sets out to discover her past life. The past catches up te her quickly . .She ~s' actnatly ·a government assassin who· is wanted by corru('lt CIA officials. One government agent, played by Brian Cox, tries to help her, but the still~partially-amnesiac Caine/Baltimore and the skeptical Chart- Toppers detective don't know who to trust. The sheer novelty of the fHm lies in its storytelling. The film opens with cheery Christmas jingles and a warm, cozy party at the Caine's residence. Picture- perfect snowfall on the village streets make this seem Hke a Disney family piece. From there, it immediately evolve~ into an ali- or-nothing-at-aU mayhem. Sud- denly, mommy's got a handgun, and she's snapping the necks of every bad guy in her path. Jack- son adds punch to screenwriter Shane Black's witty dialogue. As a duo, Davis and Jackson are box- office dynamite -·· this is the strangest pairing since Jackso11 worked with Travolta it:i Pulp Fic- tion. While the film loses its fresh feel toward to the end, when gra- tuituous action and killings take over, the script still has a few tricks up its sleeve. Among them is Jackson's John McClane- like re- peated getaways from death. There is also a bridge explosion which, filmed from many angles, is a sheer blast. The film works so hard at going for broke that it ends up hitting the mark almost every time. This is the only recent film to feature a mother an.d daughter break out of a locked freezer by using a little gasoline and a pack of matches, as well as Christmas carolers being held at gunpoint. Harlin weaves in horrifying dream sequences in which Caine i'S haunted by her alter ego. A sug- gestive romance between the two leads never. quite flourishes, but this is one example ofwhcere a foot- note attraction only add~ 'to the mounting complications, rather than frustrating the story's pro- gression.

... Science & Technology E -=== :·=== Mutation Gives Resistance to· AIDS by Michael Greenbaum Science Editor Sometimes a mutation in the human genome (the DNA which codes for who you are genetically) goes unnoticed, other times it leads to a geneti~ disorder. Occa- sionally a mutation gives an indi- vidual an auspicious edge over his/her peers. It wiH not cause x- ray vision or some other super- man-like superpower, but a muta- tion could create an increased re.- sistance towards a disease. Re- sistance to Malaria is a classic ex- ample. At fertilization, an indi- vidual inherits two complete sets of DNA, one from each parent. If the individual inherits a mutant gene from just one parent and a normal gene from the other par- ent (so~called heterozygous), he receives resistance to Malaria. Unfortunately, receiving a mu- tated gene from both parents (ho- that the CCR5 mutation might pro- served that only 10.8% ofthe in-- mozygous) leads to Sickle Cell vide protection from HIV came fected individuals wereheterozy- Anemia, a lethal disease afflicting from Ned Landau and Richard gotes.

The HIV virus that es- resistance towards a disease. tablishes the initial infection must bind to the CCR5 co-receptor to enter cells; however, once a per- son is infected, the virus mutates creating additional forms that do not need the co-rec·eptor. Unlike the genes that give re- sistance to Malaria, it is good to receive two mutant copies of the CCR5 gene. The first indication dividuals, each with two copies of the mutant gene. Despite re- peated exposure to the HIV virus, these hom.ozygous individuals did not become infected. Further evidence came from Pannentier's group. They tested 723 HIV -in- fected Caucasians and found that none of them had two mutant CCR5 genes. Parmentier also ob- CCR5 mutations in 195 5 .people, the largest study- of its kind to date. Like Parmentier's study, not one of the infected subjects was h-o- mozygous for theCCR5 mutation. O'Brian's results differed from Parmentier's for the heterozygous group. According to O'Brian's data, having just one mutant gene does not help. The results differ because Parmentier der:ived much ofhisdatausing HIV-uninfected people from the general popula• tion. O'Brian used well charac- terized bloodsamples.from six co- horts ofpeople ath igh risk for HIV infection. Because they ave high risk, they provide a better test of the .effectiveness of heterozygos- ity. Although just one mutant gene does not prevent infection, O'Brian did see indications that is could retard the progression of AIDS. Many new AIDS researchers are now working on turning these findings into treatments or vac- cines, but it is too soon to say thatthe CCR5 gene is a sure-fire target. Information for this article came from \Receptor Mutations Help Slow Disease Progress ion\ in the September 27, 1996 issue of Science. P R .I N C I P L E S of S 0 U N D RET I R E M EN T I N.

Sviti{ In order to understand how the Earth operates, geologists have to \read\ planetary language in the form of rock chemistry, mineral- ogy, rock textures, and other as- sortments of Earth communica- tion. One overlooked discovery in geology is that nearly 97 per- cent of all the oceans originate as groundwater, and interestingly enough, little is known about how this underground water moves through the planet. No one has ever measured the ~m()unt of groundwater that enters the sea, and Williard Moore, a geochem- ist at the Univ. ofS. Carolina, be- lieves that more groundwater reaches the oceans than previ- ously suspected. Grovndwater, which is contained in underground layets of rock pores that may be thousands of feet thick, leaks into the sea in tw() primary ways. The first way is by coastal springs coming in direct contact with the oceans. The sec- ond way is by a process called tidal pumping. Tidal pumping is the result of a high tide. Salt wa- ter' which is denser than fresh wa- ter, mixes with groundwater, satu- rating rocks and sediments on the continent(!! shelf. Whe11 the tide wanes, the brackish seawater and groundwater solution is brought out into the ocean. This mecha- nism is repetitive. Moore con- firmed that groundwater enters the oceans chiefly through this process by measuring a zoo:..m.ile stretch of South Carolina coast. Both rivers and groundwater carry certain chemical isotopes. In particular, radium 226, which is one of the isotopes found in riv· ers and groundwater, is eroded off rocks and soH and is brought out to the oceans. Seawater near the continental she!~ contains a higher proportioo of 2 6 Rd because the d.iJution process has not fully dif- fused the radium before it reaches the deeper areas of the ocean. Knowing the isotope geochemis- try of groungwater and rivers, Moore realized that rivers alone could not explain the high radium content in the Myrtle Beach ar- eas, where no river empties into the sea. The geochemistry of ground- waterand river water is fundamen- tally· different; groundwater can hold a higher concentration of dis- solved material than rivers be- cause the water trapped beneath the ground is not easily oxidized. Since groundwater contains less oxygen t~an river water, metals and other materials seldom oxidize and do not efficiently bind to trace elements. Bound elements be- come imbedded in sediment that remains stuck in the riverbeds or trickles down to the sea.floor. Therefore, most metals remain dis- solved wh~n groundwater comes in contact with seawater. \Typi- caJly we find dissolved trace ele- ments in groundwater to be liter- ally orders of magnitude higher than in.river water,\ Moore says. Moore's findings could be·sig- n ificant imp Iication by altering our previous understandings of paleo-oceanogrphy. Paleo•ocean- ographers, who study how the oceans were in the past, princi- pally study chemical elements found in cotes drilled from the sea.:. floor. The chemical element cad- mium, for example, is found in the shells of certain creatures called foraminifera. When these organ- , isms die, they leave a record in the sediments which gives. a mea- sure of the abundance of life in ocean history. Groundwater is now understood to contain a high \' abundance of cadmium itself. Given Moore's new findings, re- searchers may have to reevaluate their estimates of ancient ocean life.

The team was looking fotward to its game against St. Lawrence on October 12th, which would decide who wou·ld finish first in the UCAA and who would finish third. However, the team had to focus on its two earlier games, both away, at Oneonta and Vassar. A major concern for the Dutchwornen at the beginning of the week was the fact that the St. Lawrence game would be played on grass instead of the turfto which Union is. accustomed. The contests against Oneonta and Vassar were both played on grass, and taking into consideration the time spent practicing on grass at Union, the team expected to be ready for the St. Lawrence green. The team learned of another set- . ' back early in the week, when it was discovered that sophomore standout Bianca Pruroo would miss the rest of the season due to inju- ries sustained against Middlebury on October l st. Union traveled to Oneonta for the first game of the three .game road swing. Playing without for- wards Prumo and sophomore Leandra Collier, the team lost a lot of strength on the attack ~md never 1:eally got its offense flow going. Oneonta scoreo three goals against the frustrated Union team and went on to shut-out the Dutchwomen 3- 0. Looki,ng to rebound from the disarpointing loss to Oneonta, the Dutchwomen traveled to Vassar two days later on October lOth. Union opened the game strongly as senior Autumn Cohen and jun- ior Katie Gross scored two goals for the Dutch women. Late in the second half, with the game still 2- 0 in favor ofUnion\ Vassar scored on a penalty stroke. The Dutchwomen, wanting to avoid an overtime period,clamped down on defense and held on. for the 2-1 win. Gross felt that everyone played an outstanding game. \This was one of the best games we have played aH season. Everyone played 1 10% for the en.tire game,\ she said. A pumped Union team took the five hour bus trip to St. Lawrence for the final and most important game of the three game. road trip. With a win, Union would finish atop the UCAA for the-season and pla:y the last seed in the playoffs. A Joss would drop the Dutchwomen to third in the league and place St. Lawrence first. St. Lawrence and its quick passing offense,came out quickly, pushing the ball rnto the Union side of the field early in the first half: Goaltender Rachel Rothschild and the Dutchwomen defense kept Union in the game for most of the half~ However,towards.the end of. the half, the Saints scored off of a corner and took the lead 1-0.

They continued to pressure the Union defense by looking for a crack. They were able to find that crack 15 minutes into the game, as they capitalized on a defensive break- down and fired a shot past a sur- prised Union keeper.

Vassar easily cleared the ball, and entered half-time with a 1-0 advantage. · tween Sanabia and Gower, where they took a quick line out before anyone could set up to defend against them, allowed Union to quickly regain its position on Plattsburgh's side of the field. After a number of penalties by -~---------------------------~------___,! Plattsburgh, Union's Sara\ fi- Women's Rugby continued from page 20 half ended with Plattsburgh lead- ing. Union started the second half by taking advantage of the fine running and tackling of, fly half, Jen \Gower PLEASE go out to- night\ Lelas and, rookie inside center, Rachel \Barry Sanders\ Lucsik, which set them up for a penalty kick, tying the game at 8. Union continued to dominate play as the serum implemented half time adjustments to run over their opponents and the line responded by mixing up their-plays effec- tively with the kicking game . With the score deadlocked and Union looking for someone to in- ject their game with new life, Union· turned towards the tackling of Julie \don't call me a prop\ Firman.. When the Plattsburgh women decided to try an ill fated scruin run, th·ey were met by Firman, who delivered such a devastating blow that she was unable to wrap her arms around the opposing player who was sent flying backwards. The story gets interesting here, because of the history between Firman and our referee. A year ago these two met in an ugly incident in which Firman was accused of kicking the sacred yellow ball. Never for- getting this, Firman was not ea- ger to enter another confrontation with this man. In order to get her to talk to him, the referee resorted to insulting her by not recogniz- ing that she was a hooker and then threatened to remove her from the game. On the very next play, Katie Conway picked up where Firman left off, pummeling her opponent into the ground with such overwhelming force that the girl could not continue. Morti- fied by the power of Union and unable to move the ball on the ground, Plattsburgh endeavored to fight off the Union attack by kicking the ball down the field. However, a heads up play be- nally & sport I -can score in,, Gower touched the ball down for the win- ning try. Last weekend, the Union Women traveled to Binghamton where they suffered their only loss of the season. The team was missing some key players and started the game with only four- teen. However, despite being a man down and playing with four rookies, two which had never played in a game before, Union only allowed three tries in the first half. During half-time,. Union suffered the loss of.second row, Courtney Brem due to a concus- sion, but decided to try and keep playing with thirteen. Unf01tu- As they often do, the Dutch women came out in the sec- ond half looking for blood. They maintained the majority ofcontr{)! oftheballduringthe half, and their improved play paid off thirteen minutes into the half. Harris- who playecl consistently well, through- out the game, fought her way past three defenders into Vassar's I~ and lofted a perfect shot over their goalie into the far corner. The fans erupted at the turn -of events and remained constantly cheering throughout the remainder of the game. Three minutes later Ryall had a chance to take the lead, but her shot was just blocked by a div- ing keeper. Ten minutes after that Union was awarded .a free kick just outside ofVassar's 1'8. Harris took the shot, looking for her second goal, but the ball flew just high of the net. Throughout the half, Vassar was unable to mount a se- rious attack, and the teams headed to overtime. The crowd was anxious to see Union strike first, but the first 15 minute OT period produced huge defensive plays rather than offen- sive heroics. The two teams traded opportunities, but neither was able to convert. Union began the second period looking for a win. That win nearly came five minutes into the period, when senior captain Amy Powell crossed the ball from the endline, looking for a header from Ryall, who was barley unable to convert . However she wasn't going to miss twice. A minute later, Powell again crossed the ball in perfectly to Ryall who headed the ball to the lower far post for the go-ahead goal and the explosive applause from the crowd. Union was able to hold Vassar scoreless for tile remaining nine minutes and walked away with a well earned 2-1 victory. The soccer team is looking to extend its win streak on Friday (4:00) and Saturday (1 1:00) at home against Clarkson and St. Lawrence, respectively. Both games are much needed league wins for the Dutchwomen, and support from fans is greatly appre- ciated. nately, the final nail in Union's coffin was hammered in when they lost another girl to injury. Citing the well-being of their players, the Union captains in- formed the referee of theit.deci- sion to forfeit the game. The Binghamton women, displaying a shocking lack of sportsmanship, declared that they would not ac~ cept the forfeit, indicating that they wanted to score as many points as possible to put them ahead in the points scored cat- egory in the league. However, the referee ruled that they had no choice but to accept the forfeit, and with that Union congratulated the other team and walked off of the field. Although this loss may prevent Union from going to the state toumament this year, I've never been more proud of my team for the determination and will to win that they exhibited on that day.

Under a bright yeHew sun, a vivid green lawn, and the usual neon Schenectady skies, Union College's Men's Rugby Team took the pitch for a much-antici- pated matchup ag;;~inst perennial division bad-boys Plattsburgh. Union was well-prepared for a battle of monumental propor- tions: faces were painted, swords were sharpened, and guttural grunts were uttered frequently. Unfortunately for Union, the one thing they had forgotten to fine- tune was their rugby game. While the Smokin' Dutchmen screamed such Braveheart-esque comments as \All men die, some men die re- ally hungover\ and \You bled with Buddha, now bleed with me\ the Plattsburgh Cardinals displayed an impressive combi- nation of size, speed, and skill, and a notable lack of the thuggery that Union was expecting from them. In fact, once the referee unkindly informed ~ur brave home team that broadswords would not be allowed on the pitch, the Dutchmen were notice- ably disappointed, and congre- gated in an impromptu group- as a cynical Plattsburgll!llptured. • ~......-;-~~--~~---­ . therapy session on the sidelines, while Plattsburgh rolled to a se- ries of scores. Notable fortitude was displayed by Union's rook- ies, who were pressed into what officers Pike ~'Not releasing\ , Mody and Matt \Not tackling\ Lux termed a \Pyrrhic defeat\ (same meaning as a Pyrrhic vic- tory, except without the victory). Meanwhile, Alex \Future Full- back\ Douville was crafting a, well, crafty s_trategy which in- volved using the superhuman strengths of Eric \Supersquanto\ Mike Gill bresks away from a Plattsburgh defender's h~ld. (photo by Laurel Ruma!TC) Smith to overwhelm the Cardi- nals defense. Unfortunately, this strategy was intercepted by a group of politicians, subjected to a series of reviews, then overbudgeted, underbudgeted, debated, filibustered, and finally approved four hours after the· gatpe ended. Thus, Union had to face an extremely daunting defi- cit at halftime. Finally, Union remembered that It was in a rugby game, and started to hold its own. Tackling improved noticeably, and some small amounts of of- fense were even generated~ Chris \How are my shorts, sweetie?\ Weiler actually engulfed a Car- dinal rugger through complex ph- agocytosis, Matt \The Wrap\ Scheller provided admiral>le de- fense from wing, and Norm, Freddy \Compton\ G, and Jon Kaufman all endured a hitter de- feat with stout hearts and uniJent heads. However, it was ulti- mately too little too late, ami the deficit proved insurmmantable. Union's cohesion was noticeab.ly lacking both on the field, a11d on their metaphor by rc>to~tillering the Dutchmen's greetl t~umbs, 31-3. Not so for Union's ICiller B's; who reminded us all wllat fun rugby can be. Assiste(t :l>y s.ome notable help from the Re<ls con- tingent, the B-sideis had some fun with ~Plattsburgh.

The entire B-side played admirably, and pll1s()me- thing of a rainbow at theen-<l of a gloomy day for the Srnciki n' Dutchmen, who look t() rebo.:und in their season finale against Clarkson, at home, next Sa:tllrday. Thanks to- all of our dedicated fans, and the Concordy f()r t() ler- ating our anarchistic artic1es. On October 9th, the men's soc- cer team handed Utica a 4-0 loss. Despite the one sided final score, this game was a lot closer than it appears. \It was a .scary first half as we failed to score on numer- ous opportunities and initially were not able tQ put them (Utica) away,\ sai¢ Head Coach Aldo Nardiello. The Dutchmen would overcome their shaky half and t!llly for four goals in the second forty five minutes. Early in the second half, fresh- man Bryn Heatb ended the scor- . ing drought as he would take a pass from co-captain Teq Doran . and place it in the back of the net. Doran would quickly follow up the assist with a goal of his own to make the score 2-0 in favor of Union. Scoring appeared to be contagious forthe Dutchmen this afternoon. Coach Nardiello singled out sophomore Ibrahim Adamu for his excellent play .in the second half. Adamu,- who scored the third goal ofthe game, would add an assist on the fourth and final goal of the game scored by fresh- man P,.eter Paszkowski. For Paszkowski, it was the first goal of his young, but ever promising career at Union. With the team drawing its goals from mostly freshmen and SO)Jhomores, Coach Nardiello must feel relieved to think towa_rd the future progress to come. F~r the Dutchmen, the 4-0 victory enabled them to tie last year's mark for victories. With four goals, the team sur- . passed its total of ten goals .of a year ago and now stand with 13. X-C Runners Appear at Capital Distri~t Champi~nships by Jason Everett Staff Writer The men's and women's Cross- Country teams competed this past Friday at Saratoga State Park in the Capital District Cross-Country Championships. The men (4-1) raced 8,000 meters (5 miles), while the women (3-3)raced 5,000tn (3.1 miles) over the rolling hills on Union's adopted off-campus \home course.\ The meet was scoted multi-duel with the tnen losing. to RPI 18 -41; defeating Saint Rose 42-19 defeat- ing Hudson Valley Community College 30-25 4:45pm last Friday, work-horse junior David Kunselman, reappeared to the ela- tion oftbe men's team. The plants were obviously realigned, but Kunselman's performance was overshadowed by sophomore sen- sation Peter Flynn, who continues to \step up\ every week. Flynn, continuing to train in the pool due to injury, ran 26:58; which was good for 3rd place in the 40-man race. Flynn was two seconds away from second place, and his perfor- mance was the fastest by a Union runner in several years. Flynn's previous best performance at Saratoga was last year in the Capi- tal District Championships, where he finished twelfth in 27:31. Coach Charlie Casey commented, \Never seen a better run from Pete ... he is getting up there ... \ Following Flynn was Kunselman in 9th place with a time of 27:24.

It has endured the test oftime and gained the respect of many members of the Union community. the Idol w:as around when the Nott was on the brink of death, before its miraculous renovation. The Idol has been painted moretimes than anything else on campus. So, where is it? Last Thursday, October 17, the Idol was moved from its former location in front of Scieace and Engineering to the space between Achilles Rink and Bailey Field. In anticipation ofthe Olin Build- ing, immediately after Convoca- tion it was decided that the\ Idol had to be moved. However, no- body knew where it woculd be moved until the Student Forum finalized the location. Several Idol locations had been pre-ap- proved by the Dean's Office. Other choices for the relocation ofthe Idol included the space be- hind the library and the lawn in front of Science and Engineering opposite the original location of the IdoL Cunanan was a strong advocate of the present Idol location. In a conversation with Dean Alford, he mentioned the \Rudy Plan.\ This concept involved using the Idol as a spiritual symbol and good luck charm for sports teams, as well as the Union College com- munity. The idea was based on the movie \Rudy\ in which th~ Notre Dame football team touches a sign before enterin,g the field as a symbol of good luck. He believes that the Idol will serve a similar purpose in its current lo• cation and hopes that it will stimu- late students of Union and possi- bly rival opponents to come and . paint the Idol.

' . • . . ... l The Student Newspaper of Union College Since 1877 Idol Makes Way For Olin Center Gender Inequality Found in Dutchmen by Jody Mousseau Staff Writer The Idol has long been a sym- bol of Union. It has endured the test of time and gained the respect of many members of the Union community. The Idol was around when the Nott was on the brink of death, before its miraculous renovation. The Idol has been painted more times than anything else on campus. So, where is it? Last Thursday, October 17, the Idol was moved from its former location in front of Science and Engineering to the space between Achilles Rink and Bailey Field. In anticipation of the Olin Build- ing, immediately after Convoca- tion it was decided that the Idol had to be moved. However, no- body knew where it would be moved until the Student Forum finalized the location. Several Idol locations had been pre-ap- proved by the Dean's Office. Other choices for the relocation of the Idol included the space be- hind the library and the lawn in front of Science and Engineering opposite the original location of the Idol. Cunanan was a strong advocate of the present Idol location. In a conversation with Dean Alford, he mentioned the \Rudy Plan.\ This concept involved using the Idol as a spiritual symbol and good luck charm for sports teams, as well as the Union College com- munity. The idea was based on the movie \Rudy\ in which the Notre Dame football team touches a sign before entering the field as a symbol of good luck. He believes that the !Jol will serve a similar purpose in its current Io~ cation and hopes that it wi II stimu- late students of Union and possi- bly rival opponents to come and paint the Idol. The Idol relocation ceremony began at 9 PM on Thursday, Oc- tober 17. The purpose of the cer- emony, according to Student Fo- rum President Manny Cunanan, was to make the Idol a symbol of unity for the college. The event began with Alex Bartholemew performing on the traditional cer- emonial bagpipes, followed by Senior Trustee, Randall Pellish, delivering a brief speech. His opening words presented an \ode to the old spot,\ and questioned the death of the idol in a moment of silence dedicated to the remem- brance of all the hands that have touched the Idol throughout the years. Manny Cunanan, dressed in a soccer jersey, lacrosse shorts and field hockey skirt, delivered the \Rebirth of the Idol\ speech, along with Fred Olrich who pre- sented him with the original song created for the Idol. Professor Scullion read a Latin poem, and the English translation was per- formed by Jesse Schafer, who dressed in traditional toga attire.

Fortunately, in one instance the staff member had locked her purse in a file cabinet which prevented the crime from escalating. These thieves will walk the halls of buildings looking for unoccupied rooms. Once they see an opportunity they enter the room and check under desks and in desk drawers for pocketbooks and wallets. Most often they are looking for cash ... however, if time is limited they will take the pocketbook or wallet and search it for cash after they leave the buildingthen discard the pocketbook or wallet. If these thieves are confronted in an office space they usually excuse their presence by stating that they are looking for a fictitious personin another building and they got lost. Please call Campus Safety X-6911 if you encounter any suspicious circumstance. ' e t I \ i F v a t t n \ v h s c

Math and Physics: by Kara Christian Staff Writer As part of the new engineering curriculum, Pr·ofesso.rs Julius Barbanel and Karl Zimmermann from th.e Mathematics department and Prefessor Gary Reich from the Physics depal'tltlent have de- signed a new course for tirst•year engineering students. The course, Integrated Math/Physics (IMP), combines material previously taught in Math 13 and 15 and Physics 17. IMP will be taugh.t over a tW() term period and will be credited as 1.5 classes each term. Thiis fall, Professor Barbanel and Professor Reich have collaborated in teaching the course~ Winter term,. Professor Zimmermann wHI take over the Mathematics section.· . Traditionally, Mathematics and Physics are taught independently. Correspondingly, students often struggle to relate the two subjects. Dean Kenyon of the Engineering Department· explains •that '\stu- dents have difficulty itftransfer- ring mathematical skllls to the challenges of physics and often wonder how their particular study in mathematics and physics re- lates to the engineeriAg disci pi ine of their choosing.\ IMP is de- signed to link mathematics and physics. Barbanel explains: \I think there is 'a problem with the tradi- tional approach. People· tend to think of Math; and 'Phys'rcs as separate entities. Math arid Phys- ics courses have created a false separation. ·calculus- was in- vented by Isaac Newton to ex- plain the motion of planets ... \ The Power of One· Reich adds that on a more practi- cal level, much ·of what is taught in a Calculus course overlaps what is taught ia an introductory Physics course. Calculus and Physics have a ·strong historical link.. Each subject motivates the other. lMP enfor~es the .strong o-verlap between the two'. Barbanel claims., \The goal is ttwt students will see more connec- tion.'' IMP is taught in a classroom designed especially for the course. Located in the Science and Engineering Building, the classroom allows for a variety of different teaching styles. The classroom holds functional hex- agonal work tables, 9 computers, a movable projection co.nso.Je with a computerand VCR; a ceil- ing mounted screen, equipment used for physics experiments and a variety of software. The pro- fessors explain that the room was designed for ··''seamless transi- tion/', Stul!lents ·can comfortably I isten to lectures, .perform labs or work at the computers without leaving a given work station. The instructor's table is mobile. Barbanel, Reich and Zimmermann visited a number of colleges and universities, such as Skidmore and RPI, to exp\Iore op- portunities fortheclassroom. The lMP classroom is the fir:st of its . kind oil the Union campus. The professors wanted.to achieve an environment that-would accom- modate '\studio style\ teaching with the latest-technology and software. Software available -in the IMP classroom includes Ex- cel, Mathematica, Science Work- shop~ Calculus Connections, and Interactive Phy,sic~. Students hav:e regular access to the facil- ity. This experimental cours.eand classroom are models forthe fa- cilities a_nd courses that will be offered at the Olin Center. The funding- for the design of the elassroom was .provided by Presi- der.Jt Hull and Dean Cool.. Pro- fessor. R€ich acknowle.dges, '~Dean Keny-on worked .hard .to make out classroom a ~.:eality. \· Cur:r~ently, ther~ are 18 first- year engineering .students en- roUed\in the course. Fl:eshntan Maura. Culloo explains that be- cause Calculus was designed to study ?_hysics, students get a bet- ter overa-ll understanding when they affi~·studied together. Culloo has especially enjoyed the equip- ment used in labs. \With the .motion detector,. we.are able. to study. a.;.tual motion and reali.stic graphs instead .of ,tfu~Qreticai, .ide.~L <!me.s-\\, Cull<~o: saysH\The course is gr-eat. .This •is •the way the two subjects should be taught.\ Another student, Saif Madar comments that the professors work well together. \They teach \ sepafately,.butthe material is al- ways connected ... For example, ifProfessor Barbanel is teaching derivative.s; Professor Reich will teaqh us :how to apply derivatives in.,Physic~\'probl~ms;\ . , Madar admits he was nerv.ous about the course,but feels the subjects are best: taught together. ...

Table 4 addresses the recruit- · ing expenditure .numbers but is · said to be out.ofline because more male student athletes are recruited than women. Men's teams spend $38,375 recruiting and women's . teams spend $10,950. \We do· spend more ruoney on men's ice . hockey,\ Saka'la said, \due to the greater geographic recruitingnec .. essary fwrn · the West and Canada.\ He. added that the re- cent figuresput Union at the hot- tom of the ECAC Division I Hockey League. Sakal.a added that according to Title IX there is nothing that says or suggests spending equal amounts of money on males and femalesonthewhole. They must, ttowever spend equal amounts on individu~ls for meals and related travel expenses. Table 6repotts the average an- nual institutional salary of the head coaches of the men's and women's teams. The number of head coaches included in the sur- vt;y was ten for both the men and for the wome~·. The average sal- ary for men's teams head coaches was $23,698 and the women's bead coach average was $14,865. . The extreme differences are based ·on the tenure .Qf staffand·the fact that$Offie programs have Salaries bas.ed ·on the sport as-Signmeht. SakaJa said, \In the hockey Divi- si~n I, salaries must be within the range.oftheECAC league.\ He also said that the gender equity committee will review the num .. ber of staff for women's sports, hopefully affecting the salaries. Table 8 reports the overall rev .. enues and expens,es gt;nerated by all ttien's 'itnd women·~ teams. Under the specific category of\all other men's ~ports,\ $.1 0 f ,218 goes directly to rnen' s ice hockey because the team generates the largest dollar amount on the 'ac- count that people pay to see a game. \After thoroughly reading the Equity Act for Union College, Chris Leone, Concordiensis Sports Editor said, \It would be inter~sting to know where the $81,400 that is unallocated to men or women goes.\ He also said, \Many of the discrepancies be· tween the sexes seem to come,. and rightfully so, from the ice . hockey program.'' The Equity in Athletics Disclo .. sure Act is available to all stu .. dents, prospective students, and the public. '\It's shortcomings will be our main goal,\ said: Sakata, \and to enhance women's . programs will be the focal point.\ Sakala is looking forward to ·. meeting with the gender equity · committee and their recommen .. dations. Though Union Collegehasonly funded female vatsity sports since · 1975, they have taken great steps. in that short time. However, mon .. · etary equality has yet to be reached, · and efforts from the atheletic de- partment will be continued. -\ by Anjali BalaSingham Staff Writer A perennial favorite topic of discussion at Union ·is hazing. This issue was addressed at the year's second Crosstalk debate, held at Chet' s on Wednesday, October 17, at 6:30p.m. Speci.fi- cally, the debate centered arot.md whether or not Greek organiza~ tions are scapegoats for hazing charges. Panel members were Steve Potenza, Heather Kanser, Bran- don Declet, and Rob Cohen. Elizabeth Malaspina, Vice Presi- dent of Academics, acted as mod .. erator. A major theme of the debate was the ambiguity ofthe current definition of hazing. All panel- ists agreed that there is a need for C1 clearer dtl-finition, but no one seemed to be able to provide one. Cohen pointed· out that Union mentians Greek organizations several times in its definition and overlooks other potential_perpe- trators (i.e. sports teams} \That's the mindset ofthis campus,-that everyone who -hazes [belongs to] a fratem ity or a sorority,\ he con- tinued. Kanser agreed,. an<;l said that the definitioiJ of\b~ihg pres- sured to. <lo !;omething one doesn. 't want to do\ could include prowrbial examples of peer pres- sure and Mtjust hazing. Potenz:a, however, claimed that \ ... there is a differen.ce between somebody outside of the Greek system co- ercing [students],. and someone with authority in the Greek sys .. tern pressuring them.\ The issue of the existing role. of the administration in regulat .. ing Greeks was· actively debated. ftotem~aclaimedthat there is cur .. rently a trend in the direction of cracking dow11 on not on Jy Greeks,. but also on all candidates for offense, such as freshmen dorms. \I don't t!link that there's any malicious intent towards fra- terni,ties. It's just not in the school's best interest to have this kind of thing come up.\ Declet echoed this statement, but Cohen objected, claiming that \ ... the ad- mini.stration is out to g.et the Greek system. They have a lot of insurance risks with Greek orga .. :niz:ations, and they're using haz- ing_ as an excuse to get rid of them.\ Kanser agreed wit:h Cohen. Claiming that Union has decided to become mo-re aca- ciemic within the past few years, she suggested that the adminis .. tration is now seizing the oppor- tunity to get rid of the social part of the .school, namely fraterni- ties and sororities. \When the occasion arises, [the administra- tion] is taking advantage of it,\ Kanser said. The feasibility of solving the problem of hazing surfaced as well. Malaspina brought up the point that, in many cas~s, the administration is unaware of hazing -offenses. She then asked whether or not the administra- tionsho_uld make routine checks of Greek houses. Declet re- sponded negatively in saying that \ ... the admin.istration shouldn't be acti-vely searching these things out.\ Malaspina then asked how it would be pos- sible to prosecute offenders if the administration didn't know ofthe offense. Cohen replied, \I don't think there's any way in which the administration can police you. The responsibility for [reporting hazing] falls on the accusecl.\. This idea of individual re ... sponsibility in a hazing ~ituation was the· source ofsorne disagree- ment. Kanser claimed that stu- dents all have the. capability to avoid being hazed. \lfyou feel pre.s.sured,., she said, \you should have enough courage to get up and say no.\ Potenza; however, pointed out that \ ... some people are not that strong-willed. Those are the people for whom these laws are written.'~ The object of much discus- sion, which was, however, no- ticeably absent from the. panel, was the administration itself. A popular sentiment on the floor was that nothing would be done about the status quo unless the administration were included in the debate. Malaspina pointed out that the Student Conduct Committee is presently chang- ing the guidelines regarding haz- ing as given in the Student Handbook.

In answer to last week's articleWentitled, ''Pig Power Trip,\ I would like to be- gin ,bysayingthat I was disgusted and amazed that anyone with such a low maturity level would even attend Union College. It seems that the person on the power trip was the author, not the . RA in question. He states, ''Ev- erybody knows Vin Rock. Even this p.ig ... knew who I was when she wrote me up ... \ ;so what, just because the RA knew who you were, does that mean she l?hould give you special privledges? It seetns that your definition of the abuse of power is actually carry- ing out one's duties because you actuaiJy broke real rules by \smok· ing astoge\ and making no is~. An abuse of power would be the RA pulling your natne out of a hat and then writing you up for something you did not do .. The key phrase is \something you did not do ..... \ Further, we are taught from an early age to respect our authority figures, not necessarily to agree wi:tll them. Realistically, yes, some people do not know how to handle authority when posessing it, but 1 think its wrong to general- ize that with one bad experience, e'\leryorte else in that position is the same way. It's one thing to be a,.ngry with the RA who wrote you up or the police officers in your neighborhood but it is another thi11g to generaliiethat, \like all police officers are pigs,. likewise, all R.A. 's are pigs.'; I think Vinnie was on the right track · when he stated, \ ... when people are given authority, they just don't know how to act\ however it seems more li;ke when people are given a voice, like in the OP/ · ED section, sometimes the need · to be heard outweighs tile. ratio- nale behind the arguments. .

T)lis lett~t is in. r~s.ponse t!Jlast week;s artlc.le entitl\!d \Rush: Headed in the Wrong Direc- tion?\ In my opinion, the indi- vidual who wrote that article, is headed in the wrong direction. The author of the article was wondering where the administra~ tion, the IFC and the Pan Hellenic Council are headed: in planning rush. The author further asked, \why the greeks are moving rush . earlier into the academic year as ·opposed to pushing it back\. To answer your question, the IFC is not moving rush forward, and will begin as planned the sec- ond week of Winter Term. As for the sororities, they had planned an informal brunch and by no means was it their starting point of rush. People in the past· have complained that sorority rush is a four day fashion con- test and as a result, Pan Hel has taken positive steps. to make so- rority rush more informal. The proposed brunch was one such positive event to give freshman more tirne to \explore\ whether sorority life is for them or not. This kind ofaction should be ap- plauded instead of criticized. I acknowledge the many merits of a delayed rush system, yet I won- der liow much research the au~ thor has done on the subje\ct. The article in que~tion fai'ls to men- tiqwth~ n\l~\erP l!§~o- .: :carrie~ wit~ ~t Pl~l1¥'-rew~~p,s .Hke . datv,o w,i1hS.il<ft\ a syst~.m. . , ·~~ ,: qi$qiplip~~ ,a s~ns~ -9f ~ploqgin~. ,The first p~essing problem the an,d. a .. kiok-:ass unbeaten, rycord.

But and seniors would be able to live maybe we should tell the Fresh- in Greek houses. Seniors who man members of the football team have traditionally chosen to live off campus their senior year would now be required to live in their houses without exception. Another problem with sophomore rush Wotlld be the effect on term abroad applications. With pres- sures to fill Greek housing, term abroad applications would de- crease as dedicat.ed members of a greek house, would not choose to go tetm abroad if it meant not fiH- ing their houses, thus jeopardiz- ing future housing privileges. By far my biggest problem with notion- ofsophomore rush. is the lack of faith it would show in the student body and especially the Freshman class to make informed decisions, and in the end, do the right thing. Freshman who play varsity sports (such as soccer, field hockey, and ice hockey) spend coun1less hours In practice and games. To draw a specific analogy, football. like pledging a fraternity or sorority, is a huge commitment; with many .sacri- fices like early morning practices and long roa9 trips. Yet is also and all the other sports teams: \I'm sorry, but we don'tthink you can handle your academic workload and the time commit- ment of a sport your freshman year\. In the end, it all comes down to two basic questions: Who should choose the path for stu- dent~ here a.t Union? and l,llti- mately, who is control? I have faith in the Freshman class to tnake informed decisions as to whether Gree\e.life is for them. Come Winter term, if an indi- vidual feels he or she is not ready to rush or pledge, then I would urge them to take a year offand explore the other options Union Co'llege has to offer. But I urge the author and other proponents of \sophomore rush\ to stop as- suming the Freshman Class is immature~ whefl_ in point of fact, this is not only false, but insult- ing. Freshman class: the choice is yours. Sincerely, Ben Fox IFC President ' .I

The most militant strikers were doctors opposed to tile cutting of prescriptions and treatment costs. Ukraine- Washington is concerned with the nevw i\aling class, the Dnepropetrovsk clan, in Ukraine. The government owes back wages an~ benefits to many of the professional dasses that has been given to the government itl the form of foreign aid. The Ukraine is c11rrently fhe third largest recipient of American forEign aid, and the money is not find- ing its way to the working classes.

The possibility of Lebed willrting exists, al- though it will not be easy to hold on to his political support between now and the next eJections. · The ironic situation that has arisen in the dismissal of General Lebed from his post as national security advisor is the similarity with how Yeltsin rose to power. In1988, Yeltsinwas banned from the Commu- nist Party by Gorbachev. Not long after, Gorbachev resigned fr()m office as the last President of the USSR, in December of 1991. Fol- lowing his assumption of power, Yeltsin struck a de- cree that outlawed the Communist Party a few months prior to the official 57% Denmark ' 57% resolution the USSR There- fore, it is entirely possible for Lebed to use his dismissal to gain political support throughout Russia. Many will probably view the fact that Lebed was forced from his position in a positive way, thus contributing to his fu- hue success. Many issues arise from what has happened. The most pressing is the current state of affairs in the Russian Government. It has become increasingly clear that Yeltsin's effectiveness as a lea~er no longer exists. Be- sides the obvious fact that his physical health is a major det-. riment, he exhibits no clear and rational reasoning for his actions. For example, Lebed was able to uphold a cam- paign promise that Yeltsin made in running for another term as president, in terms of the happenings in Chechnya. Yeltsin continually empha- sized that negotiations would be held between Rus- sia and Chechnya to try and reach a ceasefire and an agreement on the future of the region. Once Yeltsin made it obvious that he was not going to enforce such a promise, Lebed 'was able to bring the fighting to a halt. One can only speculate what will happen without Lebed serving as a liaison between the two .governments. Yeltsin' s irrational actions are also indicative that he is try- ing to hold a power that he can no longer figure out what to do with. It will interesting to see what happens in terms of the current:· President's health and how the Russian people choose to react to the dismissal of Lebed. The situ- ati.on in Chechnya should also be of considerable concern in the future.

Political Opinions Clinton: About that Character Iss;ue ... by Erika Mancini Staff Writer I am terribly sorry if you are sick and tired of hearing about Bill Clinton's character, or lack thereof, but I simply have to take this opportunity to put my two sense in before it is too late. It outrages me when I hear people say things like, \So what.. the man smoked a little marijuana when he was young - everybody did it]\ or \Who cares if he's a womanizer. That doesn't affect how he runs the country\ or \Whitewater? What the heck is that anyways? Oh well, must not be too impor- tant.\ While some of us recognize these as the highly disturbing truths that they are, there are others, who because they are just so cool and blase, won't even flinch at such red flags. Marijuana was then and is now illegal, and he tried it! Is it not illegal to cheat on your wife? To sexually harrass women? The whole country was stopped in its its tracks when Anita Hill accused Clarence Thomas of s~xual han·assment. Today, by contrast, there is little shock from the accusations against Clinton. People say, so what if the president's closet is jam-packed with skeletons. (The list has be- come quite extensive these days. His aids recently had to prepare explanations to 39 pos- sible scandals that they feared the press would hound Clinton about. So far, Clinton and his people are letting out a huge sigh of reI ief as few have dared to ask questions regarding his character.) But anyway, he can still be an effective leader. His personal life doesn't influence his presidency. Yeah ... he can be an effective leader, all right. Effectively, he has managed to send the message to AmericaN youths tnat, yes, you can use drugs, you can b~ dishonest, and disrespectful to women -. you can do whatever you want, and you won't get caught. IN fact, you might even become the president some day! Isn't it odd that during Bill Clinton's presidency, drug use among kids has skyrocketed? Can his supporters truly deny that there is no connection whatsoever between the ex- ample set by the president and the increasing amount of young drug addicts? Just that this part of his past is common knowl- edge among kids has to have a negative impact on them and their choices. Do you know what else re- ally gets my blood boiling? (Sorry 'bout all these ques- tions.) The fact that nobody really understands Whitewater. Every time Peter Jennings, or whoever the stuffed shirt is, an- chors a segment on Whitewater, they always conveniently talk about it in such complicated manners. I'm smart, at least I'm here at Union trying to become smart, but I just haven't been able to make heads nor tails of what Whitewater actually is - that is, until I recieved some nice, clear and simple literature on the matter. Let me tell you, it's a messy scandal involv'fng illeg&l tax deductions on the part of the Clinton's, the shredding of documents leading to the death 9f Vince Foster, but it would haye to.be an entire other articfe. If you were paying attention up there you heard that the Clintons deducted taxes ille- gally (that was in 1984-85). Did you hear that??? Illegal tax de- ductions!!! Oh yes, these are people who love and respect their country. These are people who can be trusted. I don'teventhink that Hi\lary and Bill can trust each other. After he became president in 1992, Arkansas state troopers came forvvard giving accounts of how Clinton as governor regularly used security officers to set up, shall we say, liaisons with anumberofwomen. They say that he usually had several ongoiNg affairs simultaneously. One trooper claimed that Clinton and he \graded\ women they saw on a scale from one- to-ten. Obviously, it is a difficult thing to have to make the call when the President of the United States is the offender. It is shameful when our com- mahder-in-chief has behaved like a frequenter of Hooters. (1 weep for those now spouting, \What's wrong with Hooters?\) Nob()dy wants to have to say this stuff. I even wonder if it's better for the public to be igno- rant of their leader's corruption. But those days are over. Go to the new release section in any bookstore. There is book after book after book on Clinton's character and his shenanigans. No other president has had this much garbage trailing behind him. Remember, the rest of the world is reading these books, too. l wonder what they think about Clinton and his scandals. We snicker atBorisYelstinand his drinking problem. How much. must they laugh? Yikes. What About th·e Other Ones? by Jody Mousseau Staff Writer With the elections approach- ing, the politically concerned electorate will decide on their choice of who will sit on the throne of the free world. You sit and weigh the options. Dole? Clinton? Dole or Clinton? What about the other ones? The third party ghost has been lingering over the Ameri- can political system since the first draft of the Constitution. Different variations of indepen- dent parties have emerged throughout the past elections, and the variations come and go. Not an election goes by with- out the elephants and asses be- ing challenged by a spunky, energetic, yet under grown, bulldog. By no means is the 1996 Presidential election different than any other race has ever been. Most people will decide whether to vote for Clinton or Dole, if they even make it to the polls. Few will consider the tP.ird party option, unless they ·are one of the few dedi- cated members within the group. Most of the electorate is not even aware of their third party options. In addition to the normal entrees of Republi- can and Democratic candidates, a smorgasbord of choices will be served, depending on whether you prefer bitter or sweet, salt or sugar. The menu will include Ross Perot, of the Reform Party, John Hagelin of the Natural Law Party, Harry Browne for the Libertarian Party, Ralph Nader for the Green Party, Mary Cal Hollis of the Socialist Party, Howard Phillips of the U.S. Taxpayers Party, and Charles Collins of the Independent Party. Though their efforts cannot be ignored, few third party can- didates have been successful. Much of their lack of success (notice that the word failure was not appropriate) is due to pub- lic skepticism. \Why should I vote for them if they won't win anyway?'; Most third parties do not make it onto the ballot in every state. Presently, Perot is the only third party candidate who will be able to compete from state A to z, and every- where in between. Regardless of the stakes, some third party candidates have made success- ful appearances in their respec- tive elections. This noteable list Third Party Politics includes George Wallace, John Anderson, and of course, Mr. Ears himself, Perot. In several instances, third parties have posed a threat to the success of the Republican and Democratic parties. Clinton's success in the 1992 presidential election can be partly attributed to Perot's candidacy, which has been be- lieved to have taken votes away from Bush. In another case, William Jennings Bryan, leader of the Populist party, was se- lected by the Democratic Party as their nominee in the 1896 presidential election when they detected a threat to their suc- cess. Thus, the death of the Populists. The media, as always, has contributed to the absence of a third party in the U.S. On the front page, you'll see a picture of ClintoN kissing a baby, or Dole revisiting nostalgic Russell, Kansas, but rarely see a picture of the socialist party candidate participating in a presidential debate. The rea- sons remain simple, and yet seem so complex and contra- dictory considering the basis on which America was founded. lt seems like a waste of time and money to promote a candi- date who has no chance of mak- , r ing a respectable appearance. Unless a billionaire spends mil- lions to air several thirty minute infomercials to present his/her platform, he/she will most likely not receive enough pub- licity to make him/her a house- hold name. This misconception is often greatly misleading. The great- est underlying, overlying, and blatant factor is that the Ameri- can political system is struc- tured to make it extremely dif- ficult for third parties to enter the horserace, both financially and in gaining publicity. Take, for instance, the FCC complaint issued in response to Ross Perot's invalidity of participa- tion in the presidential debates on the ground that he has no chance of winning. The FCC complaint stated, \The airways are owned by the public, not the two political parties.\ Perot is the leading third party candi- date for the 1996 elections, and yet he was not allowed to par- ticipate due to absurd measures which were taken by the two main parties. If the claim that Perot has no chance of winning, and thus should not be included in the debates, is true, then ac- cording to much of the public and many publications and po- ..... ·.IL. litical analysts, Dole should not have been allowed to partici- pate in the debates either. Perhaps if there is a full moon, or if you're feeling par- ticularly Green or Socialist on electi(m day, and if you vote in a state where your third party of choice actually made it onto the ballot, you may consider voting for one of the small, yet respectable third parties. The chance that the emergence of a strong third party will ever oc- cur in the United States is un- likely, but we cannot ignore the efforts. Election reforms need to be made, but whether or not reforms will freely allow third parties to participate is a whole other ball game. Choices exist. It is only a matter of the Ameri- can political system giving the ign<Jred third parties a chance. Though the throne will posi- tively go to either Clin.ton or Dole, we cannot forget about the i>ersistent third party ghost who lingers in the pre-election air.

I'm smart, at least I'm here at Union trying to become smart, but I just haven't been able to make heads nor tails of what Whitewater actually is- and Bill can trust each other. that is, until I recieved some After he became president in nice, clear and simple literature 1992, Arkansas state troopers on the matter.

But those days are over. Go to the new release section in any bookstore. There is book after book after book on Clinton's character and his shenanigans. No other president has had this much garbage 'trailing behind him. Remember, the rest of the world is reading these books, too. I wonder what they think about Clinton and his scandals. We snicker at Boris Ye!Stin.ahd his drinking problem. How much must they laugh'? Yikes. What About th·e Other Ones? by Jody Mousseau Staff Writer With the elections approach- ing, the politically concerned electorate will decide on the.ir choice of who will sit on the throne of the free world. You sit and weigh the options. Dole? Clinton? Dole or Clinton? What about the other ones? The third party ghost has been lingering over the Ameri- . can political system since the first draft of the Constitution. Different variations of indepen- dent parties have emerged thro\].ghout the past elections, and the variations come and go. Not an election goes by with- out the elephants and asses be- ing challenged by a spunky, energetic, yet under grown, bulldog. By no means is the 1 996 Presidential election different than any other race has ever been. Most people will decide whether to vote for Clinton or Dole, if they even make it to .the polls. Few will consider the t!Iird party option, unless they 'are one of the few dedi- Cated members within the group. Most of the electorate is not even aware of their third party options. In addition to the normal entrees of Republi- can and Democratic candidates, a smorgasbord of choices will be .served. depending. on whether you prefer bitter or sweet, salt or sugar. The menu will include Ross Perot, of the Reform Party, John Hagelin of the Natural Law Party, Harry Browne for the Libertarian Party, Ralph Nader for the Green Party, Mary Cal Hollis of the Socialist Party, Howard Phillips of the U.S. Taxpayers Party, and Charles Collins Of the Independent Party. Though their efforts Callilot be ignored, few third party can- didates have been successfuL Much of their lack of success (notice that the word failure was not appropriate) is due to pub\ lie skepticism. \Why should I vote for them if they won't win anyway?\ Most third parties do not make it onto the ballot in every state. Presently, Perot is the only third party candidate who will be able to compete from state A to Z, and every- where in between. Regardless of the stakes, some tiiird party candidates have made success- ful appearances in their respec- tive elections. This noteable list Third Party Politics includes George Wallace, John Anderson, and of course, Mr. Ears hirnself, Perot. In several instances, third parties have posed a threat to the success of the Republican and Democratic parties. Clinton's success in the 1992 presidential election can be partly attributed to Perot's candidacy, which has been be- lieved to have taken votes away from Bush. In another case, William Jennings Bryan, leader of the Populist party, was se- lected by the Democratic Party as their nominee in the 1896 presidential election when they detected a threat to their suc- cess. Thus, the death of the Populists. The media, as always, has contributed to the absence of a third party in the U.S. Ort the front page, you'll see a picture of Clinton kissing a baby, or Dole revisiting nostalgic Russell, Kansas, but rarely see a picture of the socialist party candidate participating in a presidential debate. The rea- sons remain simple, and yet seem so complex and contra- dictory considering the basis on which America was founded. It seems like a waste of time and money to promote a candi- date who has no chance ofmak- ing a respectable appearance. Unless a billionaire spends mil- lions to air several thirty minute infomercials to present histher platform, he/she will most likely not receive enough pub- licity to make him/her a house- hold name. This misconception is often greatly misleading. The great- est underlying, overlying, and blatant factor is that the Ameri- can political system is struc- tured to make it extremely dif- ficult for third parties to enter the horserace, both financially and in gaining publicity. Take, for instance, the FCC complaint issued in response to Ross Perot's invalidity of participa- tion in the presidential debates on the ground that he has no chance of winning. The FCC complaint stated, \The airways are owned by the public, not the two political parties.\ Perot is the leading third party candi- date for the 1996 elections, and yet he was not allowed to par- ticipate due to absurd measures which were taken by the two main parties. If the claim that Perot has no chance of winning, and thus should not be included in the debates, is true, then ac- cording to much of the public and many publications and po- ··~·~· :.,., .. litical analysts, Dole should not have been allowed to partici- pate in the debates either. Perhaps if there is a full moon, or if you're feeling par- ticularly Green or Socialist on election day, and if you vote in a state where your third party of choice actually made it onto the ballot, you may consider voting for one of the small, yet respectable third parties. The chance that the emergence of a strong third party will ever oc- cur in the United States is un- likely, but we cannot ignore the efforts. Election reforms need to be made, but whether or not reforms will freely allow third parties to participate is a whole other ballgame. Choices exist. It is only a matter of the Ameri- can political system giving the ignored third parties a chance. Though the throne will posi- tively go to either Clinton or Dole, we cannot forget about the persistent third party ghost who lingers in the pre-election air.

Picture.\' Rating * * f /:? (out of fow:l This week's film. to be released with the tag line of\from the con- troversial bestseller\ is Slceper.s, a ·Coming-of-age story featuring pre-adolescents from the city (New York's Hell's Kitchen) who commit a crime, are unfairly pun- ished, and feel the need to bond tqgether and challenge the cor- rupt for\:e which robhed them of their youth at so precious an age. The story, based on LortnLo C t • \ I\ area erra s persona account of these events which surrounded his childhood, is one-sided; the ( 1ther three men could not part ic i- pate in helping shape the story for reasons disclosed at the c11J of the film. The movie boasts an incredible list of supporting ac- tors, from De N iro down to lloffrnan. This must have been a costly project, considering t:hc talent hired. Fortunately, all of -them arc game. Lorenzo, John, Tommy, and Michael are the four street-wise youths wlw play what they con- sidtT to be an innocent prank on a hot summer's day. The pack wants to steal some hot dogs - too bad they never heard of the adage \ihere's no such rhing as a free lunch.'' The hot dog vend- ing cart they steal winds up down a flight of subway stairs, injuring a passer-by. The court sentences the boys to a year in an upstate rdorm school, the Wilkinson I lome for Boys. By this time, we' rc already half- way through the movie, yet there's so much more to tackk. The film is obviously shooting for cpic status, but it ends up being just a little extra long. At there- form school, tht: boys fall under the watch of a sadistic and s.:xu- ally-abusiveguard named Noakes, played by Bacon with the same kind of emerging versatility he dis- played in Alurder in the First. After a year of bad prison food, rough football games, and Carcaterra's appreciation of the novels of /\lexander Dumas, the boys get out of schooL All this occurs in the I 960s. Now flash to New York, 1981. John and Tommy, now local thugs with multiple homicides under their belts, enter a bar and meet an aging Noakes enjoying his din- ner. They pull up a chair at his table and play the popular Parker Br.others board game, \Payback Time,\with him. Now, thetwotum to their childhood friends, whose \friendships run deeper than blood,\ to get them out of their dilemma. The film glosses over the im- pact of friendship on these boys' I i ves -- the strong bond that binds them is never felt, even if there is not enough time to do more than suggest a lifelong bond. This is an important point because when Pitt,. as the grown-up Michael, devises a scheme to free his friends, one is hard-pressed to understand how an Assistant District Attorney would risk his reputation and career for a pair of losers. Michael's scheme: pros- ecute John and Tommy for the murder of Noakes and assist the defense in winning the case.

De Niro plays a street-smart priest from llell's Kitchen who protects the boys througl1uut their lives, even when the .pivotal courtroom scene com~s intoplay. He is a chain-smoJ...ing, foul- mouthed character wlm reminds everyone of Robert De Niroplay- ing a priest. By now, the infamous thespian has become more of an image than an actor. Hoffman steals the scenes he's in (as usual) with the subtlycomical portrayal of a clueless and burned,up at- torney who needs time to com- plete a thought and read from the prepared questions provided by the prosecution. There is a lot to take in w.ith this film, and perhaps a longer running time :would have helped. There are too many glazed-over details to make this thewinning bk1pic it so desperately wants to be. The boys' bond is just not strong enough to hold. As the only woman in the picture, Driver plays a friend ofthe group, and yet it is later revealed that all the boys wanted her at some point or an- other. The scene~ in the prison arc short, and director Levinson contrasts the screams ofthe boys being sexuaHy~abused deep in the dungeons of the school's base- ment with pleasant chi·ldhood memories of... playing witha fire hydrant? When you catch brief glimpses of the boys' home life {Lorenzo's father, played by Kirby, is seen as a wi fe-beatcr), you can appreciate wh.y family isn't con- sidered under \pleasant child- hood memories.\ Still, the emo- tional scarring, from .reform school (and Noakes i.n particubr) never comes through. The handsome production de- sign captureli(bowcverrcpCLitive this has become) the feel for New York neighborhoods ofthe 1960s. This isanotherexarnple of the ex- ·Citementfilmdirectors find in tell- ing stories ofgrowing up in crirm:- riddcn, impoveri·shed neighbor- hoods. Levir1son sprinkles his movie's progression with stan- dard nods to the local Don and the power of .inner-city friend- ships. The perfect childhood gang, neve.rtheless, looks strangely odd together when they grow up. Pitt and Patrie (as Lorenzohimself) are mismatched in adulthood with their friends, a pair ofkillers. As with a11y decades-spanning laic, the fi-lm is full ofmusic from the different eras.

Consid- ered very innovative when it de- buted in the 1970s, Equus por- trays the madness of a seemingly nonnal boy, Alan Strang, who for no ap- obvi- ous in the begin- ning of the play, not only because of the title, but for what it begins to symbolize for Alan. Almost re- ligious gods for Alan, t'he horses are parent reason blinds S i X horses at a stable where \It is (:I very abstract, unusual play that has a filtnic quality, and it is probably different from what [students] have seen before. \ just a s im- per- tant chr- ac- -Helena Binder, director he works. The challenge of the play, how- ever, is not Alan's madness. Ev· eryone recognizes Alan's malady; what is intriguing is the madness that haunts the \sane\ human being, a modem illness that has become commonplace and so- cially acceptable. This prosaic madness is personified in the doc- tor that treats Alan, Martin Dysart, played by Ari Gottlieb '99. The play begins with Alan's acquittal to an insane hospital in- stead of life in prison due to the efforts of a compassionate En- glish Magistrate, Hester, played by Raquel Millman '99. Alan's seemingly inexplicable act begins to unravel in the stories of his past. Whether he is a product of his upbringing - that of a socialist father, Frank Strang (played by James Naumes '98), and an overly zealous Christian mother, Dora Strang, (played by Jessica Bernstein '97)- or his own evil is questionable and left for the audience to determine. At first, Alan is angry at the doctor and chooses not to speak, but he slowly begins to confide in him and recollects how his pas- sion for horses began. He recalls the first time he rode - the result of a horseman he met on a beach, played by Rawson Thurber '97, who innocently offered him the chance to ride his horse. In fear of his well-being, Alan's parents force him to dismount the horse and end his mesmerizing ex peri· ence. The significance of the horse is ters in the play as the people. The roles of the horses are played by Mike Yusko '97, Rawson Thurber '97, Sunil Schneider '98, Carrey Miller '98, Peter St. John '99, and Gregory Von Holt '99. Just as the horse becomes a sacred symbol; so too does the stable where Alan later gets a job. He is introduced to Mr. Dal.ton, the stable owner (played by Mor- gan Hargrove '97), by a girl named Jill Mason (played by Hillary Gallay '97), and starts to become increasingly disillusioned and ob- sessed. Alan's anger is evident by his cru- elty to anyone who tries to help him, such as Dysart and the Nurse, played by Allison Evans '97. Dysart, who is initially de- sensitized to Alan's wrath, be- comes intrigued by his passion for horses because of his own per- sonal feelings of deficiency. The focus of the \madman\ is shifted to Dysart and his search for mean- ing in his own life. The stereo- typic de.finition of madness rep- resented by Alan is challenged as Dysart becomes the man with the illness· and Alan's equivocal act is demystified. The cast is a comfortable size of 17, which has allowed the ac-. tors both the intimacy of a smaller cast and the opportunity to un- derstand the subtle dynamics that make Equus a captivating piece of drama. Emilia Teasdale '97, the assistant director, said, \The cast has come a long way and has worked hard to make Equus a suc- cess.\ The play is directed by Helena Binder '76, a guest artist. Binder was one of the first two theater majors at Union College and re- members what she learned from Professor Barry Smith as a stu- dent. ln addition to her 18 years as an actress. she has worked at the Glimmer Glass Opera, Leather Stocking Theater, and The Schenectady Light Opera Com- pany. Equus is not the first play that Binder has worked on at Union. Previously she has di- rected Ten Little Indians and has choreographed Do Black Patent Leather Shoes Really Reflect Up. Binder says that her biggest challenge directing Equus was in \making it palatableto a 90's style audience.\ She recognizes the dif- ficulty of the play and regards it as a learning process that is con- stant. \There are themes in the play that students have only just begun to understand through PhotfJS by Michelle NeiUI1C working with students.

tr:lrr <C~.ntrtwOiC'nsiz . October 24, 1996 Page 16 · · Features You're Interested in Living Where? by Peter Sorensen Features Editor Word has gotten around to me that some people who read my column think I take too many drugs. I have two things to say about this: reality can be tedious, and Disney's Fantasia was (and still is) a great work of art. Per- haps I should add that my views on drug use are heavi~y inspired by Nancy Reagan, although I sometimes say \yes\ to Nyquil. Anyway, I actually have some- thing to say this week. It is some- what of a vision; it has been real- ized at other schools. It has to do with campus living ... Before I ever visited a college, I had the idea that I would live in a house where Spanish was the language of choice. People in this house might have been Hispanic, they might not have, but they all shared a common interest in the language, and in their own mas- tery of it. I imagined house din- ners with Spanish food and pro- fessors dropping by justto hang- out and chat. Otherwise, it was a normal college residence, by the standards ofwhat I know now. Well, if I can imagine a Span- ish house, why not others? What ·ifthere were also a \greenpeace\ house and a french house and an outdoor interest house or e.ven a young Republicans house? What if indeed? What could houses like these offer to a college like ours? I suspect they could do just about anything 20 or so motivated kids with the same interests are ca~ pable of, which is quite a lot. Not that Union's clubs and special in- terest groups can't accomplish the same, but imagine not ha.ving to cram everything into an hour- long meet·ing once a week, be- The Right Choice, Friends by Jeff Druzba Staff Writer was thinking the other day ... Sure, there was a time when I wanted to be an engineer. Of course, I was somewhere around twelve years old at the time. Union may have been just right for me back then. It started with civil engineering. This was the time of my big popsfcle stick ex- perimental phase. I had this dream ofbuilding a model house out of popsicle sticks and toothpicks. I even attempted to bui1d the stairs once with Elmer's glue. The sticks didn't cooperate too well though, and I gave up for the day and for- ever. My dreams shifted focus toward making a model of one of those bridges that you see in the Indiana Jones movies, crossing a big canyon ... all out oftoothpicks and string. As one would expect, that didn't pan out either, and I went on to the electrical and me- chanical engineering phase. I used to save parts from broken electrical stuff in hopes that I would build some creation. All I ever seemed to do was take a bat- tery and attach it to a little motor. A kid on the bus broke his Walkman one time, and I begged him for the parts. The big prizes were the little motor .and the red LED. That was a weird age. I guess I'm lucky that 1 outgrew the whole thing before I turned it into a career. That would definitely have been a mistake. From then on, I had a 7-year delusion of joining the medical profession. It seemed natural enough. The sight of blood and entrails doesn't really bother me too much, unless it's my own. In fact, I had delighted for years in shooting rubber bands at house- flies and turning them into red spots, and Trapper John M.D. was a cool show in the reruns. It looked like it would be fun. Yeah, ·I was going to be a doctor some- day. The whole family put so much pride into the whole thing. Every time I saw my uncle or most of my other relatives at a gathering, it was the same thing, \So Jeffery, when you're a doc- tor, you're not going to charge your aunt are you?\ All this time, the only thing I was bas- ing my decision on was the fact that I had loved and done well in every biology class I had ever taken. In addition, every elemen- tary school report card I have re- veals that I was 'science~minded. The CTBS tests (remember those?) all pointed in the same direction. So, two years into my studies at Union l started to wonder. Did I ever actually think about my career goals? Did I want to get locked into this scene that I couldn't get out of? What was I doing in organic chemistry II? How did I ever get past the first part? It was all wrong ... the whole thing was a waste of time. Two years of biology and chemistry, and I found myself changing my major ... to English. Both organic chemistry courses count as free electives, which is only slightly humorous. Now, though I can't say for sure what I'll be doing in the near future, I would say that it's the best I've ever felt about what I was doing. When you make a sudden change like that, it never goes over well with the family. My immediate family was fine with it, but it's the awkward mo- ments when other relatives start making the same doctor com- ments that are hell to live through. \Umm ... actually, I changed my m<Uor to English ... \ Suddenly, the words of encour- agement turn to \Oh's and rela- tives just don't talk about my fu- ture plans nearly as much any- more. I'm not bitter at any relatives. Pride is only natural. I did figure something out, though. If you think you want to be a doctor, make sure it is something you've put enough thought into. I can't think of any- thing that sounds nearly as good as being in the medical profession and neither can your relatives. If you're still in your engineering phase, I can only hope that you get over it soon. In the end, the only right choice is the one that you come up with on your own. cause you all lived in the same house ... My Spanish house could host guest speakers and have dinners open to the entire campus, simi- lar to the existing Smjth house. Ditto for the french. And more than a means for organization, such houses would be an estab- lished forum for the language. Granted, this idea seems to make more sense im terms ofeul- tural, language-oriented themes than anything else, but that's not to say that other groups wouldn't benefit from sharing the same liv- ing space. Suppose the greenpeace house decided to up- date Union's feeble recycling situation ... thls week? They, too, could host speakers and discus- sions in a comfortable, existing atmosphere. Maybe I'm being too optimistic. Would this kind of stuffreally be a resultofsuchliv- ing ·situations? · · as anyone, and lrespect it.

Since both teams' are out of the running for a state playoff spot, each team·looked to finish strong and avenge a disap- pointing season. As Union broke from its huddle with its traditional shout of \15 MAN RUGBY,\ it found itself with players at very unusual positi<Jns. With Chris Weiler out du~ to ligament dam- age to his foot, Dan Rickson was called upon to prop. Mike Gill's sprained knee moved him from prop position to flanker, which moved Pike Mody to eightman. Serum-half Brian Field moved to fullback to c<lver for Myles Kellam who was on a pilgrimage to find the inner~soul of his cat. With fingers <Tossed and pain~ killers pumping through his bloodstream, Brian \Hey Audino ... watch til is\ Field booted the opening kickoff deep into gar- bage man territory. The Clarkson fullback kicked the ball out of bounds and, moments later, an offsides penally set up- Union's first score. The penalty boot sparked a brilliant day of kicking for Field, who got the team on the boards, 3•0. Finding themselves 'with an early lead, Union began to glow. For the first time this season, they began playing like a whole team. The scum started to dominate, once again lead by the infamous Eric \Squanto the Cap- tain\ Smith, whose kick receiv- ing percentage was a career high. A good kick on Clarkson's part gave them excellent field position as they attempted to capitalize on a few poor judgment calls by Union. Denial of this feat was not a strong enough word to explain the stonewall that made Union's defense. They amazingly re- pelled Clarkson's repeated at- tempt at a score. Chris \About last night ... \ Delano said, \Be- tween Pike's pass out ofthe back of the try zone and Malibu's at- tempt at a bicycle kick, it took a lot of guts to stop Clarkson.\ '' After fighting their way out of danger, Field quickly added an- other three point penalty kick to extend Union's lead to 6-0. In retuon,. Clarkson marched to Union's goal Jine· on the-ens~:~ing kickoff. As the Hue judge ap- peared to have called out of bounds, Clarkson punched in a try. Union had assumed that play had halted. ·their path.·.· Wi:~h .~ cambine,d serum line effort, Union began to move the balljn what illi'!Y have . been th!! best .series th~y~ .. have playedall year. Matt \Yoll Wan Sum?\ Lux dish~d the ball ~o . Freddy \Fl<>at Like a Butterfly, Sting ..like a G\ whose Men's Rugby pushes for win over Clarkson (Laurel Ruma I TC) Union clung to a one point lead. Angered by the \less than just\ score, the Rugby Gods rumbled omin()us thunder overhead.. As the sky split open with a deluge ofw.ater, tJnion'smen unleashed their vengeance and furious an- ger upon all those who stood in fake passes allowed him to drive deep into Clarkson's midfield. · Showing that in rugby 1 timing is everything, he released the ball t() · Alex \The Tank\ Douville, who dragged three defenders to the 35. While he was being dragge~ to the ground, Tom ''The Eskimo\ • ,Burke came·oqt·ofnowhpr~ to be · the recipient Qf a .'~smooth\. pass, and he rambled .tO Jhe 25. As Clarksonsmirked,at Union, think- itag the att&ck had-been thwarted, Pike \Your W·ing is an All- Amer,ican, my @#%\ Mody showed his running ability as he c&ught Burke'.s pass and bolted into the tryzone, unscathed by a Clarkson defenders. Union's stalwart defense was clearly visible throughout the rest ofthe game. Mike \What do you mean .I can't hit him in the head with this rock?\ Gill displayed his . zealous defensive strategy by get- ting a Clarkson defender, as well as himself, ejected for extensive over-politeness. Mat \I coulda been a contenda\ Scheller inter- cepted a pass that would hav.e re- sulted in his first score, had there not been a penalty called. To add insult to LnJUry, Mark \D'Amburitomobile\ D' Ambruoso showed a Clarkson defender that to tackle .a prop, you pay the price. When the sun broke through the clouds, the smell of stale .garbage, cheap co- logne and a Union victory wafted their way across the field. I l l I

Since almost no person with a brain actually votes based on the endorsement of a sports writer, I thought that The Concordiensis Sports Department should nominate a candidate. This way, we can try and help the politically inept who spend the majority of their time, like my- self, watching Sportscenter. ln what my colleagues will view as an attempt to gain spon- sorship, the sports section whole- heartedly endorses Nike founder and owner Phil Knight to become the 43rd President of the United States. It is not so much an en- dorsement of Knight, but rather an endorsement of the Nike party and for everything for which it stands. This nation is desperately caiHng for a political change. We need a leader and a party that can bring this nation into a surplus and stilfmaintainaforeign policy. Phil Knight, behind the force of numerous athletes, has created a 365 miHion'dollar operation which makes an estimated 36% profit. Nike also seHs its prod- ucts and sponsors teams world- wide, including nations such as China and the Ex-Soviet Repub- lies. If one man, in only twenty- three years, ,c<tn build a company to the level that Nike has attained, there is no reason why he ·cannot lead this nation back to glory. It is for these reasons as much as the reasons listed below why Phil Knight should become the next president. President Clinton comes into this election as the much hyped 20 point favorite and prognosti- cators throughout the free world say not to bet against the reign- ing champ.

Marietta (OH) (5-1) by ,~~ra G.,wer Staff Writer The Union Women's Rugby Team concluded their season at 5-l on Saturday, with a 60~ 12 drubbing of :R.JT. The ruggers took the fietd'in a cold.steady rain, yet again fielding a team of only 15 players. ·The outlook for: Union wis d'ltri when the open_; ing kick-off went to the oppos- ing prop~ who required halfofthe team to actually stop her forward progress. How.ever, this burst of energy depleted her supply for the day, and, despite her size and strength, she·<Jeased to be a fac- tor the rest of the day. Quickly gaining control of the ball and moving it downfield, Union's Kim \Truck\ Sanabia put in the first try of the day, rolling out of a maul and finding daylight on the opposite sideline. On the ensu- ing kickoff by RIT, Katie Conway caught the ball and passed to serum half, Sara Gower, who eluded a tackle and ran straight down the field to score Union's second try. After Gower added another try about five minutes later, RIT adopted the policy of trying to recreate the 'Thrilla in Manilla' on the Rugby pitch. In- stead of implementing legal stiffarms (just ask John Winters- he' II tell you all about them), RIT's fullback decided to work on her right hook and jab. Un- fortunately, this girl obviously had not read the scouting report on Union, who with the foursome of Julie \You should see what I do to Leahey\ Firman, Katie \He should know I'm ;the Queen\ Conway, Jen \Sugar Ray\ Lelas, and Sara Gower, have enough chips on their shoulders to build a whole new wing for Schaeffer Library. The half ended with scores by ·Conway and Gower arid one lucky try by RIT. During half- time, RI:'f's fullback must have · shared her brilliance with the ~est of her team as they tried to fol- low her example in 'the, secmid half, only to meet with the same fate as Tyson's last couple of op- ponents. As Firman led the \Firman charge\ down the field, a play practiced during her days on 4th floor West but perfected on th.e Rugby field, she tnet head on 'with one .of RIT's second ' ' . ,. rows. Feeling therumbling ofthe ground beneath her feet and see- ing the fire in Firman's eyes, the poor girl decided that the only choice left wasto ride piggyback. Carrying the girl on her back for another five meters, Firman was hit by another member of the RIT team and fell backwards, knock~ ing the unwelcome piggybacket unconscious. As the girl lay on the field struggling to catch her breath, a small whimper was heard as she looked up and saw Firman's imposing silhouette towering over her. The Union women's play im- proved dramatically on Saturday, as rookie Jo Vanderstone contrib- uted by winning almost every line out, and Deb Spaulding made a number of key catches and runs on the weakside wing.

I Dutchmen Stomp Engineers ... Win UCAA Title! by Frank Rossi Staff Writer Tell Athletic Direct9r Richard Sakala to add a jar of red shoe polish to the sports budget this year as the Fighting Dutchmen retained the shoes for a fourth- straight season by kicking the RPl Engineers 17-0. Union started the game on a nervous noteas quarterback Tom McKeown tossed an interception on the third play. RPl took the interception to the two-yard line, but a clipping call sent the baH back to the Union 25. After gain- ing only two yards in three plays, the Engineers botched a 40-yard field goal after a bad snap, allow- ing the Dutchmen to come away from their own miscue with no damage done. RPI had another golden opportunity during their third possession as a Union pen- alty and a few good RPI plays brought the baH to the Union 37. RPI shot themselves in the foot again, however, with two straight holding calls. After a failed third and 35, the Engineers were forced to punt, keeping the.game score- less. No scoring was seen until four minutes were remaining in the first half. After taking the ball at midfield, Tom McKeown heaved a third-and-three pass to tight end Leon Grebla nine yards into the endzone for Union's first touchdown. RPI attempted to answer before halftime with their newest weapon, Jim Manning. Manning, who played for Union the last two seasons, moved down Route 7 to attend RPI this year. Manning had 74 rushing yards on the day, but he was unable to lead his team to a score. At halftime, the score remained 7-0. The second half belonged to the Union \Gamet Wave\ defense. RPI 's first drive of the half ended Shuron Morton gains several of his game high I 78 yards in a 17-0 win over KPJ (by Laurie Kirschner I TC) abruptly after three unproductive plays. Union took over at their own 26-yard line after an Engi- neer punt, and Tom McKeown took advantage ofRPI's sluggish- ness. McKeown completed two third-down passes and added an- other completion to receiver Pe- ter Buscemi 37 yards downfield to the one-yard line before Shuron Morton carried the ball in one yard for the final touchdown of the day. Buscemi, who only held pla(;e kicks during the Albany game due to an injured ankle, said, \It's a big relief. I'm just glad to be back out and be able to help the team as a whole.\ After the Morton touchdown, the de- fense had three stunning moments which locked the game for the Dutchmen. First, with 4:57 re- maining in thethirdquart€r, senior linebacker Bobby Champlin inter- cepted an RPI pass for the second straight season, giving Union the ball deep in RPI territory. Unfor- tunately, the Dutchmen were called for holding during their pos- session and had to punt from the 41-yard line. At the start of the fourth quarter, Jim Manning was heard from again as he ran for 3 7 yards in two plays. Union's de- fense became stingy after those plays as Manning lost six yards in the next two plays. On a fourth and six on Union's nine-yard line, RPJ 's freshman quarterback, Sean O'Bryan, passed the ball to his se- nior receiver, Brian Rotchford, for five yards, one yard short of the first down as safety Bill Mehleisen stopped Rotchford. Mehleisen stated, \We have the best coaches in Division III right now. We know what's going to happen before it happens, and we have a great defensive heart.\ Union's offense again could not take advantage of the stop as Judson Zachar punted on a fourth and inches at the Union l3. Zachar's eight-yard punt left RPl in great posjtion to halve Union's lead. With a total offive opportunities for RPI in a goal- to-go situation, Union's defense held strong and rejected the En- gineers again, ending with a one- yard shovel pass snuffed out by linebacker Mario Maltese. Union's offense produced this time as Shuron Morton ran 73 yards on a third and eight from Union's seven. After two in- complete passes, Roger Egb~rt put away the game with a26-yard field goal, giving the Dutchmen their 17·0 victory. This. victory alse gave 6-0 · Uq:)Qn their .second strai,ght UCAAcrown,. but thi& )!etJr, it i~ ·union '.salon~. :Last year, R~ijnd . ·union both had one UCAA loss, and therefore, ttrey spared the title~ 'Uni.on have shutout three of their four UCAA opponents (RPl, St. Lawrence, and Rochester) while getting a battle from Hobart (24-22). Prime- Time Players There were several stars on both sides of the ball again this week, especially on defense. On the offensive end, Tom McKeown added another touch- down to his total, as he completed eight of his 18 passes for 97 yards. Leon Grebla shined as he grabbed two passes for 25 yards, includ- ing the first touchdown of the day. Shuron Morton, however, shocked many people as he qui- etly carried for 178 yards, includ- ing the fourth-quarterrun that put RPI to bed. Morton averaged 5.2 yards per carry, and this week's UCAA Offensive Player of the Week and ECAC Upstate New y orkhonor-roll in ember is just 96 yards away from the I ,000-yard mark for this season. Kicker Roger Egbert, who leads the team with 4 7 points and could lead the team in scoring for the second- straight season, is just seven field goals away from Greg Harrison's career record of37. The \Garnet Wave\ washed away all hopes of an RPI victory early and often. The defense al- lowed only 148 yards, including only 29 yards passing, and sacked RPI's Sean O'Bryan four times (compared to two RPI sacks). continued on page 23 Women's Soccer Wins a Pair at Home by Aaron Sicotte Staff Writer After suffering a close 1-0 loss to a tough Williams team, the Dutchwomen were looking to earn a couple of wins in their weekend home series against UCAA opponents Clarkson and St. Lawrence. Against both teams,. mounted attacks only to turn the ball over to the other team with careless passes and trapping. Slowly and steadily, Union began to take control of the game. Through strong defensive play, they proceeded to keep the ball in their offensive end, however, the offense was unable to score a goal. They fired Clarkson on friday, they took the field fired up, and were ready to play. As the game progressed it was clear that it would be a sloppy game for both teams. From the opening kickoff the games flow swung back and forth, as shot after shot went just over the crossbar, or barely wide. The few shots that were placed on net were directly at the goalie for easy saves. As the first half progressed with nu- merous potential scoring oppor- tunities passing by, the frustration of the Union team continued to rise. With less than I 0 seconds left in the half, it appeared that their efforts had paid off. The crowd rose and began cheering as the ball bounced on the line and looked to be a goal, only to sit in surprise as the goalie grabbed the ball and the referees looked on without calling a goal. Even more frustrated, Union headed into half-time in a 0-0 tie, despite dominating the overmatched Clarkson team. As has become their signature, Union came out in the second half playing well and looking to draw blood. Their first half domination continued in the second half, but were unable to put the ball in the net. Time after time, they mounted attacks or fired· shots only to be thwarted by a careless mistake or a misfired shot. As the clock con- tinued to tick, it began to look more and more like the teams would be heading into overtime. The frustration was obvious on the faces of the Dutchwomen. Just as it looked like there would be no scoring, Abby Harris, who had played a phenomenal game throughout, took it upon herself to avoid overtime. With less than three and a half minutes left in the game, she took the hall at mid- field, dribbled towards the Clarkson goal beating numerous defenders, and made a perfect pass to Sarah Cardullo who easily put it in the back of the net for the game winner.

Dutchmen Stomp Engineers ... Win UCAA Title! tn Fr:1nl; Rn,,i Sill// II ritn Tell Athletic Director Richard Sakala to add a jar of red shoe polish to the sports budget this year as the Fighting Dutchmen retained the shoes for a fourth- straight season by kicking the RPI Engineers 17-0. Union started the game on a nervous note as quarterback Tom McKeown tossed an interception on the third play. RPI took the interception to the two-yard line, but a clipping call sent the ball back to the Union 25.

No scoring was seen until four minutes were remaining in the first half After taking the ball at midfield, Tom McKeown heaved a third-and-three pass to Light t:nd Leon Grebla nine yards into the endzone for Union's first touchdown. RPI attempted to answer before halftime with their newest weapon, Jim Manning. Manning, who played for Union the last two seasons, moved down Route 7 to attend RPI this year. Manning had 7 4 rushing yards on the day. but he was unable to lead his team to a score. At halftime, the score remained 7-0. The second half belonged to the Union \Garnet Wave\ defenst;.

Buscemi, who only lleld place kicks during the Albany game due to an injured ankle, said, \It's a big relief. I'm just glad to be back out and be able to help the team as a whole.\ After the Morton touchdown, the de- fense had three stunning moments which locked the game for the Dutchme11. First, with 4:57 re- maining in the third quarter, senior I incbacker Bobby Champlin inter- cepted an RPI pass for the :o.econd straight season, giving Union the ball deep in RPI territory. Unfor- tunately, the Dutchmen were called for holding during their pos- session and had to punt from the 41-yard line. At the start of the f()urth quarter, Jim Manning was heard from again as he ran for 3 7 yards in two plays. Union's de- fense became stingy after those plays as Manning lost six yards in tile next two plays. On a fourth and six on Union's nine-yard line, RPI's freshman quarterback, Sean 0' Bryan, passed the ball to his se- llior receiver, Brian Ratchford, for five yards, one yard short <Jf the first down as safety Bill Mehleisen stopped Ratchford. Mehleisen stated, \We have the best coaches in Division I II right now. We know what's going to happen before it happens, and we have a great defensive heart.\ Union's offense again could not take advantage of the stop as Judson Zachar punted on a fourth and inches at the Union 13. Zachar's eight-yard punt left RPI in great position to halve Union's lead. With a total of five opportunities for RPI in a goal- to-go situation, Union's defense held strong and rejected the En- gineers again, ending with a one- yard shovel pass snuffed out by linebacker Mario Maltese. Union's offense produced this time as Shuron Morton ran 73 yards on a third and eight from Union's seven. After two in- complete ra~se<>.

This victory also gave 6-0 Union their second straight UCAA crown, but tlilis year, it is Union's alone. Last year, RPI and Union both had one UCAA loss, and therefore, they shared the title. Union have shwtout three of their four UCAA opponents (RPI, St. Lawrence, and Rochester) while getting a battle from Hobart (24-22). Prime-Time Players There were several stars on both sides of the ball again this week, t.:specially on defense. On the offensive end. Torn McKeovv n added another touch- down to his total, as he complekd eight of his 18 passes for 97 yards. L~on Grebla shined as he grabbed two passes for 25 yards, induJ- ing the lir~t tuu~.:hdo\\ ll ol tht.: Ja;. S h u ron Morton, h o \\ c v e r, shocked many people as he qui- etly carried for I 78 yards, includ- ing the fourth-quarter run that put RPI to bed. Morton averaged 5.2 yards per carry, and this week's UCAA Offensive Player of the Week and ECAC Upstate New York honor-roll member is just 96 yards away from the I ,000-yard mark for this season. Kicker Roger Egbert, who leads the team with 47 points and could lead the team in scoring for the second- straight season, is just seven field goals away from Greg Harrison's career record of 3 7. The \Garnet Wave\ washed away all hopes of an RPI victory early and often. The defense al- lowed only 148 yards, including only 29 yards passing, and sacked RPl's Sean O'Bryan four times (compared to two RPI sacks). continued on page 23 Women's Soccer Wins a Pair at Horne by Aaron Sicotte Staff Writer Aftersufferingaclose 1-0 loss to a tough Williams team. the Dutchwom en were looking to earn a couple of \vins in their weekend horne series against { !CAA opponents Clarkson and St. Lawrence. Against both teams, . mounted attacks only to turn the ball over to the other team with careless passes and trapping. Slowly and steadily. Union began to take control of the game. Through strong defensive play, they proceeded to keep the ball in their offensive end, however, the offense was unable to score a goal They fired Clarkson on friday, they took the field fired up. and were ready to play. As the game progressed it was clear that it would be a sloppy game for both teams. From the opening kickoff the games flow swung back and forth, as shot after shot went just o\er the crossbar, or barely wide. The few shots that were placed on net were directly at the goalie for C'asy saves. As the first half progressed with nu- merous potential scoring O!)p<lr- tunities llassing by, the frustration of the Union team continued to rise. With less than 10 seconds left in the half, it appeared that their efforts had paid off. The crowd rose and began cheering as the ball boLJnced on the line and looked to be a goal, only to sit in surprise as the goalie grabbed the ball and the referees looked on without calling a goal. Even more frustrated, Union headed into half-time in a 0-0 tie, despite dom in at ing the overmatched Clarkson team. As has become their signature, Uniun~;aJne;: uul in the ~e~.:unJ half playing well and looking to draw blood. Their first half dominati()n continued in the second half, but were unable to put the ball in the 11et. Time after time, they mounted attacks or fired shots only to be thwarted by a careless mistake or a misfired shot. As the clock con- tinued to tick, it began to look more and more like the teams would be heading into overtime. The frustration was obvious on the faces of the Dutchwomen. Just as it looked like there would be no scoring, Abby Harris, who had played a phenomenal game throughout, took it upon herselfto avoid overtime.

False . fire al~rms tend to reduce sensitivity to the emergent nature ofa fire alarm and causes slow response. Slow response in an actual fire emergency is a real danger that could be . disastrous. Please, in the interests of safety, immediately evacuate the building when- ever a fire alann sounds in the bujlding! We have been most fortunate on campus that we have not experienced a serious fire disaster. However, during the 95196 academic year we did experience 19 minor fires on . campus, 10 of which occurred in residence halls. There were no injuries or serious • damage as a result of these fires but the number-of incidents should give us pause to · consider our actions/reactions to this threat potential. ~----------------------------------------------~ 2)0ver the past two weeks there has been a serious increase (nine recorded incidents) of false activation of our new Code Blue Emergency Telephones.

Durhi.g Gonzalez's sopho- more year, Tiggle; who special- 'izes in nmlticultural recruitment encouraged her to get involved. She began her involvement by hosting minority students over- night to expose them to Union. Gonzalez is president of Circule Estudiantil Latino Americano (CELA). She and other members ofthis group are active it1 this recruiting process. Lasl month, members of CELA attended a Latino Festival in Hamilton Hill to make residents aware of the Latino population and opportunities at Union. Gonzalez says: \Many people were surprised that I was repre- senting Union.\ Her goal is to make minority students in' Schenectady, as well as around the country realize that Union is a possibility. She wants them to be aware of the opportunities for Dils par- ticipated in Union's Masters in Teaching Program, and com- pleted a one-year internship in teach- ing. He spoke of teaching Dean Letriz are satu- rated,'' he said, \so for us, the need to go to o the t countries · is essen- tial.\ Burton contin- uedto say as a profession which he truly en- joys. He did not study two lan- guages, however, and strongly encouraged students to do this, saying,. \Having the ability to speak two languages makes you a lot more marketable.\ that small finns are typically intimidated by the gap that exists between cul- tures, and that language skills are the key to overcoming such bar- riers. \If you can bridge that gap,\ he said, \you become very valu- able to those finns.\ ~p_eaker on the_ Zapatista Rebellion the Struggle for Democracy in Mexico Curran also 'studied French, but, unlike Oils, did not enter a profession directly involving the language. However, h~r job placements did indirectly include the use of her French skills. She received her Masters in French lit~ erature from NYU, and, after graduating, worked in the eeo- .nornic research department of a bank in Con~Jecticut. She later took an entry-level marketing position at the New York Philhar- monic. Now, Curran is working for an educational publishing company. Curran stressed the value ofher language education in all these different positions. \Studying French improved my self-confidence. Employers today are looking for oral and written skills, and for people with a per- spective on a wider area. They want employees who are well- rounded and mature, with a will- ingness to take on challenges. So, even when I didn't get to use French specifically, my French education helped me in different fields.\ Letriz, Dean of Students at Union, emphasized the impor- tance of l.anguag~ in breaking Lambrinos spoke of the sig- nific~mce of language in busi- ness. Union's GMI Program, which he directs, aiiO\YS stu- dents to obtain M.B.A.s in an extra one year of study. Stu- dents apply during their junior year, and need a minimum 3.2 G.P.A. to be accept~d. The· course of study for the f<mrth and fifth years involves taking four courses per term, studying a foreign language ano partici- pating in a term abroad, doing a senior thesis, and doing in- ternational internships as well. The language requirements, . Lambririos said, make the GMI Program unique. \It's far more comprehensive than the other international programs that we've see.n. This is a program for the 21st century.\ The evening provided an op- portunity for students to see the wide array of possibilities open to language majors. Students interested in finding out more about career options are en- couraged to visit the Career Development Center, located on th~ -third floor of Old Chapel. by Teresa Meade Associate Profe~sor of History On Wednesday, November6 in the Reamer College Center Au- ditorium at 7:30 PM C.E.L.A. (Circulo Estudiantil Latino Americano) and the Latin Ameri- can. Studies program are sponsor- ing a talk by Cecilia RodrRguez, a representative of the Zap~tista Allily of National Liberation and a member of the National Com- mission for Democracy in Mexico (NCDM). She will ecture on the indigenous uprising that has shaken Chiap!l5, Mexico since January 1994. Rodriguez, a long- time activist in the ChicaQo/a and . immigrant rights movements in South Texas has since 1994 served as the representative in the United States ofthe Zapatista in- surgents. According to Subcomandante lnsurgente Marcos, leader -of the movement: \Cecilia RodrRguez has proven to be an honest per- son who is authentically con- cerned about democracy and peace in Mexican territories .... \ An internationally recognized human rights: activist, Rodriguez was invited to take part in a hu- man rights delegation to Chiapas, Mexico during the Zapatista up- rising in early 1994. Since then she has worked closely with the Zapatistas. Rodriguez is currently campaigning on behalfof indig- enous people and the poor, who have suffered enormously from · Mexico's economic policies, as well as from political repression by the police and military. Rodriguez will address the fol- lowing issues in her talk: the Zapatista struggle for democracy and j1:1stice in Chiapas; human rights abuses by the Mexican gov- ernment against the Zapatistas and suspected supporters; the tar- geting ofwomen and indigenous people by the military and the police; United States' involve~ ment in and support for the Mexi- can government's economic policy and military activity in the region; the devastating impact of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) on the people of Mexico. This event is being co- sponsored by many campus orga- nizations and academic. depart- ments. financial aid. \W()rking with the Admissions Office and CELA, we've been able to get through to a lot mi- nority students who wouldn't nor- mally consider Union an option,\ says Gonzalez. She stresses lack of information about financial aid. \Students assume that ifthey don't have $27,000, they can't afford Union. I want students to be aware that aid is available.\ Gonzalez says that she had simi- lar doubts when she was a senior applying to colleges. She thought that financially, Union was out of reach. Gonzalez is adamant about this issue because financial aid made it possible for her to attend Union. She believes that many students see Union's cost as a barrier, Tiggle and Gonzalez hope to start a program designed to assist parents in filling out fi- nancial aid forms. Gonzalez is an active member of the Union community. In ad- dition to her involvement in ad- missions and CELA, she is a member of ALAS and served as an Orientation Advisor. She is studying psychology and sociol- ogy and hopes to eventually work in the field of counseling. She has had a great experience here at Union and hopes to encourage other minority students to explore the opportunity to attend the col- lege. Gonzalez concludes: \1 think it's great that under!'epresented students who haven't been given many oppor- tunities in the past, are given the ' opportunity to attend Union.\ INTERNATIONAL Jon SKII.JS · New professional M.A. in International Affairs or Interamerican Studies prepares you rapidly for exciting careers: · L1 environmental studies L1 public health LJ government 0 international organizations LJ international media, business Learn valuable analytic skills from economics and the social sciences.

In a ceremony held on October 25th Armand V. and Donald S. Feigenbaum cut the ribbon on the building that110uses the offices of the President, Vice President for Academic Affairs, Vice President for Finance, and Vice President for Public· Affairs. Kara Christian StaffWriter Thi~ fall, engineering enroll- ment has increased over 30%, from 74 to J 00 st!idents. Dean Kenyon of the Engineering De- partment explains that engineer- ing enrollment around the coun- try tends to be· cyclicaL From 1979 to 1994, there was a 43% decline in enrollment.· However, engineering h~s made a significant comeback this year. Kenyon believes that enrollment reflects the times. Overthe~next. 3 or 4 years, colleges and univer- sities shoul(j see a strong return to engineering and other science- related majors. ·· While demographics play an. important role in this increase, students are generally mor.e at- tracted toscienee and tedmoJogy because oftheirgrowing impor-: tance. As a result, many colleges and universities are restructuring engineering curriculums, The ceremony was attended by many of the familiar administra- tion officials as well as faculty and students. President Hull con- gratulated both Donald and Armand Feigenbaum for their major contribution to Union. This maj.or gift has been used to up- date the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning in the building. The gift also has provided for the inauguration of the Feigenbaum Forum which is designed to bring together business managers, aca- demicians, and researchers in a setting designed to tackle com- plex managerial problems. The Forum plans on meeting on. a regular basis in the newly dedi- cated Feigenbaum Hall. The Feigenbaum brothers, of Pittsfield, Massachusetts both re- ceived their undergraduate de- grees at Union, Donald in 1946 and Armand in 1942. The broth- ers together founded General Sys- tem·s Company thirty' years ago. The international engineering firm designs and implements in- tegrated management systems for major corporations and organiza- tions around the world. Feigenbaum dedication (Piwto by Laurie Kirschner/TC) In the past, engineers have been criticized for their lack of writing,. reading, and communi- cation skills. Kenyon explains that many engineers .are labeled as '\ignorant to the real world .... They are solely deter- ministic and not probabilistic.\ Many assume that engineers work well anonymously rather than in team environments. For years, engineers have been called naive in the fields of politics and business. President RogerHull said, \We are pleased to place the Feigenbaum name on this build- ing to recognize not only the out- standing professional achieve- ments but also their sup.port and generosit):' to Union.\ The building itself has a long history, originally constructed in 1871 as a residence for President Eliphalet Nott Potter. When Pot- ter\ left the College in 1884, the building became a h<;>me for two faculty families. After a fire, the structure was remodeled in 1919 to become th.e ,administration building; up to~that time, admirt~ istrative offices had been scat- tered across campus. Donald and Armand Feigenbaum spoke at the dedica- tion ceremony and to the Concordiensis after the cer- emony. They had nothing but praise for Union and the admin- istration. Both said that, \the Ad- ministration and President Hull are doing an outstandingjob.\ In . fact, bo.th expressed tht~.t Union will always have an important place in their hearts and their minds. \If I had to do it all over again I would come to Union,\ said Donald S. Feigenbaum. Because it was the 50th reunion for Mr. Donald S.

According to President Hull, \Donald S. Feigenbaum imparts a message that increases effi- ciency in organizations around the world.\ He was then awarded an honorary degree as a Doctor of Science. The dedication ceremony ended with a short reception in which President Hull revealed to the Concordiensis that the administration's next move, as far as buildings is concerned, \will focus on Residence Halls.\ Hopefully, Union will be as for- tunate to receive further gifts and contributions that help to make the appearance of our college bet- ter. In an effort to change these ste- reotypes, the Engineering De- partment is restructuring the cur- riculum. In the past, the program has been a disconnected assort- ment of courses. The focus was \tougher longer, denser.\ This however, was not the answer. The focus of the curriculum is now changing from process to educational outcomes. The de- partment is COJ1Stantly \revamp- ing and reinventing.\ Kenyon comments, \Engi- neering is not an appli.ed sc:ience.

Union strives to offer students a well-balanced curriculum focus- ing on technical skills, as wel1 as communication skills and an un- derstanding of professional and ethical responsibility. The funding for.the new cur- ricul!:\m has been provided by a 5-ye'ar grant from the GE Foun- datioR. The CoHege is entering the fourth year of development under this grant. Kenyon ex- plains that freshmen entering the engineering or computer science programs this fall \embarked on a totally new cu1riculum de- signed to prepare them for liv· ing a life and earning a living in a glooaHy-based engineering community ofthe next century.\ Because the GE grant did not include capital funding, Presi- dent Hull and Dean Cool have pr:oyided funding to upgrade fa- cilities. The new Freshmen En- gineering Design Studio and In- tegrated Math-Physics Class\- room and Laboratory are results of the curriculum. Both class- rooms are located in the Science · and Engineering Building and provide students with extensive laboratory equipment and com- puter software. This engineering program in- troduces aspects of engineering practice and design early in the curriculum and includes the study of several non-technical, yet essential, subjects, such as ethics, environmental awareness and economics. According to Kenyon 1 it is \one of the most in- novative programs in the na- tion.\ l;age Fire ••• continued from page 1 age to the building.

BUDGET During the Clinton administra-· tion, the deficit was cut four years. straight- the first time since the Civil War. President Clinton has proposed· a plai{ to. ~balance the budget by 2002. This plan will include our com- mitments to children, elderly, and all other Americans, as well as economic growth. The plan protects the existence of Medicare, Medicaid, and So- cial Security. Environmental preservation through many spe- cific national programs is in- cluded in the budget, as well as by Suzanne Dougherty Political Editor ABORTION With the firm belief that an unborn child has full funda- mental liberties and is a human being distinct from its mother, ReJ?ublicans are opposed to abortion rights. They support legislation that would include unborn children under the 14th amendment's protections. They oppose government fund- ing for abortions and will no~ fund organizations that advo- cate abortion. BUDGET The Republicans are strong supporters of a shrinking gov- ernment with a balanced bud- get and lower taxes: They vig- orously support an amendment to the Constitution requiring the government to have a balanced budget. They believe that rais- ing tax rates is the wrong way to balance the budget and would support a supermajority requirement in Congress to raise taxes. They make a promise that if Dole is elected president he will use the line- item veto agai~st wasteful spending and veto any bills that approp~iate too much money on programs. CRIME an educatiollal system which will become second to none ... The Democrats believe in,tncre efficient government, one that \works \better and costs less.\ ·~· - CRlME The Democratic platform on crime is to put more police on the streets, and to work to take more guns and drugs off th.e streets. The police forces will be incr.eased by 100,000, indi- viduals, and community watch programs will be .promoted. · Tough punishment is the key to decreasing crime rates. J'he Democrats will work to estab- lish the ·''three-strikes and you're out\ law, which ensures that repeat violent criminals go to j_ail· for l~f-e. To end c:rime before it begins, the Cli'ilton administration will propose to increase drug and gang-edllca- tion programs .. To confront the issue of drugs, the Crime Bill established the death penalcy for Drug Lords. dents to'ensure that all individu- als ha:ve met certain criteria upon graduation. In addition, every classroom a:nd library should be technologically up to date. By the year 2000·, every classroom and library will be hooked up to the Information Superhighway. Students will be prepared to compete for high paying jobs. Finally, every American should be able to at- tend two years of coHege. Col- lege Loans have been ex- panded. The Democrats want to create a $10,000 tax deduc~ tion for families so more Americans will be able to at- tend higher education. FOREIGN POLICY \The Democratic Party be- lieves a key to strengthening peace is stable and peaceful re- lations among tl:le world's ma- jor powers.\ The Democratic platform on foreign policy stresses the importance of pro- moting democracy which are critical to America's economic EDUCATION and political security. The The Democratic Party stands on Clinton administration does not the notion that \'education is the promote radical intervention, key to opportuility. '' New stan- though protecting and promot- dards need to be set for teach- ing democratic stability in re- ers to ensure that the best are gions such as the Middle East, educating our nation, and stan- Eastern Europe, and the Asia dards of competency and Pacific Region. Approximately achieveme~t will be set for stu- _ less thap ol?-e .P~~ciut ~of the budget is allocated to diplomatic and foreign policy, and the Democratic Party would like to see an ~ncrease in that figure to allow the U.S. to resolveprob~ lems relevant to our national security before tl_ley begin. HEALTH CARE No American should go with- out healthcare. This is why the Democratic Party wants to make affordable, high quality healthcare available to &11 Americans. In the Clinton ad- ministration, the Kennerly- Kassebaum health reform bill was passed to ensure that people are not discriminated in receiv- ing coverage because of a pre- existing condition. This bill also allows families to keep their health coverage when they switch jobs. In addition, more money has been spent for medi- cal research, including breast cancer research, which wit- nessed a 65% increase, and AJDS research, which in- creased almost 40%. Health,, care coverage for all Americans is one of the top priorities on the Democratic agenda. IMMIGRATION All Americans are immigrants. The Democratic Party pro- motes legal immigration that is \pro-family pro-work, pro-re- - ~ sponsibility, and pro-crtJzen- ship.\ However, illegal immi- gration should be stopped. Border patrols are being in- , creased and reinforced to en- sure that illegal immigration decreases._ Employers who hire illegal immigrants will be sub- ject to increased criminal and civil sanctions. Tile welfare system should not allow illegal immigrants to coll~ct benefits. These are issues which will be considered by the Democratic Party while confronting the is- sue of illegal immigration. WELFARE REFO:RM Throughout the Clinton admin- istration, much of the respon- sibility of maintaining welfare programs was handed to the states. This will ensure that new welfare reforms will work at a local level, as well as a national level. The Democratic Party would like to move more people from welfare to jobs, and protect children in the pro- cess. People must receive the skills that they will need to get off welfare, and stay off wel- fare, and this i.s the feundation on which the Democratic plat- form on welfare reform is built. (Information cited from \Democratic Convention- Plat- form,\ Congressional Quar- terly, August 17, 1996) The Republican Views Claiming that Democrats have been easy on crime over tlie past four years, Republicans are in favor of fighting back with legislation that would end \government policy that ilas been controlled by criminals and their defense lawyers.\ Republicans worry that juve- nile crime is on the rise and those juveniles that commit adult crimes should be tried as adults. The party believes firmly that law enforcement must remain in the hands of local communities so that they can decide what is best for their communities and neighbor- hoods. EDUCATION The Republican belief is that the federal government has no constitutional right to be in- volved in the educational sys- tems of local communities. They favor the abolition of the Department of Education, in turn, ending federal interven- tion In schools and allowing for direct, local and parental in- volvement. They urge the states to enact programs de- signed to give parents the choice of public, private, or religious school, regardless of money. Examples of these pro- grams are block grants, vouch- ers, school rebates, and cbar- ter schools . • FOREIGN POLICY Jn formulating American for- eign policy, the Republicans find it most important to en- sure that American interests~ always come first. This can be accomplished through th.e strengthening of the Depart- men( of State and an altered relationship with the United Nations. The Republicans do not believe that the United States should not subordinate its sovereneignty to any inter- national authority, including the United Nations. They ac- tively support the promotion and restoration of democracy worldwide.

A new age of impersonality by Peter Sorensen Features Erlitor Earlier today, I was on the tele- phone line with the folks at AT&T, that manolithic finan- cially-troubled corporation where customers are reduced to anum- ber and their mother's maiden name (for security .purposes). I was on hold for a while, listening to some awesome, pseudo-jazz, elevator music; every ·30 seconds, a voice-recorded messages apolo- gized to me for the delay, suggest- ing that I may wish to hold, or I may wish to call back at ·a later time. I was thinking, \Wow I can hold or I can hang up? Thanks man, I wasn't sure what my op- tions were, but now I'm clear.\ In light ofthe factthatthis is a phone company, I should have immedi- ately noted the curious stupidity of their message, hung up, and filed my experience under \intel- lectually challenged.\ But no, stupid curiosity got the best of me ...

Anyway, this two-plane split· in didn't have a checking acc<>unt with AT&T, butratheracreditac- count. To boot, I was pretty sure that my status as a college stu'<ient had a great deal to do with not only the respect I was accor-<!ed, but their attemptto weasel mo11ey ill communication\ and I thought, \Wait a minute ...

Weekly Focus: Fair Charges for Damages? by Jay Mofe11son Staff Writer On October 15th, a fluores- cent yellow sheet ofpaper ap- peared taped to th~_hallway wall of Davidson. The sign read, \When damage ... or theft of col- lege-owned property occurs within common areas ofbuildings and the responsibleperson(s) can- not be determined._.appropriate costs and/or fines may be as- sessed to a group of students ... a minimum amount of $5 will be charged to each student's account within the group.'' Apparently, on my weekend away from Union, an unknown individual proceeded to vandalize the walls with a marker. A couple of squirts of windex and a quick wipe later, the vandalism was no more and in its place was a mini- mum fine of $5 for each person in the hall, never mind the rest of the Davidson residents. Since the whole floor was billed for the damag~,.l wondered if it really cost $1 3 0 for Wi ndex and a rag. My seco11d question was, why were we being charged for damages that someone else was responsible for, never mind the fact that any of us would have taken the responsibility to clean it up. Our resident assistant in- formed us that we had \to be re- sponsible in ensuring that prop- erty is not damaged or stolen.\ Does .this mean that we should patrol the halls in searoh of van- dals and_ wrongdoers in order to ensure that we are not punished for more misdeeds for which we were originally never respon- sible? I bring into question the profit making tendencie-s demon.- strated in this practice by Resi- dence Life. This practice isas ri- diculous as the claims that Wash- ington D.C. pays thousands of dollars to purchase a hammer or a toilet seat. Where does the profit go? Why should we have to contribute to that magical pot if we were not at fault?

) >age 10 October 31, 1996 'illlp~ illontl;idHenziz · · · , Arts & [ntertainment ~ ~~--- ' . . Jon Lovitz is Stuck in a Real School Daze \High School High\ Starring Jon Lovitz, Tia Carrere, Mekhi Phifer, Louise Fletcher. Directed by Hart Bochner. Rated PG-13, TriStar Pictures. Rating: **1/2 (out offour) In this long-anticipated movie (it was due in theaters over the summer),'David Zucker and Pat Proft, two of the originators of such classic comedies as Air- plane! and The Naked Gun se- ries, tum their silly visions toward a parody of all those inspiring teacher-in-the-hood movies - you know, Dangerous Minds. The result is like Dangerously Mindless, with totally offensive nods to everything from under- achieving losers to a racially-hi .. ased education system. Lovitz, whose name does not come to mind when asked to list Hollywood's leading men, stars as Richard Clark, a teacher at a snobby prep school where his fa- ther has just promoted llim to a department chairman. Dick Clark wants to teach in the inner city, to reach out to children and to stop following in his father's footsteps. So, off to urban paradise he goes, although your escort thrQugh the city is not the hit tune, \Gangstas Paradise.'~ What differences Michelle Pfeiffer made to her Dangerous Minds class is tripled in e:xcess here; Pfeiffer shaped up her dass, but Lovitz beautifies the entire city block. Carrere (Wayne'sUnne in Wayne's World) plays the teacher who falls for the ditzy Lovitz. These two make for a mismatched pairperfectly at home in this ... well, strange movie. Also on board is Fletcher as the school's principal, a bat-wielding, drug-pushing au- thority figure. Pfeiffer, whose film debut was in last year's underappreciated but critic&lly- loved Clockers, plays the one student Clark wants to reach. ·Jf this classro~m~ gangsta will open his book to learn, the rest ofthe class (who worship him) will fol- low suit. As witll most send-up com- edies of this type, the humor is very scattershot The jokes are aimed in alldirections- high and low, left a11d right. The predi~t­ able result is that some work and some don't. Zucker and Proft's script contains relatively few snappy lines, keeping the laugh- out-loud-till-it-hurts quotient fairly low. It's the visual humor - the jok.es on the sidelines -· which are particularly effective. There is a lot of action going on in the backgroupd, which is often more fun to pick up than watch.., ing Lovitz stand dumb-founded in his dilapidated classroom: the lo- cal theater advertises its main at- traction, <:ailed \1 Oth Smash Year -Scarface;\ when Clark arrives for his first day on the job at the appropriately titled Marion Barry High Scho()l, a second story class- room explodes; the statue ofBany on tqe front square also changes features many times) first sport- ing a bong and then an AK-47;. the high school has a state-of- the-art security and metal-dett:lC- tion system; and at one point, Clark teaches behind a wire cage. Some sideline dialogue _is etude and nasty;. like the receptionist who answers the p.hone at th19 prep school: \Wellington Acad- emy? Are you white?'·' Any seri- ous statements m.ade by sU:ch noted filmmakers like Spike Lee and John Singleton are blownoLJt ofthe water by a script which does not attempt to correct stereo- types, but rather to exploit them for comic potential. There is much potential, but not every- thing is comic. . The result is a movie that is high on the chuclde fa~tor but still missing the mark on the \Sue cessful Absurd Comedy\ scale. However, when compared tore- cent works which attempt asimi- lartype ofcomedy (Spy Hard, for example), High School High is a pretty easy 90-minute movie to get through. When Clark's car is stolen twenty seconds after he parks it, leaving only the steering wheel with The Club still attached. to it, you know that things CQuld be much worse in this movie.

Sponsored by the New York State Writer's institute as part of its Fal11996 Classic Film Series, the screening is free and open to the public. The plot sounds familiar enough- a young man sleepwalks into a haunted castle -but Vampyr is a highly unorthodox forerunner of the horror genre, distinguislled by its eerie camera work and a strange and subtle eroticism. In his first sound film, director Carl Theodore Dreyer probes the boundary between reality and dream to create a uniquely poetic experience of terror. A character of questionable sanity relates a series of murders that coincide with the arrival ofthe hypnotic Dr. Caligari and his carnival side-show. With its extrerne contrasts of light and dark, distorted angles, exaggerated perspectives, and deconstructing plot, The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari is considered the first significant film of German Expressionism, exemplifying the movement's narrative and visual traits.

'\ ~ ' 0 PIED .· · · Z!Ilp~ C!.hntntri)icnsis • October 31, l996 · Page 12 EDITORIAL U Need to Sober Up Blitzed, wasted, bombed and loaded are just some ofthe words that can . be used to describe most Union students on Monday, Wednesday, Thurs- day, Friday and Saturday nights. The rest of the days are left to perhaps studdying or watching T.V. Many students will be disappointed when they learn that, found in the Princeton Review, Union was taken effthe list of the top 20 party schools · in America. That is pathetic. Why did people come to Union in the first . place? Was it the liquor and beer, or was it for the old-fashioned reason of · getting an education? Well, Union makes both possib.le. The alcohol policy is so vague that even the administrators have diffi- culty interpreting the rules. They pull thG wool over their eyes and pretend that everything is fine. It is fine during the day, if the hungover get to class, but by night it is a whole different ball game. The administration should go undercover. Each of them should live in a · resi_dence hall for a week, and then they would see the true light of Union. Take a freshman hall for example: there are more bottles and beer cans if! their recycling bins than anything else, but how many are really the legal drinking age? Secondly, freshmen tend to be the most anxious to experi- ment with alcohol and build up their tolerance for the years ahead. When· they end up at the hospital and find out their blood alcohol level they real-. ize that it will make a great drinking story. All they really get for punish- ment is a slap on the hand and a letter to Mommy and Daddy; counseling is not required at all. Alcohol is plaguing Union and other schools. People's judgment is the first thing to go, so they don't realize that ripping out the smoke alarm or kicking in a door is a bad thing. When Union drunks come home, they put everyone at risk. Whether or not they are a sloppy, vie lent or emotional drunk, they'll demand some attention, and guess who gets that job the Resi- dent Assistants. RAs have taken on a new role that is clearly out of their league. No training at all could prepare them for the modern job. In the past, all RAs had to worry about was late curfews and helping with homesickness, but today they put themselves on the line to deal with some potentially danger- ous drunks. In light of what has recently happened at Purdue University, where a Resident Assistant was shot and killed for reporting drugs in the residence hall, Union should really ~econsider their own policies regarding alcohol and other drugs, and think about who the enforcers should be. Is it fair tQ ask RAs to bust a drunk or a druggie? Wake up Union. ''The administration says they don't want to be cops because the students are adults, but they are not. Union students do not know how to treat alcohol, and not many adults tlaunt their drinking quite like the students at this school. They take pride in how much liquor they can hold. They ought to take a little more pride•in themselves, and the school should not contiue to be practice venue to train the alcoholics of the future. ~~ The Student Newspaper of Union f.~~) College Since 1877 ~~~ 5 ~~ Schenectady's Oldest Newspaper ~ ~ 1M ll ~ ~y, Adrian MacLean, Anthony C.

However, the requirements suggested for this program seem to defeat its purpose .. Students will be required to complete a two part history sequence in conjunction with two related literature courses, or a literature and civilization combination. These three required courses are limited to a specific period in history. Students must complete the two year courses by the end of their second year. Professor Christina Sorum, who is a member ofthe SubcouncH on the Curriculum, believes that there wiU not be a probl!;:m with staffing these new cla.sses. She stated that history may get one new tenure position. With approximately 500 Freshman attempting to enter into the. three possible · history tracks, it seems likely that many students will be shut out ·Of their desired history course. Even now students are often shut out of courses they want. Th.is problem will only get worse if more tenure positions are not created. Suppose a student was sh\}t out .of their history sequence .. They would be pressured by the tilnr;:.limit on the history requirement to begin another history sequence. The Genera:! Education Curriculum is riddled with technical problems. Instead of ~evolutionizing the curriculum, the Go.llege should cl)ncerttrate on i,ll1proving the eJdsting Liber&l Learning program. Liberal Learning reqLJ.irements could be enforced, ass \iring that stude.nts attain a balanced education. The credit categories which are designated to classes could. be reevalua!ed and if necessary, courses could be restruGtured.-These changes would fulfiUthe purpose' of the ge.llerai education cllrriculum witl10ut drastically limiting course selection freedom. This would also avoid many of th~ complications arid prQblems involved in Lntroducing a new, unpolished system. Editorial Board Professors u·n comfortable with Use of the F -Word Dear Editor: In our opinion· the letter head- lined \Pig Power Trip\ in the Concordiensis of October 17 is emblematic of a coarseness that is. endemic in the America of the 1990's. Referring to an R.A., a fellow student,. in public print as \'a pig\ and a \filthy animal\ is sihlplytoo\ close to a ballplayer's spitting in an,-umpire'·s face in a public place. Neither act has any place in a civilized community. Criticizing th~ behavior of R.A. 's or other fellow students can, of course, constitute appro- priate behavior. Belittling, de- meaning, and insulting others is not appropriate behavior, whether the targets are R..A. 's or Schenectadians who are too of- ten dismissed as \'Ooids\ by some Unionstudents. Likewise, using language ·offensive to passers-by, visitors who are tourin:g the cam- pus, and others should be out of bounds. Mr. Rock's [Lopez's] \f@#k\ is the leading example. Perhaps we all should heed the advice given by Pulitzer Prize winning historian, David McCulloch, wheri he delivered our Commencement Address two years ago: Let's do something about public education. · Let's stop the mindless destruction of historic America. Let's clean up our rivers and skies, and while we're at it, let's clean up our language- private and public .. ; · All of us nave been guilty of thoughtless acts th-at we later, sometimes much later, realize were wrong. We ask that Mr. Lopez reflect upon what he has d()ne. We believe that he owes an apology to \the R.A. on the second fl.oor of Davidson South.\ We hope that upon re- f1ection he will agree with us.

Werner Professor- Chemistry Students Praised For Reaching Out To Local Children As a SUNY alum of the class of'80, my college experience did not include Greek life as a signifi- cant component of campus cul- ture. \Frats\ were not thought to be cool. Jimmy Carter was Presi- dent and Framptom Comes Alive was heard blaring from every -dorm room.window. Soon after that, the movie \Animal House\ was released and the pubiic's vie'Y of fraternity life was forever focused on Bluto screaming, ''food fight!\ l am genuinely surprised, there- fore, to find myself praising fra- ternities/sororities to anyone for anything. However, as I look back at my first six months at Big Brothers Big Sisters, it is abun· dantly obvious to me .that the vol- unteers and special events sup- ported by Greek organizations have played a major role in Big Brothers Big Sisters successfu·lly reaching out to kids in this com- munity. In particular, I would like to express my appreciation on be- half of Big Brothers Big Sisters to IFC President Ben Fox and FIJI's Garrett DiStefano as well as their brothers ahd sisters who worked so hard for qs. The voJ- unteers a11d support generated by Union's \Bigs\, the Youth Olym- pics, the Volleyball Tournament, andso many other campus-spon- s<Jred activities allow us to reach ltundreds of local children.

However~ the Joss was not indicative of the team's over .. all play. The Skating Dutchmen showed throughoutthe game that they Will be a stronger team this year and that new Coach Stan Moore's style, combined with th:e team's hard work, will produce . some goals and wins. Union came out of the gate vis- ibly fired up to start the game. TheDutchmen foiWards came out takingthebody, enabling them to keep the puck in the Wildcats' de- fensive zone. Uni{)n had a few strong scoring chances early but were unable to convert on any of them. The Skating Dutchmen forecheck proved to be strong as the line of Eric Houle, centering for Craig Reckin, and Jamie Antoine forced the puck deep in.to the UNH zone. All throughout the period, Union dominatea the· play and forced the young New Hampshi:re defense to play to their fullest potential. The Dutch- men _defense was also strong dur- ing that firststanza~ holdingUNH to five total shats in the first pe- riod, witli none in the first five JTiinutes. However, the Wildcats brdke through and scored two goals on junior goaltender Trevor Koenig to take the lead 2~0 at the first intermission. Unionbegan the second period much like they had the first, .tak- ing the body and forcing the puck de.ep into ·the New Hampshire zone. The Dutchmen's quick, crisp.,. passes and pi·nching defenseJ;Tietl, something never seen under former Coach Delventhal, opened up a scoring opportunity with 12:27Ieft in.the second period. Senior assistant captain RyanD~novancarried the puck down the IJoards into the New Hampshire zone, where he dropped it off to sophomore Brent Ozarowski. Ozarowski found a breaking John Sicinski, who rock~ eted the puck past UNH goaltender Brian Larochelle. Donovan commented on the im- portance of crisp passes and the goal; ~aying, \John Brent, and I, as well as the whole team, have been working on our passes for three weeks straight. Th(lt was just an exampleofhatd work pay- ing off. Tape-to-tap.e passing can accomplish a lot for a team.;' Later in the perio.d, Union showed that hard work in the cor- ners can also ac.complish much. The line of Chris Ford, Ryan Campbell, and Charlie Moxham proved this, as they fought for the .puck deep behind the New Hampshire net. Ford gained con- trol of the puck and fought his way to_ the right side of Larochelle's crease. Keeping the puck away from a diving Larochelle, Ford sent the puck jnto the crease where Moxham and Campbell fought for it against two UNH .defenders. Campbell eventually poked it home for his {irst collegiate goal_ at 5:05, cutting the New Hamp- shire lead to 3~2. UNH had gone up 3-2, scoring on a delayed pen- alty. The third period saw more of- fense from Union, created by defensemen moving in from the blue-line to keep the puck in the Wildcats' zone. The Dutchmen missed some opportunities late in the period to tie the ga:rne,_and the game ended with the Du~chmen losing 3-2. Coach Moore is a strong proponent ·Of the allowing the defensemen to joirt in the of- fensive rush as long as a forward covers for him at the blue-line. \We wanted our defensemen to help in the offense. If it looked like we were getting more puck time in their end, whether there was a shot or not, it was because we try to apply more pressure to the puck,\ said Moore. . The Du~chmen p.lay their first home series this weekend against · Providence and Merrimack, both · non-; league opponents. BETWEEN THE PIPES Senior cente-r Patrick O'F.laherty sat out the game serving his one~game suspension for his role i11>a fight against Yale in the last game of the I 995-96 season. Goaltender Trevor Koenig recorded 18 saves. Ea- ger to take advantage of Coach · Moore's style of allowing the defensemen to join in the offense, Senior defenseman Seabrook Satterlund registered four shots in the opening period. Senior . Chad Thompson was a healthy· scratch for the Dutchmen. X-C Primed and· Ready for Post-Season by Jason Everett Staff Writer After this past weekend off from competition, the Union men's and women's Cross~Coun­ try teams will compete in the State Championships and NCAA Divi- sion III Regional Championships over the next two weekends. Both teams travel to Mendom Pond Park in Rochester, New York this coming weekend for the New York State Championships. The men will run the usual8,000 meters (5 miles); while the women will race 5,000 meters (3 .1 miles). Both 'teams will travel with I 0 runners, although only seven count for scoring purposes. This is definitely the most experienced sqi)ad Union has had in recent memory, and expectations are high among team members for outstanding performances and team finishes. Competing for the women's squad are: Kelly Jamieson, jun-. ior; Captain Sara Morse, senior; Charity McManaman, sopho- more; Suzanne Hoyer, freshman; Katie MacDowell, sophomore; Sara Mcintosh, senior;. Molly Hood, sophomore; Maura Calloo, freshman; Emily Morse, sopho- more; and Mellissa Magner, freshman .. · The women's squad looks to continue its domination over RPI and will attempt to catch the pow- erful Hamilton squad for the first time this year. The women's squad currently has two key run- ners wjth injuries, which they will be mending in the coming days. Mcintosh is currently nursing a hip injury, and Hoyer is dealing with a chronic knee injury, which she has had through the season. .Senior Captain Sarah Morse, in her final year here at Union, was in jeopardy of not making the Union top seven, but showed the true qualities of a veteran leader with her performance at the Al- bany Invitational two weeks ago to ll}ake the squad. Her experi- ence will be needed to lead the young squad in the post-season when the squad faces tougher competition from across the state. Junior Kelly Jamieson has been juggling the grueling training schedule of both swimming and cross-country practices these past weeks and will again look to leaq the women's squad. Jamieson, who started the s-eason slowly coming off summer knee surgery, has regained her old form to· be the number one finisller for the women's team these past few meets. In addition to two seniors and one Junior on the women's squad, the impact of freshman standouts Suzanne Hoyer, Mellissa Magner, arid Maura Culloo have been invaluable this past season. For the male harriers, this post- season will certainly be a chance UC·AA Update Courte~y of the Sports Information Department UCAA Football Honor Roll: Ryan Smith,. Junior Caught six pasees for 85 yards including a 56 yard scoring pass. UCAA Field Hockey Honor Roll: Rachel Rothschild Had nine saves in a triple overtime loss to Hartwick, and had 45 saves in a triple 0vertime loss to Springfield. Union was out shot 66-10 in the game. Rachel is curently ranked 3rd amongst UCAA goaltenders. . to firmly establish themselves as a t.eam of not only the future; but also the present .. The men's squad is made up of Peter Flynn, sopho- more; Captain Nicholas Conway, s~nior; Jay Goldberg.,· junior; Dave Kunselman, junior; Steve McCann, senior; Hugh Meyer, sophomore; Kenny Scott, fresh- man; Will Morris, junior; Mike Iger, freshman; and Jon Zandman, sophomore. Senior Nick Conway is coming off of a breakthrough perfor- mance two weekends ago at the Albany Invitational, where he ran a personal best of 26:52. Conway's performance is even more impressive when consider- ing Conway's \unique\ running form. The second member of the dynamic duo, Peter Flynn, is coming offa cramping injury at Albany and an incredible finish of26:57 done two weeks ago at Saratoga State Park. In addition, Kunselman's sea- son-long psycho intense training has paid huge dividends in the past few meets.· McCann contin- ues to run consistently and will be a key finisher for tpe Union squad these next two meets. Goldberg is coming off a gutsy performance at Albany to finish as second man for the male harri- ers. He has recently adopted the Peter Flynn pool training system to reduce the stress on a pinched nerve injury in his foot incurred 4 weeks ago. Kunselman is also dealing with a foot injury but should be back to form come States and Regional's. In addi- tion, Scott has been running well despite a recurring Achilles/calf injury which has plagued him all season. The following weekend is the NCAA Division HI Regional Qualifiers, which. are being held at the Community College of Fin- ger Lakes in Canadaigua, New York. Head Coach Charlie Casey, and women's coach, Union graduate Liza Morse plan on us.ing the next two weeks as a \tune-up\ for the men's and women's squads for the upcom- ing meets. Coach Casey is look- ing forward to states for the men to \pay-back\ a few schools. Hamilton is currently ranked sev- enth in the state, ahead of Union. Union has beaten Hamilton head- to-head in every contest this year, except once when the men were . not at full strength. The male har- riers are also looking to put a hurt- ing on the weaker Vasser squad who ran the collective race of their dreams at Albany, to finish ahead of Union. Expectations on the team are indeed high for the post-season, but with some savvy running from the veteran men's squad and key leadership from some female runners, the Union team may have breakthrough .performances these next two weeks to cap off the season.

T~ree of their opponents were nationally ranked and the Dutchwomen understood, that a strong team effort would be nec- essary to finish the season above the .500 mark. and on the turf, the ball moved quickly. Goaltender Rothschild was the story of the game, mak- ing thirty-?m~ jiayes in regulation time, stopping a barrage of shots from .~11 angles.,. The . UniQn of- The Dutchwornen put up a for- midable effort against nationally ranked Williams, but wound up falling to the fast team 2-0. Wil- liams was very fast on offense both with and without the ball, getting past the Union defense. Goaltender Rachel Rothschild played an excellent game, turn- ing away numerous attempts by the Williams offense. The sec- ond half proved more difficult for the Dutchwomen as the defense began to fatigue and Rothschild was called on to make some clutch saves.. Overall, Union played a hard defensive game. Senior Autumn Cohen com- mented that the team played well against a nationally ranked team. \Considering what we were up against, I think we played an ex- cellent game,\ she said.

Rothschild's save count of forty-five Was a personal record. The io'ss ended the Dutchwomen's regular season placing them at 6th place out of 1 8 teams with a 8-7 record over- all and a 4-2 record in the UCAA. The Dutchwomen moved on to play an easier team as they faced off against Oswego on Frank Bailey field. Union quickly over~ powered Oswego, as Katie Gross scored a goal in the first four min- utes of the game. Gross contin- ued her offensive tear, scoring on a deflection later in the game. Sophomore sweeper. Tara Blagys scored on a beautiful corner, as she dribbled the ball over the twenty-five yard line and blasted it past the Oswego keeper for her first goal of the season and her first tally at Union. \It was exc.it- ing and there was a moment of doubt that went through everyone's mind because the ref- erees first called the goal off. After a discussion, they indeed said it was a goal, so the excite- ment came back,\ said an excited Blagys. The Dutchwomen completed their season on the road against Union Ruggers Finish Season Fighting the Law by Matt Lux Staff Writer Yes, indeed that time is at hand when Union's ruggers tearfully begin to strip the multiple layers · of mud and blood from their limbs, and gaze back on yet an- other season spent upon the pitch. Union's season, which officially ended with last week's victory over Clarkson, was extended by the Smokin' Dutchmen's. entry into the Albany Law School tour- nament. Union, hampered by in- juries and Parent's Weekend/ Homecoming defections, as well as the loss of notable quotables Pike \Rochester and back!\ Mody and Brian \He put the star in All-star\ Field to the Eastern Select AU-Star team. Nonethe- less, Union managed to put to- gether a determined group of I 6 players for the journey to Lincoln Park, where they first faced off against the Berkshire Men's Club. Union began the game in prom- ising fashion, driving resolutely down the field and maintaining position deep within Berkshire's side of the field. However, Union's attempts to drive the older Berkshire team into retire- ment failed as Berkshire declared they were still too damn young for Medicare and proceeded to prove it by using their age and considerable experience to teach the Dutchmen, many of whom were still in their first season, a lesson in controlled \smart rugby.\ This lesson, like any bad class. lasted far too long, and Union found itself faced with a sizeable deficit. Fortunately, fair olde Union's team proved that it had not. contrary to popular be- lief, been playing the game asleep, and managed to score some extra credit by taking the ball down the field for a beauti- ful try scored by Heath \MightyMouse\ Levine, after as~ sistance from almost the entire Union team. Chris \Marathon Man'' Delano provided admir~ble support from fullback, and Union almost scored another try, but alas, time ran out, and the Berk- shires were able to prov~ that in- deed, age does come before beauty. Next, Albany Law was simi- larly defeated by Berkshire, and the time came for the rematch of Union University (yes, Albany Law is \related\ to us, like that \funny\ uncle whose lap you were never supposed to sit on). Albany Law was still smarting from a 40-0 pasting at a previous scrimmage by the Nott, and de- cided to try to take advantage of ·the fact that much of Union's A- side was missing (Union was fur_. ther hurt by injuries in the first game against Berkshire). Albany came out determined to break the law-and Union-but forgot to count on the fact that the Dutch- men always play better when they can smell blood, even if it is their own. Admirable hitting was led by Eric \With intent to injure\ Menard and Matt \The Superwrap\ Scheller, who joy- ously moved to wing forward from wing after the first game. Union's serum consistently knocked Albany offthe ball, and the line played extremely well, with crafty super-veteran Billy \(Can we still call him) The Kid\ Ackerbauer and similarly balding senior Matt \I'd Rather be a Cen- ter\ Lux leading a well-balanced attack, supported by sterling run- ning by Tom \Tiff sew my jer- sey\ Burke and great first half play by Brett \Disembow]er\ Lussier.

Chris Delano ran through his third game like a Water Buffalo with wings, and Scr~m Captain Alex \The only word is Smooooooth\ Douville survived being impaled in the first game to run a well-disciplined pack in the second. The game ended after an Albany Law back's trash-talking was halted by ;:tn ef- fective, if somewhat crimson, counterpoint by Union's back- line, and Union finished the. game, and the season, bold and unbowed.

Sico1te Staff Writer The women's soccer tearri firt- ished tlleir regular season with a win and a tie, which was enough to give them a berth in tht\ state tournarnent with a recor.ef of 8-6- 1. This young team is headed into tne toumament looking to prove tlleir ability and their talent They certainly proved their tal- ent to Russell Sage. Despite a scoreless first half, they dearly dominated the Sage players. The offense ran smoothly and effi- ciently, and the defense was un- re1entil1g, denying Sage even a shot <Jll goal. Between Sarah · Rett~rs<lorf in the first half, and ShannCJn Powers in ·th.e second, the two goalies just touched the ball a tdal of three times. Head- ing. :int4C half-time, though, the SC<Jre remained tied. As USt~;al, the Dutchwomen came out t() win jt in the second half. Less than two minutes into the half, freshman phenotn Abby Harris stepped up and fired the baH on net. ()nly to seethe Sage keeper come trpwith a huge save. Sarah Cardullo found the rebound and sllct the ball int() a half open net, to put the Dutchwomen ott top .. This is a farnili.ar combination- Cardullo and H~rris are tied f()r the Dutchwomen Scoring Leader with 13 points apiece. Bllt Harris wasn't done. Ten minutes later, she. re(;eived the ball at midfield, beat one defender, and slipped a precision pass through the de- fense to a streaking Samantha Ryall. Ryall controlled the baiJ and frred.a shot past tile Sage keeper, into the lower le~ corner of tile .net. After the second goal, Union settled back and played dominating defense, continually denying Sage opportunities. Sat- isfied, the Duchwomen traveled to Oneonta looking to finish their regular season with a four game win streak. Unfortunately, Oneonta had different plans. Oneonta will be hosting the State Championship game, and Union was looking to familiarize themselves with the fiel<l in hopes of oqce again visiting it for the Championship. On paper, the two tea,rns were evenly matched a11<1 tlte play during the game proved tilis to be true. Despite consis- tently poor calls by the referees, it was a great game, played well by both teams. The offensive surges of both teams flowed back and forth, but neither team's of~ fense was able to getthe ball into the net. The defense of both teams played huge games; they con- st~ntly made enormous plays that squelched the other teams chances. Union's defense played unbelievably, easily playing their best game of the season. Fresh- man Mindy Cohen had the best game of her young career. She shut down Oneonta's leading scorer throughout the game, and helped to stymie their aggressive offense. Cohen and the entire de- fense chose a perfect time of the season to step it up and play well. Heading into the tournament, they are going to need steady play from the defense in order to re- main competitive. They are also going to need their offense to play well and put some balls into the net if they are going to make progress in the tourn~ment. Plattsburgh is their first opponent of the post season, and we will soon see if this young team has the ability to perform under pres- 'I I

With four coaches, twenty vet- erans, and ten rookies, the team is ready to start the season with a bang. Coaches in'clude Tim BensQ!n, head coach,. Lowell Mulkins and Jeff St. Vrain, assis- tant coaches,. and Clark Smyth, goalie coach. Six home games and thirteen away games have al- ready been scheduled, with com- petitors including teams such as Umass Amherst, Holy Cross, Sa- cred Heart, Colgate, RPI, Will- iams, MIT, Skidmore, ·and Bos- ton University. · The past few years have been building blocks to this season and up and coming seasons.
