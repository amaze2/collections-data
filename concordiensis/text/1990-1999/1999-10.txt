Buffalo wings and pizza were served to begitl the night's activi- ties, and at around 7 PM the trivia questions commenced. Raffle tickets were handed out at the door, and later numbers were called to determine who would vie forone of the featured prizes. The two people who were ,lucky enough to have had the tickets chosen, approached the winner's table, piled high with an assortment of goodies, which consisted of pop- com, pretzels, and videotapes. The prizes were given to whoever could answer a question correctly. Some of the questions were met with more difficulty than others, espe- cially those concerning the sport . of ice dancing posed to two men who were apparently clueless about the subject! For the most part, the questions were fair but ad- equately challenging. Friday's presentation marked one of the frrst times that alcohol was served at a Program Assis- tants gathering. In exchange for a flash of a driver's license, those who were over twenty-one could enjoy alcoholic refreshments served at a cash bar in the upper level of Old Chapel However, there was a slight catch, with the Program Assistants frrst attempt at serving alcohol in the school yearofl999-2000. They wanted students of all ages to come to Trivia Night, but didn't want the attendance to ]Je based solely upon the presence of alcohol. This made advertising for the event a difficult task. The words \Happy Hour\ could not be seen on the posters which were scattered about campus. Over all, the serv- ing of drinks was a success and may precedent a future presence of alcohol at social events. The Program Assistants are hoping to hold more of such events, however the disappointing turnout might discourage them from doing so. Program Assistant Liz Kaier noted, \It [the Happy Hour] could be something really fun for every- one. It is a great idea. The drinks were relatively inexpensive but, the event was not centered around al- cohol. I hope that more people will attend the next time we plan some- thing like this.\ Being that this coming weekend is Parents Weekend, there have been no programs scheduled by the Program Assistants. However, the following weekend there will be a drive-in movie shown in the park- ing lot near Sigma Chi for 1he fea- tured PA event. People will be able to sit in their cars and listen to the movie ontheir radios beca11se it will be broadcast by way of the school station. Those underprivileged stu- dents, like freshmen who do not have cars, can bring portable ra- dios to tune in to the movie. Once again it sounds as though P A will be providing an enjoyable program fo:r all.

The station then .promises to get in touch with the government about the issues raised. Many people wanted to clarify the difference between what Chin.a was while Moa Zedong was in charge from 1949 and what China has been going through since his death in 1975. Overall, it seems that most felt that 1949 was the turning point when China decided that it was going to radically change it's government. Since 1975, the Revo- lution has been more of a Reform period. Changes are being made to effect the way of life, but they are much more gradual. One student from China said that we must \have patience.\ China will one day have all of the access the rest of the world does, but it will, of course, take time. In the past few years, Union has been in close contact with China. That can be seen by the number of professors from China teaching here, and our term abroad program there. Many students at Union take courses in Chinese language, history, and culture. Several students who had been on the term abroad noticed the dif- ference between the picture many Americans have of China and what it actually is. One student pointed out that people are not afraid of expressing themselves about the government. .He surpmed up Chi- nese government after fifty years ofthe People's Repyplic ofChina as \Capitalism with a Chinese fla- vor. , Rap Music Integrated in Classroom by Gina Campaaella · Staff Writer '· · , On the frrst day of on introduc- tory course to Cultural A.ntbropol- ogy, the last thing one expects to see is a tap video. However, students in Professor Ian Condry's class wouldprobably disagree. In his flrst class this fall, Pmfessor Condry presented \You Better Listen Up\ to his students. The video was a compilaiion ofhis research gathered for hi:s doctoral dissertation. Professor Condry attended Harvard University as an· under- graduate and it was th{);se under- graduate years that frrst il)troduced him to rap music. Condry studied Japmese cul- ture and language in C()llege and lived in Japan sevenil times be- tween receiving his m!lsters and then his doctorate from Yale Uni- versity. After his education was com- plete, he then took his Fullbright Fellowship in Japan. He completed two years of research on. Japanese music with most of his data being gathered in nightclubs and record- ing studios. His doctoral dissert11tion was '.,. I. . :.o titled, .\Japanese Rap Music: An ·.',Ethnography of Globalization in ;Popular Culture.'\- His interest in this topic was based \How culture can flow across national and eth- nic boundaries.\ In an interview with Kristin Zadotltian, Professor Condry ex- plained the basic differences and similarities between Western Rap and Japanese Rap. Japanese Rap and Western Rap .m:e similar because they share the same two basic genres. Party rap is generally more lighthearted and more popular with young teenage girls. Underground rap focuses on more .controversial issues and is generally more popular with older males. Underground rap is a key ~ element of Japanese Rap because of the way that it has allowed the youth to speak out. It is not that unusual in the United States to )lave young adults voicing their opinions and being heard. However, the Japa- nese youth has had no voice for quite sometime in their culture. Therefore, Japanese rap uses its boldness as a forum to express im- portant issues to the youth of Ja- pan. This explains the one signi:fj- cant difference between Western Rap and Japanese Rap. Western Rap usually concen- b;ates on violence and drugs and other negative aspects of our cul- ture, often glamorizing these is- sues. Japanese Rap tries to high- light important issues and get the basic messages behind these is- sues out to its listeners. The rnessages are much more socially and culturally challenging. Professor Condry describes Japa- nese Rap as a \prayer for the next generation.\

This is definitely a uniqlte idea, but has the potential to be a great suc- cess. Surprisingly, the trolley that has been purchased was actually used in C'al if()rnia alittle while ago, but in just a few short weeks it will be transpmting Union students around campus. The idea origin a ted last spring when Bill Sicki11ger. Director of Campus Safety, was discussing the transportation dilemmas and such desperate need for improvement with Dean Alford. Evidently, Dean Alford came up with the sugges- tion ofhaving a trolley service. Not only would this eliminate the abuse and overuse of escort as a personal taxi service, but it would also ac- commodate a fair amount of people. After some investigation, Bob Tomeck of Campus Safety pur- chased a former beach tro1ley from California. He decided that this spacious 24-passenger trolley would nicely suit our n.eeds. It is roughly twice the size.of the large vans currently used on campus. Presently. it is being painted, newly carpeted and spiffed-up for its de- but at lJnjon.

The service runs from 6 PM to 2 AM Sunday through Thursday and 6 PM to 4 AM on Friday and Saturday. In addition to the \inner route,\ per- taining to areas directly surround- ing Union's campus, there will also be an \outer route.;, This route, which will only take place once per hour, will include the Schenectady Train and Bus Stations, Pric·e Chopper, Rotterdam Mall, and Ellis Hospital. Presently, the shuttle bus seems to be getting a fair amount of at- tention. The ultimate goal of this project is to provide safe, efficient transportation during the evening hours by catering to students liv- ing on campus as well as those in the surrounding area. Hopefully, the trolley will alleviate the park- ing nightmares on campus and eliminate students putting them- selves at immediate physicaltisk if · Write for Concordiensis News section.

Starting at noon and ending at 4 PM, the Career Devel- opment Center hosted their twenty-first annual career festival. Yet, the well organized and impres- sive appearance of the Fieldhouse only presented a small portion of the time and work that the Career Development Center put into this year's Career Festival. Before the first Union student entered the field house ·On Thurs- day, the CDC was in the back- ground making sure that the Ca- reer Festival was more than snnply employment opportunities. They wanted to ensure that Union Col- lege would be well-represented at this event. Jn addition to the time that the CDC spent preparing the Fieldhouse, they also prepared the students for the events of the day. The staff hoped that with their prepanHions, Union students could walk into the field house knowing what to expect from the employers and how to best explain themselves to the companies who attended the event. The Career Festival hosted \over 525 students. It was one of the most successful Career festi,.. vals in Union history,\ stated a representative of the CDC. The Career Development Cen- ter tried to .attract representatives fto:nl many different businesses .this year. The list ranged from non- profit organizations to well-known brand names in businesses. After att~ndi.ng the Festival, a freshman noted, \At first I felt a little weird being there, after all I am only a freshmen and I ques- tioned what I was actually doing at a Career Festival, but I think it helped me get a better perspec- tive on what I may want to major in.\ The CDC stresses that the ser~ vices it offers as well as the pm- grams that it sponsors \are. not just for seniors.

From8:00AMuntil3:00PM, the bmthers of Phi Delta Theta helped to dismantle a concert hut at the Schenectady museum offNott Ter- race. To do this, the brothers uti- lized sledgehammers as well as crowbars. President of Phi Delta Theta David Polizzi noted, \Destroying things is fun, especially when it is for a good cause. The brothers did a great job.\ The goal for the day was to ob- tain usable lumber that the Habitat for ilumanity could use in the reno- vation and building of houses in the Schenectady area for those people who are in need. Many ofthe brothers in Phi Delta Theta are not new contributors to Habitat for Humanity; many have been past volunteers in both the College and high school setting. Community Service Chainnain Josh Kahn noted, \The eff()rt of the brothers was outstanding. It was super to .see everyone work- ing together. We hope to do it again in the near future. Schenectady de- serves our help and we are happy to partake.\ The efforts for that day were nu- merous because enough building material was collected to renovate one of the houses on which Habi- tat for Humanity .of Schenectady is currently working. Both the members ofPhi Delta Theta and the volunteers of Habitat for Human- ity had fun working together and look forward to working with each other in the near future. Phi Delta Theta also is working with the Special Olympics in a bowl- ing contest that will be planned in the next several weeks.

Yet, not all were as pleased with the Career Festival. As one .senior commented, \There are a lot of dif- ferent businesses at the Festival, but not a lot of difference in those businesses. Some majors were not even represented at the Career F es- tival and that is really frustrating if you are in one ofthose majors.\ The Career Development Center was very pleased with the way that the Festival turned ()Ut. Yet, the fes- tival is not the last of the CDC's plans for Union. They have a packed calendar, which ranges from on-campus recruiting to re- sume referrals. After 10 years .of studying the autlwr's life Frazier h~s compiled his 'life into the fustbiograph y writ- ten about George Moore. The Bi- ography will be published by . spring 2000 by Yale University · Press, London. Frazier's passion is in Irish lit- erature. He chose to write a biog- raphy about George Moore be- cause he is one of the 'last Irish authors that has not been written abo11t. The last Irish literary fig- ure written about was in 1936. Frazier will be showing slides of illustrations from his book in his colloquium of paintings and por- traits be -chose to use fit into Moore's life. He will als() be ex- plaining h()W the paintings were often objects of public c.ommen- tary amd how they were d.esc.ribed in ways of repr.esenting Moore's character. Moore, born .in 1852, was a prominent:l'rish writer from the late 1800s to the beginning o:f the 1900s. He published his first novel, A Modern Lover in 1883. Other major works followed suoh as A Mumnw··.s Wifepublishedin 1885 Esther Waters in 1894 and his au- tobiography Confessioms of a Young Ma12 in 1888. Moore be- came involved in ~the Irish literary Renais.sanceduring which time he wrote hi:s three volume autobiog- raphy, Hail and FarewelJ which were published between I '911-14. Moore dies shortly thereafter in 1933. Today in the RCC auditorium at 11:30 AM come out and support your colJeague, Adrian Fr:azier as he presen.ts his biography to the faculty. See you all there! Students Suspended for Rape by Jim DeWan News Editor During the 1998-1999 academic year, two Union students were sus• pended from the College after be- ing found guilty of non-consentual sex under the College's laws on sexual misconduct. <hle of the rap- ists was suspended after the Fall term of 1998, while the second was suspended at the en<! of Spring of 1999. One rapist was suspended for one year, while the other was suspended for two years. Dean of Students Fred Alford refused to specify which rapist received which sentence. The second rap- ist, who committed the crimes in Spring of 1999, raped two victims. In each case the victim knew the rapist, and the crimes were de- scribed as \date rape,\ or '\acquain- tance rape,\ accordrng to Director of Campus Safety Bill Sickinger. To return to Union, the two rap- ists must serve their suspensions and fulfill a number of require- . ments, including counseling and then petition the Dea11 of Students office. In both cases, the victims chose to press charges. In each case, they chose to use the college's avenues for prosecuting rapes, conduct charges were filed and the Schenectady Police De- partment was not inv()lved. When students press cond11ct charges, they have two options: either opt for their case to be heard thro11gh the Student Conduct Committee ors through an administrative re- view. Each case was tried tlrrough administrative review. During the calendar years of 199g and 1999, four rapes were re- ported to Campus Safety. One rape from 1998 stemmed from an earlier incident and charges were n<Jt pressed. The other rape from 1998 ended in the suspension at tbe en.d ofFalll998. The two rapes in 1999 ended in the suspension at the end of Spring 1999. There were no rapes repmted during the calendar year of 1996 or 199'7. In 19()5, a non-Union student raped one student in an off-campus apartment. The issue came to the forefront when President Roger Hull men- ti<Jned the suspension of the two rapists during Pizza with the Presi- dent with the Orientation Advisors on Monday, September 27. Hull was surprised that no one else knew of the suspensions. Accord- ing t() Hull, it was the first time he had brought the subject up. Hull explained, .. I was concerned about .any rape issues with the students.\ Hull later told the faculty of the suspension of the two students at a faculty meeting on Thursday, September 30. Hull was surprised no one else knew of the suspen- sions. The report of the rapes ap- peared in tfle Union College Cam- pus Safety \A Report to the Com- munity,\ a pamphlet published by Campus Safety and distributed t() all students. When as:ked about what 11le ad- ministration does to preveatt rape on this cl1Il1pus, Hull, AlfeP:cl, and Sickinger pointed to the mandatory 0 A sessio,n for freslunen fea:tur:ing Katie Koestn:er, a rape awaieness speaker. When asked if they thought ltlley could do more, Hull and Alford flsked what students thought tile administrations hcmld be doing. All three stressed that alcDhol is almost always involved in raP'e si1u- ations on campus and pointted to numerous alcohol awaneness speakers and seminars on campus. Sickinge:r agreed. \We can a !ways do more,\ he said, but had n() plans to take further measures. Alford noted that each year, every student receives a pamphlet, outlinimg the college's~exual assault policy, and said he plans to bring in a tlleater company to inform students about the dang-ers 0 f sexual miscommu- nication and sexual assault. Hull continue d., sa:ying, \I don't think there's any magic bullets (tolix the problem). I don't know if tfuere' s any specifi<: thing we're doing. We're ta:lking about it and we're not hiding it.\ ·::~ ..

Page 6 ·October 7,1999 • QrmhiEnsis Few Employment Opportunities Last Thursday, Union College hosted _its annual Career Festival. For the week leading up to this event, the school was covered with fliers reminding students to mark their calendars, for the Career Festival was on its way. Seniors raced around that week preparing resumes, dry clean- ing suits and dresses and generally trying to meet all the requirements that the Career Development Center set up for them.. All of a sudden, before anyone knew it, the magical day was upon us. It was Career . Festival Day, a day that promised graduating seniors a chance to find a successful future. Upon entering the Union College Field House one was greeted with a list of the eighty participating Employers and Schools. The seniors were ready to embark on .their journeys and select their future careers. For some people, the only reason for gQing to the Festival was due to the fact that the CDC kept claiming that this event was \For All Stu- dents.\ Therefore, many attended becau:se they figured that as typical students the Career Festival would have something to offer them. They were sadly mistaken. Upon entering the field house, one was asked to sign in, and then given a diagram of where each of the participants were located within the Field House. The entire building was :filled end to end with possible futures for the bright and shining studen1s who went there on that day to make something of their pending degrees. It was at this point that the wool was pulled away from the eyes .of true students who had decided to attend. The Career Development Center had misinformed the student body! The Festival was not for everyone; ifone was not an Engineer, an Economics Major or a Computer Scientistthen be or she was out ofluck because the majority of the participating .employers only wanted these members of our graduating population. Out of the forty-eight participat- ing employers, only ten had were not related to the aforementioned majors. If Investment Banking is your f()rte then the Festival was the place for you to be. However, iflnvestment Banking is not in your future. then hopefully you had other plans lined up before this event. For other students, this was not a maj>Or issue because they had at- tended the event in search of a graduate program. These unfortunate students also encountered ()bstacles. Thirty-five graduate schools had signed on to attend the.prestigious Fes\ti'Val. However, ten of these~. schools wanted students who were'onl'y':int~rested in Joini.ng the ever-·; growing ranks of lawyers.rEigh;t of these schools .wanted students who~ felt that they were best suited to become doctors or other members of~ the field of medicine. Fifty-one percent of the Graduate schools that attended dealt with either medicine or law. What about all the other fields that students might want to study? Iftl10se fields interested you, fortune was not on your side. It is no longer a Career Festival; it ha:s become an engineering and financial festival for those who want to j()in the business world. It has also become an outlet for the future lawyers and doctors in this country. What about all the future teachers, historians, public officials, actors and actresses and even joumalists? Where were the jobs and the schools for them?

At issue within the party today, however, is the inter- nalbickering that may cost Ventura a legitimate run for the White Ho11se. 111 November's issue of Playboy Martazine Ventura, in an interview, ga-ve his opinion on a number of topics ranging from religion to the as:Sassination of President Kennedy. According to the Associated Press, he is quoted as saying, \Or- gallized religion is a sham and a crut<;h for weak-minded people who need strength in numbers. It tells people to go oat and stick their noses in other people's business.\ Ventura recently has clarified his stand on religion, saying, accord- ing to AP; that he d<>es not need it, but does not fault those who do. In the interview, Ventura goes on to blame the death of President Kelllledy on assassins, and when asked who hired them, replied, \If you truly want to know, I believe we did, the military-industrial com- plex. I believe Kennedy was going to withdraw us from Vietnam, and there were factions that didn't want that.\ Ventura's comments were not well accepted by outgoing Chair- man Verney. He caned for Ventura to quit the party in a letter he faxed to the Governor, writing, accord- ing to the New York Times, \You have brought shatne to yourself and disgrace to the members of the Reform Party. For the good of the members, you should resign now from the Reform Party oftb.e United States of America.\ Ventura's re- sponse, as spelled by his spokes- person, was, '\Pffff!\ I fmd it hard to understand the dim view ofJesse Ventura that Ross Perot and Russell V emey have taken.

He will not be a member of the political system dressed up and renamed, as Patrick Buchanan will be, but rather he will be different, and a new challenge to the political establish- ment. Serve Your Community by Gina Campanella Copy Editor For those of you who thought my last article had a·male bashing q~lity to it (Tapper}this is clearly notthe case. However, enough of th<tt. I have so many opinions, and so, little time! When did people first start to jok:~ about sketchy Schenectady and use the term (cringe) Doid? Wbenever I hear these things, I can'i help but be ashamed that I: am (I student at Union College, and I how there are many students wll() share this feeling. Yeah, m!l:ybe I laughed too at first, but then I realized wh.at I was doing_ Pe«Jple don't tolerate jokes about rac:is.m, or sexism, so why do we so routinely accept jokes about socio-economic status? Rave any of you isolationists ever actually ventured out into the community?: Oh my gosh! Real peo!='le live out there!! l (Surprise!) Yeah, the city does have its not- so-nice areas, but isn't that true of any city? I'm not saying I'd be really excited aboathaving to walk around alone at night, but again, that is just a general hmnan instinct, personal safety concept that is .re- ality in any city. One afternoon, wander down Nott Terrace, until yo? feel com- fortable (hint; ditch the diamonds and Prada, you'll blend better). Eventually, instead of constantly looking over your shoulder, you may start to notice the beautiful churches, or the passers-by smil- ing at you. Yes, friendly peo:Pie really do live in Schenectady![! The city is not just for (cringe) Do ids .anymore! Who coined this phrase any- way? Am I really the only person who can't stand it? (As you can see, it makes me cringe). We usu- ally nse this term to describe the not so friendly looking people that may wander into campus with bad intentions. However, these people are clearly the minority. The Person~ls! Yeah, they are sketchy, but it is not because they are from Schenectady. Therefore, the en- tirety of Schenectady should not be pigeonholed as 'sketchy' due to these random few people. If you need to be convinced that these people are, in fact, the few and the random, volunteer your time and your work to the commu- nity.

There are many amazing students who have been very active in the community. However, dare I suggest that this negative attitude may trickle down from the Union College authorities?

Matty G's World: Where have all the children gone? by Matty C Staff Writer Is Union becoming a suitcase campus? That, my friends, is the topic of this week's MattyG's world. For those of you not in the know, a suitcase carnpD;S is a school where people go home for the weekend because there is noth- ing to do on campus. When I was taking a tour of Union, five years ago, the tour-guide made su,re to mention the fact that Union was not a suitcase campus, and there were in fact many things to do. That is no longer a point mentioned on our campus tours for perspec- tive students, and maybe it should be. Four years ago, people would never have posed this questiorn because there were always things to do on the weekends here at Union. Over the past four years, I have noticed a trend of more and more people that want to leave our beau- tiful campus on the weekends to travel elsewhere. Back in my days of being a freshman, I know that there were never enough weekends to do all that I wanted. to do in a term. During my freshman year, I did not leave Union for any weekends because there was alwa.Ys some- thing for me to do on campus. Every Friday and Saturday night there was always a party that any- one could get into, and during the days I would either be iavolved in some campus activity, or I would hang out with friends. Having spent this past weekend on campus, it seems to me that many of the parking lots were sur- prisingly vacant on Saturday and Sunday mornings. The main rea- son behind my questioning is not only because there were many cars missing, but also bec&use I've ac- tually been hearing stories about what people went and did this weekend. While there have been efforts made in the past·two years to increase on campus activities, these attempts normally just end in a person or group becoming aware of the Apathy Monster ,that controls this campus. As the perceived nl!mber of campus activities declines, stu- dents fmd alternatives elsewheJe. Students are going to Albany in increasing numbers this term. When I say that, I do not mea11 to offend anyone who is actually from Albany, but the only realis- tic reason Union CoJ.lege students have to travel to Albany is for Crossgates (which is may be in Guilderland) and forthebar scene. Having people venture out and drink on the weekends should be expected, after all, we .are in col- lege. It is also understandable that after last year's ranking~ofU nion in the top ten of hard alcohol and beer consumption per capita that something would happen to re- spond to the increasing drinking numbers. Moving the diinking to Albapy doesn't end such deeply entrenched habits; it just adds a half-an-hour ride home into the eq\lation. , Another disturbing trend that I have noticed in the past year <Jr so would be the rise in gambling on campus. By that, I am not saying that more people are actually gam- bling on campus, but I ltave heard of far more people with gamhling problems in the past year than I have ever before in my life. I tllink that this might be a result of the per- ceived decrease of things to do on campus, resulting in people fmding things to do elsewhere. It seem.s like increasing numbers ofthese people are turning to gambling at the Turingstone casino as analternative than have in yeats past, and that can't be goo~ for the college as a whole, or for. those particular indi- viduals. This year, it seems albtost as if the administrati.onofUmon College is trying to do somethlng about the number of people (read. as fresh- man) who have been sent to Ellis hospital.in the past. The college has made few changes if any t<J the poli- cies they have in plac~::, hut ~eem to be enforcing them to .a higher de- gree. It seems as if all the. fraternities on campus hl).v~ l;>een on pr.9bation this year .. _ Thqugh there are un- doubtedly two or three who have avoide~ this ill fate, it would most likely be just because ofluck rather than any type of prevention system. The rule. is if someone under 21 years of age is drinking in a frater- nity, that fraternity_ gets in trouble. In reality, the only way the admin- istration (read as dean of student's office) knows if a frat~rpity has served someone under the age of21 is if someone gets sick, goes to the hospital, and then tells saidadmin- istration where they were drinking .. This system does· ~a,ve a way of punishing those people irrespon~ sible enough to let freshman drink too much and get sick Oh, I'iti sorry. I wrote something funny. Freshman will be fresbman and there will always be freslunan who want to drink. As Uniop. College stud~ntl!, tp~y have someabilityto solve problems, and so they will be able to find alcohol if they want to. If a fra- ternity is the means of that dis- tribution, then they don'thave to go buy a fake ID or find some~ one to buy for them, or even go to another college where drink- ing is easier. So we have established that freshman will drmk, now let's thjnk ~;tbout where this will oc- cur. President Hull openly states to groups of students. that he, doesn't believe it possible to be- come drunk: at a Fraternity party. So, if these people aren't getting drunk at Fraternities, then where are they drinking? My answer to that question would be at a bar, in another town, at another col- lege, or \in their rooms.\ During the past four years I . have noticed Resident Advisors go from being laid back people who were quite friendly and h~lpfuland very easUy approach~ able with any problem you had to being the :l;irst line of alcohol defense at the school. Jf an RA is to be effective in their job, they have to be friends with their residents so the resi- dents feel that they can approach the RA with any problem that arises. The way the system is set up today, there seems to be too much pressure on the RA's to bust people for having alcohol in Uleir rooms. In the past two years, new policies have come into place that make that more difficult to do, as the RAs are even more re- sponsible for reducing the antoWlt of drinking that occurs iJ:\, the dorms. I myself am 21 years old, and I resent the fact that I need to have my donn room d()or dosed if I would like to e~oy a. beer with tny roommate, who is also 21. I agree that there needs ta be a way of reducing drinking in individual rooms on Friday and Saturday evenings be- cause that is wnere most of the dan- gerous drinking occurs. As op· posed to having RA's function as reactive troops of the college, I would recommend putting events in place that would make people not wantte be in their rooms drink- ing. The currentsocial system that i~ in place at Union College depend$ almost fully .on the Greek system. If the school wants that system to change, then they need to put their money where their mouth is. The weekend ·of F~tllfest was a lot of fun. A large percentage of this lethar- gic campus was involved ill a. se- ries ofnon-ak::oholic activities that were open to the entire ca:rhpus. While this was a great weekend put on by the PAs, it took a huge chunk: out ofthe yearly budget for their campus activities. I believe that it was money well spent, and there should be more school sponsored events tlnoug;hout the year. If the school put up more money for events along: the s~me line theiJ. people would have a reason ti> stick aroundhere on the weekends_ President Hull has been hear.d saying that :he w~nts Union .Stu'- dents to work hard, but he .also wants them to play hard. Well, if that's going to happen then things need to. get turned around,, and quickly, or we could just make Union a commuter school and do away\~ith ~edorms,. ~ft~r all,. that would getrid of~ur h~~sing short- age. Looking J)owu\\\ard by Alex Bartholomew Staff Writer Hey there aU you loyal features section readers, glad to see you back for another installment of Looking Downward. Today I am going to try to explain some of the basic geology surrounding The Capital District. First, thanks to all of you who liked my artic1e and told me so last week, 1 like doing it so please keep reading. Sec- ondly, I will be starting a new sec- tion of my article this week. It will be called \The Spot ofthe Week\ This will be a description of a place near Union where you can go and see nature at its finest. Now, on with the article. O.K ... so you say rocks are rocks, right? Well, let me tell ya what, a rock is NOT just a rock anymore! We study geology so we can understand what was going on a long time ago. Rocks, if you know what to look for, can explain many, many things. First, you've got your three basic rock types: Sedimentary, Metam()rphic, and Igneous. Igneous rocks are rocks that formed by the cooling and lithification, or solidifying, of a batch of molten minerals, These tacks usually formed white itw~s really hot like deep d()wn ill the earth or at volcanoes. Metamor- phic rocks are rocks thar we once different from what they are now. That is to say, that they have been changed or \metamMphosed\ from what they once were. This process occurs by taking a rock, and subjecting it to heat or pres- sure or a mixture of both. The original rock may have been ~g;ne­ ous, sedimentary, or even another metamorphic rock, it rea.lly doesn't matter, but the new rock is much different. Sedimentary rocks are rocks that are laid down or \deposited'' by wind or water. They are formed from small particles or \clasts\ 1hat are cemented together by a glue or \matrix.\ The clasts can be made of any kind of rock and the)' are the key to understanding what was going on when they were being deposited. Within the surrounding area., all of the three rock types are present. Right here in Schenectady there are sedimentary rocks. A little to the north, igneous and metamor- phic rocks are present in the Adirondacks. The rocks in the Adirondacks are very, very old w'ith ·au age of about 1 r 00 Iilill'ion years old· 01 1.1 billion years old! That is ie~Uy old S'e~ing as how we suspect that the Earth is <lnly about 4.5 billion years old. These rocks are referred to as the \'Basement Rocks'' of New York State because they are the oldest known rocks in the state. There is a big gap in time between the basement rocks and the next se- ries of rocks seen in the state. This gap in time is known as an \unconformity meaning that there was a period of time where we have no clue of what was going on. There might have been rocks de- posited and then eroded .a. way, but we really have no way of telling exactly what happened tlten. All the rocks above these basement rocks are sedimentary rocks, and these will be the topic of tlle rest of today's article. Igneous and metamorphic rocks are cool and all, but if y<Ju ask me, sedimentary rocks is where it's at (sorry Professor Hollocher). I mean, who wouldn't want to look at rocks that have all kinds of cool stuff in them like fossils 1 minerals, melanges, fault breccias_ .. OK, I'm getting ahead of both yoa and my- self so I'll stop. First, there are a buhch' of different types of sedi- mentary roGks; There is sand· stone, grit, shale, limestone, ·con- glomerate, and breccia. Sand- stone is · 4 rock made of sand · grains cemented together by a mineral matrix. Either wind or water can deposit it and this can be determined by further exami- nation. Grit is a type of rock that is a little more fme-grained than sandstone, but the grains that make up the rock are still visible. This is mainly deposited in wa- ter. Shale is very fine-grained and is deposited in deep water like in the ocean. Limestone is a car- bonate rock that is made of cal- cium carbonate and forms only within 15 degrees north of south of the equator. It often contains fossils so it is a fun rock to look at. Conglomerate is a rock made of pebbles or cobbles and boul- ders of rock that are cemeated together by a matrix. A breccia is just a conglomerate where the pebbles or cobbles are angular and not rounded in shape. So, now you know little about basic geology. Well, on to tociay's \Spot of the Week.'' Tiris week's spot.isJohnBoydThatcher: P~:u:k. Known locally as ju.st Thatcher Park, this is a greatpla<:e to go to see some cool rocks and it also has a great view of the Hudson and Mohawk lowlands that sur- round the Capital District. At the park, there are huge cliffs oflime- stone that have a lot of fossils in them. There are a bunch of scenic- overviews (or look-off's as my Canadian friends call them) and there are some neat trails that run along the base of the cliffs.

When a fra- ternity goes on probation it's usu- ally for a month or so. That may seem like a short time to the ad- ministrators, but a month is almost half a term here. That's a big deal. So, heavily bounced invite parties are becoming more frequent while the number of parties diminishes. LJ: Oh, I see where you're go- ing with this. All these things are getting smaller, but the size of the student body is stagnant. BJ: Exactly, so when people a:re looking to party on campus, they are faced with fewer options. Eventually, the TWO parties on a given night get overcrowded (be- cause ofthe fewer options). !hen, in march the cavalry and a big fat probation. LJ: So the solution to over- crowding is letting more fi·ats have parties. BJ: You got it! More parties = less fire hazards. LJ: So how come there are only, like, three parties on the week- ends?

Page 12 ·October 7, 1999 • C!L.ottrnrbrensi9i Features Customs: Scourge of the Border by Michaela Cautela Staff Writer I hate customs. I loathe cus- toms. I despise and abhor cus- toms. I am not at all keen on cus- toms. I think you get the point. Now, by customs, I am not talk- ing about things like getting pre- sents on your birthday, or kissing someone under the mistle-toe. In my opinion, it is a disgrace to these wonderful traditions to even make them bear the same name as the unhappy, vengeful people who stand at the borders of countries and attempt to make your life mis- erable, simply because you would like the \privilege\ of entering their holy land. As you can probably guess, I had a little run-in with customs this weekend, and as all my articles seem to just recount in sordid and embarrassing detail the events of my ever-interesting life on the weekends, this should fit right in. Maybe I was wrong in think- ing that a weekend trip to Montreal would be fun. I had all sorts of fun things planned (which, if you read my article last week, probably wasn't such a good idea ... now that I think about it, I think I am going to give up planning altogether. I hereby renounce the concept of \plan.\) What I never took into account, however, was the seem~ ingly small, but in reality quite hage barrier of what is now the # 1 on my list of pet peeves: CUS- TOMS. I have been to Canada on many occasions before, and so, as we approached the booths armed with customs agen1s, I didn't really think twice. I expected to have to answer a few questions, maybe show some ID, and that would be it. Oh, but Canada had a different idea. We quite willingly surrendered olir li- censes, expecting to be given the once over, approved, and then waved through. However, some- thing in my boyfriend's tone when he asked the agent if we were all set must have sent the man into a flying rage, because instead of al- lowing us to pass, lte threw us a disgusted look, tossed a. yellow .slip of paper at us, and sa.id \No. Park over there and go inside.\ Are you kidding me? Go inside? The inside that l thought was reserved for terrorists and sketchy individuals that in some way pro- voked the agent or ~()oked like drug dealers. That v.ras certainly not us! In a state ofbewilderment, we pulled over, gave each other a confused look, and then started to laugh. This was all a big mistake .. We would get inside, they would take one look at us- two well dressed kids on their way to the Montreal Museum of Fine Art - and we would be sent on our way, with an apology .. Wrong again. We went inside, and my boy- friend (now more fun just a little peeved) went up to fue desk, and showed the woman behind the counter our \tickeC' She coldly explained that we were at the Wrong desk, and that we needed to be over at the i.mnllgration desk.

Looking over in the area at which she was pointing, \We saw a desk that had a big \Imm;igration\ sign over it, a computer, amd that was it. Oh wait, there was one more thing. The sign telling us that our friendly hnmigration Officer was out to lunch and that he \i<mld be back in a half an hour was sitting next to the cornpu.ter,just one more thing mocking our effortst<J spend a nice day in Montreal.

I Page 14 October 7, 1999 Be Hypnotized ... Be Terrorized-On the Big Screen by Fahim Noor Staff Writer A lot of students had fun about three weeks ago when the Comic Hypnotist Michael Ray hypnotized thirty students in Memorial Chapel. However, hypnotism is not always about fun and games. When things go wrong, it can tum into your worst nightmare, as Kevin Bacon's characteJ realizes in the newly released m<!lvie, Stir of Ech- oes. Tom Witzk · Kevin Bacon is leading a normal life with his wife tKathryn Erbe} and his son (Zachary David Cope) as a blue- collar worker in Chicago. However, his life is turned upside down when he dares his sister-in-law, Lisa, (Illeana Douglas) to hypnotize him at a neighborhood party. She gives him the post-hypnotic suggestion \open your mind,\ which opens his mind to more than new ideas. He starts having recurring flashes of disturbing and horrific visions. For example, he sees his neighbors' son's suicide minutes before it happens and he senses his own son's kidnapping. However, what is most curious and also extremely frightening to Tom is seeing the ghost of an eigh- teen-year oidgirl on his living room couch. With the help of his five- year old son, who can somehow talk to ghosts, he fmds out that the girl, Samantha, has been missing for along time. He tries to get his life back by going back t<J Lisa. He tells her, \Whatever door you unlocked in my brain; I want you to shut it!\ Although ltet attempt at removing the hypnotic s.uggestion from his Nearby Italian Resteraunt Receives Rave Reviews by Alexalldra Lchse Staff Writer Last Friday night, my friends and I had decided to venture outside the gates ofUnion and explore the fine dining of Schenectady. We stumbled upon a quaint little res- taurant called Manhattan Ex- change, which is located at 607 Union Street. It is an older house that has been converted into a res- taurant. When you enter the gate out- side of the restaurant, there is an outdoor dining area for those wellther permitting evenings when you to would like t() dine \al fresco.\ As you walk in the door, to your left is a bar and straight ahead and up the stairs is the din- ing room. Inside the dining room, there was not much to the ambi- ance of the restaurant. There were tables scattered about a dimly lit room with little decoration throughout. I did not see much of the \Manhattan \theme incorpo- rated in the restaurant's atmo- sphere. Since the room was fairly small, it made for more of an inti- mate atmosphere and holding con- versations was made easier than in a noisy packed restaurant. The first impression of the ser- vice was less than commendable. The hostess rusiled us over to a table and threw our menus on the table, ignoring the fact that one of them fell on the floor. She also failed to hand out the proper num- ber of menus for us - there were only three of us. But then as our waitress came over and warmly greeted us, the service turned around. Our waitress gave us ser- vice with a smile and she was ex- tremely attentive to our needs. The soup and salads came out to our table quickly. The menu choices were limited, but they were typical gourmet Ital- ian entrees. Unlike Friendly's or Applebee's, yoa are not given a wide array of choices, but the dishes that are served are unique and appealing. Each entree is served with the choice of a side salad or soup of the day. I tried the Linguine Pomadoro, which is an entree with linguine noodles and sauteed tomatoes covered in a basil and olive oil sauce. The presentation was noth- ing to write home about but then again as along as the food tastes great, who really cares. The food was to die for! The portions were enough for two meals. Other items <Jn the menu that I can recommend are the Caesar salad and Penne with Broccoli. For many Union students the prices a1e reasonable, as the average entree price is around twelve dollus. Once again, tile dessert menu was limited~ but I believe in qual- ity, not quantity. This restaurant served a delectable tiramissu that was out of this world. You could also indulge in a heavenly cheese- cake or Death. by Chocolate cake. Over all, the Manhattan Ex- change restaurant scores three out of foar stars by my ratings. It is a cozy, casualrestaurantthatserves dynamite food and is in walking distance from Union. If you are looking to take that special some- one out <JD a weekend night or just want take a retreat from the dining hall with y()ur friends, this place is perfect for you. Wild Wild West Co IDes to Rea01er Courtesy of Entertainment Weekly Wild Wild West is a movie that figures out how to go thud more often, and in more decadently ex- travagant ways, than just about any would-be blockbuster since Hudson Hawk. In this noisy, joy- less, bizarrely static fiasco, every element on screen- the cliche Old West settings, the computerized effects, Will Smith's so-slick- they're-Teflon smarty-pants quips - seems to let the air out of the one before it. The director is Barry Sonnenfeld, who previously teamed with Will Smith on Men in Black, and once again he has made a comedy that tries to be all things to all people: theme park, laJfriot, buddy movie, creature-feature spectacle. But the afiens-among-us premise of Men in Black gave Sonnenfeld much more to play with. Even when the jokes fell flat (which, to me, was most of the time), you could always be diverted by extraterrestrials whose heads looked like exploding eggplants. Wild Wild West, a loose takeoff on the popular '60s TV series, would like to conjure a surreal collision of Western and sci-fi, but the movie is straitjacketed by the stodgy over- familiarity of its horses-and-hol- sters setting. I mean, really, is there anything left to parody about the West? The movie, a piece of mu- tant six-gunjapery, seems to make up its rules as it goes along, and the result is a series of stale, mis- fued gags (Bruce Lee send-up, any- one? How about Kevin Kline in drag?) set against incongruous 1869 frontier ba<:kdrops. The fusion of cheekiness and deliberately over-scaled fantasy never jells. The core of Wild Wild West is Will Smith'sblase fearless- ness, but the audience has little to do but sit back and chuckle at his ironic distance from situations that had no conviction to begin with. Of course, his James West is also the film's image of a stalwart black superman-cowboy, and Smith is now so invuln~rable in his \street\ nonchalance that he's in danger of becoming a11 automaton of attitude. As West'spartner, Artemus Gor- don, an inventor ofBondian gad- gets, Kevin K.line acts with full-tilt whimsy, makinglrim the \feminine\ half of this buddy romance. At one point, the two get stuck in magne- tized collars and end up scurrying away from e:ach other, only to be pulled back into a forced embrace. I'd say that the movie was trying to tell us something, except that this brand of shtick, which dates back to the; Hope-Crosby road pictures and was kicked into a more preco- cious era with Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, now seems as ancient as vaudeville. West and Gordon, like Butch and Sundance, get to leap off a cliff, only this time, instead of yelling \S-! ''they land in a. muddy lagoon that looks full of it.

The word \DIG'' appears to him. He starts digging in his back- yard and even in his basement. He is determined to find out what the ghost wants from him no matter what it takes. The shocking secret that he uncovers will change some of the characters' lives forever. Many honor movies have con- stant scenes of gore and blood- shed, which just shocks people instead of actually scaring them. Although this movie is not free of violence, theactual plot itself is the most frightening and susp~11.seful aspect of the movie. The movie also has a lot ()f orig:inal visual ef- fects and a talented cast and crew. If you liked The Shining and The Sixth Sense, you will love this movie. the movie is based on the novel A Stir of Echoes by Richard Matheson. It is written a:nd di- rected by David Koepp, who also wrote the script for Jurassic Park: The Lost World and The T'rigger Effect.

We needed to get the majority of our homework done before eight so we could park ourselves in :front of tb.e television for the event that we had all been waiting for since last year. Ateight o'clock we would fmally get to see whether Felicity ckose Ben or Noel to spend het summer with. Everybody had their own opin- ions about which she should choose, but we put our differences aside at this important time. !always give credit to those who eam it andtl!.e producers of F elicM ity really do deserve credit for this one.

Neither Noel nor Julie is speak- ing to Felicity and Ben now .. It is not going to be easy for Felicity and Ben to make their fledgling re- latioaship work. The producers can get months worth of material out of this story. I will: also col11Illend the produc- ers on the good job that they have done in developing the characters ofNoel, Julie, and Elaina. I feel like I really know and un- derstand these characters now. Al- though I felt that Noel's behavior was un11ecessary, I could under- stand why he was so ~pset. Someone who he loved and a guy who he considered his friend betrayed him. Scott Foley did an excellent job of conveying Noel's anger. Julie's behavior throughout the show was very admirable. At the end of the hour I had a lot more respect for her than I did for Noel. In many ways her situation· was more painful than Noel's. Both her best friend and the boy who she loved betrayed her. It was clear that she was angry. She did not speak to Felicity or Noel. But she also said that she wanted to turn over a new leaf that year. Julie was tired ofbeinga vic- tim; she wants to take charge of her life. It is not going to be about a boy anymore~ At the end oflast season Elaina was in a compromis- ing relationship with a teacher. She knew exactly what she was doing, but that does not keep me from feeling sorry for her. Elaina really thought that the professor liked her. He took advantage of her innocence_ Not only did he quickly termi- nate their relationship but he also ·raised her grade. She never asked him to do that Last Sunday night it was clear that she was working hard to get over that fiasco. As much as I realize that what Felicity and Ben did probably was not right, I have a hard time stay- ing angry at her character for any length of time. She .tries so hard to be nice to everybody that she comes in con- tact with. Felicity and Ben both tried to patch things up with Noel and Julie, but this did not work. I hope this relationship works out because I really like both charac- ters. I also hope that the rest of the season is as enjoyable as the pre- miere was! Be sure to catch Felic- ity this and every Sunday on the WB. l?.r-Q~ctor's Theater Presents Anything Goes .

Page 16 ·October 7, 1999 · Korean Truth Exposed 50 Years Later by Philip Cho Staff Writer Washington, D.C.-· The Penta- gon made a statement on Thurs- day September 3 0, 1999 that it will investigate charges made by_ an As- sociated Press storythat U.S. Army troops gunned down \hundreds of helpless civilians under a railroad bridge\ in theSouth Korean c~un­ tryside in late July 1950. Army Secretary Louis Caldera stated at the Pentagon briefi11g to the press that he was committed to finding out the truth of these nlat- ters, as best he could. He also stated, \'We owe the American people, our veterans and our fnt:nds and allies in the Repll.blic of Korea a full accounting of these matters.\ The Army Center for Military llistory did a search and found nothing in the official records that substantiates the claims that the l'.S. Army soldiers perpetrated such massacres. However, Caldera also stated that history records of the early weeks of the Korean conflict were \'ery chaotic, although that would not excuse such alleged acts. Caldera also stated, \Although the U.S. Army fought with great courage, under very harsh condi- tions, were ill-trained and i 11- cquipped to fight because of a large reduction in resources available to the military for training and equip- ment following World War H.\ The charges of this incident were first leveled by South Koreall vil- lagers who say they survived the attack at No Gun Ri, a hamlet 1 00 miles southeast of Seoul. As Gfyet, the accounts of the incident my veterans have been conflicted. Army Veteran Norman Tinkler says he fired on refugees as th.ey attempted to cross the bridge head- ing south, because orders were made not to allow anyone, includ- ing civilians, te cross south of his position. However, retired Army Colonel Robert Carroll had a dif- ferent account He said that they were not using machine guns except when at- tacked, because they were short on ammunition. The Associated Press account alleges that the 1 51 Cavalry Division headquarters is- sued an order that read,. \No refu- gees to cross the front line. Fire on everyone trying to cross the front line. Use discretion in case that 100 to 125 civilians were killed on the railroad tracks lead- ing up to the bridge. While U.S. officials have main- tained that records don't show any U.S. troops near the scene of the alleged attack, the Associated Press said it found such reeords. The AP also reported that it found written orders directing U.S. troops to consider all civil- ians seen in the area as enemies- an apparent violation of the rules of war. Dozens of South Korean pro- testers have been rallying in front of a U.S. Army headquarters in pe()ple who said they survived the alJeged massacre. Civic groups have joined the growing protest, demonstrating with anti-American slcgans. President Clinton has been de- lldefed of ihe situation by Penta- gon officials. Seoul and Washing- 1(;)-n have .previously denied the al- le-gations. Being a ICorean myself, I have some vested interest in what the Pentagon investigation brings up. Mydadwas only a child when the K.oTean War broke out, but I know 1hat the war affected him pro- follndly. ''Wh.ile U.S. officials have maintained that records don't show any U.S. troops near the scene of the alleged attack, the Associated Press said itfo'U1td sueh records. The AP also reported that it found written orders direct- ing U.S. troops to consider all civilians seen itt the area as enemies- an apparent violation of the rules of war .. \ of women and children.\ The Pentagon, while finding no documentation to support a mas- sacre, could not rule out that it took place. One Pentagon official com- mented he didn't find it unfathom- able that it could have happened. For years, the U.S. and South Korean governments refused to grant compensation to South Ko- rean civilians who claimed they were victims of the alleged mas- sacre in July 1950. Currently, the Associated Press has documented the villagers' claims with first-hand accounts from six U.S. veterans. The account, documentated by the Associated Press, estimated . - - . Seoul since Friday , October 1, 1999, demandingjusticeforthe al- leged killing of refugees under a bridge at the start of the Korean War. Both the United States and South Korean governments have promised to investigate the report made by AP. Dozens of activists praised the decision to review the case. However, they also de- manded punishment for iltose re- sponsible, and compensation for the victims' relatives. The No Gun Ri report has drawn widespread media and pub- lic attention in South Korea, in- cluding editorials criticizing the U.S. government for failing to in- vestigate ea•rlier c.laims from There are many tales about the IC()rean War that are told around the table dllring Thanksgiving, when all my relatives meet to- g.ether at rny parents' house. The .JC()rean War is a legacy of my fam- ily, and since then I have had an interest in anything that involves either the Korean War or the Japa- Jtese occupation of Korea. Korea, as a ()Ountry, has been .through a lot. It has always been f()ught over, and the people had to endure many hardships. I feel that ·if the Pentagon investigations do .\>ring out the fact that indeed the massacre happened, that the U.S. a.nd South Korean government s:hould compensate the victims' fumilies. Enough was already suffered by malty Korea:.p.s during that time period. It was a difficult, chaotic time to live in. My ancestors went through a lot, and it is the least that can be doae for the governments to apologize for the massacre if it is i11deed true. I believe that the Pentagon will do what is right, a:.p.d try .to investi- gate this alleged massacre as best it can. l believe that 'both govern- ments will take the right measures to ensure that the right restitutions arernade :for any wrongdoingd<>ne in the war. Being that I was a military ch.ild m~self, I get an understanding of what the veterans feel. My dad was in the U.S. military himself. I believe that the veter- ans will tell the accounts as truth- fully as they can, and cooperate with the Pentagon to get t<> the truth. I believe that the right tllirlgs will be done, and that this will be resolved in a correct manner. I just hope that during this in- vestigation anti-American senti- ment is not too strong in South Korea. Being that I am a citizen of the United States of America,. I do get a sense of loyalty towards America. It is also a fact that, ethnically I am Korean. So, I also feel alle- giance to South Korea. I guess that is \vhat makes me Korean-Ameri- can. Whenever incidents between the U.S. and South Korea occur, I am always reminded that I am a prod- uct {)fbiculturality. It has its goad sides, but at times it also has its bad sides. However, I feel that since the world really is small. Someday dl ofus will be more aware of each other, and be more communicative with respect to certain issues. New Hampshire Announces Early Primary by Dave Gruner Stqff Writer The site of the nation's first presidential primary, New Hamp- sllire, has announced that Febru- ary I. 2000 will be the date at which each presidential candidate will have the opportunity t0 get his and her first real taste as to who are going t<> become the front-run- ners in the Presidential 2000 race. The date, announced by the state secretary of state's office, i:; ear- lier than expected and has not gone unnoticed. Washington Post columnist David Broder responded to New Hamshire's announcement. \Most campaigning will take place in 1999 when relatively few voters are paying attention. It's really a disadvantage to the process !tnd to the public to have this kmd of ri- diculously early calendar.\ The reasoning behind New Hampshire's secretary of state's office, as least partly, is that state law requires New Hampshire to hold its primary at least a week before any other primary. And Delaware had decided to hold its Republican primary on February 8, 2000. It is also noted that New Hampshire holds its primary eight days after the Iowa caucuses, which are set for January 3 J, 2000. What this mea11s, in essence, is that these new dates will acceler- ate an already front-loaded pri- mary season. On top of Iowa, New Hamp- shire, and Delawar-e, other states have moved their primaries up, making it even more evident that party nominees will emerge by mid-March 2()00. In response; candidates have already begun raising money, hiring strategists and pollsters, and are already criss- crossing the country, testing out their messages and hoping to pick up support. It is reported that in order to re· main competitive, candidates will need to have raised $20 million in 1999, which equates to $55,000 a day, seven days a week, all year long. Now, who are the contenders? On the democratic sicle of the ticket, there are two viable candi- dates: Vice President AI Gore and former NBA star and Senator from New Jersey, BiB Bradley. Re- cently, Bill Bradley has narrowed the gap and there is even specula- tion that because New Hampshire has set its primary for early Feb- ruary, that plays in the former bas- ketball player's favor. Yet, in or-: der for Bradley to pull off the up- set he must attract wider .support on a national scale while target- ing Vice President Gore~s cam- paign finance troubles. Then there are the Republican candidates, whom are ~11 aggres- sive contenders who are not about to cede a contest to Gov. Bush. Bush has demolished his conser- vative rivals in campaign contri- butions, and is supposedly on track to break the $50 million mark at the end of this month, way above the $20 million mark estab- lished by presidential strategists. Alongside the Governor from Texas are publishing magnate, Steve Forbes, who seemingly is the only other candidate who can keep up with Hush; whose contributions <~re coming mainly from his own pocket. Then there is Senator John McCain of Arizona, who has gained arnple ground in the past two weeks; former American Red Cross President and wife to Sen. Bob Dole, Elizabeth Dole, who has dr<lpped in poll numbers tec~ntly; staunchly conservative radio talk sh.ow host, Alan Keyes who has ideas but not much recognition; Gary Bauer, President of the Fam- ily Research Council wh() may have the e:xperience and knowl- edge but not enough support; Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah; who just entered thereby catching up to the rest of the field; and Pat Buchanan, former Reagan admin~ istration appointee, who has re- cently been C()nnected with drop- pi.ng the Republican party and switching ta the reform party as their candidate. Oh, and then there's New Hampshire Senator Bob· Smith, a one time loyal Republican, 11ow turned independent. What is to become ofthis? Well, for the Democrats there is sure to bea tight race with candidates who seem to rely on popularity, not is- sues- but whoever seems to be most \popular\ in February will win New Hampshire and most likely the overall nomination. On the Republican side of the coin, it seems that there is a clear front-runner with everyone else far behind. Steve Forbes may have the cas.h, and some interesting ideas, but doesn't have the Texan oil power to hold on. As long as the Governor keeps composure and his wide based support, the White Ho-use becomes more of a reality as each day goes by. Let's h.()pe for the best. So, New Hampshire is not too far away. The next sixteen m<>nths are sure to bring nothing less than excitement; the next millennium is a new era for new ideas and a \new leader.\ New Hampshire is merely the first step in acquiring that sta- tus.

However, they also de- manded punishment for those re- sponsible, and compensation for the victims' relatives.

Korea, as a country, has been through a lot. It has always been fought over, and the people had to endure many hardships.

This is the common sacrifice that many developing nations make and one that :Beijing is just now be- ginning to acknowledge. The Chinese Government has been reluctant to come to terms with an increasingly serious prab- lem, one, which threatens the health of its citizens and the con- tinued prosperity of its nation. The W.H.O. has released reports indi- cating that in the most polluted cit- ies in China, pollutant levels are three .to five times what are con- sidered to be safe levels set by the World Health Organization. One third of China's cities are affected hy acid rain, and in Shanghai, less than 40% of the air is breathable, according to a recent study by China's Environmental Protection Bureau.

The Chinese government had been collecting dfftafrom its ma- jor cities regarding air quality for twelll)' yeat:s., but just recently be- gan sharing this data with the pub- lie in weekly air quality reports. In Beijing, every week during the first three months these reports rated a 4 on a scale of five, with an five rating indicating the worst airqu.qlity according to Xiu Xuan, d~pmty director of Beijing's Mu- nicitnl Environmental Protection Bureau.

China's Guangzhou province is enjoying unprecedented economic growth, yet it is also one of the most polluted areas in the world. This is the common sacrifice that many developing nations make and one that Beijing is just now be- ginning to acknowledge . The Chinese Government has been reluctant to come to terms with an increasingly serious prob- lem, one, which threatens the health of its citizens and the con- tinued prosperity of its nation. The W .H. 0. has released reports indi- cating that in the most polluted cit- ies in China, pollutant levels are three to five times what are con- sidered to be safe levels set by the World Health Organization. One third of China· s cities are affected by acid rain, and in Shanghai, less than 40% of the air is breathable, according to a recent study by China's Environmental Protection Bureau. In Hong Kong, pollution which blows over from Mainland China, is so bad during the winter- time that Ships must use their fog- horns in the harbor, even on per- fectly sunny days. The pollution is a result of a lack of regulation by the government and extremely limited industrial access to clean burning fuels. In cities, taxis, and many cars and trucks burn diesel fuel, the main source of small particle emissions. In the past, the lack of regulation allowed for the sale ofleaded gaso- of air-borne particulate matter, and also of sulfur dioxide, a byproduct that interacts with atmospheric gases to form acid rain. While re- cent efforts by the government in- clude law which all new automo- biks purchased in 1999 have cata- lytic converters and outlaw the sale of unleaded gasoline, the increas- ing GDP remains more important to the government than the envi- ronment. than what it costs to fix the prob- lem,\ said Li. Besides sanctioning companies and performing stud- ies with ou~dated equipment to monitor the disheartening envi- ronmental deterioration, China's EPB can do little to effect change. The Chinese government had been collecting data from its ma- jor cities regarding air quality for twenty years, but just recently be- gan sharing this data with the pub- One third of China's cities are affected by acid rain, and in Shanghai, less than 40% of the air is breathable according to a recent study by China's Environmental Protection Bureau.

Chinese industries use coal as a primary energy source since there is little access to natural gas or oil. Coal combustion is a major source \Environmental protection is a new idea in China\ said Li Yihui of China's Envirorunental Protec- tion Bureau. While conditions con- tinue to worsen, the EPB has little power in regulating industry- \The fine for pollution is much lower lie in weekly air quality reports. In Beijing, every week during the first three months these reports rated a 4 on a scale of five, with an five rating indicating the worst air quality according to Xiu Xuan, deputy director of Beijing's Mll- nicipal Environmental Protection Bureau. Weekends \Fresh Air\ tours have recently become popu- lar in Beijing. Its clinics are filled with children complaining of coughs, sore throats, and various pulmonary ailments. Asthma rates soar to an extremd} high rate of six percent in the: areas around major factories. Xiping Xu or the Harvard School of Public H e<Jlth has shown in collaborative studies with col- leagues in China that residents of major Chinese c1tit;;'s experience increased death rates due to car- diopulmonary diSL'ases on day~ when pollution levels are highest. Pollution levels were also being linked to low birth weights and premature births. The effects of air-borne polluta11ts are exacer- bated by China's smoking popu- lation- approximately 70% of Chi- nese males are smo.kers- and fur- ther estimates indicate that smok- ing related diseast;;' will cause the deaths of one in thr-ee men by the year 2000. While China gains status and recognition as a world power, its environmental situation worsens. One Beijing resident, Zhang J iyan. said \The air is bad- you can read it in the newspapers.\ as she stood next to her roadside shop in Beijing. \Look you can't even see tall buildings a fev .. : streets from here.\ Japanese Company Spills Condensed Uranium Three exposed workers hospitalized for radiation poisoning; local community evacuated by Stephen Nemeth Staff Writer Concerns over the safety of nuclear power were again raised when an accident in a Japanese uranium processing plant injured 3 last Thursday. During this acci- dent, which the Japanese govern- ment has called a \criticality inci- dent\ workers described seeing a \blue flash\ -which experts say is a sign of such an incident- and then began to feel ill. (Criticality is the point at which a nuclear chain reaction becomes self-sus- taining.) Immediately after the incident, which may have raised radiation levels 4,000 times their normal level, the go\ernment began to e\acuate homes within 350 meters and told others to stay indoors. TI1e Kyodo News Agency said that one person was heavily exposed to radiation in what would be Japan's worst injury from a nuclear inci- dent. All three workers were taken to the hospital and later to a special- ized facility in Chiba prefecture, east of Tokyo. Reports from the hospital show two of the men suf- fering from radiation poisoning while the third, 35 year old Hisahi Ouchi who was exposed to the big- gest dose of radiation, will receive a transfusion of peripheral stem cells into the bone marrow. On Monday the government sent a 1 00-member task force to plant as a potential cause for the accident. On Saturday, the com- pany admitted it had illegally changed a government manual to allow its workers to use stainle~s steel buckets to transfer a uranium solution into a mixing tank. The practice was not listed as a cause of the accident. But because workers were doing the loading by hand instead of the required appa- that they would investigate whether the central government was to blame for lax supervision. Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi called for a \strict investigation\ and was quoted as saying, 'Tm told that the accident was caused by the way the company ran their operations with little regard for safety. I think that's unforgiv- able.\ On Saturday, the ·company admitted it had illegally changed a government manual to allow its workers to use stainless steel buck- ets to transfer. a ura:nium solution into a mixing tank. The practice was not listed as a cause of the accident.

Reports from the team point to improper techniques used by the operating company of the ratus, they mistakenly loaded 35lbs of condensed uranium -nearly 8 times the normal amount. Kazuo Sato, chairman of the Nuclear Safety Commission, stated Without blaming the central government, Science and Tech- nology chief Akita Arima said au- thorities should tighten control over the nation's nuclear facilities. \We did not predict this sort of accident could eve-r happen ... It is unthinkable that 16 kg of uranium was brought in,\ Ar]ma said. The village of Tokaimura, where the accident took place is slowly returning to normal as people return to their homes. The village is also horne to 15 other nuclear related sites and was the scene of Japan's worst nuclear ac- cident In 1997, a fbre at a nuclear reprocessing plant was not extin- guished properly and exploded, releasing radiOactiv-e gas, and Ill- juring 35 people.

Dutchmen Cruise Past Diplomats Union improves to 3-1; Prepares for College of New Jersey on Homecoming & Parents' Weekend by David C. Brooks Editor-in-Chief After going 11 quarters without scoring a touchdown, the Fighting Dutchmen scored two in the last five minutes of the third quarter on their way to a 17:-0 win over Franklin and Marshall. The de- fense had their strongest outing of the season, pitching a shutout for the frrst time this year. After hold- ing Hobart to minus 10 rushi,ng yards, the defense held the Diplo- mats to minus one-yard rushing. Union, who was unable to score in the first half, played well. When asked what occurred during half- time, head coaqh- John Audino said, \We really didn;t say too much at half. We felt we were a block, or a cut, or timing throw 1;1way from making a couple .first downs and keeping the sticks mov- ing.\ George Beebe scam.Jlered his way - for a three-yard touchdown rnn., his frrstcollegiate touchdown, giv- ing the Dutchmen a 14-0 lead with 12. seconds left in the third quarter. The defense simply dominated the Diplomats the whole game. \We have a lot .of confidence in avertiged more then 42 yards on seven punts with a long of 59. Blackwood, who did notplay much last year, took over for Bryan Slekes, who has been used predominately as a receiver,. thus he cannot de- vote as much time to punting. Blackwood has stepped into the field goal in the third quarter, but missed a 38-yard field goal in the first quarter. The Dutchmen also pulled out a fake punt in the third quarter. With fourth and one, Blackwood was on to kick, how- ever the snap went directly to Laporta. who gained three yards The Dutclunen left Friday morn- ing and stoppedat Lehigh Univ:er- ~ity t() practice and have dinner. Saturday was a dassic fall day in Lancaster, Pennsylvania and _ Union;s faithful crowd proudly made thesix-and-a-halfhour drive to watch their team improve their. record to 3-1. The Diplomats, who fell to 0-4, looked more like a team trying not to lose, instead of try- ing to win. Brian Slekes hauls in one of his five catches during Saturday's 17-0 victory over F & M. The Fighting Dutchmen wel- comed the return of tackle Greg William, and receiver Idris Abdul- Aziz, who missed last week game. Union was able to capita~e on a 16- yard punt return by Dan Hamister, giving Union's offense a first and ten from the Diplomats' 48-yard line. FresbmanBen Gilbert connected with senior Brian O'Donnell for a 27-yard comple- tion. After a roughing the passer penalty on F & M, Union had frrst and goal from the four-yard line.

With first and goal fr'Om1he three-yard line, Union's backfield lined up in the wishbone formation and freshman our defense, they're keeping people off the fieldand turning the ball over,\ said Audino. Despite the poor record ofF & M, Audino felt the win was a lot bigger then people give them credit for. Audino also added, \I thought our pass protection was excellent.\ Gilbert was sacked only twice which is an impressive nurnbei considerihgthe aggressive blitzing that the Di;plomats had. The Fightins Dutchmen gained 100 yards on the ground but the running back position continues to be up in the air. Union has a plethora of running backs with Beebe, Jasper Mills, Matt Laporta, Paul DelVecchio, Jay Wm:Zala, Rob Bennett and Matt Fieese. Freese, who was not invited to training camp, has worked himself back into playing condition and was the leading rusher in the game with 14 carries and 48 yards. Senior Ben Blackwood has taken over as the starting punter, and 1EAM UNION SCORE BY QUARTER 1 2 3 ~ F Franldin &Marshall - - - 0 0 0 0 14 0 - 3 17 0 0 role successfully, becoming the top rated punter in the UCAA and the third best punter in upstate New York with an average of36.4 yards per punt. and the first down.

This weekend, the Fighting Dutchmen host the College ofNew Jersey on Saturday for one of the most anticipated games of the sea- son. The Lions, who are coming off two straight losses, who were ranked 23' 4 earlier this year, lost to Ithaca last week, and were beaten 40-3 by third ranked Rowen last Saturday. TCNJ (1-2) is a strong team, but a team Union is capable ofbeating. Th~ offense seemed to dick during the second half oflast week's victory and the defense, with the second best rushing de- fense in the nation, will be up to the challenge of stopping the Li- ons. \They're a real rough, physi- cal outfit. 1 like how we are now, and I think we meshed as a team [Saturday] for the first time this year. They have good mobile qllar- terbacks, a fastnmning back, a twCJ good tight ends,\ said. Audino. Al- though the Lions have a big offen- sive line, Union's defense is one of the best in the country and wel- comes the challenge. Home field advantage is key to the Fighting Dutchmen this week- end. It is Homecoming as well as Parents' Weekend. The Fighting Dutchmen need your support. The kickoff will be at 1 :00 PM on the Frank Bailey Field.

Women's Soccer Tramples Competition Extends Unbeaten Streak to 18 byMeriditb Chace Contributing Writer Once again, the Union Women's Soccer squad has trampled their competition this week tq bringtllis season's current record to 7-0-1 . Union played all three oftheirop- ponents, New Paltz, Skidmore and Rensselaer at home. Union ca]Ji- talized on their home field ad¥an- tage and outscored their oppo- nents 15-0. On Wednesday afternoon, the Dutchwomen annihilated New Paltz, 7-0. Sophomore Katie Smith got them started right away, ,tak- ing a pass from Lauren Byrne, drib- bling up the left side of the field and beating the New Paltz goal- keeper near post for her first of three goals. Samantha Ryall followed Smith 10 minutes later on a pass from Margaret Kostro. Freshman Abby West followed suit and scored ()n a Ryall assist, with 16 minutes to go in the half, giving Union a 3-0 halftime advantage. In the second ha.Jf, Stephanie Maychek did not waste any tirne and scored on a Tara Ilsley assist. Carrie Price and Abby Harris both connected with Smith to give hera hat trick,. her first of the season. Freshman Nori Lupfer also sc(}red unassisted. The final score was a lopsided 7-0, in favor of the Dutchwomen. Smith's game play stood out -with her 3- goal performance, as well as Shanna Reyes and Maychek. Goalkeeper Shannon Powers h<~d two saves and is accredited with the shutout Union out shot New Paltz 22-4 so they clearly domina.ted for the majorityofthe game. However, af- ter West's goal in the first half, the said, \Once we feel comfortable in a game, our intensity tencls to drop.

Dutch women seemed to lose their initia1 intensity. Their touchesand passes were not as dean as they had been at the begin11ing of the game. Union had a comfortable three- goal cushion in the fust half, but Coach Brian Speck w~s not h~ppy with the loss of inten:;ity. Speck Union went on to handle Skidmore with ease on Friday at home in a 5-0 contest. Missy Matusewicz didn't hesitate, scor~ ing a goal within the ftrst two min- utes of the game, off of a Byrne assist. Union kept pounding into Skidmore in the first half, with goals vered an unassisted goal into the Skidmore net Emily Godfrey scored the final goal on a Rachel Barrett pass. Union out shot Skidmore 23-3, a significant margin. The easily won battle may have left Union with too much confi- dence, as they were not completely prepared for their upcoming tough opponents, RPI. On Saturday, againstR.ensselaer, Union had a great deal of trouble on the offensive end. Although West managed to score a goal in the first half, the one-goa11ead was not enough fer Union to feel com- fortable with,· as they are used to having a more substantial lead. For the remainder of the game, Union was unable to finish on any of their scoring opportunities. Finally, in the second half, Rensselaer pulled up their sweeper in an attempt to produce a goal and tie the game. This.Ieft Union's for- wards the opportunity to score, and they took it. In tlie ftnal 15 minutes of the game, Ryallllnd Byrne beth found the back of the net with assists from Harris and Cardetino. This surge in the last fifteen minutes was enough to put Rensselaer away by a finalscore of3-0. Speck was not patticularly pleased with his team's play against RPI. He stated, .. I didn't think that we played with the pas- sion thatwendid towiiibig games. I think we may.be in f~r a shock.\ Speck hope~ that despite the lack of competition thus\· far on his team's schedule, they will still be. able to pull together and win big games when the time comes. On Thursday, Union faces Hartwick at home, and will then travel to William Smith on Satur- day, for what could be the game that determines the UCAA cham.: pions. Let's hope that the Dutchwomen can step ap the in- tensity in these upcoming games and prove that they are the supe- rior team. Volleyball Stages Comeback After Two Tough Losses Shuts Out Utica College and SUNY Utica/Rome by Kristen Nobles Contributing Writer \I have come to realize that in this sport [of volleyball] the better team does not always come out on top,\ stated Brooke Sajor, soplw- more setter for the Union College Women's Volleyball Team. As strange as this statement may sound, Sajor is absolutely correct. Last week, the Dutchwornen amazed their fans with an incred- ible win against powerh()use SUNY New Paltz. The combination of powerful hitting, perfect passing, smart set- ting, great coaching, and all around talent that Union pos- sesses on the court seemed t() es- tablish Union as a major contender for the UCAA title and for a p<)- tential birth in the upcoming state tournament. However, the four game loosing streak that plagued the Dutchwomen after their win over New Paltz does not seem to back up their original thoughts. There are many components that could be attributed to this !O<sing streak: lack of talent, lack of confidence or lackofdesire. Howevei, Unio11has all of these in an enormous quan- tity. None of the team members could even put a finger on what was causing the accumulati<>n of these several losses. The game of voll e:yball has changed in in the past two years in order to speed-up the ])ace of the game. Less calls are being made, especially when it comes to tipping and carrying the ball, so the :flow of the game will be interrupted less frequently. This makes it more dif- ficult to adjust to the p;ace and de- fend your team's side ofthe court. Teams are seeing mO<re and more off-speed hits that are <iesigned to catch the defense off-guard. This does not seem to be a problem for Union, though. Union~s defense is quick enough and aMHe enough to recognize the off-speed hits and keep them from hitting the ground. On Saturday September 25, the girls traveled to Clarkson Univer- sity for a tri-match versus both Clarkson and Hamilton for their first matches since their win QVer New Paltz. Union fell to both teams, loosing 3-1 and 3-0 respectively. Since both of these teams are in the UCAA league with Union, the two losses will now influence their seeding in the UCAA tournament, which will be held here at Union during Parent's Weekend. On Tuesday September 28, Union playedMiddlebury College at home. The team came out strong and took the first game from a heavy hitting Middlebury squad, thereby holding a 1-0 advantage. However, Middlebury came ba~;:k to win the next three and take the match. From the bench and the stands, anyone could see Union was the better team, running more plays, hitting harder and passing better thanMiddlebury. Luckjustwasn't on their side that day. The Dutchwomen planned to redeem themselves from the un- lucky loss to Middlebury with a quick win against a weaker, but not weak team, from the College ofSaint Rose. Again, the Dutchwomen came out hitting hard and strong with a 15-7 win in the frrst game. Yet, once again, the tables turned and St. Rose took the next three games to win the match. Union, once mote, was clearly the better team. This loss convinced the team that some drastic changes needed to be made. The nex:t day, the captains ran the ptactice. No coaches, just the team. No one will ever really know what went on in the Memorial Fieldhouse that day except for the players. But whatever happened was incredible. Union traveled to Utica the next day, Saturday October 2, to take on Utica College and SUNY Utica/ Rome in another tri-match. The outcome of this tri-match was far different from the outcome of the last weekend's. Union dominated both teams and won both matches 3-0. No one could believe the in- credible tum-around ofthe Union women. Union's attitude and drive seemed to increase with every per- fect pass, gorgeous set and awe- some kill. The best part about the entire weekend was that everyone had their own chance to play. Each player was able to put in some time on the court to make it a true team victmy. The team is hoping the past weekend has begun a new streak: an undefeated one. Uni<>n's next match is against Oneonta on Tues- day October 5 in the Fieldhouse. As 1nentioned before, the UCAA toumament will be held on Friday andSatllrday ofParent's Weekend in the Fieldhouse as well. If you are looking for somewhere dry to watch an exciting game, head over to the Fieldhouse for some great Dutchwoman volleyball action.

-·· ' ~age 22 • October 7, 1999 • <l!~nr1UA!ttl!ii9 Spotts Union Cross Country Shines at UCAA Meet by Beth Broga~ and Frank Filiciotto Contributing Writers Amidst the many great perfor- mances that took ])lace this past weekend at the UCA..AChampion- ships at Saratoga, the virtue of teamwork seemed to stand outthe most. Every runner on the course wearing the Union colors showed exceptional dedication, motiva- tion, and, most importantly, the will to keep going despite the circum- stances. These personal qualities reeked from the pores of our runners, up the steep dirt hills and across the endless grassy fields. It was the will to succeed that drove our run- ners to victory; prevailing was a word that echoed fr()m the hills. The men's race went off as scheduled at 1:45 PM. The start- ing line was strewn with different colors: RPI red, Hamilton blue, Clarkson green, and Hobart or- ange. Union silver had yet to be seen before. These \brand-spank- ing-new\ uniforms provided the inspiration for the race-to come. Saint Lawrence University was victorious witl} 33 points. The Un;on men finished sixth out of seven teams with 157 points. Just about everyone on the team had a personal best time. Head Coach Charlie Casey commented on the race, stating that \The team ran extremely _well despite the score. We benefited from the previous weekend off and were able to com- pete with such harsh competition because of this.\ Once again, Senior Captain Kenny Scott led the way, ·finish-. ing in twenth-fifth place overall. His time of28: 19 for the hilly fiv~­ miler is no~ only a personal best · by forty-seven seconds but also the fastest time mn by a Union, runner this season. Sophomore Matt Conley. con- stantly improving every week, fm- ished twenty-ninth overall in a time of28:34. This was also a per- sonal best by over a minute. Freslunan Frank Filiciotto finished directly behind Co!lley in a time of 28:35, also a personal best by over forty seconds. Freshman Matt Weber was next, fmishing 41st overall in a time of 29: 16. Rounding out the top five for Union was Junior John \Niemo\ Nieman. Up to this point, N iemo had never broken 30 min- utes at Saratoga before. It was clearly his goal to break the 30 minute mark this p.ast weekend. He ran 29:47 and finished 45th overall, attaining his goal and help- ing the team tremendously. Our sixth man was Junior Steve Schuler, who completed the gru- eling five miles in :>0:08 and fin- ished 50th. Joe \TT\ Kelmanovich wrapp-ed up the var- sity top seven by finishing 56th in a time of30:2l. These fine perfor- mances provide additional inspi- ration for theW estfield Invitational two weeks from now where the hills are as flat as a pancake. Other excellent performances were turned in by John Houghton (63rd, 30:54), Ben Waite (64th, 31 :06),Joe Killcuilen (69th, 32:13), Jerald Whittington (12nd, 32:38), Don Schaeffer (74th, 32:56), Terry Chang (77th, 33:14 ), Andrew Wyle (80th, 33 :46), Dan O'Leary (8lst, 33:56), Atsu Kaneko (82nd, 34:21 ), and AsadChoudbry (88th, 40:25).

Although they held possession oi the hall for the majority of play a11Bmanaged sev- erai shots ()n goal, _they failed to capitali~e on any scoring opportu- nities. Thus, the game ended in a 2- 2tie.

That is how you win ga:mes.\ . The ~ext day Uni()n took on a strong team fromRPI in an attempt to .add another win to their tally thus far this season. This game was clearly a defensivae battle between the two teams, anJ no goals were scored during the fust half. How- ever, Freshman James Samatulski was given a contraversial red card, and the Dutchmen were forced to play the remainder of the game down one player as a resuJt of this. Union came ba(;k strong in the second half, as they usually do~ with the intention of preventing this ar- duous game from going into an overtime, the second in two days. Freshman Tom Holmes almost made this possible with. the second half almost over. Holmes was passed the ball as he stood eight yards from the RPI g<lal, yet the goalie rpanaged to make an incted- ible diving save, thus devastating the Dutchman effort. The game was lalllit;hed i)l.to · overtim~ and lJni01i; exhaust()d from the previous day's efforts, could not seem to fmd the back of the net. The game eJJ,ded in a 1}-0 tie. However, the Dutchmen must be commended for their incredible effort, as they were playing with one man down and had just come off a long and exhausting game just 24 hours earlier. Shedd had an outstanding game, stopping all 18 shots he faced, and RPI outsllot . Union by only one. Guinn is hopeful about this team and the outcome of the season. Currently the team is in fourth place in the UCAA league with two upcoming games against fellow UCAA competitors. They will be matched up against St. Lawrence University and Clarkson University on October 15 and 16 at home.\ StLawrence is currently undefeated in league play and should offer us some tough competition, ... stated Guinn. \Our goal this season is to attain a .500 winning percentage in league play, and I feel that we have the talent to defeat Clarkson.\ The Dutchmen will be at Uti4;a College on October 6,bu.t then will return home for the remainder <Jf their season. They will play Geneseo on Oc- tober 9 at 2:00PM and RIT on Oc- tober 12 at 4:00PM. Come sup- port these hatd-working athlet~s as they crush their opponents in theirfmal weeks of play.

A die-hard Gretzky fan once noted,. \Wayne Gretzky was the epitome of a championship-caliber athlete. He was the most physi- cally and mentally skilled in his sport. He led his teams to numer- ous championships. He made the players around him better. He never did anything to embaJTass himself, his teammates, his organization or his sport. Fans were born because of his play. Most of all~ he went about his business with the utmost class and dignity.\ Even Gretzky's biggest rivals, such as Mark Messier. (who ,\;as also a longtime teammate of Gre~ky's) and Jaroillir Jagr (who scored the winn~ng goal against Gretzky in his fmal game), were his closest friends. Over the past several months, Gretzky has been busying himself as a spokesman for a number of companies, including Goodyear, Johnson & Johnson, Tylenol, CIBC, as well as some Canadian companies. He has also landed an opportunity to write a weekly col- umn for The National Post. \I enjoy working, I'm not really a person to just sit aro-und,\ com- mented the former hockey player. \I think the more you can stay busy and the more you enjoy yowself working, the younger you feel. This has all been fun for me and I've enjoyed myself. •• Even though Gretzky' s career is complete, 1he celebration is far :fi'orn being over. The city of Edmonton celebrated Gretzky's retil'ement at the home opener of the season on Friday night by retiring his number and raising his jersey up to the rafters. Among the 18,000 fans who came to salute Gretzkywere his wife and children, all his former coaches and teanunates, and the league's commissioner. Similar ceremonies are expected to take place in New York, Los Angeles, and St. Louis. Furthermore, the commissioner has announced that not only will the #99 be retired in these four francllises, but this. number will never be worn again in the National Hockey League. Even though the rules require three years before an induction into the Hall of Fame, the members of the board have agreed to admit Gretzky early, as an exception to the longtime tradition. His i11duction into the Hall ofF arne will take place sometime next month. Gretzky will most likely remain a role model for millions ofhockeyplayers to come, and probably has a great influence on Union's current hockey stars as well. · Write. ·for Spo.rtsl Come to a Concordy Meeting Tonight ·at 7:00 ih Room 303 of the Campus Centerl . ., - - -·

There was anNCA.A. \'olkyball Tournament in the Field House on Saturday morning and a \Vomen 's Rugby match against St. Lawrence in the afternoon. Men's Soccer battled the boys from Geneseo at 2 PM and the Ice Hockey Team held a garnet and white scrimmage at 5 PM The main of event ofHomecom- ing, however, was the football game.

Union fans were rooting for the home team aad fmally saw some results in the third quarter,. when the Dutchmen pulled ahead oft;heir rivals. Before this streak ofpoints, though, a tradition was enacted in the center oHhe field, Every yeardliring Homecoming weekend, a fraternity is honored with an award know.ti as the Brown Cup. The trop.Jiy is awarded to the winning fraternity during halftime of the Homec(')ming football game. The award is given to the frater- nity that has tile most outstanding academic achievement, the best participation in intramural' sports and extracunicular activities, and the greatest cO'ntribution of service to the community. The activities of the <:ontesting fraternities are rated according to a point system. The Inter-FratemdCouncil determines the winner of the award based on the number of points they have earned. The 1999 recipient was Alpha Epsilo11 Pi. In Chester Arthur, AEPi pres- ently houses ih.irty brothers, and is recovering from the loss ofnine- teen seniors who graduated last term. Having:fulfilled the require- Crary/CP Tom McKinney and President Hull give the cup to the brothers. nients necessary to cotnpete for the Brown CUp, AEPi was honored with the cup. This is the second year in a row that AEPi has won the Brown Cup, which attests to their commitment and dedication ton. The President of the winning fraternity is Dave Barnett, a senior. He believes that AEPis greatest contributions to Union are fea- nued events lmown as \AEPi in the Hot Seat.\ Ahnost every other Wednesday, AEPi hosts a guest speaker at their house. The invited guest is usually a Union professor who has been asked to come and talk about random subjects that differ from the area of study that he or she nol1llally teaches. At the completion of their tall:, the speaker :invites the listeners to ask questions. For example, <>ne oflast year's hosted speakers was Professor Sargent, who gave an in'- teresting presentation about mys- ticism. The turnouts for th.ese events were always good and are expected to remain strong. As for the community service as- pect of AEPi, Barnett comments that brothers have participated in activities such as Demolition Day (the brothers helped a dilapi<lated house be tom down so that ali.- oth.er could be ,built in its place), the Adopt-A-·Highway Program, and \We Care A,b out Schenectady\ community activi- ties. ... continued from page 1 · · instance ( G.eorge .

The ·faculty voted on Thursday, Octo- ber 7 to approve havmg two mi- nors. The Academic Affairs Coun- cil began discussion on the possi- bility of allowing students to de- clare two minors last spring. It was then presented to the Student Fo- rum, which supported the concept. They subsequently passed it onto the faculty, where it was voted upon favorably. In order to have a double minor, one would have to complete the requirements for both minors separately. \To complement the major, students can also de- clare a minor, a coherent and dis- tinct set of six courses outside the major\ (www.union.edu}. A double minor keeps both dis- ciplines separate; it is not interde- partmental. The idea of two tninors was brought to attention of the ad- ministration ·through student re- quests for it and the lack of a for- mal procedure to allow fortwo mi- nors. \Many students do not even realized .that they have a minor in the first place,\ McCarty noted . Students that fmd themselves with two minors have many different reasons for their situations. The two most common circumstances are students who have changed majors and now have six courses in a subject that they originally planned to have as th.eir major. The second circumstance in- volves those students who are in the process of choosing a disci- pline. They concentrate in a six course in discipline other than their major. Two minors are open to anyone who meets the requirement for those minors. \Current Seniors cannot declare two minors but, as ofnextyear, two minors will be open to everyone,\ McCarty explained. The reasoning behind this is that the registrar's office and its com- puter system is not able to handle the implications of two minors un- til next year. - When asked if this option would be accessible for all students, McCarty noted, \It would be diffi- cult for engineers to have two mi- nors due to their requirements, but I would never say it is impossible.\ Underclassmen should keep this new option in mind when they are choosing majors and minors. It will allow them to explore and concen- trate in three areas now instead of only two. Sloan Miller/CP U2K proposed some controversial changes for the College. tern.\ Many students had_ similar sentiments about the rapid transi- tion to sophomore rush.. Senior Tom McKinney commented, that \Freshman should be able to choose where they want to live theii\sophomore year, regardless if it be a theme house or Greek hous- ing. If students cannot rush until sophomore year- they will not be living in the fraternity or sorority until junior year, cutting their op- portunity to be part of their house for the majority of their time at Union.\ As the conversation between faculty and students went in cirdes, the students questioned the future options of the social life, specifically, the future of parties. The steering conlmittee mentioned talk of allowing theme houses to have parties where they can serve alcohol, rather then exclusively the fraternities. This would broaden the \party scene\ and hopefully allow for more interactions be- tween students of several interests. In addition, the resuiTection of a party bam has been suggested for any organization to hold social events forlargenumbers ofpeople. The school is in search for more social space to provide for more diversified activities on campus during the weekends. The outcome af the meeting proved to show there are defmitely conflicting views regarding the sta- tus of the Greek system between the faculty and students. Hope- fully, faculty and students can overcome this gap of communica- tion and work together to make the social life here at Union desirable for all.

Sorum joined Union in 1973 as a visiting professor. After only a year ofteaching at Unien, she accepted a job at North. Carolina State University. Eight years later and ready to return to a sma:ll university, she came back to Sclienectady and became one of the founders and the chair of Uni<m' s Classics Department. In 19~3 she moved on to become the Dean of Arts and Scie11ces, work- ing on faculty development and hiring new faculty. Finally, last spring President Hull asked her to ado t the title Dean ofFacu:lty and Academic Affairs. Although she only accepted the position last spring, Sorum has al- ready entered into various projects ·for the year and is enjoying her new position. With the abundance of tip and coming projects, Sorum is working hard to \organize what needs to be done and improve the college in all areas for the long term.\ The first major project she and Alan Taylor are supervising is the Middle States report. Every ten years the college is reviewed and re-accredited to see that it is maintaining standards as- suring that students are receiving proper educational services. Sorum is working hard to polish Un.ion 's report and to see that the school follows up on any sugges- ti<ms Middle States offers. Along with the Middle States re- port, other pr~jects include: de- · veloping the Union Scholars Pro- · gram, making term abroads accesable to more students and standing in on the U2K committee, · the Faculty review board and the . Academic Affairs Council. Despite the grueling schedule, . Sorum claims that her new position · is fascinating. \Each of the jobs I've had has taught me more about the institu- ·. tion, about it's complexity and the complexity ofrunning it. There are · a lot of different people with a lot of different concerns, it is impor- ; tant to listen to these concerns · while keeping in mind that Union's top priority is education.\ Dean Sorum has the overall well- · being of the college in mind and realizes the importance of striving for excellence in a challenging learning environment.

'\Every year we've done a little better and every year by little tiny · baby steps we have broken our recerds, '·' Dan Lundquist, Dean of Admissions, expressed, and noth- ing was more obvious this Mon- day. There was a record number of visitors to the campus ~ over 20.0 pm~pectives and their family mem- bers made up the more than 400 visitors to Union. There was a record number of minority stu- dents visiting the campus, and in this year's applicant pool there was a 20% increase in the number of academically excellent students. '\When I see the energy and the diversity of these applicants, it's exciting,\ Lundquist said, 'Tve been at Union for nine years, and this is a new level of enthusiasm.\ This enthusiasm was apparent in the faces of the prospectives as they explored the campus. And there could not have been a better day to introduce these students to the school. \On a day like yester- day, it's what people are thinking about college in their mind's eye,\ Lundquist agreed. One prospective student, Derek, said, \The campus is really nice and the students have helped us find \Vh at we're looking for.\ Shannon, another prospective added, ''This school is the prettiest of the ones I've visited. I'm having a really great time.\ Lundquist was equally excited about the day, noting, \There's so mLJch that's so wonderful about being able to spend time with the nervous, excited prospectives.

Recently, Lundquist went to California to recruit for Union. He met with alumni who work in the field of education, worked with a minority recruiting group in Los Angeles and visited local high schools to talk: to students.

Campus News ca:onc.ormettl'lis • October 14, 1999 • Page 5 Vic Fazio, Former Representative, Addresses Union Crowd by Vinny Voleti Staff Writer Union Conegealwn Vic Fazio '65, a very highly involved member of the United States governm.ent, vis- ited the College last week. The college owes this enlightening op- portunity to the newly developed Politicians in Residence Pregra:m .. The program. involves inviting a· well-rounded alum of the College, such as Fazio, who has had a great in.flueilce inthe United States' po .. litical system, to visit for a week and lead a series of events in which he/she can engage with the faculty, students, and other community memberS. After graduating nom Union in 1965, Fazio dmmediately became in- volved with serving the public as · a legislative consultant, and soon after founded The Califomia Jour- nal, a current weli know11literary j oumal that informs its public of politics and government activity in the state of California. Prior to his election to Congress 'in 1978, Fazio served three years on the Califor- nia State Assembly. During his nine terms in Con- gress, Congressman Fazio earned Slo!l-il MillerJCP . . ~-!L . .r Vic Fa?ip addressed a ~rowdea Nott Memoria/last Thursday night. . 'I ,• I • '· • quite a nai:ne for himself.' Tlie'nllin- ber of comrn:lttees that 'fie sat· on included the Appropriations Com- mittee, the Appropriations Sub- committee cin Energy and· Water Development~ the Interior and De- fense Committee; the Military Con' struction Subcommittee, the Com- mittee on Standards of Official Conduct the Democratic Congres- . ' sional Campaign Conunittee, and many more. Before he retired, he was the third-r~g Dem9crat in the\H<lUse of l{epre~entativ~·s, and ' · Cha:imlan of t1ie Democratic Ca~­ cus, It seems quite obvious that Union is most privileged not only to be able to call such a man an alum of the college, buho ais<) have him as a guest. On Thursday night, Fazi() gave a speech on .public service in the · Nott Memo11ul1 that was O)Jen to Union students, faculty, and com- munity memb()rs. In his speech, the former Con- gressman talked about how though the United States govern- ment has been one of the most successful of its time, there isstill a lotto be changed. His chief com- plaint was the failure to recognize and appreciate the efforts of the few men and women who serve the public by hol<Ung a political ()ffice. He descn\bed how this day and age is fullof C<lmmunity members who just sit on the sidelines and wish that the government would improve en its own; a vast major- ity ofthe public has essentiaily dis- connected with .the political sys- tem. After describing; this pf()blem _briefly, Fazio went on to e::x,plain how people ca.n reverse the cur- rent.mindset, md \re a.more posjtive: vjeo/c of p,uJ>l1'(· s,et:Vi.,ce. Fazio encouraged people-espe- cially the yoath- to reinvi.gorate that will hopefully renew people's interest in public service. lie urged people to start by get- involved in their own commu- nities. He predicted that if people just took a little time out of their family life and put it into their com- munity, then the political system will be \built str<()ng- from the bot- tom up.\ He described how real politi- cians arise from beginning their careers in their small communities, and then working to expand their hori.z,ons, as they accumulate a valuable set of political.experiences and ideas. When asked to make a statement addressed to the students of Union College, Fazio stated, \The Nott Terrace community is a great place to start your quest in public service-so instead of just sitting in. school and talking about g()v- ernment reform, you should try and get involved.\ President Hull added to the emi- nence of the night by announcing the establishment of a new Schol- arship in Fazio's name. The aiU1ual scholarship will be awarded to a stu~e.nt :who is ec;mvnitt,ed t9 a ca- reer in public service. Following the lecture, the major- ity of the attendants moved into a more relaxed setting at the Hale House, where they continued an informal political discussion.

Some of these include Professor Jenkins discuss- ing the mea~ing of love, and Pro- fessor Benack discussmg the na- ture of sexuality. Last night, they irivited Profes- sor Ogawa, Professor Jordan and Professor Donaldson to di~cuss the rec.ent controversy surround- ing Mayor Guiliani and an art ex- hibit in New York City. The entire campus community is invited to these discussions, which all come accompanied with a home cooked meal. The question of funding and ex- clusivity has been addressed due to the house's desire to expand their activities. As it stands now, the members of the house all chip- in to buy the food for dinners and their speakers are professors who do not charge for their discussion. Members ofthe house have ex- pressed a desire to open the Sym- posium up to a much wider cam- pus population in order to gain more insight than that of just the twelve men and women who live in the house. Some ideas for fu- ture events include a Stanley Kubrick fihn festival and an Alfred Hitchcock tum festival. In addition they hope to plan a trip to go and see the controver- sial New York City art_ exhibit frrst - • ~~ l • Will the Symposium. r(!ceive tile e1.tra fimdingfor wMch it appiied? han4 ..

However, the S<l,.. ciety, another popular and sac- cessful theme house on camp11s bas been receiving theme house funding as The Society and cltib funding as The Coffeehouse. For those students who do not know, the Coffeehouse is a earn- pus wide event that occurs every Tuesday evening in the Society's house. The Society members are all members of the Coffeehouse; however, they feel that it is impor- tant to point out that there are many members of the Coffeehouse cl11b who do not live. in the Society. This is why they feel that they should be receiving funding for both purposes. So what is the dif- ference between what the Society does and what the Sympo.sium would like to do? Student Forum hasdelayedthe vote for two weeks ·in a row, so it can be assumed that they don'tevenknow. Their have been concerns raised that the Sym- . posium is running into problems · because they are applying for club money under the same name as there theme house. The student body has mixed feelings about this situaticn as well. Some students feel tha.t duel sources of funding are not fair, oth- ers see no reason why a theme house can not exp!llld to a clu.b as well. It should be noted tlrnt the most commonly known theme house on campus, The Society, is one of the only theme houses so far to expand their interests to the campus community in the f()llll of a club. The Society should be allowed to do the same. By allowing the theme houses to ex:pand and form clubs as well, the elitist exclllsivity that surrounds them will gradually be broken down, amd instead ofthe campus being fragmented by sepa- rate interests and limited living space, it will be united by common interests. by Kri~en Zadourian ·)' StCljf Writer f·~.,, Sophomore Melanie Thornton has been a bigsister for abo~tone ye~.

. .. -CampusN.ew\S An Interview with Vic Fazio byJimDeWa11 News Editor Whllt's the biggest difference be- tween the Union College that you went to thirty-five years ago and the on'! that you come back to visit now? I don't know, I haven't been here much, I was here for commencement in 1998. It rllined a little bit, didn't it? President Hull indicated that· it never rained on commencement, and it just proved him not only in en:or, but cata- stro]J'hically wrong because it poured that day. What would be the major difference? First of all, there are women here that would be the major difference. The school is almost twice as large now. I supp()se there's a little bit more infra- structure now, the library's been redone, this building (Social Sciences), actually, wasn't dedicated until after I left. It's now been renovated, but at the time it didn't exist, we didn't have the Olin Center and the'hockey rink. There's a lot more structure here, and of course the campus is now unde~pinned by a much larger endowment. Tlle Nott was in use, but no where near as spectacular, it wasn't in the shape it's in now, by any means. Ohviously, it's a ·l>uilding that was put to use whenever they couldn't think of any other place to put some- thing. It wasn't a centerpiece, by any means. I don't know where fraternity life is today in terms of its importance, it was still a major factor then.· Althougl\. I was a member of Chi Psi, I never lived in the fraternity house, I was a dorm master for two years and then l lived just across the street my fourth year. Directly after you grad~ated from Unii}O~ did you go directly out to Califo'rnia? j ';<,.~: 1·:-l~ Actually, f.w~rked:·a ~unlci'e~ -~~ in Win-<lsor, Vermont building a highway bridge over the Connecticut River from Hanover, NH and Windsor. I put some money in the bank and paid my father back the loan I taken from him f.or the purchase of a Volkswagen Bug. Then I took that acrqs:s the country to Los Angeles to gci~tlirough the CORO pro- gram, whiGh t -~ctually heard about here. ton take a job there, or go back to Cali- fornia? And kind of because California had been a good experience for me, and beca1.1se I had a girlfriend there, l decided to go baek to California, and ultimately, within a few months, went to Sacra- mento, where I took a job with the state assembly. So I worked there from about 1967, 8 until the time I was elected in 1975. And you served there for three years until you were elected in 1978? Right. And tliat was when you were first elected to the House of Represen- tatives'? Yes. Did you ever entertain ideas about s.eeking higher office, one of California's two senatorial seats? No, J· never had any interest in the Sen- ate. First off, it's a very expensive and big leap from Congress to the Senate. You're better off normally, seeking state- wide office and working your way up that ladder. It was also a fact of life that I was also very happy in the House and was moving up in the House leadership, so there was no incentive for me to start all over in the Senate. But beyond that most of the time I'Ve been there, we've had Democratic senators. It is a rare occasion that a senator in California comes from the House. Barbara Boxer was the last example, and no one gave Barbara a chance. When she ran Jhe primary, they thought she'd lose, when she ran in the general election, they thought she'd lose. Her timing was good, and she was successful. But it was a very long shot; I think she was ready to leav~ the House, and figured she'd might as well take a shot at it. l was always not so inuch ca.utiou~, hut just not inter~:sted . in the so-called other bodies, than the i:jouse. .

What was yo-:ur 'toughest moment in the Ho11se.? Was there ever re· !lily one issuE illat was really tough for you? There wer\l probably a number of issues that were tough. for me. l supported the position that. vre shouldn't amend the constitution \() boan flag burning, and my district was ove:f'Mhelmingly in favor of it. And that was always difficult to deal with when it carne to· the veterans' com- munity. I was a strong proponent of equity for gay :~~nq lesbian people, but When the vote .came on gay man:iage which was a velY highly partisan effort to embarrass a lot of people, I ended up voting for the lli 11, after supporting a number of amendments to it, which cre- ated some confusion in the gay and les- bian community. No.t that that was a large element o:f rny constituency, but I didn't like the i:mpression I had to give in that vote, tlunt I was not sympathetic, and that was di:Jficult. I supported the MX missile in the early years when I was there, I was: .a member of the Armed Services Com111ittee initially. In that time frame, C:ar.ter had started and Reagan pursued: it, and I got committed to it in the C~rier years. I was one ()f those Democrats wbo supported it, and that was also very difficult for my base consti.tuents in tile district, the Davis liberals were ag:ainst it. Davis was my political base. \Davis was, as most uni- versities are, <Ull.!i,-\var. Those are some of the things I r~member as being par- ticularly difficlflt issue& to wrestle with during those years- There were tim(js when we had tcugh votes, but I didn't . really struggle (E)() much. I voted against-' the Reagan tax c1.1ts at the very begin- ning of my carreer_. and that was very-- tough.· We rece~y~d overwhelming cards and letters a(9.~pl)rine calls for th~ Re~~a,!l tal(. cut[, wfilcnJ beli~ved woald balfoon the deiicit.

Bradley~ Gephardt aman..g others voted for them and 1\c:)Ver, ever forgave themselves, Sometimes the iOi.lghervotes weren't as tough for me, particularly on economic issues I was fairly confident of my posi~ year's election. Did you ever c:ast a vote th!lt you later regrettEd? Well, I have to say that the one thing that I probably d:id, that, in retrospect, that 1 was sorry I «lid was I voted against action in Ir.aq 011 the premise that we needed to impose sanctions on Saddam Hussein for longer, and I think that was, frankly, it was not purely .partisan. Each party has this te11dency to oppose the other party's president on these mili- tary actions. Bt~t it was naive to as- sume, I was overly concerned about the Republican G11ar<l and the CiA's evall!a• tion of his militazy might turned out to be far less, l;mt m()re importantly, I un~ derestimated his mnwillingness to be af- fected by things like sanctions on ·his economy or his people. I was naive and a little too partisan and maybe made the wrong vote. What was i1 like working under Presidents Carter, Reagan, Bush, and Clinton?

It was all about next What was it like during the 1980's? Reagan was a man that I had not dealt with personally 'Very much, but knew a great deal about, ha,ving worked in Cali- fornia,~ -dunn If his,_gi.lbenuitori~l year~. I · knew Reagan enough 'to be: a bit con- temptuous of Reagan, not that I. didn't respect. ,the nffilCe, ~ui i didn't really think much of Iteagan. He certainly is not, in my view~ an intellect. He's cer- tainly not a ma.n who had a. sense of what the common man needed. I thoug11t his policies were: out of whack, not that I didn't agree V'l'ith certain aspects of them, but in total, they didn't add up. So I was not a fan of Reagan's, I was really not particlllarly willing to be, other than the MX missile issue I mentioned earlier, Where I was part o( their coali- tion, I was not someone who availed myself with social opportunities to .get to know him. l didn't want to, frankly, want to have a Eot to do with him. I did have to say, that George Bush was a man who I ca:me to appreciate me>re on a personal le·vel. Why was that? He was just a lot more able to connnu- nicate. Reagan '\Vas very aloof, very re- moved. He and Nancy wouid not come dow.nsta.irs at the White House Christ~ mas parties. Tlley'd make a cameo ap~ pearance ~nd he gone. They were not people that dealt with the larger corn- municy. Was 'tli.at the general feeling in tbe House then? Yeah. tl!at included a lot of Republi- cans, v.h.o felt kind of dissect by Ron and Nancy. They were not people who had a lot of friends. They stuck to a very small coterie of people in the cabinet, or amorrJ:l their California money people. While George Bush was while probably, clearly, a more Patrician figure, given his fa.1l'lily''' traditional .establishment background, were real'ly easy to be around Geot;ge Bush would come down, as b.e did for years after he left the House to the IIouse gym and hang out with the guys. and work ·Out. His family was just regula:r)Jeople, you'd get to know some of them. He and his wife were vety interested in acconunodating the bipar- tis\ln aspects of life in Congress. Judy (Fazio} would be invited dowh to lunch by Barbara Bush with other Congres- sion~l :s:pouses. Bush was somebody I liked. -very much. I had another reason, l had a daughter who contracted leuke- mia., and ultimately passed away when she ...r.~s 22., and was initially diagnosed at 13, going on 14. And because of the Bush family experience with loss of a child through leuketnia, George Bush would vvrite notes or write her a note. It was very persona'!. Another thing is George Bush really venerated and be- lieved in public service, unlike Ronald Reagan, who was coming through, pass- ing by, and didn't really have any i>ther interest than, in my view, vilifying gov~ ernmen1, and making people feel less comfortable with it. So I made 11 big distinction there, I really like George Bush. And ~f course, Bill Clinton is a presi~ dent is I've had far more contact with~ By that time, I was a much more signifi~ cant pla.yer in thC,'l!o,use,·l Wi.\S ii)volveq in the leadership JWdttrinjfhis:pfesfd~ncMI and g;<Jt to know him quite well. ., p . ~ . \ ' Are JIOU endorsing a par.tituiat'ean~· dillate for the presidential race? I'm supporting Gor'l. There's a very interesting dynamic there because of the re-emergence of 'TonJ~ Coelho, a man whose resig~ natieln you helped force in 1989. No, I didn't help force it. You. didn't? N(), T()ny's an old friend of mine, I ran his campaign fot whip, the last job he held. He's a guy who has occasionally strayed over the line, and I think to that extent, he's been forced to resign and move 011 as he did in the whip situation. That was his own decision caused by his own nading of the tea leaves in terms of 'VIhat he had created for himself and what kind of problems they presented. Do you think any of Coelho's skel- etons in the closet will come. back to han nt Gore? No, I d~n't think so. I think this latest thing with the World Fair in Portugal, first of all, none of it was public money, and secondly .it was all on the margin. T~ny didn't get paid to c.lo it, he put his own money into a lot of it. I think it's a little bit overblown, and cleady, it's a diversion he didn't need. Is Gore suffering from what every- one is calling \Clinton fatigue\? Yes, 1 think he is, just as George Bush was suffering from Reagan fatigue, he's got .fhe same problem. Jlut you think he'll overcome that? I tl1i11k he can, I think he has a good chance of doing it. Whether he will or not, I don't know. There's a lot of ifs and buts there. He's got a long way to go. I don't think he has a clear win in the prirnary race and has a tough race in the general election. Thamk you very much. You're welcome.

Page 8 ·October 14, 1999 Sometimes \Yes'' Isn\t Good Enouglt For First-Year-Student Orientation this year, as in years past, date rape survivor Katie Koestner spoke at Union. She was accompanied by · her friend, Attorney Brett Sokolow. As part of the presentation,Koestne1 recounted the details of the night of her rape and included statistic~ about the frequency and prevalence of rape on college campuses. At the conclusion of her speech, Sokolow addressed the audience. He asked them to be the jury about a case which had recently been. decided. The case involved two college students at a party. The woman arrived at the party and consumed a total of five alcoholic be-verages. The mal). arrived at the party a few hours later and also began consuming alc()- holic beverages, however he only drank two drinks. On the dance floQr, the two met for the first time. At this point Jello shots were offered t<J · those at the party. The female consumed two Jello shots while in tile company of the male. She decided that she wanted to leave the party and he offered to walk her horne. They arrived at h.er dorm safely at which point the man opted to leave. The woman asked the manto stay · and he complied. They talked for a while and were getting to know each other. During their conversation, the woman began f()feelsick. She left the room for the bathroom where she vomited. She retumed to the room and the two began kissing. The intimacy progressed and became more serious until the woman felt sick again. She returned to the bathro<Jm where she vomited for a second time. When she retu.medto her room the intimate encounter continued. The woman asked the man to have sexual intercourse with her. The man complied with her reqll~st. After sleeping for a few hours, the man awoke and decided to return to his room. He wrote his name and number on her white board before :Fetwning home. When the woman awoke, she noticed the name md number on her board and was confused because she did not know that name or that number. She decided to call the person to determine why his name and number were on the board. The man explained to her that they bad engaged in sexual intercourse the previous evening dter spending time together at the party and in her room. The woman claimed she did n()t remember meeting him at the party or inviting himhackto her room, n()r did she remember having sexual intercourse with him. The woman brought rape charges against the man and he was coll- victed of rape in a court oflaw. This scenario is not an uncommon one, especially- on a college cam- pus. Every weekend at-Union students meet at parties~ at which drll!l<s are served. In many cases, students opt to accompany one another 1() the bedroom. Some decide to engage in sexual intercourse. Some are sober. Some are not.. Those who are not face the risk ofbeing accused 1>f rape, regardless of who initiates the sexual encounter. In New York state, the law reads \specifically if a person is forced to nave sexual inter- course or if he or she is unable to consent, the behavi()I ofthe perpetra- tor is considered rape. A victim is considered unable to consent if men- tally incapacitated, physically helpless (for example, <iue to drug oralco- hol consumption), mentally defective, asleep, or less than 17 years of age_\ This information was taken from the date rape and sexual assault information booklet that Union College publishes for students. The purpose of this information is to educate both the men andwomen of the Union College community. Men usually do not concern them- selves with issues such as date rape because theyd()notthink of them- selves as perpetrators. Nevertheless, the aforementi(lned case indicate:s that those assumptions are false. In addition, many of us think that date · rape does not happen at Union College. However, that assumption is also incorrect Statistics and reported cases indicate that there are i!l- deed date rapes at this institution, and those figures do not include the numerous unreported cases. We hope that with this knowledge you will thinkofth.e consequences before engaging in sexual activity and hopefully prevent future date rape cases.

Some companies, although ellgi- neering in focus, had positions in areas such as Human Resolll'ces and Public Relations. General diversity? Some 750 invitations were ex- tended, and numerous foHow-up calls were made to increase diverse representation. Certain fields, such as Finance, Consulting .and Engineering recruit in the fall be- cause of high demand and large budgets. Career fields such as teaching, adyertising, publishing, human resources etc. do n.ot re- cruit until later in the year an<i do not hire in large numbers. We were able to get some representation here. However, as these areas do not tecruit very actively any- where, we work to provide access through off campus interviews, alumni on career panels; and alumni contacts for networking. Nonetheless, the Career Fes.1ival offers everyone the opportunity to begin networking with employers, graduate programs and especially alumni to gain leads and sugges- tions for the fields in which they are interested. More graduate schools other than law? Law schools travel to recruit at this time of year, and we turned away a number due to lack of space. In seeking diversity, the following were represented: Architecture, Biological Sciences, Business, Chiropractic, Computer Informa- tion Systems, Deaf and General Education, Language, Literature and Communications, Medical Sci- ences, Osteopathic Medicine, Pharmacy, Public Affairs, Social Services, Podiatry. \If Investment Banking is your forte then the festival was for you\ Two companies at the Career Festival are in Investment Banking.

The Career Festival introduced a range of pos- sibilities. A Psychology major, for example, in researching W()U}d have found opportunities with Andersen Consulting, Center for th.e Dis- abled, Residential Opportunities, Delmar Publishers, Ecldy Senior Care, Enterprise Rent-A-Car, Kaplan Educational Centers, Liberteks.com (Tri-City Computing Magazine), Living Resources, Lockheed Martin, Maxirnum Man- agement, Quad Graphics, Rennselaer ARC, State Farm Insur- ance, The Princeton Review, etc. To respond to some ofy()ur con- cerns: The Career Festival ~as \For All Students.\ The Career Festival offeJed full time, part-time, internships and co- ops in many different areas: Pub- lishing, Marketing, Journalism, Ed- iting, Government, Health and Hu- man Services, Engineering, Fi- nance, Education and Non-Profit \If one is not an Engineer, Economics major or Computer Scientist then one was out ofluck\ Actually, the following career fields were represented: B11siness, AM Communications & Media, Con- sulting, Education, Engineerin.g & CS, Environment, Finance, Gov- ernment and P'ublic Policy, Health & Human Services, Law, Research & Science, Sales & Marketing. Some companies, although emgi- neering in foc:us, had positions in areas such as Human Resou:rces and Public Re.lations. General diversity? Some 750 invitations were: ex- tended, and numerous f@llow-up calls were made to increase diverse representatio-n. Certain fields, such as Finance, Consulting and Engineering recruit in the fall be- cause of high demand and l:arge budgets. Career fields sucih as teaching, adv-ertising, publi:slning, human resources etc. do nott re- cruit until later in the year an.d do not hire in large numbers. We were able to get s.ome representation here. However, as these areas do not recruit 'Very actively any- where, we work to provide access through off -campus inter'Vi-ews, alumni on career panels, and alumni contacts for networking. Nonetheless, the Career Festival offers everyone the opportunity to begin networlting with employers, graduate programs and especially alumni to ga'in leads and st~gges­ tions for the fields in wh.ic:h they are interested More graduate schools other than law? Law schools travel to recruit at this time of year, and we turned away a number due to lack of space. In seeking diversity, the following were represented: Architecture, Biological Sciences, Business, Chiropractic, Computer Informa- tion Systems, Deaf and General Education, Language, Literature and Communications, Medical Sci- ences, Osteopathic Medicine, Pharmacy, Public Affairs, Social Services, Podiatry. \lflnvestment Banking is your forte then the festival was for you\ Two companies at the Career Festival are in Investment Banking.

Congress Deals with Test Ban Treaty by MichaelS. McGuire Copy Editor By the time this Week's issue of Concordiensis is published and available to the Union College coll1munity, the United States Sen- ate will have either voted on the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, post- poned it either to next year or be- yond, or, in a move led by Senate Democrats, voted to move on to another matter. The controversy comes in light of Congress' sudden willingness to debate and resolve the issue, after delaying it for two years. The treaty would ban all underground testing of nuclear weapons, effec- tively eliminating any method for testing nuclear weapons, with at- mospheric tests al).~eady banned. The treaty has been signed by 154 nations, though, there are con- flicting reports as to how many have actually ratifted: it. The New York Times and The Los Angeles Time report that 51 nations have ratified the treaty, while CNN re- ports 48. The t:J;eaty will not go into effect iftheUnited States Sen~· ate does not ratify it. Ratification of a treaty requires a two-thirds majority of the senators present at the time of the vote or 67 votes if.dll 00 Senators arepresent. Ac- cording to CNN, supporters oftlle treaty are at least 15 votes shy of that.number. . . , ·. Despite· •previou;sly Tefusing to do so, President Bill Clinton sent a letter to Senate Majority Leader T:rent Lott requesting that the vote on the treaty be delayed. The let- ter reads as follows, as reprinted in The New York Times on the web (www.nytimes.com): Dear Mr. Leader, Tomorrow, the Senate is sched- uled to vote on the Comprehen- sive Test Ban Treaty. I firmly be- lieve the Treaty is in the national interest. However, I recognize that there are a significant number of senators who have honest dis- agreements. I betieve that proceed- ing to a vote under these circum- stances would severely harm ·the national security of the United States, damage our relationship with our allies, and undermine our historic leadership over 40 years, ToWhit, ·~ Thanks for listening.

Treaty on the Senate floor. Sincerely, Bill Clinton On NBC's Meet the Press, De- fense Secretary William Cohen said, ·~we are in a situation right now where we're about to send a signal to th.e rest of the world that we are not as serious about con- trolling the spread of nuclear weap- ons as we should be:\ In order to make any real strides to strengthen the nuclear non-pro- liferation cause, the United States must lead the charge. As General Henry H. Shelten, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said, on Meet the Press, \If the national se- curity were in any way going to be damaged, the joint chiefs would never recemrn.e.nd that we :ratify this t:J;eaty.\ ,t Jon Czwartadci, a spokesman for Senator Lott, told CNN: ''The writ- ten request is merely a first step. As the majority leader has stated all along, not only must this treaty be pulled from consideration, an agreement must be reached that it not come up again this Congress.\ Senator John McCain, Republi- can Presidential Candidate, said, with respect to a request in writ- ing, \I think a handshake and a commitment is the way we should do business in Washington.\ This request from Senator Lott is highly controversial. and has political implications outside the United States. As National Secu- rity Advisor Sandy Berger said in an interview with CNN; \I think it's a mistake for the president to say to the world that the United States Th.e Personq s! Mags, Beep. Beep. Beep.

Ifonce ev- ery four years the President of the United States were to be left with his hands tied by Congress, then America would be at a huge disad- vantage. It would be a blow to both our power and our prestige. De- fense Secretary Cohen agrees, !.Ol<:l.'vJ.ul~::.. \I don't think you should force any president -RepubliCan or Democrat- to give uppresiden- tiaJ powers during the course of 1ris administration.\ . There is no excuse for the Sen- ate not to ratify tl}e treaty. As ~ec­ retary of State Madeline Albright said on ABC's This Week, \We have stopped testing unilater- allw.. . The point here is that we Jl~ed a tool that will prevent the other countries from testing. We lose nothing and we gain the pos- sibility Qf ending this kind of test- ing.\ The basic issue. here for the ~­ publicans in the Senate is not whether or not the treaty is good for the United States, or the wotld as a whole. It is not whether or not we will be able to sleep at night, feeling that much safer about the severely limited spread of nuclear weapons. The issue for Senate Republicans is this: If they can tar- nish President Clinton on another major issue, this time hurting his reputation globally, then perhaps it will tarnish the reputation of Al Gore as well, making it easier for the Republican candidate to defeat him in the general election. The Republicans are once again show- ing that their party leadership is not willing to break from their com- mitment to partisan ideals, even when the reputation and safety of the nation is at stake.

Page 10 ·~ ·< .; • • • .,. • . _..,' \\·· ' Van Dyke Earns Rave Reviews .. by Kristina Dorne Staf!Writer Among freshmen at Union, it is an established fact that other than Friendly's or McDonald's, eating choices off-campus are limited. However, when parents corne up for that all import~nt Parents' Weekend, where t() dine is a major concern. Some Moms and Dads enjoy experiencin~ dining hall life and therefore insist that the whole family parade down to West Din- ing. However, this past Friday there was one legenda1y restaurant in Schenectady that was packed with Union College students and fami- lies. That restaurant was the VanDyke. Many students at Union know the VanD:yke only as the place that offers great Ladies Night drink specials and makes the best home brewed beer around. How- ever, the VanDyke also offers a full dining menu. I ha<l heard many good things about the VanDyke before I had even stepped foot in the restau- rant. I had heard .enough positive feedback that when my parents told me they were visiting, I decided that this was the (llace I wanted to eat Friday night Unfortunately, by the time we arrived, around 7:00, the restaurant was completely full. The fine dining room was closed for the nigltt. The VanDyke may look small from the outside, but is actually fairly s:izablie. The wait was about thirty minutes, which was fine because there is enough at- mosphere and a full ba:u to keep you occtlpied while yo11 wait. When i1 is a b:it warmer, you can alsQ go outside and sit on the garden patio filled with round tables and umbrellas, overlooking · the microbrewery, · which is quite a sigh.t. While we were waiting, the hostess was very friendly an apologetic that we had to wait so long. She really went out of her way to make us comfQrtable while we were waiting. The VanDyke is actually part club and part restaurant. There was a show going on U(lstairs while everyone was eating downstairs. Although the music was a bit loud, it made the atmosphere more fun and festive. [f you'Ie interested, there is a full schedule ofthe vari- ous 11erfonners that wilL be at the VanDyke each week. W1Lat is in- teresting about the d€cO>r if the VanDyke is that in some ways, it resembles a high Victorian brothel. The Hostess sits in a cut box of- fice booth; The upstaihl is blocked offby some lovely red <ll:aJleS. The drapes are drawn in a way that makes the upstairs look fo:rbidden. The upstairs fme di)limg room is mo:re fotmal and is a great place for a romantic date or a spc:cial occa- sion. The downstairs is: known as the \tavern\ and is a c~s~L eatery. Tlte menu, while notpa.rticularly large is quite varied ami offers a decent selection of f01o-d~ High- lights are the crabcak::es, grilled vegetable or chickell ~andwiches on fresh foccaccia, wood-fired pizz~t, salmon, soups and specialty salads, as well as larger dinners. They also boast some. of the best french fries and nachos in town! I opted for the Chicken Caesar Salad,. which was absolutely deli- cious. The lettuce was fresh and crispy and the dressing light and flavorful. TI1e chicken was grilled to perfection and marinated in an herb sauce. While the food was top-notch, the service was somewhat lacklus- ter. This may have been due to the fact that the restaurant was abso- lutely packed and they .seemed to be under- staffed. Our waitress was rather shmt with us · . and did not check back · periodically. She did not bring ot refill our water without us reminding her several time:;;. We als<> had to wait about an hour and a half for our food. When my fa: ther inquired about what was tak- ing so long, our waitress was very offended and annoyed. Th:e fme quality of the food and the restaurant more than made up for the service. There are many qualities that set the V anDykeapart from other restaurants in the area. It appears to be a very \fancy\ res- taurant, but the prices are perfectly moderate. The dimly litroom:makes for a comfortable and cozy eating experience. The hostesses are very friendly and hospitable. Although I did not attend the jazz concert upstairs, 1 am sure that it made for enjoyable entertainment after a good meal. Last but not least is that superb quality of the food. I urge you to try the Chicken Caesar Salad. It is to die for! There are many other reasons to choose the VanDyke. I think I will definitely bring my friends back when it is not soc~;owded. The res- taurant is equipped for many din- ers. They have a fairly large park- ing lot and there is also plenty of street parking. The VanDyke is only about a ten minute walk from Union Campus, down Union Street. After dinner, take a stroll through the Stockade. It is also a five minute walk from the beautiful Mohawk River. Sce- nic strolls after a lovely meal. It is not too much of a trek for fresh- men and anyone else who doesn't have a cat on campus. Go eat and drink at the VanDyke, you wilt not be disappointed!

Her debut al- bum, TheMiseducation ofLauryn Hill, was released oil August 25, 1998 and had the highest first week sales by a female artist. Since then, it has gone multi-platinum and has won many awards, including five Grammys. Accordmg to MTV's Tina Johnson, however, four mu- sicians are suing her for not giving them credit for working on her al- bum with her for a year. The four mus.icians, who call themselves New-Ark Entertain- ment, claim that they helped her write some of the songs in the al~ bum and that they co-produced it. They hold that they were given a publishing deal in. 1997 with a $100,000 advance for rights of the lyrics they were going to write. They want·recognition for what they say they have done and they want a share of the profit. They say that they have hand- written evidence to-prove that they havre written some of the lyrics on the album. Vada Nobles, one of the group members 1 said, 'To me, I think Lauryn is a sweet person and it is in her heart that .she say it. At the same time I look at it as. a per- so11.tbat could be misled, by maybe people atound her.\ Though LaurynHill did not mak- ing; any comments about the case, I personally do not think that she wollld lie ;;tbout something like this. What motive would she have for lying? The musicians, ou the other hand,. do have a clear motive. They ha~e seen the enormous success of the album and the at11Qunt of m()ney it has made andsin::iply want a p:ieceofit. I don'tthinkthat.han,d- writing is very strong evidence.

For example, she was very loyal to her band members, Prakazrel \Pras\ Micltel and Wyclef Jean, when she was with the Fugees.

The end of the world is coming, or so some people would like you to think. I, on the other hand, be- lieve that the damn thing has al- ready gone to hell, and we are just too stupid to have noticed. Now, some of you might be saying \Gee what an optimistic view of things, Eugene, everything going okT' Things could not be better, except there is this one little thing that keeps bothering me. It pops in and out of my brain at the most inop- portune times. It is kind of like when you think you see something out of the comer of your eye, but every time you look to focus in on it, whatever you wanted to look at is gone. A better example is when you're flipping from radio station to radio station and for some rea- son you always get the last two sec- onds of a song you really like. And because you only get the last two seconds of the song you are con- stantly trying to figure out what the name of the song is. So what does a song on the radio have to do with the end of the world? Are you go- ing to make a point here, or are you just rambling on? Well, I amdo- ing a little of both to tell you the truth. The werld as yon know has not come to an end. So let me just clear that up. However, my world and the world of five hundred and forty-two people is coming to an end, and ratherrapidly I might add. Six weeks have gone by so far this year. That leaves, if my math is correct, only twenty-four more weeks to explore, expand, and leave behind little bits of a place where we have spent the last three years and six weeks. \Well Eu- gene, a lot of time for you guys to do stuff.\ Or, if that response is not to your liking try this one, \Well Eugene, after three some odd years you should have done everything that you wanted to do.\ When people give me these responses, they are missing the point of what I am trying to tell them. In twenty- four weeks, we seniors graduate. Our theses will be completed, our senior prqjects, papers, musical works and flnal newspaper articles will have been submitted and re- turned. We will have taken all the tests possible, the GRE's, the MCAT's, and the LSAT's. We leave behind us the bounding brook, the balls of academia, and even the safety netof our parents. We are in a sense reborn, cast from a relatively safe environment into the unknown. Scary huh? So now with this view, this Mack truck of realty barring down uponus,haveyou done everything that you wanted to do? If you have, does it matter in the long run? You scored a goal, given a speech, acted on stage, ran a club, became presideni of the student body. Good for us, yet do we have friends that we can call next year when some of us are into hour eighty-five of a ninety hour work week? Will your friends be there when you are freaking out because tomorrow is the first day you teach that class of incoming freslnnen in an introduction class to whatever subject you use to flll in the blank. I think I have them but do you? The world is corning to an end. Do you have people who got your so, I:Jec:allise be the people who will be in the same situations that you are in. But what about other aspects of life? Have you gotten up the cour~ agete argue with a professor over a point, any point? Let me tell you that they love that. Itdoes not mat- ter if you are right or wrong, but only that you h.ave done it. Have you gone up to that girl or boy that you have wanted to talk to since freshman year but for some reason have not? Go up to them and strike up a conversation with them. The school is small enough that a)they most likely know of you, b) are not going to bite ·Off your head (or for that fad any other part of your body) and bstly c) they might feel that same way about you, too. Have you gone against the norm at least once while :you have been here at Union, defied your friends, stood up for yourself or others just be- cause you kne-w what was going on was wrong/stttpid/lame? Have you been your own person? Or are you just a piece of clay ·that gets molded by others? Once our world ends I want to at least to know what type of person I can be. What are your limits, how much can you take? Does it matter that your are the best in Beer PongJBSing your Profes- sors/slacking off! I don't think so. What matters is if you can you de- fend yourself in anargument, make clear and concise points. Can you put your ideas on paper in such a way that you have influenced people to your point of view? In short, have you learned to express yourself in such away that people will take you seriously? The end is cornm,g, so yo-u People have complained that school has cllangedin these first weeks of the 1999-2000 school year. So what, is that the only way that you can be happy is by going til a fraternity party every week? I think not. l know many of you, and you have the same feelings that I do, after three years pushing my way through a crowd of people to get a piss poot beer is not my id~a of fun. \But then what are we to do, Eugerte?'~ Well, my answer til that is you better figure it out before the world ends. There are no frater- nity parties in the real world. The only thing in the real world is what you take.outof this one, ancl an occasional night out where getting plastered with :friends and coworkers makes for a great week. While this might be a very cynical way to lo()k at the way things willbe next year, remem- ber this, wnen yoa have a job there is no 1VVay that you can rock and roll all day and party every night. Sorry, but it is true. You know what the great thing about all of this is? Well, of course you d<m't, but neither do I, and I thimk: the mystery is the best part. Jumping into the un.- lmown, wi-th only ·our skills to make us or break us. I, for one, welcome the challenge. To put my mark oo. something bigger and better is a challenge that I think all ofhllllllUlity cannot re- sist. IndividU:als add to this world and make it better. Without them, where wowld we be today? That is what hopefully we have be- come in three years. Hopefully, over the next twenty- four weeks we will become even more individualisti-c. While we might all dress alike, and be into the same music and even a good number of us appear to be apa- thetic, at heart weare all different. Not just different physically, but mentally, racially, religiously and sexually. It is thesedifferencesthat will help us survive the cataclys- mic ending of this world. it will help us to fight off the blindness that living in this cocoon has left over our eyes, and like the phoe- nix each of us will rise and speed off into the sunrise of a new dawn. While I know that is corny, if you think about,the metaphor, it is true. People view us completely differ- ently after we cross that stage and accept om diplomas. We are in a sense new people in aNew World .. If you like, think of y{)urself as an ancient explorer setting foot for the first time on a distant shore that has never felt the tread of man. Our own little expedition is statting, and while people have taken this journey before, the .road is always shifting before us, and so no two outcomes are the same. lt all comes full orrcle, too, when one really thinks a~ out it. It is a lot like that song on the radio. Otice you get a hold of it, it always seems to loose some of the magic it had for you. The chase, the desire to know all about it, is always more enjoyable thanactually just sitting back and listening to it. And that ladies and gentlemen is how we must view life leading up to and after gradt1ation. I Can't Believe I'm Not Butter! by Deric Harrington Staff Writer Wow, I'm back here again? Seems as though you just can't get rid of me nowadays. First off, I'd like to address a very important is- sue to me, and I'm sure to most men on this campus. That issue is that of the \V stream.\ Now, for those of you that don't know what it is, I'd like to give some back- ground (although not too much, or else I'm going to be edited). The \V Stream\ happens when a guy relieves himself. The term \V\ is referring to the direction of urine. (side note: now this is the kind of thing I'd love to see the Science and Technology section just try to tackle) Now, on to the discussion (ok, it's not so much a discussion, it's more like questions) ... Does anyone know where we get this freak-of-nature stream from? Even better ... how do we get rid of it? Th.ese are the thoughts that probe my mind (and apparently my bladder) all day long. It's kind of like trying to figure out how they get that beefy spicy taste into a Slim Jim (then again, who cares, I'm just gonna snap into it!). I... am a victim ... I'm sure you're all sad for me, right? Well, before you are, let me just tell you what I'm a victim of. I'm a victim of \crazy pop-tart Iovin.\ That's right, every week, my pop-tarts fight my Doritos in a battle of epic proportions. Of course, to the vic- tor goes the spoils of war ... to be eaten by me (with all the references to food this week, you'd think that someone out there would try to sponsor me, or send me oodles of food with which try to gain my favor, but no such luck ... although something is in the works for me to start pmmoting Howlers, be- cause we all know they're really in desperate need for people to call them ... wait, no they're not). Attention wrestling fans, ECW is coming to Schenectady! For those ofyou that don't know what ECW is,. it's Extreme Champion- ship Wrestling. If you follow wrestling at all, you know a bunch of people that have wrestled there before .. , Anyway, it's taking place on the 21, at the Center City Sportsplex. I can't suggest going there enough. It's a lot of fun. If you don't believe me, listen to my friend John, who once said, \It's a lot of fu.n\ ... although I forget what he was referring to at the time ... oh well, whatever. Cmrently, I'mbeing held at (well, not exactly gunpoint, so let's aU just say \really sharp object point\ in- stead). You might be asking why. Well, I'll tell you, and once again, you may breathe a sigh of relief (not too much relief though, or you might experience the aforemen- tioned \V stream\). I'm currently tied to a chair in the Concordy of- fice, because my article \was not long enough\. As it turns out, 99% of the time, people are complaining that I'm not long enough ... I mean my articles ... get your minds out of the gutter, people. My stomach is grumbling. I'm not exactly sure why (or if that too might be closely tied into the \V stream\) but I fear that it might be because I was watching Aliens, and I fear that an alien may be coming through my chest at speeds of up- wards 300 NJ.P.H ... and needless to say, it's frightening, because most aliens are only corning through my chest under t11e legal speed limit, so I'm going to go out and get campus security to capture the bastard. For all those wondering ... I brushed my teeth last night. .. aren't you proud of me? I also cleaned my ears. WOOHOO! LORDY LORDY, I'M HAVING BIS- CUITS T()NIGHT! (sadly, I don;t know where that came from). A lot of people have been com- ing U}} to rne, telling me that my colunin h2s. a lot of repressed anger in it To those people, I\d like to say 11te following (prepare small chilc:lren, by turning the;ir heads) .... I\M NOT ANGRY! I'M AS HAPPY AS CAN BE, SO CUT ME SOME SLACK, OR I'LL CUT YOUR ARMS AND LEGS OFF ... and putthem in a paper bag, -then give them out at Hallowee11 to trick or treat- ers. That rerniildsme, this year I'm going to all the Halloween p~­ ties dressed as a stick. That way~ everyone's goillg to be like \hey ... tllete's a stick\. Little will they know .the joke is on them ··- BWA-HA-HA!! I can see it now, everyone is just go- ing to think tlut I'm a stick (granted..... a really big stick_ .. maybe even a yardstick ... al- though that seems a bit unlikely, because l\m not going to be able to measu:re things for people.) and disgaised as a stick, people everywhere are j'llSt going to pass me by, when really, I'll be just plotting for the systematic return of the stick people to campus! I mean ... err ... what I meant to say was that I like Pepsi (a response simply driven by the lack ofCoke (side note: I mean the cola bever- age) on this campus (side note: now that I think of it, there may be a lack of the other kind of Coke too, to be honest, I never really thought about it before)). Well, by the way, that the moon is slowly rising over the ... chair? Wait that's not the moon outside that's just my crazy friend Adam flashing his bu.1tocks offto every- one ... what a crazy kid. Well, any- way, I'll continue on my merry way to the end of the column now, on the left, you~n see many farm animals. Please keep your hands in the column, and all other ap- pendages too, thank you. Once again 1 I have been your tour guide, any questions or comments (but no bullets or darts) call be directed to me at: SlapyMcgee@aol.com.

Features tl!nmorbimlli6 .. Q(tober 14,.1999 ·Page 13 Asian Persuasion Jane's Insane World by Philip Cho Staff Writter Life is short. I really didn't re .. alize this until my cousin passed away three yeats ago. Iguess even at my college age, I assumed that young people are immortal and live until they get old. Apparently, this is not so. I .guess the statistics on people dying should have told us this. But, for some reason, we choose not to believe all that data. I'm not saying I'm afraid of death. I'm afraid of the insecurity in life. I guess the mirror image I had about life got shatteFed when my cousin died. He was only 26 years old. And to top it off, he died in a sense- less car accident. I guess death doesn't really discriminate. It is equalopportunity. But, I guess it's about time for me to mov:e on. Once someone dies, they can't come back to life. After all, life is nota movie. Which brings me to another point. Live life smelling the roses. We, especially as college students, often forget to dn that School work (and parties) take much ·of our time here, but will those be memories we remember .from col- lege? Probably not. What do we remember, anyway? I have no idea.. I forget things all the time. But I clo remember a little, and they certafuly are not schoolwork or parties. All I know is that life is fragile.

This :year in particalar,. it being the Millenium :and all, I would not expect the school to have us trav- -eling on Ja.cnuary 2, 2000 to return to school. Personally, I would push that back a weelc, just in-case there is a breakdow11, of the current social system that is in place, and so we're not mtpped in Schenectady for the ens1ting chaos. Finally, if religious holidays that a large percentage of the school observes happen to fall on a school day, I woudd cancel classes out of respect to that segment of the population and for the fact that many of ()tlr students leave the campus. Every fall term, if the Jewish New Year happens. to fall on the weekend, Union becomes a ghost town, beca.use people just head home in droves. If it were to occur during the week, I would expect a similar re- sult, and S() f would also schedule around an::y such occurrence. W()tld. I'm tired of reality right n.()W.

From this article onward, I plan to describe the geology ofthe \Place of the Week,\ which will be known from now on as \Field Trip of the Week.\ Thanks for bearillg with me and the new format._ .here we go!! So, this week's Field Trip takes us out to the Plotterkill Preserve, over in Rotterdam. To get to the preserve, go down Erie Boulevard, and get on I-890 going west, towards Amsterdam. Stay on this road until the Campbell Rd. exit (the Rotterdam Square Mall exit). Get ()ffhere and g'o up around the mall to the stop- light just before Burger King. At the light, go right and up the hill. At the .fork in the road by the big stone . chmch, bear right. This road will go straight for a while and you'll cross a set of railroad tracks. You want to go right at the frrst light after the rail- . road tracks. There will be little brown signs indicating the way to Plotterkill at the intersection. The preserve is about two miles ahead on the right. You can't miss it. There ue two parking spots I know of at the preserve. One is on the road you take at the light, the other is on a road that goes off to the right with signs to the parking area at the inter- section. At either parking spot, you'll start walking down into the park. The first parking area is. at th.e meadof the gorge and the sec- ond l>:til:J.gs you in from the foot of the: gorge. Frc)]ll. above you. know that the Plotterkill Preserve contains a larg.e gorge. A gorge is folilled when a stream cuts down throtagb theiJedrock of the area and makes a stee:]Jly descending valley cotl- ta:inin.g a stream. The Plotterkill gorge is c11t do\Wn. through the Schenect11.d:y Formation of the Ordociciao.. These rocks were deposited i:n a sinking; basin about 450 million yea:rs ago. The rocks are a serries ofs.anstones and shales that alter- nat-e all the way through 1h.e gor:ge. These rocks are the result of a series of tubidites, or sedi· me11t n()ws, that came into tile sinkmg basin. A twbidite is a sedimentary struc1U:re where thick sandsto<Jne beds are followed by a fining up- wa:ad se<J.uence of rocks.

The heatvier particles, primarily, but notal- W!IYS; bigger particles, settle <1ut fir~t and smaller, lighter particles settle <lUt last. This l~ads to the timing U]lward se'luence of rocks. The waterfalls in the gorge are formed where resistant sandstone beds form oa\'caprock\ for the falls. This means. that the sandstone is harder than the shale and forms a lip over wllich the water can fall and erode tbe softer sediments be- low. The rock:s of Plotterkill were deposited in front of the incoming Taconic Highlands. Back in the Ordoviciam, a time period roughly 450milli{)n. years ago, the Taconic Mountains were colliding with the then eastern edge of North America. The rising mountains were erooded and the sediments were dep'()sited in a basin to the west. The incoming mountains were riding; over the western plate, causing tile basin to sink at an alarming rate. With the sinkillg basin, the deep water could take a lot of sed]ment. Therefore, we see about 1.5 kilometers of Schenech.dy Formation in this area . The Scllenectady Formation is relatively llmren of fossils, but if you look hard enough, you can fmd some. The fossils in this for- mation consist maimly of grapto- lites and sea weed. Graptolites look like pencil marks on the rock and are about two inches long. So, nQ;W you know a little about the geology ()f the Plotterkill Pre- serve. Next week: a description of last wecek's Thatcher Park.

Presented below are two quoted passages from people on both sides of the argument. Los Angeles, May 22, 1998 - The Ayn Rand Institute today branded the antitrust assault on Microsoft as being immoral and anti-American. MichaelS. Berliner, executive director, said, \Microsoft and other victims of antitrust pros- ecution are being punished for the same moral values that have helped make America the beacon of the world: hard work, creativity, achievement. The producers are being punished for their ability and success. Unlike the kings of tbe past and governments of the present, Microsoft has acquired its wealth, not by confiscation but by production- by creating products that other people want to pur- chase.\ BiU Gates -. no, less than the poorest citizen- has the right to his property and to the pursuit of his own happiness. He should not have to justify his profits by ap- pealing to \the good of society\ - in a nation of free individuals, no one exists as a servant of oth- ers.

We prepare for a large- scale assault on the region with air and ground assaults coordinated between several countries. Then, in the midst of battle, our radar screens go blank, radio channels go dead and troops are left .on their own. The U.S. has fmally met its match. The scenario described above is exactly what the pentagon hopes to avoid with the establishment of Cyberwarfare, reported in Friday's edition of The New York Times. Computers have become prevalent in all aspects of life in America, al- lowing for efficient information management. This has provided many advantages for us, but it could also be a weakness. Inf.<>r,.. mation is important in warfare for the coordination of troop move- ments and for maintaining infra- structure. A1though the prospect of electronic attack may seem far- fetched, many threats are already present in the world today. How- ever, even with these reasons, the development of a cyberwarfare program must not lead to sacrifices of the individual right to privacy. The U.S. military has become in- creasingly dependent on infor- mation. Communication between troops and commanders is vital. Currently, data from spy satellites and images from the battlefront al- low commanding officers to coor- dinate troop movements. In the future, individual soldiers may have their own access to this in- formation. Any disruption could result in a crippling blow. In a less di.J:ect sense, informa- tion is vital to industry. Factories depend on information about ship- ping and processing, and banks and stock exchanges also rely on electronic information. Disrupting the infrastructure of an enemy country has ()ften been used in warfare in the past, and as our in- dustry becomes more reliant on electronic information, this could make u~ more vulnerable. Although it is unlikely that a small Eastern European country could bomb a factory in the U.S., they could do an equal arp.ount of damage by crashing its computer system. Electronic threats have already shown themselves in the recent past. Government sites have been an attractive target for hackers. Breaking into one of these sites can give access to larger networks. to which they are connected. Last year, it was discovered that com- puter systems located irt China were initiating a widespread, low- level probe of US systems. This activity, known as a \ping is used to determine the structure of a net- work. Although it caused no dam- age, it may have been an effort to fmd weaknesses in the systems for later attack.

-I Page 16 ·October 14, 1999 • One of the England's Deadliest Rail Crasbes in History by David Cruner Staff JV.dter On Tuesday, Octeber 5 the world witnessed another great trag- edy. There wasn't any shooting or dreadful natural disaster, but two trains collided. So far, the death toll has reached 70, but authorities .have not even begun to unravel loads of debris that are most likely covering sev- enty more. Both of the train driv- ers were killedon impact. The collision took place when an outbound Thames Train crossed in front of an inbound, high-speed Frist Great Western Train west of London's Paddington Station near residential Ladbroke Grove. Authorities are yet to file blame; their investigation is far from over. Tony Thompson, British Transport Police spokesman, believes that such an atrocity will take weeks to disentangle. Yet there is speculation that the outbound train proceeded to go upon a red signal. The following Thursday, British authorities began to allow griev- ing survivors and close family and friends to visitthe site o\fthe crash, and begin to come to terms with what took place a mere two days before. Prime Minister Tony Blair led a grief-stricken nation, stating the day after the crash, \Clearly this had been the most appalling, dreadful tragedy, and we now lutve to brave ourselves for an even higher death toll.\ This is Britain '.s worst rail crash in over fifty years.

Many belieYe the Ewopean sys- tem to be one of, if not the, most advanced and proactive train sys- tems in the world .. In.some respects th:is is true, yet there have been multiple failures over the past few decades that have raised such issu~s, in England par- ticularly. In 1997, a passenger train col- lided with a freight train at Southall station in west London, kiUing seven people and n~juring about 150. In 1988, three 'trains crashed during the morning rush hour at Clapham Junction in south Lon- don, killing 35. In 1973, 10 people were killed and 94 hurt when an express train derailed at Ealing in west London. The rail .system is n<lt as \safe\ as it is believed to be, and there- fore needs reconsideration. Rail workers and passengers alike have a legitimate concern, and the. British government and its rail management must address these issues, along with a host of others, if they are to remain tech- nically advanced in terms of com- muter train service. Train crashes do not happen of- ten; studies have shown that they ate one of the safest ways to travel, more so th:an traveling by car, yet should violent incidents such as London's most recent rail accident continue this somewhat surreal fear may turn into justified real- ity. Donald Trump Forms Exploratory Committee --------------- by Stephen Nemeth Staff Writer The year 2000 presidential race took an interesting tum last Friday with the announcement from bil- lionain: real estate tycoon Donald Trump that ht.: \.Vas fom1ing an ex- ploratory committee to gauge his ~han~c::. for the Presidency on the Refom1 Party ballot. Trump stated that his interest in the pn:::.Jtkn!.:y stemmed frurt1 a desire to reverse the public's \lack uf sptr~t'\ after the many years of scandal from the Clinton adminis- tr;!tlon. Trump was also 4uick to note that he VI ould only run if the committee gave him a favorable chance at winning. \'If I felt I couldn't win, I would not run,\ said Trump on Larry King Live. ''I've got a lot a lot to lose ... I'm the biggest developer in the hot- test city in the world.\ Last Thursday. Trurnp·had din- ner with Minnesota Governor Jesse Ventura, the Reform Party's senior official. Venttua has been actively pursuing Trump in an at- tempt to blunt Buchanan's poten- tial bid for the party's nomination. Despite a Times/CNN poll show- ing Trump trailing both Buchanan and Ventura respectively for the party's nomination, Trump said he was encouraged to fonna·commit- tee by polling results he called \un- believable.\ Confidently, Trump asserted that he would be able to beat Buchanan for the Reform Party nomination because Buc.hanan would receive only \five or six percent of the wacko vOtte .\ Trump also said he would make an issue ofBuchanan's latest book which states Nazi Germany \\'a!' not a threat to the United States after the 1940 Battle ofBritain. \I think it's the dumbest thing I've ever heard,\ said Trump, who has accused Buchanan of being \in love with AdolfHitler.\ Trump stated that althoug:h he would make a formal decision on the Presidency in January or Feb- ruary, he would like Oprah Winfrey to be his vice-presiden- tial runrting mate. \If she'd do it she'd be fantastic,\ he said. \She's a very exceptional woman.\ He has also said that any cam- paign would be funded primarily by him but that he would als() ac- cept the over $13 million dollars in fmancing that the Reform Party is entitled based on Ross Perot's showing in 1996. Trump, while not officially a candidate, took a few swipes at the existing political leadership by criticizing the Republicans as too far to the right and Democrats too far to the left. \We need leader\ ship in this country, and we do11't have it right now. I don't think anybody's hitting the chord- n-ot the chord that I want to hear and not the chord that other people want to hear,\ he said. While having no political expe- rience, Trump was quick to downplay that aspect and even suggested it wasn't a handicap. \I'm tired of politicians being president, because I've seen th~ lousy job they do,\ he said. He even suggested that his experience in being a longtime contributor to both parties would help hi,m , bridge gaps in the Congr~:?ss white having no Reform Party J11embe:r~. in either house. \I've been deal- ing with these people for years,\ he said. \I would be able to bring ·them together.\ Trump, a registered Repub]i- can, has described hirnself as a conservative, advocating tax cuts and opposition to gun control. But be said he was liberal on social is- sues, including support for univer- sal health care. Trump has also sa.icl he would be tough on tobacc<J ancl believes the same should apply to alcohol companies. \Wlly is it that everybody's suing tlu tobacco companies and not the alcohol companies?\ Trump asked. The emeigence of Trump and Ventura, dubbed by Newsweek as the \Wild Bunch,\may have come at the right time. Public participa- tion in the pl)]itical pr<Jcess is at an all time l<1w and voter participa- tion is at its lowest level sinc;:e the 1920s. Cable televisiQn and the Internet have fragme11ted tradi- tionalvoting groups a.ndhave less- e:q,ed politics' expos11r~ to the masses, tllus making v;ay for an apathetic ad~tpublic a.nda nation of young. people with no interest in public service, .·~~olitics has to be exciting again,;~ said Pat Buchanap, w;ho has already tn,ade a few waves with his controversial new book. However, the emersence .of a third party led by a former wres- tler with questionable views and whose main candidate is a real-es- tate tycoon who has made more than a few enemies and has glar- ing character flaws has not given the Reform Party the legitimacy it wants. The Reform Party is merely a political fad that has already reached its high water mark as is shown by its own organizational difficulties and the never-ending power struggle between the Perot and Ventura camp. In an age where the Republicans and Demo- crats have repeatedly diluted their platforms to capture the millions of middle 9f the road votes, there is no alternative; the viewpoints have become too similar. A legitimate third party must be a grass roots organization started by ordinary citizens and djsillu- sioned party members - not a bil- lionaire with an agenda. The third party must also be careful not to become a mouthpiece of the latest political ,fad. In this way and only this. way; a thir4 party - if deemed necessary - will become success- ful and offer feasible alternatives. ·_,-:', ::;): ,:. .. ·-··, ·c·.-•- ··:·-.;:·¥' •• ' . ,:.

In 1988, three trains crashed during the moming rush hour at Clapham Junction in south Lon- don, killing 35. In 1973, 10 people were killed and 94 hurt when an express train derailed at Ealing in west London. The rail system is not as \safe\ as it is believed to be, and there- fore needs reconsideration. Rail workers and passengers alike have a legitimate concern, and the British government and its rail management must address these issues, along with a host of others, if they are to remain tech- nically advanced in terms of com- muter train service. Train crashes do not happen of- ten; studies have shown that they are one of the safest ways to travel, more so than traveling by car, yet should violent incidents such as London's most recent rail accident continue this somewhat surreal fear may tum into justified real- ity.

''I've got a lot a lot to Jose ... I'm the biggest developer in the hot- test city m the worlcl.\ Last Thursday, Trump had din- ncr with Minnesota Governor Jesse Ventura, the Reform Party's semor official. Ventura has been actncly pursuing Trump in an at- tempt to blunt Buchanan's poten- tial b1d for the party's nomination. Despite a TimesiCNN poll show- ing Trump trailing both Buchanan and Ventura respectively for the party's nomination. Trump said he was encouraged to form a commit- tee by polling results he called \un- believable.\ Confidently, Trump asserted that he would be able to beat Buchanan for the Reform Party nomination because Buchanan would receive only \five or six percent of the wacko vote.\ !rump abLl said he \\ ould make an Issue ofBuc hanan·~ btest book 1\ lm:h states :\<lli Germany wa~ not a threat to the L'nitcd States a her the I 940 Uattle of Bri lain. \I thmk It·~ the dumbe~t thing l'\e eYer heard ... sa1d Tmmp. who has accused Buchanan of being \in love with Adolf Hitler.\ Tmmp stated that although he would make a formal decision on the Presidency in January or Feb- ruary, he would like Oprah Winfrey to be his vice-presiden- tial running mate. \If she'd do it, she· d be fantastic,\ he said. \She's a very exceptional woman.\ He has also said that any cam- paign would be funded primarily by him but that he would also ac- cept the over $13 mill iDn dollars in financing that the Reform Party is entitled based on Ross Perot's showing in 1996. Tmmp, while not officially a candidate, took a few swipes at the existing political leadership by criticizing the Republi<:ans as too far to the right and Democrats too far to the left. \W c nc0d leader- ship in this country, allll we don't have it right now. I don't think anybody's hitting the cllord ~not the chord that I want to hear and not the chord that otller people \Vant to hear.'\ he said. While havmg no political expe- rience. Trump was quick to downplay that asped and even suggested it wasn't a handicap. 'T m tired of politicians being president, because I've seen the lousy job they do,\ he said. He even suggested that his experience in being a longtime contributor to both parties would help him bridge gaps in the Congress while having no Reform Party members in either house. \I've been deal- ing with these people for years,\ he said. \I would be able to bring them together.\ Trump, a registered Republi- can, has described himself as a conservative, advocating tax cuts and opposition to gun control. But he said he was liberal on social is- sues, including support for univer- sal health care. Trump has also said he would be tough on tobacco and believes the same should apply to alcohol companies. \Why is it that everybody's suing the tobacco companies and not the alcohol companies?\' Trump asked. The emergence of Trump and V cntura, dubbed by Nnrsweek as the \Wild Bunch.\ may have come at the right time. Public participa- tion in the political process is at an all time low and voter participa- tion is at its lowest level since the 1920s. Cable television and the Internet have fragmented tradi- tional voting groups and have less- ened politics' exposure to the masses, thus making way for an apathetic adult public and a nation of young people with no interest in public service. \Politics has to be ex.citing again,\ said Pat Buchanan, who has already made a few waves with his controversial new b()ok. However, the emergence of a third party led by a fom1er wres- tler with questionable views and whose main candidate is a real-es- tate tycoon who has made more than a few enemies and has glar- ing character flaws has not given the Reform Party the legitimacy it wants. The Reform Party is merely a political fad that has already reached its high water mark as is shown by its own organizational difficulties and the never-ending power struggle between the Perot and Ventura camp. In an age where the Republicans and Demo- crats ha,·e repeatedly diluted their platforms to capture the millions of middle of the road votes. there 1s no alternative: the vie\vpoints have become too similar. A legitimate third party must be a grass roots organization started by ordinary citizens and disillu- sioned party members - not a bil- lionaire with an agenda. The third party must also be careful not to become a mouthpiece of the latest political fad. In this way and only this way, a third party- if deemed necessary - will become success- ful and offer feasible alternatives. Would you like to write for the World News Section?

World News Clt.ottenbtmlliis • October 14, 1999 · Page 17 Real Conservatives~ Please Stand Up by Dan Kirsch Staff Writer Since the fall of the Soviet Union, the U.S, and UK Republi- can and Conservativ~ parties, re- spectively, have had a difficult time reconciling the diffetences between a sharp division that ex- ists in both. When mast commentators refer to economic and social conserva- tives, they arenotusnally referring to the same people anymore. The release of memoirs and manifes- tos of late have exacerbated the cleavage that exists. Pat Buchanan, lo11g considered one of-if not the primary~lead­ ing social conservative in the Re- publican Party, recently released a book that outlines his program for anAmericanforeignpolicy, wbich would essentially be isolationism. More accurately, he advocates a general policy of isolationism without specifically outlining any policy of how we could ever dis- entangle ourselves from all of OUI alliances without starting a multi- front war at our shores. As most general books on for- eign affairs do, his work encom- passed-· among othe:r things-his opinion on World War H, arguing that we never should have inter- vened, as Hitler posed no threat to the US. This primarilybas led to charges of anti~Se.mitism, so much so that had he named his book In Defence of Hitler rather than A Republic, Not an Empire: Reclaiming America's Destiny, he would have received no less denigration. Those leading the charge are net those on the left, however, but his former frieods on the right: This book, coupled with Buchanan's annolLDcementthat he may join the Reform P<~.rty of Ross Perot after leaving the Republican Party~ of Ronald Reagan, has led economic conservatives in the Republican Pany to disown and publicly de- nolLDce him philosophically and .personaily as \no longer a conser- vative.\ Whether this is true pr not, the die has been cast; and economic and social conservatives could now split irreconcilably, at least for this election. In the UK, former Prime Minis- ter John Major just released his memoirs, in which h.e savages, among ()thers, Baroness Thatcher for her \'warrior-like\ ~ggressive­ ness thatis fundamentally '\:u:n-con- servative.\ In Britain, the issue dividing the ConseiVatives is like that ()ne di- viding Republicans: one <>f trade and foreign policy. The party is divided, very sharply, into two camps: the \Euroskeptics who are socially conservative and slightlymtional- istic, and the ·~Europhiles,\ the eco- nomically co11servative Europeanists, and further, those who are opposed to the common European currency and futher in- tegrati()n into the European Union, and those who affum their support for such, respectively. The Euroskeptics, wh() n.ow have majority control of the Party, are led by Party Leader Willi4rn Hague and Baroness Thatcher as an elder states woman. Hague has recently censolidated his control of the party, ousting some Enrophiles from tlle leader- ship and winning an irnJlressive majority of seats for tb.e European Parliament while campaigning al- most solely on the issue of keep- ing the British pound in currency. The Europhiles seem to be fad- ing quickly, but are still very vo- ccrl. MP Michael Heseltine, and t() a lesser extent, Mr Major, are the leading voices of Europhilic Conservatism. This movement, 1:tnlike its American counte1part oflibertar- ia.n Republicans, have been the ones calling for a split with the Tories, even to the point of run- ning on a separate list in the Euro- pean Parliamentary elections, a list which won no seats. Mr Major, in his memoirs, caUed the Conservative Party in :his waning days of leadership a \madhouse\ which contained \rebels\ whom he disdained for their vocal criticism of his Europhilic policies, saying that they had no sense of \party loy- alty.\ Neither Mr. Major or Mr. Hague have shied away from public criti- cisms of eitherbranch of the party, and this could lead to a defmitive break within what seems to be the Fenway Park of the international conservative movement: the only one in the Western World which has not seen a real split between its economic and social conserva- tives. Italy's Christian Democrats have split in two, with no rump of the old party left to return to; Austria's nationalistic party just surpassed its conservative party in last week's election; Canada's anti-multiculturalist party is now the official opposition, the old Conservative Party a shadow of itself; France's Gaullist movement is dead; Poland's Centre-right coa- lition is hanging by a thread, and even Australia now has two con- servative parties. There seems to be no end in sight to the division of economic and social conservative parties arolLDd the world, particularly in the West. Neither side is backing down, and not even the anti-Left common.enemy strategy seems to work anymore. The world could be looking at a fundamental realignment in poli- tics, and unlike Major League Baseball, the powers that be can't seem to stop it. Russian Troops Attack Chechnya by Philip Cho Staff Writer On August 7, 1999 Russian In- terior Ministry commanders agreed to launch a large-sca.le operation against Islamic fighters in the Caucasus Mouutains republic of Dagestan on Sunday. The report was not indepen- dently confirmed at that time. Rus- sian news reports said hundreds or thousands ·Of gunmen were be- lieved to be deployed in Dagestan, which borders the region of Chechnya. Fierce fighting was reported in the area, in the heart of Russia's most troubled and violent region. Civilians were streaming out ofthe area. Fighting started on August 8, 1999. Then, on August 15, the Russian military used warplanes and para- troopers to try to dislodge Islamic militants holding villages in south- ern Russia's mountainous Dagestm republic. About 60 guerrinas were killed, while Russian rocket bombs con- tinued to fall neat villages along the border. Worried aboutRussian incursions and a possible internal threat, Chechnya • s president de- clared a one-month state of emer- gency as Russian troops battled guerrillas who crossed Chechnya' s border with Dagestanto declare an independent Islamic state. On August 16, an emergency decree was called by Chechnya' s president begin11ing Monday, through September 16, in connec- tion with the conflict in Dagestan. The announcement was made on Chechen television. Citing a presi- dential decree, a government spokesman said the state of emer- gency would include a curfew, and a ban on all media, except state- owned televisi<m. OnOctol>er 1,. Russia's Defense Ministry denied reports that its troops have massed inside Chechnya, while consectitive Rus- sian bombs fell on region. The Chechen government said that 7,000 Russian combat troops, supported by hundreds of armored vehicles, .had moved inside north- em Chechnya. Although Moscow denies a military invasion of Chechnya,. Russian PrimeMinister Vladimir Putin insisted that Rus- sia still controUed Chechnya and could station troops there at any time. On October 2, Russian forces occupied a village inside Chechnya suspected ofhtrboring Chechen guerrillas, as thousands of civilians continued to flee raids by Rt1ssian warpla11es in the breakaway republic. On October 3, thollsands of Russi:an troops massed on the borders of Chechnya as civilians fled their homes in the North Ca11c11Sus re- gion amid fears a wider conflict was imminent. Russian forces set up a security zone around Chechnya, and moved up to six miles into Chechen territory. On October 4,. Russia.n forces tightened a noose aroood 1h.e sepa- ratist republic of Chechnya, with tanks and infantry moving into Checl1en territory as warplanes and artillery bombarded'suspected rebelpositions. On October 6, Russian forces seized control ofthe northern third of Chechnya as tanks and infan- try pushed deeper int() the ren- egade territory. The Russian f()rces were fighting Chechen forces around Chervyonnaya. The Russians showed no sign of mak- ing an immediate move on the Chechen capital, which has been bombed by Russian planes. As Russian forces strengthened their positions in northern Chechnya and considered striking deeper into the separatist region, Chechen refugees streamed into neighbor- ing republics, where they found hastily constructed camps. Rus- sian artillery rained shells on northwest Chechnya and bombed parts of eastern Chechnya on Wednesday. There was no immediate word on casualties. Chechen. President Aslan Maskhadov declared mar- tial law \to protect the country's sovereignty and territorial integ- rity.\ He also announced he was taking direct command of the armed forces. On October 12, Russian troops launched a new round of artillery fue in Chechnya, and may have trapped a key leader ofthe Islamic militants they are trying to uproot. Troops closed off the Chechen town of Goragorski, about 30 miles northwest of the separatist region's capital Grozny. The Russians believe Chechen warlord Shamil Basayev and his lieuten- ants were holed up in Goragorsh but the report could not be con- firmed. It seems that once again, tunnoil is ever present in the world. As things wind down in East Timor. and other countries fight off inva- sion and natural disasters, Chechnya also becomes an unwill- ing participant in an invasion. Af- terthe cold war, it seems that small countries are constantly being in- vaded by bigger countries. All they seem to be asking for is free- dom and independence .as their very own country. It is almost interesting how people have been up wttil now, un- aware of situations that are going in on Chechnya. Some people say that this has the potential of World War III. It may be a benefit to everybody if Russia gets its act together eco· nomically and politically. Unstability in government makes the world uneasy. Hopefully, things will turn out better in Chechnya.

' i ~ .'.' ·•. \ The Streak End.s as Women's Soccer Falls to William-Smith Herrings Too Strong as Dutchwomen Collapse in 3-0 Loss by Meridith Chace StajfWriter The Union College Women's Soccer Team had a disappointing weekend that crushed their hopes of a UCAA championship this year. The Dutchwomen walked past Hartwick with ease, and then lost a hard-fought battle against William Smith College, whom the Dutchwomenhad trouble with last year as well. This defeat broke Union's 21-game unbeaten streak that they have held since October oflast year. Union dominated play for the entire game at home against Hartwick last Thursday.

Union maintained possession of byD.J.Book Contributing Writer The weather is changing, the temperature is quickly dropping and the Union Hockey Team is flying towards what should be another exciting season. With their new garnet, black, white and gray uniforms the Dutchmen look to improve on last year's dismal overall record that included only three victories and two ties. Union will be showcasing a new list of young, promising talent as they take the ice on October 15 against the University of Denver in Denver, Colorado. the official start of the 1999-2000 season. Led by second year Head Coach Kevin Sneddon and assis- tants Kevin Patrick and Andrew Will, the Dutchmen have hopes of dramatic improvement from last season. On the ice, Captain Jay Varady and Assistant Captains Ryan Campbell and Bryan Yackel will be the leading this young group into the upcoming season. Campbell, last year's second leading scorer, will return for his senior year to lead the Dutchmen offense. Union's potent offense also includes sophomores Jeff Wilson and Drew Taylor who were also in the top five in scoring for the Dutchmen last season. Senior Jeff Sproat led all Union defensemen in scoring last season, and he should help the offense again this season with his multi- tude of skills. Along the blue line, the Dutch- men possess significant talent and strength. Sproat, measuring 6'2\ and weighing in at 200 lbs., Alex Todd, 6'3\ 230 lbs., Paul Kilfoy, 6'3\ 200 lbs.; and Doug Christiansen, 6' 4'' 23 5 lbs., give the Dutchmen the size and strength they need to compete at the Divi- sion I level in the Eastern Colle- giate Athletic Conference(ECAC)• Sophomore Brandon Snee will get the call between the pipes this year. He is returning from a great season that included a 3.50 goals against average, an 89.2% save percentage, and one impressive shutout against Army, 2-0. With solid defense, offense and goaltending, the Dutchmen have every reason to believe that dras- tic improvement is on the way for the upcoming season. Coach Sneddon was asked ofhis expectations for the 1999-2000sea- son, and he responded with enthu- siasm and excitement. He stated, \I believe that we are a betterteam already than we were last year. We're physically stronger and bet- ter mentally prepared.

She was clearly a sta!ldout for the team. SJ1eck felt that the seniors, Pow- ers, Harris, Ryall and Jaymee Wil- S()ll all came up big as far as their petf()rrnances and the leadership tluy displayed in this particular game. He said, ''The seniors really stepped up to the plate in this game. Abby Harris played well and had tl:le best opportunities to score.\ He continued, \It was a great game. It was a fun game to watch and a full game to coach~\ This, however, was a tough loss, atd the Dutchwomen are disap- pcJinted with the ultimate outcome. This game was played to determine first place in the UCAA. With the .c1tampionship now out of reach, Ution must concentrate on win- lliBg the rest of their games. To tliis day, the Dutchwomen have ()U1scored their opponents 47-6, amd although the William Smith game was a disappointment, the future ofthis team looks bright.

This result was remarkable in that Unio11 had been defeated only by Divisi~n I Col- leges and strong local crews that had the advantage of knowing the racecourse beforehand. In fact, Union fmished only four seconds behind Division One powerhouse Dartmouth.

On Tues- day, the Dutcbwomen played Oneonta. on home turf. Union. 's offense started offslug- gishly, a.s the score was 0-0 at the half .. However, the girls were aided by some strong goalkeeping by Captain Michelle Tardif. The sec- mid half brought a number of of- fensive opportunities, yet the team failed to capitali.:ze on any ofthem. Union got the. offensive push they needed when, with four min- utesrernaining in the game, Yvonne Turchetti put Union on the boatd, scoring <m a penalty stroke. TI'lis seemed to fire up the Dutchwomen, because only a minute later, L:in.dsay Simon put Union up 2..:0 with a goal assisted by Cory Kiefer and Susan Joyal. This 11ltimately proved to be enough for the win over Oneonta) and the :game ended in a 2-0 shut- out in favor ofUnion.

Despite the loss,. Union was still pleased with the close score, as William and Smith is cw·- rently a Division III powerhouse. Saturday brought a new chal- lenge for the Dutchwornen. They were scheduled to play their final tJCAA confe.rence game at the University ofRochester. Despite dominating the majority of the frrst half with strong play by Susie Bmderman and sweeper An- gela Dallas, the halftime score was a disappointing 0-0. Early in the second half, Union put themselves on the scoreboard with a goal from Joyal. However, this goal was eventually countered with a Rochester goal late into the second half. Forced into overtime, Union took only nine of the overtime minutes to put Roch- ester away. The goal came again from Joyal, on a quick breakaway into Rochester territory. This ended the game 2-1 in favor of Union. Goalie Jessica Wells stopped three ofthe fout shots she faced in this exciting win. With their big win over Roches- ter, Union finished third in the UCAA and currently has three regular season games remaining. They will travel to Oswego and Brockport this weekend before re- turning home .for their fmal regular season game against Hartwick on October 20 at 4:00PM.

Dutchmen Soccer Ends Five-Game Winless Streak byRa~~~l Bukowski Sports Editor Defense was. key this past week as the Union College Men's Soc- cer Temt came up big when they really needed it. The Dutchmen broke a 5-game winless streak to move into an impressive fourth place in the UCM league. With four games remaining in the sea- son, the end is quickly approach- ing and the men need to keep put- ting forth a strong effort. On October 6, the Dutchmen took oil a tough: team from Utica College. No one knew what to ex- pect from this game, as Utica's record did not reflect the fact that they had given some major Divi- sion m powelhouses trouble in games earlier this season. The game was played at Utica, and the day did not seem accom- modating for soccer, as is was pourin.g rain and the field was in a state <tf muddy disarray. Players were slipping and sliding all over the grass as each team attempted to take over the difficult task of controlling the ball. Less than ten minutes into the first half, Freshman Graham Lombardo commenced what would turn out to be a slew of Dutchman goals. Assisted by Eliot Ziebel, Lombardo slipped the ball past the Utica defense, giving Unioti a 1-0 advantage. Less than 30 seconds later, Suhail Syed con- nected with Captain Max Welsh to put in Union's second goal of the half. Utica failed to respond to the Dutchman attack, and the ftrst half ended with Union leading 2~0. the Dutchmen are known for their strong second halves, and this game proved to be no differ- ent from the rest. The Union of- fense came out with so much in- tensity it seemed as if they were trailing Z-0 i.tlstead of winning by that .score. Just 46 seconds into the half, Justin.Fantil scored off a feed from ShinY ()kota to make the score3-0 .. The game did not end here, as Union wanted to net as many as possible in this particular show- down. Dave Alperin, assisted by Lombardo pat oae past tb.e Utica netminder to give the Dutcl1men a comfortable 4-0 lead At t1tis point, Coach Jeff Guinn decided to make the game \an entire team effort\ and every player was at one time put in the game to participate. Halfway through the second half, Lombardo and Alperin con- nected again, but tlris time the roles were reversed as Lombardo scored off a pass from Alperin to give Union a commanding 5-0 lead. Utica, although they put forth a valiant effort, could not seem to capitalize on any scoring ()pportu- nities and the score remained. Netminder Peter Koch is accred- ited with the stellar shutout, as he stopped all five shots he faced. The Dutchmen outshot Utica 16-5; thi~ significant difference is due to the ilutstanding defense, which ha~ been a factot in Union's game pla;, all season. In the past five games, the Dutch defense has allowed a mere five goals to enter their net. Guinn was very pleased with the outcome of the game, stating, \W~ needed to generate some offens;e in our play ,and we finally did.\ Three days later, Union.found themselves matclled up against Geneseo, this time with home field advantage. They were still on an adr{lnaline m.sh from their big win against Utica and hoped that this game wouldend similarly. The firsthalfwasashowcase of defense, as each team held the otlter scoreless.

The score was l..c{), and Union needed to switch their game to a primarily offensive method in order to overcome the deficit. Union put forth a conunendable effort, but in the end, the score re- mained 1-0, a score which does not do the Dutchmen justice. They outshotGeneseo 9-8, and had mQre comer kicks as· well, but in th.e end the only thing that mattered is what the scoreboard displayed. Union will spend their nex.t four games at home, the next two against Clarkson and St. Lawrence, who currently stand in second and first place in the UCAA league, re- spectively. St. Lawrence has had a: 12-game unbeaten streak, and the Dutchmen hope to break this streak. Guinn is b.opeful about the rest ()f his team's season, stating, \There is still a strong possibility that this team can come out with a .500 winning percentage.\ Come out an support the Dutch- men as they battle their final games on the home field.

A home game in front of both an array enthusiastic fans and some curi- ous onlookers as weU. A beauti- ful, crisp autumn afternoon with- out a cloud in sight. An 0-3 Dutchmen team, sorely needing a victory, facing a St. Lawrence squad, the same squad that barely defeated the Dutchmen last year. The stage was set for a victory. Victory. The word was branded in the minds of the Union fifteen that afternoon- it was their only goal. Conveniently, 80 minutes of rugby was all that lay between the Dutchmen and their goaL and minutes into the match, it was obvious how the game would be played. Union used their strong pack to ruck and maul well, play- ing possession-oriented rugby. St. Lawrence, on the other hand, played a kicking game, try- ing to keep the Dutchmen bottled up deep in their own territory, hoping to exp1oit any Dutchman mistakes. And this they did early, jumping on a loose ball and send- ing it wide to a sprinting wing, who tallied the first points of the match. After the conversion, St. Lawrence opened up a·7-0 lead.

Although Union's offense struggled a.gai.nst WPI, the Engineers proved they are capable of scoring points. Thus far, they have averaged more then 43 points a game. Clearly Union's defense will have a tough job this week. The Engineer's quarterback, senior Matt Robbins is ranked seventh in the country for passing .offense.

Clinton has also recorded s o11gs and toured with such artists .as Prince - Aaron Seliger/CP George Clinton and the P-funk entertained a sparse crowd. and The Red Hot Chili Peppers. Born in 1940, Clinton began his musical career .singing as a teen- ager in Plainfield, New Jel'sey. His inspirations were musicians Jilhi Hendrix and Sly Stone. He began performing with the Parliaments in 1957 and the group became a hit in the late 60's. Since then, Clinton has performed with MC5, the Stooges, and Alice Cooper. Clinton is m()rethan a musician, he is an artist and a performer. He play[; to the crowd and tries his hardestto entertain the audience. With. his long, colored dreads and 1 brigllt outfits, Clinton creates not only the sound-of funk, but an im- age for his music as well. This image of funk is familiar to several generations and many dif- ferent people. There are die hard Clinton fans who follow the band's tours a cress the country. Several of those fans were at the concert, the ones with dread, tie-dye shirts, and dance rhythm all their own. Although the concert was on a Sunday night, many students came to get funky! Several Schenectady high-school students also at- tended, many of whom were es- corted out by security f<>r having too much \fun .. \ The concert itself was excellent, however, the sound quality inside the Field House was not spectacu- lar. Clinton's songs. including \Atomic Dog,\ \Knee Deep,\ \Mothership C<>nnection Starchild\ and \Break my Heart,\ were loud enough to hear but not always clear. Many echoes were created off the walls of the field house. An aspiring young musician, Clinton's granddaughter, sang a self-written song with Clinton mak- ing the concert a family affair. Elyse Levy, of the Concert Com- mittee, said, \It was defmitely an interesting time. The <:rowd was almost as entertaining as Clinton! One guy even bad wings!

Mr. Clinton said that the 1999 tour was going great. \It was live in here tonight, that's for sure, it was & diffe\Fent kind of group tonight ... We're doing a Parliament album, Funkedelic album at tlle same time ... we do this year round.\ When asked about his inspira- tion to create Funk as we know it, Dr. Funkenstein said it was no this dissatisfaction with traditional Motown-Parliament Funkadelic was based more Qn timing, emerg- ing between the British Invasi<m ofthe late 1960s and the rock move- ment of the later 1970s. \The music was changing at the time, Motown had just abouJ peaked and we had missed our boat on being one of them ... our niche was a mid-tempo R & B music with a rock beat which is funky music, and make that psychedelic a.nd loud ... we had to fight to keep the work funk going, even wlien people were tired ofhearing it, we ran the word funk down th-eir thr<;~at, funk, funk, funk, funk, fullk.

The project was the · brainchildofthe Society, in partim- lar David Martin and Becky Moyer. From the group's discussions in planning the event, it decided to host the talk in three separate ment and then asked for people's. reactions. The conversations were maintained for as long as the gr~up wished to continue them. Some ()f the participants sustained the.ir discourse well into the early hous ofmoming. Most of the conver- sation was extremely thoughtpr<J- voking. Greg Fox, described his and the other participants interests in \death as a healthy way to deal rooms.

Clinton followed in the path <>f one of his mentors, James Brown. Both performers had large, mul- timedia s.hows with flashy cos- tumes and loud music. His wild appearance and style is only for his own enjoyment now. Clinton said that he gravitates towards what parents dislike- to an extent, he considers himself a protest art- ist. His protest roots started 40 years ag() in Detroit with friends like Alice Cooper and Jimmy Hendrix .. Clinton has occasionally made political statements in the past when asked whom he supports for president in the upcoming elec- tion. He noted that he supports Bill Bradley; however, if Warren Beatty ran he would \support that • dude.\ Clinton was asked what he . would do if he had the job. \Oh I · wouldn't take the job, it ain't my . kind ofgig.\ Clinton has unique plans for new years.

Each of the topics was chosen for its intrinsically con- troversial nature. ,, Dinner was served, on time, at 7:30. The chefs for the evening were Colleen Reilly and Jackie Eates. Following dinner the par- ticipants in the event separated into the rooms of their ~boice.

What she expressed as ruos t frightening was the concept of l!O lon£er existing. \It is frightening to imagine a world without your- self.'~ ---------------------~---~--------------1 participants with a brief description After the groups formally dis- solved, many conversations sprung up periodically throughout the rest of the night. The thought behind discussing these vague and overwhelming topics that af- fect all of our lives is an interesting. one, which the Kappa Alpha Soci- ety hopes to further pursue. Based on the success of last week's discussions, KA hopes to conduct several more of these open-ended conversatio11s throughout the year. Access System Proposed at Union of the ideas and motivations be- bind the topic's selection. \Death\ proved to be the most inviting topic of conversation as it was the most crowded room. Ap- proximately 10 people gathered to- gether led by George, to discuss convemence. The initial bell:efit that Hayen and Sickinger note<! is with the residence halls on cam- pus. Without keys, each card is in- dividually programmed, so now when a student loses a key, ()nly their individual card will have to be changed. Furthermore, the card system will allow campus safety to rnoni- torwho is going in and out ofeach residence hall to make sure that the correct people are using the c;;or- rect cards for each building. 'The cards are also a way of tracking students down says Sickinger; in the case of an emergency, campus safety will be able to look ~t a student's last whereabouts as well as their picture in order to help of- fleers fmd them on campus. These are just two examples of the ben- efits this new card system will :pro- vide. The goal of the project, says Hayen, \is to keep it growing, this is a multi-phase project. The <:ard access system will eventually be instituted with the classroom bllild- ings. If you have ever had a lab late at night where you needed to get into a building, or if you lud a review session after the dassmoms were locked, you have noticecl.that ... continued from page 1 \Death.\ Unfortunately no one chose to discuss morality and young Calin found his way to the death room. The education discussion contin- . ued throughout the night, as the lengthiest of the talks. Three people joined Martin to discuss this issue. The moderators started their conversations with a brief state- The access card system like the one seen in this picture will be fully operational by ne:xt year. the process of fmding a security officer and opening the building can be an inconvenience. How- ever, with the new system, each students class schedule will be programmed., allowing those student's who need access to cer- tain buildings to have it, and at the same time the doors may be locked. A long-term possibility that is being boked into is the possibility of being able to use the new card access system as a debit card in local stores and restaurants Sllr- rounding the campus, throagh Dining Services. This new system can only mean positive things for the c~m­ pus; and everyone working on the · project is fully dedicat'ed to getting it up and running as quickly as possible. Look for signs in the future which will detail the topics fort he next round of discussion and to prepared to share your thoushts and to learn more about yourself and the thoughts of others. • · United Wc!Y ScllenectcdyCo~ril'r

Pag~ 4 • October 21, 199!) • QJ:.otUnrhlmsill?l De-bat~e Team Competes in Harvard Tournament by Courtney Hayden Staff Writer Spending Homecoming week- end away, the Union Debate team traveled to Massachusetts to par- ticipate in the Amer·ican Parliamen- tary Debate Association (APDA~ tournameHt at Harvard University. With over fifty college and Univer- sities in attendance, this is. one of the organiz:ation 's largest events of the year. Pairing at:the novice !eve I; Union debated teams fl:om the Uni- versity of Chicago, MIT, Wellesley, and C'olhy College. Extending be- yond the scope of American de- bate, the Harvard tournament also offered several presentations by experts on the \Worlds\ style of international debating. Issues debated ranged from the war in Kosovo and the present cri- sis in East Timor t<l genetic coun- seling and euthanasia. Differing from Policy stylem Lincoln Dou- glas debate; Parliamentary style fo- cuses on the construction of an argument in a substantially shorter time frame. While teams construct cases on issues Gf their choice before the tournament, they are unaware of the position (government or oppo- sition) they wiUbe required to take in the actual debate. Only if they are .the government will they have the opportunity to present the case they prev·imtsly constmcted. Taking the roleofthe opposition requires. a team to construct an ar- gumenJ against their adversary's proposal in a matter of minutes. Teams are unaware of the cases their <lpponents have constructed prior to the actual round. A tight or loose link resolution, which the government side must . use as the framework for their case, is presented in each round. A tight link resolution offers a concrete subject for teams to construct a · case on te.g. the death penalty). A loose link resolution consists of a broad statement that teams can tie into a case that they have prepare4 beforehand. Having the burden of proof, the govellll1lellt's position is significantly more difficult to ar- gue. Union fared well ()Verall, winning the majority of the cases it argued. Through Thursday we will be reg- istering teams for Vassar College's tournament this upcoming week- end.

Douglass Comes to Life Courte~y of £ducat ion a{ Studies Family. education, a home- these are a]! vital things often taken for granted. Living in America in the 1990's and going to a private s.chool, we may think of slavery and social in- justice as something as alien as a dead lang,uagc. We rarely stop to think about history outside of the classroom, and t:vw ifwc do, our reflections can only skim the surface of a time when b bcks and whites could rarely sit next to each other with- out causing a scandal-a time of inequality, a time of inhumanity, a time when it was a luxury for black Americans in the South to know their parents, to be able to read or write, or to have secure homes. But, amidst all the injustice came an era of impassioned orators who changed the world, who refused to keep silent. And out of their protests burst Frederick Douglass, the self-moti- vated former slave who nobody ever thought would learn to read, let alone become the leader of the abolitionist movement. We have heard his name all our lives, loosely connected him with speeches and slaves and paper dates, but we have never seen him as more than an ancient picture. But all that will change Wednes- day, October 27, at 7:30 in the Me- morial Chapel when Frederick Douglass is brought t<> life! You will meet a man born a slave more than 150 years ago in the state .of Maryland. As a slave he was listed <>nan inventory along with mules and bushels of wheat, and his owner could sell him on a whim, because, in the 1820's in America, slavery was legaL But all of this adversity did not break his spirit; and you will expe- rience that spirit. He escaped to freedom at the age of 20, and lived to become an abolitionist, woman's rights activist, author, owner-edi· tor of art antislavery 11ewspaper, Minister to Haiti and the most re- spected African-American speaker ofthe 19 1 h'-century. In his closing years he was her- alded as the \Sage of Anacostia,\ an accolade that celebrated the in- tellectual spirit and heart fire within him that never grew old. Frederick Douglass' voice speaks to us to- day, and tells us, \What is possible for me is possible for you.\ Fred Morsel!, the talented pre- senter, has been a professional ac- tor for more than 30 years, starring· in the title roles of Macbeth and Othello in regionaltheatres, and on television in such shows as Hill St. Blues, L.A. Law, Scarecrow and Mrs. King, and the CBS Bi-Centen- nial production, We, The Women, in the role of Frederick Douglass. He has also appeared on such so~p operas as General Hospital, One Life to Live, and Another World. Mr. Morsell is a lyric baritone and has sung leading roles in 21 op- eras. He is a graduate of Dickinson College and holds a Master's de- gree in Theatre Arts from Wayne State University. He has been as- sociated with the T. Schreiber Act- ing Studio in New York for more than 28 years as an actor, teacher and director. The Minerva Committee is de- lighted to welcome the campl!s corrmiunity to this unforgettable encounter with history. \There is not a nation on the earth guilty of practices more shocking and bloody, than are the people of these United States, at this very hour.\ FREDERICK* DOUGLASS SPEAKS Wednesday, October 27, 7:30 p.m. Memorial Chapel, Union College Reception to Follow in Everest Lounge *As portray eel by Fred Morsell/ QuGte from \What· to the Slave is tile Fourth of July?\ Rochester, Joly 5, 1862 · Campu~ .N~ws ' • :r . .

Started several years ago as the Alumni Leadership Roundtable, UWC is primarily concerned with fostering the role of women as lead- ers on campus and increasing awareness of women's issues at Union. Under the direction of Amanda Mason of the College Re- lations Department, the organiza- tion has solidified an agenda and is 'attempting to undertake more events on campus and at Union alumnus clubs throughout the East Coast Area. A majorbauierto UWC's initial inability to garner a strong leader- ship base among alumni lie in the lack of spare time most profes- sional women have to become in- volved in activities outside of their career. To resolve this, all mem~ bership requirements below the Ex- ecutive Board level were dropped. Current students, male and fe- male as well as alumni are eligible for membership regardless of the ''We-are ·. · rei;tlly :c • .=.· .. . .. . .. strlJJlng to preserve: the· alumni- student connection. '' amount of time .they have available to commit to UWC up-front. By dropping the membership require- ment, Mason hoped to encourage many of those who are interested in the organization's activities, but unsure of the time they will have to commit, to be able to join. This past Romecoming week- end, UWC sponsored, \A Union ofWomen: Past, Present, Future,\ a SlUlday brunch with a panel dis- cussion by current women stu- dents and alurrmus. Among the key issues discussed was the amount of social space devoted to women's organizations, such as sororities, compared with those of men. Topics such as the preva- lence of eating disorders and the availability of counseling services were covered as well. Students were encouraged to attend with their parents. UWC is also tentatively sched- uled to sponsor an event winter term in Boston, as well as in New York City spring term. Several of these activities, including a trip to the Women's Liberty basketball game in NYC will be held in col- laboration with other alumni groups throughout the area. Mason stated, \Ideally UWC would like to be able to bus stu- dents to the events offcamps.

Do not wony, Professoi Jenkins has not been fired. He was partici~ pating in a new series created by the sisters of Delta Gamma. The idea behind the series is to provide a forum for some of Union's favorite professors to give a lecture as if it was their last lec- ture ever. All professors have been invited to participate in this series, and Pro- fessor Jenkins was the first to ac- cept. There was a crowd of at least fifty eager students gathered in Old Chapel at 7:00PM. After a brief introduction by Heather Campbell, the co~rdinator for this event for Delta Gamma, Pro- fessor Jenkins began. The theme of his lecture was voice. He stressed that one should use their individual voice to express their unique ideas. There was even a suggestion that in today's soc:!ety,people can't be themselves a11ymore, and the art of genius has ileen completely lost. Professor Jcenkins began by explaining his th01ught process be- hind his last lecture. He did not see, '\why [he] should think about it? Why should it be any different from any other lec- ture [he hasJ eveil' given?\ There were many songs played to empha- size Professor Jenkins' point about voice and individ11ality. Some of these songs include \Revolution\ by John Lennon and Paul McCartney, \'Working for the Clampdown\ by Strummer and Jones, \Uns atisified\ by Westerberg and Stinson and \Get Up, Stand Up\ b~ Bob Marely. He also used :an excerpt from Paradise Lost to explain how \by small accomplisl!ments\ one can achieve great timings. .Professor Jenkins warned the students against selling out to one of the many that tries t<>buy one's voice. The geniuses of the past all .had on thing in commo:n according to Jenkins: \they didn't whore their talents.\ Concerning selling out, Jenkins' does not consider himself any ex• \You have to die before p,eople notice you-some people con~ sider this a- career move!\ ception or example.

I just hung up the pllone and didn \t kn.ow what to do,\ Greer said. The next call the girls made was to their neighbors, a group of Union men. One of the men, Jared, came to the women's apartment immediately. When the man outside their apartment saw Jared, he ran to his car and drove away, leaving his stalking companion behind. Jared confronted the woman and she gave him a shady excuse for being on the pl'emises. \She said that her ten-year-old son was either calling or instant messaging her and telling her the house he was in was being broken into. She said she was looking for a blue bouse- the women's apart- ment is tan, with spider webs on the porch - the woman's apart- ment has a pumpkin. And her boy- friend just took off and left her. If it was innocent and they were look- ing for their son, why would he have left her, and if something was happening to her son why didn't she call the police?\ Twenty minutes after the women called 911, a Schenectady police officer arrived on the scene. The stranger reached the police car first and told the officer that there had been a misunderstanding. W ithou tasking the women in the apartment if everything was okay, or attempting to verify the stranger's story in any way; the police officer left the scene. Frightened, the girls decided to sleep in the living room of their next door neighbors that night. One of the male Union studentscalled911 to lodge a complaint about the way the women were treated. The 911 •.• c(Jntinued from page 1 Security reassul'·ed the women, although it was the job of the SPD. operator hung lLJ> on him. The following day, Greer called Union security to discuss the situ- ation that had occurred the night before. An officer carne to their apartment imme-diately. Although they live off campus, the officer assur.ed them that if they had any further problems, they could call Union secwity and have an officer at theii· house within min- utes. He gave tJt.em the names of people in the pDLice departmentto call to complain about the way they were treated. \Union security was amazing. I was really impressed,\ Greer said. \We were <t;ppalled by the Schenectady police. To know that the police took what was happen- ing to us as a jCJke is frightening.\ When the women's parents called the polict department to ex- press their concerns, the officer they SiJOke to iold them that the Schenectady police had handled the situation correctly. Bill Sickinger, Director of Cam- pus Safety said, \We did call the young ladies complaint to the at- tention of the Schenectady police department. They want to handle the matter in-house, without a lot of publicity.\ He said that the girls did the right thing calling 911, \Security has no · authority to act regarding any com- plaints or issues that a student might have off-campus.\ Whe.n asked why the 911 opera- tor acted as he did, Sickinger said, \They're putting in a new com- puter system. I'm sure their dis- patchers are harried, tltat makes no excuse for rudeness,. but I think there were some mitige1ting circum- stances.\ The women are looking into put- ting a security system in their apart- ment. lax.ed lecture as more of an experi- enced individual advising youth rather than a professor feeding in- formationtostudents forpurposes of Iegurgitation on a future exam. This method seemed to refresh a majority of the audience especially because Professor Jenkins was not afraid to joke with the students, as was apparent fl'om the frequent laughter. lie suggested, \You have to die before people notice you - some people consider this a career move!\ He also provided and explami.- tion that John the Baptist, \the voice of one crying out in the wil- de-mess,\ had it easy :because he wasn't a teacher. He also ques ... tioned the ever-changing concept of alternative. What is alternative now? I turned on WRUC the other da:.y and I heard Billy Joel, I really did. I was this close to driving right intoGE.\ Professor Jenkins ended his Last Lecture on a more serious note. He encouraged the students to prac- tice telling the truth, especially in the face of those more powerful. As Professor Jenkins fmishedhis lecture a student casually wan- dered. up to the front of the r<Jol1J. and asked, \Why would I Vlant rights?\ After a brief pause, Professor Jenkins responded, \It is a won- derful ideal, what'-s wrong withide- als?'' A heated discussion of stereo- typing and individual rights en- sued for an additional thirty lllin- utes. The sisters of Delta Ga.nnna were very enthusiastic about the success of this event. Some students have asled, \How will Delta Gamma top their flrst Last Lecture?\ Well, for all of those who are curious to see ifProfessor Jerik:ins can be met, the next Last Lecture will be held on Th~sday, N ovem- ber4, at7:00 PM in,OldChapel.

Page~S ·October 21, 1999 · C!Io::ncurhlensis • Can't \Ve All Just Get Along? When students enter the gates ofUni()n College, they expect to find an institution of higher academic learning, where their mental capacity will be expanded not only inside the classroom, but outside the class- room as well. However, the expansion of our minds which should be occurring outside the classroom has recently been diminished by the close-mindedness of the faculty at Union College. In the spring of 1998, th.e U2K Committee was fonned in order to negotiate changes in the Greek systen:t because its Cllrrent status was opposed by an overwhelmin.g majority of the Union College faculty. This committee was meant to be a collaboration arnoag the students and the faculty with the common purpose of improving student life on campus in regards to the Greek system. Recently, the U2K committee met to discuss the implementation of Sophomore Rush. However, during this meeting, certain faculty mem- bers made a series of ex~rern.e statements lashing outa.gainst the Greek system, a system which has, by the admittance of the Union Col1ege student handbook, \played an important role\ in the Co liege's growth. In fact, \the oldest social fraternities in the country were founded at Uni<>n;\ leading Union to be called \The Mother of Fraternities.\ Why would anyone want to compromise this pride that gives Union such a storitJd history'? At this meeting, a certain facttlty member made a statement that fresh- men a!'e not \adult enough\ to make the decision to enter a Greek organization. However, these freshmen who are not ·~adult enough\ to choose whether or not they want to join a Greek organization are the same freshmen who are \adult enough\ to be admitted to and choose to attend this highly competitive and academically challenging institu- tion. To excel at Union, a certain degree ofmaturityisrequired. When this <iegree of maturity is not met, a person will soon find their futufe here injeopardy. F<.1culty members also expressed concern about the lifelong commit- ment associated with a Greek organization. The fact of the matter is tha.t a rraternity or sorority is a lifelong commitment only ifthe participant chooses to make it one. When a member of a Greek organization gradu- ates from Union College, he or she may continue to actively participate in their house, they may sever all ties or they may follow a path between these two options. The h.ouse to which they belong plays no part in this decision. A proposal presented by the U2K committee planned to allow Theme Houses to hold parties wh.ere akvhol would be served. However, they also expressed concern about fratemities catering to the underage dritlker·. What, then, is the difference between a Theme House having a party and a Greek House having a party? This proposal does not correct the (very apparent) problem of underage dTinking at Union. Moving the location where the alcohol is consumedwill not deter any- one who wants to drink. It is ironic that in this day and age where we are urged to be more accepting and understanding of others, misconceptions and stereo- types are still being applied to the members of the Greek System. If this type of narrow attitude was applied toward any other group or organi- zation, the person or persons who voiced such conull.ents would be bra11ded as a racist, bigot or ignoramus. However, because the Greek System is the recipient ofthe criticisms and stereotypes, comments are allowed and encouraged. Although the Greek System is not flawless, it provides many benefi- cial attributes to those who participate and those whose lives are changed for the better because of the philanthropic efforts of the mem~ hers. As previously mentioned, Greek organizations and the guidelines they follow are not perfect. Changes could be made to better t.he sys- tem, however these alterations must be executed by individuals whose decisions will not employ pre-set stereotypes and criticisms. Attacks against the system, like those exhibited at the U2K meeting, will only hit1der the progress that the committee hopes to attain. It is important for the committee to understand that members of Greek or~anizations will continue defending the position they have estab- lished in regards to the future and benefits of their <Jrganizations. Be- cause of that fact, the committee must gain an understanding of the ins.titutions they are attacking before any progress will be made so tllat they can adequately address the problems that they hope to al1eviate.

' ·,, ' '' OPIED .. . & 0rhlorLafs ·· Response to Professor Benack Dear Professor Beoack, I recently read some of your comments regarding Greek life in last week's issue of the Concordiensis. Unfortunately, I was unable to attend the U2K com- mittee meeting ancl did not 11ear all that was said. However, after read- ing a sample, I felt that I had no choice but to respond. 1 found your comments to be unwarranted and stereotypicaL I will usemy fra- ternity, Phi Delta Theta, asitis the one I know the best, to counter your statements. You stated that from an outside perspective fraternities may pro- mote an intoleranee for homosexu- ality. To me this does not appear to be the case. We have alumni that are homosexual. While their numbers are not large, I only know of two, their experience with my fra- ternity has been positive. One gentleman in particular is extremely involved in our alumni cll!b and visits the house often. ln tlle four years that I have known lrim, I have never seen him treated badly or with intolerance, nor have I ever heard him discuss any such situa- tions. The house as a whole re- spects him and enjoys his com- pany. His sexual preference is not relevant to our relationship with him. Another statement that you made was that the Greek system does not promote an intellectual envin:mment. Examining the num- bers from my fraternity should pro- vide evidence to the contrary. I belong to an organization of 17 men~ of ,that number 4 made the deans list last year. That is a little less then a quarter of the house. Our cumulative GPA as a house is 3.05 and we consistently place in the top 4- of fraternities on campus. WehaveahigherGPAthanth.e all- male average of2.89. It appears to me that we are quite successful in our academic pursu·its. These numbers make it difficult for me to question the intellectual environ- ment ofthe house. In fact, it ap- pears that Phi Delta Theta might even nurture our intellectual growth. One final area that I would like to discuss is your. statement: \I do not consider freshman adults; they are ioo fr'esh and new to Union.'' The majority of Freshmen on the campus are 18 years old. It is grounded in our legal syst€m that an 18 year old is an adult. Once you become 18 you are given the Constitutional right to vote; With this right you are able to influence and even 4lierthe laws of the land. I certaillly h>Qpe that pe().p]e who legally han the right to v.ote are able to mali;e decisions f()r them- selves~ I will no1 disagree with t!h.e fact that there :af'e problems with the Greek sy st.ern, as a whole.

COLLEGE AND INTRODUCING NEW MORE APPEALING CLASSES FOR 1HEBENEFIT OF THE STUDENTS' EDUCATION AND FUTURE As I stroll the gmomedpaths of this gated institution, it is quite a disturbing sight to see the students in front of the Campus Center, disheveled and sleep deprived, picketing and balding signs and chanting phrases such as \protect our frats\ .. needmore parties\ and \save the st1ffering sober sorority sisters\. The fraternities and sororities of Union are becoming extinct. The administration and Presid~nt Dull are stripping the distressed Greek brothers and sisters of their homes, leaving them no silelter, no clothes, no nourishment of any kind. The administration seems rather content replacing old frat houses · with new admissions offices and other offices of that sort. But the students ate being forced to sleep in dormitories with quiet hours beginning at ten o'clock. And the students' health is being affected: everyone is dehydrated and thirsty, as there are no alcoholic beverages to be consumed. Fraternity and sor<>rity attire is in a state of umest. There are no shirts with slogans such as \AEPi Toga Party\ \Psi U Blacklight Party;', and \Sig Chi Water Buffalo';. Every student is being forced to purchase their clothing at the Union College Bookstore, · where all the prodacts are manufactured in Third World · countries by S<lme eight year old girl receiving fifty cents a week for her forty hours. ·With the new ch<>ice <>f clothing, everyone is starting to dress differently. The females are leaming the meaning of nonformfitting andunrevealing clothes, such as the ever-popular black capris pants while the males are di&tinct without their khaki cargos, white hats, and collared blue t-shlrts. Without their Greek atti1e, tile homogeneity ()f Union is non-existent! Moreover, the students are becoming interested and concemed with political and social issues. The distinguished and celebrated apathy that this institution was once acknowledged for is no longer in presence. Students even find themselves questioning like Socrates, discussing Plato and existentialism in their spare time, an<i e~en going to Jackson's Garden:; to write poetry rather than \hook up\ with the person whose name they never knew. Fu.rthermore, with the lack of parti&s and alcohol, students notice themselves not only attending Campus Action and Amnesty International meetings, bu-t their classes. as well. Teachers are therefore overwhelmed with the ,su<iden and unexpected amount of _grading they have. Students are handing in papers either early or on time Without even asking for \eJttensions! Many students even realize that they want to discuss their assignments with their .,professors, thus, actually attending office hours! Many pr~fessors have had to extend their office !lours due to the overload of responsive students! The teaching profession is not the only that has been affected by the elimination of fraternities and sororities at Union College.

McGuire Copy Editor During the past week, the Sen- ate has raised some very imp().Itant issues regarding Campaign :Fi- nance Reform. Senators )()hn McCain (R-AZ. ), a presidential c~­ didate, and Rassell E. Feingold(D- WI.) have sponsored a bill tliat, if passed, would eliminate so~pilled \soft-money\ contributions. The bill's key opponent, Senator Mii.tch McCmmell (R-KY.), has the S11p- port of the Senate Republican leoad- ership, however the bill is Slip- ported by Dernoctats. Senator McConnell increased the intensity of the debate ,]>y in- sisting that Senator McCain :idcen- tify those senators that are c~nupt. .. All I'm asking is a very sintp le question .... Where is the co1TUp- tion?'' he asked. McCain bebeves that the system is corrupt,. and therefore all elected officials are victimized by the system, b~elf included. Senator Feingold p~sed the question, \Does anyone really think that those donors get 11oth- ing for their generosity?\ Se:nator Robert Bennet (R-UT) did not ap- preciate the connotation of s11ch statements. saying, \I have :\)een labeled as being on the side ofthe corrupt and! don't like it\ Supporters of the McCain- Feingoldbill have won several -vic- tories of late. First, Senator Sam Brownback(R-KS.) has decide:d to support the bill, and Senate R.tepub- lican leaders fear more Republicans will support the bill in the face ofa cloture vote.

In genera], there needs to be more promiscuous sex on campus. Every girl and every b<Jy must own at least three of the sarne shirt. An identity collector shall be hired to rip students of their individuality at the gate to ensure that students take no initiative and possess absolutely no creativity. Union College must not only remain a11 institution for proper education but also serve as a hospital as well to cater to the many alcohol poisoning cases. Students need to sleep through their eleven o'clock class and instead of consulting their professor during office hours, they must proceed to get the notes from the good looking student who sits next to them, but never actually copy them. Planned Parenthood needs to be overbooked with appointments and will have a limit on birth control. Silliman can no longer treat dehydrated students but continue to remain useful merely for their condom distribution. The fraternity houses must be returned to their rightful owners and administration offices need to be moved off campus as to not interfere with the students' parties, which must occur nightly. If the above actions are taken immediately, the Union College student body ma:y be rescued from the severe state of non- homogeneity and be restored to a state of apathy. It is therefore advantageous t~ take immediate action so that Union College can be reinstated to a campus alive with parties and sex at night while students recover with sleep during the day.

Page 10 ·October 21, 1999 · C!Loncururensis OP/ED Op:inions & tJchtorials Settle Down., Security by Oavid C. Brooks Editor-jn-Chief On Friday night, I received a ticket from campus safety. I had left a party where I was drinking some beer. My friends and l de- cided to go to another party. Know~ ing that cups are hard to come by, I decided I would keep my cup and go to the next party. Upon leaving the original party, I was told to toss the beer ()f drink it. So, I dumped out the beer and was on my way. About 4(l yards from leaving the party. a security car drove by, stopped. and out walked an officer. \ID please,\ he said. I responded by saying. \What is the problem'?'' \You have an open container.\ With the cup still in my left hand, I looked d()wn and there is possibly a drop ofbeer left in the cup, ap- parently enough to write me up.

It also makes fun of you if you go to fraternities for any reason. This means that it makes fun of every- one on campus. If you can't take a joke, the11 I guess you 'II just have to drown your sorrows at a frat this weekend. crybaby. College seems like a nice time to want to remember. I'm sure that after I get out of here, I'll look back on my classes and my professors and the campus and smile. But when I look back on college. what I hope I !'emember is that I had friends who stood by me, who sup- ported 111c during times of need. and who held me up while I vom- it!.!d back the 97 shots of tequila they made me drink in an hour. What will be important is that these friends were always willing to give me hand. because I paid them to hang out with me, and because they abused the hell out of me so I could pay them to hang out with me. What could last longer than the bond between men who com- pensate for small penises by tor- turing helpless freshman and then charging them for friendship? Fraternities, for the unfortunate few wh() don't belong to one or pass out in one every weekend, are groups of men drawn together by common interests and community \\'\in·. by\\ hich I mean drinking They have name-; made up ofthree ktkr~ of the Gn:ck alphabet, al though the true meaning of that word, \alphabet has long ~;ince been lost to most members. These are the social hubs ofcd- lege life, and they provide the m()st enjoyable weekend experience available, provided that you start the drinking hours before you go to them. It's an atmospheric expe- rience, and you have to be in the right frame of mind to getthe moQst out of them, which is the semi-con- scious frame of mind. The Last thing you would want to do is ruin the evening by being coherent enough to see that you're stand- ing in piss and alcohol trying to get as drunk as you can as fast as y()u can in a hot, smelly house filled with equally dedicated alcoholi-cs. Of course, I'm kidding. Tllose are all terrible stereotypes of fra- temities, and I want to avoid ste~ reo types here. In fact, I'd I ike to point out that most fraternities of- fer shining examples ofhow t() treat guests, and that's a quality that is too often over! ooked. l.t reaLly is a stereotype to think that a grmap of inebriated homophobes, or ali fra- ternity members, don't possess a natura I flair for cozy interior design and graceful hosting. For example, the first thing you might notice is that the fr.at is heated to about 1 73 degrees, so that you can pass out with the greatest efficiency. We're al!Yery busy, and none of us has time to simply drink until we fall doWJJ. We want loud noise, people banging us around, and oppressive heat. This is where the essence ofllav- ing a good time lies: in the inahility to rememher it. For example: Dave: This weekend I had so many memorable experiences. Harry: Your life sucks. But... Dave: I don't remember where I was from Friday morning until Monday morning. Harry: You live a life filled with purpose and joy! The best thing aboutfratemities, though, in my opinion, is the danc- ing. This is the only drawback to forgetting everything you did - you don't remember the dance party. There's just something special about a group of white kids who couldn't find a shred of rhythm if they'd been sober for days, trying to dance while smashed out of their faces- but h<Jid on, that's stereo- typical, and I want to avoid those. In all fairness, even the three mi- nority students on campus dance like white kids after they've had a few shots. It's not all dancing and having fun, though. Fraternity brothers are always ready to engage in seri- ous conversation, for instance, about sex or where they can find more beer. The point is that they will go out oftheir way to find that beer, and even further to drink it. C()mmittnent is a way of life for them. It's really a blessing for a freshman to become involved with a frat early on. because he learns some really great qualities, like com- mitment, which may help him through rehab once he drops out of college.

Take Back the Night by Lis Kidder Opinions Editor l will be twenty in December of 1999 a:ndl will be five on June 13th, 200(). I say this because my life ended and began over four years ago, on the night just bef<Jre my high sch()ol freshman yearwas fm- ished. I was raped by a person I thought J. could trust. Th()se of you who have been rapedprobably can relate with figu- rative death. You a.re no longer the person you were before you were raped - that person is gone. You are transformed into the person who was raped- the person who is afraid ofthe dark, has nightmares and flashbacks and battles depres- SIOn. Understanding the person I was before I was raped is a very diffi- culttaslc f<lr me. She is a sh~dowy figure~ transformed not oilly by time~ but by the scarring of rape. When I look back on her now, my first instinct is to be angry with her · - for being naive, for being young, for tt11sting so quickly. There were many tiilies during the past four years 1hat I hated her - I blamed her f(}I being raped and I cursed her f()r the problems I encountered after I was assaulted. But when l'm being fair with myself, I can catch a glimpse of who she was. I have lived in a very small town south of Boston for my entire life. I am the oldest child of three, with a young;erbrother and sister_ Grow- ing up, I was always <ln the young;eL· side of my peers .. When they were interested in boys, I was still interested in horses and make- believe games. By the time ninth grade rolled around, I had only a vague interest in the opposite sex and spent most ofmy time with my best friend, doing art p.rojects and continuing to live in the world of a kid. At tlle end of ninth grade, I de- veloped a crush on a junior, who was a popular football player. Af- ter awhile, we begarHalkingon the phone - stupid stuff. I can't even remember now what was said, but he would chat with me and l was flattered. One night, around midnight, he askedifl would like to go for a walk with him (he lived only three streets down)~ I was thrilled that he wanted to do something with me, so I climbed out of my window (it was past my curfew and my parents wouldn't have let me leave, so I had t() sneak out) and walked to 1he end of rny street, where he met me. He suggested that we walk to t!Je elementary school's play- ground and \'talk\ Off we went. The playground was specially designed to look like a ship. It had two large sections for the boat, both with two floors, slides, ropes, etc. We climbed to the second floor of one ofthe sections and sat down by the orange tube slide to talk. I don't remember what was said. After awhile, he leanedover and began kissing me. I accepted this, but when h.e began to shift his weight on top of me, I pulled away and tried to start up the conversa- tion again. He started kissing me again and this time pushed me onto my back. I began telling him that I wanted to stop - and it was from there ·that things began spin- ning horribly out of control. He didn't stop and although I said \no\ many times and tried to fight him, he raped me. I don't re- member how he got my shorts off, and sometimes I still am angry at myself for not being strong enough to fight him off, but he won. After it was over, he threw my clothes at me and told me to get dressed. He had ejaculated on my stomach and I can still remember what he said, \That stuff sticks to everything. Use your slwrts to dean yourself off.\ He told me to stop crying sev- eral times. Then he said that he wanted to '\hold me,\ and lle didn't let me go until he had \held me\ for what seemed like an eternity. Then he said that he needed to go home and he left. He told people that we had en- gaged in consensual sex. And so did I. I made up an alternate reality for myself, in which I bad some control and I made myse1fbelieve that it was consensual. I dm 't think the word \rape\ was in my vocabu- lary at the time. It certainly didn't occur to me that a crime had been committed when I was walking home, or when I was taking a shower, or the next day when I stayed home from school and laid in bed crying. I was so ashamed and felt like I had done something bad - and I was afraid to tell my parents because I had been doing something wrong at the time - sneaking out. So I told no one. I kept it a secret and didn't say a word about it for three years. This is the meaning ofTake Back the Night. Women march because they have their own untold stories, because they will never f<lrget and because they hope that one day someone will listen. It was1t 't your fault. ltdoesn 't matter what you did or said or wore. I twas not you who acted inappropriately. We know how hard it can be to realize that, but always remember how important you are. Yo11 are not alone. Tltere are people who are willing to help. It's okay to feel depressed, scared and angry.

MATIY <l'S F<JlV~\' F<llV~Y ~OVft. by Matty G Saif!Writer This past Friday night, I was like many Ullion College students, and I got off campus. I journeyed to Crossgatoes Mall again. The main reason [ went there was to see a movie a!ld grab some decent foO<d. Anotl1er reason I was in the mall was for the UL TRAZONE: UL TI- MA TE LASER ADVENTURE. On F;riday, I also wasted away my afternoon Leading up to our adven- ture ouil io Crossgates by watciJ.- ing mowi•es all afternoon. So, the\ point of this article is to talk abotut three good flicks that I saw this fJast Friday. First, start- ing at ttoon, and finishing up later, I saw Thr~.' Usual Suspects. Later in the a!ft~rnoon, I watched an old favorite of mine, Army of Dark- ness. Fi11ally, at Crossgates, the people J, \\Was with and I made the decision 1o watch Fight Club over seeing American Beauty. The Ul·ual Su:-.pects start off with five thieves being brought in to a police I imeup. Most of the story occurs in a police headquarters with a to11gh Customs ,pfficial in- terrogating a cripple who had just turned states evidence concemiag an inciclemt on a ship in the harhar the prev.ious evening. The cripple tells tbe :story of the events that transpired from the police lineap leading u:p to the night in the har- bor. These hoods pull a few jO'bs on the east and West Coast and then run into Keyser Soze. Who is that you ask'!' He is described as a Turkish n1obster that criminals fear beca\lse he is the most dangermu ORitlVltP W02t9 man in the world. As the story goes, some rival mobsters in Tur- key wanted Soze out ofthe busi- ness, so they go to his h()use, and rough up his family. Soze comes home and, to prove a point, he kills his family, saying they shouldn't have to live after such an experi- ence. Then he goes and kills all Mantis. He is a director who seems to have a good idea about how to present a movie as a fun event. Having seen For Love of the Game, recently and some ofltis other mov- ies, I am a fan of his work. While in the past I've never really under- stood how important a director is to the movie industry, with his mov- the people responsible, their fami-- ies I have noticed some similarities lies, people who owed them in all ofthem that! do enjoy.

This is a movie !!bout some olcl children (Brad Pitt and Eel Norton) who decide to start fight- ing to discover more about them- selves. The fightimg goes on, ancl while it doesn't contribute much to the movie, it is always fun t() watch men bludgeon each other. The movie runs a total of 139 min~ utes, and I for ·one did not notice the length of the movie. It is usual for me to start fidgeti11g about fif;. teen minutes into a movie, and af~ ter about an hour I frequently be- come quite restless, but through- out this movie I sat patiently, fol\ lowing along with the action. After I returned home on Friday nizht, I went down the hall to talk to a friend of mine who is a bit of a movie Gl.rr:u. Mr. Dave had seen tl.'Epten:ErofFight Club, so I fig- ured that I would go talk to him about it. He felt that the movie ran a little long, had a bit much of the fighting, l:!lld also jt.Jmped from the idea of a Fight Club to the next es- calation level. After thinking about these grievances, I can say that they are all legitimate and probably should have been cor- rected before the movie was re- leased. Even with these problems, Fight Club opened tllis weekend in the number one spot~ making $11 Million. In the end, Fight Club is a good movie, with a twist at the end tltat makes it more than worth the almost three hours it takes to watch it (there were five commercials and five previews be- fore the movie actually b€gan). There is a whole lot of excessive violence, as the movie revolves around a group of guys who like to beat each other up, and my fi- nal rating fc;>r this movie would be another eight. To end this week, I would like to thank my endless soarce of movie enjoyment, Mr. Dave, as he lends me movies almost on a daily basis for me to view in my 'ghetto system.' The Art of Finding the Right Man by Jonill Mayer Contl·ibuting Writer When I first got to college, I was terrifi-ed of meeting boys. Petri- fied. After aU, I was always told that gjrls are most likely to meet their fullllrre spouses at college. So I figured !that any one of the many boys, I'm sorry, \men\ I met here, rnight very well be the person I would be stuck with for the rest of my life. That scares the piss oat of me. Yom kao w what else scares me'? Barbie. Do tbey frighten anyone else as well'? OK, let's face it. Originally, women who went to college did so to meet good husbands. No, that is not a written fact. But it should be, a11d it is still the case today. Girls look for smart engineer-type men wh{) will provide for them. It's an unavoidable mindset that occurs in nature. Deny it all you want,. but social stability and fman- cial security are turn-ons. But how far are young women meant to go? Not surprisingly, I am setting myself np for a beating. So right off the bat I have to say tllat 1 have nothing against sororities. Personally, I spent tluee years in boarding school living in single- sex dormitories and I would never want to completely surrolllld my- self with only girls again. But that's just me. Plus, hazing actually amuses me. Justthe other night, I let two of my girlfriends dress_ me up in a little child's GJ. Joe Halloween costume and then take me on a \double-secret-adventure.\ So for all of you wonderfilg who that girl at Psi U dressed as G .I. Joe was, now you know. Anyway, my only prob- lem, if you want to call it that, is the whole notion of the \brothel.\ Which, happily, I can say is not at all prevalent here. I'm referring to showing off the merchandise; having parties so popular fraternity guys who show promise in the social world can come and chose their favorite pick of the night. That, in my opinion, is wretch- edly awful. Girls might as well line up and stand patiently, waiting to be selected. that whole ideology makes me sick. Recently, a friend of mine men- tioned a party th<1t involved going with all of her sisters to another school for a fraternity they are pre- dominantly unfamiliar with. OK, I'll admit it, I flipped. Are you kidding me? Now we're getting shipped off to other colleges to be sel'<'lcted by guys, or worse yet to select guys? I told her that if s'h.e came back with a boyfriend, I'd kill her. She swore she wouldct' t be going to get a boyfriend although it .. might be nice\ if she did. I gave the poor girl a long lec- ture on the likelihood of finding her life-long mate at a random fraternity house 20 minutes away. She told me she regretted tell- ing me anything about the party: I don't blame her. I lay off her fCJr a while and transferred my anger onto one of her unsuspecting sisters, who shaH, of course, :remain name- less. (I'll give yoaa hint though. She ruthlessly used my name in print the other week and is so very lucky I still love her.) I told her my thoughts on the matter and she innnediately took the opposite point of view. She does that at times, as some of you may know .. She claimed it \wasn't anything. like that.\ I tried explaining that I knew that was not the discussed goal of the evening. . Yet, on the other handj if the shoe fits .. .She adamantly replied \hut it's a casual party. We're sup- posed to just wear party clothes.\ Party clothes?! What a shock! I took one pointed look directly at her and watched as the wheels started spinning. After a very short pause, she fm- ished the conversation with a be- wildered, defeated, half- whis- pered, \Oh.\ My point, exactly. ] ali thi ch thi 1m an co: an se1 po tlu ity tin as on] to 1 n~a go: Ill~ tal< tha an< ev< litt fee tha put lo(] lau ho1 vit abl I Hi! mil abl tha dri etc. rea all) life pla poi } to ! to i as 1 Sm SOil ' p()i lea1 to t onl thiJ agJ ulti

Drive-In Movie On Campus by Fahim No or Staff Writer I received a voicemaillast Friday that said that they were going to be showing a drive-in movie, PCU, · at 8:00PM in. the parking lot be- hind the field house. Since I had never been to a drive-in before, I wanted to see what it was like and de.cided to go. We got there at about 7:45PM in order to find a parking space that would allow us to have a decent viewofthemovie. We looked fora screen throughout the parking lot, . . but could not flnd one. I saw a grou,p of students in one of the . parking spaces and thought that they might be the people in charge of the movie. I approached Paul Stewart- Stand, who is Vice-President ()f Campus Life. He told me that the movie was being run by the Social Committee and Program Assis- tants and was a promotion for the George Clinton & Parliament Funkadelic concert. He also .in- formed me that the movie was go- ing to be shown a little· later than expected because Big Wave Inter- national, the company in charge of btihgiug the screen, was going to be a little late. So we parked the car in front of where he told me the screen would be placed ·and waited. At about 8:05PM abig white truck came with \Big Wave International\ wxitten on it. The students rushed to the the screen. I guess one good .thing about the delay was that I gut to see how they set up the screen_ As the S{;reen was being as- sembled,more cars arrived md two students even brought a. c<;>uch with a broken leg. At 8:4-0 PM, a blurry black and white visi()ncarne on the screen followed b:y a blue screen. 1 saw that Paul was trying to put a very small sign U]J on the screen. Wh.en he brought it closer, it said that people should tune to WRUC to hear the sound. Also. one ofthe students gave us some chips and cheese doodles. Finally, the movie started an hourlate. I didn't understand how the movie was a promotio11 for the concert until I saw George Clinton come out ()f the bus. I guess it was a clever attempt to get people tQ come to Sunday night's concert, in addition to a flyer on almost EVERYdoor on campus. I thought it was a very funny movie.l especially liked tlle s~ene where a hundred pounds of meat were thrown on students. You should rent the video wllen you get the cbahce if you rniss~d it~ but you won't get ·another cpportu- nity to see it in a drive-in. Unfortunately, you ha'V.e prob- ablymissed your last chanceto.see a drive-in movie this century.

Photo by Linda Mooney Photography Rakuvase Comedy Fights Union College Boredom by Kristina Dome Staff Writer It is a known fact thatthe major- ity of Union College students are overworked and sleep-deprived. We are told that there is so much more free time in college, but I would beg to differ. There may be more free time, but we have a lot more work to do now than we did in high school. Some people would say that in high school we did not party as hard as we do in college. This is true, but part of the reason we party hard is because we work so hard. The reason that I am writ- ing this article is to recommend another thing Union students can do when they are not studying. Most people do not get the chance to watch much TV while they are here at school. In fact, I have had more than one person complain that they feel isolated up here in Schenectady. U11ion is re- ally a world unto itself. But ·we do stilll!.ave movies. Th:nk God for that. Without old favorites 1 think 1 would really go crazy-. Foolishly I did not bring an.y movies to.school. My roommate does have a pretty extensive coltection so we can watch TV in style. Watching a movie in the middle of the day or at nigltt is a really wonderful way tore- lieve stress. It is a way to forget about those annoy- ing things tlut we call classes. You canjust kick back and relax.. Watching the movie alo11e can be nice. It is usually n1t1ch nicer to watch with a few frie11ds. The movie becomes more enjoyable whe11 it is b~ing watched with some friei)ds. Another nice thing about watching movies in college is that they can put you into another W()rld for a few hours. Any movie can takeyourrriindoff of schoolwork for a few horus, but there are some movies that do a better job of relieving stress. One movie that does an excellent job at this is My Best Friend's Wedaing. This movie has to be one of my all- time favorites. It has four things going for it: Julia Roberts, Rupert Everett, CameronDiaz, and the fact that it is hilarious. Not many other movies can make a person laugh so hard in such a short arnollllt of time. For those of you that don't know; My Best Friend's Wedding is the story of a bv-e-shy food critic named Julianne ?otter (Roberts).

She has not talked to Michael in a few months. They had made a pact that if neither of them was attached by their twenty-eighth birthdays that they would get married. On the night of her birthday ·she gets a call from Michael telling her that he is getting marri:ed that weekend and that he wants her to be his maid ofhonor. Needless to say, Julianne is surprised and dismayed. She is even more upset when she meets Kimmy (Dia2:), Michael's gorgeous fian- cee. K.imrnyis the embodiment of the girl that everyone loves to hate in high scb.ool. She is blond, beau- tiful; smart, and wealthy. What makes matters even worse is that she is a really nice person. Julianne hates her at first sight. She quickly begins to devise plans to tear the two lovebirds apart. Her editor and new best friend George (Everett) becomes her partner. Al- though he is gay, he poses as h.er fiance. They do manage to make Michael jealous. Julianne tries every1hing to break up the wedding. Nothing that she tries works. It is hysterical to watch the lengths that she goes to in or- der to get what she thinks she wants. I will not spofl the surprise for the crazy people who have not seen this movie yet. All I will say is that the scene in which George ser- enades the restaurant they are din- ing at is a riot. Everett is without a doubt the funniest person in this movie. He steals every sceae that he is in. Diaz is fabulous. Roberts is her usual brilliant self as a woman with whom we sympathize. All in all My Best Friend's Wedding is a terrific movie that will make you laugh and forget all about your classes. Top Te.vv Mov~ 1. VouJ:iLe, J eopar~ 2. Ra.n.d.om; He.ctrl¥ 3. 71t.re,e, K~ lf.

' 1 \l ' ~-~,;r.:,-l,;.f)l ~age 16 · October 21, 1999 · United Nations Debt Long Overdue by Philip Cho Staff Writf!r The United States currently owes the United Nations $1.6 bil- lion. The total arrears that each member states owe totals to $2.6 billion. Ifthe portion of the United States debt is not paid before the year runs out, it faces the penalty of losing its seat in the General Assembly. Under Article 19 of the UN Charter, the amount the United States will have to pay by the end of 1999 to retain its voting privi- leges will be calculated in Novem- ber. Madeline Albright, our For- eign Affairs Adviser, said, \The United States outstanding debt has made it difficulty to recruit allies for the kind of structural reforms that Congress demands as a con- dition of paying back dues and other assessments.\ Many mem- bers of Congress want the United States to pay off its debt. The President wants to do so as well. Representatives such as Tony Hall ( D-OH), and Christo- pher Shays (R-CT)have tried to get Congress to pay off it's debt to the United Nations by trying to pass a bill that would require\it to do so. However, this bill has been faced with strong opposition fr()m the Republican Party. Subsequently, the bill failed. Shays,however, stated that they would do what it takes to get a UN Debt Bill to get through Congress. The reasen behind opposition to paying the debt surrounds a differ- ent debate that has been going on in Congress for a long time. The United Nations released a state- ment with respect to abortion, which he~ppens to be pro-choice. Many conservative Republicans who are pro-life have decided not to pay off the United Nations Debt because of this issue. ·tributions to all for.rnal United N a- tions peacekeeping operations.

The United Nations has been try- ing to help facilitate it so .that the United States could pay off its debt. The United States has been doing nothing. Congress has not permitted .the United States to pa:y off its debt. If the United States loses its seat in the General Assem- bly, it will severely hurt its chance to properly have an influence in the world. Also, with the United States not being in the Generai Assembly of the United Nations, it will severely hurt the power of the United Nations. I doubt the United Nations will be able to function properly without United States' backing and funding. Es- sentially, by not paying the debt, the United States is returning to isolationism. A hope that indeed some Republicans may have. Tile United Nations is a global organization that assists refugees; sets up programs to clear land mi.nes, helps improve the qual it:y of life, make loans to developing countries, and helps stabilize fi- nancial markets. It also helps t() solve problems,. which challenge humanity. The United Nations leads the international campaigns against illicit drug trafficking and terrorism. The United Nations also protects the human rights of vari- ous citizens in the member coun- tries. The United Nations is the only international organization that allows countries and delegates to disc11ss matters such as promot- ing peace, negotia,ting trade and tariffs, global environmental is- sues, alld helps countries in dire need to stimulate the economy. Without United States support, tile United Nations may fail. As situations are erupting in places like East Timor and Chechnya, the United States can- not afford to lose its seat in the United Nations. With countries planning to remove its tariffs againstii:aq, the United States must voice its ()pposition. The United States has been in the forefront of making sure that fhe security of the world was safe. Without the United States' presence in the Gen- eral Assembly. the United States can statld to lose a lot of power- something that is not in the inter- est of the United States. As the most diverse country in the world, it is up to the United States .t() set a good example to other countries, and to pave the way towards a more secure world. I hope that Congress realizes the importance of paying the United Nations Debt, and acts according.

Buchanan: Now the Reform Candidate by David Gruner Staff Writer A seemingly ardent Republican, Patrick Buchanan, has answered every question posed by switching to the Reform Party, whereby he will seek its presidential nomina- tion. Authorities have learned that his departure will formally take place on October 25 in Falls Church, Virginia, a wealthy Wash- ington suburb. The surprise doesn't I ie in the fact that there was spectilati()n over his departure, the ''real\ surprise is that is took him so long. Along- side him not receiving m()re than five percent in any Republican presidential candidate national poll, is that Mr. Buchanan~s ideo- logical misconceptiom have gave guided him far from the Republi- can Party and conservative move- ment. Yes, he was a small force in the GOP prior to the upcoming 2000 election, challenging front-runners Bob Dole in 1996 and then-Presi- dent George Bush in 1992. He even won some key races in 1996, including a New Hampshire pri- mary victory, but that was four years ago. and in politics time is everything. The Conservative movement has changed drastically over the past four years and Mr. Buchanan has not bee able to re- main loyal. In some respects. it is prudent t() say that he was never able to remain truly loyal to the Republican faction. Patrie k Buchanan's politics are a new phenomenon unlike any- thing Conservatives hold sacred. He has not attracted wide support because of this, as Republicans dismiss llim for his un-American ideals and Democrats dismiss him for his absurd and radical policies. There is little chance for any candidate, from Buchanan to the i11famous and appalling Gov. Ventura. to enter the White House as a non-majority party candidate. What the Reform Party will do for Mr. Buchanan will simply demon- s1rate further the impossibility of his politics in modern America. Mr. Buchanan has time and a,gain argued that the Republican Party has lost ground, and lost vi- sion in its course of action. While at times the party is a house with many mansions, it is certainly not as bigoted and close-minded as the Mr. Buchanan's supposed \new [)arty.\ For over four decades, conservaiives have agreed on a basic program: .. an anti-totalitar- ian foreign policy, at ()nee nation- alist and internationalist; free mar- kets and limited government at home; and moral traditionalism.\ Buchanan. on the other hand, as National Review ed1tor-at-large William F. Buckley, Jr. said\ ... n() longer reliable even on moTa! issues ... blames capitalism ... and he is willing to risk a permanently pro-abortion Supreme Court on a lark.\ Arizona Senator John McCain, als() a Republican presidential can- didate, furthered Mr. Buckley's remarks by pronouncing Mr. Buchanan to be an obstacle in the Re!)ublican Party and the and dis- closing sooner he leaves the bet- ter for not only Republicans, but the country.Accusations .are evi- dent in his latest book, entitled, A Republic, Not an Empire: Re- claiming America's Destiny, where Mr. Buchanan questions America's international economic policy and its dealings with Adolf Hitler. He disputes such a relation- ship, stating that America should have let Hitler be, for he was no threat to the \American culture.\ Such etude and outlandish remarks have sparked speculations of anti- Semitism and over the top politics, so to speak. In all, Mr. Buchanan will seek the weak Reform Party yet will not win the2000 presidential election. In the meantime, conservatives must note that letting Buchanan continue to describe himself as a conservative would be not just ir- ritating but destructive. By taking action against him, .conserv~tives will regain momen- tum and better promote a Repub- lican White House in 2000; Too much dishonor and treachery have occurred in the past eight years, and it W()uld be a shame to allow for similar action to take place for another four.

World News a:r:111tt.crrhleu11is • October 21, 1999 ·Page 17 Contrasting Views on Forms of Government The Merits, Faults and Consequences of our Current Political System by MicbaelK McGuire Copy Editor Tl1e United States government is based onasystem of Federalism. Wehaveasepa- ration of powers that allows each of the three branches ofgovernment (legislative, execu- tive and judicial) to act both independently and in coordination with the other two. In addition, each branch has methods .ofcheck- ing the other branches, be it a presidential veto, a congressional veto override, the overturning of a law by tlle Supreme Cotut, ora constitutional amendment. In this way, the branches of government may become specialized, but no branch is capable of dominating the other two. James Madison defended this sy~tem, declaring that it would prevent the existence of factions within the government. The separation of powers al- lows for the United States to have the most democratic form of government in the West- ern world. The Parliamentary system is based upon fused powers. Rather than a system .of three equally important branches of government. as we have in the United States, there is in- stead a vertical alignme.Jlt of power~ with the Prime Minister and Cabinet at the t()p,. followed by Executive agencies and thenthe Parliament. In our Federalist system, Con- gress controls the Executive agencies through funding and oversight, however they have authority to make decisions on their own. The American government is morederno- cratic in the election of its chief executive. Americans vote for the president in a gen- eral election, the only official in the gov- ernment chosen by a popular majority of all Americans. While it is true that the presi- dent is officially chosen by the electoral college, that step is now merely a formal- ity, and it is largely unlikely that the winner of the majority will not win the electoral vote in the two-party system. To bec()me the presidential nominee for a party, tile candidate must win it through primary elec- tions or caucuses in each state, where mem- bers of the same party as the candidate vote for the individual that they feel would !:>est represent their interests ill the presidential election. The president is the head of the execu- tive branch of government, and as such COil· trois foreign policy, Cabinet and Supreme Court appointments (with the approval of the Senate), and the execution of the laws. With all of this responsibility. it stands t() reason that President of the United States be elected by popular majority. In a parliamentary system, members .()f parliament choose the Prime Minister_ The populace votes only for the party they wish to represent them in parliament. The par· ties decide who the candidates will be, not . the people, and the party that wins the rna- . jority in parliament elects its leader Prime Minister. This process takes the selection · of th.e head of state out of the hands of the people. Another major difference between the parlirunentary system and the Federalist sys- · tem is party loyalty. In a parliamentary sys- tem, each Member of Parliament is expected to vote with the other members of his party. • In this way, the minority party will never be heard in government. An MP cannot choose to defy his }>arty, because if he should, then the pat'ty win notsupport him • in the next election. The people will not be able to vote for him or her; they can only · vote for whomever the party nominates. In the Federalist system, Madison be- lieved that senators and repFesentatives · should always vote for the common good, . after intelligent debate. While this environ- : ment could never exist in a parliamentary · system where there is strictparty loyalty, in the American system congressmen may vote their conscience. They may take into ac- . count their own views, those of their con- stituents and those of their party, and in the . end if the decision they come to is not that of the party leadership, they still may stand by it. This is because in American, anyone may run forO:mgress, and they are neither chosen nor wholly supported by their party. Members of Congress need only bear in mind how their actions will influence vot- ers in the next election, at least in theory. It is apparent that the American Federal~ ist model for government is the most demo- cratic. This stems from the history of a na- tion that rose up against a dominating Brit- ish monarch. When America ~rned its in- dependence, the founding fathers strove to perfect a government .in which no one per- son or branch of government could have absolute authority. Instead, we have a t>YS- . tern of representative go-vernment where the people directly choose the members of two of. the branches, and indirectly choose the members of the third through the actions of the other two. In contrast, governments such as Britain and France have a long history of power concentrated in a single monarch who had absoll!te authority. In the natural progres- sion of giving more power to the people, their governments developed i11to a repre- sentative government, however the author- ity is still centralized. The American system of government bet- ter representsits citizens than theparliamen- tmyform. The American people would never accept a government that so greatly centralizes power and limits the freedom of its repre- sentatives to act of their own will. To do so would be a reversal of two hundred and twenty three years ofdemocr:acy. tf~tiJ;t:u,···· ..•... c~olle,I¢·-·.;;R~p~blicalls···· ,.: .:,;.oeti~atMeetittg ·. · · ·. · .

Dual Federalism has worked fairly well for the past 200 years, however, I propose a change. Nearly every other western, industrialized country uses a parliamentary form of government. There are many advantages to such a managerial system: legislation cannot be withheld by a select few, outdated systemic elections will not be necessary, and the country will be able to move forward more qui-ckly. The United States should join the rest of the world in this cleaner, more effi- perately needed. If a parliamentary system had been in .existence, the rights for mi- norities and other social justice issues would have been established and resolved decades in advance. When there is an important issue, the pub- lic wants action. The enormous factorthat did not exist in Madison's time was the om- nipotent media. Today, coverage of poiiti- cal events can be as intrusive as the public wants. There are 24-hour media shows de- voted only ·to political analysis and cover- age- the Internet has been the final achieve- ment in ultimate modern communication. Madison lived in a time where media was a regional paper at best. This factor should provide enough leverage to undermine his fear of an uneducated public.

Our current system was established out ()f fear. The founding fathers did not want ·. to create a situation where a tyrant could control the country as King George III had for many years. A system of unique checks and balances was created to allow sections of the government to have select powers with certain restrictions. James Madison, in the Federalist Papers, · cited the need for such checks and balances was to create an environment where fac- tions, or political groups with certain agen- das, could not survive. Madison created this system because he did not believe the general public was educated enough to lit- erally choose policy and have immediate power; the system was designed to move slowly. A parliamentary form of government is designed, by definition, to move more q11ickly. Once a party has secured power it can pass almost any legislation it proposes. rust think of the years that civil rights legis- lation was tied up in Congress, pushed back . in some committee, tabled until the follow- illg meeting. Strom Thurmund was single- handedly able to table legislation for days simply because he believed in segregation. The Democratic Party had to win 68 seats ill the Senate in 1968 to finally be able to J>ush through the legislation that was so des- take over the country is ludicrous. Again, with finite media coverage, every aspect of a professional politician's history is exam- ined. The Bill of Rights would still be in effect; the new government collld not im- pede upon an individual's rights. The gov- ernment would simply be able to push through much more legislation that should be pushed through. Too often, bills that deals with pork-bar- reling projects are passed for insider's po- litical favors while important legislation ca11not be passed. For example, the need for national healthcare would probably have been enacted in the early 1990's when tile Democrats held Congress. Later this decade, the righteous anti-tobacco bill would have passed- it had some bipartisan support, but the industry was able to taint the bill as another \big government\ project, successfully halting the assault. Yet, because ()four forefathers' fears, we are not able to progress in the way Europe and much of the rest of the world has. There is some merit t() having a slower political machine.

World News C!tmu:ar.ltieltsis · October 2L 1999 ·Page 17 Contrasting Views on Forms of Government The Merits, Faults and Consequences of our Current Politicaf SJ'Siem by MichaelS. McCuire Copy Editor The Unit~d States government is based on a syst~In of Federalism. We have a sepa- ration of fll>lvers that allows each of the three branches of government (legislative. execu- tive and judicial) to act both independently and in coordination with the other two. In addition, each branch has methods of check- ing the other branches. be it a presidential veto. a congressional veto override, the overturning of a law by the Supreme Court. or a constitutional amendment. In this way, the branches of government may become specialized, but no branch is capable of dominating: the other two. James Madison defended this system, declaring that it would prevent th~ existence of factions within the government. The separation of powers al- lows fm the United States to have the most democratic form of government in the West- ern world. The Parli arnentary system is based upon fus~d pow~rs. Rather than a system of three equally important branches of government, as we hal'l: in th~ United States, then~ is in- :-,t~ad a vertical alignment of power. with the Prime Minister and Cahinet at the top, followed hy Executive agenci~s and then the Pari iamen t. In our Federalist system, Con- gre~s controls the Executive agencies through funding and oversight, however they have authority to make decisions on their own. The American government is more demo- cratic in the election of it~ chief executive. Americans vote for the president in a gcn- erul election. the only official in the gov- ernment chosen by a popular majority of all Americans. While it is true that the presi- dent is officially chosen hy the electoral college, that step is now merely a formal- ity. and it is largely unlikely that the winner of the majority will not win the electoral vote in the two-party system. To become the presidential nominee for a party. the candidate must win it through primary elec- tions or caucuses in each state. where mem- hcrs of the same party as the candidate vote for the individual that they feel would best represent their interests in the presidential election. The president is the head of the execu- tive branch of government. and as such con- trols foreign policy, Cabinet and Supreme Court appointments (with the approval of the Senate), and the execution of the laws. With all ofthis responsibility. it stands to reason thai President of the United States he elected by popular majority. In a parliamentary system, members of parliament choose the Prime Minister. The populace votes only for the party they wish to represent them in parliament. The par- tics decide who the candiuatcs will h~o.>, not the people, and the party that wins the ma- jority in parl.iament elects It~ leader Prime Minister. This process take~ the seh:ction of the head of state out of the hands of the people. Another major differe11cc between the parliamentary system and the Fedcrulisby:,- tem is party loyalty. In a parliamentary sys- tem. each Member of Pari iarnent is expected to vote with the other mernhers of his rarty. In this way. the minority party will n~ver he heard in government. An MP cannot choose to defy his party. hecause if he should. then the party will not support him in the next election. The people will not he able to vote for him or her: they can only vote for whomever the party nominates. In the Federalist system, Madison be- lieved that senators and representatives should always vote for the common good, after intelligent de hate. While this enviwn- rnent could never exist in a parliamentary system where there is strict party loyalty, in the American system congressmen may vote their conscience. They may take into ac- count their own views. those of their con- stituents and those of their party. and in the end if the decision they come to is not that of the party leadership. they still may stand by It. This is because in American, anyone may run for Congress. and they arc neither chosen nor wholly supported by their party. Members of Congress need only hear in mind how their actions will influence vot- ers in the next election. at least in theory. It is apparent that the American Federal- ist model for government is the most demo- cratic. This sterns from the history of ana- tion that rose up against a dominating Brit- ish monarch. When America earned its in- dependence, the founding fathers strove to perfect a government in which no one per- son or branch of government could have absolute authority. Instead. we have a sys- tem of representative government where the people directly choose the members of two of the branches, and indirectly choose th~ members of the third through the actions of the other two. In contrast, governments such as Britain and France have a long history of power concentrated in a single monarch who had absolute authority. In the natural progres- sion of giving more power to the people, their governments developed into a repre- sentative government, however the author- ity is still centralized. The American system of government bet- ter represents its citizens than the parliamen- tary form. The American people would never accept a government that so greatly centralizes power and limits the freedom of its repre- sentatives to act of their own. will. To do so would be a reversal of two hundred and twenty three years of democracy.

A system of unique checks and balances wa~ cn:al!:d to allow sections of the government to have select powers with certain restrictions. James Madison, in the Federalist Papers, cited the need for such checks and balances was to create an environment where fac- tions. or political groups with certain agen- das, could not survive. Madison created this system because he did not believe the general public was educated enough to lit- erally choose policy and have immediat~ power; the system was designed to move slowly. A parliamentary form of government is designed, by definition, to move more quickly. Once a party has secured power it can pass almost any legislation it proposes. Just think of the years that civil rights legis- lation was tied up in Congress, pushed back in some committee, tabled until the follow- ing meeting.

H(}wever, if yo11 are living off campus or in the Seward houses, most likely you have a furnace located in the basement ofyourapartmentbuHding, which produces your heat. Depending on the age of your furnace and its level of maintenance over tl.e years, there may be some dtnger of carbon monoxide poisoning. Old furnaces, and even some newer ones, could have faulty or broken parts, which cause the harmful but orderless gas to leak into the house rather than go out the cbimney or through other exhaust ports. A week ago, this was the casein the Wendell Road apartment rented by Seniors Lisa Pasch, Ellen Taylor and Gina Lupino. Their landlord had the house's furnace improperly installed. Last Thursday, the toxic gases seeped into their living space. Luckily, none of the women were home at the time, but s0rne ofthe other ten- ants were. A faint sulfursmell was noticed and the Schenectady Police and Fire Department were called in. Carbon monox- ide readings were recorded between 500 and 525 parts per billion. That is 50 times above the legal and safe car- bon monoxide level. The house was aired out and vacated for a just under a week.

At the most basic level, the pro- liferatiOil of nuclear weapons is a threat to US interests. Since we already j>Ossess a nuclear arsenal, a ban onrlllclear testing would only prevent other nations from acquir- ing them. Our interests would only be limited in our ability to develop new nuclear technologies. This may be a losing proposition any- way, since mutually assured de- stmction may not be a g()od deter- rent to sn,all developing nations.

In many ways~ nuclear warfare is better suited for smaller countries. In the worst scenario,. nuclear weapons coulcJ fall into the hands of a ruthless leader, with no qualms about retaliation. Even if actual nuclear war does not result, the threat of such a \doomsday weapon'~ could paralyze US forces, compro- mising O\ll: ability to intervene in conflicts. ). ') Current nuclear technologies offer us little more assurance than that of destmction. Promises of a \Star Wars\ program, which would shoot down enemy missiles in the air, are still alive, but offer little hope in their current state. Their main weakness lies in the inherent difficulty of shooting down a supersonic missile witho\It detonating the warhead or scatter- ing radioactive debris. The most recent episode in this Saga is the Theater High Altitude Air Defense (THAAD). Unfortunately, after thirty-two billion dollars, it has yet to actually hit its target. There are other reasons to keefY small nations from developing nuclear programs. Years of deto- cials. Your health could depend on it. How does carbon monoxide af- fect your body? The protein Hemoglobin transports oxygen creates the protein carboxyhemo- globin ( COlfb). As you know, without the pres- ence of oxygen your body will cease to function properly .. It is starved as the level of COHb in your blood rises. Small levels of carbon monoxide in the blood may caus.e shortness of breath, mild www.aimsafety.corn headaches, nausea and other flu-like symptoms. Mild cases of carbon monoxide p01sonmg are often copfused with the flu or other common colds. Exteuded illnesses which are unexplainable could be the throughout your body by fornting a weak bond with o~ygen. Carbon monoxide prevents the hemoglobin from carrying required levels of oxygen to the parts of your body. The carbon monoxide molecules form a stron- ger bond with the hemo-globin than oxygen. This new bond result of unintentional and extended exposure to carbon monoxide. With a increase of between ten to thirty percent of carboxyhemo- globin in your blood, symptoms such as dizziness, mental confu~ sion, severe headaches, nausea, and fainting may result. If the carbon monoxide levels within your blood increase to over fifty percent your body can shut down, resulting in unconscious- ness, convulsions, a coma or even the possibility of death. In the United States alone, 1,500 people die annually and an additional W,OOO people seek medical attention as a result of their \Qnintentional extended exposure to carbon monoxide. How can you protect yourself and your roommates? If your apartment is heated by a filmace, make sme that your landlord or the school had a qualified technician install the heating system. Also, make sure that once a year the entire system is examined by a professional. Do not accept excuses. Your safely depends on the quality of work that was done on the heating system in yom apartment. Is there a smoke detector installed in your apartment? There shou.ld be, it could save your life if there were a fire. A carbon monoxide detector could also save your life. One should be installed in your apartment. One can be purchased for as little as thirty dollars, a small investment considering the possible risks involved. Test Ban Treaty nating nuclear devices on our own soil has taught us that nuclear testing is probably harmful in some way. Even if we assume the United States' nuclear program to be completely safe and environmen- tally friendly, it is questionable whether other, smaller nations will be capable of meeting this standard, or will have any reason to do so. A poor nation spending a large part of its budget on a nuclear program would probably be reluctant to spend more on environmental cleanup. The major arguments against a www.as.k..ne.jp/-hankaku nuclear test ban are that it would be unenforceable and that it would jeopardize American sovereignty. Enforcing such a treaty would indeed be .difficult and costly, but probably not as much as we have already spent on the development of a nuclear defense system. In addition, the amount of money spent on monitoring would probably be a bargain, compared to the massive cost of defending against a large number of smal1, nuclear powers. If this treaty is truly limiting of American sovereignty, then it should not be supported. How- ever, since America does not depend on nuclear testing, the effect of such a ban would be to increase American power. America possesses the resources to use computer models, which other, smaller countries do not, putting us at a further advantage. Even if this treaty is restrictive to United States sovereignty, the urgency of this issue necessitates that we advo- cate for another treaty in the near future. The United States' role as the only superpower provides us with a dominant role in the world. But if we allow other nations to acquire nuclear capabilities, our security will not last for long. L:in:riting nuclear pro grams in other countries would also control the amount of dangerous weapons in the world and free up funds for social and humanitarian programs. If these programs can help to settle the amount of civil unrest in other countries, then they may be our best defense. • af se n< Rt w w at ca st ti! w st: A: ~'1 to WI D1 da so of w: WI ba to Ht ga te1 of 1ir frr fn en av bo fel ba hi: ha by sa: m we si< Sl1 str pa 1 - l R

age 19 Rensselaer Reclaims \Shoes\ from Union Dropped Pa.sses Plague (Jffense in Fighting Dutchmen's Loss, 16-7 by David C. Brooks Editor-in-Chi€!/ Coming off an incredible high after b'ea1'ing College of New Jer- sey, the F·ighting Dutchmen could not fmd their groove and lost to Rensselaer. This is the Engineer's second win in tltree years and the Shoes willliveacross the river in Troy for at least one more year. Rensselaer came off their bye week looking strong, while Union looked fa- tigued. \It was a great game but we looked a little tired today,\ stated head coach Jo!ill Audino. As sophomore Hen Cilberl said, \This was a tough loss. We need to regroup and come back next week and play our game.\ The only thing going well for the Dutchmen was the gorgeous fall day at Rensselaer. The turf was soggy and slippery and Union's offense would find themselves water logged all day. On the Dutclunen 's ·second play from scrimmage, Gilbert was intercepted and the Engineers took over on Union's 35-yard line. Seven plays later, Re11sselaer quatterback Matt Robbens connected with Wayne Evans for a I 0-yard touchdown pass, giving Rensselaer a 7-0 lead. The next 50 minutes of football would prove to be a defensive battle and both teams were unable to pu.t any points on the board. However, with 7:30 to go in the game, senior Mike Thompson in- tercepted Robbens and gave the offense 1h.e ball on their seven yard line. Union could only manage one first down and was {()reed to punt from their nine yard line. Three yards deep in his own endzone, senior Ben Blackwood awaited the snap. Blackwood bobbled th.e snap, fumbled it and fell to his knees to try to throw the ball out ofthe end.zone. Yet, with his knee on the ground and his hand on the ball he was ruled down by contact, giving the Engineers a safety and the ball with 6:30 to go in the game. , Union's only scoring drive would come on their next posses- sion when Gilbert hit junior Bryan Slekes for an 82-ya.rd touchdown strike. Slekes caught the 15-yard pass then outran Rensselaer's de- fender for the score~ pulling the Dutchmen within two. Audino noted, \I thought we were in great, great shape in terms of getting the ball on the 20 yard line and all we needed was to kick a field goal.\ The Engineers would stick a dagger through the Dutchmen's comeback hopes when they marched 74-yards down field and scored on a 19 yard quarterback sneak on fourth and six. Gilbert's last pass of the game nality clearly sparkles at Rensselaer. Head coach John Audino, always classy and never showing poor sportSmanship, sim- ply tipped his hat and bowed to the unruly crowd. The crovyd didn't stop with that, wearing t- shirts saying \Union Sucks,\ which their dogs were even wear- mg. Despite giving up two touch- downs, Union's defense played quite well. They held Robbens to liable Thompson had seven tack- les to complement his. interception. Star linebacker Mike Rosenthal missed the end of the first half and beginning of the second with a mild concussion, but appeared to be fine after the game.

<lt~nrmtnsis • October 2'1, 1999 • Page 20 ·Sports Future LOoks Bright for Women's Soccer Still in the Running for NCAA Bid Despite Loss to Williams by Meridith Chace Staff Writer The Union College Women's Soceer Team struggled early this week with an exciting but disap- JlOinting overtime los·s to Williams. They were able to piece things to- gether, however, and snag two vic- tories at Clarkson and St. Lawrence this weekend. On October 12, the Dutchmen nmtched 11p against Williams in what they knew was going to be a tou;;h match. Union took an early I' -0 lead with a Katie Smith goal, J:;sistt:d by Sam Ryall. Williams quickly rebounded from the deficit Jnd answered just a minute later 1vith a goal of their own. The re- rnainder of the first half was score- tess, and the two teams entered the second half ina 1-1 deadlock. ln the second half, Williams found the back of the Union net with 20 minutes remaining, and the Dutchmen needed to act quickly. Union fought hard against the Wil- liams defense, and with just two minutes remaining Missy Matusewicz came up big with an .incredible game-tying goal off a KatLe Smith pass. Time expired and the game went on to sudden death overtime. Union dominated play for the ma- jority of the first overtime period, controlling possession of the ball. Then a seemingly small mistake proved catastrophic for the Dutchwomen. A Williams' forward took the ball down the right side and crossed it to an unmarked mid·fielder who scored with just 17 seconds left in overtime to win, 3- 2. 'Tbe loss was Union's second in a mw after breaking their 21- game unbeaten streak against William- Smith last week. The last time Union dropped two in a row was on October 11 and 14, 1997, when they lost to both William-Smith and W1lliams, ironically. Coach Brian Speck said, \We were coming off an emotional Wil- liam- Smith game. For the most part, our- intensity level was good, but they scored goals because we had mental lapses. We didn't play for 90 minutes.\ Speck thought that Captain Jaymee Wilson played a strong game. He also thought that the weekend would be a good tiine for the team to get back on track, which they did. On Friday, Union traveled to Clarkson for a 3-0 victory, a confi- dence booster after two tough losses. Onee again, Union took an early lead. Lauren. Byrne con- nected with Matusewicz for a goal three minutes into the game. Eight minutes later, Ryall scored unas,. sisted to give the Dutchwomen a two- goal cushion. After they got into a comfortable rhythm, Union's intensity level dropped and they failed to score again for another 85 minutes. Union's third goal was triggered by an attempted Clarkson goal off of a direct kick, late in the second half. Shannon Powers bad six. saves in the victory. On Saturday, Union rebounded fmm a scoreless first half to defeat St. Lawrence, 6-0. At halftime, Union made some adjustments stra- tegically for the upcoming second half. Speck talked about his ulte- rior plan, stating, \We were giving t11em too much space to play in frontofus. Wemovedourdefend- · ers up, and condensed the space for them to work with. That was the style we were playing bef0re the William\\\ Smith game.\ It was definitely a positive move for Union torn.ake. Union came out in the second half and went on a scoring ram- page. In a fifteen minute span, the Datchwomen scored all six. oftbeir goals. to capture the win. Abby HwTis and Matusewicz each had two goals. Byrne and Smith found the back of the net as well Ryall had two assists; Byrne, Harris and Carrie Price each had one. Going into Union's last week of regular season play, Matusewicz is the UCAA leader in points with 14 goals and three assists. Katie Smith is second with 11 goals and three assists. Ryall leads the team in assists with eight. Powers' save percentage is currently .871. The question on most people's minds right now is whether or not the girls will be invited to the NCAA National Tournament.

Head Coach Greg Roman is looking for- ward to having another strong team next year since he will have many returning players. The team will be losing, :first position, senior captain and four- year varsity letter earner Cassie Lawton. Cassie was a valuable addition to the team for four years and will be missed next season by her teammates and coach. 'The Dutchwomen were joined this year by two starting freshmen Megan Denefrio and Jackie Ma- son, who have promised to carry on: the immense success of the Dutch women in the years to come. Sophomore Shaunna Mercer thillks back on this fall and smiles reminiscently, saying that she can- not believe that the season is al- ready finished. For the Dutchwomen, daily practices on the cementcourts on the perimeter of campus are over for now. Their less frequently scheduled practices will be moved indoors as the weather grows colder. But come spring and surely by late sumtner, they will be occupy- ing the Union courts, playing in- tently, and once again prepa.Iing for the upc:ommg reasons; and the te~m entered this year's season hoping to prove to the NCAA that they have what it takes to enter and perform well in this tournament. When asked whether or not the losses to Williams and William Srnith would greatly hurt their chances for a bid, Speck was opti- mistic. \Our loss to Williams will not have a great effect on where we stand with the NCAA as it was an overtime defeat that we did not play on home turf.\ He continued, \What will ultimately have the greatest effect on the possibility of a bid will be how we perform at States. If we can come out on top and beat some teams who have previously been invited to the tour- nament, then our chances of mak- ing it will be immensely improved.\ Union will travel to Russell Sage on Wednesday and play Middle- bury on home field, Saturday at noon. This will be the last home game for seniors Shannon Powers, Elizabeth Fisher, Jaymee Wilson, Abby Harris, Sam Ryall and Sarah Cardullo, so please come out and support them.

Today, it is one of America's favorite pastimes to experience the thrill and excitement of a good basketball game. Basketball fans have had the wonderful opportunity of watching highly skilled and athletic individuals play a game that almest nobody fmds boring. Despite the National Basketball Association's extent of success, the league, its coaches, its players, and its fans all stand silently as they mourn the loss of a great contributor to tile game. Last Tuesday, Wilt Norman Chamberlain, one of the most talented and successful basketball players of all time, died from heart failure in his home in California at the age of 63. During his fourteen years of ser- vice in the NBA, Wilt \the stilt\ Chamberlain earned quite a name for himself. He was unstoppable in scoring and rebounding, as he leapt around the court like a bullying gi- ant. Bill Russell, Chamberlain's longtime rival, once said, \Wilt was the greatest offel1sive player I have ever seen. I've seen none better. Becaus.e his talents and skills were so Sllper human, his play forced me to :play at my high~ est level.\ He stood at 7- hmd 235lbs.,.and he .attracted d o11ble and even sometimes triple-teams when he had the ball. Despite his tendency to be fouled, Chamb,erlain somehow found ways to talce the ball to the basket and score $Orne points for his tearn. In his frrstcareerNBA gam~, he racked up 43 po:ints and 28 re- bounds, as he marled the opening of a fabulous ro()kie season, in which he average-d 37 points and 27 rebounds per game. He is only one of two players in basketball history to win NBA Rookie of the Year, All-Star Game Most Valuable Hayer, and NBA Most Valuable Player in a single year. Tlrroughout his !Career, he con- sistently topped the charts as the NBA' s It; a ding scmer for seven consecutive years and the NBA's leading rebounder for 11 ofhis 14 seasons. In the 1961-62 season, Chamberlain ast()unded the coun- try by averaging jQ.4 points per game. And of cou.rs~, no one could ever forget Chaml}erlain' s famous 1 00-point game tint still prevails Cornell's ~ Y:ine ~af/an Cuisine~ Bocaledal as the most points in a single game . today. In~ amazing game, Cham- berlain went36-for~63 from the field as he led his team to a 169-14 7 win over the New York Knicks: \My God, that's terrible. I never .thought I'd take that many shots in a game,\ commented Chamberlain. Not only was Chamberlain a never-ending scoring machine, but when asked to settle down and become a team player, he led the NBA in assists for two seasons! There was no doubt that this player was more versatile and · skilled than anyone from his time or any other generation. Even after retiring from the game ofbasketball, Chamberlain showed his athletic ability in sports like ten- nis, volleyball, and even boxing. At one point, he was seriously con- sidering challenging Muhammad Ali. In 1978, his first year of eligibil- ity, he was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall ofFame. Over the years, teams al- ways talked about asking Cham- berlain to comeback toplay,know- ing that in his old age, he would still be one of the greatest on the court. Players, coaches, and especially fans will n:ever forget the legacy that this superstar left hehind,, and believe that some ofhis records will stand forever. by Cory Kiefer Staff Writer This past week proved to be an intense one for the Union College Field Hockey Team. The week commenced with drill-filled prac- tice and long runs. The cancella- tion of a previously scheduled game early in the week presented the Dutchwomen with a lot of time to recover from the prior week's overnight trip and to get ready for the upcoming games. The weekend brought on the challenge of another overnight trip. This time the team would travel four hours to SUNY Oswego on Satur- day, stay over in Rochester and then face their next opponent, SUNY Brockport, on Sunday. Saturday started at 9:00AM for the Dutchwomen. They were on the field at SUNY Oswego by 1:00 PM. The game was on a muddy grass surface, which is something that the Dutch women, who usually play on turf, are not used to. Still, the team warmed up on the grass and got ready to face the challenge from Oswego. The game started off well for the Dutchwomen. Five minutes into the frrst half, Yvonne Turchetti was able to fmd the back of the net with an assist from Susan Joyal. Union kept Oswego away from their end and did not give them any chance at a goal. The game ended in a 1-0 victory for the Dutchwomen. Sunday afternoon brought on a new team. Uniononceagain faced the challenge of grass, yet they had conquered it the day before. The Dutchwomen had never faced SUNY Brockport before, and did not know what to expect. What they got was a very challenging and well-fought game. Brockport started off :the scor- ing with a goal in the n1iddle of the first half. The half closed leaving the score 1-0. The Dutch women were unwilling to let Brockport win with this minor goal, and they started off the second half with the drive to win. Early in the second half, Cory Kiefer was able to place a sly goal in off an assist from Jackie Eatz.. The Dutch women remained strong and fought till the end. Still, the game ended in tie, 1-1, which lead the teams into overtime. The teams played two IS- minute, sudden-death, seven on seven overtimes. These ended scoreless. The next step was a stroke off, five on five. Brockport was able to slide one extra stroke past the keeper to take the win. The Union College Field Hockey team ended its regular season game on Wednesday, October 2'0 witll home game against Hartwick.

Right in tt.e thick of things were the Fighting Dutch- men, fmishin~ 9th overall out of twenty\oneteams with 372 points. The Westfield course, although .flat and easy to follow, proved to be the grounds of much bafflement forthe runners.

Fol- lowing Waite were John Nieman (31:25), Joe KillcuHen (31:38), Jerald Whittington (32: 13), Nick Jones(32:25),Dan O'Leary (32:30), Don Schaeffer (32:45), and Atsu Kaneko(33:l6). These strong performances continue to justify the depth of the Dutchmen. The Union Men ·s Cross Coun- try Team looks forward to more zealous performances next week- end where they will be at their beautiful home course at Saratoga for the last time this year. In addition to th~ eight-kilome- ter race was a five-kilometer race that featured alumni and Union run- ners not currently in the top-ten. Andrew Weyl was the first Union fmisherin 19:25. Following Weyl were Terry Chang (19:31}, Will Spencer (20:37), Alex Militello (22:46), and Asad Choudhry (24:40). To accomplish this, theyneedecl to defeat lUT and then either Clarkson Unlversity or St. Lawrence Ulliversity.

Take Back the Night is designed as a protest against any form of assault against women be it sexual, verbal or domestic. The frrst Take Back the Night in the United States was held in San Francisco in 1978, more than 5, 000 women from 30 states participated. Although the night is all encom- passing, it will take. on a different meaning for each participant and the experiences they have had. The night is by no means limited to victims of abuse. Families who have.been affected by it, friends and supporters can all participate. It is meant to form a solidarity be- tween women of all ages, cultures, . and experiences. The statistics for rape and do- mestic violence are frequent enough to frighten anyone. The National Org<lnization ofWomen report that every 15 seconds .a woman is battered.

Seventy-five per- cent of college men and 55% of cdlege women involved in ac- quaintance rape had been drinking or using drugs. This year, Vnion decided to take a stand The \Vom.yn's :nnion, Seneca House and Safe Space sponsored a Take Back t'he ~ight on the Union campus. It was held last Wednesday, October 20 at 5 00 in front of the college center. Many members of the campus community attended wearing purple ribbons and holding candles in support and in honor of the victims uf \\'Aual assault and domestic violence. Two speakers appeared before the crowd. Deborah Noyes from the Rape Crisis Centel' in Schenectady was the fust speaker to address the crowd. Then the Assistant Dis· trkt Attorney w1ho is in charge of sex c-rimes, Joann.c Assini, spoke. Botl1 addn.:ssc-Jlk honibk natun: of tllese crimes and reiterated an important fact: in most cases of sexual assault and domestic vio· lcn~.:e your assailant is not a stranger. Both tried to explain that a victim should :not feel ashamed. After the speakers the mic was opened to the members of the au- dience to voice concerns and open a discussion. Students discussed the effectiveness of the new shuttle service to which Dean Alford re- sponded that it should be a more frequent and much superior service than the previous campus escort service. Another issue that arose was ticket booths around the pathway around Achilles Rink towards the upcampus housing. In an area that is dimly lit and secluded, these booths provide ample hiding places for possible assailants. Members of Safe Space spoke and explained that they are here to be a support network. There is a beeper that can be called 24 hours a day if needed. The number is on the back of the Student ID card. At 6:30, a smaller group pro- ceeded to the YWCA on Union Street carrying the banner that was displayed in the College Center. Many different groups were present at the YWCA, such as Girls Inc., .a local girls club, Parents of Murdered Children, the Albany Police domestic crimes unit and other representative organizations. Together, these different groups marched down Union Street, Eerie Blvd., and State Street carrying candks and d1anting thing~ :-uch as \:!-+-r.-~ ~n \fore Yi,lkllL.l', \'' 1 More Hate.\ This year's Take TI::~ck tht· ~ight was IJ grel:lt success, hopefully leading to an annual event tl1at will promote a greater understanding of and support for the victims of domestic violence and sexual as- sault.

He had consumed nearly an entire bottle of 80-proof vodka and had fallen unconscious almost immediately afterw11rd. However, this young man was not a student ofUnionCollege; he was a prospective student, only a se- nior in high school. That afternoon, at 2:30 PM the Admissions Office contacted two :malefreshmen, who will remain tm- named, and asked them to host a prospective that same night. The students conceded to the request, and picked him up at the admis- sions office at 4:00PM, a mere hour and a halflater. One of these two freshmen took the prospective to dinner at Upperdass Dining, while the other went to orchestra and the library. At Upper Class, the prospective admitted that he did not even want to attend Union~ he seemed very interested in the drinking scene, however, and was curious as to how he could get d:ru.nk that night. Following dinner, the host walked the prospective back to his donn room in Davidson Hall, where the prospective askedifthere was any bard alcohol available. The host pointed to a bottle of vodka in the closet, and, accord- ing to the host,. the prospective took the bottle out of the closet and began to <kink. The host saw him drink approx:ima1ely :five shots of the liquor until he left the room for ten minutes. Wb.en the host returned 1o theroom, the bottle was empty and .the pr()spective was un- conscious. At this point,. the host became worried and toldhis suitemate that \the kid was comatose.\ Word soon .spread that this prospective was not in good shape, and anum- ber of people ()n the floor at~ tempted to obtafu some kind of re- sponse from the prospective. He woke up after a short period of time and was broughtoutside the build- ing where a group of students were trying to get him to talk and walk arowd a bit. They asked th..e prospective what lte wanted to do, and he stated that he wanted to wa:.tch the Mets game, w this group of students sat down to watch the game with him. It was at this point that the prospective passed out and remained Ullcon- s-cious in the Davidson Lounge . Resident Advisor Sean Fitzgerald happened to be walking through the area and noticed the scene in the lounge. He immedi- ately calledCampusSecurity, who then in tum contacted Ellis Hospi- tal. In the meantime the host, who had been tending to the prospec- tive, ran to the library to try and find his roommate. When they re- turned to Davidson, the EMT team bad the prospective student on a stretcher and the host who had been at the library agreed to ac- company him to the hospital along with Fred Alford, Dean of Students. At the hospital, the parents of the prospective were called and the father, who had been staying in a local hotel, soon arrived. Accord- ing to Dean Alford, the prosepctive·s father was told that his son would have to \sleep it Continued on page 5

October 2flt 1999 • Page 3 Adressing a Prevalent Problem:_Anorexia by Courtney Hayden Staff Writer Addressing a prevalent problem · that is seldom ackaowledged on Union's campus, the Panhellenic Council sponsored an informa- tional evening at. tlte N ott Tues- day on the subject ofeating disor- . ders. Led by counselor and edli- . cator Cherie Plante of the River C()Qnseling Center, the event fo- cused upon anorexia and buliinia, two of the most common disorders fotmd on college campuses. Explaining that eating disorders · are a function of psychological, biological and social conditions, Plante discussed factors affecting . the onset of the disorder and the implications they have on the ev- . eryday life of the individualsuffer- in~ .from them. The turning point in Rich's life came when his brother cDnfronted him with the possibility that he could essentiaHy cause his own death. Through the support ofhis family and guidance of clinic coun- selors he managed to take control ofhis life after living sevenmonths with the disorder. To this day he explains that he still experiences side-effects of his compulsive dieting and exercising that inhibit him from participating in sports and other activities that he once enjoyed. Julia Trechen began herpresen- tation with gauntly thin photo- graphs of herself at the beginning of her disease in the late 1960's. Only eleven years old wllen first affected with anorexia, Ms. Trechen described the disease as a product of intense obsessional thinking.

Finally, this one person must keep track of all computer systems, which display fire and building alarms, With allof things going on at once, it is no wonder that calls take several minutes or hours to be responded to! · calls ''comprimises students' safety.\ BiU Sickinger agrees with this and would also like to see x600@ moved out of Security's realm, per- haps to another office or an auto- mated system. In an average week, security receives over 2,200 calls. Less than 4% of these calls are in- which are students requesting to be transferred to another depart- ment. An average of two to three calls per day are of an emergency nature. Bill Sickinger believes that ih6000 was moved out of security, students would not have to wait nearly as long for help. Commonly found in upper socio- .. economic populations, media im- ages are deemed essential factors Dispelling the notion of the anorexic as an individual who sel- dom craves food; she commented, \Anyone with any type of an eat- ing disorder has a voracious appe- tite. There is not a single moment in the day that an anorex.ic is not thinking about food.

Plante, however, illustrated that there is a large discrepancy be- tween the actual goals ofthinness and glamour and the actual goals ofthinness and glamour those ef- fected with eating disorders. strive for and the actual toll it will take on tb.ei:r bodies. Comm()n side-effects ofboth disorders include chronic stomach and heart problems, in- somnia and muscle stiffness. \These are things that often stay with you fot .the rest of your life,\ Plate commented as she elaborated 011 each of the symptoms. \These are awful. They are not beautiful, and ·they are not glamorous.\ Speaking as members of CRAED, the Capital Region Asso- ciation for Eating Disorders, Julia 'Ireschen and Rich, a RPI graduate student, illustrated the ways the disease manifested itself in their lives. Rich began demonstrating bulimic symptoms [()ur years ago during an intensely stressful pe- riod in his life. \] was working a full-time job while trying to do graduate work,\ he reminisced. \1 was overwhelmed with work. It just seemed like there was a mountain of things that came up upon all at once. I think I may have become bulimic because food was one thing in my life that I could . actually have control over.\ She described th~ fear she felt upon the disease's onset as well. Because public awareness of eat- ing disorders has only surfaced over the last decade, Trechen didn't have the means available to her as an adolescent to make sense of what she was experiencing. \I had no idea what was happen- ing to me,\ she reflected ... 1 just knew that something was. physi- cally, spiritually and emotionally taking hold of me.\ It not wttil her mid 30's that she became able to take control of her eating habits. She can now easily dismiss the unattainable images of female thinness that is perpetuated in the media. \It all comes down to this: What do you value in a perso11?\ she asked. \If you tlike away nothing else, there is one thing I want all of you in this room to remember when you leave tonight, and it's something you need to remember in your heart, not in your head: This dis- ease kills. \It can easily put an end to what could have been a fulfillillg pre- cious life.\ • ·United way Scllenectad)' CounlY

Symposium Still Searching for Funds l>y Katrina Tentor Layout Editor Stu<lc=nt Fomm was faced with a contro1•ersial issue at the meeting on W ~Jnesday, October 27: The debate is to decide whether or not to reco,gnize and fund a club tllat has the same interests and mem- bers as a theme house. Last_:year, Greg Fox, Alex. Chase and A vmm Joffe formed The Sym- posiunt, which is now a new theme house ~to the Union College com- munity_ All members all have :limi- lar intnests and discuss topics of intellectual debate. The twelve membe-.rs prepare dinner for their guests and the house is open to the can1pus for lectures, and group discuss ions on various controver- sial isslles. This year, The Symposium wanted to expand its relatiQnsh.ip with thee surrounding community. This rnceans funding of some sort. Housernembers formed \TheSym- , posium\' (the club). It was brought up for discussion at the Student Forum, but had some slight prob- lems VI ith wording. The original constitllltion directly connected the club wiith. the house. Students who designed thc- constitution were not aware .of the policy of duplicate names, therefore the changed the club name to \The Forum.\ Theme House Consortium Chair- man, Ian Eletzhelieves that Student Forum should be looking for more clubs like the proposed \Forum\ to give funding to. \There is so much positive energy coming out of the Symposium, that they should receive funding.\ The purpose of The Forum is to hold intellectual discussio11s and interact with other student'sviews. The intended plan for The Forum is to hold inclusive events open t<:> the whole campus. If there were to be exclasive eventsj then other non-funded groups have a legiti- mate argument against the forming of the new group. Conflict arises when fraternities and sororities argue that theme houses are receiving fundillg. The Forum may seem as a front for the theme house, supporting the house~ But, members ofGreek or- . ganizations can fonn clubs too, as long as the club is open to the en- tire campus. Ten people interested in the same thing can build a club that will be funded by the school. The house can host the meetings, but the club would be a separate organization. The Symposium house manager, A vnun Joffe says, \The house and the club are two separate entities.\ Funding for The Forum will strictly be used for Forum events. Guest speakers, dinners and dis- cussions will be held. The Sympo- sium will host some of the activi- ties, but will also be held in other buildings around campus. Similar to the proposed club, Student Forum recognizes and funds the Coffee House club. Some members of the CoffeeHouse live ill The Society, a theme house on campus. Money budgeted by Student Forum is used to provide the campus with live entertainment in a ccffeehouse atrnospher.e and to encourage informal discnssiort and a sense of community. The Society hosts some of the Coffee House events.. Although the two parties llave similar intere.sts; there is a distinct line between the two · groups. Any hcuse can o:pen up their doors to hosting, yet, The Society seems to be the heme of the Coffee House. Student Forum has a problem with students refer- ring to The Society as the Coffee House. . The Forum is already a ltead strong; group that students ate will- ing t~ participate in. Joffe states that there are 58 interested mem- bers of the club. \Thatshows there is a need for a larger group.\ Stu- dent Forum has recognized the strong; interests and will try to ac- coirl1llodate. the requests ofUnion students.

Also known as \The Festival of · · Lights,\ Diwali is one of the most widely celebrated Indian: festivals and falls on the last day of the last month oflunar calendar. It is a time to forget enemies and jealousy and to lighten the path of life, which is symbolized by the lighting of 14lllpS. In an attempt to involve the com- munity in this celebration, Shakti advertised in the Tri City Indian Association's (TRICIA) jQurnal, and students from RPI, SUNY, Siena, and Albany Med were in- vited.

Muddana said, \Everyone worked together to make this event hap- pen.\ Shakti: also sponsors dinners at Indian restal).rants, which the campus is invited to attend. The other big event that they are in- volved in is the fashion show held • in the by Brooke M. Barylick Editor-i12-Chiej Two Ufiion minds came to- gether last spring to create a new group on camptts. Idol Minds, a comedy improv group, arose from the creativity of Jon Zandman, Class of 1999, and Mike Winn, Class of2000. This ideadeveloped into a funny and entertaining al- ternative to the typical theater per- formances. Winn stated, \Well Jon and I wanted to perform comedy in ways that weren't available through our theater program at Union, so this Saturdays at South.Park seemed like a great idea.\ Auditions were held in the be- giniiing ofSpring 'Term last year. by Patrick Streck Contributing Writer Saturday morning, brothers from the Phi Garnina Delta Fraternity, also known as Fiji, made their way down to South Park in ScheneGtady to administer Fiji:s weekly Satur· day Morning Youth Recreation .Program. The recreation program is :t weekly event run by the.fraternity which allows local Schenectady youth to play orgarti.Z.ed gaines and sports every week under the su- perVision of the Fiji brothers. The weekly program also allows the participants' parents to run er- rands on Saturday morning with- out having to take the kids along. This p~si week, the brothers se:t up mini\street hockey game on the park's bllsketball court. Sophomore Fiji Pete Conitori ex.- plained, .. 'The kids usually like to play in big groups so they vote on what they want to play. We're. always afraid the girls woll 't want to play some of the things the boys want to play so we bring a variety of games. But the girls are in these just the same causing equal havoc.\ Now in its third year, the Recre- ation Pr()gram h;:t~ become a sig~ nature C()-nununity service project for Fiji alongside such sta;ples as the Big/Brothers Big Sisters Vol- leyball r:oumament and the St. Claire'sHospitalPhone-A-Thon. Chair of the Campus& Cori11nu- nity Committee at Fiji, senior Greg Johnson, attributes the program's success to the str.ong emphasis placed on community service in the house and the structure of the fra- ternity. \Service to the community is an integral part of what our house stands for and brothers act on that principal. Apathy is frowned upon at Fiji. The nature of a fraternity is such that we have a large group of people who can easily be mobilized to undertake large projects.\ On October 30, Fiji will hold its annual Haunted House for the B'ig Brothers/Big Sisters \Iittles which will be complete with candy apple making and assmted refreshments and candy. Overnight Stay Takes Unexpected Turn off,\ and the boy was released.· Dean Alford was unable to elaborate very much on the story, as there are still a number of unan- swered questions. However, he did state, \We are investigating the situation to de- termine whether or not the stu- dents broke a college policy. Cur- rently, there are pending_conduct charges against the two freshmen hosts.\ Dan Lundqt1ist, Director of Ad- missions, was asked how he feels about the whole situation, as this_ obviously looks very bad for Union College. Lundquist said, \I feel horrible. This was clearly a couple cases of bad judgement, and I'm sure all the boys would handle the situation differently if they could.\ He elaborated on this to say, \We are sony for what hap- pened. Unfortunately, we do not legislate behavior or script for overnights.\ According to Lundquist, this was not the first time something like this has happened, and it will most likely not be the last time, ei- ther. When asked about whether or not the situation could have been prevented and whether or not the ... continued from page 1 .-·~- File Photo Prospective student jeopardizes his chance at admission. freshmen boys were at fault, Lundquist replied, \Ifhe [the pro- spective] wanted a drink, he'd get it, whether raiding a liquor cabinet or getting a bottle of vodka from a freshman.\ · • At those auditions, A vrum Joffe, ' Liz Kaier, Greg Fo:x,_JoniHMayer and Mark Will were chosen to join · the group with Winn and . Zandman. Because of the positive resp-onses to the performan-ces in . the Spring, the group decided to hold auditions again at the begin- ning ofF all term. Twenty-five stu- dents auditioned for four spots. . These auditions resulted in posi- . tions for Suzanne Hoyer, Eugene • Schultz, Dave Jacksand Thatcher Woodley. The group practices twice a week by playing standard ill1prov games as well as trust games and teamMbuilding situations. Winn commented, \We work well together because we are all insane and love being creative. It's such an original gr<>up of people and we're all relieved that indi- vidually we're not the only crazy ones at this school!\ He continued, \Not only do I enjoy performing and making people laugh, but I think that the ·. best part of being a part of Idol Minds is the time I get to hang out . with the members. The practices are soine of the best times 1 have had at Union.\ Jonill Mayer noted, \I'd like the record to show that [dol Minds is a cult and I fully enjoy both the human sacrifice and rehearsal as- pects of it. If it weren't for the people listed above, I might be tempted to wear tigllt black pants and confonn.\ \Whatever you do and wher- ever you are, avoid direct eye-con- tact with Thatcher, it's just not a good thing to do,~· A vrun Joffe explained. This past Sunday evening Idol Minds ~held their opening perfor- mance for the season in Old Chapel. As students crowded into the seating area they were asked to write down a phrase on a piece of paper. They were told that these phrases would be used later in the show. Old Chapel filled up quickly, and one could feel the anticipation and excitement in the room. Winn ad- dressedthe audience first and wel- comed :the crowd. He also asked for their support and encourage- ment during the show, noting that the energy of the performers in- . creases with the energy emitted by the audience. Winn then intro- duced the members of the group. He explained that they would be playing a series of games that they had rehearsed before but not in the exact scenario in which they would be perf<Jnned at that time. The evening started with a party scene in which Fox left the room and needed to determine the prob- lems associated with the guests at the party. Winn asked for sugges- tions from the audience that re- sulted in a goat fetish for Schultz, a terrible genital itch for Jacks and an inability to eat cleanly for Mayer . The scene caused the crowd to erupt in1aughter, and all perform- ers were entertaining as they acted out their parts. The hext game consisted of 20 emotions that were derived from suggestions from the crowd. These ranged from drunk to jeal- ous, unstable to violent and pre- menstrual to'homy. The audience was also asked for a location in which the .two performers, Hoyer and Fox, were located. The jungle was the location chosen and the scene progressed with Winn tell- ing the actors which emotion they had to portray. From the loud out- bursts of laughter it was obvious that the crowd also enjoyed this game. Another game that evoked much laughter from the crowd was Inter- preter. This scenario included Wirm and Joffe interpreting the actions and jibberish of Woodley and Hoyer. The conversations moved quickly from hamburgers to the movie Top Gun. The performance included many other skits that were both comical and entertaining. They plan to have another performance sometime next week.

• · ei\mpus ·News Dean Lewis Runs for Local Office by Gina Campanella Staff Writer. This November 2 hundreds of Schenectady residents will come out to vote for their new CityCoun· cil One of Union College's faculty members, Dean Bradley Lewis, has been involved. in the race. This is Dean Lewis' first time running for public office and he credits his decision to run to his long-time interest in politics and political issues. Dean Lewis also decided to run because he is happy that Union is finally taking an active role in the improvement of the city and he be~ lieves that, with the right leader- ship, \prospects for Schenectady are better tha.n they ever have been before.\ Seward place is going to be ben- eficial to both the .contrn'\lnity and to Union College. However, he doesargae that one must be care- ful not to simply expand th~ walls of the college, integrating o.ur- selves int<l the conununity will be much more beneficial to Union in the long run. Dean Lewis believes that we all have a mota! obligation to irnptove our surroundings, and he believes that ifhe is elected he will be able to improve his surroundings more significantly than ever before. He is very passionate about helping the surreunding community. He and his wife hav:e continually par- ticipated in community service en- deavors i:llid non-profit organiza- tions. One hope that Dean Lewis has is that someday Schcnect.ady will be a place. that many Union Col- lege students consider staying af- ter graduation. He describes the idea that there are no opportuni- ties fot young people in· Schenectady as a Brain Drain .. When addressing the idea that the negative attitude of the student Stoa n Miller/CP . . Dean Lewis is preparing for the upcoming elections. However, he did point out. that although the school board is com~ pletely separated f:vom the city councilt the school board is doing quite a. bit to improve ,the state of Schenectady public schools. Dean Lewis also discussed the . . idea that Schenectady is the most dominant city in the county, yet the county and city officials rarely communicate with each other.

Phi Delt Helps Special Olympics by Eugene $thultz Features Editor This past Saturday, the brothers of Phi Delta Theta volunteered their time helping out the Special Olym· pics ofNew York. From 11 in the morning until five in the afternoon, brothers acted as . coaches and scorers for the New York Special Olympics district- bowling tournament. Over 40 bowlers took place in this tourna- ment. They participated in catego- ries including singles, doubles and teams offourplayers. · Each grouping played three ten frame games. The volunteers helped to make sure things went smoothly since lanes often mal- functioned, scores were. in error, and pins would not reset. Luckily, the employees ofPines Lanes Bowling we.re very helpful and understanding to all the diffi. culties that arose. Dave Andrews, a :Junior, was surprised that with all the problems the lanes were having, \things went really welL\ Most of the time things ran smoothly as bowlet·s got into a rhythm. The only ,thing tile coaches were doing was chatting with bowlers or congratulating them on numerous strikes and spares they bowled. Everyone seemed to have a great time and all of the bowlers received awards at the end during the dosing ceremo- nies. Phi Delta Theta has never worked with the Special Olympics before in any capacity until Com- munity SetVice Chair Josh Cabn organized this event. Josh has. been very busy organizing events fot Phi Delta Theta this term, and this one in particular he was very proud of, saying \ doing comrnu- Co~rtesy .Josh Cahn A Pki /)eft brother poses at the eve;nt o7!.Saturday. nity service makes one feel great, but you feel eveubetter when you can see the effect that it has on the people you are tlying to help.\ The brothers f~t111d many ofthe bowlers energetic. and very talk- ative, constantly high-fiving one another and berng very support- ive of each other_ Collli Clinch felt, '\even though I do nc>t bowl, and think it is not a sport, I was very impressed by h()W' good everyone was.\ Even those bowlers who scored low had a great ti:m.e just being very supportive of e-a~h other_ There were some very tood bowler's at the tournament 11s welL One of these bowler's ba.d won the gold medal at the Intemational Special Olympics severa.lyears ago, which prompted Phi Alex..

Barylick E'4itor-in-Chief Local Schenectady youth nC>w .have a new academic support sys- tem. The Gmm1a Phi Beta Sorority and the Alpha Epsilon Pi Fr~tter­ nity ate co-sponsoring a tutoring center for fourth graders who 1:lt· terid the V a:n Corlaer School. Last spring, Dean Alford ap- proached Jon Zandtnan and asked him to staff :a homework center with brothers fmm his fraternity as well as sisters from a sorority on earn- pus. Zandman subsequently a)l- proached the President of Gamma Phi Beta, Erin Aloan, and asked for her assista11ce. These three indi- viduals·collaborated with members of their res])ective houses in addi- tion to the General Electric Elfun Society a11d Gretchel Tyson, tlJ.e head of Affirmative Action a11d Communit5 Outreach. The purpose of the center is to provide a :safe place for the stu- dents to C()mplete their work and to sufficie11:tly prepare them for tile New York State mandated test tilat is administrated to fourth graders. It is open from 3:30 to 5:30PM, Monday tliTough Thursday. Tho.se who begall the center hoped that students would spend time at the center eveJY day that tutoring is available. This fall Michelle Stein and J()e Ehrlich have coordinated the men- tors from their Greek organizations. In the winter, Rebecca Dufrom()nt and Scott Com will take over their duties. Currentl:Y, both houses have pro- vided fourteen Union students who are donating their time to the cause. Before becoming mentors and tutors, they participated in a series of tutoring sessions, in which they learned about the stan- dardized tests and techniques for dealing with the students. They also spent some time in the English/Language Arts block of some of the fourth grade class- rooms so that they would better understand what methods they shouldemploywhen working with the students. Upon arriving at the center, stu- dents are encouraged to begin working on either their homework or practice for the standardized test. Erin A loan explained, \We hope to have the kids pair up with the .same people every day to create continuity and stability in their aca- demic lives. We ask that the Union volunteers dedicate at least two hours a week to the center. We have gotten an extremely positive re- sponse from them. Those who are working at the center are dedicated to the cause, which makes it that much more successful.\ Currently, the homework center is being housed in the study lounge of Fox South until \The Alps,'' an old restaurant and bar located on Park Place near Seward Place is renovated. Due to a gener- ous donation from the widow of a Union Alumnus it is undergoing changes however, because it is not yet complete, the Fox lounge has been slightly renovated to acc<lm- modate the students. Erin Aloan noted, \I think that this is an amazing program. I can't think of a better way to give back to the community. It is already at- tracting incredibly positive public re1ations attention for Union. There has been lots oftnedia cov- erage.\ She continued, \The effects of this program on the children of the surrounding community are ex- pected to be profound.\ The center promises to be a great asset to local children. All ofthose who are involved are hoping that the program willexpand to encom- pass more Union students as well as more fourth graders.

Page 10 · October 28, 1 ~99. · m.unr:nrmtniiis We all come to college hoping to leave the cliques that consumed most of our high school lives and enter an environment where pe0ple are more open minded. However, it has become apparent to many that . this is not the case at Union College. Upon arriving at Union freshman year it is obvious that people are incredibly nervous and excited about what is ahead of them. For the first · time many students have the opportunity to live without the overbear- ing guidance of parents and experience life living next to people ofhQth . sexes Some take advantage of these opportunities by becoming friends wtth those who I i''e near them·. Others become friends with those in their classes or on their sports teams. Regardless of where we meet these people, they quickly become some of our best friends. We experience the troubling adjustment times to- gether and enJOY all of the \firsts\ that college has to offer. Although we still remember cmr high school friends, it is with our college acquaintan- ces that We experience the best times of our lives. These college friends are the people with whom we ordered Howlets at3:00 in the morning, danced in the hallways and accompanied to our first fraternity party. They are the ones with whom we stayed up threugh aH hours of the night talking about high school days, heartbreak and families as well as recent events. We enjoy their company and seek their . support as we experience the changes that college brings. Why does ou.r connection with thein sever so quickly after that one year'! Not only do we separate from the friends we rnade freshman year but also those people in our classes with whom we had great conversations a.nd similar interests. We see them walking around campus and it's like that moment we were once \great\ friends never existed. We are aH aware of the importance of extracurricular activities. For some of us these include sports, while for others it is clubs and still others participate in Greek organizations. Some of us combine all three aspects. Regardless of how we chose to spend our time, we all become busy and lose touch \with those we once .cherished. We become en- gulfed in ourselves and find that our time together becomes slim. The . term passes quickly and then students leave for the summer. Upon returning to campus, many live in their new locations the following year, such as fraternities, sororities, theme houses or independent liv- ing situations. We are not advocating that everyone should jump up and hug every- one they know. but why not just say hi doing so does not take much time and it is important to those around us. Our concern about this matter is substantial because we realize that this social factor extends into the working world as weB as the remainder of our adult lives. For instance, our jobs may have us work with a certain team for a project, where we end up spending many late nights :up together, hav- ing break down sessions, and then, as quickly as it begins it is over. The subsequent week we might have a new team and a new project, and we find that we have very little to talk about with the people we worked with in the previous week. This analogy extends throughout vari<ms aspects of our lives therefore, we should try to curtail it's effects now. It is sad to see people come and go in life, and maybe one of those people could have been a best friend, boyfriend, or girlfriend if things were different. That is why we must seize the day, not be scaredofwhatpeoP,le~ght think if we acknowledge their presence by more than a nod or stiff smile, because life is short and you may have r~grets if we continue to let opportunities pass us by. \'There are no such thing as strai1gers, only friends we have not yet met. \-Anonymous DCD OP/ED f {Zf: SIt /'1 A tJ A Moderate Reponse Last Thursday, as I walked into the campus center with my horde of hired friends, I went to pick up a copy of the Concordy, that is after I bought a drink at Dutch to fight my extreme dehydration. If you're not picking up the sarcasm, I'm a member of the Greek system and I thought I'd respond to the two ar- ticles that droned on for pages about why fraternities and sorori- ties suck. For those keeping score, I grouped the two together foi my response, since the people who wrote them had no ;pmblem group- ing myself with hundreds of other students on this campus when they made their comments. Don't worry, before I started to write this, I went over this \alphabet\ con- cept, and I think I have a good . handle on it. I'm a senior here at Union, and I've seen creative and original ar- ticles like these come and go, prob- ably two, three times<! year. Never having paid too much attention in the past, this time around I took some time off from matching my outfits to my fraternity brothers' and my fits of drunken gay-bash- ing to respond. I felt, hey, I'm a pretty intelligent guy, maybe not smart enough to fit the word ho- mogeneity into the same article twice, but I'll do my best. But speaking ofthat, I have a sneaking feeling that if this campus was as homogenous (I did it!) as the two of you thought, why do we need to have 18 Greek organizations? Surely we should only have one of AM each, Alpha Beta Khakis and Sigma Gamma Capri Pants. Maybe certain clothes are just popular lately, and it's not those damll.ed identity C()llectors up to their old tricks. Andhere'sa shock for you: I like to drink. I even get drunk occa- sionally. Every once in a while, I miss class! However, these state- ments have nothing to do with each other. Whetller you drink or not and whether you study or not are your choices to make, not the Greek system's. Its()undslike thetwe of you don't like to drink, so you're all set. But any of you who do drink, I wouldn't take \Marcus's\ advice about drinking for heurs before you go to fraternity parties, because that's when you end up a.t Ellis, getting us in trouble and making people like \Marcus\ and ''1'' sound like they have a point. Otherwise; these two seem to !rave it all figured out. I mean, it must be great to discuss Socrates md Plato every weekend. And ifl didn't have to compensate for this small penis of mine, I wouldn',t have to pay for these friends. I could just go live it up with you guys, whoever you are, filling my weekends with memorable experi- ences. Obviously, you guys have better things to do than hang out in 173-degree heat in hopes ofhav- ing promiscuous, drunken sex with random, nameless partners. Or do you? I was convi~ced you did, but then I realized that neither of you - attached your real name to your ar- ticles·. The only reason I could fmd for retaining your anol).ymity would be to avoid being excluded from parties. That takes a little out of the effect you were going for, wouldn't you say? From what I heard, one of you isn't even a stu- denthere. So maybe college hasn't pro- vided you with the memorable ex- periences you idealized about in high school. And if it has, I'm all ears. Nexttime you get a journalis- tic urge, why don't you write about the alternatives to our primi- tive methods ofenjoyment? Print some of your poetry from Jackson's Gardens, or maybe you can en- lighten us Greeks about the un- imaginable pleasures of sober sex. Until then, stop wasting your time and the time of the Concordiensis's many readers by harassing a sys- tem whose members get enough criticism from an administration who actually has a say in our so- cial policies here at Union. Sincerely, Ryan Nespeca FvOWl!S~Sp It wasn't yo11r fault. It doesn 'tmatter what you did or said or wore. It was not you who acted inappropriately.

Buchanan has C[)me under fire recently for his comments in his book, in which he claims the United States should not l1ave gotten in- Speaking about this year's fro11t- runners, he said they are \hollow men, the malleable men willing: to read from Teleprompters speeches scripted by consultants and poll- sters ... Candidates with ideas need not apply.\ The problem that Patrick Buchanan faces is that his ideas are unpopular. Most people recog- nize that it was necessary for the United States to enter World War II; even if Nazi Germany did not pose a physical threat to Ameri- can soil, it certainly would have hurt the l lS to have a Europe con- trolled by a tyrannical leader su<:h as Hitler, to say nothing of the llu- man rights abuses that took place within his sphere of influence. Further, while many within the Republican Party are in favor of strengthening the military, the idea ofbringing home all of our troops is not the answer. It cannot possibly be in our best interests to abandon countries such as South Korea and Taiwan, where aggressive Communist na- tions would pounce upon these small democracies. In addition, legal immigratiCJn should not be an issue in the right stands.\ The Reform Party is a mi:x of people with very different views, and as such is the choice many extremists who cannot fmd a h<Jme in one of the two establishe.d po- litical parties. As sue h. its members are willing to support anyone with a hope of making an impact in the general election, regardless oftheirviews. The Reform Party itself only has two major issues: campaign fi- nance reform, and entitlement re- fmm. ln the end. Patrick J. Buchanan, if he wins the Reform Party n()mi- nation, will only succeed in draw- ing Yotes away from the Republi- can candidate. His ever more extreme positions have made him unpopular now with even the largest conservative party in the G!llteJ Stak~. the Re- publicans, and his dwindling sup- port can be seen in his fundraising efforts.

He .took over ri~ht at the by Matty G Staff Writer As fall has arrived and Hallow- een and Thanksgiving are right around the corner, it's time for Matt's Easeball Awards .. Baseball this year is now in its final week, and wll.ile the Yankees are up two games to none in the best of seven WofldSe:ries, there ate no Yankees mentioned in this any ·of my awards. First, I would like to say that baseball this year was very inter- esting. Tile Mets and Red Sox both made their respective League Champi<>nship Series (LCS) and brougllt out hopes of a Subway Series between the Yankees and Mets or· a repeat of the 1986 World Series. with the Mets and the Red Sox. PersonaJ.Jy, I think of the teams that made the LCS's, the Braves <tFe the least interesting. They have a staff off our top-notch pitcl1ers. and while pitch.irrg wins gan1es. hitting keeps people inter- ested. l'he Braves are even begin- ning to bore people in Atlanta. The Braves couldn't even sellout play- off games at home, which is un- heard C>f for post-season games. Bobby Cox has organized a great team, and after losing Andres Galarrag~. Javy Lopez and Kerry Ligtenbel'g for the season and still winnin,g 103 games. Holding off the Mets with their late season surge \vas very impressive, as was dismantling the Mets in their last . few gar11es together during the last two weeks ofthe season. Chipper Jones \vas one of the major reasons for Atla11ta's butchering of the Mets, but in the LCS he was held chants of\Larry Cliipper\s given name, helped the Mets sta.ff to si- lence his bat. All in all, the Mets would be a much more fun team to watch than the Braves, 'but due to Kenny Rogers's inability to throw a strike, the subway series is not to be. In the National League, there were many good pitching perfor- mances for the year, artd none stood head and shoulders above the rest. Kevin Brown pro.-ved that he was worth the contract he signed by putting up 250+ innings with a ERA of 3.00 and 220 strikeouts. The lack of a Dodgers team even with all their indi- vidual talent lim- ited Brown to a respectable 18 wins, but should have given him more support. There was a glut of pitchers with over 30 saves, nine in all, and while Ugueth Urbina was probably the most im- portant to his team. Finishing 62 games for the Expos and saving 41 of them, he did not domin:ate like a closer must to receive the Cy Young award. I believe that the Cy Young winner in the NL should go to Randy Johnson. He only posted 17 wins, but he ll.ad 143 more strikeouts than th.e ne:xt clos- est pitcher, he pitched 20more in- nings than anyone else in the NL, and he also lead the league in ERA, 2.48. Mike Hampton had a stellar year, only losing four games while totaling 22 wins, a sub-three ERA, shut(!)uts,. but I give the nod to triple crown in the AL, but failed beginning, and led them into the Johwon, who, can dominate a game to win, arty of the three catego- Promised Land of the playoffs in like ~nly one other in baseball to- ries.

Let's begin with this previous weeke-nd's movie, Summer of Sam. ~won't say too much about them().'Vie itself. Ifyou sawityou a I ready know how teJTible it was. If you haven't seen it I strongly recomn1end you make aU attempts at avoidi11g that movie. It was two hours and twenty ni inutes of agony. l'he one interesting point in it tho11gh was the talking dog. I was highly disturbed by tbe fact that many people in tbe theater laughed when the dog talked. Are all these people historical and cul- tural idie>ts? I thought the history behind the Son of Sam serial mur- derer Vias conunon knowledge. That scene was not included to be funny. And yet there wereall those people laughing at it. I11 fact, I found the scene to be quite disturb- ing to some extent. It was almost as if the writer of the movie was acknowledging truth behind the killer's statement that the dog made him kill the people. Regard- less, the movie was quite intoler- able. If you want to leam about the Son of Sam I'd recolliDlend doing some research on it, but for the life of me I can't tell y()u how much you '11 regret having wasted your time seeing the movie. If that last paragraph wasn'tjust completely off topic I don\t know what is. Anyway, I'm trying to tell you about the serious pt10blems with the Campus Center audito- rium. First off, the posters around campus said the movie WiiS play- ing at 8 PM and 10 PM. Now, of course that was impossible be- cause the movie was over two hours long. Isn't there someone out there reviewing those posters before they get printed? ln fact, there's a lot of wrong infCJrmation on th.em, but that's not the point right11ow. So anyway, I got to the auditorium at a couple minutes to ten in order to meet some other people to see the movie. When I got there, though, there was a sign saying that the movie would be playing at 9 PM instead! Well what was I ,supposed to do? I had no idea if the other people had already ar- rived and gone in. As it was, I had planned to meet them there, so I had inadvertently caused them to miss the fi.-st hour of the movie. Any- way, 1 went in to watch the movie, and luckily I managed to find the people I was meeting. I soon found out tltat I was lucky. I had missed the first hour of the movie, but I've already explain~d the reason for that. It was when I started watch- ing tile movie that l realized the changing of the playing time wash 't the biggest problem. The projec- tion amd sound equipment in the au- ditorium is constantiy 1iddled with technical problems. The picture it- self was periodically distorted, for what reason I have no idea. No doubt there was once again some- thing wrong with the projector and it wasn't working right. Of course, the projector wasn't half as bad as the sound. When I first got there the sound wasn't too bad. That quickly changed, how- ever All of a sudden, it got so soft that we .couldn't even hear what the characters were saying. Then it became so loud that niany people were forced to cover their ears. This says nothing ofthe in- credible sound distortions which occurred from time to time throughout the showing of the movie. These distortions were often so bad that it became pain- ful just sitting there. Despite the factthatthemovie itselfwas ter- rible, the auditoriUltJ. was even worse. I don't know why the people who run the movies can't just figure out how to get the equipment fixed; orat least learn how it WQtks. And don't think it was just this movie that had prob- lems. They all do. Some aren•t quite as severe a·s was this weekend's problems. for ex- ample, one weekend the sound was just incredibly loud. But of- ten there are serious problems. :Ouring a showing of The Mummy the projector stopped right in the middle. Then when it started go- ing again it was in the wrong place and nad to be changed. For a good portion of the movie the picture was out of focus. And, of course, there were serious sound distor- tions throughout the entire show- ing. The best example would be from the very first weekend when The Matrix was shoWil. Not only were there equipment problems, but also there were problems with the film itself. I lmow this because I went to see the movie on Sunday and it w.asn 't being shown. Clearly there are some major problems. So I say again, why can't this stuff be worked out? Seriously, .vhat is the point in showing a movie if there are going to be ~o many problems? The movie cer- tarnly isn't muchfun to watch that way. Somethillg must be dcme so that movies can be shown in the Camp:us Center auditorium with- out constant teclmical problems.

The Utica and Ca.naj oharie shales are order than the Schenectady Fm. and are made up of very fine layers of solidified mud. These rocks were depos- ited deep in the ocean a11d are very fmely grained because there was little to disturb them during deposition. The fossils in these shales are mainly graj)tolites again along with some clams and trilobites. Some of the fossils have be- come pyritized mealling that the mineral Pyrite has replaced their shells. This indicates that the water had very little ()Xygen in it during deposition. If the water had ha.d a lot of oxygen, the fossils would be rusty, but being pyritized makes them look like gold. This is a major fact about the depositional environment that we cam deter- mine just by looking at the fos- sils. These rocks are well ex- posed to the west of Union, out by Canajoharie and further west along I-90. The N ormanskill shale is an interesting rock in that this rock, or other rocks just like it (we call these rocks \correlativ~\) extend all the way up to NewFoundland in Canada. This shale is again very fme grained and in our area, it is of- ten found all folded iUp and ShaLe. This is a very fmed grained shale that in our area is relatively un fossiliferous. Above the Mar(;ellus Shale, are a series of coarser-grained grit beds that con- tain many fine fossils including clams, brachiopods, and trilobites. This is a good rock to look for fos- sils in and is well exposed to our south. S(), now you know a shales are not just some boring mudstones that all seam the same. The main way we tell shales apart is by fos- sils. Guys like RudolfRuedemann and Charles Proesser first did a lot of tllis type of work in our are. Proesser was a geology professor right here at Union College back in the late 1800's. This week's field trip is to Visher's Ferry.

About halfway down this road, you will come to an in- tersection with a road coming in from the left. Go.straight here and continue on w1til you see a sign for the New York State Power Authority elec- tricalfacility at Visher's Ferry. Go right here and park before the gates.

Page 14 · .October 28, 1999 Tragedy on Mt. Everest by Alexandra Lohse Staff Writer \Straddling the top of the world, one foot in China and the other in Nepal, I cleared the ice from my oxygen mask, hunched a shoulder against the wind, and stared ab- sently down at the vastness of Ti- bet.\ This captivating sentence is how author and renowned moun- taitl climber Jon Krakauer opens his personal account of the 1996 Mount Everest disaster, Into Thin Air. I will admit that I am not accus- tomed to reading outdoor adven- ture or tragedy novels, for I usu- ally prefer reading fiction novels which end happily. I like to read books to escape the horrors ofre- ality, therefore 1 do not want to vol- untarily subject myself to tragedy in gri.tty detail. l12to Thin Air intrigued me, how- ever, after I read this year's fresh- man required reading, Into the Wild, which was also written,byJon Krakauer. Into the Wild was so ab- sorbing and engrossing that I felt compelled to read more of Krakauer's novels. Into Thin Air is Jon Krab.uer's version of the 1996 catastrophe on Mount Everest, which Glaimed the lives of eight climbers, including two world- class mountain climb- ers. In this accurate narration of the deadli- est season in the his- tory of Mount Everest, Jon Ktakauer guides the reader step-by-step from the Everest Base Camp to the Summit, unraveling a horrifying story that will send a chill down one's spine. Krakauer successfully brings the reader back with him to that fateful day on Mount Everest to detennine what exactly went wrong that night. Bow could two world class clilllbers make such er- rors in judgment? The author puts the ill~fatedpieces togetherand ac- curately illU:strates the tragedy of Everest to ihe reader. Throughou-t the book, Jon Krakauer incoiporates his trek to climb Mount Everest With the his· tory ofthe most gargantuan moun- tain ofthe world. He details the first few attempts to climb Mount Everest and discusses the first sue- cessful eJC,peditiort to reach the summit, led by Sir EdmlllldHillary and sherpa guide Tenzing Norgay. The author also adds stylistic nu., ances to his account. Krakauer begins each chapter with an ex.cerpt from otherprominentbooks depict- ing the trials and tribulations of climbing :the tallest mountain on Earth. By far, Jon Krakauer scripts one of the most riveting and influential outdoor adventure hooks to date. Krakauer avQids the h:ype ofother accounts, which capital- ize onmisfortune and, m the process, exploit the tragedy. He thoroughly researches the disaster, and he tells his story ac- curately and vividly. The result is a profoundly poignant narrative that pays 'homage to the brave souls on the mountain while broaching insightful and perhaps unanswerable questions about huma.n behavior in a crisis. Even ifyou do not feel you are the. \adventure-type\ reader, take a leap of faith by picking up Into Thin Air. I can honestly say that this book is one of the best items of:}iterature I have ever read, and I . give it my utmost recmnmendatiort. If you are looking for a bQok that wiltcapture your attention from the opening paragraph and will keep you engrossed until you flip over the last page, Jon Krakauer's Into Thin Air is the perfect solution. Although time for pleasure read- ing is limited here at Union, this baok is a great way to escape from the text books and required read- ing that is burying all ofus. If you absolutely can not fmd the;: time, pick it up an hold on to it for just three more weeks when you will find yourself with six weeks and nothiug to do! ''just art by'' Sanskriti Thakur , t \

I feel my ability tocom- rnunicate and work with others is perhaps n1y greatest attribute. This skill could be best used at Union in the fonn of Student Assistant to Dean of Faculty. I could be an intermediary between faculty' and students. Wllen students are upset I can voice their concerns directly to faculty and get dliect feedback for students. I would exist as a tran- sistor to connect students and faculty and at the same time fight for students needs. My greatest influence in life was myelev- e!lth grade history teacher. She had sll:ch a hlige impact on my life &nd we bonded so well ,fua:t l now cannot wait for the days when I will be :teaching students. I know Student · Assistant to Dean of Faculty would be a great opportunity that I would enjoy as well. Ifelected, I will succeed for both students · and myself.

As president of my high school senior class I have extensive e:xperience dealing with faculty. Th:is posi- tion also previded me with the opportunity to hone and perfect ·rny leadership skills.

Remember Windser for\S~~cial Assistant Timonthy Trim born Hello, my name is Timothy Trimbom and I want to be your Student Assistant to Dean of Sttldent Affairs. Let me tell you why I think I deserve 1his job. First of all I'm hardworking and willing to put student af- fairs before my own in order to get the job done. I also b.ave four years of student coun- cil experience ill high school where I was able to fully understand both h<Jw to hold office and ensure things are done properly~ I cantlot say I've never made mistakes, but I always corrected. them and made sure noth- ing y.'as -leftpoorly done at the end of a day. I also feel I have been able to leamand take something awa yftom each mistake and I am much hetteroffluving made them. During my f()ur years in student council I was able · to m!lke many sirldes benefiting students. Of all these strides, none was so great as when I cha:ngedmy schools grading policy to include a rea.sonable explanation with every F a teacher issued. This way students wo1.1ldalwaysi<:ncw why they failed and had the ability to fbc their _errors rather than scxa.tch their head and wonder wh.at went wrong. My ex,perience in the field of stu- denhffairs makes me the most qualified for Student Assistant to Dean of Student Af- . fairs. It elected, I can promise to make real changes on Uni<Jn;s campus. I guarantee more student activities for students to take advantage of. This means no1 only more events like party in th-e garden but more clubs for these who feel there is no outlet oncam- pus for their talents. I will also work hard to get more funding for these events and clubs ancl hopefully give stud,ents more ability to do what they want. Protecting students is another concern. I want more blue lights on campus and more walking security guards. No one should have to fear anything on this campus. In addition to more activities and security I want to make the students more active in campus policy. This will not only make stu- dents more aware ()f what changes are _ef~ fecting them but also give them more power to change things thc::mselves. Student Assistant to Dean of Student Af- fairs is the only position for-me. I love Union and have a great desire to see it prosper. I have the experienceand am the most quali- fied for the job.

,. .. I . •. ~ . \' r ·\'· • Page 20 • October 28, 1999 · Elizabeth Dole Abandons White House Bid . . - . by DavidGruner Staff Writer A cabinet secretary in two GOP administrations and former Presi- dent ofthe Red Cross quit her 2000 Republ icqn presidential nomina- tion on Wednesday, October 20, 1999. If elected, Elizabeth Dole would. l1ave been the first woman presi- dent·in U.S Histor)Y\. Instead, her abandonment follows that of former Vice President Dan Quayle, foumer Tennessee Govemor Lamar ·Alexander and Ohio Representa- tive John Kasich. The reason'! A :concern felt by every other viable candidate, the inability to raise en·ough money to compete with the front-runner GovemorGeorge W. Bush. ln her own words, Ms. [)ole .stated that her lack of funds hampered her ability to travel, communicate with voters and hire campaign staffers lor key stutes, making it \nearly im- possible to sustaill an effective campaign. A recent Gallup Poll forOctober, showed Ms. Dole in second place behind·Gov.Bush:. 11 %to an over- whelming 60%. The other candi- dates combined received an. embar- rassing 20%: Senator McCain, 8%; Mr. Forbes, 4%; Mr. Bauer and Mr. Keyes each with 3%; Senator Hatch,2%. What is. even more significant than the tepotted percentages is the fact that most people who voted for Dole would have voted for Bush should she have never entered the race. Now with her sudden departure, those votes are pretty much a given in GeorgeW.'s campaign. Dole had never formally an- nounced for the presidency but unofficially was running. Her for- mal announcement was scheduled for November 7 in Des Moines, Iowa. She raised more than $1 mil- lion from July to September, but was far behind Bush and accord- ing to most was the credible female ever to seek the White House, \ ... the bottom line remains money.\ Dole, 63, a native of Salisbury, North Carolina., and graduate from Duke University and later Harvard Law School, was certainly experi- enced in terms of knowledge of substantive issues, yet her sup- port margin was narrow. She attracted mostly women, the youngest Republicans ages 18~29, and in the Midwest,. the horne of her husband, Bob Dole, the former senator frorn Kansas. Asked if she would have done anything different in her campaign; Dole remarked that leaving the Red Cross may have amassed more support, but then again, \ ... who knows if it would make that much of a difference because this is something that's never happened before,\ she said. \You know,· timing' s· everything, isn' tit?\ What is left of the Republican Party? Well, for starters there are fewer candidates and more votes aching to be captured. Yet, those votes are mote than likely to fall into Bush's lap only because Dole's support was so similar to that of George W. 's. Aside from Bush, the field is separated into tw0 tiers, the top belonging to lt!illionaire publisher Steve Forbes and Arizona Senator J olm McCain, and the bottom half be longing to religious conserva- tive Gary Bauer, co:tru.nentator Alan Keyes and Utah Senator Orrin Hatch. That tier is quite lop-sided, though, inching towards the rich Texan. · Before harassing Bush and his \race to win,\ though, the son of a former President of the United States offered some proud remarks connnending Ms. Dole: \ ... she has made a mark in the political pro- cess. \She entered the primaries and brought a lot of ,dignity and class. I'm proud to call hera friend and I wish her all the best\ Such words spark interesting _ questions concerning a possible ru.1Uling mate for Gove~or Bush. Whil~ Dole did not endorse an- other candidate anQ. declined to comment about the possibility of being on the GOP ticket as a vice presidential candidate, it is a valid speculation should Bush win the nomination. Yet, her husband is close to Senator McCain, and that too may play an :important role as the pri- maries roll around and the races gain momentum. Whatever hap- pens, though, it is without ques- ·tion that Ms. Dole was one of the most experienced candidates in the GOP field and should it not have been that she faced 75 to 1 odds with regards to her cash availabil- itytherace n1ay have not have con- tained as much oil on one side. The 2000 election is just over a year away, and it seems that the Republican battle is between Bush and McCain, and whomever is the victor, should either one attain the nomination, it is sensible to say that the wife of the former Kansas Senator will be seen in some form beside that victor and hopefully play a pa~ in American operations for the next four years, if not more. Health Care Legislation Again inN ews by Ben V\lormer Str..!tf JIJhter On Monday, President Clinton spoke to ('ongress regarding a bill that would increase Medicare cov- erage to provide prescription dTUgs to the elderly, and disabled. The plan would co'iJerprescription bills up to a tholllsand dollars a month a11d would invoke a new twenty-four dollat- a month pay- ment for Medicare policyholders. The pmposed bill would cost 1 18 billion dollars over the nextten years. and would also inc Jude the e liminati.on of a c·o-payment and deductible over thene:xt ten years, while allowing for .expensive diag- nostic tests such as mammograms and pros late cancer screenings. The bill is one ohrccent flurry of legislative proposals regarding health t:aJe, pitting the issue of cost vs. coverage in an ·Ongoing debate which has risen to IJecome a major tssue. one whKh Congress took a major stt:p towanls addressing at the.begmnmg of this month. Cltnton's proposal is only a ripple in the oceaJi of legislative proposals that have been made in the past three yeaJs !() adjust the quality a.nd quantity of health care provided to Amer£cat1s. The goal ofmu<:h if this legisla- tion has been to pmvide the most comprehensive he altlt care cover- age at the lowest ~ost to as many Americans as possible. Yet almost all these bills have dealt with fed- eral health ca:re and not the pri~ vately run and regulated HMOs, whose plans now account for 70% of insured Americans. The man- aged care industry evolved be- cause of an increased demand for quality health care on the part of consumers and efforts to deal with increased costs by the government and providers in the late eighties and early nineties. Clltdr:al Trial&: Now these organizations face a Patient's Bill of Rights, the cumu- lative legislative response to years of unregulated coverage. In late September, the House passed its version of a Bill OfRights, which includes provisions that would give patients covered by plans the right to sue if they are denied cov- erage. President Clinton has endorsed the bill, but it must first be recon- ciled with the Senate version be- fore a vote can o€cur. Such a vote is not expected until later this year, and it is likely that the debate won't be takcin up until next year. . Republicans look upon the House bill as an UIUlecessary piece of legislation. Many advocate holding HMOs accountable at the state level, citing the fact that nearly every state has already en- acted laws which allow purchas- ers to sue health care providers. Democrats favor Federal regul-a- f • a i.ll: nt:. .: L 'II hJ ~u ~· m ·!> Uit c m l(·o~.kll11 u>tllh fu1 un\ulllted damngt·~ l~lan:s mus.t pay co~!' 1 t:)<(ardles~ t>f cvpc~}ftreatm~m. unk~-; trml i:~ spnn~>red b> Hl·\ \lh•\\ .. pillit:lll!i to ~!n1 wilh lht-lr d .... t .. : n t\ll if 1hn lt·.s-.· lh~~ IJ)\10 tion in order to create a more con- cise and consistent policy on an issue that effects. all Americans. Health Care Industry Advocacy groups has been adamantly op- posed to any regulation on the fed- eral level. Charles Kahn III, presi~ dent of the Health Insurance As- sociation of America, commented that the House Bill would allow \Predatory attorneys to Swoop in like a bunch ofbuzzards.\ Consumer advocacy groups, doctors, and Democrats have all answered with stories of patients who either suffered serious injll!y or death after being denied ser- vices by their health plan. The rnles and restrictions put into place by HMOs ort the industry range fwm requiring a doctor to call a 1- 800 number and ask for approval of simple and necessary diagnos- tic tests to forcing patients in need ofimrilediate care to travel long dis- trnces to an Emergency room_ des- ApJ}li·es only to 48 million \\lt h tooeraUy regulated p'fat1s. 1'.,;\1 n~w rt~ht Onlv cancer patients Onl;.. mS11h.1t lmoalized ph:~rii!ill. <H 1crm1rMII~· ill patt~nts ..:a11 .. t:n \\ tlh their doctnrf,l if !hey le~tvr tb'l' plan ignated by their health plan. Doctors are not only hindered in diagnosis, but are also forced by HMOs to construct treatments in accordance with cost- a practice which can deny potentially life saving surgical procedures and treatments once the diagnosis is made. Many current HMOs will TI()t pay for experiential procedures or for new drugs being offered as part of clinical trials. Whether or not such regulation is a hindrance or a severe irupedi- ment to a Doctor's ability to treat a patient is still debated. Republi- cans s.ee the power to tegulate HMOs through liability as merefy a means by. which doctors regam lost income while regaining the power to choose a treatment, and fearing that doctors will compen- sate for recent pay cuts resulting . from HMO regulation by prescrib- ing expensive and unne.cessary procedures. Republicans argue further that making HMOs liable will result in an increase ·in the price of health care an4 a corresponding decrease in the number of people who have health insurance in the US. Ap- pro:ximately 44.3 million Am.ericans are currently uninsured, and the Congressional Office of Budget Review estimates that the average health care costs are 170 dollars per month. The Office ofBudget Review es- timates that the current House bill will raise the price of insurance pre- miums by 4. 8% a month over five years, yet says that only 1.4 % of such an increase in price would be attributable to litigation. Democrats argue that such a shift is beneficial, and that by put~ ting the power to decide a course of treatment back into the hands of doctors ensures better care. President Clinton stated, \Ameri- cans who are battling illness shouldn't have to also battle in- surance companies for the care they need.\ W(}uld yo• ~~ to Wri~jJrin:~t Wfl(ittt{eifo:~to'it?i#Sx!\ ri(ftliict Neil ', · Routmanat·rou·tintt/nn@ti~i~lz.~ectit ~r'·at.:eX.telliion 6604~ ,. . . .

The frrst il:lgredient is !lmbigu- ity: is Taiwan part of China, or is it an independent coun:try? On the one hand, 98% of the population is ethnically Chmese. Settlement from China began in. the seveath century C.E., but three million -of Taiwan's people immigrated just fifty years ago. On the other hand, Taiwan became a formd Chinese province only in 1885, and ten years later, after winning the first Sino-Japanese War, Japan took Taiwanasacolony. Those who see Taiwan as Chi- nese quickly point out that in 1945, _ after Wm:d War II, a defeated Ja- pan returned Taiwan to Chinese control. This was natural, since China had been part of the Ameri- can alliance during the war. But in 1949, China itself was rent asun- der: an off-again, on-again twenty- year civil war cu1mirtate4 with vic- tory for the Chinese Communist Party under Mao Zedong. The defeated Nationalist Party re- treated ~ an ex,odu~ of millions 'Of soldiers and refugees - across the Taiwan Straits. Once again, a sepa- rate island. But the Nationalists didn't es- tablish a separate country. Quite the.c;:ontrary. They have been ada- mant in insisting - for half a cen- tury - that they are the :only legiti- mate goveflllll.ent ofnotjust Tai- wan, but the rest o:fChina as well. The UnitedStates, implacably hos- tile to a comtnun1st Ch.ina,. sup- ported thiS pdsition, for example by defending (·until 1'973) Taiwan's control of the \China seat\ in the United Nations, and byrefusing to recognize Beijing's legitimacy. But durin~ those fifty years, the two societies grew.apart in impor- tant ways. Through a combination of circumstances - massive US fi- nancial aid and technical advice, a close relationship witbJa:pan, and an educated and energetic popu- lation - Taiwan modernized much · more rapidly than did China. By the late 198()s, the middle class created by that economic growth generated demands for p()litical freed()m,and today, Tai- wan boasts a rtmlti-p-atty political system which is energetically cl:emocrl:!.tic. In the 1970s, as tile United States developed a new, warmer and more productive relationship with China, we walked a tightrope on the Tai- wan issue. The Joint US-Chinese communique issued in Shanghai in 1 f)73 was a masteFpiece of diplo- matic ambiguity; saying in part, '\'People on both sides of the Tai- ~an Straits recognize that there is C)nly one China, and that Taiwan is 11part of it.\ For another twenty- five years, all three sides were S(}ntehow able to .ignore the real- ity. But now China i& also moderniz- rng. In 1997 itregainedsovreignty over Hong Kong. And the Taiwan- ese people are increasingly unwill- ,iJJg to play the \one-China\ game. Beijing says, unambiguously, that if Taiwan declares itself to be an imdependent country, China will invade. Given Taiwan's massive investment in defense, an invasion would leave only a blackened moonscape. Nervously, the US warns Taiwan against declaring independence, and warns China against any reunification that is not peacefully achieved. Those who wou:Id like to learn more about these issues are in- vited to attendi either of two viewings of a superb 90-minute documentary film, by Boston's WGBH.

New Indonesian President Affects East Timor Policy byPhWpCho Stajf:Writer On Octtober 20, 1999 Indonesiam :PJ:~~iden,i :J;U. llabibie withdbe~ ~. ' . ' . . . . .

The ~pp<Jintment ofTanjungatLd Wira111o came just hours after Habibie lost a vote of confideiJc:e by the assembly. This was tt sjg;n that the People's Consultative As· sernbly w<luld bave rejected HJ.

This only left MegaW'a. ti Sukar;noputri and Abdurrahall!~n Wahid:in the running for the ln:dm- nesian Presidency. MegaWJ~ti sukamo;putri was expected io p(]lll welL Abdurrabman was seen as. a. key co11:tender in the presideati al race asa Muslim leader. Megawati • s ln.donesian DeOl«l- cratic.Party Struggle captured m():t~ seatsi:n the People's Consultatiwe Asse!l1b·ly than any other party, b-ut the ntaj ority was not .enough 't() secure her election to the pr.esi- dency. Wahi.d outrnaneuverecl Mega wati to gain the support 10ft' a simple majority ofindonesia 's 70() legislators, Wahid's presidency was se- cured when candidate Yusril Mahendfa withdrew and ihrew his support behind Wahid. Wahid took 373 votes in the assembly to Me~awati's 313. The two appeared together after the vote, appealing for calm and unity. On0ctober21, 1999 Indonesia's parliament prepared for a crucial vice-presidential vote, one day af- ter· Muslim leader Abdurrahman Wahid was sworn in as the first freely elected president in Indonesia's history. Wahid's Na- tionalAwakening Party expressed interest in Megawati for the post. On October 22, 1999 Megawati Sukarnoputri swore to uphold Indonesia's constitution as she took office as the couJitry' s first freely elected vice president. Wahid's National Awakening Partytookasignificant step toward unity by nominating Megawati for the post. Megawati became the favorite for vice president .after her loss. The vice presidency takes on new importance in light ofW ahid's frail health. Wahid has had two strokes in recent years and is nearly blind. People believe that Wahid will not complete his five-yeu term. Megawati would succeed hirn. On October 25, 1999 Indonesia's new president promised a \New Indonesia\- a country more pros- perous and democratic, though led by some of the same Cabinet offi- cials as previous .government. Abdurrahman WalJ:id outlined wide\rangin.g changes in domestic, international and military affairs. He felt that raising the living standards and narrowing the gap between the rich and the poor could solve fudonesia's problems. Wahid will lead the world's fourth most-populous nation and its largest Muslim country. Among his goals were an improved eco- nomic relationship between Indo- nesia and Istael, which would end years of auimosity between the two. On October 26, 1999 President Abdurrahman W ahid revealed he will include Suharto-era officials in his new Cabinet Wahid said Suharto holdovers would be held to a high ethical standard and be required to become part of the \new Indonesia.\ Wahid also said that relations witb:the West would take a back seat toties with China. Wahid also outlined a list of demo- - cratic and human rights reforms for Indonesia. The election of Wahid ended four decades of authoritarian rule. Indonesian President Abdurrahman Wahid named a new \national unity Cabinet\ that re- <l!lces the military's once-powerful r()le and includes representatives fi:omall of the colllltry's major po- litical parties. W ahid named follf Cabinet mem- bers who had served under Suharto or Habibie. Juwon()Sudarsono will replace powerful chief General Wiranto as defense Minister. Sildarsono will be the first civilian tCJ hold the post . Clearly, steps have been made tCJ strip the military of most of its p()wer. In further steps, Wahid llppointed a navy man as military chief Admiral Widodo Adisutjipto had served as Wiranto's deputy, bat played no part m Indonesian politics. The navy is widely regarded in lodonesia as less corrupt than the army is. Wiranto was namedcoor- cinator minister f()r social and p()- litical affairs, a post that carries little direct control over troops. Alwi Shihab will replace Ali Alatas ~foreign minister. Shihab is a U.S.- edacated college professor and lslamic studies expert. Meanwhile, on October 27, 1999 :the United Nations stepped in Tuesday to guide East Timor to- ward independence, formally tak· ing control ofthehalf-island terri- tory from Indonesia. East Timor's two-and-a-half-de- cade transition to independence won • t be complete for two to three more years, butthe EastTimorese on their way to the freedom. Dur- ing the transition period, the United Nations will have jurisdiction. The task won't be easy. Thou- sands of East Timorese have no homes after pro-Indonesian militias went on a rampage. The island has little in the way of schools, courts, police or even a currency of its own. Indonesian troops are slowly leaving the island. A U.N.-mandated force, sent in to restore order, will stay until the United Nation's own blue-hel- meted troops are in place. Some of the current troops wil1 make up the nearly 11,000-strong UN force. Xanana Gusmao :is expected to be the new nation's first president. Indonesian President Abdurtahman Wahid said he would gladly meet witM:Jusmao when he comes to Jakarta. Evidently, things have finally c-almed down for both the East Timorese and Indonesians. Both East Timor and Indonesia are now in new roles and.positions. Clearly, military control .in the politics of Indonesia seems to be over. This is the first time lmdonesia has had a President thait does not have close ties to the military. The mili· tary clearly has been stripped of most of its power. Indonesia is becoming an inde- pendent, people's government. The military is now in a weakened political state. This helps the situ- ation in East Timor as well. East Timor is well om its way to inde- pendence with the help of the United Nations end its troops. It seems that c:ivil unrest in East Timor is over. The dramatic events that occurred these past months have been favor:able. I am happy that violence di<l not escalate as it did in Rwanda, ilnd Checl:mya. They have made huge leaps into the right directi()n.

Science & Technology Internet as a Cure for Democracy by Steve Ayers StajJWriter The internet has b~<;ome a robust communication medium, which some believe is capable of helping to increase participation in western democracies. As with any new media forms, it has inspired optimistic ·views of the future. At this point, however, it is diffiwlt .to determine whether or not the Internet will eventually help stimulate democracy. The Internet has potential for improving political participation. In the past, media forms have been separated into person-to- person forms, such as the telephone and mass media television and radio. The Internet contains some characteristics of both. Users are free to search for their own sour~es of information on topics tha 1 they are interested in. Discussion groups, chat rooms and mailing lists facilitate political discussion. It is difficult for mainstream media to maintain dominance in such a competitive environment. It is possible that a smaller media source, such as independent newspapers or radio stations, will begin to emerge. Voter turnout has been in a decline since the 1960'' s, and Internet technology may be one possible solution for this problem. Some have even advo- cated using the Internet as a tool for voting. The National Bar Asso- ciation has recently published a large report on this .; subject. Realistically, the nonvoter may still be reluctant to reform despite our greatest efforts. The mere availabil- ity of tools for democracy on the Internet does not necessarily imply that they w111 be used. In addition, it is question- able whether direct democracy would even be desirable. Most people agree that we need some sort of representation. The question becomes one of how much power we are willing to afford to our officials. the dependence of politicians on polling is bad enough already, and if V()tes aFe taken on every issue on a regular basis, we can only ptedict that this situation will get-worse. Po1itkal pal1icipation requires program is desirable. The imoE:lymity of the Internet allows pecple to debate pol.itical issues, · bu.t it allows them to do so from a distance. It is also debatable how long the freedom ofthe Inter- net wiU last The Internet is a collection of computer networks, .and many of t h e s e networks are ··owned by 1 a r g e corporations. The demand for more www.e-thtpeople.com power fu 1 a little rnoFe than just a point and a click. It requires an actual' personal investment from the citizen. Ihtemet voting would make it easier for a large-r aniount of people to vote, but it would also displace them from the actu.zl process of voting. If V()ting over the Internet just induces the apathetic to vote, it :is debatable whether this multimedia applications .could necessitate larger, and possibly more centralized networks. The concept -of convergence, or the merging of various modern <COJ11lllunication forms, including the Internet, could change . the face of the Internet completely. There is also no guarantee that tl\.e Internet will bring democracy to other countries in the worlcl. w hi<:h are not as technologically advanced as the United States. ln America, the internet has developed at a rapid pace, and this may have given us a distorted picture of how it has developed throughout the world. Despite some claim.s that the Internet is impossible to. censor, China and Singapore have both proven able to restrict the information on their Internet. Finally. there is the fact that the Internet is even a financial strain on the western world. This alienates most of the rest of the world from taking part in this. In its tltlrrent state, the Internet fills some rolls that are important for democracy in America. It will take more than this to t·ruly improve democracy in America, However. In addition, there is no guaratltee that the Internet will continue to fill this toll in the future. For this reason, we must do more than just casuaHy rely on. the Internet for a solution t~·low voter turnout and lack of public information. We must closely monitor its development and also look for 9ther · solutip~s. A.cid Rain Discu:ssed in the Hot Seat; ..... by Alex Militellv S~trfi Writer Recently, this past Thursday ni.ght Alpha Epsilon Pi invited Professor Grant Brown of the Biology Department to take part in the fraternity's ongoing Hot Scat lecture series. In this series. the honored speaker discusses any topic withill their field of study which is of specific interest to them. Profes- sor Brown decided to enlighten tl1ose present with a little lesson ot1 current environmental con- cerns, or more specific~lly, the present effects of acid rain on the world. When industrial plants and other factories release various chemicals into the air as waste products, such as nitro~en and hydrocarbons, cloud moisture condettses on these dust particles (as they would ~Il:Y dust particle) and fall back to the earth ill the form of rain. In colder regions of the world, and during the winter season, these water d(coplets will freeze to become acid snow. As many people may already know, the effects of acid rain can be devastating on an ecosystem (the society in which various plant and animal species co-habitat and interact with each othe1). The damage can often be seen on the bark of trees living in an area tllat has suffered this type of rainfall, or in the surrounding shrubbery and grass. But it seems tint the most noticeable consequences of all appeal' within the lak~ s and other water environs around the world. The functions of all aquatic life, from the tiniest microscopic plants to the largest fish (of the magnitude we discussed; about 30-40 centimeters), depend upon the secretions ()f a few individual species in order to locate prey as well as predators in their murky habitat. This task would otherwise be quite difficult given the poor visibility and darkened world teeming with other, smaller organ- isms. These instinctive secretions, while letting - ,-·, many organisms and other fish know about the surrounding preda- tors and prey, are very sensitive to changes in the acidity of the water. environment (~-k. a. a watershed) is. on to:p of a natural limestone bedmcl:, because of the very basic nature of a substance such as limes.1one, the environment can absorb a greatdea.l of acid rain with· outtoo.rnuch concern for its nega- into the acidic.lakes and slow1yn'du- tra1i.ze them. All that this accom- plished, it seems, was to make the fresller water more acidic over the (ongrun. The Agency has spent millions of d()lfars in quite a few hopeful en- deavors to solve this problem of cleaning up the lakes. Profes- sor Brown sug- gested, with the great majority of us in agreement, that the money might be bet- ter spent on trying to dean up the acid rain at the source: the smokestacks. Most forward thinking companies today, evidently, fmd · it to be in their own If a predator does not know when prey is www.publie.~u.edu best interests to pay --------~~~--~~~--~~~--~~~--= tive effects. Bllt, if a watershed is the rni:nimal cost of equipping their nearby, then how can it locate food? Conversely, if the prey do not know where a predator is lurking, then how can they avoid being attacked and eaten? What this all amounts to is .a whole ecosystem of \blind\ fish, a product of the slight irregularities in the unusually high acidity level of their habitat. Professor Brown, along with a few others, have performed experiments to verify the validity of the claim that these irregularities (slight chemical changes) in these secretions are, in fact, caused by the slight change in the acidity of the water. Some of the lakes in question are better suited to dealing with the problem of acid rain. This is a natu- ral consequence of the bedrock that the individual lakes or rivers lay on. If an established aquatic located on a very neutral type of sfn()kestacks with scrubbers, or bedrock, such as granite , then the catalytic co~yerters, andclean their ability of the \granite\ soil to ·ex11aust at the source.

Brooks Editor-in-Chief The Fighting Dutchmen's of-· fense came alive Saturday against Co(lst Guard Academy has they amassed 3&0 total yards of offense and handed the Bears a loss, 24· 14. Union was able to set the tone of the game with a ru1111ing game that ran over the Bears all after- noon. Union ,came into the_game averaging only 77 yards per game, but exploded behind the running of sophomore Jasper Mills and Freshman George Beebe for 147 yards, nearly doubling their aver- _age. Mills ended the with day 90 yards while Beebe had 51 yards and recorded his second touchdown of the yea~onasix-yar~scamper. Se- . nior {;aptain Brain 0 'Donnell re- marked, \It feels good to establish a running game, and have a more balanced offense.\ .Sophomore Ben Gilbert looked sharp, despite two interceptions, going 18-28 for 205yards. . Bill George and the rest of the Coast Guard coaching staff clearly didn't think Uni<:m' s rushing de- fense was as good as the polls said they were. Of the 26 plays during the first half, 20 were running plays, which got them nowhere. The Dutchmen only allowed 48 yards rushing on the day. Union's secondary was too much for the Bears, however, as Coast G~ard quarterbacks combined f()r a 6-20 fl:fternoon and only 11 6 yards, no touchdo-wns a:h.d two interc~p­ tions.

The Dutchmen opted for the . fieldgoal, which would have given them a 13-point lead. Ruffo's kick was blocked and recovered by Coast Guard, who then ran in for a touchdown. The play was whistled over back in the endzone,however, with fhe officials saying the ball was dead after ·being in the endzone. Although it was a ques- tionable call, it gave the Bear's the ball o~ their 20-yard line.

As Mills noted, \I give a lot of props to the line, they opened I.!.P a lot of holes. We came back from a disap- pointing loss and played with class this week.\ Mills, who tends to line up about eight yards behind the line of scrimmage, says, \It gives the offensive line a chance to open up a hole and gives me a chance to build up speed.

Tyson Returns to the Ring with a Bang After Two Years by Vinod Volcti Staff Writer 11·~ l)<.:~:n uHr tv.u year!:> sin(c \I ike T_y::.on • s boxing license was 1 n.okt.:J by the Federal Boxing Association after the famous \bite fight.\ The box.ing champion was disqualified after biting Evader Ilulyfit:ld's cars in their fight on June 2&. 1997 at the MGM Grand Garden. Every boxing fan across the cottntry was left with a huge quest! on in their mind: \Will Tyson ever be allowed to fight again?\ Mcunwhile, the news and other media l1ad a field day with this display of preposterousness, as they t<lok many shots at not only Tyson's reputation, but ais.o at b(ning \s r~putation as a whole. Some of the many jokes abottt Tyson and Holyfield were as follows: '\Ear today, gone tomorrow,\ \Evander's new name is Evander ·the real meal' Holyfteld,\ and \Holyfield is dtangi ng his name to Evan \'Gogh\ Despite all the negative media attention, Tyson has managed to get back on his feet after his boxing. license ....vas renewed. On Saturday night, however, his bout against Orlin Norris, whtch was supposed ro be tlle first of a series of fights that wo1tlrl attract a huge amount of atte11tion to boxing, proved to be yet another blow below the belt to the sport. The first, and also last, round of the bout was filled with a plethora of hard-hitting punches delivered to Norris by Tyson. It was clear that Tyson was out to show Norris and the world that he was back, and ready to take on anybody. Almost an instant after the bell rang signaling the end of the first round, Tyson delivered a hard punch to right above Norris·s right eye. The unexpecting Norris fell to the ground awkwardly, and em- braced his knee. After several min- utes of examination, it was ·decided that the fight could not go on. and a \no contest\ was declared. After the fight, Tyson accused Norris of having faked the injury to both further ruin his boxing repu- tation and to chicken out of the fight. \Anyone who's a boxer or anyone who's a competitor of any sort, whether it~s sports or busi- ness, if you're able to continue, you continue,\ Tyson argued. \Against Bu'ster Douglas, I could have quit any time, but I took my beating like a man.\ Though Norris was able to walk off the ring unaided and though there was no significant amount of swelling, doctors on the site pointed out that Nonis could still be in great deal of pain. The re- sults of an M RI on his knee showed that the joint popped out of its socl<et when Norris fell, and then popped back in when he at- tempted to get up .. Physicians claim that Norris must have su.ffered a lot of pain from the injury, alJ.dwill most likely have to undergo sur- gery to prevent additional occur- rences with his knee in the future. At the moment, It still stands that Tyson's late hit was unintentional, and that ile did not mea11 to hurt his oppoaent in any way. Even the injured Norris acknowledges that, \I honestly feel Mike did not fou] me intentionally.\ After it was established that there was no way that Norris could have beenfaking.his injury,hewas .· paid his $800,000 for doing tlie fight. Mike Tys-on's $8.7 milliorr dollars, however., will not be paid until af- ter Thurso<lay or Friday, when the Federal Boxing Association Com- . mission ~ill review the .t2pe and make a decision. ·Elizabetl• D~igle/GP Tyson is scheduled to fight Sh- .

by be or at to i Sports Women.'s Soccer Seeded First in .States by Meridith Chace StajfWriter The Union eoHege Women'·s Soccer Team brought their regalar season' to a close. with two viet()• ries this past week. Union annilii- lated Rassell Sage on October 2(), 7 ..:.0 and won a tough 5-l contest against Middlebury on Saturday. Sam Ryan got things started for the Dutchwotnen against Russeol Sage with a with her first of two goals, which was assisted l:ly Stephanie Maychack. KatieSmithputUnion up by two just a minute later on a pass froru Carrie Price. Lauren Byrne tlren connected with Missy MatuseVIicz to make the score 3-0. Ryall tl1en came up with her second goal oi the game on an Abby Harris as- sist. Nori Lupfer scored with just over a miimte left in the halfto give the Dutch women a comfortable 4- 0 lead going into halftime. The goal was assisted by Julie Cardettino. 'In the second half, Union saw two more goals from Matusewicz and Smith, with assists' from Smith and Maychack. The fmal score was 7-0. Shann~on Powers, Sara Donohue, and Carolyn Stead ma<ie the group effort in net and are ac- credited with the shutout. Union outshot Russel Sage· by the hu,ge margin of 20-2. They clearly domi- nated the contest. Coach Brian Speck thought that the game was, \ a great opportu- nity for everybody to get a lot of playing time. We had close games against Wil.liam.-Stnith and Williams wliere not ev()ryone got the <;hance to play.\ On October 23, Union emerged victorious fu. a. hard-fought battle agains;t Mhldlebury CoUege. In tbe second half Lauren Byrne and Abby West both had goals. Byrne had two assists as well Matusewicz found the back ofthe net on:ce again for the hat trick, her second of the season. effortofthe yea:r; We needed a big win like this,_andeveryone who did play, played well.\ Beating Middlebury certainly m.ade a statement, since Middle-- bury beat Williams, who had File Photo Sophomore Ccrrrie Price leads her team past the Russell Sage defense. Union did not score until a Matusewicz ,goal late in the first half. Matusewicz followed her own goal only secondslater to make the score 2-0 at halftime. Goalkeeper Powers was chal- lenged in this game as she came up with some very big saves. Jaymee Wilson also played well. Speck said, \This was the best team beaten Union last week, 3-2, in overtime. Mattrsewicz' s three goals in this contest put her over the 1 00-po:int matk with 106 points. She iii! the first Union player to achieve this and has done so in only three years. Matusewicz now has 43 career goals and 17 assists. Since the Middlebury game was the last home game for the seniors, five of the seniors started the game. Those who started were Powers, Harris, Ryall, Elizabeth Fisher, and . J aymee Wi.fson. Sarah Cardulio, a senior who has been injured for the entire season also got the oppor\ nmity to step onto the field dur- ing the game. Assistant Coach Liz Schmidt is also a senior who started her first· two years, then became an assis- tant coach after a career-ending injury. She has since contributed to the team immensely and. will be missed by her players. Another senior who has made her presence known for four years is Jen Capalbo, who played her first two years then became manager to fmish out her career. All of these- . niors have contributed to the team for four years. Union has been seeded first in the UCAA playoffs and will face Keuka College at home some time this week. They have to wait until Sunday night to. find out if they received an NCAA bid. The way the tournament is set up, it looks as if Union could get another shbt at Hamilton, whom they tied in over- time earlier this season. Speck is looking forward to another chance to beat them. Overall, the team's focus for the remainder of the sea- son is to win states and hope that they receive a bid to the NCAA Tournament. Siena No Contest for the Dutchman Ruggers by Will Johnson Staff Writer While overcast skies and t1i.e blusteJ;y winds on Saturday were. enough to drive mere mortals ba.ck to the cozy confines of the bed- room, the Men's Rugby Cll!b braved both wind and rain to lea:ve the field victorious after ei:ghty grueling minutes of rugby. A loss would have left the Dutchmen winless in six games this season. True, the playoffs were but a clis- tant memory. Yet Union was not about to be. upstaged 011 theii home turf. As Union kiCked off to begin,. they wasted no time at all deliver- ing the flrst hit. Union certainly set the tone of the game early with their panishing defensive play. The pack thwarted any attacks from the Siena f9rwards, and the Union line completely smothered . the weaker Siena backs. As a result of this aggressive play, the fltst 20 minutes of the game were spent deep in Siena ter- ritory. Despite the strength ofthe attack, and despite the nwner()US charges within the five meters oi the try ione, tb.e Union attack would lose possession or incu:r a penalty at inopportune momettts., resulting in a 0-0 score late in. tlle frrsthalf. Bring Home First Win of the Season · J:Iowever, this changed quickly when scrumbalf Will \Willie J\ Johnson gave the Dutchmen great field position 1vith an amazing run in which he br<Jke ten tackles- Later in th~ possession, he fed big Dave Doser with a nice weakside pass off of a ruck Doser did the rest of the work, as be stomped over and ·through a pebified Siena winger, and then jukedthe fullback to score Union's firsttiy. Jon \Iron Knuck- les\ Jones b()oted the conversion to give Unioathe early advantage, 7-0. Off ofthe eJlsaing kickoff, how- ever, Siena was able to pressure Union enough to force the Dutch- men deep into their own territory. The favorable field position, coupled wit:h Union ·s handling er- rors. due to tile wet conditions, gave Siena anopportunitytopush in a try on the last play of the half, making the score 7-5. The secondhalf saw the Union fifteen come out a bit· flat. Siena capitalized on Union handling er- rors, and penalties. The wet con- ditions gave· Union trouble all game, but pamcularly durillg the frrst 20 minutes of the second half. Union was still able to neutralize any Siena th:reat with success in line outs and some suJ.'!)risingly competent booking from Josh \R.U.I.\ Peterson. Perhaps most importantly, Union did not miss a tackle all afternoon. Defensive stal- warts Derek \Brown Cow\ McCowin and Mike Nigro led the charge for the pack and line, re- spectively~ Steve Flaherty tied up their weak side all day, although his most im- pressive feat of the day was refer- eeing the B-side game without a whistle. Defensive replacement Evan Jahn taunted his opposing wing, saying, \Bring on the con- tact, I'm wearing a mansserie!\ But the penalties and turnovers eventllally put Siena right down on the Union try line. A developjng goal line stand was thwarted, how- ever, by the referee, who awarded a phantom try. His poor judgement notwitl!standing, Union was fac- ing a l 0-7 deficit with l 0 minutes left, Union, however, had saved its best for last. Although three pre- vious tries had been called back due to questionable forward passes, Jones set the stage for an- other with a deep kick into Siena territory. Another Union knock~on gave a scrumdown to Siena, but Peterson made a valiant effort and stole the ball, giving possession to Union. Johnson then Wicorked a perfect pass to Jones, who, running at top speed, surprised the unprepared Siena defenders. A meter short of the try line, Jones placed the ball down for a ruck, where McCowan grabbed the loose ball and plunged over for the winning score. Jones added the conversion for good measure, and Un.i()n was ahead for good, 14-10. And that's all she wrote. Union, 0-5 to this point, :had pulled off the upset. After the game, Union was high spirited. Coach Jaco Visser remarked: \You guys won? No, c:J.Uit joking.\ So concludes the Dutchmen's wild season. The team thanks its fans for their support, and we also we would like to thank coaches Jaco 'Th.e Visser\ and Simon \The Fire Hydrant\ Morris. The team would also like to wish the Women's Rugby Team good luck in the playoffs this weekend.

Swimming an,d Diving Teams Prepare for A Promising Season New Faces and Seasoned Vetera·ns Provide a Favora.ble Mix by Lauren Wander and Tbatcber Woodley Contributing Writers As the days ·become shorter, the leaves turn colors, and the weather gels cooler, 45 athletes are starting their swim season. Training since October 4, the Union College Men's and Wo1nen's Swim Teams are geuring up for their first meet on Saturday, November6. The teams expect to be ex- tremely competitive this year not only because (){all the returning talent that they have, but also be- cause of the large freshman class that has added to their depth. Returning seniors and captains of the Swimmi11g Dutchwomen, Kerry Librandi and Clewis Kinnett, already feel that the team can bet- ter its respectable fourth place fin- ish in last year's State Meet. In that meet Librandi placed fifth in the 500 freestyle and sixth in the 1650 freestyle. This was accom- panied by her co~captain Kinnett's two seventh place finishes in the 200 and 400 [ndividual Medleys. Since the women's team only graduated one senior last year, diver Shontel Meachem, but gained five swimmers: Lissy Grace, Sara Hamilton, Anna Sluzat, Chrissy Vargas, and Lauren Wan- der, and two divers: Beth Fuller and Brinlt:y Mooney. Everyone anticipates an exceptional year.

There are two new assistant swim coaches this year to help head C{)ach Judy Wolfe with her s.wimmers. George Marshall, also a New York State Trooper, has joined the team as an assistant i.n his first coaching job. He has been warmly welcomed and accepted by both teams. His knowled:,ge and energy will benefit the team greatly. Eric '\Bugs\ Nathanson has joined tb:e team as the other assis- tant coach. Since he swam on the team last year, he knows all ofthe uppercla~smen and can therefore bring some more personal knowl- edge to the pool during practice and at meets. Next weekend will be a huge test for both 1eams. Even though the annual Union Relays is a fun, low~ pressure way to start the sea~on, it will give the coaches and cap- tains a good idea of how the swim- mers, esp:ecially the freshmen, are going to swim this year. Coach Wolfe is \very excited about the future of the swimming and diving teams here at Union. It seems that everyone just keeps improving.\ The Ullion Relays will be held at Union C()llege on November 6 at Alumni Gym. The races will start at 1:00 PM, and the competiton will i.nclude a number of Division III teams frorn all over New York and New England. Come and support the Swimming and Diving Teams as they C()tnmence their season in what has traditionally been a fun and exciting :meet. Student sup- p~rt is greatly appreciated.
