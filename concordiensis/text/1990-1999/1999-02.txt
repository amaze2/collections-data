Preventing Assault- The best defense against assault of any kind is to avoid situations where you are vulnerable. Here are a few sugg~stions: • Choose settings for social activities very carefully. The proximity of other people heightens your safety, but does not guarantee it. • Do not walk alon.e at night, travel with friends. Use the safety escort service when alone. When ~alking, keep to familiar, well-lighted and well-traveled areas. . • • • • someone where you are going and when you expect to return . key in hand and ready to unlock your door . ~ keep y()ur door locked. ;..:....:::;=residence hall doors to strangers.

To further illustrate his point, Jackson indicated that the state of New York spends l.SbiUiondol'- lars a year on the upkeep of tmi- versities and 1.8 billiondollarsQn maintaining prisons. To put that number into per~pec­ tive, five. students could attend a state university for one year for the cost ofkeeping one prisoner in jail forthe same amount of time. After a long pause, Jackson stressed that we; as a nation, need to refocus our energies to more pressing problems. Fifteen 'hun- dred Atnericansdieeachday from cancer. That same amount died in -the sinking ofthe Titanic. Americans spend hours and hours pondering the tragedy of the Titanic and watching movies that depict it, when an actual tragedy ha,ppens .everyday with the death of fifteen hundred cancer victims. · After a period of silence, Ja~k­ son rhetorically asked tbe crowd, '\Why can't we refocus our ener- gies to finding a cure for cancer rather than spending money on prisons?\ Jackson also stressed that it is time to level .the playing field. \As I watched the Super Bowl with President Clinton the other day, I noticed that blacks and whites played together. The focus ofthe game was on team color not skin color. Blacks could root for white players to tackle. the Bronco's tight end, Shannon Sharpe. White fans could support ablackman inhopesthathewould sack the Atlanta quarterback, Chris Chandler. How can this be?\ Jackson paused and then re- spond~d to his own question. \It is because the playing field in sports is even. The rules are -pub .. lie. Because of this, we can move · to the next level.\ Once the playing field is even, we can all move forward toward equality. If the-rules are known and theyare the same for every Ameri .. can, we can reach our dream of a better society. \If a white quarterback only had to attain eight yards fora fll'St down while a black quarterback had to get ten yards, the game would not ·be fair. We can use that analogy in life. Life should be an equal play~ ing field.'' Jackson then shifted the momen- -tum·ofhis speech. Words became louder. Silences became -longer. The message was stronger. \I worked for Martin Luther King; Jr. He was a passionate man whose goal was to dismantle walls and replace them with bridges. He wanted to change the way the world worked to make it beneficial to mote ofthe population.\ Jackson continued by saying, \His work can be seen as a sym- phony. The first segment ended slavery. The second ended legal segregation.\ He paused for a moment before continuing, \The right for a1l · American citizens to vote was the third movement Of the symphony. Dr. King unfortunately did not achieve the last part because he contilllledfrom page·J· Jackson holds a sign acknowledging a local group. waskilled before he could accom- plish it.\ That is wheretoday'sAmericans enter the picture. It is time for us to dismantle the walls that surround our races at1d ethnic groups. By allowing th()se who have little ac- cess to tbe wealth of capitalism the opportunity to improve their eco- nomic status, the nation will be- come a more equ~l society. Jackson entertained a pregnant pause before beginning his next topic, BlackHistory Month, which is why he visitedUnion atthistime. \Whites think that Black History Month is an esteem building time for African Americans. But, it is not justforBiack:people. The informa- tion that we 1eam during this time is not only J>art of American his- tory, but also world history. We need to move beyond color and culture.\ Jackson paused and then force- fully repeated, \We need t() move beyond color and culture. We can- not put our responsibility ofciti- zenship-on hold. The time is now. Changes. need to be made in out society.\ Before answering questi<ms Jackson stressed a few more points. He asked the audience to register to vote because, without doing that, our voice will not count. One cannot complain about the state of the Union if he does not vote for the changes that could be implemented when he votes in an election. After a lorig, standing ovation, Jackson allowed the media a chance to ask questions of .him. Most questions centered on his views of the Impeachment Trial and his opinions of the President and his past actions. Jackson otfered informationandattempted torefer back to points he made in his speech. One journalist askedifhe was ru1111ing for President in 2()00. Jackson claimed that he has:ll<Jt yet decided what t<J do about tlt.e up· coming election. \Even if I do not run for Presi· dent of the-United States, I am de· tenninedto help build a bridg~ fr-()111 the wealthy citi:zens of Americat<l the poor ones. 1 have decided t<J set the pace and the agend.a ft>r 2000:\ He continued, ~·r do not n~~ci t<J announce this early because l am already well k.now:n.\ Concordiensis then asked illim what he thought college students could dD ·t() achieve a better, 111ore racially equal society. He indicated that our generation neecls to broaden our sensitivity and expe- riences to apprec-iate the lives of those wilD are less fortunate; We need to fi:ght for legislation that will make the playing :field equal for our peers. He also l'e- minded the audience that we can- not look down llpon another incH- vidual because of his ecolJO!l]ic misfortunes. Jacksol! emphas.ized, \EveryoJJe is aided by someone.\ Jackson conclu-<led by saying, ••Life willgive each of us a c.hance to change the world. We have many opportunities to make acon- tribution.\ \Smart \)eople VI' ill make it. leach your children to be smart and t() h~ve character because wl!en a storm ofJ ife comes unexpectedly, they need to be prepared.\ Baroque Dance Company Offers Lessons to Students by Sofia Mazo C011tributing Writer \Welcome to Versailles!\ was the · greeting that opened The Splen- dor ofBaroque Dance Concert <ln Friday, January 22 in Memorial Chapel. The Ken Pierce Baroque Dance Company performed in pe- riod costumes to authentic music, and tnose who entered Memorial Chapel that evening left with -an indelible image of a royal Baroque ball. For those not familiar with the term, Baroque is a time period en- compassing the J71h andhalfofthe JSd• centuries. Baroque dancing originated in the French Court of Louis IV and featured dances such as the minuet, the gigue, and the courante. The concert was comprised of perfonnances by four dancers and three musicians. It was surprising to watch the movements of the two dancing couples, for they were so different from our perception of dancing. The men, dressed in long wigs and skirted suits, were seen to move with the same elegance and grace as the ladies. The foot- work of both parties was very in- tricate, consisting of small steps, light jumps, and quick turns; yet all reflected the symmetry and ci- . J~!~~1hat is so characteristic to Baroque style. Whether one per- son, one couple, or both couples perfonned the dance, there were mirror images and patterns in the dancers' expressive body move- ments and their positions on stage. Of course, instead of studying the patterns, many chose to focus en the gorgeous billowing gowns of the female dancers. Company director and choreog- rapher Ken Pierce performed two character pieces. In \Chaconne d' Arlequin,\ Pierce acted as a sprightly clown in a bright check- ered costume. His more serious role was in \Entree d' Apolon,\ where he, in a feathered hat, was the Sun King himself. It is understandable how this style of dancing may seem pecu- liar, especially after watching \Chaconne.\ In this. moderate dance, a male dancer Bruce Rob- erts appeared in what today would be regarded as a dress, a short dress ... So guys, if a nobleman of Frencil Court pranced in silk stock- ings and bow-tie shoes, you can certainly get in touch with· your feminine side. However, if a part of the audi- ence could not relate to Baroque dance, the divine music of the con- cert was sure to have touched ev- eryone. Rich, deep sounds of viola da gamba (a precursor to the cello), harpsichord, and violin penneated the chapel, soothing its listeners with beautiful melodies and trills. Peter Sykes, the harpsichordist, gave an amazing solo performance of\Vo' far guerra\ by William Ba- bel. After such a production, one might wo11:der-how can we be sure these dances are exactly those danced by the nobility over 300 years ago1 Ken Pierce was able to study and reconstruct the dances based on notations systems devel- oped in Fra11ce during the late 17th century, as well as on treaties de- scribing overall style and specific dance steps. And if anyone is still skeptical, the company even con- ducted a ch-emical analysis of the surviving sh()es in order to make a more !lCCurate replica. The Ken Pierce Baroque Dance Company was founded in Boston in 1987. Its members have appeared in festivals from Vancouver to Copenhagen and performed with prestigious music ensembles such as Tafelmusik.

EliZfZ,eth Rosner Reads Poetry that Expresses Pain of Holocaust by Monic:aGreenman Contrib11.ting Writer Students and vrofessors were hosted on Wednesday night when Hillel, the IsraeliCulture Club, the History Depatement, and the Womyn's Union sponsored poet- ess Elizabeth Ros11er. Ms. Rosner, a native of Schenectady, flev.r back from the wannth of California to the cold of New York to give a different per- spective on a commonly discussed topic, the Holoca11st. As a child of Holocaust survi- vors, she reminded the audience that the Holocaust was not a local- ized incident, and its ramifications are apparent everywhere and throughout past ~enerations and those that are yet to come. Ms. Rosner held the audience captive with her poems, which told her story and the s;t()ries ofher par- ents, who were f()und to be in- · trigued listeners in the audience of students and faculty alike. Ms. Rosner eloq11ently and pas- sionately read a selection of poM ems from her Gravity collection ranging from her feminist side, her mother's ability to speak seven languages, to the nightmares her father experiences. She began her reading with a poem titled \Broken Glass,\ which dealt with some of the animosity and anger that sh.e felt as a child growing up. The poem that had the most powerful message and meaning was titled \Disobedient Child.\ Not only did the audience be- come engulfed in her dramatic read- ing and the words that expressed her fiustration, but it could also be seen on paper how angry the emo- tions in this poem were. The poem itselfhad little punctuation and was written as one large paragraph, showing the continuity of her an- ger and ·emotions. Her father's story, \Archives was also emotionally portrayed through her poetry. He was in an orphanage with his brother when the Nazis came t<> collect the Jewish children f()r Kindertransport. Every child in th.e orphanage was taken to Auschwitz except for Mr. Rosner and his brother. The orphanage director kept the two boys claiming that because they were Romanian citizens they did not need to leave the safety <>f the orphanage. However, in 1944 Mr. Rosner was transported to Buchenwald, where he stayed until the camp was liberated. In the year 2000, Ms. Rosner and her father plan a trip to Ham- burg, Germany to further investi . .\ gate the orphanage director wh() helped him, when his documents are reopened for public viewing from their secJet vault. Ms. Rosner's mother was fortu- nate enough to have escaped the · camps because a peasant family kept her and her family in hiding from the Nazis, thus protecting them from the nightmare of the camps. After the war Mr. Rosner met his family in Sweden, and later met Mrs. Rosner at a Swedish Univer- sity Shabbat service. The Rosners moved to the United States, still fearing Euro- pean anti-Semitism, and hoping for a more positive future in America. The history ofMs. Rosner's par- ents is not an uncommon story, but it is unique to them. These in<lividual experiences in- fluenced the manner in which Ms. Rosner was raised, and the person who she is today are reflected in her work. The specialness in her work was not only the content, but also the manner in which it was written, be- cause she used colloquial terms. After Ms. R.osner finished read- ing she-entertained questions, that varried from her Jewislmess to in- fluential poets. The warmth and sincerity that Ms. Rosner displayed enabled the audience to feel what she was feel- ing, and to understand (in some small way) what her parents went through. Her poetry emphasized the long- lasting effects that the Holocaust has on those involved. property in that area.

The artist who perfonned was Arnaldo Cohen, a native of Brazil, who is world-renowned for his musical talent. His career began its climb to fame after he received first prize in 1972 at the Busoni In- ternational Festival. He has been acclaimed by crit- ics of the New York Times and New York Post for his technique and uniqueness in playing music. In addition to his career as a con- cert pianist he has talent in play- ing the violin and was once a con- cert violinist in Rio de Janeiro. The concert began at around 3: 15 in the afternoon and ended ·at 5:00pm. There was a good attendance for the performance, although this consisted of very few Union Col- lege students. Cohen played music from a vari- ety of composers, beginning with Debussy's \Images (Book I),\ and Chopin's \Ballade No.4 in F minor, Op.52\ \Three Etudes\ an~ \Scherzo No. 1 in Bmirtor, Op.20.\ Following these pieces there was a brief intermission, and then Cohen continued with Schumallll' s \Arabesque inC m~or, Op. 18\ and finished with Liszt's\ Sonata in B minor.\ This was truly an amazing per- formance. Cohen brought ·to life each piece he played, with gusto, tranquility, articulation and great skill. A round of applause followed each set he played. At the end of the concert, the audience was overjoyed by his show and dem- onstrated this by giving Cohen a standing ovation, which he came out onto the stage ~ice for. He will continue touring in North America, with his next stop in New York City. This concert was part of the Schenectady Museum-Union College 1998-99 concert series. The next group to perform in this series will be the Padua Chamber Orchestra, on February 8 at 8:00 pm in Memorial Chapel. This group is considered to be one of Italy's most famous en- sembles. Union students will only be charged $8 admission. Students should take advan- tage of these enriching opportuni- ties on c~mpus. . ' < '

Mon._na . · ·Staff Writer · On Tuesday, January 26, over 40 students and faculty crowded' into Bailey 207 to bear the second talk in the Lakes and Environmental Change seminar series. Given by Dr. Peter Tobiessen, Professor of Biology, the talk was called \Bac- terial Ecology: From Oceanic Depths to Ballston Lake.'' It focused mainly on bacteria, tiny organisrns those people cll!Tently suffering from colds are all too. fa- miliar with. Or perhaps not. Tobiessen started out by stating, \OK here's .some basic bacteriol- ogy. Bacteria are more than patho:- gens; these are only a very small percentage of all the bacteria that. exist.. It's the bad ones that are more famous. Most bacteria do a lot of good things.\ This distinction made, Tobiessen explained that it is difficult to discoverdifferentspe- cies ofbacteria. Basically, bacteria are identified ifthey grow and sur- vive on a petrie dish. \Imagine if we did this with humans,'' Tobiessen began seriously. \Say these giants aliens came from outer space and put Peter and Joanne Tobiessenon a petrie clish w.ithlac,.. tose. Now I would survive, hut Joanne, being lactose intolerant~ would die. The aliens would as .. sume we were different specie~. even tltough we actually caren,i. The. ~tpne thip.g hc;tppen.s ~~t\ll?ac .. teria.'; Tobiessen concluded the exampleby explafuing thatbflcteri- ologists use physiological differ- ences to determine different spe· cies. Tobiessen continued by giving an overview of bacteria. Bacteria are very simple organisms called prokaryotes. These are the earli- est fonns of life known to have ex- isted, and have been evolving for billions of years-long before any complex. organisms formed. Prokaryotes are found in every liv- ing thing~ as they are what formed into the mitochondria and chloro- plasts tlut provide animal and plant cells with energy. How did prokary- otes develop into these more com- plex organisms, known as eukary- otes? Simply, they were assimilated into the larger cells. So while eu- kmyoteshavebeen developing for only 600 million to maybe a billion years~ prokaryotes like bacteria have been evolving for two to three billion years. C().urtes:y Ben 'liarver Profossor Gremi/lon and Marie Maurer sample water:. Tobiessen then briefly ex- plained how microorganisms are divided .up based on how they get energy. The talk focused heavily on photoautotrophs and chem.:aautotrephs. Autotrophs do not need an external food source, and develop their own energy in- ternally. Photoautotrophs use light to do this, and chemoautotrophs use chemicals. Actually, we owe photoautotro- phs a lot. As they evolved, their internal reactions would take car- bon dioxide, water and light and produce energy and~ most impor- tantly, oxygen. '~There wasn't.much oxygen in the atmosph,ere back then,\ Tobie.~s.en. expia~e,d, ~·~qtnis .re- lease of it was very traumatic. Many anaerobic o:t;ganisms were killed by the oxygen, which was really the frrst great world pollu- tion.\ Now, of coyrse, all living organisms rely on ox.ygen in order to exist. Nitrogen is another compound important to life. Bacteria in the soil and water fix nitrogen so that it could be used in amino acids, which developed into proteins. \Actually Tobiessen ex.plained, \when glaciers recede, plants with nitrogen-fixing bacteria are the ones that can survive and fix show up in the area. Alder trees and Azdla ferns are two primary ex- amples ofthis.\ The conclusion: the nitrogen cycle is actually driven by species of bacteria. Or it used to be, until humans came along. With fertilizers developed from ammonia, humans now fix more nitrogen than the entire bio- logic community, \Which may have many implications, but we won't go into those,\ T()-biessen . said. . Tobiessen continued by-,talking about some of the useful things bacteria can and have d()ne re- cently. For example, bacteria can be used in bioremediation. Bacte- ria in blue-greenalgae haveagreat affinity for phosphorous. The Exxon Valdez oil spill was ~ctually cleaned up once they sttpple- mented the oil with phospltorous and nitrogen. The bacter:ia blos- somed and removed the ali. An issue close to home invoh'ed. the dechlorination of PCB·~ in the Hudson River by GE.

'J.. · : ,·, \so who, s right?;' some{t~e ·D:6ril the audience asked. \Welt~ they 'both are,\ Tobiessensaid,IJlomen- . tarily confusing all of us_ '•The . bacteria do dechlorinate~ l>ut only up to a point. The bacteria llo re- move the PCB's with highchJorine concentrations;- They aren't at- tnicted to those with low alrtll()unts. So some are removed, and ()thers remain.\ Tobiessenalso e\-pla.ined how GE had the idea of ge11etically engineering a \super bacteria\ to break down PCB' s. \Whiclt\WoUld be a great idea until it g{)lt into everyone's gas tanks,\ he finished to laughs. To give us an idea of the effects bacteria have on water, scientists assay water, loo~ing Itt the collarform bacteria present. Tap water should only have one ()r two colonies per million, or less., to be considered \safe.\ Water for swimming c:an only have up to 100 colonies per million. Tobiessen then showed tts two cultures oflocal water. One was a sample of Schenectady tap water, which· contained no <:olonies, \thank·God!\ The other bad prob* ably thousands Qfcolonies, \Any• one know where this came from?\ Tobiessen asked, looking around the room. The shaking of heads prompted his response: \Would you believe from the 'brook that bounds through Old Union's grounds'? It's fram Hans Grout Kill.\ Some ~f the aadience was generally surprised, while others nodded their heads. Tobiessen amused the crowd by relating a story from a few years ago ofhow the brook overflowed its banks and many students had a great time, as it was spring. \Be- ing a 'biologist, I took some samples, and when I analyzed them, they had probably two hundred thousand cultures per million. The moral ofthe story-enjoy floods in the Garden from a distance.\ Switching on the slide project he brought, Tobiessen llloved to- wards the center of the talk. \OK everyone is familiar with plate tee- . tonics~ right? The drifting of the continents? Well,\Tobiessen ex- plained, \this creates cracks in the Earth's crust beneath the water.\ Water seeps down ami mixes with the hot magma, creating streams of dark colored heated seawater that shoots up out of the cra.::ks. These are called\smokers and are basically thenn.al vents. The irit~restiirg pari? Scientists :have found a very isolated, dense com- munity ·exi~tirtg\itto\!n'd 'th'1{se vents. There'are ll·inchcrabs, vali- ous kinds of.fish, and W()rms that measure two to tlrree meters(up to nine feet!), among others, surviv- ing in an area totally devoid of light. Slides of the:se critters brought many exclamations from the audience. But how do they survive in an area devoid oflight? Chemoautotrophic bacteria break down hydrogen sulfide to sulfur and re_duce carbon dioxide to oxy- gen for the community tC> use. This all happens many th<Jusands o.f feet beneath water level. Then, Tobiessen moved to the focus of the talk: Ballston Lake. •'Typically in the summer, the lake water is hot on top and cold on the bottom. A thermoclirne between three or four to eight meters resists mixing of the water,\ Tobiessenex- plained. The area beneath this layer can have a different compo- sition. Many bacteria i.n the deeper water result in less oxygen than the higher water. Then, in the fall, the temperatures drop and the waters mOC Except for one part of the lake. About twenty meters down, there is another layer, which Tobiessen called \achemoclime\. This layer contains many different chemicals, with a higher temperature and oxy· gen level beneath it. \So what?\ Tobiessen asks. \Well the chemoclime prevents mixing from ever happening. Even in the fall, water beneath it will not mix.\ This layer exhibits many interesting properties, which Tobiessen ex- plainedusing viewgraphs. For ex· ample, the temperature in the chemoclime remains constant throughout the year. Also, the water there increases in conduc- tivity. Those who have looked at the lake, including Union Profes· sors Rodbell and Garver of Geol- ogy and Gremillion of Civil Engi- neering, besides Tobiessen, aren't sure what's happening down there. The low levels of oxygen indi- cate the presence of many bacte- ria. Also, the area around the chemoclime has hardly any light. Much of the photosynthesis that occurs there is potentially done by bacteria, though Tobiessen stressed they \were unsure\ if this was exactly the case. \We're studying that this sum- mer.\ Also, \there are a lot of zorroplankton, filter feeders, down there who are very happy.\ So what's· gdlifig ''6n? _.,At· the chemoclime, there is a pure culture of some ·ba~teria~are- rliese chemoautotrophs? Tobiessen concluded with the question, \So do we have a small model of one .of those ocean vents right here in Ballston Lake?\ The talk concluded with a few individual que~t~o1,1s,. as most people had to leave for 1:30PM classes. Tobiessen gladly took his time to answer whatever questions people threw his way. All in atten- dance seemed somewhat amazed by the information he passed on, that bacteria could keep a whole community alive underwater. Didn't have a chance to attend this talk?

The ID card is now required in order to use many b()dy shaping tools, including aU dumb be_lls un- der 25 pounds. Last week, many ofthe cardiovascular machines in the gym were not working and times when everything is running properly, there is usually a long line in order to use a treadmill or an EFX machine. Why has the gym been so crowded in the past few weeks, and is ther:e a time when there are fewer lines in which to wait? What about the popularity of the new aerobics and yoga classes? These were some ·Of the ques- tions that influenced me to speak with the athletic department. The quest for the answers be- gan with Jason Bendekovic, assis- tant director of Intramu.ral and an assistant football coach. He in- formed me that the cdd weather during the winter brings large crowds into the gym. The cardiovascular machines run constantly from opening to closing time, six days a week. The weight room opens at noon and is exclusively opened to the Varsity football team on Monday~ and Fri- days from 4 to 6PM. The light- weight room is opened throughout the duration ofnormal gym hours, but is particular to ligtlter we!ghts. When asked about the mainte- nance of the equipment, it was ex- Paul D' Annibale/TC How safe is the gym equipment that you use? pressed that a Union student on work-study comes to wipe down all of the machines andre-rack the weights four times a week. Someone from the fieldhouse evaluates the machines once a week and ifthere is any major prob- lem, the company that makes the machines sends out a representa- tive to maintain the equipment. According to Bendekovic, \The cardiovascular equipment and the weight room were a big investment for the Intramural Department so it is important to keep them in good shape.'' The search for the truth ended ~r speaRdng.with BiltScim1on, di- rector oflntramural and the men's and women's tennis coach .. Safety is a big concern for the athletic de- partment. · This i~ the reason for the recent lock on the women's locker room door. There is no other way for the school t() regulate who enters the gym area because many students neglect to swipe their ID ''s at the front desk. This allows access to anyone for use of the facilities, including the basketball courts and the locker rooms. After an off campus male was repeatedly spotted within the women's shower area_,itbecame im- perative to fmd a way to success- fully increase gym security. Start- ing with the place where the viola- tion occurred was the only way to protect the women on campus .. Scanlon \knows it is-~ '·incon:~e~ nience, but it is worth it if it ends the problem.\ After speaking with a number of women students, it was found that many otlter people feel Professo.rs Lec:ture in India • ~ \' • • ; . • - 1' ... .1; I' - ' ' by Gina Campanella Staff Writer Union College has recently implemented a program to expand its student exchange with Mumbai, India. This past winter l>reak two of Union's professors participated in a one-week exchange to be guest lecturers at the university. The ex- change began as a student only exchange between Union College and Mumbai University. Five Union College students were studying at Mumbai f<lr a term. In return, two Mumbai Univer- sity students are currently study- ing at Union for a year. At the re- cent suggestion and invitation of Mumbai University, the exchange was expanded to include profes- sors. Since the university expressed a significant interest in women's studies, Professor Theresa Meade of the History department and Pro- fessor Sharon Gme)cb of the An- thropology department were se- lected to travel to India early in De- cember of 1998. They spent one week traveling and lecturing at four different col- leges associated with Mumbai University. Professor Meade lec- tured on Urban rioting in Latin America and in the United States. The lecture, titled Communal Riots in Urban Areas concentrated· on diffusing some of the extremely violent stereotypes that the Indian students have about racis~p and violence in the United States. Professor Meade pointed out that the Indian students are very interested in the United States; however, quite a few of their im- ages of our country tend to be slightly skewed. These misinterpretations are of- ten a result of such well-publicized occurances as the Rodney King beating and other significant and recent US riots. Professor Grnelch concentrated on-gender issues on campus in light of her recent book on the topic in her lecture, Gender on Campus: Issues for College Women. The stu· dents and the faculty at the women's college were especially interested in this issue since there is a much greater deal of gender separation in India than in the United States. Professor Meade emphasized the \very gender divided student body\. It was rare to .see women or men crossing into one another's field ofleaming. People who are going to school to become teachers of social sci- ences or humanities and current teachers of both subjects were overwhelmingiy female. Thus, this resulted in both professors lectur- ing t<;J a predominantly female audi- ence. Overall, both women agreed that the students they addressed were extremely interested in the United States and the US perspective on these issues. The University system in India is set up similarly to the British sys- tem. The women visited three dif- ferent colleges under Mwnbai Uni- versity; KC College, SNDTUniver- sity, and National College, a female college. One fmal college that the women were scheduled to visit was Jai Hind College was on strike, so it was taken off the agenda. There is anticipa- tion that another exchange of this kind will occur sometime in the fu- ture; however, Professor Meade re- grets that it will probably include a different variety of professors. In the spring Union College will be hosting Professor Mohini Diaz who will be teaching two courses here during spring term. These courses will be History of India and British Colonialism in Modern Asia. Professor Meade is highly anticipating this aspect of the exchange and wants to assure stu- dents that these courses will be well publicized. In conclusion, Professor Meade wants to emphasize the wonderful time that she had on her exchange and encourage more involvement in this program. the same way. In order for the system to wo.1k,itis important for each woman 1oreplaceher~ccess· card to the cageafter working out.

Scanlon has noproblems buying new equipment as long as it is taken care ()f, used by a number ofpeople, a11dle:ftwithin thegym. Students :m4;lke up 80-90% of the traffic illthe gym. Times the machines are most vacant are be- tween theho1.lfSof 12:30 and3pm. A wait sh()uld :be expected at most other times during the day and evening. Because the gym has been. so busy, it was a huge shock when four out of ·five treadmiUs and three out of fom; EFX ma(;hines were-not working. According to Scanlon, this was due toan electrical shortage in one maclline that tripped the g~hem~ (}itcu.it. breal{et~ , lt ~as since been taken care of, but there is still (}fle treadmill that has a problem in its computel'; thus displaying tile incorrect speed arid time. Why doesn;t the school .get some new· equipment, you may wonder? The school has leased all the cardiovascular machines for tllree years, a time period half-fin- ished. Scanlon had no idea which machines would be popular, so he bas been keeping track so, that when the time comes, he can pur- chase machinery that will receive ample use. This includes one less .stair stepper, and more sta,tionary bicycles and EFX machines. Space is .a problem within the gym; there. fore more treadmi Us would be hard 1o accommodate. The athletic department now of- fers five aerobics and two yoga dasses. They are all taught by cer- tified instruc~ors, two being stu- 4ents attending Ynion. This makes it very. convenient for classes to Jake place even in the snowy, un. manageable weather. The 10 dollar fee for the class goes to more than just a reservation of a spot and to- wards the salary of the instructor. \All the money from that fee goes back into the program,\ stated Scanlon. Lastterm, the Intramural department was able to purchase a microphone for the teacher, new mats and stair steppers, as well as an upgrade to the stereo system. The Alumni gym is opened from 8:30am u:ntil 9pm,. Mondays through· Fridays and from 12pm until 9pm on Saturdays ~nd Sun- days.

Successful Blood Drive by Roger McShane Contributing Writer On Febr11ary 19th an emer· gency blo()d drive was held in Davidson knmge. The event was sponsored by . the Sigma Chi &atemity. Over the past month 1h.e red Cross has had . to cancel a number of blood drives in Schenectady County due to the inclement weather. · . This created a great shortage in the blood su.pply for the area, making the Union drive all the more important. Over one hundred people signed up to give blood on this day. The red Cross was able to collect over 55 fresh pints of blood. The process consisted of an initial examination followed by the actual IJl()od giving, if you qualified to donate. After giving, cl.onors were treated gently because their bodies obviously went tbrough some serious.changes. All were offered cookies and juice to help them replenish the nutrients that they lost from giving blood. Junior Donor Andy Donohue claimed, ''I felt a. little dizzy initially but, the cookies and juice perked me right up ... they should do the same at fraternity parties.\ The complete process of donat- ing rarely took more than a half hour. In conclusion, the blood drive was a great success. All of the par- ticipants felt good about donating to such a worthy and necessary cause. The Red Cross and Sigma Chi would like to thank everyone for tbeir generosity. Would You Like to be an Orientation Advisor?

An Exploration ofthe American Slave Experience, which will be on dis- play throughout the Wi11ter Term. The exhibit is based on the book Twelve Years u Slave- The Kidncrpr ping, Enslavement und Re$c:ue uf Solomon Nol'thup, The panel consisted of profes- sor Margaret Washington of Cor11ell University, protessmCarol Wilson of Washington College. and professor Patrick Blair of Bowdoin College. All three panelists have done ex. tensive research about tlu~ lives of free blacks prior to the civil war. Wilson is the author of Freedom at Risk: The Kidnupping of Free Blacks in Ame1·ic:a 17S0-!865. The kidnapping offreeblacks is a topic that is not found in most Amel·ican history text books. yet this does not 1nean it did not oc- cur. The kidnapping and enslave- ment of Solomon Northup. a tl·ee, black man from Saratoga Springs is just one example. Wilso11 has personally docu- mented over 300 cases of free were kidnappefj .<~nd did not get away from tllose who captw·ed them.\ The other two panelists agreed that kidnapping was not and una common practice. Wash ingtoil' then addressed why and how kidnapping was able to occur. \The fugiti\e slave laws laid the ground worl\ for kidnapping,\ Washington stated. and ·'incred- ible racisn1 pl'ovided that the cui· prits \\-ere not brought to justice.\ Therefore, people did not rear arrest for kidrtapping free men. Wilson then added that \ironically anti-kidnapping was not put into law by Congressuntil after the Civil War.'' · According to Blair, \'Kidnapping had significance beyond those di- rectly atTecte~. It exposed the ten- sion in the United States: tl1e land of liberty vs. tl~e land of slavery.'' Freedom for- blacks was not a reality priortothe civil war. ''Blacks were not really· free because of the potential of kidnapping,\ Wilson remarked. During this period ''nobody was safe. Who was rnost endanger of being kidnapped if you were black? Children were ·the people H!liOS( likely to be kidnapped,\ Washing- • ton .stated. • ·Both Nt:v. Yllrk and \Nt:w kYsl'; were l'amous tor allu\' ing thi:dt> happen. .

After .the discussion, the panel acceptedquestions from the audi- ence. which also raised important issues. One issue was the possi- bility ofreparations for the fam i- 1 ies of kidnapped slaves. 1-1 istory professor AT. Miller then brought up the isstte of sla- very on the Union Colleg.c campus. He stated that. \the abolition- ist movement on Union began as a result of southerners wanting en- slav~d blacks brought on campus to se1·ve them and do their chores.''

AyatoUah Ruhollah Khomeini retumed to his country after being arrested in 1964 for organizing an opposition to the Shall, his retum ended the 15 years ofexi.le, and marked the beginning of the end of the Shah's power in Iran. Ten days .later the Shah's government was toppled and Iran was in tl1e hands of conservative Muslim clerics. On M0nday the government of Iran started a l 0-day celebration to commemo· rate the downfall of the Shah and the Islamic revolution's stunning takeover ofthe coun- try, which for decades had been tin anced b)' Western power and money. The relationships between the t\Vo coun· tries were strained at times but generally in- volved a US financing of an lrunian militalj' build-.up. One such example ofthi.sbuildup is that Iran is the only other country to oper- ate the F-14 Tomcat Intercept atrcr:aft. The buildup made Iran a viablemilitary force- one that caused _much ~rouf?h~ to tbe US during Khomeini's nJ{e, aud !lS a r~sult led to an American backing and arming of the Iraqi Anny to c.ou'!terbalance Uie threat. finaJ,Jy •. perh:apsone ofthe mQstmt:morable_ events ill US-Iran history was the treatment of the Slmh ir~ the Upited Stat~s toJ:\ c~mc~r despite caJis for his .deportation for trial to Iran.

Th.e magnitude·6quake killed 940 people and wounded upwards of3600. The quake left 200.000 people homeless in which half of t11e homeless are children. The emthquake struck westem Columbia at the epicenter in which. the death tolls are nighest in Atmenia. Pereira, and Calarca. It is reported that 70% ofAnnenia • s structures are destroyed due to the unrelenting power of the quake. Monday's quake was. not tbe end of tile tragedy. On Saturday. January 30, a l'nagnitude 4.3 aftershock was reported and more aftershocks were reported on Sun- day, in which the largest had a magnitude of 3.5. However, Sunday's aftershocks did not inflict fLuther damage on an already chaotic s itua tl on. The earthquake was the worst recorded since 1983. the earthquake had an epicen- ter nearthe town of Popayan and killed more than 300. Last Monday's earthquake was more powerful than the 1983 disaster. The magnitude of the earthquake makes rei ief efforts complicated. President Andrees Pastrana went to Am1enia on January 29 to help with the relief program. In a televised address he told the country that he. \will not rest u nti I [he] sees that the emergenc-y plan is working efficiently.\ The same da:y he announced 315 million doJiars in quake relief progran1s. Though Pr~sident Pastrana trie<l to aid relief effm1sthrough passing the economic aid package~ tile reliefeffort wasplagued by many prob lefl1!;. On~ of these probl·ems was a shortage of transportation. There are not enough truck.s to carry supplies to towns, which force 111ost towns to pick u.p aid on their own, Me11rpower is also a ptoblem. Fernando Medelin is the natimm:ldirector of the Solidal'ity NetW()rk, whid1 is a govem- ment aid organization. He points <JUt that, ;•we don't have 6()0 or 700 state officials to bring [aid]otltto the communities.~' towns are isolated bec-ause of a lack oftransporta- tion and matliJ()Wer~ Richard Trujillo is an aid worker in Armenia and believes that the relief effort is i!lefticient. Trujillo stated that towns are \oJ>erating as islands.\ Many sur- vivors of the·ea:rtl1quake are fr'Ustrated with the relief .effo;rt. One survivor.

They attribute any problems with the teliefeff<Jrtto themagnitudeofthe disaster. Foreigfl Min.ister Guillerll1o pointed out that, •'no '(!Ountry in the world Is ready to feed 200,0()0 people.'

Perhaps our little colle here in Schenectady is no comparison to a statewide sta·tlst:tca.ll evaluation, but after four years here we must face those afore- mentioned percentages and enter a workforce with a mixed popu- lation. How should we go from a predominantly uuJuu!;!.t:IIt:uu:sl classroom environment to a diversified office? At other small Liberal Arts Colleges in the US the numbers college enrollment by race and ethnic group were higher Wellesley, Trinity, Colgate and Hamilton. According to the Jour- nal ofBiacks in Higher Education, in 1996 Wesleyan Univers· had the highest number and largest percentage of black ., .. uu ..... in the freshman class of all the highest-ranked liberal arts college in the nation. Unimpressively, in 1971 Union College had 75 black students in the entire school and in 1997 and 1998 that ber was the same (the scary fact is that class sizes are now b than in '71). After 28 years of change in the world has remained caught in a time capsule, unable to :a\tyr the num that other institutions have been able to increase? · In a study of admission rates for the top Liberal Arts Colleges in which Union ranks about 30th, Union comes 8th in overall ac-. ceptance rate. In black acceptance rate Union falls to 18'h. is there such a big difference? The low levels ofblack first students as well as other minority students at Union is troubling. Union, located nearby to small institutions like Colgate, Trinity and Hamilton, should be far more successful in attracting minor ity students. Understandably the school has made a concerted effort to re- cruit more minority students over the pa~t four years. They introduced AOP, which provides various monetary for minority students. But even with this program, there is stil not a strong enough incentive for minority students to attends a predominantly and traditionally white college. After Jackson's speech, President Roger Hu U expressed discon- tent with a certain Editor-in-Chief's misstatement ofthe perceut- · age of minority students in the class of 1999. She said we have 2% minority in general, instead of specifically stating that there are merely 2% African Americans at Union. The actual min · for the class of 1999 is a mere I 0%. While this misstatement wrong on her part, Hull's reaction to the 8% difference was worse. Instead of listening to Jackson's response that was cifically addressed to the administration (i.e. Roger Hull), the presi- dent was too busy correcting the mistake, turning around in llis seat to defend the actual racial makeup of the College. Sadly enough, the number the president was defending is worthy of defense. Union College, with such small numbers acceptance and enrollment of minority students needs to reate11ne1 its priorities and listen to Jesse Jackson's advice: \We all must work to get the glass out of the wound heal-to make this a more perfect Union.\ SAS ·oP/ED Opinions Safety on Campus: A Dean's Perspective I write to add a new perspective to the current debate on campus safety. [t is not my intention to quibble over the numbers or grav- ity of incidents that have occurred on campus, but rather to affum that safety is a critical issue for every- one living and working in this community. Just as acts of cheat- ing, stealing or lying erode the trust that is necessary in a community, so too do threats to privacy and well being. The majority of crimes commit- ted on campus are in parking lots and open·areas. This is in no small part due ,to our location in a small city. To put this in perspective, Union suffers an average of $19,000 of vandalism in a year and Trinity College in Hartford esti- mates its figures as more than $90,000. The recent debate has focussed on residence halls and the gym, and that makes sense because when these violations come into the places we live, it is all the more unnerving. However, we currently have twenty-two buildings hous- ing students, excluding Wade- Lupe. There are twenty-eight dis- crete groupings within these build- ings; for example Sigma Delta Tau and Delta Gamma share a build~ ing, but require separate entrances; The various groups range from a low of 8 people to the 264 resi- dents of Davi.dson. The number ofhouses and groups will grow as we add residences on Lenox Road and Seward Place. People have suggested that we pat desk attendants back in resi- dences. Assuming we could main- tain one entrance would still have a formidable chal- lenge providing desk attendants. Just fmding qualified people who would want the job would prob- ably be prohibitive, and putting unreliable people in place creates a false sense of security. Some might argue that it is only neces- sary to put a desk attendant in one or two selected buildings, but this suggests that either some people deserve more protection or need more. No one can seriously sup- port the notion that safety is more important for some students than for others, and longer-term statis- tics tell us that disruptive students and guests are as likely to strike in Davidson, South, or West as in Richmond. Desk attendants are not the an- swer. We know from our past ex- periences that students found ways to cireumvent the system and that guards were not doing the job we hired them to do. Moreover, we were not giving equal coverage to all residents. Accordingly we made the switch to roving guards who cover well-defined areas. Given that most crimes happen .outside the buildings, the current .system of area patrols gives us the ability to provide coverage to all -campus residences and to be nimble enough to focus that cov- erage on problem areas. Should the Davidson parking lot experi- ence a series .of break-ins or Fox Hall a number of propped doors then we can respond appropriately. ~If I might have one quibble, the area patrol system does not save the College any money. This brings me to the main point. The Col- lege has to provide reasonable cov- erage by Campus Safety officers and appropriate services and sys- tems such as escort, proper light- ing, emergency response, courtesy phones and locks, and fire report- ing and inspectio11s. Students and employees are also partners in this effort. It is important that th.ey use the services appropriately. For example the escort service is for safety and when people use it as a taxi, they compr()mise safety. The same is true when people prop doors, let strange:rs into a building or loan their .keys to a .guest or friend. The partnership requires that we exercise good judgment and that we report situations that look suspicious or wrong. Union has a policy of treating students as responsible adults. Just as the College has a responsibility to make the campus as safe as pos- sible, stude11ts have a responsibil- ity not to undermrnc t~at system. In keeping with our eff0rts to keep the campus safe, President Hull, Director of CamiJus Safety, Will- iam Sickinger and I will be meet- ing with the leadership of the Stu- dent Forum to discuss ideas they have brought forth. Induded among their ideas is bringing a safety consultant to campus. We intend to do that in conjunction with an exploratLon of putting in a card access system .. Even a. card access system requires everyone's cooperation if it is ,going to work. I hope we can all work t,ogether to maintain a safe, campuSo;, Frederick Alford Dean of Stude~ts

Lind~ Cool Dean ofthe Faculty ( Oinu.corlliensis The Student Newspaper £Jf Union College Since 1871 Schenectady's Oldest Newspaper Term Abroad Committee Misses the Boat Stephaoie Slobotkin - Michelle Tham EDITORS-IN-CHIEF by Mark Higgins Contributing Writer I would like to shm:e with the Union community my incredible experience this past fall as a par- ticipant in the Semester at Sea (SAS) program sponsored by the University of Pittsburgh. I left Vancouver, BC on Septem- ber 10 with 650 other college stu- dents on an ocean voyage around the world. We traveled on the SS Universe Explorer, a beautiful cruise ship that had been retrofit- ted to accommodate a floating uni- versity. Our floating campus included classrooms, lecture halls, a com- puter lab, library, dormitory, rec- reational facilities, dining halls, a post office and a bookstore. Our first stop was Kobe, Japan which we reached on September 23, after 13 days at sea. While at sea we went to classes on a daily basis with a full schedule of 12 to 15 credits, enj eying the insight and expertise of faculty from 20 ma- jor universities including Harvard, University of California Berkeley, University of Michigan, and Penn State. The classes were interesting, small and enlightening. The close community of the ship (we all lived, worked and played to- gether), created an atmosphere where learning and personal devel- opment were enhanced. As we traveled from one port to another, Hong Kong was after Ja- pan, then Vietnam; we had a core curriculum subject taught on the next country we were going to visit. The class was taught by a pro- fessor from the country we were about to visit, who would join our ship for that leg of the journey. This core class required by all ship- board students would discus!; the cultural, economic, religious, po- litical and social issues pertinent to each country we visited. We spent five to six days in each country (we visited ten countries in all) and we had the opporto.nity to meet people of all social levels, an experience not typical of tE'adi- tional semester abroad programs. I note this particularly becaure half of our time was spent in third world countries which do not have the traditional exchange progruns with American universities. I crawled through the CU Chi Tun- nels of Vietnam, ate with h:ead- hunters in Malaysia. visited Mother Teresa's orphanage in In- dia, had coffee with Israeli border guards and shared gifts with gyp- sies in Turkey. This trip was a once in a life- time opportunity and I am so happy that I could take advaatage of it. I have made lifetime friends with students on the ship; students back at school now, attending Dartmouth, Yale, Stanford, M.I.T., University of Michigan, Cal State and San Diego State. I could tell you so much more about the Semester at Sea program, but I now understand that the Union College \Term Abroad Of- fice\ is not willing to allow Union students to participate in this })rD- gram. I am truly disappointed tllat other Union students will not have the opportunity t() experience this incredible journey. I have heard that the committee members have put down the Se· mester at Sea program because there is too much drinking on the ship (there wasn't) and, anyway, who's calling the kettle black? The Princeton College Review ranked Union in the Top 10 drinking schools in the entire country. They also dismissed the classes as \Mickey Mouse\ quality, yet I can emphatically state that the classes were well prepared anci of high quaJity and since we were on a ship, there was not much oppor- tunity to av()id class. I would strongly urge the T enn Abroad Office to reconsider tlleir position and allow Union students to participate in the Semester at Sea program. Over 200 colleges and universities were represe11ted by students on my voyage and most of tltese kids were there be- cause they heard about the pro- gram from an upper classmate who .. had participated in the program. I have experienced this phenom- enal opportunity first hand. My concern is how the Term A broad Office came totbeir fmal decision. Was it based 011 hearsay and ru- mor about the program or from the opinions of individuals who i:lctu- ally participated in the program?

Page 12 · February 4, 1 ''9 • armtenrmetusis Opinions Can One Die of Testosterone? by Eric Wisotzky Contributing Writer This weekend was the pinnacle of all chauvinistic, aggressive, 8Ild primitive male behaviors. A11d what an amazing weekend it was ! For me personally, my build up of testosterone was so strong, that a.t times I thought it was possible for me to die of testosterone overl()ad. I could feel the powerful hor- mone flowing through my veins. My tiny capillaries were expand- ing. The pressure was so rapidly rising that I thought all my blo()d vessels might burst. A few h()urs before Super Bowl XXXIII, I found myself so excited that I wa::; jumping into walls and tacklrng anyone who crossed my path. Bat oh no, it was not just the Super Bowl that made this weekend corn- plete. The festivities began on Satur- day night at one of the fine house~ in the Union College area. Thi~ particular house happened to be hosting some live entertainmen.t that evening, which involved tvvo scantily clad, yet very classy young ladies. These ladies performed S()rne thought provoking and poignan.t dance pieces, highlighted by the brilliant use of hot oil. Contrary to the stereotype of dance appre- ciators, this dance \recital\ was attended by all males. Never have I seen such enthusi- asm for dance amongst males. III fact, these males were so excited by this form of dance that ma.n)' offered several dollar bills tore- ward these dancers for their te~t­ ents. One premedical student, in fa.ct, seemed so moved by the perf()r- mance that he became entranced and was observed t<J occasionally twitch. The testosterone le(lel continued to grow the next day, from the most important holiday of the year, the Super Bowl. While I was not particularly in- clined toward either team, a friendly wager wi111 a friend of mine increased the stakes in this game. Fortunately for myself, my end of the bet was favoring the Denver Broncos. Well, of course, we could n()t simply watch the gmne. Prepara- tions needed to be made. The oD- vious preparations were in the ar- eas of food and drink. Several chicken wings we Fe ordered along with the purchase of tacos from Taco Bell and subs from Subway. Beverages were picked up as well to enhance the Super Bowl enjoy- ment. The ultimate gluttony began at kickoff at 6:18 PM First, my C()- horts and I dressed ourselves in Olll' mandatory \wife-beater\ shirts. Then after the consumption of sev- eral tacos, I began to fear the on- corning arrival <>f the chicken wings. When the wings arrived, I be- came very intimidated. Despite my expanding stomach, I attacke<l the wings with force, but began t() peak out after about 15. I was very embarrassed by m:y pathetic dis- play of eating ability, but sadly enough, I ate more than most ()f my colleagues. Yummy, yummy, yummy, yummy. [t became very difficult for me to enjoy most of the remainder of the game because I was nearly passed ()Ut from eat· ing too much. The next step was loosening a few 11otches on my belt. The game was ()[ course a joy since the Deaver Broncos won, and John Elway was MVP as I pre- dicted. What was very enjoyable was the even number of Denver fans and Atlanta fans in the room. This allowed for many Mile High Salutes with my friend (who is anonymously known as King Disco Fry). Our salutes were not countered · with many Dirty Bird dances since Atlanta did not give their fans much to celebrate about. The lioom was filled with noise from cheering. In fact people on the other end of my floor could hear our chants. Sadly enough, one person down the hall said that he heard the loud- est cheer during the Victoria's Se- cret commercial. When the game was over, my state of true depression began. While I was happy about the Bron- cos victory, I had to realize that football season was over. My tes- tosterone high quickly began to diminish. This was probably a good thing, since I really felt delusional from my high on masculinity. I believe that testosterone is a dangerous hormone, which can cause highly aggressive, idiotic, and irrational behavior. While I enjoy its effects, I feel that I may need a special pill to regulate its levels when it gets too high. Now that the testosterone has toned down, I ca.'l go back to my normal life of non-aggressive ac- tivities. Usually, my days include heavy involvement in the theater depart- ment and studying for my Biology classes. Once in while, however, I must break free from these calm activi- ties to unleash the beast within: the beast known as Test()sterone!

OP/ED Students Seek Support Talks Begin for Motto Change by Lis Kidder Opinions Editor Encircling the portrait of Minerva on the Union College Seal is the phrase \Sous Les Lois De Minerve Nous Devenons Tous Freres,\ which translates to, \Un- der the laws of Minerva, we all be- come brothers.\ This motto was passed in 1798, three years before the colilege was foumled. The college decided to use this motto in order to draw students from all backgrounds. It was de- signed to be al'l encompassing, so that young men from all back- grouncls. The sons of bankers, merchants, and politician's sons, would feel like a part of the col- lege community. Even though the college went coed in 1970, the motto has not changed to fit the new student body. A more appropriate motto fortoday's Union College is \Un- der the laws of Minerva, we aU are un.ited.\ This would constitute a gender blind motto, and would in- clude all students at Union. Many Ivy League schools, most notably Harvard, have already changed their motto to something more suitable to the current iden- tity of their students. This Monday, when the Rever- end Jessie Jackson stood behind the podium in Memorial Chapel and conveyed a message of equal- ity to Union College students and faculty, the Union seal on the front of that very same podium con- veyed a message of exclusion. During the next few months, stu- dents at Union will seek your sup- port in changing the motto to something more inclusive of all members ofthe Union community. Y <JU are enc<>uraged to give sup- port to these students; they are striving to encircle the Union Col- lege seal with an all-encompass- ing message. yo pt. flO thl fo co ha st< so ey pa or U1 l th J m. m m pt: at d( w w 7( cc er vi h( or h< s, th 0 A d I i l

Thor- oughly enjoyed by ail who at- tended, the Murder Mystery Din- ner is likely to become a Mounte- banks andllnion tradition. Upon entering Upper-Class Din- ing, all gt1ests received a packet. including atmme tag with fictitious name and a short biography on who yoHr \character was.\ We were asked to remain in character and mingle with the other guests. some ofwlwm. we later found out. were the actors. We 'vere also given a score sheet with various ques- tions to answer and hints to solve the mystery. Most of the gu.ests. which included students, faculty and staff. got deeply .invol\(ed in their char3:~ter and had a great time meeting the others in attendance. After alrnostanhour, we discov- ered the premise 11nder which we were there. Dr. Cusll, played by se- nior John Poor,. \.-ve'lcomed us and informed us.tllat he would be giv~ ing a presentation on the Center for Uncontrollable Violence. To il- lustrate his poi11t, he had brought along one of h ]s 1nost dangerous patients,. Eve. Eve~ played by se- '11 ior Lauren Brecller, was escorted by a security ~tllUd, Sgt. Gutt, played by sen i();r Jason Turi. Once they were intmduced and a :brief :presentation vvas 1nade, the actors took seats with the audience as the dining services st.atl'was serving a fine meal ofch ic ken, or eggplant for the vegetariallls in the group. What made the pe1formance so in- .teresting wasth~fine line between the scenes, the di1111er and the im- prov isatiol1 on the part of every- one involved. What seemed like ordinary smaH tall\ may have been critical in solving the mystery.

I love listening to the stories about the days when my father would rush home from a day at school, throw his books into a corner, grab his baseball glove and gather with his buddies for an afternoon ofbaJL Those boys would play their hearts out every day well past sundown, merely because they love the game. In their minds, they transformed into their favorite player - Babe Ruth, Joe DiMaggio, Ted Williams, and every day was game seven of the World Series. It was the dream of every little boy to play profes- sional baseball. BasebaJI was life. I believeJames Earl Jones said it best in \Field of Dreams\: \Through all the years, baseball has been the one constant. Our society has been like an anny of steamrollers, a blackboard erased, built up, and erased again.. But baseball has marked the time. It is part of our past.\ Through the rna-· jority of this century, our country lived and died by how their cities baseball team fared. Grown men and little children alike found them- selves glued to the radio or televi- sion, their heart pounding, a slight sweat forming on their forehead as their team began its come from be- hind rally in the bottom .of the ninth to capture the coveted pennant. Baseball was life and it was a beau- tiful thing. What has happened? Where has that love gone? In just a few short years, baseball has gone from what seemed tc be the foundation of our society t() another profes- sional sport ru11 by greedy busi- nessmen. Owners are merely con- cerned with making money, play- ers too are concerned with making money, and tile love and respect baseball once held has vanished. The same fans \Nho, years ago, could easily recitethe startingline- up of their favQrite team, now have trouble remembering what players are on the team. What has hap- pened? I' II tell you what has happened. The NFL has taken over. America has a new past-time. For twenty weeks a year; every Sunday after- noon, people are.gluedto theirtele- vision sets cheering for their re- spective ~am. During what otlrer season in what other sport d~ people watch so closely? The NFL plays the least number of games of any of the four major professional sports. However, their games are the most closely and consistently watched games. What is happen- ing to America? During the two weeks preceding Superbowl Sun- day, there were daily press confer- ences, continual ESPN coverage, and countless newspaper and magazine stories delving deep into the roots of both the Broncos and Falcons. Corporations spend an entire year developing their mar- keting strategy in ordertoproduce ~ . Dutchmen of the Week Jeff Hoerle & Dave. Searles JeffHoerle (standing to the left of head coach Judy Wolfe)and Dave Searles have been two outstanding swimmers for Union College. Named the co-captains of the Swimming Dutchmen last summer, the two have lived up to their title. They have not only provided a great deal of points for the team, buttheir leadership in and out of the pool has been fantastic. This past weekend was no dif- ferent. At Hamilton, Jeff took first place in the 200 yard individual Medley while Dave ended the day with a victory in the 200 free_ The men are currently second in the UCAA with a 3-5 record and are preparing for the regl;llar sea- son finale against St. Lawrence this weekend. Beginning Monday, Union .pre- pare for the New York Champion· ship meet which will be heLp on February 25-2 7 at nearby Rensselaer. After the N e'W York State Champioships, Searles and Hoerle will prepare for National. Both trav•· elcd to last year's Nationals meet and are looking forward to ending their Union College Swimming ca- reer on a high note. Clearly Jeff and Dave have been dominating members of the team and both will be missed. Dutchwoman of the Week Erin MeN amara In her two years as a starting memcber of the women's basketball team, Sophomore Erin McNamara has proven to be a vital and dangerous scoring threat from the perimeter. During what has been considered rebuilding seasons, McNamara, along with fellow Dutchwomen, are slowly becoming a force in the UCAA. This season, McNemara is aver- aging close to 13 points per ,game and has excelled in a number of games, posting high point tallies. ' ' . ' Two weekends ago, McNamara r1etted 18 against Hamilton and drained 19 versus St. Lawrence this past Saturday. With four weeks remaining in this season, the Dutchwemen find themselves hanging close to post season play, an achievement this program has never attained. Cur- rently, they are fifth place. This week,theDutchwomen\Nill host their rival Rensselaer, Tiles· day, February 9 at6:00 inthe Me- morial Fieldhouse. .. entertaining commercials for the Superbowl. What other. sport has both their games AND1he-ir co-m- mercials as highly anticipate~ as the Supetbowl. There is never a break in the action so who wouldn't want to watch? The regular season provided as· many fireworks this year as the playoffs. In the AFC E~t. a fight ensued week in and week out for the conference lead. In the end, four of the five AFC East teams reached the playoffs and one reached the APC title game. The teams' records, when compared to each other, are a mere two garries in difference. For these teams, every week felt like the playoffs, and this ·is how it felt for their fans as well. It is a shame what has happened to baseball. Last summer was debatably the best season of base .. ball ever. The race for-62 between Sammy Sosa and Mark McGv,dre, Kerry Wood striking out20 batters, Cal Ripke:n finallytak:ing a seat. and David Wells' perfect game. The Yankeeswon 125 games, more than any other team in history. It truly was a remarkable year. However, with that remarkable season came and even more remarkable offsea~ son during which players have signed contracts for more money than ever before. Why, simply be- cawse players or sports have an in- c~:edible season does their market price haveto rise as well? One season is not going tQ change the trend that has slowly been rising. Years ago, baseball may have been the pillar of soci- ety, but this beautiful game has become an ugly business and while we experienced the best sea- son ever this past summer, the sea- son was seemingly tarnished by lack of loyalty and large contracts. The days of baseball after school and)istening to games on the radio at night are gone. In- stead, pick-up football is the game of choice and that desire to catch the game winning pass or lay a bone-crunching tackle have re- placed the sweet sound of a bat striking a ball. Our country is in sports' transfonnation and for now, there is nothjng we can do about it except sit hack, and enjoy the com- tnercials.

Grown men and little children alike found them- selves glued to the radio or televi- sion, their heart pounding, a slight sweat forming on their forehead as tl1eir team began its come from be- hind rally in the bottom of the ninth 1o capture the coveted pennant. Baseball was life and it was a beau- tiful thing. What has happened? Where 11as that love gone? In just a few ~hort years, baseball has gone from what seemed to be the foundation of our society to another profes- sional sport run by greedy busi• nessmen. Owners are merely con- cerned with making money, play- ers too are concerned with making money, and the love and respect baseball once held has vanished. The same fans who, years ago, could easily recite the starting line- up of their favorite team, now have trouble remembering what players are on the team. What has hap- pened? I' II tell you what has happened. The NFL has taken over. America has a new past-time. For twenty weeks a year, every Sunday after- noon, people are glued to their tele- vision sets cheering for their re- spective team. During what other season in what other sport do people watch sodosely? The NFL plays the leastnumberofgames of any of the four major professional sports. However, their games are the most closely and consistently 'Watched games. What is happen- ing to America? During the two \Weeks preceding Superbowl Sun- day, there were daily press confer- ences, continual ESPN coverage, arJd countless newspaper and magazine stories delving deep into the roots of both the Broncos and Falcons. Corporations spend an entire year developing their mar- keting strategy in order to produce Dutchmen of the Week Jeff Hoerle & Dave Searles Jeff Hoerle (standing to the left of head coach Judy Wolfe)and Dave Searles have been two outstanding swimmers for Union College. Named the co-captains of the Swimming Dutchmen last summer, the two have lived up to tlleir title. They have not only prGvided a great deal of points for tile team, but their leadership in and out of the pool has been fantastic. This past weekend was no dif- ferent. At Hamilton, Jeff took first ])lace in the 200 yard individual Medley while Dave ended the day with a victory in the 200 free. The men are currently second in the UCAA with a 3-5 record and are preparing for the regular sea- son finale against St. Lawrence this weekend. Beginning Monday, Union pre- pare for the New York Champion- ship meet which will be help on February 25-27 at nearby Rensselaer. After the New York State Champioships, Searles and Hoerle will prepare for National. Both trav- eled to last year's Nationals meet and are looking forward to ending their Union College Swimming ca- reer on a high note. Clearly Jeff and Dave have been dominating members of the team and both will be missed. Dutchwoman of the Week Erin MeN amara In her two years as a starting memeber of the women's basketball team, Sophomore Erin McNamara has proven to be a vital and da!lgerous scoring threat from the perimeter. During what has been comsidered rebuilding seasons, McNamara, along with fellow Dutchwomen, are slowly becoming a f()rce in the UCAA. This season. McNemara is aver- a~ing close to 13 points per game and has excelled in a number of ga.mes, posting high point tallies. Two weekends ago, McNamara netted 18 against Hamilton and drained 19 versus St. Lawrence this past Saturday. With four weeks remaining in this season, the Dutchwomen find themselves hanging close to post season play, an achievement this program has never attained. Cur- rently, they are fifth place. This week, the Dutchwomen will host their rival Rensselaer, Tues- day, February 9 at 6:00 in the Me- morial Fieldhouse. entertaining commercials for the Superbowl. What other sport has both their games AND their com- mercials as highly anticipate!i as the Superbowl. There is never a break in the action so who wouldn't want to watch? The regular season provided as· many fireworks this year as the playoffs. In the AFC East, a fight ensued week in and week out for the conference lead. In the end, four of the five AFC East teams reached the playoffs and one reached the AFC title game. The teams' records, when compared to each other, are a mere two games in difference. For these teams, every week felt like the playoffs, and this is how it felt for their fans as well. It is a shame what has happened to baseball. Last summer was debatably the best season ofbase- baH ever. The race for 62 between Sammy Sosa and Mark McGwire, Kerry Wood striking out 20 batters, Cal Ripken finally takir~g a seat, and David Wel'ls' perfect game. The Yankees won 125 games, more than any other team in history. It truly was a remarkable year. However, with that remarkable season carne and even more remarkable off sea- son during which players have signed contracts for more money than ever before. Why, simply be- cause players or sports have an in- credible season does ~heir market price have to rise as well? One season is not going to change the trend that has slowly been rising. Years ago, baseball may have been the pillar of soci- ety, but this beautiful game has become an ugly business and while we experienced the best sea- son ever this past summer, the sea- son was seemingly tarnished by lack ofloyalty and large contracts. The days of baseball after school and listening to games on the radio at night are gone. In- stead, pick-up football is the game of choice and that desire to catch the game winning pass or lay a bone-crunching tackle have re- placed the sweet sound of a bat striking a ball. Our country is in sports' transformation and for now, there is nothing we can do about it except sit back, and enjoy the com- mercials.

He played some selected favor- ites such as \Can't Touch This,\ \'The Humpty Dance~\ and \'C'mon and Ride It (The Train).\ Students filled the dining hall, making it necessary to open some the windows because it was so warm in Upper C1ass. In addition to the dancing, that people were taking part in, there _, . was a delicious array of focd, pro- ~~~_.--~--~~~ Dave Meguerdi~llianrT(: Stuaems enjoy food and socializing at the Winter Formal. vided by none other than Union's fme Dining Services. There were desserts, pizza pockets, cheese and crackers, fmit, and \ring pops\ available on tile tables. Those students over 21 took ad- vantage of the fact that Chet's wll.s open and participated in drinking cocktails. Two Unionstlldents, Junior Mike Winn and Sophcmore Stephen Flaherty, both of whom are progra.rn assistants, dressed in tuxedos and stood at the entrance of the dining hall handing out red carnation!~ to the first 25() girls to arrive at the formal.

This gives people \multiple options,': Mondlick says. \It's really just a rough proposal · and has to be voted on by the AAC. I'm very much open to suggestions. In fact, an amendment has been made to adjust the times so that they start on the quarter hours.\ Mondlick is also entertaining sug- gestions for an extended \walking time\ at one of the two lunch peri- ods. This addresses another prob- lem from the days before the com- mon lunch period, when someone could have class during the times . Upperclass and West is open for lunch. Giving people twenty or twenty-five minutes instead of ten, Mondlick says. \might not give people time to go to West or Upperclass to eat, but they can at least grab a sandwich or something from Dutch.\ The AAC was \very receptive\ to Mondli:ck's proposal. He bf()ught up the problems with the current system and presented his proposal as the solution to tllose problems. Many questions carne llJ), but \the faculty see the need f()r change,\ Mondlick said.

Sixteen teams braved the C()ld and snow· to take part in the four-hour marathon event, spons<Jred by the Program Assis• tants ()f Union College. Tne Carpanello Ice Company supplied the 25 blocks of ice and the stu- dents <JfUnion supplied the inven· tiveness and desire. With the Dutch Pipers singit:Jg inside the Nott over the loud speal<- ers for all to hear, the contesta11is got t() \.Vork, chiseling and scraiJ· ing. No one could tell just wh~t each team was creating at the start, and th~y sure weren't letting their secret out. Several techniques were employed by the differe11t groups: some preferred the lee block to be on its side, others used their ax: as opposed to the old ham- mer a.nc::l screwdriver method, and. still others got colorful by using; Kooi-Aid mix to brighten up their creation. The teams incorporated! several different instruments, :as well, ittcluding files, scissors, irons,. and blow torches. Thankfully, n01 one was injured. As the day wore on, the ice stat.;. ues be,gan to take shape. They ranged from elaborate castles tcJ Roma11 temples, and from chess piecesto Greek letters.

People can make a David out of a toothpick and a bucket of cheese if they put their minds to it!\ Mike was metaphori- cally speaking, of cour.se, for an ice bl<Jck, a hammer and a chisel. Se- nior Bill Desrochers, who was on hand as a spectator and for the free hot cocoa, said, \I wish I had the chance to show what I can do. I just didn't sign up in time I guess. If there's one thing that I can do ... it's carving ice!\ Everyone was having so much fun that they lost sight of the fact th.at this was still a contest and that tb.ere had to be a winner. These dedicated carvers turned out to be tile team of Mike Iger, Ed Lallier,. Sean Spindler-Ranta, Sarah Shoe- maker, Marinlticbardson, and John Poor. Their statue, called \Cinderella's Castle,\ was put on display at the Wimter Carnival formal later th!tt niight for all to see in its icy sple:nc::lor.

Page 4 • February 11, 1999- • (IJ:.\l1Wnrmemsifli Campus News~· Union ~unior Appears on CBS' The Price is Right by Brooke Barylkk News Editor It started as a typical Wednes- day morning for the Union College SwimmingandDivingTeam. They awoke early on December 9 but, on this particular day, the destination was neither the pool nor the weight room. In fact, the team was headed to an unfamiliar location that prom- ised to be a lot more enjoyable than a workout. The team was on their annual training trip that takes place dur- ing winter break. This year they ventured to Mission Viejo, Califor- nia for some relatively warm weather and intense training. The trip not only consisted ofphysical activity, but some fun team-bond- ing events happen as welL This year, since they were so dose to Los Angeles, the team decided to visit a game show. They selected the one that seemed to be the most receptive to large groups, which mrned out to be The Price Is Right. Some members ofthe team called ahead to reserve group tickets f0r the swimmers, divers and coaches so that they would not have to wait on line fer a spot in the audience. They piled into the vans at 6:45AM that morning to journey to Los Angeles. Erin Wittes, a junior noted, \We left early because we had heard that traffic on the freeway·is horrible in the morning. It took us until8:30 to get to Los Angeles, when it usu- File Photo Erin Wittes poses after her appearance on the show. ally is only a 45 minute drive.\ The team wanted to arrive at the studi-o early because to get re- served tickets the group needs to clai1nthem before 9AM oftaping day. On this particular day, there were nootller groups attending the tap- ing of 'The Price Is Right. For this reaso11, the Union College crew was the only members of·the audience si1tin_g at their specific location outside of the studio. They all sat on a long bench outside of the stu- dio waiting for the taping to begin. WI.ilethey were waiting a member of the stage crew wrote out their namet!Tgs. After their nametags were fmished, the swimmers, divers and coaches showed identification that proved they were at least 18 years ofage. Once this precess was com· pleted, the Union group moved to a locati!On with the other contes- tants. There they sat for quite some time, waiting to .enter the studio. Another member of the television crew chatted with the contestants· and told them that they were go- ing to .proceed to another waiting a;ea in groups of 10 where they would meet the producer. The prQ- ducer would then conduct a .grou.p interview where the cQntestants needed to introduce th~mselves and also explain soineth-ing about themselves. From this informal in- terview, the producerdeCided who· should be on the show. Wittes noted, ~'Ijusttold hitn my name and that I was from Middlebury.Then I said that I was a junior at UnionCdllege and I was here withthe.swimteam. J also said that I waspsychedto be in Califor- nia.\ After the interview, the .contes- tants entered another room where they had ·to leave their cameras. Finally, they entered the studio where they satfor 20 minutes until the actual taping started. \Right before the show started Rod R<i>ddy carne out and ex- plained how the show would run. He told us to clap when the signs said \clap\ and he told us to cheer when the signs said \cheer claimed Wittes. When the show started, the Union Colleg~ ·crowd, dressed in their Union apparel, screamed and cheered like they were at a meet. The show began as the first four contestants were called down. They bid on a prize and then one participated in a game. Next Rod Roddy called EriR Wittes. \I didn't realize that he had called me because he pronounced my name incorrectly. Then when I realized it was me, I was really shocked. I then stood up and jogged down the aisle toward the podium,\ e:x;plained Wittes. Wittes had to bid on a few items before she was called up on stage. Her winning bid came on two tele- vision/VCR sets on which she bid $500. Wittes noted, \They were wotth $619, everyo11e else bid much nigher than that. I did not know that I had won though because I was so ex. cited to be up there that I just did not know what was going aroundme. Bob Barker actua1lytold me to come up on stage.\ Wittes did indeed .go up on stage and she played a gCillle in which she needed to guess on the prices of the five household items, trying . not to pick the one that was worth more than $3,50. For each choice that she answered correctly, Wittes was awarded cash that multiplied in increments often. At the conclusion .of her game and winning $100, Wittes joined tile other contestants who made it up on stage. She then was able to spin the \Big Wheel.\ \I spun fist and got$0.40thefirst time and$0.25 the secondtime. The next person went over. The third contestant got $0.90 on his first try so he won and was allowed to con- tinue on to the 'Showcase Sllo:w- down,.'\ Wittes recalled. Wittes claims that she had a lot of fun. \It was a great experience,\ she noted. ''I can't wait to get my prizes!\ ''I Wrote Them All for You'' Student Forum Notes An Independent Study Explores Emotions through Multimedia by Courtney Hayden Staff Writer On display this past week in the Mobil Lounge in the Reanter Cam- pus Center was the culmination of Loralynne Krobetzky's indepen- dent study project entitled, \I Wrote Them All for You.\ An array of poetry, short story, and film pieces the project pro- vided extens.ive insight into au- thors past difficulties dealing with the suicide of a close friend and the tumultuous period of depres- sion and alcohol abuse Which fol- lowed. Working under the guidance of Union CollegeEnglish Professor Ruth Stevens, Krobetzky strove to create a project which illustrated her personal loss while at the same time appealing to the experiences of love and loss which are often apparent themes at one point· of time or another in the lives of ev- eryone. Began last fall, as part of a two term independent study. \I Wrote Them All for You\ was slow to evolve into the present work. Krobetzky wanted to represent her ideas in a way that had yet to be explored. She decided to make one of the focuses of her study the use of vari- . ous mediums which could be em- ployed to convey the issues she wished to deal with. She stated, \I wanted to present tllis in the way that would effect pe()p le the greatest and relate to everyone. l really wanted to do something different.\ On its opening evening, \I Wr<Jte Them All For You\ was pre- sen ted amidst a backdrop of vari- ous musical selections and candle light. which both greatly added to the intensity of the viewing. lll all, Krobetzky is extremely pleased with the final product that resulted after fifteen weeks of dili- gellt 'W()rk. This is undoubtedly due in part to beT successful partnership with Pr()f~ssor Stevens. Kr<lbetzky states emphatically, \I lo-ved working with Ruth, we make a great team .. \ Krobetzky continues, \She helped me put every aspect of this period of my life in order and con- vey the artists perspective, the woman's perspective as well as many others, on aU of these events, which was obviously a very hard task.\ The use of various mediums were employed to accurately con- vey the issues s:he wished to deal with an<! express in this presenta- tion.

Board of Trustees ''Debunks the Myths,~' Holds Winter by Jim DeWan New.'i Editor Last Friday, Febmary 5, tl1e Board of Trustees made their winter p;il- grimage to the Union Coll~gecam­ pus. The Board. whose mcn11Jers come from as far as Califon1ia and as close as Schenectady, meet ttn-ee times a year. once each tenu. At these meetings, decisions an 1nade ranging from the academic ca len- dar we utilize to decision.s £tbout the master plan, proposed to the campus. The Board consists of alumni, busi·nessmen. an <I :b;usi- nesswomen. appointed to ()versee the handling .of the colleg~'s af- fairs. Two members of the faculty sit on the Board. one from al ibetal atts curriculm11 and another fi·om a science or engineering curriculttf1l. Professor Anton Warde~ of the Gennan Department, and Pro-fessor Tom' Werner cunently sit Oil the Board. Union allows two students to sit on the Board ofTrust~es. and is one ofthe fuw colleges to allow students to do this. A me111 ber of the junior and senior classes voice students' concerns at the B<Jard' s meetings. Jon Zandmat1 '?9 and Andy Markowski ·oo prese11 tly till these pos.itions. Many students have n() klea as to who or what the Board of Trlist- ees is or are or how they operate. As a result of the coinci<lence of the Board's meeting and Winter Carnival, Student Activities hosted an open reception for the trustees where students could freely interact with the trustees and discuss any number of issues with the trustees. From every account, the reception seemed\to go well. Liz Schmitt, a Program Assistant responsible for the organization of Winter Carnival, thought the event was extremely successftll, saying there was a '\really nice atmo- sphere, with many students hav- ing serious conversations with the trustees.\ Zandman agreed, de- scribing the trustees as \'very re- ceptive,\ continuing that it helped to ''debunk the myth thatthe Board of Trustees is out of totlch with the students.\ Many stLtdents at- tended ttre event on behalf of a cettain club or cause. Many rep- resentatives ofthe dance program came to discuss its future. One such club member was Adam Murphy. Co-President of'U-Med, who attended the event to help \promote U-Med and its aware- ness.'' He found the event \really useful,\ and a discussion about fund raising events spawned some \really good ideas.\ The Board ofTrusteesalso dis- ~ ~~s!!.!J ~sl project and its continuation. Union is rap- idly .acquiring prope11 ies in the area. and now owns 42 properties in the Seward neighborhood. The only o~jection the Board voiced against the Seward West project was a cuncern about the monL\) being removed ft·om the wllcge ·s endmv- mcnt for the acquisition of proper- ties. Their concerns were dis- cussed. and the project is ·'going foi\\Vard and far ahead of schedule\ according to Zandman. The last n'lajor issue that the Beard dealt with was a discussion oftlle academic calendar. TI1e docu- 111ent prepared by Dean Linda Cool, Dean of Faculty. concerning the pros and cons ofboth systems was presented to the Board, and they then discussed the systems and their stance. They made no detini- ti ve stance on either side of the is- sue, but they instead endorsed that the AcademiC Affairs Council take a good look at our system. and de- c ide what would be best fot· the C()llege. . They also expressed an interest in settling this issue for a long pe- riod oftime. They suggested that a decision be made to see if a major change is needed, and if it is, to .j)resent it to the Board for a fom1al discussion to be followed by a de~ fill iti ve decision. , \My family was great. although I think they rn ight have taken it harder then me, even now,'' Schwartz stated. Yet Schwartz. dur: to MS, had 1() lt:arn a hard lesson about what £rue friends are. \Some ti·ierJds were very sup- portive, while others withdrew and I now don't even speak to them.

Page 8 • February 11, 1999 • aJnucor~imsis ·world News ·WORLD NEWS Peace Talks Attempt to End Kosovo Crisis by Charlie Tuthill Stajl Writer Peace talks between Kosovo and Serbia began last Saturday as dip lon1ats from both side:- met in France to discuss a cease-fire. The conference is the first time in the eleven- month contlict that both sides have dis- cussed peace. The talks, which are being helo in Rambouillet, France. are also being attended by a six-nation Contact Group that serves as a mediator for the two sides. The Serbs. the delegates from Kosovo. and the Contact Group all have very differept goals. The delegates representing Kosovo, wl1 ich is composed of an Ethnic Albaniat~ majority. want independence from Serbia. Serbia. on the other hand, wants to keep Kosovo in its present .form. as a part of Serbia. The Con- tact Group falls in between these two views, advocating more autonomy for Knsovo' s Ethnic Alban ian population but rejecting complete independence. The talks arc an im porl<mt step tmvards peace in the Balkans. Many leaders believe that ifth~: conflict had escalated. more coun- tries would have become involved. In llJ9~. ad iplomat in Belgrade Cllllllllented that vio- lence in Kosovo ''would be very serious. because a conflict in Kosovo wnuld prob- ably not be confined within the borders of the former Yugoslavia. Albania would be- come involved, pressure on Turkey to be- come involved would be intense. and Greece might also be dragged in.'\ The diplomat described the situation as \a nightnwre sce- nario.'\ The violence in Kosovo dates back to the 1974 Yugoslav Constitution. \\'hich granted Kosovo a great amount of autonomy. C iti- zens ofKosovo controlled most aspects of public lite undenhis arrangement. In 1989. however. the Serbian government. under President Milosevic. revoked much of calmyths.\ Kosovo's political autonomy.

He privately met with world leaders to dis- . cuss policy and his own aims. Abdullah also. contacted £raqi Vice Presi- dent Taha Maarouf that he wanted to find ways t0 enhance Jorda11 's relationship with Iraq. Most leaders. after leaving, expressed their hopes that Abdul1ah's rule will be as fruitful and promising as his father's.

OP/ED Opinions \Ve're Not Fooled _A Response to Dean A/fords Ridiculous Letter by Us Kidder Opinion Editor Last week DeaR Alford wrote a letter discussing the safety level on cam pus and defending the adrn inistration' s role in and re- sponse to the incident at Richmond last month. Dean Alford started his letter by telli11g us that the majority of crimes on campus are committed in parking lots and open areas and that '\Uni{)11 suffers an average of $19,000ofvandalism in a year and Trinity College in Hartf01~d esti- mates its figures as more than $90.000.\ It seems that he wasn't lis- tening to his parents \.Vhen they told him, \We don't care what Bobby's parents do. Bobby is not our son. Fred is our son.\ While it's nice that we don't suffer$90,000 ayea1· in damages, it does not excuse the $19,000 in damages that we do spend. Of course, vandalism was not the point ofthe recent de- bates on safety. Neither was cheating, stealing or lying, all ofwhicl1 were mentioned bv Dean ' Alford as \'acts which erode the trust that is necessary in a coml11u- nity :· The point 6f and the reason for the debate on safety was the break-in at Richmond. The fact that five men gained entrance to an all woman ·s dorm and to a resident's room is appall- ing. The administration should be tha11king the god of fire extin- guishers that those girls weren't hurt. How dare they write a letter saying that students have a respon- sibility to not undermine the safety system? lt was not the student's faalt that these men gained en- trance to their room. They were not undermining the system while sleeping in their beds at four•thirty in the liloming. And if it was not the girl's responsibility to not un- dennine the system, then which students was Dean Alford refer- ring to, the other residents of Rich- -mond? Has anyone thought about the level of intimidation possessed by five men? How can you blame the women who were followed into the d01m by these men? What were they supposed to do. fight them? ''We cuJTently have twenty-two buildings housing stu dents: exoluding Wade-Lupe. There are twenty-eight discrete groupings within these buildings ... The various groups range from a Jow of 8 people to the 264 residents of Davidson.\ Guess what? We have on~ all- female donn. No one can seriot1sly support the notion that Richmond does not need more prote<::tion than the other dorms. It is understood on campus and in the community that Richmond is filled with women. Now, it is understood on campus and in the community that Richmond is filled with unprotected women. Days before the Richmond break-in there was an im:·ident at Richmond in wll ich an unauthorized male came into the dorm. Three residents of Richmm1d tried to sto him ft·om coming in, following the advice of. the administration by asking him to call who111ever he was going to see. The male pushed past them and walked into the dorm. The girls then ran up to their room and calle<d sectirity. If there had been a desk attendant, this man would not have gained entrance in the first place. If there was a desk attendant at Richmond the night those men tried to gain entrance, the situation would have stopped at the door. Dean AI ford claims that the desk . attendants were unqualified. How qualified d~es someone have to be to distinguish between a man and a woman'! Women U.ve in Rich- mond, 1111;!11 do not. A monkey could figure it olll. If the guards were not doing the job they were hired to do, .it is the fault of the people who hired them. Find responsible people and checkup on them to make sure tlmt they are doing their job. How hard is that'? We seem t() hire peopk for every other job on campus: profes- sors; dining hall employees. mainteha11ce woi~kers. Why is safety being compromised, while the salad bar is being maintained? Dean Alford is right: safety is a partnership. The women in Rich- mond have bee11 holding up the.ir end ofth-is pannership. Th.e admiJ~­ istration has not. While it's nice that President HulL Dean Alford and Wi !linn Sickinger will be meeting with the Student Forum to discuss safety issues on campus, the wort1en of Richmond are not safer than they were before ihe break-it1. Talking about safety does not make the campus safer. Hopefully, in the future, the ad- ministration will spend less time attacking the victims and more time ensuring the safety of students on campus. Student Clubs Need Additional Funding by Steve Schuler Contributing Writer Union is a really good college. but are we great? My answei': not yet. I believe w·e can be great, but we need improvements in some areas, most notably student qual- ity of life. Some thi11gs such as in-mom cable. more live music, va lidine at local businesses, and a general upgrade in dorm living would all contribute. Over the next few weeks I will address these issues, paying atten- tion to explain the situation and h<;l\\' it effects students, while also suggesting how to possibly rem- edy tbe problem. Today: student club funding. The student activities budget is $400.000 a year. This heeds to be stretcl1ed to fund the ever increas- ing number of clubs. the student government and such school wide activities as last weekends formal and spring-fest. This is not enough money. Of Union's annual oper- ating budget. only a re Jatively small amount is given back to Sill- dents in the form of extracurricu- lar funding, not including spo11s. Anyo11e who has taken a calil- pus tour may remernbet· the line ''oh yeah, we have all kinds of clubs and if we don't have what you want it 1 S easy to start a new one.'' Til is may be true, but to g.ive a club the chance to thrive it needs funding. To fund a club you have to go through the student fin<:~t'lce con1· mittee. a sub group of the stude11t forum. This group mu'st draw off what is called the ''holding ac· count.'' This account is basically whatever is left over after the stu· dent activities budget has been dis· tributed to all existing gt·oups. This leaves little to give to new clubs. The finance committee is left with decisions such as ''sllou ld we have a better band for spring- fest or should we fund this grouP' of motivated students so their 11ew club can prosper?'' It is a ridiculous position to be in. The holding accoltnt should provide for existing clubs jn need of extra funds and spons\lr schoo1 wide functions as it does now. A new categ()ry needs to be created that would support clubs formed that year. At a recent Student Forum meet- ing the idea was bl'Ougllt lip of ac- tually ctnting out whole clubs that are n.ot as actiw. to have !.!Xtra money in tl1e student activities bud- get. All student clubs are important to someo11e. A group with a small following is not less important to , its members, or in what it contrib- utes to 011r campus, than a larger one. It is not as if anyone with a wacky idea gets dub funding. The student forum must first approve a trial pedod fm the c Iub without any budget. After ten weeks the finance committee and the forum must ap- prove the club's budget. If a club passes this test, it has to have or- ganized and motivated students. · Any gmu]l that meets these re- quirements deserves a chance. The current arrangement creates fewer optiQns diminishing our so- cial and i11tellectual atmosphere. Why limit ourselves? <!Icrttcori:l-i.msi\\ ·February .11, 1999 · Page 11 Union's Finest I:Jy E1iic Wisotzky Omtributing Writer This week I am writing to ad- vertise the presence of a weat tal- ent on this campus.

Between 1989 and 1990, the number of rapes and attempted rapes increased aD estimated 59%-to an estimated 207r600 rapes from 130r000, ac- cording to the National Crime Survey. One in 5 adult women has been rapedr according to the cumulative findings of 4 separate groups of investigators working in different regions of th.e United States. 20% of adult women, 15% of college women, and 12% of adolescent girls have experienced sexual abuse a.nd assault during their lives. According to the U.S. Department of Justice, Office of Justice Programs, African JUnerican women are almost twice as likely to be raped as white women are. 78% of rapes involve a person that the victim knew- husbands or ex-boyfriends (1.0%}, other relatives/ friends):neighbors (29%). 29% of all rapes occur when the victim is less than 11 years old and 32% of all :rapes occur when the victim is between the ages o:J; ll and 17.

After do- ing this tor over a year, I have come to play out every possible topic in this sheltered microcosm we call Union. I mean look around, there's not too much here to poke fun at without sounding re- dundant. Especially for a once a week column. And while the past couple c·oiumns may have been humorous. the Top Ten lists and quizzes just don't cut it for me. But to write prose I need new topics. Yeah. I could have kept it up with Greek system and carrot stick jokes. but I felt it was either quit or change formats. So ... \! was wondering ?fyou knew any goodprcmks ro pull on reop!e. We are ina little ·war on my.floor and we are ready to kill our oppo- nents. Hehe. Please, ifvou have Way back when I was in middle of looking at colleges, someone told me that while Union was a good s<:hooL it was a lot like the high sch<>ol I attended. For a time I could not see the correla- tion between Union and my high school. For starters, Union is much bigger than my high school. Sec- ondly. l only have thl'ee classes twice a week. I used to go to school five days a week from eight o'clock in the morning until three- thirty in the afternoon. Already. Union is better than my high school, that was until this weekend. This past weekend I went to the prom. Yes, I went to the pt·om right heredn our ow11 Campus Center. By the look of it, ·February 1 , 1999 · any good pranks that are not cli- che please, please give them to me! Signed, Prankenste;n\ There's one that always works. Fill up a garbage can with any dis- gusting liquid you can think of. I will not mention them here. Wait for your victims to be in their room. Lean the garbage can up against their door. When they open the.ir door the contents will spill out an over their tloor, and hopefully their feet. Another good one (if you guys are males) is to put a super strong adhesive on the person's bottle of Gold Bond Medicated Powder. When ht!!goes to pleasure himselfwith th.at oh so delicate white powder. he ·11 have to expla.in to several. people why his hand is gltted to a bottle of Gold Bond. But I feel that the best pranks involve the bountiful amount of dead animal carcasses found here on campus. Carefully aC(:]Uire one of the dead squinels or crows from the Fox parking lot. Cut its headofC Then put .it in the pillowcase of the victim. and wait for them t(1 1ind it. They will most likely realize it as they'regoing to bed. You'll know they found it from the ear-piercing shrieks com- ing from down the hall. The ··oead-an imal method'' as I like to call it can be used for anonymous pranks, too. If you just feel \ike messing with soh1eone's head. bring a carcass to Upper-Class. Get a tray and put the carcass on it. Stick a token, dulL .butter knife in its chest and in ketchup write \'Don\t wony, you're next\ on the tray.

Science &: Technology Science & Technology Caffeine: A Student~s Best Friend by Victoria Hargreaves Sc i~nce and Technology Editor Mi 1'1 ions imbibe the sweet nectar on their way to work every morn- ing. College students brew pots andpots of the bitter brown liquid in thehopes of an awakening from their sedative studies. While caffeine has long been rummed to be the cause of cancer and heart disease in the past, these warnings have not stopped the averag,e American rrom consuming v ~ appro0ximately 200 milligrams of caffeine each day.

While it is clear that caffeine stimulates smne people, the chemi- cal is not believed to elevate one's blood pressure over time. For those who do experience elevated blood pressure, it rarely lasts for more than a couple of hours and is most often similar to that experi- enced when climbing a staircase. Similarly, a link between cafteine and heart disease is still un- founded. A study published in the iVa- tiona! Research Counci! on Diet and Health in 1989 said, ''evidence linki'ng coffee consumption to the risk of coronary heart disease ... is weak and inconsistent.\ Although it has long been a ru- mor. the link between caffeine and cancer has never been established scientifically. Recent studies of 16.600 No1wegians aild of7,3 50 Ha- waiians found no evidence for a connection between cancer and caffeine. Caffeine is not believed to cause breast cancer specitica lly either. The Internet Phone by Daniel Kelmanoyich Stqff'Writcr Advances in both processing power and audio/visual hardware fm tile personal computer have led to fhe expansion oflnternet phone as a form ofcommunication. Hav- ing conversations over the Internet lws been common in the form of text '·chat,'' but being able to have a verbal conversation has evolved fro:m being a novelty to having a practical purpose. Internet phone software is made by a variety of companies includ- ing Microsoft, Vocal Tee. and Connectix. These programs allpw a l!Ser to connect to allother user on a computer over the Internet and talk to them as if the connec- tim1 was over the telephone. The software does this by converting the statements of the users into digital packets that are transferred between the computers and then tra11slated back into the coJTespond- ing audio on the destination com- puter. This requires that the two users use the same software to communicate. There are certain limitations to the use ofthis sott'r·vare. Tile major limitation is on users using tno- dems to connect tn the l11temet. The software is fairly dependent on a fast Internet connection there- fore requiring that users have con- nection speeds at or above those seen on a 28.8-baud modem. This is typically the !ewer limit and at that speed. the quHiity ofthe con- versation will n<lt be as clear or accurate as at higher connection speeds. Another limitation is that a full duplex audio card is required for conversation equivalent to that seen on a standat•d phone. Full duplex audio allows the software to both send and receive audio sig- nals simultaneously. By having simultaneous send- ing/receiving, the users can hear each other and speak to each other at the same time. Without a full du- plex sound card. the software can only work like a speakerphone be- cause only one user can taJk.at a time. Internet. phone programs have many advantages that sOinetimes outweigh .the limitations. By using these software programs, users can talk to people for free over the Internet They can talk to anyone in the wor1d and thet•efore save a lot of money in long distance bills if relatives odriends are eqllipped with the software. Another feature. of these pro: grams is the ability to use video in addition to audio. If a computer camera is av~ilable, the users can do video conferencing for a very low price. These cameras 1'a11ge in price fi·om $8()-$150 and work fairly well. Several of the Internet phone programs are commercially avai 1- able like lntemet Phone by Vocal Tee, and Connectix Videophone (Purchased by Logitech iil Sept. 98) while Microsoft offers NetMeeting as a free application. Any ofthese applications work as an internet/ videophone. There are even cer- tain telephones that can be pur- chased and connected to a com- puter to make talking on Internet phone easier and more familiar. While ph<lne companies may c01nplain about the evolt1tion of the Internet phone; it is sure to change the way that some people communicate in the futllte. In an international study of lOO,OOO deaths due to breast can\ cer, there was insufficient dat~ to indicate a relationship: Pediatri,- cians. obstetricians, and old wives tales have warned pregnant wome11 not to consume caffeinated prod- ucts during their pregnancies. Sc.i- entists have recently proved these warnings unnecessary. Three studies of more than 15,000 women found no relation- ship between birth defects and caf- feine. Children born to women who drank large amounts of caffeine- containing beverages were found to have approximately the Sc\me number of birth defects as children born to mothers who did not con- sum.e any caffeine. The chemical is not believed to cause spontaneous abortion or significant decrease in bi.rth weight. The Centers for Disease Control and Harvard Medical School studied almost 3,00() women to determine if a link be- tween fertility and caffeine con- sumption existed; no such link was found. A recent study of 138 postmeno- pausal women between the ages of 55 and 70 on hom10ne replace- ment therapy conducted at Penn- sylvania State University College of Medicine and University·Hos- pital found no relationship be- tween caffeine intake and de- creased bone densitY and os- teoporosis. While many people feel dep~n­ pent upon cafteine to be alert and active, it is not, in fact, ''addictive_'' Unlike most illegal dntgs. one need not consume increased amounts of caffeine to feel an effect after the first time one consumes it. Also, quitting caffeine consump- tion is easy. \Ubmion OOilill~ege Most peQple do not expeti<;!nce withdrawal symptoms when end- ing caffeine consumpti01i as 011e would when qtfittingthe use ofan addictivedrug. Those people sen- sitive to caffeine may experience mild headaches. anxiet}. ami agi- tation when their daily consulllp- tion is drasticaliJy changed. Jo Ill in im ize these effects. one can lower the amount of caffeine taken in gradually. Fortunately. caffeine consumers can expelience some beneficial ef- fects due to their intake. Professor Edward Giovannuci of Harvard MLJical School reported that people who drank four or more cups of coffee a day had a 24~'o lower chance of developing co ron cancer than people who drank. no co lll~e. Researchers studying the rda- tionship between caffeine nm- sumption and infant bitth weight not only found that there was no link beMeen caffeine and low binh weight. bt;tt also that an increased consumption of.caffeine actually decreases a mother's chance of giving birth to an infant with low bitth weight. A study ofahnost 130,000 people from nonhem Calitornia found that there were fewer cases of suicide among coffee and tea drinkers. Some researchers have found that caffeine enhances \'exercise mance. increasing both energy and endurance.\ Sources: http://astro.umd.edu/-sgeier/ http://www .coffeescience.orgt http://www .smartbasi c .com I glos.news/3caffeine. 92.htrn I http://www. vhs.com/1 iterature/ IEJnLvliromnmentt:atl §lt1LJ[cdliue§ JPIJfiOJgr.amnt 1999 §eml~muaur §,erlue§ 'J'uesday 9 February 1999 CAs rm:nf: HH ENYIIW.VMf!\'JAI. ]Hl'/..C.Ii fOI'I .• iLL?

Arts & Entertainment Dinin.g Out ith Gina LaSorsa By Julia Barkin Sh~[f'Writer for the few early -morning week- end risers, the campus is a lonely place. Although this is a great time to avoid crowds and survey·the damage done to the campus from the prev'ious night, it is also one of the safest times w walk into Schenectady. Waking up before brunch on Sunday, Kimberly Rohback and I went wandet·ing dmvntown in the opposite direc- tion from 13reuggers, looking for breakthst. A small diner on Ub- elty Street, calkdGat..:bo' s, :located a block frorn the shopping cmut of Jay Stl'eet, caught our atteJUion and beat out the other dining pos- sibilities simply by being open. The restamant owner, Frank Palumbo, recom1Hended for our re- view that we order the breakfast hottse specialty, ;two eggs with homefries, toast,jaice, coffee and sausage or bacon for$3.25. While he prepared our meal in the com- fortable. tl·iendly atmosphere. Mr. Palumbo talked about the recent l'eopen ing of Gar-bo? s two weeks ago alter a nrc closed the d inertwo years before. The Sunday we hap- pened to venture in was the first open Sunday since the reopening. Kim a11d I both enjoyed the meal and fotmd it to be less greasy titan typical diner food. We accepted the recommendation of sausage wirh our meals hecatase Mr. Pal umbo infonned us that they are what Gar-bo's is known for. The sausage wa>s in a hamburg.er \patty\ shape and as an interest- ing and delkious tv,ist contained caJ:~n.va:y seeds (the seeds found in i)'ehread). We both enjoyedit and. t{) the .credit of the restaurant, I let{ without a horrible stomach- ache which sausage tends to cause.

Men's .Swimming Make a Splash at St. Lawrence by DrewDavitian StqffWriter The weekend befoTe last the Swimming Dutchmen took on state, division, and national rival Hamilton. The team was plagued by sickness, and a few swimmers were only able to compete in one or two events. The meet got off to a slow start with a controversial disqualification of Union 200 medley relay team. This gave Continentals a fift:een-oomt lead after only the event. The 1000 free proved difficult for Dutchmen, Hamilton' Postles broke his previous school record by three seconds going a 9:43.79 and the other Hamilton swimmers took second, 136. In spite of the injuries ofjunior All-Ameriean.sprinter Bill Flick, and the sicknesses of freshman Kyle Shack and senior Matt Mauriello, who generally supply a lot of points for the Dutchmen, it was a good meet. Last year the Dutchmen beat Hamilton by one point ·in a dual meet, and by only thirty points at states. Union are only eight men on their roster, as opposed to our seventeen, set up the stage for a potetltial blow- out. The Union men e8$ilycruised to victory.

Men's Swimming Make a Splash at St. Lawrence by D:rewDavitian Staff Writer The weekend before last the Swimming Dutchmen took on state, division, and national rival Hamilton. The team was plagued by sickness, and a few swimmers were only able to compete in one or two events. Tile meet got off to a slow start with a 136. In spite ofthe injuriesofjunior All-American.sprillter Bill Flick, and the sicknesses of freshman Kyle Shack and senior Matt Mauriello, who generally supply a lot of points for the Dutchmen, it was a good meet. Last year the Dutchmen beat Hamilton by one point in a dl!al meet, and by only thirty points at states. Union are only eight men on their ioster, as opposed to our seventeen, set up the stage for a potential blow- out. The Union men easily cruised to victory.

The show was highlighted by the Women'steam's Junior Erin Wittes who won one hundred dollars and two TV s, but the na- tional exposure of the pro- gram will bring more inter- est in the athletics to the college. As the l993d 1999 season winds down, the two meets that Union trains for, States and Nationals,come closer. Taper has already started for most of the team and with it comes much faster times and much more excit- ing races. Everything is on schedule and all the loose ends are beingtied up. The Dutchmen have a good George Cuttita/SID shot at states, and an even controversial disqualification of the Union 200 medley relay team. This gave the Continentals a fifteen-})oint lead after only the first event. The 1000 free proved difficult for the Dutchmen, Hamilton's Postles broke his previous school rec<Jrd by three seconds going a 9:43.79 and the other Hamilton swimmers took second, third and forth. Senior Co- captain and All-American Dave Searles won the 200 free out huching the second place Hamilton swimmer by nine one hundredths of a se<:ond.

The 400 free relays picked up some points taking frrst and second, but the final meet score was Union 94 to Hamilton graduated s~ven seniors, five of which were AU-Americans.

Women Lose A Heartbreaker to the Saints by ltat:bel Bukowski Staff Writer The Union Swimming and Div- ing Dutcbwomen continue to struggle as tlley lost an extremely close meet t-() Saint Lawrence Uni- versity on Saturday with a score of129-113. This was the final dual meet of tile season for the Dutchwomen, and it was an ex- citing and emo- tional meet for all the swimmers. The meet came down to the final two events, the I 00 Breaststroke and the 400 Freestyle relay. If the women won the last re- lay, then they would have won the meet; 11ow- ever, they failed to capitalize and were touched out at the flllish, thus losing to Saint Lawrence.

Ski Team Races at Whiteface Crew Represents by Adarn BeJ:geron Contributing Writer Last Saturday and Sunday the Union College s.ki team raced at Whiteface Mountain, host of the 1980 world Olympics. The race, sponsmedby Paul:Sm,ith's College, included men and women's teams from eight New Y()rk colleges and universities, itacluding neighbors RPI and Skidmore. The Union women's team br~ught members, Claire Currie, Katherine Donnellan, Kathleeta Larney, and Sarah Kursen. Currie and Donnellan have in the past, consistently placed in the top three in both the slalom and giant slalom. This weekend bMh ofthem were competing to take home the num- ber one spot. In 1!1le slalom event on Saturday, D()nnellan did just that. Currie, after winning the ftrst run of the slalom, took an unfortu- nate falil in the sec()nd run, but was able to recover and still take the seventh place sp()t, With Kursen 's ninth place finish, the women's team took the overall first place tro- phy for the slal<lm event. The women then continued their per- formance on Sunday in the giant slalom event. Donnellan, once again vyingferftrst, was unable to catch Skidm&re' s number one skier, but placed ill a very solid second place. Kursenand Larneybothhad very commendable runs, and took eighth and tenth places. OveraU in the giant slalom the women placed close behind Colgate, but Kursen did not let that discourage h.er. She commented after the race, \We aH raced real well yesterday, and we won. To- day was not quite as smooth, and the Colgate women deserved the win. We'llbe back to get them next weekend though.\ The Men's team raced six racers in both events; Mike Fuller, Corey A Hen, Ben Wormer, Josh Talbert, Jim Bryant, and Adam Bergeron. Tea~n Captain, Fuller, has repeti- tively taken one of the top places in both events, competiNg fiercely with the top Clarkson skiers. With Wormer andAllen'scontinual fin- ishes around the tenth spot, the Men's team can normally place ahead ofRPI and Colgate, but still close behind Clarkson. In Saturday's slalom, after a superb first run, Fuller blew out of the course and was unable to fmish his second run. This left Wonner's eighth, Allen's ninth, and Bergeron's twenty-first place fm- · ish, to put the men in a close third behind Clarkson and Colgate. On Sunday in the giant slalom., Fuller started the morning with a real close fourth behind three Clarkson men. Ill his second run he placed :fifth, and his combined times left him four places from first. Allen and Wormer both raced exceptionally resulting with four- teenth and eighteenth places. Overall in the giant slalom, the men . were able to place ahead of Colgate, but still unable to triumph o\Ver Clarkson.· Wonner was quoted after his fi- nal run, \We are coming up with consistent results, which we like. We can always do better though, and we'll compete for first next weekend.\ With an overall suc- cessful weekend for the Union ski team, they move closer to cinch- ing a spot at regionals. Their suc- cess this coming weekend at La- brador Mountain will determine their future for the season. by John Carbone Staff Writer That's right boys and girls, the 1999 Adirondack Indoor Erg Sprints were held this past week- end up in Saratoga, at Skidmore College. For those of you not fa- miliar with the word \erg\ let me fill you in. An erg is more commonly known as a rowing machine. An erg is also a tool of pain, created by some sadist seeking new means of torture. It's the 20th century equivalent of an l8 1 h century stretching rack. The basic concept of the competition is to erg 2000 meters as quickly as one is capable of, and that's just what the Union College Crew Team did this past weekend. To give all of you non-rowers an idea of what this 2000m piece is I ike, it's somewhat akin to volunteering to be run over by a truck. about a dozen times. It's not uncommon to hear of people collapsing, vom- iting, blacking-out, curling up in the fetal position and crying, etc. dur- ing a piece. Uniol'! rowers, how- ever, are a tough (if not slightly dis- turbed) lot and they fought hard and brought home a number of medals. The first two of these medals came in the novice men's competi- tion. First year rower Jeff \This ain't no dairy cow\ Hoffman led the way with a staggering time of 6:29.5, blowing away the fielJ and earning himself a gold medal. Sophomore novice Jamie \Dill Pickles\ Slocum used all ofhis 6' 5\ frame to pull a 6:42.9 and bring home a bronze medal. Polish won- der-dog Remi Drozd wasn't far be- hind Slocum, with a time of6:44.4, placing him in the fourth slot. The day's activities continued and as noon approached a sense of excitement filled the air. Senior Mike \Schlee\ Sherwood ap- proached the erg for the Varsity Lightweight event. Shivers ran down on-lookers' spines as the al- ways well-groomed Sherwo()d grasped the erg handle. Those shivers and tingles continued throughout the 6 minutes and 3 8 seconds that Mike pulled. While this wasn't a personal best for Sherwood, he was pleased with the result, a gold medal. Perhaps more than anything, Sherwood and Hoffman's perfor- mances have taught us all that good, clean living, growing up on a farm, and tossing cows around creates strong rowers. Now let's not forget about the Union women. Novice women's captain, and nm ing powerhousr:. Amie \Ps)cKo\ Csiszer stepped up to the challenge and pulh:d a strong 7:48, earning her~elf a bronLe medal. An obviously tired Csisz.er had this to say following the piece, \I feel like hell. It's such a test ofvv\illpower it's so mental. The only thing that kept me going was the cheering of my team- mates.\ Not to be outdone. Varsity Cap- tain Suzanna ''Get your groove on'' Ryan pulled an inspiring 7:36, snag- ging a silver medal in her event. Th~ Ja;. as a whole was a tre- mendous ::.uccl:ss fur thl: Uniun team. A number ()fpersonal bests were achieved and the team proved that they'll be contenders in the spring racing season. Perhaps freshman Jeff Hoffman summed it up best: \The Adirondack Erg Sprints ... more fun than killing cows_\ Dutchmen Fall to Williams; Prepare for Home Stretch by David Brooks Sports Editor Last Wednesday the Shooting Dutchmen retumed to action in a non-league battle against power- house Williams.

Aaron Galletta added 20 points, while Dave Musella had 11 points and Ryan Murray chipped in 10 points. Jason Manning had six rebounds and Galletta grabbed five boards himself. After the game, Galletta noted, \We played pretty well in the first half, but our defense and re- bounding co sted us the game in the second half.\ Despite t!J.e loss, Union remains one of the best pe- rimeter shooting teams in the country.

They also have a talented group of players with Groelz averaging 14.9 PPG, Musella with 14.9 PPG, Galletta with 14.2 PPG and Murray with I 0.6 PPG.

Somewhere we have not been since the 93-94 sea- son.\ Union's playoffs hopes are real and can be accomplished by beating Rensselaer, Skidmore, Hobart, St. Lawrence and Clarkson. Although Union has defeated all these teams except St. Lawrence, they are hardly easy wins. Rensselaer always plays tough against Union, no matter what their record is. Currently Hobart and Clarkson are hovering around the cellar of the UCAA with Rensselaer only three points behind Union. Speaking about St. Lawrence, Galktta said, \They are a tough team, but we think we can back at them on our home court.\ each averaging4.5 rebounds a game.

Track Gears up for UCAA Championship by Dennis Sanabia Contributing Writer The Union track team has had the last week offto prepare for the up coming UCAA championship meet. The week off gave 'the athletes a chance to take care of their injuries and get rid of their sicknesses. Hopefully they will be able to stay healthy and compete as a complete and healthy team. Recently some of the members of the team were asked the question, \How would you describe the feelings you get before you compete in an event?\ The following are responses to this question from some of the competitors: Peter Flynn: \Depends on the mce! The 800-meter run is a nerve wr-ecking event because you have to get out fast and keep a fast pace throughout the entire race. With longerraces, like the 5,000, I get a chance to set a pace and relax.

Last week, Union faced-offto both Trinity and Wesleyan. In two well fought games, Union went down playing two very experienced teams, with Weselyan wining 6~1 and then Trinity taking control by the score of3-0. Despite the losses, star senior forward Sarah Moss talliedherthird goal inthree games.

Never- theless, something happened to me while l tuned into the NBA games during the rest of the weekend. I saw a bit ofthe Knicks and Heat play on Sunday and felt that the game was quite boring; the play· ers were out of S)illC and the .fans were not even into the games. I think other people will agree with me when I say I would rather be watching a game with the number one or two college basketball teams, the UCONN Huskies and the Duke Blue Devils, than an ordinary NBA game. My true feeling is that the NBA does not even get excit- ing until the second round of the playoffs, while college basketball gives fans the opportunity to see: great conference rivalries and amaz~ ing upsets all year long. College Basketball was ,very thankful for the NBA lockout. Thnrughout this time, the NCAA gained many new fans and the rec- ognition it needs to promote the: upcoming tournament in March. Coming from Maryland, I am a big time Terps fan, and this season the Terps have been ranked the high- est in school history. It has been great to see Maryland in the top The Skating Dutchwomen played the whol~ game dominating the ice with the defense putting much pressure on Skidmore's main goal scorers.

Yet, it's not just Maryland that keeps me tuned in to College Bas- ketball. Any day of the week, you can turn on ESPN and watch a game, with the arenas jammed- packed with students, faculty, and other fans. If anyone has been to a· college basketball game, they know the feeling and the atmo- sphere is probably the most unique than in any other sport. The whole aspect of college basketball is so different from the NBA, in that the players know their being looked at by professional scouts and try to play their best, with total team ef- forts. The college players make .it all very meaningful and worthwhile for the fans and themselves. Michael Jordan, during his retirement press conference, recalled his time at North Carolina and felt it was the best experience of his life, which gave him the motivation for the NBA. On the other hand, in the NBA, with a good amount players already making millions of dollars, with theirwholefinanciallives set; they try hard for that championship tro- phy , but if they don't win one, they really have no reason to be demoralized or even heart broken. ' Right now college basketball is at its prime, with many teams look- ing to find their way into next month's tournament. Look for the College of Charl~ston to push their way up the ranks, along with Big East teams of Miami and Syracuse to become major threats fortop ten teams. Beaware ofKanas and Ohio State too.

A Perfect Mix ofCompetition by David Weiner Sports Editor 1 will venture to make the gener- alization that througllout high school, the majority of people par- ticipate in some type of sports. Whether it be baseball, hockey, football, lacrosse, ballet, or a myriad of other possibilities, people took part in some type of team sport. However, college is quite different than highschool. At the college level, only the cream of high school athletes have the abil- ity to continue their athletic careers inter•collegiately. While it may be the aspiration of many to continue with athletics, unfortunately, not everyone possesses tlle talent to do so. For these people, their saving grace is the intramural athletics. This seeqts to be the perfect r-e- placement for the team sports many college students so desper- ately miss. The hard work and mo- notony of practice is eliminated and onc.e a week for five or six weeks each term, various teams competing in a variety of sports congregate and compete. While the competition may not be as ,fierce as Division I or Divi- sion III college athletics, it is com- petition nonetheless and is com- petition in a non-competitive envi- ronment tliat allows everyone to relax .and \'ave a good time. If a person does compete on a college ·level team, cb.ances are they can only participate in one sport f'or each sport seemingly has year-round training. However, for thosepeoplewho play intramurals, you can not only participate in a number of sports throughout the year, but you can play a number of sports within each term. It is quite possible to fill each night of your week with a different intramural contest in a different sport each night. This is the beauty of intramurals. Think about it. It is possible to play soccer and foot- ball in the fall; hockey, broomball, and basketball in the winter; and ultimate frisbee, softball, and Ia- · crosse in the spring. That is eight sports as opposed to one, all with .. out the hassle of practice but with all the enjoyment of playing games and having fun. What more could a person ask for?

Over the past four weeks Dave Smith has been. the most consistant player and scorer on the team, skating hard every time he takes the ice.

The Dutchmen, last iD: the ECAC,..hadachancetopick up some much-needed ground against two teams that Union had decent success against earlier in the season. At Brown on January 8, the Dutchmen and the Bears tied 3-3. The following evening at Harvard~ the Dutchmen began the third period up 3-2. However, in what would be the frrst of numer- ous troubles in recent third peri- ods~ Union gave up two unan- swered goals and Harvard came away with a 4·3 victory. With the team's playoff chances dwindling (the top ten teams in-the league make the playoff cut), Union faced-off against the Crimson in the traditionai Founder's Day g3!Ue wl}ich was also carried on the New England Sports Network as the ECAC Game ofthe Week. The Dutchmen, who were criti- cized last weekend for not clearirig out the crease area in front of netminder Brandon Snee, were burned again when at 4:00 of the period,. Harvard's Jeff Stonehouse put a rebound of his own shot past Sneeto.givethe Crimson a 1-0 lead. The Dutchmen did not give up When 11Iey fell behind early. Just 2: 14later, with Union on apower- play, sophomore David Smith picked up a rebound from a Jeff Sproat wrist shot and frred it in past· Harvard goaltender J.R. Prestifilippo to tie the score. Moments later, again on the power-play, Smithappearedto give Union the lead as be knocked the puck into the net. However, the referee ruled that the net had come off of its moorings and the goal was disallowed. During the second andthirdpe- riods, botbUsion and Harvard had good' opportunities to take the lead. Snee stopped nine shots on three Harvard 'power-plays in the second period. One of those saves, Snee stopped Scott Turco with just 3:42 Jeft.in the th:if.d period. Turco, who was to the right of Snee 's crease, .one-timed a pass fr()m the left wing. However, Snee stopped the shot with his glove preserving the tie. Late in' the third period, with just eight seconds left in regulation time, Snee stopped fo~er prep- school teammate Chds Bala' s one- tinter from about 5 feet out. The gameendedinal-1 tie, with Sn.ee making over 30 saves forthe sixth ·time this season. The goaltender felt the tie was a team effort. \I owe it aU to them. They played well. They play{ld our systems. They played the defensive-zone coverage that we neC(ied to play,\ said Snee. Union head coach Kevin Sneddon was pleased with both Snee's and the team' s.play. '' [Snee] hasn ~t gotten en()ugh credit be .. cause we haven't been putting [wins] up there. He's been the backbone of the team. He's kept us. in when we wen1n'tplaying well, and has been oU:tstanding when · we have been playing well,\ he said. The tie kept Unio11's playoff hopes. alive. Entering the Brown game on Saturday .night, the Dutchmen were fourpoints behind Brown (wh() lost Friday night to RPI 7-3) and Harvard, who were tied for 9 111 place in the ECAC.

Sp9rtS ar.on~a~rlriensis • February 11, 1999 • Page 23 Skating Dutchmen Keep Playoff Hopes Alive UnionHeadsNorthtoFaceECAC's Top Two Tet~ms This Weekend byJonatban Gasthalter Editor-in-Chief Emeritus The Skating Dutchmen knew that this past weekend's games against Harvard and Brown were arguably the most important ones of the season. The Dutchmen, last in the ECAC, had a chance to pick up some much-needed ground against two teams that Union had decent success against earlier in the season. At Brown on January 8, the Dutchmen and the Bears tied 3-3. The following evening at Harvard, the Dutchmen began the third period up 3-2. However, in what would be the first of numer- ous troubles in recent third peri- ods, Union gave up two unan- swered goals and Harvard came away with a 4-3 victory. With the team's playoff chances dwindling (the top ten teams in the league make the playoff cut), Union faced-off against the Crimson in the traditional Founder's Day game which was also carried on the New England Sports Network as the ECAC Game of the Week. The Dutchmen, who were criti- cized last weekend for not clearing out the crease area in front of netminder Brandon Snee, were burned again when at 4:00 of the period, Harvard's Jeff Stonehouse put a rebound of his own shot past Snee to give the Crimson a 1-0 lead. The Dutchmen did not give up when they fell behind early. Just 2: 141ater, with Union on a power- play, sophomore David Smith picked up a rebound from a Jeff Sproat wrist shot and fired it in past Harvard goaltender J.R. Prestifllippo to tie the score. Moments later, again on the power-play, Smith appeared to give Union the lead as he knocked the puck into the net. Howeve~, the referee ruled that the net had carne off of its moorings and the g()al was disallowed. During the second and third pe- riods, both Union and Harvard had good opportunities to takethe lead. Snee stopped nine shots on three Harvard power-plays in the second period. One of those saves, Snee stopped Scett Turco with just 3:42 left in the third period. Turco, Y~ho was to the right of Snee's crease, one-timedapass from the left win ,g. However, Snee stopped the sh<!lt wi1h his glove preserving the tie. Late in the third period, with jllst eight seconds left in regulation time, Snee stopped former prep- school teammate Chris Bala'sone- timer from about 5 feet out. 1he game ended in a 1-1 tie, with Snee making over 30 saves for the sixth time this season. The goaltender felt the tie was a team eff<nt \'I owe it all to them. They played well. They played our systems. They played the defensive-z<>ne coverage that we needed to play,\ said Snee. Union head coach Kevin Sneddon was pleased with both Snee'sandtheteam'splay. \[Snee] hasn't gotten enough credit be- cause we haven't been putti11g [wins] up there. He's been the backbone of the team. He's k:ept us in whenweweren'tplayingwell, and has been outstanding when we have been playing well,\ lle said. The tie kept Union's playoff hopes alive. Entering the Brown game on Saturday night, tile Dutchmen were four points bellilld Brown (who lost Friday night to RPI 7-3) and Harvard, who were tied for 9th place in the ECAC. Saturday night, Union did not come out with the same intensity it showed the previous evening against Harvard. The Bears drew first blood early in the period dur- ing a delayed penalty against the Dutchmen. James Duval put a shot on Snee, who made the save, but the rebound was gathered up by Jeff Lawler and he poked it past Snee. Brown's Adrian Smith in- creased the Bear lead to 2-0 at 10: 17 of the pe- riod. Union fi- nally got in on the .scoring act with just under three minutes to go in the period when Joel Bond, with Union on the power-play, fired a slap-shot from the point cutting the Brown lead in half. and a goaltender i~t~rference pen- alty to Smith. After the Dutchmen players and coaching staff seeni11gly ended tlleir protest of the p<Jor call, play Fesumed. Referee 1'ay lor, with 35 seconds to go in the period ,ybistled Union's Mason Ander- son for slashing ill the neutral :zone. The Bear's Michael Bent scored on thepower;play and went don't get me wrong. It was the fact that we didn't have everyone show up that lost ws the game,\ he said. Tile Dutchmen ( 1-11-2 in the ECAC, 3-18-3 overall) travel to the North Country this weekend to take on Clarkson and St. Lawrence, the two tied-for-first place teams in the ECAC. Sophomore forward Clark Jones feels that the Dutch- men could surprise both Clarkson While the first period saw only two penalties and a clutch and grab style of Assistant captain Ryan Campbell ~waits the face-off during Friday night's 1-/ tie 'li!fifz Harvard hockey, the second period was the opposite.

. ! 1. Campus News . ..!.- (([mtCnrbiensh;• February 18, L999 ·• Page 3 .Scblichtmann Discusses the Truth Behind the Movie ThenSchlichtmann met with stu- dents, staff and faculty members in the Strauss Loange of the Reamer Ca111pus Center specifically to discuss A Civil Action, the movie. An Intellectual Enrichment Grant (IEG}was obtained through a cem.- bined effort betWeen the Environ- mental Society and the Geology Club which helped subsidize the cost for interested students to see A Civil Action in the theater on February6. After this open-discussion ses- sion, reporters from var,ious news stations then interviewed Schlichtmann. Before leaving Union College, Schlicbtmann had spoken to news teams from Channel6, Channel tO, Channel13, Fox News, National Public Radio, The Gazette, and The Times Union. .Schlichtmann's seminar was then given at a very crowded Nott Memorial at 7:30PM. He told his story ofthe Woburn trial, and informed everyone ofhis plans for the future, and how he will go about his business in a more mediated fashion, rather than fight- ing in a court room. Kelly Lynch, an anchorwoman from one.ofthe manynews stations on site at the Reamer Campus Cen- ter, said,\Anytime you have some- one that has such national atten- tion, it is news worthy. It's great to have someone come here who is so involved with the environment, .•. continued from page 1 especially very close to this area, as Woburn {Massachusetts) and Toms River {New Jersey) are not that far away, and Pittsfield (Mas- sachusetts) is just across the bor- der.\ She continued, \It's wonderfill to have someone who has dedi- cated his life against battling facts, who has helpecl so many pe()ple in the :process, come to our reg,ion.'' During Schlichtmann's speecl1, he expressed how. his life had changed through such an experi~ ence, and how he will go about his business without wasting so much money and time. He also asserted his feelings on how both the novel and movie accurately were able to tell the story. In a light, humorous tone, Schlichtmann began his lecture with a story about how his mother thought the best thing about the movie, A Civil Action, was that John Travolta was playing her son. · Schlichtmann said,\ I felt that the movie was a powerful retelling of the story, and my hope is that people see the film, and also read the book I think the book has a real perplex- ity to it and has the ability to tell the story and all of its complexities. The book really had the truth and integrity about that experience.\ He also told how his life has changed from such a long and te· dious nine-year court ca::;e. He said,\We learned a tremen- dous amount on this extended jour- ney. We learned the truth about these chemicals and the conduct that kills. But ultimately, we ]earned the importance of the truth itself, or life itself, and that is the ultimate gift for everyone in this world to share.'' \One of the points to mi;lke about Woburn is that communi- ties can't do itontheir,owrt. Com- panies can't, and many won't. We really have to do it together. So it starts with the community, and no one is going to care more about the community than the community itsel£\ ScJtlichtmann a'lso said that there is not a community in the world that is immune to all ofthe bacteria and diseases that exist today. His message was that there is not a community that does not have the threats that Woburn had. He said, \The real question that every community must ask is are they going to be actively in- volved in their future, or are they going to wake up Hke the Woburn community to find out that their past has come to haunt them.\ Before Schlichtmann ended his lecture with a question and answer period, he explained to his listeners that h.e is a changed man. \I'm married and have two boys. This experience was a great lesson that has helped me. It taught me about the world and about myself. This has made me ''In the Hot Seat'' at AEPi by Phillip Leef and Michael Kreiner Contributing Writers This past Thursday evening Professor Fox. took \the hot seat\ of Alpha Epsilon Pi to discuss the Clinton Scandal, but more pre- Ciselyhowthepresident's dealings with Monica Lewinsky relate to his relationship with Women's groups. When one ponders the scandal that left millions of Americans in shock and millions more in com- plete disgust, one does not usu- ally examine the reasons why some side with our commander in chief, and others loathe his very exist- ence. In the case of Republicans ver- sus Democrats, it is evident repre- sentatives from each side feel an allegiance towards party lines, yet why then do Women's groups constantly find themselves in to- tal support of Clinton, no matter the political party involved? Some argue that Women's groups ate hypocritical in their stance on the issue, for they are supporting a man who blatantly abuses his power for his own sexual desires. As, Patricia Ireland, president of NOW,. stated in late Januaryofthis year, ''While we do not know the truth of the allega- tions made against President Clinton, we want to state clearly our belief that it would be a misuse of power for any public official to Cory Silken/TC Professor Richard Fox discusses the Clinton scandal. have a sexual relationship with an employee or intern.\ In an age when women are gaill- ing more and more respect in a mul· titude oftoday's fields, the actions of ML Clinton t()wards Ms. Lewinsky revealed a relationship of deceit and manipulation for whiclt seemed to revert to a lifestyle base<! on male dominance. Others ques- tion the validity of morals that stem from a man who has shown the na· tion he is incapable when it comes to interpersonal extramarital rela- tionships. For many the difficulty lies in Clinton's unfaithfulness t<> his wife. Many Americans still do find the vows of marriage sa- cred and are of the opinion that he has broken a seal that can never be mended. It is due to these actions that his family has been severely affected. However, the group did not only·discuss the Women's issue. In actuality, the most debated topic was whether or not people should and could separate poli- tics of the president from his ev- eryday social life. In Clinton's case it is not easy to make this distinction due to the tremen- a more rounded and better human heing, and I am very thankful.\ He is now working with commu- nities in many different places, in- cluding Toms Ri:ver,New Jersey. He said,\Toms River is very much like Woburn, as we are again deal- ing with many of the same issues. But this time, we are not fighting with, or against, the companies. We are actually workingin a joint effort to understand the path we must take together, .so that we can have a fu- ture.\ Seth Horwitz ('01), said,\It was great that such a nati()nally known speaker could come here and relay his message in a story-telling and conversational-type lecture. He was able to transmit his message in a way that everyone could relate to.\ Schlichtmann 's review of the nine- year court case, entitled \Envirori- mentaiJustice for All?\ was just one of many seminars that are part of the \Water and the Law\ lecture series. Professor Garver said,\It is won- derful that we were able to get Jan Schlichtmann to come,to Union Col- lege, but this is the Water and the Law series, and we do hope that the college community does become more aware of water in our lives.\ The next two lectures the Envi- ronmental Studies Pr()gram is bring- ing in are just as relevant, but more in a local sense. The next speaker, William S. Helmer, will talk on February 24 about a case that has defined what rivers can be canoed on and what rivers can be used for recreation in the Adirondacks. The third and last speaker ofthe \Water and the Law\ seminar se- ries will be on March 9, and will be given by Willard D. Roth, Ph.D., who is the President of the Great Sacandaga Lake Association. Roth's case deals with the com pli- cated battle between local, state, and federal interests surrounding the Great Sacandaga Lake. Michael Lewis, President of the Environmental Society, said, \Jan Schlichtmann will not only benefit those students who are interested in pursuing environmental law, but will also encourage them to go on and fight for environmental trag- edies. What lam hoping for is that he will inspire others to be a little more self-conscious of their own actions.'' Jan Schlichtmann's stop at Union College, which is part ofhis national tour, was funded by the Minerva Committee, with addi- tional support from the Environ- mental Studies Department and the President's office. Schlichtmann spoke of the ha1111 industrial poHution can cause, but also of the infliction the judicial system can perpetrate on people, families, and communities. In his presentation, he proposed new models for debatable resolu- tions that preserves justice while avoiding injury to both the fi- nances and the reputations of the parties involved. Abbe's to Pay for Renovation by Erin Connolly Staff Writer Thanks to the generous gift of Robert T. and Virginia 0. Abbe of Kattskill Bay on Lake George, Col- lege Relations will be housed in a breath-taking historic building. In honor of the generous gift made by the Abbe's, the historic house, for- merly known as Parker-Rice, will be renamed Abbe Hall. The house is located at the cor- ner of Lenox Road a11d Union A v- enue. The Abbe's are very con- cerned with keeping the house within its historic natLJre. \We envision a gracious building for alu!I!ni and College personnel with the comfortable decor of its time,\ stated Mr. Abbe. Mrs. Abbe, who has been a mem- ber of theN ational Trust for Historic Preservation for over 20 years, will personally be seeingt<> the prelimi- nary and final restoration plans. Work on Abbe Hall will begin in the spring. Mr. Abbe, a member of the board of trustees, envisions that the house will not <mly be valuable to Union College but also to the com- munity surrounding it He explains, \The house and grounds have great potential and once the project is completed, they will asset to both Union and the neighborhood.\ President Hall also shares Abbe's strong feelings about the house. \After careful renovation, this grand house, which will be called Abbe Hall, wil1 provide a comfort- able and beautiful work environ- ment for College staff and a home base for returning alumni. In addi- tion, it will be a remarkable historic treasure for the community.\ Union College, over the last year, has taken a strong stand to strengthen the physical attitude of both the college and the commu- nity around it. With the transfor- mation of Parker-Rice into Abbe Hall Union is taking one larger step into Union's prosperous future. A future where places like Abbe Hall will become the no1111 and not an exception. ~-------------------------------------------------- dous overlap of such activities. In this overwhelming age ofmedia cov- erage, Americans have been ex- posed to excessive detailed infonna- tiort concerning Clint()n and his per~ sonal dealings. To ask the nation to make a separation between the is- sues would be asking for people to ignore a plethora ofknow ledge that they have become privy to on a daily basis. The event began at 7:30PM and lasted approximately one hour. The atmosphere was casual in hopes of fostering a discussion and ob- taining opinions from the group. There was no lecturing, only stimulating conversation between students and Professor Fox. Dur- ing a busy weeknight so close to midterms, it is often not easy to hold informal discussions about topics that engulf current events. Yet, the number of students in at- tendance seemed totally sub- merged in conversation.

This area was not decided upon in the Dayton Agreement, leaving its contrOl in limbo. The popula- tion, which was \99.5% Serb,\ was put under \international supervi- sion,.\ controlled by the American government that superceded local law. Kat's job was to ask the local government what needs to be done in terms of schooling, sewage, and other needs of the community. Next, she had to obtain the money and the proper organization to do the work that she was assigned to accomplish. \I had to bring all of those tasks together,\ said Kat, as explained that she oversaw thirty organiza- tions and $60 million to revive Brcko \for the return of the dis- placed Serbs.\ She worked for what was called the \Office of the High Represen- tative,\ which assisted the govern- ment in maintaining the civilian as- pects ofthe Dayton Agreement. After her informative discus- sion, Kat opened the floor up for questions from the attentive audi- ence. One student asked if there were any sort of conflicts or prob- lems amongst the different relief groups who were working with her on this project. _ Kat responed by saying that the \struggles between the NGO's could get nasty.\ There were different philoso- phies held by the different i?eople and it was, in some respects, her job to make sure that the friction and strife was kept to a minimum because their goal was not to im- pose their values on one another but to assist the needy people of .... continuedftompage 1 Union Debate Team Competes at Tufts by Courtney Hayden Staff Writer This past weekend the Union College Debate Team attended a tournament in Massachusetts at Tufts University.

Students Face \\Veils House ARC 3.45°/o Tuition Hike· byJimDeWan News Editor Students will be paying 3.45% more next year to attend their classes, sleep in their beds, and eat at Upperclass or West. For the 1999-2000 school year, full time undergraduate students will pay an increased comprehensive tuition rate of$30,566. This rate includes an action tuition rate of $23,892, $3,492 charge for housing, $2,982 for meals and a $200 activity fee. The next academic year rriarks the frrst time that full tuition will exc.eed the $30,000 per year mark. This year's tuition with all things in- cluded is 3.45% less than next year's rate, standing at $29,546, $1,020. The cl.oud of an unavoidable tu- ition increase does carry a silver lining for students. The 3.45% tu- ition increase marks the seventh consecutive year with a percent- age decrease of tuition and the lowest actual dollar increase in tu- ition since the 1986-87 school year. This l>udget was drawn up and put together by the Planning and Priorities Committee and formally approved without much delibera- tion by the Board <>f Trustees at their winter meeting 011 Friday, Feb- ruary 4. Many of the trustees spoke about the budget at the open reception with stude11ts, com- menting on the ease with :which our budget is passed, while uoting the difficulty that many other schools face when dealing with th.eir bud- gets. Many trustees me.ntioned that Union does a superior job in maintaining its l>udgetand not fall- ing into debt. Union'stotalexpen- ditures total $76,652,000. Professor Anton Warde of the German Departmeut, one ofthetwo faculty trustees, raved about Presi- dent Hull's diligence in maintain- ing a successful, bala11ced budget, saying that, \Each year President Hull does an excellent job in over- seeing the budget pwcess, and looking out for the college.\ Student trustee Jon Zandrnan was also very pleased with this year's budget. He was especially excited that the Student Activities Fee will be annually raised, in pro- portion with the tuition increase. He suggested this at the Board of Trustees meeting, and all the trust~ ees, as well as Hull were very re- ceptive to it. As a result of this, each student will pay a $207 Stu- dent Activity Fee, which allows Sl4,000 moretobe allocated to stu- dent clubs. \l was very excited to · include this in the budget,\ Zandman sai<l. The increased tuition will help to combat increased fees and costs · as well as other projects. Accord'- ing to the Department of Finances' handout \Budget Highlights,\ hourly wages, faculty salaries, as well as administrative salaries, are g<>ing to increase 3.5% beginning July 1, based upou merit and an inflation rate of approximately 5%. Next year'sbudget also includes plans to renovate and improve many buildings on campus. ~ Davidson and Fox Halls are both scheduled to undergo improve- ments, replacing the lounge win- dows and doors. Silliman Hall will have four exit windows recon- structed. The stucco and main entrance colUillns <JfSteinmetz Hall will be replaced, and the masonry <Jn the President's House will un- dergo a much needed repair. Hosts by Marin Richardson Contributing Writer On Thursday, February 4, Union's cotrununity involvement theme house h()sted members of the Schenectady Association of Retarded Citizens for an evening of bingo. ARC is an organization dedicated to pr<>viding assistance to mentally retarded people and their families in the Schenectady area. The organization works to help make its clients as self-suffi- cient as possible by arranging group residences, locating appro- priate employment and organizing social events for the adult partici- pants. The members lead active, productive lives and are brought into contact with a large group of peers with the help of the activi- ties sponsored by ARC. The sup- portive environment and group liv- ing situations provided by ARC contribute to the sense .of self- worth evident in the association's clients. At this event, many of the cli- ents who came were already famil- iar to the stud~nts who Qrganized the event. The evening was a con- tinuation of a recently established Wells House-ARC relationship ini- tiated by sophomore Chad Robertson. During fall term, the two groups came together for a Halloween dance that became a topic of conversation during the evening of bingo that brought the organizations back together .. ARC clients looked at pictures of them- selves in costume hanging around the house and addressed one of the students who attended the dance as \Bat Girl.\ ARC and Wells House members cheered for each other, .discussed the prizes awarded, and engaged in some good-natured joking. Chad stated that he was glad to be a part of these events because \they help empower the clients by making them feel like they'reworth something, and at the same time they serve as a reality check for the students who are involved.'' Many of those who participated expressed satisfaction and a sin- cere desire to work on bringing the groups tog.ether again. Wells House Manager Melissa Sullivan expressed similar sentiment, say- ing that \the event went very well, everyone had a fantastic time.\ • tl tl e v t d v p r A v p t p s tl d tl 0 b 8.i T n 1 tr if gJ bl u: gJ a' sc: ni a1 m a tr SJ Pl h, a I sc ht w R pl th

Speaker Announced For Founders' Day Addressing the Issue of Black Supremacy Profess(}r Jon Sterngass Addresses Post-Civil War Relations in New York Astronomer Yervant Terzian to f/isit Union by Gina Campanella Staff Writer by Jessiea Zuehlke Stflf/ Writer Have you ever wondered about the composition .of comets, ,or more inte11sely about the beginning of thesolar system? Chances are, the estalllishment of Mission Contour will not only answer, but link these two questions together. On Thurs~ day~ February 25, Yervant Terzian will guide the campus towards ex·~ plallations to these profound que~ ries. As away to celebrate Founders' Day at Union, the. college welcomes Astronomer, professor, and writer Yenrant Terzian to Memorial ChaJlel. At 11 :30AM, Terzian will speak about his visions for the twenty~frrst century, encompass~ ing ibis dreams of the future and the value ofeducation. . 'Terzian is the Chainnan of the Astronomy Dept at Cornell Uni~ versity and is the James A. Weeks Professor ofPhysical Sciences. He is also the directorofthe Pew Und·ergraduate Science Education Program and NASA-New York State Space Grant at Cornell. Past research of Terzian includes thepllysic~ ofthe intercellularme~ dium, HII regions, the evolution of the l~te type stars, and the physics of planetary nebulae. More recently, he has studied binary g;:tlaxies, colliding galax:ies and galaxies with double nuclei. Terzian has been associated with the Arecibo Observatory since 19<i5, mainly studying radio as- tronomy.

Ask again if any of them are thinking about grad1t1ation and most either stare blankly, burst into tears or run away in fear. With snow still on the ground, June seems very, very far away, But there are a select groups seniors who, have since the begin~ ning of fall term, been thinking abowt just one thing-commence~ ment. The senior class officers and a select number of seniors are en- trusted to .select a commencement speaker, aided by the guidance of President Hull. Tile members of this committee hav~ been hard at work. First they approached Robert Coles, a child sociologist and psychologist who helped to a ... ··;gregated a school witb ttJe help of a young girl name Ruby, Cole and Ruby had spoken previously at Founders' Day and the t\.vo seemed a perfect .choice. However, no one was able to contact Ruby and it was the pair thattllecommencement com:nlittee wanted. Choice two turned out to be Dens Kerns Goodwin. Goodwin is one of the few presidential his~ torians in the country. She fre- quently appears on CNN and other news stations. In addition, she spoke at Union four years ago. However, she was forced to de- cline Union's invitation, as she had a prior engagement. The com- mittee went back to the drawing board and, with a connection from a fellow senior, selected Ben Stein, a comedian, as the next candidate. However, Stein was not issued an invitation due to the fact that that the comedian did not fit the de- scription of past commencement speakers. Candidate number four was then proposed, Jeff Greenfield. Greenfield attended law school with President Hull and is cur~ rently a political analyst, substi- tuting for Larry King when King is unable to appear on television. Sadly, Greenfield already had a conflicting commitment and was unable to accept the invitation. And thus th.e search currently continues. While seniors seem concerned with other issues, many expressed surprise and con- fusiQll when asked about the lack of commencement speakers. Senior Caryn Anapolsky ex- pressed bewilderment, \Wow! I would have thought they had someone by now.\ The majority of seniors shared Anapolsky's opinion. Most were surprised to learll,.Qiatcomm encement waswith- out a speaker and that the search was taking so long. As to the sort . of speaker seni()r desired most de- sired someone who was somewhat famous and a charismatic speaker. Suggestions included Howard Stern, Alice Walker and Mario . Cumo. However, such choices are unlikely to be pursued as com- mencement speakers receive an honorary degree and no monetary compensation. This creates a hurdle as to capturing high price speakers, such as celebrities. So where does that leave the wonder- ing seniors and frustrated search committee? Senior class president Josh Chaplin commented on the sort of speaker the committee was ultimately searching for, \The speaker does not necessarily have to be a popular personality, but rather a dynamic speaker. Ulti- mately, I would like the speaker to deliver a speech the will be remem- ber and that will allow the graduat- ing class and their families and . friends to leave Union with a posi- tive attitude.\ (Note: Part two of this article, app.earing in next week's issue, will discuss tile his- tory and process of speaker selec- tion as undertaken by the President's office,) Cory Silken/TC Professor Sterngass emphatically delivered his speech begin to visit Saratoga, white southerners. Professor Sterngass used quo~ tations from both books and dia- ries written in that antebellum pe- riod to exemplify the stereotypical race relations in this area during that turbulent time period. The southerners had many pre- conceived notions about how they expected to be treated by the many African~American workers in Saratoga. Women were mostly reserved to domestic women's jobs; however, many ofthe waiters in many ofthe affluent Saratoga hotels were black. The majority of these hotels would not hire white waiters and the black waiters who were hired in their place were among some of the most prominent African-American's in Saratoga society. Southern visitors to such resorts as Saratoga began to create an im~ age ofthemselves in the north; this became the image of the soutllerner. :?rofessor Sterngass extracted the title for his speech from a diary of a young southern woman stay- ing in Saratoga. She commented on how it was strange to see blacks relaxing and making their own decisions and that it was strange to think, \the blacks are supreme?\ This is just one of the many examples Professor Stemgass pro~ vided of recorded interaction be- tween southern visitors and blacks in Saratoga. The speech was interesting and well delivered; however, attendance was disappointing. All those who decided not to attend cheated themselves of a very interesting perspective of antebellum society. Student Forum Notes The Student Forum met on Feb- ruary 9 at 9:00PM. The ski club has moved $400 to its travelling budget. Motions were approved to give Fiji $500 for8!eir annual Big Brothers/Big Sisters volleyball tournament and $4879.75 to women's ice hockey for their travel · budget. The proposal for the change to the common lunch hour was not approved by the AAC. Another proposal is in the works. Trustee meetings went well. The finance committee approved a $7 dollar increase in student activity fees. The student affairs commit- tee discussed admissions and sophomore rush. The academic affairs committee decided that the trimester system should be per- fected before being compared to the semester system. The National Panhellenic council advisor will be visiting Union from Feb. 28 to March I. Panhel will soon be transitioning to new officers and meeting with all sorority houses. Theme houses are still recruiting. The senior class gift is still uncer- tain. Chet's t~shirts will be coming soon. Every Thursday at 8:30 is senior night at Chees. The junior class is planning a junior night at Chet' s. A meeting with President Hull about campus safety resulted in a decision to use acard entrance system beginning in the fall since desk attendants cannot be put in all residence halls. Bike patrol was also proposed. The Student Fo- rum is waiting until the circum- stances surrounding the dance program are made .clear to them before they write a letter in sup- port of it. The SAC and the secu~ rity task force have made a pro- posal for any student committing an act of vandalism to have to pay double the cost of damages with a minimum fine. There was a motion to vote on this proposal once the SAC presents the final wording. There is a vacancy in the class of 2000 for the office ofVice .President. Petitions can be picked up in stu- dent activities on the 15. They must be handed in by the 19 and elec- tions will be held on the 26. Due to a demand for more smoke free housing, residence halls will be . made completely smoke free next year. The Student Forum took a vote of sentiment in support ofthis proposal. The SAC will be review- ing AEPi and Sig Chi. Houses on Seward Place will be used for stu- dent housing next y;.;ar. Student Forum Consultants are exploring options for community service ac~ tivities. Leadership training will be held on Aprill 0. Activities include a speaker followed by group ses~ sio11s headed by facilitators. Old Chapel rules are being reviewed. The meeting concluded at 10:2<JPM.

Twenty Students Represent Union at Conference by Sltaun Montana Staff Writer This past weekend, Union sent a delegation to the Harvard N a- tiona} Model United Nations ~HNMUN). Consisting of20 stu- dents and Professor Gilman, these members oftbe International Rela- tions Club we11t to represent Union at the \model\ UN set up and run by Harvard. HNMUN is a ye~rly conference, hosted by Harvard~ where college and university stu- dents from arou11d the US and ot!ter parts of the world come together to expe~ience what it is like to be a delegate to the UN. Harvard students put on the en- tire conference, serving as the vari- ous committee chairs and officers ofthe UN. There were even stu- dents who played security offi.c- ers and ran around all weekend with earpieces and very worr.iecl looks oh their faces. Each school in attendance rep- resented one ertwo countries that are part ofthe UN. Depending on the size of the delegation, each school has one or two delegates on each committee, ranging from the General Assembly to the World Health Organization. Each delegate is expected to be familiar with tlteir country's actual policy on issues to be discussed by their committee, to act out the .by Mary Felton S1~fWriter There are ofl:en comments echo- ing around the student body to tile effect that Union's campus is not safe enough, will security come immediately if I press the call but- ton on a blue light? Why is escort always so late when they are called for a ride, and how can I feel safe in my dorm if strangers are walking around in- side of it? These are just some of the is- sues and questions Union College's Campus Safety is faced with daily. Bill Sickinger, who is the head of Campus Safety, gave some insight into how Uni()n's Security is try- ing to improve safety procedures, and how he wishes the Union com- munity to view the role of security in order to make it as effective as possible. Last week Sickinger met with President Hull and the Student Fo- rum to discuss issues of security on campus. One item brought up by the Stu- dent Forum was that they thought it would be more beneficial to the community if Security could do a better job inf()nning the student body about policies, crime aware- ness, crime prevention and identi- fying the issues there. In terms of improvements being enacted on campus. A security consultant has been working with the college to iniprove its physical role of an actual UN delegate from their nation. In committee sessions, each del- egate is expected to support and defend their nation's pointofview. The four-day conference ran from last Thursday evening to early Sun- day afternoon. Th.ere were com- ~ittee sessions each day, usually lasting between three to four hours. The goal ofeach committee was to pass a resolution that defines what the committee would like to see done with r.egards to a particular issue. For example, one topic of the Committee on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice was the illicit trade ofsmall anns. A resolution passed on that topic would deal with the specifics of how the UN and its member states could act to curb the illegal trade of small arms. Te this end, delegates work together to draft working papers; general ideas they would like to see incorporated into a final resolution. These are presented and ideas debated back and forth until a draft resolution can be presented and accepted by vote. Union students Shennell Antrobus, Jesse Berube, Peter Casola, Meghan Driscoll, Matt Gendron, Brendan Geraghty, Brian Goldberg, Cori Kautz, Amy Kilmer, Leif Erik Liland, Henry Michtalik, K.rassen Mite\ Shaun Montana, Kim Rohback, Scott security. A majority of the physical changes which have taken place, or are taking place, on campus have been influenced by sit11ations where there was a breech in secu- rity this term. For example the January I 0 inci- dent in Richmond Hall where per- sons, who were not students of the school, entered the building and disturbed indiV\iduals living there. Due to this event, all side and exit doors on Richmond have local alarms, which means an alami will sound whenever they are opened. In a<ldition to this there is a prop alarm on the front door, which al- lows the door to be open for twenty seconds, at which point security will be notified. An alann company will be installing prop alarms in all the emergency exit doors in the up- coming months, as well. Another incident of security which occurred earlier this term occurred in the locker rooms at the Alumni Gym where strangers were seen prowling around the gynasium area. Although security measures have als() been taken to assure that students using the locker rooms are safe, Bill Sickinger wishes to stress that, \ ... [he] can'tdo [his]jobwith- out assistance from the student body ... \ Which indicates that in both these instances of security prob- lems it was someone who allowed these strangers to enter both the gym and Richmond. Sickinger stated that there are three things about a campus secu- Stedman, Amilcar Tirado, Austin Wingate, and Sang Yun served as the delegates from Cape Verde, a small African island republic that was once a Portuguese colony. Even though the tiny republi~;: has only 400,000 people and isn't a \big player\ in the worl~ the delegates worked hard to have an impact on the decisions made at the confer ... ence. Junior Hemy Michtalik and fresh- man Amilcat Tirado were very ac- tive in World Health Organization and \came to the point where we told how the US and UK to vote. Furthermore our committee pro ... duced a record number of nine work- ing papers and then four resolutions on the topic of 'ethic {)f genetic test- ing and treatment.' The impartant thing to note in the WHO committee is that we surged up from being a no name country to being a major player in the debate,\ Tirado related. Union senior Brian Goldberg; who has been attending these conferences since his fresh- man year, con~luded this four-year run by bei11g the chief author ofthe first draft resolution in his commit.., tee. By the end .of the weekend,. the small island nation !tad gone from \nobody\ to \somebody\ thanks to · the hard work of the delegates. The conference also had' W s. lighter side. In a landmark move, . junioi Jesse Berube in the Disar- mament Committee sold the whole country to the delegation from Ireland for \a case of Guinness and a case of Harp. Ireland's delegat~s said we c0uild all stay there and they'd just tum the country into a large faml for barley and hops.\ The rest of the delegation adopted this \sale\, referring to the country from that point on in many committees as ~'The New Irish Colony of Cape Verde.\ Seniors Shaun Montana and Pete Casoia, delegates to the Commit- tee on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice, assisted the other _male members of their com- mittee in serenading the alHe- male Committee on the Stat\Js of Women after a resolution was passed. Juniors Cori Kautz and Amy Kilmer found themselves holding the hands of other delegates in the Committee on UNICEF dur- ing the opening session. Junior Kim Rohbackand Pro- fessor Gilman wandered from committee to committee, watch- ing. the delegates and cheering them on, seeing some passion- ate speeches but also finding hu- mQrous moments. \I. was stand- ing inthe back of the room in one committee;\ a smiling Gilman re- lated tp the delegates one night, File Plloto What does Security have plannedfor Union College? rity system that must be effective in order to make a place, or school, secure. One element being the environ- mental design, the second is the physical security, the lhird, and most important, are the people who are part of this system. ,. He gave the Richmond and Alwnni Gym incidents as examples of what can happen when one of those three items is compromised, which in short is a lack of secu- rity. Sickinger wants to remind the students that he needs their help to ensure their protection. To add to this he wanted to stress that no mattei what ad- vancements are made at Union, there will be no effect without co- operation from the community. Sickinger plans on working closely with the Schenectady Chief ofPolice, whom he met with recently. Another item of improvement that Sickinger is trying to address with Campus Safety is allowing for more contact between stu- dents and the security guards. He is hoping to have security begin to patrol on bicycles rather than in cars so that security guards ate mote recognizable. This new type of patroiling may begin as early as Aprilofthis \and a West Point cadet in uniform comes \IP and says, 'Excuse me sir, but have you seen anyone in here dressed like me?' A quick look around the room and I easily found another one, and pointed him out.\ For meals and free time, del- egates could wander and explore whatBostonhadtooffer. Many.of the delegates spent their time visit- ing famous historical areas like the Boston Commons andQuincy Mar- ket. Goldberg and others at the con- ference took advantages ofbreak to go for runs in downtown Bos• ton. Others also spent time exploring Boston's nightlife, while some hard- core delegates were up all night working on working papers and draft resolutions. Junior Matt Gendron commented on the.nightlife by saying, «What a smorgasbord of tastes we had available to us'!\ The entireCape Verde delegation got together to celebrate the suc- cesses oftheweekend by geing out to dinner on Saturday night at an rtalian restaurant. \With the sale ofthe country to Ireland, maybe we should have gone to an Irish pu~ to celebrate instead,\ Professor Gilman joked while congratulating the delegates. \I'm J>roud ofyou all and the hard work and effort you putill'to.ljllak- ing this weekend a success.\ .. . . ' . - year. With the expansion of the Union College campus on to'. Seward Place, Sickfuger expects security will be more actively in- volved with thedtizens ofthecom- munity as well. ~ickinger believes that the role ofthe Escort service on campus has been severely abused and wishes to remind the student body that Escort was set up as a personal safety service,. not a taxi service, which it has come to be thought of. Some ·improvements he wants to make iiJ this area may involve the operators of the escort vehicles, re- stricting the job to non-students, as to avoid the issue of peer-pres- sure. He also expressed the idea of giv- ing students in the work study pro- gram the job as a walking escort, having them stationed at the Li- brary or the Campus Center to walk students horne at night. In terms of crime prevention at Union, Campus Safety's role is di- vided into four parts; education of the community, empowering mem- bers of the community, (a \help us help them\ idea), physical modifi- cations that need to be taken care of, and enforcement of the rules. Basically, as Sickinger expressed, Union College can only be a safe place for everyone living here if ev- eryone takes precautions for their own safety. The responsibilj,ty for each individual's safety .here at Union, falls not only on the shoulders' of Union's Security Officers, but on each individual student and staff member as well • AN BIC BIC BIC Clll CL~ EC( EEF EEF EGI EN~ ESC ESC GE!

WORLD NEWS The Implications of Journalistic Sensationalism by Neii'Routman 5itl-{j{Writer Adam-Paul. Smolak fVorld New.\ EJ1tor Earlier this month. th·e Reverend Jesse .lac kson brought his ideas. hope~. and dreams about the future of Amel'ica to Union. He spoke of \'building a bridge from Wall Street to Appalachia.'' He spoke about rais- ing our youth up instead of locking them up. He spoke about the urgency to find h~lp to the half million Americans whndie from cancer every year. lf one heard the speech. despite one's own political beliefs. it would be very hard to disagree with the many points ofReverend Jackson eloquent. ardent allocution. Ht)wever. in the process of publicizing the event, the message was lost. In the ques- tion and answer session. the immediate in- quiries by the media did not focus on the context ofthe vision but on the president's problems in Washington. One reporter asked. ··Do you think President Clinton should be impeached?'' She obviously did not realize. in her frenzy to get a rise out or Reverend Jackson. that the president had already been impeached. Jackson wa~ forced to correct her and comment on a to- tally irrelevant subject. He went on to say that the media only sensarionalizes these eve11ts: he predicted that on the rwws that night the story would-have nothing to do with what he just said. He declared that the media came to the event with a pre-written story, all they had to do was '·till in the blanks.,. Revereno Jackson 'spredictions came true. On the television news reports the media portrayed the speech as trying to undermine the Republican Party in order to gain public support for the Democratic Nati01ial Party. Additionally the head! inc for the Schenectady Gazette read '\Jesse Jackson. speaks at Union College. rips Republican Party:• In the United States, the supposed role of the 111edia is to report the news in a infonna- tional manner in order to allow the public the ability te understand and derive their own opinions on social, moral. and political eveiits. Moreover, th-is tole as an informa- tional intennediary gives the media a central role in shaping the social and moral norms in society. The media has bee orne its own branch of the govemment: it has the ability to raise issues and then resolve them as it pleases. It has the power to popularize people or pro- , fessions (its no coincidence that the popu- larity of ER and LA Law increased enroll- ment in their respective graduate schools). Through the questions that it raises at speeches and political events and consew quently the repotts that it. issues to inform the public about the .particular event: it guides and shapes the viewpoints ofit's rea.;i- ers and listeners. For example, in the 1992 presidential election focused on a non-is- sueofBill Clinton's single incident of smok- ing marUuana. Only through its constant focus on the issue did the media effectively create the controversy of Clinton's \I didn't inhale.\ The vast majority of American's are very forgiving of a single drug experiment, but through coercive tactics. the med.ia con- vinced the public that Clinton was not tell- ing tl1e truth about inhaling and that his char- acter was damaged not from admitting smok- ing marijuana but because the media over- played the issue and focused on the fact that Clinton lied about iNllal:ing. Thus, the media did ·not merely report(' linton· s sup- posed usage or his defense ofhis usage hut sensationalized to the point that it had re- percussions on the integrity of the candi- date. The media today has few I imits and zero respect for the personal dignity ofthe indi- viduals that they report on. The 111edia can aftord to defame or investigate whomever at any expense and offer the justification that the public is desirous of scandalous and salacious reporting. However. this justitkation excludes the idea of journalistic integrity. The media needs to take rcsponsibil ity in restricting sensationalism and incrementally reform journalism to a more int(xmational style that allows the public to gain an acctuate depic- tio.n .of what the issue is and the hnplica- tions that stem frol'n the issue. The \intor- parties. ho\1·evcr. newspaper.;; no longer arc aniHated with such identities. leaving the reader clueless to the spin and assuming legitimate unbiased infom1ati·on. The addi- tion of television to the medium also de- stroyed the previous. reiiable system of knowing what news is influenced in what way. Today. the war of words is not between political purties. but it is a n<lnpartisan at- tack aimed at creating contlict for stric.tly tlnam:ial gains. However. tht.!t~c is some nK'- dium between tl1 rs trenzy of today 's capital- ism of entertainment and govemment owned entities of infonnation. The British Broad- casting Corporation seems •to have suc- ceeded in findi11g a comprotnise. The gov- ernment sponsored corporation is not moti- vated to re-sell itself every day: tl1e trade off be~ing its lack of ability to inv.estigate itself and possible corruptions. Furthermore, the coverageofthe news has \HisttJry repeats itself. lj'tltis foundation is not alneliol~ated, the pub- lic can only expect to e~\tperience 1nore media-driven sensationalistic journalisJtl. lfthe public , really wisll~s to curtail suc/1 practices by tlte 111edia, then it 1nust let its voice be lteard. \ mational'' reporting on tht: Jesse .Jackson speech represented this i11crcdib ly sensa- tionalistic spin-type journalism. .Jackson· s speech focused on tix in g. the problems of our society: he focused on lo- cal issues here in New Ytlrk. I k \\aSap~ palled at the idea of spending t.8 billion dol- lars on prisons and 1.~ billion on schnols. f le mentioned the unf.~tirn~s~ or the difter- enc.es in drug laws (the war on dt:ugs we· don't like). Y l!t the local tckvisi(m stations insisted on focusing on natiotlal.non-prob- lt:!rils. While Reverend Jackson spoke on building bridges within commttnities, advice that was directed at localities. tlte local p1'ess instead of report.ing on such pertinent mat- ters, decided. to report on im:onsellllential, sensationalistic topics such as where Rev- erend Jackson spent Superb~)wl Sunday or what his thoughts were on the fatni·liar bond Qfthe tirst ti:unily. The entities of media at·e no longer news takers but newsmakers. They hunt for the Story and the sound bite that will make a repmter's career. The effect that Bob Wood- ward and Carl Bernstein had on investiga- . tive.repot1ing remains strong. ·• Wood-Steitl', however. focused on a legitinulte scand~ll of Watergate, while reporters an(! paparaz.zi today will publish any remote story or prob- lem that will make them a buck or ean1 Neilson ratings. The problern is media's ini- tial job is to make money. not report the news. The press is no longer driVe11 by pol.itical determinations. In the past,. newspapers were either slanted towards the Democratic ideals or the Republican morals. The reader would be able to identify Which slant the paper was giving to the news. With the suppression and deterioration of the power's of political chat1ged dramatically to a niort: .. game'· style approach instead of an om ph asis on infor- mational reporting.

It is through a history of his life that a basic understanding of his confrontational nature and his oppressive rule can be learned. Hussein was born on April28, 1937 in a poor village located in the Tikrit region north of Baghdad. His fath~r left before his birth and Hussein was given the surname Saddam, which literally means ''He who con- fronts\. With his father's departure, Saddam was subjected to an a harsh family life, usu- ally at the hands of his stepfa~her; which caused him to run away from home at the age often and live with his uncle Khairullah Tulfah, a devoutSunni Muslim and a future governor of Baghdad. Tulfah was a driving force in an internal Iraqi campaign against Jews and Persians. These views would mani- festthemselves in Saddam laterin life, as he has been critical towards Israel and wary of his neighbor to the east - Iran. During the early 50s the overthrow of ~gypt's British-installed monarchy and the installation ofGama'l Abdel Nasser as Presi- dent of Egypt won the respect and admira- tion of many Arabs. It was through this time of unease in the Middle East that a young Saddam found his idol in the person ofNasser, and found his calling in Nasser's politics. In i957, Hussein now twenty, joins. th~· Baath party in. Iraq. The Baath party s~eks the overthrow ofEuropean colonialism and the institution of a single socialist Anib State. The party also believes that only through revolution can the pro-western re~ gimes of many Arab countries be swept aside to liberate Arabs to fulfill their historical des- tiny. Sad dam, at this point was very recep- tive of the part!es policy and swiftly went to prove himself to the party elite.

Just two years later Hussein's would at- t~mpt another assassination- only this time it would be unsuccessful. The target at the time was the Iraqi Prime Minister Abdul Kassem. During the attempt Hussein was injured and Kassem escaped. Hussein then disguised himself as a woman and escaped to Syria on a donkey. In 1962, Hussein's political aspirations would help him meet his idol - Nasser. The two quickly became friends and through this Hussein earneda spot in the Cairo law school. After a year in law school Hussein re- turned to run a Baath torture center ·despite rumblings that the regime was in the midst of chaos due to higher echelon mismanage- ment. During this time he amassed a large secretpolice force to help him attain the role of party leader. This plan was learned by the party elite and Saddatn was thrown in jail. In .1968 he escaped from jail and led are- volt to restore the Baath party to power and install him as the head of the party. Even at this time, his political ideology was appar ... ent, and many would argue a foreboding statement of his future intentions, as Nora Boustany would note in tbe Washington Post \His Baathist rhetoric historically has called for the elimination of existing Arab borders, which were drawn by British and French colonial powers ... A specifically Iraqi claim long has been that Kuwait... sbould have reverted to Iraq wl!en the British left in 1961.\ Eleven years later Hussein; with a con- solidated power base and the support Df a large number of Iraqi citizens, staged a coup to overthrow Iraqi President Gen. Ahmed Hassen Barlcr. Bakr was a distant relative who was largely successful \in helping Hussein attain a leadership role in national politics. Bakr was placed under house ar- rest and Saddam assumed the Presidency' of the Iraqi nation, and elevated many fam- ily members to prominent political positi(}ns.

This plan would entail the train- ing and anning of Kurdish rebels that are found predominately in the north and south regions of Iraq; the same areas protected by US and UK en- forced \no-fly\ wnes. This plan failed when Hussein crushed the rebels with the forces of the loyal Republican Guard. In this sense, the US had un- derestimated the power that Hussein held over his forces after the war.

A spirit of comm u- nity is created by activities. clubs, sports teams and classes.

To say that Union would not be able to create a spirit of community by all'owing sopho- mores andju111iors to live off campus is a little insulting. We're not in kindergarten.

. ) . ' by Alex Militello Contributing Writer Have you ever caught yourself watching an episode of Star Trek and wondering what it wouJd be like to transport from one place, to another in the tirneittakes to 1nake a call? Have youever wanted to go from one solar system to an other within a few hours? How about taking a leisu:a:ely trip thr.()ugh space in a faster-than-light ves- sel in order to observe a wmmhole in action? These are justa few of the ideas taken from the minds of theoretical physicists for the purpose of fit- ting the needs ()f writers wh <> would otherwise be at a loss for words when an aspect of the plot needs to be explained. There are times in which the \suspension ()f disbelief' (frequently applied .to most movies and T.V. in general, especially science fiction and fan- tasy) should be used to acc()unt for those scenes in which there is no other explanation for an event to have occurred. For most ofthe other puzzling scientific features of the show, they keep a science consultant on-hand (most lil<ely someone who has had a lot of,ex- perience in the area of theoretical physics) to insert <lialogue ancl help explain the pltyslcal workings ofthe ship. Say you're traveling alon8 at impulse power (merely half tile speed oflight) and tile captain sud- denly wants the sllip to jump int() high warp. To prevent a four or five thousand G-force (at least) from turning you mto a pancake in the sllape of whatever you happeiJ to be sitting on, you can hopefully count on the inertial dampeners to make the ride as srnooth as if)'OU weren't evf?n m()vin.g at all! This device dampens the inertia of the ship by applying anequal and <>p- posite push frorn that which is caused by the momentary surge of acceleration. The dampeners seNe to somehow distribute this effect upcn the ship as a whole. The artificial gravity unit on board, another thing v:ital for space travel and usuallytaken for granted, serves to provide gravity for the entire ship in much the same way that ships are navigated at sell. These large ships are kept from swaying vigorously back and forth by several navigational gyro- Science & Technolo _.,._ scopes which are constantly spin- ning rapidly. For those ofyou who have seen the movie \2001 :A Space Odys- sey,\ t~e huge spin- ning a wheel that's part of the ship cre- ates an artifi- cial gravity. This artificial gravity is such that the ;person walk- ing on the in- side of the spinning ring will fee] the centrifugal force of this spinning mo- tion pushing down on them. The same is true for the Starship Enterprise, except on a smaller and much more rapid scale. These rings are all located within a certain section ofthe ship. The transporter systems are a bit more complicated, as one could imagine. Gene Roddenberry (tbe creator of Star Trek) once said that he came up with this idea because, \'I just couldn't figure out a way to land the dam thing.\ The imprapti- cality of building such a trans- porter as the one on Star Trek is evidenced· l>y the fo11owing jour- ney through the mind of one ofthe greatest of physicists. Early in the 20th century, Altert Einstf?in came up with his famous equation of Specjal Relativity, E=mc2. This equation states tllat we are given a small m~s (let's say the size of a person) of 150 kilo- grams and we that want to convert this mass into energy for the s~ke . ()£transporting the person (via an electrical signal) to another loca- tion. Using this equation, we find out that this person, completely converted into energy, would cre- ate ortum into 1.36 x 10 19 Joules. That's all well and good until some- one realizes that this energy is somewhere in the area often tholl- sand times the explosive power of an atomic bomb! The energy un- leashed in an atomic explosion i.s derived from only a few grams of uranium fuel! You may now see why this form of transport would in fact he such an impossibility in our current day and age. But, you have to admit, it would still be a great way to get from one place to Now we are back to Einstein, whose theories predict so much bllt whose equations which have put so much of a constraint upon www.geodtes.com/ Area51 things. such as practical space travel. Scien- tists have con- cluded that ac- cording to hi!::i equations of General Rela .. tivity, nothing can go faster than the speecr at which light travels. This is because of the fact that as one approaches the speed of light, one's mass in- creases expo- nentially until the point at whi-ch it re- quires an 'infi- another. nite forc~tocontinue accelerating As everything that I'm explain- an (apparently) infmite mass.

Page 14• February 18, 1999 • Cl.tlJll.carlli~nsis Science & Technolcgy Science & Technology The Science oC Star Trek by Alex Militello Contributing Writer Have you ever caught yourself watching an episode of Star Trek and wondering what it wmlid be I ike to transport from one place to another in the time it takes to make a call? Have you ever wanted to go from one solar system to another within a few hours? How about taking a leisurely trip through space in a faster-than-light ves- sel in order to observe a wormhole in action? These are just a few ofthe ideas taken from the minds of theoretical physicists for the purpose of fit- ting the needs of writers who would otherwise be at a loss for words when an aspect of the plot needs to be explained. There are times in which the \suspension of disbelief' (frequently applied to most movies and T.V. in general, especially science fiction and fan- tasy) should be used to account for those scenes in which there is no other explanation for an event to have occurred. For most of the other puzzling scientific features of the show, tlley keep a science consultant on-hand (most likely someone who has had a lot of ex- perience in the area of theoretical physics) to insert ~ialogue and help explain the physical workings ofthe ship. Say you're traveling along at impulse power (merely half the speed oflight) and the captain sud- denly wants the ship to jump into high warp. To prevent a four or five thousand G-force (at least) from turning you into a pancake in the shape of whatever you happen to be sitting on, you can hopefully count on the inertial dampeners to make the ride as smooth as ifyou weren't even moving at all! This device dampens the inertia of the ship by applying an equal and op- posite push from that which is caused by the momentary surge of acceleration. The dampeners serve to somehow distribute this effect upon the ship as a whole. The artificial gravity unit on board, another thing vital for space travel and usually taken for granted, serves to provide gravity for the entire ship in much the same way that ships are navigated at sea. These large ships are kept from swaying vigorously back and forth by several navigational gyro- scopes which are constantly spin- ning rapidly. For those of you who have seen the movie \200l:A Space Odys- sey,\ the huge spin- ning a wheel that's part of the shi'P cre- ates an artifi- cial gravity. This artificial gravity is such that the person walk- ing on the in- side of the spinning ring will feel the centrifugal force of this spinning mo- tion pushing down on them. The same is true f<Jr the Starship Enterprise, except on a smaller and much more rapid scale. These rings are all located within a certain section of the ship. The transporter systems are a bit more complicated, as one could imagine. Gene Roddenberry (the creator of Star Trelc) once said that he came up with this idea because, \I just couldn't figure out a way to land t:he darn thing.\ The impracti- cality of building such a trans- porter as the one on Star Trek is evidenced by the following j()ur- ney through the mind of one of the greatest of physicists. Early in the 20th century, Albert Einstein came up with his famous equati<>n of Special Relativity, E=mc 2 . This equation states ti1at we are given a small mass (let's say the size of a person) of !50 ki !a- grams and we that want to convert this mass into energy for the sake oftransporting the person (via an electrical signal) to another loca- tion. Using this equation, we find o1:1t that this person, completely converted into energy, would cre- ate or tum into 1.36 X I 0 19 Joules. That's all well and good until some- one realizes that this energy is somewhere in the area often th()U- sand times the explosive power of an atomic bomb! The energy un- leashed in an atomic explosion is derived from only a few grams <Jf uranium fuel! You may now see why this fonn of transport would in fact be such an impossibility in our current day and age. But, you have to admit, it would still be a great way to get from one place to Now we are back to Einstein, whose theories predict so much but whose equations which have put so much of a constraint upon · fact be moving backward in time. The \wormhole\ concept has been used very freqaently within the Star Trek Universe, and it is also an idea quite familiar to fans of Star Trek: Deep Space Nine on account of the huge wormhole right behind the station complex. A wormhole in theoretical phys- ics is not quite the same as a worm- hole in Star Trek. In scieace fic- tion, a wormhole is an enormous opening able to connect two vastly distant points along the space-time continuum; the actual theoretical wormhole, as it is de- scnbed in the same way, is said to be the size of an electron (or smaller) and very unstable. www.geocites.com/Area5l things such as practical space travel. Scien- tists have con- cluded that ac- cording to his equations of General Rela- tivity, nothing call go faster than the speed at which light travels. This is because of the fact that as one approaches the speed of light, one's mass in- creases expo- nentially until the point at which it re- A wormhole is said (ifthey ex- ist at all) to pop into existence and just as rapidly pop out of exist- ence. Speculation may lead to the idea that black holes (which have, in fact, been discovered) could be considered to be wormholes if they were somehow connected or put back to back. another. As everything that I'm explain- ing seems to be based upon unsurvivable G-forces and incred- ible amotmts of energy, I am about to open the door on another very violent and much more explosive sHbstance: Anti-matter. This is the stuff that warp-drives are made of. It powers hu·ge starships such as Enterprise. Anti-matter, on a sub- atomic level, is simply the conju- gate pairs of protons, neutrons (namely the anti-protons), anti- neutrons, and positrons. These sel- dom-observed particles are created in nuclear accelerators and are the remains of subatomic explosions taking place inside the nuclear chambers. If one were to collect a substantial amount of it, it would explode <>n contact with normal matter with such ferocity as to make atomic and hydrogen bombs look like firecrackers in comparison. A few years ago, a few physi- cists were able to bring these three components of anti-matter-an anti-proton, anti-neutron, and positron-together in order to assemble the very first anti-matter hydrogen atom. They were only able to determine its existence from the observations made and con- clusions drawn from their data, as well as the subsequent small ex- plosion detected when the atom came into brief contact with nor- mal matter. quires aA ·infi- nite force to continue accelerating an (apparently) infinite mass. This is seen by the simple equation Force = mass times acceleration (F=ma). The idea behind the traveling of the Enterprise, however, is not in bringing the ship to a location, but to bring the location to the ship. By using a technique in which the ship warps the space-time around it, the ship is able to traverse huge distances with apparent minimal effort (For those who are at all in- terested, the warp number is found by taking the equation c 2 x, where \c\ is the speed of light, and \x\ is the warp number. This was devised by a creative scientist in the Star Trek camp). This idea of faster-than-light travel may be a prerequisite for the concept oftime-travel. Many of the more eccentric and visionary- minded of the theoretical physi- cists see the prospectoftime-travel in our distant future a a possibility. There are numerous theories based upon the idea that time-travel is possible. One of those theories states that as one approaches the speed of light, one appears (from the vantage point of an outside observer) to have slowed down; as such, it is therefore conceivable that when one surpasses the speed oflight, (the \ultimate\ speed) they will continue to move forward by their own observations, but will in There are many other aspects of Star Trek too numerous to de- scribe which owe their existence to theoretical and modem phys- ics, such as the tractor beam, the holodeck, and the phaser.

' . ) Coffeehouse Hosts Multicultural Reading by KimberlyRohback A&E Editor The halls were alive with the sound of music and poetry. Last Tuesday, the Coffeehouse, in cel- ebration of Black History Month, held an outrageously successful multicultural reading. At about 9:30 the crowds started filing in. There was barely enough seating (yet again). The evening was emceed by Francisco GFellon. Francisco intro- duced each of the readers who read original poetry dealing with sub- jects that ranged from racism to drug abuse~ and selected poems from other famous black and Latino authors. Riveting performances were given by Nick Jeah Francois, Hemenattie Ramasamie, Greg Van Holt, Amy Rosa, Francisco Grellon, Doni Johnson, and Alana Benoit. For over an hour, the readers ex- pressed passionate, heartfelt pieces that touched the minds of the listeners. the de\terity with which Noyes played seeing as he \picked it up\ in lessthan five months. To add to the multicultural di- mension of the evening, Petre Chemelicek from the Czech Repub- lic, who has lived in the Coffee- house for over a term but had, un- til last Tuesday, not attended a sing1e ev~nt, showed up with his international band of friends. Hoo- ray for Petre.! Thank you for com- ing! · Following the reading, Johnson had.an.amazingperfonnance using nothing but his vocal chords. The croWd clapped along with his rich beats laced with intermittent calls and song. Following Johns.ons's crowd pleasing; \song he was joined by Coffeehouse favorite, Brian Mitchell. They performed a duet of\No Woman No Cry.\ The audi- ence clapped and sang along as the two artists strummed a guitar and thmst out the beats. the six people who live here every Tuesday night, but since you're all still here I'm going to keep play- ing.\ And play he did. It was a regular old-fashioned Pearl Jam sing-along. He was followed by the musical stylings of Steve Boyer on guitar and Dan Rickson on vocals. These two were quite a hit. The whole house rang with music. The evening was coordinated by Michael Capraro and Johrtson. Capraro, after attending the Dr. Martin Luther King Day ceremony, asked Johnson if he would be in- terested in helping to coordinate the talent that was showcased that day up at the coffeehouse. Johnson gathered a list. of read- ers and organized the performers. Coffeehouse would like to extend a huge thank you to all of the par- ticipants, especially Doni Johnson for sharing their poetry and creat- ing a very special Tuesday night. Roger Noyes also played the piepa, atraditional Chinese instru- ment, to add to the multicultural theme of the evening. The audi- ence was extremely impressed with It was definitely a memorable mo- ment. F()llowing the performances ofMitchell and Johnson, Mitchell continue<! to play for the packed house. He expressed his delight in having a new audience to perform for. \Usually I end up playing for When asked about his feelings on the evening, Johnson com- mented, \We need to do this every day on this campus~\ This editot ·. agrees.

Joe Black does attempt, in one scene, to reveal his secret identity (his slow, unfinished \1.. .. am ... \ had me practically yelling out the rest of the sentence, \I.. . am •.• Supennan!\) but as Clark so often does, Joe fails and it is ultimately· up to Lois, uh Susan, to find out fc)f herself. Whether she does or not is one big question, because the ending was a tad con\ fusing and incomprehensible. Al- tbough the film starts out promis- ingly and somewhat unpredictably, it quickly dwindles down to a love story like that .of Lois and Clark, with Perry being the highly suc- cessful company man. This is not to say that it is hackneyed and stale. Hcvvever, clocking in at three hours, it nearly reaches that point. The filmt 'painstakingly crawls along, despite h.aving scenes that copld have been easi-ly taken out without sacrificing plot value. When it comes down to it, then pacing b~;comes the biggest blun- der whicfl is something that was also p~~bJematicfor director Mar- tin Brest in his 1988 movie, Mid- . night R2ln.

This ex-boyfriend is supposedly the Lex Luther ()f Meet Joe Black, but unfortunately, this lex Luther has mysteriou.sly lost devious quali- ties along with his cosmopolitan ambition. Complaints aside, the plot (loosely based on the I 959 film Death ofa Salesman) itself is en- gaging enough. Moreover, the thoughtofa friendly Grint Reaper is a new ()ne to most people who are accustomed to seeing Death as a mystical character who delights in taking; people's souls ..

·' Dining Out With Gina LaSorsa By Gina Lasona Staff Writer This week,. Kim Rohback and I bravely ventured out to Japan Sushi on Union Street. Japan Sushi is a relatively new establishment, and it is owned by a couple of guys from China .. From the outside, the restaurant appears to be a little shady, but it isn't that bad once you go irt. While Japan Sushi seems to be more like .a takeout restaurant, there are a couple of little tables to sit at. The inside of the restaurant is rather wlain and boring. Aside from the tables, there isn't much else in there. There's a big counter across from the tables, where you are supposed to order. There is also a television sitting in a styrofoam box. As a fair warning, I shouldmention that it is a little confusing as to where to or- der, and the ,()wners did not pro- vide much assistance. Afterbreak- ing through a relatively large lan- guage barrier, Kim and I fmally ng- ured out what was going on. At Japan Sushi, there are two dif- ferent menus to order from. The larger of the two is a menu for sushi and maki. The other menu. is for the hot items, suc.b as nooqles, teri aki, and tempura. The individual pieces of sushi aFe cheap with prices ranging from a dollar to two dollars. The prices of each maki rollrangefrom$2.50to$4.75. Com- bination plates of either maki or sushi are also available for any- where fr()m $7.50 to $20.95, de- pending ()11 how many people you want ·to serve. The hot items are a little more 'expensive, but they comewith soup and white rice. For lunch, the prices range from $4:95 to $6.95, but for dinner the prices go up abotlt $6.00. · Kim and J decided to order the beef teriyak:i and: negimaki.

This cast is one of treJPendous talent The five stars of the show include, Spencer Christie, Devon Ciampa, Mark McK.ee, AH Struzziaro, and Honorah Tinti, with pianist Joanne Mumley.

Unio11 lost to both teams earlier in the month at Achille.s, faHing 5-3 to Clarkson in a heart-· breaking Friday night loss and then 4-0 to St. Lawrence --- the following evening.

How- ever, Unioa could not .hold the shots. Some of Shtrom' s saves came with Clarkson players on the doorstep. In the second period, Matt Reid moved across the front of the net waiting for Shtrom to go down. Shtrom stayed with him and made a beautiful pad save. Clar!Gon coach Mark Morris was .impressed with Shtrom'splay. \He couple ofus had some,opportuni- , ties.

At the. fmalrace ofthe season both the men's and women's teams raced impressively and secured their chance to compete against the top sixteen teams oftheregion. In the men's slalom on Sattuday they were pushing for a solid fin- ish in order to better their overall standings in the division. Mike Ftdler's slalom skiing was just wbat the team needed. With a second and a third place finish in the two runs, Fuller ended in a tie with Colgate's top ranked skier. Ben Wormer and Corey Allen both had unfortunate falls, but amazingly Allen was able to recover quickly and still fmish in eight~enth place. Jim Bryant alsoexecutedtwosolid runs, and, with his sevente~th place finish the Men's team took third overall close behind Colgate and Clarkson.

Yep, the Boys of Summer Are Back Camps Open This Week, as Baseball Begins New Seas:on ofExcitement by .Brian Terlinsky Sports Editor Can you believe that in less than only a week, baseball players will be heading back to training camp in sunny Florida and Arizona? It feels like only yesterday that the legendary 1998 New York Yankees swept the San Diego Padres in four games, while El Duque pitched phenomenally and Darryl Straw- berry was watching the series at home, recovering from colon can- cer. an old ball club. However, the 1998season will never forget the\Great Race\ be- tween two men who were so differ- ent at the start but b~came best friends and great competitors at the finish line. Even though Mark McGuire and Sammy Sosa broke Roger Maris's homerun record, which is the longest standing r!!cordinmajor league baseball his- tory, the two changed the sport of baseball with their amazing excite- ment and the on-going wmpetition they gave to the fans. The \Great Race\ of 1998 ex periericed a II out the world and helped bring America's old- professional sport back n the spotH~ht to the rican people. Fans all over tile world, in- a.IJluuing C11ba, Japan, and Europe, watched McGuire and Sosa light up pitchers blast h<;>meruns every week during the season. Furthermore, who would ever believed or imag- ined back in Spring Train- ing of 1998, tflat a Mark McGuire homerun ball ~;;,;;;:;;;;~would be aucti~ned for one courtesy MLB million dollatsatthe end of Cubs outfielder Sammy Sosa hit 66 homers in 1998. Although the Yankees won the World Series, had the best record in major league history, and had David Wells pitch a perfect game for them, America's past-time was nothing like any other year during the 1998 season. Cal Ripken offi- cially ended his almost 3000 con- secutive game steak, Dennis Ekersley retired after a 20-year pitching career, and rookie pitcher Carrie Wood showed the Chicago Cubs what young talent can do for the season? WQw! I remember, while work- ing as an intern at NBC Sports this past summer, the hype we as an office full of interns and producers went through while tllese two were battling it out during tile summer weekend games. Nevertheless, some people in the office, who did not care for the race, w<Juld get so annoyed at networks, especially Fox Sports, who w~uld leave games they were broadcasting in the American League and switch to the \Mac\ and \Sammy\ cams, which covere~ every at. bat these two guys had. I personally t this was great camera work by Fox Sports, however, I· do not remember ever watching the two men hit. a homer while Fox put them both in the spotlight. The \Great Race\ again brought the game ofbase-· ball to life in the I 990's; it lost much popularity in the last few decades, since the timeofthe strike and incr·ease in ticket prices, But this year was truly special, as never in history would you see a baseball clip making the national nightly news, with a11 the stations showing every homer McGuire or Sosa hit, while they got closer to the mark of sixty made by Yankee Roger Maris. \Big Mac \ never gave up and smacked 70 homers up unlit the McGuire and Sosa be- ___________ _,of,__th_e_s_e'-as_o_n~. -------~------ came respected national otber amazing. season of baseball, heroes and celebrities from their or was the 1998 season a once in a record-breaking year.

There alsowill be a visit from the Pope, but the Vatican officials warned the His Holiness will not kiss any of the contaminated soil around Yo- A<hiaen \s landing site. There's more. Hartford this sum- mer will be the site ofthe Beatles reunion concert, and officials in France are expected to announce that the annual Canned Film Festi- val will be pennaneritly moved to Showcase Cinema in East Hartford The announcement that the2008 Games will be going to Hartford came after all IOC members ceived free lion-dollar life for Antonio Samaranch ?)., scholarships for Yale kids, and genuine Hart- ford cigar wrap- pers. With shee.plike preci- s ion, the Con- necticut legisla- ture also was ac- tive in bidding, promising the IOC members Super Bowl tickets and \walking around money\ which was causally re- quested in random emails. Connecticut Governor John Rowland also announced that the new Yale Bowl will serve as the soccer stadium forthe2008 Olym- pics. Cycling will be held in Avon, Connecticut, and Hartford's Colt Having bought the Olympics, the Democratic Convention, fhe World's Fair, the Ryder Cup, the Beatles, the Cannes Film festival, and the Patriots, Hartford now has its sights seton future Super Bowls. But that can't happen until there is a football stadium, and it's still not clear when the Patriots will begin playing in their new $375 million playpen. Rowland and Kraft have been Greco-Roman wrestling on the carpet of the governor's man- sion in their efforts to resolve po- tential problems over a steam plant and removal oftoxic waste. Dutchman of the Week Dave Musella Dave Musella became this year's first repeat \Dutchmen of the Week\ after a steller perfonnance over the weekend. On Friday night, Musella lit up Skidmore for 30 points as the Dutchmem cruised to a 85-74 vic- tory. The win pushed Union's record to 12-9 and 5-4 in the UCAA. On Saturday, the Shooting Dutchmen traveled to Geneva to take on the basement dwelling Statesman. Despite their poor record, Union was not taking the game lightly. Musella again led the team in scoring with 28 points and a team high six assists. Dave was named the ECAC \Rookie of the Week\ after averging 29 points over the week- end and improving Union's record t<l 13-9 overall and 6-4 in the UCAA. The Dutchmen have secured thier frrst winning season since '93- 94'. The Dutchmen need to win two of their last three games in order to make post-season play. They played Middlebury Tuesday night, and host St. Lawrence and Clarkson this weekend Dutchwoman of the Week Sarah Moss nice Af- recognize Kraft,aman whu loves to be recog- 'zed. \We owe a Jot of this to Bob nor. \He was the first one to be- lieve in us. Once we got the Patri- ots, other people started to take Hartfor<lseriously again. Plus, we found {)Ut that if you fork over ri- diculotu sums to make the rich richer,tlley'll come to your city no matter h()W dreadful it appears to be. Hey~ it worked for Atlanta. Why not us?\ Hartford citizens applauded the announcement. IOC _ How ridiculous is this? For yeats Hartford has been known as a sec- ond tier, second rate city. Now, · simply because the Massachusetts· state legislature could not (\gree on a stadiumdeal with Bob Kraft and the P~triots decided to move to Connecticut, Hartford has become paradise. Their governor saic;Hhat all it takes is ridiculous amounts of money and anyone wiH come run- ning. Theil'onic part in all ofthis-is that economic str~tegists have shown that the stctte of Connecti- cut will not make any significant revenue ori their stadium deal with the Patriots until nearly 30 years after the stadium is built. Where wiU Connecticut come up with enough money to not only build a football' stadium, but an Olympic Park, and the numerous other ad- ditions they will need to satisfY all the events schedu'led to take place? It just doesn't seem pos- sible. Nonetlldess, Olympic Games fans, the summer games will be coming to Hartford, and for any- one interested is making the sce- nic trip downinterstate 84 into even more scenic downtown Hartford, you may be able to catch a few events. Ifyou have ever been to Hartford; don't expect much im- provement from the last time you visited. It appears as though Con- necticut has alot of money to throw around, but after buying so many events, their bank account must be .prettynear dry.

Four weeks after beating the Engineers on th~ir home court, the Shooting Dutch- men fell apart at Memorial Field House. The only change was that injured junior Zena Woldeyesus was not dressed for the fourth game in therow. Rensselaer shot an impressive 55.4% from the fielQ. while Union struggled from the floor aU night lang, shooting a dismal 37 .8%. Freshman Aaron Galletta had 16 points on the night and classmate Dave Musella scored 12. No other Union player hit double digits. Rensselaer's Alex Dow lin lit up the Dutchmen for 33 points, while two other Red Hawks made double dig- its. The Dutchmen trailed 3 7 -25· at the ·break and closed the gap to 46- 42 with 12:42 to go in the game. However, Rensselaer pulled away with a 16\'2 run over the next three and a half minutes stretching their lead to 62·44 with nine minutes to go in the game. The Dutchmen were out-rebounded 33'-25 and ended .the day with a 22,.point loss. Musella said after the game \It was the worst game of the season\ Union fell to I 1-9 overall and 44 in theUCAA. The weekend was a wh.ole new situation for the Dutchmen. \The team began to realize that they neededto win. They came out with a: lot ,of energy and ·great execu- tion,\ said Montana. Skidmore came intc;> Memorial Field Itouse trying to preve they Were better than the 25-point blow-out Union handed them four weeks earlier. The Dutchmen weren't about to let Skidmore take control and they jumped outto a43--21 halftime lead. Although Skidmore out-scored Union by 11 points in the second half, the Dutchmen cruised to an 85-74 victory. Musella led Union's scoring attack, drop- ping 30 points on 11-16 shoot- ing. Galletta had another .strong adding 19 'nn·lnT\' and Cap- tain Rob Groelz against out rebounding them 36 to 30, withGroelzpull- ing down 11 boards. The and an in- CJ Rodgers eludes Skidmore defenders- with his baby hook on Friday night edible 94% from the charity stripe. Mon- tana said \The guys created a lot of opportu- nities. They were runn·ing the screens and cuts quite well, which led to good shots. We 'had two good practices, and it showed Fri- day night.'' Groelz added, \After a great practice Thursday, we came out ready to play, and it showed.\ Musella said, ''We bounced 'back afterTuesday night's loss and shot the ball well, that's what we need to do to win.\ Union packed ,their bags for their last away game of the regular: sea- son and headed to Geneva to tip- off against last place Hobart. \I was scared about that game,\ in- sisted Montana. Hobart defeated Rensselaer on Friday night and was lookmg strong. ''Their record is deceiving, and they match up well against us,\ said Montana. The Dutchmen's timidness showed early as the Statesman jumped out to a43·41 halftime lead. However, the second half was a different story for the Dutchmen·. Deter- mined to make the playoffs, Union came out fired up and proved they were capable of playing in post- season action. Union out-scored Hobart by 12 points in the second halfand headed back to Union with an impressive 90-80 win. Dave Musella again led the Dutchmen scoring attack with 28 points and a team ... high six assists. Un.ion had a much more balanced scoring attack with Groelz adding 19 points, Galletta with 17, fresh• man Jason Manning with 14 and freshman Rodgers with 12. Union ended the game shooting 51.2% from the field and 50% behind the arc. \I thought the intensity and energy was great. Those were two tough teams, despite their record. You can't forget anyone can beat anyone on any given night,\ said Groelz The two weekend victories put the team atJ 3.-9 overall and 6-4 in the UCAA. Union also guaranteed itself it's frrstwinning season since the '93-'94 season. Montana, in his third season, was happy about the first winning season, but also said there were three important games left. Montana had been impressed by the play of Musella, Galletta. Rod·gers, Manning, and Groelz. Groelz has been the workhorse for the team, adding valuable advice on and off the court. Manning has much more confidence running the point and Montana attributes his improvements to Woldeyesus. \Zena's attitude and approach to the game during his injury has been outstandin.g. He is just as in- volved and just as important whether he is in in a uniform, >j said Montana. In order to make the play- offs, Union needs to win two of their last three games. The Dutchmen f a c e d M idd I ebury Tuesday night in a non-league game, a game Montana ~ays \is just as im- · portant as league game.\ The Dutchmen close out the: regular season· with St. Lawrence Fri day night at Dutchmen Ftiday night at 8:00 PM in the Memoria:l Field House and they look to beat St. Lawrence and make the playoffs.

The Class of 2603 Is on Its Way Speaker Confirmed Admissioll.s Begins L4!ngthy Application Process by Erin Connolly Staff Writer There has been a wave of appli- caticn fl()oding Union's office of admissi()ns. The scene in Admissions con- sists ofbox:es of paperwork and a staffthat Vo!ork seven days a week, sometimes in sweats and accom· panied by a pet. Union is committed to do what ever it takes to process the re· corded number of applications. A number which is estimated to be- tween 380() and 4000 applications. The numl>ers fluctuate due to du- plicate and incomplete applica- tions. To put these numbers into per- spective f<Jr the non-admissions personnel, take the estimated 3800 applications and multiply them by ten, which is the average numl>er of pages in a common application. The admissions office has taken on one temporary officer to lighten the load. Yet, even with the added pair of hands, the sea of paperwork is as- tonishing. Dan Lundquist, Dean of Admissio11s, referred to the stresses on the Admissions Office as a \clerical challenge.\ What lias caused the surge in applications to Union? Union llas not become a house· hold name across the nation, but in the 11ortlleast it has gained ground. Union has been described as the best kept secret among small private colleges. Dan Lundquist states that Ad- missions has 11ot launched a com- plex recruiting process to achieve the record 11umber of applications; Jeremy Messfer/TC Admissions is inundated with applications for the Class of2003. on the contral)l, as Lundquist ex- pressed, Admissions is \telling the Union story ami Union's story is one that people like to hear. Union, even with.her warts, is still a great place to be.\ Yet whenever applicant numbers increase so d() the unrest in the <:ommunity abo11t increased class size. The admissions' magic num- ller is 520 distinct, diverse stu- dents, whichisilnuniberthat never snrpassed by m()re then I 0 to 15 aclditions to the dass size. There- fore, there should be no worries al>out housing the upcoming class. Admissions is committed to what makes U11i<lnspecial: uncom- mon faculty, an extraordinary stu- dent body, small classes, and a campus that beckons to be mar- veled at. Union does not pretend to be a 11irvana,just a positive place to de- ~elop. Due to this increase in applica- tions, one must ask, \Did the as- p-ects of Union that had plagued her application process in the past disappear?\ Dan Lundquist stated that the \two main concerns apj>licants have wl!en applying to Union is the cost and Schenectady.\ Yet, though cost has risen, the fact that Union's Board of Trust- ees is cost conscious a11d that Union is one ofthe top schools for financial aid has keep appl:ication numbers high despite the rising costs. Also; with Union's plans for in- corporating itself into Schenectady more and more, ap- plicants are becoming less h.:Jsitant about moving to the area. Union has been blessed with a steady increase each year ofappli- ances.

With such connections to the school, Gilmartin promises to be both an interesting and perti- nent speaker. As mentioned in last week's ar- tic1e, the process of selecting a speaker can be overwhelming. While last week's article focused on the student's side of getting a commencement speaker, the President's Office-is also heavily involved. This year's commencement will be President Hull's tenth at Union. Hull stated tha:t although this year's selection process had taken sev- eral months, such a length of time was not unusual. The delay stems from the fact speaker.\ Moreover; because commence- ment speakers receive an honor- ary degree, to pay an additional amount for the speaker is almost an insult to Union. Thus, speakers tend to be more low-profile members of society, defmitelynotthe celebrities desired by students. However, commencement speak- ers do possess strong, admirable character traits that ma:ke them ideal to represent the spirit of Union and the celebration of com- mencement. With all this in mind, R.ay Gilmartin has accepted the invita- tion and President Hull is antici- pating an entertaining and engag- ing commencement.

What does that say to you?\ Smolak's question was greeted with applause and a warm response from Jackson, as it was one of the most memorable questions of the evening. Professor Richard Fox, a Politi- cal Science professor, focused on the media and their behavior as one ofhis academic specialization, and was intrigued by Smolak's ques- tion. In resp()nse to the course of events thattranspired, Fox subMit- ted an Op-Ed pieceto the New York Times, criticizing themedia for their attention and focus on their agenda and'not the· content of the speech, and quoted Smolak's ques- tion, in his piece. Fox's Op-Ed piece, entitled \Audience Partici~ pation,\ appeared in the Times on Thursday, February 11.

The event was designed as a pleasant alternative to the usual weekend dining options. Seating was limited, as the event was free to those who decided to attend. Beginning on the Wednesday prior to the event, those people in- terested in attending were asked to sign up in the Student Activities Office. The response from the student body strong was and the 25 avail- able positions filled up extremely quickly. The sit-down meal was provided and served by Hale House cater- ing. The menu consisted of a French onion soup, tossed salad with balsamic vinaigrette, penne pasta with sundried tomatoes, and mixed berry pie for a dessert that concluded the meal. The e\cellent food was matched by the c<Ozy, inviting atmosphere of Old Chapel, which was nicely decorate<! complete with red ging• ham tabl<Jc:loths. The event was strongly praised by the 25 people enjoying the meal. Deb Leif, a senior, was pleased Leah Selwyn-Baker/TC Twenty-five stude,nts enjoyed a superb dinner on Friday. with the night. She explained, \The food was re- alJy good, and I hope to see more events like this in the future. This was a nice way to end the week.\ Julie Cardettino, a sophomore, \¥as also in attendance. She was also happy with the dinner, espe- cially the atmosphere that 0 ld Chapel provided. \It was so nice! It looked like a little restaurant and it was really nhce to have some place to go and hll\Te good food!\ Steve Schuler, also a sophomore, strongly applauded the evening. He described the event as \Fan- tastic!\ and added that the food 811ld overall atmosphere were excel:.. lent. He claimed that this dinner was much better than what was offered on campus. The Program Assistants, Liz Kaier, Liz Schmitt, Steve Flaherty and Erin Aloan, were happy with the strong turnout and positive re- actions of all those in attendance. Ideally, they would like to spon- sor this event more than once a term. Because ofthe strong tum- out, it seems possible. Liz Schmitt, one of the Program Assistants, pointed out that hav- ing a.completely unique dinner al- ternative was what made the event so successful. All who took advan- tage of the opportunity were very satisfied.

'~ ' Protestant Chaplain Installed In Memorial Chapel by Shaun Montana Staff Writer This past Sunday at 3PM, Union's \new\ Protestant Chap- lain, Vil<i Brooks- McDonald, was formally installed before a crowd of around 150 people in Memorial Chapel. Marked by prayer, soulful singing and some J:ight moments, the ceremony lasted about an hour, and was. followed by a reception in Hale House. The reception was as crowded as the service itself, with everyone present making conver- sation but mostly there to con- gratulate Brooks-McDonald, who has been serving as Protestant Chaplain on campus since the start ofFall Term in 1998. She replaced Rev. Kathleen Buckley, who served as Chaplain at both Union and Skidmore but moved on to become Skidmore's full-time Protestant Chaplain. The service began with the pro- cession in of the numerous local choirs and Protestant Church rep- resentatives, along with the stu- dents and faculty taking part in the service. Twenty local Churches are spon- sors of Protestant Campus Minis- try at Union, and almost all were represented at the service. One of the best parts of the entire service was the numerous choirs that came together to sing. The melodious blending of so many different types of:voices thor- oughly added to what was already a beautiful service and ceremony. These soul-stirring singers came from lO area church choirs, as well as the Union College Chorus. Dur- ing the reception, Nan Blaufuss and her students from St. Stephan\s Episcopal Church played music in the corner of Hale House, much to the enjoyment of those in attendance. The campus was well-repre- sented bythemany student-mem- bers ofSP AM, Spiritual Protestants Active in Ministry, as wellas Union faculty and staff. Gretchel Tyson, director of Affinnative Action and Community Outreach, read the first Scripture reading and Professor Chris Jones of the Physics Depart- ment read the second. Professor Tim Olsen of the Music Depart- ment led the various clioirs in song and Professor Sigrid Ke!1enter, with many powerful words~ led those present in the \Prayer ofinstalla- tion.\ SPAM members Tom Huggins, David Memn, Becky Moyer, Kristen Scheu, and Susan Y oo served as ushers f()rthe event. Current SP AM President Kendra Gray led the\Call to W(:)rship\and participated in the \Qllestions of Installation.\ SPAM Secretary Shannon Arthur led the \Prayer for Illumi- nation.\ Former SPAM President Betsy Butterfield gave a long \Charge to the Students,\ speak- ing of all that McDonald has al- ready done for the campus. She reminded those students present that the center of all .they do on a daily basis is believing in some- thing, and charged them to ques- tion their beliefs. \When you ask yourself why, you get a better understanding of yourself, which leads you to faith. We should all spend sometime this way,\ she continued, acfding that McDonald was there just for that purpose. Rev. Dr. Carl Dudley,Professor of Church and Community at the Hartford Seminary Foundation and long-time friend of Erooks- McDonald~ preached his sermon Sloa11 l\filler/TC Many speakers enlightened the ceremony on Sunc/ay; basedonthesecondreading, taken · tory and it's founding as a non- from Matthew 13:10-17.

To- day, there are three distinct com- munities present here,\ he said. \The students, the faculty and staff, and the general congregation. We are here to install Viki Brooks- McDonald, but in so doing, we are joinjngthese three communities.\ He also offered praise of the wonderful singing of the choirs, and led the congregation in a round of applause for their effort and beautiful singing. Dean ·Brad Lewis offered the \Charge to the Community,\ and spoke of the College's early his- present of the radical innovations ofEiiphaletNott, whow2s a minis~ ter and preacher himself, and how Nott firmly believed it was the College's responsibility to help students with th-eir spi11ituallife as well as their studies, regardless of what their religion was. Lewis fears \we're leaving a reli- gious void ... interest in the commu- nity and studies are notenough ... \ and charged \all those surround- ing the students to support Viki in her work of making Union richer-in the Spirit.\ FormerU11:ion Chaplai11Kathleen Buckley offered a beautiful and light-hearted \Charge to the Chap- lain,\ her friend of many years. \Viki you and 1 knowh()W to give a charge,\ she began, \but did you know the Oxford Englis.h Dictio- nary has 12 columns of \lefmitions for the word charge, and our defi- nition is buried in column eight, defmition 14c?

She con- tinued by asking, \If the wotd the Church uses to install you is so buried, what does that say about the general knowledge of someone who walks through here later and sees a program with the word 'charge'?\ She gav:e McDonald three specific ·charges: to close the gap between the campus commu- nity and the religious. community,. to \stand in the gap between the secu·Iar and the sacred;\ to cross- pollinate the two communities by \moving back ·and forth between them, teaching and Ieamiag, tak· ing and giving;'' and fina.Uy, to \take good care of you.,.it is tiring to stand in the gap and bridge it... play well and often!\ To this end, Buckley presented McDonald with a gift similar to one she was given when she started as Protes- tant Chaplain at Union-. a Super Soaker. \I knew enough notto fill it,\ Buckley fmished on a light note. Students who have walked by Silliman Hall in past Spring terms may remember Buckley sitting on the steps and shooting those who passed by as a way of \making them more aware of Campus Min- istry.\ FinalJy,McDonaldherselfgave short but powerful prayer of clos- ing and Benediction before the pro- cession out.

Common Lunch Hour Reviewed by Academic Affairs Council by Brian Roache StaffWrit,er Two weeks ago, Josh Mondlick, Vice President of Academic Affairs to the Student Forum, vqiced many student concerns about the Com- mon Lunch Hour to the Academic Affairs Council His twenty-minute presentation detailed how crowds at both Dutch and Upper Class have increased ·dramatically since the change to the Common Lunch Hcmr. With _graphs and .har<i figures from Din- ing Services, Josh provided indis- putable evidence of how there is a shortage of tables, and a length- ening of lines between 12:05 and 12:45. Josh then provided the AAC with analternative sclledule, which he believed would solve both the students need for more lunch space, and the faculty concern for a common meeting time. The fol- lowing week, the issue was sent to a sub-committee by the AAC. This past Thursday, that special sub-committee met to evaluate the situation. It should be noted that this situation is extremely complex due to the large number ofsched- uling conflicts between professors and students. In a report obtained by Concordiensis, the AAC sub- committee outlined the situation and presented some possible so- lutions. According to the report, students, who are faced with a va- riety of tasks in the middle of the day, are limited in their choice of time to eat. Many faculty wlto sup- port the current system prefer it because of the availability of the common meeting time, and the in- creased ease in the scheduling of labs. After stating the complex: re- quirements of any plan, tile com- mittee went on to offer some sug- gestions. The flrst was similar to Mondlick's proposal. This would provide for four common meeting periods, back to back on Tuesday and Thursday. The committee cites that this proposal is not feasible because it would make Tuesday/ Thursday very long for any pro- fessor or student with two labs. For instance, morning labs would be- gin at 8:00 AM, the common pe- riod would beginat !lAM, and af- ternoon labs would begin at 1:30. A II of that works out to the egre- giously long 8.5 hour day. The committee stated the only advan- tage of this proposal was a short schedule on MWF. Additionally, the committee failed to state the obvious fact, which opened this entire discussion, the overcrowd- ing in Upper Class would disap- pear. The next suggestion was to move the common hour away from lunch. However, the committee dis- missed this proposal just as ence and engineering. N.e:xt would be to expand current d·in ing hall, an option which is likely to be ex- pensive and not feasible; Finally, the committee would like to encour- age students without class to eat before the lines buildup, even though more than half the student body and most of our friends are in class untill2:05. Where does this leave the Union student body?\ ... none ofthe op- tions are optimal, but each benefit requires some cost,\said Mondlick. \It appears that the most benefit without cost may be no change at all.\ Apparently, Union students will continue to brave those lines. quickly, stating that\ .. .it [is] es- .---------------------------- sentially impossible for MWF labs not to conflict with three class pe- riods; for that reason, this option is simply not viable.\ The option which appears to be the most vi- able is alsothe mostcomplex.. This option would stagger the times of the 11 :00 class on MWF. This would mean that on any MWF, some students would be out of class at 12:05, some at 12:15, and some at 12:25. While this appears confusing, it still provides some students a head start on the lunch block, and meetings will not be able to begin until all the 12:25 students are out. Finally,thecommitteemadesug-. gestions which would ease the overcrowding, but not alter the current schedule. These included the rean·angement of the dining halls to accommodate more stu~ dents, more mobile food carts like FRED, especially for people in sci~ Rebecca Walsh/TC Fero House, located near Richmond, will soon he renovated for use by the brothers of Alpha Delta Phi next fall.

On February seventeenth, con- duct charges were filed against a Greek Organization for haz- ing. So without pointing fmgers, it has been established that hazing occurs on Union's Campus. Theta Delta Obi's national wel:Jpage defines hazing as \any action taken or situation created, .intentionally, whether on or off fratemity premises, and whether with consent or not to produce mental or physical discomfort, embar- rassment, harassment or ridicule. Such actions include but are no:t limited to any activities which are not consistent with fratemal law, ritual, or policy, or federal, state, or local laws,\ and goes oil to say that hazing is prohibited by TD-· Chi. :..•!•· · · ·' .. sigma Delta tau elabonites on this policy, ''Such activities and situations include creation of ex- cessive fatigue, physical and psy- chological shocks; wearing pub- licly, apparel which is conspicu- QUS and not nonnally in good taste; engaging in public stunts and jokes; morally degrading or hu- miliating games and activities; late night sessions which interfere with schQlastic activities; and any other activities which are not consistent with the regulations and policies ofthe educational institution.\ All fraternities. and sororities on Union '·s campus have similar poli- cies.

It makes them seem like cults, anxiously for new victims to torment. Greek houses are supposed to be · a positive force in the community. This means that their members must be wil'ling to participate in community service activities and other positive events. Hell week and other hazing practices take the focus off of the real reason one should join a Greek organization, which is to promote the interests of the chapter.

Anyone who claims that hazing does not happen at Union, needs only to look at the Security Incident Report this week. Hazing is a prob- lem here. No, someone has not died in a hazing incident. Yet. Hazing is potentially psychologically and physically dangerous. It should not be practiced, at all, on Union's campus.

In retaliation. lsraeli:aircraft attacked sites along the Lebanese 'border. Security officials. speaking on customary condition of anonymity, said three Israeli soldiers were killed and four others wounded in the gun battle that preceded air ~tt-ikes by Israeli jet fighters and helicopters. The murders took place in the Israeli ''security zqne.\ a strate- gic sector of land specia llypatrolled to pm- tect the northern region oflsrael. This was the first killi11g of the year. but the problem has persisted for the entir-e modern history of the Jewish State. A conflictiltg report from the other party claimed different results. In a st<\tement is- sued in Beirut the lranim1-backed Hezbollah group said the Israeli conm1andos tried to in filtrate the fi·ontline ncar the village of Meidoun, 11 n1iles west orR.ashaya in south- eastem Lebanon.

This report claimed that Israeli jets and hellcupters bombed these villages heavily, firing three air-t<l-surface missiles ~nd returning an hour later to fire additional missiles. The event that probably set into motion tile most recent skirmishes occurred the day before. On Monday. lsraeliwarplanes raided suspected guerrilla bases following an at- tack on an Israeli outpost in a distant patt of the front line, near the port city of Tyre.

12 · February 25, Two weeks ago, the Prin~eton Review published their latest guide to Colleges. As in the past, tlle Princeton Review interviewed students from various Colleges and. Universities to compile their list of the 3 11 best schools in the cotmtry. Unlike the US Ne·ws and World Report, the Princeton Review bases its rank- ing system on the responses given to them by the students and the Ad- missions offices of the schools that they rank. Their review states that \the initial Ust was built through con- sultation with a variety of expert sources. including fifty indepen- dent educational consultants fro111 throughout the nation.'' The 3 I 1 best colleges represent \less than I 0 percent of all colleges in the nation.\ The 311 colleges that the Princeton Review chooses are the best colleges from the responses that they receive. Yet, what are the questions that are used to rank the various schools that make it into the an- nual guide? The questionnaire is divided up into four sections. These sections are A bout Yourseff. Your School's Academics and A cl- ministration. Students and lastly, Life at your School. Every kind of question is asked: ·'How many out- of-class hours do you spend study- ing each day? And, '\how widely u most questions are multiple choice. the survey does offer the students an opportunity to further express, in their own words, how they feel about the school they are attend- ing. It is these responses that even• tually \be.come the sources forthe student quotes that appear throughout each entry•· in the guide. So who are the ,people that they interview for this publication? For the 1.999 edition \hundreds of thousands of students in total have been surveyed on the various cam- puses that comprise the best 3 I 1 .'' According to the Princeton Re- t•iew, eachecfftlon includes ''intor- tn!ition based on the opinions of nearly 60,000 students.'' After all the responses have been collected, they are ''stored in our database, and each college is given a grade- point-average.'\ These GPA's are then used to ·•compare student opinions from college to college, and to gauge which aspects ofthe complete experience at each col- lege rate highest and lowest ac- cording to the institution's own students.\ After all ofthis is done, the Col- lege or University is given two main rankings. The tirst ranking is the schools Academic Rating. The seco11d rating is the schools Quality of Life Rating.

Well, we rank very well in the Academic Rating category. Out of a possible one hundred points, Union College received eighty-eight points. In th~ category of Quality of Life Rating, how- evet·, we did not do as well. \Union needs to update itself to the late twentieth century\ Out of a possible one hunJr-ed points Union College recei·ved seventy-six points. That score is. however understandable when we look at what this category is made up of. The Quality of Life category is divided into Peace of Mind, ... Campus Beauty, Food, Dorms atld Location.

It was about the size of an egg. It was big, brown, and had all of these crevices and wrinkles. It was fas:.. egory. Each s~he>o l that makes the book, however, is also divided into other categories. There are seven other categories besides Academ ... ics and Quality of Life. They in- cluded Adrn inistration, Demo• graphics, Extracurriculars, Parties, Politics, Schoo] Type and Social Life. This is where the results of the surveys get interesting. Union placed in <Jnly four of these seven categories. Union C<>llege we should be proud, we should stand tall, we were ranked in three out of the four subcategories of the Partying cat- egory. Unioll was ranked fitth in the country tor th.e amount of beer consumed. \V eah us, we drink a'lot of beer. We were ranked sixth in the country f&r major Greek Life. Well, thatpret~y much goes with- out saying. Union is considered to be the M()ther of Fraternities. Lastly, we were ranked eleventh tor the amount of hard \liquor con- · sumed on c~mpus. If we try really hard, maybe we might in the fu- ture be nu.rnbe.r one in either the beer or harclliquor categories. The only subcategory we missed was drug cons,umption.

Union was third ln the country for students wanting more to do on campus. We were ranked fifth for strained town-school re- lations. This is another one that could have gone without saying. The majority of us do not like the \do ids\ and they do not I ike us. So this one is self-explanatory as well. We also surprisingly enough made the c;ategory of Exttacurricu Iars. Out of five sub- categories we were ranked in two. .Union College was number nine for great College radio stations. Our own newspaper Con,·ordien- sis, was rank.ccl seventeenth in College newspapers that \ge1 read.'' Lastly, under school by type, Union was dubbed a \Jock School.'' With twenty-five varsity teams f()r a school of only two- thousand students, we deserve this ranking as well as all other rankings that we received, So what does this mean for Union.? It says that we an: a sehoul of the 50's, th~ 1950's that is. We are a Greek oriented, partying, Jock school.

Because ofmytid.ictilous sched- ule of four classes and ,ex,tracur:. rioular over-e:xertion, I have to make a very rigid daily plan for myself. This doesn't inv<>lve riluch \social studying\ in p,hlces like Dutch HoJ:low or highly visible places in the library; l kno~ that the majority of people are fully capable of studying with friends ~round and an influ~ of familiar faces wa.lking past them, but I per- sonally know that any distractions meanwastedtimeand usttal1y, that wasted time is time that could be spe11t sleeping (my favoi'ite pas- time). So, I try to get my vvork done efficiently, without any ex:traneous chit-chat. I will hide in a cubicle in the basement of the library or escape to the Nott where it is ·al- ways quiet. I have my own paint- ing studio in North Coi<Jnn.ade so I can find solitary refuge there. Generally, 1 prefer being alone with my thoughts and am much more productive that way .• Once in a while ifmyweek isnot()verflow-· ing with exams and research projects, I will sit with a ti-iend and do some quiet reading that doesn't require too much concentration.

I accomplish tasks mu'cJ1 more. quickly while I am -,,. alt)Be.a!Klthatgives me 1noretime to secia'tizelater on. However, the one downfall of being so busy and rushing around in my own I ittle world is an issue of persona I safety. I must admit that on those late nights of studying or painting, I often find myself i!Tlpatient and yearning for the ='ttelcom ing warmth of my bed. J d()n't have the •·time'\ to wait for Escort to ar- rive, and more often than not, I will just walk home alone. My friends constantly yell at me fordoing so. but l have always had a 11othing- wm~happen-to-me attitude. Honestly, I have never been scared of walking home in the dark. It never really crossed my mind that my personal safety was being compromised. And this is not prefacing my revealing of some harrowing incident that hap- pened to me. I am currently safe and u_nharmed, and have yet to be taught a: lesson for my stubb{)m desire to walk hort1e alone in the dark. But r did come to a realization ·\Those habits of mine wltere 1 con- tinually compro- • mesemyown stzfety, whether it be walking alone or forgetting_ to Jock doors, are unnecessary temp- tations.for bad things to happen.\ on my own.

But I did see, for the tirst time in my 20- years, that it was possible that something awful could have hap~ pencdto me just because I believed thatJ was safe on my own. In my home town, I ge11erally go nmning alone during a11y time ofthe night and do not tear for my safety. After a late movie, I watch as my friends and I each walk to different cars and drive off into the night. On weekends when my par- ents are away, I forget to check if the front door is locked before I go to bed. 1 suppose l grew up un- afraid ofthe evils ofthe world and ignorant of the dangers that do exist outside of my idealized vi- sion ofhuman nature. 1. am not trying to say that we should all be can·ying pepper- spray in our baqk pockets or that young children should be taught · to fear ev~rything about society. Altnoughwe learn early on not to talk to \strangers:' ~he majority of us do not walk around in fear of all unfamiliar faces. The world would tHen be a very scary and paranoht-filled place. What l have come th'see is that I am not invin- cible. Tho~e habits of tnine where I continually compromise my own safety, whether it be walking alone or forgetting tQ lock doors. are unnecessary temptations for bad things to happen. Although I have long since lost my fear ofthe Boogie Monster or the shadows in my closet, I do have new evils to face. Next year I will . be living alone at Albany Medical College and never before have I been so aware of the fact that I am a vulnerable female. I will not have the comforts. of the Escort van to rescue me from .strangers strollii1g through campus and I will not have the lux.ury of such an en~losed liv- ing environment. The real world brings with it new ''monsters\ to hide under my bed, ones which can actually harm me if I am not careful. I am glad I learned my lesson now. though.

Olestra is the fat substitute found in various snack chips mar- keted by Procter and Garnble, in- cluding Pringles, Frito Lays, Doritos. Ruff1es, Tostitos and Lays chips.

Lippman Contributing IYriler On Saturday, February 7, while here at Union College, students were enjoying their weekend or studying for midterms, scientists that work for NASA were oversee- ing the launch of an unmanned space probe. appropriately called Stardt1st. The goa] ofthis seven-yearmis- . sian is to capture and bring · samples of interplanetary and in- terstellar dust back to the Earth. Stardust will be traveling at speeds of 13,800 to 28.000 m.p.h .. It will make a total of three trips around the sun. Another part of Stardust's mis- sion will be to collect dust from·a comet named Wild-2 that is cur- rently 346.3 million miles f1·om Earth. This comet was recently pulled from its distant orbit into the innel' solar system by Jupiter's gravitational force. Only having made two close passes around the sun, the chemi- cals that make up this comet would not have been altered by the t!X- treme heat. The contents of this and all comets are time capsules. storing samples of chemicals that condensed from the cosmic cloud to form the planets, moons, and asteroids some 4.6 billion years ago. Another interesting fact is that the chemicals that make up com- ets like Wild-2 consist mainly of ice and carbon compounds. These compounds match the basic chellli- cals thm make up living bdngs. Another reason to study astet'- oids is that approximately 65 mil- lion years ago, a large chunk ofwck and ice is believed to have collided with this planet, ultimately caus- ing the extinction of the dinosaurs. Finding, tracking, and learning the composition of these large rocks ''Th.e goal of this . seven-year mission is to ·capture ani/ bring sa1nples o.f inteJplanetttJY and interstellar dust back to the Earth.\ is a worthy goal because these knowledge may enable us to pre- vent a future collision.

The first part ofthe mission will be to collectin- terstellar pa1ticles from a stream of cosmic dust and other particles that flow between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. There is actually a large current of cosmic dust which tlows from the direction of the constellation Sagittarius. This is also the gen- i era! direction i11 which the sun is headed. Its first orbit around the sun will bring the probe to a posi-- tion near Mars sometime in the year 2000. A second orbit-will bring it back to this position in the year 2002.

Christie Put It All Together \With Style by Lori Greene A&E Editor Directed by Spencer Christie,. the Mountebanks production of Put~ ling it Together was delightful! l haven't had that much fun in the Yulman Theatre in a long time. The show, performed last Friday, Sat- urday and S~omday was a revuesical of Stephen Sondheim songs, described by the director as \the ultimate test of any per- former.\ The cast, which aside from Christie and junior Devon Ciampa, was composed of Union Theatre first-timers. Alison Struzziero '0 I, Mark McKee '0 1, Honorah Tinti '0 I and pianist Joanne Mumley '0 I wowed the audience with their bold voices and amazing stage presence. I found the music to be chann- ing as the actors told simple, easy- to-follow stories. It was a show which required little thought on behalf of the audience. This was a welcome change from the typically deep, thought provoking shows the theatre program has been used to. Forthefrrsttime since I'ye been at Union, the ~udience had a clue as to what was going on, on stage. Christie, a sophomore theatre and music major, who has been involved in several UnionTheatre productions, took on the mammoth task of directing the forty musical num- bers inthe show.

The team, whiCh stood in last place, seven points out of JOth place and final playoff spot, faced off against two teams in Dartmo~th and Vermont that were tom and tied for 8th place in the ECAC, respectively. The Dutchmen lost to both teams in Novemberon the road. On Friday n;ight against Dartmouth, the Dutchmen, after netting ·the first goal of the. game, went on to lead 2-1 going into the· third period. The third period, which had been Union's period of decline all season, p:wved to be so again. Union saw the Big Green tally four times including once on an empty net to defeat the Dutch~ men 5-2. Senior captain Mark Szucs scored his eighth goal of the sea~ son at 4:10 of the first period when he scored the Dutchmen's first even-strength goal in 290 minutes, 50 seconds. Union, who has been prone to giving up quick goals af.· ter scoring, gave up:agoaljust 2:50 later wheil Zach Hafer tied the score. Dutchmen senior goaltender Leeor Sll.trom, playing in just bis third game after return- ing from abrokenclavicle, was su- perb in goalstoppin.g 42 shots, in- cluding a tremendous flurry mid- way through the seeond period. After Shtr()m stopped a flurry of Dartmoutl! chances, including five shots in front of the crease, Ma- son Ander.son scored putting Union up 2-1. Forihe fifth timetllisseason, the Dutclun entook a lead into the third period.. The Dutchmen then pro- ceeded to fall apart. Scott Peach scored the tying goal for the Big Green at 7:45 of the period, beating Leeor Shtrom who -was screened by his own defensernen, just iwo seconds after Uniofl had killed a penalty. Dartmouth then scored t\.vo goals in a span of just 37 sec- onds on two fout-f()ur situatians. Dartmoutll ended the scoring at 19: 17 of 1lte periocl when Ryan Chaytors scored his second goal of the evening, semling the puck into Union'semptygo~l. \We're ltp 2~1, g<Jing into the win,. we <>t<~rt,..n,, playing not to lose.

Almost destined for a state and maybe national championship, the Dutchmen show no sign for re- morse. In a long tradition of win- ning, this year's team will do any- thing but disappoint the legacy. In a phrase, they are unbeatable. Led by captainsJeffHoerle and Dave Searles, who will win their respec- tive events in both states and na- tionals, the rest of the team will fol- low. \Fueled by: Bacon Egg & Cheese\ is the slogan for this years pledge to the national champion- ship, and though Junior Bill Flick does not use cream cheese, but tomatoes, he will still win the 50 free at nationals. In previous weeks there has been a bit of an alterca- tion between the good people of Naples and the Union College swim team. Fueled by adrenaline, the Dutchmen ousted the challenging FSU students who badgered their way into a tightly knit communica- tions link with the help of an infor- mant. Not to worry though, the leak, Women's diver Katie Meloney, was caught and tried on grounds ofheresy. Freshman Kyle Schack, \til do\ took care of the situation without too much hassle. Senior Matt Mauriello, a shoe in for the 200 I.M. at nationals had . ' this to say on the matter, \as a team we pulled together, and individu- ally we remained strong.'' Fresh- man Pete Cotritori, who was disap- pointed with his missing the quali- fYing 'time in the 1650 by one sec- ond, coinedthe phrase that has be- come the unofficial freshman motto, \Suck .It.\ Junior Rob Kirkman was very happy with his three week taper that should drop his time in the 200 breaststroke enough to win states and finish top ten in nationals. Sophomore Mike Webb, who refused to comment on record, seemed •enthusiastic with· his 10.9 ina fly&printtoday in prac• tice; Webb has improved tremen- dously this year will finish in the top eight at states in the 200 fly. Sophomorebackstroker, Nate Mar- tin, who joined the team because of a Brazilian student exchange system, has everything it takes to be a national finisher in the 100 back. This year\s team looks to be as strong as ever, and the biggest problem seemsto be arranging the missing of class for all of the team members who will be traveling to . nationals.

After they had chatted, Leno asked Goldberg about the World Wrestling Federation's Stone Cold Steve Austin, who bears a striking resemblance to Goldberg, but many say that it is the other wayaround. Goldberg's first response to Leno' s question about Aust,in was a quick \Who?\ and then talked about the shadow that has perpetUally overshadowed him, and went on to make a chiille11ge to Austin, saying that he would- put \$1 00,000 on tile line anytime, any place, eve11 the NBC studios.'• After tllat the show ended with Leno imitating an amt.ouncer in mocking ton~.

Union Able to Put Season J!ehind Them As the Squad Takes Fourth Finale by Rachel Bukowski StaffWriter Afterthe Swimming and Diving Teams' UCAA meet in early De- cember, Head Coach Judy Wolfe addressed her tired and incredibly sore swimmers and divers. \I know you are all tired, and I know you are all sore\ Wolfe stated, \but I promise this will all be worth it in the end. Think of your body as a bank account, .and every day, you put a little bit more in. All the other teams are taking out their money little by little as the season goes on, but you are taking it all out at the end, and getting something great out of it.\ This past weekend, February 18- 20, every hour of practice, every impossible set, and every weight lifted came into play for Union Women's Swimming and Diving Team, as they all swam an incred- ible meet at States at Hamilton Col- lege, placing fourth overall out of sixteen teams. Union was in third place for al- most the entire meet until the final day of events, when LeMoyne Co liege, who had previously been close behind the Dutchwomen, managed to squeak by and main- tain third place until the close of the meet. However, this perfor- mance was by far the best of the year for the swimmers and divers, who h.ad entered tile meet with a disappointing 1-8 regular season record. They defe_ated Hartwick College and St. Lawrence Univer- sity, who had beaten Union in the regular season, etnd other power- ful Division III teams presentat the meet such as Alfred University, RPI, and Skidmore College. The meet was highlighted by an array of lifetime bests and s~ason bests, and a number of top eight performances. Day I saw the 400 Medley Relay of Sarah Rankowitz, Vic Dreier, Erin Wittes, and Kerry Librandi place third; the 200 Freestyle relay of Librandi, Rankowitz, Rachel Miller, artd Sara Dietrich place sixth; Kerry Librandi place fifth. in the 200 Freestyle; and Erin Wittes and Clewis Kinnett take fittfl and sixth in the 200 Individual Medley. Although the soreness had be gull to kick in by the start of Day 2, the Dutchwomen continued to prevail with a fifth place finish in the800 Freestyle relay of Miller, Kinnett, Librandi, and Wittes; a fifth place finish by the 200 Med- A lfTJion Swimmer races for the finish during the 200 Freestlye relay. ley relay of Rankowitz, Wittes, Kinnett, and Miller; a seventh place finish by Kerry Librandi in the 200 Freestyle; a fourth place finish in the 400 Individual Medley by Kinnett; Rank ow itz' s seventh place finish in the I 00 Backstroke; and a second place finish in the 400 Individual Medley by Wittes, which missed the National B cut by .4 seconds. On Day 3, the Dutchwomen slipped to fourth place, but had no shortage of out- standing performances, as seen in the fourth place 400 Freestyle re- lay of Miller, Librandi, Wittes, and Rankowitz, Librandi's sixth place finish in the 1650 Freestyl.e; Rankowitz's eighth place finish in the 200 Backstroke; and Wittes's and Kinnett's second. and fourth place finishes in the 200 Breast- stroke. Head Coach Judy Wolfe stated that, \I couldn't be happier with the performance of my swimmers at this meet. All their hard work has finally paid off.\ The women's season has finally come to a close, and the team has mixed emotions about the end of their season; however, everyone will carry with them confidence and the satisfaction of knowing that they have completed a difficult and often times trying season, along with hundreds of memories which will never be forgotten.
