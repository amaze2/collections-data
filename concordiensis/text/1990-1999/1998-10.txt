There are many ways thatthe college already tries to increase its exposure to a more extensive public scope. For example, they work with commu- nity based programs in high schools and churches, try to offer scholarships for encouragement, and they also send infonnation to specific people whose names they buy nom vendors. Theadmissions office also encourages the stu- dents to visit campus and hopes to eventually be able to organize bus trips to make it easier for stu- dents to visit. The bottom line is that to increase diversity one must increase exposure and all of those students who would like to see Union College grow in reputation and diversity are more than wel- come to help Dean Lundquist with his volunteer program. What would a volunteer be doing? Dean Lundquist describes the program as \volunteer friendly,. and hopes to make it a fun experience for those who choose to pruiicipate. The most important student volunteer activity involves student to stu- dent contact. Volunteers could write letters, e-mail, or even make telephone calls to perspective stu- dents. The deans also hope that stu,':{ents will f31!-8gest places for the college to vis~t, ·or specific high schools or community organiza- tions to which information could be sent.

Perspectives at the Nott by Brooke Barylick News EdittJr On Wednesday, October 7 at 7:30, Julia Alvarez will be present- ing her interesting and informative lecture on \The making ofa Writer.~· Itwilltak~place in theNottMemo- rial.as a Minerva Lec:ture and part of the Perspectives at the Nott se- ries. This series is desi[{iled to bring a variety of speakers to the Union College campus in an attempt to educate the students about issues that are not dealt with on a regular basis in the class room. Julia Alvarez has 'Wfitten many award winning novels including How the Garcia Girls Lost Their Accents, In the Time of the. But- terflies, and Yo! In addition to these pieces, Ms. Alvarez has also au.th()red many poems that have helped give a dis- tinct voice to Latina women and il· lustrate the struggles that they face on a daily basis. All ()f her works demonstr~te a unique writing style that is rich in culture and history. Ms. Alvarez is a native of the Dominican Republic. Much of her work revolves around the struggles between the emotional ties to the homeland and the desires to es~ tablish a new American identity. She explains the difficulties that one faces when trying to balance familiar mores and nonns with new cultural expectations and customs. Ms. Alvarez speaks candidly about the alienation and assimila- tion she experienced. She also edu- cates her listeners about history and politics, along with the impor- tant role they play. Finally, she breaches the thresholdbetween ac- cent and native speech. This event is sponsored by the Minerva Committee with support from Circulo Estudiantil Latino Americano (CELA), the English Department, the History Depart- ment, and the Latin American and Caribbean Studies Program. It promises to be a fascinating and educational program that an will enjoy immensely.

The high school students played, danced and twirled flags and guns. The whole display was a whirl of colors and sounds. The groups completed their performance and the crowd came to its feet in antici- pation of the next spectacle. Far overhead an airplane could be seen circling the field.

Class of 1998 graduate J~y Borowiecki joked, \I think Hobart has stolen our mascot.\ Tensions grew as both ·the Hobart and · Union teams returned to the field with no sign of Dutch.

Fox's line of reasoning was the Professm: Fux, of the .Political idea that as Americans, \We have lost perspective on the seriousness ,of the crime.\ Clinton's resignation would place him on the same level as Nixon and that comparison,. in Fox~s view, is a dangerous one. He does not consider the perjury and witness. tampering to be of the same magnitude. Moreover, Fox argued that if Clinton resigned, \It would be the validation of a completely o11t of control medial.process.\ After Fox and Greenberg closed their arguments, tbe audience was encouraged to ask questions and express their points of view. The :majority of those in attendance were students. with only a few pro- fessors in attendance along with Deans ShurickandAlford. Senior Brian Mitchell addressed . . . ·' the issue, saying, \I don't think that the more power you have, the less responsibility you have fo.r your actions.'' This comment was in re- sp•,mse to Fox's belief that this sort of scandalous activity has occurred in the White House before and that it is a dangerous precedent to set in forcing a President to resign for those actions. Professor Fox's argument that Clinton should not resign because that would place him on the same level as Nixon was met with em- phatic response from Sophomore Michael Cerussi. Cerussi .proposed, \'Is anyone whose crime isn't as great as Nixon 's,not responsible for those actions?\ That q11estion posed an interesting li11e of thought concerning. the qua.ntifi~ cation of dishonesty and the idea that crime is on different \levels.\ Overall, the debate spa~lced many engaging. argumerrts and brought members of the campus into contact with one another to discuss national issues.

In addi- tion, he wanted to make the Union College site comparable to those colleges with which Union comptes. The new and improvedweb site has around 1600 pages and is tap- idly growing. The old site was re- stricting in that it only offered those looking at the web site 13 options to choose from. The Web Policy Board and some members of our campus community met with the purpose of creating a more navigable site and one that would be able to continue grow- ing. They also wanted it to be eas- ily accessible and attractive for the college students. Some new features have. been added to the Campus Life section of the site where you willbe:able to post classified ads.

Another new addition t<l the Campus Life section is a ride bCJard, whic~ we do not seem to have at the present and which \'ill be a large benefit to those students without cars. You can access this section of the site by the same method as aforementioned. · Not only will you be able tore- questaride from Uniononthe.web, but if you have access to the internet at home, you will be able ta ask for a ride back to Uni<>n via computer. This saves students from making various phone calls. ·There are some other Clunges that will benefit the student body as well as per~pective students. The admissions catalog has been updated on the web site· as well as the course catalog for this year. An additional item that may help student and professot· relation- ships; is the increasing ttuml>er of professors and students :wl:to are and have been creating tlleir (}Wn web pages. This will offer students an cp- portunity to maybe learn S(}me background information &bout their professors, and perhaps of- fer professors the same opportu- nity regarding their students. There . are also \Hot Buttons\ on the first page ofthe site which give students or whoever may be looking at the site the option to read up on importantor \hot\ issu:eson Union's campus, such as Sopho- more Rush. These ''Hot Butt.ons\ change a couple times a week. The .. Hot Buttons\ ~an give perspective stu- dents and a'umni the opportunity to read up on what is going on at Union.

Lastly, there are links to student-run groups and organizations that can be accessed through the web site, which can be very helpful f()r new students. These spots provide infomation about the clubs and what their projects are. Morse also mentioned projects that he and others are working on for the future.ofthe Union College WebSite.

There is the possibility that we may be able to purchase selected merchandise from the Bo()kstore through the web site. Morse and others are working on making a section ofthe web site that will ad- vertise activities for students to take part in, such as discounts at local ski resorts and restaurants.

Schroeder Defeats Kohl in German Election by Dan Kirsch Staff Writer BONN-Germans elected a new government S-unday by rejecting the 16-year incumbent conserva- tive party and. voting instead for aa Government to be headed by socialists and environmentalists. German Chancellor Helmut Kohl was the loser Sunday in an elec- tion that was decided primarily by the high Ullemployment rate in both the former East Germany and the former WestGerrnany. In the eastern region the jobless rate is near twenty percent, while it is nearly half that in the west. Perhaps just as important are the subsidies thatthe·Gennan govern• ment has had to dole <lUt to recon- struct eastern Germany both eco- nomically and politkally. Since eastern Getrnans can not afford to repair their region by themselves, higher taxes have been forced onto western Germans in order to bring the stagnant half of their nation out of the doldrums. Under Kd!tl, Bolll1 has repeat- edly (ten times) either raised taxes or created new ones. Theilighest tax rate is now 53 percent and the gross domestic product undet di- rect govemmen t control is 4 7 per- cent. Most analysts agree that Kohl has fatally alienated his base constituency by failing to adhere to a more conservative program. As a resuLt of this and a feeling of relative stagnation amongst Ger- man citizens Social Democratic leader Gerhard Schroeder won in a rout, gaining a plurality of the vote in Germany's proportional r:epre- sentation system. This system re- lies on voting percentages rather than winners and losers on a seat- by ... seat basis. The Social Demo- crats (SPD) won approximately 41 percent, whlletheconservatives- the Christian Democratic Union/ Christian Social Union (CDU/ CSU)-won 35 percent. In order to gain representation in the German Bundestag (parlia- ment), a party must win over 5 perM cent of the national vote. Minor parties who clearedthishurdlein- cluded the environmentalist Alli- ance 90/The Greens, with 6. 7 per- cent, the moderate Free Democratic Party: The -Liberals, who won 6.2 percent, and the Party of Demo- cratic Socialism (Partei Democratik socialismus Deutschlands or PDS)-the remnants of the East German Communist Party-with 5.1 percent. Schroeder has very frrmly stated that he will not consider forging a coalition with the former Commu- nists. The PDS is viewed with sus- picion by Germans~ Europeans, and Americans. However, such a move may not harm Germany's dip- lomatic standing with Europeans. The French and Russian govern- ments contain Communists with powerful ministerial portfolios, and the Italian governing coalition's largest party is the former Commu- nist party. Even Britain, with its promises of\N ew Labour\ clearly has a large portion of old-line so- cialists in its government. Instead, Schroeder is attempting to farm a coalition with Alliance 90/ The Greens, who favor most ofhis socialist party platform. Ifthe alli- ance is indeed ferged, this gov~m­ ment would. be the most radical in postwar German history. A \Red- Green\ coalition has already be- come reality in .several German states and new it looks as ifit will occur nationally. The Greens have stated clearly that they are only interested in negotiations to form a coalitien if they are the first cen- sidered. Being that they are the largest third party in parliament, they will undoubtedly receive first consideration. Ifthe Liberals are brought in to help form a tempo- rary caretaker government, the Greens have saidtheywill pullout of negotiations. If that happens, Schroeder has net ruled out the possibility of a \grand coalition\ with the Christian Democrats. That unwieldy arrangement has not been repeated since the govern- ments ofthe 1970s. Schroeder, in his effort to gain the chancellery, has compromised on a number of routine socialist initiatives. He has promised tax breaks for the middle class and some welfare reforms. Schroeder has referred to the constituency of the center-left his party now en- joys. as the \New Middle\ clearly a frie;dly plagiarization Of Bill Clinton's \New Democrat:\ cam- paign in the U.S., and Tony Blair's \New Labour'' campaign in the U.K. He has also promised a continuity in Germany's foreign policy that suggests that far left SPD members and the Greens are out ofluck when it comes to one oftheir core issues, withdrwal from NATO. This pro- posed policy has long been a part of the Greens' pacifist party programme but is clearly not on Schroeder's agenda. Other miner parties who did not gain representation in parliament included the Republican Party, the National Democratic Party (Na- tional Democratischepartei Deutchlands or\ NPD), and the German People~s Union (Deutsche Volksunion or J?VU), all of which are far right andneo-Naziparties. These parties cumulatively won 5.9percentofthevote. TheDVU came closest to representation with :3 percent, as many had ex- pected. Because of the failure of the DVU, NPD, and the Republi.- cans to gain the. necessary per- centage, their share will be divided up between the tive existing par- ties. The DVU had. shocked the in- ternational community when it won 13 percent in stat~ elections in the eastern German state of Saxony-Anhalt. The DVU is both finan.ced and led by Munich- based far-right millionaire pub- lisher Gerhard Frey. Many predicted they would gain at least the five percent of the vote needed Sunday to gain rep- resentation. This was clearly im- possible, however, when the tra- ditional neo-Nazi standard bearer refused to fomi a voting bloc with that party. When asked why the National Democrats-considered to be the most direct successor to Adolf Hitler's National Socialist Workers Party-did not fonn such a b1oc,. party Ieader·u do Voigt said the NPDwouldnever ally with the DVU, a \phantom party''. The in- suit is based on the belief that the DVU is essentially a one-member party, with Frey's disciples sim}fly hanging ort his every word. If the German economy continues to sag and these two parties end up even- tually uniting, they wouldundmibt- edly have as much .influence as the former Communists in the Bundestag. Unemployment is up to 17 per- cent in the eastern states, especially among the young. For this reason, fringe parties are not catering to their old constituency of World War UeraNazis and Cold War Com~ munists. Instead, they are ditect- ingtheii efforts at young skinheads and young blue-collar workers who are the most active partici- pants in fringe German politics. The neo•Nazis in particular aie routinely arrested for race-:rnoti~ vated gang violence and anti- Semitic and neo-Nazi propaganda distribution,illegal since World War II. In any event, these six very dif- ferent voting blocs form the spec- trum of German politics. The star of the show is now a 54-year-old- man who; on the night ofhis elec- tion to parliament, became intoxi- cated and stood upon the fence of the chancellery offict;l and ~houted \Let me in!'' The departing star played a central role in the reunifi- cation ofbothGermany and Europe and has been praised by European. leaders since the election for his, undoubtedly high place in history. Sincethewaningdays ofthe cam- paign, a frustrated leader has report- edly said \To Hell with history!\ Indee.d. Pakistan-India to Sign Test Ban Treaty by Heather Clements Stlfjf Writer United Nations - Pakistan and India have announced to the Gen- eral Assembly that they will sign the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty withrn ~ne year. Ever since India and Pakistan's nuclear tests in May, both coun- tries have faced high sanctions and diplomatic pressure from the international community to sign the treaty. Pakistan's Prime· Minister, Nawaz Sharif, explained that Pakistan's decision to sign the CTBT was fueled by his nation's desire to have the sanctions lifted. Pakistan's decision later caused India to follow suit. President Clintonresponded to Pakistan's initiahnnouncementby praising the decision, but also stat- ing that there would be no lifting of sanctions until the CTBT was formally ratified. After putting pressure on India to follow Pakistan's lead, Indian Prime Minister, Atal Behari Vajpayee, announced on Tuesday that India would sign the CTBT. India's decision to ratify the treaty was difficult because of the im- mense popular support in India for its citizens initially hailed the May nuclear and Pakistan. While Vajpayee was quoted in the New York Times as praising \a new chapter in Indo- d.ition, India also had Indian woman cheer for nuclear testing. One area of tension is Kashmir, a strip ofland located on the north- west border between India and Pa- kistan. h i s as defense c~o~n~c~e=rn~s~ab~o~u~t~s~tg=n~tn~g~~P~ak~~~ta~n~iTco~o~p~e=ra~t~to=n~,'r.'m~an~·~y~6~o~s-~~~~~--~~~~ the treaty because of tensions with tilities between the two nations still the surrounding nations of China remain. since 1989. India has accused Pa- kistan of arming rebel factions in Kashmir, while Pakistan has ac- cused India of executing innocent Ka5hmiri people. Both Prime Min- isters agreed this week to resume talks over Kashmir this week, end- ing a yearlong freeze in diplomatic discussions. Pakistan hoped that by taking the lead and signing the CTBT some of the diplomatic hostilities between India and Pakistan, as well as the Southeast Asian anns race would subside. India'ssubsequent decision to ratify the tr~ty was hailed internationally. By signing the 1996 Comprehen- sive Test Bart Treaty, Pakistan and India willjoin 150 other nations from around the world that have ratified the treaty. UN Secretary General Kofi Annan was quoted in the New York Times as stating, \Ever since the nuclear tests in South Asia in May 1998, I have consistently urged India and Pakistan to sign [the treaty].\ Annan feltthat:b()th governments should be praised for \heeding the concern of the inter- national community.\ pi P« p, y j N m ~ H M d c vi tv in re n st a' h: p c p w \I tl m l\1 n1 tl tt tl n: p

Israel Update Progression in lsraeli- Pale:stinian Pea:ce Talks On Tuesday, Palestinian President ~:s!fB:;e~;:~~e~:\~:~~::~~i!s~ i Yasser Arafat accepted Israel's proposal by Danl<irscb Stli/.{Writer WASHiNGTON-The Middle Eastpeace prDcess, once thought to be in danger, ap- pears to be back on track when both Palestinan Liberation Organization Chairman Y11sser Arafat and IsraeliPtime Minister Ben- j ami n Netanyahu niet at the W h it e fl()use on Monday. Presi• d e n t Clinton in- vited the two leaders in ()rder to restart talks that were stalled over a year and a half. ago. President Clinton was pleased with the \progress\ that was made on Monday, buthe declared that there was \still m11ch work to be done.\ . The main thrust of co11troversy has been the percentage of land Israel must cede to the Palestinians to stay within agreement of the Oslo accords, the historic peace agree- ment signed by Arafa.t and the late Israeli Prime Minister Shimon P'eres. Israel has said \ \ l I theirnationalsecuritywouldbeseverelyat: to cede another 13o/o of the West Bank risk. .

The governing coalition in the Israeli govern- ment is still op- posed to a sover- eign Palestinian state, and Mr. N etanyahu has repeatedly wamedof\reper- cussions'1 if such an event occurs without the con- sent of the Israe- lis. Analysts worry about yet another Israeli-Arab war, more contentious than the last. Continued violence between Arabs and Israelis in the town ofHebron is evidence of continued tensions between the people of West Bank andlsrael. It would not be diffi- cult to mobilize one against the other. · The govemmenf s stated main opposition to Palestinian statehood is the existence in ; \ the PLO charter of a clause that calls for the destruction and annih.ilation of the State of Israel. While Arafat has said he will remove the clause for several years now, the clause still exists. Another recent development is the ru- mored appointment ·of hard .. line conserva- tive Ariel Sharon to the post of foreign min- . .istet. Netanyahu has been acting foreign min- ister since the departure of his sometimes rival David Gesher from the post and the governing coalition. Sharon is the general who spearheaded Israel's invasion ofLeba- non in the 1967 Arab· Israeli war, and the housing minister who initiated dozens of new Jewish settlements in traditionally Arab lands in the West Bank. · His appointment would represent an ex- tremely tougher stance in negotiations than have been taking place in recent months. Moreover, this morehardline stance is nota prospect that Washington or the interna- tional cqmmunity favors because of its prob- able implications of creating more distance in an already unstable relationship. Secretary of State Madeline Albright stressed the importance of coming to a speedy resolution before the accord expires on May fourth when she stated~ \There is a sense we are working against a general dead- line.

_..., \-T\ _.-, OP .t..D' Opini,ons Inferno at Olin: A First Person Perspective Afew suggestions for the Olin Center Architects by Lis Kidder Contributing Writer Pernaps, if l were in a better mood today, the fact that the Olin Center is approximately the tern- perature of the surface of the sun would not have bothered me; However, because I have to write a che~nistry lab Feport in my four seconds of spare time to- day, tile blistering heat of my chemistry class was not mak- ing me t:he happiest of people. Sitting in chemistry, on tlle second floor of the Olin build- ing, I thought about how nice it was to be in such a high-tech classroom. I gazed around at the various technological amenities: the compute'fs, the remote mouse, the hand-held light dimmer, and I thought about the millions of dollars that went into building the Olin Center. Then, I passed out, because the rooin had reached a temperature of 350 degree Celsius. The pro- tein in my brain denatured from heat stress and I became a puddle of organic material resembling an amoeln. So here's my question: In such a techno logically advanced build- ing, why in the name of the sun god Ra is it impossible to have climate control in our classraoms? Even the most primitive ruchitects can figure out that inhabitants of a building don't like to die of spon- taneous combustion. Ifyou're go- iBg to erect a building, and make the rooms rnside cinderblock jail cells without windows, make sure you can air condition it. Halfway through chemistry class today, the fire alarm went off, and we had to leave the building. The reason for this fire drill probably had something to do with the smoke, coming off of the occu- pants of the building, as they slowly caught fire. How are we supposed to learn in an environ- ment in which we are required to \Stop Drop and Roll\ every five UNION COLLEGE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDEN\T R>UND&t> ,,.., Date: Se?tember 24, 1998 To; I>ean Frederick Alfi:>rd Professor Suzanne Benack Jaznie Drown '99 Deborah Leit\ '99 Professor Therese McCarty Oean Christina Sorum John Vero •96 Prof'essor Anton Warde Belh Wier?.bieniec •99 From: Roger H.

Of course, as the year progresses further into fall, it's not reasonable to ask students to walk from their dorniS to Olin in bath- ing-suits. Perhaps we should all bring electric fans to class - a technologically equipped build- ing like Olin is guaranteed to have an adeqruate number of outlets. We cotlld just plug in our fans, and give the professor a bull-horn to lecture with, Maybe we shot:!Id all go back to our old classrooms, and use the Olin Center as a greenhouse, qr a giant laboratory for experi- ments on desert animals.

To say that Union does nothing to contribute to our ecosystem would a false statement, but the fact is that om student body needs to be much more more involved. Union, as any other college or University, tries to make itself a microcosim of the real world. In the real world, however, recycling is a mandatory practice, and litter- ing is illegal. And by the students disregard- ing the environment as someone else's problem, the message is sent loud and clear that Union students are not ready to deal with the real world. I am not saying that the key component in becoming an up- standing citizen is to recycle, but I am saying that avoiding the issue is a testimony to irresponsibility, selfishness, and not following society's framework; traits that are mandatory to surviving when you are on your own. Granted, there are recycling bins in every dorm and in most frater- nity and sorority houses, but are they actually being utilized? The answer is no. The truth is tllat the students need to realize how big a difference a tiny bit of effort could make. Sure, it's easier to throw your can.s and IJottles in with the trash in your ro()m, but hoReslty, how hard is it to separate the two? How hard is it to make two trips down that hallway instead of one? The Union campus must make a bigger deal of the environment. The administration might want to consider putting up more recycling bins thatare collected and emptied every few days. The administration should place recycling bins for office/computer paper on every floor in every donn and frat em ity/sorority house be- caMse more paper is thrown out than any ()ther recyclable material. The goal ofthis arcticle however is not only to give suggestions, but to raise the awareness of students. This institution is here for the students, and by caring a little more for the environment, whether it be for the amelioration of your futures and your children's futures or just because a clean environ- ment is h~althier, then you are demonstrating the benevolence, or selflessness necessary for succeed- ing as a person in society.

Jon Tapper's Weekly Comme~tary by Jon Tapper Staff Writer I have given a lot of thought to giving this column a drastic over- haul and new look sometime in the next few weeks. While this cohmm has been a success over the last year or so, in my humble opinion, my talents might be better suited if I at some point attach a purpose or a goal to each week's column. Maybe I just need to get a little bit more serious arid stop making fun of everyone and everything on campus. That is all well an.d good, but this is a small campus and I am running out of original mate- rial. With that said, keep your eyes open for something new in the near future out of this column. A few final thoughts on it over the last week. One Aryan Dutch- man showed his true colors when he parachuted into last weeks foot- ball game like a true Nazi para- trooper. Once again proving my theory of the racist Union mascot. And my other point about last weeks article is that I am going to be kind and overlook last weeks poor editing job of my column (you know who you are and I know who you are so watch your step in the near future). The Red Sox made the playoffs: Just as I had been saying all along. Hopefully, by the time this paper comes to press, they will be apply- ing the finishing touches to an opening round sweep of the Cleve- land Indians. And a quick note about the Yankees. They should learn from their cross-town coun- terparts the Mets and choke real early in the playoffs so I don't have to hear from their ignorant fans anymore this baseball season. I read in last week's paper that Mr. Rogers is writing for the pa- per. A couple of quick observa- timrs on this one. One, Mr. Rogers column sounded an awful lot like the junk that the old Jon Tapper used to write every week. Two, I think that instead of writ- ing every week, he should stick to playing with trains, puppets, feed- ing his fish, playing in the land of make believe and being everyone's neighbor. Mr. Rogers, you wouldn't want to bum your- self out by writing for this paper every week so stick to what you are good at. I am the only one who has a problem with Frank Rossi being the most vocal person on this cam- pus against Sophomore Rush. One, to my knowledge, he gradu- ated last year. Two, also to my knowledge, Mr. Rossi spent three years on this campus being the most anti-Greek member of the Union Community (and that in- cludes faculty). A wise person once told me that a leopard doesn't change its spots. So come on Frank, the gigs up, we'll overlook the fact that you only joined a house because it looked good on your resume if you stop trying to be the official Greek spokesman against Sophomore Rush.

It was my 20thbirthdaythispast Sunday. I must say it was strange to experience the actual numerical change from teenager to twenty- something. I suppose I didn't feel any different physically, or even mentally. I felt the change in my heart, somewhere deep in the pit of my stomach and it made me queasy. I haven't been myself this tenn. In fact, I haven't been myselfin a long time. I have been feeling a disjointed sense of adulthood that is strangely haunting to me .. I ·guess my recent emotional state has had a lot to do with my family. As the yeats of college have rolled along, I have found myself growing farther and farther away .from them. I don't think it is anything I have intended to do or anything they have chosen to do either. There just comes a point where your own life starts to taJ¥e shape and a phone call home is often the last priority on an end- less list. It is a sad thing for me to realize. It is not that I no longer value my family or that I love them any less, it is just that things have become much more immediate and everything I have to take care of starts piling up, overshadowing my attempts at keeping in touch. And it is with a regretful sense of heartache that I admit to these wrohgs. I have always underesti- mated the valueofmy family, not really in a lack of love for them, but rather in my appreciation for what they have given to me with- out question. When I was a senior by Michelle Tllalll Editor-in-Chief . in high school, l stopped eating dinner with my family on the weekends and it killed them. But I did it anyway, without remorse, with. only the feeling that I wanted to be at some pizza place with my friends and that dinner with my mom, dadandbroth~r wasn't such a big deal. I left for college, tom \'I have been. feeling a dis- jointed sense of adulthood that is·strangely haunting to me.\ that I had to leave my friends.. I left for college not; worrying about rny family because i \knew\ they would always be there .. They were family, they HAD to love me; af- ter all, I was their priority. Their world centered around me. Right? Wrong. There is a certain sense of family loyalty that none of us can deny or escape. However, that sense of loving and sacrifice is a gift, not a right.

' I i ·} l l lj · ·Features-·· · It was my 20th birthday this past Sunday. I must say it was strange to experience the actual numerical change from teenager to twenty- something. I suppose I didn't feel any different physically, or even meatally. I felt the change in my heart, somewhere deep in the pit of my stomach and it made me queasy. I haven't been myself this term. In fact, I haven't been myself in a long time. I have been feeling a disjointed sense of adulthood that is strangely haunting to me. I guess my recent emotional state has had a lot to do with my family. As the years of college have rolled along, I have found myself growing farther and farther away from them. I don'tthink it is anything I have intended to do or anything they have chosen to do either. There just comes a point where your own life starts to ta~e shape and a phone call home is often the last priority on an end- less list. It is a sad thing for me to realize. It is not that I no longer value my family or that I love them any less, it is just that things have become much more immediate and everything I have to take care of starts piling up, overshadowing my attempts at keeping in touch. And it is with a regretful sense of heartache that I admit to these wrongs. I have always underesti- mated the value of my family, not really in a lack of love for them, but rather in my appreciation for what they have given to me with- out question. When I was a senior by Michelle Tbam Editor-in-Citiej in high school, I stopped eating dinner with my family on the weekends and it killed them. But I did it anyway, without remorse, with only the feeling that I wanted to be at some pizza p'lace with my friends and that dinner with my mom, dad and brother wasn't such a big deal. I left for college, tom \I have been feeling a dis- ljointed sense of adulthood that is strangely haunting to me.'' that I had to leave my friends. I left for college not worrying about my family because I \knew\ they would always be there. They were family, they HAD to love me; af- ter all, I was their priority. Their world centered around me. Right? Wrong. There is a certain sense of family loyalty that none of us can deny or escape. However, that sense of loving and sacrifice is a gift, not a right. I never realized it I always thought it was this over- powering moral responsibility for my parentstoprovide forme, love me, appease me. But the truth is, in nature, animals rarely care for their young. It is that extra com- ponent of human sentiment that makes my parents drive three hours to cheer rne on my birthday with gifts and a day of shopping.

Page 14• October 1, 1998 • 0Iottr~Ubiensi!l5 Science &: Technology Science & Technology by Victoria Hargreaves Science and Teclmology Editor Morethan 1,350;000Americans will be diagnosed with cancer this year, accordjng to the Cancer Re- search Foundation of America, and over 550,000 people will die. Seventy percent of these. cases could have been prevented, the foundation reports. That is, ap- proximately 945,000 people could have led cancer-free lives without chemotherapy, without the linger- ing threat of death, without an es- timated number of months still to live. The following is a list of 12 ways that you can prevent cancer. 1. Don't smoke tigarettes, pipes, or cigars or chew tobacco. Thirty-five percent of all cancer cases can be prevented if the per- son does not smoke. Secondhand smoke can increase one's risk of developing lung cancer as well Johns Hopkins University recently released a report which states that \more than 40% of the thousands of chemical compounds present in tobacco smoke directly interact with DNA to cause cancer.\ 2. Eat more poultry and fisb and Jess red meat. Studies have demonstrated thatwomen.~who eat large quantities of red meat have 12 Ways to Pr~vent Canc,er higher chances of developing breast cancer and other cancers than women who eat lessredmeat While protein is an important part of one's diet, it should come from skinless poultry, lean pmk, beans, low fat dairy products, and fatty fish. \Eating. four three- to four- ounce servings of fatty fish such as sahnon, tuna, and rainbow trout per week can significantly reduce one's cllance of developing can- cer,\ said Ge()rge Blackburn, as~ sociate director of the nutrition division at the Harvard Medical School \The fatty acids found in these fish may fight cancer by slowing cell division,\ said Emma Segal, author of The Top 9 WC9's to Prevent Cancer. 3. E:xercise. Studieshaveshown that regular exercise can decreasy the chance of developing breast cancer in women by as much as 40%, and colon cancer, the tllird biggest cancer killer of women, by as much as 50%. The Journal ofthe American Medical Association recommends people exercise between 30 and 45 minutes each day. Researchers believe that regular exercise in women lessens the body's levels of estrogen (a hormone believed to cause breast tumors) in the blood. Exercise also makes the quickly whicblessensthe time car- cinogens {cancer-causing ele- ments) are in contact with the di- gestive tracts. 4. Eat fruits· and vegetables. The American Institute for Cancer Research reported earlier this year that consuming the vi't!lffiins and minerals that fruits and vegetables provide can lower ane's risk 'of developing cancer by as much as 40%. The institute also annoUllced that these effects are n()t the same when fruits and vegetables are re- placed with vitamin pills or nutri- tional supplements. The National Cancer Institute recommends people eat five to nine servings of fruits and veg- etables everyday. Fruits and veg- etables high in beta-carotene and alpha-carotene such as carrots, sweet potatoes, spinacb, kale, and cantaloupe help to prevent cancer as well as those high in sulforaphane such as broccoli, cau- liflower, and other members of the cabbage family. A study performed by Harvard's School ofPublic Health found that a diet rich in produce can lessen one's chance of developing can- cers of the tung, stomach, esopha- gus, and. larynx. 5. Eat more fiber. While body metabolize food more Americans,.onaverage,eatonly ll to 14 grams daily, doctors believe that between 25 and 3 5 grams can significantl·y aid in the fight against breast, rectal, and colon cancers. Foods high in fiber in- clude 100 percent bran cereals, oatmeal, kidney beans, 100 per- cent whole-grain andwhole-wheat breads, popcorn, pears with the skin, and pastas and breads that list grain or whole wheat as their frrst ingredient on the nutrition infor- mation label. \Dietary fiber ,is material from plant cells that hu.,. mans cannot digest or can only partially digest. It helps move food through the intestines and out of .the body, promoting a healthy di- gestive tract.\ 6. Watch your weight. lrt its \Nurses' Health Study\ at Harvard last year, researchers reported that women who gained more than 40 pounds sin.ce the age of 18 had a 40 percent increased risk of de- veloping breast cancer after meno- pause than women whogained five pounds or less. Obesity has been implicated as a cau~e ofendometrial, breast, co- lon, rectum, prostate, and kidney cancers. The r~searchers believe that fat produces estrogen and in- sulin which encourage tumor growth in women. Dr. Blackburn feels that steady weight gairt, even if it is a pound or two·a year, over . -------------------------------------- ....... \\\\'\:------------. an extende~ period of time in- Dorm Networking :~:~.:,~:.o.·.nskfofdev•l- by Daniel Kelhmano'Vith Staff Writer So you're connected to the internet through your computerin the dorm room. The resnet access is great because it allows you to surf the net and check your email, but what happens when you have a large file and wantto share it with your lab partner? If both comput- ers have a zip drive then its easy, but what happens when you only have a standard 1.44 MB floppy drive? Sure you can transfer the file overtheinternetusinganFTP, but there is a much easier way; if both computers are connected to the resnet network, then you can trans- fer the file using the IPX protocol. IPX works only on local networks and it provides many powerful networking features. The descriptions on IPX apply to IBM compatible computers even though a similar protocol is available for Apple computers. IPX allows users to share either a file, a folder, or even components like a printer over the local net- work.

Di- ets high in fat can increase the risk of cervical, breast, colon, prostate, rectum and other cancers by up to . 40%. Doctors suggest one snould lower one's fat intake to 20% of the total caloric intake. Dr. Blackburn agrees that while it is best to have 20% of the diet com- ing from fat, this is often very dif- ficult to do and some reduction is better than none. The Harvard School of Public Health suggests that when fat is necessary for cooking, one should use monounsaturated fats such as ol- ive oil or canota oil which may, in fact, reduce one's risk ofdevelop- ing cancer. The Cancer Research Founda- tion of America suggests that fat intake should be equally com- posed of saturated, unsaturated (com oil and safflower oils), and monounsaturated fats. 8. Eat soy products. Asian women have significantly less · numbers of cases of breast cancer than Asian-American women. Doctors believe this is because Asian women eat a lot of soy which contains genistein, which is .. thought to hinder the development of tumors. both of which are believed to inu crease one's chances of develop- ing cancer. 10. Protect your skin. While skin cancer is the most common· of all cancers, dermatologists and researchers believe that as many as 90% of skin cancer cases could have been prevented. Wearing a sun block with an SPF of at least 15, staying out ofthesun as much as possible, and monthly self ex- amin,ations for new moles and pre- existing but changing moles can cut one's chance of developing skin cancer by as much as 10%. Dermatologists recommend that people with fair skin and lighthair, who bum easily or have been burned badly as a child~ and have a family history of skin cancer see ' a doctor to get checked twice a year. Dr. Algin B. Garret, director of dermatologic surgery at the Medical College of Virginia Hos- pitals, believes that parents should protect their 'children's skin as early as possible because nearly all cases of skin cancer have been caused by a long period of expo~ sure to the sun. 11. ExarnJri~ yourself and get tested .. :toF..can~er. The National Cancer~Institute has reported tqat one out of every 9 women wili develop breast cancer before she turns s·s. One out of thirty worn~ ; will dit{ofbreast cancer. Early detection is one of the best ways to prevent breast cancer as well as all other forms of cancer. A woman should conduct a self breast exam every month two to three days after her period, have regular gynecological checkups, and annual mammograms after the age of40. . Women should have pelvic ex- ams and pap smears after the age of 16 to determine cervical health. Both men and women over the age of 50 should have digital rectaL exams, fecal occult-blood tests, and sigmoidoscopy to determine colon health as recommended by one's doctor. Doctors will perform chest 1 X-rays to determine one's lung health if cancerous symptoms arise. After the age of 50, men should have a blood test to determine the presence of prostate specific anti- gen which indicates the health of the prostate. 12. Drink alcohol in modera- tion. Alcohol is believed to be re- sponsible for approximately 3%of deaths due to cancer. Alcohol may increase one's risk for cancers of the oral cavity, pharynx, esopha- gus; larynx, liver, and breast. Doc- tors recommend men have two drinks daily and women have one.

-· ·~t Ladies and Gentlemen, Boys a.nd Girls of All Ages, and Zelda, a Link to My Past by Deric Harrington Contributing Writer Without wasting much of your time (which I already did by includ- ing that beginning part, not to mention this), let's jump right into the mailbag. Oh, I see, there is no mail. Well then, let's close up the old mailbag for now. My e-mail name is SlapyMcGee@aol.com, send something my way. I went to see Korn this past week with a couple friends. Con- cert going is my release, it's my chance to be who I am, without being judged by anyone else. So, we venturedoutto Worcester, MA to see the Family Values tour. There were five bands on the tour: Orgy, Limp Bizcut, Ice Cube, Rammstein, and headliner, Kom. About Kprn and. Limp Bizcut, well, 1' d like to take some old advice, about if Fm not able to say any- thing nice about something, don't say it at all. How- ever, I did gain a new respect for Ice Cube, as he held his own at es• sentially a rock show. The only thing about this was that there was really nothing. to look at, just two people on a otherwise overly empty stage. Rammstein were on next and their perfonnance just blewmeaway. To those of you not familiar with the band; let me describe them. Imagine heavy metal and techno had a basta.td child that only· knows Genrian; The lead singer startedoffthe:show on fire. That's no typo, he was ON FIRE. Literal meaning here;'rm not talking about like tb~y were so good they were on fire, I mea.Jl his jacket was going crackle crackle pop pop. They had a awesome pyro show to go along with some amazing songs, includ- ing their hit Du Hast. When they left the .stage, there was a huge push to get onto the floor. One only had to look around to realize what type of crowd this was. The crowd was filled with people who have been ostracized for their personal opin- ions, and because of this, an im- mense anger and hatred towards the world was felt in the building. These people had the personality of rusty barbed wire, just waiting to wrap up their next victim. Next time you feel pissed at the world, go to a concert, jump into the pit, and start swinging. Who knows, with all that violence you could be the next Sandy Rodrigues! Fi- nally, Kom came on stage, and the place erupted with jumping, pushing, moshing, crowd surfing. Kom shredded through an hour long set of great songs, includ- ing Addidas, Children ofthe Korn (with Ice Cube), and many others that escape me at the moment. The encore consisted of every band that had played the entire evening coming. on stage for a perfomiance of the song \All in the Family\. A perfect end to a overall tremendous evening. I highly suggest this show to any- one that has a interest in any of the bands that I've mentioned, and even to those that just w~t a fun, interesting night Oh great, what I thought was the article in which I finally stick to the A&E theme ofthis page, is falling apart. How, you ask? I'll tell you. You see, the past four sentences have had absolutely nothing to do with A&E, and even less to do with anything at all. I'd love to be able to say that I saw this great piece of theater last week, but I didn't. I didn't even ge watch a show. I do know that the Pen dragons are going to Proctor's Theater soon. For anyone that doesn't know who they are (show ofhands please). You, rna' am, you in the hack, you're familiar with them? Then maybe you think you 'r() good enough to explain to every- one else? No? (That's what 1 thought.) They're a magician hus- band and wife duo, who are re- garded as having one of the top magic shows in the werld. I'd go into what you'd see there, but isn't that halfthe part of magic; to go there and be shocked and surprised at what you see? I mean, it would . suck to go to a magic show, and know what illusions you will see. This kind of fal-ls under the same category as wrestling did a few weeks ago. If you're the type of person that has to know how things happen, so you can say \I know how they did that,\ do me a favor. and don'tgo, but ifyou're the type of person that's always been fas- cinated by magic, then go, you will not see better than them. On a personal note, I'm look· ing for somewhere to watch wres- tling Pay-Per Views. If anyone knows where some- one watches them, or if you're someone who orders them, send me a E-mail. I'll be glad to help pay for the event. Of note coming up in the wrestling world is ECW's nextPPY, November to Remember. It takes place November 1, with no matches having been an- nounced as of yet.

He spoke to Union'.s faculty, staff, and students Tuesday evening, September 22, in theN ott Merno- rial. .Mallon is most known on this campus as the author of Henry and Clara, this year's r~quired in this photograph.

Gtoucodrieueil'li • October 1, 1998 • Page 17 a a ret Revival of the 1966 Musical by Spen~er S. Christie Cqntributing Writer Cabaret, the landmark l966mu- sicalthat shattered all ideas about the modem musical, is something extraordinary. The show has been revised nu- merous times over the course of its history, including a 1972 film · version featuring Liza Minnelli. Each of the major revivals have · played around with the shows songs and have tinkered with the _plot. The current revival is darker, seedier, and more cynical than all · <Jf the major revivals of Cabaret seen in the past The show could also boast that it has the most tal- ented cast performing right now. All of the actors, except the four leads, also play a musical instru- ment in the show. What the cur- rent revival has that has been miss- ing from all of the other produc- tions is a completely new look at the staging and characterization of the show. On September 13, a friend and I decided to check out the buzz for ourselves atThe Kit Kat Klub, the show is now in the process of mov- ing to the now defunct Studio 54. , We had to show up at8:00AM to . get standing room tickets to the sh·ow .. as it is sold out - until in a dirty vaudevillian way. However, the main reason for seeing the show was the cast. The 1998 Tonywimer,Alan Cumming, who unfortunately has taken a ten week vacation to be in the new film adaptation of Titus Andronk:us, isunbelievable as the Emcee. His raunchy movements and singing voice add new dimension to the old Joel Gray-ish idea ofthe Emcee, artd completely change the show's feel. He is so unbeliev- able that you can never see the movie, Romy anrl Michelle's High School Reunio11, in which he plays a nerd, in the same light or in the same way again. Jennifer Jason Leigh, who has taken over for Natasha Richardscn, who also won a Tony for her performance, was wonder- fully awful in her .interpretation of the title song. Her characteriza- tion is very believable, and the stage is blessed. to have her back. Ron Rifkin, whoagain won a Tony for his perfoJ11lance, is amazing as Herr Schultz. Blair Brown, who has taken over for the Tony-nominated performance of Mary Louise Wil- son, does not have the overpow- ering voice that Mrs. Wilson has, but her character was very touch- ing .. -~----------- ......... ---~--~--- ......... --------------~------t ~10;00AM .. So, we did have to wait Itwou1dbe wr.Qng of me not to mention: the performance of Michele Pawk. As a Kit Kat girl, Fraulein Kost, andas a member of the band, Ms.Pawk' s perfonnance on the stage was energetic and heart crushing. r~ading for freshman orientation. Mallon's topic of disc,l!ssion was the role photographs play in writing historical fiction. He gave some examples, showing a few slides. The first was ofPresiQent K~nnedy'.s. limousine on the day on which he was assassinated. This particuJat picture, · taken from in front of the car, was taken at the precise instant Kennedy was shot the frrst time. The fatal shot bad not hit him. yet the split second view ofthe pic- ture, which has an almost serene quality to it. The assassination in November of 1963 took place when Mallc;nl was young, hut he talked about how it was kind of .his. inspiration for writing b.istori- cal fiction •. What interested hun the mosiwas th.e story ,that~~uld be told from the perspective of some- one not directly involved. For example, . in the picture you can see Jackie Kennedy's Se- Abraham Lincoln, but only as an event in the lives of the main char- acters. Mallon ccncluded his lecture by talking about history versus his· torical fiction. He said that there are two circumstances that call for historical fiction: when facts are lost to time, and when time is lost to facts. He said, \we are ... becom- ing a little.sick of one another.\ He believes we need to look back- wards in time to escape. for a couple of hours, but when the show started at 3:00PM it was all worth it. What we witnessed on stage was the spectacular imagination of Sam Mendes' and Rob Marshall's new staging of the show. Not since Harold Prince's original stag- ing has anyone dared to rethink the show entirely.

Arts & Entettain:ment Thomas Mallon Visiting Author Speaks to Union Community by Holly Burnside Contributing Writer Thomas Mallon has written fol:lf novels, four works of nonfiction, has been Literary Editor of Gentleman's Quarterly magazine, and a Professor of English. He spoke to Union's faculty, staff, and students Tuesday evening, September 22, in the Nott Memo- rial. Mallon is most known on this campus as the author of Henry and Clara, this year's required n~ading for freshman orientation. Mallon's topic of discussion was the role photographs play in writing historical fiction. He gave some examples, showing a few slides. The first was of President Kennedy's limousine on the day on which he was assassinated. This particular picture, taken from in front of the car, was taken at the precise instant Kennedy was shot the first time. The fatal shot had not hit him yet in this photograph. You can see his hand up to his neck and Jackie Kennedy's white glove as she reaches out to help him. Spec- tators trying to get a glimpse of the President and 1-\irst Lady sur- roUild the car on aU sides, with- out realizing what has exactly happened and what is about to happen. MaHon contrasted this picture with the famous 2apruder film that shows the shot that actually lead to the death of the President. The gory details are left out of the split second view of the pic- ture, which has an almost serene quality to it. The assassination in November of 1963 took place when Mallon was young, but he talked about how it was kind of his inspiration for writing histori- cal fiction. What interested him the most was the story that could be told from the perspective of some- one not directly involved. For example, in the pictme you can see Jackie Kennedy's Se- cret Service Agent walking along- side the limousine. Had that Se- cret Service Agent realized what was happening at the instant the pictu.re was taken, the President might not have sHffered the fatal wound. Another example he gave was the men who worked on the fifth floor of the bookdepository buHd- ing, one floor under Lee Harvey Oswald, and heard the shells drop at the time of the assassination. Hence, an importantpartof Henry and Clara is the assassination of Abraham Lincoln, but only as an event in the lives of the main char- acters. Mallon concluded his lecture by talking about history versus his- torical fiction. He said that there are two circumstances that call for historical fiction: when facts are lost to time, and when time is lost to facts. He said, \we are ... becom- ing a little sick of one another.\ He believes we need to look back- wards in time to escape. C!Iom:orbiensis • October 1, 1998 • Page 17 a aret Revival of the 1966 Musical by SpencerS. Cbristie Contributing Writer Cabaret, the l<mdmark 1966 mu- sical that shattered all ideas about the modem musical, is something extraordinary. The show has been revised nu- merous times over the course of its history, including a 1972 .film version featuring Liza Minnelli. Each of the major revivals have played around with the shows songs and have tinkered with the plot. The current revival is darker, seedier, and more cynical than all of the major revivals of Cabaret seen in the past. The show could also boast that it has the most tal- ented cast perfom1ing right now. All of the actors, except the four leads, also play a musical instru- ment in the show. What the cur- rent revival has that has been miss- ing from all of the other produc- tions is a completely new look at the staging and characterization of the show. On September 13, a friend and I decided to check out the buzz for ourselves at The Kit Kat Klub, the show is now in the process of mov- ing to the now defunct Studio 54. We had to show up at 8:00AM to get standing room tickets to the show - as it is sold out - until 1 O:OOAM. So, we did have to wait for a couple of hours, but when the show started at 3:00PM it was all worth it. What we witnessed on stage was the spectacular imagination of Sam Mendes' and Rob Marshall's new staging of the show. Not since Harold Prince's original stag- ing has anyone dared to rethink the show entirely. The dancing was not that of A Chorus Line or the Lion King, instead it capital- ized on the emotions of the show in a dirty vaudevillian way. However, the main reason for seeing the show was the cast. The 1998 Tony winner, Alan Cumming, who unfortunately has taken a ten week vacation to be in the new film adaptation of Titus Andronicus, is unbeiievable as the Emcee. His raunchy movements and singing voice add new dimension to the old Joel Gray-ish ideaofthe Emcee, and completely change the show's feel. He is so unbeliev- able that you can never see the movie, Romyand Michelle's High School Reunion, in which he plays a nerd, in the same light or in the same way again. Jennifer Jason Leigh, who has taken over for Natasha Richardson, who also won a Tony for her performance, was wonder- fully awful in her interpretation of the title song. Her characteriza- tion is very believable, and the stage is blessed to have her back. Ron Rifkin, who again won a Tony for his performance, is amazing as Herr Schultz. Blair Brown, who has taken over for the Tony-nominated performance ofMary Louise Wil- son, does not have the overpow- ering voice that Mrs. Wilson has, but her character was very touch- ing. It would be wrong of me not to mention the performance of Michele Pawk. As a Kit Kat girl, Fraulein Kost, and as a member of the band, Ms.Pawk'sperfonnance on the stage was energetic and heart crushing. The quality ofthe show is ex- cellent; the current revival is the best show of the year, and is defi- nitely worth spending the day seeing. It will be interesting to see how Union College will interpret the show, as Cabaret is slated to be the Spring tem1' s department show.

The team hadtwogames, one on Saturday against Vassar Col-. lege and then one on Mon- day, when they traveled to Utica College. Due to strong play and performance, the Uniort team was able to gain two more. victories, extending their sea- son record to 5-1. In front of many Union parents and friends, Saturday's Home- change ..

One Up, One Down for Men's Soccer by Rory Stern Sports Writer The men's soccer team split two games this past week, maintaining their record of .500. The victory came before a Homecoming crowd on Garris Field this past Saturday against Vassar. Union came out strong against Vassar and played a very tightly matched game. Dan Danb11sky started in goal for the Dutchmen, once again. Danbusky continued his strong play in goal, but was not challenged as often as he bas been in other games. Vassar man- aged seven sh()tS on goal, and could not put one past the keeper. Union won the game, 1-0, off a well executed pass from Ibrahim Adamu, to Sophomore standout Aaron Sabin. Sabin continued with his aggressi-ve style play, and his efforts paid off. Sabin worked the field well, and hustled at every moment the baH was in his zone. The team played well as a whole, but appeared to be lacking a go-to guy. The opportunities were present for the Dutchmen to score, but they stiU remain in searchofafmisher. Union'scom- bined effort saw a solid defense push the ball into the offensive zone, and set up ()fie opportunity after the next. The only problem seemed to be the little fundamen- tal errors that kept Uni@n :from tting more goals up c:ln the . After a drive to- ds the net, would be a misplaced pass or sorn e other miscue that spoiled the drive. The team moves the ball ness to set up the field. Vassar Aaron Braunstein/TC played well, and Craig Ellman battles for the ball against Vassar College only out- matched the ----------------------------- ...... Dutchmen by more talk on the field. There were many instances that Union 'crowded a zone of the field, and missed plays due to their Jack of talking. Union's loss this week came against a very tough Williams team. This match-up seems to be an even contest, that Union looks forward to every season. This match was no different, and even mme intense than most meetings. The game was played with strong emotion and great heart. The in- tensity of this game was well wrapped up by a tight score, 1-0. \We had them panicking in the last fifteen minutes of the garne,\ com- mented Adamu. Adamu stated that this game was the most intense game he had been a part of for quite some time. The style of play in this game matched the effort put forth during Union's tournament victory just three weeks ago. The team played as one, and everyone had an impact. Time in goal was split by both Danbusky and sophomore Peter Koch. The keepers played well in this tight match, facing a combined four shots. Williams put the only tally on the board 20 minutes into the game, and Union could only counter with one shot on goal.

i' ,; I· '. ' '• ! ,, Page 2~ • Qct()ber 1, 1998 • Clrmunrmettsis. Sp.orts. - Don't- Close the :B-ooks- Ju-st Yet by David Weiner Spot;ts Editor Well-known sports journalist, Peter Gammons, said it best 1ast weekend when he stated, \This may be the most m-emorable sea- son ever in professional baseball history.\ Anyone who has picked up a newspaper at any point be- tween last April md today can- not help but see wllat Gammons· is :talking about. •From th~ divi- sion races in both the National and American Leagues to the nu- merous individual records being chased and broken,. it is Clear that the histQry made dwing this 1998 season is unprecedented in any other year ofMajor League Base- ball. ·· To list everything that hap- pened this season presents a nearly impossiblt1 task. The Jist would be never e11ding, but just look at a few ofthe more memo- rable aspects. First and foremost, the home run race between Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa. Ev- eryday on ESPN's Sportscenter there was a \Chasing History Segment\ that scon became \Making History\ as both McGwire and Sosa not only reached Roger Maris' 37 year old record of62 home runs in a sea- son, but surpassed it at high speed. ESPN set up special cov- erage so that each individual at- bat on the road from 58-62 home runs and 'beyond fo_r both McGwire and Sosa were shown live, thus allowing everyone na- tion-wide fo witness history. McGwire opened the season with four home runs in his first four games and finishe-d the season with four home runs in his final two games, bringinghishomerun total to 70and giving him the dis- tinguished honor of HomeRun King. Sosa wasnotfarbehind, fin- ishing with 66, hut those 66 home runs helped his team reach the .play- offs, a .pressure that McGwire never had to face. Needless to say, these two marks, above and beyond, dis- tinguished the 1998 season. Continuing however, Cal Ripken, with only eight games remaining in the regular season, ended his \Iron Man\ streak of2,632 straight games on the Baltimore Orioles fmalhome game of the season. For sixteen straight years, Ripken never missed a game. Can you imagine never missing a day of work in 16 years'? That is one rnark, as many thought Maris' 62 home runs was, that truly NEVER will be broken. Roger Clemens, the one time ace ofthe Boston Red Sox and current ace of the Toronto Blue Jays, be- gan his season 0-4. However, he then went 20-2 for the rest of the sea- son, posting a string of16 straight wins in AugUst and September, thus nearly assuring him of his· record fifth Cy Young Award. In the race for the American League Most Valuable Player, both Nomar Garciaparra for the Boston Red Sox andJuan Gonzalez of the Texas Rangers deserve to win the award. Without these two players, their respective teams could not have reached the playoffs. Garciaparra was the AL rookie ofthe year last season, and with his 37 home tuns and 120 runs batted in to go along with his .320 bat- ting average, is in contention to win both the rookie of the year and MVP awards i:it his firsf1w6-- seasons as a Major Leaguer. In the National League division race, simply to reach the playoffs, it came down to the final day of the season before the Cubs and Giants were forced to play an extra game to decide who respectively, that have reached the post-season, and aU eight have a legitimate shot at winning the WQfld title. To earn this pres-· tigious title,_ a team must win 11 out of 17 'games. That is a win- ningpercenmge of.647. Both the Y anke~andBraves had winning percentages of over . 700 and the other six teams were near or above- .600. All eight teams are legitimate contenders.~ Going back in history, two teams that have provided some of the most spectacular playoff series ever, and come from cities with the mostcritical and die-hard fans around are the Red Sox and Y an~ees. What would it'be like, if, in :a seas()n where Ripken ended his streak, McGwire and Sosa broke the home run record, and tlte Yankees andRed Sox met ,in the American League Champi· onship Series to decide who goes to the World Series? And, would see post-season play. lite in a year ofrecords, wouldn't it New York Meis made it a three be wonderfulto see the Red Sox way racebefore.sta:llingat the fm- win thee World Series 80 years af- ish line, but that ra()e kept people ter creating the \Curse of the reeling each night after their re- Bambino\'bytradingBabeRuth spective teams won or lost. to the Yankees.

Page 22 • October 1, 1998 • <lrntttnrm~usis Sports Don't Close the Books Just Yet by David Weiner Sprnts Editor Well-known sports journalist, Peter Gammons, said it best last weekend when he stated, 'This maybe the most memorable sea- son ever in professional baseball history.\ Anyone who has picked up a aewspaper at any point be- tween last April and today can- not help but see what Gammons is talking about. From the divi- sion races in both the NatioAal and American Leagues to the nu- merous individual records being chased and broken, it is clear that the history made during this 1998 season is unprecedented in any other year ofMajor League Base- bali. To list everything that hap- pened this season presents a nearly impossible task. The list would be never ending, but just look at a few ofthe more memo- rable aspects. First and foremost, the home run race between Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa. Ev- eryday on ESPN's Sportscenter there was a \Chasing History Segment\ that soon became \Making History\ as both McGwire and Sosa not only reached Roger Maris' 37 year old record of 62 home runs in a sea- son, but surpassed it at high speed. ESPN set up special cov- erage so that each individual at- bat on the road from 58-62 home runs and beyond for both McGwire and Sosa were shown live, thus allowing everyone na- tion-wide to witness history. McGwire opened the season with four home runs in his first four games and finished the season with four home runs in his final two games, bringing his home run total to 70 and giving him the dis- tinguished honor of HomeRun King. Sosa was not far behind, fin- ishing with 66, but those 66 home runs helped his team reach the play- offs, a pressure that McGwire never had to face. Needless to say, these two marks, above and beyond, dis- tinguished the 1998 season. Continuing however, Cal Ripken, with only eight games remaining in the regular season, ended his \Iron Man\ streak of2,632 straight games on the Baltimore Orioles final home game of the season. For sixteen straight years, Ripken never missed a game. Can you imagine never missing a day of work in 16 years? That is one mark, as many thought Maris' 62 home runs was, that truly NEVER will be broken. Roger Clemens, the one time ace of the Boston Red Sox and current ace of the Toronto Blue Jays, be- gan his season 0-4. However, he then went 20-2 for the rest of the sea- son, posting a string of 16 straight wins in August and September, thus nearly assurihg him of his record fifth Cy Young Award. In the race for the American League Most Valuable Player, both Nomar Garc iaparra for the Boston Red Sox and Juam Gonzalez of the Texas Rangers deserve to win the award. WithoNt these two players, their respective teams could not have reached the playoffs. Ga:rciaparra was the AL rookie of the year last season, and with his 37 home runs and 120 runs batted in to go along with his .320 bat- ting average, is in contention to win both the rookie of the year and MVP awards in his first two seasons as a Major Leaguer. In the National League division race, simply to reach the playoffs, it came down to the final day of the season before the Cubs and Giants were forced to play an extra game to decide who would see post-season play. The New York Mets made it a three way race before stalling at the fm- ish line, but that race kept people reeling each night after their re- spective teams won or lost. Do you want to know what the best part of all this excitement is? The season isn't over yet. All that stuff happened during the regular season. The playoffs and the race to be World Series Cham- pion are just now getting excit- ing. Have you ever heard of\Mr. October\ Reggie Jackson? Well, it was in the playoffs and World Series, the most exciting part of the season, when Jackson earned himselfthat name. While both the New York Yan- kees and Atlanta Braves have compiled impressive records, there are eight teams, four in the American and National Leagues respectively, that have reached the post-season, and aU eight have a legitimate shot at winning the World title. To earn this pres- tigious title, a team must win II out of 17 games. That is a win- ning percentage of .64 7. Both the Yankees and Braves had winning percentages of over . 700 and the other six teams were near or above .600. Al:l eight teams are legitimate contenders. Going back in history, two teams that have provided some of the most spectacular playoff series ever, and come from cities with the most critical and die-hard fans around are the Red Sox and Yankees. What would itbe like, if, in a season where Ripken ended his streak, McGwire and Sosa broke the home run record, and theY ankees and Red Sox met in the American League Champi- onship Series to decide who goes to the World Series? And, in a year ofrecords, wouldn't it be wonderful to see the Red Sox win the World Series 80 years af- ter creating the \Curse of the Bambino\ by trading Babe Ruth to the YaRkees. My grandfather has never seen the Red Sox do that, but who knows? This could be the year. . Ever since the strike in 1994, Major League baseball has been headed downhill, losing popular- ity every year. I even wrote an article for the Concordiensis last year entitled, \America's Pastime is Past its Prime.\ However, with all that has happened this sea- son, the love for baseball has seemingly been revived. As Peter Gammons said, this truly has been the most spec- tacular season of Major League baseball ever. The best part is, the season isn't over quite yet. Women's Tennis Demolish Hartwick, 8-1 by A11netteGrajny Staff Writer This past weekend the women's varsity tennis team con- tinued their successful winning streak by handily defeating Hartwick College, 8-1. Assistant coach Greg Roman believed that the match was a good experience because \They challenged us to play our best. I'm proud of the girls for not getting frustrated and by staying patient through- out their matches.\ Senior co- captain Jen DeLucca agreed with Roman. \Everyone stayed very focused and really concentrated throughout the match. We couldn't afford to give up any easy points,\ said DeLucca. The match was especially chal- lenging because the number one singles player, Cassie Lawton first doubles was absent for the match because she was selected to play in the Rolex Division II I tournament, which took place at William Smith Col- lege this past week- end. Lawton had an easy first round win, 6-0, 6-1. Her second round was a tough three-setter, but Lawton prevailed. She lost in the quarterfinals to Hamilton, another close three-set match. <--~-- The match got off · to a good start be- cause once again, Union managed to win all three doubles Cassie Lawton warms up before her match. were LizAgar and Annette Grajny, who won a close, deuce-filled match, 8-6. The second doubles team of DeLucca, paired with A b b y Jeffords, won easily, 8-2. The third d0ubles team, Becky Rubin • and Susan · Y oo, also won quickly with 11Ie same score, 8-2. 11e singles pEayers were and consistent, helping Union to secure the victory. Playing first singles was DeLucca, who won in straight sets, 6-1, 6-4. Sopho- more Rubin played extremely well to defeat her opponent 6-3, 6-1. Grajny played third singles and won with the same score, 6-3, 6-1. Also winning in straight sets was freshman Yoo, 6-0, 6-1. Agar, playing fourth singles, won a close three-set match, 3-6, 6-1, 6- 4. The final score of the match was 8 (Union) to I (Hartwick). Head Coach Bill Scanlon is very pleased with the team's effort this season. \We just have to keep our momentum strong for these last few weeks. It is crucial that we go into Wednesday's match with a lot of confidence, because Skidmore is much stronger than any of the teams we have encoun- tered thus far,\ he said. The Union Women's team is now undefeated inallmatchplay. This week they will play a very strong Skidmore team on Wednesday, which prom- ises to be a close match. After that, this Saturday they will travel to Oneonta. WRITE SPORTS! Come to the meeting tonight, at 6:30 in room 303 in the Col- lege Center

Alpha Epsilon Pi Wins Brown Cup by Sarah Harsh Contributing Writer Each year the fraternities of Union's campus compete for a very special distinction. The Brown Cup is awarded to the fraternity which demonstrates the highest proficiency in academic achieve- ment, community service and cam- pus involvement. Past winners in- clude Kappa Sigma,· Phi Delta Theta and FIJI. However, this year the honor was bestowed upon the Union chapter of Alpha Epsilon Pi. The Brown Cup was originally started as a sort of memorial for Union alumni Steven P. Brown. Mr. Brown attended Union during the sixties and was an active member in his fraternity. The cup was in- tended to be a means by which fra- ternities could be recognized for their efforts towards bettering cam- pus life, as well as enriching their own chapter.

Mitchell said. faculty and administration had such alar e roblem with the lack of scholarship in a fraternity, the best way to resolve it would be di- rect communication and interaction between the two groups (faculty/ administration and the chapter in question). Steinmetz offered sug- gestions on standards Union or any college could set. these in- cluded regulations a college could create to make certain fraternity men did not fall behind in academ- ics. For example, Steinmetz pro- posed supervision by the admin- istration of all fraternities' grades, and suspension for any chapter that dropped below the average of the entire college for successive terms. He also suggested individual chapters adopt standards whereby only students not behind in their studies would be eligible for mem- bership. He carried this to extend to include current members, who, if they were behind in studies, could not hold any officer position. The chapter, he recommended, should suspend members (broth- ers or pledges) who achieved be- low a certain level for grades, until their grades improved. He believed such a suspension should come only as a last resort, after all other efforts to help the individual failed, and that it should be accompanied by whatever assistance necessary to help them improve their grades, from fellow members and faculty. Ste~etz based these ideas on similar ones instituted by the Col- Iege to deal with decreasing aca- demics among Union's athletes of the time. According to Steinmetz, the great improvements in schol- arship made by the members of ath- letic teams could similarly benefit fraternity members, and thus the College as a whole. This kind of response was typi- cal of Steirunetz, a direct solution to the problem. The solution he offered would involve a great amount of effort and interaction on the parts of everyone involved. But Steinmetz believed that kind of interaction and interest in the students' lives was one of the most vital components of teach- ing. He felt that applied to teaching anyone, from a child to an adult, and should always be a goal of a teacher, especially those at the col- lege level. Where have you gone, · Charles Steinmetz? Sorum opened tbe talk by sup- porting the idea that President/In- tern and Profes.soJ(Student rela- tionships are wrong, but for com- pletely different reasons.

AIDSWALK Success Wells House Participates in First Service Project oj'the Term by Jean Soutar Contributing Writer Wells House, the community in- volvement theme house, pruiici- pated in the AIDSW ALK; in Wash- ington Square Park on September 27. It was Wells House's ftrst com- munity involvement activity for fall tenn and, according to the walk- ers, it turned out to be a rewarding and fulfilling experience. The Newman Club, the Catholic Cam- pus Ministry Club on campus, also had participating walkers. The AIDSW ALK, was a two and a half mile walk that took place in the scenic Washington Square Park in Albany. The money raised for the event benefitted The Damien Center in Schenectady The Damien Center is a refuge for AIDS victims and their families to gather and support one another. Community involvement organiza- tions have the opportunity to host dinners, usually every Saturday night, for the families. These events usually include buying, preparing and serving din- ner to the many. families that come to The Damien Center for fun and relaxation. The Damien Center pro- vides a comfortable atmosphere in which people can escape from the pains of the every day world. There were about one hundred and fifty walkers that participated in the AIDSW ALK. Most of the walkers came from various high schools and colleges around the Capitol Region. The Damien Center organizers tried to reach out to the youth of the community in order to spread an important message of the impor- tance of AIDS education and pre- vention in today's society. They were estatic that a strong contigency of young adults showed their support for such a prominent issue fac'ing everyone today. The Damien Center had a goal of one hundred dollars raised for each walker, but the walkers soon found that it was easier said than done. The difficulty faced when at~ \Many relatives recounted stories of loved ones that became the vicitm of AIDS an·d how . they are .coping with their losses.\ tempting to raise money is unfor- tunately all too real for this cause. Members from Wells House helped to recruit walkers and reg- istered them before Sunday morn- ing. There was a booth in the Col- lege Center two weeks before the walk to inform the college commu- nity about the event, to sign up walkers and to accept donations for The Damien Center. The AIDS WALK began at I PM on Sunday afternoon after ,a tWo hour registration period. The Damien Center sponsered several - guest speakers that presented speeches mainly on the topic of AIDS education for the youth of the community. The guest speaker presenta- tions were followed bymusic and dancing to lighten the mood and . loosen th.e muscles before the ac- tual walk took place. The walkers' only complaint was about the hot and muggy weather that made the walk a little bit-chal- lenging to endure. The weather caused many to have a difficult time because the intense heat caused dehydration. However, at the end ofthe route, The Damien Center had Piiza Hut pizza and lots of cold drinks for the walkers to enjoy. The V\lalkerswere then able to relax in the park and interact with the other walkers that participated. There was a section ofthe park ·dedicated to showing some ofthe AIDS quilts thatrelativesrnade for their lost loved ones. Many ofthe panels were beautifully decorated as a memorial piece for those who have passed on from the disease. In addition, participants could browse around the inside of the park to visit some of the many booths that came to show their support for the walk.The AIDSW ALK had an emotional closing when walkers were al'lowed to go up in front of the cr:owd and te II their own personal reasons why · they were participating in thewalk. Many relatives recounted stories of loved ones that become the vicitrns of AIDS and how they are coping with their losses. These emotional stories reminded all that . this disease does in fact kill and · there is no cure as of yet. It was important to r,emember those that have suffered though the horrible disease, A IDS, and it helped the walkers to recall the real reason for AIDS education and pre- vention.

Savage later went on to have a distinguished law career and be- come Chief Justice ofthe New York State Supreme Court. Unfortu- nately, the eventcannottakeplace because not enough people ex- pressed interest The group planned to set out on their trip early Saturday morning. A College van would have brought the group to Salem, which is lo- cated on the other side of the Hudson River. The group, which hoped to hike approximately 25 miles a day, would have begun their return to the cam- pus almost immediately. They would have encountered a hilly por- tion of terrain during the first day and continued on to cross the Hudson River as well. The hikers planned to stop to rest and camp for the night at Saratoga Sod, the sod farm from which the recently transplanted sod in front of the Olin Building and the library originated. At Saratoga Sod, the group would have been met by a Union College Dining Services van carrying dinner and breakfast food . as well as camping supplies for the evening. The group was scheduled to rise early again on Sunday, ready to hike the 25 miles back to the Union cam- pus. On this portion of the trip, the group would have encountered flat- ter land and main roads. Eventu- ally, th,ey would follow Route 146 Staff Member Dies Robert M.

The hikers planned to pick up the bike path on the other side of the bridge for the last leg of the journey and eventually would end up on NottStreet. Despite the fact that main :roads would be the easi- est and flatt~st routes to take, the group mapped out a route that is . as scenic and rural as possible. \Savage did not follow Route 4 to get here,'' said junior Alex Bartholomew, who hoped to par- ticipate in the event. PresidentHull feels thatthe hike would have been a good way to enjoy the fall season ;;md to be with students. \There is no special signifi- cance[as] to the time [of the hike]. It is something that I thought would be good to do now because the foliage is perfect. It is some- thing that I had done in Wiscon- sin, where the hike was a 75 mile hike over three days, and where we ended up with 10 percent of the student body joining me on that hike. It was a great opportu- nity for students to become ac- quainted with each other and for me to get to know a group of stu- dents well.\ Sadly, President Hull and the interested students will not be able to complete the planned hike be- cause of the lack of interest and the forecast of inclement weather for the weekend.

Historical Sedim,ent · AEPi Contributions Pay Off by Gina CampaneDa Staff Writer One does not often relate the study .of geology with that ofhis- tory. · . H.owever, a somewhat recent study of the undetlyitlg sediment ofCollins Lake and Ballston Lake has proved to be a historical ven- ture. The lakes have been described as unusually deep and due to this depth have accumulated some- thing called dead water. This wa- ter lies just below the normal mov- ing water and is motionless be .. cause it is undisturbed by currants. The sedimenttha:t lies below the dead water is beneficial to scien- tists because ofthe lack of oxygen for decomposition. The water is so oxygen poor that, when brought 1o the surface, bubbles over, resembling a frothy beer. Why does all of this concern Union College? Two of our own professors, Professors Don Rodbell and John Garver of the geology department have been working on the project with some undergraduate assistance since 1994. The sediment will allow geolo- gists to map climatic changes and the effects ·of civilization as far hack as 12,000 years ago. The towns are supportive of these studies and have been reconsidering policies to aid the scientists, The Scotia board of trustees lifted a motor ban on Collins Lake to· allow the team of geologists, chemists, biologists, and civil en- gineers to use a device to map the sediment. The device is a side-scan sonar with a sub-bottom digital profiler and is towed along the lake bot- tom by the motor boat.

The Shah fled to Egypt and the US citizens at the embassy were taken hostage. All aspects of western civilization were banned; the US was known as .. (he great Satan:· The last of the embassy hos- tages were released in 1981, but Iran continued to pose a threat to America and its allies. The rela- tionship deteriorated further when in 1988. during the Gulf War, the US Navy destroyed two Iranian oil platfonns, accusing the Iranians of mining the gulf waters. Later that year, the Navy acci- dentally shot down an Iranian pas- senger flight killing nearly 300 people. But in 1997. Mohammad Khatami and his moderate platform were overwhelm-· ingly elected to tl1e presideney. After eighteen years of strong hostility between the United States and Iran, Khatami called for ''thoughtful dia- . Iogue with the American people.\ Khatam i wanted to put a ··crack in the wall of mistrust'' by exchanging poets, writers. and artists. He was noted as saying, ·'I believe all doors should no'rv be open for such dialogue and understanding and the possibility of contact between Iranian and Ameri- can citizens.''

Trade talks are continuing this week in the city of Tehran. How ever~ many conflicts are far from resolved. Critics question Khatami' s genuine ambitions. Iran is still trying to become a nuclear pmver, and with a reformed government, countries like France and Russia will sell weapons and nuclearblueprints to the Iranians. LastDecemberaUnited States sat• ellite detected a missile engine be- ing tested at the Shahid Hemat fa- cility. These missiles are capable ofcarryinga2,000-pound warhead in a radiusof800miles, far enough to hit Israel or US Army bases in Saudi Arabia. Iran cl.eady has a multitude. of items on which it needs to improve. Re.cently, nine women ran for the Guardian Council and all were de- nied entry.

Tensions Escalate Between Iran and Afghanistan There is a larger conflict growing in the Middle East by Neil Routman Contributing Jt'riter With the bombingsofOsama Bin Ladin 's terrorist network. Afghani- stan is once again in the headlines. Nine years after the United States supported the Taliban' s resistance against the Soviet invasion: the rogue Islamic fundamentalists have turned their weapons and guerrilla tactics against \.Vestern culture. The bombings of the World Trade Center and the Ameri- can embassies in Africa illustrated the power and determination of these terrorists. Last August, the • United States retaliated by waging a missile strike on a training facil- ity in Afghanistan and a chemical/ pharmaceutical factory in the Sudan, causing Bin Ladin totem- porarily retreat from such aggres- sions against the United States. However, there is a larger conflict growing in the Middle East, a fore~ seeable war between the Taliban and the moderate government of Iran led by reformist President Mohammad Khatami. Since the Soviet retreat from Af~ ghanistan, rebels from various ·,sects have been engaged in a civil war. FinancedbyOsarnaBinLadin, the Taliban has clearly emerged as the victor, capturing village by vil- lage, and strictly enforcing funda- mental Islamic Law interpreted by Sunni scholars. The most visible issue at hand is human rights.

President Khatemi hopes that the conflict will be t'esolved tlHough diplortHttic means·. The human and fiscal loses wouJd be extensive to fight decen- tralized guerrilla troops. It would be Iran's Vietnam. One official was quoted, \Bomb Afghanistan? Where?\ But hatred stil.l exists between the two countries; Iran's military stated they are ready to att~ck the \Talibau criminals'' and \take the revenge of the oppress~d by revolutionary force.'' While both sides are talking about peace, both are preparing for war. Clearly, war is in neither country's interests; Iran has too much to lose, Afghanistan has nothing to gain. But one thing Is for certain; western governments seem not to care too much about a war between these two countries. Jmages of•'the great Satan'~ and the bombings of US embassies in Afi;ica have fueled a11 aversion for both countries. And ifthis conflict proliferates, the ,world &;ommunity wi11 have the- blood of thousands of innocent civilians oti its hands.

National Le_adership Much Needed Our country is presently captivated by the Bill Clinton-Monica Lt!winsky sex scandal. Last Wednesday, the majority of major net- works and a host of cable stations broadcasted five hours ofPresident Clinton's uninterrupted tapped Grand Jury testimony. Before this in- cident, mi II ions of Americans spent hours downloading, readi!1g. and printiA.g out the Kenneth Starr report over the World Wide Web. National newspapers printed numerous in-depth reviews and analy- sis of the report, the testimony, as well as anything else related to the scandal. Major corporations are jumping on the bandwagon as welt Coca-Cola alledgedly took advantage of the President's problems; as he stopped to take a drink during the middle of his testimony, the company made sure that it was a diet Coke. Does this sexual scandal affect HS here at school? It might affect us ·in the sense that it is a distraction if we choose to turn on the TV. But many of us do not have cable and we read our class assignments be .. fore any newspaper. For thirty weeks out of the year, we cut oursel\fes Opinions offftomiliere~world.M~oceven~~kepl~eallofiliefune'~nilie ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ real word\ and we are. for the most part, unaware of them. The past two weeks are prime examples of our ignorance with re- gard to national news. Students around campus have asked aloud. .. why is the flag half mast?\' Even on our own campus, we end up ignoring events and issues that affect us on a more personal basis. Yet with this scandal, even the most apathetic student has a stake in the outcome. For the first time since I have been at this school, I have seen this debate move a large number of students to voice their opinions. Not just Greeks, Independents, or even Professors, but everyone appears to have an opinion on what should happen to President ClintotL Why is this issue impm:t-ant to us? It is important because we, as the future leaders of this nation must take an active part in democracy? We might not care whether or not the President did have sex with an intern. yet the quality of our elected officials represent us not only as a country, but as individuals as well. This issue is not a 1i\latter ofbeing innocent and passive bystanders, but of getting involved. So, we must take less of a passive response to the national news and instead teach ourselves to become the leaders that we will need to be in the future.

Working Together for Success Phi Gam1na Delta vows to work for a brighter Greek future To the Faculty, Administration. and StudeRts: Our campus is currently faced with a serious problem. The issue ofSophomore Rush has consumed our schcol for over a year. Past administrative policies have inadvertently neglected the views and needs of the Greek sx,stem. Unf01tunately, this has led. to an unneeded and unwanted recommendation for Sophomore Rush. Had the faculty, administra- tion, and even the students with in the Greek system taken up a more proactive approach, we would not be at this junc- ture. Had the administration, faculty, and students openly communicated in the early stages of this process, a more co- hesive. comprehensive, atld well- received plan could have been achieved. Union College .is the \Mother of Fraternities\ and though not the most important, Greek life is an it'ltegral patt of our earn pus. Often times it is the Greek system that reaches outside the confines·ofthis campus and positively contributes to tile local com1nunity and to so- ciety .at large. All too oftert, it is tne·Greek sys- tem that becomes the scapegoat for the negative occurrences that take place within the confine~ of this campus. And all too often it is the Greek system that is lacking praise, thanks, and recognition for our numerous positive endeavors, It is obvious to everyone that reforms need to be made to the Qloncnrai.ensis The Stttdent Newspaper of Union College Since 1877 Schenectady's Oldest Newspaper Stephanie Slobotkin - Michelle Tbam EDITORS-IN-CHIEF Jennifer Pelose EXECUTIVE EDITOR Eugene Schultz FEATURES EDITOR David Kay OPINIONS EDITOR Brooke Barylick NEWS EDITOR David Brooks Brian Terlinsky David Weiner SPORTS EDITORS J.

With this in mind, it should be the students, as mem- bers ofthe Greek system and Lliti- mately the ··customer'\ to the Union College business, who make these reforms. Before a pro- posal for Sophomore Rush was ever made. the faculty and ad- ministration should have openly assessed the situatlo11 with the student body. Had more open lines of com- munication oeen established from the onset of early faculty .grumbling about Greek life, there could have been a more positive reception to proposals for change. As Frank Rossi poignantly wrote to the faculty in the Septell1ber 24 111 issue of Concordiensis, \1fyou do not like how your classroom expe- rience is going, ask students why things are going wrong.

OP}Ebi ' . - . ~ • ntons ·Telecommunications: Sinking Deeper Into Debt ,, by Lis Kidder Contributing Writer Upon arrival at Union, freshmen received a packet of information to help them become acquainted with the policies of the College. Qne ofthese·policies.was covered in the \Union College Telecom- munications Fact Sheet..\ this sheet gave detailed instructions on how to· use the seven digit, long,- distaiice authorization code. The fact sheet included some useful information,. \students Who would like to utilize the college's network to make direct dial long distance calls c~ sign up for aper- sonal and confidential long dis- tance ... authori:z:ation code ... stu- dents who request a long distance authorizati9fi code mustsign are- quest form which states the terms and conditions of having a code. The person assigned the code is responsible for all calls made us- ing the code.\ The fact sheet also said, \stu- dents are billed once a month ... Union College's long distance domestic rates are AT&T's basic residential rates, providing competitive discounts for evening, night and weekend calls ... \ The question is: what are com- petitive rates? This question pops into the heads of many freshmen when they begin to contemplate the number of hours they have spent on the phone <luring the first month of s~hool. Freshmen call home and their friends at different colleges often. This is because they need a support structure when starting their life in a new place. Hours are spenton the phone with a best friend, or a mother, in an attempt to cure home- sickness. Boyfriends and girl- friends who are still at hQme, or who attend a different college are called all tbe time .. The phone be- comes the;Qnly linkto.keep there- lationship alive. Unfortunately, if one wants to keep in touch with family, friends and significant others, it is frrst nee.; essaryto sign the black book of the teleco1111llunication 's devil. He will give you a seven-digit authorization code, which will atlow you to call your loved ones at a competitive rate. Which brings us back to the question: What are competitive rates? Since Union's long distance company is apparently only com- peting with the long distance com- panies that serve Bill Gates and the owners of small countries, the defi- nition of \competitive rate\ is something other than what the av- erage college student can afford. It costs 28 cents a minute to call dur- ing the day, on a weekday. Twenty\-eight cents a minute is just about as cop1petitive as a track team made UP. of people without legs. If one talks after seven PM, distance rate is an affordable 17 cents a minute. After 11 PM, the rate drops. to 13 cents. a minute and it , is 13 cents a minute on weekendS. · Students are reqU:ired to sell their soul to the Telecominunica- tions office by signing the \Terms and Conditions\ contract to ~:e- , ceive their long distance code. However, nowhere in the terms and conditions was it mentioned that five minutes on the phone would equal roughly the down- payment on a sports car. The \competitive rates\ were never defined. There wasn't even a number provided, so cynical stu- . dents could :find out the ugly truth behind the \competitive rates.\ There is a problem when it is cheaper to fly to France than it is to spend an hour on the phone, Perhaps the Telecommunications office should compare the long- distance rates that they use at · home to the ones they are provid- ing students. Twenty-eight cents a minute is ridiculous. Stu dents, especially freshmen (who depend on the phone to reach the people who support them) should not be spending more on their phone bill for one month than they are on their books. Union should provide a \com- petitive rate\ which is truly com- petitive. Otherwise, there will be many students spending a term in debtors jail because they can't pay their bill. A Message From Safe Space I was sitting around, thinking that this day would be like all the rest ... not much to do and no one to talk to ... just another day in the peer resource room of my high school. I was just about to pull out my homework when I heard the door creek open and saw Brooke standing in the doorway. I knew her in passing -but had never really sat down and talked with her. However, somehow I knew that today was the day that our discussions would begin. The. look on her face was one of a ghost; she had tears stajning her cheeks. She sat down and pro- ceeded to tell me about her weekend ... one that she wanted to forget...one that would live on in her mind forever. This weekend I went to a party with my friends. The party was at this kid Tim's apartment who lives alone. I think he is a senior like you. There were a lot of people from our school there, and I went to have fun with my friends. There was a lot of alco- hol there, and I ended up getting really drunk. I knew Tim a little bit, and before I knew it, we were flirting a lot and then kissing a lot. With all of those people in his apartment, I felt like the two of us were completely alone. I was kind of drunk and .having fun with him, but I also knew what I was doing~ our kisses slowly moved into his bedroom; our bodies quickly fell onto his bed. He got up and shut the door to his room, and suddenly we were totally shut off from the rest ofthe party. He returned to the bed and beganmak- people were labeling her a slut and ing our enjoyable: night very un- whore. It was also hard for any- comfortable.

For those who read my column every week, I guess this week's insta:llment is going to be a bit ruf- ferent from the cheery, light- hearted stuff that 1 usually fill the Feature's section with. 1 have always placed myself ou:t in the open for all to see; I am quite vulnerable in the public nature of my em.otio11s. Yet there is some- thing strangely soothing in know- ing that the fears, joys and anguish you are feeling ar.e shared by so many around you. Writing this column every week for the last 3 years has been like a diary for me; sort of a selfish abuse ofpower on my part. I can pull you into my world and force ycJU to empathize with me when lam feeling firstday of class jitters or the anxiety of growing old. Maybe that outlet for the emo- tiol)alwhirlwind inside of my head has managed to keep me sane for all this time; And 1 am glad that I have that outlet .now to tum to. I have been abitoff-center for a few weeks now. My lack of bal- ance has been due in pal1 to a mix- ture of stress, lac:k of sleep, and trivial biekering, [)ut mainly attdb- uted tg that fact tl:!at I discovered that my father is in poor health. I was a bit hesitant to proclaim this all in the newspa~er, for everyone to see and every.one to know, but I rteed to write, so 11ere. is the place that l will do it. My father is ;a strong man. He can swim 60 laps in my pool and still play a game efbasketball with my brother a11d !afterwards (gen- erally demolishjng us without .much effort). He doesn't smoke or drink and he eats like a normal man his age. He is. still energetic enough to give !lne a piggy-back ride when I wanton e. 1 never once questioned his ability to be physi- cally vigorous through time. My d:ad has always been my hero, a 1nan with no limits, and with an u:ndying affection for his family. He lives life with the utmost respect for the value of each day and rarely allows the strains of tll.e office to carry home withhim. I guess it is for all those reasons tll~t I was so shocked when he told me ~that the results of his stress test indicated a problem with his heart. Here was my father. a person who was the epitome of strength and stability in niy lite. torn down in one computer printout from the d0ctor's office .. I felt like someone was sq ueez- iug my lungs to the point of burst- ing.- I· felt nauseous and l:ig;htheaded. I felt helpless. It seemed like some cntel joke. At :fit:st my family kept the infor- rimtion a secret from me. Conver- sations with them seemed guarded, as if they wert! hiding something. And they were. I suppose they do know me bet- ter than anyone: being familiar with my overly emotional person- ality, they felt tl:!at any brief men- tion ofmy father being sick would by M ichelk T b~rn Editor-in-C/lief set me into hysterics. Well, they were right. lt is a strange point in your life when you have to sta1t wotrying about your parents, rather than them worrying about you. Phone conversations with my father have taken on a strange new twist. I find myself asking him what he ate for dinner, more out of concern than .curiosity. He is taking everything in very casually, since he is still undergoing some tests to futiher determine what exactly caused him to fai.l that stress test. I sup- pose until we really know what is keeping his heatt from function- ing nom1ally, we shouldn'tjump to any overly dramatic conchJ- sions. For my sake, he has been hu- morous. Telling me things like, ''Michelle, Mom let me eat pizza last night. .. but it was the smallest slice ofpizza 1 have ever seen in my life, followed of course, by the largest salad that possibly ever ex- isted.'' And he 'II laugh a little, eas- ing some of the tension he knows that I am feeling. I am thankful for that part of him. The part that stil 1 puts me first, even when he sh<luld be the priority. So I have been breathing a little easier this week, calmer in my skin, stronger in my heart. I don't think there is anything I can do Ol' say to change what has happened in the last few weeks or what will happen in the next few days. I will wait, be patient for these ominous test results to ·c()me back. I suppose that muc11 'like when my parents watched me leave for college, I will now watch as my father ven- tures intoaplace that he has never been befon_ A place where he .is not so big. andnot so sturdy. And I am so scared for him, every part of me hurts with him. Now I understand exactly what it is like. To fear for someone, like a pan:;nt fears for his child the first time he gets behind the wheel of a car or the fint time he calls home sick from college. The fear drags into my skin and leaves me torn, but I would rather love my father and fe<!.r for him, than be so dis- tatlt that I couldn't care. I am glad that I care, and that my upbringing gave me a heari that feels. Even if it hurts. to teel so much. When something Is 1oo extreme for words, it's to the Nth degree.

So far my experience has been diverse to say the least. Last year. I took a full year of photography (Photo I, 2, and 3) and it was during thistilne in which I had come to appreciate the arts. One of my goa:ls while taking Photo was to ~om pose a sty! e that people could relate to.

. · Stierlce &-- 'fe'tlifiol(lgy Science & Technology Stress: A Student's Friend or Foe? by Vidot·ia Hargreaves Science and Technology Editor It's 3 AM. You're halfway through a ten ... page paper for En- glish, you have a Physics test to~ morrow that you haven't started studying for yet, and you haven't even opened the Sociology text- book.You have ten emails from old high school friends that are all wait- ing for responses. You should have written your grandmother a month ago and you haven't spo- ken to your sister in eons. So much to do, so little time to do it. As the hours tick away, the stress mounts. The sweat from your palms drips onto the key- board; your heart beats faster; your head begins to ache. You will get that paper done eventually; you will study for Physics; you will email your friends and call your sister. Al- though we can rationalize that there are other things in life more important than tests and emails, why does this force called stress riddle our minds and, at times, paralyze our bodies'? Researchers defme stress as \a natural response that mobilizes the body's defenses, enabling a per- son to adapt to hostile or threaten- ing events.\ According to this defi- nition, it is stress which on the one band, makes us sweat,,but.li>n.the other, can sharpen our focus to f'm- . ish that paper and study for the exam. Everyone experiences stress at times. Studies show that the aver- age .person has between forty and fifty stressful experiences a day. The National Safety Council pre- dicted that one million people skip work every day because of stress on the job. Only 25% of workers said theywerecurrently\extremely ruses. As a result, the body is satisfied\ with their job, as op- more easily defeated by the bad pos~d to 40% in 1973, according guys and the stressed person has to the American Institute of Stress. a greater chance of getting a cold Whetherit is when a crazy driver or flu. According to the reverse cuts you off or when you have a logic, feeling in control of a sitya- pop quiz, stress can come in many tion and one's stressors can actu- fonns. The most common forms are physical (in- jury), physi- ological (fear), diet (poor nutri- tion), disease (virus), and en .. vi ronm ental (pollution) stresses. The physical and emotional effects of stress are vast and nu- merous. Its ef- fects can range from an increase in allergy symp- toms to heart disease, cancer, and ultimately death. More common side effects include an in- crease in blood pressure, stomacl1 ulcers, tension headaches, fatigue, troubled sleep, chest pains, con- fusion, forgetfulness, depression, loneliness, and an increased ,sus- ceptibility to colds and flus. Experts believe that s~ess-:in­ duced hormones are.Linked,to,c.av diovascular disease and ·izrimwe system suppression in highly stressed patients. When we expe- rience stress our homeostasis, or internal balance, is disturbed. This imbalance causes the adrenal glands to release a hormone, cor- tisol, in response to the stress. 1 ~e cortisol disable.s the ma~rophages, good guys, from .eating the. bad guys, the invading bacteria or vi- ally strength'e~ one's immune re- sponse. Similar to one's immunologi- cal responses, one's responses to stress vary throughout the course of a day. A \healthy pattern\ is one in Which a person's mood is chiefly steady. Alibolish he expe- riences, stress,;hi~ 1-PQR~;r~turns to the st'e'atfy'staYe! shortly after the stress. A \hazardous pattern\ is one in which the person's mood constantly varies between excited and rela~pd states and after a se- ries of stresses, that per~(m has a physical or emotional breakdown. ' Sympt&m~ ofa breakdown in- clude phyS.~~al, ~o~!<wal, and mental·exhaustion; chronic fa- tigue, af1get, self-criticism, cyni- . . - l - - cism,andoversensitivity. While the effects of stress c.an seem overwhelming and even in- evitable, ways to cope and lessen it do exist. Realizing one person can't do everything and delegat- ing responsibUities to others may · seem like one of the most obvious ways .of decreasing stress, al- though in real- ity it can be one of the most difficuH steps for a per- fectionist. Meditation has not :only been proven to relieve . ., . stress, but also and what one would c}tange. Ac- cording to the answers, one should prioritize and by so doing, reduce stress. Making to-.do lists can be help- ful, but they are most helpful when they are realistic, with times for in- terruptions, breaks, and phone calls scheduled in, When all else fails, research has proven that you can fake it; simply imitating a positive mood by smiling or laughing can lessen stress. Some stress is normal and can even be good, in fact. Good stress is called eustress and results from \exhilarating experiences\ such as winning the lottery or unexpect- .edly getting promoted.

Automated Vehicles of the Future by Jeffrey Ausfeld Strljf Writer The long-tetm goal ofboth au- tomotive companies like Buick and the federal government is to develop a system that would en- able cars to be driven without the . assistance of a driver. Right now this may seem a bit farfetched, but in reality the new systems are already under devel- opment. In ordertocoverthe large array of different conditions asso- ciated with driving, there are anum- ber of different potential auto- mated plans that, when used in combination with one another, will allow this feat in technology to work. The first plan is called AHS technology. This plan is for the use on the highway system and not .so much intended for the primary and secondary roadway systems. AHS technology is designed to steer, ac- celerate, and brake an automobile that has been fit with the techno- logical components. The car fol- lows the track of magnets planted beneath the road surface, which tell the car about upcoming road- way features such as curves. merg- ing traffic lanes and exit lanes. I1 uses sophisticated sensing, com- munications, control, and com- puter technology to automate the driving function. The way that this technology works is by creating something like an · · · EZ Pass booth be- fore entering the highway. It is here that the automo- bile is tested for compatibility with the AHS system, If the car passes the test· the desti- ' nation oftl1ejour:- · ney is entered into the car by the driver.

Page16 Fighting Dutchmen Drop Second Straight Penalties and Turnovers Lead to a 28-9 loss by David Brooks Sports Editor The woes forthe Union College FootbaH team continued this week as Alfred University handed the Dutchmen a28-9loss, their second loss in a row, dropping their over- all record to 2-2. Alfred was not only hosting Union last weekend, but their alumni and friends for homecoming. It was Union's third homecoming game in a row, and they once again came up short. To add to the painfil lly long five-hour ride to Alfred, Union was without starting defensive tackle Adam LeBlanc (knee) and captain and starting defensive back Jim Rozal<is (leg). Union would feel the loss of these two defensive start- ers Alfred started the game by kick- ing off to Joe Attanasio who had a 13-yard return. Union's offense came onto the field and took over at their own 26-yard line. Ben Gil- bert then completed two straight passes before being sacked for a six-yard loss. Two plays later, Gil- bert faced a third and 16, and stepped backed to throw, but was intercepted by Mark McGough who then ran back 54 yards before being brought down by Dan Hamister. AI fred took over on Union's 11- yard 1 ine, but the defense once again came up with aJmge series, forcing the Saxons to attempt a 32- yard field goal, which was partially blocked by Union and came up short. Staring on their own 20-yard line, the Dutchmen went three and out before a 41-yard punt by Bryan Slekes. Alfred again started with great field position and their own 49-yard line. On third and two, Union was able to stop Alfred, but Alfred got the first down on a defensive ho !d- ing. Four plays later, Alfred quar- terback Todd Zandrowicz con- nected with Tom Callen for a 13- yard touchdown pass. The PAT was successful and Alfred led the Dutchmen 7-0 with 3:39 to go in the first quarter. Union faced fourth and six from Alfred's 18- yard line aad opted to go for a field goal. A failed snap led holder Dave Robins trying to run his way for a first down but he was met by II purple shirts and Alfred caused a fumble, which was picked up by Brandon Falk who ran 56 yards for the score. With 13:41 to go in the second quarter, Union quickly found themselves losing 14-0. A 26-yard kickoff return by Attanasio gave Union the ball on their own 40 yards line. Hank Paple drove Union 57 yards in 2:40 set- ting up a 20-yard field goal by Morat, cutting the Alfred lead to 14-3. The Dutchmen defense would surrender any more points in the half and with two seconds left in the first half, Union's An- drew Ruffo missed a 46-yard field goal attempt, giving the Saxons a 14-3 lead at halftime. With the halftime stats in Union's favor, the Dutchmen came out ready to win. Alfred started the half with the ball and the de- . fense came out with the brilliance they had against St. Lawrence and WPI. The defense only gave Alfred two chances before Brain Vegliando picked off a Zandrowicz pass and ran II yards to the Sax- ons 20-yard line. With Gilbert back in the game, Union was able to get to the ten-yard line before an ille- gal motion and holding penalty sent them back to the 33-yard line. On third and goal from the 33-yard line, Gi I bert's pass was incomp Jete, however he would connect with Robbins on fourth down for a nine- yard pickup. Alfred took over on their own 24-yard line and began the long- est drive of the day. The Saxons marched down the field for 76 yards during 15 plays and 6: I 6 before a two yard run by the Jeff Colasanti, giving the Saxons a com- manding 21-3lead with 5: 15left in the third quarter. Union took over for nine plays, but was not able to convert on a fourth and three, thus turning the ball over on downs. Alfred went three and out on their next drive, and Union took over on· their own 41-yard line. The offense then showed signs oflife as Paple hit Idriz Abdul-Azis for a 59-yard touchdown pass. The two-point conversion would fail and Union now trailed Alfred 21-9 at the end of the third quarter. The defense again forced the Sax- ons to punt after only three plays; the Union's offense did the same thing, punting away after only three plays. Union got the ball back with 11 :46 to go in the game and, be- hind the arm of Paple, was able to drive 45 yards and had a .first and goal on the seven yard line. Paple stepped back to pass on first down, but the defensive pressured him to throwing an interception in the endzone, putting a damper on Union's chances to win. Alfred would then drive 80 yards and score a touchdown on a 49 yard run by Jeff Colasanti, giving the Saxons a 28-9lead. The Dutchmen still had a chance and took over on their own 35. Their dreams of a comeback lasted only 30 seconds after Paple threw an interception. Union had one more chance, but it ended with a 46-yard punt from Slekes. Alfred held onto the ball for the remaining 2:56 and Alfred walked away with 28-9 victory. The Dutchmen continue to have the best defense in the league giv- ing up only 261 yards a game. However the offense who is ex- tremely young, is ranked sixth in offense. Coach John Audino said, ••we have had a huge problem scoring in the red zone, a problem that we need to fix.\ With two fresh- men quarterbacks leading the team, the offense can only get stronger.

Union was able to rack up 329 total yards against Alfred, compared to the 295 by Alfred. Union also converted on 50% of their third downs, which is much better then their 22% season average. On the 77 plays that the offense ran, there were only 39 plays that everything was done correctly, a number Audino says should be around 70. Although Alfred controlled the baH for four more minutes then UnioN, it was the 11 penalties for 103 yards that killed the Dutchmen. Union also gave up fmu interceptioNs, and al- lowed seven sacks, outdoing their season total by one. Jim Kochan said \We came together, but with Rozakis and LeBlanc o11t other guys stepped up.

Women's Rugby Going Strong by Anne Bishko Contributing Writer The Union women's rugby team played two Saturdays ago, September 26, at home against SUNY Plattsburgh. The game was fast-paced and exciting from the start. Plattsburgh scored the first try, leaving the score 7-0 after the first half. However, Plattsburgh would have been up two at the half had Marissa Reisman not sprinted down more than the field to tackle a breakaway play from Plattsburgh. As the second half got under way Dina. Bronstein, senior co- captain, scored her first try ever, and the only one for Union. Plattsburgh soon scored their second try, which left the fi- nal score at 12-5, in favor of Plattsburgh. Despite the loss, the Union women were · · ,- very pleased with the </::t • · ,.,. ,; • ., •. first try was scored very quickly by Union's serum half, and followed by a successful conversion kicked by Becky Ambrosino. The Union women kept the ball at the Albany end of the field for most of the first half. Union's second try was scored by Reisman, leaving the score at 12-0 at the end of the first half. The second half was also domi- nated by Union, as their third try was scored by Katie Comerford, who dodged through the Albany women. The try was not fol- lowed by a conversion way they played.

Becky Ambrosi.no scored Union's fourth try, and also kicked a successful conver- sion. The Albany team soon pushed their way into Union's try zone, but the Union team held them off and cleared the ball away, so that Albany could not score a try. The final score was 24-0, in favor ofUnion, and the team was very excited.

However, caused some prob.- ________________ the second half did ]ems was the lineouts. This was due to the fact that the referee would not allow any- one to bind on ahead of time. The women played a fantastic game none the less, and left the pitch happy. The team played again this past Satur- day, October 3, against a combined team from Albany Law and Albany Pharmacy. The game promised to be interesting be- fore it even began when two players were told their cleats were unacceptable, and rushed to find extra shoes. In addition, Jen Comerford played for the opponents' team due to a shortage of players. Despite the set backs, the team was focused, and ready .to play. The Union team quickly pushed the Albany team into their try zone, and the have it's share of bad fortune too, First, Rebecca Auerbach and Katie' Comerford each got sent to the \Sin Bin\ at separate times, for allegedly committing too many fouls. Then Walsh got a bloody nose, which took her out of the game for a few minutes. Co-captain Rachel Lutke broke her fmger quite badly while recieving a fly ball, but continued to play until the end of the game anyway. Unfortunately, this injury will take Lutke out of the game for the rest of the season, and the team wishes her a speedy recovery the team did a nice job working together, although they were fed up with the referee by the end. Their last home game is next Saturday, October 10 against Clarkson. Hopefully they will be able to con- tinue tb.eir strong play. ·,.: ,_._ :~ :. • ·'' • ~- , ••• · h.! • \ ,_ ... • • - • •• ' • ..._. ' • ,. ... \ •• \\ ....

They would have said, \Yeah he had a good professional career as an NFL quarterback, but was not anything spectacular\. They would continue by saying that he was one of the first two di- mensioned quarterbacks that could run and throw the ball, thus mak.- ing a defense's job much harder. And then they will tell you that once he broke his leg in the early I 990' s, his ability to run went away and his ability to lead a team went with it I am talking about Randall Cunningham who, for most of his professional career was the star quarterback for the Philadelphia Eagles. Cunningham was the avante garde of quarterbacks, em- ploying a style of play never seen before in football. Not only could be throw the ball with precise ac- curacy and for great distance, he could run with the ball just as well as a running back. If Randall did not have anywhere to throw the ball, he would simply tuck it away and dash towards the end zone. His style of play opened doors for nu- merous quarterbacks around the country as well as increased the size of a number of offensive coordina- tors play books. In nearly every- season that Cunningham was with the Eagles, he helped the team post impressive records and took them to the play- offs numerous times. With the help of great wide receiver Irving Fryar and running back Ricky Watters, the Eagles became ·a team to be feared. ~gham's ability to see the entire field, feel the .pressure coming fi:om a defense, and move in the .p()cket helped the Eagles become :a\Winning organization. Howe-ver, just as fast as Randall had risen to stardom, he fell out of populal'i1y. After suffering a se- vere broken leg, he was sidelined for over a season. With his hopes high, CllDningham returned to the Eagles only have his confidence diminisl-.ed when he realized that on. He did keep himself in shape by continuing his off-season work- outs, but he found himself in Las Vegas, working with a friend re- modeling kitchens and laying tile. Cunningham, however, was not content to live out his life laying tile. Throughoutthe NFL these days, quarterbacks are seemingly drop- ping like flies. In Dallas, Troy Aikman has suffered a number of his abili1y to move and run was nagging injuries. In Kansas City, nowhere near what it used to be.

Cunningham found himself wear- ing a Viking uniform as their back- up quarterback.. Slowly, Cunningham worked himself into playing shape and witlt four games remaining in the 1997regular sea- son, Johnson once again went down with an injury and Cunningham found himself thrown into the kettle as the Vikings start- ing quarterback. Grasping this op- portunity by the homs, Cunningham not only helped the Vikings win, but he helped them reach the playoffs and defeat the NFC East cbampi<>nNew York Gi- ants in a first round pla.yoffgame. Notonly had Cunningham made a ,retUrn to profesSional football, hut his return, four years after his ca- reer threatening injury, was ahn0st as successful as llis early years with the Eagles. This season, Cunr'lingham de- cided to prolong his career for one more ye~. Once again theVikings back-up quarterback, he found himself thrust into the offense once again as J()lu:ison went down with an injury just two games into · the season. Now, not only has Cunningham made an extremely successful return, but he has le'd the Vikings 1 this season, to a 5-4), undefeated record thus farandh~ helped the Vikings. become one of the most feared teams in the NFL. In what CUnningham called his most successful performance ever;. he passed for 442 yards and 4 touchdowns on Monday Night Football this past week againstthe Green Bay Packers. Not only did the Vikings defeatthe P;;~ckers, but they did so in Green l3aywherethe Packers bas not lost since 1995. The 442 yards that Cunningham passed for was the most EVER given up by a Packer team and his performance in this NFC central conference match-up shows that. Randall has clearly returned to the level of play he was once accus- tomed to. When Brad Johnson regains his health and is ready to play once again, taking Cunningham out of the line-up will be extremely hard. While Cunningham realizes his role is as a back-up, he clearly wants nothing more than to be part of a winning organization and to be the player who leads the team to vic- tory. The numbers he has put up since his return to the NFL are as good as nearly any other quarter- back in the league and the facttbat Cnnningllam h\'as been able to do this after retiring for two years shows how talented he)s and proves that Randall truly has been resun:ected. · tennis team's undefeated run came to an abrupt end last Friday, when they encountered a stronger Skidmore team. The fmal score of the match was 9 (Skidmore)- 0 (Union), although there were some close matches on Union's behalf. Co-captain and first singles player Cassie Lawton lost in a close three - setter, as did rookie Susan Y oo, playing sixth singles. Once again, Union's doubles teams set the tone for the rest of the match. All three matches were easily W()n, as Union's teams con- tinuet() ilnprove. Playing frrst doubles were co- captains Jen DeLucca and Lawton, who \WOil. without dropping a game, S-0. AnnetteGrajny, paired with Liz Agar, dropped only two games intheirmatch, winning 8-2.

However, Head coach Tom White was able to recruit Iouri Kolomiets who has done a remarkable job with the women. In their opening race, Kolomeits proved that his team will be as strong as it has been, finishing a strong third place. Cori Kautz co xed the women's var- sity boat, which was comprised of Sarah Ahart, Kristy Butler, Mary Felton, Kelly Houle, Tara Noyes, Melissa Sullivan, and Naemmah Tan.

Security Notes: On October 12, 1998 Dean Alford sent a memorandum to the Campus Community. As a safety annoWlcement it is included in this week's Security Report. Last Thursday night, shortly before 1 O:OOpm, a woman student was accosted as she was walking between Silliman Hall andSouthCollege. Fortunately, the woman was able to get away~ although she did sustain minorneck strain from the attack. the woman alerted appropri- ate campus authorities, who in turn notified the police. The incidents prompts a reminder to all students the importance of observing thefollowing safety message. 1. Do not walk alone or jog alone after dusk. 2.If it is necessary to go out at uig·ht, please use the Escort Service at 6386 or go with a friend and use well-lit areas. 3.Let someone know where you are going and when you expect to be there. 4.Report any assault or attempted assault to Campus Safety at 6911 immedi- ately. 5.Report any suspicious people or behavior to Campus Safety at 6911. 6.Do not prop doors to residence halls or let strangers into the building.· . \ In honor ofbreastcancer awareness month, the W&myn's Union and the Pre-health society are sponsoring a proj~t.called \Petals on a Rose.\ Petals will be sold in the campus center~ Greek and theme houses, and in the residence halls.

The fmal piece, Mussorgsky's \Pictures at an Exhibition,\ was _Stu_dent Wins Accolades· by Brooke Barylick News Editor Last Spring, many of the stu- dents at Union College partici- pated in an event called \Dialogues on Race.\ Twenty-one student or- ganizations, dozens of faculty and staff and the College's athletic teams hosted more than 30 events and activities. These talks encouraged an ex- change .of ideas and concerns re- garding diversity on the. Union College campus. They allowed students and faculty alike to ex- press the changes and improve- ments they would like to see and in what direction they think that Union should go ,in order to recruit and.retain a more diverse student body and staff. These talks occurred over the span of a few weeks. The discus- sions actually continued into many classroom environments as well as social situations. These talks were facilitated by Beth Wierzbieniec of the Class of 1999, with the belp of other students and . faculty. Wierzbieniec also actively par- ticipates in the popular Big Broth- ersfflig Sisters program here at the College. During the scllool year, over 75 Schenectady youths are placed with college students who act as their mentor and friend. However, these youngsters are left during the summer months to fend for ~~emselves until the Col- lege resumes in September. Wierzbieniec realizedthis problem, and to change it she developed and directed a summer camp for ' these children this past summer, the first ever in the College's history. Many local youths had the abil- ity to participate in the fun and edu• cational activities that were estab- lished by the camp. In addition, Wierzbieniec is the President of Student Fmum. She is a leader on campus who guides the Co liege in a positive and construc- tive direction. She always listens intently to the suggestions and criticisms of fel- low students in order to preserve the high standards that Union ex- pects of its student government. Now, one might wonder how Wierzbieniec completes all of these tasks. One might alsQ wonder why she actually does all of them. The answers to tliese questions are actually quite simple. Wierzbieniec is a giving and caring individual who wants to better the community for those around her. She is humble and almost appears to lack confidence in her own im- pact on this College. Fortunately, this is not the case because Wierzbieniec is the recipi- ent of the \Creating a Welcoming Community'' award. This.award was established by the Hudson Mohawk Association of Colleges and Univer~ities, which represents twenty area schools including Union, Siena, Skidmore, Hartwick, Albany Medical College, Albany Law Schoo land Albany College of Pharmacy. Each sch<>ol has the opportunity to submit one recommendation of a student of any year wllo excels at creating a more welcoming commu- nity at their particular institution. The awards ceremonytook place on Wednesday, October. 7, at the University of Albany/SUNY Cam- pus Center Ballroom. It was an l!ll-day event that com- menced with lunch and led to many activities which one could chose to attend. The events ranged from a National Coalition BuildingWork- shopto a student pane] to focused roundtable discussions with expe- rienced professionals who work in the field of diversity and tolerance management. A reception after the conclusion of the day's activities preceded the actual awards ceremony. Each nominee was recognized for his/ her achievements. President Roger Hull was then asked to approach the podium to read the letter of recommendation that he wrote for Wierzbieniec. The letter cited the many activi- ties in which Wierzbieniec is in- volved and placed special empha- sis on her Dialogues on Race project, her commitment to Big Brothers/Big Sisters a,nd her work on Student Forum. He praised her achievements and commitment to the community. He thanked her for her countless hours of dedication to the better- ment ofUnion Collge. Wierzbieniec graciously ac- cepted this award and reminded all that the purpose of her activities and involvement is not to be rec- ognized, but to change the com- munity for the better. She is an example to all college students that they can, indeed, help the community and succeed in college. actually written following a visit to an exhibition of .paintings and wood-carvings done by Victor Alexander Hartmann, a close friend ofMussorgsky's who bad died.

Hockey Rink Opeils Filmmaker Enlightens Campus with Ideas, Thoughts . ·' '\ Are There:_ Plans for Change? by Portia Zwieker Sta.fTRiriter Did you know a Hollywood di- rector was at Union last Friday? Yes, it's true; famous people come here and talk about their work. This time it was director George Hickenlooper. Surely you've all heard of the film \Slingblade.\ Hicken,looper di- rected the original, a 30 minute short with the same name. It also stars Billy Bob Thornton, as well asJ.T. Walsh. Shot in black andwhite, it's about a murderer (Thornton) who is about to get released from an institution and tells his story to a reporter. The majority ofthe film is Thornton's monologue, which he delivers in a rough, scary voice that he discov- ered he could produce by mistake. From that short, Thornton went on to produce the feature film that we all know. Bl}t it was Hickenlooper who started it all. Paul D' Anniable/TC Hickenlooper educates the audience on filmmaking. by ;Jes$ica Zue~llte Contributing Writer The need for renovations io the Achilles Rink is inevitable dlleto a compilation of building ciicum- stances. , According to President :Roger · Hull, as efnowtheA~hillesRiJ:Jkis \unattractive congested and sim- . . ply does not work welL\ Novemberof 197 5 was wh~n the hockey team first skated on the clean ice in the Achilles Rin:k. The Achilles family members, who .funded the enormous ,])toject · were avid curlingplayers and made the installation of a Cl!rlingrillk in the basement a necessity. This Canadian sport neglected to gain enough support frQm the . campus to be financially beneficial · so the space has been unased since the early eighties.

Wheelchair viewing seats and rnore offices for the coaches are also apart of the plan. The esti- mated costoft11e project is 3 5 milm lion dollars and will take approxi- mately six to seven months to fin- ish. · The drawback is that the mon~y has yet to be raised through alumn~ contributions. In a presentation in the Olin Cen- ter Auditorium, Hickenlooper pre- sented \Slingblade\ as well as a · feature length film called \The Low Life.\ ----------------------------;. hockey team to a NCAA Divisi<ml attended the -lectw:e that \The Low Life\ was basically his own ·story. President Hall's policy states that .no new construction can. take place before the money is fully available. Consequently, there is nO\ exact date <>n whieh th'is project will commence. The story is about a young writer who moves to Los Angeles to try to break into the screen writ- ing business. He has to settle for menial jobs such as separating car- bon copies from credit card bills, and doing desk work for a less- than-honest landlord. He has a few friends from his jobs, a romantic interest (played by Kyra Sedgwick), and an odd roommate. He is forced to deal with the death of his uncle, the ambiguousness ofhis relationship with the girl, and fmally, the death ofhis roommate. Hickenlooper explained to the crowd of students and faculty who Hickenlooper himself moved to Los Angeles to start writing and directing, but struggled for a long time before anything happened. Now Hicken looper works with such names as Thornton, Natasha Richardson, ami Nigel Hawthorne. In fact, b()th Richardson and Hawthorne star in Hickenlooper's next film, \The Big Brass Ring,\ a film originally written by Orson Welles which Hickenlooper adapted. Hickenlooper also discussed his views on film school. He thinks film school creates \a !IlYOpic vision\ in the eyes of the students. In other words, since the students' refer- ences are all movies, there's little . room to reflect and create films based on life experiences. Hickenlooper himself attended Yale University where he majored in European History. It was exciting to be able to meet anahear a real Hollywood direc-- tor. Union students should really pay attention to those flyers we get in the mail and try to attend\ team and the recent pro!>osed switch from women;s club tovar- sity ice hockey have both fullda- mentally caused the need for ruodi- . fications in the rink.

Montan11 Stoff Writer do research both in basic biology and public health, as well as work with the NYS DepartmentofHealth while completing their degree. by Mary Felton Staff Writer On Wednesday the fourteenth of October, the third annual \Feigenbaum\ forum took place. The title of this forum, sponsored by the Feigenbaum brothers, was \Communicating Across Bound- aries: A Foundation for Innova- tion.\ It focused on creating a \boundaryless\ organization. The purpose of this forum was to dis- cuss innovation and efficiency in highereducation. It f<Jcused on dis- mantling barriers to change in in- stitutions. President Hull described it by saying that, \ ... colleges should not operate with a series of silos ... \ meaning that every facet of this institution should be integrated rather than separate. ·*' Drs. Annand V. and DonaldS. Feigenbaum, are graduates of the classes of 1942 and 1946. Presi- dent Hull commented that these · two brothers have been very gen~ erous not only fmancially, but with ideas and innovation for the Col~ lege. The \College's administration building is named for these two who have given so much time to this community. • Drs.

The Threat of International Terrorism by Neil Routman Staff Writer Earlier this year, the Central In- telligence Agency was caught completely off guard when the In- dian government announced the conducting of five underground nudear tests. Fifteen days later, Pakistan answered with five tests of its own. These occurrences stunned the world, but analysts should have seen them as being inevitable. The world has entered a new age, and age where multiple countries have nuclear power and rogue nations are trying to develop them. Throughout the Cold War, the United States and the Soviet Union dominated the world in a strict bipolar system. The world was clearly cut into defined boundaries and borders. After the break up of the Soviet Empire in 1989, each country fonnerly domi- nated by the Russians had an in- ternal political conflict. Some ended with reasonable compro- mises, but many ofthese areas en- gaged in civil wars; the new fac- tions that have risen out of these conflicts pose a great threat to western civilization.

Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic has until Saturday to fully comply with the committment he has made to the U.S. to cease violent repression against his citizens in Kosovo. Over the course of four days, Milosevic is required to order a cease-fire in all regions, allow West- ern humanitarian aid to be admin- istered and distributed, allow Kosovians to return to their homes, and to allow a 2,000 mem- ber U.N. team to inspect whether he is complying with these de- mands.

Kosovo is a province within Serbia, the ethnically and geographically dominant part of Yugoslavia. Kosovo has a history of relative autonomy. It enjoyed certain rights and privileges within Serbia and within the fonner Yugo- slavia that was comprised of Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Macedonia, and the present day Yugoslavia. Kosovo's autonomy has always been linked to its ethnic makeup, which is 90 percent Albanian in a province ofabout2 million.

Fluctuations Effect Global Economy ·· · .. . . · . · · · . end as Japan, Russia, Thailand, Malaysia, by Heather Clements and Brazil were all targeted as causes for Copy Editor extreme ·fluctuations in 1he international mar- Washington - Last Tuesday, President Clinton met with world fmancialleaders to developauni:fiedplan for combating ~there­ cent global economic crisis. In closed-door sessions, fmance ministers and central bank., ers representing the largest_.economies dis- cussed the current problems of plunging stock markets, currency devaluation, and growing unemployment. In addition, Clinton delivered an address to a joint meeting of the World Bank and the Intemation~l Mon- etary Fund (IMP) stating tl).at long tenn pre- ventative measures must be implemented to avoid future declines in the global economy. kets. Because of crises in these markets, the · V:riited S1ates stock markets have been a ro1ler coaster of recent activity, with extreme hiNis and lows over weekly spans. One way the United States has responded to the growing economic uncertainty was to lower short term interest rates. This decision, an- nounced by Federal Reserve Board Chair- man Alan Greenspan last week, lowered the interest rates by 0.25% in anticipation of a drop in U.S. growth. ctl:nm.oririensis =• October 15; ·1998 • Page ·7 Clinton V s. Nixon by Stephen Nemeth Contributing Writer As our nation draws closer towards im- peachment hearings,.acomparisonbetween · Bill Clinton and Richard NiXon becomes ap- parent. These two men, two politicah.ntith- . eses, share some similarities. and differences especially within their respective Ptesiden- tialyears. Recently a CNN Poll asked 729 adults what they thought was the most serious scandal that has affected the Presidency. Watergate topped the list at 39% followed by tile Iran- Contra Affair23%, then running a close third the Monica Lewinsky Scandal at 22%; Why do you ask if the Lewinsky Scandal is far less important than either of the preceding two, why do we continue to dwell on it, ad ·nauseum? One of.the answers lies in the economy. In ·1973- the economy was slippir\g and the country was in tile midst of a recession, mander-in-Chief. Additionally, it shows that people are willing to live under a morally bank:iupt individual as long as the economy remains the same. This period of economic growth and prosperity is helping Clinton as well as making the American people more tolerant of things it might not otherwise be. Another answer to the original question is the difference in crimes that these two committed. Unfortunately marital infidelity is something that is rath~r commonplace and rather frequent in the White House. People can relate to Clinton's crime and be more willing to give Clinton the benefit of the doubt and the privacy that he wishes. This is radically different than what Nixon did. How many people can relate to using the CIA, FBI, and the IRS against one's political foes? Clinton was quoted in the New York Times as stating, \[The mar.ket] can react swiftly and harshly when countries stray from sound policies ... The market also can over- react, subjecting even countries following good policies to severe pressures.\ Clinton also suggested that the IMF develop strate- gies for combating regional economic de- cline before areas such as Southeast Asia, Russia, or Brazil can negatively affect the world economies. C]jnton proposed that the United States give the ~ $18 billion to begin sucll preventative programs. ·Federal Reserve member Laurence Meyer commented to the New York Times that though ~'the Federal Reserve is not the cen- tralbankoftheworld ... we do live in a world economy and therefore have a powerful in- terest in its prosperity.\ In effect, the Fed- eral Reserve is trying to safeguard. U.S. mar- kets, attract foreign investment, and sup- port programs to stabilize the world economy . . In addition to fortifying the domestic mar- . ket and advocating stronger IMF bailout programs, the United States is also pushing for governmental refonns worldwide to pre- vent future economic crises in problem re- gi<>ns. · an oil embargo and revelations from the ·Watergate case were beginning to emerge . The times we live in provides a contrast. 1973 was a different time, with different eco- no~ic conditions, and a dramatically differ- ent press. In Nixon's day the word impeach- ment was taboo in political circles, it was considered the \atomic bomb of the consti- tution\ the rationale behind this was that we have it so we rarely if ever need to use it. People were not thinking of impeachment until every single facet ofWatergate became evident. The citizens of this country were also concerned of the effects of impeach- ment, \At the time of Watergate, everyone thought the nation would be tom apart,\ writes Gladys Lang, a professor emeritus at the University of Washington, but when Nixon resigned \the whole thing ended not with a bang but with a whimper\. Perhaps that \Whimper\ makes the thought of im- peachment easier, from the first day of the Lewinsky scandal the media as well as po- litical insiders starting dropping the I-word. The\atomic bomb of the Constitution\ has become less feared, and we ate more cogni- zant of the fact that we might have to use this on our politicians more often. Addressing Republican skepticism for Clinton's early bailout plan, Secretary of the Treasury Robert Rubin stated in the New York Times, \It is past time to put aside in- stitutional rivalries unbefitting public insti- tutions with the same share llolders ... The IMF and the World Bank must evolve to meet the new demands of the global economy. All of us must work together.\ Rubin also harshly criticized the govern- ments ·of Southeast Asia, specifically Ma- laysia, for precipitating much of the global economic crisis. Muchfmgerpointing occurred this week- F(j)r example, many Southeast Asian coun- tries have been the targets of criticism be- cau.se of government policies that limit ftee trade. Treasury Secretary Ru.bin denounced the \misguided exchange and capital con- trols [that] are not the answer for dealing · with the effects of this crisis.\ The United States is urging world leaders to not only agree on long term measures for global economic stability, but to come to a general consensus on how to resll:scitate the faltering markets in the short run. J11e interdependence of many world markets is necessitating immediate action to prevent further flucfuatio~s of the global economy. Unemployment was widespread and':people were showing little confidence in their . economy. Nixon and his growing .scandal represented at the time a validatio.n of the country's perception of its leaders since the Vietnam War. In 1998, the U.S was experiencing.an eco- nomic upswing where unemployment was at the lowest it had been in years; consumer confidence was at an all time high. People are becoming accustomed to the continuing allegations leveled against their president and the actions that he has done during his tenn. What is even m()re shocking is that Clinton's approval rating remains tile about the same now as it did before his crimes be- . came public. The difference between the two eras is that in our day, people are more willing to tolerate the faux pas of our Com- ..,. · t ) 1 • 1 - I I l < I · ' \ I . ~ I l -....; '\ J ·: S i I .~ ( • - t> 1<.

Page 8 • October 15, 1998 • <!tnmn:dri~sis Should U Be Afraid of the Dark? Rape, sexual assault, and violation are tenns we hear about but often donot directly associate with ourselves. We are convinced by wills of luck and a Union shield that nothing could ever ha,p)Jen to us. We feel too safe here in our collegiate bubble. We are sheltered from the wrath of.the world, the cable television that we do not have, the wars in Iran and Afghanistan, people on the other side ofthe fence, the dark corners. According to a 1990 study, a significant number of the world's population are routinely subject to torture, starvation, terrorism, humiliation, mutilation, and murder. So why- while we call Union College our escape from' re~lity- do we see the crime, feelthe violence, and have to fear the outdoors? Where is our safety after the lights go · out? At 9:51 PM last Thursday evening, a girl was \physically grabbed by an unidentified individual.\ According to sec11rity, the girl was walking passed Silliman Hall when she was approached and then assaulted. Sources say that another girl walking a few yards ahead, heard the victim scream and other students arrived atthe scene to chase the attacker away. If that other female had not been there, who would have played the role ofthe hero'? Who would have heard her scream'? The issue at hand is the lack of safety outlets on campus after the sun goes down. According to the Campus Facilities Committee, new ligllts are placed on campus each year in accordance with where students feel it is too dark and an area ofpotential peril. However, the committee, in coalition with campus safety have failed to notice that assaults occurred on . campus, on the lighted paths, during hours before midnight. Though we are cautioned not to walk alone, we do it anyway. But should we be afraid of the dark on our own paid-for propercy? Should we have to fear what's lurking around the 0 lin or Schaffer? The blatant answer is \No.\ We are becoming bcreasingly aware of assaults that are closer to · home. The evidence of this year and instances from muggings in years past should suggest that the campus needs to reevaluate their mode of protection. Campus security should have enough people on staff to post guards at various danger zones on campus. They could alternate nightly watches on a more strict bases tijan they do now.

OP/ED Opinions Support For Sports Much Lacking To the student body and faculty: Three weeks ago, it was great to see so many alumni at tne Homecoming football game, but the number of students wit() showed was a bit disappointing. This is nothing new to Union sp()rt.- ing events, unfortunately. We have struggled to get over 100 people toattendbasketbali,, baseball, softball, soccer, aBd la- crosse games consistently thi$ decade. It is especially disap- pointing this year as the women's soccer team is on fire,. just defeating. the #6 team in the nation, William Smith. One of the greatest things about Union College that many schools lack is the physical pres- ence of most athletic facilities and fields right on the ·under- graduate campus. At UCLA, you would have to travel an hour to arrive at the Bruins home fo;ot- ball stadium, the Rose Bowl. At Union, you can walk less than .five minutes from your donn room 001d watch a great sporting event. It is something we often take for granted, but when we were threat- ened with the removal of the hockey rink to an off-camJlllS lo- cation, we quickly were reminded of the importance of such location questions. We also underestimate the im- portance of crowds at ·sporting events. At Texas A&M, tile Aggies crowd is nicknamed \The 12th: Man\ because. the noise and electricity the crowd .generates is like having an extra man on the field. During the Hobart footbaH game, the crowd noise caused Hobart to eat a delay of game pen- alty that nearlygave Union the op- portunity to complete a late come- back. Unfortunately, the crowd during most other points of the game was mysteriously silent. The decent number of Hobart fans, however, helped carry their team to victory. This weekend, the football and women's soccer teams play crucial home .games, the women at 4:00 PM on Friday and both teams at 1:00PM on Saturday. How can you be in both ptaces at the same time Saturday? Easy. Simply walk from Gari~ Field to Bailey Field and vice versa throughout the afternoon to voice your support for both teams. Why is this weekend so impor- tant? The soccer team has a chance to move far up in the polls, possibly as far as #2 in· the New York Regional Poll with two vic- tories this weekend. How can we expect the voters to show this team respect if we can't show them the respectthey deserve by · rooting them on to these impor- . tant victories? As for the football team: while the team probably is eliminated from the NCAA playoffs, they still face three currently unde- feated teams, and their season ends with three road gam.es. Ail ECAC playoff slot is still pos- sible if they can come roaring back, especially against #2 in the East, RPI. Union's arch-rival will bring over 1,000 fans this week- end to your house.

When a frater- nity or sorority gets involved, more activities, services, and cleanups are ,possible because the power of the tnany is greater than the power ofthe few. Ifthere was no Greek life, then there would be no such means to rally 25 or 30 people to be involved by the tilt of a hat. There are many other advan- tages to Greek life such as a strong intramural system and philan- thropy around campus. To restate my earlier point, to hamper the Greek system is to de- stroy Union heritage. Not only will the heritage be diminished, but the future of the school would be in serious jeopardy. ( r s (

Page 8 · October 15, 1998 · Ohm.cndri.tnsis Should U Be Afraid of the Dark? Rape, sexual assal!llt, and violation are tenns we hear about but often do not directly associate with ourselves. We are convinced by wills of luck and a Union shield that nothing could ever happen to us. We feel too safe here in our collegiate bubble. We are sheltered from the wrath ofthe world, the cable television that we do not have, the wars in Iran and Afghanistan, people on the other side ofthe fence, the dark comers. According to a 1990 study, a significant number of the world's population are routinely subject to torture, starvation, terrorism, humiliation, mutilation, and murder. So why- while we call Union College our escape from re.ality- do we see the crime, feel the violence, and have to fear the outdoors? Where is our safety after the lights go out? At 9:51 PM last Thursday evening, a girl was \physically grabbed by an unidentified individual.\ According to security, the girl was walking passed Silliman Hall when she was approached and then assaulted. Sources say that another girl walking a few yards ahead, heard the victim scream and other students arrived at the scene to chase the attacker away. If that other female had not been there, who would have played the role of the hero? Who would have heard her scream? The issue at hand is the lack of safety outlets on campus after the sun goes down. According to the Campus Facilities Committee, new lights are placed on campus each year in accordance with where students feel it is too dark and an area of potential peril. However, the committee, in coalition with campus safety have failed to notice that assaults occurred on campus, on the lighted paths, during hours before midnight. Though we are cautioned not to walk alone, we do it anyway. But should we be afraid of the dark on our own paid-for property? Should we have to fear what's lurking around the Olin or Schaffer? The blatant answer is \No.\ We are becoming increasingly aware of assaults that are closer to home. The evidence of this year and instances from muggings in years past should suggest that the campus needs to reevaluate their mode of protection. Campus security should have enough people on staff to post guards at various danger zones on campus. They could alternate nightly watches on a more strict bases than they do now. This could ensure a safer environment on campus from an obviously unsafe outer world beyond our gates. If we cannot prevent strangers from entering our walls, and we simultaneously do nothing to deter them, the least the campus could do is keep their eyes on our lives via surveillance cameras. They are installed on many campuses across the nation, protecting the men and women from the dangers or reality we hide from \in here.\ The fact of the matter lies in the idea that we are not as safe on our small college campus as we could be.

How C!lll · one knowthat they will become a victim? Are we to place blame on the innocent, giving them the mes- sage that they should have known better? I hope not. As a former member of Safe Space and as a person with personal ties to 1ihe subject, I do not wish to attack Safe Space as I do commend their efforts bu:t instead wish to further their message. Is it right that a guy who sexu· ally abuses or rapes a girl is con· sidered a \stud\ while the girl is put to shame and usually blame<! for the incident or told that she is · \making itup?\ (This was the case in the story of 'Brooke' in last . week's article from Safe.Space) Most people say no, but shrug it off saying that it is the fault of so- ciety. Ifyour friend went out an<! killed someone, would you con- sider him a stud? In most cases, I would hope to think that y()u WO'uldn't. I ask you then, why do the majority of us label those who have committed murder differ- ently than those who have com- mitted rape? Both mw:derand rape are against the law. One person lives and one doesn't, so that is enough criteria to label one a stud and the other a horrible person? In both cases the whole or at least part of the body dies, the only differ- ence is in rape, one has the oppor- tunity to rebuild ifonechooses to. Survivors: know that you are not to blame and it was not your fault. Do not be afraid to seek help, uti- lize Safe Space as well as those you trust. Know that you are not alone even though you may feel that way. Friends and family of survivors: the best thing you can do is listen, be supportive, but never say you know how the survivor feels un- less you had the same experience yourself. Question your beliefs, question what you joke about. Is it truly funnyor does society just tell us it is funny? Don't be afra~d to say how you feel.

To exhibit this '\conservatism\ Americans must begin to cease squandering their fiscal resource on risky and tri.fling causes and begin investing that crucialcommodity in substantial ventures that pn:nnise long-term secarity and benefit. They must also cease being depen- dent of the government to provide for their every whim and start ex- uding the blessed virtue of rugged individualism which our forefa- thers employed to create the American empire from the zeal of shear wiU and faith, without any concrete tools, materials, or assis- tance. Furthermore, Americans must search for strength and counsel from the Almighty Lord, whose empowerment has never failed to deliver them from the shackles of their bondage. Although Americans are indi- viduals who must rely on their own merit to achieve the trappings of success, the mentor of their ef- forts should always be the infal- lible God, as opposed to the im- perfect idol of mankind. And most importantly, American citi- zens sheuld deplore the germs of secularism and apostasy that seek to abrade the soil in which our in- tegral principles are delicately planted. That soil is the human soul! Had enough, or are you thirsty for more! For those of you in the latter, stay tuned. For those of you in the former, get lost and go on ~some retreat-maybe you'll see the light! Are We Still In America? by Lis Kidder Staff Writer When sitting on the steps of the Nott memorial on a crisp fall af- ternoon, it is possible for one to drift lazily into thought, \Ah the beautiful Union campus ... the col- orful leaves ... the picturesque architecture ... the musical sirens ... wait. .. musical sirens?\ At this point one wakes up from their daydream. Sirens? The ques- tion which leaps into the minds of many students is: Are we still in America? Leaving aside the astronomi- cally high phone rates, there are many blatantly fascist facets of Union life. An obvious example occurred this Monday, when stu- dents sat in class on Columbus Day. Granted, Columbus Day is not as \American\ as Labor Day, which was the punch-line of Union's Communist joke this year, \Ha Ha Ha! The first school day ofthe year is on Labor Day!\ America was founded on three- day weekends. Where would George Washington or Abe Lin- coln be without the third day? Jon Tapper has adequately ex- posed the Union College mascot. However, what many fail to notice is that a caste system has been es- tablished. A group of second class citizens, like the serfs or peons, live in a world of injustice on campus. They have been given the name \freshmen and are forced to eat in separate dining facilities from the \normal students.\ Another diabolical move by din- ing services is the two-hundred dollar declining balance. Spend it, or it gets sucked away to fund the evil exploits of various political monsters. A subtle hint of the maniacal forces at work is carried by every student on campus. Like the hope- less oppressed, students are re- quired to carry their ID with them at all times. Armed soldiers are posted at various sites on campus; ready to shoot an ID-Iess student at the slightest provocation. Reminiscent of the ideas brought forth by the novel \A Brave New World,\ the government controls student employment at Union. Those with \government ap- proval,\ the \Alphas\ of the col- lege, are the first the get jqbs. Those who are not approved for work- study, are forced to dig trenches on the outer rim of campus. If one focuses on the tyranni- cal power of the college to inflate prices, a phenomenon called \Rampant Grape-Nut Inflation,\ becomes apparent. At Union, a box of grapenuts (roughly the size of one bowl of cereal), costs approximately four dollars. This is also a problem in the bookstore, where the prices of every item are inflated about 510% ab()ve normal \American\ prices. Why can the bookstore get away with this! Because they are a monopoly: an economic tyrant, banned in America for many years. Most students are either un- able, or afraid to venture outside of the gates of Union College, into the war-zone known as Schenectady. Therefore, there is no competition for the bookstore. Evil is afoot at Union. A big, red foot that stinks of Commu- nism. The irony of this is captured in the name: Union College. The question that all students must now ask is: Are we still in America?

A Response to Safe Space \Don't be a victim!\ Is that re- ally the important message that we are supposed to get out ofthe Safe Space article in the October 8 is- sue of Concordiensis? How can one know that they will become a victim? Are we to place blame on the innocent, giving them the mes- sage that they should have known better? I hope not. As a former · member of Safe Space and as a person with personal ties to the subject, I do not wish to attack Safe Space as I do commend their efforts but instead wish to further their message. Is it right that a guy who sexu- ally abuses or rapes a girl is con- sidered a \stud\ while the girl is put to shame and usually blamed for the incident or told that she is \making it up?\ (This was the case in the story of 'Brooke' in last week's article from Safe Space) Most people say no, but shrug it off saying that it is the fault of so- ciety. If your friend went out and killed someone, would you con- sider him a stud? In most cases, I would hope to think that you wouldn't. I ask you then, why do the majority of us label those who have committed murder differ- ently than those who have com- mitted rape? Bo~h murder and rape are against the law. One person lives and one doesn't, so that is enough criteria to label one a stud and the other a horrible person? In both cases the whole or at least part of the body dies, the only differ- ence is in rape, one has the oppor- tunity to rebuild if one chooses to. Survivors: know that you are not to blame and it was not your fault. Do not be afraid to seek help, uti- lize Safe Space as well as those you trust. Know that you are not alone even though you may feel that way. Friends and family of survivors: the best thing you can do is listen, be supportive, but never say you know how the survivor feels un- less you had the same experience yourself. Question your beliefs, question what you joke about. Is it truly funny or does society just tell us it is funny? Don't be afraid to say how y()u feel. Be a survivor, not a victim!

But I don't think we were all attending classes, but Pointless Observations Some Helpful Hints for the Features Writers by David Kay Opinions Editor I would like to apologize to all of my devoted readers who have combed the newspaper over the past few weeks in search of my ar- ticle. It's notthatl haven'twanted to write it; it's just that my section (Opinions) has become very high brow, and the thought of putting this trashy column in there would have really brought it down. So. I thought about not writing it, but then I remembered that there still is a place for trash in this newspa- per: The Features section. So, now that I have anew homeforthiscol- umn, I guess I have to write it on a regular basis. Now that em in this hideous sec- tion, I guess I have to start writing like all of the other writers here, too. So, here it goes, I'm going to attempt to incorporate the styles of all other writers in Features into my column this week. It's going to be difficult because all of them write so well and it's all SO interesting, but I guess I can give it a try any- way. To do this means that I had to actually READ all of the other ar- ticles in th.e section at one time or another, which was actually a thal- lenge in itself, believe it or not. But, I had to fight back my ADD and keep my attention throughout every single article. For some ar- ticles, I had to actually pin my eye- lids back to help myself from fall- ing asleep •. but I got through it OK. Well, here it goes. Enjoy! Jon Tapper's Weekly Com- mentary: \Wow it's midterm time already. and you know what? I haven't studied at all yeti Maybe it's because there's just so much good baseball on TV nowadays. Those Redsox, they're going to go all the way. You know who the best wrestler is in the WCW? Stone Cold Steve Austin. i like him because he's very strong and muscular and looks great in a pair ofspeedos! Wow, Ijustcan'tkeep my eyes offthe screen. Blah Blah Blah Blah ... (sorry, that's where I started to drift off) ... somethirtg about David Kay ... something more about baseball ... and that does it for this week! I'm sure you've all made it to this point in the article (the · end) and if you have, make sure to send a letter to box #203 7. The first one to do so will win a prize. I haven't actually ever given. anything away yet, but then again, no one has actually gotten through an entire article of mine either (not even the copy editors). See you next week for another fun-filled edition of Jon·Tapper's Lame Commentary!\ Michelle Tham: \Sometimes when I'm at lunch and the lady at . upperclass makes me a sandwich, I look down at it before I start to eat and think about those times when I was five and my daddy used to pull the crusts off before I started eating. Then, I r-emem- bered the time when I was six and my daddy pulled the training wheels off of my bike. I guess that I have spent the last twenty years of my life dwelling on the insignificant facts ofadult- hood. Maybe I happen to be overly sensitive, and maybe I am not, but l think that we all need to stop and be young again. Justta:ke one day t() stop the hectic sched- ule that you run and ride a bike with training wheels, take a walk with mommy, and hop in the seat of the grocery cart. Believe me, it will be worthwhile and fulfill- ing-1 ~ow from experience.\ Matty G's World: (I'm sorry, but this kid's article was just so boring and monotonous, I couldn't help but to doze off ev- ery time I took a stab at reading it. I apologize). Eugene Shultz's \Riding The Pine:\ \Now that I'm a fraternity man, every one of my atticles is going to be pro-fraternity! Hope- . fully ifl associate myself with fra- ternities and the such, I will get girls.\ Now that ~·m writing in Fea- tures, I guess that I'll have to start writing boring and monotonous articles. What should I make my topics about? My troubled child- hood? Baseball? (Fill in the blank with something incredibly bor- ing). Finally, I would like to make one last point before I close. I think I have a stalker. There's this one girt named Betsy who keeps following me around campus ask- ing me when I'm going to write. I guess that I wouldn't have writ- ten if it wasn't for her this week, but every time she talks to me, I get the terrible feeling that she's my \number one fan.\ Am I going to end up some- where in the Colorado getting my foot chopped off because I couldn't write another column \just for her?\ Well, this column just wouldn't be the same without some Cana- dian jokes in it. So, here it goes: What's green and gold and fall- ing faster than an elephant out of an airplane? The Canadian Cur- rency! Ok, ao that wasn't so funny. Anyway, make sure to send aU letters to box\# 1058 and I'll try to poke fun at them in next week;s edition. Thanks, and hopefully l'll see you all next week. that I missed much. ifthese were I just wanted to let you all know real psychics they would have known that a lot of people were planning on going to their psychic fair and would have planned ac.- cordingly. So next time, Union should get real psychics. Another thing which I am pissed off about is how ridiculous this schoo 1 is when it comes to dealing with certain situations. Some girl gets attacked by a Doid and the ; only thing that the school does is have the master of covering up and smoothing things over, Dean Alford, send out a memo about safety. Too little too late. What about extra security? There is one girl in my building who is constantly that. · So, happy belated Columbus Day. I won't ev:en get into the ar- gument that comes up every year aboutho~ Columbus really didn't discover AmericaandhowNative Americans were here first even though. I agree with that argument. It's just that it is a .serious topic and for right now anyway, it has no business beiiig in this column. Well, that does it for this week. The mail has been pouring in lately and I would love to hear from some people that I never hear from regarding your opinions about this column. So send your comments, ·good, bad, or indifferent to Box: #2037 . atty G's Ephemer!-J~!r!o~tinlo by Matt Gendron Staff Writel' Last week was feature's \Secu- rity Week,\ but since n:o one tells me anything, Pm doing it this week. I've worked at security fora few months now, and I've seen some strange and eerie things. For in- stance, a certain tough-guy secu- rity guard, who takes computer sci- ence classes with the best of our students, enjoys and rarely misses BuffY the Vampire Slayer (which is actually quite a funny show~ Xander, one of Buffy's dose friends in the show is hilarious). And then there are the \boys~' who like to remember what happened on the most recent Monday Night Nitro 1 and then someone else chimes in that Monday night Raw .and the WWF is better than the WCW's Nitro and Thunder. To me it all seems like someone is explaining ballet, whkh I don't · understand either. But they keep on talking about Stone Cold and some other wrestlers.

The value ·oflife has a lot todl,le with the simple concept offriend~ ship. When we are s~aU, our p.ar- ents make sure that we have play- mates and frequent trips to crowded, child-infested.parks. We grow older and find people that spark our interests, intrigue us, and makeus smile. We grow older still and find soulmates, friends that hold o1,1r hearts in their hands through tears, joy,. and heartache. Thankfully, I have fcmnd all of that here at school. In two years. I folllld comfort and wannth in a on<;e strange and foreign atmo- sphere .. College is a place where time spins so fast and experience is sometimes a bit too much. It's a .place where friends ·serve as staples amidst the craziness ... they are constant and steadfast, They . comfort me when I need their arms, and scream with me in de- light when I need their laughter. I wouldn't be able to deal with all these stre.sses and pressures with- out them. They will forever listen (or at least pretend to). They will drop their guard and show you their true selves,. without hesita- tion. They wj}l walk with you when you are afraid, even if they are afraid themselves.

During her child- hood, most ofher family all lived together in the same area. She grew up in the nineteen fifties when women were still taking care of the house for a living, especially in the Dominican Re- public, which was governed as a dictatorship. As a child, Alvarez knew more of the \household arts\ - ironing, cooking, and cleaning - than of writing poetry. One of the poems she read was \The Red Pick-up,\ describing her childhood as a tomboy. Her culture primarily looked upon reading as unhealthy, even for young men. The govern- ment kept information from being written down. Alvarez said she liked stories as a child, but she did not getthem from books. It was an oral culture &he lived in until she moved to America. · On August 6, 1960, Alvarez left the Dominican Republic with her ''I don't know who/ am un- less /write things down. '' -Alvarez up in the Dominican culture. When she went to school, the boys would chase her around the park- ing lot and she discovered that a good book was a way to escape. She started reading books like the Nancy Drew mysteries to learn the English language. She wanted to learn English so that she could make those boys understand that she was not an enemy. When Alvarez was fourteen years old, she and her sister were where Ms. Alvarez \expanded her horizons\because there she was taught the literature of the old classics, predominantly from male writers. This was in the years before Women's Studies and Multicu.Itural Stud- ies, so all tllis was new to Alvarez because it was some- thing outside of her own cul- ture. A lot of Alvarez's poetry is written in wh.at she called a \woman's voice.\ She wrote about what she knew from her childhood. \What Could It Be\ is one of her poems that describes the women of her family (or any family with similar background) ar- guing over a missing flavor from something that they were cooking together. Alvarez finished by saying, \I don't Jrnow who I .am unless I write things down.\ She said that she is a mixture of fW() cultures and where those two cultures come to~ gether is on paper. . sound of the voice is just the ac- companiment.

For those of you that don't know what sX:e is, it's StraightEdge. Furtherexplanation needed? OK, Straight Edge is re- ally a state of mind, a belief. It's when you don't do drugs, drink alcohol, any ofthat stuff. There; s no such thing as being kind of straightedge, either you are or you aren't, it's a very clear line. . Anyw~y, you're probably won- dering what hardcore music has to do with sXe'? Me too. I have no clue. All:Ilm.ow is itfeltgreattobe able to yell, \I'm Straightedge\ along with everyone else there, and have a sense of pride about it, in- stead of being ashamed, because of all those that look down on us, or lookupon us as though we have four heads, Well, when Adam, John, and myself got to the show (at Valen- tines, in Albany.

Forthoseofyou that have never seen a hatd-core con- cert, go see one. It'sworth tb:e trip. For those of you that have always thought that you'rebetterthan me for whatever reason, come into my world, see if you can even exist there. Anyway, the concert was absolutely amazing, even for my- self who has really never listened to One King Down before: I per- sonally got so wrapped up in the concert that I did something I've never done before, I jumped into the pit. Yeah, I got hit. Yeah; I hit others. :But damn, it felt good to not cate about anyone for that couple minutes, with the adrena- line flowing, anything that hits YOI.J, you don't feel. I can't give you an analogy to describe the show, just take my word for it, it's something that you have to go to, for the ex- perience.

There are no props in this show, so every- thing must be mimed, espe- cially by the family. Our own As- sistant Director has taken on a role as well. Wisotzky will be evilly playing the role of the Chief Clerk, the demanding boss of ovetworkedGregor. Other mem- bers of the cast, who will be play- ing the three lodgers, include se- nior Liam Joynt, sophomore Amanda Diamondstein, and our only freshman Erin Zaricki. As stage manager of this pro- duction, I have to say that work- ing with such a talented cast has made my novice job wonderful.

Lippman StaffWriter Has there been .a person in your class that was extremely talk- ative and restless to the extent that t~ey got on th:e nerves of fe-llow classmates or teachers? A .person that called out:answ~rs, that arrived late everyday because he or she behaves without thinking of the consequences of his or her ac- tions? Do any of y<>ur friends or familymembers seem toalwaysbe doing ten different things at once, jumping impulsively from one ac- tivity to the nex.t? These descrip- tions are comtnonly associated with people tliat have been diag- nosed with Attention Deficit Hy- peractivity Disorder (ADHD) or Attention Deficit Disorder{ADD). Between 3 andl6 percen:t of Ameri• can school-aged children have been diagnosed with. ADBD. This percentage brealcs down to .roughly two cases in: every classroom in . the USA. Also, about eight times as many boys- as gir Is have this disability. According to the Diagnostic and StatistiC a[ Manual of Mental Disorders IV (lJSMwJV), ADHD is a developmental neurological dis- order. The DSM-JV is the authori- tative source for information on mental disorders. A licensed doc- tor makes a diagnosis based on the observation of behavioral impair- ments of hyperactivity, impul- sively, and/or inattention that are ... present for at least six months and to a greater degree of severity than in people at their developmental level. Heredity is thought to ac- count for up to go% ofthe ADHD abnormalities. In fact, a defective dopamine gene was found in the genetic makeup of patients.

The caudate nucleus and the globus pallidus have been found to be smaller in ADHD brains. These are two nu- clei (collections of nerve cell bod- ies) that are part of the basal gan- glia. These structures are involved in integrating information from dif- ferent parts of the brain, they also have a part in the inhibition of im- pulsive behavioral responses and they allow the frontakortex: to over- ride immediate responses with planned behavioral responses. Researchers have also found that the vermis region of the cerebellwn, which might have a role in regulat- ing motivation, is smaller in ADHD brains. Research has steadily increased over the last twenty years. This is partly due to a tremendous rise in the number of diagnoses, and mainly due to the rapid advance- ment in technology that has greatly improved the tools of brain re- search. It is hoped that imaging studies will help lead to the discov- ery of the nature of the disorder, its cause, and more specific effective methods oftreatment. Results. sug- gest that disorders like ADHD re- sult from impaired neurodevelopmental processes that take their toll on the nervous system in the form of reduced size and functioning of certain brain structures. ADHD interferes with learning, goal-directed behavior, and social behavior. As the brain abnormali- ties of ADHD patients are identi- fied, and the understanding of this disorder grows, the impact of this disorder on the lives of those who are affected by this diagnosis is recognized as far greater than pre- viously acknowledged. 1 'The New Challenges of Presenting History in Museums\ Do you want to make some extra money?

Lippman Staff Writer Has there been a person in your class that was extremely talk- ative and restless to the extent that they got on the nerves of fellow classmates or teachers? A person that called out answers, that arrived late everyday because he or she behaves without thinking of the consequences of his or her ac- tions? Do any of your frieiJds or family members seem to always be doing tea different things at once, jumping impulsively from one ac- tivity to the next? These descrip- tions are commonly associated with people that have been diag- nosed with Attention Deficit Hy- peractivity Disorder (ADHD) or Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD). Between 3 and 16 percent of Ameri- can school-aged children have been diagnosed with ADHD. This percentage breaks down to roughly two cases in every classroom in the USA. Also, about eight times as many boys as girls have this disability. According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders IV (DSM-!V), ADHD is a developmental neurological dis- order. The DSM-IV is the authori- tative source for information on mental disorders. A licensed doc- tor makes a diagnosis based on the observation of behavioral impair- ments of hyperactivity, impul- sively, and/or inattention that are. present for at least six months and to a greater degree of severity than in people at their developmental level. Heredity is thought to ac- count for up to 80% of the ADHD abnormalities. In fact, a defective dopamine gene was found in the genetic makeup of patients.

The caudate nucleus and the globus pallidus have been found to be smaller in ADHD brains. These are two nu- clei (collections of nerve cell bod- ies) that are part of the basal gan- glia. These structures are involved in integrating infonnation from dif- ferent parts of the brain, they also have a part in the inhibition of im- pulsive behavioral responses and they allow the frontal cortex to over- ride immediate responses with planned behavioral responses. Researchers have also found that the vennis region ofthe cerebellum, which might have a role in regulat- ing motivation, is smaller in ADHD brains. Research has steadily increased over the last twenty years. This is partly due to a tremendous rise in the number of diagnoses, and mainly due to the rapid advance- ment in technology that has greatly improved the tools of brain re- search. It is hoped that imaging studies will help lead to the discov- ery of the nature of the disorder, its cause, and more specific effective methods of treatment. Results sug- gest that disorders like ADHD re- sult from impaired neurodevelopmental processes that take their toll on the nervous system in the fonn of reduced size and functioning of certain brain structures. ADHD interferes with learning, goal-directed behavior, and social behavior. As the brain abnormali- ties of ADHD patients are identi- fied, and the understanding of this disorder grows, the impact of this disorder on the lives of those who are affected by this diagnosis is recognized as far greater than pre- viously acknowledged. 1 'The New Challenges of Presenting History in Do you want to make some extra money?

Men's Rugby Lets One Slip By by Stephen Flaherty StaffWritet The Union men's rugby club played its toughest competition of · the season this week, on a; rainy and slippery home field. The team stepped up to the only undefeated team in the conference, Clarkson, and gave them a run for their money. Union kicked off to Clarkson and withheld a quick push into their own zone by their opponents. The ball was lost by Clarkson, and a Mike Nigro run up the sidelines brought Union deep into the Clarkson zone. The Union men pressured Clarkson all the way to their goal line and with a final push they drove serum halfWill Johnson into the Clarkson try zone for five points. The conversion failed due to a difficult placement and the wet weather. Clarkson picked it up and three minutes before half time they scored a try on an overload to Union's right side. The score was tied 5-5 at halftime. Union's strong defense led by Bill Servant, Dan Rickson, and Alan Gershkovich, kept the team in the game in the first half.

They played their last home game against the Clarkson University team. After a rainy week, the field conditions were very slippery and muddy, only to be enhanced by the rainstorm that lasted all day Saturday. However, the team took the conditions in stride, and played very well. From the start Union dominated the field, not allowing Clarkson to pass the fifty-yard line more than once during the entire game. Play was concentrated near Clarkson's try zone, but it was still difficult for Union to score. The game was full of seemingly continuous serum downs which were not easily won by Union be- cause of the incredibly slippery conditions.

C!I.nncv·driensis • October 15, 1998 • Pa e 17 Cross Country Runs Through Monsoon in Albany by lhlgh Meyer Staff Writer The Union College cross-country team traveled to SUNY Albany this past week- end to race in the liighly competitive Al- bany InvitationaL Wllile both teams were faced with horrid nnning conditions, the harriers were able t() fight against the down- pours and tum iri some outstanding indi- vidual pelformances. The Union CoHe,ge men's varsity seven were extremely well prepared to race over the muddy, five-mile course. After a psy- chotic pre-race rn()sh pit, the men's varsity seven went to war. Leading the way for the men was co-captain Peter Flynn, who ran an outstanding race to finish in seventh place in a personal best ti1t1e of25:51. This was the fastest time by a Union runner in the last ten years. Flynn was also recently voted UCAA runner of1he week by the coaches. Coach Casey was very pleased with Pete's performance and noted that; \Pete ran ag- gressively from tile beginniHg and never let up.\ Freshman Matt Conley came in next in 53rd place with aj>ersonal besttime of27:22.

Coach Casey was very pleased at the J>erformance for !hem en and said, \The guys ran their best race of the year, the intensity shown before the race was phenomenal.\ The Union men finished in 11th place overall in the 22 team field. The Union College women's varsity seven were next on a course that was in a disas- trous condition after five straight hours of rain. However, the women were ready to do their thing and show an even more improve- ment. For the second straight week, Fresh- man Glenna Malcolm led the way for the women, finishing in 60th place with a time of 21:01. Coach Casey was once again amazed by the perfonnance of his freshman star and noted \ Once again Glenna came through and ran an intelligent race.\ Next in for the women was sophomore Amy Slabich, who finished in 80th place overall with a time of21 :37. Zea Wright fin- ished in 93rd place with a time of22:06. Cap- tain Katie MacDowell finished in l 06th place with a time of22 :49. Right on her heels was Elizabeth Henson, who finished in I 09th place, with a time of 23:02. Irene Kan fin- ished in I 19th place with a time of 24:25. Rounding out the top seven for the women was Emily Morse, who finished in 122nd place with a time of 24:43. The grit of the women during this tough race impressed Coach Casey and said, \The women were forced to run after 4 races had already tom up the muddy course. They ran a solid race.\ The Union women finished 15 of19 teams in a very difficult field. Next week the Union College cross-coun- try team travels to Massachusetts to com- pete in the Westfield State Invitational. This course is notorious for being very flat and as fast as an Indy race track. Both the men and women's teams look to improve on some already impressive times for this stage of the season.

Instead, he runs out with the rest of the coaches, weat- ing khaki shorts and a Union foot- ball shirt. He has put down the helmet for a set of coaching head- sets. When Campbell was a senior at West Warwick HighSchool in 1994, his football coach and close ft-iend, Steve Ayels, (whose son Steve junior started three seasons for the football team at Union from 1983- 1986 and was named as an Ali- American as a senior), sent a tape of one of Campbell's football games to the coaching staff at Union. Without knowing the tape was sent, Campbell received a call from Coach Gary Reynolds who said he would like him to come to Union. Although Campbell was re- cruited for baseball, the football coaches were quite impressed with his tape. After several conversa- tions with the coaches and a visit to the campus, Campbell decided that Union was the college for him. \I really liked the atmosphere of Union,•' Campbell explained. However, he never got to pick up a bat for the .Dutchmen. Campbell had an outstanding freshman campaign for thefootbalr Dutchmen in 1995 (with 33 solo tackles, along with 19assisted tack- les, seven sacks totaling a loss of 33 yards, five fumble recoveries, four blocked kicks; two pass de- flections, two interceptions, and two touchdowns). At the end of the season, he was named to both the Upstate Collegiate Athletic Association and the Eastem Col- lege Athletic Conference All-Star teams, and was also named an All ..

Where Has Our Football Team Gone? by David Weiner Sports Editor For a team that came into this season highly touted aro11nd cam- pus, the Union football team has not performed to the level that ev- eryone expected. After beginning the season 2-0, the team has lost two straight, thus eliminating them·. from NCAA playoff history and keeping only a dim ligbt burning in theirECAC playoffhopes. So, from what began as hopes of an lin de- feated season and a NCAA birth, have now become hopes of simply resurrecting their season and find- ing a way to win. During preseason, the Dutch- men did face some adversity at the quarterback position. First, last year's starter Tom McKeown was not invited back to camp. Then, Todd Ellis, who missed last season due to illness, went down with a season ending knee injury in the first week of practice. Finally, sophomore Jeff Ferraro, the team· s probable starter, decided not to play. Thus, with their top three quarterbacks out ofthe line-up, the team was forced to start a fi'esh- man. Along with this fres.lunan quarterback, Union also retwned only one starter to their offensive unit, helping to create some doubt about their ability to score. However, that doubt was clearly erased in their frrst game against St. Lawrence. Every time Union WhatpropelledUniontovictory. touchdown.

So, barring some extremely good luck, it is almost safe to say, \Can't wait until next year.\ Union College football is a well- known, well-respected program. The leve.l of talent thatthe program acquires should allow them to win a lot ofgames. This is the first time in over five years that the team has lost two games IN A ROW.

If this program is going to keep its prestige it has worked hard tl) earn itself, then the team needs to find a new level of concentration and re- turn to their winning ways. This article is not meant to alien- ate players, coaches, or anyone else. It is simply a statement Go- ing to footbaU games is sotnething I enjoy, but going to games that Union is expected to win and watched a lackluster performance is not enjoyable.

Finally, sophomore Jeff F errar(), the team's probable starter, decided not to play. Thus, with their top three quarterbacks out of the line-up, the team was forced to start a fresh- man. Along with this freshman quarterback, Union a]s(} returned only one starter to their -offensive unit, helping to create some doubt about their ability to score.

If Union is to have any hopes of reaching the NCAA playoffs, they must win the remain- der of their games AND pray that a number of other teams lose. So, barring some extremely good luck, it is almost safe to say, \Can't wait until next year.\ Union College football is a well- known, well-respected program. The level of talent that the program acquires should allow them to win a lot of garnes. This is the first time in over five years that the team has lost two games IN A ROW. Last season was a disappointment be- cause they only lost two games. This season is not even half over and they have already lost two games. Fan attendance is seem- ingly a problem every season as well. Losing, unfortunately, is not going to increase attendance. If this program is going to keep its prestige it has worked hard to earn itself, then the team needs to find a new level of concentration and re- turn to their winning ways. This artie le is not meant to alien- ate players, coaches, or anyone else. It is simply a statement. Go- ing to football games is something I enjoy, but going to games that Union is expected to win and watched a lackluster perfonnance is not enjoyable. I look forward to the remainder of the season and I hope the remaining games are more exciting and productive that these first four have been. I I I

The-parade was an excellent op- portunity to cheer on the Republi.- can candidates for offic~ and to walk with politicians such as George Pataki, Mary Donahue, Rudy Guiliani, and Al D' Amato in the. parade. The Union College Republicans were privileged to get such an ex- citing invitation to begin their fall term activities centered on support- ing Republican candidates for of- fice. the parade was not quite as large as the Macy's thanksgiving Day Parade, it still was quite an event and the city came out in support. The parade showed amazing soli- darity of the Rep-ublican ticket with George Pataki, Mary Donahue, and Al D' Amato all walking together. Also New York City mayor, Rudy Guililmiwalked with them to show his support. Ironically, current Lieutenant G-overnor, Betsy McCaughey R()ss attempted to upstage the govemor, by snubbing. the Republican candidates and Walking in frontofthem in the pa- rade. It was anJnteresting sight to see and the cr()Wd seemed to be genuinely excited'to see the Repub- lican candidates and to shake their hands during the brief stops in the parade. _student ·body is interested in be- coming more involved in state ac- tivities. The Union College Republicans are looking forward to an exciting term this fall. In addition to revis- ing their club Constitution, the group has also made dramatic changes to the Republican Club so tllat its members can become more involved and the chapter better recognized throughout the state. Some of the changes made this term include changing the name of tile club to the Chester A. Arthur Society of College Republicans, in- creasing meeting times so that more people can be involved, and actively striving to do more both locally and nationally to support Republican causes. The Columbus Day festivities began in midtown Manhattan where the UnionCollege Republi- cans cheered the entrance of Gov- ernor Pataki and Mary Donahue, candidate for Lieutenant Governor,. to the parade. A sizable crowd of about one hundred people were there in support ofPataki, waving signs, talking with the governor, getting pictures, and shaking hands with him. Afterwards, the Union College Republicans had s()me time to ex'- plore New York City. In addition to seeing Fifth A venue, the group also went to the Empire State Building, Penn Station, and Times Square. There was time to visit other tour- ist locations as well as sample the famous New York City pizza at an Ltalian restaurant. Union students participate in political rally in W~ York City. Electionswere recently held and the new officers are: President, Heather Clements; Chair .of State and National Involvement, Dan Kirsch; VP of Union Campus Ac- tivities, Jeremy Newell; VP of Fi- nance, Matt Gendron; VP ofPub- lic Relations, Sarah Newell; Editor ofthe Republican Newsletter, Will Smullen; and Secretary, Kate Brady. ... The Columbus Day Parade made a grand spectacle outofFifth Avenue with floats, high school bands, ribbon-wavers, celebrities, and an enthusiastic crowd cheer- ing everyone on. The tall sky- scrappers were filled with on-look- ers watching the parade and add'- ing' to the excitement. Although By late aftern()ort, the group had reassembled at the Grand Hyatt Hotel in Manhattan fora candidate rally. The ballrooms of the Grand Hyatt were deluged with Republi- c~ supporters, waving signs and cheering the candidates on. The Union Republicans even got to meet and shake hands with Pataki, Donahu_e, and D' Amato. It was an interesting rally for the Col- lege Republicans to witness he- cause it represented an importaJJ.t moment in D' Amato's campa:igrt. With his poll numbers slipping, the other Republican candidates such as Pataki and Donahue annout;J,ced. their support for D' Amato. They linked their own accomplishme11.ts in office with D' Amato's achieve- ments in Congress and used their clear advantage in the polls to at- tempt to help D' Amato win a Sell- ate race that should be a close ~a.lL Following the rally, a campaign Jui-Jistu Demonstration Sigma Chi Sponsors Educational Event by Jon Kelson Staff Writer Sigma Chi hosted a demonstra- tion in the art of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu last Thursday, October 15, in con- junction with the Elite Health and Fitness Center. Black belt Jiu-Jistu competitor Jay Russell (Jay's record: 65-5!)' and his partners Dean, Chris, and Johnny put on quite an exhibition of their moves and stunts for the crowd of wide-eyed spectators that included students and profes- sors. The presentation was actually more like a mini training session as Russell made sure everyone watch- ing got involved and made the show extremely \hands on.\ Many were asked to help demonstrate certain moves which obviously H- lustrated thet fact that these moves can be learned by all. Russell began with a basic ex- planation in the art Jiu-Jitsu, call- ing it a \safe way of fighting.\ His exposition would consist primarily of displaying the impor- tance of getting to the ground and establishing control over one's -opponent with the mount- ''the most dominant position\ in Jiu- Jitsu. Russell went on to explain the mental aspects involved, compar- ing Jiu-Jitsu to a game of chess. \Human chess;\ as the Brazilians say, is to be us.ed as a way of de- fense in fights. Russell stated that Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu is the \most re- alistic form of self-defense man has ever created.\ He advises to stay back, keep tight on the opponent, stay loose physically, get to the ground, and establish contr()l. Size is relatively unimportant to a certain extent. Russell, himself only 165 lbs., takes on and destroys men twice his size. Skill and knowing what to do next is most important when it comes to defeating one's opponent. Russell and his assistants pro- ceeded to give a demonstration of actual techniques used in Jiu-Jitsu combat. Every-one was able to get involved in the action after Russell explained a move. , Most of those on hand were more than willing to participate and·· jumped on the mats with .enthusi- asm. The experts showed three moves and helped the participants after each. They closed out the exhibition with atwo-min11te sparring session amongst themselves, putting what they had been saying all evening into actual movement and action. The most enjoyable part of the show carne when Russell an- nounced that anyone watching could (attempt to) take him or his assistants on in a sparring match of sorts. On the promise that no one would get hurt, several spec- tators came forward, including Matt A vis, Dave Shaugnessy, Pete Tomasi, Chuck Parish, Neal Van Patten, and Dean Alford al()ng; with his son. Of course, the valiant volunt-eers were of no match for Russell, and. Company, but they gave it their best shot. After the presentation, Russell, Dean, Chris, and Johnny staytd a littie bit longer to answer questions, hand out business cards, sell!- shirts, and offer free Jiu-Jit~u classes at the health center. Russell created an atmospllere for the evening that was bothop(ln and friendly. Junior Andy Donohue remarked, \I liked how Jay incorporated the crowd in with his demonstration. I feel like I learned a lot more by g~t­ ting on the mats with the others and doing the moves myself.\ Russell also brought a certain brand of humor to his demon~tra­ tion, making the crowd break into laughter throughout the show. There was never a dull moment, (lS senior Jeremy Spiegel sai<l, \I had such a great time. It v.'aS S() entertaining to see something original like this.

As many commented, one way to reduce homophobia is not to make derogatory comments about gays, this is something the Union College community is very capable of doing. ,

Page 4 • October 22, 1998 • QlumorM.ensis Campus News No More Missed Chances Benjamin Exhibit by ,Brooke :Barylick News Ellitor Apply for the Watson Fellow- ship. Come to a meeting about the Truman Fellowship. Be recognized for an NCAA scholarship. What do those phrases mean? They are actually (}pportunities for colleges students of all grade lev- els to be recognized for their aca- demic and athletic achievements in some cases by monetary award and in others,, by a chance to travel or continue one's education. A fellowship is money given to a student which allows that stu- dent to particip11te in a graduate school program. Many offer large sums of money that continue througbout all of the years that the student is enrolled in graduate school to help pay for tuition. A honor is acknowledgment or recognition for academic excellence and integrity that integrates oppor- tunity with a monetary stipend to fund it. an example of this would be the Rhodes Scholarship that al- lows a student to study at Oxford University in England free of charge. Obviously these are beneficial and rewarding recognitions for any student. Why is it that most Union College students do not know anything about these opportuni- ties? The answer lies in the fact the Union has previ<Jusly not em- ployed anyone to coordinate nor oversee the fellowships and hon- ors that are nationally offered to students ofhigh caliber. Most colleges and universities employ someone ina part time, and in some cases a full time, position to organize and oversee the fellow- ships and honors that are avail- able. Unfortunately, Union has not incorporated this position until now. Byron Nichols, a professor of Political Science here at the Col- lege, has accepted the difficulttask of being the frrst person at Union College to coordinate the fellow- ships. He will perform this task in lieu of teaching one of the six classes that are required by the College of a professor eachyear. He will supervise each fellowship that is presently established and look to bring new ones to the at- tention of the College. As of now, the majority of the fellowships and honors that the College currently promotes is supervised by a liai- son. Most ~fthese liaisons are pro- fessors here whose particular in- terests coincide with that of the fel- lowship or honor. However, since there does not exist one person whose job it is to publicize and arrange these schol- arships they remain relatively un- known. For this reason, the Col- lege decided to incorporate a pro- gram that would organize the fel- lowships and honors and provide the students with a contact person. Nichols is not looking to replace those professors who already sponsor fellowships, but to assist them in recruiting and promoting the scholarships. Nichols hopes to broaden the awareness for these honors by identifying students who demon- strate excellence in their fields of study as well as ot~er aspects of· their college work that is excep- tional. He plans to visit department heads in hopes of acquiring a list of promising students who have performed well. He also hopes to receive a list from the Registrar of those whose Grade Point Average is superior to most. In addition, he plans to place advertisements in the newspaper to have students actually indicate that they have excelled at something.

It is considered an achievement for a photographer's car.e()r to last more than a decade. In considering this Benjamin sh()ald also be noted for having an incredibly long career, and for winning the Nikon International AV.ards :tifteen years apart. ~ome ofhis additional awards in- clude: First prize in the Time-Life Bi<:entennial Photography Compe- tition in 1()74 and a New Y orlc State CoUllcil on the Arts Artist's Grant in 19~8. 13enjamiirhas also had a successful teaching career.

Student Forum Notes byShaun P.Montana Staff Writer Many Union students may be wondering why there has yet to be any mention of Parents' Weekend, a traditional fall term event. Offer- ing parents the opportunity to come visit the campus, and provid- ing stu.dents with a dinner off-cam- pus or maybe S()me things from home, the weelcend has been teamed with Homecoming the last few years. But notthis time. This year, Parents' Weekend will be part of a packed weekend dur- ing Spring Tenn~ one that will also feature the Dr. Charles P. Steinmetz Symposium and Prize Day. Sched- uled f()r May 7th to the 9th, the weekend will be ftlled with oppor- tunities for parents to not only spend time with students, but also to see S()me of the llest the College has to offer. Besides these long- standil1g events, various theatre and art presentations are also scheduled for the weekend. The Steinmetz Symposium is Union'-'s ()Wll showcase of under- graduate research performed at the College. With over 250 students participating, the Symposium is open not only to seniors present- ing their theses and senior projects, but also to undergradu- ates who have done some kind of research work during the last year. While many parents would often attend the Symposium anyway, co- inciding the event with Parents' Weekend will allow even more par- ents to attend. Prize Day is the day which the College takes to recognize the ac- complishments of students in nearly every aspect of campus life: academics, athletics and especially service performed to the College and/or the greater community. Over 150 students are honored for their achievements in their respec- tive fields. As with the Symposium, many parents also attend this event usually, but tying in the Day with Parents' Weekend provides the opportunity for greater numbers of parents to participate. While many students are not aware of the change, parents have been kept up to date. The Fall '98 issue of the \Family Connection: A Newsletter for Union Families\ included a blurb on the front page infonning parents and families of the change, the reasons behind it, and the other events the vteekend will include. Also, Dean Alford included the news of the change in a letter sent home to parents and · families right around the time Fall Tennbeganbackin September. When asked why the change was made, Dean Alford re- sponded, \These are events where we celebrate the achievements, scholarly, athletic and service, .of our community, and we wanted parents to be a part of the week- end. There will be a full schedule of events including a reception for Dean's List honorees as well as meals, lectures, theater, mllsic, and athletic activities.\ Hopefully the desired goal will be met and Par- ents' Weekend 1999 will be a memorable one.

Nathan Brown is a thirteen year old from Schenectady who should be taking classes in Middle school with his eighth grade peers. How- ever, every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday in.

Nathanattendedelementary school with his peers until the sev- enth grade when he and his par- ents decided that home-schooling would give Nathan the chance to do \a lot of reading on his own.\ \Last year he read many of the Greek Tragedies, including the Aenead. He also read K&fka's Metamorphasis and The Lives of Caesar,\ his father said. Mr. Brown first noticed that Nathan's abilities were far above average when Nathan was either three or four years of age: \Before he even knew how to read, I used to read baseball card statistics to him and he would memorize the numbers. When I took him te shows with me, he would amaze ev- eryone, including Bob Gibson. Nathan knew the statistics of play- ers as well as their whole careers down pat. That's when we knew he was a little bit different,\ Mr. Brown laughed. Nathan too, smiled at the recol- lection. From that point, he con- tinued to progress with children his age Wltil the third grade. Nathan then took a test which earned him a place in the Young Scholars pro- gram. This program is sponsored by the Johns Hopkins University and is operated by BOCES. Because ofNathan's participa- tion in this program, he was invited to take the SAT's when he was 12 years old. He scored \in the range of 650 on math and 750 on the ver- bal\ as stated by his father. In recognition ofNathan's out- standing achievement, he attended a ceremony at Union where schol- arships for various schools were offered~ Nathan's father stated that his son received the scholarship be- cause he lives in the area and is primarily interested in humanities. After receiving the scholarship, Nathan then decided to choose Professor Berk's Concise History of the Russian Revolution from the course listing because \the topic spurred his interests.\ Before entering the class, Berk received a call from Carol Messercola, the Senior Registra- tion Assistant in the graduate pro- gram. He was willing to accept Nathan as a student, but worried whether or not he would be able to keep up as well as how other stu- dents would react to his presence. \I was worried at first, but so far it has been a very good and pleas- ant experience,\ Berk stated. \I'm most interested in history,\ Nathan said. For this reason, he chose Berk's class. \The Profes- sor is a nice person and very funny,\ Nathan said. \I like that he doesn't really go offon tangents.\ Nathan sat in on a class at another school before he came to Union and thought that the profes- sor didnot maintain focus the main point of the ... ~ ......... Now, going into the week of the term, Nathan more than a third ofthe through an 800-page book Stalin. \I haven't had prob- lems with the vocabulary I've understood .,..,~ . .-.Tf:h1n,n.

'~I think I participate a little more, but only because I to~\ Berk's class is receptive Nathan's attendance most fmd him a positive ad- dition to each lecture. \He knows the answers to all Berk' s questions which are sometimes not even related to the reading,\ junior Julie Stapen said. According to Nathan and cuse his cruelty. Stalin ·turned his country into an industrial super- power, but this doesn 't excuse his Gulags and secret police.\ • fl', \I have no fear of snake's \ . ' Nathan said. He even picked one up knowing its type, that it was net poisenous, and that it would bite him. \The snake just eaten and I saw bulge in its stomach \'\'\'\ signified it wasn't :;nt ....... ,t .. ti in me. I also looked at it's tail'to see if math and science,. utiliz- workbooks and other Phil Brown texts. However, Nathan his father, Professor treats him on an equal level as. the other students. Be- cause Nathan raises his Nathan with a snake he found on a hike. would like to take math hand so frequently in class, last week he had to ask others to con- tribute. Berk said that he knew Nathan was the only one who had answers to many of his questions. \I know some answers from the book and some generalliistori<:al answers from outside reading,\ Nathan said. Nathan will have to write three, 8-10 page papers for the require- . ment of the course. However, after writing a 95- page paper the Emperor Caligula on his own volition, Berk's assign- ments seem di- minutive. The exten- sive paper wrote last year an analysis the life Caligula and ad- dresses the idea of whether or not he was in- sane. The fol- lowing is an ex- cerpt from Nathan's work: Besides reading and writing about famous Classics, Nathan~s day is structured from the wee hours of _,.. rooming unti' the later afterncon. He gets up ataround 6:30am each morn- ing, when he begins. to read until his father awakens at abou.t 10:30 am. He is schooled by his father in various literary works. but attacks math on his own. He is currently studying froJ,n a mathematics text- book designed for adults called and science in school be- cause he does not have the lab equipmentathome. \I'mnotthat interested in math\ Nathan said, \but more interested in science because I don't see as many ways to apply the math learned in school in general.\ \I wanted to be taught at home because I thought I wasn't learn- ing enough at a fast enough pace in public school...\ Nathan said. \Also what I learned I wasn't \Whatever kind of mental ill- ness he had, it was not one that completely Paul D 'Annibale/TC Nathan glancing at the text in Berk's Russian History class. deprived him oj----------------------------------- functionatandreasoning abilities. But he was still insane.

The only positive lega- cies that he left were a harbor in Rhegium, some more temples and ampitheaters, roads in the Alps and better maintanence of the roads of Italy. But this doesn't ex- Mathematics: The Human En- deavor. After the completion ofthis te11ll, Nathan plans to continue home schooling. ''i don't fmd not going to schooUike regular gt~t graders dif- ficult because each week I spend two hours with other home schooled students at the YMCA.'; Nathan said that he enjoys the swimming there, but would rather spend time hiking . in the Adirondacks venturing in nature. going to use.\Nathan and his mother also spend timy. reading plays together, such as Shakespeare's Romeo and J11liet. Since hi~ mother works as a tu- tor for the school district, mentoring disabled or injured stud~nts, Nathan's father does a majority of the teaching. How- ever, he also works for the Times Union ofSchenectady. The Schenectady school dis- trict allowed Nathan to continue the Young Scholars Program 11ntil last year. Beyond that, the Brown. family fills out forms each quarter to evaluate Nathan's progress. At home, he studies for long hours and does a considera.ble amount of reading besides that which is assigned for Berk'·s class. According to Nathan and his fa'- ther, since the time that his home schooling began he has pro- gressed faster in the. areas of Lit- erature andHistory. The familyuses History of English Language Teaching Audio Tapes to enhance Nathan's b~c~ground knowledge. There are 24 tapes with 48 lessons taught by a professor from Stanford. \These tapes become a core part of the education,\ Mr. Brown said. The progratn acts as a standard introduction tothe literature oftime periods. \I don't have it planned from A to Z because I try to see what interests both Nathan and myself,\ his father said. · The Brown family feels that Nathan's interests come first,. whicll is a big advantage ofhome school- ing. \I'll let him explore any areahe wishes which is something he,can- not do in public school,\ Mr. Brown said. Fot Nathan's future education the Erowns do not yet know iftheywill continue with. the ' home schoolin-g through Itigll school. \Each year we'H evaluate what the best options are andper..: haps we will have Nathan take some science and math classes at a c.om- munity college,\ Mr. Brown said. Nathan.is currently learning Old English ·as he' studies the language pf the Cadmyn Hymn; the first poem written in English. He is also delving· into Chaucer and Shakespere ott the side. \He pur- sues his inter~sts to the umpteentll degree ... its .[home schooling] is structured with flexibiltiy,\ Mr. Brown said .. Nathan is also studying Spanisll and Latin on his own volition. In Latin he went completed two 11nits from Can'l:bridge Books and is go- ing onto the third unit. Although he is still a beginner in Iafiguages, Nathan plans to command botll Latin and Spanish in a about a year ortwo. \I alsowantto learn French or German and go on trips to other countries/' Nathan said. When asked where he might at- tend coUege, his father said it de- pends on Nathan's interests at the time and if he is offered any schol- arships. Nathan and his father hope to audit another Union course in the future because Union's. his- tory courses seem to require a lot of reading, which he likes. Besides his academic achieve- ments that surpass many yoang- sters his age as well college-level ' ' students, Nathan also likes to at- tend to his reptile collection.Nathan's interest in the study of rept.Hes and amphibians spurred after his birthday in June when ·he decided to buy a reptile. When asked where he saw himself in ten years Nathan said, \I'll have fmished college by 1hen. but every two years or so I keep wavering about career ideas.\ Fit - MOl AAH' AMU ANT' BIO* BIO* BIO* CER' CHM CHN ECO' ECO' EER' EGL' ENS' FRN' GEO GRK GRK HST' HST' HST' LAT' MER MLT MTI-' PHU PHY PHY PHY PSY' PSY' RUS soc MO RIO; HIO' CER ECO ECO ECO EER ESC FRN GEC GER HST IMP IMP .lPN' MTl .

Wodd 'News Examining the Middle East Peace Process by Dan Kirsch Staff W1·iter The Middle East peace process has been stalled. Again. And the U.S.· seems powerless to '~jumpstart'' it. Again. The Israeli- Palestinian political scene is an ex- tremely complicated one, com- pounded recently by the impend- ing expiration of the Oslo Peace Accords signed by the late Israeli Prime MinisterYitzhak Rabin and Palestinian leader Yassir Arafat. May 4, 1999 is the deadt.ine for the end of final negotiations for a per- manent, lasting peace settlement between the State oflsrael and the Arab and Muslim resistance in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. The t\vo sides are repn~sented by Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu and Palestinian Libera- tion Organization (PLO) Chairman Yassir Arafat. The two men have a relatively short history of antago- msm. They have clashed over virtu- ally every issue agreed upon in the Oslo Accords, which is why Presi- dent Clinton has called a summit inviting both leaders to a spot out- side Washington to hash out agreement in relative seclusion. Good luck to him. There was a grenade-triggered explosion Mo11day by an Islamic militantmemberofHamas. Hamas is an Arab terrorist organization believed to be funded by the Is- lamic fundame11talist regime in Iran, and has vowed not to stop until the peace process is crippled and Israel is destroyed. Prime Minister Netariyahu has vowed to now only negotiate secutity issues involving terrorist organizations he has said are associated with the PLO. Whilethis accusation is question- able. Arafat is and always has been hesitatttto severely condemn and take action against terrorist orga- nizatiotls.

His Stated posi- tion on the land for peace scheme is that any percentage of land above a threshold of a further 9 percent would endanger the secu- Jity of Israel. Sharon is no doubt part of the echoing chorus that is threaten- ing to bring down the government ifNetanyahu does not protect the interests of the Jewish settlers in the West Bank. Religious conser- vatives, the settlers' lobby, and Israelis frightened by the Oslo Accords electedNetanyahu. lfhe is seen capitulating to Arab de- mands then his days in office are detinite1y numbered. Candidates forhisrep1acement are already be- ginning to line up, most notably Ze'ev Binyamin \Bem1y'' Begin, son of the founder of the conser- vative movernent (and later Prime Minister) in Israel, the late Menachem Begin. The younger Begin resigned from his post as Science Minister in Netanyahu's government last year due to his opposition to the Israeli withdr·a'wal from Hebron, a city with 450 Jew- ish settlers and 130,000 Muslims. The pullout was seen by many as the giving of an inch, but it seems that the old maxim will hold true: The Palestinians on May 4, 1999 will indeed take much more than amil·e. Palestinians are indeed slowly getting what they want, and Netanyahu often is pressured ·into making decisions against the will of his constituents. While Arafat is not entirely or even directly at fault for the recent spat of te1Tofist attacks, his orga- nization has not significantly at- tempted to conderim or halt tl1e terrorist organizations' activities. Netanyahu is now the one being blained for the failure. Netanyahu is only letting the Palestiniaris and the Americans know that he will not unilaterally withdraw wjthout guarantees of security. That security can only be achieved by fulfillment on both sides of the parameters of the Oslo Accords. It is time for Arafatto condemn Ham as, crack down on all fonns of terrorism, and yank the Israel de- struction plank from the PLO char- ter. It's time to show some good faith, or no_ one will have any faith in peace. China and Taiwan Hold Monumental Talks by Stepllen Nemeth CoJlttiJJutillg_ Writer A senior Taiwanese diplomat left China Monday after recently con- cluding a six -day landmark visit and talks with Chinese officials that they described as \very wann\ and \cordial.\ These meetings have been the first high level meetings between the tvJo countries in five years. Moreover, these talks are the first since they ·ve agreed to reopen talks in 1995, and the highest level meeting between the two in 50 years. The talks centered around China's reunification; a touchy is- sue among both countries since Chinese Natio11alists fled to the is- land in 1949 after being defeated by Mao- Tse-tung and his Commu- nist forces. The Chinese have re- garded Taiwan. as a rogue province ar1d has repeatedly stalled Taiwan's attempts to join the United Nations. As early as last year China staged war games and lobbed missiles outside of Taiwan's waters as a show of force on the eve of the country's first direct presidential election. Diplomats from both sides were sympa.illetic to the fact that reunification would take a long time. Taiwan's lead ne- gotiator Koo Chen-fu was quoted as saying he had ''no . disapj>ointments\ about the outcotne ofi:J is meetings with Chinese negotiators. because the pr<Jbl.ems between the two cannot be resolved in a · short,i>eriod oftime. He also · stated that one of the main . barriersto reunification is.de- mocracy. \China's reunifica- tion hi11ges upon democrati- zation ofthe Chinese main- land. Only when the Chinese mainla.ndhas achieved democracy can the two sides of the Taiwan Strait talk about reuni.fication''. Chinese negotiators have been quick to offer a number of options for reLinification much to the dis- may of the Taiwanese who wish to st<lri political negotiations on smaller matters such as fishing rights. One plan put forward would be a '\one country, two systems\ for- Jiang and Koo shake hands. mula. similar to the ctuTent arJ·ange- mentthat China has with the capi- talist enclave of Hong Kong. Tai- wanese negotiators refused this plan because in their words 'Tai- wan is a sovereign state and will accept no lesser status''. Koo and China's Vice Premier Qian Qichen wet·e also :at odds over Koo'~ accusation of China's attempts to wipe Taiwan off the diplomatic map. Beijing insists that any country with which it has diplomatic relations must cut relations witb Tai- wan. As a result only 27 coun- tries still have formal diplo- . matic relations with Taiwan. Koo a-lso objected to China's obstruction of · Taiwan's effotts to estab- lish formal relations with countries and to join inter- national organizations such a:s the United Nations. Some progress was made during the talks; Koo told Qian that Taiwan was inves- tigating the possibility of joining an international organization to build two nuclear reactors inN 01ih Korea in exchange forNmth Ko- rea abandoning their nuclear weapons program. The Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization project -<? is a consortium of the United States, Japan, South Korea, and the Ettropean Union. China has shown suppott for this project as a means of reducing the threat of nuclear war along the Pacific Rim. It has been admitted that both countries have been driven to the negotiation table by external forces. President Jiang Zemin has been pressured by hard line com- munists and the old guard military leaders to resume talks to regain the island. Koo and the Nationalist Pmty hope that an increased dialogue wlth China will bring about in- creased capital from Chinese in· vestors to their island. Both negotiators hailed these meetings as an .important first step in improving relatiohs between the two countries. Koo and Qian felt that an increased dialogue wi II bring about a more stable relation- ship their two differing ideologies, a more peaceful area ofthe world, and an eventual reunification of the two.

World News ill.om.ori)f.en\\i\\ • October 22, 1998 • Page 9 Jonestown French Students Call by Neil Routman Stt{[{ Writer . . - - Twenty years ago, over 900 members of The People's Temple committed suicide. The event is considered one of tbe most tragic in the twentieth century. The founder of The People's Temple, James Warren Jones, was born on May 13, 1931. The son of a Ku Klux Klan member, Jones was a.ble to invent his own sect of Christianity. Influ- enced by his mother who did not believe in the traditional Judeo-Chris1ian God and dis- sertations by socialist and communist writ- ers, Jones developed a theology based on Pentecostalism with communist tendencies. Jones began his preaching career in 1954 at a Pentecostal church in Indiana. He soon establishedthe Wings of Deliverance, which was later changed to The People's Temple. less \poison\ liquid mixed with Kool-Aid as a drill; he called this exercise a \White Night.\ Some members, particularly the more affluent ones, began to defect. This eventually brought about the destruction for School Reform In 1960, the congregation was officiaUy ordained as a member of the Christian Church; at this time, 20% of the congrega- tion was African-American, which drew at- tention frorn the ntedia. Five years later, af .. ter numerous threats on Jones's life, The P.eople's Temple moved to Ukiah California. The congregation was now uninhibited from ,growing in a racially diverse sense, plus Ukiah was considered a \safe zone\ in case of a thermonuclear war. The congregation grew rapidly; a second congregation was establi.~hed in San Francisco .. ln 1974, Jones acquired a lease from the Guyanese government for land deep in the jungles of South America. Jones chose Guyana because they spoke English and the socialist government was on good tem1s with the US government. The colony of Jonestown started with about fifty people; at its zenith, the complex held over one thou- sand. In 1917, Jones came under investiga- tion by the 1 RS. The allegations included tax eva'sion fi·ori1 retirement homes, which were operated by The People's Temple. At this time, Jones urged his congregates to move to Jonestown in order to a void perse- cution and criticism. The immigrants to Jonestown had to work 7 days a week, often for 11 hours a day. Jones began to desensi- tize his congregation by reading a shmted version of the newspapet defacing America on the P.ublic address system. He was con- vinced that nuclear proliferation was inevi- table; he proclaimed that he could see the future and that America was going to burn. He also claimed to be the Second Coming of Jesus.

The otber day, a friend of mine was thrown through the window of the cafeteria and had to have 52 stitches.\ The nati01~wide strij{e, which, according to some estimates. involves more than soo~ooo students. has gained the attention ofmany national leaders. Education Min- ister, Claude Allegre met with student l~ad- . ers. on Friday. Allegre teld them that he plans to lessen the course load of high school students. Allegre also plans to make transferring easier for students so that they can cover gaps in their courses more easi.ly. These reforms, however, may be too tate for this year's graduating students. Allegre be- lieves many of the students' demands wil 1 not be able to be met until next school year. The demands, however, are doing more than getting the government to look into education. The movement has embarrassed Prime Minister Lionell Jospin 's socialist Gov- ernment. Jospin has been forced to sympa- thize with the students demands in order to avoid the wrath of public opinion. The students' movement comes at an es- pecially itn portant time. Next year's educa- tion budget is soon to be discussed in the National Assembly. Student leaders, hop- ing to influence the proceedings, are plan- ning another nationwide protest on Tues- day. They hope that these demonstrations, unlike Friday's, will be peaceful. Friday's violence broke out near the Place de la Nation in eastern Paris. A group of unemployed youths, nicknamed the \cassurs \vhich literally translates to \smashers has been linked to the violence. The ''cassurs\ are believed to be from the nearby suburbs of Paris. Police believe that this group used the demonstration as an excuse to loot nearby stores and to cause a general disturbance. At least l!O people were arrested. Student leaders were quick to distance themselves from the violence, blaming the unemployed youths as well. Many in gov- ernment were surprised at the uproar. Min- ister A\\egre says the he was ''shocked that a peaceful demonstration has been distorted and disrupted by these acts of violence which have nothing to do with the young people's democratic protest.\ The students have made progress in the way of gaining national attention but many are skeptical about immediate change.

Many Nigerians are hostile to foreign oil companies that profit off of their natural re- sources and leave dilapidated pipelines a.nd petroleum bypro ducts throughout the coun- tryside. These pipelines and many multinational petroleum factories in Nigeria have become prime targets in the ethnic crossfire. These events lead many to believe that future for- eign investment and national stability in Ni- geria will be threatened as a result of recent petroleum-related catastrophes. With Nigeria's dependence on oil exports and other nations losing faith in Nigeria's oil suppliers, ethnic and political cot1flicts may escalate and the stahility of the Nigerian govemment, as well as free civilian rule may be forestalled in the near future. \>.

~age 10. October 22, 1998 . caillttnrMen~i!oii Hatred Fed by Ignorance Children are taught in kindergarten that people come in different shapes, sizes and forms. They are told that differences exist and from that momenton they come to notice delineating traits ratherthanunify- ing ones. And as they age, they notice that the differences become more pronounced; adolescents come to see the \unique\ as foreign and strange ... individuality becomes a grotesque and unwelcomed quality. Blending into the typical stream of peer group approval is the only way to survive undisturbed. That fact is a saddening reality in. the current world of teenagers and most young adults. Even as the majority of youths move forward to graduate.school and successful careers, the prejudices. instilled irt them .from childhood still form a blanketing cloud over their social interac- . tion. In order to form a healthier .society, that sense of ignorance and fear of difference has to be dispelled through education. Despite at- tempts at diversification on college campuses and gender/racial rela- tions workshops in high school auditoriums, the ignorance and bias- related violence still goes on. The sad fact is that most young people simply don'tcare iftheii\ gen- era!ion is tom apart by hate and prejudice. In their attempt to fmd aca- demic success or personal clarity, many between the ages of 18 and 25 · simply do not have the time to deal with the ravages ignorance has been casting through their age group. Crimes based on racial, social, or gen- der-related bias <Jccur so often that the majority of those crimes go un- · noticed. The recent slaying of a gay college student in Laramie, Wyo- ming has left the nation with an overwhelmingly upsetting sentiment on the issue of prejudice based on sexual orientation. What is even more disturbing about the crime is that the two young men accused of committing the murder partially justified their actions on the basis that they believed they were threatened by flirtations from the victim. That sortofignorant behavior may explain why young men account for 80-90% of hate crimes again homosexuals. Perhaps this generation's lack of education or understanding on issues of accep- tance and basic equality has given rise to a dangerous ideology among the youth: that ofviolent removal of anything differentor outside of the supposed norm. That fact should be a call to action among everyone in their. teens or early twenties. To be a part of a generation so dearly labeled for violence based on ignorance is embarrassing: the problems can only be rectified tnrough our own efforts. Young people need to start looking at the dismal state of social interaction around them and start making changes. In searching for a sense of identity, youths are extremely impressionable ... the apparent acceptance of' gay-bashing' crimes leaves doors open for all ranges of prejudice. If one form of bias is deemed acceptable, then more and more forms of discrimination will slowly find their way into social acceptance. From hatred toward women, to intolerance of Hispanics, Jews or gays ... the endless onslaught of big- otry must end at some point before we find ourselves on the road to self-destruction. The termination of the seemingly endless violence can only come with action from ourselves, as we are still young enough to be strong and to care ... action alone will free us from the constrictive binds of ignorance, anger and simple lack of awareness.

OP/ED Opinions Change Necessary From Within by David Kay Opinions £ditor All t0o often, it seems as though it is becoming less and less pos- sible to read this newspaper with- out hearing someone' s opinion about the Greek system. Slanted either positively or negatively, for the past five weeks now at least one article or letter has appeared in the Opinions section of Concordiensis concerning Greek life. For this rea- son, it is strange that I can sit here on Monday night, the night before we send the newspaper out to the printer, without having received any material from professors or students concerning the Greek sys- tem. What is it about fraternities and sororities that harbor so much deep-seated emotion in the hearts of those both inside and outside the system? Why is it that the issue cannot be discussed in a logical and straightforward manner be- tween students and administration without a feeling of resentment standing in the way? Why is it that ideas to reform the Greek system almost always come from the ad- ministration and never from \in- side\ the system itself? Unlike most letters and articles concerning the Greek system this year, l plan in this article not only to discuss the good and the bad, but the origins of the Greek sys- tem-as well. As an independent, I do not wish to slant this article ei- ther pro or anti-Greek, rather I wish to give an objective viewpoint on the situation. First of all, I would like to state all that is good about the Greek system. Besides the \community service\ and \access to social op- portunities\ that brothers and sis- ters like to talk about so much, the Greek system provides the back- bone for social life at this school and if it weren't for that, many stu- dents would leave the campus on weekends. For a number of reasons, frater- nities provide a more ideal soc;ial scene than do bars. Because we don't have to drive home, we need not worry about DWI or a desig- nated driver, Also, since fraterni- ties are not bars, we don't have to pay for beer, mingle with the lo- cals, or worry about carrying a fake ID. Also, If you think about it, the fraternity system here provides the ideal situation for us to dispel the \alcohol phase'' from our systems before we enter the real world where such actions will classify us simply as alcoholics. Unfortunately, however, when individuals drink irresponsibly. the fraternity that served the afcohol takes the brunt and is made \re- sponsible\ for that student's ac- tions. What? t1nderage drinking at Union College? This is the stance that the administration is taking as they refuse to publicly acknowl- edge or take responsibility for the fact that underage drinking occurs at Union. Whenever an underage is taken to the hospital, the frater- nity is placed on probation and is punished as the individual comes off nearly scot-free. The first step that we need to take to reform this system is to acknowledge the fact that students who are under 21 drink and to make them responsible for their own actions. At Bates CoHege in Lewiston, Maine, the alcohol policy is nonexistent; the admin- istration believes that the only way that students can learn is to take responsibility on their own. Why can't the same be true at .Union College? Why is it that fraternities must take responsibility for the actions of an irresponsible indi- vidual? Frequent trips to Ellis Hospital for \substance abuse\ or '\overcon- sumption of alcohol\ are obvi- ously not things that the adminis- tration can be proud of. However, by putting an end to fraternity life, the administration would simply push drinking off-campus, mean- ing that the security report would instead include \driving while in- toxicated\ or \car· accident due to alcohol consumption\ reports. These are things that the adminis- tration and the school would ob- viously not tolerate and would find totally unacceptable. By changing the Greek system to the point of abolition, the ad- ministration would obviously kill the \backbone\ of social life here as well as suffer more serious im- plications as stated above. How- ever, changes do need to be made as a number of problems plague both fraternities and sororities. The first problem that needs to be dealt with is that of hazing. De- spite the fact that many individu- als claim that their house is one that \doesn't haze,\ the problem is ob- viously a major issue and should be fixed by those inside the sys- tem before the administration finds a way to handle it themselves first. Though serious incidents such as that at MIT last year have not oc- curred at Union yet, the system is out of hand to the point that only time will tell when something will happen that is truly regrettable. True, some houses actually don;t haze, and some do it less than oth- ers, but the underlying fact remains that it is an issue that plagues this college and needs to be fixed be- fore a major problem occurs. Al·so, if the pledging process was setup so that it wasn't so time- consuming, we could find a bal- ance such that students would be able to pledge AND handle schoolwork without having to sac- rifice the latter. Once this happens, pressure to conform to the administration's demands will soon subside. The primary reason that the administration wants to \refonn\ fraternities a11d sororities so badly is simply because of com,. plaints from professors concerning \dreary eyed students\ and \late or missing assignments.\ If han• dling the two were inore manage- able, these complaints would not be as common. The next two problems that re- sult from the Greek system that need to be changed are 'those of both hierarchy and stereotypes. You have to wonder, do we really need \fraternities for cool .kids\ as well as .fratemiti¢s for the ''not so cool\ kids? Is it necessary that we hav~e ''sororities for the pretty girls\ as well as the \sororities for the ugly ones?'' I'm not necessarily beingjudg- mental, but isn't it a little childish to have a hierarchy system stron- ger and more prominent than that found at a typical high school? Maybe it's just me, but I always thought that college was a timeand place to get away from that and to be \lost in the crowd,\ not labeled with a status and judged for all to acknowledge. Concerning stereotypes, aren't people strong enough individually that they don't feel the need to as• sociate themselves and their per- sonalities with the charactetisti~s ·of others in their Greek house? Is it necessary ·that almost all become a \stereotype\ once they pledge a fraternity or Sorority and give up an aspect of their own individual- ity? I concede that this may not be true for all who pledge a house, but it does seem to be a rather com- mon occurrence. With their system of hi~archy, fraternities and sororities create an atmosphere of desirability which many observe to have a negative .affect on their ow.n feelings about the system. Larry Gutman, an in- dependent, recounted in last year's May 28 issue how during his fresh- man year he wrote a response to a letter published in Concordiensis. The original letter voiced the opin- i<>n that \the .fraternity men of Union are important to the safety <>f the school in that they keep the campus clear of undesirables.\ His response was, as he de- scribed, \to write as tactful a re- tort as I could muster.\ After his own response, he received \fifteen voice-mail messages insulting me with epithets such as \faggot as well as others too explicit to in- clude in this letter.\ After this re- sponse, Larry agreed that enforc- ers actually do serve to keep the campus safe from undesirables; \I was the undesirable,\ he con- cluded. Do we really need such a system to make some feel desir- able but others merely worthless? I wrote this article for the sole purpose of expressing an objective view on the fraternity system and the effects that it has, both posi- tive and negative. The positive as- pects include the services that it does for the school as well as the community in tenus of social life and service, respectively. We can- not completely abolish the system for these two reasons as well as <:ountless others. However, for a similar number <Jf reasons, the system does need to he refonned. We cannot march 1n1<> the future hoping to become an \upper echelon\ school with the system that is in place now. Change needs to come from within. Nevertheless, the administration will force undesirable modifica- tion-s if change does hot come from inside the system itself, which may result in the abolition of the Greek system or a system much less de~ sirable and prominent than it is today.

OP/ED . ·. • • . nzons ReOecting on the Annals of History • Idealism of,our founding fathers encapsulated in Declaration by W.A.S. \The Wiseman\ Contributing Wtit~r Throughout the history of hu- manity, the prevailing philosophy of society has been heavily influ- enced by the contributions of the raw genius ofman's idealism. In my opinion, this genius has been best encapsulated in the Declara- tion of Independence. Composed primarily by Tho- mas Jefferson arid other enlight- ened, yet pious scholars of the eighteenth century, it introduced a radical theme that sought to drastically ameliorate the basic idea ofgovernment. Instead of the traditional con- ferring of governmental author- ity to the wealthy aristocratic class notorious for its proclivity to \horde this manifesto pro- claimed that the governm~nt should be determined and ruled by each and every citizen, regard- less of class or rank. Rejected was the antiquated concept of an exclusive and privi- leged body of elite's seizing com- mand over a \sovereignty\ and, in doing so, imposing their poli- cies upon the lesser masses with- out first attaining the consent. of these people. Under the Declaration, this was reproached as repugnant to a community ofcivility,justice, no- bility, and most of all longevity-. the type of society that the fram- ers of this document wished to fa- cilitate. After witnessing the collapse or at least deterioration of so many governments established on the autocratic premise, Jefferson and his colleagues sought to replace the tyranny ofBritish Colonialism with arectified order. Thus, these valiant patriots pro- fessed the new and radical theory of government that came to be known as Democracy in the noble declaration. This Democracy has been classically summed up as government \for the people, by the people, and of the people.\ Fortunately, Jeffersonian aspi- rations prevailed, and the new sys- tem of Democratic rule was con- ceived and later enshrined on the American landscape. Besides pro- viding the entire citizenry with an equivalent share of government and the unalienable right to pur- sue any and,all offices comprising that government, the Declaration of Independence also engendered the cardinal purpose of the govern- ment that America hoped to forge. This legendary, but often ne..: glected objective is to protect the \life liberty, and pursuit of hap- piness\ of the aggregate popula- tion indiscriminately. This trans- lates into ensuring that anything, which might imperil the health, safety, and ~elfare of the people or infringe upon their economic freedom and personal prosperity, must be exterminated from the nation. This powerful pronounc.ement has had ·a tremendous effect on many Americans since its incep- tion. For it infers that occur- rences such ~ abortion and eu- thanasia, which all debase the overall value of sacred, innocent, and precious human life, are abominations before righteous and godly man. This is true even though these acts are currently condoned by society as methods to ostensibly benefit the \whole of humanity.\ The aforesaid postulate also decrees that any attempt by the government to deprive one ofle- gal property or inhibit its use for economic advantage is also Democratically antipathetic. This not only proscribes direct confiscation, but also extends its purview to insidious indirect vio- lations such as taxation and oner- ous regulation. Thus, it should be quite evident that this outline of governmental responsibility, fortified by the egalitarian rule by the whole of the people accurately depicts the rubric 11pon which our glorious nation is hinged. Therefore, the Declaration of Independence and the precepts that it boldly enunciated has served as the seeds of this nation's much bountiful harvest. American's who wish to restore the fleeting splendor upon which she their nation was founded, should savor the cherished prin- ciples which the Declaration of Independence established: un- adulterated \life \liberty and \happiness.\ That, my ·friends, is our panacea! In The Name of Sarcasm by Lis Kidder Staff Writer Understanding that it is difficult for many to comprehend the more subtle fonns ofhumor, it is neces- sary, every once in-a while, for a writer whose target aadience is the confused masses, to give them an article which will allow them to sleep at night. It's important to show them that the world really isn't such a scary place and that they can leave their donn room, heading to their class in the Olin center, without· fear of spontaneous combustion once they arrive. One must take a break from hy- perbole and write a straightfor- ward article about the important issues facing the college. For all those who confuse bitterness with sarcasm and subtle irony with angst, here are the t<lp ten good things about Union College. Number ten: Schenectady, \The City of Safety.\ Where else can you buy a gun, a prostitute, some drugs and a Union.sweatshirt? Number nine·The hick of three day weekends. Let's face it, the last thing a stressed college student needs is an extra day to rest. In fact, we should probably eliminate weekends altogether; they just get in the way of curricular flow. Number eight: The Ellis fun wagon. Nothing could be better, after a night of neuron homicide, thanbeingcartedawaywith blood- alcohol poisoning to the land of stomach pumps. Remember kids: binge drinking is fun and safe. Number seven: The sign that says, \salad\ over the salad bar in West. If it wasn't there, stUdents might think they were supposed to make something else, perhaps a mid-sized car, with the lettuce, to- mato and salad dressing. Number six: The abundance of squirrels on campus. This infesta- tion of rats with furry tails serves as a reminder of the beauty of na- ture. Number five: Mass voice-mail- ings. Nothing makes one feel more special than wading through eight junk. voice-mails to discover that the ninth is yet another advertise- ment for Chet' s. Number four The friendly staff of student health, who will gladly outfit any student, coming from a class in the Olin building, with a neck-brace. Number three: The \no food re- moval\ policy in the dining halls. It's important to force students, who obviously have vast amounts of spare time given the enormous number of three-day weekends, to sit in the dining hall to eat. It makes no sense to allow them to bring their dinner back to their dorm, where they could work and eat at the same time. That might make the dining halls less crowded, which would be an atrocity. Number two: People who beat the dead phone rates horse. Don't they understand that we should pay insanely high phone rates on top of1he insanely high tuition? And the number one good thing about Union is: people who waste their time writing for the newspa- per. What are they trying to do, contribute to the college commu- • nity? Expand the minds of others? Catalyze change .and foster im- provement?

This past weekend,, a majority of my friends left fm the weekend, just to escape fora .tittle while and fmd sQmespace outside ofUnic;m Col- lege life. _ Since I couldn't escape by leav- ing, I had my ()Wn sense ofescape by being left alone. I was forced to spend a bit of.quality time with just me, myself and I. At frrst, it was a bit depressing, quite boring, and very, vetyquiet. I ~ad forgot .. ten how tQ be entertained without someone else around. Before I -carne to college, I used to love spending time alone ... I was deliciously content in the vi- brating waves -of stereo-surround sound blun'ing through my room, canceling out the world beyond my door. My parents couldn'tpull me out of the secret life I had hid- den within my fou:r, poster-clad walls. I would sit for hours: read- ing books, painting, tltinking about everything and nothing at all. I came to colle .ea bit anno · ed over the concept of a roommate ·and having my alone..,ness snatched out from under me. Strangely, though, it didn't take long for the seemingly irritating concept of a roommate to become a blessing rather than a tragedy. I had a partner in crime to chat with through .the night, to go to meals with, to borrow stuff from. It was great. Somewhere along the way, though, I completely lost that sense of wanting to .spend time alone in the solace of my own thoughts. \I gained a .sense of · clarity and definition to· a lot oftllings that hail been pressing on the back of my brain for a while now.\ Having someone around the cor- ner, across the hall, or just down- stairs at all hours of the day really cuts into the time I have to spead by myself. I do love the fact that I am always around people who are brimming with conversation and intriguing stories. But, I had pretty much forgotten what it was like to fmd something to do withj~st me until this past weekend. It was sort of a forced reminder that I can still be pretty good com- pany on my own.

A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum by Holly Burnside Sta.f(Writer Last Friday, October 16, I had the oppottunity to see A Funny Thing Happened on the ff'ay to the Fnrum with the Classics Club at Proctors Theatre in down- town Schenectady. Classics being about as far renioved from my major (physics) as possible, it was a pretty ran- dom chance that I had this op- portunity. But it happened that as J: was perusing the tables at the Student Activities Expo a few weeks ago, I knew the person sitting at the Class.ics Club table. She asked me ifl cared to join. and not really knowing wlmt to say to that, I asked, \Wbat does the Classics Club do?\ (Thinking of the scene from The Breakfast Club where Anthon)' Michael Hall describes the ph_:<,'S· ics club: \Wel I. in the physics club we talk about physics, propetties of physics .... \) So my classics friend tells me that they're going to see A Funny Tiling .... ''Well. sign me up!\ I said, and the rest, as they say. is history (he.ehee). Th.e show featUt;ed Rip Taylor, who had his start on the Ed Sullivan Show and has since been seen in television {The Naked Truth.

Christie Staff Writer On Tuesday, October 13, thanks to William Finlay,! was fortunate enough to see Master Class at Proctor's Theatre. The play by TeHence McNally is an attempt to see what might have hapjJened in a opera master class at Julliard taught by Maria Callas. The play is purely fictional but the circum- stances that are presented are fac- tual, as Ms. Callas did teach mas- te•· classes at J ull iard shortly be- fore her death. The play shows Ms. Callas. teaching three opera students the acting involved in op- era and how to present a character on-stage. Twice with.in the play Ms. Callas has an inter-monologue in which all action stops except Ms. Callas has she reminisces about her past experiences. The pa1t of Maria Callas was played with truth and honesty by Carmen Roman. The patt requires the actress to take total control over every aspect of the play and to control both her class and the audience. Ms. Ca1las was a larger than life figure and to portray her on stage, the actress must be able to have the entire audience capti- vated by her every move. Ms. Roman was able to have my full attention thrm,ghout the en- tire play, which lasted a little over two hours. A great gift that Ms. Roman was able to bring out was the humor ofMs.Callas, which, al- though a littk odd; was a nice touch to the production. _ The character of Maria is, how- ever, not the only character i'ri- volved in the show. The three op- era students, played by Frances Limoncelli, Alexander Kariotis, and Melissa LaFrance, were also enjoy- able to watch and very nice to hear. All of their ar.ias were well per- fornled and made tl1eJulliard class- room si.tuation arealistk one. Al- though they had small parts, they are an integral. pa1i of the show working and made the tnost oftheir performance time. The Mus.ical Director also has a bit ~mt as Manny, the ·accompa- nist.

The roll calls for an actor to look unamused at his working situation, and to be overweight. Mr. McLaughlin provided both with a flare and amused many stu- dents who were not entranced with the play, wh.ich was a p-ositive as- pect of the entire perfom1 ance. While I loved this show and would recommenditto everyone, I should mention that n few of the Union students wl1o als() attended the show either fell asleep or left the show at intermission. However, if you are looking for an evening of excellent acting and are willing to see a tour-de~force performance with a strong script, - this is a great show to g,o and see.

Eric Wisotzky is not only a cast member, but also the assistant di- . rector of this term's production. If . you still are unaware, ·the produc- tion is Metamorphosis, by Steven Berkoff. It is a play that has been created from the book The Meta- morphosis by Franz Kafka. This is Wisotzky' s first time as- sistant directing a show. One of his jobs for this performance is to do a lot of work with th.e lodgers. During rehearsals~ Eric is able to spend some extra time with Amanda Diamondstein, Liam Joynt, and Erin Zaricki, defming their characters. Wisotzky says, \I try to spend the time working on the hannonies and characterization of each individual performer.\ Wisotzk:y also findshirnselfhelp- ing Josh Taub to determine more of the emotional aspects of his character. Josh Taub will be play- ing Gregor Samsa, the man who eventually turns int<> a giant insect Directing is a verydifferentjob from being on stage. Fortunately, in this show, Wisotzkyhas the op- portunity to do both. He consid- ers it to be the best of both worlds. He loves the fact th.athe can work with a very talented cast as well as get up on stage with them. Ac- cording to Wisotzky, \When you are performing, you stay focused· on w,batyou are doing. When you a,e on the other side of things, you get to see more of the big picture.\ Wisotzky is assistant director to Professor William Finlay. Wisotzky is happy that Professor Finlay has allowed him to take an active role in directing. He has had the op- portunity to work with the lodgers and then ideas are discussed and bounced off him during rehearsal. As his character in Metamor- phosis, the ChiefClerk, Wisotzky is playing a different part then he is used to. He now gets to play the intimidating person on stage. He quite enjoys the power trip. Wisotzk:y claims that this is the frrst character he has played who is not physically suffering in some way. I wol].ld like to personally thank Eric for allowing me to write this article on such a talented actor and now assistant director. If you didn't already know, Eric is a seven year medical student and this will be his last year performing for Union College.

The Homec·oming bylanEietz Staff writer This weekend, the Mountebanks student theater group will be pre- senting Harold Pinter's The Home- coming. The show will take place on Friday and Saturday at 8 PM and on Sunday at 3 PM in the actor's studio in Yttlrnan Theater. The Homecomingwillbe shown in the round (i.e. the audience will be seated on both sides of the stage). There will be no charge,. and seats will be on a first-come first-served basis. The Homecoming is both mov- ing and funny; it is a simple tale told through the eyes of very com- plex characters. Set in postwar London, it tells the story of a re- tired butcher, Max, (played with red-hot fervor by Heath Heilpem) and his family. When his son, Teddy, (played by the talented Spencer Christie) and his bride Ruth, (played by freshman super- sensation Lis Kidder) return home, the world is turned upside- down, and extreme sketchiness ensues. Other members of the cast include the soft-spoken yet powerful Sam Cousins as Sam, the irrepressibly giddy Greg Fox as Lenny, and the small but wiry Ian Eletz as Joey. The Homecoming is directed by the Tarantino-esque Chris Welch. Make Great Christmas $$$ in Connecticut!

R. Sb.anebrook, a Mechanical Engineering Profes- sor llere at Union College. The Vortex Blood Pump is a mecllanical heart which is de- signed to completely replace a hu- man heart. The specific area .of research of Professor Shanebr<Jok: is the design, and testing of a re- placement left ventricle and the inlet Mitral valve. This article is a. simplified explanation of the re- search project being conducted. There were two major problems with previous designs: undesir:.. able flow patterns within the pumping chamber and poor per- formance of the inlet valve. The flow patterns in other d.e- signs are unfavorable because they did not help to cleanse the inner surface <>fthe pumping chamber which helps to prevent blood dct formation, !he new inlet valve induces a flow pattern that estab- lishes a vortex flow within the chamber. The vortex resembles a smi~ll The\ UJah-UJO\ whirlpool similar to water drain- ing ftom a bathtub. The action of the vortex is to cleanse the chamber's innersutfaceeachtime blood is allowed t<> fl()W into it, and hopefullyreduces.the amount ofblood clotting inside the cham- ber. The second major problem was the poor performan.ce of the inlet valve. This problem has to do spe- cifically with the timing, varying pressures; and tb.e valves ability to prevent back flow within the sys- tem. The Union .... o.u\J;i~tl Valve attempts to correct tllese problems by creating a better seal when tile valve is closed. Other improvemnets are made with rock- ing motion that helps to deal with the changing pressures inside the chamber. :Left Ventricle References: · Interviewed J. R.

Good luck Union.\ The yellow starting buoys flash by, caught on the outskirts of peripheral vision. And so be- gins the Varsity Men 8+' s tour down the Head of the Charles. This 2.5 mile stretch of the Charles River was home to 5,500 rowers and 300,000 spectators this past weekend. One of the largest events in the rowing world~ the Head of the Charles represents the pinnacle of American crew. Back to the racing ... The Union Men's 8+ began the race just be- hind an experienced crew from the University of New Hampshire. Union deftly maneuvered along- side the UNH team and boldly walked through them, leaving them in their wake. As Union moved past UNH, a perennially tough Tufts boat pulled up to their stem. Union and Tufts continued to battle over the first 2 miles of the course. Union was able to keep the power- house at bay until Tufts cut inside one of the many turns of the curv- ing course and was able to pull ahead. The Union Varsity 8+, composed of coxswain Edward B.

I I 'l Tennis Finishes Third in State by Annette Grajny Staff Writer The Women's Varsity tennis team ended their season with a phenomenal third place finish at the New York State tournament, held at the Concord resort in the Catskill's, this past weekend. Head Coach BiH Scanlon couldn't be happier with their final perfor- mance. \They have played strongly all season long, and they fmished on a high note. The girls lived up to their expectations and more,\ said Scanlon. Co-captain and first singles player Cassie Lawton won her first round match in straight sets, eas- ily defeating a William-Smith op- ponent. She lost in the second round to the eventual champion from Skidmore, but managed to get a set before losing in three. Both of the freshman who rounded out the line-up played extremely well, as they did all sea- son long. Fifth singles Liz Agar won her first round in straight sets and moved into the second round. She had a tough three set match against a Brockport oppo- nent, but managed to hold on for the win to get her into the semi- finals. Agar eventually lost to an opponent from University of Rochester in three sets. Sixth singles player Susan Yoo out shined the competition.

Women's Rugby Ends Season With Loss to St. Lawrence by Anne Bishko Staff Writer The women's rugby team fin- ished up their season this past weekend with a double header. After driving four hours north, the team took on St. Lawrence's women. This game was to deter-- mine which teams would head to the playoffs, since St. Lawrence is the number one ranked women's team in the region. The field con- ditions were very slick and D muddyasaresult of the past week's weather. After several play- ers had to find alternative shoes and the cleat situation was squared away, play began. The St. Lawrence team quickly pushed their way into Union's half and kept the pressure on until they scored their first try. Unfortunately it was to be a game full of injuries due to the poor conditions, and rough play by St. Lawrence. First Ellen Taylor fell wrong and hurt her ankle, but con- tinued to play. Stacy Barnard then got hit and injured her knee, which took her out of the game. Lauren Tabas got the wind knocked out of her by St. Lawrence's large eight- man, and also injured her ankle. It seemed that nearly everyone on the team was down at one point or an- other for an array of injuries, and the game was prolonged quite a bit. Somewhat demoralized by the number ofinjuries and the fact that St. Lawrence continued to score, the Union team lost ground repeat- edly. A few gains in yardage were accomplished through breakaways by Anne Bishko and Rebecca Walsh. The back line also did a great job passing the ball out, as practiced in preparation for the game. However, those skills sim- ply were .not enough to allow Union to score. The St. Lawrence team con- tinued to drive di- rectly through Union's line and s c ore several times. The final score was27-0, in favor of St. Lawrence. Union's - ,. the field pleased with their game. They would especially like to thank Steve Flaherty for accompanying the team to their game, and stand- ing in for their coach. His assis- tance was greatly appreciated, and very helpful. After a night in Potsdam, which proved to be very memorable, the an intimidating serum, but nothing was going to hold Union back. The first try was scored by Jen Comerford early in the game.

Although sore and very tired, the Union women were de- tennined to win. They we11t in strong, despite having only 14 people on the field, several of whom were injured but insisted on playing. Tbe Potsdam team had ing everyone in her dust, and scored Union's second try. A couple of Potsdam girls got injured and had to leave the field. Since both teams were down in numbers, the.~crum was switched to only the tight five, and Union began to dominate the serum downs. A third try was scored by Tomi Ailanson, as she pushed her way past several Potsdam girls, and wouldn't let anyone slow her down.

For the frrst time since the opening game, Union dominated the time of pos- session 37 minutes to 23 minutes. the defense, too, showed their superiority not allowing any points and forcing four fumbles and had two interception. Said defensive lineman Kochan, \We absolutely dominated Gilmore, we clogged the middle and took him out of the game, and were able to stop the pass as well. It's a great feeling to beat RPI for all the seniors, and the whole team.\ The defense was led by Jim Rozakis who had seventack- les, followed by yet another im- pressive game by Jim Kochan along with freshman Mike Rothenthal, Kasey Keenan, Chris Doraz, and Radney Wood. The biggest loss to the Dutch- men were injuries. John Visconti is day-to-day after re-spraining his left ankle, Dave Barclay is in a cast after tearing ligaments in his right thumb and is doubtful for this weekend games, and E. C. Stumpf is out this week after spraining his left knee. The Dutchmen have four games left this season, with next week's game against Coast Guard their home fmale. The game plan for the Rensselaer game was to rotate the quarterbacks every play, how- ever when Gilbert got hot, Audino decided to keep him playing. Look for the coaching staff to switch things up against Coat Guard. \Coast Guard is a very good team. We haven't beaten them at home since 1992. They have a strong QB and a great re- ceiver, something we have to shut down.\ stated Audino With Union playing unbeaten teams like Hartwick and Springfield, ifthe Fighting Dutchmen win their remaining four games, they have a very good chance of making the UCAA playoffs, especially if Hobart loses another game.

Union crushed the Red Hawks ofRensselaer33-9, in a game that featured a 3 eo-yard passing day by freshmen Ben Gil- bert, where he completed 24 of28 passes including 17 in arC:Jw to seal the victory for the fighting Dutch- men. Don't the let the nine points deceive you, as the defense was not responsible for any .of these points. Instead, they shut out the number-one offense in the UCAA and limited the league-nrshing leadertoamere48-yards, some 160 yards below his average. The week leading up to the game included some bizarre events which included the \Idol\ being mysteriously painted Rensselaer red, with \5-0\ written atthe bot- tom. To add to the graffiti, there was an article .published in \Concordiensis\ that criticized the team and its poor record. Said jun- ior offensive linemen Greg Williams \The game was brought t() an en- tirely new level.\ The game was filled with 11 turn- overs over 215 combined yards penalized. But it was Union that was able to take advantage of the engineers mistakes. Union won the coin-toss and deferred until the second half, giv- ing RPI the ball to open the game. Star running back Gilmore opened up the game with a one-yard run for Rensselaer, which wo11ld be the story of the game for the defense. RPI went three and out, and punted away to the Union offense, who had no luck either, going three and out. The first quarter contin- ued in this fashion, which included two fumbles and an interception thrown by Union and three fumbles by Rensselaer. The Dutchmen opened the sec- ond quarter with a 66-yard drive, which ended ina24-yard field goal by Steve Morat, giving the Dutch,. men a 3-0 lead. After the Red Hawks took over, Dom. Pitaniello intercepted a Matt Robbens pass and the offense took over on Rensselaer's 28- yard line. Four plays later, Gilbert con- nected with Dan Hamister for 13- yard touchdown pass, giving the Dutchmen a l0-0 lead with 7:22 left in the flrst half. The defense would continue to shut down the Red Hawks and the Dutchmen headed into the locker room with a 10-0 lead at halftime. Union received the kickoff to open the second half, which De- 67-yard drive, wbich was h<igh- lighted by a spectacular play by Gi:lbert. Facing a third and nine, Gilbert was able to escape the rush of the defense and threw a 10-yard completion to Idris Abdul-Aziz while being dragged to the turf. Five plays later, Gilbert again con- nected with Robbins for a 13-yard touchdown pass with 6:45 left in the third quarter, giving the Dutch- men a commanding lead 23-2.

Financially, the projected cost of a lunar mining mechanisms and . transport approached only $15 bil- lion dollars, about one fourth of the cost of the entire Apollo program. However, Schmitt does not look optimistically upon receiving fund • ing from the U.S. Government for space fusion research. \The window for such opportu- nities closed in the '70s; today, government funding is more con- cerned with the growing burdens of the aging population.\ How- ever, Schmitt did not rule out pri- vate investment or foreign compe- tition in regard to the exploration of fusion energy. The F.W. Olin Center Dedication and especially Harrison Schmitt's intriguing speech highlighted the changing environment at Union College. For many generations of Union students, the curriculum seemed focused on liberal arts; the natural sciences seemed to have been left out of the spotlight. With the creation of the techno- logical masterpiece of the Olin Cen- ter, Union once again can confi· dently strive forward, fulfilling the aspirations of the school's founders. Union again is a place where every student can gain an educa- tion in the diversities of academia; liberal arts and science are again joined in a healthy and mutually beneficial arena. ''Wh t I .

On the moon there is one- sixth the amount of gravity that exists on earth which indicates that if a person weighs sixty pounds on earth he will weigh ten pounds on the moon. This led into a conver- sation centering around the moon as a work environment \It was actually quite comfort- able, much easier than on earth because you weigh so· much less. In fact running and walking were similar to cross country skiing,\ Sclu:1litt said. \Once you start mov- ing it is difficult to stop.

The gbve~,. on the other hand, were very difficult to maneuver. They res~rnbled balloons which made pickint?; up objects extremely chal- leil:gin;g. In fact, they only had ten perce11t mobility in their hands. In additi~n, the gloves tended to scrape their fmgertips which made their hands very sore. The suit, as a whole; was its own space ciati. It had a supply of oxygen for the as- tronauts to breathe. It also had a cooling system. When the stu- dents were asked how this worked many answered creatively. But, the actual response was water: cooled underW~ar. . - .. Schmitt explained that they ·worked ten hours a day on the moon for three days. Exhaustion enveloped them, but their pain and fatigue were forgotten because of the enjoyment they experienced from being in-space. Schmitt men· ti,9ned that the original reason for the American exploration of space was in order to compete with the Russians and to conquer a diffi- culttask. But, as the missions con· tinued, people realized that much infotrnation could be discovered from other planets and from space. Schmitt encouraged the continua- tion of space travel, and even en- dorsed programs that send civil- ians into space because it is such a wonderful·and enlightening ex- perience. Students fell silent until Schmitt asked them if they had any ques- tions for him. Many reached into their pockets and pulled out note cards that appeared to have ques- tions that were previously created. The first question was, \What does it feel like to blast off? Schmitt answered by saying that he !Ode on the Apollo 17 that was equipped with the Saturn 5 rocket that weighs 6.2 million pounds an<l consists of 5 large engines that produce 7.5 million pounds ()f thrust.

4 • October .29,. 1C)98 • Qlom;urbietl$iis Schmitt Addresses Geologists by Courtney Hayden Contributing Writer Celebrating the opening of ilte Olin Center this Friday, Harris~n Schmitt,amemberoftheApolb'17 space mission, gave a brief discus· sion to the College's geology de. partment faculty and students. While speaking about his missio-n to the moon in 1972, he also touched upon aspects of the Apollo 17 mission, which differen- tiated it from those in the past. \The Apollo mission was not .de- monstrative of what the US could do, but what freemen in their 20's could do when they believed w:bat they were doing was the most im· portant thing in their lives\ Scbmi1t said. \I:t was not the money, 110t the technology, but rather the mo- tivation of500;000 young men and woman in America which made tile program a success.\ The Apollo 17 mission essen· tially sought to intertwine the fields of space exploration with geology At the start of the program in 1966, astronauts w~re controlled by a central '\astronaut office,\ rather than a NASA team of scientists. Schmitt and his team were brougllt into the program to take over as- tronaut training and introduce a variety ofsimulation experime11ts. The geotogists spent 3-5 consecu- tive days per month in the field teaching astronauts the basics: of geological study. They set up simulation activi· ties in the jungles of Panama and the deserts of Washington State. Though these were attempts to prepare the scientist-astronauts for any conditions they could pcten- tially encounter in space, Schmitt remains skeptical of their impor- tance. He comments, \They were interesting and educational...l'rn not exactly sure if they were nec- essary.\ Schmitt stated that the Apollo program was motivated mainlyby political goals, and provided the means to demonstrate that the US was second to none in the devel- opment of science and techno log:y. At the outset the program was not intended to be centered on human beings, but rather be focused on perfecting the techniques of sma.ll quantity measurement. However, Schmitt feels that the intricaterole the astronaut came to play in space exploration augmented and ener:· gized the space pr<>gram. The Apollo mission made it pos- sible to derive lunar information, which was difficult to obtain by studying tlte earth alone. By ex- tracting samples of the moon's sur- face, the scientists were able to learn abouttheinteriorofthemoon. They deciphered new information about the earth, including a theory that life on earth began after a vio- lent period of time in a water-rich environment. Revolutionizing the standing model of lunar evolution, scientists were now able to relate the history of the earth and moon. Once landing onthemoon's sur- face, the team made a total of lO traverses to explore the surface and collect samples. They slept and ate for three days inthe Challenger, a make shift camp. Though the space suites were extremely un- comfortable to sleep in, Schmitt reported thattnefood was surpris- ingly good. \It was a lot like camp- ing,\ he reminisced, \as a matter of fact, it was better because there were no black flies or mosquitoes.\ Despite the distaJJce of 240,000 miles from earth, Schmitt s·aid the communication between the team and tb..e base in H<>uston was out- standing. In several of the excursions, the team used the Lunar Rover. Having the ap- pearance of a small jeep, and powered by a combination of electricity and a nickel cadium battery, the Rover averaged 10 km/hr. Seem- ingly an insuffi- cient speed~ Schmitt stated that with the lack of gravity, hitting a bump while going any faster would re- sult i;n being propel'led into space for a sub- stantial amoant board and controlled by NASA officials on earth was used tQ pho- tograph the exploration missions .. Though tltese were often some of the most popular pictures, the Rover was used only several times and covered a total distance ofless . than 35 krn during the mission. \Time is relentless in space. It is . inh~rently stressful to work on the moon,\ Schmitt stated. The chal- lenge of collecting data in a short period of time may be one that fu- ture generations ofastronautsmay still have to contend with. Schmitt felt, however, that there were aspects of the voyage that could be improved presently by NASA. The suits the team wore, weighing 370 pounds on earth and 60 in space, were incredibly cum- bersome. After a short period of time, the astronauts became fa- tigued and research more difficult to conduct. · \The human brain, eyes and ··hands are essential to research in space,\ Schmitt stated. Along. with the progression of better tech- . nology and equipment, Schmitt feels that the development of.de- . vices which afford the human senses the same accuracy they · have.on earth are key in the devel- opment of space exploration. of time.

Then the second stage rockets ignite for one seco11d which leads to a smooth ride. The space shuttle is traveling at 25,0()0 miles per hour and gradually s·lows down as they progress into space. \How much money did y{)u make'?\ was the second questicn. Schmitt laughed and replied, \Not much!\ He was considered a government employee and was Ia· beled \DS-14\ which meant thatlte received $14,000 a year. He re· minded the students that he did not ... continued from page 3 do it forthem<lneybut, for the ex- citement. The third question was about the food. Schmitt claimed that the food was good. It was dehydrated and freeze dried, s<J to eat it they had to add water. They had many typical foods such as eggs and fruit juice. They had meals ready to eat, known as MRE' s inthe anny, which are meals that are radiated so that the bacteria and genns are killed. They can be stored anywhere for many years. He mentioned that the sahnon salad was horrible. \For this rea- son, you see lots of it in the mu- seum stores tliat sell astronaut food,\ Schmitt joked. One student then asked about weightlessness. \Weightlessness is fun, but it takes a while for your body and brain to adjust. You need to take it easy for a few days to make sure that you do not get sick,\ Sclunitt replied. Schmitt closed by saying that being back on earth was difficult. It takes a few days for one's body to readjust because while in space the brain becomes lazy. Problems arise when trying to walk. At this time Schmitt realized that the lec- ture was coming to a close, but he wanted to say one more thing. Schmitt explained, ''Actually, many times an astronaut will drink something and then just let go of the glass because you can do that in space and the cup will stay there. That is obviously not the case on ...... t.\ ecuUt. News Piano Prodigy by Jessica Zuehlke Contributing Writer Most I 5-yeay-old sophomores in high school are on a playing ·field, spending time with friends or reading Mark Twain. Wei-Jen Yuan is one extraordinary teenager who spent most of his childhood on a piano bench. The child prodigy pianist he I~ an outstanding perfor- mance in Memorial Chapel on Sun- day October 25. The ch&pel was filled with many older members of the community but enly a .small number of stu- dents. The program began on an awkward note when the· introduc- tory speaker had a faulty micro- phone in which she tried to speak. She calmly laughed it off saying, . \When high technology does not work; we play it by ear!\ The speaker is a member of UCALL, Union College Academy for Life- long Learning. The concert was in celebration ofthe group's ten year anniversary. FerozaLaBonne, Yuan's music teacher for the past six and a half years said a few words to the audi- ence before the start of the perfor- mance. She credited Yuan''s frrst piano teacher and the comniupity for its support. She was \honored to have inspired the ymmg man to reach new heights\ within his tal- ent. The melodious sounds from the gr~nd piano swept through the toom as Yaun played his frrst piece, Sonata in D major, L 164 composed by Dominico Scarlatti. The prodigy played the softer parts with a delicate touch which con.:. trasted beautifully with his strong, full-bodied chords. The Toccata in E minor BMV 9 i 4 by Bach was his next performance. This combi- nation of various styles of music contained melancholic chord gressions and excellent transitions from piano(soft) to forte (loud). Beethoven's SonataOp. 53 inC major ·' 1 Waldstein\ was Yuan's most outstanding piece. His fm· g~rs moved up and down the key· board with beauty, grace, and speed. The frrst part of the piece, the Allegro, was a quick tempo and very dr(lmatic. E'very note was played through amazing arpeggios without any resting phases. The Adagio,. the second section,. em- bodied deep, powerful chords ex- ecuted elegantly :by Yuan. The song finished with an amazing compilation. of major and minor chords that illustrated Yuan's in- credible talent. According to one of the viewers, \The first two songs warmed Yuan up for this last piece. It was qaite. remarkable.\ After the intermission, Yuan played three more harmonious pieces; selections from Brahams, Debussy and Liszt. The first com- bined sounds of impassioned ani· mation with' gentleness. Yuan's work with Debussy proved to be phenomenal The piece was stY- listic of the Far East and took great skill to perfect, a skill Yuan has mastered. The fmale from the child wonder included three pieces by Franz Liszt. Yuan played with pas- sion and eloquence. His talented fingers performed magic on the keys. One audience member raved of Yuan's petfotrnance, \He is a fabu- · lous technician [in the art of the piano]. His virtuosity was spec- tacular as he· moved his hands up and down the keyboard~ It is rare [and exciting] to see such a young talent and to know he is locally situ- ated.\ · · Ymm has been accepted into the Juilliard School Pre-college Piano Division, wh'ich he will be attend- ing next year. ~.,..,..,.....---+no~~...., Paul D'Annibale/TC Wei-Jen Yuan enchants the audience with his ability .

Many other stu- dents and faculty were invited, but few came. The members hope thatnexttime an event like this is planned that more students will get involved. Wells House is a student-run theme house that focuses on per- forming voluntary services to the corruri.unity inside and outside of campus. So far this term Wells House has taken part in the AIDS walk in Albany; helped build and worked at the D.A.R.E haunted house in Central Park, and walked in the Nott Marathon. Most of the members volunteer on an individual basis as well as with the group, including Zoller One-on-One, Big Brothers-Big Sis- ters; volunteering at St. John's El- ementary School, and volunteering at Ellis Hospital. c - ] 28 .

The party will beg;in at 8:00PM and will feature a vari- ety of Spanish music, contests, specialty drinks; a tacc salad buf- fet, quesadillas, and a c()uple of al- ternatives in addition to their daily menu. The Mexican celebration (Octo• ber 31-Novernber 2) iUllstratesthe mixture ofcultures in Mexico as it combines the attitudes ofthe Eu- ropean medieval church witll the beliefs of the Aztecs. Ironically, the holiday is a cel- ebration oflife, not death. It is cus- tomary to create miniature alters dedicated to an individual; in this offering, death is depicted in nu- merous activities associated with daily life. \Dia de los Muertos~> is an event which society enjoys. Families visit cemeteries to decorate the graves of deceased· family mem- bers, friends, and publie figures with flowers, candies,. and even toys for deceased children. The Spanish Club hopes that this celebration will gjve students the chance to enjoy a Mexican tra- dition as well as maintain the fes- tive spir~t of Halloween created by our culture. Junior Lesli Heffler believes that the party is a great opportunity to experience another culture's cel- ebration, along with great food, different mllsic, and also to de- velop an appreciation for another culture. Manager Jim Dunn is very en- thusiastic and eager to hold this event. He believes that this is a fantastic event for students to take . part in and would be glad to bring this 'fiesta' totheRathskellar. The Spanish Club understands that October 31 is a festive evening; however, all are urged to stop by and see how another culture cel- ebrates.

Paludi attained those signatures and then decided to be labeled as a liberal candidate as well, which meant that she again had to get signatures. She was suc- cessful, which indicates that she is a liberal candidate. Paludi directed her speech to- ward her message and platform at this p()int. She noted that the classes she has taught and the life experiences that she has had led her to these issues. She knows much about them and supports them because she feels thatthey are, indeed, problems that occur. The first is to stren~then child abuse, domestic vi9lence and. Interne~ pornography laws. The secQnd part of the platfonn deals with educational issues. where she is against raising tuition for college students .and supports incorporat- ing teaching modules that will pro- mote children to seek solutions that are not violent when they solve problems.

World News <!Innto.dti.em.•-is-• Octcber 29,. 1998 ' Page 9 A STUDY IN POLITICAL MACHINES, LOCAL AND STATE WIDE byDan Kirsch Staff' Writer Political machines have been around since at least the early nh1eteenth century in the UnitedStates, and are usually nm at the state and local leveL In fact, Democratic machines were 111ost prevalent in cities such as Chi- cago, New York,. and even Albany. Republi- can machines were typically the party th&t ran the states, especially New York State. Albany was run by such a Democratic machine for over fifty years, and some ar-· glle tl1at it still exists today, without .its two- man leadership. It was run by Demo~ratic party Chairman Dan O'Connell and 4 1-ye<~r Mayor Erastus Corning I r. These two men were looked upon by outsiders as two of the most corrupt men in the nation, whHe Albany residents lool~ed at them as saints. They provided income for the poor by giv- ing them no-show custodialjobs in City Hall or gardening jobs in Washiagton Park. Wei fare ii1 those days was hard to come by, so n1achine loyalists usually wouldn't blink when they saw the dozens of janitors appar- ently needed per :tloor to clean the floors and scrub the toilets in downtown Albany. Buying votes wasn't a polemic on campaign financing practices, it was a fact oflife: $5 a vote a few days before or the day of the election. Corning, once asked during a probe into the machine's contracting practices, said that he didn't see anything wrong with do- ing business with friends. Apparently the mayor-for-life forgot the law that forbid lo- _ cal government officials from taking any- thing but the lowest bidder in any kind of wort< for the city. Gatnbling was allowed, as lo11g as you kept Hedrick ·s Beer (the O'Connell family brand) on tap. But orga- nized crime was never allowed. Chairman O,Connell wouM never altow his subjects to be victimized like that. Albany was his kingdom, nottheMafta's. An important aspect oft he machine is how it originally got city voters to be subjects of theO\Connell empire. A party apparatchik would stop by to introduce himself to a new resident, and would mention that the prop- . erty tax assessment foi· his house was astro- r j. Wings - nomical, but could be taken car(,! of if the new resident could please vote Democrat in November. New immigrant families were es- pecially intimidated by this, and of course would do whatever the party hack asked. They had no idea it was just as easy to go down to City Hull and get it I<Jwered your- self. T-he myth was that if yo.n were aRe- pu.bi:ican, your taxes went up, the street in front of your house wasn't pl~wed, and you would never fitld a job if you ever lost it. A Republican politician new to the city dis- proved this by chasing said DeJl1ocrat party hack out of his bouse and going down to City Hall; and getting the assessment low- ered jl.imself. However, the dC.wvn side of these universally .low residential taxes was the skyrocketjng ofbusiness pmperty taxes, ,businesses which slowly left Albany over O'Connell's fifty-six-year reign. Since 1921~ Chairman ''Uncle Dan\ O'Connell and his family had been inpower, • • j and the Republkaa party in Al,bqny had beena joke. lt wasn't untfl 1973 that his power began to w.ane~ along with his health. He died in 1977, and tl1e party and the city would never be the same, even m'ide:r Erastus Corning,. who would I ive to 1983. Albany is now still under .fit:rn Democratic control, although some would arguethat the entire Capital Region, as well as all ofup- state New York is controlled by the Repub- lican party chairman, Bill Powers. This is foolishness, as none ofthe illegalpractices mentioned above are even considered any- more. One cannot deny the finn gl'ip, though, that Mr. Powers and Mr. D' Am.<Jto have on the po lit leal structure of t~1e state.

A recent survey conducted by a group of high school guidance counselors in 1995, concluded that fifty percent of incoming students today rest their college decision on the basis of its appearance. Union College is undoubtedly one of the more attractive of small, liberal arts schools in the northeast. However, one element of the Union \package deal\ that detracts from its overall aestlletic is rather obvious: Schenectady itself. For all the beauty that administration and alumni put into making this campus a viable, visually pleasing environment, it is apparent that they can do tittle to change the surrounding area and town. However, now it appears as if we are attempting to do justthat. Last Tuesday, October 27, President Roger Hull and Mayor Jurczynski announced Union's plan to \revitalize the neighborhood in that area of , , campus defmed by Seward Place as well as Union and Nott Streets.\ Although on the surface this ~ffort may seem mutually beneficial for both Union College and Schenectady residents, a deeper look pf()ves that we are simply pushing the community further and further away · from us rather than truly integrating ourselves for change and revital- ization. This recent effort at creating bonds with the surrounding neighbot·· hood seems a bit superficial. How does relocating residents to areas further away from the campus help us work with the community? By placing \historic lighting\ and \beautiful cobblestone pathways\ throughout the Seward, Union and Nott area, the boundaries of Union Co liege are simply expanding outward. In reconstructing the surround- ing area's aesthetic, Union is pushing its own upper middle-class influ- ence into less fortunate areas oftown. In order to entice \non .. permanent\ residents to relocate, the admin- istration has offered rewards of scholarships and relocation funds. It would seem that these lavish offers would be difficult to refuse. It is from an arrogant standpoint that the administration offers monetary alleviation of Union tuition fees to these Schenectady residents in re- turn for their migration away from the campus. What sort of message does it send to rewarcl people for the purposes of attending the very college that is asking them to move away? Although efforts may have had altruistic intentions, an underlying sense of superiority is being put forth on the part of the administratio11.

OP/ED Opinions For All Christians: (Part One of Two) by W.A.S. \The Wiseman\ Staff Writer For aH Christians, the church is the focal point of their faith. It is in this setting where worship to the higher Deity of God is facilitated. Without the church, their would be no opportunity for people who recognize and embrace the Lord as their savior and creator to gather together, extol praises to His holy name, share in His infinite bless- ings, and accentuate His awesome love and devotion to his people. And thus without the church there would be no propensity for people's faiths to grow and evolve to the level of fulfillment in which dire plight in which I perceive the Church to be ensnared. N<>w, my purpose in writin~ this is not to predict aa inevitable doom and gloom for the Church ofChrist. On the contrary, my motives are driven by my fervent desire to see to it that the Church is restored to her original grace, elegaBce, and splendor. She has drifted from the paradigm designed by Christ and implemented by Peter and his col- leagues. While she has never claimed to be an impeccable instjtuti<Jn, as demonstrated by the maiicious co- ercion of the Inquisition, the :frag- mentation of Church solidarity and the Church herself during 1he melt- down of the Medieval e~a. she has ever he deems to be pertinent, ir· respective of what the scripttues declare are important. So he 111ay deviate entirely from the essence of the word of God and imrne:rse the congregation into seculart()p· ics, which would be a sign eflur- esy in the days when the Chll1ch stuck with its tradition. Now, this might be seen as ac- ceptable if the topic was wo'len in with scripture to teach a -valu- able lesson about the adherence to scripture, but typically the intro- duction of secular topics is done in an attempt to shrewdly pr()ntote secular tllemes that are adverse to the Church. When blasphemy be- comes tolerated, condoned, and even celebrated as a means of ad- contentment and salvation are at- always remained steadfastly loyal tained. to Christ and His virtues. Now, vancing the Church into the Illode of contemporary society, you ought to know that we have a se· vere crisis on hand. The church is therefore funda- mental for all pious Christians-it is the rock upon which their faith is built and it is imperative for them to protect and safeguard this. But the dilemma is that in today's contemporary world, the church has deteriorated and depreciated itself, precipitating primarily from a lack of solemnity, commitment, and spiritual exercise and applica- tion amongst its communicants. Before 1 continue, it first must be emphasized that this Church is not to be construed as a heavenly shrine. It is instead the shrine that was erected by man. Although it was a command of Jesus Christ in which his teachings and inspira- tion were the framework of this enterprise, man was ultimately given the discretion to decide how to best establish this church from whence Christianity would be nur- tured and cultivated for the enjoy- ment of all humanity. however, that loyalty seems to be dissolving, as man's selfishness, arrogance, complacency, andpride are filtering out the full pote:ncy of the Lord's radiance. Thus the soul lacks nourishment and strengtil, and slowly but surely drifts away from allegiance to God and his. prin- ciples, favoring instead the abyss of cynicism, disbelief, and apathy, which inexorably leads to spiritual starvation and demise. So what strategy do I recommend for the redemption of my Church? The solution, I believe, must begin with the celebration of the mass. In this forum, the congregation is to be sanctified in both the words and actions of the Lord. When the sa- cred texts of the Bible are dis- pensed, they should be deeply ab- sorbed into the soul. All too often they are ignored or To illustrate this more clearly, one only needs examine the V'Vay in which many Church lea(J.ers have begun to deal with the nor· ally controversial issues sucl:l as homosexuality.

His article was about the reality of rape, something that many people brush off, ignore, or, even worse, laugh about. I have heard more jokes about rape this tenn than I have in my four years of high school. Rape is an ugly word. Here, it seems to have no definition.

Perspectives at the Nott are Changing the Path of History ANew Brain by Lisa Blaustein Staff Writer Did you know that visiting mu- seums is the second most popular thing to do while on vacation? (Of course shopping is first!) On Oc- tober 20 at the Nott Spencer Crew, the director of the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of American History in Washington, DC, explained to all of us that mu- seums have changed drastically over the years to focus more on the interests of the visitors. Crew declared that one of the main tasks of museums is to provide visitors with the opportunity to learn new ·information and to engage in the sharing of ideas. In other words, museums are much different now than when we were kids and attract people who are not necessarily lovers of his- tory. He explained that in the past museums were more interested in retelling as much history as pos- sible rather than fmding inventive ways to attract visitors- to new ideas. \H us with a ~olid defmition as to who we are, what we have accomplished, and how we are all woven iJl.,the fabric of our country.\ He 1()}d us that museums are keepers of the past and attempt to provide an unbi- ased view ofhistory. With theaudiencesbeing diverse and millions of people walking in the museum doors witn different memoriesand perspectives, muse- ums have to be careful not to of- fend anyone. By dealing with memory and di- versity at a very per.;o!lal and very cautious level, Crew md his staff are able to offer people a better un- derstanding of a hist()ry that re- lates to them in differe11t angles of perspective.

A Metamorphosis Occurs at Union Union College students diligently working on the set of Metamorphosis ... Union College's theatre production this fall. Come see the play this weekend/ by Colleen Brown A&E Editor By the time you read this article, Union's fall performance of Meta~ morphosis, would have already opened. In fact, it opened on Wednesday. Oh, you missed it? Don'tworry. Luckily foryouthere are seven more opportunities to be amazed by the talent that this school has. The play will run from October 28-31 and November 4-8. If you are a student here, a five dollar ticket to see live theater is in my opinion, the deal of the century. You can't even go to a movie for that. Cast members such as Josh Taub, Devon Ciampa, Ari Gottlieb, and Maura Wittbold have spent many hours at the Yulman Theater defm· ing their characters. Taub will be playing the part of Gregor Samsa, who's characterfmds himself thor- oughly transformed into a bug overnight. From all of the beetle and bug theme posters around campus, I bet you could have guessed that much .. Gregor Samsa's parents are played by Gottlieb and Ciampaj while Wittbold takes the youthful approach as Greta Samsa,.Gregor's little sister. For those of you who read my article last week, yo11 know Eric Witsozky has a double part in this production. Not only does he play a-very powerful Chief Clerk, he is also Director William Finlay's as- sistant director. The three lodgers, Amanda Diamondstein, Liam Joynt, and Erin Zaticki, have perfected the art of being grotesque. One would think that it might be mean to de- scribe them as swine,.butcome see· for yourself. They are doing a wonderfuljo b. I would also like to give some recognitionto others who have put a lot of effort into this play. First of all to my two assistaJtt stage man- agers, Ellen O'Clair and Jacob Valeri: their w_ork is very much.ap- preciated. As stage manager, these two have made my job a million times more enjoyable. Also, Deric Harrington, who is ()Uf sound co- ordinator/musician for the show. I urge you all to se:e th.is tcnns production of Steven Berkoffs Metamorphosis. Sh()W dates are October 28-31 andN()vember4-8. Please come and support Union's theater department while you allow yourself the pleasure of enjoying a fabulous play performed by your friends and fellow Union stu- dents!!!

Movie Review: Pleasantville by Katie Aspnes Contributing Writer Sometimes just going to a movie and esca,pillg the nightmares of studying and dorm rooms is the perfect panacea. There are times when nothing seems more enjoy- able than paying an outrageou.s amount for popcorn and soda while sitting in sticky chairs at a hot movie theatre. I'm not paintirig a pretty picture but I will say that e:ver since I was little my favorite form of escape from reality was a movie. You just can't beat climb- ing inside the head a perfect (or far from perfect) character for two hours and living an entirely unre- alistic life. Pleasantville is the ideal movie for this sort of escape. It's incred- il)ly unrealistic, yet also so entic- ing that you fmd yourself enam- ored by the antirealism. This is a story about a brother and sister growing up in present day Los Angeles. Reese Witherspoon plays Jennife! and 1;'obey Maguire, herbrother. They find themselves tran:s- portedbackin time to a 'SO's type TV show called Pleasantville, The two teens force the town to chal- lenge what have been their ac- cepted ideals and to question the beliefs of their perfectly pleasant universe. These two '90's kids bring into Pleasantville, sex ( obvi- ously), but also art, books and in- dependence. Towards the endofthemovie, it becomes randomly political touch- ing on the civil rights movement and freedom ofspeech. Although that seems a bit overly sentimental and politically C()trect the movie still pulls itoff. With Witherspoon as tile heroine juxtaposed with the pe1tect '50;s mother, women will find themselves quite precocious an<i unconventionaL Maguire's ch.aracter is supposed to be nerdy an<i a bit of a lost soul. Here is where the sentimentality overexerts itself. His character is lo-vable but a bit too extreme in his lessons and prin<:iples. Overall, this movie is worth it. Do11't wait until it is out on video. The stunning effects <Jf a black and white town that slovrly becomes c<>lored should not be saved for a television set.

Director Christopher Welch, a Union College junior theater ma- . jor, alo11g with a talented and dedi .. cated: cast comprised of wit and charm, presented Pinter's 1965 clas- sic The Homecoming. Pintea:'s plays have a reputation of bein!J; obtuse and cryptic, yet Welch's grasp of the mood and at- m()sphe:re of the piece is marvel- ou.s. His choices complemented Pinter's textwonderfullyand cap- tured 1h:e essence of Pinter's bi- zarre 'liew of life. The decision to stage tlte show in a unique \hy- brid\ <>ftheater in the round was a bold cme, yet it aU owed him to play with different sight line perspec- tives. No ()lle in the audience saw the same Jlerformance, and it proved · to be very effective. The sparse set C()nveyed the sense of desolation and intr'igue present in much of Pinter~.s work. Fine perfonnances we to be had . by alL What many in the audience were perhaps unaware of is the in- crediblespecificity in Pinter's text. His wol'k.often reads like music, with bre<1tlls and pauses inserted in very elCact places. The fi(>mecoming actually holds the record for pauses, numbering an astounding 240 totaL Needless to say, this kind of precision is dif- ficult for actors, yet Welch's cast handled in wonderfully. The story centers around Max, a crotchety and brutal retired butcher, played by Heath Heilpern. Heilpem's instincts are great, and he handles this compli- cated character with style and grace. In his house lives two of his sons, Lenny and)oey, and his brother Sam. They are visited by Max's third son, Teddy, and his wife~ This sort of dysfunctional fam- ily homecoming is the setting for this play. Without recounting the entire story for all of you, some other individual performance notes are necessary. To begin ... freshman Greg Fox's Lenny was wonderfully biting and duplicitous, and freshman Ian Elitz's Joey was hysterical, a per- fect fusion of dim-witted humor and genuine ignorance. Rounding out the family is Teddy, played by sophomore Spencer Christie, and Ruth, por- trayed by freshman Liz Kidder. Christie effectively conveys Teddy's feelings of anxiety and dread about his homecoming. This was no better defmed than in the stunning moment of Act I where he discovers his brother Lenny in the living room, the stage lit only by two solitary candles. Kidder's Ryth was a stunning combination of intelligence and predatory sensuality, and Samuel Cousins depiction of Sam, Max's brother, was convincing with its' deep threads of resentment and bitterness. Director Chris Welch, his cast and his crew, are to be commended on their splendid effort. I was thoroughly impressed with the performance and efforts of these talented Union College the- ater students I hope that all of you had the opportunity this weekend to enjoy this production as much as [did.

- Skating Dutchmen: \I Love .Your Style\ Union Hockey opens season with a split at the JC Penney Classic in Maine by Jonathan Gasthalter Ediotr-in-Chief Emeritus First-year Head Coach Kevin Sneddon wanted nothing more for the 1998-99 Skating Dutchmen than a win over their first opponent. Sneddon and his team got that win in the opening game of the JC Penny Classic hosted by the Uni• versity of Maine. Union faced.off against Division I newcomer Niagara, a team that had beaten the University of Michigan the previous weekend. \'We've heard a lot about [Niagara],\ saicl junior defenseman JeffSproat. \We just carne out and played tough and beat them.\ The Dutchmen, with senior goaltender Leeor Shtrom between the pipes, dr~w first blood. After being held without ~ shot on goal forth e first eight minutes of the first period, senior assistant captain BrentOzarowski netted the game's first goal with Union on the power- play late in the first period of play. Niagara evened the score with se- nior Ryan Boyd in the penalty box for the Dutchmen as forward Chris MacKenzie beat Shtrom with are- bound. The game would stay locked at 1-1 until early in the third period when Dutchmen sophomore Bryan Yackel beat Niagara goaltender Greg Gardner on a backhand shot from the comer of the crease, put- ting Union up 2-1. Less then three minutes later, senior captain Mark Szucs began what would be the start of a two goal, three-point night for the forward, and a solid win for the Dutchmen team. Szucs ,put Union up 3-1 as he followed fresh- man defenseman · Do.u;g Christiansen's shot to the net> dumping it past Gardner.

Niagara, opting for the extra attacker, pulled gol!ltender Gardner from the crease, allowing freshman Jeff Wilson to score the frrst goal ofhis collegiate career and end the scoring for the Dutchmen, giving the team a 5-3 win. Goach Sneddon was excited for the t~am and happy to get his fust their first win. \Szucs used his speed, he had a great game ali night. [Shtrom]was outstanding. He kept us in there, especially in the second period,\ he said. The win catapulted the Dutch- men into the tournament champi- onship against the University of Maine on Saturday night. The Dutchmen team, hurt by twenty-eight minutes of penalties, dropped the game 6-1. The Bears were able to light the lamp three times in the frrstperiod, each time on th~ power.play, to put Union down 3-0 to start the second pe- riod. Maine scored again midway thr()ugh the seco.nd peri()d, again omthe powerpl~y.

Union RuggerS Conclude Season by William Johnson Contributing Writer The fall season for the Union men's rugby team concluded this Saturday. The squad, fighting for their second win of the fall, traveled to Sienna College to play the playoff-contending Sienna rugby squad. Needing to win the match by a total of 4 I points to qualify for tbe playoffs, Sienna was out for blood. And they showed it early, pushing hard with their pack and relying on strong hands intheirline to control the early field position. Several minutes into the match, a three on one overload to the weak side gave Sienna enough of an advantage to sprint down the sidelines and score the frrst try of the match. Trailing 5-0 early, Union quickly began to realize they needed to increase the intensity. The pack began to push with tremendous ferocity, led by frrst rows Big Pete Casola, Billy Servant, and Chris Vietor. The line began to rely on quick hands and fast feet t!> consistently push the ball into Sienna's end of the field. Fly half Fred \Dr. Smooth\ Gibney led the line, combining graceful fakes and punishing runs to gain valuable yardage. Possession from lineouts was automatic with 6'7\ Adam Deutsche leaping for Union. Toward the end of the half, however, another breakaway by Sienna gave them excellent field position. Despite some strong goal~ line defense, spearheaded by the pack, Sienna managed to break through for their second try ofthe afternoon. Down 1 0·0 right before the half, Union remained determined. Several quick phases by the pack pushed the ball upfield, and reliable hands from the line managed to get the ball into the hands of speedracer Nemo Bolin. As he turned the comer, the most Sienna d..!fenders could see was tile number 20 on Bolin's back; as he outraced one and all to the try zone. Bolin's try, his second in two games, put Union on the board right before the half. Tim Lane's conversion kick, which sailed through the uprights and across the road, made the score 10-7. Injuries, unfortunately, were also painful for Union. Flanker Dan Rickson had to leave early with a pinched nerve, and inside center John Tower left after getting kneed in tile head. Mark Goloboy and Ami Blumenthal were able to fill in nicely for Union, Se'Veral substitutions were made for the secOnd half. Mike Webert was brought in at flanker to help the defense, and Mike Pingpank relieved Vietor atprop. With a fresh squad ready to tackle Sienna, the second half began with great intensity. Andthe second half was even early, both teams fighting fiercely for every inch. Union's rugged defense was led by eightman Steve Flaherty and Gibney, who held Sienna in check early on. Soon, though, several gaps opened up, and Sienna managed to score its third try, making the score 15-7. Not long after, Siennamanagedto overload the weak side again and tack on another try, making the score 20-7. Despite the score, and the burden of running uphill on the noticeably slanted field, Union mounted several strong pushes into Sienna's territory. Jeremy Messler, in only his second game, outraced much of the Sienna defense on two consecutive runs to set up fantastic field position for Union. Several short runs set up a lineout from ten meters out. Deutsche caught the lineout, and proceeded to initiate a rolling maul. Pingpank and Casola helped to move the piie uphiU, and when the dust had settled, Casola was lying on the ball in the try zone. His frrst try ever, Casola fought not only Sienna but gravity as well toinake the score 20-12, which was how it ended. The Killer B's were out for revengej though, and they started out early. Good skills by the line. got the ball out to speedy Joe McQuade, who employed simple straight-ahead ruilning mixed with SOJTie good old-fashioned power. His excellent run left a trail of fallen Sienna defenders leading right to tile try zone, where McQuade celebrated his frrst ever try, putting Union on top early, 5-0. After the early score, it was tlme for the defense to take charge. With newcomer Ryan Martinson, am! Dave Martin leading the charge with consistently brutal tacl<les, Sienna's offense was continually stymied. And as the first half ended, Union remained on top, 5-0. The second half saw more ofthe Killer B's ferocity. The defense remained tight, aided by several nice open field tackles by Harvey Shepard. Offensively, Servant and McQuade Jed the team upfield with se'Veral nice runs, leading to a maul five meters from the goalline. Serum half Will Johnson uncorked one of his few nice passes of the day to flyhalfMike Nigro, who completed the. Seneca Co11nty connection, dashing into the try zone, making tbe score I 0-0. Later in the ltalf, assisted by t()ugh runs by flanker Mike Webert and wing Matt Moddemo, Union again found themselves on the goaUine.

Union completed its regular season 13-1- 1, and 6-0 in the UCAA, and went undefeated in their last 12 games. After completing their regular sea- son games this past week, Union has officially finished the season ranked number two, right behind Willliam-Smith, in the state ofNew York and 16th in the entire nation. The Union women's soccer team probably had one of their best sea- sons ever in their 17-yearhistory. Just to make a note of some of the records broken this season, sophomore Missy Matusewicz tied the school's record with a to- Dave Meguerdich.ian/TC annon Powers only madt 2 saves, as Union out-shot Russell Sage 18- 3. During Saturday's game against New Paltz, freshman Stephanie Maychack scored her first goals of the season. Also adding to the score was Margaret Kostro and Autumn Renn in the 4-0 rout of New Paltz. \We ended the season on a great note.

Kim Fanning, who gradu- ated in 1996, finished her career here at Union with 24, but Matusewicz only in her second year, will most likely break this school's record in her next two years of play.

He attended the local Bishop Gibbons High School, where he grad1:1ated in 1968. He then moved on to Union Col'lege and earned a degree in Psychol- ogy in 1972. He continued his edu- cation at the College of Saint Rose where he earned a graduate degree in Special Education. H~ then re- turned to Bishop Gibbons High School where he taught and coached for over ten years and lastly, he has represented the greater Schenectady County for the past sixteen years. This man has dedicated his life to Schenectady, and for this he de- serves to continue his leadership. I am talking about state Assem- blyman James Tedisco, one of the most proficient basketball players ever to play here at Union College, and one of the most successful State Assemblyman ever to set foot on the Assembly floor at the state house in Albany. Whether he has been guiding the shooting Dutchmen on tile court or advis- ing and teaching his constituents, Assemblyman Tedisco has always put others interests in front of his own in order to achieve as much success as possible. Assemblyman Tedisco at- tributes his success to what Union College did for him. As he states, \The athletics and academics that I encountered at Union affected my view on public service and helped develop the role I have taken.\ In speaking about Uni()n, the Assemblyman said, \Athletes do not get a brea:k simply because they we athletes. Not only are ath- letes expected to endure endless hours of practice and competition, but they are expected to attend all classes and complete their work just as any non-atllleteis expected to do.\. It is this notion that leads I ' . . .. .

Playing along with him was Bill Carmody, the current head coach at Princeton University. The success and skill that Tedisco displayed on the court, along with his years of public ser- vice led to the reception of two esteemed athletic awards given to ath- letes 25 years after their col- .•. lege gradua- .· tion. The first • award is the ' · \Silver Anni- award;\ an : · award given to collegiate stars who have \en- joyed promi- nent careers in journalism, business, poli- tics, and medi- cine. This award encom- passes all ath- letes in every sport, not just basketball, and includes ath- letes from both Division III ers to begin his cwn campaign for the Assembly seat. As he said, \An extension ofhelping other can- didates is t() be<:ome a candidate semblyman Tedisco has proposed some eye-opening legislation. Currently, approximately 1000 bills come to the Assembly floor every on time. yourself.\ Tediscobelieves that of- year. However, of those 1,000 bills, ten there are ele-cted c:lfficials who only about 200 are passed into law. While Union College gave so much to Assemblyman Tedisco, he in turn has given back equally as much both to the College and to the Schenectady County schools. Assemblyman Tedisco and his staff make weekly trips to the sur- rounding Schenectady County schools. He and his staff go into classrooms weekly and talk to the students about government; they sponsor field trips to the state house in Albany to allow children to see how New York State gov- ernment works; and most impor- tantly, he has helped develop a curriculum that helps to educate children aboutchild abduction and are not necessarily reJJresentatives to their constituency,,. but rather a representative for themselves. This is the premise on Vlhich Tedisco based his campaign: he would be a Tedisco believes that this percent- age could be a lot higher. Often some of the most important legis- lation gets stuck in various com- mittees and never comes to the As- ,---..., sembly floor for dis- cussion. The bill · that Assemblyman Tedisco has submit- . ted, however, states . that each year, ev- ery Assemblyman will choose their one most ilnportant piece of legislation and they will be guaranteed that it comes to the flood. They are not guar- anteed that it will pass into law, but every Assembly- man will at least how to avoid it. In tenns of Union, Tedisco has maintained his connection in anum- ber of ways. At his local office, he employs Union students as interns. He also returns frequently to speak in classes, and always finds a few moments to shoot around with the basketball team and teach at Union basketball clinics.

Sa<turday, The Fighting Dutchmen closed out their home seas()n by winning their second game ill a t:ow, convincingly defeat- ing the Coast Guard Academy 41- 7. This 'Was the first year Union. beat Coa.st Guard at home since 1992, and the bi11terness ofthe loss to CoastGuard two years ago that kept tbem from tbe NCAA play- offs stilllillgered amongst the play- ers. Union's offense was able to rack 11p 434 yards and the defense again pr()ved their dominance in the UCAA, holding Coast Guard to 185-yards, and only seven rush- ing yards. The ()ffense was led by the freshmen backfield of quarterback Ben GillJert, tailback Jasper MiHs, an.d fullback Matt Laporta, who combined for 346 yards and all five touchdllwns. The other six points were also scored by freshmen, as Steve Morat connected on a 24- yard field goal, and Andrew Ruffo connected on a27-yard field goal. Coast Guard started the game by winning the coin toss and ac- cepted toreceivethe kickoff. Coast Guard started the game with what would l>e their longest play from scrimmage as DaveY adrick hit Tom Wallendllwn the middle for a 36- yard pass. Howe-ver, the defense came up strong a:fter Jim Kochan stopped Yadrick for a zero-yard gain, and on the tie:xt play, John Visconti forced Yadrickoutofbounds fora two-y~ud gain. Aftera Coast Guard punt, Union took oven>n their own 28-yard line and Gilbert came out throwing, hit- ting Dav-e Robbins for a 29-yard pass play. Coach John Audino said before tile game, \Matt Laporta is a great mn11er. We're going to try to get hila lite ball m()re this game.\ Sure eflOilgh, on the next play~ Gil- bert handed off to classmate Laporta \bo barreled his way 43 yards <io:.wn the field for Union's frrst touchd<Jwp. With just over two mi111.1tes into the game, Union led 7..(). CoastGuard went three and out on their ~text drive and after a high snap, a11d pressure by Union, C(}ast G11ard was for-ced to run it, but didn't get very far as Joe Attanasio brought Tim Keyser to the turf for a 14-yard loss. Union took over on Coast Guard's 11-yrud line, and Gilbert handed off to Mills who ran for an 11-yard touchdown, giving the Dutchmen a 14-0 lead, after only three offensive plays. Facing a third and six on Union's 37-yard line, Kochan penetrated the line and saclced Yadrick for an eight-yard }@ss, forcing Coast Guard to punt. The second quar- ter began with Union on their own 26-yard line. Gilbert stepped back to pass, and hit Brian O'Donnell ()n the right sideline, who then outran his defender for a 73- yard touchdown re- ception, giving Union a 21-0 lead with 14:4lleftinthe half. Two series later, Coast Guard was again forced to punt, but Devon Wimberly got to the ball fist and blocked the punt, his six:th of the season. On Union's next drive, the offense took over on Coast Guard's27-yard · and Mills ended the drive with a yard touchdown . run, giving Unio11 a · 28-0 lead with 6:15 second half. Although Union would be forced to punt on their next drive, Brian S !ekes would get off a 63-yard punt that landed on the one-yard line. With Coast Guard pinned on tlleir own one- yard line, Union's defease came up big, forcing Coast Guard to punt from their own one-yard line. Keyser got off a 30-yard punt, but Dan Hamister returned it 12-yards and the offense took over on Coast Guard's 19-yard line. Eight seconds later, Gilbert connected with Dan. Bamford for a 19-yard touchdown pass, giving the DutchiTlen a 38-7 a Kopka interception. Union settled for a 27-yard field goal by Ruffo, an.d Union led4l-7 with 7:14 left in the game. The score would stay this way and Union ran down the clock, ending the game with a 41-7 victory and improving their record to 4-2. Gi:lbert ended the day complet- ing 13 of I 7 pass attempts for 222- yards, two touchdowns, and two interceptions. Laporta Jed the rush- ing attack wi.th 75 yards and a touchdown and MiUs had 49 yards and two touchdowns. Defen- sively, Kochan led the team with five tackles, a fumble re- covery, and two sacks for 13-yards. Kochan was foHowed by tri-cap- tain Visconti who had four tackles, Chris Doraz with seven tackles, Dom Pittaniello with eight tackles, and Mike Rothenthal with five . tackles. \Ever since the two- • weeks off, the offense . has really been click- ing,\ said Ben Gilbert. Defensively, Kochan said, \It proves last week was not a fluke, it was a great win for the team.\ Speaking about his last game on Frank Bailey Field, he stated, \I was sad, but happy I was able to give some- thing to the school, but I will defmitely miss and I love this place more to go in the half.

Coach Audino said, \Time has been good to us. We are becom- ing an experienced offense; the· players now know what is expected of them. We have been control- ling the baU on offense and stop- prng the opponents offense on de- fense.\ Union ended the day by controlling the baH 3 7 minutes to 23 minutes. Union travels to Hartwick this week to face a 7-0 team that beat Rensselaer 26- I 3 last weekend. They are currently ranked fourth in the ECAC east region and a win against Hartwick will help the Dutchmen make it to the playoffs. Union is currently in second place in the UCAA behind Hobart, but could tie for first if Rensselaer beats Hobart in the last regular sea- son game on November 14. Union's playoffs bid are still very good, with a chance at the NCAA and UCAA tournaments still a possibility. Union's biggest problem is inju- ries. Right now, only two starting offensive lineman, Greg Williams and Pat Fortin, are healthy. The other three, E. C. Stumpf (left knee), Mike Visconti (left ankle) and Dave Barclay (right hand) are all ques- tionable for this weekend's game. Other offensive lineman, Dave Roselle will most likely miss the rest of the season after severely break- ing his left ankle and Ryan Windlespeck is questionable with a sprained left knee. Clearly the line is beat up, and the quarterbacks and runners will have to step up their game to beat a championship caliber team like Hartwick. \Hartwick brings the toughest defense since Hobart.
