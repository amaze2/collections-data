Vol .. CXIX,. No. 19 Schenectady, New York May 3, 1990 Presidential Candidate England Visits Union Hundreds Tum Out for· Open Forum Third in a series of articles coveting th11 seo:rch and selection of a new College President B1 R. REED WHIDDEN A flood of students, far outnumbering the seating capacity of the College Center Auditorium, headed for Memorial Chapel to meet presidential candidate Dr. James . W. England. At 11:30 a.m. this T11esday Dr. England came face to face with a variety of . student representatives. Almost 500 st11dents filled the Chapel and fired heavy and sincere questions at the candidate. Dr. England opened with brief _remarks regarding · his objec;.tive concerning Union College. England hopes \to be . part of the process that would produce a certain kind of human being.\ That certain human being wou}d be intellectually independent with a sense of their place and able to make important decisions. This same kind of person would have a sense, · understanding, and genuine caring for fellow human beings~ He touched on an issue that is running thro11gh campus today by furthet commenting that he would like t<> see Union producing individuals who are critics and activists. England believes that \the intellectual · · life and personal life must inform one another.\ He closed by stating that it is essential to \organize the efforts of the faculty and the administration to focus on that objective.\ Faculty had the same opportunity to meet with the candidate on Monday at 3:30 p.m. He offered a bit more detail on .his objective· at that time. England outlined the three majot challenges he sees in Union's failure: (1) the recruiting of quality students through a change in the institution and in the type of student recruited, (2) a focusing of resources, and (3) the recruitment of faculty. Essentially his remarks were the same in addressing the two bodies. Tim Satns began the questioning with one regarding England's views on multiculturalism. Sams also asked the candidate if he had any proposals for immediate change. Engla11d responded by stating that \there are no quick fixes\ to educational demands such as these, but he realizes there is a necessity for changes better suited to multi-cultural students withill. the curriculum. England cited the fact that at University of California, Berkeley, Anglo students made up only a thitd of this year's admission to that school, an obvio11s trend facing most schools these days. England then addressed a question concerning the issue of the women on this campus. En.gland was asked to give concrete exam}Jles of programs he would institute to upgrade the integration of women. His response to the quotation of .statistics such as 16% of tenured faculty are women and 25% of females have reported being sexually harassed by faculty members was that the solution is not to encourage this community as an anti- woman one. He noted Lhe difference between women as a continued on page 4 Trustees Approve $51 Million Budget The Board of Trustees approved a budget of $51,013,194 for the 1990-91 fiscal year.

Campus Put Under Quarantine By MATT l,ANNI Associate News Editor On Mon!h!y morning, April 30, students received an announcement !bat the campus will be under a quarantine due . to the outbreak of measles. The letter sent to students stated that the College is req11ired by law to \cancel all events on campus such as concerts, films, lectures, and athletic events at which members of the public~.. will be present, for at l~ast three weeks ... from the onset of the last diagnosed case of measles.\ As of Monday, April 30, there have been two co.nfirmed cases, according to Joseph Mammola, Dean of Students. There is also one student who seems to have · all the major symptoms but cannot be declared to have the disease until the results of a blood test are recei vcd. Mamo1<>la also reports two new casesofpossible sickness. When asked .if students were at the same risk of catching tile disease in the classroom as at social gatherings, Dean Mammolll responded by saying, \classes are essential,. and parties are not.\ According to Dean Mammola~ as soon as the first case of measles was diagnosed, tile College made plans to stop the further spread of the disease. Plms were drawn up at the beginning of the week of April 23 lUid on Friday, April continued on page 3 G.E. Offers Internship For Union Students Union College engineering and computer science students will have an opportunity to work in internships with the General Electric Co. under an agreement signed recently. The studellts will work in GE's Turbine Technology Department for almost six months-- a summer combined with either a fall or spring term-- at the beginning or end of their junior year, said Lawrence J. Hollander, Union's dean of engineering. The Semester in Industry program will start this summer, aud Hollander hopes at least 10 stt1dents will be involved each year. Besides computer science students, students in all three of Union's engineering degree programs will be eligible for the internships: mechanical, electrical and civil. Students who receive approval from their academic department heads to participate in the internship program will then apply to GE through the College's Career Development Center. · \This will give students good experience in the real world, and they'll see what the profession of engineering is all about,\ said Hollander.

CONCO~DIENSIS, May 3, 1990 <ttnttntrhirnsfs NEWS ANALYSIS Students Fl,ock To Environmental Jobs Courtesy of NSNS Environmental organiza- tions, especially grassroots groups such as the Public Interest Research Groups (PIRGs), Greenpeace and the Clean Water Action· Project, report record increases this year in both applications from and hiring of college students. Since 1988, Greenpeace has experienced an 18 percent increase in student job applicants and the Clean Water Action Project expects to hire 30 percent more graduates this year than last. \The process feeds on itself,\ says Tom St. Hilaire, staff director of the Clean Water Action Project. \When grassroots environment- al organizations win campaigns, the media covers. them,\ Hilaire says. The media coverage, in turn, leads \students to want to take part in these organizations. That helps the 0rganizations win more campaigns.\ Many of the large number of students applying to tile PIRGs, Grcenpeace and Clean Water Action seek positions on grassroots campaigns. Environ- mental groups. hire these students for part-time and summer work canvassiag neighborhoods to educate com- munities about environmental issues and to recruit new members. They hire ful:l-time college graduates to run these campaign offices. Environmental. organizations also hire recent graduates as campus organizers, administra- tive staff, writers and researchers. Cathie Currie, recruitment director of tile PIRGs, says she expects to hire approximately 300 graduating seniors this year for career positions in 18 states- an increase of 30 percent over last year. JE&: Z.l WE'VE BEEN SITTIN' HERE All DAY 1\~'NOT ONE STUDENT. THEY'RE A\...L 0\/E.R A.T THE. EN\JlRONME:NTAL. BOOTHS. ROTC Demands $25,000 Back From Gay Cadet By BILL DUFFY Courtesy of NSNS In one of the most controversial developments in the debate over the Department of Defense's policy against homosexuals, the Army Reserve Officer Training Corps is demanding that a gay cadet from Washington University in St. Louis return his four-year $25,000 ROTC scholarship. The Department of Defense states in its literature that, \homosexuals would seriously impair discipline, good order, morale and security.\ That policy prompted Washington university and ROTC grad11ate James Holobaugh to inform the U.S. Army that he is gay. Holobaugh, who was once featured in an ROTC advertising campaign, says that he did not realize his homosexuality until his junior year. He says that he finds the ban against gays and lesbians serving in the military \a disgusting policy.\ The Supreme Court recently let stand the Department <>f Defense's discriminatory .policy against gays, and lesbians. Lesbian and gay stu.dents at WU, angered by the military's policy and the attempt to recover the scholarship, are enlisting student and faculty support in their campaign against gender-preference discrimination and for Holobaugh. Holobaugh also has received support from members of Congress. Twenty-four have written a letter to Army officials in his defense. According to the letter, the case against Holobaugh shows \an appalling mean spiritedness which has no place in the ROTC.\ The campaign for Holobaugh is the most recent in a series of campus protests this year against ROTCs' discriminatory policy. In February, stu.dents at the University of Wisconsin at Madison protested a Board of Regents decision to continue affiliation with ROTC despite facult:y -opposition. Campaigns against ROTC also have roused students to action at the univerS;ities of California, Minnescta, and Iowa and at Harvard (MA), Yale (CT), and Northv.esteril (IL). · William Rubenstein, staff council for the American Civil Libertie:s Union's Lesbian and Gay Rights Project, says, \Places of higher learning are finding this policy ignorant. They ha.-ve flunked ROTC.\ Rick Villasenor, a former student at the University of Wisconsin active in the move111.ent against ROTC, findsa.11ational precedent in the Washington University case. \It's i111portant to note that what II11ppened to Holobaugh could l111ppen to anyone on any college campus,\ says Villasenor. \It is clear that the University cannot have a non- discrimination policy concerning sexual orientatien and have an ROTC prograp1 at the same time. They conflict.\ Faculty Research Deadline The Subcouncil on Research and Grants is now soliciting proposals for faculty research and scholarship activities. Applications and guidelines are available in Dean Butterstein's Office (S-1 00, S & E)~ The deadline for submission of proposals is Monday, May 7, 1990. Questions concerning the Faculty Research Fund should be directed to Dean Butterstein. When preparing budgets, please remember that per diem rates are normally limited to $50.00 per day. Transportation costs should also reflect the best rates available. If your research includes work with human subjects, then the proposal must have preliminary approval from the Human Subjects Research Committee before it can be funded by the Subcouncil on Research and Grants. WHY THE LITTLE lNGRA1ES THE.Y WOULt)N'T HA\IE ANY OlL SP1Ll'5 TO ClEAN UP \~ \T REN'r FOR US! Paul~ ©fflO N..SNS SPAA Celebrates Earth Day '90 · Last Friday, April 27th, S.P.A.A. (Students for Political Awareness and Action) celebrated the 20th anniversary ()f Earth Day outside of the College Center. r From ten o'clock to four • o'clock there' were various informational table~ run by the S.P.A.A. members, including a paper recycling demonstra- tion. Also, there was a peace dividend survey that allowed Union students and faculty to . give their opinions on where money from tile government that has been cut back from defense and military sbould be spent. At 12:30, President Morris led a tree planting ceremony near the ldol, at which Professor Heinegg read an excerpt from an environmentally aware work of literature. To end the day, The Jazz Icons played on the back terrace of the College Center. All in all, it was a very successful day, made possible through the hard work: of S.P.A.A. members and those who participated. Also, special thanks should go to Dean Mammola for his cooperation. Hopefully, our efforts have brought a new-found awareness to the campus, and will influence us to take· res- ponsibility for our Earth alld to do ail that we can to ensure its future. For anyone interested in joining SPAA. meetings are held every Monday at 7:3() p.m. in Room 205 in tbe College Center. . . ~-~~ \\' il \l'• i- ,. ~ <4 .z ~:: • .;.-. ~·+·4'~-o:t·~:r~<r ·' .,;:r. ii'·-T·..,.. ... \i> \\\~ 'Sro'!i- \\'?•-\\~ '\\'· .. ~ -41-1f\.•·-·\\·+~1f·~T'*~ • .,~!i\J.~~.-r~-: ....... ~.iJ:.:, ....... ,~ -:.~,_ -~ .. · +'-1.-..r. t If \:-t .. i<:~:!.·.J.r·~·-e. ,..-1··~ ~- .. ~~.!;:; 'fl·.~''\ .,'#.·A: .'1' ... •·-r·~ ;..\'~ ~4a~.\.?·..-;ll ~JI\n\\\e.,.;~.:z..~-..o.c.~J.i ..ov.~-:~·\\'t-41 ' lt e tl h ( ) F I l s a i.J - (j ... c: Cl '1: •• ( c: - ... ~ ... •• Jo .. • c ( a '1: ( ...

Those students whos(} health records showed that th~y were already immunized were immediately . issued an immunization card. · Those who needed an immunization shot were given one and then issued an immunization card. A total of 3,000 students and faculty went through this screening process. On Wednesday and Thursday, . May 1 and 2, students were required to present these immunization cards in order to be let into classes. Th.e quarantine of the College Ius caused the cancellation of ·major campus events; including the Psychedelic Furs concert, and Parents' Weekend. The College also advised all fraternities to cancel all social gatherings planned f.or the weekend of April27-29. In fact, the letter distributed to students informing them of the quarantine sa)'S that \it seems prudent to restrict large gatherings on the campus until clearance is received.\ When asked if students were at the same risk of catching the disease in the classroom as at social gatherings, Dean Mammola responded by saying, \Classes are :essential, and parties ate not.\ In response to the cancellation of major events, Mrs. Marra, coordillator of student activities, has been rescheduling new events.

He also emphasized an educative process. President of Student Forum, David Cohen was also present to ask questions concerning tl1e participation of the student government in decision and policy making as it effects tile students. England replied with his opinion that students should take part in tl1cir education; individual thought is important, but collective thinking is important. The living and learning situations on campus impressed England, as well. The inevitable questio11 of Greek organizations carne up when Andy Salem, IFC president, addressed the candidate. With a majority of Greeks in the audience and Salem's \one question with 17 parts,\ England took a quick seat on the stage to collect himself. Salem asked him about his knowledge of the history of Greeks at Unioa and his attitude toward Greeks. His return revolved around the point of anti-social behavior. He refuses to support any organization that promotes anti -social_ b'ebavibr ~ ... En.gland would support Greek organizations that retum to their founding principles, and are advocate of others, not just themselves. Regarding co- educational fmternities, Eng'- land would favor them· if they were the only way to stop anti- female attitudes.. England himself is not a Greek, but is familiar with them through Swarthmore. England answered other inquiries regarding Greeks, student activism, gay and lesbian sexual abase· policies, and the responsibility of faculty to students. He acknowledged the rights of all students, and encouraged activism. England defended the perfonna:nc,e of faculty in :the classroom and reasoned that research done with the help of students is all excellent form of education, and an excellent way to bring together these two facets of the profession. This issue was also raised at the forum for W,e faculty where England expresssed his enthusiasm for the professor/student research program. When the question of reputation came up, the candidate stated that lie is \not wildly worried about reputations,\ and feels they promote an uiJhealthy attitude toward institutions of higher education.

England is \concerned- with tile quality of education\ and pmgtamming that will earn its own reputation and attract applicants. This candidate's Jlhilosophy regarding educatioll lies in the importance of a tail~r.-made cUITiculum and agenda. He stFesssed the notioll that one cannot \take a cookie cutter and cram it down ove:t 1lle top\ of all schools; what 111ay work for Swarthmore may not work for Union. in regard to the higll price of our quaUty educati{)ll, England admits that the endowment is important, and fnmd raising will have to be a big part of his job. He allied fears when he stated.that any president who spends more than half the year -off-campus \is not doing his job.\ England was giv-en a fairly warm reception, 'but many students seem wary of his indirect responses to their questions. Many ·vvere also impressed with his academic history. Others felt his personality was very access- ible. John Meyer, se[)ior trustee and member of the Presidential Selection Co-tnmittee, commented that, Oil· behalf of the selection . comlllittee, [ne] was elated by tbe student turnout. Faculty tumcot at the meeting held. 011 Monday numbered between 70 and 90. On 1'uesday, May . 8, at 11:30, in Memorul Chapel, the second prtsidential candidate will address the community. Arthlii' R. Taylor is currently at Fordham University. He acts as Dean of the School of :B11siness Administration and as Dean of Faculty of :Business. He has been at Fordham fpr the last five years, and .previously played a major role in the 0 ... · pzn.zo·n _ \)nsiness and communications 'Norlds. Taylor achieved his B.A. in European History and his. M.A. i11 American Economic History !lt Brown University. Taylor, like England, is in his early f\it3ties. He founded the television Arts & Eatertainment Network (then Tile Entertainment Channel). Taylor was also .President of Sarabam Corporation, an illvestment firm; President of CB:S, Inc.; Executive Vice President of International Paper Company; and Vice President of First Boston Corporation. Eis other experience in the realm of academics was from 1957 to 1960 as Assistant Oirector of Admissions for Brown University. Taylor has, however, served on committees connected directly with education such as the American Forum·-- Education ina Global Age. Many of his associations are financial ones, but he bas been involved with civic and eclucational organizations, as well as artistic establishments. His background is diverse, but be has been obviously less involved in the academic arena than has James England. Regarding the possibility of allother presidential applicant, Dr. Jack Morariville, Vice :President for Institutional Planning, states that the consideration of. a t~ird;,Ji>. candidate is still an open issue· ~-, with the selection committee. In light of :the huge turnout at Tuesday's Presidential · Candidate Forum, Meyer has . ammged a question andapswer ·session Thursday, May 10, in the College Center Auditorium at 7 p.m. Meyer wishes to give students an \opportunity to · eX!press their views of the ·candidates who have visited campus.\ Meyer once again .strongly encouraged all students to attend the informal m-eeting with the second candidate, Arthur Taylor.

The primary goals established by the cabinet are to promote more com- munications between the IFC, the faculty; and the admin- istration and for the IPC to take more responsibility for the actions of its members. The Greeks are also looking to make a stronger commitment to serving the community. A Greek sponsored v·olleyball tournament, scheduled for the 25-27 May, to benefit Schenectady Big Brothers/Big Sisters has .-eady raised $42(')0 to donate to the charity. Also, all houses are volu11teering members to help security with its walking escort service. All compensation for the hours worked will be donated to charity. Developed Tuesday night was the Social Policy Enf()tcement Committee. To this committee has been designated the task of making sure houses abide the existing social policy. By doing this, the ;IFC seeks to take the initiflti ve of ensuring that all of the members .promote a res:J)()nsible social atmosphere on campus. Tuesday was also a day for all students to snow concern for the futme of the College by meeting presidential candidate James W. England. The Greeks made a strong showing at this meeting. However, rep~esentatives felt that Eng:- land dodged questions, not just about how he stands 011 Greeks. but on most issues. \He told us his objectives but never told us why be wants the position\ said President Andrew Salem. Others were displeased by his seemingly lack of knowledge about Union College. Also that England did not give any evidence of attempts to implement policies in other positions. ·\

Page 6 CONCORDIENSIS, May 3,. 1990 FEATURES Where To Go, Who To Contact? By ERICA FRANK Each week in \Letter to the Editor\ column, articles written by outraged students appear. These often protest acts of the administration or complain about sccurit y. Letters of this sort are excellent as they allow people to voice their opinions and vent frustrations. However, I find it particularly exasperating that these articles stir things up but rarely bring about change. It seems as though people take the time to write an article remonstrating an issue (often shared by us all), yet it is never taken any further and fmished. For instance, countless articles have been written protesting the fact that the administration slowly but surely is expelling Greeks from campus. However, while many students are indeed against this, it doesn't appear that anything is changing. It's common knowledge that next year Beta will join Delta Chi and Delta Upsilon in apartments off campus. Although it seems as though their removal is largely due to the neglect of the administration, they are still being evicted. I wonder who will be next. However, the point of this article is not to argue loss of fraternity housing, but rather to gi vc information on how to take any issue a step further. People complain that Union students are apathetic, yet I argue that the individual docs retain the capacity to create change. Altering something is merely a question of knowing where to go and who to contact. According to Dean Mam- mola, there are basically three different routes a person can take. The first is to present the issue to the student forum, a group of elected student representativs from each class. While going to th:e Student Forum may be beneficial, Mammola feels; \'The most effective way of dealing 'With a particular issue is to get :directly to the root of it.\ Therefore, this means that if you have a problem with the security system at Uuion, lhen you should talk to Paul Mantica, director of security. Writing an article in the Concordy may serve to '\lent your feelings, but clearly without this interview, it won't change a thing. In addition, articlesclaiming that the administration d<Jesn't care are ludicrous. 'The administration couldn't exist without the students. Therefore, it's only logical that there be explanations for many of the things that occur,. they just aren't public knowledge. At the beginning ofthe year, desk calendars with a list of department heads p1J10ne numbers were distril>uted to make these facts Ol(}re accessible. Regardless, eveil if you don't have a desk calendar (personally I didn't even !cow that they existed:), everyone has a copy of the ZBT phone directory. The time and energy it takes to write an article complaining abeut something could be better directed ·OY picking up the telephoue. Interview the head of the calendar committee first, then write the article. Finally, Dean Mammola is an approachable figure and he makes himself available to discuss any issues which .arise. Making; an appointment is a thirty .second phone call. A meeting; l~ts half an hour. One of tbe major benefits .. of going to a school as small a:s Union i.s that it's very easy to become visible. By knowing where to go, any individual can create a change. If something is upsetting you,. don't be apatheti<: and just complaill. Make the commitment to dQ something about it. Pursuing an issue is not only more rewarding than griping, it also .affects tts all. Surprise, surprise - it may even be easier than you· thinJc. Memoti.al Service for THOMAS J. Internships and Summer Jobs CHRISTOPHER Thursday, May 24 7.:30 P.M. Old Chapel By KAREN BURNS As the summer quickly approaches us many students begin to J>anic about finding a summer job. Jt is easy to procrastinate by ignoring the calendar. However, there are opportunities available. if one makes an effort to find them. The first place to look for information is on the third floor of Old Chapel, the Career Development Center. The CDC exists to assist students at all levels of career exploration and decision making. Students are strongly encouraged to take advantage of the resowces at the center early in their· college years. It is through the career exploration that students are able to identify careers which match up to their abilities, interests and preferences. The CDC offers various programs which are designed to assist students in learning about careers in their area of interest. There are ;'career panels\ at which alumni and other professionals speak about their jobs and offer advice to students interested in their field. There are \Career Observation Days\ which offer the opportunity to spend a day \on-the-job\ with an alumnus/a in the Capital District (this could possibly lead to an internship or future employment). The alumni listings may be the greatest asset of the CDC because most alumni are more than willing to assist students with their career goals. The CDC lists alumni by geographic area, employer and major. A summer job or internship is a valuable learning experience. It is a way of exploring a career by actually working in the environment. Most companies welcome the idea of internships because it could save them recmidng time. It must also be remembered thaf•some of the most rewarding jobs are positions which are unpaid. However, these jobs tend to offer more hands-on e:xperience as the intern is often <lelegated more responsibilities. Students should acquaint themselves with the CDC early in their college years. There are counselors who can help students decide what major is best for them or help students find effective ways of search:ing for summer and permanent employment. The drop-in hours are Mondays, Wednesdays and Thursdays, 3:00-5:00. The sooner one attempts to figure out \VIllat they could . do after graduation .. \ the better. It is never too early !() start exploring careers and a summer internshi·p is the perfect opportunity!

Where Does Union Stand On the Issue of Co-ed Fraternities? :By SUZANNE SHAKER Features Editor According to the N e w York Times the idea of co-ed fraternities is becoming a hot topic on college, campuses throughout the Northeast. A ·number of colleges including Bowdoin, Trinity, Middlebury SHAKE CLUB ! and Wesylan are strongly contemplating requiring or recommending their fraternities to become coeducational. Both Middlebury and Bowdoin have. in fact, go11e to the extreme, by deciding to eliminate any fraternity that refuses to admit women. The principal issue at hand, which has prompted these schools to revise their policies on fraternities is the accusations of sexism and discriminati()n~ executive director of the National Interfraternity Conference, under the law social fraternities are entitled to remain all-male organizations. A number of students who are being forced to become members of co-ed fraternities feel that their freed~m of association bas been res~icted. But by the same token university administrators have the right to determine whether or not fraternities housed on campus are guilty of practicing discriminatory prolicies. It is actually the faculties at Colgate, Bucknell and Middlebury that have demanded that single sex organizations be elminated from their campuses. fraterntiies and sororities, like any other organization should develop naturally from student illtei'est and not be imposed upo11 the student body by the administration. Although the college is not 2ctively proeilloting co-ed frat.::mities. it wou]({ by no means attempt to s!Gp these organharons from fo110ing at Union. Last year a grcllp of Union students did demcmstrate interest in creating a C<J·ed fraternity, Delta Psi Delta. The group has become active on campus, but the IFC refuses to recognize the orga11ization therefore it cannot officially be considered a fraternity. It seems safe to assume that although there are a few students who would like oo s~ co-ed fraternities become a part of the Union college C()llllllunity the rest are satisfied with the traditional optio!ls of all-male fraternities, ail-female sororities or life as an independent.

He is a ;retired faculty member of the Israel Institute of Technology, an esteemed poet and novelist, and a Polish Jew who survived the Holocaust. Recently, he published House of Ashes through the Union College Press. He began the presentation by showing a portion of his documentary ''House of Ashes\ which had aired on PBS last fall. The film tells the true story of his family life during the Holocaust. It includes current interviews· with himself, his wife, and his children, showing the far reaching impact that this horrible experience had. The documentary explains that Professor Pinkus grew up in a small Polish village with a population of 8,000, of which 7,000 were Jews. The Jews and non-Jews had lived side by side in relative harmony until the Nazi army occupied the territory. The Nazis ordered aU of the Jews to come out ihto the center square and forced them into transport trains headed for Treblinka, the notorious liquidation camp. About 6,000 of these Jews died en route by starvation, overcrowding, or by random shooting. The remainder were annihilated in gas chambers. Luckily, his family was in hiding during the round up; however, escape was difficult as the area was still being closely guarded by soldiers. A poor farmer from a nearby village took them in, in return for payment, allowing them to live in a pit underneath his barn. The space was extremely constricted .and' there was always the danger of possible discovery. At first, with each Russian victory, the Pinkuses would be filled with expectations for a speedy German defeat and for liberation. As time went on, though, they learned not to ~low their hopes to soar •. Pot . each disappointment came as ·.such a striking blow that a black mOO<.J would overtake the family for days. D-uring these two years in hiding, Oscar Pinkus kept a journal to record the daily \In terms. of his own situatiDn, Pinkus holds the Soviet Union blameless.\ events, and thus, began his · literary endeavors. Althougll he has built a new life for himsell since the war and his liberation in 1943; including a wife, children, and a successful career, the Holocaust is never far fTom his mind. In fact, . all of his works deal with the theme of the Holocaust. He writes, \There are no words that can explain what happened, and yet, I can't stop thinking about it.\ -Last year, he traveled to Germany io testify at a trial of a Nazi war criminal. Pinkus was app~led by the process, calling it \a mockery of justice.\ A :man who was responsible for the deaths of many of Pinkus' fellow Jewish villagers walked off scot-free. Professor Pinkus expressed extreme: anger at those parties which stood by and did nothing even as they knew that the Last Chance .t1Uluvauo:>t was taking place. For example, the Vatican made no moral ~taement against Nazi persecution of Jews. Pinkus feels that the church was acting out of fear and self-interest; the Nazis were coming down hard on the Catholic church, and the Pope was trying to protect the lives of the clergy members. Thus, the Pope was afraid to say anything controversial. Also, Pinkus was disappointed by the lack of involvement of the American Jewish community in intervention efforts, and warns that these Jews should have learned more than they have from the tragedy in Europe. In terms of his own situation, Pinkus holds the Soviet Union blameless. \They do not share any of the guilt. They lost many of their own in the battle$.\ However, England could have intervened with the Polish underground to equip the Jewish partisans in the forests with food and simple weapcns. Every week, planes were being flown in from Lond(ln, and yet no attempt was made to establish this contact. Pinkus scornfully treats East Germany~s current \discovery of the holocaust after 40 years,.. and its appeal for forgiveness.\The Holocaust is too big a thing to forgive.\ The Nazis were aiming for genocide, the extermination of the Jewish people, and, in fact, 80% of .the Jewish population of ElJl'ope perished during the Nazi reign ofterror. Professor Pinkus' talk had a tremendous impact on the listeners. He has a grim and frightening story to tell, but one that needs to be told. He will not allow the world to forget history.

FEATURES International Student of the Week By LA.URA CALVI Yuriv is a twenty-thtee year old student majoring in Mathematics at the University of Minsk, in white Russia. He is at Union for the year. Q.--How did you manage to come to the States? \I think that you.1b and staying in one place don't go together!' Ans.--Through the Undergraduate Exchange, I was one of the students recommended by my faculty. I sent my application to Moscow in December and on August 5 I received a telegram saying that I had been chosen for the program. From December to August l had no information about my trip; I found out just one week before leaving. Q.--Why were you interested in coming to the States? Ans.--1 was curious. I had never been in any foreign country, only in the Soviet Union. I think that yollth and staying in one place don't go together. Being youag, I am looking for change, for differencies and adventures. I thought travel could _give me that. Q.--And how did you choose this country? Ans.--1 could not really choose, but if I collld have, l would have picked the USA. In the Soviet Union we have stereotypes, legenrls about America. I had formed my own opinion of the States. If they mentioned it so often in the papers, it had to be something really speciaL So I wanted to get a firsthand opinion, to see with. my own eyes. Q.--How do you like it here? How is your stereotype comparison going on? Ans.--Student life is much more comfortable here, even if it is much more expensive: we actually have a stipend sufficient to suppon ourselves, that depends on our proficiency in the previous term. I love sports, and you have wonderful facilities here! The Union Meal Services are much better than in the USSR. Especially at the beginning of the year, 1 was enjoying my meals quite a lot! In the Soviet Union, we call the dining halls \death camps.\ It is not for no reason that the stereotype of the Soviet student in the USSR is a very skinny and very hungry guy!! Students have also choices here about their curriculum that we don't have in the Soviet Union. The student aids (computer services, writing centers) are also so much better at Union! In the math department in my university every student is given 4 hours of computer time per week. We have to \steal\ more computer time from other students ... During my trip to California I had a chanee to leru.p more about the States. The result was a mixture of disappointment and amazement. Amazement at the natural beauty of the landscape International bllt disappointment because I saw lots of very poor people livirrg side by side with very rich ones. Q.--How was the transition academically? Did you learn anything new at Union? A.--I was told in the Soviet Union that generally the level of college was lower in my major, math. But, I knew that I could leam lots here: the applications of computer science are so much more advanced than in the Soviet Union ... It used to be my weakest subject. .. Q.--What de you think about the social scene at Union? A.--I tbink that it is good that students have activities. It is just natural for young people to get together. In the Soviet Union, until very recently, all activities were organized by the C om m un i s t Y o u t 11 Organization. I like the idea of \In the Soviet Union, we call dining halls \Death Camps.\\ some youth organization but not necessarily communist, but there is only one official organization so there was really no choice for me. Often one's career ended up being determined by one's political position and participation in this group. FortunateJy.a lot is changing in my country.

The only thing that I don't like too m11ch is that there are too many barriers to the entrance to any of these organizations. Q.--Wbat will you do when you go back home? Ans.--1 will study for 2 more years in my university. then I will start working. I still don't know what I will be doing ... And this is not because I did not make up my mind, but because those who decided haven't .told me yet. Actually, I see that there have been several democratic changes in my country.

Both the administration and the students of Union College are coming to a slow, but nevertlleless sure realization of the benefits that can be attained by working with each other rather than against each other. This new found spirit of C<Jopetation is evidenced by several recent issues now at hand on the campus. The current measles \epidemic\ plaguing the Union community is a fine example of how students and administrators are working together. Within hours of confirmation of several cases of the disease, the administration went to work on setting up a clinic at which all students. could obtain a vaccination, if necessary. This clinic, though not directly a:fJfiliated with th.e school, was supervised and monitored by employees ofth.e college. On the flip side, students shoUld be ·Commended for their cooperation in helping to prevent the spread of the disease. Students ushered themselves up to Achilles Rink for the vaccintion over the past week. The College mailed out several flyers to students upon identification of each new development, and students reciprocated with concern. A second example of the growing cooperation between students and administrators revolves around the presidential search process. Hundreds ()f students appeard at Memorial Chapel Tuesday morning to illustrate their desires to be a vital part of the selection committee. The administration arranged meeting times for stud.ents to become acquainted with the current presidential candidates, and the students are taking advantage of this opportunity. Let us hope that particularly regarding this matter, the students' opinions will not be taken lightly, but rather considered with the utmost attention that they deserve. Finally, as the events of spring term are beginning to materialize, both the administration and students should be commended for their willingness to make this term a special one for everyone. Members of the Social Alternatives CommitLce and the FitzHugh Committee are currently (and have been since the beginning of the year) working diligently to provide various activities for all of us to enjoy. This conimitment to the college community is outstanding. Don't let these examples of spirit and co.opcration be isolated ones; now more than ever the college must work together to bring about a more perfect Union. Awareness? Action? At Union? Yes, It's True It took a long time and a lot of prodding, but the Union College community appear:3 to be reaching its greatest level of awareness and activism in recent memory. This trend toward consciousness has swept through the campus with a celerity that is usually seen only in party rumors, measles epidemics, and administrative decisions. What is important now is that the heightened spirit to hear and be heard is maintained so that it may achieve maximum results. When James W. England, a candidate for president of the school, was scheduled to hear and address the students' concerns on Tuesday, the turnout so overwhelmed t~e auditorium that the function was moved to Memonal Chapel.

I received my letter today and proceeded to the rink to get my immunization card only to fmd that the clinic was only open 3:30 to 6:30 p.m. Because I work at that time and the nature of my job is such that it is necessary for me to be there at those particular times, l called Health Services to try and make other arrangements.

I received my letter today and proceeded to the rink to get my immunization card only to fmd that the clinic was only open 3:30 to 6:30 p.m. Because I work at that time and the nature of my job is such that it is necessary for me to be there at those particular times, I called Health Services to try and make other arrangements. To my astonishment I was rudely denounced as irresponsible in not having Letters to the Editor do not necessarily reflect the • • optntons of the Editorial Board. All Letters to the Editor Must be Typed,. Double Spaced and Submitted to the Concordiensis Office by 4:00 p.m. on the Tuesday Preceding Weekly Issuance of Concordiensis. Anonymous Letters and Those Over 500 Words Will Not be Accepted. gone to any of the previous clinics and told point blank that I have to be there and that's all. 1) I can find absolutely no excuse for this sort of rudeness. 2) I already fulfiUed my obligations in insuring and obtaining verification of my immunization. All I need is my card. I see no reason why some other arrangements couldn't have been worked out. If it's a state health official that I need to see, couldn't I have gone to another clinic, hospital, or the Department of Health itself to get it? I would have been wHling to do that. If it's just papers that need to be filled out, will they disintegrate if removed from Achilles Rink without first being filled out? For that matter, why couldn't someone simply explain to me why it was necessary that I strand my colleagues to be there? If there is indeed a legitimate reason why I should do that, why other arrangements can't be made in this situation, I'm entitled to know why. Or, since this is such an important matter. why could there not have been both a morning and an evening session so that students in a position such as mine would not have to make difficult compromises to fulfill this obligation? I fully understand that dealing with this situation has severely ove:r:extended the normal functioning of Health Services and that this might make them frustrated or tired or cranky or whatever, but let me tell you the nature of rRy work. I work in a department of 10 people as a hospital switchboard operator and physician's answering service. Every day we deal with people who are in pain, under high stress, panicky, sometimes just downright obnoxious or exceptionally unintelligent. Sometimes, for one .reason or another, their doctor cloesn't or can't return their call right · away so they call us back and proceed to tell us everything about our character that they think we should know. Around the time of the full moon we deal with this call, after call, after call ... Yet we do NOT allow ourselves to act rudely in return. You explain, you listen, you cajole them, whatever works, but you're never rude. It's unprofessional and unethical. There is no excuse in the lines of professionalism and ethics for the kind of behavior displayed by those members of Health Services that I had to deal with. This is not a power struggle. In a crisis situation it is necessary that we all cooperate. That means ALL of us. Sincerely, Rebekah E. Thayer, '90 - 'I

Schulitz Vice President Adminstration To the Editor: Union College is a highly regarded academic institution that attracts highly qualified professors. The College requires a certain amount of . research, i.e. publications, among its faculty. These professors are required only six hours of classroom teaching a week. The rest of the hours in the week are to be spent on the responsibilities of being available to their students and accomplishing the set goals of academic research. The question I would then address to the students is that with such an emphasis on research can the professors still be effective teachers? The faculty of Union has a responsibility to its students. Teaching six hours a week is hardly a job at all. Assuming everyday life has a 40 llour work week. what professor needs 34 hours a week to prepare classes? Many of these professors are teaching classes that they have taught numerous · times before. Tile syllabiiS and the tests ar.e just repeated. They also need time for the research that the College requires. If the professors spend 15 ho11rs a week in class preparation that leaves 19 hours a week to do research. Over 50 or so weeks, that totals 950 hours a year doing research. If you have a PhD and haven't finished yolll' research by then, then why are you here? Union is currently involved in counterproductive education · practices. The faculty claims that the sttJdents are apathetic. Well, take a look at yourselves. There are pro- fessors who have either ~onday, VVednesday,Fridayor Tuesday. Thursday classes, schedule their office hours in betweenand take the rest of the time off. How many professors honestly put 40 hours a week into their work? I hope that there are more than I am under the impression there are. Yet the professors need more time for research. They need a new calendar to give them more than the 950 hours a year they already have. Who are they kidding? The College puts so much emphasis on research that many times the students are losing out on good teaching. Good teachers have enthus- iasm, knowledge, sound methods. and teaching ex- perience. Six hours a week is not enough teaching ex- perience. Hamilton College currently has a nine hour teaching requirement I am sure Union professors would be up in arms with any change to a nine hour requirement, but I have heard many of them commenting on the need for more academic commitment among the students. The English department turned down a professor whom their own students considered far better than the selected candidate. The English students committed themselves to the selection process and their commitment was not reciprocated. Union is producing good professors, but are they good teachers? If the College wants to stress academics it is going to have to get commitment from faculty as well as students. Sincerely, Michael 0.

/ Page 14 CONCORDIENSIS, May 3, 1990 LETTERS Keynote Speaker Stimulates Thought To the Editor: I would like to comment on the Articl·e \Australian Pediatrician Opens NCUR\ by Daniel J. Keniry, {Concord- iensis 4/26/90), covering the NCUR conference keynote address given by Helen Caldicott on 4/19/90. Although I agree with Mr. Keniry that Caldicott's lecture was disorganized, he is wrong to demand justification and apology from the committee that selected her. Although I was not on the selection committee, Caldicott's sel- ection was probably based, at least in part, on her wide reputation as a dynamic and controversial speaker on global environmental issues. Con- sidering that the theme of the convention was the environment, and that keynote speakers are commonly chosen to cover broad topics and to stimulate thought, I fail to see what the selection committee has to apologize for. Mr. Keniry's spiteful statement that \... the College has little interest in a responsible standard of public discourse\ is absurd. Mr. Keniry is also apparently distressed by certain statements Caldicott made about current global problems and their possible solutions. Although some of her statements were, in my opinion, unhelpful, silly, or wrong, her main points were correct and should form the basis for current discussion and \news analysis.\ Here are some of the main points of Caldicolt's address: Human activities destroy an estimated tens of thousands of species and tens of billions of animals every year. Is one a \loony extremist\ to think that such awful carnage is wrong? Human industrial and agricultural activities are changing the surface of our planet and the chemical composition of our atmosphere, in what amounts to an uncontrolled global experiment. The ultimate effects of these changes are unclear, but severe damage to economic and global ecological systems is likely to occur from potentially rapid changes in climate, rising sea level, and increases in ultraviolet radiation. Is it an \extremist harangue\ to say that something should be done to avoid such consequences? The Earth's human population is growing exponentially. Since exponen- tial growth will inevitably exceed any finite resource needed to sustain it, human population growth will eventually stop. Fundamentally there are only two ways this can happen: birth rates can fall, or death rates can rise. Higher death rates· will control growth as a result of tens or hundreds of millions of people dying each year from starvation, disease, and war. These consequences, in addition tO the wasting of billions of human lives through poverty, are abhorrent to most people. Considering the altemati ve, isn't it reasonable to limit human population growth by controlling birth rates? Isn't it also reasonable to .call to task institutions that, by default, favor higher death rates by opposing the means to lower birth rates? In many critical respects the current state of our planet is shocking, and prospects for the future are grim. I bdieve there is still time and h.ope. but th.e solutions to global problems will not be easy, simple, or uncontroversial. Mr. Keniry 1 s cowardly choice to \... opt for Ninja Turtles and video games\ and avoid the vital issues offers no .hope. The changes needed to protect global ecological systems and to build a sustainable and compassionate human society will require long-term intensive, innova- tive, and courageous work in scientific research, education, medicine, politics, anthropology, planning, law, economics, engineering, sociology, history, and other fields; the very subjects we study at Union College. Workable solutions cannot, however, be found and implemented by environmental advocates alone. Each of us, in cooperation with others, must find and apply. solutions in our daily lives and chosen careers. I urge those who missed it to . listen to the recording of Helen Caldicott's address, and then ask yourself the question, \What can I do to help?\. Then think of some answers.

Many of her ideas to provide new solutions. were coll'troversial, and h.er presentation was,. at times, flippant. And yes, she did make Peter Tobiessen Biology Department Caldicott: Candid and Caustic To the Editor: Helen Caldicott's v1s1t to Union College was evangelical and electrifying. The selections committee was wise in its choice and as evidenced by Daniel Keniry's provocative response featured in your April 26 issue, important global problems received the attention they desperately needed for the opening of the NCUR conference. Her rapid fire coverage was both courageous and painful - especially S<J for Mr. Keniry, but regardless of his parochial viewpoint, population, nuclear power, species extinction. climatic change, the abuse of energy and plastics and many other topics of universal importance remain for us to deal with, and th.e diverse audience was wanned to its standing ovation. The question thus remains why was Mr. Keniry so offended? What is the logic of his position? Where was she wrong in bet 'extremist harangue'? In the absence of an orderly defense of his position comparable to tht presented by our hard-hitting Australian guest, the presentation must stand as one of tile key events of the splendid NCUR conference.

CONCOR[)lENSlS, Mtr.y 3, 1990 Page 23 SPORTS Ga~rnetl Is Nam-e,d Capital Steve District's By MARK ZIMMERMAN Sports Editor Following a week in which he was honored as the \Player of the Week\ by the Capital District College Lacrosse Coaches Association, senior Steve Garnett is this week's Athlete of the Week. During that time, the ])utchmen w0n two of their three games. 'fhe. only loss came to Colgate, a strong Division I opponent. Garnett is a defenseman for the Dutchmen and a four year varsity letter winner. While offensive players who do the Pla,yer of the .We·e,k scoring often receive most of the attention, Garnett. has quietly played a tenacious defense. He is second on the team in ground balls with 62. ~:..;,. Steve Garnett This is an impressive statistic, as teams are powerless without the ability to .control tile ball. Steve is a leader both on and off the field and is one ofthe team's co-captains. Garnett plays his position to near perfection, clearing the ball and contr(1lling play. All season he has faced the leading scorers from the other teams and has held their scoring in check. Steve has earned this week's Athlete of the Week award for his }llay during the last week as well as ,the success he bas had for the Dutchmen during the last four seasons. Men's Track Team Beats The Heat By GREG BARRETT This past Saturday, the Union Men's Track Team travelled to Hartwick College for their invitational. It turned out to be an unbearably hotand humid day. The track was absolutely scorching, but, so were the Dutchmen. Despite the heat, they pomed it on and turned out some impressive victories. 'fhe first one out of the blocks was senior Jeff Simkins. He just missed capturing first by under a tenth of a second in the 400m hurdles with a time of SS.8s. - Rich Zembek picked up a first in the 1OOm hurdles crossing the line in 18.1s. Next came the sprints. Freshman Bill Taylor was the first finisher for Union in the 200m. He capturoo fourth place in 23.7s. Junior Will Allen picked a personal record with his second place finish in the 400m. Re flew aronnd the track in 51.ls. \The IIeat played a large factor llDcl slowed down many of the longer races.\ · The 1elays also brought success f()r the Dutchmen. First up was the 4x800m relay. Jon Dub()w, Chris Ryan, Greg Barrett and Ed Dorsey combined for a third place finish. Tb.e 4x400m was, however; tbe highlight of the day. It CGPSisted of Taylor ... ·zembek, Simkins and Allen. Union ~me from behind to aip Alba11y and capture first in a time of 3:33.6. The field events were le<l by Art Broga. Broga captured second in the triple jump, hop, skipping and jumping 13.07IIi. He later came back 311d took third in the long jump, sailing 6.48m~ Many other Union athletes also had excellent perfermances with most of them competing in tllfee or more events. The heat !)layed a large factor and slowed down many of the longer races. Overall, the Dutchmem fared very well. They placed against an extremely competitive field and sllowed off their hard work. This week will be spent making some last mi11ute adjustments as the gear up for CTC's this weekend at Trenton State.

Mouthing OH Ode To A N.Y. Ranger Fan lly ANDY BRAVER Sports Editor I don't know where to begin. I de know, however, after all of these years, where to end. The ending is always the same-- tragic, violent, maddening, painful, and slow. For fifty years, seasons of promise and glimpses of glory have taunted all New York Ranger fans. The promise and glory do not last until the end, however. That is where the tragedy, violence, and pain come in. Player after player, season after season, decade after decade, half-century after ... I'm getting a little carried away here. The New Y:ork Rangers have not won the Stanley Cup since 1940. There. I have said it. Are you (Islander fans) happy now?! They have been there since their last victory, but they have never capitalized on their opportunity. The Rangers have had good teams, even great ones, but they have never put it all together come playoff time when they need it mo!'t. They are mired in a half- centmy slump that, i( his lory is any judge, could continue for another fifty years. Turmoil has always sur- rounded this consistently mediocre organization. They go through coaches about half as fast as New· York Yankee owner George Steinbrenner goes. through managers (that is fast -- Boss George has gone through about one manager a season since he bought the Yankees). New coaches overhaul teams and bring in players more to their liking. But when they do not produce (i.e. win a Cup), they are shipped out only to be replaccll by another just like him who does the same thing. There is rarely enough time to create a winner. a dynasty, a Stanley Cup WINNER. Winning the Stanley Cup should not have been as difficult as the Rangers have made it seem. Until 1967, the N :ational Hockey League had only 6 teams--Boston, Chicago, Detroit, Montreal, Toronto, and, of course, the Broadway Blues. Going Cup1ess for 27 years must have been difficult to pull off. Though it is true that the Montreal Canadians and Toronto Maple Leafs had great teams during most of the 27 years, there were only six teams on which to play~ One franchise sh9uld have a great deal of difficulty building a dominating team with so many skilled players to choose from and so few teams to play on. Therefore, any team should have a legitimate shot at winning the Cilp each season. But this logic did not work in the Rangers' case. Prior to expansion. and even today, they have had trouble building a team that was better than the one from the .previous game. They are always mediocre, always in ~the middle, not too good and just bad enough. They are the heartbreakers of all of their overly dedicated and foolishly Joyal fans. (Overly dedicated because most know everything about past, present, and future Ranger players, games and: tragedy. Foolishly loyal because they keep on coming back, season after season, heartbreak after heartbreak.) The Rangers are heart- breakers because they could look so good for a short period of time. ~hey could, and can. be dominating. In the minds of the average observer, they could look as if they have shot to win the Cup. (True fans know better by now. They look upon success as a fleeting thing-it's here today, but it's gone as soon as optimism is born. And ... ). Then it happens (every time) -- injuries. Key players are lost for extended periods of time to assortments of injuries. Careeers are shortened Gust ask Barry Beck), success is replaced with failure, wins with losses, and hope by the familiar cynicism and pessimism. But this past season for the New York Rangers was an altogether low for the loyal and depressed fan. The Rangers finished the regular season in FIRST place for the first time since 1942. It is the first time since World War II that they have finished first in anything. They made two big trades during the season to acquire the star players they have lacked for so many years. They showed signs of true greatness. But it happened again. Injuries to Brian Leetch, David Shaw, and Mark Hardy ravaged their corps of defensemen. Unable to recover fmm their all-too- familiar fate. the Rangers entered the playoffs. Though a decided favorite to win the Patrick Division Title for the second time in 4 years, it was, as usual, not to be. The Rangers promptly disposed of the overmatched New York Islanders in the first round (which is the only solace for Ranger fans). However, they were outmuscled. outhustlcd, and just outplayed by the Washington Capitals. In a season where no one team dominated, in a season where it seemed the Rangers had as good a chance to win the Stanley Cup as any other favorite, it seems only fitting that they should be knocked out of the playoffs in such a disheartening and painful fashion. If only they knew the suffering they caused among their fans, if only they could do something to end it!

Union Softball Suffers Tough Loss By KATE ALQUIST Monday, the Women's Softball team lost to the Albany State Lady Danes, 5-3, in extra innings. Union started off slowly, committing two errors in the first inning on which Albany immediatly capitalized for three runs. Union regained their composure on the field and allowed no more runs until the ninth inning. The Dutchmen waited until the sixth inning to rally back and score. Seizing the opportunity left open by three Albany errors and two walks, Lawliss, Sanchez. and Volz (running for Marshall) all crossed the plate for Union to tie the game. Two stolen bases by Volz and Sa.nchez contributed to the scoring. Proceeding into extra innings with the score tied, 3-3, the Dutchmen held tough until the ninth. Albany's Ferrelli started off the inning with a triple to center field. After Weaver and Terjesa were intentionally walked, Chementi drove Weaver and Ferrelli in with a single, scoring two runs for Albany. Although Union tried to rally in the bottom of the ninth, starting with Eisma•s triple, they failed to hit her in and score at their last at bat. Overall, the team played well with the exception of the first inning. Eisma had a triple and a single, and Lawliss had two singles. Lopata, Marshall, Kove, and Hladik also contributed one hit each. Dudzic once again pitched the entire game and did very well, giving up only eight hits in nine innings. A large amount of people were left on base for both teams. Albany stranded ten, and Union stranded eight Due to a \non-immune\ report from a blood test, Union lost one starter and the team was moved around. Lopata caught, and Kove played a sol::d second base contributing six putouts including three in one inning. The team has a game against Siena Wednesday, Nortll Adams Thursday, and a double header on Saturday against Russell Sage. This brings them to an end of their regular season. The team will find out Sunday if they are eligible to play in the state tournament next Friday and Saturday. May 3, 1990 Men's To Tennis Looking Finish Strong By RON BIRNBAUM With a current (3-4) record going into their away match against Albany this past Monday. the men's tennis team was hoping to achieve a .500 record to end the season. solicl1y. In past years, the team has finished just below .500. Having gained vict()ri(fs against Siena, St. Rose, and Hartwick; losses against RPI, Colgate, Binghamton, and Skidmore; and a rained-out match against Middlebury this past week, the team still needs to win 2 out of its 3 final matches to avoid a losing record. Due to the measle:s epidemic, these home matches have been converted to away matches against Albany, Oneonta, · and Williams. Albany and Willi3f!}s are both good teams and expected to be a challenge skillwise, but Union shouid be able to defeat Oneonta as it has done in past seasons. This past week had mi~ed results. Colgate, from .Division One, was difficult and stronger than Union up and down the order. Along with Skidmore, also Division One, this was the most difficult match of the season for Union. After the rain-out at Middlebury, which still may be rescheduled, the Dutchmen swept Hartwick, with 4 out of 6 victories in singles and 3 out of 3 wins in doubles. Overall, this was a good, well-balanced match. Perhaps the most heat;~})reaking challenge ·Of the season was a 5-4 loss against RPI, a team very ·equal in strength to Union. The team's powerful roster has allowed it to handle its tough schedule this season. The singles and doubles line- ups, which vary each week, are made up of a combination of senior Pat Guy, junior John Conti, sophomores Garrett Lasewicz, Chris Miller, and captain Chris D'Orio (the latter two have been out recently because of injury), and freshmen Simon Elkeslassy, Adam Breslawsky, and Darren Dahl. On a team based on a singles play, Guy and Conti have been strong at doubles. Guy has also had solid temperament and played well at #6 singles. Breslawsky has also played well at the #5 and #6 singles positions, with a sole lC>s.s to Binghamton. Elkeslassy has played the most consistently throughout the season with: patience, and Lasewic:z has led the team in serving. D'Orio and Miller have co11tributed aU-around and Dahl, as a young player. still has many years ahead on the team.

Page 2 CONCORDIENSIS, Yay 10, 1990 (llnnrnrhtrnsis NEWS ANAL YSlS SPAA Critical Of Noriega Trial By BETH PINCUS What would you think if China invaded the United States and kidnapped President Bush? The Chinese government then announces that he is being criminally charged but they promise. of course. that he win be given a fair trial. Now. change the actors to include the United States and Panama and you have a good picture of the scenario of just five months ago. This week SP AA (Students for PoHtical Awareness and . Action) sponsored an awareness discussion which focused on Noriega's trial. Kelly Mooney. who is writing her thesis on this topic, was our speaker. It seems absurd that the United States would go jnto another sovereign nation and take its leader. Noriega, in.to their own country and indict him on criminal drug charges. Fortunately or unfortunately this happened last December. Panama cannot even take the United States to the World Court because the U.S. will not agree to it. Thus, the question as to whether or not Bush was \right\ to invade Panama is moot. The next question, whic~ is stiH being grappled with.. is how Noriega can possibly get a fair trial by jury in Florida, where be is being he1d. That is a tough one, considering that many Cuban Fefugees live there ancl associate Noriega with their own, and despised, .Fidel Castro. There is a possibility that Noriega will be moved to Washington, DC in the hopes of getting a \fairer\ jwy. Nodega's trial has been kept solely criminal. rather than political. This is of great importance to the prosecution because tbey do not want the . criminal charges to .be obscured by tile political circumstances. The defense will try to use the latter to help their case and ·illegitimize the criminal charges. ' Noriega's trial is already very intricate and extensive even though it has not yet begun. Kelly brought up a number of points and questions which were discussed by the entire gro1:1p. It was an extremely info111lative evening. If you are interested in getting involved with SPAA, we meet every Monday at 7:30 p.m, in Room 205 of the College Center. All are welc~me. The Rise Of The Tenured Radical By ROGER KIMBALL Managing Editor, The New Criterion It is no secret that the academic study of the humanities in this country is in a state of crisis. Proponents of dec()nstruction, fern inist studies, and other politically motivated challenges to the traditional tenets of humanistic study have by now become the domina11t voice in the humanities departments of many of our best colleges and universities. There are, of coarse, differences and even struggles among these various groups. But seen from the perspective of the tradition they are seeking to subvert-- the tradition of high culture embodied in the classics of Western art and thought-- they exhibit a remarkable unity of purpose. Their object is nothing less than the destruction of the values, methods, and goals of tradditional humanistic study. Princeton University's Elaine Showalter. for example, has called for a \complete revoluti()n\ in the teaching of literature in order to enfranchise \gender as a fundamental category of literary analysis.\ The University of Pennsylvania's. Houston Baker touts the Black Power movement of the nineteen- sixties as a desirable alternative to the \White Western\ culture he sees enshrined in the established literary canon. And Duke University's Fredric Jameson propounds a Marxist vision of criticism that promises to \liberate ... us from the empirical object.\ What we see throughout the work of these and many other academics is a thoroughgoing animus to the traditional values ofWestem thought and culture. The institutionalization of the radical ethos in the academy has resulted not only in an increasing politicization of the humanities, but also in an increasing ignorance of the humanistic legacy. In~tead of reading the great works of the past, students watch movies and peruse second- or tllird-rate works dear to their ideological cohort; instead of reading widely among primary texts, they absorb abstruse commentaries, resorting to primary texts only to furnish illustrations for their pet, critical \theory.\ Since many professors have been the beneficiaries of the kind of traditional education they have rejected and are An informational meeting on the Political Science Department's Term in Washington for Spring 1991 will be held on Wednesday, May 16 at 4:30 p.m. in SS-1 03. Applications for the programs will be available at this meeting (and not beforehand). Deadline for completed applications will be Friday, June 1 . Those interested in the program and unable to attend on 5/16 should see Prof. Tidmarch, Department Chair, in SS-216. Students from all majors are eligible to apply for acceptance. denying their stuclents, it is the students themselves who are the real losers in this fiasco. Presumably, they enrolled in a liberal arts curriculum in the first place because they wished to be educated. After four years they will find that they are ignorant of the tradition and that their college education. was largely a form of ideological indoctrination. The issues raised by the politicization of the humanities have application far beyond the ivy-colored walls of the academy. The denunciations of the \hegemony\ of Western culture and liberal institutions that are sounded so insistently within our colleges and universities these days are not idle chatter. They represent a concerted effort to attack the very foundations of the society that guarantees the independence of cultural and artistic life-- including the independence of our institutions of higher education. Indeed, behind the transformations contemplated by the proponents of feminism. deconstruction, and the rest is a blueprint for a radical social transformation that would revolutionize every aspect of social and political life, from the independent place we grant high culture within society to the way we relate to one another as men and women. It is precisely for this reason that the traditional notion of the humanities and the established literary canon have been so violently attacked by politically correct-thinking academics. As the cultmal guardians of the ideals and values that Western democratic society has struggled to establish and perpetuate, the humanities also form a vast impediment to the radical vision of their new academic enemies. The overheated rhetoric and pose of beleagured defiance that one regularly encounters in the academy may suggest that those railing against. say. \European dominance\ or \white. male, WASP hegemony\ are isolated figures on the margins of academic power. Unfortunately, the opposite is the case .. Far from . being a besieged minority. such professors represent the new establishment of tenured radicals. Often they are among the most highly paid professors,..- the professors for Phi Delta Theta presents whose services our leading universities bid against each other in little-publicized contests. Nor is the influence of these professors confined to the present moment. At many prestigious institutions, they are :precisely the people helping to sbape the future by making faculty · appointments, overseeing promotions. and devisiag the educational program in the humanities-- effoJts at self-propagations that virtually assure their continued dominance for another generation. The truth is that when the childen of the sixties received their professorships and deanships, they did not abandon the dream of radical cultural transformation; they set out to implement it. Now. instead of disrupting classes, they are teac.hing them; instead of attempting to destroy our educational institutions physically, they are subverting them from within. Over the last two decades, what we have witnessed in American higher education is nothing less than the rise of a new academic establishment, the establishment of tenured radicals.

Swartz believes in f11rther student awareness and activism, and wants to make the Student Forum \a real force on campus.\ He believes that more rallies are appropriate to show the administration how the students feel. Spring also commented on past decisions made by the administration. \Union College was the first college to have fraternities, and it should be the last to keep them. It is a shame that the administration is moving in that direction.\ Drew Ward described himself as an \active person on campus.\ He is an R.A., a Gatesman, and President of the junior class. He stated that he was very upset with the way things went this year because \the leadership did not use its full potential to express student opinions.\ Ward believes in \open forums that meet 2-3 times a term\ which would have discussions between the students and the administration about the major J>roblems on campus. \Advisory committes to the president. which include students. are our direct link to the President.

Page 4 CONCORDIENSIS, May 10, llJ90 Candidate Taylor Addresses Students Initial Steps In Question and Answer Session Continued· from page 1 richnes_s it brings to (oneself).\ Andy Salem, president ofthe Interfraternity Council, put to Taylor the isstie of fraternities' right to remain single sex.. He admitted it is \a tough issue.\ While claiming the Greeks \have lost something.\ he does know about Union's history as the mother of fraternities. He himself was a Sigma Nu at Brown University. He urged that the students be calm, and realize that it wi;)l take a long time to work this problem out. He would ask questi<>ns of Greeks: Are they helpful or Iiurtful? Is Greek life a part of the overall learning experience at Union? If these co111d be answered favorably, Taylor continued, then \let's sit and talk,\ he offered. He advised that any organization that excludes person.s by virtue of gender or race \Will be facing much pressure. With this in mind, Taylor would \be thinking about that, pla.nning for it, so actions were my own, not something imposed by others.\ Tim Sams of the African and Latino Alliance of S tlldents inquired about Taylor's views on multi-cultura1ism at Union. Taylor understands the \need for black students and faculty,\ and for a comfortable environment for them. He is, however, not in favor of multi- culturalism, but rather favors trans-culturalism. 'fhis atmosphere tllat \keeps the Western and English core with curricular satellites,\ in his mind is more doa.ble. Panhellenic :President Lisa Stillman asked if he would be willing to \keev an ear t() the Panhellenic council.\ In response, Taylor said, \totally willing, but shouldn't we have lunch?\ The questions moved to the general audien()e, and !>egan with one from Michael Schulitz. He addressed the issue of professors in the capacity of teachers and of researchers. Taylor ackuqwledged that there must be a balance, but that the two cannot be separated. He also commen 1ed that to measure the effectiveness of a professor is a difficult thing to do. The question of student involvement in College p<Jlicy came up next from Maurice Kauff. While there is a system of student involvement, stated Kauff, it is taken rather lightly. When asked what he would do, Taylor said, \favor and implement the system.\ And to a similar question replied, \We are brothers under the laws of Minerva.\ On a related topic, Keith Bemis questioned Taylor's opinion of his own interaction with students. Pointing out his activity laden life, Bemis asked if any would go so he would· be able to dedicate time to life on campus. Taylor assured him that \most activities will be going\ if he is selected. In looking at his business background, one student asked how this could relate to Union. Taylor commented that he was asked to come to Union, and cited his prior educational involvement. Taylor addressed questions concerning minority faculty recruitment, the student applicant pool, the curriculum, and Union's role in the community. He also confronted the question of the priority of the College's financial health. In Taylor's opinion, it should remain a high priority so that the College can remain out of financial dire straits. He also stated that this does not mean at a stationary point, and what is above it as a priority is integrity. One student asked llim what issues he was forced to address at Fordham University. Those issues included a decrease in the student body and faculty, enormous competition for applicants, a low morale, and students' inability to get jobs. With a focus on student and faculty recruitment, raised pay. and money for travel and research, visibility campaigns he cured these problems. When asked about his involvement in private clubs which do discriminate, Taylor stated that he felt he ought to \stand and fight, but not quit and run.\ He noted changes some of those clubs that have JTiade to be more diverse. while others he has found it necessary to leave. In a related question concerning Union's hostile and discriminatory environment, Taylor said he would \lead by example\ to cause change. and •wwF •• SAVE THE WILDLIFE WORLD WILDLIFE FEDERATION Tuesday, May 15th, Niambi Webster, Director of Multicultural Stude11t Affairs, Skidmore College, will present \C()loring the Universe: Red, Brown, Ebo11y-, Yellow, Cream & Pink\ a Musicnlleater Tribute to Women at 4 p.m. in the Arts Building Room 25.

Sponsored by President's Commission on Status of Women This Thursday would demonstrate this by \who I hold' hands with and who I hug.\ Many students seemed generally impressed wi;th Taylor calling him \very personable\ and \straight forward.\ Some faculty and administrators also found him to \shoot straight from the hip.\ John Meyer, member of the Presidential Selection Committee, commented that, \The students (he has) talked to so far have had an extremely wide varration of opinions on the candidates.\ Meyer will hold a question and answer session this Thursday at 7 p.m. in the College Center Auditorium for students who wish to air their opinions about either of the candidates.

Women have played an integral role in the Union community for twenty years and yet have formed no support group for themselves.

A.L.A.S. - Striving F'or A Better Community Continued from .page 1 requested tb.at the Board of Trustees meet with representatives of the African and Latino Alliance of Students to initiate its commitment to multicultural awareness .and understanding. The response from the Board of Trustees was received, aml it was noted that the response was laserprinted on a plain sheet of paper with no letterhead, :the presence of which would serve to legitimize !He printed response. therefore, for all intents· and purposes, the response can be rendered invalid. Such a method of response is an indic~tion of the lack of respect on the part of the Board of Trustees for the legitimate concerns about the college community, and their obvious indifference and lack of commitment to the need for enrichment of the student body as a whole .. The need for an atmosphere that is conducive to the academic and personal growth, as well as the development of a gveater understanding of each other·, both here and outside of this campus, is deeply rooted in the multicultu:ral tradition. If Union Coll.ege seeks to foster and nurture individuals who will be the leaders in our society, then it is to the institution 1 S advantage to embrac~ mnlticulturalism, not simply because it is the right thing to do, but because it is the only thing to do. It makes sense to point out that this is (and should) be an issue that is of concern to the general campus, since this is one of. the many policies where students' voiCes and their desire to actively participate in the decision-making on this campus is disregarded and .disrespected. In an issue such as this; it is important to understand that we (AJ;.A.S.) will be setting the agenda because we have waited too long for reciprocation from the Administration and the Board of Trustees. and it would be within the campus' best interests that we act now. Out of our concern that the issue of multiculturalism be addressed soon; we as students need to establish the agenda. for the next President because, as we have seen in the past, we can no longer leave it up to the Administration to do for us .. We must do for ourselves. Hence, A.L.A.S. is asking for the full. participation from the entire student body as this is necessary and vital for any changes to be made at .this institution. That is to say, if we do care about Union College, then we will act in a manner that will demonstrate how we feel and what we need in order to create · a better community at Union College. Inquiry about this issue which faces us is strongly encouraged because this not only concerns A.L..A.S .• it concerns U. Note: The following is a list of past letters illustrating the Board of Trustees and Atlministration's continuous lackadaisical attitude with which we as a student body are all familiar with. **\***AN NOUNCEM~ENT****** ·The Block U Award Dinner will be held Wednesday May 16, 1990 Athletes, MUST pick up your tickets at the Alumni Gym by - May 11, t990 No one will be admitted without a ticket GREE.K VOLLEY BALL TOURN- AMENT May 25-27 Fiji Sand.Court FEATURE:S . . Afric·an and Latino Alliance of Students Box 1973 Union College Schenectady, New York 12308 On \rhurs.day April 5, A.LA.S. distributed a letter to you, the Board of Trustees and the Administration, which included our proposal to enhance multicultural awareness and expressed the Urgency of instituting such a program. It was requested of the Board of Trustees and Administration to schedule a meeting with all int!;lrested parties by April 30. In response to our letter, we received an .unofficial statement expressillg your intentions to commit to such a cause . As of May 8, 1990, this meeting has yet to 'be scheduled. As stated in the letter, A.L.A.S. has instituted \by any means necessary\ policy to establishing an atmosphere that is conducive to the awareness, acceptance, and advancement of Afric~ns, Latinos, an<;! all other multi-cultural groups. Thus far, we have exercised great patience in our continual efforts. Unfortunately, these means have only been counter-productive. Therefore, it is our intentions to employ more assertive tactics. In acting in the best interest of the campus community, we feel it is necessary to communicate our goals to all whom ·will be affected. The African and Latino Alliance of Students intend to bring greater exposure to the many injustices, inequalities, and most of. all, the lack of commitment to multiculturalism by the leaders and decision-makers of. this campus. It is our hope that through our conscious raising activities, we will be able to come together and work to create a campus that addresses. the needs of African and Latino Students, as well as developing a greater understanding among Union students. Until all of our ends are met, we plan to take nonviolent _direct action. This may/will include vigils, rallies, sit:·-ins, blockades or mass occupations. Once again we are expressing our hopes to build a more diverse and senstitized campus. We hope tnat this is the desire of the Board of Trustees and Administration and that your future actions will demonstrate this desire. . We respectfully request. an official (Union College Stationery) before May 18, 1990, between the , Board of Trustees, The Administration, and the African and Latino Alliance of Students. We expect to receive this letter confirming the meeting date by May 13, 1990. It is to be delivered to Box 1973 or to Room 253 Bronner House by 5:00p.m. Thank you for your cooperation. The African and Latino Alliance of Students ***************************** This is a list of BLAS's (ALAS) activities and 11 n.Jn-ins\ for the past four years, with the administration, in our efforts to address our concerns and frustrations. There are numerous individual acts that are not included on this list. 1986-87 Nothing to report 1987-88 A.O.P. and B.L.A.S. open forum with administration. Some of the administrators present were Shadier, Mammola. Underwood, Wanda Torres, Alfred, Mantika (head of security).

We felt as though we were grossly disrespected and given the \run-around.\ Those in attendance were Dean Trish Williams. Dean Underwood, Dean Butterstein, all.d Diana Winkler. Winter .term: meeting with President Morris, Dean Underwood and Dean Mammola. We were ptornised that the Mfirmative Action program would be in place by the end of March. This has not taken place. Observations - The college has not made a commitment to cultural diversity and undetrstanding. Furthermore, it has not committed itself to improving the situations of Black and Latino students .. -There have been numerous positions open since l984 and none have been filled by a Black or Latino professor. - The population of Black (no Latinos) faculty has decreased instead of increasing.

INTERNATIONAL FEATURES ·~D International Student of the Week By SONIA MITEU & ROSA MARlA ESCOTO Simon Ekl~slassy has been chosen as tile International Student of the Week because of his very interesting background. He was born in Chichester, England of an English mother and a Moroccan father. He spent his childhood and adolescence in Casa Blanca.. He attended French schools, French being his mother's language. Although the surroundings and climate may remind us of the holiday season, for Simon it was competition that started at the age of fifteen. \To stay in a French .college one_ has to face a very ·difficult selection implying competition among students. This is all due to the fact that higher education schools can accept much fewer students than the amount qualified,\ Simon says. He explained that there is no free choice ·Of schedules as they do in America. Anot4er difference he pointed out was that three ye~s before they finish big~ school, students have to choose to specialize in mathematics, literature, biology, or any ·Of other subject options the school provides.. Tltis makes the schedule very heavy, and besides, the students have to go to school five days a wee'K from 8 a;m.-12 p.m. and from 2-5 p.m. For a Moroccan \Fraternities are a new concept for someone coming from Morocco.

At the age of 18 most kids in those far lands have to pass the \Baccalaureat\', a one-week exam made up of seven to nine different subjects. After passing his exam, Simon decided to come to America, even though most of his friends decided to go t() French universities. He explained that his reason for choosing to come here was \that ecucation is less competitive than in France.\ Another reason was that his family had recently moved to Montreal and he now has the opportunity to visit thein six times during the term. Once in Montreal he bas had a wild night life with the sounds of Lambada and with South American girls. What he thinks about his American experience? ''I have had a blast!

The representatives also discussed plans to combat worldwide environmental threats, including air pollution, global warming, and the depletion of the rain forests. Among. the proposals adapted by the legislators at the recent environmental conference are: the setting of a worldwide target of reducing by 50 percent over the next 20 years the emission of industrial gases harmful to the atmosphere, establishing national goals to promote economic growth without damage to the national or global environment, instituting a worldwide strategy seeking to stabilize global population at 10 billion, and the creating of an international convention aimed at the protection of the world's forests. Several U.S. senators who attended the conference said that they soon hoped to introduce legislation translating the proposals .of the conference into national policy. The conference did not specify how much such a worldwide environmental effort might cost. but it urged the wealthier nations to help the less economically advanced nations. Three Acre Planet A closed ecological experiment representing the planet in miniature is in the process of being constructed in Arizona. The structure resembles a giant greenhouse and wi11 contain over 3,800 species of plants, insects and animals that researchers hope will function as they do in nature. The structure will contain represeutatives of the earth's major environments and climates including a miniature rain forest, savanna, marsh, desert, and ocean. The miniature planet will be totally self-sustaining except for electricity and information from the_outside world. In September. eight researchers hope to enclose themselves in .the structure and plan on spending the next two years inside. Tile scientists will farm their own food and breatlhe · oxygen tl:lat has been supplied by the variety of plants in tile structure. New Test Approved f()r Hepatitus C The P()od and Drug Administration has approve<i a test meant to screen tile nation's blood supply for tlhe major source of hepatitis infections related to blo()d transfusions. The FDA also recommemled that all blood banks start using the test as soon as possible. The new test screens for hepatitis C; a test for hepatitis B, which for many years was the cause of most viral infections from transfusions~ is already required. It is believed that hepatitis C is responsible for 90 percent of the remaining transfusion-asociated hepatitis. The invention of the t.est marks a new era in the safety of blood transfusions. The hepatitis virus leads to chro11ic hepatitis, wl1ich results in cirrhosis of the liver in about 20 percent of cases. The viral infection has also b~en associated with liver cancer. Did You Know?

Student Environmental Alli-- ance is here to tell you what you can do to help save our environment. S.E.A. is a newly reformed organization dedicated to awareness of our environmental problem and what you, as an individual, can do to help turn around the destruction of our planet Each week S.E.A. will provide you with helpful facts and suggestions on how you can do your part in this extremely environmentally conscious world. It is an individual effort but, if every one of you who is reading this paper follows the simple tips given below, this campus would be saving thousands of gallons of water as a mass result of all the seemingly meanjngless infection has also been associated with a form of liver cancer. Simple things to do might include: 1) Don't let the water run when you brush your teeth. Savings: Up to 9 gallons of water each time you brush. 2) Don't let the water run while you are shaving. Savings: Up to 14 gallons of water each time you shave. 3) Try to do full load; of laundry rather than washin;g just a few items. Each washing uses 35-40 gallons of water_ 4) Just tum off the faucet if it's still running because some environmental ignorant was too lazy f() turn the knob.

The indications are that the presidential search is finally narrowed to two can<lidates. If this is in fact the case, then the choice must be either James W. England or Artltur R. Taylor. Both are, as billed, outstanding candidates. But one, as expected, stood above the other. The next president of Union College should be Mr. Taylor. Both candidates visited campus and did a fine job deflecting difficult questions from the student body. But Mr. Taylor generated a feeling of intimacy with an audience that had left Dr. England's session sensing a distance between the candidate and themselves. The cltasm, or bridge, spanned from the physical to the role each of the candidates promised they would play. Dr. England shouted from a stage far removed and standing above the students. Mr. Taylor stood among the students and spoke softly, calmly, and confidently into a microphone. Each student who rose to ask a question of Mr. Taylor was requested to give his name, and occasionally hometown. Mr. Taylor often repeated the name of the questioner in his replies, and, on at least one occasion, insisted on further dialogue with a student. Perhaps Dr. England was unfairly disadvantaged by the sudden move to Memorial Chapel, which for his session was not equipped with microphones. He also may have been a victim of a charged-up Union crowd which was determined to rake the first candidate over he coals until he conformed to the students' demands. But we need a president who will excel under the toughest of conditions, and Dr. England did not seem to be that man. Mr. Taylor effectively handled the spotlight by immediately warning students that he would be unable to give definitive answers to specific questions. Dr. England, it seemed, was always searching for just the right answer to a question specific to Union, for which he could not possibLy have had a solution. Mr. Taylor promised that as president he would spend more than half his time on campus. Dr. England proclaimed that if he were to stay on campus more than llalf the time, he would not be doing his job. Surely, after President Morris, Union could use a president who is on campus a little more. Mr. Taylor has tremendous connections. These could not only bring prestige and new students to Union, bat could mean more funds raised and less fundraising. Also, everyone was impressed by the prospect of James Baker and Sam Nunn speaking in Memorial ChapeL Union College would probably be well-served by either Dr. England or Mr. Taylor. They both appear to be fair-minded and intelligent candidates. They both bring impressive acad~mic backgr<>unds.

CONCORDIENSIS, May 10, 1990 . Page 13 Education Enriched by Faculty To the Editor: I write in response to the letter of Michael 0. Schulitz which was printed in .the May 3 edition of Concordiensis. Mr. Schulit:z asks, \How many professors honestly put 40 hours a week into their work?\ The answer is not very many. The fact is that most faculty work far more than 40 hours per week f'or many reasons, being a faculty member is not a nine-to-five job. My purpose in writing is. to try to explain the nature of what it is that faculty are expected to do and the burdens that they willingly shoulder. I want to preface rny remarks by noting that I can easily understand how much of what faculty do is invisible to students. Also, I am aware that there is a stereotype of the easy life of the college professor that is part of American culture. In addition I realize that students occasionally are disappointed in one of their professors and some may at times become upset about a grade or some other matter. So it is quite likely that hostility toward faculty in general may · occasionally rise to the surface. But I must also point out that in my twenty-five years as a full-time faculty member and two years as Dean I have never heard something from a student about faculty j.n general that seems to have the sort of scorn and anger that I sense in Mr. Schulitz's letter. Thus the letter is very disturbing to read. As Dean and a member of the Faculty Review Board I read a lot of material that students write and say about facufty. 1 talk to students. I also talk to many alumni about their experiences at Union. The general picture that I get is one bf great satisfaction with, and pride in, the Union faculty. Indeed. I think one of Union's distinguishing features is that students .. and faculty have a high regard for eacb. other and that they enjoy working together. That is why I look forward to teaching the one course each year that I am able to schedule. It is a privilege to be able to walk into the classroom and work with students: I think almost all faculty have that view and I think that most students sense that it is so. No college can be truly excellent if the faculty are ·not excellent and are not committed. The academic reputation of a college can survive Deans and other administrators doing their jobs badly but it cannot survive facu1ty doing their jobs badly. That is because there is no substitute for what happens ill the classroom, the lab and the studio. I can think of few jobs that are as difficult as teaching. As Dean the hours demanded of me are very great, but there are faculty members who regularly put in fifty and sixty hours per week. It is possible that my job as Dean subjects me to more stress than that experienced by m()st faculty. but facnlty are routinely called upon to make hard decisions, some which directly affect the lives and careers of fell()W faculty members. And I do know that tbere is nothlng in my life that I have done that has been harder or more stressful tllan the first few years of teaching. Even now 1 find that when I am teaching my course is rarely out of my mind. From the moment I end a class I am asking myself \How could I have done it better and how can I do it better next time? How could I have made a point better, how could' I have organized part of I!lY presentation better and how ·could I have drawn a particular student int() a discussion in a better way? \ 1 think that most faculty ask tile same questions. and that i:n()St are immersed in their courses in the same way that I am. This alone means that teaching can never be a nine-to-five job. Without trying to be exhaustive let me try to explain what the College expects of faculty members and what the dimensions of their responsibilities are. One key assumption underlies our system, and that is that faculty responsibilities encompass teaching, scholarly activity and service u the college. Perfonnance of these forms of work is taken into account in hiring, Co()ntl'act renewal, tenurability determination, promotion, and the review for merit pay increases that each faculty member undergoes every two years. In all cases, teaching and scholarship are given greater weight than service to the College. As I have stated as forcefully as possible &.n many occasions, the College views teaching and research as mutually reinforcing activities. The basic principle to which we adhere is that in order to stay intellectually alive it is essential t11at faculty produce work whose quality is subject to some form of \public review\ by professional peers. That work can include books, articles, papers presented at professional conferences, some forms of consulting, works of art. perfOll;mances and other products of professional labor. Maintaining one's intellectual vitality an.d professional craft contributes to one's imagination, creativity, intellectual discipline and stock of knowledge. A faculty consisting of people who do this will be va8tly superior to a faculty consisting of people who do net. Students will be better taught by such a faculty. For example does it not make eminent ~ood sense to be taught to do research by someone who does resem'Ch or to be tallgbt to paint by someone who paints, or to be taught to write by someone who writes? I cannot imagine that perceJltive students would disagree. What faculty do as teachers goes far bceyond being in class when reqt~ired. (Incidentally, the teaclting load of Union faculty is: if anything higher than tile teaching load at LETTERS Getting a Jump on the. Critics 'fo the Editor: I realize that last week's editorial has angered numerous educators at this institution. Some may have published responses in the Concordiensis. Instead ()f waiting until next week .to answer my critics I will start immediately. · Union College has lost the faith of the student body. The students have every right to feel that the College is defaulting on its academic obligations to its students. NCUR is a perfect example of how Union College put its own students on the lowest priority. Here was an excellent ·example of how the College wasted an dpportunity to exhibit its sincerity to academia. They did very well on the administrative end, but for their ow11 students they did nothing. Another aspect of education that the College is removing- is the two free graduate courses offered to seniors upon graduation. These courses are being phased out and wil'l no longer be available to future students. These and other incidents raise the question. what is the role of academics in lhe future at Union CoUege? I addressed a similar question. to the presidential candidate Arthur Taylor, on the role of the · professor, specifically, in the classroom. He felt, as I do, that comparable institutions.) Activities that come under the heading of teaching include far more tban spending the allotted number of hours in the classroom. Courses must be planned and revised, books and reserve reading must be selected, experiments must be developed, assignments must be developed and graded. All of this can happen only because faculty stay up to date and think about their courses. Let me give one not so small example - faculty members who teach the Freshman Preceptorial spend many hollfs each year just at the task of reviewing and revising the reading list for the following year .. Another example is that many hours of faculty time go into the task of supervising independent work, sometimes as part of the College's very successful undergraduate research program, a program that led to 65 Union students making presentations at the National Conference on Undergraduate Research. Related to teaching are a number of important activities including academic advising, writin.g letters of recommendation and making and supporting nominations for awards and honors. Without nominations and supporting argument we would not have as many students winning important awards as is now the case, nor would we be able to go ot1 with the routine business of selecting students for \local honors\ such as membership in Phi Beta Kappa. Some of these activities easily go unseen by a more defined relationship must exist between classroom teaching skills and research. It is the role of the Administration and the Faculty to address this issue. I quoted the New York Times on the findings of the Carnegie Foundation Reports. \The study criticized a system that encourages faculty members to pursue their own research at the expense of teaching students.\ I have spoken with deans and professors a:bout what I wrote, and most were disturbed. I am totally in favor of research by the professors here at Union. I realize that this research gives us status in the intellectual community. However, I cannot understand how any professor could be a proponent of poor teaching. Or should I say how can any professor disagree with the College taking measures to improve the teaching, If the College research requirement or the individual professor's commitment to research impedes teaching then I feel that the relationship between teaching and research must be adjusted. Teachers are actually in the classroom for a small period of time. All I am asking is that for those few hours when a professor is in the classroom he/she should be 100% committed to teaching and teaching well. To again quote the Carnegie Foundation's report, \We (the Foundation) found that in too many students. That is not the case with letters of recommendation for graduate and professional school. Most students I know seem to genuinely appreciate faculty willingness to write such letters. And I think most recognize that the letters do not get written during a \nine-to- five-day.\ What about scholarship and other professional activity? For most faculty the time for this activity is squeezed into schedules that are dominated by the pace of everyday activities that are scheduled at a particular time, namely teaching, office hours and meetings related to department and college sevice. Much takes place in evenings and on weekends during the academic year. The rest takes place during the summer and the Christmas break. And contrary to what students might expect, much of the life of the College continues during these periods and draws faculty away from scholarly work. What do faculty do as service to the College? The answer is a whole range of time- consuming activities without which the College could not function. Much of the work would be called administration and would be done by administrators in organizations other than colleges and universities. Institutions of higher education ate in effect subsidized by the largely free contributions of faculty to \running the organization.\ The most important function in any academic institution is to make sure that the quality of the faculty, and therefore the many campuses teaching frequently is not well rewardea ...

During the discussion with Arthur Taylor, I .a..~;ked how many students had been in a class where one faculty member was being evaluated by his/her chair- person or a Dean. There were at most ten students out of two hundred .. Why can't faculty be evaluated by other faculty members on their teachi11g methods and ability?

To be more specific, we would have a far weaker body of faculty and the education we offer would be much less rich.

CONCORDIENSIS, May 10, 1990 Page 13 LETTERS Education Enriched by Faculty Getting a Jump on the Critics To the Editor: I write in response to the letter of Michael 0. Schulitz which was printed in the May 3 edition of Concordiensis. Mr. Schulitz asks, \How many professors honestly put 40 hours a week into their work?\ The answer is not very many. The fact is that most faculty work far more than 40 hours per week. For many reasons, being a faculty member is not a nine-to-five job. My purpose in writiAg is to try to explain the nature of what it is that faculty are expected to do and the burdens that they willingly shoulder. I want to preface my remarks by noting that I can easily understand how much of what faculty do is invisible to students. Also, I am aware that there is a stereotype of the easy life of the college professor that is part of American culture. In addition I realize that students occasionally are disappointed in one of their professors and some may at times become upset about a grade or some other matter. So it is quite likely that hostility toward faculty in general may occasionally rise to the surface. But I must also point out that in my twenty-five years as a full-time faculty member and two years as Dean I have never heard something from a student about faculty in general that seems to have the sort of scorn and anger that I sense in Mr. Schulitz's letter. Thus the letter is very disturbing to read. As Dean and a member of the Faculty Review Board I read a lot of material that students write and say about faculty. I talk to students. I also talk to many alumni about their e;l<periences at Union. The general picture that I get is one of great satisfaction with, and pride in, the Union faculty. Indeed, l think one of Union's distinguishing features is that students ··and faculty have a high regard for each other and that they enjoy working together. That is why I look forward to teaching the one course each year that I am able to schedule. It is a privilege to be able to walk into the classroom and work with students. I think almost all faculty have that view and I think that most students sense that it is so. No college can be truly excellent if the faculty are not excellent and are not committed. The academic reputation of a college can survive Deans and other administrators doing their jobs badly but it cannot survive faculty doing their jobs badly. That is because there is no substitute for what happens in the classroom, the lab and the studio. I can think of few jobs that are as clifficult as teaching. As Dean the hours demanded of me rue very great, but there are faculty members who regularly put in fifty and sixty hours per week. It is possible that my job as Dean subjects me to more stress than that experienced by most faculty, but faculty are routinely called upon to make hard decisions. some which directly affect the lives and careers of fellow faculty members. And I do know that there is nothing in my life that I have done that has been harder or more stressful than the first few years of teaching. Even now I find that when I am teaching my course is rarely out of my mind. From the moment I end a class I am asking myself \How could I have done it better and how can I do it better next time? How could I have made a point better, how could I have organized part of my presentation better and how could I have drawn a particular student into a discussion in a better way?\ I think that most faculty ask the same questions and that most are immersed in their courses in the same way that I am. This alone means that teaching can never be a nine-to-five job. Without trying to be exhaustive let me try to explain what the College expects of faculty members and what the dimensions of their responsibilities are. One key assumption underlies our system, and that is that faculty responsibilities encompass teaching, scholarly activity and service to the college. Performance of these forms of work is taken into account in hiring, contract renewal, tenurability determination, promotion, and the review for merit pay increases that each faculty member undergoes every two years. In all cases, teaching and scholarship are given greater weight than service to the College. As I have stated as forcefully as possible on many occasions, the College views teaching and research as mutually reinforcing activities. The basic principle to which we adhere is that in order to stay intellectually alive it ts essential that faculty produce work whose quality is subject to some form of \public review\ by professional peers. That work can include books. articles, papers presented at professional conferences, some forms of consulting, works ()f art, performances and other products of professional labor. Maintaining one's intellectual vitality and professional craft contributes to one's imagination, creativity, intellectual discipline and stock: of knowledge. A faculty consisting of people who do this will be vastly superior to a faculty consisting of people who do not. Students will be better taught by such a faculty. For example does it not make eminent good sense to be taught to do research by someone who does research or to be taught to paint by someone who paints, or to lle taught to write by someone who writes? I cannot imagine that perceptive students would clisagree. What faculty do as teachers goes far beyond being in class when required. (Incidentally, the teaching load of Uni()n faculty is if anything higher than the teaching load at To the Editor: I realize thaL last week's eclitorial has angered numerous educators at this institution. Some may have published responses in the Concordiensis. Instead of waiting until next week to answer my critics I will start in1 mediate! y. Union College has lost the faith of the student body. The students have every right to feel that the College is defa,lllting on its academic obligations to its students. NCUR is a perfect example of how Union College put its own students on the lowest priority. Here was an excellent example of how the College Vlasted an opportlmity to exhibit its sincerity to academia. They did very well on the administrative end, but for their own students they did nothing. Another aspect of education that the College is removing is the two free graduate courses offered to seniors upon graduation. These courses are being phased out and will no longer be available to future students. These and other incidents raise the question, what is the role of academics in the future at Union College? I addressed a similar question, to the })residential candidate Arthur 'Taylor, on the role of the professor, specifically, in the classroom. He felt, as I do, that comparable institutions.) Activities that come under the heading of teaching include far rnorc than spending the allotted number of hours in the classroom. Courses must be planned and revised, books and reserve reading must be selected, experiments must be developed, assignments must be developed and graded. All of this can happen only because faculty stay up to date and think about their courses. Let me give one not so small example - faculty members who teach the Freshman Preceptorial spend many hours each year just at the task of reviewing and revising the reading list for the following year. Another example is that many hours of faculty time go into the task of supervising independent work, sometimes as part of the College's very successful undergraduate research program, a program that led to 65 Union students making presentations at the National Conference on Undergraduate Research. Related to teaching are a number of important activities including academic advising, writing letters of recommendation and making and supporting nominations for awards and honors. Without nominations and supporting argument we would not have as many students winning important awards as is now the case, nor would we be able to go on with the routine business of selecting students for \local honors\ such as membership in Phi Beta Kappa. Some of these activities easily go unseen by a more defined relationship must exist between classroom teaching skills and research. ll 1s the role of the Administration and the Faculty to address this issue. I quoted the New York Times on the findings of the Carnegie Foundation Reports. \The study criticized a system that encourages faculty members to pursue their own research at the expense of teaching students.\ I have spoken with deans and professors about what I wrote, and most were disturbed. l am totally in favor of research by the professors here at Union. I realize that this research gives us status in the intellectual community. However, [cannot understand how any professor could be a proponent of poor teaching. Or should I say how can any professor disagree with the College taking measures to improve the teaching.

r Page 14 CONCORDIENSJS, May 10, 1990 LETTERS Getting 'The Facts Straight To the Editor: The many distortions and oversimplifications in Michael 0. Schulitz's letter of May 3 to Concord.i:ensis demand a reasoned rebuttal. Schulitz claims that, \Teaching six hours a week is hardly a job at all.\ Well, that should be six and a half. But anyway. professors have a number of other things to do: giving tutorials and independent studies (not counted as part of the work load), supervising theses, preparing classes, grading papers and exams, holding conferences with students, reading and researching, writing books and articles, attending meetings, and taking care of day-to-day departmental business (planning visits by guest lecturers, writing letters of recommendation for students, modifying the curriculum, recruiting new faculty, etc.) and simply taking part in the life of the college community. A good deal of this work, especially writing and research, gets done at night or over the weekend. This doesn\t mean that Union professors never scamp their jobs, but I doubt that any fair-minded observer would write off the fac:ulty here as a bunch of teaured idlers. Schulitz claims that Hamilton College's faculty have a teaching load fully 50% heavier than Union's. The fact is that Hamilton is on the semester (14 weeks) s:ystem. Most professors there currently teach three courses per semester, with classes meeting three times a week for 50 minutes. That equals. 210dass hours pet academic year. The typical Union profess<Jr would spend 195 hours in class (65 minutes x 6 class meetings x 30 weeks) over the same period.. But Hamilton is now in the process of lowering their work load from six to five courses a year, which would mean a total of only 17 5 hours in the classroom. 'The _grass is always greener on the other fellow's campus. Finally, Sch;ulitz says the English department \turned down a profes~or whom their own students considered far better than the selected candidate.\ The truth of the matter is more complex: A small group of English majors who helped in the recruiting process this past winter voted (in a purely advisory manner) for a candidate V!hom the department, in the end, rejected. No one in the de:partment denied, that this candidate had the strongest schofarly credentials {as well he might have, since he was much older than the other candidates). But, there was serious disagreement whether he was ~he best all- around person for tile job, and although he had some strong supp<Jrt he was ultimately turned down. Time will tell whether the decision was the right one, but each member of tlte department voted as he or she saw fit; and democracy . prevailed. Schulitz and others who are unaware ofthe thorny, paradoxical problems raised by any election with three or more candidates are urged to consult . Professor Alan Taylor of the , Math department Cordially, Peter Heinegg On the Contrary, Mr. Schulitz To the Editor: I am sitting in my office feeling angry and hurt. I have just read Michael Schulitz's letter C on c or die n sis, 5/3/90) entitled \Administration Leads Faculty Astray.\ It is almost 5:00 p.m. The reason I am here now is because my last student appointment just ended, and I have two review sessions tonight, one for each of my two classes. I will probably get something to eat at the College Center and call home to say hello to my wife and kids who will be eating dinner without me. I would certainly prefer to be with them tonight, but I am having a delightful time teaching this term, and I want to do all I can to help my students learn. I write all of the above not because I am looking to impress you, or because I think that my commitment to my students is somehow exceptional. On the contrary, when I look at my faculty colleagues, I realize that the time I spend on ny teaching is quite typical. Mr. Schulitz wants to know how many professors honestly put in 40 hours a week. Certainly the last week in which I worked fewer than 40 hours was last December, when I took a week off to visit my parents. How about Spring break? Contrary to what Mr. Schulitz believes I do not use the same syllabus and tests each time that I teach a course. I spent my Spring break preparing for my courses this term. Mr. Schulitz believes that research takes our time and energy away from our teaching. I urge Mr. Schulitz to discuss the nature of r~earch at Union College with some faculty members. How do students gain when faculty do research? Let me try to answer this with a few more 11uestions. Is it helpful to have a Psychology professor who can come to class and discuss questions of Social PsY'chology by presenting his/ber own research to the class? Is .there anything special about taking a Physics course and learning about the \Big Bang\ from a man who was a central part of the development of theory, and is so in touch with current work that he can bring satellite data a week old to the classroom, and explain how this new information forces us to re- examine our theories. How about a researcher in Russian history pres;enting his/her perspective on the recent changes in the Soviet Union? This list goes on and op. However, I think that I have not yet made the· m<Jst important point. I do research because I have an active and curious mind,. and I want it to stay that war. Only by being intellectually alive can I bring the joy and challenge of the intellectual life to the classroom •. Mr. Schulitz asks \ ... with suchi an emphasis on research, can the professors still be effective teachers?\ I believe he has it backwards. I am convinced that if I stopped doing research, I could not be an effective teacher. Let me s.tate my view of what our academic community is all about. We are a business. We produce a pmduct. Our product is knowledge. There are so many academic institutions, where research is central and teaching is looked upon as unimportant. In such institutions, stude11ts are not really considered part of this business of increasing knowledge. There are also many academic institutions where teaching is central, and . research is minimal or non- existent. In these institutions I belie-ve that it is difficult, if not' impossible, f<Jr faculty to · stay intellectually vigorous. However. well-motivated such . faculty may be, they are generally not able to convey the excitement of their disciplines to their students. It is only when teaching and research are properly balanced as I believe they are at Union . College, that students and faculty can be genuine partners in this business of increasing lrnowldege in the world. Sincerely, Julius Barbanel Associate Professor of Mathematics Three minutes a day is aU we ask. u • UNITED WAY A Ta~,e of Two Misconceptions To the Editor: My apol()gies to you, Michael Schulitz, for taking the time to write this letter, but you hold at least two misconception~ about faculty work ,that should be corrected. One is th!lt research is superfiuous; th:e other is that we just don,'t work hard enough. I want to answer your first concern, sumUied up in your question, \If you have 1tPh.D. and haven't finished your research by then, why are you here?\ with !lD()ther question-~ where do y<1u imagine the things stud~nts study come from? What distinguishes most faculty of college and universities from most high school teacllers IS research. Students are quite familiar with it as the te::xtb()oks, poems, novels, philo,sophy, essays,. case studies, simulations, histories, cr.iticism, formulae, sculpture, musical composition.s', surveys, and experiments they study. Research ll:eeps academics intellectual~)' alive, and this improves ()Ur teaching. St11dents also feel good when their teacile:rs appear on television or are quoted in the print media, but the expertise for which J)e()ple are sought comes from :research activities, not simply from reading others' books. Mo:r.eover,. research grants be11e.fit schools monetarily. as well as hire and train stude11t researchers. Sometimes research findings even do good in the world. Union could, of course, put much less emphasis on research. Ho'Wever, the trade-off for an unblllartced set of faculty responsibilities would be both a greatly co11stricted pool of candidates willing to consider jobs here and diminished reputation among schools and businesses for quality .of education. As for the s~cond matter~ Mr. Scbulitz .• you overlook the odds and ends that are directly r~lated to teaching but cannot take place in the classroom, We engage in. academic advising, thesis advising, personal and career counselling. preparation of syllabi, writing lectures {I hope your estimate of only two-and-a-half hours of preparation for each class hour was not based on your own work habits!), supervising independent studies, selecting course readings, writing letters of recommendation se.veral hundred law school letters left the Political Science department this fall), committee servic~. interviewing job candidates, holding language drills and review sessions, arranging for campus speakers, a<lvisi11g student organizations, orienting freshmen, tracking down cases of plagiarism, serving on Crosstalk panels, and similar student' forums, Homecoming and Commencement activities, nominating students for awards, consulting with other faculty members' students, and grading. The precise composition of any individual's schedule varies according to l1ow long she has been teaching, personal disposition, and life situation. but you get the picture. r m sure numerous faculty members would welcome your com.pany during their particular version of a slack week if it would dispel your concerns that we're slackers. Does your schedule permit it'? Sincerely. Judith A. Garber Visiting Assistant Professor of Political Science Schulitz Short On Research To the Edit<>r: I cannot judge the seriousne&s · with which Michael 0. Schulitz approaches his education, since he has never been a student in any of my classes. r leave it to the faculty and students who know him well to determine the extent to which he approaches the ideals he so readily esp()uses for the faculty. One source of his criticism might be the <lisparity between the 40 hours per week (minimum) that he puts into his educatioa, and the number of hours p(lr -week that he feels faculty put :in.to their jobs. My pers()nal experience (and that efmany of my colleagues) is that a 4() hour work week would be a real blessing. My work week is spent 1) in the classroom, 2) preparing classes, 3} meeting with students, 4) grading papers and ·exams, 5) doing administrative( committee work, 6) reading scholarly work, and 7) wprldng on my research. I can rarely shoehorn all of that into 40 hours. Michael seems to be , .suggesting that my students would be better served if I spent more time doing 1 through 4 and less time doing 5 through 7. On what evidence does he base such a claim? Does he know of some evidence that suggests that the more one teaches in any given week the better a teacher one is? By Michael's logic, I'm a better teacher this term (since tm teaching three courses) than I was in the fall (when Iwas only teaching two courses). I'm not sure that my students would agree. Michael inaccurately offers Hamilton College as an example of a col1ege where faculty do more teaching. Most colleges, Michael, are not on a trimester system. Both Uaion and Hamilton have identical teaching loads (6 courses), which translates into a 9 !tour teaching load per week over two semesters at Hamilton. That identical teaching load at a school such. .as Union translates into a 6 hour teaching load per week over three terms. Jf Hamilton has the typical 14- Continued on page 17

Professor Tobiessen was \appalled that CoTlege resources were used to further fatten the purse of G.

We believe that Union College sh0uld be a place where \loony extremists\ can and should stimulate lively debate. Whether you are for or against Helen Caldicott or G.

Nable Pediatric Preject Coordinator NYS Head Injury Assoc., Inc. To the Editor: This is in response to Suzanne Shaker's article on Co-ed Fraternities. We would like to add some information she might not have been aware of. For tb.e record, let us emphasize that Delta Psi Delia is strongly opposed to any Administrative action forcing fraternities or sororities to become co-ed. We did not bring Delta Psi Delta to Union College to make a statement or to set an example. We founded the Union chapter of Delta Psi Delta because we were not \satisfied with the traditional options of all-male fraternities, all-female sororities, or life as (an) independent(s).\ We wanted something else for ourselves. The Union chapter of Delta Psi Delta, an already solid, co- ed, local fraternity at Dartmouth College, was successfully founded in the Fall of 1988. By writing that a group of Union <~tudcnts \did demortstrate an interest in creating\ a co-ed house. she implies that we requested assistance from the administration and the JF:C, and that we failed. This is both misleading and false. Ms. Shaker assumes that since· the IFC does . not recognize Delta Psi Delta, we \cannot officially be consider~d a fraternity.\ Not true. IFC's lack of recognition means that we arc not restricted by IFC policies, and have not been invited to part-icipate in IFC activities. When we began our search for a co-ed house to base ourselves from, we spoke with several schools where there has been co-ed enforcement on the Greek system. It did not effectively reduce sexism on those campuses. It did effectively destroy Greek life. We applaud the Administration's decision not to require co-ed integration; it would be a shame to ruin the Greek system in which Union holds so much pride.

' ·CONCOJWIENSJS~d•fPY. JO, 1.990 .· Page 17 Enriched Education • • • Continued from page 13 of issue.s such as the interdepartmental major and the possibility of offering minors, are addresses by faculty working with students and administrators. Much effort goes into the revision of departmental curricula and the addition of new courses. The implementatron of the College's ll(lW General Education Pmgram, still underway, has been possible only because of the dedication of scores of faculty members in a process that !las covered five years or more. Similal' dedication has been, and still is, required fotthe development and implementation of the programs of Wri~ing-Across­ the-Curriculum which will begin next fall. And although they involved smaller numbers of faoulty, new programs such as E.ast. Asiaa Studies, Women's Studies, Educatio1l.,al Studies and our \new\ major in Geology were possible · only because of the efforts of committed faculty. The fact is that the last few years will stand out in Union's history as one of the mQre notable ana creative periods in the long evolution of our academic program. Very few colleges can get from their faculty the amounts of time and energy that have gone into curricular change here in the recent past. The quality of program that we offer is thus directly dependent upon the special commitment of dedicated facu1ty. A strong academic program must stand 011 a solid base of support in facilities and equipment. Faculty give energy, time and talent to the process of writing grants that bring foundation support for updating facilitie:s and equipment. Faculty work with the Development Office to help with preparation of grants that bring equipment mnging all the way from our new language lab to technical in:stromentation for science departments. In addition, over the last few years Union faculty have won more I.L.I. (Institutional and Laboratory Improvement) grants from N.S.F. than have faculty from any other liberal arts college. Only dedicated faculty could squeeze from b~sy schedules the time required for such activity. Again, the point is that the education offered students at Union is enriched by faculty effort beyond the call of duty. Although I am not sure into what category it falls, many faculty also contribute in obvious ways to the life of the College outside the classroom. I think it is rather unusual for a facUlty member to tum down an invitation to participate ,in an activity such as Crosstal:k:s or to speak to a student group. Faculty generally say yes not because they have time on their hands but because they enjoy such activities and because they are committed to the College and its students. I have gone on at great length because I think it important that students have a good sense of what a faculty member's role really requires. I can understand that much .of what faclllty do is relatively invisible to students. I can also understand that faculty are not saints and that not everyone · lives up to his qr her · responsibilities all the time. I also understand that some faculty members are more dedicated and/or work harder than others. But in my heart I believe that most students know that they are being well served by an excellent facu1ty and are confident that they will take away from Union an · education that is superior t:O - · that .of the vast majority of college graduates in America.

A Ploy to Placate Continued from page 12 provide the college cornmunil:y with the necessary background to make an informed, responsible, educated(isn't that the whole \idea\ of higher education) choice. If an extra issue devoted to the election will incur a great expense on the Concordiensis, then they should print it as the most facutal and realistic Distordiensis issue ever, and forget the one at the end of the year.

CONCORDIENSIS, May !0, 1990 Page 17 Enriched Education e • • Continued from page H of issues such as the interdepartmental major and the possibility of offering minors, are addressed by faculty working with students and administrators. Mt:~ch effort goes into the revision of departmental curricula and tlle addition of new courses. The implementation of the College's new General Education Program, s.till underway, has been possible only because of the dedication of scores of faculty members ~n a process that has covered five years or more. Similar dedication has been, and still is, required for the development and implementation of the programs of Writing-Across- the-Curriculum which will begin next falL And although they involved smaller numbers of faculty, new programs such as East Asian Stud.ies, Women's Studies, Educational Studies and our \new\ major in Geology were possible only because of the efforts. of committed faculty. The fact is that the last few years will stand out in Union's history as one of the more notable and creative periods in the long evolution of our academic program. Very few colleges can get from their faculty the amounts of time and energy that have gone into curricular change here in the recent :past. The quality of program that we offer is thus directly dependent upon the special commitment of dedicated faculty. A strong academic program must stand on a solid base of support in facilities and equipment. Faculty give energy, time and talent to the process of writing grants that bring fou11dation support for updating facilities and equipment. Faculty work with the Development Office to help with preparation of grants that bring equipment ranging a1l the way from our new language lab to technical instrumentation for science departments. In addition, over the last few years Union faculty have won more I.L.I. (Institutional and Laboratory Impro-vement) grants from N.S.F. than have faculty from any other liberal arts college. Only dedicated faculty could squeez:e from busy schedules the time required for such activity. Again, the point is that the education offered students at Union is enriched by faculty effort beyond the call of duty. Although I am not sure into what category it falls, many faculty also contribute in obvious ways to the life of the College outside the classroom. I think it is rather unusual for a faculty member to tum down an invitation to participate in an activity s.uch as Crosstalks or to speak to a student group. Faculty generally say yes not because they have time on their hands but because they enjoy such activities and because they are committed t.o the College and its students. I have gone on at great length because I think it important that students have a good sense of what a faculty member's role really :reqaires. I can understand that mach of what faculty do is relatively invisible to students. I can also understand that faculty are not saints and that not everyone lives up to his or her responsibilities all the time. I also understand tbat some faculty members are more dedicated and/or work harder than others. But in my heart I believe that most students know that they are being well served by an excellent faculty and are confident that they will take away from Unioll an education that is superior to that of the vast majority of college graduates in America.

But what is this all about you may ask? Who is organizing this? GIANT TWISTER will be b.-ought to _you by the Union College Arts Club. Yes, that's right, Union CoUege does have an Arts Club. NULLA DIES S lNE LINEA-\NO DAY WITH- OUT A LINE\ is the motto for the newly reactivated Union College Arts Club. At a time when Union students are stressing more involvement in the college community, some interested students did exactly that. They have formed _ a group, aimed at promoting and encouraging an interest in tile Arts. locally and beyond th:e campus gate. The purpose of organizing a Campus wide Twister game is to show Union students that you can use your creativity for other things besides formal classroom projects. The goals of the Arts Club are multifaceted. The club would like to sponsor workshops open to the U11ion community led by both resident and visiting Artists. ' Such workshops may be similar to the \get Plastered\ mask making program that was held last year at Union. Other workshaps would concentrate on introducing students to a particular area in the arts that interests them, but that were not able to take a class in. The Arts Club plans· to organize trips to museums and lectures, both locally and in lar.ger metropolitan centers, hopefully through the interaction ·Of students with various talents and interests, this will stimulate multi-media group projects. The Art Club would like to collaborate with other campus organizations in projects or presentations to involve as much of the Union population as possible. The Union College Arts Department enthusiastically supports the Arts Club, and is excited to work with the group on projects. The club also plans to organize student exhibitions of work generated both through art class and independently, in order to promote and recognize artistic talent at Union. The club has already taken the initiative to promote other art related activities on campus. For example, last week several members made a sign to advertise the baker Arts lecture speaker. Presently~ the Arts Club has presented the Student Forum with their Constitution and financial budget for the 1999~ 91 school year. The Union College Arts Club can be an important force in informing and involving both students and faculty in fun, creative and stimulating activities and programs outside of . the traditional classroom setting. But to succeed, the Arts Club needs the support of the campus community. Come join us on Friday out on Library Field. The TWISTER GAME. will be held at 4:00 p.m. Prizes will be given to the first, second; and third place winners. If you have any questions or are interested in becoming part of the Art Club, please contact Leslie Ross (393-7413), Nicole Chesman (386-4041) or any Art Department Faculty Member.

It Cole dropped some of tlle strings and added the .trademark Commotion guitar jangle in these songs he could've tacked on his old bandmates a11d nobody would've known tb:e difference. Considering that tbe Commotions last album, Mainstream, did extremely well on the college charts without touring, expect .th.is album at least that well. This album's producer, Fred Maher (Lou Reed, The Infonnation Society), also tried to distance the singer from his 'band by adding harmonica on \Ice Cream Girl\ a smouldering backbeat in \Mercy Killing\ and the female backing singers in the single \Downtown\. However, what mak~s this album so good is what made most Commotion .songs so good; Lloyd Cole's voice, soulful and smooth, and distinctly English. He looks tormented on the cover, with a large silver \X\ over his body. but don't listen to it. He gives it all here, which makes the listening hardly something to cross out.

It seems that after the su.qJrise success of Vega's 1987 album \Solitude Standing\ with the single \Luka\, a flocK of \sensitive female singer songwriters'' started oozing from the woodwork. Singers like Tracy Chapman, Michelle Schocked, the Indigo Girls, Smead O'Connor, Phranc, and Shawn Colvin (who plays on tbis album) all owe Vega a tip of the hat for her simple acoustic guitar, her Ricky Lee Jonsey voice, a:nd her brutal, naked lyrics. Now it's 1990, Sinead. has the number one single and album this week (Grammy, anyone?), Michelle Shocked is on tour with Poi Dog Pondering, and Suzanne Vega comes clean with \Days Of Open Hand\. Played beginnillg to end, it feels like a cycier going up a long, sleeping hill; it starts at a pleasant pace, but slowly the cycler strains with the weight and the distance and comes to a frustrating halt. This album starts well, but in an attempt to relive the magic that made \Solitude Standing\ so priceless, the songs become mixed in too much imagery, and_ the pacing. of the last few couple of songs, meant to be ethereal, end up boring. \Pilgrimage\, the last song on the album, proves the album's undoing; the singer taking on too much and trying too hard to make it sound simple. While the background synthesizer swirls about, Vega sings \The light is turning and burning to ashes\ and continues to compare life and land in this manner. There Me a few rays of sunlight in the generally cloudy forecast, however. \Men In a War\ smartly masks lost limbs to a happy; upbeat instrumentation, and the single \Book of Dreams\ show Vega's 'been listening to XTC's \Oraages and Lemons\ a lot. A whole lot. But it is generally the doldrums for this album as Vega continues into drowsiness with \Institution Green\ and \Big Space\ which malces these open hands go up in frustration.

Wild Orchid: A Dead Flower By ANDREW CONWAY AND ROBERT VLALARDI Perhaps the leading candidate for worst movie of the year is Wild Orchid, produced by David Saunder, James Dye:r, and directed by Zalman King. This same taudem produced the scintillating film 9 1/2 Weeks. Again they selected Mickey Rourke to play their leading man, James Wheeler. a street wise corporate raider wh<> seems to double as an amateur Psychologist probing into everyone's personal life. The object .of his desire is Carre Otis. Making her film debut. she plays Emily Reed, an international lawyer from Kansas who speaks four languages. It is a shame Otis can't act. She is hired by Jacqueline Bisset, who plays the cut-throat, aggressive business woman. unfort- unately, Bisset, a fine actress, is wasted in this film. Together. the two fly to Rio de Janeiro to buy out a nm-down hotel and sell it off to Chinese investors as a resort. Besides the plot, which is secondary, Wild Orcllid offers a unique look at the sub- culture of Brazil Mter iliat, this movie (if it can be called one) offers nothing else, except a sophisticated soundtrack of local Brazilian music. 'The characters are engulfed by the background, which can be characterized as pulsating, primal, and sweaty. When Rourke convinces Otis that she must lose herself in order to find herself, the audience is exposed to the apparent theme of this \movie\. Very deep, isn't it? Beyond this point,. the film becomes all skin and climax until it ends to spare the audience any further misery. Anyone who even considers seeing this 125 minute atrocity should burn their six dollars. However. the four previews prior to the \movie\ was a \would-be\ bonus for avid movie fans. Leading off was Robo Cop II, followed by Die Hard 2 (yes, this one still stars Bruce Willis) and yet, Another 48 Hours, with the return of Eddie Murphy and Nick Nolte, seven years after the original film. If you don't care for this summer of sequels, perhaps Men at Work will catch your eye, as it stars Emilio Estavez and Charlie Sheen as garbage men.

CQNCORDIENSIS, May 10, 1990 Page 23 Cllnnrorbirttsis SPORTS Chip Silver· Wins State Decathalon Title By MARK ZIMMERMAN Sports Editor Only one week after winning the Collegiage Track - Conference~s decathlon against a tough group .of competitors,. Chip Silver went on to take home the state title this past weekend and is the obvious choic.e for this week'$ Athlete of .the Week. Finishing with 6,125 points, his second h.ighest finish ever, Chip's total was more than 500 points ahead of his closest competitor. His score was only 151 points away from the minimum . required to participate in the Nationals. Last season., Chip finished .second in the decathlon with 5200+ points. This season, he dedicated himself to the event, and the results showed his efforts. According to Coach Chip Silver Harrington, Silver was \the <Jnly real decathlete out there, He was like a man playing with boys.'' Out of the ten events.-Chip took first in six · cf them (the shot put, high jump, 400 meters, 110 hurdles, ciscus. and the 1500 meters). Silver took the lead after the third event, and never trailed after that point. Chip has been a member of the indoor and nutdoor track teams since his freshman year. Last season, he was the MVP <luring the outdoor season, and was this season's indoor MVP. He is also one of the team's co- captains . Congratulations to Chip Silver, the New York State J)ecathlon champion and this week's Athlete of the Week. Men's Tennis Beats Oneonta, But Los,es To Albany By RON BIRNBAUM Completing its first season of the nineties, the Men's Varsity Tennis team played two out of its final three matches this past week, beating Oneonta, 7-2, this--past Saturday, and losing to Albany, 6-3, the previous Monday. The indoor match against Oneonta was a clean sweep, with only one singles and one doubles loss. Against Albany, the team had a 3-3 individual split in singles play, but lost all three · doubles matches. With an earlier cancelled Hamilton match not rescheduled, Union went into its final match against Williams with a 4-5 record. The match was played at Albany State this past Tuesday, May 8. As Williams was reputed to be just about the best team in New England Division 3, Union played its same solid linellp for this match. Commended for best performance in tile last three games are freshmen Simon Elkeslassy and Adam Breslawsky, and senior Pat Guy for singles play, and the combinations of junior John Conti and Guy and sophomore Barrett Lasewicz and Elkeslassy in doubles. Both doubles teams have won two out of their last three matches. Elkeslassy and lheslawsky have won all three of their last three singles matches, and Guy has won two out of three. So, once again, Union Tennis will apparently break with an even share of wins and losses. In tine case of Hamilton, Ulli()n head coach :rete Brown believes that the Dutchmen are a better team on paper and probably could have defeated Hamilton to obtain a :500 record. Yet. with things just about wrapped up, sights are already being set on next season. Brown commented, \With the amount of young kids we have, most only freshmen or sophomores, we should be very good next year.\ SCOREBOARD Albany 5 RPI6 RPI5 Rochester 11 Union 10 Union 9 Softball 8·8 Baseball 1 0·11 Men\s ECAC Tournament: Lacrosse 8-5 \ Nazareth 19 Women's lacrosse 4·6 Hartwick 12 JV Women's lacrosse 4·4 Hartwick 10 Colgate lnvy Union 7 Albany 6 Union 3(9.) Union 1 Union 1 Union 8 Rochester s Skidmore 2 Union tO Union 2 Union 8 Oneonta 2 Union 3 Mouthing Off What's In An MVP? By ANDY BRAVER Sports Editor It is that time of year again. It's 'Award Time' in the National Basketball Association. Get ready to ,grin and bear the controversy tllat always surrounds the awarding of the Most Valuable Player Award. This. season's winner, though, promises to face even more questions and doubts 'thCill past winners because of tlle great and numerous crop of eligible recipients-- as many as half a dozen or more players have a legitimate shot at taking home the NBA's most prestigious post-season award. Chicago Hull's all-world guard Michael Jordan is probably the favorite to win if for no oilier reason than the intangibles which he possesses. Jordan is the only contender to have his own promotional video. He is probably the only sla.!ll- dunking guard who hopes, when his hoop career comes back down to Earth, to play on the Professional Golfers' Associaton Tour. These intangibles, or if you want to call tbern qualifications, would nonnally not have been enough to earn Air Jordan the votes he will need from the national media panel to win the award in the past. But this season has not been a normal season. Boston's Larry Bird, the Laker's Magic Johnson, and Jordan are the only players who have left their fingerprints on the trophy- in the last six. years. As usual, Johnson and J01dan are again favorites t() leave their impressons on the silver award. Bird appears to liave dropped out of the MVP pack. But he has been replaced by a long list of candidates-- Utah\s Karl Malone,· Philadelpllia•s Charles Barkley, San Antonio\s David Robinson. New YGrk\s Patrick Ewing and Houst()n\s Akeem Olajuwon. Each of these players is the driving force behind. the success of their teams. The question which writers and broadcasters across the country must answer is who has done the most for their respective team. There is . no criteria a voter must follow for the MVP award. It is widely agreed, however., tllat the award should not go the player who has built up tlle biggest pile of statistics. Tlle decision should be made hand- in~hand with the team's record. But there are many talented players wbo played on winning teams. Chicago coach Ph:il Jackson believes that restrictions should be placed on the award to limit the number of players in contention. He believes that a team should reach the SO-win plateau and be a championship threat if any of its players are to be considered for the MVP. He also finds it difficult to argue for a player on a team that barely made the 16-team playoff field. This idea would greatly hurt the chances of Akeem 01ajuwon. It would also hinder Patrick Ewing. He was the favorite at the All-Star break. Jordan and Johnson both said that Ewing had their vote for the award, but his chances have taken a slide, along with the Knick's record, in the second half of the season. Utah's Malone believes he will be overlooked again because he plays for a team in a small market. He has a legitimate gripe. But what hurts him even more is teammate John Stockton. Stockton's reputation as the league's leading point guard will take votes away from Malone because voters will be reluctant to give th~ power forward the credit he deserves. The same theory that applies to Malone explains why Clyde Drexler of Portland . nor any member of the Detroit Pistons will receive strong consideration, although the two teams tied for the second-best record in the league. There is so much talent on both teams that voters would fmd it difficult to pinpont one MVP. That leaves Johnson, Jordan, Barkley and Robinson. Robinson's age (24) and the fact that he has already won the Rookie of the Year Award should work against him receiving the MVP this season. Barkley believes that his personality will work against him. He believes that he has developed a bad rap because he doesn't \kiss butt\ like most of the other contenders. Once again, Johnson and Jordan. fv1agic's Lakers won their ninth straight Pacific Division title and posted the league's best record. The Bulls bad the league's best mark after the All-Star break. They won eight more games this year than last, and Jordan believes that he has improved. But how can a man who averages 33.6 points, 6.9 rebounds, and 6.3 assists a game this season get any better? Charles Barkley doesn't know. He said whoever you vote for is fine-~ they both deserve it. I don't know. Let's see. If you take into consideration who has sold more video tapes and who has the lower handicap ... . - -

~llllil!lilli II! Women,''s Track Third In State Meet By SPORTS STAFF The Union Women's track team left Schenectady this past weekend thinking they were going to run at Ithaca, only to find that because ef the touential downpours their running would seem more like swimming. However, once again the women showed that weather does not have to be a factor on the track. This small but confident team proved to be strong enough to beat powerhouse teams such as the University of Rochester and SUNY Albany to place third in the State Meet. Dawn Harrington showed her strength in the two day heptathalon, placing fifth overall and scoring 2 points for - the team. On Friday. in the pouring rain, Beth Jewett and Alix Goldschmidt threw the discus to the best of their abilities but- were unable to make it to finals. The runners were also successful in the preliminaries on Friday, with three of the four runners going on the finals. Saturday's events started in the field with Alix Gold- schmidt throwing her way to fourth in the javelin. She followed this with two good performances in the shotput and a personal record-shattering throw in the hammer, which qualified her for ECAC's next weekend. On the track, the runners had a great start to the final rounds of races, placing second in the 4x100 meter relay and coming close to their school record time with a team of Meg Parsons, Rika Poor, Alison Williams, and Denise Saunders. The next event on the track was Poor in the 400 meters. She ran a tough race, p·lacing second with a personal best time. Saunders' 100 meter race placed her fifth in the state and left her with some serious hardware. In the half mile Parsons bettered last year's performance to rank her second in New York. The last event on the track was the mile relay, featuring an inspiring performance by Saunders, Parsons, Williams, · and Poor which pushed Union over the edge to place third in the meet. This weekend the women will travel to Williams for ECAC's, the last meet of the season. Wish them luck! There will be a USED EQUIPMENT and UNIFORM SALE on May 22 and 23 at Memorial Fieldhouse from 12:00 to 4:00 Things will be priced to movel The Men's Lac.rosse team won their fifth strai.ght Capital Cup last week, defeating Albany State 20·17. May 10, 1990 Men's Lacrosse Captures Capital Cup By DAN srRUM On Wednesday May 2, The Union Lacrosse Team faced off against Albany for the Capital Cup . Championship. This game had all of the makings of a classic as both teams geared up for the battle. Over the past few yeats, winning the Capital Cup has become a prestigious achievement. Union has dominated play throughout Capital Cup ·history, losing only one game since its formation. This trend continued as Union d~feated Albany 20- 17 to capture its fifth consecutive title. The first period was evenly matched, as both teams were concentrating ob. defense, Union had a 4-3 lead halfway through the period. Albany tied the score and then took the lead a minute later. As the period came to a close, one of the turning points of the game occurred. As Union set up for a last shot, Scott Daniels picked up a loose baH with two seconds left and fired it just inside the right post to tie the game at S-5. That dramatic goal sparked the Union squad, as they broke open the game in the second period with eight goals. Tom Mahar had a pretty spin move in front to beat his defender. He then bounced the ball between the goalie•s legs. for a score. Steve Garnett broke up a play in the defensive end and then started up field on offense. He passed off to John Keller who worked his way in and scored. Pat Lawson responded with an equally impressive--goal, as he carried the ball in transition from the defensive zone, saw an opening, and swooped in to make it 11-6. Nathan Fitch and Tim Fisher combined wi~h .some skillful passing as Fitch added a tally. The first half was filled with many hard hits as each team tried to establish its presence. Union held the advantage with a 13-8 lead. Albany chipped away at the lead in the third period. They scored two quick goals to make it 13-10, but Union responded with two goals of its own. Keller got the first, and Eugene Ray displayed excellent concentration as he scored while falling down. Tight play continued in the fourth period as both teams traded goals early. Pat Lawson showed an offensive flash again as he penetrated the defense and rocketed a shot in the upper left corner to make it 17-13. However, th.e Union .squad showed signs of wear in the latter half of the period as Albany rallied for four unanswered goals to pull within one. This made the score 18-17 with 3:38 left. At this .point, the game was up for grabs to whichever team wanted it more. The experienced veterans .of the Union squad took the game into their own hands. John Keller controlled the ball as he looked for a good opportunity. He spotted Nick Baratoff at the top of the point and quickly fed hirn the ball. With incredible poise, Baratoff bounced a hard shot into the upper corner making the score 19-17, and more importantly stopping the Albany momentum. Fired-up freshman Nathan Fitch added a goal to ice the game thus sealing the Capital Cup title. It was a big win for Union since they were depleted with injuries. The defense was a little weak as Pat Lawson was forced to play the entire game, but he reacted very well by giving a solid defensive effort as well as adding two goals of his own. In addition,. Nick Baratoff was forced to take every faceoff. Albany has an extremely proficient offense which works the ball around well. Coach Chuck Priore knew that his team would need a big game offensively in order to stay in the game. Nathan Fitch and Tim Fisher both delivered solid offensive efforts which helped to take the pressure off of John Keller. Fre.shman goalie Bill Van Order respondpd well to the pressure of ·the big game. He made six big saves in the fourth periDd to keep Albany from runni11g away with it. It was a great way to end the season and Union was looking to channoel some of this momentum going into the ECAC toumament. On Friday May 4, Union tra:velled t<> Nazareth to play the first m11nd of the ECAC's. They were a definite underdog going into tl:te game. At full strength they might have had a cha.nce, lbut the· extensive InJuries proved to be detrimental. Union stayed in the game for most of the first half. Ther-Iimited the margin to only Qone or two goal differentials. Nazareth started to pull away in the second half, although Union still had a chance by making the score 11- 7 in the thi:I:d period. The strength ofNazareth won over in the end .as Union lost 19- tO. Keller bad 3 goals and 2 assists to lead the team, while Nick Baratoff, Natllan Fitch, aad Tom Mahar each had 2 goals {)f their o-wn. Despite the maay obstacles,. Union played extraor<lin&ily well with what they had. It could have been considered an upset if Union had w0n. Overall, Union Lacrosse had a remarka!).ly successful season. They had 16 first year playe.rs which ootdd have proven detrimental. However, the squad managed to get many valuable contributions from these players. Nathan Fitch and Tim Fishel are two freshmen who showed signs of maturity and in tutn played important roles in some of Union's big games. J()lln Keller led the team with 11Jis offensive touch as he nette:d 37 goals along with 31 asrists for 68 points. Nick Baratoffand Steve Garnett are two e:xperienced · seniors who provided the team with much leadership. Since the team has ()nly four seniors, there is a g()od nucleus of players returning next year. Coach Priore is looking forward to the prospects of Union Lact()sse in the future.

Jay Freeland . 'I1he time for chalige is now. The arrival of a new president 0n. our campus marks the dawn of a new chapter in our c0llege's history. With this, I look to open this chapter with regaining the stud<mt voice whicli has been lost for several years. Our community is currently divided into three separate bodies: the students, the faculty, an.d the :administration. By unifying these three sections, I feel that we can gain the student voice we desire and increase the level of c~mmunication among these groups. I intend to have a formal meeting at least once a month with the Student Forum, the administration, and several faculty representatives so that this communication and unity continues. - The key to success is that communication is a tW.o-way •street. Thus, we must listen to others' concerns if we are to bave our own concems beard. I Cllfl'ently work with the \We Care About Union\ committee, and feel that I have .a goo.d angle for bearing the concerns of students. In addition, I plan to open a mailbox at the College Center for voicing concerns, and plan to run a weekly column in · Concordiensis to keep the college community aware of current problems, proposals, and solutions faced by the Studen Forum. I pian to work closely with the Interfraternity :and PanhelleniC Councils to :help recognize their aims. I am ,concerned that within the past three yeats, three of our Greek •organizations have lost their housing. In addition, no serio11s attempts have been made to give housing to a Greek organization that has been waiting for almost five years. I h.ope to tie a tighter bond between Student Forum and the governing Greek bodies and work together in solving dlese problems. Amcng the other things I look to improve are the social alternatives on campus. I find it odd that a school that constantly strives for social alternatives has cancelled the largest event of the year. I agree that Camp Union cannot ;continue as it has in the past, l>ut cancellation is not the solution. My experiences. at Union make me confident in my ability for this position. Through my positions as News Editor at Concordiensis a Gatesman, the Orientation Committee. Fitzhugh Ludlow Committee, Regionai Director for the ambassador program, and a membei' of the Order of CONCORDIJJ:NSISJ May 10, 1990 STUDENT FORUM PRESIDENT Omega National Honor Society for leadership, I feel tha.t I have the campus knowledge necessary and can convey a :positive image for Union College. As in my position as president of my fraternity. I feel that I have the .managerial skills to succeed. The .time for w:aiting around is over. The . time for change is now~ Carl Friedrich As an active participant on . this campus, I would like to state my intention to become · the next Student Forum · President. There are several · reasons why I decided to run, · and I W!)uld like to share a few , of them with you all now. Over the course of the past · three years, and especially in the past six months~ there has been an undercurrent efstudent disapproval towards actions taken by the administration. This trend, I believe, has .not. stemmed from a dire need for the faculty and administration . to submarine us, but rather from a brea:kdown of communications between the various groups. Granted. the students and our mentors do · not see eye to eye on most · issues, but sitting on our duffs is no way to react. When I am elected, the break-down will cease. Another aspect of the whole bonanza is the lack of respect we as students show for each other. We all are affected by the policies of the school, but never seem to join together in a united effort. My wish is to see this dilemma resolved. Some ideas which I intend to · follow up on: a member of BLAS and the Women's Union as participating members of the Forum; better alcohol counselling for incoming freshmen; a better apportionment ~of Forum funding for clubs, especially smaller ones; and a student committee which would ltave timely meetings with members of the administration-- so that decisions such as Camp Union, the elimination of Greek housing, or the escalation of tuition will not be passed on to us by the bombshell method. This is our chance to be heard. Some may argue that experience is the . key to effective. student government. It has been my .experience (how about U?) that our Cllfrent student government, while succeeding .occasionally, has essentially given the campus away. As an active participant, I feel its my job to help take our campus back. Come out Friday and participate in the We Care About U'/'PI'otest U' Rally, then vote: Carl Frieclrich for Student Forum President. . Rachel Levine Why sbotdd we let the burden of ·.change rest on others? As; active memers of the college community we are ·Concerned about the changes and policie~ which will affect us. Recently many of these concerns ha.ve been voiced as the necessity for greater communication between the administratiOn and the students. Now is the time to take responsibility for ourselves as students, as adults, and as a motivating force for change on this campus. I recognize the · concerns of our student body and want to see a tighter interaction lbetween students, Student F<>rum, and the administraticn as- these issues are faced. 1\f()re specifi.call y, to increase :communication in order ,to brillg about positive changes in policies for all interested Jl!lrties, we require a strong For11m willing to address the 11dministratiort with an influential voice. I w-ill bring to this office the experience ~necessary to relate effectively to the administrati()n and the students, as well as a. dedication to the importance cf our need to be heard. Stu(ient Forum is a tremendously important group- - it is the power of our student body. I am willing to accept this respo11sibility and act as a strong lead~r and speaker for you, the sltJdents of Union College. S(), please vote on May 11 and vote responsibly, keeping in .111ind my views and what I stand for. The future of Union Colle-ge is in your hands. Mark Richter I am running for the position . of President of the Student Forum. If elected, my · responsibilities would include \chairing all meetings and serving as an active liaison between the Student Forum and the Administration of the college.\ Experien(!e: As Vice President of Finance I chaired the Finance Committee and was a member of the Spring Planning Committee (which worked with the administration in organizing .spring tenn events). With. the help of an excellent finance ·committee and the cooperation of the clubs and organizations, the deficit has been cut nearly in half while new clubs still formed. My experience is not solely government related As RA, I met with administrators to discuss living-learning housing options. As co-host of \The Bottom Line\ I frequently address issues of student concern such as the calendar and fraternities~ Objectives: There have been many changes this past year that have occured without student influence or, in many circumstances, awareness. My three-step plan addresses the needs to increase student awareness, student influence , and relations with the ·administration. faculty. and trustees. If each of these objectives is met, the likelihood of change is imminent. S1EP 1: Student Awareness I am very encouraged by the new groups on campus (i.e. We Care About U, and PUC) · and the seemingly new interest being given to the school. · Groups such as these address many issues pertinent to student life and, as such, deserve the support of the CAST YOUR VOTE FRIDAY · entire campus. Some .of my plans to increase student VOTE 9-3:30 in the College C.enter · awareness for next year include: -Concordiensis will contain infonnation regarding Forum meeting times, agenda and location (esp. for \on the road\ meetings)~ -The administration will provide the Forum with . information regarding prospective changes and offer students time for a response. STEP 2: Student Involvement There will be a panel discussion that will be used to air student concerns. Panel me.mbers will consist of administrators who make the decisions and students who can represent the students effectively. Surveys haven't , been effective, and I believe Page 25 that, if the students can air · · their grievances directly in an open forum, our concerns will be better addressed. STEP 3: Establish contacts :among students, faculty, , administration and trustees. One of my goals is to get the new president and trustees involved and concerned wiLh the student Nx:Jy. I believe that we can . accomplish a great deal next year, but it will take an active student body, healthy relations ameng students, administrators, trustees and a Student Forum President who has the capability, experience and desire to do something to achieve this end. If elected President, I WON'T LET U DOWN! Thank you, Mark Richter Hans Schwarz NOW IS THE TIME FOR CHANGE1 Student Forum must be the voice and tool of the student body. I want to lead us into a new era of student participation in the actions of this school. Union can be the dynamic center we all want it to be, if at this critical time we have the leadership we need. As president of Student Forum, I will make five issues my agenda. 1. Lead Student Forum to fight for the students. 2. Increase the level of communication between students and the administration. 3. Cut bureaucracy. · 4. Promote student activism of on- and off-campus issues. 5. Ensure that the first school to have fraternities is the last to lose them. I refuse to let the Student Forum continue to act as a rubber stamp for decisions which the administration has already made. As a sign of my intentions as Student Fomm president, I challenge the Forum to organize a non~ binding vote for the new college president. This will show the administration who the students' choice is and make them take our opinion into consideration. I am excited about the increasing wave of student awareness and activity which is swelling in the campus, and wish to become a leading force · in it. As your Student Forum president, I will lead us during this unique period to make the changes we want. I encourage everyone to vote, as well as attend the rally tomorrow. This is your chance to become part of the change. Hans Schwarz

Page 26 STUDENT FORUMPRESe Brian Spring My message is short and simple. We have a· unique opportunity to influence the change and course of the student body's attitude toward the campus. I have been at Union for three years and heard the complaints concerning student apathy, many of which have been substantiated by simple observation. In light of recent events and conspicuous student displeasure, I am pleased to see the potential to turn the student body into something in which we may all shareacommonpride. An example of this pride, that I as. well as many others felt, was as we were al1 packed into the College Center auditorium the sheer numbers demanded we be recognized and accomC1dated. This is the type of student I want to be in charge of-- ones that care. My Forum would be run with the smae conviction as the people I represent. No one can lead you if you feel that your responsibility ends with your vote. The power of change is in your hands. All I am able to do is bring you the issues and vote in your interest. Shed the shackles of apathy and help forge the future of a concerned and involved student body. VOTE SPRING. Drew Ward Next year is a year for change at Union College. There will be a new President at the head · of the administration, and that change <>ffers the Students a chance to correct the course of direction that the present administration b.as taken. Now is the time to show that we ate not apathetic bystanders of the college community. This is the time to stand up and tell the policy making body of this college, that we, the students, want our co11cerns not only heard, but co11sidered when a decision is rnade that affects us (such as the change in the academic calendar this past winter). l want to take this challenge, by <iemanding open forums 'With the Administration on to11ics to be considered in JX)licy decisions.- The President ()f tbe Student Forum and the Forum members should also have scheduled meetings with the President of the College a11d Administrators, and lastly, the President of the College should make a greater effort to be accessible to all students a much more regular basis. A.s the President of the Junior Class and a member of several committees, I was frustrated (as many of you were) with the apparent lack of collcern the Administration sh()wed for our opinions. I -will make those opinions heard and considered next year. After all, that is the job of the Student Forum President. Thank you, Drew Ward CONCORDIENSIS, May 10, 1990 V.P. ADMINISTRATION Al Eisenberg 'Union' College is changing .. As students, we must take advantage of this year of . transition, continuing on the road we have been paving this year. We are witnessing the last few months of John Morris as President and the end of student apathy at Union. We are realizing that in order to be taken into account, we must be heard. It is vital that we keep on this path, letting other .students, the faculty, and most importantly the admillistrators know what we feel. At Union there exists a mutual respect between the administration and the students. In recent years, both sides haven't ~en advantage of this respect. This is changing-- we have learned that our opinions count, but we must let them be known loudly for them to be considered. By voicing- our feelings, we are using this respect, and we will all be happier. Not letting administrators know our sentiments allows them to unfairly justify their actions concerning Greeks, academics, and social events. We have a golden opportunity next year. A new President: .and new ideas will be with us. By taking advantage of this opportunity, we will make our lives better. and those of many Union students who will follow us. I will do my best to use this opportunity to benefit our lives. During the past three years, I have proven myself capable as a student leader; as an officer in a fraternity. serving on several committees, and as a leader in other student organizations. I have worked to · promote student activism, and to voice. the concerns and needs :Of students to administrators and faculty. As Vice President for Administration of Student Forum, I wi!l continue on this road. I will work my hardest to take advantage of the changes taking place, and make Union better for students and the campus community. Vote for Alan Eisenberg. Vice Presiderlt for Administration of Student Forum. Nina Smilari My name is Nina Smilui and I am running for the office of . Vice. President of Adminis.tration. I am responsible, dedicated, and concerned. As I have had three years experience as a Union · · College stlldent, I am very well aware of the type of leader that the Student Forum requires. I know that I can successfully . fulfill the responsibilities of the job. During this time of great change, when state laws are · affecting social conditions and the choice of a new president is crucial to the future policies of our school, it is essential that we students make our voices · heard. We may feel as if many doors have been closing around us, especially the upperclassmen who have continually experienced the abandonment of traditions in their years at Union. However, now it is more important tb.an ever for us to assert our beliefs and promote what is in <mr best interests as Union College s'tudents. There is a lot Qf tension between -the administration and: the students at this point in time, but we need to use this energy to arrive at amicable solution~ for the benefit of all. We need to discover new social alternatives, as wen as to make use of the existing leadership organizations. For example, Oreek organizations have an estab'lished system of government and they are storehouses of energy vlbich can be given a share of the · responsibility for amending social situations on campus. They are not be be blamed for the problems concerning substan,ce abuse, radal tensions, ol other- t~nsi()ns, . mainly those between men and women, hut asked to participate in. the amelioration of these existing troubles. Most importantly the input of ea¥h · and every student, whether independent or &reek affiliate, is crucial. If elected, I intend to work with the administration in presenting your concems and' in fostering a more collgenial academic and social atmosphere at Union. v 0 T E V.P. ACADEMICS '~ Louise Wulfsohn Maintaining a balance between one's academic an(} social life is an integral part of a successful four years at college. Within a comfortable and accessible academic climate this type of lifestyle can be facilitated. If elected Vice President of Academic Affairs, I would hope to work as a liaison between the students, faculty, and administration in order to monitor such an attnosphere. A junior here at U11ion College, I am involved in a variety of activities on campus, and have thus come to tlnderstand the general mind-set amongst the student body.

CONCORJJIENSIS, May 10, 1990 - V.P. . *ADMINISTRATION Jacqueline Smith The Vic~ President of Administration will direct the operations of the Committee on Committees, which oversees all other committees at Union. These committees are peopled by st11dents, faculty, and administrators in varying ratios. They represent the closest working relationship between these three groups anywhere on campus. There is now at Union Matthew McEvoy The Vice President of Finance is responsible for overseeing allocation of the $159 colle.cted from each student under the heading \Student Activities fee\. Student Activities collects over $300,000 each year to pay for everything from Goncordiensis to the Russian Club. This money is your money. Every dollar is spent by students not administrators. But there are several problems with the allocation of these monies that must be addressed by the Finance Committee .. The most troublesome and disheartening of these problems is that the students are paying out of their pockets for the Crew. Nordic and Alpine Ski, Water Polo and Rugby teams. The teams exist year to year off of the Student Activity funds. a heightened awareness that tbis is not a relationship which • is easy to maintain. It requires · ccnstant effort by all parties ·to facilitate both communication a:nd understanding. But Union is also e:1{periencing a lteightened interest in developing and strengthening its inter-community ties. As Secretary of the Student Forum, l have witnessed a change in attitude over the past few months, particularly tllroughout the student body. There is the idea, a true idea, tltat students should influence events which occur at this college. as it is their home and . community for however long they are here. To further this i4ea, student interest .and action must continue to develop and · . grow, because it is also true .that .students' actions. at Union and the reputation of Union will affect students throughout · . tlleir adult lives. It is our . school, and its prosperity is reflective .of our own. Even witll this amount they lack the monies necessary to compete to their full potential. It is only fair that all of Union's athletes get the · recognition they deserve and that the Student Activity fund is rtot burdened by costs that the college should pay. The next finance committee must ensure that the trustees of the college understand and take action on this problem. As the current Junior Class · .representative to the Student Forum, I have learned much · about the Finance Committee and how ·to work with club · representatives. I have the ' experience and the knowledge to effectively and fairly run the office of the vice~president of · finance. I ask that you let me put that knowledge to·work for the betterment of everyone.

Having been active in various activities on campus and in the community, · you on the Board of Tmstees. I now want to offer my efforts and ideas to the .students of · Union at this critic.al time of change and decision making. I believe that I can bring valuable skills to the position of Junior Trustee. One of those skills is the ability to articulate the interests of the student . · body before the Board of Trustees. Here, I will be able to utilize my experience as a high school debater for four · years, and my current role of coaching for a local high · school debate team. Also, I feel that my experience will help me bring new insights to the position of junior trustee. During the past two years, I have been active in several organizations both on campus and off campus. In addition to my debate work, I have been a contributing editor of the Sentinel, am currently on the Executive Board of the International Relations Club. and I am an instructor with a local agency of the National • Safety Council. Overall, my I wide range of experience will . allow me to bring new ideas to the position of Trustee. Amongst the issues upon which I would focus as Trustee, I am concerned about keepingtuition increases down to· the minimal amount possible. Also, I feel that VOTE Jon Lennon The office ()f Junior Trustee is one of the most important positions available in the Student Government. You must elect a Junior T1Ustee who is skilled at working with . · the Administration, keeping · you informed, and nuking sound 'recommendations in your best interests. I believe my record of service justifies your support. I have been the President of ·: the Class of '92 for 2 years, which includes Student Forum membership; served as an active member of the Student · Affairs Committee (SAC); worked as an Orientation Advisor; participated in the Student Pho0natho11, Union Ambassador, and. Host programs; and a Brotil.er of Phi Sigma Kappa fraternity; and have been cbosen as all R.A. for the 1990-91 school year. Remember, representing · Fellow Students .. My name is Michael Rolnick and I am running for the position of Junior Trustee. This position gives the student body a representative vote on the Board of Trustees and a chance to voice the student's opinion to the trustees without having to go through the Administration. I am qualified to be your representative because I am involved in many activities on campus: Gatesman, National Director of the Union College Ambassador program (which involves over 500 students), WRUC, Orientation Advisor, and Theta Delta Chi fratenity, each. of which give me an intuitive feel for the student body. These activities allow me to see how students feel towards administration, and other aspects of Union life. My enthusiasm for Union is reflected in my participation in activities on campus. I am not afraid to take a stand for what I believe in. The position of Junior Trustee would allow me to voice the student's opinion to a body that is powerful, effective, and not answerable to the Administration. Please tum out on May 11 and vote in the elections. Make your vote count. 9 - 3:30 Friday, May 11th College Center Women's Lacrosse as well as a mem be.r of the Parent's Committee in 1988.

I have two years · of · International committee · experience through Theta Delta Chi fraternity. In 1988 I was a trustee of the Educational Foundation. representing the undergraduates as to the use of the International Endowment.

Both of these positions have given me invaluable experience as to the I would look forward to the · chance .of influencing Union's . policy decisions, .as well as operation of large, voluntary organizations. The positions I held while attending Union have given me the insight . planning our first and five-year (the 200th birthday of U . '\) . mon... reunmns. My commitment to Union is strong. Through time spent as a Gatesperson, a regional . director of the Ambassador · · Program, a member of the Orientation Committee, athletics, and Vice President of a Gteek organization, I have learned that the only way to accomplish goals is through action. necessary to expedite a decision making process. I was an Orientation Advisor twice, a member of the Orientation Committee, President of the Photography Club and held many offices ·within Theta Delta Chi.

I have expepe11ce in representing our class through my four years here at Union throllgh the Student Affairs Council for one year, Student Forum for two years, and Academic Affairs Council for three y<:ars.

' IITlportant step to making our voices heard. Liz Dobbs In the past few months we have witnessed some important changes here at Union. The old stereotype of the \apathetic Union student\ has given way to a new concerned and involved student, a student who wants to take an active role in the decisions _that are affecting all of us. I thmk that this is an exciting change that will benefit . the entire campus commuruty. So now that we have decided to take a stand on what we believe in, we have to make our voices heard. As Senior Class Reprsentative to Student Forum, I will work with dedication and enthusiasm to ensure that not only are our concerns heard, but that we are listened to. If we want the deCisions that are made to be formulated with our input, we must work together with the administration. We must arrive Roger Weber Fellow juniors, ahhough next year is our .last year at Union College, it should not be taken as inconsequential or even as an inconvenient fo~ality-- seniors silould play an Important role in creating the atmosphere that enshrouds the college comrntJnity. The actions that we take next year will shape not only the school year, but also the direction that Union College takes in the future years when we are Union alumni. In the past I have beard the Union student body called \apathetic\ or \indifferent\ and the Student Forum labelled as \ineffective\ and\non- influential\. Perhaps it can be attributed to a perceived absence of truly emotional issues facing the student body, student government and/or the administration.

Page 32 CONCORDJENSIS, May 10, 1.990 * SOPHOMORE CLASS REP Karen Hurwitz Dear Members of the Class of 1993, I am requesting your support in the Student Forum elections on Friday, May 11th, for class representative for the 1990- 1991 school year. I realize it has been a very short time since we elected our freshman class representatives, but now we must turn our attention to the people who will represent our sophomore class year. While I have been a member of Student Forum for less than a complete term, I have already begun to learn a great deal about how it is organized and its strengths and weaknesses. I have had the opportunity to work with and learn from the experiences of the upperclassmen on the Forum, and I believe this will be an asset to me if I am re-elected. We as a class have nearly completed one quarter of our college years here at Union. In just our first year here we have witnessed administrative decisions that are undoubtedly unfavorable to the majority of students both in our class and the entire student body. The 1990-1991 academic calendar is probably the best example of this, where the changes wer made final before the Student Forum or student body could react. The Student Forum's priorities should reflect the true interests of the student body, therefore th.e future of the academic calendar should be on the agenda for the next school year. This and other issues · · including: the future of Greek • · life, campus security, academic • · issues, future school sponsored ' social activities (as well as· activities in place of Camp Union), and .campus parking should be amon:g the priorities . of next year's Forum. It will be a great honor for me to continue representing our class on the Student Forum. I will be dedicated to my responsibilities as class representative and I hope that you will find me approachable if you have any questions or · concerns both now and next year. By working together as a class and a col'lege community we are likely to see more favorable progress in our next three years here at Union. Please vote Karen Hurwitz for Class Representative 011 Friday, May 11th. Neil Kanterman My name is Neil Kanterman and I am running again to represent you as a Sophomore Class representative. Experience is a key factor in almost every aspect of life. When you go for a job interview. the first thing that · you are asked is what -your experience in that field is. Without experience to fall back on, it becomes difficult to adapt to changing situations because you are not eve11 familiar with the way it was. I think everyone realizes that Union College is entering a period of great change. Firstly. we are getting a new president. .•.. SENIOR C .. LASS*• REP ..• Weber ... Continued from page 31 Forum in its interaction with the administration. As the situation exists now, the administration is fueling the fires of discontent as they, at every turn, enact a questionable policy, take an unpopular stance, or disregard student opinion. A particularly vexing issue that divides the administration and the student body is the administration's policy towards fraternities. Is Union actually the ABSENTEE MOTHER OF FRATERNITIES? Is the administration making up the rules of the game as necessary to· justify their policies? The most effective way for the administration to avoid controversy is to hold nothing back from the students and inform them of their true intentions. From that point the Student Forum can work WITH the administration to formulate policy that is consistent with their commitment to providing a healthy college environment. When we students are provided a doorway,whether it be Student Forum, the IFC, o•· theEnglish professor selection committee; we must stick out feet in the foor and make sure that we are HEARD! Obviously we can't demand of the administration free tuition, but we can demand that we be treated as the young adults and POTENTIAL DONORS that we are, Thus, I am committed .to bettering the student- administration relationship through increased, legitimate. interaction. Make sure that you support YOUR Student Porum and vote for me as Senior Class Representative in the interest of strengthening the student voice. This alone would provide the grounds for a great change. However, with the new protest committees starting up and the rallies that are being staged. I feel that Union is going through a much-needed metamorphosis. The position of Freshman Class representative is a learning poshion. I, as well as Karen and Evans, spent this learning how the system works. To bring someone new into the position would not be beneficial to our class or the entire campus. Tllat is why I would like you to reinstate Karen, Evans, and myself as your representatives for another year and get a chance to help this cltange favor someone besides the administration. Matt Lanni ~·· ' ... ·.:.. ·'··' Almost 500 students showed up to see presidential candidate James England last week. The administration assumed that less than 200 students would have come. which is not a bad assumption given the history of apathy among Union students. But Union students are starting to show concern in college issues, starting to voice · their opinions. But, thai is not enouglt. We need student leaders who are willing to work together with the admillistration. We need leaders who will keep the students informed of college issues. I want to be one of these leaders, . and I am qualified for the position of sophomore respresentative. Currently I am an associate news editor of the Concordiensis. Working on the paper has made it possible for me to meet and· get to know key administrators, including Dean Mammola, and Dean Alford. This will aid me in working toegther with the administration, letting them know how students feel and what they want. Quite simply, I am qualified and willing to be a leader. Evan Legros Hello again, my11ame is Evans Legros. I am currently Vice-President of the Freshman Class and I would like to continue representing the Oass of '93 next year. In serving one opinion. Therefore, enabling the administration to properly term as Vice-President, I have learned a great Q.eal about' \Union politics\ through the Student Forum. In a sense, my understanding of the system has greatly increased and enabled me to develop my way of gettings things done here at · reflect the true needs of the : .students and leaders of Union · CoHege. Union. · There are certain issues th:;.t are not addressed at Union College. One issue that .-riust be addressed and defmed is the ward administration. Who is · the administration? We must identify who is in charge of what committee so that when problems arise, specific people are made aware and not 'administration'. When this word is defined our problems will be solved much · faster. We, the members of the Student Forum, are new in the process of trying to. bridge the gap between \Administration\ and the ·students of Union. so that we can work under more amiable conditions. Another issue that must be addressed is . · the possible renegotiation of · the social policy for next year. . · I woul(l like to say that an impressive percentage o{ the · Freshman Class has deCided to live on campus in the fall. As a result, more of the future 'sophomores will he particip~ting in activities, whether they be political, social, or educational. A lot .of work has to be done in the future, so come out and vote tomorrow. Hope Vanno As a candidate for sophomore representative, my main goal. shall be making the administration a \mirror image\ of the student's. needs on campus. Many problems, such as the adverse change in the '90-'91 school calendar and · the lack of attendance and involvements at our previous four-day conference, were a result of the . miscommunication between the students and the leaders of the campus-- but who are the real leaders of our campus? In order for Union to remain one of the top schools of the country, the administration must serve more -as a \sounding board\ of the student's needs rather than a constant wall that the students must break through in order to be heard. With more student awareness of the administration's true goals for their policies, I think students would be more inclined to understand and accept their policies. If students become aware of the administration's preliminary ideas before they become the governing policies of Union, we shall have an easier and more successful attempt jn • voicing our Thank you,· · HopeD, V~no .Marc Weintraub __. I am running for class rep for many reasons. The present administration is stagnant. I believe that I can breathe some fresh and vigorous blood into the Student Forum. I have many ideas that would make campus life more enjoyable. I am a man of action and I feel as if that· is what the Student -Forum needs now in order to better life on campus. The present Student Fot:nm has not shown enough progress in bettering the life of the students and impm~ing the relationship between the student body and the administration. Part of the reason that the administration is able to continue making changes in policy that the students do not approve of, is because we have not shown the administration how strongly we disagree with what they are doing. Now is the time to better our relationship with the administration and also show them that we care about what happens to out school. If we show them as a group that we care they will begin coming to us before doing anything drastic, in order to avoid an angry student body. One of the major problems with the Student F.orum today, is the lack of communciation between students on the Forum and the rest of the student body about what happens in the meetings. .I propose that the Student Forum should write a letter every few weeks, informing the student body about what is accomplished at the meetings. This letter will also serve the purpose of keeping the forum more active because it will keep the student body more aware of what is and and is not being acc()mplished. Housing is a prominent concern of the students. There is a serious lack of desired housing down campus, because students dread living up campus in Potter and Raymond. The only people that would be happy living up campus are the Greeks, because if they were given a house there, more desired housing · down campus would become available. Action must be taken in the Student Forum and in the student body in order for · change to occur. Views must be expressed more openly in order for the necessary changes to occur. • f,

Mammola stated, \The. policy in the catalogue was not enforced at a time when the freshman class averaged 530 or 540 students simply because there was not enough room to guarantee housing for upperclassmen.\ As this year's freshman class was under 500 students and next year's freshman class will number· approximately 500, Mammola claimed that the College cannot afford to have a sense of unpredictability in planning and that the only other alternative would be for the College to raise housing costs. In essence, Mammola poiQted to the proposal as a meeting point between the needs of the students and those of the administration. Continued oo page 4 May 17, 1990 ·Elections Yield Fo,ur Run-Offs High Voter Turn-Out Attributed to Success Student Forum elections were a huge saccess thanks to the excellent turnout of Union College voters. The unofficial voter count is 880 students. This is a staggering increase from last year's count. Last year only 35% of the College student body voted. This year that total was almost 45%. The 0.9% increase in student voting can be attributed, in part, to the student rally on Friday, May 11 at 12:20 sponsored by We Care About V. This high voter turnout coincides with the recent trend -of activism at Union College. The outright winners of last week's Student Forum elections are for the S()phomore Class Evans Legros as President, Karen Hli!Witz as Vice President, and Neil Kanterman as Treasurer; for the Junior Class Brendan Clifford as President, and Beth Welch as Vice President; for the Senior Class Elizabeth Dobbs as President, Pete Cowles as Vice President, and J<Jiln Jadhon as Treasurer.

Page 2 CONCORDIENSJS, May 17, 1990 Qinttntrbirnsis NE·WS AN_AL YSIS The Value Of Western Culture foundations of modem thought in the Renaissance and tlle Enlightenment. An example of a Western notion is the concept of \rights\. The general idea has its roots in ancient philisophy and has developed over several ceoturi<;:s. The concept bas been changed and expanded by various thinkers such as J obn Locke. However, the central idea has remained. If we are to understand rights as a part of our heritage, we must learn it as an integral part -of the Westemcultural tradition. The Westem tradition is the basis of our cultural identity today. It is important to ask, how and why are things the way they are. Capitalism, representative democ~acy, and an independent judiciary are all Western creations. To recognize this and study them is not a matter of patting ourselves on the back; an understanding of their history is necessary to reform th~ir deficiencies. In religion, the notion of an individual soul responsible for his or her own salvation is a Western growth. If one is not religious, it is simply a practical exercise to learn how many people in the West think. By DANIEL J. KENIRY The mandatory- study of Western. culture has become an important political topic. The revised New York State social studies c urric uluni now includes the study of non- Western cllltures. There has been a national trend, on various university campuses, to question the value of a Western-based core curriculum. Some institutions have indeed dropped such requirements. The question-- why study the West?-- certainly has legitimacy. The important practical and philosophical Results of the 'Peace Dividend' Table held on Earth Day Union students and faculty ·were given \5 do'llars\ and asked to allocate it among 9 categories which they considered: top prioriUes.

Simply put, · Western philosophy encourages debate. As the Student debate~ the mysteries of life in the university trek, a comparative appro·ach to culture is valu~ble.

REED WHIDDEN The third presidential candidate to visit campus will face another audience of students this morning at 11 :30. Roger H. Hull is presently the president of Beloit College. John Meyer commented that the committee \has been waiting to hear from Hull for quite some time.\ In addition Meyer is \glad to see he finally accepted the invitation to the campus.\ Hull is a graduate of Dartmouth College, and has a law degree from Yale. He also earned an Ll.M. and a S.J.D. from the University of Virginia. He has held professional positions at Syracuse University as Adjunct Professor. He was a Special Assistant to the Chairman of the National Securiy Council. Special Council to the Governor of Virginia, and an Associate at White & Case. Hull has publislled two books and several articles • . Those students in attendance today are welcome to come share their views with John Meyer at an open discussion Thursday, May 22, at 7:30 in Old Chapel. Students met witb Meyer this past Thursday in a discussion of tile first two candidates, England and Taylor. There was close to an even split in the audience's choice for the president. Meyer opened tile forum with remarks on the process which has brought the search this point. He also commented on the makellp of the Committee, and then opened the floor for qllestions and comments. · Martha Downer, '90, asked, \What is the job of the president?\ It was further explained th~t knowing this was difficult because these two candidates are from opposite ends of the spectrum. Meyer defined the position as one that entails fund raisins, leadership for the administration, faculty, and student body, and a leader in the community. In light of these criteria, many distinctions of the two were juK-taposed. Taylor's lack of a Ph.D. was set against England's longstanding career in education. Yet, Taylor's experience in the business world, for some., more than qualified him as a leader for the faculty. His connections in that arena, as one student pointed · out, would be an obvious asset to the school's endowment. Still some students doubted his dedication to higher Continued 011 page 5 same or highel' voter turnout as the initial elections.

He also referred to minorities in a degrading tone. He equated blacks and !Jlinorities and someone noted that they are not the same. In relation to students in general, the student who gave the candidates tours of the campus had much to offer. She described England·s tour as a very personaole one. It was 45 to 50 minutes long and at their meeting \he asked many qtleStions about the .school,\ and she felt very comfortable with him. Taylor's visit was almost 20 minutes shorter, he held a \businessy\ attitude and asked few questions. A final feeling was that while each candidate could do an excellent job, the choice of a third candidate would be ideal. Presidential Commission On Cultural Diversity Continued from page II 3. Encourage serious dialogue among faculty on Ole question of the inclusion within the curriculum .of the perspectives, values, experiences and cultural product of non-western cultures and subcultures within western culture and American culture. 4. Identify ways to make Union· a more welcoming, supportive and energizing place for minority students and women students. At a minimum this would mean attention to making the · transition from home and high scilool to Union, tlle quality of residence life, the environment for learning both inside and outside the classroom and the availability of social and cultural opportunities. 5. Identify ways in which broad participation by Union students in terms abroad can be enlisted in the cause of promoting an apprecation for diversity on the campus. 6. Suggest ways in which minority alumni can be enlisted in the cause of making Union a better place for minority students and indeed for all students. 7. Investigate other topics · whlch are related to the goal of exploring, celebrating and exploiting djfferences in the pursuit of intellectual, social and moral growth.

P~g:e 6 . CONCO'RDIENSIS, May 17J 1990 The Mary Hill By NAMITA RAVAL On Wednesday, May 23, members of Women's Union plan to sell brownies in the College Center, and donate all earnings for the rebuilding of the Mary Hill House, the eleven-year-old shelter for victims of domestic violence that is part of the Schenectady YWCA. The Mary Hill House, located on Washington A venue, was destroyed on February 28 in a fire of unknown origin. The five women and 12 children who were placed there at the time were not injured and were situated in safe homes in the area.

Jeff Gower, a sophomore at Union and his brother Andrew, a senior at Dartmouth, spent eight days helping to build affordable new housing in a low income community in Cbadeston, South Carolina. The two brothers were part of a team of twelve that built the foundation and wooden frame for one home and removed a run~down house at another site in order to begin new construction. The project was . sponsored by Habitate for Humanity, (Americus, GA.), an organization that provides new, low income housing for the poor in the United States and abroad. . . The orgamzatton was founded eleven years ago by the late Clarence Jordan and Milalrd Fuller. Since 1976 the volunteer efforts of .this unique organization have built, rehabilitated or repaired thousands of homes. Habitat is a non-profit organization that relies entirely, on donations from the private sector. It refus·es to accept any government funds., one reason being that it does not want to compete with the many other organizations that desperately Four new houses put up, with shacks in the background. need government assistance.

It is very walkable, and comfortable and at the same time it has so much te offer in terms of music, art, theatre; and architecture. Students .can easily take advantage of cultural events. For example, standing room seats in the world famous· Vienna concert . hall cost only between $1.50 and $2. Vienna also attracts popular pop singers such as Tina Turner. Currently the musicals \Cats\ and \42nd Street\ are playing. You simply can't see it all! There is an abundance of restaurants, and since Union · students are given their daily food allowance in cash, they are able to take advantage of these restaurants and of Vienniese cafes. In these cafes one can simply order a single drink and be entitled to sit for hours and read or talk with friends without being disturbed.

Ans: The students receive instruction in German for 3 hours 5 times a week at tl1e Austro/ American Institute of Education in downtown Vienna. They have 4 teachers who focus on different areas- from German grammar, to conversation, to , Austrian culture. It is interesting that 4 other American colleges also have groups at the Institute this spring-Saint Lawrence, Deleware, Me Alister, and Beaver. In addition, the Institute specializes in teaching Austrians English. A new group of pupils are refugees on their way to America who are using Vienna as a way station.

These styles include romanes- que, gothic, renaissance, baroque, · 19th century \Historismus\. which is a repetition of old styles, and modem styles, among them .the . famous Viennese.:\Jugendstiel\ or art nouveau. We also visited many museums to compare painting styles throughout the centuries. In addition, in late May Prof. Warde will lead a week long field trip from Prague to East Germany, visiting such cities as Dresden, Leipzig, Weimar, and Berlin. .

Yet, at the same time, there are problems that have arisen due to the influx of refugees from Eastern Europe who have come to Austria seeking a better life politically and economically. In contrast to Germany, where East Germans automatically obtain citizenship if they move to the West of Germany, these refugees still retain their own nationalities. Therefore they are viewed as foreigners and there is the problem of integration. These immigrants need immediate aid in terms of housing and employment, and for the fkst time in Vienna there are \street people\. Some resentment has arisen due to the ensuing rise in unemployment. However, in spite of these difficulties, the feeling toward the opening of Eastern Europe is celebratory. Jugendstil 1. 2 .. 3 .. 4. 5. 6. 7 .. 8. Whttt'~ the. wc>rld'sjargest de,pt. store?

By YURI GARBUZOV The capital of Byelorussia is Minsk. I have lived for approximately five years in Minsk, and ,earlier in my lif~, I lived very close to Minsk. Minsk is probably not so unique; but. in relation to aU the other Soviet republics' capitals, Minsk has the most Russian influence next to Moscow. The language a11d street names in Minsk wo11ld lead you to believe that it is even a city in Russia itself. 'To notice that Minsk is in Byelorussia~ one mig:ht recognize that a street namec is Byelorussian here or there. The B yelorussian flags have only recently added to the ever- increasing number ()f B yelorussian street names. During stagnation of the economy~ Byelorussia had an intelligent leader who provided a buffer against actions from the central }OOwer in the Soviet Union. He was Masherov, leader of Byelorussian Communist Party, and he was aided by Mazur()V, representative of Byelorussia in the Politburo. They were popu1ar leaders :m Byelorussia. Everything was done to prevent Byelorussia from c3;tching the economic crisis which now plagues the Soviet Union. During one year, Mazutov was, removed from power, and Masherov then died in a car accident. No one knows exacdy what happened at this time, b11t the two events occuring so closely together were extremely mysterious. This happened very dose to Brezhnev's death, so the hard-line Brezhnev economics never fully took effect in Byelorussia. 0 .K. So, Minsk has not suffered iike cities in other republics, and now it is quiet in comparison to the -rest of the Soviet Union. Minsk is a very pretty town because everybo«ly cares about clean air and the \Everybody goes out on to the street and cooks, eats, gets together, sings, d;mces, and feels like a big family.\ beauty of the city. We are more socialist than the other republics. We did not have such economically stagnating. years which might deter people from communism. And thus, everybody feels close to the city as if it is their own home. They are satisfied with \their villge, their tpwn.\ Minsk is not simply a city. A good example of this is during the Day of Minsk on July 3. Everybody goes out onto the street an(l cooks, eats, gets together. sings, dances, and feels like a big family. And remember, this is outside on the streets of Minsk! It is a very big holiday. But of course, do not think that Minsk is some sort of paradise. We do have some problems which attack us from situations in the Soviet Union. As a member ·Of the Soviet Union we have an obligation to share the burden of economic problems. Also, there are some cultural problems_ In Byelorussia. much more than half of the populatioa was rural about 40 years ago~ Now. the urban population has increased. In Minsk, there are many people who have come from the village arld joined the urban populatio11. Sometimes, these people are not culturally ready to accept this u:rban style of living. For example, in the village. you have your own area of ground, and you can do what you want. ln the city, if you live in a big building with everyone, you must care about how your neighbors will accept your activity. I do not think this is a big problem, however. Overall. Minsk is the place to be in tile Soviet Union. Just come see for yourself. Come join me for a big party in Minsk someday! What Is So Special About the Soviet Union Is That It Is :So Different By MICHAEL GREENBERG International Features Editor Imagine a country where almost every automobile lcoks the same. Of course there are red, blue, green, white a:nd black automobiles; but, in effect, once you can \hot wile\ one car, you can steal any c:ar.

To have a family, to have good time. with friends, 'to know that you are livi11g without having to have a better car than your neighbor-· these are the qualities of Georgian and Soviet life that I fou11d most alien to America. ,; I like to think that the big differences are .•. simp•y a matter of taste -- bread, wine, automobiles.\ Of course, I am not declaring that America is bad. Our free- market economy promoted individuality and, some migllt philosophize, a yearning for more and more material possessions in life. We seem to be running a race for more and mote. More and more what? It does not really matter. The Soviet Union, although some say that it t·epresents the failings of communism (and the Soviet Union never really achieved communism anyway) is the product of extreme socialist ideology. The Soviets might well want more of the technology, more of the economic freedoms that the United States promisies for its citizens; but they already possess a wealth of social relations that I really cannot say has been successfully duplicated in the United States. How much of the Soviet social relations will be retained in the move toward more Western- style economics remains to be seen. There is a· lot that makes the Soviet Union the Soviet Union. Ilike to think that the big dHferences are not economic and political, but simply a matter of taste-- bread, wiae, automobiles.

Bubble Dy DON VALERIO Science & Technology Editor Deaths ·from Passive Smoking The Environmental Protection Agency recently concluded that secondhand cigarette smoke accounts for over 3,000 lungMcancer deaths and a substantial amount of respiratory illness annually in the United States. The issue of the hazards of tobacco smoke to those who do not smoke has been a significant issue, but no official government study had been available until the EPA recently concluded this IS- month study. Although the recommendations of the agency are not legally enforced, they are expected to carry weight with employers and local and state governments. The report suggests that the cheapest way to reduce the hazards is to ban smoking altogether. The EPA has called passive secondhand smoke the most hazardous of indoor air pollutants and it is expected that the agency will now classify tobacco smoke as a Class A, or very hazardous carcinogen. Chemicals such as be-nzene and radon also fall into this category. Prodigy Turns Doctor Balmaurati Ambati, age 12, is currently a third-year premed student at New York University. He hopes to become the youngest medical doctor in history by completing medical school before his 18th birthday. The child prodigy entered -NYU last fall. However, due to hi~ acccelerated course of study, he will complete his third year at the end of May. Ambati, who mastered calculus by the age of 4, currently has a grade point average of 3.8 and top test scores. Flight of Measles Stalls Federal officials have recently reported that the government has run out of money needed to provide emergency vaccinations to fight the recent epidemic of measles. It wili now be up to local and state governments to find the emergency funds. The vaccine costs the government $16 a dose, however, It may cost up to $50 when obtained from a doctor or at a clinic. The vaccine is still available for those who can afford to pay for it. There are now 82 outbreaks of the highly contagious disease in 25 states. Although cases have been reported throughout New York, New Jersey and Connec.ticut, the largest outbreaks have been reported in Los A.ngetes, Houston, and Chicago. In Los Angeles county alone, there have been over 2,000 cases of measles reported this year. Forty-five children died of the disease last year; forty have died in the first four months of this year. · Hazardous Waste Rules Announced The Environmental Protection Agency recently announced its standards for:the treating of hazardous wastes in landfills or in underground wells. The new rules will require dilution or other treatment of approximately 30 million tons of toxic, cormsive, ignitable and reactive wastes, categories representing one-half the hazardous wastes discarded by industry each year. . The rules will gradually take effect over the next two years. and are meant to protect the nation's underground water supply from contamination from dangerous industrial waste chemicals. The newly released treatment requirements fill a 900-page EPA report. Lead Shield .Being Developed To Guard Against Radon In Homes The Lead Industries Association (LIA) today announced a new development employing lead that offers promise as an effective barrier to radon gas in homes. Preliminary results from a new home field test indicate that a sheet lead membrane of liner under the foundation of a home may effectively shield residents from the health hazards of naturaiiy-occurring radon gas. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has identified radon gas as an extremely serious health threat, and in many states, such as New Jersey, where radon levels in soil have been identified as being particularly high, radon- induced lung cancer has been dubbed the \single most serious environmental .health problem\ of the day. \Lead one of the oldest building materials known to man, appears to be a natural choice to guard against the menace of radon gas seeping into homes,\ said Jerome F.

'By WENDY TOWBER and ALYN WHELCHEL The greenhouse effect has become a trendy term in the past few years, but do you really know what it is about, and its implications? Do you know the ,extent of the ~oncerns and facts they are based on? There are sev:era'l gases in the atmosphere surrounding the earth preventing the escape of too much heat form the planet. This is necessary to keep the planet warm. Certain gases-- carbon dioxide, chloroflorocarbons. (CFCs), methane, nitrous .oxide, and ozone-- are responsible for the greenhouse effect. Under normal conditions these gases function successfully. Now, however, due to excess gaseous emi.ssions from styrofoam production and aerosols (CFCs), the buming of fossil fuels (carbon dioxide), and landfills (methane and ozone) the greenhouse effect has the potential to become dangerous. Excess heat that originally could escape becomes trapped, raising the temperature of the earth slightly. You may be psyched for that extended summer, and the extra summer clothes you will get to buy, but the implications run much deeper. The earth does have its own natural warming and cooling trends, but we are disturbing this natural balance. That is where the danger lies. There are facts and figures. supporting both sides of the greenhouse argument, both arguments for and against the effect ()f irre-sponsible human habits. Even though much of the infO:rmation is presently inconclusive it is better to be safe tl1C~n sony. There are many easy things you can do to limit e'l:cess greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Helpfal: Hints: 1) Avoid styrofoam! Ask for paper :products instead. CFCs are used to make and are also givenoffby styrofoam. 2) D<Jn't buy aerosols! They also C()ntain CFCs. 3) Plant a tree! It's the best way t() ,remove c.arbon dioxide from the atmosp·here. and remember, .. \Nebcdy made a greater mistake than he who did nothing because he could only do a litrle.\ -Edmund Burke Rado:n Protection • • Continued from page 10 radon areas.

Next step involved coating the lead barrier with liquid asphaltum, to protect it from the corrosive reaction of the concrete slab that forms the first floor of the home.

The NAflB/NRC expects to have final results on the radon- blocking effectiveness of the lead shield tests in Florida sometime in mid-1990. Meanwhile, the Lead Industries Association is extending the testing to other parts ()f the nation. Here is its step-l>y-step plan: - 111 addition to the Florida sites, test home builders are also being solicited in Alabama and New Jersey. - 'The NAHB National Research Center will again work closely with members of LIA's Fabricated Products Committee to design the sheet lead barricade system for each site. - 'The NAHB National Research Center will also evaluate costs and provide a fiscal summary to both educate builders and enable manubcturers to develop a practical product with effective installation technologies/directions. - 'The NAHB National R~search Center group will again monitor installation of the slieet lead prior to pouring the concrete slab upon completion of the homes.

That reader anonymously left a message on our answering machine deploring our decision. Here, we suggest that the decisions of m.any others before us, as well as those decisions sure to come, are what we should be turning our attention toward. The case of Gregory Oswitt, the star football player and . straight A student who wieided a loaded shotgun in the Shenendehowa High School cafeteri'a, raises many questions about Union College and where its priorities lie, and perhaps about where it lies about its priorities. There is concem t.Qat Mr. Oswitt might someday repeat his actions, this time threatening the security of Union College. At this time, the College has made no decision on Mr. oswitt's status, meaning that he will be attending Union next year, possible incidents between now and then notwithstanding. The admissions office reserves the right to withdraw an offer of acceptance if the circumstances should warrant. These circumstances would seem to dictate some sort of rec<Jnsideration, at least. When the admissions office was queried about Mr. Oswitt's status, they deflected the question to the public relations office. The public relations office announced that there has not been a decision. The only person who was willing to talk about the situation was the football coach, A1 Bagnoli, who described Mr. Oswitt as an exceptional offensive lineman. Coach Bagnoli also said that he has no problem playing Mr. Oswitt if he should be allowed to attend next fall. There have been a number of studies showing that football breeds a certain amount of violence into the psyches of its players. This makes sense-· it is a violent game. There are many examples of the awful entanglement of football and violence at Division 1 schools, and Union has often been called a \Division lli school with a Division 1 mentality.\ This leads to the question: is there a relationship between Mr. Oswitt's initial admission and/or the lack of reconsideration of his admission, and his superior football skills? Tightening The Chains That Bind The Greeks Just when members of Union College Greek organizations thought it was safe to swim in the sea of the administration, a shark appears to create an even greater rift in .alr:eady choppy waters. If adopted, the newly proposed changes in the college's housing and dining policies are sure to have a ·dangerous effect on the future stability of fraternities and sororities at Union. In light of the procedures by which the administration initiated the social policies enacted winter tenn, it seems as though the idea of trust has gone to the wind. In a letter sent from the administration to (among other college organizations), the Student Forum it was detennined that no college policy would be adopted without first giving students notification of the proposal five weeks in advance. While the administration appears to be open to suggestions concerning the proposed meal plan changes for students, it does not appear that students will have a chance to reverse the proposed housing policy. One can suppose that on the surface the administration is playing fair; the final verdict however will come in June when not surprisingly enough, the proposal will go before the Board of Trustees, and the students, who the policy directly affects, will be home for summer break far removed from the goings on of the college. Members of the administration claim that the unpredictability associated with college housing and dining constituents is the motivating force behind this new proposal. If such is the case, why is it up to the college's Greek organizations to bear the brunt of this unpredictability'? It is clear that no l>ne would directly identify this as the administration's intentions, but inherently, the implications are obvious. By forcing all sophomores to live in campus housing, the administration puts the viability of all Greek organizations in Jeopardy. Requiring all sgphmores to live in campus housing and that their meals at the College's dining facilities robs the Greeks of their sense of unity. It i~ up to members of these organizations ~o take action now a$ainst_ this proposal whi~e there still is ttme.

They did a commendable job. Moreover, I wou:ld like to congratulate Dean Mammola. You really pulled the wool over . the students' eyes, this time. You transformed what was to be an expression of student anger into a passive pep rally. By paying for and sponsoring the rally, it reminds me of the May Day parades in Moscow when the government gives the citizens the banners to the citizens. The citizens are not allowed to speak on their own accord. Well, Dean Mammola, you came off as the Stalin of Schenectady. As Tim Samms said only \positive things aFe allowed to be said.\ You censored negative comments out. But negative feeling still persists within the student body. The students can only be fooled for a small amount of time. If we do not get .a more responsive admin:lstraticm soon, the students will just become angrier. The protesters will become more aggr.essive. The organizers of the past protest ,became tools in ~mmola's political box. The protest patronized the students iilto temporary submission. I'm sure more aggressive protests will help Marnmola be convinced that will not be igncred. The protest was definitely a right sl:a:Ft. But in almo~t ~yety single protest in history a mixture of peaceful and more aggt:essive methds are needed. The combination of Martin Luther King and Malcolm X is a perfect example of this combination. While Union is obviously on a much smaller scale, the aggressive protesters are just waiting for their call. They .are waiting for continued unres'ponsivenes'S from Mammola to spark them. A mere pep rally will not cbang,e an irresponsible dictatorship·. which is in a smaller sense what the administration is. They have no obligation to listen to the students. The students are going to have to fight for their .power. The singing. of the Alma Mater will not help anything. The students must warn Mammola that we will become aggressive.. Does anyone want to hold a sit-in or storm a building with tne? Because i:f you dan't Union will pay the cost of a self- s.erving, dominating administration.

But what good is it to care, act and complain about Union if you don't invest a little time in its future? Last Thursday night John Meyer gave us. the students, a chance to speak up about what we liked and disliked about the presidential candidates, the men tltat may decide the future of Union long after we have graduated, and approximately thirty students bothered to take the time to\come. :Before you say that you had no clue that tltis session was even taking place, the meeting was announced in the Concordiensis, in an ad as large as the one publicizing the question session with the candidates, though we did not receive a notice in our mailboxes. The low attendance makes me qustion the motives of the students who seem to be interested. Did the majority of the students who showed up to the question periods really care? Or were they there merely because someone told them to go? The overwhelming evidence leads me to believe that the elevated student interest is a mirage. John is the one student who carries a vote in the decision process. Though his vote is only one out of nine, as the student vote, his opinion carries more weight than we might expect. In an era at Union when student awareness is highet than it's been since I've been here, and when there seems to be a genuine concern about the ftlture, I'd expect more of the student body to voice their opinions. Please reconsider how you spend that one hour after dinner next time John holds a session. We will be lucky enough to have another chance after the third candidate is met.

Good l\ttorriing Richmond To the Editor: When 1 signed a ~ousing contract to live in Richtn()nd, no one ever told me that I was going to be treated to fraternity pledges singing at my wind()w. Shortly after seven o!clock this morning, I was awoken by male voices saying \Good Morning Richmond.\ I then knew that I was going t& be subjected to hearing the same string of profanities that l had ·heard just the morning bef<Jre. I am sure that there are plenty of people in this dorm, and in other dotms, who would not wishfully choose to listen to this trash. I would like to tbink that college students ahve more productive things to do with their time than to waste it by making up and memorizing sexually perverse lyrics: I guess that the point of all of this is to 'humiliate pledges. hut these profanities .are far more degrading to the women who have to listen to them than to the pledges reciting them. As I see it, it is embarrassing epough to ,even want to belong to such a pathetic conformist group. If this is the only way that fraternity brothers can think of to humiliate their pledges,, then l · am both surprised and disgusted with their limited capacity to form original or good ideas. There are obviously plenty of alternative ways to embarrass pledges in pt!blic without offending everyone else at the same time.

Looking foward to seeing you there, Erika Studint, Co-Chahwoman of \Take Back The Night\ Hell Week Wears Down Professor · To the Editors: I'm having a great time this term teaching a group of • bright, motivated. freshmen in Preceptorial. But some of .these students will end the term having learned less, and receiving lower grades, because of a strange, inappropriate,. · twisted custom called Hell Week. One student missed the first two classes of the term. He appeared at the third, clearly disoriented. I brought him into my office, to help him catch. up on his missed work. He fell asleep as I was talking t() him. (In lilY sixteen years at Union, that's a first!) His absence cost him a zero on our first quiz,. and he was still behind the class for the second quiz. Today two students appeared in class disheveled, unshaven, and without the text. They giggled, clowned, and nodded off. In our class of twelve students, their an.tics made it very difficult to carry on a discussion of the Communist Man.ifesto. Mter class, I cornered them. \What gives?\ I asked. With an air of great mystery, they informed me that they \were not at liberty to explain\ - as if I should understand, and excuse, their conduct. As an undergraduate, I belonged to a fraternity. Our initiation consisted of a five- hout evening meeting, plus a series of shorter meetings in -the following two weeks, at which we broke into small groups and discussed ourselves and our relation to the world. I'll never forg~t that experience or the bonds which grew among us over the subsequent three years. Union's sororities initiate their pledges. As far- as I can see, sororities are as cohesive as fraternities. But they don't send their members to class drunk, or endanger their health through sleep deprivation. Indeed', some sororities use Hell Week to encourage habits of self-discipline and study. Aud some fraternity pledges srend the week cleaning and reJ)airing their houses, instead of getting drunk and putting tl!eir fists through the walls. l wish to send a strong message, and a challenge, to U11ion's fraternities. This b()ozy version of Hell Week is a primitive rite, which injures y()ur members. Come into the twentieth century. Find a co-nstructive way to create a feeling of commitment. I dtallenge the IFC to debate, aad pass, a policy that Jhe use of alcohol and of sleep deprivation should not be e11couraged during Hell Week. If you address this issue, it will help me regain the respect for Union's Greeks which I lost this week. Sincerely, Bruce L. Reynolds, Economics Only Shades of Grey To the Editor: I am sitting writing a letter I have bee11 wanting to write since winter term. The reason I am writing it now is due to a story my friend shared with me after one of his classes. Now this letter is not an attack on anyone, it is only cpinion and the way in which 1 feel about this topic .. In my friend's class they had a discussion about fraternities on campus. The .professor stressed how fratemiiies on campus are wrong and therefore should not be here. I can only speak on behalf of my own fraternity. but I am sure others agree, that we do realize that a change must come abo.at in our behavior, so that we address more educational and community aspects, not just social. What really disturbed me was that the professor said fraternities should l:le abolished because they are wrong. I do not understand what wrong is. In whose eyes is it wrong? A · professor's? Society~s? Do yo11 really have the authority ta judge what is right or wrong? I really do not think that you ca11 apply the concept cf right and wrong to certain activities. For example, what is the right way to raise a child or to choose your career? I do not think that there is a right or wrong way to live your life. Look at it this way: you cannot tell me I am wrong for being a Catholic; nor can. I say it is wrong to be a Mormon, or a. Jew, or a Baptist. When you do this you start to see the world as black and white. I have learned that in life there is no pure black or pure white, only shades of gray. What I find even more disturbing and kind of odd is that a professor thinks the way I choose to live my life, by being a devoted member to my fraternity, is wrong. When someone tells me the way I live my life is wrong I see that as ignorant. Don't get me wrong; I do take advice, but I cannot accept someone thinking they are so superior to me by telling me I am wrong. But isn't it kind of ironic that such an ignorant and narrow- minded individual is teaching us? To be perfectly honest with you I learn more in one house meeting than I have in some comses, all year, and learning is why I came to Union. Why do you want to take away my bi{ggest teacher in life, my fra1emity? I think the problem for both fraternities and faculty has to do with respect. I feel that I earn respect by respecting ot!lers. I refuse to just respect someone simply on the bas's of the title or position tl1at the:y hold. I do realize that we, like all fr<tternities, need to change. What I am asking, and the main reason I am writing this letter. is that you help us and work with us. Two closed hands will never clasp. Even if just one hand opens up it alone will not be able to hang on for long. it takes both of the fists opening up to clasp the hands in harmony. I feel I do not dictate what you should teach n01r should you tell me what I sh()uld learn. The best teachers are great learners. and I think tl!at if you give us a chance y()u will see that there is more to us than just a bottle of beer;: likewise there is probably more to you than just what yu write Oil the blackboard. Sincerely, Michael J. Feeney

Good l\r1oming Richmond To the Editor: When I signed a housing contract to live in Richmond, no one ever told me that I was going to be treated to fraternity pledges singing at my window. Shortly after seven o'clock this morning, I was awoken by male voices saying \Good MorNing Richmond.\ I then knew that I was goiRg to be subjected to hearing the sam.e striNg of profanities that I had heard just the morning before. I am sure that there are .plenty of people in this dorm, and in other dorms, who wotlld not wishfully choose to listen to this trash. I woald like to think that college students ahve more productive things to do with their time than to waste it by making up and memorizing sexually perverse lyrics. I guess that the point of all of this is to hlimiliate pledges, but these profanities are far more degrading to the women who have to listen to them than to the pledges reciting them. As I see it, it is embarrassing enough to even want to belong to such a pathetic conformist group. If this is the only way that fraternity brothers can think of to humiliate their pledges, then I am both surprised and disgusted with their limited capacity to form original or good ideas. There are obviously plenty of alternative ways to embarrass pledges in public without offending everyone else at the same time. Jennifer Park Beth Ann Isenberg \Big\ Thanks for Fundraiser To the Editor: I would like to take the opportunity to thank Union College and most especially the Greek Cornm unity for the wonderful support everyone has shown Big Brothers/Big Sisters. Currently Dave Andleman of Figi has been organizing a Union College Greek Beach Volleyball Tournament to benefit Big Brothers/Big Sisters on May 25-27. Although the tournament is still two weeks away, a sum in excess of $7,000 has been raised! I would like to express our appreciation to Dave, all the members of Figi (especially the hard working pledges) and Sigma Delta Tau for getting the tournament set up. I'd also like to thank all of the Greek Community for their enthusiasm in signing up to participate. I'll be cheering for aU the teams because you are all winners! · Funds raised through the tournament will be earmarked for encouraging additional Union students to have an opportunity to become a \Big.\ We are exploring the possibility of purchasing a car or van to provide Union College Bigs with reliable transportation.

The rally will be starting at 8:30 P.M., in front of the· Chester A. Arthur statue, with short speeches given from various members of the URioE Colilege and Schenectady communities including Schenectady Mayor Karen Johnson. Following the speakers, we will start on a march through the campus and the surrounding streets where many Union College students live. We earnestly urge all of the Union community to join us in this effort. We would like to invite all clubs, dorms, departmeNts and individuals to attend this event. Each club, dorm and department is encouraged to walk together in a group, proudly bearing a banner stating the nam~. of their organization. For safety purpOtses, everyone parti- cipating is asked to wear light- colorc<l, reflective clothing and to carry a f1ashlight. Anyone interested in joining 1:1s in this effort or with any further questions can contact me to Box 2045 or ut 370- 3656. If we all join together we REALLY CAN make this a success!! Loobng foward to seeing you there, Erika Studint, Co-Chairwoman of 'Take Back The Night\ Hell Week Wears Down Professor To the Editors: I'm having a great time this term teaching a group of bright, motivated freshmen in Preceptorial. But some of these students will end the term having learned less, and receiving lower grades, because of a strange, inappropriate, twisted custom called Hell Week. One student missed tbe first two classes of the term. He appeared at the third, clearly disoriented. I brought him into my office, to help him catch up on his missed work. He fell asleep as I was talking to him. (In my sixteen years at Union, that's a first!) His absence cost him a zero on our first quiz, and he was still behind the class for the second quiz. Today two students appeared in class disheveled, unshaven, and without the tex.t. They giggled, clowned, and nodded off. In our class of twelve students, their antics made it very difficult to carry on a discussion of the Communist Manifesto. After class, I cornered them. \What gives?\ I asked. With an air of great mystery, they informed me that they \were not at liberty to explain\ - as if I should understand, and excuse, 1heir conduct. As an undergraduate, I belonged to a fraternity. Our initiation. consisted of a five- hour evening meeting, plus a series of shorter meetings in the following two weeks, at which we broke into small groups and discussed ourselves and our relation to the world. I'll never forget that experience or the bonds which grew among us over the subsequent three years. Union's sororities initiate their pledges. As far as I can see, sororities are as cohesive as fraternities. But they don't send their members to class drunk, or endanger their health throu:gh sleep deprivation. Indec<l, some sororities use Hell Week to encourage habits of sell.f-discipline and study. And some fraternity pledges spend the week cleaning and repairing their houses, instead of getting drunk and putting their fists through the walls. I wish to send a strong message, and a challenge, to Union's fraternities. This boozy version of Hell Week is a primitive rite, which injures your members. Come into the t went ie th century. Find a constructive way to create a feelillg of commitment. I challc:nge the IFC to debate, and -pass, a policy that the usc of akohol and of sleep depri-vation should not be enco11raged during Hell Week. If yoli address this issue, it will help 111e regain the respect for Unio11's Greeks which I lost this week. Sincerely, Bruce L. Reynolds, Economics Only Shades of Grey To the Editor: I am sitting writing a letter I have been wanting to write since winter term. The reason I am writing it now is due to a story my friend shared with me after one of his classes. Now this letter is not an attack on anyone, it is only opini()n and the way in wilich I feel about this topic. In my friend's class they had a discussion about fraternities on campus. The professor stressed how fraternities on campus are wrong and therefore should not be here. I can only speak on behalf of my own fraternity, but I am sure others agree, that we do realize that a change must come about in our behavior, so that we address more educational and community aspects, not just social. What really disturbed me was that the professor said fraternities should be abolished because they are wrong. I do not understand what wrong is. In whose eyes is it wrong? A professor's? Society's? Do you really have the authority to judge what is right or wrong? I really do not think that you can apply the concept of right and wrong to certain activities. For example, what is the right way to raise a child or to choose your career? I do not think that there is a right or wrong way to live your life. Look at it this way: you cannot tell me I am wrong for being a Catholic; nor can I say it is wrong to be a Mormon, or a Jew, or a Baptist. When you do this you start to see the world as black and white. I have learned that in life there is no pure black or pure white, only shades of gray. What I find even more disturbing and kind of odd is that a professor thinks the way I choose to live my life, by being a devoted member to my fraternity, is wrong. When someone tells me the way I live my life is wrong I see that as ignorant. Don't get me wrong; I do take advice, but I cannot accept someone thinking they are so superior to me by telling me I am wrong. But isn't it kind of ironic that such an ignorant and narrow- minded individual is teaching us? To be perfectly honest with you I learn more in one house meeting than I have in some courses, all year, and learning is why I came to Union. Why do you want to take away my biggest teacher in life, my fraternity? I think the problem for both fraternities and faculty has to do with respect. I feel that I ~ respect by respecting others. I refuse to just respect someone simply on the basis of the title or position that they hold. I do. realize that we, like all fraternities, need to change. What I am asking, and the main reason I am writing this letter, is that you help us and work with us. Two closed hands will never clasp. Even if just one hand opens up it alone will nol be able to hang on for long. lt takes both of the fists opening up to clasp the hands in harmony.

The best teachers are great learners, and I think that if you give us a chance you will see that there is more to us dian just a bottle of beer; likewise there is probably more to yo11 than just what yu write on the blackboard\ Sincerely, Michael J.

! , .., I - .. , , ' • , \' f • ll Page 14 CONCORDJENSIS, May 17, 1990 LETTERS Premature Judgment Irresponsible Finance· Funds Addressed To the Editor: We are wtiting in response to the editotial which appeared in the May lOth issue: \Gentlemen May I Have the Envelope Please?\ Our primary objection is the fact that you indicated a preference before all the candidates had visited campus. In your feature article concerning the presidential search, it was suggested that there might be other candidates besides England and Taylor.Given this fact, it was irresponsible to publish your personal preference. Any candidate who appears from this point on could be unfairly compared to Taylor, not only by your editorial staff but the student body at large. Hopefully, Union students are intelligent enough to wait until all the candidates have visited campus before passing judgment. he would have appeared in a similar light. Further, you praise Mr. Taylor's use of students' names while answering questions. Mr. Taylor is a former television executive; no doubt he learned techniques like this from his experiences in the media. Such techniques do not necessarily indicate that Mr. Taylor is capable of establishing better rapport with students than Dr. England. Mr. Taylor's ability to handle the \spotlight\ is surely another holdover from his experiences at CBS. connections. ¥.resident Morris lacks these so .. called connections, yet during his tenure as president the endowment increased from $30 million to $9() million. You praised :Mr. Taylor's promise to stay on camp11s; the president must leave campus to engage in solicitatien of funds, especially large donations from prestigious alumni. Even if Mr. Taylor raises more funds due to his. connections, this will not elimi11ate the need for fundraising. Much of the money raised by the Annual Fund comes from the ordinary alumnus whO\ cannot always make the big donation but still. .gives something. We can never eliminate the need to solicit contributions from these alumni. Whet:her Mr. Taylor, Dr. England €1r someone else is the next president, fundraising will still be an aspect of Union which needs to be addressed. To tile Editor: 'rile :purpose of this letter is to answer some of the questions that students may have regarding the stud.ent activities fund~ As a result of the measles, Ed Bradley and the Ps)'chedelic Furs had to be camcelled. The funds from the FUJJs were returned to the fund; however, the money belongs to the Concert Committee and wm be used by the committee before thi·S year is ov:er (e.g. some money will be allocated to Greek week). Ed Bradley still has the $6;000 deposit, an<i even though there's an \act of God\ clause in the contract, he wants us te reschedule. Alillough it is not mandatory for us to resechedule, it may be co~tly for us to do so (due to legal fees). Therefore, the remaining $9,000 of his comtract will ;be held over to ne:xt year .and added to the Sp.eaker's Forum budget. Another question that many stocients have is whether their clubs will receive the money that they requested in their- budget proposals. This is a difficult question to answer~ and sometimes the numbers speak better than words. For example, this year tbere was a total request of roughly $450,000. Unfortunately, the student activities fund only contains around $305,:000 that can be allocated (net.ofthe debt adjuster). Obviously, sorne cuts will have to be made. So, to increase the likelihood .of .receiving the money that your club needs for next year, I suggest lhat clubs which haven't met with their finanQe reps do so bnmediat~ly (by the weekend): In closing, I am including a list of student activities scheduled for the remainder of the term- .. starting tonight witb Dave Binder on tire College Center patio at 8 p.m. Get the most of your student activities fee and attend some of them-- it would be great to see you there! . Thank you, Mark Richter Student Activities Schedule Appears on the bottom of page 15 You criticized Dr. England's lack of intimacy with his audience suggesting it was a significant flaw in his presentation. While you do mention the sudden change of venue and lack of microphones, they are not presented as the reason for the distance between England and his audience. It is extremely likely that if Mr. Taylor had spoken under the same conditions as Dr. England Mr. Taylor's promise to spend more than half of his time on campus was praised as one of his greatest attributes. But who is to say that we need a president who spends '!lis time in Schenectady? In order for a college president to effectively manage the institution, he or she must visit other campuses to see how they are run. Union's president is her ambassador to the world. By traveling, both at home and abroad, he helps increase Union's prestige. Isn't it better to have a president who is known as a lecturer than as a homebody? Another \benefit\ of Mr. Taylor as Union's next president is his alleged ability to raise \more funds with less fundraising\ due to his Finally is the reference to the \much needed business aspect\ which Mr. Tay,lor can provide. Union has always been, and will continue to be, a liberal arts college. Why does she need a business aspect? The. primary goal of Union is to provide her students with a well-rounded education.

, ., ' ), l Revealing Schedules Indeed to the Editor: So, O.K. Michael Schulitz seems to have bee.n off the mark when he implied that many professors ,at Union College do not w<lrk forty hours a week, but tbat does not excuse the atrocities displayed by a certain m!-m.ber of professors .employed by Union College. In :particular, Professor Robert Balcer, Adrian Frazier, and Anne Scott, who so graciously provided the college community access to their ·personal sche<!ules from May 3rd through May 7th. Analysis. of these three schedules have le;d me to conclusions which 1 cannot ignore and feel obligated tG bring to the attention of the Coll~ge. The important revelations which I discovered while examining the schedules of the three professors were as follows: 1) that all three professors seemed tO<Spend too much time in the shower, 2) that an three professors seemed to lack the recommended daily allowance . of essential vitamins and minerals and, 3} that all three professors displayed less than adequate table manners during meals. Sincerely, Kirk Bleemer Researching What It's All About To the Editor: I .am tired of re:ading in Concord.iensis, most recently in Mic..hael 0. Schulitz's second diatri.be (May 10 issue), that NCUR was somehow a disservice to Union's own stude11ts. Yes, I am just as angry as aJ}yone else about the mishandling of on- campus publicity for -this event and the resulting feeling by non-participating stadents that they were unwelco111e. But has anyone asked the many Union students who pr es:ented original research at NCUR whether they felt heft out or disserved by Union's. '110sting of NCUR? The questbn answers itself. · Which brings me to a pQint that I missed seeing in the'first wave of responses to Schulitz. Definitely in the case .of the laboratory-based siences (just ask my three current independent-research students), and ideally in all disciplines, most research at a college like Union is done i n collaboration with undergraduate students-- which is what NCUR was all about. Such research is not opposed to teaching, IT IS TEACHING, and the most effective kind of teaching that exists, in my humble opinion.

My name is Peter Katz, nd I'm running for Student Forum Vice President ef Academies.\ Before anyone asks, yes, I know the elections were last week. If things worked properly and fairly, without double standards, the rest of my statement would have appeared n last. week's edition. It didn't. i Three days before the election I r eceived notice that I would not be allowed to run because I am planning to go on a term abroad to China. After checking the Student Handbook, I found out this was mdeed the policy. \All elected members must be in residence at Union for their entire term of office.\ see no reason why someone can't be on a term abroad and still be on the Student Forum. I have heard numerous arguments that you can•t be effective if you're away. I agree wholeheartedly. This argument is probably valid. But why should the Student Forum make that determination? Why can't students take it into consideration before they cast their l>allot? Following the reasoning above, wily doosn't the Student Forum just appoint people who will do the best job without consulting the student body? It should be the decision of the voters as to who is q~alified and who isn't. Is or is not that the entire point of an election? Wily sh<>uld term abroad students be sillgled out like felons? If Jleople feel being away for a term· is not acceptable, then t:hat person won't be elected. If people feel that he or she is the best qualified, then obviously the student body is willing to have their representative away for a term. Why should that he prevented? My next statement may seem hypocritical, and it is in a way, but I mention it anyway to show the injustice of the system. this question: When he ran for office, he didn't know he was going away. The way the system works, only people going away in the fall can't run because they're the only ones who know prior to the elections that they'll be away the following year. IS THIS FAIR? I also would like to know why John Meier is still on the Student Forum. Why wasn't the issue confronted the moment the Student Forum found out about his trip? It certainly was handled quickly in my case-- as well as at least' one other case this year (This other person was going to run against me. I mention this for those who think this letter is sour grapes.). I wonder how we as students can rally and protest and demand things from the Administration and Faculty when we don't even fulfill .... these demands ourselves. How can we expect the Administration and Faculty to be fair when we, ourselves, create double standards and break our own rules? Let's not revert back to the ideas of slave owners who wanted representation and no taxation. We as students must be mature in our self-government before we can criticize, question, and demand things from others. Let's do something about it so we CAN make Union a better, just place. I was sitting in <Je<>logy the other day concentrating on subduction zones a~td Oceanic Crust when my attention turned to the sink .positioned near the blackboard. Water was dripping from the f2ucet at a rate of 2-3 drops peF second. I thought of my floor with the leaking bathroom sillks and the toilet that sometimes runs two minutes longer than it should. I remembered the utility sink next to· my room that.does not drip, but actually flo'WS when it is supposedly turned off. Last week's article boy S.E.A. provided useful inf~:rmation on how students could contribute to water conserva:tion. Yet, when one considers the state of some of the plumbing facilities on campus it is questionable if these practices will have any significance. What incentive is thete for a student to save water if after they shut the faucet off it continues to drip? Students as well as the college should do their part fot water conservation. Most of these problems could probably be taken care of by replacing a few washers and tightening some bolts. With the prope maintenance of equipment and participation by all members o the campus, Union can do its part to help preserve an important natural resource. f. I was quite upset-- for the obvious reason of not being able to run; but more so for other less conspicuous reasons. First of all, attached to the petition was a sheet of guidelines for the candidates. One would assume that somewhere on those guidelines there would be :the stipulation concerning terms abroad. There wasn't. I found out these guidelines are the· responsibility of the Vice President of Administration-- Michael 0. Schulitz. I find it quite ironic that Mr. Schuli~z is exhausting so much of hts time and energy on making sure that the teaching is up to snuff; w,hile at the same time he is negligent in his own duties as a member of the student government. Last year, John Meier. the junior, was elected Junior Trustee. Presently, Mr. Meier is away in Washington, DC. HOW IS THIS ALLOWED? I've spoken to members of the Student Forum who have said that Mr. Meier is still a member of that b()dy, WHY WAS HE ALLOWED TO RUN?

In order to ensure that Union will be an institution of higher learning that produces liberally educated students, it is vital to have a president who will put academics above all else. Union will increase its prestige, as well as attract new students, if she continues to focus on academics. Additionally. it is the colleges that demonstrate excellence in academics which receive prestigious grants. It seems logical that the proper person to steer .the course ()f a liberal arts college is an a c a d e m i c i a 11 not a businessman. Until all the candidates have visited Union and informed the community of theit goals, we will withhold our judgment about who should be the next president.

Page 16 CONCORDIENSIS, May 17, 199(1 LETTERS Sociology Department to Resolve ''Racial\ Conflict ALAS Methodology Counterproductive To the Editor: We would like to express our support and admiration for the courageous effort of the Sociology Department to resolve a conflict which occurred in a classroom. The SociologyDepartment caned a forum on May 9th to discuss the implications of theoretical material presented in a class that offended two Afro- American women in that class. After the forum, however, both students and teachers walked away feeling hurt, confused, and as if nothing had been resolved. There was frustration in that room and the frustration is justified on this conservative, white majority campus. As spectators, we noticed the heated confusion. Statements were t$en out of context and words were said that were mfsunderstood by both students and faculty. It did not seem that anyone was listening to what was said. The Sociology Department apologized alld clarified their statements, that were inferred as racist, and vowed to change the presentation of this material in lectures. The Sociology Department, by requesting suggestions from the students, demonstrated a sincere concern for the needs of the multi-cultural student body. An example of this was a call from Afro and Latino-centric literature to reconstruct the curriculum. This merits praise as a step in the right direction. The Sociology Department heard the students' complaints, offered solution.s and encouraged student participation unlike other administrative offices. The Sociology Department dared to give the students a chance to change their education when they thought it was .presented wrongly; we should commend them and work with them to make appropriate changes.

I have decided not to include the obligatory statement here that I am not a racist; this is a judgment which should be made only by those who know me personally, from a perspective not limited only to these few paragraphs. I seek a public clarification of ALAS's demands and the rationale behind them (They are demands; a request accompanied by a threat of action is not a request.) In the future, I would like several subjects to be . , discussed. First of all, ALAS demands that within six years, the Union faculty must be 15% Black and Latino. Depending on one's definition of \faculty this would be at least fifteen to twenty faculty members; at present, according to ALAS, Union has only two. Where will these people COf!le from? Will the pool of qualified candidates increase tenfold in only six years? Impossible. Afso, if Union is interested in hiring Black and Latino p-ofessors, as I believe it is, it is reasonable to assume that other schools are too. Despite any amount of effort by the Administration, they will fall short of ALAS's demand. One cannot plant a garden without seeds. Where should Union find these people? ALAS also demands the establishment of certain academic departments which do not now exist at Union. I do Introducing not object to the content of these departments: they are subjects worthy of study. However, Union is a private institution; I believe one has the right to request that certain courses be offered, and the college is obliged to consider the request, but no one has the right to demand a particular course. Tltere are certainly many other institutions which offer the programs ALAS has demanded, and many of these schools' programs are undoubted.ly better than Union's will ever be. Why not cross-register at SUNY- Albany? This demand resembles a person's entering a butcher shop and demanding to be sold a hammer and nails. The butcher is under no obligation, and neither is Union. ALAS feels it is. Why? As for making a multi- cultural course mandatory for freshmen, I offer myself as an example. My future lies in the field of nuclear propulsion; Union offers a course in Nuclear Engineerig, but there is no nuclear Engineering department. Do I have the right to require some poor, unsuspecting freshman to learn about neutrons, isotopes and critical masses? Do I have the right to demand a Nuclear Engineering department when a superb department exists at R.P.I.? Perhaps ALAS considers tlleir course more ''important than mine, but they haven't tried very hard to convince me of this. ALAS considers the reasons behind all their demands to be obvious. They are not. Explain them, ALAS. In the list of ALAS's \activities and run-ins\ for the • • • • entry: \Courses that deal with , \(members from A.L.A.S.)

Page 16 CONCORDIENS!S, May 17, 1990 LETTERS Sociology Department to Resolve \Racial\ Conflict To Lbc Editor: We would like to express our support and admiration for the courageous effort of the Socioiogy Department to resolve a conflict which occurred in a classroom. The . SociologyDepartment called a forum on May 9th to discuss the implications of theoretical material presented in a class that offended two Afro- American women in that class. After the forum, however, both students and teachers walked away feeling hurt, confused, and as if nothing had been resolved. There was frustration in that room and the frustration is justified on this conservative, white majority campus. As specta:tms, we noticed the heated confusion. Statements were takcB out of context and words were said that were misunderstood by both students and faculty. It did not seem that anyone was listening to what was said. The Sociology Department apologized and clarified their statements, that were inferred as racist, and vowed to change the presentation of this material in lectures. The Sociology Department, by requesting suggestions from the students, demonstrated a sincere concern for the needs of the multi-cultural student body. An example of this was a call from Afro and Latino-centric literatl!l.re to reconstruct the curriculum. This merits praise as a step in the right direction. The Sociology Department heard the students' complaints, offered solutions and encouraged student participation unlike other administrative offices. The Sociology Department dared to give the students a chance to change their ed1:1cation when they thought it was presented wrongly; we should commend them and work with them to make appropriate changes. Larissa Lucas, '91 Teresita Camacho, '91 ALAS Demands Deemed Incomplete To the Editor: I write in the sincerest hope of inspiring further public discussion and debate concerning the recent list of requests made of the Board of Trustees by ALAS.

Gregory Rybarczyk The Collegian Anyone interested in working with other students in the Capitol District - Saratoga Area to produce an Inter-Campus Newspaper, Please contact Erika at Box 2045 or at 370-3656. ALAS Methodology Counterproductive To the Editor: I feel it important to address the May 10 articles titled \A.L.A.S. Seeks Greater Cultural Diversity\ and \A.L.A.S. Letters to Trustees\ due to the tone with which they were written and the nature of some of the issues raised. Upon first, and indeed second, third and fourth readings, the articles possessed a violent. militaristic tone which is unacceptable in an intellectual and hopefully rational community. I begaA to wonder if perhaps A.L.A.S. was holding for hostage family members of the Administration and the Board ofTrustees, and if lhe original Letter to the Editor was written with letters cut out of newspapers and glued to a blank white sheet of paper. Quoting the articles. \(members from A.L.A.S.) will be at Hale House at 4:00 p.m. on Friday to receive the communique\' expecting an \immediate commitment from (the Borud of Trustees)\ that will \employ every tactic to fulfill A.L.A.S .'s request\. How did you want this, in small, 1:1nmarked bills? Did you expect a helicopter flown by Dean Mammola to South America? In an intellectual community, such as Union College, these types of demands simply can not be tolerated. The road to change can only come through diplomatic means; meaning calm, rational discussion that does not give ultimatums with the \do it or else\ overtones employed by terrorists. 1 understand your position, and the apparent lack of response by the Administration and the Board of Trustees. I also do not object to you trying to change the community for what you think is the better, for that is somethi,ng we all, as Americans, have the right, indeed the duty, to do. The brass tone and the terrorist nature with which you attempted this, however, is counterproductive both to your ideas for change and support from the college community. Turning to some of the issues which were addressed, you describe multiculturalism as \not (just) the right thing to do but ... the ONLY thing to do\. Who is to say that it wilL be \within the campus\ best interest that we act now\? Thi~ is upsetting, for it i~ something for the college community as a whole t() dedde. I have not seen evidence to date which lends credence to this. In fact, I am not even sure ti1at the campus is certain what exactly multiculturalism is. I am certain, however, that as long as there are over two ~housand students at Union Colilege, and as long as this country remains a Democtacy, every one of us deserves input into the policies which will affect the community, and not just a small group, be it the Administration or A.L.A.S. Is this not what all of the unrest of late centers around, that the student body is not being heard? Do you expect us not to be heard just because it suits your demands? Might I remind you that you too are members of the community, and you should respect OIU' rights as a group. You state that among your goals is \to integrate (your) (substituted for 'our') people, .. \ into the Campus community, a noble goal. Yet the mere title of your organization, the African and Latino Alliance of Students, establishes the segregation which we are trying to dissolve bere and in the United States. There is not even reference to the good old U.S. of A. in your title. Though I do not agree with the title \African American\ either, for others do not need to call themselves \Asian Americans\ or \English Americans\ at least this title includes the country which we all live in; the common bond which holds diverse groufls together and provides a core set of traditions and values whkh facilitate integration.

Pick your body up from in front of the T.V., and go out!! Have fun ... Something great is just waiting to happen. TAURUS: Yes, it's true - you made it through mid-terms without too many headaches. But even though it's spring, work is still important. Try to open up at least one book before tenth week, or you could regret it. GEMINI: Hey! You're looking pretty good, and people are noticing. So take advantage of this outstandig social opportunity while it lasts. CANCER: Are you having problems commuicating with others? Don't retreat into your shell or tum into a crab, just get it all out into the open and laugh about it (or find new friends!). LEO: So, one of your adventures led to a disaster? It's happened before, and it will happen again, so suck it up, and stop using a crutch to lean on. Just be careful the next time you decide to pounce. VIRGO: Where have you been? Your friends miss you, because you've been ditching them for your schoolwork. Stop panicking. You're doing more work than any other person on this campus is doing, so you'll be fine grade-wise. LIBRA: Still nursing a wound from way back when? Forget it, and find someone new. You deserve a break when it comes to love, and you'll get it soon. SCORPIO: Why do you always start a fight? Try to go with the flow for a change, and see what happens. Bemg agreeable every now and then can win you what you want, too. SAGITTARIUS: So you're bored with your social life? Impossible! Take charge and make some changes -- Spring term offers many social alternatives to the same old scene. CAPRICORN: People just don't seem to be giving you the privacy you need. Take a drive or get away to where people don't bother you. Try to keep your sanity--The term is almost over! AQUARiuS: Someone has been trying to get your attention, and for some reason, you have been snubbing them. Maybe you should think before you act. .. Who knows what this could lead to? PISCES: Some uncontrollable force has been keeping you away from where you want to be, and who you want to be with.

It Ain't No Camp Union, B~ut A Stnall Facsimile Will Do By DINA SCHWEITZER This past weekend has often been remembered by many of us as Parents' Weekend. Looking back, I recall the transformation process that took place every year on Union's grounds ... implants, dipping, scrubbing and buffing were all part of the operation which gave Union the facelift it needed. Hence, our college community transformed itself with a beautiful facade beckoning families to stay. This year, however, was different. Many families stayed away due to our measles scare, and the lawns were not groomed as they were in the past. But nevertheless, this weekend was an opportunity for campus bands to entertain th.ose of us who were orphaned by our parents. Finally, musicians on our campus were given a chance to come out of their basements and into tbe s1mny environment of avid fans. The day began at 12:30 in back of Memorial Chapel, and five bands played throughout the day until 5:30. Unfortun~tely, 12:30 on a Saturday was. a :bit too early to expect Union's community to show up. But, gradually, however, walks of life appeared on the ro0f tops of neighbonng fraternities and adjacent lawn areas. If the music wasn't inviting .enough, the free food was surely a plug to get everyone out of bed. Regardless, the issue here is that our college community shared a lot of support for the bands and the day was simply a blast. Everyone bopped to the sounds of music even when . the afternoon chill settled in. The bands that played were \Late for Supper,\ 'The End,\ \The Jazz Icons,\ \The Frayed Ends,\ and \Late Start.\ As an added bonus, the money that was supposed to have gone to the ''Psychedelic Furs (cancelled) went to the bands that placed first, second, and third. First place went to \The Jazz Ico.ns\ ($200}, second place went to \The Frayed Ends\ ($<100), and in third place \Late Start\ ($50). All the bands displayed a great deal of talent, and I think if nothing else. the band members enjoyed jamming with each other and were perhaps surprised at the amount of ta:lent hidden behind .closed doors. As an added note, I wanted to note that it was great to have a small .facsimile of Camp Union. Although events like this can never replace our memory of Camp Union, it is a positive step towards bettering the sentiment about Union considering the restrictions that we have been faced with this term. Q & A: Leaves M.any Questions Unanswered By ROBERT VIALARDI and ANDREW CONWAY With Nick Nolte and Timothy Hutton as your co- stars, how could you possibly go wrong? This must have been what director Sidney Lumet thougnt. Well, you can go wrong by trying to have these brilliant actors work without a script, as evidenced in Q&A. Based on the book, written by Edwin Torres, the movie is a complicated tale of backstabbing, crime, and corruption. Nolte plays Lt. Mike Brennan, an aged veteran of the New York City Police Force. His reputation can be characterized as an \in-your- face\ type of guy who takes \no crap.\ The new Assistant District Attorney to the Chief of Homicide is AI Riley (Timothy Hutton). Riley's first case is to investigate Brennan's latest \self-defense\ shootii'lg of a notorious drug dealer. As the plot unfolds, Riley works with detectives Chapman and Valentine to investigate the shooting, who add a comical dimension to an otherwise dragging plot. The audience is then introduced to Roberto _ Texador, the epitome of sleaze and slime. Texador and his girlfriend, Nancy Bosch, were witnesses to the shooting. As it turns out, Bosch was Riley's ex-love which creates an itriguing sub-plot. The story then develops into a twisted tale of corruption and bureaucracy, · almost t0o complicated for a nuclear physicist to understand. While Nolte and Hutton give admirable performances, the rest of the supporting cast is weak, except for Alvarado Alvarez, who plays Texador. Besides the lack of script, there is also a lack of action. The fullness of the movie is due to the intricate plot, which takes nearly two full hours to develop. However, the action escalates in the last fifteen minutes when the film finally becomes interesting. Unfor- tunately, Q&A ends abtu}ltly and leaves the audienc~ wondering about a potential sequel. The main problem with the movie is that it drags through its almost unbearable 135 minutes. The only bonus of enduring this film was the introduction to the soundtrack, which was dominated by Don't Double Cross Your Lover. Hopefully, Nolte's highly anticipated release of Yet Another 48 Hours, will not leave movie fans asking unanswerable questions, as in Q & A. The best advice for movie goers is to save your six dollars and wait for Q&A on videotape or in your local campus theater.

CONCORDIENSIS, May 17, 1990 Page 19 . - - ARTS &·ENTERTAINMENT Better Than Bran: The WRUC Record Reviews By RON EUGENIO Lou ReedlJoh.n Cale· Songs for Drella (Sire) \:Orella\ was a nickname Andy W at!).()l didn 1 t much like, although it suited him quite well. A combination of CindeFella and Dracula, a Drella would be a p~rson seduced by the temptations of hig-h fashion, bat had to be back before the san rose to 'Start another glum day. Lou Reed and John Gale were members of the Velvet Underground and Nico., a band formed by Warhol. Most of thefr songs consisted of two chords and Reed singing about how gloriously stoned he was. The sound was wonderful. In tribute to the utist, the Brooklyn Academy ()fMusic and the Arts at St. Ann's commisioned Reed and Cale to write this album. \Songs for Drella\ isn't a departure musically, but lyrically Reed and Cale succeed in resurrecting Great Andy's ghost. The result is an album that makes the moments freeze. Listening to this album is like hearing a giant ,time capsule open. \Songs for Drella\ details the life of Warhol (though in the liner notes Reed insists this is fictional), from the knock- kneed kid in \Small Town\ (Bad skin, bad eyes, gay and fatty, people look at you funny when you're in a stnall town), to his attitude towards art in \Images\ (It doesn't matter what I'm thinking, It's the images worth repeating. The Images), the assasination attempt on his life in \I Believe\ and the time Reed and Warhol first met in the upbeat, driving \Work\ (H~ said \How many songs did you write?'; rct written zero; I'd l,ied and said \ten\). Intensely personal, this is a Reed .transformed from when he preached and moaned in \New York\. Cale has grown too, deciding to approach the music with a m:±nimal approach to give Reed's lyrics the center stage. 'The haunting piano, along with Reed's guitar, are usually ttle only two instruments used here, although an organ and a harmonica pop up from time to time. Spooky as it is, it doesn't sound as chilly as their older material like \Heroin\, but this time around they are :playing for memories, not euphoria. The tenderness of,; Hello It's Me\ closes the album. Reed sings ';I really miss you, I really miss your mind.\ Don't miss this album. Him Skala Bim•Mash It Up! and Mashin' The Nation (Razorbeat) Okay, this isn't a review. It is,.l10wever, ample warning to dance like hell. Bim Skala Bim are a great independent band frorn Boston, and they'll be coming here to Union College this Friday afternoon, May 18th. Together for years, they'v.e shown up in two album compilations, \Mash It Up! (1987), and \Mashin' The Nation\ {1989). This band plays a hyper form of reggae called \ska\, a form of music made popular by English bands like The English Beat, The Specials, and Madness, as well as a bevy of U.S .. bands like Fishbone, The Toasters, and the N.Y. Citizens. Trombones and saxaphones help punch up Bim Skala Bim's already catchy rhythms. Songs like \Digging A Hole\ and \Veil Of Sadness\ are played at such an upbeat pace that the feet can't help must twitch. This band has played the QEII in Albany, to grand reviews. Their guitars are loud enough to please folks who like rock and roll, and the horns keep the pace to make reggae fans smile. Their boundless energy will make everybody move. So come and sweat and smile. Burning Bright: A Play That Is On Fire Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Teenage Mutant · Ninja Turtles By JULIE. MEDOW Eurnin:g :Bright, a novel by John Stei11beck, has been adapted for the stage, and is being performed in its second week at the Nott Memorial from May 16th-19th. The script was created and directed by Lee Bloomrosen, the Director of the College Center and . Stude11t Activities at Union, and :performed by Ed Vassallo, Todd Van Voris, Andrea Mobilia, and Phil Chang. This cast.- made up of only four students, is outstanding. because each person becomes his or her character,, instead of just playing a part. As a member of the audience, I felt close to the characters, as if they were a small piece of my world. I was almost immediately drawn in by Joe Saal, Friend Ed, Mordeen, .a11d Victor, and concerned for their happiness. At times I felt tom about who to sympathize with, and who to blame for the problems and tensions that came and went. But that kept me wondering and watching .• looking for clues and answers to these large-as- life problems, and I enjoyed struggling with them. The structure of the play is also really interesting. The first act (which drags a little due to necessaFy plot telling and unfolding), takes place behind the scenes of a circus, and the characters are acrobats and clowns. After the intermission, the set changes to a house on a farm, but the situations remain the same. In the third act, the characters and the audience , move abroad a ship, still continuing the same story that they had left off in the preceding scene.

The .story of wllat happens to the characters in Burning Bright is not restricted to one set group of people, in fact, it is a· universal story that is meant to have relevance to everyone, clowns, fumers, sailors, doctors, stock bmkers, and students alike. It is a. terrific saga about powerful love, the need to feel needed, and the search for ties in a world that can be cruel to in ill viduals. It is the story of friendship, trust, and endurance, and it is something that is definitely worth seeing.

Some achievements haven't made it into ~the record books; others havej11st made it. Whatever it is, though, it is worth knowing, because if it wasn't, you wouldn't be reading about it here, and I wouldn't have taken the time to write it. The most important of these \things\ is a real life tragedy- turned-unsour. Actually, it is a comeback of immense proportions against great odds. It is the story of Oakland (don't call us the A's anymore) Athletics pitcher Mike Norris. A few weeks ago, he was asked about his greatest thrill in his baseball career. Without a secon<l's pause, .he answered. \['Tonight's game] was the mostincredible thing that ever happened in my life,\ the 35- year-old righthander said after pitching two scoreless innings of relief as he appeared in the ,. major leagues for the first time since August 6, 1983. \It was better than wining 22 games and it was better than my flrst game_\ Th~t sounds hard to believe. Why, you ask?! How could two innings of relief compare • with his 22-9 record for the A's (ha) ill 1980 or that major league debut when he pitched a three-hit shutout agaisnt the Chicago White Sox on April 10, 1975? Simple. For the fust six years of the past decade, Norris lived in a haze. He has gone through several rehabilitation programs for c<Jcaine addiction since 1983. And at the end of that seas<Jn, he underwent surgery for repair ·Of nerve damage in the back .of his right shoulder. Norris didn't pitch at all in 1984, or in '87 and '88. He struggled through unsuccessful stints in the minors in 1985 and '&6. Last year. he was 6-6 with Tacoma of the Pacific Coast League after A's (ha) . general manager Sandy Alderson took a chance and signed Norris to a Triple-A conttacL Wilen Alderson was asked why he was willing to give Nonis this chance, his answer was simple. \He was unemployed and he goes way back with the organization. And because he is .the type of person you'd like to give a seco11d chance. And a third and a fourth ... \ Amazing praise for a man who has had so many problems and had not pitched in the big leagues since 1983. Sixteen seasons and o11e week later, Mike Norris won again in the Majors. He was credited with the victory after pitching two innings of relief for the A.'s (ha-ha-ha) in a 7-5. 11-inning win over the California Angels. It was a long time coming, and Norris travelled a long and windy road getting to Anaheim on April 17. It's good to see success stories like the one of Mike Norris in a game so often represented by numbers and dollar signs. Here are some interesting numbers and dollar signs for the interested fan. 0Fel Hershiser, the Los Angeles Dodgers righthander , will make $1.6 million dollars tllis season for every ONE of his :victories, which is how ma11y he had when he injured bis ann. He underwent rotator cuff surgery last month and will be out until next spring. This is the same Orel who had pitched no less than 230 innings in the past five seaons, and who had completed 58 of the 198 starts in his career. All of these numbers are staggering. Chicago Cubs righthander (Why are all of these pitchers I am writing about righthanded?) Greg Maddux carved a small niche for himself in the record boo~s on April 29 as he made seven putouts, most ever by a pitcher in a major league game, while covering first base in a win over the Dodgers. Cul>s first baseman Mark Grace fielded all seven ground balls oo start all seven plays in which Maddux was involved. The old record was six, shared by two American leaguers. The past N.L. record was five. (And the only reason I have not listed the names of these record holding pitchers is because I am sure that, like me, you don't care who they are.) National League umpire B()b Engel, accused of stealing 4,180 baseball cards from a department store, was placed on a leave of absence. He is accused of taking seven boil<es of SCORE baseball cards which are valued at $143.98. Finally, another interesting tidbit: Research by the commissioner's office showed that during the 1980's, not one team in the big leagues had a winning record on the road_ The New York Yankees had the best road mark at 388-396, a .495 percentage. Aren't you glad you know this now? I know I am. (Yea. Right!)

This Saturday/Sun(Jay meet provided gr()at competition from 30 other teams and mixed weather. The women who were ltJcky enough to run in the sunsbdne on Saturday were De~tise Saunders in the 100 meters and Rika Poor in the 400 meters. Alix Goldschmidt also competed Saturday throwing a personal record in the hamrn()r. Sunday was so wet the competitors had to wait between each race for the puddles on the track t() be swept off. Once again the Union women broke tll~ir school record in the 4Xl00 meter relay though the handotis were made even more callenging ilecause of the ram. In Sunday's open races, Rika Poor placed sixth in the 400 meter final and Meg Parso11s placed tenth in the 800 meters. Both women will be returning next year and look forward to bettering this year's times. The mile relay was run during the heaviest downpour, yet the women ran a 4:08, their fastest time of the season, placing sixth. Three of the four relay members will be returning next year. but senior co-captain Alison Williams will be missed in both relays. On Sunday, the discus was thrown by Lori Simkins and senior Beth \window fogger\ Jewett, who will also be sorely missed by the team next year. Alix Goldschmidt placed third in the shot put and brought home the only hardware from the meet. This meet was a good one, the competition stiff and the facilities excellent. All who participated could be sure to have competed even better had the weather not been S() bad. The team did enjoy the opportunity to compete against such national caliber teams as Cortland State and Tufts.The women wish to extend their thanks for the support and guidance of their friends, parents, and coaches.

May 17, 1990 Jeff Simkins Breaks A Men's Track School Record By WILL ALLEN Two weeks ago at the Collegiate Track Championships held at Trenton State College, Jeff Simkins did what no one has been able to do for the last four years-- break a men's track school record. Simkins, a senior and co-captain of both the indoor and outdoor squad, ran the 400m hurdles in 54.1 seconds, eclipsing the previous mark by 3/10 of a second ·Of a second. At the same meet, Chip (SS) Silver, the other senior co- captain, won the decathlon as he performed his best ever in 9 out of 10 events. This past weekend was no less exciting, as the men travelled to Hartwick for the Division III State Meet. Simkins placed second in the 400m hurdles with a time of 54.4 seconds. Silver, in yet another outstanding performance, placed first in the decathlon, third in the 11Om hurdles, and fourth in the high jump. In scoring 20 points for the tesm, Silver missed being named MVP of the State Meet by a mere two points. Others scoring in the meet included junior Bob (Measles) Lindyberg, who placed fifth in the 800m with a titne of 1:58.9. This was his second fastest time ever and an amazing feat after not competing for the last two weeks. Another junior, Art Broga, placed fifth in the long jump, which rounded out the individual scoring. The only other points scored were by the mile relay team of freshman Bill (Mr.&Mrs.) Taylor, Simkins, Silver, and junior Will Allen. They fmished sixth in a career~best 3:25.3 as the four ran splits of 52.2, 51.4, 51.1, and 50.8 seconds respectively. The 2-mile relay team also ran a seasn-best time of 8:45 as Greg Barrett.

One proposal wa~ raised necessity to change the present by Drew Ward, a stmdent dining .plan in order to meet the ·. repre.senta ti ve .to the schoQl's serious budget committee,. that would consist consistency in budgetary planning on an annual basis. When the subject arose • regai:ding the implementation of a credit system,. Jan Gray asserted that the buy-in cost for a de.clining board system wllich ' would essenially be cash a la carte, would mot 'be worth the investment. In addition, she · reported that students using the credit system at other schools tan out of money, or credits, before the end of the term. Thus, she proposed a credit system in conjurnction with a set meal plan. Other suggestions were made involving the extension of the operating hours of the college · dining facilities. The S.A.C. agreed that being able to use meal cards <Jay or night, anywhere on ·campus, would also prove to be a positive change. However, Jan· Gray Excerpts from Minute~ for the Student Affairs C(}uncil, May 15, 1990 NEW BUSINESS: -Due to poor turnout forthe housing lottery as of. late, many rooms have been left vacant on ~rnpus. This puts the school in a: difficult position as it must meet the economic strain thi:s places on the· system. The trend seems to indicate that rather than 'Nait'for the announcement of lottery rlUmbers in the ~!)ring, many students are signing leases as early as the winter to assRJre adequate housing for the following year. The result is that fewer students are taking part in the lottery, more are living in off.-campus apartments, and many r<>oms are left vacated. An idea to alleviate this ,prClblem was to issue lottery numbers at the beginning of the academb year so that people have a better ickla of their chances of securing college housing. -Another proposal, whiCh will be presented to tile Board of Trustees, was related by Dean Mammela. This deals witt! the enforcement of a policy which is stated in the Student's Handbook requiring all students to live on campus, based on the availability of campus housing. The proposal would require all sophomores to live in campus housing rather than seek alternate living space, and is consister1t with Union's .policy of being a residential college. As it stands now, sophomores who wish to live in college owned frater11ity housing could do so, and still rneet the proposed requ'irement. Sophomores would not, however, be allowed to live in Qreekhousing v;hich was not owned by the school. -Will there be enough 011-campus housing for juniors and seniors, or will they be forced t<> live off campus? What abl>ut space for transfer students, or those on terms abroad who cannot sign leases? How will the Greeks who do not own their own houses react? Will the quality of Union's dormitories improve to make this a justified demand? Stay turned for exciting debates in the near future. -Also included in this proposal was the requirement for all sophomores to .utilize the schoo.l's meal plan. Questions were raised, and debate followed as to the right of the College to demand this of its students, based on negative feelings towards Union's Dining services. Some members felt that the quality of the food was low, and that the prices were, too high to merit this demand. Others questior~ed the constitutiortality of the issue, as well as how tire Greeks W()Uid be affected. Dean Mammola was 11le center of attention at Tuesday's Student Affairs Council Meeting. as the Dutch Hollow. As well, she asserted that the school could face increased Iai:Jor costs by extending the operating hours of a given facility. agreed liP()n, further discussion was planaed for the S.A.C. meeting to be held next Tuesday. Accordingly, no suggestioits will be made to the Board of Trustees at present, other than those which concern the future of on- campus llousing. responsibilities •\while he stressed that dining services is a non-profit auxiliary enterprise of the college. He asserted that the problem lies within tile budgetary system in that the college's fiscal budget is put together by January, almost ten of a contractual agreement whereby the student could state his intention to be on or mot to be on a meal plan far in advance of the terin it w<Onld 1 affect. . Although Mamola deemed this a \creative suggestion that should be looked into,\ he also pointed out that this would' fail to meet the needs for responded by pointing· out the problems which could arise in seating faculty and staff simulaneously in places such The long term effects of any meal plan proposal on Greek students still remain to be seen.

CONCORDIENSJS, May 24, 1990 Page 3 Housing and Dining Policy Charges Debated Continued from ,page 1 assert that given the FaU 1989 housing statistics for sophomores, only 66 students would have been aflected by the new proposals ~See Chart - p3). The revised housing recomm,endation~ will be presented to the. B-oard of Tmstees lhis June. After a great deal of discussion, no condusion was reached regarding ihe future of the food service ~1an. In light of fhe existing impasse, no recommendations Vtill be made to the Board of 'Fmstees in June concen1in g campus dining. However, a determination of alternative means of providing dining is presently underway. Dean Mammola •:eiterated the necessity to change the present dining plan in order to meet the school's serious budget Services, claimed that the number of students utilizing the dining facilities has .. averaged approximately 1,000 per term. Furthermore, she . added that as many as a few htmdFed could elect to drop out of the meal plan in a given • term. Accordingly, Dean Mam- mola pointed out that this makes things difficult when trying to meet a preset budget in that expenditures persist and revenues are not met. Fmthermore, he added that if the college falls short of its dining budget, the entire budget is affected. Various proposals for a new dining plan welie examined, all of which were depicted to have flaws. One proposal was raised by Drew Ward, a student representative to the committee, that would consist consistency in budgetary planning Oil an annual basis. When the subject arose regarding the implementation of a credit system. Jan Gray asserted that tlle buy-in cost for a dedining board system which would essenially be cash a Ia carte, would not be worth the investment. In addition, she reported that students using the credit system at other schools ran out of money, or credits, before the end of the term. Thus, she proposed a credit system in conjunction with a set meal plan. Other suggestions were made invoiving t!lle extension of the operating hours of the col,lege dining facilities. The S.A.C. agreed that beimg able to use meal cards clay or night, anywhere on campus, would also prove to be a positive change. However, Jan Gray Dean MarnrnClla was the center of attention at Tuesday's Student Affairs Counci I Meeting. of a contractual agreement whereby the student could state his intention to be on or not to be on a meal plan far in advance of the term it would affect. responded by pointing out the problems wllich could arise in seating faculty and staff simulaneously in places such I ( .f.:jndQ.pendenw, ;r.~.reek:S . . ; · Off Campus f Term Abroad ~{. ;1'9Pihl!ge- .H04~tng \, Gr&:i~~-Prlvate ; Ott campu.s 'Term ·Abroad· ~.:::: .. .MfiN 114 t43%) 97: .

This puts the school in a difficult position as it must meet the economic strain this places on the system. The trend seems to indicate that rather than wait for the announcement of lottery numbers in the spring, many students are signing leases as early as the winter to assure adequate housing for the following year. The result is that fewer students are taking part in the lottery, more are living in off-campus aprutments, and many rooms are left vacated. An idea to alleviate this problem was to issue lottery numbers at the beginning of the academic year so that people have a better idea of their chances of securing cCJIIege housing. -Another proposal, vvhich will be presented to the Board of Trustees. was related by Dean Ma111mola. This deals with the enforcement of a policy which is stated in the Student's Handbook requiring all students to live on campus, based on the availability of campus housing. The proposal would require all sophomores to live in campus housing rather than seek alternate living space, and is consistent with Union's policy of being a residential college. As it stands now. sophomores who wish to live in college owned fratemity housing could do so, and still meet the proposed requirement. S<Jphomores would not, however, be allowed to live in Greek housing wtlich was not owned by the school. -Will there be enough on-campus housing for juniors and seniors. or will they be forced to live .off campus? What about space for transfer students, or those on terms abroad who cannot sign leases? How w1ll the Greeks who do not own their own houses react? Will the quality of Union's dormitories improve to make this a justified demand? Stay turned for exciting debates in the near future. -Also included in this proposal was the requirement for all sophomores to utilize the school's meal plan. Questions were raised, and debate followed as to the right of the College to demand this of its students, based on negative feelings towards Union's Dining services. Some members felt that the quality of the food was low, and that the prices were too high to merit this demand. Others questioned the constitutionality of the issue, as well as how the Greeks would be affected. as the Dutch Hollow. As we!J, she asserted that the school could face increased laborcosts by extending the OJlerating hours of a given facility. The long tenn effects(][ any meal plan proposal 011 Greek students still remain to be seen. As no viable policy was agreed upon, further discussion was planned for the S.A.C. meeting to be held next Tuesday. Accordingly, no suggestions will be made to the Board of Trustees at present, oi:her than those which concern the future of on- campus housing. responsibilities wllile he stressed that dinin~ services is a non-profit auxiliary enterprise of the college. He asserted that the problem lies within the budgetary system in that the college's fiscal bu-dget is put together by January-, almost ten months before it is to take effect in July. Jan Gray, Director of Dining Although Mamola deemed this a \creative suggestion that should be looked into,\ he also pointed out that this would fail to meet the needs for Gamma Phi Beta Hoping To Re Rewarded For Patience 5f 14190 5/14/90 5f 14190 5/14/90 5/IS/90 5fl5190 5/ IS/90 Sf!S/90 5115/90 5fl6190 Sf 16190 5116/90 5/1619_0 5117190 5f 17190 5117/90 5f 17190 5117/90 5/17190 5117190 5117/90 5118190 5/18190 5/18190 5118190 5/19190 5119190 5/19/90 5119/90 5/19190 5119/90 5/19/90 5120190 Reported Security Incident DUDLEY OBSERVATO~Y STAFF REPORTS TREE CUT DO~H WEST C()lLEGE UNDOW BROKEN IN LAUNDRY ROO/I PSI UPSJLOII CABLE BOX REPORTED msJN& ALUKNJ 6Yit UMDESJRABLE REPORTEO; ARRESTED CA~PUS BROTHER LOOKING fOR DISTRAUGHT SISTER BECKER Cl RCU VEHICLE ACCIDENT COlLEGE emu REPORT OF GAS ODOR UPPER ClASS DINING ; fi-B-QUE S~ITH HOUSE MICROWAVE CAUGHT ON FIRE fLAGPOLE SfUDENT REPORTS HEARING SCEAHmG i GOA CAMPUS REPORT OF HISSING E~PLOYEE ; FOUND JN HORNING NEW ENTRY RGAD 111WED VEHICLE PARKED IN FIRE LANE CAMPUS STUDENT REPORTS RECEIVED OBSCENE CALLS CAHPUS STUDENT REPORTS DAMAGE TO COLLEGE VmiCLE WEST CotL E6E rrRE ALARM CAUSED BY PAPER BURNING HEHORJA1 FJElDilO~SE HIJUSEKEEPER REPORT STONES BEING THROWN AT OVERHEAO OIJOR ; GOA SOUTH HRRAC[ LA~E 4 CARS TOWED FOR PARKING IN FlRE LANE SCIIAHEI LIBiARY REPORT OF SKO~E DOOR ADHINJST~AlfON ~[JT TIJWED ILLEGALLY PARKED VEHICLES DELTA PHI REPORT OF VANDALISH TO COMPOSJTE SCHAFFER Ll BIAllY SfUDENT INJURED ; TRANSPORTED TO ELLJS E.R. roOT BALl FIELD INTRAHURALS CANCELLED DUE 10 WEATHER RICHHONO STUDW REPORTS 2 PEOPLE KNDC<ING ON FRONT DOOR i 6LIESTS Of STUDENT NEW EIIHY ROI1D TIJWED VEHICLE ; PARKED W fiRE LANE TENNIS COURJS STAFF REPORTS SUSPICIOUS VEHICLE; 60A WEST CmLEGE STUDENT REPORTS RECEIVED THREATENIHG PHONE CALLS DAVIDS~N V!INDALm TO WATER FOUNTAIN NORTH COLtE_,E REPORT OF UNDESIRABLES WI ALCOHOL ; STUOENTS SIGMA Clll REPORT OF NON-STUDENTS ; WARNED OFF CAMPUS FOX REPORT OF riGHT; NON-STUDENTS ijARNED OFF CMPUS HEHORI ~l CH.IlPEL SliALL FIRE Ill BOX FROH HOT COALS HEHORii\L Cll~PEL om fjRDERED TO STOP PLAYING PER SPD Sill TH lmUSE STUDENT ADVISED 10 REHDVE CHARCOAL GRILL FRO~ PPRCH !FIRE SAFEIVJ UEST CllLLEGI SfUDENT INJURED HAND; TRANSPORTED TO ELLIS E. R. h-------------------------------------~ By MIKE SILBERSTEIN When Gamma Phi Beta obtained its charter at Union College in 1985 all members understood that they would not be granted housing on campus in the near future. In a surprising gesture to the Student Affairs Committee (SAC) on Tuesday May 22, Dean Mammola stated that the College's answer to Gamma Phi Beta, \After a long and patient request for housing, ought to be moore positve than lt has been in the pasL.\ In doing so, Dean Mammola stated to th~ SAC that he has re-opened the question on housing for Gamma Phi Beta, . possibly beginning with the 1991-92 school year. This prope>sal contrasts last year's denial for housing in the 11orth wiag of Raymond House. A vaca11cy was created after the eviction of Delta Chi following the 1988-89 school :year. In addition, Gamma Phi 1· Beta's swrage space in Richmond was taken away at the start of this year. Jill Cochran, former vice president of Gamma Phi Beta and currently a senior, stated, \We have been extremely patient with regard to the situation and did not want to be too pushy on the issue. We realized that going through the proper channels and talking with administration officials would be in Gamma Phi Beta's best interest.\ Mary Brush, president of the sorority, supported that statement. The administration and other college officials have not always been cooperative with Gamma Phi Beta, resulting with the complaint of some sisters of a severe \lack of communication,\ in the words of Ms. Cochran, between the two groups. Former president of the sorority, Jennifer Hutchins, said, \There have always been difficulties getting commitments from the administration and oftentimes when decisions were I'eached, they were not always supported by Gamma Phi Beta.\ She agreed that in Gamma Phi Beta's search for rooms in the past couple of years, they have \been given i:he run-around.\ Gamma Phi Beta wa.;; told in 1985 that they would be considered for housing should the space become available. Dean Mammola stated that, \It was unfortunate that they came to Union College at that particular Lime because there was a much higher demand for housing than there was a supply.\ The situation has changed in the last two years, as the enrollment for Classes of 1993 and 1994 is considerably lower than tho..;L' of previous years. At a time when the Colkg·.~ enrollment has dccl incd anll Dean Mammola is considering having all sophomores live on campus beginning with the Class of 1994, the Dean says, \It is time that the question be re-opened as to whether Gamma Phi Beta should be given on-campus housing.\

However~ using the current average college libary book cost of $40, that figure represents merely an additional 87'5 volumes per year. Adding those 875 volumes to the 4,325 acquired last year would give us only a total of 5,200 volumes, Rank 1 Dol'lars ;per student College Amherst Wellesley Bates Lawrence Union (ties with Earlham) $146B 1 1 1045 21 822 31 651 36 3 I (tie) 583 recent years, tlle last five in ptticular. Indeed, consulting only Union's data, it is the lov.'est number ()f b'loks added to the library in 21 years, and more than 2,00() volumes less than the average number of h<l'lks added per yeudtUing the period. What accounts for this da11gerous erosion :in our ability to acquire basic research materials? The answer is bucgetary. Financial supiJort for library acquisitions has siMply not beem sufficiellt to maintain past standards, much less to keep up \.Vitb other cctleges of oui kind. Moreover, budget allocations in the :past fc~ years have beel1' stretclled ever tighter owing to the steadily inflating cC>sts of books and periodical subscriptions. That inflation rate has been 8.3%, on the average, each year for the )Jast fiv-e years. The total libmry acquisitions budget, however, has been permitted to i:ncr~se b:y .an average of only SA% per year during that period. Recognizing these problems, the Librarian and the AJ(iministration h.ave IJ.een W()rking together to get things moving in the right direction. The total library badget has gradually begun to represe:nt a slightly larger- proportion of the total educational :and general budget of tile College. And some new funds ($35,000 which would still be the lowest number added to the library in ten years and 1,000 fewer boolul than we acquired, on the average. in each of the last 21 years. Sh()uldn't Union aim a litrle higher? A seemingly modest initial goal would be to acquire 8,000 titles per year: that woul<l bring us up to the level of the ~arly 1980's and allow us to offer more comprehensive, substantial support for current programs. Acqniring 8,000 titles wouJd require a permanent increase of $158300 to be built into tfle library book acq uistions budget, plus an .amount to compensate for the mflatlon rate of periodicals in the coming years. That's a lot of money, but the potential benefits to all of the college's programs as well as to individual student and faculty researchers would surely be worth-while. It is a short step in logic from adding books to housing them. Even at our current minimal rate of .acquisitions, some areas of Schaffer Library are already critically crowded~ Specia collections resorted to overflow areas years ago.

Continued from page 4- Other students offered that • the rumor of England going for the Swarthmore presidency, which has recently opened up, has convinced students that England is out of the running. This, according to Meyer, is untrue and each of the candidates has an equal opportunity for the position. . despite their spac~-efficieat compact shelving. What can ·. give to make room for new volumes, -especially to the scale that Union needs them? The issues of fund raising, women and minorities were the topics of discussion. As at the previous meeting, Taylor was cited as lacking in these areas. Concern was raised over his business-like manner and the possibility of his \stepping on toes\ to raise money. The issue of his lacking a Doctorate degree was also a concern. Hull was made to be the compromise between the first two candidates~ He was credited with his efforts and years at Beloit, which contrasted with Taylor's lack of experience in the realm of education. There was doubt, however, over his ability to fund raise effectively with the type of donors to a small New England · college after coming from an even smaller midwest .college. His extension into all the areas the other two candidates covered was viewed as a plus and a minus. He is able to Not study spaces. The · present number of 500 is already 122 short, according to • the Association of College and Research Library's specifications of one seat for every four FTE students. Nor are t,here other kinds of space ·. we can reclaim in the present . building; indeed, comfortable . places for desirable intellectual activity such as periodical reading are already completely lacking. A building program planning committee -- consisting of students, faculty, and administrators, assisted by an architect and an outside professional library building consultant -- did meet between December, 1987 and May 1989. The committee developed a detailed building program, expressing needs in terms a planning _architect could design for. Time is moving on, however, and the space crisis worsens as that building program remains unfunded -- and indeed, as the program grows potentially more dated with each passing · yeat. Above aU, we call for leadership and planning that will link both of the problems we set forth in this ~wticle and aim for an integrated, long- range solution: First, increase the regular book and periodic ai acquisitions budget by amounts that would make a significant improvement in our ability to acquire needed materials. A minimum first goal should be to acquire 8,000titlcs per year. Second, press on with achieving an expanded librru:y building. Third, as the building program is revived, keep in mind the increasing space needs of our ever-growing collections. If we restore an appropriate growth rate, yet overlook the need to hotJse tJ1e books adequately, a new building will only too soon be outgrown. In sum, we urge the college to take action on its description of the library as an institution · of central importance to the academic community. Let us assign its budgetary needs a higher priority, recogniziilg that by devoting more of the college's material resources to that end, we are investing nvt only in Union's reputation among its peers but in all its students and faculty. · handle well the \multi-faceted' job of president,\ as one student commented, but , according to another, \an injection of adrenalin\ is needed at Union and Taylor would be the one to deliver it. For Meyer the search has been a success in that most agree that . \each of the candidates would do a good job if selected. Now it is just a matter of choosing the one who will do the greatest job.\ Three minutes a day is all we ask .. ~ UNITED WAY Greg Angus A warded Watson Fellowship By KAREN HURWITZ Greg Angus, a senior at . Union, was one of Union's two · Watson Fellow.ship winners and will be traveUing to · England, Zimbabwe and the People's Republic of China next year. As a. Watson. Fellowship winner, Greg won $13,000 to. travel abroad for one year with and follow a proposal that he identified i!l the application process. He wtll be studying the values that cultures place on toys, and toys as an aide in child devlopment. He will study the roles that gender, and race play in what toys children play with and learn from. He also plans to investigate such conttoversial issues as war toys. Greg said he has a1ways been fascinated by children's toys and through contacts with toy companies including Fisher- Price and Lego Systems Inc., he has learned about the psychological considerations that are incorporated in toy production regarding child development and eduation. Angus will be studying the values that cultures place on toys and toys as an aid in child development England will be the first place where Greg plans to study. Because of its apparent similarities to the U.S., it will be an excellent opportunity to establish a loose framework for further study. In Zimbabwe Greg plans to study the importance of toy production in different communities-- urban, suburban, and remote rural areas. He will also be able to study children who are coping with problems such as malnutrition, and the roles that toys in their community play,. China will be the last place that Greg plans to study and will perhaps be most interesting because of China's \one child per family\ policy, its Communist system of government, and the recent Pro-Democracy movement there. Choosing only three diverse cultures will allow Greg sufficient time to develop friendly relationships with the communities and families he will be observing. Greg is a Psychology majcr at Union, and plans to go to graduate school for children's education or child development after his year abroad. ! I .j I I·

CONOQRDIEN5lS, ~tiJ' U, 1'990 FEATURES Meet Dave, The Dining Hall Man By ANDREW RICE and EDMUND ROTHENBERG If you ever cat at Upper- Class Dining Hall you can't miss him .. In fact you don't want tn miss him. He is Dave Mannato, Supervisor of Upper- Class Dining. What makes Dave so visible and popular (besides his impeccable wardrobe) is his friendliness, his willingness to help out a student, and his warm sense of humor. Tbis interview was conducted to discover just wl1at makes Dav~ Mannato tick. Q: How did you come to work at Upper-Class? A: I started May 15, 1987, missing college graduation, to start trainLng with Marge, for the superv.:isory position at Old Chapel Back then this was the Upper Class Dining Hall. After making many changes, ~nd getting to know the students; attendance went up about 80%. Q: At the age of 19, when most people are still students, you weFe already supervising other workers. Were you accepted by your peers when you first came here? A: I had a sense that the other workers, almost au· of whom were several yeats older than me, had some doubts. In fact it was quite a controversy. But now everyone acepts me, and this is due, I think, to my befief that I'm an equal with my workers. Q: Where did you grow up, Dave? A: l have been a life-long resident of Schenectady. I went to Mount Pleasant High School, and then enrolled in computer programming courses at Schenectady County Colmmunity College. But one day while I w.as sitting in front of a computer terminal, 1 .said to myself, \I really don~t want to do this for the rest of my life.\ I knew that restaurant or hotel management was where I wanted to J)e~ and switched majors. And when the position at Union showed up, I knew it would be a good experience for a future position in the he>tel or restaurant business. Q: Is this a hint that you may be leaving us soon? Even while posing,, [)ave ponders h[s nex1 culiinary creation. A: If I think I'll have a future at Union, then I'll stay. I am planning to be back next year. However, if I did see a job which offers a higher position or more money, then, yes, I would take it. But as for now I love this job. I wouldn't leave this job if someone gave me a million dollars. Q: You certainly do seem to go above and beyond the call of duty-- from the \Mega-punch\ to, the contests, to the questionnaires. Have you always been this way? A: A teacher in hotel management once told me (and I swear I'll never for:get it) that \Your custome:t;S come first, no matter what they do, or how angry they get, because they are the ones who pay your salary.\ My aim is ~o make Upper-Class dining as pleasant and as satisfying an experience as I can for all the students. I love my students. I take the time to learn what individual students like, and try to make sme that they find what they want. The bottom line is I don't want anyone leaving my place hungry. The surveys and contests are all my ideas, hut these I organize at home o~ my own time. Q: What do you enjoy doing in your off-time? A: On Saturd~y mornings I teach bowling to children, ages '9-12. In the past month I've met a wonderful girl. (Her name is Jackie-- I have to .say that.) She realty has changed my life,. and I feel like I now have a serious relatio11ship on the rise. I feel that my work with the young children., with the students at Union, and. my . personal relationship have matured me past my 23 years. Q: One last queston: Do you eatthe food here? A: Yes, I have to eat here. My motber once told me if I didn't eat at work I wouldn't eat at all! Prevent Yourself From Becoming A Statistic Is It Spring T ·.··? erm. By E:RICA FRANK In the past couple of weeks there has been a surge of campus activism. However, I would like to bring up an unsettling issue which affeoets us all. but has conveniently been neglected among the myriad of controversial matters addressed. To be direct, the number of people I see drinking and driving on this campus is absolutely abominable. In case everyone wasn't aware, drunk driving accidents are one of the leading killers in our country for people under the age of 25. It's clear to me that the <:ampus population hasn't been educated on this topic with the same degree of rigor as I. Regardless, I can still remember back to freshman year in high school when a man came in and showed us photographs wh.ich depicted the gory details of drunk driving accidents. At tile time I thought that the presentation was completely inappiOriate as I knew that although we didn't drive yet, none ofmy friends would ever drink and drive. Certainly I would ne\'er encounter such a situation. Clearly, my beliefs freshman year wene naive. However. I only wish that everyone had been at tbat assembly. The visual memories of mangled bodies I retained continue to prevent me from getting into a car with a drunk driver today. An especially startling statistic relates that 90% of the drunk driving accidents which occur happen within one mile The number of pecple I see drinking and driving on this campus is absolutely abominable. of the victim's home. 0 n e mile. That means everyone who lives off campus, West, Richmond, Fox or Davidson and parks up campus because it's \easier\ isn't somehow magically exempt because they are only traveling a mile at the end ofthe evening. To focus on another point, the poeple who actually get into these cars are equally guilty. A1though we like to think that we are invincible, realistically, this opinion is both naive and mor:onic. Therefore, people who allow their friends to drive drunk because it's \easier\ are not only ignorant and lazy, but also are not ~·real\ friends. My definition of a \real\ friend is one who will look out for the other. It would be hypocritical of me to just accuse without WRUC 7 CONCORDlENSIS 4 giving some answers. Therefore I ask, \What can be done? First ,()f all, waiting 20 or even 40 minutes for security isn't such an incr.edible inconvenience when yon weigh the odds. Enough said. Also, if the person is insisting that they can <!rive, an entire carload of p<Cople saying that they would \rather walk\ is often effective. In addition, everyone k'Ilows about the \designated driver\ idea. However, it <>nly works if one person does11~ t drink. I guess the bottom line here is that we an must take responsibility for our own actions. This is not intended to be an accusatory article. Rather, its purpose is to make you a little more aware. We are no longer high school students with SADD to constantly remind us tbat drunk driving is wrong. There is no grey in this issue. Not only is DWI a felony, btit every tim~ you drive drunk, or you get into a car with a ruunk driver, y{)u are· putting yowself at risk. Please realize this before you make yourself, or somebody else, a statistic. By KAREN BURNS When we first got back from spring break things started out on a positive note. Winter in Schenectady was over-- it was time to shake the winter blues. The usual \spring fever\ atmosphere prevailed as the days got progressively warmer. It seemed too good to be true that there were days of endless sunshine. Everyone took full advantage of the rays, spending hours outside. This was the perfect excuse to avoid doing school work and to work on a tan. However, Mother Nature made sure the weather did not last fot an extended period of time. The first day of rain was no big deal, it seemed normal, but the days turned into weeks. A water repellent jacket soon became a permanent part of every student's attire. Just as we thought spring could not get any worse, the measles epidemic broke out on campus. Students had to wait in long lines to get a vaccination and all activities were cancelled. Everyone had NEED EXTRA CASH?~~ heard about other college campuses that had been infected but nobody ever believed it could happen to Union. Parent's Weekend, formals, and parties were all cancelled, which made the situation seem more unbearable. The only thing that was not cancelled were classes and the campus movies. At this point, the mood on campus was growing increasingly hostile, especially toward the administration. It is now the end of May and the only memory of the past month will be rain. There is no Camp Union and we still have two weeks of classes and finals ahead of us. The sun does come out occasionally but the raindrops fall at the same time. There is no hope for warm weather and sunshine in the near future. Every weather report forecasts \off and on showers\. Most students have learned to accept the undesirable conditions and to wait for summer. It just seems disillusioning since summer could turn · out to be as unrewarding as the spring. We are looking for students who want to earn some fun, easy money!

One was that many sex offenders have \hundreds\ of victim£ before being caught. Another was that, statistical.ly, people are less safe :in their ow11 homes than out on the streets. She could not stress en<>ugh the necessity of keepiag one's doors and windows locked, · especially off -campus residents. Emphasizing the fact that the rally was for the safety of men _ as well as women both on and off campus, Ms. Gilbert spoke of instances of male rape and surprised her audience by saying that males who rape other males were mostly not homosexual, but heterosexuals crazedfor power. The rally was for the safety of men as well as women both on and off campus. Lastly, Ms. Gilbert called for volunteers to work for the Rape Crisis Center, to aid in counseling and the hotline. The Center's next project is to in stall programs in the neighboring middle and high schools to promote greater rape awru:eness among the students there. Karen Johnson, the mayor of Schenectady, was the second Speaker. She also stressed safety and revealed that the city was very concerned abollt the students living off-campus, are· geographically more under the jurisdiction of the Schenectady police than of Union security. She suggested having \block parties\ in which residents got to know one another. In this way, if anything out of the ordinary-- such as a suspicious-looking person wantering about-- occured, it could be detected more quickly. ln addressing the issue of the reduced lighting in Schenectady due to budget cuts, Ms. Johnson suggested that the city and the campus security co.uld \work something out. .. \ The rally concluded with a wet march around the campus and its out-lying areas.

Not too many Saturdays ago (When there was still weather to speak of), I traded in my books for a bathing suit. The boys had revived one of those unforgettable tools of youth, the slip-n-slide. It ran about 50 feet or so, and seemed like the perfect diversion from whatever it was we were supposed to be doing. The water and beer flowed. Costumes ranging from a caped 9rusader to those in their b-irthday suits •emerged from the woodwork. The slide worked great, and (for a change) I thought that even the most ignt')rant of our critics would have a laugh at what mindless fnn we were having.

They doubled the slide's width, so that we could double our pleasure, sending an unprecendented two people down at once. Only the two pieces of plastic were not attached at their joint.

Page 8 CONCORDJBNSIS, May 24, 1990 INTERNATIONAL FEATURES Romania: Doe.s Free Election Really B·reak Rigid Communism? By JILL PHILLIPPS For the first time in 50 years, a ftee election for the president of Romania was held. From 70 different party candidates, a mere six were granted seats. The lliscu government has been accused by opposing parties of tampering with the media in order to influence votes. Romania is seemingly notorious for intimidating its people from voting, along with practicing unclean elections. Consequently, there have been demonstrations against government interference blocking the passage through the main city for the past four weeks. This shows us how eager some Romanians must be for democracy. The polls were held on Monday, May 21. Some 40,000 police and army troops were present to watch the poll&. along with about a half million foreign spectators drawn to see the ev~nt. \A question mark is brought to how far Romania really is from becoming Democratic\ According to opinion polls, of the three presidential candidates chosen, Ion Iliescu ,.of the National Salvation Front stands a 70% chance of being elected. This party, primarily made up of former Communist supporters, seems to want slow changes in the economy toward free enterprise. This party also has been charged with cutting Romania's supply of basic goods. The Uberal Party, :the next most popular in the opinion polls, is made up youthful ,intellectuals. As opposed to thle intentions of tlie N.S.F., the Liberal Party would pre-fer radical and quicker moves toward a capitalistic economy. Given Romania's reputation in the IJast, of practicing voting fraud, and of falsifying the results of opinon polls; given the recent number of demonstrations fighting to protect the Romanian people's freedom. to vote; and the necessity for army troops atthe election; a question mark is brought to how far Romania is from really becoming democratic. What Is Apartheid? Courtesy of International Encyclopedia AP ARTHEID-(Afrikaans: \apartness\), poliey governing relations between South Africa's white minority and nonwhite majority; it sanctions racial segregation and political and economic discrimination against nonwhites. The implementation of apartheid, often called \separate development\ since the 1960's, has been made possible through the Population Registration Act of 1950, which classifies the people of Bantu (all black Africans), coloured (those of mixed race), and white. A fourth category- Asian (Indian a11d Pakistani) was later added. Racial segregation, sanctioned by law, was widely practiced in South Africa before 1948, and the National Party, which gained office that year, extended the policy and gave it the name Apartheid. The Group Areas Act of 1950 established residential and business sections in urban areas for each race, and the government strengthened existing \pass\ laws requiring nonwhites to carry documents authorizing their presence in restricted areas. Other laws forbade most social contacts between the races, authorized segregated public facilities, established separate educational standards, restricted each race to certain types of jobs, curtailed nonwhite labour unions, and restricted nonwhite partiCipation (through white representatives) in the national government, Under the Bantu Authorities Act of 1951 the government reestablished tribal organizations for black Africans, and the Promotion of the Bantu Self-Government Act of 1970 created African homelands. The Bantu Homelands Friendship Act of 1970 made every black man, irrespective of actual residence,_ a citizen of one of the homelands, thereby excluding blacks from the South African body politic. In the early 1980's four of the homelands bad been granted independence as republics, and the remaining called Black States, had varying degrees of self-government; but all remained dependent, both politically and economically, on South Africa. The dependence of the South African economy on nonwhite labour has, in fact, made it difficult for the government to carry out this policy of separate development. Although the governme11t has the power to supress virtually all criticism of its policies, there has been oppositiQn to· apartheid within South Africa. Black African groups, with the support of some wl1ites, have held demonstrations and strikes, and there have been many instances of violent protest and of sabotage. An attempt to enforce Afrikaans language requirements for black students led to the S oweto riots in 1976. S()me white politicians have called for the relaxation of minor r~strictions, referred to as \petty apartheid\ for the establishment of racial equality. Apartlleid has also received' international exposure. South Mrica was forced to withdraw from tile Commonwealth in 1961 when it became apparent that otlier member countries would not accept its racial policie~. In 1985 both the United Kingdom and the United States imposed seleo.tive sanctiollS on South Mrica. The \pass\ laws were abolished in 1986, although blacks were still prohibited from living in designatesJ. wh~te areas and the police were granted broad emergency powers.

Anyone interested should attend USA: Where Do· We Stand· In The World Pi.cture? By JILL PHILIPPS At present, Eu.rope and the U.S. are equally interdependent. However, with the EEC (Eurpoean Economic Community), whereby Western Europe will join together to strengthen their economic power, it seems that the U.S. is in danger of weakening in the world picture. Additionally, now that the S ovict Union is not pressuring Western Europe as much, the U.S. is proving to be less influential in Europe. Pres. George Bush wi8hes for the U.S. to r.emain an influential power of Europe. At the same time, he holds that NATO (of which he thinks should include United Germany) as well as the maintenance of nuclear arms are both essential. In order to keep NATO alive, Bush has intentions of strengthening NATO's political influences. However, Bush is apparently faced with significant opposition. One of the main challenges is the growing CSCE (conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe), which threatens the existence of NATO. The CSCE is made up of 35 constituents, including Moscow and France, both in support of hs replacement over NATO. Aside from tile CSCE, the Soviet Union strongly disagrees with even tlle concept of NATO's uniting wi.thGennany. W. Eu10pe's re-assessment of .the influence of NATO, which stands between the USA and Europe, seems to make the U.S. appear less important to Europe. To turn the tables around a little, the USA could probai>ly use the political power .of the EEC as support in the often erratic world forces (especially ,j:f Gorbachev were to go back the changes already made)» In total, the U.S. is faced with several opposing forces which will affect its future role in Europe, and the world. - I • , . ] ' 1 : ( .

No, The World Cup of Soccer, a tournament which comes our way every four years, to decide the World Championship in the W orld''s most popular game. This time around, though, the finals will include, in soccer terminology, a new Third World country, the United States, who qualified for the event for the first time since 1950. Their qualific·ation is even more encouraging when realizing that the finals will be held here, in the shlomp along U.S. in 1994. The berth America earned this year will hopefully help both the event as well as the sport when that day comes around. But this event is an inteJ;llational fiesta, not a one country show. lt is, to most countries, the most important athletic event, and though most of the time the partying mocd prevails, occasionally the blocd of the fans becomes too rich for the occasi()n (it is rumGred a war once started over a qualifying game)~ This time 11round, tllough the finals will inclucle, in soccer terminology, a new Third World country, tlte United States.

Gorbachev -passed a decree to legalize the private ownership of homes and buildings. At a glance, this may seem like a minor change since it is such a basic right in the U.S. However, in tbe Societ Union this change means breaking a 73 year old Communist law whereby all such property belonged irreversibly to the government. It also may lead to a reversal of the 1917 land decree in which the ownership of land was likewise nationalized. By the first of September, definite changes should be under way, including bank loans which would permit immediate construction. What is the object of this drastic change? First and foremost, Gorbachev hopes to put an end to the housing shortage ln the Soviet Union. Eventually, he would like to see every family be ab;le to make the chO<ice as to }Vllether they would j)refer to live in a . house or an apartment. Gorbachev wants to accelerate tile constructicn of homes and buildings by twice its present rate by Sept. 1. It is expected that by the year 2000, approximately 30 millicn new residences will be built. Considering; the weather conditions in the S.U., I simply hope that the construction is not completed in such haste that it is an unsatisfactory and flimsy job. This legali,.;ation of p>ri vate ownership ()f houses. and apartments shows to be a sizable step away frE)m its customary Communist ordinances. Nonetheless, whether poo(Jle will be able to sell this prqperty bcught from the government remains to be seen.

The U.S. has two things working in their favor. The first is that their opponents think they stink, which may all()w them to grab an early victory or tie. Tile second is that they are well conditioned, which will help them in the Italian heat -- especially against the more temperately accustomed Austria and Czechoslovakia. Some of the fca~urcd players to watch in the Cup include Diego Maradona (Argentina), Marco Van Basten (Netherlands), Lothar Matthews (De;utchland), and Mueller (Brazil).

Tbilisi State Uni-versity. The class vws largely composed of political science majors, and knowing mostly economics and sociology, I eloquently attempted to devise answers to a foreign barrage of questions: Summarizing the American educational system was my first duty, for students in the Soviet Union attend their institutes for a mandatory five graduate years, rather than four undergraduate years. Upon learning that some Union students are undecided about their career even after four years of study, the Soviet students recoiled in amazement. They could not believe that an arts student might atttnd law school. Tile academic discussion seemed boring to me. 1 enjoyed explaining about Union 1 s size, student body, and social life (fraternities and sororities, as we know them, do not exist in the Soviet Union). But really, I wanted to leap into a teal dialogue with the pre-law class. They were the future lawyers of the Soviet Union .. They were the lawyers who might be composing the new constitution of the now \Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic.\ These students might even hold some public office of the now ''Georgian \Can the United States understand that tbe Soviet Union is not the 'Evil Empire' of Ronald I • • t' 11 Reagan s 1magma ron.

I wanted to share my worldly ideas with them, and I hoped that the students would allow unrestrained thoughts to gusher forth from their hearts .and minds. Did these students really think of themselves as communists? Were they bent upon the sociolagical and economic ideals of Marxism? The .students surpassed my expectations. For almost an hour, I was asked, ''How do the people in the United States feel about Lithuania:? Do the students at Union know ~hat Georgia has declared itself independent of the Soviet Union, although it is actively working with the Soviet government? Can the United States und.erstand that the Soviet Union is not the 'Evil Empire' of Ronald Reagan's il)lagination?

From your travels in our ·country, what has been the most alien experience?\ And then, the inevitable question arose: 0 What do you think about the women here?\ IncideiJtally, all students were .interested in my doggedly creative answer. Overall, the students wanted io know whether American students understand that Soviet students are far from hostile toward Americans. The .message was cleat: Soviet students are anxious ;to make the most of GlasnO.st ~- to meet, to study, and tp debate the problems of the W<>rld with us.

t•~age 12 CONCORI)IENSJS, May 24, 1990 -------- Formded at Union College 1877--- NO More Excuses Over Gamma Phi Housing Applause must go out to Dean Mammola and the Administration. With his announcement that the possibility of Ganm1a Phi Beta receiving a house on campus will be ·strongly considered, Mammola undoubtedly made a lot of new friends. Well. patrons of Union College, let the buyer beware. For Gamma Phi to receive campus housing would be a singularly logical solution to the low occupancy problem. Surely the Administration has considered the ramifications of awarding a house to Gamn1a Phi. When the sorority was :colonized in 1986, it was with the understanding that the sisters would receive the first avaitable space on campus as a house. Since then, sections of Potter House and Raymond House have opened up, but have been turned into ordinary dom1itories. Undoubtedly, Gamma Phi was considered for these openings. The Administration ex.plains-and quite sensibly-that the campus may have been \over-Greeked and that the school needed the space for other occupants. These points may be debatable, but the Administration's stance was certainly reasonable. Now, the point seems undebatable. A house will be considered, but it should be a done deal. Gamma Phi has demonstrated that, even without a house, it is as strong as any other sorority .. Its large membership should indicate that it would have no problem filling a house of, say, 35 or 40 beds. What's more, Gamma Phi sisters routinely fill at least that many beds in dormitories anyway. Why not let them Hve together? The school would fill its vacancies, and a four year old understanding would be realized. If there is a problem with this, it should not be something that the Administration is investigating now. By now, they should k~ow what it would mean to give Gamma Phi a house. This Priority Comes First It is common knowledge to every student on campus who has had to conduct research for a particular class project. Schaffer Library is not the place to go for revelationary information on academic topics. Library resources, one of the most fundamental tools of a college education are lacking at Union. This problem must no longer be forgotten. As the average cost of a Union education approaches $20,000, the question of what priority library funding takes in the overall scheme of budget planning arises. When comparing Union to other comparable colleges (an action which is becoming more and more popular), it is disheartening to learn that our college is ranked thirty-six out of forty-one similar colleges in tertns of library expenditure per student. (Amherst was ranked first). These colleges charge _comparable tuition rates, and have approximately the same number of students as Union, but yet their library resources are far superior to Union's. It is true that the library budget has consistently increased over the past few years, but this increase has come at an alarmingly low rate. Over the past three years, the college has managed to increase the tuition rate by an average of just under ten percent, citing various justifications for doing so. Unfortunately, it seems as though the library has lost priority in the funding arena. Perhaps a re-evaluation of funding priorities is the first step in solving this problem. Over a year ago, the Administration outlined a possible plan for the expansion of Schaffer Library. it was suggested that an addition be put on to the library in the area in which the tennis courts now occupy. There has been little mention of this proposal recently, and it appears as though there is no plan to follow through with the idea. - Union must begin improving .the quality and quantity of Schaffer Library if we expect to continue to compare ourselves with those colleges on the \Bowdoin List.\ In the meantirr e, for those students interested in completing that last term paper, I think the bus leaves for Amherst in about an hour.

CONCORDIENSIS, May 24j 1990 Page 13 LETTERS '''Yes, We Let Him In!'' Prop<?sed Housing Meal Plan Grossly Unjust To the Editor: There have been two incidents .that have deeply upset me about the Union College community members in· tbe past coupie .of weeks. Both very different but very much the same in the shocking amount of ignorance shown by people who woo.ld refer to themselves as anything but ignorant, In attending the rally two weeks ago, I felt proud that a group of Union students s·l:lowed the guts and determination t<> put themselves in such a tenuous position as 'rally leaders'. Being one of the early arrivals, I felt for these students as they stood there in near solitude for what seemed like an eternity' challenging the Union community to un.ite. Becaase of these individuals, the .rally was. a great succes~. courage which Mr. Greg Oswitt displayed as he stood up there in solitude and he thanked his parents, his football coach, and members of the foundtion made me proud• Last Friday, I read an editorial in the Concordiensis condemning this same young man for his rea}nt actions which have been so widely publicized. This , article also pointed a finger at the Admissions Office appearing to say, \Well you let him in!\ While I certainly do not condone Mr. Oswitt's recent emo~ional explosion, I do feel that it is not for me to judge whetner he will be able to attend Union College in the Fall of '90. Rather it is up to the Oswitt family and the professionals whom they are currently working with to make that de.cision. To the Editor: It is late Spring term and once again it is time for the Union administration to announce another surprise, m~jor policy change .in student affairs, The sophomore mandatary .housing/meal plan proposal is outrageously unfair to all students concerned and coincidentally (of course) could put several fraternities in serious jeopardy. A fraternity house simply cannot thrive or survive with only juniors and seniors eating and living there, and the school knows this. The administration should be a little more considerate, in this regard, to the fraternities whose long history here includes housing and feeding the entire Union student body during the 1930's when the school could not afford to do so. Last year, Delta· Chi was ,evicted from a school-owned residence hall because they failed to maximize the occupancy potential of that building at a time· when on- campus housing was said to be in sharp demand. on·e short year later, not only is there officially no longer a !lousing shortage but rather, an excess. If the school reaUy can:t fill its housing it should at least let Delta Chi returri>to their old location and consider giving housing to other Greek organizations that have so requested; Perhaps the school is in need of something other·than a new president if it cannot properly manage its room and board systems after nearly two centuries' experience. Despite wh~it has been claimed, the \unpredictability\ .of students living on/off campus is probably not so very different from past years. This is not a new problem and the administration, obvio11sly not handling it well, is trying to make the students pay for its own ineptitude and mediocrity. There is no reason why the .school can't offer on a regular basis, sufficient and attr.:::~ctive room and board, without losing money. Fraternities and sororities have been doing so for years. This proposed p<>licy is unfair to independents as well as Greeks. Many students live and eat off campus because they cannot afford to pay the school's high room and board costs or because they are unsatisfied with what is offered, or both. A second year student should be allowed to decide where he/she will live and eat. Most of us have had the option of bringing our own lunch to school since about the third grade. Prohibiting, colle_ge students, for two years, from living and eating where they choose, is a bad joke for someone paying $20,000 per annum, and a good one for prospective students to laugh at on the drive out of Schenectady. The proposed housing/meal plan policy is grossly unjust to students and is the first major anti-Greek position that the school has taken. The student body should not have to suffer for Union's mismanagement. The administration might consider looking into night classes at the Cornell School of Hotel Management instead of student wallets and student affairs ..

CONCORDIENSIS, May 24, 1990 Page 1.3 LETTERS ----------------------------------------------------------~-- \Yes We Let Him In!\ To the Editor: There have been two incidents that have deeply upset me about the Union College commu11ity members in the past couple of weeks. Both very different but very much llle same in the shocking amount of ignorance shown by people who would refer to themselves as anything bt~t ignorant. ln attending the rally two weeks ago, I felt proud that a group of Union students sbowed the guts and determination to put themselves in such a tenuous p<>sition as 'rally leaders'. Being one of the early arrivals, I felt for these students as they stood there in near solitude for what seemed like an eternity, challenging the Union c<>mmunity to unite. Because of these individuals, the raHy was a great success. What disturbed me was that as I st~od watching the raHy, three Union officials passed by and inquired as to what was goiag on. Their response to my answer was a chuckle and a question. Why? My further explanation led to another chuckle, and a \Well you let them in!\ as they sauntered off. My answer, a simple but proud, \Yes we did!\ This past Monday night, I also felt proud as a prospective Union student, in front of a large crowd of people, accepted an award for being named the top scholar athlete in his high school football conference. This award was bestowed upon him not solely for his football prowess but because he carries a 9 5% average at Shenendehowa High School, ranking him in the top 3% of his graduating class. The courage which Mr. Greg Oswitt displayed as he stood up there in solitude aad he thanked his parents, his football coach, and members of the foundtion made me proud. Last Friday, I read an editorial in the Concordiensis condemning this same young man for his recent actions which have been so widely publicized. This article also pointed a finger at the Admissions Office appearing to say, \Well you let him in!\ While I certainly do not condone Mr. Oswitt's recent emotional explosion, 1 do feel that it is not for me to judge whether he will be able to attend Union College in the Fall of '90. Rather it is up to the Oswitt family and the professionals whom they are currently working w~th to make that decision. I applaud the students who led 'the rally'. It took a special kind of intestinal fortitude that most of us only wish we had. I for one am proud \We let them in!\ If Greg Oswitt can show equal fortitude and pull himself through his rough period, I will be equally as proud to say, \We let him in!\ As for the rest of the Union community, I hope we can remain open and in touch with what is going on around us, getting the facts before making a condemning statement.

Each person seen privately, individually ...• Proposed Housing Meal Plan Grossly Unjust To the Editor: It is late Spring term and once again it is time for me Union administration to aanounce another surprise, major policy change in student affairs. The sop.homore mandatory housing/meal plan proposal is outrageously unfair to all students concerned and coincidentally (of course) could put several fraternities in serious jeopardy. A fraternity house simply cannot thrive or survive with only juniors and seniors eating and living there, and the school knows this. The administration should be a little more considerate, in this regard, to the fraternities whose long history here includes housing and feeding the entire Union student body during the 1930!s when the school could not afford to do so. Last year, Delta Chi was evicted from a school-owned residence hall because they failed to maximize the occupancy potential of that building at a time when on- campus housing was said to be in sharp demand. One short year later, not only is there officiallY' no longer a housing shortage l>ut rather, an excess. If the sclnool really can't fill its housing it should at least let Delta Chi return to their o·ld location and consider giving housing to other Greek organizations that have so requested. PerhaiJS the school is in need of someLhing other than a new presiden:t if it cannot properly manage its room and board systems after nearly two centuries' experience. Despite what htts been claimed, the \unpredictability\ of students living on/off campus is probably not so very different from past years. This is not a new problem and the administration, obviously not handlin~ it well, is trying to make tile students pay for its own ine]Jtitude and mediocrity. There is no reason why the school can't offer on a regular basis, sufficient and attractive room anod board, without losing money. Fraternities and sororities have been doing so for years. This proposed policy is unfair to independents as well as Greeks. Many students live an<! eat off campus bee a use they cannot afford to pay th c school's higll room and boar<! costs or because they are un satisfied with what is offered, or both.

Page 14· CONCORDIENSIS, ··May 24, 1990 LETTERS Anger Calls For Rededication To the Editor: This letter responds. to Aram Fbch's \Stalin of Schenctady\ letter to the editor which appeared in last week's Ce>ncordiensis. Aram's letter does not provoke retaliation but clarification. Aram is negative, Ullinformed. and inactive. We can assume, therefore. that his letter was not a reflection of fact. His misconceptions' may hltve been taken for truth, however, and thus require ex. planation. Two facts will elucidate his misconceptions. 1: Dean Mammolfi showed up at the first We Care About -U- meeting, not specifically invited, as everyone else, but certainly welcome as someone who Cares About U. The question of funding arose, all eyes turned to Dean Marnmola and he obliged. By showing up and contributing to the discu~sion, Dean Mammola demonstrated his willingness to communicate with us. By providing funds from the Dean of Students office, Mammela supported students who are working to improve Union College. Fact 2: Last week's rally wa~ positive. Providing a forum for critical analysis of problems and experession of- concerns and backing up criticism with action is positive. Doing nothing ·but complaining is negative. All speakers were positively critical, none were negative. Aram Fuch's letter was negative. Dan Waible '91 Criticize Through Positive Action To the Editor: The We Care About U gH)Up has one ultimate oi)jective: to foster a better ca.mpus community by supplanting passive criticism with positive activism. Webster's denotation for p<Jsitive, 4a:(l) reads: capable of being constructively applied. We organized the rally with tllis concept in mind and will act on this model in the future. By encouraging c.on str u c tiv e dialogue between all members of the Union College community, We Care About U will consolidate Union's positive, problem-solving energy, and work for the most favorable, mutually acceptable ends. Communication between all campus groups needs to be improved. If we students do not communicate with each .other and with the administration we cannot expect our interests to be considered. We Care About U has established a network by which we can communicate our concerns. Most importantly. however~ because ALL members of the college community are free t() . share-- and ACT on-- their concems with us, We Care About U nullifies Fuchian criticism by obliging critics t() do more than pen their · sulkings. Ignorant, moping voices will be ignored; Voices raised in constructive dialogue will be heard and respected. Be heard and respected-- Do something for U! Dan Waible '91 Rally Wakes Up Dormant Student Body To the Editor: lt is apparent from the article appearing in the May 17 edition of Concordiensis entitled \Stalin of Schenectady\ that certain members of the cO>llege community need clarification on the motivation and purpose behind the college rally held on May 11. It is important to note that we do nDt refer to the event as \student administration, faculty, staff, or Mammola\ rally. This rally, organized by We Care About U, was designed to stimulate all members of the· community. Because this was the purpose, no members of the college C()mmunity were excluded from the organizational meetings. Even though all people were in vi ted, including the evil \Stalin of Schenectady\ that Mr. Aram Fuchs invented in ·his letter, only about 35 people bothered to attend these meetings. This was, however, a11 impressive turnout in the eyes of those who know and love our apathetic Union. Although some have illusions til at it was a session.- of brainwashing and pacification, we have never heard such progressive, encouraging, and open discussion of issues in most need of change. We find it completely counterproductive to exclude anyone interested in bettering Union College, God knows we need all the help we can get. We also find it self-defeating to exclude a member of the administration who is genuinely willing to contribute to progressive change within the college community. Mr. Fuchs would have us believe in every rumor and stereotype that our collective apathy has placed upon the administration, without ever investigating Dean Mammola's intentions on his own. It is our view that for too long student passivity has been misinterpreted for cooperation in dealing with prevalent issues on our campus. We bav~ the opportunity to work tog~ther with the campus community in order to make Union College better for ALL. There are times when it is necessary to burn buildings and Stage C'OU))S, as history has shown. We feel that the present situation at Union is dismal, but does not merit such drastic measures. Blaming the administration for the results of our owri apathy will not solve any problems. Union students have been dormant for far too long and now we have a chance to do something for ourselves. The purpose of the rally was to encourage the college community to do something in order to make Union better. Our first reaction upon reading Mr. Fuch's letter was one of anger and disappointment, but the fervor he demonstrates (misdirected as it is) is just the type of energy that is needed to make this- college a better place. We would like to invite Mr. Fuclls and anyone on the college community who shares this fevor and concern to attend our next We Care About U meeting at 12:30 p.m. in CC410 in Friday, May 25. Tllis will be just the next step. in showing bow much we care about our college. The new housing/dining services proposal is one such issue that needs to be dealt with by th:e students. It has not gone unnoticed. The present members of the group cannot succeed on their own. We need U! Te the hundreds that showed . up at the rally: we know you care so join us in the next step. To those who did not show up: we know you care, so join us in the next step. We have a . great opportunity so let's not · waste it! Peter P.l. Cowles ·~ 1 . Daniel Ross Gilbert 1 91 A Fuchian Misconception To the Editor: · Congratulations ar~ due Mr. Aram Fuchs for the very magnitude of his errors, as stated in the \Stalin of Schenectady\ editorial printed in the May 17 issue of Concordiensis. It must be clarified that our gathering was a Rally and not a \protest\, as Mr. Fuchs would have it. Perhaps :Mr. Fuchs could not read the over•sized .banner in the College. Center which clearly stated this difference. Again touching upon another Fuchian misconception, the energy behind the 'WE CARE ABOUT - U -' group formation was a mature sense of concern, not anger. The only thing that angers me about Union is seeing fellow students expressing ·immature and snivelling points of view about problems they have done nothing to address, much like Mr. Fuchs. I would remind Mr. Fuchs and all students, that passiveness does not equal cooperation. As the organizers, we never decreed that only positive things should be said. Rather, we asked that besides simply identifying problems, constructive solutions should be also be aired. Is this out of character with the American spirit of optimism? The misinformed slander of Mr. fuchs ·certainly is •. I also resent his implying that myself or any of tne other speakers/ organizers became \tools•• of Dean Marnrnola. This is an insult to all those students involved in the Rally and to Dean Mammola. Dean Mamrnola never S)J()nsored the Rally in any other manner than being kind enougb to supiJly us with space to meet, and materials for publicity. All the resources for planning, promoting. and executing the Rally f;ame fi;om one place, the free time of thos:e students involved. I, for one~ feel that this time was well spent. Those -who spoke on May 11 , acted in a mature and coorag~ous manner. I will not let the verbal pereirtnations of an ill-educated and uainformed student dampen the memory of an excellent day. · Benjamin M. Auslander U Can Make A Difference To the Union Colfege Community: How can we make a difference? The answer is simple. Be aware and get involved. Many students do not realize the number of opportunities there are to become an active member of our community. You will hear students talking about what is not getting done at Union College, rather than what they are doing to accomplish the changes they desire. The We Care About · ~ U- Committee was organized a month ago by students and professors in order to arouse the interests and concerns of our college community. We heard. about the first meeting through woid of mouth and an ad in the Concordiensis. At this first crucial meeting the Protest U Committee and the We Care- U- Committee, realizing their objectives were similar, decided to work together. Both committees were seeking to arouse the college community's Mountebanks Cabaret Thursday, May 24th 9 P.M. • CC interest by demonstrating that students, faculty~ adminis~ tration, trustees and employees are able to work together. The culmination of the meeting was the organization of the rally held on May 11. The objective ·Of the rally was not to pq>test tne administration but to show the community that involvement is the key in making a change. The ideal process for accomplishing changes in 141Y system is through cooperation and negotiation. There are many changes being sought in our community and it is through each indiviqua.l's initiative, motivation and awareness that successful changes will be made. The :rally was an invitation for students to become involved in the process that mffects their college careers. The rally, rather than a prote.st, was a demonstration to ev.:oke inte.rest and spirit in our community. Witll the arrival ,of a. new president in the next few months the students have the chance to establish flrin ground in building strong communication between the faculty and administration. It is now that students who ·care should realize they can make a difference! Befor~ condemning negotiation and cooperation we should all give it a .try. If you have any suggestions or concerns please attend the We Care A.bout -U- meeting on Friday, May 25, at 12:20 p.m. in the College Center Audil:c:lrium. Anyone interested is enc()uraged to come and help us male a change. Sincerely; Amy Rosenfeld '92 Liz Wales '92

CONCORDIENSIS, May-24; 1\990- Page 15 · Multi-culturalism Redefined To the Editor: This article is in response to the articles entitled \ALAS Demands Deemed Incomplete\ and \ALAS Methodology Counterproductive.\ The articles illustrate how little the two authors know about multi- culturalism.

The writers say confusion, and frustration,\ yet they praise the Sociology Department for their action and say nothing specific about the complaints of the two offended women. Is it a minor matter that statements made in a class at Union were inferred as racist?\ If it was a minor matter, why didn't the two students forget about it? Why wasn't it settled between the teacher and the students? Why did it become so important'? Why was a forum necessary to discuss the conflict? Racism is a very serious matter, but not so serious, I guess, if you're a dean at Union College. By allowing this professor to be a dean,. the administration is supporting the same insensitive attitude towafd diversity and multiculturalism at Union expressed in the two letters critical of ALAS. If this professor remains dean, Mr. Rybarczyk and Mr. Howard have nothing to fear from ALAS because ethnocentricity will be the rule at Union. Alas!

CONCORDJENSJS, May 24, 1990 LETTERS A Metered Solution A Call for Conduct 1Jo the Editor: Just a few thoughts regarding the recent parking dilemma here at Union College. The school being the financial wizard that it is should install parking meters along all college roads. These meters would be roegulated so as to allow for one hour and five minute parking on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday and PNO hours and five minutes on Tuesday and Thursday. The installation would solve two problems. First, it would alleviate those \long term parking\ students by forcing them to run back to refeed the meters so as not to be towed off campus. Second it would be a large source of income to which the school could enjoy. It is my recommendation that the school put this income towards their alumni fund. This is because the school in the past four years has continually .offended the student body and will need this income to supplement its alumni fund. No student here in his. right mind should donate money to a school which has persistently ignored the opinions and suggestions of its student body. '90 Andrew Frost To the Editor: Due to a recent incident the Student Conduct Committee feels it necessary to remind the students of Section IX of the Student Conduct Code: Failure to comply with the proper requests .of College officials, including members of the Security and Safety Depar;tment, a·cting in performance of their .duties, or to identify oneself or produce an identification card to these officials when asked. · Officers of the Security and Safety Department are authorized to levy summary fines for failure to produce ID cards or for incidents of misconduct. Stude'11ts are required to carry ID cards for tile protection of the college community.. · The Student Conduct Committee Just A Little Common Sense? Apologies In Order , To lhe Editor: This letter is in response to the letter written last week by Peter Katz. Yes Peter I am sorry that you were not able to run for the position you desired. In addition I am sorry that the guideline sheet attached to the petition did not state that someone who knowingly will be on a term abroad cannot run for a student forum position. Forgive me if I seem a little presumptuous, but I would think it common sense that in order to be a representative, one would need to be present and active in the environment which lhey are representing. Another one of your concerns deals with what you call a bias against allowing those who go on fall and winter terms abroad to run for a forum position. Once again; those people know in advance that they will not be here, whereas anyone going on a spring term abroad does not find out if they are accepted until that year. If during the course of the year, the Student Forum finds that a member will be absent for an extended period of time, that position will be filled by holding an auxiliary election. The case of John Meier is, however, different. John is the Junior Trustee, and his responsibilities lie in attending the Board of Trustee meetings and reporting back to the forum. Regardless of John's being in Washington this term, he has attended all Board meetings ami relayed the results of those meetings. Being that the Junior Trustee's job is limited in this scope,. we felt that John could still perform his ·job, and he has shown us that our decision was right. As I mentioned before, had John had a position such as Vice President of Academics, which requires several weekly meetings on campus, there would have been an auxiliary election to replace him. Another part of your letter atttacks Mike Schulitz for being derelict in his duties concerning this guideline sheet that angered you so. I do not know where you got your information, which I am sure that you researched very thoroughly, but it is wrong. The Senior Trustee is responsible for these guidelines. Then you go further to suggest that maybe Mike should spend more time making sure that he performs his student government dutie~ instead of putting his energie~ toward trying to better Unioll College. Maybe you, Peter~ should spend more time getting your facts straight, instead of , :blowing air. You seem to be among the large number of people on this campus that likes to air their grievances but let someone else do something about it. Maybe my eyes are growing weaker in their old age, but I fail to recall seeing you at any Student Forum meetings this year witll suggestions to help make Union a better place. I personally take ali responsibility for the guidelines that led you astray , and I also feel very guilty about the whole situation. Why do I feel guilty? Because it was so thoughtless and stupid of me to assume that everyone is blessed with common sense. Perhaps maybe we could have reached a compromise, such as your flying in every week from China to perform your responsibilities, but I guess it's too late for that. Sincerely yours, David G. Cohen, President of the Student Forum To the Editor: · I would like to take this opportunity to publicly apologize to Mr. Michael 0. Schulitz. In my letter last week I accused Mr. Schulitz of being responsible for the guidelines for the Student Forum elections. It has come to my attention that this is not the responsibility of the Vice· President of Administration,. but rather of the Election Board (which is composed of lhe two trustees and three class representatives). The blame I placed on Mr. Schulitz properly belongs on the shoulders of these people. I would like to mention that the iilformation I originally printed was given to me by three separate members· of Student Forum, on three Separate oceasions. This goes to show how poorly our Student Government functions. I would still like to get some answers pertaining to my previous letter. I would appreciate an explanation of the situation. I don't think it should go unresolved. Once .again, my sincere apologies to Mr. Schulitz. No malice was intended on my part towards him personally. Sincerely, Peter Katz '91 .. .

CONCORDIENSlS, May 24, 1990 Page 17 SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY Did You now? B.y WENDY TAUBER. and ALYN WHELCHEL Did :you know that your car can be a hazard to the environment? You car is not only environmentally desiruc- tive w:hile :running, hut also when sim:Ply getting gas. Escaping gas. vapors, such as butane, pollute the atmosphere when evapcrating helpin,g to create ozone smog. More and more, gas stations are installing plastic. hoods oo the nozzles to prevent the escaiJe of these e:xcess val'lors. Other vapors. such as carbon dio)cide aQ.d nitrogen oxide, are also emitted from your car. For every gallon of gas a car uses it emits 20 Jl01lnds of. carbon di0xide. If yol!lr_ car is gas efficient it not oniy saves you money b11t also helps tbe environment. Cars also produce 34% of the n1trogen o:dde released in the United States. Nitrogen ox:icle causes acid rain; fewer cars equal Jess acid ram. Another problem with cars is leaky air conditioners. Fr~on is the major coolant used in car air conditioners, unfortunately freon is a chlotefluoroc'ltbon. As you may remember from previous articles,. CFC's destroy the ozone layer and contribute to the greenhouse effect \Leaky auto air conditioners are the single largest source of CFC emissions to the atmosphere in the U.S.\ (NRDC). Tire.s alsa have great potential to endanger the environment when abused and discarded carelessly. The better· care we take, the longer a tire lasts and the fewer will show up in landfills. Underinflated tires can waste up to 5% of the car's fuel. Tire recycling is faitly new, most tires end up in landfills where they float to the top because they trap gas inside them. Tires also occupy an unprecedented amount of space in tbe the landfills. Each year up to 240:-260 million tiies are thrown away. In N.Y. alone, . 1/2 inillion cubic yards of landfill space is filled with old tires. These facts and figures are astonishing, bu:t there are ways we can help to alleviate the problem. Helpful Hints: 1.) l3e aware and use the vapor catchers properly, and don't let excess gas spill allowing the vapor easy access to the air. 2.) Make sure your tires are properly inflated. Your tires will last longeF, saving you money in the long run. 3.) If you must use an air conditioner in the car make sure it is not leaking and if it is get it fixed properly. Simply replacing the freon just allows the CFC to keep evaporating into the atmosphere. Get some 'fresll air and leave your windows open instead. 4.) Don't always leave your car idling; After about a minute it is more fuel efficient to restart your car. Blac.ks Have Higher Ca~ncer Risk - Factors Poi·nt to Diet, Smoki.ng and Alcohol Black Americans are more likely to develop and die from cancer than White Americans, according to information presented during National Minority Cancer Awareness Week, Aprill5·20. Most e:xperts believe the higher cancer death rates are due, not to a genetic difference in Blacks, but to lifestyle factors and later detection <!f the disease. Lovell A. Jones, Ph.D., a nationally respected cancer researcher at M.D. Ande.rson Cancer ·ceater and one of .the founders of Minority Cancer Awar~ness Week, indicated Blacks' overly high rates could be· l<>:wered significantly by dispelling commonly held myths associated with cancer and changing diet and lifestyle. \Attitude is the first challenge,\ said Dr. Jones, the editor Of an acclaimed new book, Minorities and Cancer. \African-Americans are more likely to deny or ignore cancer's warning signs, possibly because o.f a perception that cancer is a White person's disease. Because of that, and more limited access to health care among lower- income groups, the disease is often detected at a later stage. \There's also a common belief among minorities that you can't prevent cancer,\ Dr. Jones added. \That's just ·not true. You can stop smoking and limit alcohol intake. You can change yow diet.\ According to research cited in Pr. Jones' book. the cancer death rate might be reduced by 30 percent through changes in diet. Two of the most nrevalent types of cancer, breast and colon, have been strongly linked to a diet high in fat and low in fiber. \African-Americans have a higher incidence of colon cancer and eat more fat. especially animal fat, and less fiber than Whites,\ Dr. Jones sajd. \They also eat less of several vitamins that may play a part in cancer prevention. including vitamins A and C.\ The American Cancer Society and the National Cancer Institute both say all Americans may reduce their cancer risk by eating fewer high-fat foods and more high- fiber foods, such as whole grain breads and cereals, fresh fruits and vegetables. The Cancer Society also recommends eating more foods rich in vitamins A and C and limiting consumption of cured, pickled or sm<lked foods. Cigarette smoking is another documented cancer risk factor. Black Americans are more likeLy than Whites to smoke, and to smoke cigarettes higher in tar and nicotine. Hispanic men also are more likely than Whites to smoke cigarettes. Blacks, particularly Black men, are more at~risk than Whites for several forms of canper, including esophageal, stomach, colon, larynx, lung, prostate, and pancreatic cancer.

SCIENCE & TECHNO.LOGY Outside The Bubble By DON VALERIO Science & Technology Editor Growing Fear of D-eadly Bacteria According to the Federal Centers for Disease Control the bacteria that killed puppeteer Jim Henson last week may be more virulent and widespread than at any other time in the past 50 years. The bacteria, a type of group A streptococcus, causes the pneumonia that killed Henson as well as a variety of other disorders, including relatively mild ailments, like .skin infections, to potentially lethal diseases such as rheumatic fever, scarlet fever, and severe blood diseases. New studies show that the more serious types of group A streptococcal infections may be increasing. The studies also show that the bacteria that causes the diseases may be becoming more lethal itself. Although the number of cases of infecton have increased, doctors at the FCDC said that the rate was still very low and that there was no need for widespread concern. The best defense against any bacterial illness is early detection. Common symptoms of all pneumonias are fever above 101 degrees, difficulty in The Union Co.llege Phllosophy Department is pleased to announce the following colloquim The Openness of History by Joseph Margolis Temple University May 25, 1990 3:45P.M.

Evolutionary Link Reported Study of a 2()9-million-year- old skull has convinced scientists at the University of Toronto that a reptile about the size of a modern cat was probably an ancestor of the human race. The skull, discovered in 1897, has spent most of the years sin¥e then in storage at the American Museum of Natural History. Its discoverers believed that it was a pelycosaur, a type of reptile that flourished before the rise of dinosaurs.Researchers at Toronto, however, have concluded that the skull is actually the missing link that closes the gap in the fossil record leading from primitive reptiles to man. The Toronto study concludes that the skull belongs to an animal intermediate between the pelycosaurs and the later therapsids, which were \mammal-like\ reptires. In :fact, the skull is probably the oldest known tbereapsid and not a pelycosaur at all. The pelycosaurs were probably cold~blooded and more active than their reptilian contemporaries. From the pelycosaur line arouse the therapsids, tnammal-li'ke reptiles resembling modem wolves. They were probably wann-blooded. and fur covered. The therapsids were later eclipsed by a line that included crocodiles and dinosaurs. But small, furry descamlants of he therapsids kept the mammal- like design going until the dinosaurs eventually became extinct, opening up . new evolutionary niches for the mammals, that eventually led to man. Also In the News ... -A study by the Congressional Office of Technology Assessment reports that attempts to safeguard the public ag,ainst more than 65,000 toxic chemicals, ranging from industrial drugs to food additives to cosmetic ingredients. that attack the nervous system have been ineffective.

Page 20 CONCORDIENSIS, May 24, 1990 ~~ ARTS & ENTERTAINMENT ~----~------------------~------------------------~ Better Th<ln Bran: The WRUC Record RevieWs By RON EUGENIO and TODD SWARTZ Bruce Dickinsonn Tattoed Millicnare (Columbia) For almost ten years now, Bruce Dickinson has been the voice behind the success of the legendary Iron Maiden. Now he is releasing his first ever solo project, before he returns to Iron Maiden to finish their upcoming release and world tour scbeduled for late 1990. Unfortunately his solo LP, unlike the seven Iron Maiden albums, does not rock from start tc finish. The lead cut is entitled \Son of a Gun\ and it is by far the best S()ng on the album. It starts off slow and then Bird on a Wire Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles The Hunt for Red October Cadillac Man Tales from the Dark Side culminates into an ulti:a-heavy tune with pounding drums, searing guitars, and ear- splitting vocals~ However, it is all downhill from there. The next cut on the aloum is the' title track and first single, \Tattooed Millionaire\. This s0ng reeks of commerciality. causing the overly polished and produced guitar riffs to be unable to cut tluough warm butter, not even to mention a pair of speakers. The choruses in this song stand 20 feet high reminding me of every Bon Jovi song ever recorded as well · as every Def Leppard song from \Hysteria\. But wait, it gets worse, with \Gypsy Road\ .the token ballad mandatory on every hard rock Bird on a Wire Pretty Woman Miami Blues Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Earnest Goes to Jail Driving Miss Daisy Call Theaters for Show Times.

It is hoped that it will become an annual event. The project has received partial underwriting by Key Bank. The tour features the work/exhibit space of area artists representing work in various media. The tour includes the Union College Arts Building an architectural gem built in the 1820s and refurbished and reappointed in the early 1980s. The Union Colledge Gallery will feature an exhibit of outstanding student work including photography, sctdpture, prints, paintings, and drawings. Two Schenectady sculptors, Danie.l Ben-Shmuel and Robert Blood are on the tour. Tickets for the •• Artist Studio~Open House Tour\ are $1(), and $8 for senior citizens and students. They are available album these days that shoots bands into the platinum bracket (where do 12 or 13 year olds get the money to buy these albums anyway). The stylus continues its pathetic journey through generic commercial metal with such snoozers s \Born~ in '58\ \ZlilJu Lulu\ and \Hel:l on Wheels\. The album hits rock bottom with the cover of the David Bowie classic, \All The Young Dudes\. Bruce Dickinson destrays this classic song irreparably, boring the listener more than the worst preceptorial class. Although the album is extremely commercial and bland it does have two good points: the first is Bruce Dickinson's voice bas never sounded better, extinguishing the attacks of those critics who have. claimed that he has been losing his voice over the last ten years. The second is $e lyrics are excellent in their douMe meanings, such as the double edged implications of \Lickin' the Gun\ which not only has the obvious, yet minor, sexual implications, but is actually a direct and brutal attack of the hypocrisy of governm,ent and the idea of saving the world from itself. Othe.r n()table lyrics ate about g·un control, the abuse of drugs, aDd the comical lyrics of \D\ n· n· \ .h. h lYe, . lVC, · lVe , W lC . need nc e:x:planation. This album is a large WRUC 89.7 departure for Bruce Dickinson from Iron Maiden, and unlike most of the Iron Maid,en albums, it wiU fall short in satisfying the expectations of metal fans. Columbia says this album will have kids rocking throughout the summer, anfl: they~re right; this album is a 13-year-old's wet dream come true. sort of like New Kids on the Block. However unfortunate it may be; we METAL fans will have to wait till the end of the year to hear the brand new Iron Maiden album which is to go back to their older, heavier style than ,their last two albums.

By ANDREW CONWAY and ROBERT VIALARD~I Following- his Oscar nominating (lerformance in Oead Poet's Society, Robin WiUiaoos returns te the silver screen in ,Cadillac Man .. Williams returns to his familiar a~ting ground: comedy. Pairt>;d with the ever- hysterical Tim Robbins, the two actors create a cornical scenario about the near death of a sleazy car salesman. Director Roger Donaldson can be credited with _giving Williams and Robbins plenty of freedom in their .acting. Williams plays Joey O'Brien, a womanizing car salesman from Queens with an ex-wife and daughter. A salesman at Turgeon Auto, Joey is in danger of losing his job. Joey's f11ture all dep~nds upon \Sunday Sale Day\ where he needs to sel112 cars or lte is out. As Sunday rolls around, Joey has contacted everyone from his ex-llrother-in-law to his mob friends in order for him to meet the quota. However, the' day ~takes an unexpected turn whe'n the sectetary 1 s husband, Larry (Tim Robbins)., :crashes his motorcylce inte» the showroom armed with a b()mb and a M -16 .rifle. Larry demands to know who is ,responsible for creating their \dbmestic problems\ The l10stage situation allows Robbins and Williams to give the audience rnany comical moments.. Eventually, after Joey's in·sistent persuasion, Larry recognizes the magnitude {)f the situation~ The: \hostage situation serves as the primary comical feature ()f the movie. The only problem with Cadillac Man is that it takes 50 minutes to develop. Williams tums in typical c-omical performance but Robbins steals lhe show as the psychotic and duele:Ss Larry. As for bit players, watch for actres~ Tu-Sum who plays a wonderfully sarcastic waitress in the Chinese restaurant across the street from Tur,geon Auto. The movie is humorous and comical, especialJy when Williams speaks directly to the audience. However, this 100- minute film takes too long to get started. Before the hostage taking, the movie is very bland and lacks comical emphasis. However, the hostage situation does provide some memorable comical! ines. The best advice for moviegoers is to see this movie because it's the only good one out there. Jiowevcr, if you were not planning on seeing a movie, don't change your plans. Cadillac Man is the perfect campus movie or home rental. Spend $3.50 to see it on a rainy day, but don't waste your six dollars to see it at night.

There are not enough hours in a week to compose my usnal artwork. And besides., Cooeordiensis and WRUC played softball when this column is usually · written. so this week I have to fak~ it. Listed below is a mytiad of information from all walks of sports which should entice and enthrall you. Ho]efully. Did you know Azeglio Vicini, coach of the Italian national :;occer team, informed his players last week that they were to abstain from sex until after the World Cup tournament ends on July 18. The coach indicated that his plarers ··would be so busy tryiilg to win an unprecedented fourth world ti tie that they wo11ld require no other . diversioms. I think what he meaDs is that they should save their scoring attempts for the soccer field. Did y.ou know that .since 1970, only six teams in the Naticmal Hockey League have won the Stanley Cup. This year will not bring a · new winner. as the Edmonton Oilers have wpn four Cups, while the .Boston :Bruins have w011 two, in the JJast 20 years. The other four teams are the Morrtreal Canadiens (7 titles), the New York Islanders (4), the PhiJadelp.hia Flyers (2), and the Calgary Flames (1). Di.d you know that when Mark Gastineau retired from football two yeats ago, he inte11ded to try his luck in the ring. Fo:r those-- of you who have: missed the exploits of the New Yor:k JP.ts former dancing sack:ster, the 33-year-old Gastineau is ready to launch his new athletic career in professional boxing. His oruy previous experience. throwing puncnes, however, were in a few fistfights long before his gridiron career began:. Gastineau has .. been tt:aining witb. Jimmy Glenn, a former comerman for Floyd Patterson, and he says he is in the best shape of his life. \\My first fight will be for nothing at all, like $5,000. It won't be Mike Tyscn or George Foreman,\ Gastineau said. I am sure that Tyson and Foreman are resting a little bit easier after hearing . that. Djd you know that there have been 42 no-hitters in the major leagues since 1970·. Each league has contributed 21, and the month of September has seea t;he most with 11. Did you know that Los Angeles Dodgers' outfielder Juan Samuel has a .260 career batting average and a salary of $1.35 million, an-d San Francisco Giant's pitcher Mike LaCoss has a 91-94 career record and makes $1.15 million a year. San Diego Padres outfielder Tony Gwynn, who has won four National League batting titles, has a career batting average of .332 who has hit 17 points higher than anyone in the league over the past five years and 24 points higher than anyone else in the leagne over the past 10 years, earns $1,066,667, less than LaCoss, Samuel, and six of his own teammates. Something's wrong here. Did you know that Baltimore reliever Greg Olson's scoreless inning streak was stopped at 41 last week. This streak put him in s<lme of baseball's best company. The 41 scoreless innings ties him with three others, and it ranks just behind Cy Young, who hurled 45 consecutive scoreless innings. The major league leaders are Walter Johnson with 55 2/3 and Orel H~rshiser, witl} 59. By the. way-Olson's ERA i~ 0.49 this year. Wow, looks like he is losing his stuff. Did you know that the Oakland A's (ha-ha-ha) swept their first six games this year against the New York Y ank:ees. The composite score was 24-4 and the A's ~ha-ha) pitching staff had an ERA of 0.64 over 56 innings. The Yankees were 33 for 195 against Oakland, which calculiues to a .169 batting average. Yuk! Did you know that former defensive end Lyle Alzado is making a comeback in :professional football. He turned 41 years old in April and hasn't played a game since an Achilles tendon injury ended. his 1985 season. However, Alzada says he is ready to help the Los Angeles/Oakland Raiders return to dominance. As for a return to the game at his age after such a long layoff. Alzado said, \The bottom line is that I like to kick a-s and I can still do that.\ Good luck grandpa Did you know that another former NFL player ·is :attempting a comeback. Art Schlichter has signed a contract with the Detroit Drive of the Arena Football League. He was a first-round draft pick of the then Baltimore Colts in 1982. Schlichter was then suspended for the 1983 season because of a gambling problem. H~ returned in 1984, but was released in the middle of the 1985 season. In 1988, he ,played briefly for the Ottawa Roughriders of the Canadian Football League. 1 am sure everybody feels that they don't want to hear anything more; or more accurately, everybody feels sick. So I will end it here. I'm feeling kind of queasy myself. WRUC Knows Softball On Tuesday. May 22, With the bases loaded, and winning run scored. Actually, what really happened is that WRUC made fewer errors, had more hits, and fielded better. The final score was WR UC 7, Concordiensis 4.

HULL ELECTED NEW PRESIDENT Board - The last in a series of seven articf~s covering the search tutd selection of a new College Pre#flent By R. REED WHIDDEN In a process that extended over the past nine rnonths, the Board of Trustees has at last selected Roger H. Hull as president of Union College. Hull is \looking f-Qrward to the challenge of Union College, and to leading it to the bicentennial and into the 21st century.\ Hull will send a memo out to those in the Beloit College C()mmunity expressing the two reasons for this career change. The first is a personal one. He ltas family here in the East and he finds it is time to retmn. He would also like to give ilis wife a chance to pursue her own career. His second reason is an institutional one. He finds that the life span of a presidency should be about a decade. Hull of Trustees Votes Unanimously has spent the last nine years at Beloit. The Board of Trustees met in . New York City on Tmesc:la:y to make their final decisi()n. This · was the only item on the agenda at the meeting. After a · Sllmmation of the search and selection process and a review- of the three candidates that took over an hour~ the Board voted unanimously in favor cf Roger Hull. Meyer stated that the Board \expressed many times how happy they wete with Hull\ as the final choice. The search began in the fall of the academic year in the hands of a committee f()nned by trustees, adm}nist:rators, faculty, alumni, and students. Hull was the preferred candidate amoDg students, faculty and administration alil\e. This Committee was ILeadoo by ·. Joseph Hinchey '47. After· having received approximately 200 applications,, and asking others for their application. the Search Committee narrowed it cl()wn to a final pool whiCh was tllen handed to the Selection . Committee. The Selection Committee was also composed of students, faculty, and trustees. John Meyer '90, senior trustee and member of the Search and · Selection Committee, was the student body Iink to the Roger- H. Hull presidential selection process. He, with the other membe-rs of the Selection Committee, held lengthy interviews w~~ the . final few candidates. Out -of · this final group (numbering around ten), James England, provost of Swarthmore College, Arthur Taylor, dean of questions that pertained to the burning issues facing our community today. He was noted for his life-long participation in :higher educati()n, but criticized for lack of familiarity in other faculty and the Business · r;wmr';'t-'\''''''!l;;¢:; School at Fordham University, and Roger Hull, president' of . · Beloit College were asked to come to campus. Each candidate was asked to come in order to view the campus, and meet the administrators, faculty. and student body. England was the first of the final three to come to Union and was met with an · outstanding number of students for the open forum. He faced areas. Making up for England's weaker points was the second candidate, Arthur Taylor. His current position at Fordham makes up the bulk of Taylor's higher educational experience. He is first and foremost a \deal maker\ a businessman. For his hand in the business world many students called him the better of the two candidates. The third and final candidate was Roger Hull. Hull seemed to strike this balance between the two. His experience as president of another college have him strength in all the areas questioned by the students, faculty, and administrators. Hull's start at Union has yet to ·.be determined. He is meeti11g with the Board of Trustees of Beloit to determine the best time in the Fall to leave Beloit. He wants \to do . what is fair on Beloit's end.\ John Meyer commented that he is \very very happy\ with the election of Hull and feels that he is \far and away the best candidate\ to step into t11e presidency. He also felt that the members of the Search and Selection Committees \did a superb job~\ Meyer also commented that he was delighted with the entire search and selection· process. He found it to be \open and so many people were involved that it made Union's process unique. It was the best way it could have been handled.\

Page 2 CONCORDI£NSIS~ May 31, 1990 LETTERS Don't Exclude Student Body To the Editor: Recently. much space ·in the Concordiensis has been devoted to debate about ALAS and its list of requests of the Board of Trustees. I write in hopes that I .can get the student body involved in the issue. ALAS states that its members' cultural heritages are being neglected here at Union, and as a result its members do not feel as comfortable at Union as tl1ey feel they should. Their solution is what they refer to as rn ulticulturalism, which I interpret to mean a state of being in whicil all . cultural heritages are equally acknowledged and accepted, and where people are judged not by their cultural heritage but by their own personal merits. I am wholly in favor of this concept, and I will not accept any justification anyone might bring forward which argues for allowing prejudice and racism to continue, here or anyv,ihere. Multiculturalism lies in the future, I truly believe. However, I will not allow the student body to be excluded from helping to choose the methods we use for attaining our goal. ALAS recently put forth its plan (which I commented on as a \devil's advocate\) and the Administration is considering its future actions. This is where we,comein and give our input; I'm sure ALA.S and the Administration waiJt our input. In fact, I'll. bet the Administration is quite fed up with our past attitude: waiting until some plan is in place, and rhen screaming abo.._t it. Let's get involved before action is taken, and let\s .make it everyone's action. This fundamental change will benefit us alt When all Union students .are completely at ease on this campus, all of us will be able to realize our full potential, not just those who are in the .majority. A degree from Union vrill mean tiJat much mote. These benefits can be achieved without turning the werld inside out. All it takes is a little effort and cooperation. It's so easy for someone who has something (the majority) to teU someone who doesn't have it (the minority) to wait a little longer for it. Let's stop taking the easy way o~;~-t, I think of my friends who are ALAS members and those :wbo are not when I say: no more 'Waiting.

They were hidden from me for four years. Jay chance, I took a course with a professor who cared enough to point them out to me. These are the names of the Union College alumni who gave their lives for the United States during World War I. Memorial Chapel was dedicated to them, and their names are engraved into the rear, stone wall of the building. Unfortunately, the college has found the space in front of their . ' ' . names to be a convenient place to store platforms and folding chairs. Naturally, pU1tforms and folding chairs ate an eye-sore, so a folding facade llas been placed to hide the area. By hiding the names of the alumni for whom the chapel; was built, this college has spit in the face of its history. Union College has vandalized Memorial Chapel. Union complains now and then of student vaiJdalism to school property. Does a school lilce Harvard have the same problem'? I doubt it Schools such as Harvard have a proud tradition which is passed on to its students. Students at Harvard have too much pride in their school's history to vandalize tbe buildings. How can Union expect its students to be proud of theiT school's history and traditio11 it the faculty, staff, or admillistration show disrespect for the same? Don't hide Union's history. So someone might have to walk twenty feet furtller to get an extra chair; big deal. Bring pride back to Union College. David E. V andigrifft, '90 L.etters to the Editor do not necessarily ·~ reflect the opinions of th.~ Editorial Board - Proposed Calendar Nonsensical · • To the EditOr: As many of you probably know, ~ cammittee appointed by President Morris to propose fall term calendars for ·the years 1991-1995 has made its preliminary report. In brief, the student- administration-faculty commit- tee, which is chair.ed by Prof. ·. Seth Greenberg, has chosen to recommend that we begin early · · enough (usually right after · Labor Day) to finish by Thanksgiving in all five years. I find this especially sw:prising inasmuch as the committee was given nearly free rein in its charge ancl }'et, in my view, proposed calendars which ha:ve serious shertcomings. In addition, there is litHe more time in December' (some had no preference), mpre time in September (j;e .• ;.t l~nger summer and shorter Christmas break) was favored by a 3 to 1 margin. If the committee did not consider the length o{ summer break to be important, did its proposals arise from a second major concern among faculty and students. conflicts with the Jewish holidays? To the contrary. there is a readily available alternative which is substantially better in this regard than the committee's proposals: the \middle start\ calen¢rr I have favored. Undet this alternative, the dates for Which are listed below, we wotJld :have one week ofclasses plus exams after 'rilanksgiving, to make four extra trips home in five years sound like 1eligious sensitivity to you? If you ate still not convinced ·:that the· committee's ()ttly real ]lriority was endrng by Thanksgiving, look carefully at its·proposed calendars for 199'1 and 1994. In 19<)1. the committee has cut the summer break to 11 weeks, 3·days-a week shorter than any break since 1970, tbe beginning year of my study. We would finish by November 20, a flllU week ·before Thanksgiving~ In 1994, the .c()mmittee has (1} freshmen registering ·on a Sundar~ (2) no break at all between the .end of . .

The most 1 ' obvious implication ·Of the committee's · proposed calendars is a · continued erosion of the length of the summer break (measured . by the number of weeks bet,ween Commencement and the first day of Fall term classes). Student opinion to the contrary notwithstanding, the . calendars of the last few years have departed significantly from our past practices: in every year from 1970-1984, which means we would begin Orientation two or thr~ weeks after Labor Day weekend. In 1991, the committee would begin classes on September 5, meaning that Jewish students wanting to celebrate Rosh Hashonah (September 9 and 10) and Yom Kippur (September 18) with their families would need to make two. trips home; under my proposed calendar. they would not come to campus until September 21 (start of Orientation). In 1992, both holidays are· well after the start of classes, though under the .. Average 14 wks, 2 'days 13 wks, 4 days t2 wks, 4 da~s 12 wks, 2 days Thanksgiving.

As late as 1987, we began Classes on September 16~ In my opinion (perhaps the committee does not agree?), research and other expectations of faculty members have been rising as the summer break has been shrinking. The committee also chose to ignore the results of the faculty survey taken in the Fall term of 1988; among those faculty members who expressed a preference either for more -time in September or committee's proposal (but not mine), Yom Kippur comes at the end of the fourth week, which is often midterm exam time. In 1993, Yom Kippur is after the start of Classes on either calendar, but Rosh Hashanah occurs after students are ·already here under the committee's proposal; before Orientation under mine. In 1994, students could celebrate Rosh Hashonah at home under ·either plan, but under mine they would also start Orientation after Yom Kippur.

The problems arose when we were · trying to choose between Trump and Gumby.\ No · official vote was taken according to Richard Day, secretary of the :Board. There was, however, an established maj~rity in fa:v()r of Trump. Mano Cuomo, after a phone call from President Morris, turned out for a rousing .13~ hour speech in fav:or of Gumby. A second nine hour plea for Gumby was given by Jack Maranville. and a five hour speech on ·behalf of \would have made an excellent president:\ He also added· that .

DISTORDIENSIS, June 5 or 6, 2037 1DtstnrbtfttSili URINAL Y SI.S Bush Had Been Top Candid.ate Students· No Longer Committee Publishes Startling Statistics By SAM DONALDSON Washington Correspondent The President of the United States, George Bush, had been tbc front-runner all along in the search for a new Union College president. Apparently, Bush had made a verba.l agreement with the College last September that he would resign his White House post if offered the joh in Schenectady, according to a senior White House official. The search committee was impressed by his pledge of \no new tuition hikes.\ Bush was disqualified from the search, however, when students expressed that he was ''too liberal\ for the tastes of the Union student body. There is also word that had Bush been named the Union president, an intricate deal concocted with the People's Court would have had Dan Quayle, the Vice PreSident, deported to Tazmania on charges . of \not minding his own business~\ · The deal was intended to alleviate fears of Mr. Quayle assuming the highest office in the land, The · scheme fell through, however, when Quayle's father, after a careful screening of the po)mlar television show, contended that Judge Wopner \wasn't really a judge.\ When asked to comment on the matter, Quayle said that he \still liked the judge,\ ~d that he \couldn't Jiave made it through law school without him.\ . Continued from page 1 spiraling effect in the behavioraL cyde until students are so aware and so active that we might see them involved to the point that if they see that something needs. to be cbang;.ed, they will get up and ·talk about changing it..\ Joseph Mammola, the dean of students,. also helped to get the organization off tfie ground. He said that he was excitOO. to see \students that wanted· to make a difference.\ Moreover, he urged students to \keep the lines of communication open, otherwise when students talk about the issues, there will be no one to hear, and thus it would be· just idle chatter. • Talking does not work if there \Look at that spot...dress him up blJt can't take.him out.\-M. Cuomo Dutch Hollow Restaurant The Way You Like IT! Apathetic is not a listening :party to the conversation.\ Of great concern · to all as.sociated with th·e organization is whether the awareness, ac-tivism, and involvement will contfuue into next year when some· of the prganization's founders will have graduated and many of the issues around which the organization bas revolved might no longerb~ ,present. Dan Wai'ble, a junior who win remain active and involved next year, addressed that question. \The kinds ·of things that we're focusing on for nex:t year are, right now; a little bit more general than what we'v;e done this year.\ \Instead of talking about . .... .. h ' tssues W.uac · · concern: us, we're planning on conducti·ng preliminary- discussions among the core of people. who really care, before we communicate what we should be talting about to th~ general student body. In this way, we feel that by the tim·e the mas·ses are discussing involvement in an issue, we will have been able to narrow .the ·agenda fat ·tlle .discussions to. concenuate on those things which we believe merit discussion at that time,\ One student, who-requested that he remain anonymous, said, \It is time that my voice be 'heard.

The True· lnternatio·nal Student· of the Week Paummi Heeoer Q: Ho,w did yo·u become interested in language study and traveling abroad? Ans: Well, I guess that fate had a lot to do with it all. When I was thirteen my father came home to announce that we would be moving to France for an indefinite amount of time. We ended up living in St. Nomia-Bretche {a smaH town to the West of Paris) for three years .before moving back to Massachusetts. l attended an international lycee for two years. There i followed a French curriculum in all French, but with students of all nationalities. It was very trying at first. I remember being very frustrated and angry_ But I picked up the language fast enough to be in class with French students by my second year. My last year in: France I attended the American school in Paris. l didn't really care what school I went to. but the French school wasn't preparing me for entrance into an Amedcan unive1sity. I switched just before my preparation for the BAC would have begun. So I guess two very intense years of French was ~no ugh to make me fall in love with the language. Three years in France was enough to make me fall in love with the country, the people, the food-.tl\e entire culture-quoi? All of this resulted in my wanting to travel more. When we lived in France, l had lots of opportunities to do an sorts of traveling. I skied in the French and Italian Al]>s as well as in Andora (whic.h I must admit I never even knew existed until I actually went · there). We vacationed in various parts of r~orthern, eastern, western, and southern France as well as .in mahy other countries. I liked the food. The churches did get to be a titmuch. Q: Which Terms Abroad have you participated in? Which was your favorite? Ails: Fall 1988 .. China Spring 1989 ·Germany Fall 1989 -France I lilced China. It was neat. I went with a fantastic group of people which helped. But China is just so amazingly different than any western country. I suppose that that is kind of an obvious statement, but if you go (or hav:e gone) to an eastern country, you'll know what I mean. Also:. that was the term I met the most \natives\ on. I mean we all got to be really close with a lot of them--you know, tears-at-the.., airport-sort of friends. Q: What is the funniest thin~ that 'happened to you abroad? AIJS: J·ust one funny thing? Well most of the stories I could tell you are the kind that you don't get unless you were there.

From France--every moment spent with my family was a blast. I came back at the end of Nov:ember with cramps in my~ cheeks from having smiled for three months straight .. Q: What differences did You notice between life in America ,and life -abroad? . Ans: Well there's less television abroad -- anywhere abroad. The coffee's better. People put a lot of emphasis on family and really kno:w the meaning of a weekend. D:tinking isn't a big deal anywhere rve:been except here. But Americans are more laid back. They have fun no matter what they do or where they do it. And the music is better here. Q,: How do you plan to use · your modern language major in the future?· A.n·S: Next year rn be teaching French at a private high school in New Jersey. I'll probably do that for a couple of years.

Page 8 DISTORDIENSIS, June 5 Qt 6 1 2037 istnrbirnsis Simpson as President? What's Next? R. Re.ed Whidden Not a Male Chauvinist Pig? Bart Simpson as president ofUnionCoUege? At first listen, it sounds like the best thing that could happen to our school since the lJ()okstore computerized its system. The feeling here, though, is that Simpson would not be the ideal choice. Because of his relative youth, it would be logical to assume that Simpson would remain at Union for many years to come. Let's be a little wary on this point. Anyone who has viewed his work on television know& that he has a notoriously short span of attention. He would probably arrive at Union, basic in his position of power, and then bolt to another challenge. Distordiensis has received inside world that Bart has been in high demand from several other schools. Additionally, says sist~r Maggie, there have been rumors of reviving the old Holy Roman Empire, with Bart a!; the top dog. Bart has also been mentioned as a possibility for the next chairmanship of SONY. Simpson is an opportuniist, and as such could not be expected to remain at Union under such circumstances. While many might think that Simp sen would allow free reign for the students to act as they plese, and that he would also allow students to enjoy some of the freedoms that they once had, this might nGt actually be the case. . We are all familiar with Art's affinity for the skateboard. Many students are upset by the circle in front of Carnegie being closed to traffic. Imagine all of the campus roads being blocked in order to bear Bart's board: Fraten1ities might welcome the reckless fourth-grader. But what if Bart relaxe~ all the rules, admits a dozen more houses into campus facilities, and then takes off. Surely ~here would be a backlash that fraternities would find intolerable. If Simpson were president, classes would no longer be held. Construction costs would be high as classrooms would be converted into saloons that could be the butt of his prank phone calls. Is this the kind of image we would want our school to project? On second thought~ Bart's our man! Gamma Phi Who? LETTERS Administration Goes Beyond the Call ,of Duty To the Editors: It has recently come to my at ten ti\on th.at th(} administration of Union College has gone far beyond its call of duty. l have come to the beautiful conclusion that the administration bas stopped at nothing to carry out the will of the student body, and to . incorporate what it feels to be · n~cessary additions to the c-ollege curriculum so as to • better round the student's caricature. In the best interest • of those under its governance, the administration has boldly broken thtough the laws which 'limit its boundaries .. It seems obvious to me that the administration must simply have some sort of an innate sense of what is involved in a fraternal bond. As they have so · graciously given · Delta Upsilon, Delta Chi, and Beta Theta Pi on-campus housing for the upcoming year, I have_ no other W<~,y to explain this wonttrous pehen<lmenon. I know of no other college administrati0ns t!tat holds its students' opinions with such a high regard:,. Are there any limit$ to our freedom of choice at Union? I think not!

The Rangers rise to im moftality began when Seorge Gteinbrenner sold to Tonald Drump in 1983 what had become a beleagured franchise (so Boss Seorge could buy the New York Yankees and beleaguer them). Drump immediately moved the Rangers into a new arena, one which he incredibly built in only three weeks for millions below the projected budget. [The National Hockey League, however, denied Drump's request to change the team's name to 'Tonald~s Drumps', or the 'Drumps' for short.] Union player Martha .Ficlrych waits fC)r the white spot to pass by before swln.glng .. The Rangers' new owner then took personal control of the team's operations. He made cou~tless trades and bought, sotry, brought many past greats out of retirement to play on Broadway in .the new 'Drump Castle'. The older players were physically 'rebuilt' by Drump and his great medical staff and all returned to the form they displayed during Block U Winners Please pick up yo,ur blocks in the Alumni Gym Anytime. their primes. Gordie Howe, Bobby Orr, Bobby Hull, Jacques Plante, Maurice Richard, Rod Gilbert, and Phil Esposito wre all signed and rejuvenated by the new owner and helped tum the Rangers into a spectacle of wonder unmatched on ice, even by Ehc \Ice Capades\. These great players have ali dominated the game for the Ra-ngers, and more incredibly, not one has ntissed a single game in the past seven seasons. What a medical miracle. The Rang~rs rise to the top was also given a boost by Drump's brilliant trades. Somehow; he was able to trade away mediocre players in return for :some of the best players of today. His biggest steal was from the Edmonton Oilers, where the Rangers and their new owner received Wayne Gretzky, Jarri Kurri, Paul Coffey, and Mark Messier for Mikko Leninin and Mark Pavelich. Edmonton gave away their franchise (Gretzky, of course) and three other great players for nothing. Leninin returned to Europe and retired from hockey the day after the trade was made, and Pavelich, ~he 1980 U.S. Olympic Hockey Team member, gave up hockey for fishing and hunting in his native Minnesota. How did Drump do it? He also traded for Mario Lemieux, Ste·ve Yzerman, Marcel Dionne, Larry Robinson, Guy Lafleur, Patr Stasney, and Dale Hawerchuk. He gave up mediocre and washed-up players to get these stars. How he could coax the other teams into making these trades is in believable. One thing is for sure though: Drump knows his hockey. This all-star team for the ages, which is more commonly known as the New York Rangers, has won 60 games a season since Dmmp took control of the reins. They have broken every team record for offense and defense and have sold out every game at home and on the road. The New York Rangers have dominated the National Hockey League. They are America's new team. They are a team for the ~ges. And they are Champ ions for the seventh straight season.
