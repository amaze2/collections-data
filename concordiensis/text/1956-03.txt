We feel that the Student Council should take this advice to heart. The February 28 meeting of the Council l.Jroke all records for length, confusion, and emotion. Those who have served on the Council for fom years will remember this meeting as the longest one they have endured. In the past several sessions, action has been impeded in the Council lJecause matteJ.'S have not been clearly thought out in advance. For example: A vital issue being considered by the Council tool< nine separate steps to eventually land in the hands of a commit- tee. One thing was done, however, to help eliminate con- fusion at future meetings. Stephen Holbrook, Council chair- man, relinquished the chair to move that all motions be sub- mitted in writing. So1icl 'backing of this was a most con- struetive result.

An Ounce of Prevention :\lust a tragedy always be necessary to stimulate inter- est in vital issues? Two years ago the Student Council at- tempted to make Greek Week less severe and barbaric, The try was squelched because of student ·apathy. ~ow the Student Council is again working to di.vorce this college from the stigma resulting from tacit appmval of practices which may prove fatal to some member of the stl!- dent l.Jody. Ce1 Lain members of that organization have gone out on a limb which mar break if the convictions of the rest of the students don't stir them to aetion. A committee of five students has recently been aiJ- pointed to study the problems relating to Greek Week:. Thi8 com~nittee represents five factions in the student body, in- cludmg one that is adamantly opposed to revision of the system. We urge everyone, from the college administmtion to the individual student, to take a stand on the issue. It's not enough to consider ourselves theoretically mature. We must be practical and weigh each factor involved in the case. Certainly we never want to see Union Colleo·e faced with a tragedy similar to the one which occurred at MIT. C. G. C.

Focus on Pledge Trips The recent tragedy at :\llT has focused the national spotlight on hell week in general, and on pledge tlips in parti<:ular. L·nion, too, ha:s felt the searching- glare of this probing beam, and it has taken advantage of the added illum- ination to look into the entire question of initiation weeks. In this space we will focus the beam a bit more sharply, by 1·estriding ourself to a di:scu:sswn of pledge trips. \Ve will try to filter out some of the g·Jm·e of emotionalism, and ex- amine the question more logical!~·, perhaps, than it has been to date. Immediate reaction to the death of the Delta Kappa E.psilon pledge called for elimination of all pledge ttips. This, in itself, is a l'idiculous point of view. Are railroads banned, or airplanes g-rounded because people die or are injured in a ctash or a wreck'? Such a move would be considered fool-- hardy. \Yhy '! Because the loss of life or the injury incurred is mino1· compared to the worthwhile services these media of tl'ansp01·tation perform. The death rate pe1· passenger mile is extremely low. Before banning all pledge trips, then, because they have caused the death of one person, we should ask, \Do pledge trips perfm111 an~· worth while se1·viee '? Are they of any value?\ At this point, our argument becomes dangerously sub- jective. The function of the pledge trip varies from college to college, from ·f, aternity to fraternity, and from chapter to chapter. It is a fundamental part of the initiaion cere- mony of some fratemitics, and in other cases, its function can be discussed only in guarded terms. !on general, though, the pledge may visit new places, meet different people, and perhaps gain some courage, initia- tive, and self coni iden<:e. Certainly fraternities, like rail- roads and airlines, should do everything in their power to minimize danger on trips and to maximize possible benefits. For'the most part. this must be accomplished on an individ- ual ua:sis. No one can doubt that the pri- II1ary guiding prindple of Union Collep;e ·is the education of young rr•en through the maintenance of £1 hig-h standard of academic per~ formance: The administration has directed all its efforts to this goal, with a de-emphasis in athletiC's he- ing an integral part of this general policy. In general, I think that such a policy, if con~i~tent and a!- \ ays hPld foremost. is a praisew-or- thy and valuable ideal. However. in pt:oducing Ute w'ell-rounded Un- ion man. the collPge does not neg- l<':t thE' physica-l development of its studPnts. A substantial p.hy~<i­ cal education program satisfies this need to a certain extent. Be- vond this, students desiring a more complete physical education show their interest by joining var·sity athletic. tpams. ·Spirit of <JompPtition In keeping- \With the ~:rerican spirit of competition, Union has joined other universities in inter- collegiate athletics, and to my kno•wledge has never regretted the decision. The last ten years or so, how•ever, have !brought many head- aches to colleges· of Union's calib-er in the form o-f derrands O!\ subt-le hints from certain alumni to em- J;hasize athletics. Their cries of \buy athletes\ and \produce win- ning teams\ hm·e no doubt caused these colleges to va•c-illate in their ideals in order to keep the almrmi contented, and therefore more compliant. In a;li serio·usness, the practicality of the matter has su- pprceded to an extent the esta'b- lishE>d principle. In my mind, the latest practical action taken by the collPge has placed those who voice Union'·s ideals upon a narrow, rickety fence .from which falling without control or jurr ping with dPliberation is ine11itarble. Union is approaching the point where a definite commitment of action re- gai·ding the athletic situation is to be taken. Whether to err·phasize, \Yithout hypocracy, or de-emphasize 111 ith firmness the production of winnin!': athletic teams. is the cjues- tion. Union's J•osition ThE' position that t:nion now lwlds is oftl'n vag-ue and confusing; throu-gh personal interests, as a student, varsity competitor, and futurp alumnus, I donl.t take the question lightly. What should th<' answ.ers t•e to the queriPs of bright- PVE'd sub-frosh who seek informa- tion confusedly sown in the minds of L'nion's sons?

Plattner, 'vhose letter ap- pears elsewhere on this pag-e, for our error of omission of last week in leaving out the bylme on \The Tweed at Union.\ As long- as we are apologizing, though, we will excuse our- selves even more to Assistant .Features Editor Ira Halperin, the author, for he cei·tainly deserved recognition for his well written article. Few of those who know the so-called \hidden author\ 'muld call him a misogynist or, indeed, any of the other ad- jectives attri·buted to him by the1etter. On the other hand, we would call him an extremely talented writer. We felt that the author's tongue almost punctured the wall of his cheek in writing- the a1·ticle, and if the lack of a byline caused l\lr. Plattner to take the article seriously and jump on his high horse, sword in hand, we apologize again. The windmills he has attacked, however, are non-existent. E. S. L. in the right direction. It Isn't necessary for Union to even think of 'buying athletes when the possi- bility of producing them from the student 'b·ody potential exists. A well-equipped gym and higher ai'n~s in athletic pursits might seM(e a two-fold p-urpose: to attract the ideal sub-frosh., whose mental and athletic aJbilities are far above average; and to further and en- hance the concept of a \well- rounded\ Union graduate.

Aside from these losses, the sopho•more-studded squad sltould be in ~ood shape for next year, Next year's squad will be a high- scoring, good-rebounding one w'hich shffilld overcome the shortcomings of t'his year's teani., stated depart• ing -coach Dick CiccO>lella. He pointed out that the lack of e:x- perience whic'h was evide1:1t in early season games should not appear next year, while the outside shoot- ing problE1m will in all probability, be solved by •!L grou:p of sharp- shootiDtg f.reshmen, notably Frank Crum, AI Dunker, and Bill Mather. Delta Upsilon Leads In Close Intramural Pack Race The struggle for the starting terum in 1956-57 appears to be shap- ing up as a battle roya,.l. Norm Bau:m should win the center berth, but 6'10\ Ian Walker, beClause of his heig'ht, will be a strO'Ilg con- tender. 01:1e fo.rward position should be filled by Drew La-wson on the basis of hiis great record; this yea.r, but the o-t:her forecourt :post will be open for ·grabs. Leadin:g contenders are soPI:lonrore Bill ·Cole, an-d fresh- men A! Dunker an·d Frank ·crurn. The bi,ggest stru~le will come over the starting !Jackcourt •berths. Dan Benman will no doubt be one guard, but viein.g for the second spot w-ill be Ed •Cona~'> ay, Joel Bux- baum, and Bill Mather, who is up from the freshman .squad. At this time, it ap.pears as .thoug\n the ~ost likely line-u:p will have Norm Baum at center, Dreow Law· son and AI Dunker as forward, and Dan Berman and Bill Mather in the gua.rd posiltions. Taking every- thing into consideration, t'he out- look for the future, under new coach. Tom Cartmill, looks good.

He won the Down Beat popularity and critic poll and the Metronome all-star poll. proving that his appeal is widespread.

These past three years have seen an increasing conflict of interest between the l.'nion College Public Relations Of- fice and the Concordiensis in regard to release dates on im- portant stories. \\'e believe that these articles, few in num- ber can be sent to local and national journals for publication on 'Fridav afternoon Ol' Saturdav morning, thus allowing simultan~ous distribution on campus. Stories of lesser news value must of necessity be marked for release early in the week to take advantage of slack periods. The Concordiensis has never objected to such policy. In the main, this has been handled to the mutual sa tis faction of both parties, but there have LePn notable exceptions of late, as in the cases of the announcements of Bruce Catton and Thomas Cartmill as commencement speaker and basket bal'l coach respectively, \·herein no effort towat·d cooperation with the newspaper was made.

The Conco.rdy, these past few weeks, through its editorials and its Letters to the Editor, has done an excellent job of pre- sl'nting the pros and ccms of pledge trips. H1>wever. I beiit>ve there is an Important distinction which has hPen overlooked, anc:l ought to be brought to the attention of your readers. The MIT student, who lost his lifp while participating in a tra- ditional pledge activity, had. been talten on a pledge ride. This, I submit. is something entirely apart from the pledge trip which has been the focus of our college news- papPr. The \ride\, when a pledge is taken by thE' brothers and re- leased in the wilds of the coun- try, is inviting trouhle. Leaving a plPdge hebind, usllally at night and in a precarious environment, is something whiCh should be, and is now being, frowned upon by fraternities the cou:r1try over. On the other hand, I see no reason why the pledge trip, also a national fraternal custom. should be abolished. On such a trip, the pledge is go;ing through an im- portant lPai'Jning: process, during which he CO!bes into contact with all types of l:leop-le under new and exciting eirr:urn:stances; he fre- quently performs important mis- sions or err!).nds for his national that tend tiel- bind the chapters more close!)•· together; and, he learns something about the fra- ternity for 1\'hicih he is traveling. In short, on a pledge trip, at least thrPe things rna.ke the student a hPttPr hrothPr: contact with other people, other cotJ.ditions, arid other chaptE>rs.

I~ F~IDA.Y MARCH 16. 1956 Brubeck in Review ·By Richard Balsam and Steffan Stein A receptive cr9wd inspired the Dave Brubeck Qu;;trtet to produce some of the finest contemporro·y jazz sounds of its career In Me- morial Chapel, last Saturday. Brubeck, one of the foremost representatives of jazz, \west coast\ style, was at his. finest in ,performances of recorded stand- ards as well as in renditions of newer materials. The quartet ~aptured the a;udi- ·ence almost immediately as they opened with G'lne With the Win4 1 a number characterized by the smooth SaX improvisions of Paul Desmond and a ·classicaJ solo by Brubeck. The Saints Come M:arclt- ing In was a complete switch from the usual Brubeclt fare. Desmond was extremely lyrical in his open- ing solo, while Brubeck punched out octaves and tenths, and moved into heavy block chords, creating an effective .contrast in moods. The two played a short but tasteful· duet finishing with an almost dix- ieland-type coda.· The old standard, Sta:t•dust, sounded .perhaps even better than the quartees recording. Desmond seemed to reach \cloud· seven\ in his solo while Brubeck fed him light, ·stylish chords. The pianist's solo was extremely rnapsodic al- most suggesting themes of Chopin and Debussy. Norm Bates, on string bass, showed his v-ersatility in a fine solo which drew the audi- ence into an enraptured silence.

Mov- ing frorn heavy fugue .patterns to gigantic chords, he reached his peak in this solo. The true \jazz\ feeling was retained throug-hout this number as well as the whole concert because of the vastly improved drumming of Joe Dodge, especially reflected in his cymbal solos. Desmond demon- strated his wizardry in this num- ber by playing duets -with him· self and improvising solely ar!;}und the key of A-flat, a feat for which he is w-ell known. The concert was climaxed by a most unusual arrangement of Lover, in which Dodge played in four-four time, Bates ·in three-four time, and Brubeck and Desmond in :various ·rhythmic patterns. The sax player, satirizing the \Rock and Roll\. saxophone sound, amus- ingly honked out an old-fashioned blues chorus. Dominant block chording again colored Brubeck's solo while Bates kept the waltz time in the listeners' ear through- out the number. Brubeck's un- usual ending left the audience gasping. Throughout the concert the lis- tener could not help but be aware · of Brubeck's fine musical back- ground.

The section outlawing paddling and all acts \'lihich tend to degrade the indi- vidual w~&s approved by a large rr.·ajority.

Narrow Path to Success The coming elettions for Student Council representative and class officers are of vital concern, for they may prove to be a turning point as fae as the Council is concerned. A campaign that proves to be of general interest to the student body should, in theory at least, result in the more capable candidates l>eing elected. If it. works, this nevv election scheme should result in better student government over a period of seve1·al yea1 s. As we see it, the major aims of the Council Elections Committee -in revising election p1·oceuures were to create more interest in elections, boost the voting percentage, and eliminate candidates who are out to win just fo.r the sake of winning. Chapel meetings have been chosen as the medium th1·ough \vhich student inte1·est will be aroused. Either lack of platform issues. or an overplay of them, could spoil these meetings easil.Y, as could Jack of attendance. Certainly every effort is being- made to boost the voting percentage. :\laking the rounds to all the fraternity houses with ballots in hand is just al.Jout feeding most students their vote on a silver spoon. This has proved successful in the past, but the question of whethe1· or not all this effort should Le expended to gamer votes is not easil.Y ans\~ereu, and has been the subject of some discussion in this column in the past. We are somewhat dubious about the primary election system, which represents the committee's attempt to elim- inate the possibility of a winning candidate being backed by less than 20 percent of a dass, as has often occuned in the past. This is currently the weak !i11k in the chain the com- mittee is trying to forge. The vuter, balloting- in the primaries, has no criteria by which to judge which candidate to eliminate. Ile ma\· !use interest bentuse he is being forced to vote for the s~InJe ·office twice. Perhaps some sort of screening committee to l'eplace primaries would be a solution. Lynn Hinman and his committee ha\·e done a g\(Jod jolJ in their revi:;iom; as rar as they have gone. \\'e hope that our apprehensions are not realized and that elections are \better than ever\ but there are currently too many places whe1·e something could go wrung- and ruin the entire scheme.

If no more, the show '\ u demon$tration of this develop- ment. Me Kay has .ch0sen to hang a I.Jig blue thing called Times Square: One really must see it to appre- ciate the 1\torks of merit nearby. We've mentioned the enterprise several times and do so again only of necessity; should the artist be judged by it alone he might rightly be accused of definitely dilettantist tendencies. On either side of the thing are humorous .representations of cam- pu.s scenes. Washburn Hall is in- lPrestingly interpreted in a com- posite vie·oi\·'. It should be worth a s>r ilc and it's a very workmanlike \~atercolor. Its mate, also includ- ing the retr oarkable old red build- ing, takes in the geology structure, the Jibr:u·y and Memorial Chapel. It is more imaginative than these and a deft job. McKay placed tV~:oo trifles as far aw•ay from the viewers as he could, on the ·back wall of the ticket office>. It's probably far enough. On the other wall are, we feel, .:\!cKay's two best so fax·. 'One he calls Moth,•.I'hood. That's a pretty am·bitious title for any v.atercolor, and this one 'hardly defines the word. ,But no one expects paint- in~~ to define rvrords. The effect is a good one though. It seerns to be the further development of the large '\\ ork on brown paper which VIe discussed when it :v,··as a part of an exhibition of .the work of the students of Charles Annan.

But the painting remains a good onp.

But as ·great as is, for example, the New York ala- baster escat'.pll'oent, it is isolated and made insignificant by the im- mense forces around it; the power is there. _ If McKay's reputation is ever to grow, Times Square must go. It should be owdthheld from even such casual exhibits as the one in Moun- tebanks' Theater. To prove he is a regular guy, or. that he has a .commercial talent, or some such thing, McKay hung a picturesque greeting card sort of thing called, of course, Vermont -·in the corner.

Mr. Brey explained that the unit is not built to scale but that the section that denotes the actual atC>mic pile is almost the same size as a real pile. It is officially term- ed \a homogeneous swimming pool type reactor\. \Swimming pool\ refers to the way the pile operates. The owner of the machine, the Leeds Northrup Co. of Philadel- phia, hopes to interest colleges of Union's size in the machine. According to the company's ad- vertising representative, students at colleges now can have actual experience in opet·ating an atomic pile at a cost that rnaltes it within reach of almost any school. Pile Progrpss Recorded Mr. Brey then interrupted the salesman and explained that all the electronic controls and graphs on the face of the machine accurately record the progress of the theo- rPticai pile. Mr. Brey continued explaining that the nerve center of the machine is an analog com- puter designed to :.olve continually the differential equations that rep- resent the kinetic operation of a nuclear reactor.
