New Association Is In Vogue at West Point and Annapolis Membership of New Athletic Club Grows by Leaps and Bounds-First Home Football Game Showed Results A new scheme has recently been de- veloped whereby any member of Union college, or any alumnus may become a permanent member of the athletic assoctatwn. This idea· proposes the sale of permanent admission to all home games for $15 per person. · The alumni, for whom this scheme reaps the greatest advantage, for the purpose of organization, are divided into two groups; namely, the active members, who reside within a 30- mile radius of the college, and the· associate members who live more than the above distance from this city. The active chapter will hold regular meetings throughout the year, and hopes to enjoy a banquet sometime in ] anuary of each year. A secretary and treasurer, both temporary positions, for the organization have been appointed in the persons 0f Charles N. Waldron and Profe~sor Howard Opdyke, until the organization elects its officers for the year.

Y. Which Type of Research is of Greatest Value? A stove bums too much coal. A man familiar with the princi- ples of combustion and heat radiation makes experiments which indicate desirable changes in design. That is research. You want to make a ruby in a factory, a real ruby, indistin- guishable by any test from the natural stone. You begin by analyzing rubies chemically and physically .. Then you make rubies just as nature did. Your rubies are the result of research -another type of research. While melting up your chemicals and experimenting with high temperatures, you begin to wonder how hot the earth must have been millions of years ago, and what were the forces at play that made this planet what it is. Your investigation leads you far from rubies and causes you to formulate theories to explain how the earth, how the whole solar system was created. That would be research of ·a still different type. Research of all three types is conducted in the laboratories of the General Electric Company. But it is the third type-pio- neering into the unknown-that means most in the long run, even though undertaken with no practical benefit in view. For example, the Research Laboratories of the General Elec- tric Company are exploring matter with X-rays in order t.o dis- cover not only how the atoms in different substances are arranged but how the atoms themselves are built up. The more you know about a substance, the more you can do with it. This work may enable scientists to answer more definitely the question: Why is iron magnetic? Then the electrical industry will take a greater step forwar~ than can be m?-de in a century of experimenting with existing electrical apparatus. You can add wings and stories to an old house. ·But to build a new house, you must begin with the foundation.

I. men did here for the opening football game this season. Everything went weU . until some time after the close of the game, when the R. P. I. students found a large banner had been taken from a waH of t'he building. Union Men Blamed Since the Union students had been present, and they had cheered R. P. I.'s opponents, the blame for the dis- appearance of the banner was placed on Union college proper. As a matter of fact, Union college students later , discovered the banner in a fraternity house of an Albany college. and re- . turned it to the Troy institution. · But prior to the return of the banner · R. P. I. and Union has staged a foot- ball game on Alexander field, and feel- ing was aroused between the two stu- dent bodies there. Some excitement resulted, including the alleged taking of ' several frosh caps. It was found dur- , ing the night following the game that • a small piece had been chipped from the idol near the gym, and the initials \R. P. I.\ had been cut in the stone. A heated discussion followedo in the · n.ext student meeting, which finally ended up with the unanimous vote of the student body that relations be brok- . en with the college alleged to have thus mutilated the stone god. Such a reso- lution was transmitted to Troy, and the schools have remained at a dis- : tance since, a pefiod of about three years. Extends Far Back Back files of The Concord1ensis, and college traditions say that the R. P. !.- Union games were the most lucrative of an entire season, drawing a large number of residents of both home cities, as well as hundred from this district. But trouble between the col- leges is nothing new-it started years ago, long before most of the faculty here now can remember. In the early part of this century, relations were broken for a three or four year period, and resumed again. Again at the end of the first decade, the anger of the two schools was aroused for a second time. The break this time lasted for several years. The most mention made in old files of college publications regards the rela- tions between Union and Hamilton, which in those days were similar to those now existing between R. P. I. and Union.

Gormley with R. P. I., mentioning the idol af- fair, the disappearance of the R. P. I. banner, and the attitude of the two rival institutions on the day of our last foot- hal game. The affirmative side ad- vanced the argument that R. P. I. has been undergoing a decided change for the better, casting aside the ideas of a technical school, and adopting the ideals of a really collegiate institution. The statement was made that the im- proved conditions of things at R. P. I. is shown by the fact it has adopted a ruling similar to Union's one-year athletic rule. Cooley, representing the negative side, gave instances of the decidedly unconciliatory attitude of the Troy stu- dents. He mentioned that many of Union's supporters, opposed to a re- sumption of relations, would cease to be supporters of Union. Financial Benefits PuBois, of the affirmative, showed the financial benefit to be derived from athletic games with R. P. I. He suggested that it would be a great ad- vantage to have one big home game every year, instead of only every other year, as we do now with Hamilton. DuBois presented the idea that games between two such close rivals would kep up a keener interest among the public at large, and particularly among the alumni. The receipts from such games, estimated at $3,000 a year, wottld go a great way toward keep- ing the athletic board out of debt.

In other words, ol!r good enginering schools shollld be elevated to the graduate level: the weak ones should he reduced to the trade school class. From the standpoint of the arts 1 course, the pres-ence of the sort of en- • gineers who are unwilling to take the 1 regctlar. training of professional men ; has a bad effect. Their emphasis upon · things material, their glorification of • the practical, and their constant appli- cation of quan·titative standards are not . good influences in a college whose ; main purpose should be the promotion 1 of the intellectual life, and whose chief regard should be for the things that refine life and lift it above the material : level. But the presence of mature graduate students of engineering would . he a benefit to the whole institution. I am well aware that the majority of ' eRgineering students are to be com- . mended for their superior industry, · that maHy of them are more cultivated than their academic fellows, and that the practice of engineering can be ort the highest idealistic plane. But it must be h.eld in mind that my paper ' on \Democracy and Education\ w;:ts . of a theoretical character and that I • .v\·as guided by general tendencies. Its ,·content was not inspired by local con- I ;ditions, and the point concerning the ' separation of the .engineering school 'from the college was only one of many raised: this point did not have in my · paper the prominence which the head- line above mentioned would indicate. I :should add that I sought no publicity. My paper vvas read before a small , group of faculty and students,. and the whole occasion was of a most informal and unofficial character.

Issue Editor, Harry N. Pitt. Jr. '24 Friday, October 20, 1922 SENSATIONALISM It has heen complained of the modern newspaper that it nour- ishes and engenders sensationalism. It is true that journalistic prac- tice today tends to exploit the unusual and to misrepresent the em. phasis in snch a manner as oftentimes to misinform. It has reached that point where stories that appeal to the quicker emotions have any news value. It is objected that a newspaper will carry anything with flash sufficient to attract. Smile and use courtesy to all, equals and subordinates as vvell as superiors. This means greetings, tone of voice in talking, considera- tion for the personal comfort of all who enter your office, whether visitors or employees. Don't adversely criticize any one in the presence of others. Don't use ungentlemanly language. Respect the authority of others. ancl the personal dignity of sub ordinates. Don't cnt1c1ze destructively. Criticize constructively hy sug gesting how the error in question may be avoided in the future. Don't encourage gossip about fellow workers. Don't countenance animosities or intrigues. Give every one credit for his good suggestions. Be liberal in praising good performances as you are in censuring ln a local newspaper a story appeared with a headline to the bad performances. effect that Governor Miller was opposed to all labor leaders.

Don't show partiality or favoritism or injustice in any direction. :\gain, a headline may be a patent untruth because a statement is not sufficiently qualified. Or perhaps a Yery minor point may he stressed as y.ital to the exclusion of the real substance ancl the mis information of the reader. direct lying. Pen·ersinn of this sort is as culpable as Don't let personal feelings govern your actions against your bet ter business ju<1gment. Promote on merit only, and give preference to your own em ployees over outsiders, other things being equal. Don't belittle any one, not e,·en the humblest \vorker in your organization. Trailed by a host of motion picture and still cameramen, newspapermen, and high department heads of the com- pany, Mr. Ediso-n a11d Gerard Swope, president of the General Electric visited laboratory after laboratory, where they viewed processes, many of which were being shown to the public gaze for the first time.

How about the Football Player Tackling a Dummy? Isn ~t he typical of everything you do in these four years? You are the Football Player. The dummy is every knotty problem you hckle, every effort to earn your way through, every examinatian, every campus activity. Tackle the dummy hard, and you'll be ready for even higget• tests in the game of business or professional };ife. Do not say about this symbol, ''How clever'', and let it go at that. It is worth nothing unless it reminds you to get the spirit of the Tackler into your work. By his earnestness he seems to feel the thrill of combat.

The I audtence roared. Then came a patr of scissors from his vest pocket, and with these two articles of commerce, the speaker was enabled to contini1e.

Westford Cutler, '24 Friday, October 27, 1922 HAZING ( Fwm .:\Ii!lcllehury Campus)/ 1 • It i~ eYident that the position of hazing in :\Iidcllebury College is greatly misunderstoucl, and the attitude of the Sophomore Class in/ hazing the memhers of the Freshman Cbss is not only misunder-1 stood, hut i;; in nwst c<1sc;; gTtJssly exaggerated.

They are intended for! the consumption of the facultY and of the ttnYns people <tncl not for 1 - I the ears of the sophcmwres. There is not an entering class that at 1 some period or other cloes not complain of the strict rules, yet when i they aspire to the tilte of 'sophomore\ these complaints are totally: forgotten. \ \\hy: ::--;ot because there is a desire to g·ain revenge, but j simply because, (Jll becoming sophomores, they realize that is is gootl: for them. I .:\lemhns of the facl!lty \vlio were stuclcnts at the College during j th epcriod when hazing Y\·as in vogue, are divided in their opinion as i to the benefits to he clerivecl from the present practice. It may be/ said, howcHr, that sn·eral favor that it places the freshmen where; they belong, and that the threat of paddling impresses freshmen with! the need of keeping the rules. It may be argued that the rules should I not be applied to the freshmen, if it is necessary to use force in en- i forcing- them. That may he true, hut if the rules are abolished, the 1 present C(Jtltrul over hazing that has been established by the Student Councillikewi·sc passes out of existence. \Yhat '\\'nttld he the effect of such action? It •vas tri-ed at Colum-J bia CniH·rsity. It was tried at Rutgers College. It was tried at both i \\\est Point and .\nnapolis. The results in each instance were the! same. :\ t Columbia a class fight was started between the freshmen, and the sophomores in a subway, resulting in the injury of sever;1.l · students, .-\t Rutgers another class fight was started resulting in the des.tructioti of property and the injury of <~. member of the partic- ipants. At \Vest Point and Annapolis private hazing parties have heen held resulting in the injury of several of the lower classmen. Is· this what :\1iddlelmry wants?
