Fos- ter Brown '16, Assistant Secre- tary. Brunet, a member of the class of 1916, was born in Petersburg, Virginia and now resides in Mend- ham, New Jersew. At Union, he received an engineering degree, win the Bailey Cup, and was elected to Sigma Xi, the science national honor society. A mem- ber of Sigma Phi, he served as an officer in France in World War I and has been on the Board of Applications Drop In .Engineering Trustees since 1952, serving as vice chairman since 1957.

Referring to geographical distribution, he said that \the stu- dents come ;fi-nm a fair spread of the country.\ Carter Davidson Reports Eight F acuity Promotions 1116 applications were received by the college so far this year as compared with 1165 last year and more are expected before the March 1 deadline. More students are now taking an interest in Un- ion than in the past. This can be seen from the number of students who have sent their college board scores to the school. During 1956- 57, the school receh·ed oni.y 1475 scores while in 1960-61, 3298 scores were received. Baker, retired as Viee President of the Guarantee Trust Company, has been a vice nresident of th\' American. Academy in RGm.e sinri' 19'49 and its treasurer :since 1959. He also serves as Vice President (Continued on Page ll) Donations Received The main concern of the Admis- sions Department with the suh- lrosh is in the number applying for engineering.

A Time For Action The educational condition of Union College lies pri- marily in the hands .of the faculty, since all matters of curriculum, calendar, and honors work, fall within their jurisdiction. This is a sacred trust, which must be executed wisely, and judiciously, and always with the interests of the College as a whole in mind. The Davidson Calendar, introduced to the faculty last December potentially has the power to generate an excit- ing change in what many people feel is a stagnant curric- ulum. It is not a panacea for all of the College's ills, but offers greater flexibility in the construction of courses and curricula than is presently available. Professor Baker and his committee are to be congrat- ulated on the careful research they have done on the prob- lem, and on their willingness to explain, in careful, and we think convincing detail, the need, and advisability, of adopting the calendar. The Calendar proposal has been referred to, and voted upon by the four divisions, and now awaits final action by the Faculty Council. The four divisions however, are not in agreement as to its desirability. Although Divisions 1 and 3 have voted for its immediate institution, 4 has reg- istered a desire to defer its adoption until 1964, to enable the complete remodeling of the present course structure. A few months they feel, is insufficient time in which to accomplish this end. Their objection we feel, is a valid one. There is no sense in having a revised calendar if the course work will remain unchanged. It is imperative that the new calendar actually be fundamental to the structure of the courses themselves, rather than the courses being hurriedly forced to fit the new semester scheme. The advantages that will be available to upperclassmen and honors students are ob- vious, the real work must be done in the more formalized Freshman curriculum, with some real purpose for the six week semester for freshmen being found. We therefore support the stand of Division 4, that the Calendar proposal be adopted immediately, while its insti- tution be 'delayed until the fall of 1964. Division 2, in marked contrast to the other three divi- sions, wants to wait at least until 1964 before even decid- ing upon a new calendar, a stand which we feel is overly cautious and impractical. Though their desire to investi- gate several variations of the calendar before settling upon any one definite plan seems reasonable enough, it raises the problem of indefinite delays, since the highly varied curricula· of the four divisions will never be optimally ac- commodated by any one plan. The Davidson Calendar is presently available, three of the divisions have found they can readily adopt to it, and is already acting like a catalyst upon which a whole new curriculum can grow. It is time for action, not d.iscussi0jl1, and although the intentions of Division 2 are sincere, their vote again the Cak\'. proposal is a vote for indefinite stagnati~l. We can only hope therefore, that their opposi- tion will be overruled. Forgotten Obligation The Student Body is privileged in having two organs of expression: the Student Council and the All College Council. Implicit in this privilege however, is a responsi- bility to reflect, discuss, and react to perti.11e11t campus problems. The Student Body is not fulfilling this obligation. The Davidson Calendar, the most important campus controversy in recent years, has gone by virtually un- noticed by the ge)leral Student Body. It has been printed twice (in its entirety) in Concordy, with twice as many explanations and opinions. Y$3t there have been no Letters to the Editor, or any expressidn of general student senti- ment concerning its implications or desirability. The Stu- dent Council's recent motion supporting the calendar was both late in coming and the work of those few students who by virtue of their interest in campus affairs serve on the Council. There was no general request for such action from the Student Body at large, which in the past has only demonstrated its concerto. with suspending classes the Sat- urad of the Hamilton Game, or extending Winter vacation by an extra day. In view of the . .Student Body's narrow and frivolous in- terest in campus affairs, the Editorial Board of the Con- cordiensis seriously questions the right of the Student Body to maintain a Student Council, a privilege it has rarely justified. Hugh ·Gaitskell- Stalwart of Democracy The following article was writ- ten by Professor Joseph Finkel· stein, of the histm·y departrnent, recently promoted by the Board of Trustees to full p1·ofessorship (Page 1). Having specialized in modern E11glish history, and hav- ing studied and traveled exten- sively in England, Professor Fink- elstein thus has a deep insight and personal involvement with the country~its people and its .poli- tics. This artiCle, dealing with the recently deceased Bl'itish Labour Party leader Hugh Gaitskell, pro• vides ample evidence of the above s'atement.

With virtually the same crew that snapp~d a three year losmg draught last season, Witzel has molded his charges into an even more homogenious hand that threatens to steal the thunder from more than one foe rated ahead of the Garnet in the 1.mwritten eastern small college rankings. With the slate just about half completed, the Dutchmen have l lrea~y pulled off one of the rnajor upsets in eastern circles by knockmg off a tough University of Vermont five .graced with the ?istinction of \major\ classification by virtue of their participation m the rugged Yankee Conference. Led foi· the third consecutive fear by .the brilliant Dav_e Santos, the Garnet bucketmen have kept their poise on most occasions to defeat six of ten opponents to date. Along the. way, Santos has garnered the distinct honor of being named to the ECAC weekly team twice, while tall Toby Lustig has been selected' once. Both men have already beeli nominatd for the all-star five on other occasions, and are sure to duplicate these laurels before the se;1son comes to a close . Contributjng heaVily up front a·long with Lustig and Santos, \las been semor Lew J~nes, a f'opva;d who has rapid:y developed mto one of ~he squad s most consistent performers. Handling ba_ckcourt duties have been \old· reliable\ Ed Tyndall, and soph M1ke Sahr. Both have added luster to the overall defensive arid ball-handling capabilities of the Witzelmen. Also not to he over- looked are big Mike Holowaty . at center, and sophomore G·ary Brown at gua1·d. Holowaty, erratic to be sure, has helped the Garnet caus.e considerably in the late going with timely rebounding and scormg. Brown has frequently been dealt a hot hand coming off the bench, and has hit double figures three or four times in quick spurts. The main credit, of course,. must be reserved for Witzel, a man who has suffered through frustration after frustration in his tenure a:t Union, b~t who has bounced back hard from each setback. The hkeable. Umon mentor has finally obtained a group of men with the ~es1re to play basketball, and has greatly capitalized on his hustlmg resources, as the record attests.

HENRY KISSINGER Kissinger Asks Shift In Policy By Richard Sifton The Faculty Council voted last Wednesday to endorse the \Da- vidson Tri-Semester Calendar\ and the proposal to remove at- tendance regulations frol'n the Ad- ministration's hands. Turned down was the proposed five day week After the Calendar measure . was passed, it was decided: that a committee be appointed ad hoc by President Davidson to coordin- ate the installation of the tri- semester plan at Union College. Contrary to earlier estimates the program will probably not be im- plemented until the fall of 1964. This coordinating committee was welcomed by many members of the faculty since it represents ad- ditional time to Work out the fine points to the plan. The Davidson Calendar will have three semesters of . twelve, six, and twelve weeks respect- fully. During the twelve week periods each student will take four courses instead of the usual five. A full two semester's work will be taken in one subject during the six week period. Finals for the first semester will be over before Christmas and Spring vacation will be lengthened by one week. Graduation will always fall in the beginning of June, no later than the ninth, and the field compre- hensi\•e exams will never be given during vacation. As Professor Baker's report emphasized, the other advantages of this program will stem from psychological fac- tors. This is a change of pace, an inducement to professors to install in this dynamic program a dynamic and new app:roach to their coll.rt?e work. Most..feel that, if nothing else, it is something new to be experimented with and tried. The student, the report stated, would have three extra hours saved from class time and many more hours from the time that he does not have to spend on homework. Some feel that with thi:;; time he can do better in the four subjects and still keep up with the accelerated pace of the twelve week semester. Oth- ers, however, feel that the stud- ents will simply waste this time and, if not loaded with work, he will not do any work at all. (Continued on Page 6) Resolution Bans Cigarette Ads

I have heard that it· may be due to the fact that they are \below our academic standards.\ If true, this is a disgustingly conceited at- titude. RPI, which must be con- sidered our scholastic equal, plays both these schools without dam- aging its \imag-e.\ At any rate, what about Susquehanna?

Nothin 'But The Facts In the past I had been disturbed about the. implicati<:ms of the \shelter\ signs. long omnipresent in New York City, and elsewhere, I presume. The implied readi- ness for a disaster which would ddicule those very signs,with their paint chatTed and unreadable, seemed folly. Worse yet was the implication that we were prepar- ing for war and not peace. Still, those signs stood also as a friend- ly invitation out of the rain or a cold winter's wind.

Relationships with Siena and State would be popular, just as those two colleges have built up an exciting rivalry between them- selves, and we with RPI. In ad- dition, we could avoid the long Christmas vacation lay-off by en- tering the Siena Invitational Tour- nament. I know for a fact our presence is desired and would be welcome. RPI and State already participate, and the inclusion of Union would make it truly a local affair. Currently an outsider (this year St. Lawrence, last year Al- f1:edl rounds out the quartet.

Where this first action of the Council was a progressive one, their section action, abolishing uniform attendance regulations, was a liberalizing one. It places student at- tendance on the more mature level practiced by the Euro- pean universities, where lecture attendance is entirely up to the individual student. This view not only elevates the questions come to mind: • Apparently the college ex;pects ~,.-.;iiiiiiiilliiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiliiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii:iliiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii-iiiiiiiiliilli~i:iiiiiiiiiiiiiii~i1 1) Can we take seriously the;:. to caress fraternities. for some suggestion to spend the weeb;::. time.

An editorial appearing in the Concordiensis last week This presupposes however, added responsibility for accused the student body of complete indifference to cam- both the student and the professor.

Since it would be too much to for civil rights in the South. Through contact with the· suggest that the apathetic student body disband the Cow- \Freedam Singers,\ botb at their concert Tuesday night cil, we recommend that the Student Council, composed of and at their frequent \appearalllces in various classes, we the only students capable of action, disband itself. sheltered Northerners have been able to vicariouSly feel the danger and injustice they have faced in their attempt to secure their Constitutional Rights. Those present at the concert Tuesday night sym-· pathized with the story Cordell Reagon narrated between songs. The enthusiastic applause and the sizable sum of money that was collected was due to sympathy with the goals of the \Freedom Singers\ as well as appreciation of their singing. While this recent display of social consciousness on the part of Union students is praiseworthy, we wonder whether the newly found sense of justice will linger very long. It is quite easy to sit in Memorial Chapel and sympathize with the victims of injustice a thousand miles away. The finan- cial sacrifice of donating fifty cents or a dollar to further the integration cause is not excessive for the average Union College student. It iM more difficult to do something meaningful about ending dlJJI'JPJrt~4:aSJtion both in the South and in the North. The Northern $'tudents Movement is attempting to make a significant contribution in this respect. They are hold- ing a meeting in Old Chapel at 8 PM on Sunday night to plan ~uture campaigns to raise money for the voter regis- tration drive in the south and also to deal with the serious discri~tion problems in Schenetcady of which many of the supposedly more enlightened members of the comtQ.Ull· ity seem to be ignorant. It will be interesting to see how many of the supposedly liberal Union students show up. A Sign ··of Maturity The Lectures and Concerts Committee has long striven to make convocations as meaningful as possible, in an at- tempt to rouse student interest to the point at which com- pulsory chapel attendance could be discarded. We feel the Committee has fulfilled its purpose. Almost without ex- ception, every lecturer to visit the campus this year has been both stimulating and informative, and it is now for the students to display an interest in these speakers com- mensurate with the age and intellectual and social level expected of them, something which was conspicuously ab- sent at the Kissenger convocation held Mcmday evening. Whether or not Mr. Kissenger was the most profound lecturer to grace the podium, of Memorial Chapel this year is of little consequence, while the fact that a minority of students chose to leave before the end of the convocation Mast a sad reflectit;m upon their maturity, and that of the student body as a whole. It was comforting that a majority M students were interested enough in what was being said to remain until the end of the question period; but the shuf- fling exit of those few students representing the convoca- tiofi ~~~redit-seekers,\ served to disturb, and embarrass the rest. We hope that in the future, should the interest of the~e students in the procedings be nil, their. knowledge of crotnmon courtesy deter them from repeating this spectacle.

To the present time, no satisfactory system of control for a multi- lateral force such as NATO has been conceived. At the same time no practical, alterna,tl;\, ea for ~ unified force has ' ' U:t forth ·which would insur plete de- fen.se for all parti n:volved or which could be rec 'red to the Ant.erican convictio ·';·that it is use.ess and danget•o'us for Euro- pean countries to possess inde~ pendent nuclear forces. Kissen- ger concluded his discussion on this point by saying that it is senseli3ss for the Un~ States to argue the Europ~~ight to the po~session of nu~'llia:t·: power as such theoretical ~controvers~ makes it difficult foi'\ this coun- try to deal with thesi:; problems on a practical level. Rather than w:;tst~ timt; and create friction by e:r:termg mto such arguments, Kissenger feels that the United States should realize a need to cooperate with the Europeans in or.der to coordinat.e military forces, W!thout attemptmg to dominate European domestic policies. . W1th regard to political rela- tionships, Kissenger said that the major Euro,pean countries are act- in~ as strongly a$ this -country; this fact was made clear wheri these countdes attempted to ne- gotiate with Russia on an inde- pendent basis. Such attempts, according to Kissenger, can lead onl;v to dissension and fragmen~ tatJon among the West. The new problem for the United States is to encourage a sh·ong, unified Europe with a wil.Ifngness to de- fend itself. The hurt·· pride and irritation .of the United States in the face of European rebellion to American policies should not be allowed to cause major rifts or retaliation. The United States should not worry about the In- ternal affairs of Europe but rath- er about relating itself with the product that emerges.

'tlertnenFaceHa~nilton After Double Victory By Dave Liden It might he the outstanding talent on this year's varsity swim- ming team, 01; it might be the fine job Coach Tony Turner is doing, but more likely it is the combination of these qualities that are mak- ing the Union Mermen the most outstanding team so far this year. Its present reco1·d is 5-l, and I'm sure this is a. good indication of the way the season ·will continue. Union should be proud of the members of its swimming team, students who are willing to take time out each day to go through one of the most gruelling types of practices known to this· camp.us. These are not the guys who sit back and criticize Union's teams but the ones who actually do their part to make a name for their school athletically. Against Buffalo University :Elill Shauer and Phil Evans took first and second in the 200 free, a pool and school recol'd fo:~: S}).auer. John Boles and Fletcher Espen- ::;cheid took a second and third in the 50 free, Kal Schneider and Bill ~ernhard took the 200 individual medley, and Lawton Morrison and Dave Warmfiash came out second and third in the diving. Will Grant and Mike Miller pulled out a first and third in the 200 fly, Fletcher Espenscheid and John Boles copped a second and third in the 100 freestyle, and Dick Beane and Jim Garrison finished first and third in the 200 backstroke. Bill Shauer took another record in the 500 freestyle followed by a third fr-om Evans. Unbeatable Will Grant held his title in the 200 breaststroke and was .supported by AI Rosner who came in third, while the team of Bernhard, Boles, Schneider, and Shauer walked away with the school and pool record in the 400 freestyle relay. Despite the out- standing swimming of B.D.'s Szu- ~p.inski, who won the 50 and 100 free, Union chalked up a 57-36 0----------------~--------------------~------------~--- GarnetEdgesAmherstFive On Lustig~s Late Buckets By Richard Erdoes . After their spe~tacular 52-50 upset victory o\'e!' Amherst on Wednesday, Carl Witzel and company should be an inspired bunch as they head into tomorrow night's clash with Ste\'ens Tech.

Dave, who hit for his lOOOth point ·against Kings P&int last rt!onday, added 12 more against the Jeffs and also br.oke the school rebound record.
