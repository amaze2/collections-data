Six Biology Clult Sponsors !Talks E. S. C. Smith Opens Series On Intenelation of Seiences For Biology Clll b Professor E. S. C. Smith opened a series of lectures on the Interre- lation of the sciences sponsored by the biology club, Tuesday evening when he addressed students and guests of the club on the topic, \Geology and Biology/' at the geol- ogy laboratory. Pt•ofessor Smith emphasized the interdependence of the two sci- ences along the lines of evolution, pointing out how all types of fos- sils helped the biologists to build up theories about plants and ani- mals of the past. In return, he stated, various geological strata can now be identified by the fos- ::;ils they contain. Pointing out the oppm't.unities in geology for men trained along biological lines, Professor Smith concluded his talk with demonstra- tions of the various fossils in the collection at the geol<Jgy labora- tory. This tal·lt is the first In a sel'ies to be given by faculty members in the various sciences related to biol- ogy. Junior Prom.

This will be the first time that the League has convened in Sche- nectady since its organi2ation four years ago at Syracu-se University. Union, I'epresenting France and Roumania, was led by its chair- man, John Hall '36, ·a French dele- gate, in discussing one of the most pressing questions at the confer- ence. Although the parley was terminated before t.he question was discussed in its entirety, a few ob~ servations were made, throwing light on the subject. Dr. Arney Gilbert Reports In the critique's report, present- ed by Dr. Amy Gilbert of Elmira College, the rapporteur·s report on the Rhineland settlement, which was prepared by John Cortiss of the University of Rochester, was commended. Syracuse University entertained the delegates to the League meet- ing Friday evening at its annual Junior Prom. Dinner at one of the commons preceeded the dance at which sevet·aJ of the faculty ad- visors spoke and Dr. Stowell, pro- fessor at the School of Interna- tional Politics in Washington, ex- plained the attitude Germany and France take towards the Rhine- land reoccupation. The demonstration at Union is being sponsored by the local chap- ter of the AIIlffi·ican .Student Un- ion, whose president, Van Vechten Trumbull, will \pneside at the meet- ing. \We are all free agents.\ Although the college administra· tion and the American. Student Union agree in standing against war, they cannot agree on what th( protest meeting which tlle latter organization is sponsoring tomor- row shall be called. The A. S. U. has Issued a \strik£ call,\ and in all its pronouncemenh refers to the meeting as a strike. The administration, on the othe1 hand, calls it a demonstration. President Dixon Ryan Fox, who will speak on the program, light of the matter today. \It Is a good-natured disagreement,\ he said. \We are all free agents. 1 cannot tell the students what to call it, and they cannot tell me what I shall call it.'' Lake Ge()l·ge Disclosed As F1·eshman Camp Site Dr. Ray Sweetman Janney of Syracuse, a war veteran, and rep- resentative of the Emergency Peace Committee, will be the p:l'in- cipal speaker, and President Dix- on Ryan Fox and Richard C. Sny- der, president of the International Relations Club, will also speak. Skidmore Speaker Here A feature of the demonstration will be the exchange of speakers between Union and Skidm.ore Col- lege, at Saratoga Springs, Miss Mary Fuller, a junior at the g;irls' school and regional chairman of the American Student Union, will speak here, while Leslie Paffrath, secretary-treasurer of the local unit, will talk at Skidmore. Opposition to t.he demonstration has been so far feeble and almost unnoticeable. One small group, however, has boasted that no no- tice or bulletin posted by the strike committee has remained up for more than an hour. The demonsti'ation, as a gesture aga.u1s• war, has been endorsed by John Reilly of t:he St. Church, the German Re- formed Church, the local chapter of the American League against War and Fascism, and L. E. Jan- dreau, president of Local 602, United Electrical and Radio Work- ers. In a bulletin issued to the stu- dent body this morning as they left daily assembly, the A. S. U. stated: \This walkout is more than just another peace demonstration .•.. Students are not the only ones in- ter•ested in maintaining peace.

The student peace strike \vhich will en- gage the attention of the whole college, with perhaps the exception of the .administration forces, tomorrow re-acquaints us with the question of war, and the rneans of coml>at- ting it. In the first place our interest lies with the prevention of it. 'The means of ac- complishing this fact are .several, world- wide education as Druce Barton ca1·l'ies on, group educatian as the student strike cam- paign, a11d individual education. Of the three the first seems to be the rnost perfect from a psychological point of view and the last least likely to succeed, !Jeing too philosophi- cal. We dispense with th€m now as they are not our immediate concern. However that the students should feel overwhelmingly inclined to a pacific demon- stmtion is an indication which portends a departure from sane and intelligent discus- sion. At the same time it certainly will bring the issue to a head.

Do not think, however, that most of these non-conforn-.ists do not know how to dress or are unable to expend the energy and money to appear well- :iressed. When a wave of femininity hits the campus, or whenever they deem it advis- able, these same .students appear like a page torn from Esquire. Probably most of the self-styled \hoboes\ are men who are preparing, at least, for white collar positions. They realize that the days will soon be upon them when they will hav€ to face the razor every morning, and deck themselves in pressed conservative suits, often with coats and pants matching. Therefore they are detel'ITiined to relax and enjoy the short period of comparative free- dom which still remains to them.

R. K. 0. Radio has produced with this team a series of musical pictui·es which .stand as the best in the efforts of the sound screen to adapt music to the conventions of the camera. Other studios have had their moments of success, but they have inevitably bogged down into the routine of formula story and formula spectacle until the audience knows just what to ex- pect from any given firm, as say, the Warner Brothers. Having committed themselves to the success story formula as em- bellished by sub-plot slap-stick comedians, this studio has turned out a string of pictures whiCh fea- ture extraneous spectacle and the singing and occasicmally irritating mannerisms of Dick Powell, with stooge effects by the lovely but mediocre Ruby Keeler. tion its leadel's must prepare for almost cer- ance with the common characteristic of tain failm·e. Such action would indicate that youth to seek extremes, they prefer to dis- the students, but superficially interested in tinguish themselves from the other extreme; Others have tried to popularize opera, with diminishing success. Here again the success story for- mula is the Frankenstein that slays. Outside of the first Grace Moore pictures the only operatic film to attain excellence was the Marx brothers' \A Night At the Opera.\ Laurel and Hardy have translated a few operettas onto the screen and negligibly. Their \:Babes in Toyland\ was successful because it explored the realm ef fantasy expertly to the accompaniment of a Victor Herbert score. the question of war as demonstrations pre- sent it, desi1·ed only t(} a void their eleven o'clock classes. the college \Hot Dog\ type, characterized by loud, contrasting cloth.es, \high-water\ slacks, and \Propeller\ bow ties.

Speaking on \An Engineering View of and From Steinmetz,\ Mr. Swope considered the future of engineering education as well as giving a characteristic portrait of the famous scientist who for 40 years was with the General Elec- tric Company and for half that time professor in the electrical en- gineering department at Union. Opportunity for All Mr. Swope drew several of his conclusions from a rather detailed consideration of the opportunities afforded the American citiz;en. He said: \One cannot help but feel stimulated by the thought that the open door and the fregdom of opportunity that was in this case offered to an exceptionally gifted man characterizes the United States and its institutions. This country has long had a concep- tion and a tradition of freedom and has offered an equality of op- portunity to men and women for their development, which on the whole has brought about fairer distribution of material wealth and livelihood than in any other country in the history of the world. This breadth of view and tolerance, sympathy and admira- tion for a man's genius, irrespec- tive of his nationality or his class or his creed, is magnificently il- lustrated by Steinmetz' entrance into this country as a penniless immigrant, finding work and rec- ognition, leading to a full nahza- tion of his capabilities. He was so impressed with the breadth of op- portunity here that he soo11 ap- plied for citizenship. ----01---- Final Art Exhibit Opens in Old Gsm Rembrandt, Dm·er Et(!hings Displayed in Collection of Robert L. Smith 1\londay, April 20. The fourth and final art show of the current season under the auspices of the College Woman's Club--an exhibi- tion of etchings from the collection of Robert L. Smith -opened this afternoon at the Old Gym Dorm. Among the range of artists whose wor·ks are represented are the clasBic masters Albrecht Durer and Rembrandt. and the conternpor- ar ies, Lev on \VPst, and Frank Ben- son. Although it is always refreshing to look again at the works of such men as Durer and R~mbrandt after the usual t·un of unimportant screeching moderns, the contempor- aries in this show have much which is of ran beauty both in form and content. Levon West occupies the prominent role, if numbers ate to be ~onditioning factors in our judg- ment. Five of his etchings dernan•l out· attention. He is a competent craftsman. He has a stl illing- clar- ity soothing in this day of confu- sion and whether he works with bold line such as in ''Mountain Ranger\ or with the more weighty stroltes of \Hansom Cab\ he pro- duces a finished picture that is full of movement. All these and more standing in the shadow of Rembrandt's magni- ficent ''Abraham and Isaac\ malte for a very interesting show. This show will not be open evening<. The visiting hours are from 3 to 6 p, m. daily. A. W.

The first occasion this year was its statement that it would retain the .system of attendance which it now employs. In both of these policies it hass shown itself confident of two things: Lhat its members are not afraid to throw themselves open to criticism, and that they hold a steadfast confidence in the ability of the Union college student to think for him- self.

Cummins, head of the division. presented the essence of the division's pro- gressive policy when he wrote: \The request was made on the gTounds that the student has a vital interest in his own education, that he is not a docile robot, and that a knowl- edge of the point of view of the mature stu- dent is essential to the working- out of a satisfactory educational program.\ Individually, the men who teach social studies here have all escaped the academic rut which unfortunately entraps so many college professors. The fact that their in- terests and studies require them to progress with the society which they are helping to mold explains in part why they are able to foresee and help to bring about these ad- vances. More than that, however, is the in- dividual characteristics which they possess. Their courses do not consist of dry lectures from notes which they have carefully pre- served. Theil· thoughts are not stereotyped. Their continual activity as individuals keeps their courses alw:ay.s fresh. They are men who have confidence that their work has real value; their rewards consist mainly in this knowledge that they are giving more than can be measured by any scale now in use. Two things a.bout the program were note- \Vol\thy: one organization, the American Stu- dent Union, had given thought to its ac- tion; the other, the Vete1·ans of Future Wars, was working with no purpose in mind other than \t(} protest against the pro- testel·s.\ Their action in attempting to tear down a serious program had absolutely no positive side. It was not eveR very original, and showed no maturity of thought what- soever. While their entrance may have been spectacular, it ·was also most ung-entlemanly.

Audiences in Hudson Falls, New Ymk, Binghamton, Elmira, and many other cities have heard them, but most of their own fellow stud.ents have not. Besides this short, ten-minute :program, the Club sang only once more in Schenec• tady, and that was last Friday night at the Mohawk Golf Club. Few students were pres- ent, and by no means all of the alumni, whose local association sponsored the event. The fact that the Alumni Association charged a reasonable admission f.ee for the concert, in order to add to their scholar- ship fund, is fully justifiable, and not at all blameworthy. But it is unfortunate that the Glee Club cannot sing in the Memorial Cha- pel in a regular concert for the student body. and most successful thing he has ever written and a perfect vehicle for the artists who interpret it. Nor is Miss Cornell the whole show. She has to contend for acting honors in many scenes with such names as MauMee Evans, Brian Aherne, Arthur Byron and Eduardo Cian- nelli. We came away from the Mar- tin Beck theatre, exhausted, wrung dry, but very happy. We decided that if we never saw another play, our Joss would not be too great. Ina Claire, Osgood Perkins, and Shepperd Strudwick are at present romping thru \End of Summer\ at the Guild Theatre. Like most of S. N. Berhman's work, it is not a play, but a conversation piece. However if yo·U want to spend a very civil- ized afternoon and listen to smart dialogue cleverly handled in the Guild manner go to their Thursday matinee. T. S. Adding to our theatrical directory of the big city, we also urge that you stop in at any performance at all of Edith Wharton's \Etban Frome.\ There is a play which though it won't revolutionize the theatre, or point out some great so- cial problem, will tie you into a few knots and then wring you out. McClintic keeps the tone of th~ play very low, allowing no greatly passionate outbursts except in one scene. For the most part of the two hours or so the actors are in the repressed, cold atrnosphez e of a poor farm, whose inhabitants have been brought up in the closemouth- ed, Puritan tradition.

Salad, who was a regular last year, is also rounding into shape and iu ex· pected to have a successful season. Doubles Strong Second to Hawley is Joe Cohen. From a. mediocre start Cohen has rapidly developed his stroking and general court poise till he has be- come a very dependable singles player. His work in doubles has measured up well, too. These two are undoubtedly the outstanding singles contenders. There are three untried doubles combinations. Hawley-McGee have put such dash and fire into theh:- play that with generalship, which experience brings, they should be a formidable pair. Finch-Hallenbeck jumped into prominence early in the season.

Prosaic, bl ue-overalled workmen will invade the Alumni Gymnasium tomorrow to begin their task of making an enchanted, evaneticent ballroom out of it for the major event of the social season, the Jun- ior Prom, on Friday night. The Pmm music will, of course, be furnished by ltiham Jones and his Columbia Broadcasting System orchestra, featut•ing Woody Her- man and Ted Stone as soloists. The programs and favors will be more expensive than ever, ihe decora- tions more attractive, and the fresh- men more overworked as they n1ove heavy furniture into the booths.

Reporter Reveals Trifold Purpose Of Wastebaskets In Silliman Hall The sale of tickets· has already opened, and studentd are urged to reserve theirs as early as possible at the News Bureau from 9 a. m. to 5 p. m. every day. Saturday, April 25.- The estab- lishment of a National Peace Day as part of a permanent educational program for peace was favored by the Middle Atlantic Conference of the National Student Federation of America at its meeting at the New York State Teacher's College in Al- bany yesterday and today. Union College was represented at the con- ference by Richard Snyder '37, Bur- ton Delack '36, and Robert Ever- est '3'7. The limited seating facilities in the Hale House dining hall and lounges has necessitate<! limiting the sale of tickets to 300 persons.

William E. Grady, Associate Superintendent of Schools in New York City, in his speech before the Union College Christian Association tonight in the Old Cha- pel on \A School Man Looks at Crime.\ Dr. Grady said that school people are apt to place the blame for. ju':- enile delinquency on others whtle rt is obvious that the school as a so- cial agent occupies a strategic po- sition in the prevention of crime. He suggested that the schools be run on the plan of a large business organization which follows its pro- duct into the marltet and inquires into the result of its work. Dr. Frank M.oore, president of Slddmore College, Mr. Clark M. Cichelberter, director of the League of Nations Association in America, and Dr. A. R. Brewbaker, president of the New Yo-rk State Teacher's College, addressed the conference. About twenty colleges in the mid- dle Atlantic region were repre- sented. Answering his own question, \What conditions in the school sys- tem are causing maladjustment?\ Dr. Grady said that the schools will m.ake no headway in this problem .by merely adopting a \goody goody\ attitude. He gave several reforms such as the replacing of old school buildings in slum areas, by modern str.uctures, and remodeling schools to give the student more freedom of action. Because a purely aca-' demic curriculum does not fit the needs of every student, more occu- pational worll; was recommended, Union's part in the conference was mainly passive as the delegates had to accustom themselves to the procedure of meetings. The three Union delegates were favorably im- pressed with the conference and the NSFA, according to Richard Snyder. \On the whole,\ he said, \I think we accomplished a lot. We found that Union was behind the times in some things: and ahead in others.\ The delegates will make their re- port to the Student Councll, which body they t·epresented at the con- fel·ence. \Continued on Page 4> \Rhymes Ab()ut College\ by H.A.L., New Book of Verse, Appears Today Twenty-five humorous poems on college subjects culled frcm two de- cades of contributing to various newspaper columns have been col- lected and published, and are being put on sale today under the title \Rhymes About College\ by H.

Issue Editors who will best represent the interests of all Union students on the Student Council. YOUTH MOVEMEN'JS Sunday's set·mon brought out the inter- esting observation of an intellect whose con- tact with his subject is at once close and nnal:vtical. Dr. Kmmnerer, f(i)]:\ he was the pt·e~:{cher, is the ])l'ovost of a New England preparatory school and has had an extensive education in liberal arts and theology. From this qualified position he presented an enlightening, for so it must have seemed to us students, twenty minute ta:lk on youth movements. His thoug·ht-provoking ideas dwelt mostly on the leadership of these movements, for it is there that the trouble, which he laments is a result of democracy, lies. Youth movements, endowed -with the purpose of infiltrating society with the ideas of youth and regimented under youthful leaders, become the dupe of politicians. For no sooner do the young leaders begin to con- I duct their charges than they find themselves deficient in the ability to lead, a wisdom which only experience can bring. They na- tumlly turn, then, for assistance to the poli- tician, for he always appears to interest him- self keenly in the development of :youth Ol\- ganization and his past experience with leadership makes him a mine of information.

We are living in a complex world, whose problems are daily be- coming more complicated. It is no longer possible fo-r a newspaper which desires to hold public respect to be partisanly dogmatic. The edi tor who would se1·ve the function of the editol'ial page must be given more to generating light than heat these days. It ls not possible for a man who does not have a broad. background of education and re search, for a man who ha.s not traveled and studied, to interpret intelligently to his community what is happening in the world, or to persuade his readers, upon a basis of rea.son, to take a particular course in local or national affairs. Mere words, even well written, no longer fulfill the purpose of an edi- torial page-which is to instruct to enlighten and to persuade. Men who write editorials these days must know about such intricate things as constitutional history, in- terpretation of the ramifications of the utllities problem, about so<Jial security and its operations in other countries, ·and al>ou:t a host of ihte1 national agreements and situations. There never was a greater de- mand for interpretive writing than there is at the moment. There are those who say that edi- torial writing is a dying art. It is a dead art if he who do~ it is lifeless and colorless and weak and timid. The space is wasted unless the edi- tor has something to- say anci the courage to say it. In the hands of a thoughtful, co-urageous man, the editorials may be still the most vital things in the paper.-Rich· molld 'l'l.mes-Dlsptch.
