'FlH~ first game of the season was playe d with Stevens on the campus. The gam·e was rather .slow, there being no very brilliant playing by eithel' team. It was characterized by the k:cking, both sides punting many tilnes. The forward pass was attempted, but resulted in losses. Stevens received the ball on the ktck-off and advanced i~ to the middle of the field, where they were held for downs, and kicked to Streibert. The lJa.H changecl hands several times on punts, ~AnJer­ E.O n regaining it once on a fumble by Steven.s. The forward pass was tried, but faJed aBel resulted in a 15-y anl penalty for Union. The half ende.d with the ball on Uni<On's 40-yanl line after punt by Stev- T he ball was in Stevens's territory nearly C'l1S. ~he whole half. in the second half Doran Brown received the lmll .on the l{ick-off. Stevens soon gained the ball on punt from Strei'bert. They atte1nptecl the for- waed pass, but lost 15 yards. In this half also the bnll was punted many times. Union advanced the ball to 1 0-yarrt line, where they were penalized 40 y:ards for \slugging.\ The ball was being ad- vance.d agaln toward Stevens's goal, but was lost on downs. Stevens punted and Potter received the hall 'in the center of the field when time was called. During this half, as in the first, the ball was in Stevenh's ~erritory nearly the whole time, hut the Garnet was unable to score. The game erLled a tie, neither team baYing made a score. ST. LAWRENCE, 5; UNION, 5. 'fbe second game was played on the campus with St. Lawrence. It was a very exciting game, and more snappy than the week befo.re. During the first half Union had the ad vantage a11 of the time, but in the last half St. Lawrence rallied and l~a.d sl·.ightly the advantage. St. Lawrence received the ball on the kick-off, but advanced it only five yards. Union snon gained the ball on ktck from St. Lawrence and by swift line plun:ging· sent it over for a t01.1'chdown. \Stub''· 1ni.ssed the goal. Score: Uni·on, 5; St. Lawrence, 0. Potter received the ball on kick-off from St. Lawrence. St. La.wrence gained the ball on a fumble, but lost it again on downs. Then Union ad- vanced the ball steadily down the field to St. Law- rence's 5-yar.d line, when time w.as called. St. Lawrence ldcked off in second half, and then Streibert trlecl an .on-side kick which was received by St. Lawrence's quarter and advanced down the field in a very pretty run, until he was tackled by Starbuck. St. Lawrence missed a kdck .fron1 the field. .After the ball was again in play St. Law- rence advanced the ball by end runs and swift pla.ys down to the Garnet's 10-yard line. Then on their third down St. Lawrence made a touchdown, getting· it by a fraction of an inch. Goal was 1nissecl. Score: Union, 5; St. Lawrence, 5. On the l~~Jck-off Streibert sent the ball down to the 10-yard line and H was advanced 30 yards. Un:on received the ball and advanced it to St. Law- rence's 5-yai'd line, but St. Lawrence received the ball an<•l punted out of danger when time was called. The gane ended a tie, with the score 5-5. WESLEYAN, o; UNION, 0. For the third time this season our team played a tie gan1e on the campus last Saturday, when they met the swift Wesleyan team. The game was the hardest that has ·beeR seen on the hill here in many years, for evei·y yard ga:ned by e·ither team wa.s due to strenuous work. Each man pnt his whole strength intD the game and this accounts for the score, as well as for such a we1l played game. The team has made a remark- able imp roven1ent in the past week, and this is clue to the hard and persistent work of \Bill\ Murray. Streibert kickecl off to Wesleyan and the hall was advanced 25 yards. On third down they

In the next scrin1mage Potter :njured his shDulder and Lew,is took his place. A forward pass was tried to Anderson, whn received it and made a good run, carrying the ba.lil to Wesleyan's 35-yard line. The ball was steadily advanced Jown the field, gains be.-ing made by \Bu&ter ,\ \Doran\ and Streibert, until the 5-yard line was reached and. Wesleyan received the baH 011 downs.

CHRISTIAN ASSOCIATION. Y. M. C. A. Gives Promise of a Successful Year. The first few w·eel{s of work in the Y. M. C. A. have been very busy, and there is a bright outlool~: for one of the n1~st successful years in the history of the associaUo 111. The reception to the Fresh- men was pronoun..ced a decided success. The hand- • ' books have be.en .Glistributed and receive favorable comment. The Inost not~iceabe difference from those of former years is that they contain 1 'Union's Rally Song·,\ by Kline, '08. The meetings, both the vesper servic€s and the Tuesday evening prayer meetings, h.ave been excellent and the at- tendance encouraging. The annual Fresh1nan reception was held on the first F·riday eve11.ing of the college year, and was a very enjoyable a,ffair. ·A,fter tbe address of wel- come by Faust, '(}9, president of the association, Dr. Aexander was introduced a.s \our Prexy,\ ancl gave some exceH €nt words -of advice to the incom- ing class. He was followed by Dean Ripton, who spoke f·or the fa~ulty, and by Dr. Ge-orge R. Lunn, who represented the city clergy. Then the various college activitie;S-football, baseball, track, basket- :ball and the Glee Club were represented, and Dr. . McComber spoke on athle ~ic llrospects, announc- ing a \·Carnival Df Sports\ on Election Day and urging every fellow to support athletics in son1e way. After the speak~ing refreshments were served by Caterer Joseph. At the first vesper service of the year, Dr. B. W. R. Tayler of St. George's Church gave an un- usually helpful talk on \Methods of Winning Young MEn.\ Rev. J. Havergal Sheppard, p.a.stor of the First Baptist Church, spoke at the second meeting, giv- ing smne thoughts of especial interest to thought- ful college men. Rev. E. C. Lawrence, Union, '69, who was for several years a professor in the college, conducted the service the first Sunday .afternoon in Oc.ober, steaking reininiscently of h•is lift at \olcl Union\ and taking as l1is .special theme \The Lor:d· is My Shepherd.\ At the vesper service last Sunday, Rev. George F. Prentiss of tbe Congregational Church gave a very interesting talk. The first prayer mee~ing of the year was held September 29th, and was led by President Faust, who outlined the policy of the associabion for the coming year. Mould, '09, l€d the following meeting, speaking on \The College Man's Use of His Will.\ An organized conr.se in Bible .study will soon be begun. Dean Ripton will conduct a normal clas.s, and small groups will be organized in the frater- nities on \the Hill.\ Maxon, '11, has been appoin~ecl secretary of the associati-on in place of H. H. Chadwick, who is not in college this year. NEW PROFESSORS AT UNION. The following new professors . have been av- pointed in the faeulty of the college: John A. C. Callan, B. S. in C. E .. , as instru·ctor of eng:neel'ing drawing, and Horatio M. Pollocl{, Ph. D., as pro- fessor of history and economics. Dr. Pollock ~is a Union man of the class of '95, and received a de- gree from Leipsic in '97.

Every m.em her of the Board will have to do a gre.at dea1 .of hard work in order to get out a good book, and it is hoped and expected by them that they will not have to do it all, but that the stu- dents, especially those of the Junior class, will do what they can to make it a success and the prode net of the whole class instead of a few.

The Union College Press Club, which has re- cently b€en organized, is an organization of which tl1ere l1as been a. longfelt need. The purpose of the club ts to get the college before the public through the medium of the daily press.

The n'leeting was opened by Dr. Barnes. The fol· low,ing officers were elected: President, Potter, '10 . Vice President, Ferguson, '10. Treasurer, Faust, '11. · Secretary, Fisher, '12. At the second regular meeting last Tuesday evening all preliminary arrangements were co,m- ft pleted and work was gotten well under way. Grover, '10, and Vedder, '10, were appointed the first ed-iting committee, to have charge of editing the weekly bulletin. Other important comm·ittees were suggested and appointments made. It is needless to say that this organization de- serve.s the hearty, loyal support of every man who is interested in the welfare of Union. It is hoped that the whole student body will stand bacl\ of the movement, as it is an underta.ldng which can be of the greatest value and help to the college.

It would seem that the unusually· large member- ship of the Freshman class had infused in it a more daring spirit than is wont to be found among the me1nbers of that proverbial mild and verdallt body, when one reads .·their daving reply to the Frosh posters. The \Sop.h'' po.sters, which appea-red ,a .few days after. the Freshmen had so willingly swung the paste brush at the direction of the doughty Sophs, was certainly a novel venture. Although the make. up of the Soph po.ster was as crude. an at~ tempt at w-it as might be expe.cted from pens of. the .. literary geniuses of prep schools, the. i·daa w,as met with general app.roval by the. upper class.n1en and. may set the p~ce for futur.e entering clas.ses .

.. I ., 14 THE CONCO'RDIENSIS SOPHO'MORES WIN CANE HUSH.· The annual Sophomore~Freshman cane rush took place in the college pasture on the first Fri- day afternoon after registration day. A g-ood sized crowd were present to witness tlHl most scornfully receive.d. The scene was not <Jver, however, for the interested onlookers soon .s.aw the gentleman making another frantic dive for the lil.ighly indignant lady. T'his was too much for her, al1d she cried out in exasperatetil tones, '''Will you first struggle of the year fOr class supren1acy. 1tinclly tell 1ne what kiRd of a man this is 7\ There- As the classes lined up for the pr·elim 1 inary sait- upon an o1d Irishman who had been watcl1·ing the tomato scrap, the outlook was rather dubious various- happenings with a merry twinkle in h~s fron1 the ''Soph'' point of view,_ as they were out- numbered more than two to one. ·.A.fter the supply of .sa1t and tomatoes had been exhausted, the classes U:ned NP for the final strug- gle over the cane. Captain P·otter of the :Dootball tean1 standing in a position midway !between til·e lines of the two classes, threw the baseball bat in~o the air and the rush was on. The \Sophs\ had placed their heav,iest men in the front line while the lighter men were lined up behind them. The front line was off with a rush and meeting the Fr·osh rat the cane pushed th(nn bacl{, while the second line of Sopho.mores fen upon the cane. Although the Frosh were somewhat handicapped by inexperience, with their large number they were able to break through the \Soph\ ranks and get within reach of the cane. After five minutes of :fierce struggle the whistle blew for time and the \Frosh\ were found to have nine hands on the cane against fourteen for tbe \Sophs.\ It was a great victory for the Sophomores con- sidering their number. But the Frosh receiv€d some valuable pointers on the necessity of Drgan- ization which will 1:1ndoubtedly prove valuable in their next rush. A LAPLANDER. Editor's Note:-.. This is a brand new joke, frech from the in-ventive brain of our estimable friend, Wrachter: In a certain overlo.aded car an unsteady ~indiviJ.- ual was holding on a strap in front of a very ·state- ly and highly dignified lady, Suddenly the car gave a violent lurch .and the man was deposited in the la.dy's lap. He arose anJ was profuse in his apologies, which the lady received with s·cant courtesy. At the next corner there was another sudden lurch, which ·resulted in the same descent jnto the lady's lap. The man's apologies were al- eye, removed h.is pipe and saiGl, \I donna, mada1n, but begorra I tink he rous' be a Laplander.'' CLASS OFFIC:J:,RS.

Since winning the cane rush, the \Sophs\ seem content to rest on their laurel.s :and the Freshmen have succeeded in keeping the Idol clad in a com- plete coat of red. During the first week of college the scraps around the Idol were most spirited, and .some nights the quick changes from red to green were made at a pace which w·ould have clone credit to a lightning change troupe in vaudeville.

XX:XIL UNION COLLEGE, OCTOBER 23, 1908 No. 2 jfo:otball UNI·ON WINS GREAT GAME. ------- At Last Lays He:r Rival's Colors in the Dust. s.WhGn the team of Garnet hue, Went up against the Buff and Blue, They sux~e did scDre a victory, W el1, I guess!\ The ··:;core of 1 ast !Saturday's game tells the most important 19art nf it, yet it does not tell the interesting features. The game with Han1ilton was as good an exhibition of football as has ever been .seen here ·On the campus.. It was fast an.d snappy t11Toughout the entire game, w'hich lasted fifty minutes. The weather was very warm for football, but the men played as if it were twenty d.egree-:l -cooler. Their work s'howej what a good coach can do for a tea:m. They carne back fro~m thek day's rest in the mountains with added strength and a.bility, and used it all in the game. T·he attendan·ce at the game was very gomi, t'here being about twenty-five ·hundred· in all. Th\3 stud.ent hody, C.()m.bined with the Albany depart- ments, made an e~ceUent showing. There must have been nea,rly four hundred students loyal to the Garnet, and they worked with the team every minute, both with songs and cheers. When they formed the block U on the field between halves, they used their voices to good advantage and the ·cheering showed the enthusiasn1 of t'he men. T'he Hamilton rooters did not nu:m·ber as man v as the Garnet but they cheered well and saiD.g their All!la Mater between halves with much en- thusiasm. The felling :between the two crowds as well as between the tw·o teams was very friendly, and as a result the game was especially clean. Drummond for Ha,milton did Sln.ne fine punting, .sending the ball on an average 5,0 yards. He did u qually well on the kiek-off, several times putting it within 5 yards nf the goal posts. Sidle and Rcenke also played a fine game. 1\1arfoiott made thelr only touchdown. For Union every 1nan played a fine game. Wal- ker was good on the forward pass. The whole iine showed great strength. Tfu.e three backs were the best distaince gainerB. Hequembourg~ al- though !his first game this season, was in his usual form aild made the only to.uchdown for Union. Kriegsman was a1so a consistent gainer. Strei· bert did not come up to Dru.mmond in the punts but made large gain.:; t'hrough the line, and also made a fine 20 yard .run, maldng fi'rst down. But the star playi!.lg, as well as the surprise of the day, was done by Doran Brown. In his posi- tion o·n the line he held •his man, but it was in his kicking of three field goals that he shone. The last one was a difficult one and from the 35 y.at:tl line but \Bumble\ wa.s equal tD the occasion and ' sent it straight over the center of the bar. The Game. ·starbuck kicked off to Hamilton's 15 yard line and the ball was returned 10 yard·s. Union pen- alized 5 yards for off-side play. Here Hamilton fumbled but Tecovered 'ball, loosing 2 yards. In next 'Play O'Connell went through Hamilton's line causing HanJ.ilton to lose 2 yards !more.

To the ··Eiditor of The New Yorkk 'Sun: Sir: Will you permit ·one who witnessed· the Union- Wesleyan football ga:me at S.chene.~C~tady last Sat- urday to ~correct an unfortunate ilnpression that the game was unnecessarily rough? Although there was an unusual number of accidents it was a clean, straight gg,m.e rigl1t through. Each sid·~ play8d f.or what it was worth; and the resulting casualties, which have been ri!tiieulously overes- timated, were not caused by brutal pla.y but rather by hard lucli. The old pbilos·o:phical tangle a;:; to A JOKE! By all means boys ought to be encouraged to play football. L.a:st \Saturday afternoon We:sleyan played Union College at 'Schenectady and only 17 or the young men were hurt enough to ·make them un·consct-ous. Eef:ore they had been at it ten min- utes one ca,ptain !had i1is collarbone broken a.nd the other had a .concussion of the brain·. The survivors kept at it till eight more had to be taken to tifie hoB 1 pital and seven in additi<>n were so badly iHjured that th.ey were compeUed to quit true ga1ne. They kno·cked ea·ch other otit but ne-ither .side s-c.ared. This was the outcome of just one game, and not much of a game at that as footbaJl ga;mes go. To smash up so many young men striving f.or an edu·cation in so short a time is ·an .accomplis'hment that will make the names of Union and Wesleyan ring down ·Ll!'!.e halls of fame a.nd · give fhem the record for san- guinary football. Perhaps someone is so highly educated as to tel.l why the game played thia way is a good thing. All the prize fights in six months never sent 17 men to the hospital and what would happen wh·en an irresistible body pro- ject2d itself against' an immovable mass received yet prize fights are conceded to be brutal and in its frequent solution.

Two of Union's greatest athletes, KUpatriek and Cregan are included in Arthur Ruhl's article, \The Men Who Set the Marks,'' published il1 \Outing\ for July. Tl1e article is a history of track and field athletes leading up to tihe ·Olyn1· uiad. In it reference is made to the great ath- letes. While 1 Kilpatrick is accredited to Union, Cregan is credited to Princeton. fl.owever, it was here in Schenectady that the famous miler picked up his knowledge {)f the track, while Kilpatrick wa·,s attending ·college. In fa·ct he be·came the great half-miler's protege, who looked u,pon •hin1 as his successor at the half-mile. He was ·graduated fron1 t 1 he Union Classical Institute and entered Union. While at U. C. I. he represented that institution on the track, doing good work. When Kilpatrick left Union and en- tered Princeton, Cregan went along. It was while here that he began to attract t·he attention of the athletic world. Kilpatrick is now connected with the sporting goods house of A. G. Spalding BroB. at Chicago. John Cregan, after graduating took a course at law. He resided in Jay 'Street with his parents. In speaking o.f \Charlie\ Kilpatrick, Mr. Ruhl says: \Kilpatrick t·he world's fastest 1l.a:lf-mi1er, en- tered the ·championshi1p ·class in the summer of 1894, when he won both t!he inter-•collegiate and national amateur half mile. KUpatri-ck was then a Btudent at Union. The half at New Haven was run in 1:594-5 and that at the national in 1: 5·5 4-5. Kilpatrick also w·on at t:he national championship games in the two following years, both times well under two minutes. \His world's recor-d was made at the games between t 1 he N. Y. A. G. and the London A. C. teams on September 21, 1895-the •most remark- able 1neet as far as brilliant performances went ln the track rist{)ry of the two c.ountries. Kilpat- rick ran both as a member of the N. Y. A. ·C. auJ as a student at Union. At the start Lyo·ns and Lewin took t 1 he lead and the former, who was an exquisite judge of pace, ran the first quarter in 54 1-2 se·conds, as he had been directed to do. Kilpatrick, who judged pace l)OOrly, trailed Ly- ons, and thus finished the first quarter in very fast time-mucD. faster than if left to his own de~ vi·ces. Shortly beyond the quarter 1nile mark the cha·mpion-to-be swung into the lead. For t 1 he next two hundred yards he continued to draw further and further a way, an·d although Horan ·of Cambridge m.ade a gatne rally and S'hortened the gap a bit at the last one JJ:undred yards, Kilpat- rick won d,eci:sively, sixteen yards to the good. His time was 1 minute 53 2-5 seconds, whi·ch broke all previous records, amateur and profes- sional.\ In referring to Cregan, the forner Union man, the article continues: \J. F. Cregan .of Princeton, who won the half 1nile i.n 1: 58 2-5 a~ Matt Hav2n in '98, on th'e day that he won the mile in 4: 23 2-5 was one of the best distance runners who have appeared since the reicord was n1ade. Cregan· looked the typical half-miler, but he went in n1os t seriously for the longer di,stances and re1peated his Mott Haven victory in '99 and 1900. These victodes in three consecutive years in the times of 4:23 3-5, 4:25 1-5, 4: 24 2-5, fonn the best rec·ord of con- siste~; t performance at the mile ever made at ::.\1ott Haven. GLEE CLUB.

PROFESSOR ASHMO,.· · The recent ,publi-cation by the Oxford Univer- sity Press, American Branch, of Proressor Ash- 1more's edition .of \The Comedies of Terence,\' is a noteworthy event in tbe annals of American elas.sical seh-olarship. Tlhis is the first colle.ctive edition of the plays of T€ren·ce by an American editor and the first complete edition with En~­ Us'h notes since that of Wagner (London, 1869 )'. It represents the ·s·ch:olarly labor of many years, done always with great ae·curacy and taste, and ;gives the student of R-ornan .comedy, or ·of the drama, ·or of literature, a complete summary -of knowledge a bout Terence .and matters Terentian in one attractive volume satisfying alike to eye and min·d and taste,-and to the hand. The book is appropriately dedicated \To the Memory of Mortime·r La:mson E.arle,.\ whose death made the American clas·sical fa-culty poorer by one great se'h:olar.

The text is Professor T:yrrell's recension, w-ith a few corrections of error and some alterations of punctuati-on. Professor Tyr.rell's brief critical ap- paratus is given in Latin footnotes, these being supplemented by Professor A:s'hmore's ·critical ap- pendkes t·o the explanatory notes on the several plays. Three hundred and nin·ety pages· of notes,- analytical, exegeUc·al, literary and ·critical-ex- pressed with skillful conciseness, give all explana- tio-ns neces·sary to the full un,derstanding of the plays as a whole and in detail. These notes and t·he intr{)duction are ma-de readily available for refere:nce by an adequa~te index, which is the con- clusion ·of a very workmanlike and satisfying book. The makeup of the book .commend·a t'he taste of the Riverside Press, a.nd Professo-r A:shmore's, leaving, however, a regr-et that American books can be printed so.

The offieera of the socities, as elected last spring are as follows: Phil-omathean .s-ociety: President, R. J. Ury, '09. Vi·ce-President, S. M. Cavert, '10. Secre·tary-Treasurer, Van Deusen, '10. Chairman Executive Committee, Faust, '09. Adelph~c Society: President, Mould, '09. Vice-President, Coplon, '10. Tre.asurer, Fovrler, '11. Secreta·ry, M·cCormack, '09. Hoth societies have organized rather earlier than usual. Each has held several debates, get- ting the feU.ow's into •training for the Allison- Foote debate, wlhich will probably be held early in January. The Debating Council of the college has also had its first meeting. The -officers are: President, Pr·of. ·H. G. M·cKean. Treasurer, Dr. F·. S. Hoffman. Corresponding 1 Secretary, Mould, '09. Recording 'Se•cretary, Ury, '09. T·he other members are Faust, '09; Wachter, '09; Carmt·chael, '10, and Cavert, '10. T~he student body recently :Passed a resolution in C()Uege meeting levying a tax of fifty cents per student .for the ,purpose of defraying the expen·aes of inter·collegiate debating. This will put this branch of ·college ·activity on a firmer basis t'han ever be[!ore. COLLEGE ME··ETING. -·----· The college 1meeting held on Monday mcorning was largely ·attended and a most ent·husiasUc gathering of the student body. As a result of Union's victory over Hamiltoa in Saturday's fo-otball game the old \Union Spirit\ was thoroughly aroused and gave vent in continuous cheering for the team and for each nf its members. Remark.:; on the game were made by Streibert, '09, and Starbuc·k, '09. Burnet, '09, moved that, in view of t:lle fact that the trustees are willing to erect a new flag pole on ·condition that there be no underclass flag fights, a petition for a flag pole ·be drawn up and given to Dean Ripton and J. A. ·Buttrick, and be presented by t'hem to the trustees. An invitation from the Men's Cll!lb of the First Ref-ormed Church to its social on Monday evening was ~xtended through J. W. Faust to all Union men.

THE ·CONCORDIENSIS VOL. XXXII. UNION COLLEGE, CJCTOBER 30, 1908 No. 3 football ROCH E:ST\ER 17; UN JON, 0. Last Saturday tiie Garnet t:ean1 played its first losing gan1e this sea>3on, witb Roc:hester, on their field. The score wa:s due to two things, the fact that Roche;:;ter 1latil a little better tea111, and also th3t Union had son1:e hard luck, two of her best n1en being put out of the gm~e in ·the first half, because o,f injuries. Yet the tean1 did not seen1 to have t:he speed and force that it had in the two previo:us ga,mes.

McKean, President of the Debating Council, has heen carrying on correspondence with the Debating Council of Colgate., relative to an intercollegiate debate to be held ·between Union and Colgate se>Tne time this year. Nego~ tiations have not yet been con1pleted, but it is b'ighly probable that a debate will be arranged. A debate has already been scheduled with Ham- ilton to :be herd at Clinton s.on1e tilne in MaTch, so the addition of Colgate to {)Ur list would 1n,,t1\.8 an excellent schedtlle. T'i1e Adelphics held their regular meeting Mon· day afternoon. The subject was: Resolved, That the present tariff policy prmnotes t11e best in- terests ·Of New York State. The affirn1ative wa3 defended by Dunn '12, Volz '12 and Wachter 'Of}. Coplon '10, Carmichael '10 and Wils{)n '09 upheld the negative. The Adelphics are planning to hold a Sopho more-Freshn1an debate in their society some tilne during the F,all terin. The Philon1athean Society held its weekly de- bate Wednesday evening·. The following ·subject was discussed: Resolved, That a partisan in poli- tics c.an serve the interests ·Of his country bette-:.· than the in·dependent v-oter.

THE CONCORDIENSTS 7 DOINGS IN THE FOOT·BALL WORLD. No Ea-stern f.uotball team save Yale has reach- ed the middle of the season without being scored on. Annapolis, Ha'fv.ard, •Dartmouth and La.fay- ette fell bY fae wayside last week,· and the goal line of each of them was crossed. Princeton has been score·d on, but by a ;goal fr.o1n the field; her goal line is still intact. Yale and Prtnce~·On therefore are the·\\ or1ly Eastern tean1s who have prevented onp·onents from making a touchc'i·:..:-·; ... ,....:1. Prineeton s defence, while it haB yielded co~1sid­ erably to Ol-!P·Osing pTessure, has shown a com- mendable and encoura.ging faculty of tightening up when near its own goal line a11d probably has 'had more fighting the sha-dow of the goal post to do than any other team to date. Of the stronger tean'ls only Yale and Co- nell have won every game they ba.ve played. Harvard, Princeton, Pennsylvania, Annapolis, Carlisle, Dartmouth and Lafayette have not been beaten, but each of t'heln has be·en tied. It is an excep- tional state of affairs, that of finding only two or the stronger group of elevens that have won every gan1e. The lVlidshipmen still lead in total points and have averaged over 23 points a gan1e. The onl_y other team that approaclles t'his aveTage is Carlisle, with 21 5-6 points a gan1e, a.nd Willian1s, with 24 p·oints for four gan1eB. Both Carlisle and the Navy have maintained :a greater speed than the others, causing son1e conjecture whether they can keep it up and stay ·on edge. As to that, lt i~ up to the men in charge, and the latter p·rob-ab1y know what they are about. Next Saturday the two speedy ones, Annapolis and Carlisle, will come together, and ·t:hat ought to be one ot t11e uest scrapB of the year. Pennsylvania is the only team besides t·he Navy and the Redskins that has n1a.de over a hundred points, but the Quakers ba ve played more gatnes than any of them. Harvard has average·d 16 1-2 points a gan'le; Yale, 163\5; Princeton, 12; Penn\ 'Sylvania, 131-2; Cornell, 13; West Point, 11; Brown, 1·5 1-3; Dartmouth, 14; Syracu3e, 1G 1-3; games; Bucknell, 51-22, four games; Pennsylvania S~ate, 19 3-5.

Great interest has been arous·ed in State -and ~ational politics on \the Hill.\ This nas been due in a large 1neasure to the activity .of the Republican and the Democratic c1nhs i11 colle?;e.

On October 22, PrincEton cel8brated its l62d anniversary of its founding. A Tri.angular Deba;t:ing League has been f.or1nerl by Harvard, Yale and Princeton. Dr. Henry Van Dyke of Princeton wiH give a course ·Of lectur8s on \T'be Spirit of Am·erica, ., in the 'Sorbonne, Paris, this winter. T'he intercollegiate cros·s country run will be held at Princeton, :N·ovember 21. Yale, Prince- ton, Michigan, Cornell, Syracuse, Pennsylvania, Harvard and Columbi g, will c·on1pete. In oTder to encourage the ·sn1aller c-olleges to enter the run the requirements have been reduced from a tean1 of nine rnen to one of seven, who start and five to qualify in the end. Cornell 'has already one leg on the ~cup. The faculty of Lehigh have established a new conference department by n1eans of w!hich stu- dents having· difficulty with 1naErematics, modeTu languages, physics or ·chemistry -o.r t11e Freshn1an or Sophomore cla;:;ses rnay obta.ia extra instnh~­ tinn under certain n1en11Jers o.f the teaching f'o r~ct'. ~D charge is made for this help. At Wesleyan a new systern of undergraduate \\.'ork is in effect. Ins.tead of recitations five days U week as hitherto, they Will 1lOW h8 held SiX days, wit'h half 'holidays Wednesdays a~·l·d :SaLU·l·- days. ------- A NEW SPiiRIT AT UNI>ON. Th€-re's a new SlJiroit in the air at Union College, -a spirit of loyalty and enthusiasn1 to the insti- tution that has n3t sh~lWil itself to such. au ex tent for a long tin1e. Nor is the loyalty and en thusiasn1 that shows itse[f in a foolish effort to 1nake the college con- spicuous through 'hazing, rusheB or the nlischiev- ous boyish pranks that at -one tinl'e student~ thought necessary to show the rest that they were under-graduates. They still prevail to a. he:dt.h~· degree, but they Been1 to be going out of fashion. It i:s not the kind that manifests itsel.f in swag- gering· and copying tbe manners of the loafer and the loud-voiced individual who i.s looking for trouble. It is the kind whk'A shows itself in the willing- ness and the eagerness of the student body to give tilne and woTk to whatever -wi11 advance the interests of the college. The Press Club rec2n-tly forn1ed is one of the best evidences of ~it. A 'hign cmnpliment was paid the institution when the athletic .officia.1s and ·the coach .of Wes- leyan University wrote a letter to Union a.fter the Union-Wesleyan footbaH game a short tirne ago, thanking ·the authorities and the student body fo.r t11e courteous treat1ne!.1t given the Wesleyan n1en. T'hese are little things. Yet they indicate the stude·nts of to-day are taking- a JWactical view of the fact that a college is a place to train boys to be 1nen. They are con1.ing; to· see the value to the colleg·e of \1naking good\ before the world ·outside the campus. All these things, as well as others, make the IJron1ise of Union bright for the future.-The Gazette. We, on the \Hill\ here. realize the truth of the above article, and it vleases us to know that the l>eo,ple \outside the carnpus\ also r2alize it, and are ready to helv us in 1naking it n1ore ·;:;o.

10 THE CONCORDIENSIS Many things which we were taught ana lFJ- lieved in our youth we are nbliged to hold in doubt when a fuller n1aturity settle·.s down upoa us, for as time advances the state of IRan's knoWi- edge changes and successive genera Hons hold varying views on allnost all .great questions. F'o': n1any generation·;:; 1nan has been asking hin1self the question: What is 1nind? It is hardly incor- rect ·to say that each generation has produced at least one n1an who 'has believed hhJJ.:seH to he specifically ordained to answer th.at questio11. \-iV:J1en I was an undergraduate I was definitely led to suppose that the problen1 had been ·.s-alved. DY Sir Willian1 Han1ilton an.d ·D-octor L.aurens Hic- l{ok., the fonner a Scotclunan, who ne-ver .came LO An1erica, th~ latteT also a Scotchnral4, who dis- tinguished hin1self as President of Union College; and now, a generation later, it happens t'hat aa- other n1ember of the Union College ~acuity ap- pen book to support his theory, on the subject of 1 ten book to support his story, on the subject o{! 1 1he origin and growth and activitie.s of that lTIY;?- terious thing whicfi all the world calls mind. Trhe source from which the Scotch psycholn- gis:ts obtained their evidence as to the nature of 1nind was, to use their own language, the fiell of consciousness. ~ot only Hmnilton and Hickok ' whose books I was comvelled to read, but also part, of the ground to be covered in the searcl1 for evidence, that, so far as scienc2 is concerned, there is no n1ore reason for ascribing in1n1ortality to the hun1an 1nind than to the b'rute~Inind, and. that not only the .Scotch psychologis-ts but the Gern1an als.o (notably the celebrated Kant) have been radically at fault in their interpretation of n1any psychic phenornena. There can be no doubt th3Jt Professor March's book is .a scientific book, that it is logical and connected in thought and pl.an. Its staten1ents are th-ose of a write:r who has studied not only human nature but all nature; fO'r it traces the evidence, as nature hel~­ .:;elf discloses it. from the lowest organisn1s to the highest, the highest organism being n1an hiln- self. The book differs cllie•fiy from tho·se abo,ve n1entioned in that it makes its first appeal to the organic and visible w-orld, while it relegates intrcspection to the limbo of half-forgotten o:r semi-useless n1e.thods. All nature is its field, and scienti'fic en1piricis1n the 1neans whe·reby it reaches its premises. It uses the word, mind, in a very br-oad -sense, perhaps the broadest po·osibl€. It ascribes the property of mind to all organic n1atter. !t includes in the term, mind, all that i:::; conllll·Only known as instinct or in1pulse. It Tecognizes n1ind in the q,toms, molecules and cell:; of plants .and anllnals. The mind of man and the n1ind of p·rotoplasm differs only in degree, nev€r in kind. On this principle taken as a basis, Prof. MaTc11 brings mind and 1natter so closely to- gether that he practically identifies the two. \Mind is not known to exist apart fro-m matter; .any other positio:1 Tests at the present time G'.l faith.''

The result was that I (and others) left college with certain very s·hal- low and contracted notions regarding the nature ot n1ind and its relation to the universe. I be- lieved that the inind was essentially the entire man, and that the body ·belonged to t1le n1an n1.uc:1 as a tool or instrun1ent helong.s to the worker. that is, as a thing capable of being laid aside with- ·OUt detrin1.ent to the user. I believed that, whih~ the mind of a n1an was immortal, all else, inclucl- ing t'he entire animal creation, -was perishabl8, and that evidence for this was certainly to 1Je found in the facts of cons.ciotrBness. ------- --~-- ~---- --- Picture Framing--- Did she give you her Photograph ?

In developing hi.-;; theory Prof. March endeav·ors to keep within the bounds of the :s.cien tifically knowable. Those who are unable or unwUli11g -to separate sctenc·e fron1 religion are likely to do the book injustice. T~1e factB whicll are ad·dnced in it to support the theory are drawn largely fTon1 biology, partly also fron1 chen1istry and l)hysics, but never frmn tht~ sphe-re of dogma ·o-r of revealed religion. Thi.s, however, does not preclude the possibility of occa- sional references to Christianity and its sources'-- references t~1at are of interest in the way of illu.:;- tTation or 11arallel. But the work iB neither re- ligious nor irreligiou~, and it is certainly free frorJl that tendency to confuse the b3aching of the Bible· with tile scientific study of 1nental processes' which both 1narks and n1ars the works of the S.cotch psychologiBts. To a person wh-o, like my- self, can lay no clain~ to expert knowledge, Prof. Marc11t's book points to a, distinct advance in Dt;Y- chologic science, and in doing so is superioT to all publications of its kind which have preceded. it 'S:liDNE'Y G.
