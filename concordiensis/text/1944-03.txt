A teacher, pm·ticularly on a college campus, has an im- measurable amount of influence on the future lives of his students, a fact which is not al\\'a~·s completely realized.

BASEBALL OR NO BASEBALL This week the Physical Education Depart- ment announced that l'nion will not he rep- resented by a baseball team this spring. Immediately a wave of disappointment arose from the student bod~·. but as of yet nothing has been clone to alter the status of the na- tional pastime on this campus. It has been suggested that students could help to care for the grounds and thus elimi- nate the only serious obstacle. However, Professor Wittner informed the Concordi- ensis that only skilled men can be used for the \manicuring\ of the field. The Concordy believes that the student body ·wants base- ball. In fact that the~· vvant it bad enough so that they are willing to help keep the fielcl in condition. Baseball on a field, that is not in first class condition, is better than no baseball at all.

Zenti was his deci- sion that Navy V-12 students who become members of the varsity track squad will be able to substi- tute the latter activity for their regular physical training classes, but will not be excused from mili- tary drill and swimming. Cadets in the Union College Navy V-5 Unit are also urged by Coach Ketz to try out for the team. The schedule, as released by Di- rect0r of Athletics Wittner, in- cludes a meet with Rochester on May 20, but due to complications concerning the Union facilities on that date the location of the meet is not definite as yet. The second meet is slated with Trinity on the Union oval on May 27. This tussle is still doubtful, as Trinity is not sure whethei' they will spon- sor track during the coming season. The third of the Dutchman meets will be mn off on the Middlebury home-grounds on June 3, and the Garnet will then take on the Engmeers from R.P.I. on June 10 on the latter's track to top off the campaign.

Mr. Given wHl come here from his post as Assistant Director of Public Information in Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio, and will take up his new duties on July 1. In addition to nearly twenty years' experience in college public !~elations in Berea College <Ky.>. Kansas State <Manhattan, Kansas), Park College, and Western Re- serve, Ml'. Given has served as as- sociate professor or professor of Speech in most of the institutions named. At Union he will also give instruction in this field and will be a member of the division of lit- erature. In the announcements of- fice ·he will E·UCceed Professol' Bur- ges Johno;on, who has carried this responsibility in addition to his teaching from last spring up to the date of his retirement, March 1. Mr. Given, a~ a young man had considerable experience as a play- €!' and manager with dramatic com- panies appearing on the programs of the Chautauquas touring the West. This he turned to good pur- pose aftel' university training as a director of college plays, and as a writer of programs for the 1·adio. From 1939 to 1942 he gave part of his time to conducting the alumni office at Park College, as well as producing many brochures telling of the work of the college. He is now editor of the magazine of the American College Publicity Associa- tion, Publicity J>roblt>ms. In announcing this appointment. President Dixon Ryan Fox said: \Few people realize the extent to which a special profession has de- veloped in college announcements Chaplain Speaks on Needs of Men in War Lieut. Charles Shulman, a Jewish Navy chaplain spoke last Wednes- day in Memorial Chapel on the gen- era! topic of the value of religion in the armed forces. After a brief introduction by Commander Horner, Lieut. Shul- man reviewed the cultural, religious and !'acial differences in the United States. He showed how Protestant, Jew and Catholic, black and white. we are all Americans and working for a common goal. He mentioned that \there are no atheists in the \foxholes\. That very spirit if car• ried over into post-war civilian life would be a boon to a durable peace and it naturally follows to the ad- vancement of civilization. He exhorted V-12 men to \play hall\ to do their job well and in so doing to acquire a new feeling of Americanism. Lieut . .Shuman's address was well- received by both the civilians and the Navy. Dr. Elmer A. Tidmarsh closed with a selection from Wag- nm·ian opera, \The Dance of the Valkyries\. ---0·--- JK:INGSLEY W. GIVEN and publ'~ relations. During the past quarter· century most colleges have come to realize that their re· lations with the press cannot ex· pediently be left to the chance re- ports of student correspondents. still useful though these may be. To give counsel in such reports as well as to put into proper technical form the various announcements and publications which a college should issue, and to adjust many other relaitons with the public, men and women have trained themselves as specialists. Among these Kings- ley Given has attmcted wide at- tention by his energy, skill and good taste. We are fortunate at Union to be able to add him to our administration and to our faculty.\ USO Plans Double Dance and Supper The Schenectady USO Variety Club and Canteen has three events scheduled for the coming week- end. Two dances are planned for Sat- urday. A tea dance in the after- noon will be followed by a military dance that night. An orchestra has been engaged for the latter. The Schenectady Business ahd Pl'ofes- sional Woman's Club will provide a buffet supper on Sunday to com- plete the weekend schedule. The weekend events will prove very en- joyable to the V-5 and V-12 men who are all cordially invited. ----0--- What Frosh Should Understand of Life An announcement of serious im- portance was read in Chapel on Wednesday, March 15. It was sub- mitted by the Freshman Discipline Committee, a group that has under- taken the responsibility of training our new friends for the roll of good college Freshmen.

Profes- sor Cline is thoroughly familiar with the tradition of his alma mater; Union has watched his ca- reer for nearly a quar·ter of a cen- tury with increasing pride. He has been distinguished at California for his interest in the integration of humane studies, and that is a gen- eral principle of policy in Union College. We a1e glad indeed to welcome him back to his old Col- lege and his native Mohawk Val- ley.\ \The circumstance that Dr. Cline is an alumnus who made an admirable record while in college,\ he went on to say, \makes him .all the more desirable, for we have long felt that Union alumni were not sufficiently represented on the Union College faculty. As a stu· dent in uniform Dr. Cline went through World War I on our cam- pus; it is fitting, perhaps, that he should ·as a professor help to cat·ry t:s through World War II. While an instructor here in the early twenties he did much to stimulate the student writing of verse. That sort of thing does not flourish at the moment, but we know that peace i::1 coming again. Professor Cline has long been slated to speak for his class at its twenty-fifth re- union at Commencement next year; we thought it might be more convenient for him that day if he were living right here.\ Orders Received for Navy V~J2 Specialists Lieutenant Crawford Brubake1· Former Union Student Gets Wings in Army Air Cor,s Aviation Cadet Albert M.

In the familiar SI:UTOtmdings of the campus, inspite of the changes of a quarter of a century, we suspect it will not be difficult for Dr. Cline to recall the undergraduate attitudes and problems, with a sympathy and under- standing that will bridg-e the gap between professor and student, and that will impart to the student the enthusiasm of a scholar. We believe that his influence will extend, as it did in his unciergraduate days, far IJe- yond the limits of any one field, and that Dr. Cline will make the most of the oppor- tunity afforded by the chairmanship of the one department that teaches all students, to bring to them a broad view of life. \We live In two large hotels Con·espondents have i.nformed HS Union Oddity DepartmeNt: Did t ·llat .the Sou·thernei'S have alrea.dy k th t tl1e pal'l{l·ng lnt uoed which have been used by the Brit- pi·led up ~uite .a large. paper bag· you · NOW a · < · ~ ~ ish Navy for 18 months just prior .. 1 f by ALCO was originally set up un- to our arrival.

But the contemporary eclipse of the humanities, we believe will give place to a J'enewed anct rejuvinated interest in the per- manent values of what the mind of man has accomplished.

Aftet· having a wonderful time at the last dance we've wondered when the1·e is going to be another one. Faint rumlJlings have been heard in several directions and still nothing has been done. Within the next three weeks or so would be a y:ood time to hold a dance. The work has not piled up yet to the extent that every- body feels that he must stay in Saturday night and study. :\Iany of the men, have had a little troulJle finding something different to do in Schenectady and a dance at the colleg-e \Vould be a pleasant variation from the approximately five different kinds of en- tertainment that may be found in the sur- rounding district. A dance at this time would be a sure mone~·-maker for those opemting it because there have been no dances recently. l\Iany of the uew men who have been stationed here hu w never been to n c0llege dance anrl would more than enjoy the chance to get ac· quainted with the social side of college life, which must be neg-lected almost entirely be- cause of the war. If no civilian o1·g-anization is interested in sponsoring a dance possibly something could be arranged whereby the Navy V-12 Band was used. An <~dmission could be charged to defmy the costs of running the dances and invitations could be restricted to the student body as a whole, officers, ship's company, and faculty. Such an affair would provide delig-htful entertainment and help to make the student body a closer knit organi- zation. We realize that it would be impossible to run a dance every week end, but to give our short-lived college career a little more flavor, let's have a dance pretty soon, before we com- pletely forget that we are in college. IT'S YOUR CAMPUS At last spring is just around the corner. The warmer winds of summer will begin to melt away the snow and ice and the weather will IJe a little better for the Navy students to do their much loved calisthentics. Like everything else, all good things seem to have one or two drawbacks. When the snow melts it turns the ground into a mucky quagmire which smears uniforms and causes shined shoes to lose their hard-made luste1·. But this is not all. The grounds around the cam- pus became sog-gy and susceptible to foot- pl·ints. I.t doesn't matter who you are, or whether you wear a uniform, when you walk on the grass your feet still leave their im- prints. 1f not for the sake of your clothes and shoes, keep off the lawns in the spring-·. time.

The box scores aren't available but in 1868, the Union- R.P.I. rivalry got under way. This sel'ies could be continued this year to give Union its thirty-third win as against 12 losses.

Though noted for his wild actions, \Cur- ley\ was a safe, reliable player who contdbuted much to the sci- enoe of the sport. He was one of the earliest hurlers to use the \spitball\ and many say that it was a product of his ever imagina- tive brain. When a student at Union, Mountain demonstrated to his Physics class that it was pos- sible to throw an incurve and an outcurve to prove that it was not just an optical illusion. The big, lanky youth set up surveyor's rods in the middle of Library Field and proceeded to toss several balls around them while Dr. Staley stood off to one side and shook his head wonderingly. It is generaly conceded that Mountain was also the first to coach players from the sidelines or players bench by means of pre- determined signals. Coming .rown fo more recent times we have Billy May '18. Not many of you have ever heard of Billy May but back in 1918, Billy needed a passing mark in French to graduate. The last game of the year, with Williams, was in the last of the ninth with Union behind 4-3. As May strode to the plate Johnny March then his French prof., called out thA.t if Billy got a hit, Prof. March would give him that passing mark. Billy wound up and drove the first pitch right out of the campus. He got an A in French. One of the most famous games played at Union was the Greco- Roman classic. The Library, then (Continued on Page 4) George Haas: There seems to be an abundance of material, and close to 100'H enthusiasm for base- ball at Union this year. Yet, they are trying to let a flimsy excuse- no labor available to fix the dia- mond-stand in their way. At present enough students have vol- unteered to help fix the diamond so I don't see any reason for not having baseball. Baseball happens to be o:..r national game and dis- continuing It during these times would break down morale, es>pP.- cially with so much enthusiasm around, Let's disregard this poor excuse and get up a baseball team. Bob MacKay: Jesse, Hal, you gotta give m' boys in the Beta platoon something to yell at so they'll quit yelling at me alla time. Particularly Hoiman Breuninger, he's always yelling about some- thing. John Mason: Judging from the reaction of the etudent body to the discontinuation of football last fall, I should think that another such Student Council Resolution At a special meeting the Student Council held this week, it was voted unanimously to support any and all effort to provide a baseball team to represent Ur'lioh College tl'lis sea- son. Ralph Stehehj em presented the issue to the Council, and the vigorous response was an indication of the Student Body's attitude. It was the general opinion of the Council's members that baseball should not be omitted from the list of college sports and that with enthusiasm running high among the Navy and civilians students, everything points to a successful and spirited team.

C. N. Waldron '06, Secretary of the Graduate Council. * * * Perhaps I don•r tully appreciate the obstacles, but I should think that baseball is not impossible this year. If adequate supervisory help is available and assuming coopera- tion of the Navy, I would guess that the man-power problem could .be solved. At any rate the morale that baseball engenders is worth every effort that we can make to keep it. Player-power A poreible argument that our \enthusiastic\ athletic department might spring is that of player- power. Who can play? Where? How? In answer to such queries, we point to more than 1-10 men with ball experience (almost two teams per ship). Union has the opportunity to organize a terrific ball club this year, with such possi- bilities .as Leyden, Akins, Haas, Donahue, Breeding, Robertson and others just straining at the leash <as any well-trained thoroughbred should) and held back only by that inertia which seems to have over- powered the athletic department. Where we play is up to the fans. If there are enough fans around, any given plot of relatively level ground will serve the purpose for a few quick games of an informal character, Even our own elighted Ralston B.

LETTERS FOR ATHLETES Athletics has always been one of the larg- est fields of activity on every college campus. Due to the war. it has been found necessary in many colleges to curtail sports, partiall~­ because of an increasing lack of inte1·est by the students. At LTnion we have been fol'tun- ate so far to lle able to continue our athletic program without an~· majo1· changes. How- ever, here as on othe1· campuses, a marked lack of interest~ has shown itself. If this is to continue, all interscholastic sports might eventually disappear for the dumtion of the ways incited man~· students to participate in athletics and it has constantly inspired those already on one of the teams to g-reater ef- fort. Hut where are these letters'? ?\Iany stu- dents have asked this question, but no one seems to know the answe1·. Last season's letters have just never been given out-to the g-reat disappointment of those· who worked so hard to earn them. war. It is true, of course, that we should devote our time to more serious things at this mo- ment, but we certainly cannot live without any form of 1·ecreation. So, let's keep up om· athletic .p1·ogTam and arouse interest for it in the student bod~-.

Certain!~·. at a time when there m·e so many other mol'e vital things to do, the number of students going out fm· a sport will not be increased if one of' the main incentives-the receiving of a letter-has been removed. vVe all hope that this delay is only temporary and that those long-awaited letters will soon be in the pos- session of those who, we are sure, deserve them.

The money was appropriated ·but was used to build a wooden hockey rink instead Again baseball lost &ut and it wasn't unUI 1940 that the Field was rebuilt. This time maybe b&seball wil win.

Reported Missing JONATHAN I'EARSON '~2 lieut., Pearson Union Alumnus Missing in Action Ex-Concordy Sports Editor Was Navigator on Mission Far Into Germany Second Lieutenant Jonathan Pearson, a graduate of Union Col- lege in the Class of 1942 and Army Air Force navigator, has been re- ported missing in action since a bombing raid over Germany on March 4. LieL tenant Pearson ar- rived in England to join the Eighth Air Force in February and had participated in one previous raid. Pearson is a graduate of Scotia High School and was an active campus leader. While in college he joined Sigma Phi F1·aternity, and was a member of the Terrace Council and the Garnet Key Soci- ety. He was on the Concordiensis staff for four years and during his senior year was sports editm·, not only of the Concordiensis, but of the Idol, the student literary maga- zine. Lieutenant Pearson earned his block \U\ as a member of the Cross-country team and track team. Commissioned in 1943 After graduating, Pearson joined the editorial staff of the Schenec- tady Gazette, remaining with that paper until his enlistment i'n the Army. Pearson began his army training in the field artillery, and later transferred to the Air Force. He received the silver wings of a navigator and his commission as second liet:tenant at Hordos Field, Texas in September of 1943. Pearson is the second member of the Class of 1942 to be reported missing in the air offensive in the European theatre. His classma:te, Captain Charles Clowe, son of the College Physician, Dr. G. Marcellus Clowe, was reported missing last fall. Captain Clowe was a bomber pilot, reported missing from a mis- sion over Italy. ----o---- V-5 Yeoman Hedrick Going to Sub School Yeoman Harry Hedrick of the V-5 Unit has been transferred to the suibmarine school at New Lon- don, Conn.

DL Fox inform- ed the interviewers that on the next day a decision would be reach- ed. The decision that Union will have a team thb semester was an- nounced to the student body in Chapel on Wednesday by the Co- Editor of The ·Concordiensis, Sandy Hollander. Coach AI Ciampa informed the Concordy that Saturday's initial baseball call will be of the get- together nature. He wants to as- semble the men to obtain an idea of their e'<perience and ability and desil es to g-ive the batter·y men the opportunity of limbering up. Coach Ciampa added that it was needless to say that all positions were wide open, and that approximately twen- ty to twenty-two men will be kept on the squad. In announcing the re-establish- ment of baseball at Union, Dr. Fox said in part: Editor of Concordiensis, \One reason for hesitation this Union College spring was the unavailability of the Dear Sir: gymnasium for indoor practice.

These two are real gentlemen and spo1·tsmen of the highest orde1·. l t is not the general rule for the Concorcty edi- torials to be anything l>ut hyper-critical but in this case we cannot pass up the oppor- tunity to express our gratitude for the great \Vork these men have done to build the \'-:> and V-12 outfits into the top rank in this section. Lieut. :\larlette since coming here has set an enviable record of achievement as Phy- sical Training Director. The program here has receiYelt much praise from other schools and also from high ranking office1~s in the Third Naval District. Besides his work in Athletics, he has actect as Discipline Officer, Executive Officer and has made out all the watch bills. Lieut. :\larlette will report to ~atchitoches, La., where he will holct the same office as here at l'nioll. :.\Iuch praise is also cine to Chief In\'in, a v2ritable wonder with nun-swimmers.

The Li,brar~' is open to all who wish to study or read there but many do not take advantage of this because an hour or more spent there is enough to make the eyes sore for the rest of the evening. There are only two places in the building with enough coiTect light to study by for an~· length of time. These two spots are the libmrian's desk and the enclosed offices of the Head Libntrian. These are lighted by very modern flourescent lights while the desks of the students ·who come to study are lighted by an ancient central lighting sys- tem helped out by weak lamps in garish white globes. In some corners of the building·, especially near the edges where are most of the ref- el'ence books, the light is so poor that even the dust on the books does not show. For those of us who do occasionally look in a dictionary or a Who's v\'ho, this is definitely a harctship. Of course the bl'ight point is that this furnishes a place to sleep at odd hours but, after all, the Nav~· supplies beds for that purpose.

Even the Ghi Psi Alcove, the newest part Union Advisory System R-etained To many students the Student • Advisory Committee may seem strange and baffling, if not a bit novel. It is rather novel in as much as most of the large colleges and high schools do not have an advisory system. Union College, however, is rather proud of this arrangement for the students' bene- fit. The Advisory Committee is formed by the Dean to whom it is responsible. These professors act as guides, as counsellors, for the stu- dent body. Each student is assigned an advisor whom he may consult at any time and on any subject. This does not mean, however, that a student may not seek the advice of any other professor. He is al- ways free to consult whomever he chooses. The assigned professor is usually the one most capable of help and is certainly the one most keenly interested. Regardless of what the problem is, the advisor is there with a helping hand. Notice, the advisor is ready to help when the problem is brought to him. Rarely will he chase after his advisee to see if anything is wrong. It is wiser and more helpful, when the student comes to the professor. The profs take a deep personal interest in this work and are will- ing to do all that they can in ot der to make college life happier hy eliminating many troublesome worries and doubts. They help also by prodding the slow, strengthen- ing the timid, and harnessing the wild. The pre-medical students have a very special sub-committee in this system. These men: Professors Clark, Schmidt, and Scott, not only counsel their advisees, but also, help them secure admission to medical school and aid them in filling out the many forms, ques- tionaries and what not. visor before passing judgement on him. As we all know, the war has changed many things. So also has it had it's effects on this system. At one time there were some fifty advisot·s \''ho had as advieees, stu- dents majoring in their pat·ticular specialty. Now the number has been reduced to seventeen advisors headed by Doctor Coffin, who, in- cidentally, has a record of ninety-' seven advisees. In this way the system is moz·e concentrated and has proven to be more efficient. This is espedally true since the Naval curriculum is so diverse and has so many of its own pecu- liarities. It takes an experienced man to maneuver safely through all this. Another specialty in the system is Professor Ketz, of the Admis- sions Office, who aids the Fresh- men. He is undoubtedly the best When the college was still c!vi- fitted for this position since he has !ian, the system was somewhat on hand all the previous records different.

The coach went on to say that most men who are bril- liant baseball players are very sel- dom outstanding track men, except for a few outfielders or pitchers with exceptionally strong arms who could turn their talents toward javelin~thrpwing. \I'll be satisfied if I can scare up a s.quad of twenty-five men,\ stated Coach Bill, \and if we get a turnout like that, we can look forward to a fair season.

The \Did You Know That-\ De- par·tment: Did you know that Union College almost became the proud owner of a $250,000 horse- shoe-shaped stadium about seven- teen years ago? As you may have guessed by now, the deal feJl through. Harold Anson Bruce, Col- lege Athletic Director at the time, was faced with the proposition that if he weathet·ed the storms well enough so that his department showed a $1500 credit balance at the end of the year, the alumni would underwrite the proposed stadium for $250,000. Well, when it came time to take a peek at the books at the end of the year, Bruce found that be bad gone in the red to the extent of some $7,000, und so--. The would-be stadium was all planned out, complete with land- scaping and all the trimmings, and was to be situated on the present site of the Graduate Council field. That deal must have given the cash 1 customers a rea:! thrill. . . .
