From the Editors' Notebook A Creed to Live By HaiJIJi Levitsky's message in Tuesday Chapel carried the welcome ring of eternal truth in this age of outspoken ~kepticism. Fl\om the comments around campus it will not soon be forgotten. Compare 1\lr. Levitsky's thesis with Ralph Waldo Emer- son's Phi Betta Kappa oration at Harvard in 1837: \The scholar is man thinking; his first duty is to know nature, whence all power and wisdom come, then to make himself one of the mind of the past through books and at last to express himself in action.\ A Gentleman's Agreement The Russian propaganda line oft€n provides us with unexpected hurnDor. The \Bear' regards .Amer- ican :football as \balshoy bisnes\ or. \big lmsin€ss\. The magazine \Og- onyok\ a publication of \Pravda\, thinks it has the real clue. Here is the first of two parts of an article found in this \vodka vacuum\ of useless information, and I quote: \Recently American newspapers and magazines joyfully gave out infor:mation about a wonderful business at the head of which are the n1ost enterprising and clever prom.oters from every state in America. With a comparatively sma11 c::ontribution to the indicated \enterprise\, the promoters have re-ceived a colossal profit. \T'l!e fact is that football teams began to appear in colleges and universities in the U. S. like ants at a pi<:nic. Lively sporting interest attracted the students to the sta- dium.\ (Daley Field couldn't hold them alD. \'But this situation didn't last long .. Since student participation in football attracts the attention of a wide public, enterprising organ- izers of sports events began to take large sums from the spectators; a real \gold fever\ appeared. Busi- ness·men flocked to the stadiums ... arranged contracts, b&\ught and sold all of the most valuable play- ers. Promoters took \patronage\ from the university teams and poc- keted· the money. The university faculties weren't able to escape the temptation to capitalize on the sporting interest of the students in football. They quicldy created booking-offices which have changed into the present day \food troughs\' for the faculty ... \ \In one game the young players of one of the universities enabled severa,l suspicious characters \to earn\ $400,000 in one season.\ <Ex- clusive: Ed Fitz announced from his palatial estate in the Bahamas that next season should show a great improvement.) it it \Quite different is the situation with the payment of the players ... Enterprising promoters in prin- cipal games fureseeingly prohibit the payment of the players under the pretense that college teams do not appear as professionals. Never- theless college football practice speaks. for itself. The players get a genuine professional training ... almost entirely free from educa- tional occupations.\ <Any player can answer questions about that if they have the strength to answer. The best place to find them is in the library cellar looking for dollar bills among the musty pages whece the coaches have slipped them as an incentive). The Tippecanoe Conference could pTovide enough Edi- torial material for a semester-discussing the pros and cons of the issues. We have deliberately magnified the Study Period out of all prop·ortions because we believe that it has the be~t thance for concrete progress and a successful re- sult. The students came forward to request a time con- cession for a fuller 1·eview of the term's material. Here is an outstanding instance where the administration can show its good faith by helping the students of Union to fm'ther the goal of scholarship at Union aNd bv showino- the value of Tippecanoe. · o The Free Press Variety Keynotes New Crop Of Arrow Sports Shirts We of the Concordiensis enthusiastically applaud the courageous stand of the Georgia University \Red and Black\ in defense of basic democratic principles and the freedom of the press..

On tl1e basis of past per- f(Jrmann~~- \\'e expect an outstanding pt·esentation of the outstandmg play. After Congratulations L'nion's scholastic prowess was graphically illustrated by th~ re~mlts o\. th_e Kew York State :\Iedical Scholarship ExammatiOn. \\ Ithm the entire state of New York, Union students copped seven out of 72 rnediral scholarships. The concentra_tion became more apparent considering that 36 scholar:o.hJps were restricted to New York City sch_ools. qut of the ~n. grants to upstate pre-medical students Umon cla1med a dec1s1ve six.

President ,David- son and Professor Swanker clearly defined the term ''Balanced Col! lege\ as applied to UNION. .As I understood their words, they de- fined \Balapced\ as not neces- sarily a numerical 50-50 student ratio, but rather a balanced offer- ing of courses in liberal arts and science. In spite of this clear de- finition which obviously eliminated any fears of UNION becoming \all engineering,\ a few people still in- sist on waving their arms and claiming that we have a serious problem at hand. Nonsense! at. on€ time this college had 6 liberal arts students for each engineer . .At another time this college had 2 engineers for each liberal arts ma- jor. So what! We in engineering cannot graduate a good engineer without the liberal arts tempering in the Humanistic Social Studies. We wouldn't want to see UNION become another R.P.I. In fact, the availability of our excellent liberal arts courses is one very strong selling point which brings good engineering students to UNION. If the engineering enrollment has increased a ~ew per cent-it is probably ·because we now offer Mechanical Engineering at UNION. The facts are: 1. The term \Balance\ does not refer to a ratio .of students. 2. The engineering division has no desire to see UNION become ''Unbalanced.'' 3. Past history shows that UNION retained Balance through several periods when engineering was popular and unpopular. Conclusions: Those who .feel t)J.at this trend · threatens the existence of liberal arts at UNION are sim- ply \barking at the moon!!\ (Down Rex! Down!) Eugene Henke, Electlical Engrg. Fred Kindt, the head of the Schenectady Photo Engraving Co., announced today that, be- cause of the cooperation of him- self and his staff the Concord- iensis will be published this week and will continue to re- main in publication, photographs included. - ----·\ ------·-·-·- .------- FOR ARROW UNIVERSITY STYLES-------. for extra comfort I I • extra smartness 'Arrow Sports Shirts with amazing Arafold collar ~a me your shirt-we. have it!

CIRCUL.A-\riON STAF•F Harold Patterson, Ca~J :Mindell, Richard 'Shaver, Roger Harvey, The Pause That Refreshes Most of us look at the coming- Christmas vacation as a welcome respite from the unending grind of hour exams, pa- pers, quizzes, et al and a chance to gird ourselves for the com- ing Finals. It is certainly lucky that everyone celebrates Christmas when they do. In fact it fits perfectly. Coming on the heels of Religio11s Emphasis Week as it does, it is very appropriate tha,t Christmas should be cele- brated in December this year.· Besi<Ies, we should get enough wann sweaters and socks to last th.e rest of the winter. And as for money, if it wasn't for tha-t job at the Post Office every year, mostof us would be rea:lly on the rocks (without Ginger Ale, that is), for another two months. Incidentally, the worWs three m-a-jor religious faiths are observing perhaps the holiest of the year's sacred feasts. It is sincerely to be wished that we .may spare a fe\v moments from the festivities of the world to visit the churches of our choice and find the spiritual rebesh:ment that will guide us in further intellectual pursuits. We haven't thought much ah-<lllt that part of it up to now. Maybe it's modern living's :rwessure. But Christmas is only about a week away now, and it is one time during the hectic year when we can pause an<! IJOnder \Peace on Earth and Goodwill unto all Men.\ -H.L.S. It has been pointed out many times that men will refrain from dating the Sage women l;lecause of their outdated curfews, say the editors of the \Poly.\ It is reason- able to assume that if the .early hours hit a !lChool so c;lose to home as Troy .itself .that schools such as Union, Williams, Dartmouth and the others as far off will have the same if only more intensified criti- cism of this system. Upon the stand of the \Poly\ for this modernizing of an archaic law much response has been heard from the R.P.I. camp1,1s and also from the women of Sl'l.ge. ':['he majority of the opinions was solidly favorable to the R.P.I. sug- gestions' Even more important than the opinion ~pressed. was the fact that it was fm• the greater part unsigneC!, and specific requests were made not to print names ih conjunction with the subject. Pic- tures .of the recent demonstration at the Sage campus in , which botl;J. men and co-eds participated .had, at the request of the co-eds, all their faces blacked .out. The at- mosphere, as we see it, is not one of free public opinion, but repre- sents, more, one of a police state with fear of reprisals for imbljc action. :David. Balder-&ton, ahaitman ·of thE;!

It is . also interesting to see that even if the Student Council, which is sup- posedly the student ruling body, passes a law for a new .cur- few system the final word in the matter will rest solely in the hands of the President and the Dean of the school.

Note heating coils on the horizontal quartz tube. A new method of metal refining, currently in use at the Western Electric plant at Allentown,. results in the production of germanium that is better than · 99.9999995% pure- the highest degree of purity ever attained in a manufactuted ptoduc::t. The need for germanium of such exceptional purity -came about when research by Bell Telephone Lab- oratories in the field of semi-conductors led to the development of transistors, which are manufactured by Western Electric. The transistor is a tiny crystal device which can amplify and oscillate. It reduces space require- ments and power consumption to a minimum. Gertnariiutn crystals of the size required in transis- tors do not occur in nature; they are artificially grown at Western Electric. At this stage in t:ransis- Various forms which germanium takes be/ore being used in transistors are shown in· this photo. Bar at top is an ingot oj germanii11n after reduction from germanium dioxide. Next is shown the germanium ingot after till! zone refining process !(sed by Westem Electric; Below the ingots are shown· 3 germanium crystals grown by m,flcizine, 6 slices cu_t from these crystals, and several-hundred -germanium wafers ready for assembly into transistors. tor manufacture, other elements are introduced in microscopic quantities to aid in controlling the flow of electrons through the germanium. But before these elements can be introduced, it is necessary to start with germanitun of ex:ceptional purity, so that .the impurities will no\t interfere with the elements that are deliberately added. ~ .. So Bell Telephone Laboratories devised an en- tirely new method -of purification, known as zone refining, which was developed to a high-production stage by Western Electric engineers, In zone refining a bar -of germanium is passed through a heat zone so that a molten section trav- erses the length of the bar carrying the impurities. with it and leaving behind a solidified .section of higher purity. By tb.e use of multiple heating zones in tandem, a number of .molten sections traverse the bar. Each reduces the impurity content thus producing a bar' which contains impurities in the amount of less than .five parts per billion. Because of the importance of the transistor in elec- tronics, the zone refining process- like so many other ·western Electric developments- ha!J been made available to companies licensed by Western Electric to manllfacture transistors. This is one more e:xample of .creative engineering by Western Electric men.
