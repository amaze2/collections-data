Do American colleges really educate their sh1dents? The almost universal answer is negative. Our university system in no way approaches the ideal of education. The blame is com- monly put u.pon the shoulders of the undergraduates; they are said to acquire the wrong attitudes in their homes, to have undergone inadequate preparation in prep school, to be too interested in athletics and social life. a en an e was orce te cross many sea.s aud seek room for:· ·~Paramount llotel · the expansion of his avocation in the United States.

He is known CMcJta.U.Tsso F-mfi The Jntercollegian reopens the war between pedagogues and students with an article containing the opinions of prominent undergraduates. All lay at least part of the blame upon the college faculties. Maurice Buchanan of Oregon State College writes: ''There are professors and professors. Students may regard them as necessary evils which hinder intellectual progress, or as friends, human and approachable ..... Why is it that some teachers appeal so strongly to students while other teachers utterly fail to interest? \Searching for light on this question, I chancrd to meet a popular professor. 'What do you consider the prime essential· _in faculty-student relationships?' he was asked. ~' 'All teaching must be a sharing of the best in the lives of both teacher and student,' he declared. 'The learning is not all on one side- the teacher, too, must learn every day.' \A teacher who has the 'sharing' attitude does not rigidly require parrot-like repetition by his students ; he grades them universally as the World's Premier Bell~Puller. It is a J'eve- iation, unless one is too sleepy at that hour to be app1·eciative, to see the wiry young virtuoso spring about with agility in the cramped quarters of the Chapel tower, yanking on ponderous, meaningless-appearing levers, and producing unmistakable hymn music from overhead.

Wesre111 Electric SINCE 1882 MANUFACTURE.R.S FOR THE BELL SYSTEM an outsider for a whole evening. Despite the fine show of basketball playing that the Union team has been making con,- sistently all season, the townspeople have supported the Garnet courtmen very little this season. Their complaint is that the · game itself is not sufficient t0 till an evening's program; \some- thing else m1ght to go with it\. The band gives entertainment . before the game and between the halves, but that apparently is not enough. Perhaps it would be a good idea to have the · intramural boxing and wrestling matcnes go on. as preliminaries. 'Phey would hold interest because the amateur boxing and wrestling matches in the city are drawing large gates. '!'here are others who claim that basketball and baseball . would draw bigger crowds if there we1·e more games on the · schedule. 1 '1.'hese claim that it takes some time for the interE>st . in the sports to grow big enough to .fill tl1e stands at the games. Our opinion is that an intensive publicity campaign before the season opens and continued throughout the season is one way out of this dilemma. Of course we would like to see more games listed too, but the faculty are of another opinion and therefore ·all effort should he made to make the best of what is to be had under present conditions. WHAT ABOUT THE FRESHMAN IN SPORTS NEXT YE.AR? The present semester will witness the last time. that freshmen . will have participated in varsity sports, unless the new eligibility · rules that go into effect in. September ~re repealed at some lat~r time. The question now arises as to what will be done with the freshmen to h-ain them for varsity compe~ition. Are they to . take part in the intramural contests and thus develop experience for the ·varsities? Or will there be organized a full list of sports for freshmen for the whole year? With the financial situation • as it is at present there is little likelihood of a full list of fresh- man sports being organized. This leaves only the intramurals open. Two implications arise immediately from this situation, which dese1·ve attention. The1·e are but three o£ the fourteen sports on the intramuro.l program which have coaches. These are boxing, wrestling; and fencing. It is easily seen that unless there are coaches for those sports, which are also varsity sports, the new candidates for the · varsity sports will have little training, or what is worse, poor ·training, and what might have been excellent material will become poor. To obtain competent coaches for the intramural teams will cost almost as much as organizing a full list of all-year freshman sports. . It would be best for the whole student body if there were organized a full list of beshman sports because the intramural sports would suffer in the number taking part in them if the . novices met the experienced competition that the freshmen with previous prep school varsity experience would .o:ffer. The reason · why so many have taken part in the intramural sports thus far . is that the competition was about even, since the great majority were novices. Then it would be best to have a full list of sports for freshmen because it would o:ffer them an opportunity to get a taste of college· competition, invaluable in the varsity sports. l Ga: mil hal tot the the cis th< at tic it int sh co· wr of at be De hii se th t\1 ar Cc ar A dl tt st h: s w L F 'I h l tl J 0 u t I T t t t

M. M. E. AN INTERSCHOLASTIC MEET The Third Annual Union College Invita-tion Board Track and Field Games will be held here March 9. All the entries .are intercollegiate except orie, the Capitol District R.elay Champjon- ship. Why can not Union include more intei·scholastic events, thereby advertising the college to prospective st:(Ldents ? Other colleges and Uni-vci·sities hold· track and fit-ld meets for preparatm·y schools. The expenses of the athletes a·re home. by the a1umni of the <'ollcge. In this way the athletes, who usually are the leaders in their school, are acqua.inted -with U1e campus, the college traditions, and the sph-it of its undergrad ... uates. When they retul'l1 ]wme they will tell others about Union. Favorable personal report is one Qf the. best_ ways of ganring a good reputation. Union has much to of£er and publicity in the athletic field \V'ould be one of the best methods of advertising. If not a separ- ate meet for prepattory schools, why not include more intei'- scholastic events in the Invitation Meet? There are undoubtedly many ahmmi who would either send or bring_ wi,t;h them young men whom they would Ii:ke 'to see uphold the traditions o£ Union ~:s=:::::=::::E=:=:=:=:==:=ss; eollege. Interscholastic e-vents wou1d give just tl1e right o.ppor- .. tunity for s1,1ch promising athletes to display their ptowess, and their visit to Union '\vould likely he such as to jn.fluc;nce them to choose it as their Alma Mater. . :1-,_ Union Auto Service Co.

He, too, will agree with you that the daily Service is a farce and that it is very boring to have to attend day in and day out.

The executive committee of the dramatic society decided upon the plays to be produced this spring. These will include performances dur- ing Dr. Day's ·inauguration, duri·ng· the .Junior Prom festiVities, at Coru- menct\tnent and possibly one perform- ance before the inaugural ceremonial.

Carroll, tentatively named \The Spendthrift,\ \The Hero of Santa Maria\ by Kenneth Sawyer Goodman and Ben Hecht, and a revival of \The Betrayal\ by Padraic Colum. Candidates Needed As the stage is being built in Hanna hall, and the hall itself will have to be put in shape for its use as a theatre, a great number of men interested in any form of the drama are urged to report to John Crary, '30, at the Alpha Delta Phi house to register their names and intentions of twking part in the coming produc- tions in some capacity other than act- in~. The Mountebanks are ·in need of men interested in stage and general carpentry to help erect the scenerr, th properties, and general equipment in tht\ auditorium. All senior; jun- iors, sophomores, and freshmen can take part in the present work of pre- paring Hanna hall for the theatre. All underclassmen will get credit for this work as competitors for the posi- tion of stage manager. All electric enginet\rs interested in thE' theatrt' and its great field for ex- verts in lighting effects are urged to report their willingness to take part in the erection of the lighting equip- ment of tl1e stage and the general wiring that will be necessary to con- vert Hanna hall into a theatre. The lighting will be an important ft\ature in all future productions of the 'Vlounkbanl<s. The purchase of the h,•,t material for producing lighting \''uipment is rontemplated and any eiPdl'ical engineers will be offered .<,p]endid opportunity to give expres- <;ion to their ideas on effective light- in~according to William J. J. To- niski. stap:e manager. Efficient Organization 'With the appointment of Raymond Chester Clark, '30, as custodian of costumes, a new position in the Mountebanks has been created. He will have charge of the creation, pur- chase, and storing of tht' costumes to he used in the plays.. All interested in this phase of the d.rama should register thrir interest also with Mr. Crary at the Alpha Delt house. The property man of the Mounte- banks can use .at least a dozen can- didates to aid him in securing all the necessary furnisllings that will be used in the plays. At present the business manager is seeking many candidates interested in that part of the drama which deals with all that goes on from the stage to the audi- ence. It is tl1e aim of the Mountebanks to build up a large organization which will be competent to fnl1y handle · every detail of play production l)Qth backstage and front-stage.

Colgate, beaten by the ·Garnet, has since walloped the Anny, Cornell, and St. Lawrence. Union's tie with the latter was no small achievement, since St. Lawrence has had continuous practice on a campus rink ever since Christmas, and is coached by Mr. Mallon, a Canadian professional fl·om Alexandra Bay, former Pittsburgh National League star and ex-coach of Prince- ton as well.

M. E. WHAT ABOUT LACROSSE? Five years ago Coach VictM Rtai'zenski started lacrosse at Union and, in spite of the fact that he 1·eceived no prep school strns but had to develop his team from untrained materi>a1, he soon brought the college into national prominence. The third year under his management the team received honorable mention in the national intercollegiate ranking: the fourth, the last rulder his coaching, the Garnet was rated fourth in the country. Last year, under Coach Clifford, the team won a clear title to seventh · place in the national rating, in spite of the fact that a poorly balanced schedule forced Union to face its toughest opponents at the start of the season. Now this sport, which, duting its shod span of existence, has compiled as good a record as any other Union team~ is apparently being permitted to die. In spi·te o:f the fact that the usual date for the start of practice is less than a week a·way~ no coach has been selected. The Faculty Activities committee ruling permits lacrosse eig1{t games, but the athletic department budget provides for only six. Is lacrosse, which has earned its dght to recognition .a.s an important spring sport at Union, to be permitted to die, just ·Phones 2-0541 & 2.-0542 . :because, coming in a crowded .season, it· tales material away Fraternity Orders from other teams, some of which can present no record fl.t all Appreciated compar11ble to that of the Indian game?
