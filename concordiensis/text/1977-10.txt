Enteman to Bowdoin by BEN GREEN, ROSLYN STONE, and MATT NAGORSKY. Union College'~ Provost Dr. Willard Enteman was elected President of Bowdoin College this past Saturday. Bowdoin, a highly prestigious undergraduate liberal arts college is located in scenic Brunswick, Maine. A member of NESCAC, Bowdoin selected Dr. Enteman from over 100 candidates. They conducted over seventeen personal interviews beforCdeciding on the Provost. Dr. Enteman, in becoming the eleventh president of Maine's oldest institution of higher learning will succeed Dr. Roger Howell Jr., an international historian who is resigning after years in office in order to return to full time teaching and research. Provost Enteman is expected to start serving as President .. elect sometime this winter in order to become acquainted with the college and tlte larger Bowdoin community before he actually takes over. Concordy learned that A Bowdoin spokesman cited 0 ne of the ~ajor reasons for selecting Or. Enteman was he is- an academic with a profound dedication to the liberal arts with a business training. \Union was running at an annual deficit of approximately half a million dollars.\ When Dr. Enteman took his present position, the budget was balanced the very next year. Dr. Enteman holds a doctorate in philosophy as well as a master's degree in business administration. In 1970, Dr. Enteman was appointed Associate Professor and Chairman of the Philosophy Department at Union College. His tenure was granted in June of 1972. That August he was named Provost. His contributions to the college have been many and varied. He was involved in the establishment of the Internal Education Foundation and was the major impetus in restoring fiscal competence and solvency to the College's financial perspectus. Adcjitionally, he has published innovative papers about tenure and about t:he consumer and education. Union's present tenure process is modelled after Enteman's unique system. His work on liberal education is unusual in that it refutes the premise that students a·re merely consumers in a hotly contested market. The' position Dr. Enteman vacates is that of the College Provost, the second ranking administrative officer of the college. He is the chief academic administrator with budgetary responsibilities. The Dean of Students, Mark Smith, the Dean of Faculty, Dr. Paula Brownlee, and the Comptroller, Mr. ' Timberlake report to the Provost. His secondary responsibilties include overseeing Maintenance, the Physical Plant and personnel. Dr. Enteman's resignation leaves the position of the Provost available, a position which must be fllled by the college quickly.

CONCORDIENSIS, October 5, ·1977 EDITORIALSJ - .... ..._- ---- . Wngratulations' This past weekend, the Union community learned what we had for so long been afraid of: ~1ovost Willard F. Enteman will be leaving here before the year is out. C'oncordiensis would like to extend its sincerest consratulations to the newly appointed President-Elect of Bowdoin Colleae; it is however, with a bit of remorse that we see him depart. Among a group of highly visible Senior Administratotli, it is Ent~man alone who has not been severly weakened by the campus scandals, An outstanding teacher, educator and person, Enteman bas shown during his. five year tenure as Provost that he is alao a highly competent and Y,Ualified administrator. Congratulations are also due to the Governing Boards of Bowdoin College for having the insight and knowledge to perceive Fnteman as the great man that he truly is. We are all sure that he will do an outstanding job as President of Bowd'oin if due to nothing else than his personal drive for excellence and his own character. We can onJ.y hope that in these last few months at Union and during all his days at Bowdoin, Dr. Enteman continues to perform as, competently as he has served this institution until now. Smith Letter, In the final Spring edition of CONCORDIENSIS an editorial entitled Ju§tice stated, \Since President Bonner's arrival at Union, there have been a vast array of unethical practices surrounding his administration ...

However, we feel that these remarks must be investigated and the appropr-iate action taken. CO:\CORDIE:\JSIS therefore calls for the following action to be 1 m mediately imtiated: (I) That Dean of Siudents Mark W. Smith 1 release any and all information that will back his allegations regardmg 1mproper Presidential policy and actions to. an. ad-hoc ~omnuttee as outlined below. (2) I'hat once thts mformatton IS made a\ aJlablr!, an ad-hol: l:ummillce made up of student leaders and Ja~:uhy div1~10n ~.:hairmen, be established lo conduct an immediate Pre~idential review. (3) That this same ad-hoc 'ommittee be charged to inspe~.:t the PAB investigation of ti1e Dean of Students and male appropriate m.:ummt:ndalions on the statug of ~1ark Smith.' It is clear th<1t we must once-and-fur-all determane the ongans ol Presidential problems and administrative rift befor these dilemmas cause' trreputable damage to Union and its community members. union • ~ ... concorOtenSJ5 .

At a faculty meeting !aat Marth, President Bonner stated that he would ask for an evaluation of his performance aa president after his third · year. This is a . wekome step which many coneae presidents are taking in this age of accountability. There irr 1 nothing really novel about it; f faculty ha, ve been c:ondueting 1 peer evaluation for genera- . tions in American academe. In fact, the faculty review process is;ttlready underway this year at Union. Tenure committees are at work evaluating faculty members in their sixth year. departments arc planning .. Third Year· Evaluation\ for those ent4:)iUijj their f ourtb year, and the process by which every member of tbe faculty uru.iei'P goes annual evaluation beginning with his/her chair- person has begun. This comprehensive revil:w of the performance of all Union . faculty is conducted each year in a systematic, thorough,, and . fair m~nner which has become · indispensable to the maintenance 1 and growth of the academic strength and intellectual vitality of the college as an institution of bi&her learning. In this spirit, the time has now come for presidential review. However, since this will be Union's firl'lt experience in evaluating its president, certain questions. will inevit~ ably arise concerning the timing, procedure, criteria for evaluation. and composition of the review committee. Pre!lum- ably. the Board of Tnutees will appoint a committee of trustees, faculty and students which, common sense dictates, would complete its evaluation of President Bonner before the Trustees' review of his (..Urrent one-year contract. But why . rely on presumptions and common sense in a matter of such great importance to the campus community? It is not too early for Coaemdy to begin to pose the critical questions of .pregidcntial review to the man who asked for it . Robert Sbllrle~ Political Science Bad Conduct To~ Um~on Col~® ComptliS: c/o The E<i.fJitor A rseries of unbelievable events has caused me to write thi@ letter eKposin$ some of the unorthodox and bias,~d practices of the prerent student booy govetnment Durin8 the 1975-76 school year I was appointed, along with 8 other students. to the task of creating a Conduct- Ombudsman Committee for Union College. We formulated a code, drafted a constitution, and established guidelines for presenting a grievance to the committee. All members were reinstated . for ·the following year. and we tried and judged Jt number of cases. . Duo to aratiuations. terms . abroad, and resiJDations. it became evident d'&Jring SprinJ 1977 that I would be the. only mapplyins member for the upcoming year. (Subso· quently, Dave Becker, a sophomore, replaced a retired member just prior to the end of .Sprins tenn). Mary ·Mastrianni. chairman of the Conduct Committee at that time, ieeommende=d me to succeed b.er as the next chairman. Mike Ga.nz., chairman of the Committee on Committees, indicated to me that his committee has decided to make me chairman of the Conduct Committee. At this point a very contro- versial case involving members of the Union College .Hockey team was brought to the Conduct Committee. The Committee, like .the campus, was split. ln a euppoHdl)\ secret manner a 'split decision • was reached by a 4-3 vote. It SO{)D became apparent that my pro-hockey stance on the case was not well received by the Committee on Committ~. Mike Ganz admitted ao me . (and a witness) that my view· on the hockey issue had. alienated the Committee on Committees. Questionable dealings followed, and at this time l find that ! am neith~r chairman of the Conduct Committee, nor even a member; and the Conduct Committee has no experienced members. This raises several interesting questions: 1) How did the Committee o:n Committees ftnd out about the supposedly secret vote of the Conduct Committoe? 2) Although Steve Richards ia · sn individual who possesses unquestionable integrity, how can the Committee on Com$ mittees select a chainmn of the Conduct Committee who has no previous experience? 3) How can any committee member be expected to vote their conscience under the . constant fear of reJ:M:rcussions from the Committee on Committees and their farcical whims? 4) How can any committee expect to operate efficiently and fairly with no ;:xperienced . members? S) How can student body President Mike Ganz admit to me \you were screwed,\ and ' live with himself? Thank you, 1 Jon Mrugolll» '1&1 In Rep~y to Xavn~ra To My Deorea~ Xnvi®ro: Who the hell do you think you are? God's gift to the world? Obviously you got that impression last year. If you were crushed by that fantasy, too bad. The UColl men are faced with three possibilities. The first of which at least gives a faint glimmer of hope.

However, it should be made quite clear to you that our scars acquired from the previous three terms have been caused by your snobbishness, utter haughti- ness, arrogance, and your high~nosedness. In short, you have brought the situation, described by Xaviera last week, upon you:rselves! l On numerous occasions your blatant displays of the afore- mentioned \qualities\ have moved and even ruptured parts within us that cannot be replaced. Therefore it is our sincerest of desires that this year's freshman women will learn from the mi&takes of their predecessors. Sophomore girls will have to earn back the privilege of being wanted and/ or desired by the Sophomore male population. In the end it will be your loss.

Page4 CONCORDIENSIS, OctoberS, 1977 An Open Letter From Dean Smith The foJJowing is a verbatim transcript of a corresponden~e between Dean of St11dents Mark W. Smith and Presidl!lit of tlte College 9 Thomas N. Bonner. One hundred ninety-six copies of this letter were distributed to senior faculty members, administrators, and some elected student officials by Dean Smith. There has been a great deal of discussion regarding the contents of this letter among many of tbe faculty and students, as well as all those associated with the college community at large. Concordiensis reco&nizes that this letter contains many allega~lons and opinions by Dean Smith. However, in an attempt to elimi· nate the r11mors and miscon· ceptions concerning the content of this letter, Concordlensis feels obligated to print this letter in its entirety. September 30, 1977 Thomas N. Bonner, President Union College Dear Tom: I send this letter with some regret, not concerning what I am going to say but concerning the fact that, because of the miserable situation that now exists at Union, a letter to a man whom I have known and respected as a friend must be an open letter. I am aware that my behavior will b,ave consequences; I am convinced that these will be preferable to the consequences of silence and accommodation. By the same token, 1 am convinced that present circumstances require that loyalty to principles and standards and loyalty to this institution and its students take priority over loyalty to the President. The time has come for me to say no. Many things have happened during the past year which have offended me, as Dean of Students and as a person, which I feel have have hurt college, but which I might have tolerated, ignored, or left to others to protest. The fraudulent assignment of blame to the faculty and to the governance structure, your refusal to appreciate and utilize the incomparable skills and qualities of the . Provost, the political spying and plotting, your demands for blind loyalty and charges -of disloyalty when you weren't willing to be loyal to us, your discrediting an~ insulting attitudes toward individual students and administrators who disagreed with you, especially the Dean of Faculty, s'ome distin- guished junior administrators who are gone now, and student leaders and editors - these things I might have tried to understand. You-r identification with the ruthlessly unprincipled investi- gation by the PAB and the' shockingly dishonest defense of that investigation by the Chairman, the squelching of the results of the subseq1,1ent profes- sional review, which could have shown the PAB witch-hunt to be what it was and removed it as a precedent that could seriously impair Unic:m's ability to attract and retain able administrators - all of tliis I could have accepted, if only because my contributions speak for themselves and my professional reputation was too well established kmg before I came to Union to be damaged by the opportunism of petty, vindictive, or politically . motivated people. I might even ·have tried to adjust to the present climate and doctrines of intimi- 1 dation, expediency and pretense, at least for a wh11e, if I had felt that the college and its future were being served. But the mention of expediency leads .us directly to the two things that I can't live with or allow to remain unchallenged, namely, the clear signals that have been sent and contlnue to travel throughout the college and elsewhere that standards of integrity, fair play and excellence can be ignored or ~ diluted in the interests of an externally oriented concept of success and a pragmatic concept of loyalty; and secondly, the arrival of a process of .planning and decision--making which, in addition to being cloaked in tones of power, deals, and· •'dissent at your own risk,\ clearly precludes, in my professional opm1on, effective participation or even scrutiny by students, who are viewed as a constituency to be delivered by the Dean of Students. I am the Dean of Students, but I am an educator, not a politician. Th(: only thing I want to deliver students to is a. clearer understanding of how. much better it is to give than to take, of the va:lu.e of · human dignity, and of the worth of their minds. You have asked me to join in a healing program that is itself contaminative, from the point of view of my training and experience as a teacher and a student personnel administrator. I can't do this, I am glad that I can't, and I won't. Any respon$C to the effect that, if I don't like it, I should leave (to, borrow from the bullying remark of a mem:ber of the cabinet) I would perceive as . avoidant - and to() easy. And to those who Would argue and wishfully think that all of this is only temporary, my response is that, most certainly in an academic community, nothing • that is wrong can ever be temporary. Union is an unus11al institution, 1 unusually good in many respects, 1 unusually cherishable by many fine people, especially some who have devoted their lives to it, and unusually vulnerab1e and insecure in rather obvious ways. It cannot afford to be abandoned by or to callously abandon or ignore those who believe in standards, in a truly munity, and in the worth of students as more than transients on a scene controlled and deter- mined by a group of people whose credibility stems primarily froin power and the ability to contribute· to the college's financial security. Its most destructive weaknesses are its own sense of inferiority and its tendency to allow those who are driven .by insecurity and self- . interest to speak for those who really but quietly care. You have colluded with these weaknesses, inadvertently perhaps, to interrupt its greatest strength, its history of excellence and standards and dedicatiotl to undergraduate teaching. There are many theories concerning and versions -of what has happened during. your presidency, and I'm sare that the future will bring still more. You have heard mine and I you formed alliances. for the wrong reasons and received very bad advice, at times bec~u~e you sought it. You opted for control and survival when you could have engaged in leadership and sensitivity. And at a time. when, as President, you should have tried to bring people together, you sought to drive them apart. Reali;zing, however, that you and those with whom you are Working most closely have a strong tendency to place blame, I am asking you now to place it wbere it belongs ----\- right where the p@Wer is. Respond with this power now, if you are so inclined; brand me as disloyal if you wi~h - better now than 'last year, when it simply wasn't true. But for God's sake, let Union move have heard yours. Actually, the ~or'YaJ;.~ as th~ ~reat teaching blame· for what has happened msht~tton that1t 1s. and· can be .. need not be placed. you came to , ~et 1t ~tand for and ~each the Union and attempted to lead it in nght thmgs.-: and t~e nght ways directions which, correctly or of accoi?phshmg thmgs.

e CONCORDIENSIS, October 5, 1977 Page 5 Eats. and Honky T 011ks : A Guide to Bars by ED. CLOOS III One can only venture a guess at how long the above mentioned phenomena have been a part of Western existence. The modern imagination could perhaps conjure up visions of a cave somewhere itt Europe replete with a menu of Flintstonian sounding entrees and cocktails. Certainly we know that by the Middle Ages such well known roustabouts as Robin Hood and his boys had an ample choice of public houses in which to dwell upon their exploits. Some. centuries later Robin Hood's spiritual kin, the professional athletes, discovered the saloon and eatery business to be very lucrative for that sad period when the flesh is no longer the equal of the spirit. While this column shall aim towards a dual focus, this week's offering deals with honky tanks, as this is my primary area of concentratien, so to speak. Any perceptive U nionite can deliver a long harangue about the deficien- cies of \The City That Lights and Hauls the World.\ We have all heard such presentations, in such diverse forms as the sarcastic monologue and, perhaps most famous, the neurotic whine. Indeed, Schenectady is a stag- nant little industrial burg, perhaps thirty years over the hill. Largely for this reason, it is a gold mine for inveterate wastrels and rounders. As a legacy of its booming immigrant/industrial period, · Schenectady is literally loaded with places in which one can purchase a drink. \What merit, This?\ one may ask. Certainly gin mills are not places of high ideals and tremen- dous social progress. Some would argue that taverns are, if anything, holding civilization back. And what of the entertain- ment found within? Useless dissipation, some would' say. before A. While cognizant of these complaints, I would argue that the saloon is a precious institu- tion. Not only are saloons a fairly reliable refuge from the ,increasing hysteria without,. they are also a repository- for social customs stretching back over the centuries. One needs only to think briefly to come up with notable figures of the past and ,present who are/were tavern habituees. Having sought to establish the legitimacy of our topic, let us teturn to the Electric City and its bars. While a resident of the Stockade area, I was blessed with the incredible total of 18 water- ing holes within a five minute walk of home. A minute's reflection calls up images of President Grant in full battle regalia and equipped with sword, swaggering through the streets of Washington. in search of a quick one at fhe Ebbit Hotel. 'Images of such literary notables as Dylan Thomas and Malcolm Lowry also come to mind. Of the • latter, a drinking companion is 1 alleged to have uttered the follow- ! ing tribute: \Just the sight of that ! old bastard ·makes me happy for 'I five days.\ i In the coming weeks this reporter will review the relative merits of a wide spectrum of Metroland drinking spots. As a preview, consider some of the following: For Roast Beef Sandwiches Slick's on Liberty St., Rupsis on Carrie St., Stoney Lane on Van Vranken. - The Oak Room on Jay St., featuring lunch specials and double shot Smirnoff Bloody Mary's ($1.50). - Breyo's Mid Hill on. Eastern Ave. for pool, howling, and Yankee games. Short beers are only 30¢. For country music try Jimmie's on Albany St. On my first visit to the place, l had the ghastly suspicion that the clientele were largely inbred. The Revolution on Erie Blvd., .for the big bucks, white shoes and long cars environment. Catch it before the next (insurance) fire. - The College Inn and Al's Place are sure to disappoint. New arrivals, somewhat sadly, will never get a chance to visit the storied Rabbit's Lounge. But take heart, there's hundreds of other honky tonks out there. Let the Geek Speak 'roaming disposition.' At any rate, one rainy afternoon, as I was casually ambling across the lush . verdure of Union College, I chanced beyond an antidiluvian morass of quagmire and concrete · to the immediate left of the Security building. I was curious; blue smoke encircled his form, as might some wraith-like serpent . \Please go on,\ I said. \Ah yes. This 'lump of whatever' is destined to greatness as... and don't breathe this to a soul... 'Mr. Perkin's Lichen Patch!'\ Ah, the stories we ceuld tell. In San Francisco recently, some hard core drinkers organized the \A to Z Bar Tour.\ The object was to visit, in a rented bus with sober driver, a bar beginning with every letter of the alphabet. Surprisingly, there MTere more people on the bus after Z than • ••••••••••••• so much so, in fact, that I inter- rupted my mental exercise of \That's all well and good, wonderously big person, but my question is: why?\ I am a compulsive stroller by nature; perhaps the fact that I was born in the back of a Rambler lends some justification to my setting Cha.ucer to baroque par· lor music to gaze in wonderment at the muddy panorama that lay before me. \Gee I murmered. \Part of 'Concept 90.' See, the whole idea of it is to plant a veritable slew of lichen and reindeer grass around this area in 8.LM.S. Club Tak~ Off No sooner had I uttered that fateful syllable than a mountain- ous figure, clad in workman's overalls and a sloppy white sweater, emerged from the Admissions office, a lwge shovel grasped firmly in his left hand. Even by Rabelasian standards, he was truly an above-averagely- . the shape of a '9' and an '0. • That way, when prospective students fly over campus on their way to, let's say, Williams, they'll look out the window, see this huge '90' in the middle of nowhere, and be instantaneously intrigued. After that, it's only a matter of time before they apply to Union.\ With that, he drove his spade deep into the stagnant loam, and began to shovel. The first organizational meet· ing of the Students' International Meditation Society will be in Strauss Lounge on Thursday, October 6 at 7:30 p.m. We hope to plan activities such as our successful symposium on \The Ideal Human Being\ held la-st Spring. It is our desire to provide uplifting activities of interest to the whole college community. In addition, we will plan special dates to offer introd\lctory lectures and advanced lectures on the Transcendental Meditation program. For those who are meditators, there will be regularly scheduled group meditations (especially before mid-terms and fmals), and regularly schedUled personal checking dates on campus. On Wednesday, October 19 at 7:30 p.m. in SSOI6, we will be sponsoring a Medical Sym- posium with guest speaker, Dr. Steele Bellock, Researcher in Internal Medicine at Boston Medical Center.

I Page6 CONCORDIEJVSIS, October 5, i977 culture look for kicking room art6 Modern Dance Sees Repertory Ensembl~ by CLAIRE KENNEDY The first appearance of Alvin Ailey's Repertory Ensemble in Albany has marked the first venture of the Modern Dance Club. The ensemble is based in New York City and was brought to this area by the Albany League of Arts. The League's president, Eleanor Koblenz, described their purpose in the evening's presentation \to enhance Albany's artistic scene by bringing our community the best of what the rest of the country has to offer.\ The dancers seen by the club perlormed eight of Ailey's pieces. The first half included \Night Creature\ and \Myth.\ A y·oung and vibrant dancer, Marsha Clark, appeared during both, showing signs of great potential in dance. Although only a sixteen year old student at the New York High School of Performing Arts, Ms. Clark has a polished quality seen in very experienced dancers. Idol Breaks Year's Idleness The second half began with Ailey's classic, \Rev~lations initiating the earthen quality of a southern revivalist gathering. The tempo climaxed during the piece, \Take Me to the Water,\ when ensemble member Joe Alegado perlormed a stunning solo. His height and strength were set to his advantage, especially in his back falls where for that one moment he seemed to suspend the laws of gravity. The finale seemed to evoke greatest emotion. The audience by lAIN DRUMMOND Contrary to popular myth- ology, the Idol is not some icon beneath which student manu- scripts are burned as appeasement to the wrathful gods of literature nor is it an ancient Incan diety whose fervent followers carve out i.he hearts of magazine editors in the belief that in doing so they will transcend pulp fiction and learn proper placement of commas (although I might add that the martyr syndrome is not uncommon among editors). No; it is not even the polynesian status depicted by Gaugin in his cele~ brated painting \Who are we? Where are we? where are we going?\ These questions are, however, germaine to the issue at hand. The Idol is a student organiza- tion interested in the develop- TOMORROW Tomorrow lies in the rising sun And the fog over the purple hills Far, far away. As bright as fairy light and as near We collect our stardust dreams Until, one day the gold fades From daffodil smiles And cosmic plots On down the winding stair Growing starker, dimmer, bleaker - Light a glimmer in a far off morning Down to the dust of ages Where sleep is sunset soft. -Jan De Deka National Poetry Day is Ociober 15!

CONCORDIENSJS, October 5, 1977 Pagel Campus Theatre Group To Present Miller Play by UIANE Dl ·FRANCO A masterpiece of the American theater will be the production of the Union College Mountebanks this fall term. The Pulitzer-Prize winning play -written by Arthur· Miller, \Death of a Salesman\ will be staged in the N ott M:emor- i§ll Theater, to inaugurate the ·Mountebanks' new season .. As one of America's foremost dramatists, Arthur Miller has written such giants as \The Crucible\ and \After the Fall.\ But without a doubt, \Death of a Salesman\ is· considered by many critics to be his most monumental achievement. In fact, it is considered by many to be the most outstanding work of American drama. Applauded by both critics and the public at large, it captures the paradoxes and psyche of the American soul. the hopes and fears of Union College students as any work of art coul<l be. Night and The Tempest, this production will be perhaps his most challenging. Professor Charles Steckler will be .designing the stage. The co-stage managers for the production will be Patrick O'Connor and Margaret-Ann Maloney. This show offers a tremendous chance for anyone who w:arits to get involved in Union Theater and the Mountebanks. Crews are needed for all areas of produc- tion - lights, sound, props. set construction, photography, etc. If you're interested in helping out in box office or ushering, just sign up in the Nott Green Room. The talent and dedica-tion of the cast and crew promises to make \Death of a Salesman\ one of the biggest s~,~ccesses of Union rheater. It will be performed in the No._tt Memorial Theater Nov. Il-r3 and Nov. 16-19. culturt The Great Estate The play, in its most basic elefi!ents, concerns the life and death of one salesman, Willy Loman. But this drama is more than that - it shows the life and death of the American dream, as we all know it. Though written several yea~s- ago, it has lost none of the stark realism and power evident in its first performances. In the 1970's. it -is as relevant to The casting for the show includes some of the finest actors and actresses on the Union campus. Starring in the role of Willy Loman is George Siletzky, one of Union's leading ~fctors. Verna Lowe will be the lead female, as Willy Loman's long- suffering wife, Linda. Also starring will be John Rose as Biff Loman, Harry Rosen as Ben Loman, and Alex Shaefer as Happy Loman. The cast also includes Tom Farrell as Charley, Jack Stein as Bernard, and Jeff Morgenstern playing Howard Wagner. Ron Amirian is cast as Stanley. Several women new to Union's ·stage are also cast: Venita Hernandez as the Woman in the Hotel and Alicia Hollinger as 'Miss forsyte. Jamie Forton and Amy Kloner will be making their first appearances in the Nott as Letta and Jenny, respectively. The director, Barry K. Smith, wishes to thank the many Union students wfio auditioned for the play. As he said, \The decisions made were very difficult.\ After directing many of Union's most successful shows, as Twelfth Nightclub ~ks Revival Mime Trent Arteberry , Coffeehouse Lives How many times have we all heard about something that's new and improved? If you have been hearing this with respect to Coffeehouse lately, take notice. This time, it's true. Coffeehouse disappeared from Union's social scene last year as student interest 'waned in response to the constant presentation of· what.: has sometimes been called \vegetarian\ types of music. However, · the several new managers who have replaced the single student manager of the past two yeats · are promising an updated, revitalize<l organi- zatibn. In order to improve the atmosphere of Coffeehouse, several changes have been made. The decor is modelled after that of Saratoga's famous Cafe Lena. There will be waitresses to bring refr«shments to the tables. Exotic teas, Irish coffee, and various pastries will be served, in addition to the traditional coffee and donuts. All refreshments are included in the admission price. Believing that an atmosphere is worth very little without\ good music, the managers have been listening around campus for ideas on what will be presented. They are eager for student body partici- pation, whether in terms of musical. input, or ·help in presenting the show. Coffeehouse will present pianist Tom Serabian on Friday night, October 7 at 8:30 p.m. His music of the 30's and 40's and original ballads have deliglt-ted ,Cafe ... goers in many cities. Coffeehottse takes place in the Old · Chapel. Admission is $1.00 for all. For further information, ask 'for Julie Greifer or Michelle Mestichelli in Student Activjties. The Union College Social Committee will sponsor a night- club on Friday night, October 14 at 9 p.m. Because of the over- whelming success of the same endeavor last year and the resulting overcrowded conditions in the Old Chapel it has been planned to hold the affair this year in the Alumni Gym. The opening act will feature CP Seeks Volunteers The United Cerebral Palsv Association of the Capital Di;- trict will conduct its 6th Annual Walk.,.a-thon on Sunday, October 9, 1977. The 20-mile walk will begin at 8:30 a.m. at the Cerebral Palsy Center located at 314 S. Manning Boulevard in Albany and wind through the streets of Albany. This year schools are invited to compete for a spot on the C/P Telethon to be broadcast in February. The top schools represented at the walk will have a half-hour slot to showcase their talents working with professionals from Channel 10 and the C/P Center. In addition, prizes will be awarded to the top three individuals collecting the most pledges. Prospective walkers obtain a sponsor sheet from the·Center by calling 489-8336 or frc:im a local school. They then get as many sponsors as possible to pledge a specific amount ·for . each mile walked, as a dona,tion to Cerebral Palsy. Shortly after the completion of the walk, the walkers return · to his or her sponsors and collects the pledges. Many volunteers and commun- ity organizations .participate in • this program each year to feed the walk~rs, . provide emergency medical services (Red Cross) and man vehicles which will return \pooped out\ walkers to the Center.

A freezing rain had postponed the scheduled soccer match as all athletic fields on the Plattsburgh campus were submerged in ankle deep. water. lt appeared to be a day to stay in, sip cocoa. and enjoy a little T.V. - maybe even study! Well, when the Union Ruggers joined the home Plattsburgh club it was surprising that a fair amount of fans had decided to defy the elements and witness the spectacle... and it was quite a game they saw. The desire to win by both teams was unquestionable as the hitting and hustling displayed a relentless ferocity, k-eeping the spectators as well as the players unaware ofthe torment the weather was placing upon them. Union set the tempo for the game, filling the opening minutes with great pursuit and classic gang-tackling. It was with this technique that Union provided an equalizer for their obvious size disadvantage. Union held Plattsburgh in their defensive zone, often coming within feet of scoring, but had trouble breaking in to the endzone.

Handy· Boost UColl Over Williams by JIM MANNING This Thursday past the Union CoUege soccer team really stuck it to the Ephmen from Williams as they rallied back from a 3•1 deficit to go on to win 5-4 in one of the /most exCiting games on Daley Field since the days of Denio and Jeftries. Th:e Williams men came on the field amidst at least a mild controversy involving the con- dition of the rain-soaked Daley Field and the change of the date of the game. As these problems became secondary throughout the game, it was apparent that the only thing. Williams couldn't handle wa~. a full 90 minutes with the well-conditioned Union Men. The Union hooters dominated throughout, despite a few defensive lapses whicb Williams capitalized on. The score, however, actually misleads the layman into believing that Union lucked-out and squeaked by into the win. On the contrary, Union played their best and outran, out- tackled, outpassed, and of course out-classed the boys from the Berkshires. Pete Handy, who scored game winner vs. Ephmen Pete Martini, the 6-2 co-captain from Winchester, Mass. had probably the best day of his soccer career at Union College. Movec;l fr.otn fullba~k to forward for some scoring punch, he .pumped in the first 3 goals, the first hat trick scored by a Union booter since 1975. His aggressive style of play intimidated the Williams goalie throughout · the game. His first goal came on a penalty kick which he rocketed to the right ha11d corner of the net. His second goal came on a picture . perfect pass from left winger Peter Handy, who kicked a low line drive to Martini's left foot. The goalie dove, but to no avail, as Martini's shot was strategic- ally booted into the upper corner of the net. Keith Miller, moved back to halfback from his original wing positien, was quick to the ball all day long. His consistent, solid , tackling provided the team with more scoring opportunities and helped keep the pressure off the Junior Paul Marvin looksfor kicking room defensive backs.

Martini Gets. Hat Trick Soccer forward Peter Martini, a senior from Winchester, Mass., is this issue's athlete of the week. As a high school senior at Belmont Hills School near his hometown, Martini was attracted to Union College by its size, its academic reputation, · and its soccer program. \I wasn't recruited, though,\ said the tall booter when asked about Union. \They just sent me some admissions packet and wished me good luck.\ After one season on the J.V. squad, Martini was promoted as a fullback to the varsity team. Since then his own combination of aggressiveness, ex.uberance and talent have made him a fuJl .. time . At fullback, Martini played sound, competent defense, but the Ecoring opportunities were few and far between. When Coach Bob Magee, looking over his injury-depleted squad this season for some ex.tra aggressiveness on the front line, he looked no further than the 6-2 blonde fullback \I was a forward in high school, anyway,\ said Martini, \lmd it didn't matter to me where I played so long as the team won.\ And so was made a switch that all Schenectady-base<! Williams- boaters will forever cherish. \We hadn't beaten Williams in two years,\ said Martini, \so I everybody was psyched-up.\ Peter Martini) athlete of the week The result of the Martini switch was that the veteran co-captain connected early for three goals, and Union defeated the arch-rival Ephmen 5-3. It was the first hat trick for a Dutchmen boater since the fall of 1975, and some noted observers called it one of the best performances they'd ever seen. \He went wild. I've never seen him play better,\ said injured co- captain Jim Manning who has played alongside him for three years. · When asked how he trains for soccer, the industrial economics major responded jokingly, \Oh I listen to •Rocky' and do a few pushups.\ When pressed on this point, however, he admitted to a full schedule of summ,er soccer .and a training program~ The first of feter Martini's three goals WomenS Volleyball The Union College Women's Volleyball team opened up their ' season on October i in a Quad match against Russell Sage, Potsdam, and Clarkson Colleges. Although theSpikettsfell short on many fronts by losing to all three _ schools, it should be noted that even · in losses there are many good plays. Firstly, it should be noted that , every school the Union girls played had already been into their I second week of competition. This 1 factor amongst a few others (such . as first match jitters) contributed I • . to the Uruon loss against Potsdam. Union dropped the first game of the match S-15 with \Gaz\ scoring 4 out of the S points. In a hard fought second game, Union College Gamet ladies dropped the second and match game 12.,15 with Cathy Reals and Liz IYiager accounting for 8 out of the I 2 points. Potsdam was a very hard hitting team that showed their experience in almost every way. After a little break in between, our ladies locked · 1 horns against Clarkson College. In general, this was the best team effort put· out. The Spiketts ripped Clarkson in a well. played 16-14 game, with Shetla O'Donell and Cathy Reals topping for 8 out of the 16 points. But to no avail; the Garnet ladies dropped the nex.t two games, thus dr-opping the record to 0-2. In their fifth hour of play the ~pikett.s were off to battle long ttme nvals - \Russell's Cage.\ Sage being the all-around Amalons that they are, gave Union a hard time at the net. All in all, Union started their season witb v.erv stiff ,comoetition. They did show excellent ball playing at times. But we are looking forward to a better record, and more distantly, the Divisional Tournament.

The touchdown came on a 12 yard pass from quarterback Art Hughes to Brian McC~rthy with 2:48 left in the half.

The Dutchmen defense began to tighten and appeared to be out of trouble as they forced the Engineers into a fourth and thirteen from the 28. WPI, however, successfully executed a middle screen down to the Union 15 where a measurement gave the Engineers a first down. Five plays later running back Mike Robinson dove off-tackle for the game's first score. The extra point Union wasted little time. however, in closing the gap as they took the second half kickoff on their own 34 and drove 66 yards for the score.

The Engineers, however, got the. ball right back as a Terranova .pass was intercepted by John Sansouci at the Dutchmen 37. He returned it to the 25 where Hughes, 9-19, l 12 yards and two interceptions, spotted Paul Fearnside with a six yard TD pass to begin the fourth quarter. The PAT was successful giving WPI a 20-7 lead. Union's big break came with only 6:23 to play, when middle linebacker Ed Elinski picked off a pass at the W PI 25. The interception was the second of the day for the Dutchmen as freshman safety Dave Wilbur had picked one off during the previous WPl possession. On a third and four, Terranova 12-28, I l3 yards, and two i11terceptions, eluded two tacklers and somehow found Romer in the end ~one with a 19 yard scoring strike.

Dr. Smith's letter (Concordiensis 10-5-77) was Jllost critical of President Bonner. It eX:pressed Smith's feelings of being offended by the events of the past year and alleged improprieties as well non- professional actions all attributed to the President. The official news release indicated that \Smith had been involved in controversies last spring, had· been the subject of a review. and had been expected to leave the cdllege at the end of the coming school year. President Bonner had indicated earlier that he had lost confidence in Smith's capability to 'function effectively as Dean ... \ The result .of these ~ actions was the firing of Dean Smith effective last Thursday, the sixth of October. Assistant Professor of Psychology Rudy V. Nydegger was appointed Thursday afternoon as acting Dean of Students. Dean Nydegger had attended Wichita State University where he earned his B.A. as well as his M.A. He also he>l(ls a Ph.D. from Washington University of St. Louis, Missouri. Dean Nydegger has .been a member of the Psychology Department of Union College since 1976 and had previously been clinical Assistant Professor of Psychology at the Baylor College of Medicine. The bean has acted as Child Psychologist at the Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Clinic of the Texas Children's Hospital in Houston. Texas.

Dr. Bonner stated that the use of small. group meetings with certain rnembers of the campus would occur in the neal' futQre SQ that he could explain his .concepts and ideas for the future of the college in the 1980's.

The meeting, scheduled to be held in SS II$, was moved to the Old Chapel d'ue to the overflow crowd. More titan ZOO angered students attended the rather emotional meetin.g. Michael Ganz, President of the Student Forum. ran the meeting, aided by Student Trustees Andy Koblenz and Brian O'Toole, and two Forum members, Joanne Messina and todd Miller. ·Before the meeting began, each student .entering the meeting was handed a five page open statement from the Student Forum. The statement entitled \The Long train of Abuses or. Lies My President Told Me,\ proposed that Union students rally together in order to force a Pte~idential Review. The meeting opened with a request by the Forum for students to write letters to the \trustees expressing. students' feelings concerning the changes that have taken place here. The Forum questioned the overall effect the events of the past yea:r ·will have on the future of Union College. One freshman asked ''What will my Union degree be worth, if anything, when I graduate four '. years from now?\ The. meeting was opened for discussion. One of the first topics that was brought up was the allegations made by former Dean Mark Smith. Students questioned exactly. what specific accusations are being made. One group of students · reiterated again and again that they felt that no action of an;y kind ·by any students should be taken until Dean Smith offers some sort of proof to verify and specify the accusations referred to in his controversial letter of last week. The general · response from the re&t !>f the students in attendance was that President Bonner has had time enough. over six months, to respond to allegati<ms made against him. The students seemed to agree with the paragraph in the statement that · was handed out which readj \the allegations contained in Dean Smith's letter of last week make perfect sense fn the context of the patterns of 'Eionner's presidency.\ Members ·of the PAB present at the forum meeting told the gathering of students that President Bonner had promised the PAB on Monday that he will respond to Smith'.s charges. Other topics discussed were President JJonner's ideas of creating a \Faculty CouncW' to replace the All College Senate and his changing the vacated position of Provost to a Vice- President in charge of Finance and Administration. A position of Vice-President in charge of Academics is also being considered. The basic question that arose at the meeting was whether or not Dr, Bonner is an asset to Union College. A majority of tlte students present feel he is a hindrance and that Union will not go forward until he is replaced. The only resolution passed was an agreement that the major drawback concerlting students taking organized action at the present time is that many students temaitl uninformed of the problems that exist and their severity. The resolution called for a week .of intensified education of all students on campus as to the situation and a massive letter Co11tinued on Page 7 Michael Ganz conducts Forum meeting

The meeting pointed out that more information needs to be distributed to all the students regarding the allegations against Dr. Bonner, and the types of action that can be taken to ose both the College's present and future - the Trustees of Union College. Regardin,g information, students can read Coneordy. listen to WRUC, talk to student leaders, Q-r students present at the Forum meeting. However, the thrust of this letter concerns what we, as students, can do to expr~~ . our views to the Trustees. No matter what your opinion on the Bonner matter is - whether you feel he is being unjustly accused, that • review of his Administration ia in order, or that llonne.r m.u~ leave to save Union. there are two very effective ways of expressing your views: (t)Write to the truatees of ~. sebool~ Their addresses can b¢ found in· the Union· College ·Catalogue, beginnina -on page 169. Give a copy of your ·. letter to our student trustees - Andy Koblenz or ·Brian O'Toole. (2.} An even more effective way of persuading the Trustees is to have your parents write to them. Why? Our parents are a fundamental sourceof financial support for this College. Even if tOO parents wrote to the Trustees indicating that due to the present controversy, they wiU not contribute one penny to Union other than their child's tuition, the Trustees will listen. Trustees listen when money talks. They support Dr .. Bonner because of his success in raising funds for this College. However, if the Trustees realize that Dr. Bonner is hurting Union financially because he is ·tarnishing Union's image outside the iron gates, then the trustees will be forced to do something. Remember, we are the future of Union College, as wen as the present. Together, we have a voice because Union Will be turning to us for contributions once we leave beautiful Schenectady.

Phjladelphia, Pa. 19107 Dear Mr. Fortenbaugh, t/o Editor, Coneordy: I write this letter as an individual that is disgusted with the turmoil that has existed on the Union campus this past year. I feel that I am qualified to comment on this situation as I have been deeply involved at Union extra-curri- cularly. I have been Editor of tbe Freshman Ree«Jrtl, Chairman of the Film Com~nittee. member of the · Orientation Committee and . presently a Resident Advisor. My contact with students has. allowed me to hear their op1mons. Most are ·as disturbed as I. The morale of this campus is dismal. For a healthy campus environment to return to Union it is essential that the deception and lies that have run rampant must stop. We cannot forget the problems of last year until we get the answers this year. This past year has seen a larger attrition rate of students than previous years. We also lost many fine administrators, and the task of replacing them to say the least will be difficult. 1 do not know of many individuals that would want to enter a situation where turmoil and controversy appear to be everyday occurrences. There is no further need to elicit other situations as both you and I are aware of them. My only request is that you as Chairman of the Board fulfill the request Thomas Bonner made three years ago; a Presidential Review. I think · this would be a most appropriate time to have the allegations made by Mark Smith explained in detail with a comprehensive answer by President Bonner to follow. My years at Union have . meant a great deal to me. I . have much pride in Union and the edu~ation 1 have received, but l want to retain this pride ~wenty years from now. I feel the events that occur in the next few months will ' determine its future. The time for action is now. Again, I urge an expedient review of tbe President. 1 do not want to leave Union at tbe end of this · year with the disgruntled ·feelings I have now. Respectfully yours, Mkbael R. Marks '78 Time to Resign De•r Pres. Bunner: e/o Editor, Concordy: I fed compelled to write this letter to YPll expressing my feelings about your impact at Union College. and how it has affected me. I submit this letter to Coneordlensis knowing the views about to be expressed (although my own) are shared by many students on this campus. · When I entered Union in Sept. 1975 as a freshman, and through much of my . sophomore year, I was very trmeh \into'\ college life. I ''tiecame involved in different JltOUDs and committees. I had with big bold letters spelling .out UNION, I visited local high schools in my area over the winter rece1Js to talk and an5wer questions about Union; I even tried to revitalize the .. dead\ alumni club in my home town by helping to organize a joint student~ alumni program. In short. I was interested. involved. and most important, 1 really felt special about being a member of the Union College student body. Now, as . a junior, J still consider myself involved and interested, but no longer do I possess that special feeling; no · longer can l be honest to myself and at the same time say. ••rm proud of Union.\ As a gatesman, I find my position particularly problematic. How can I honestly convince higfi school seniors to come to Union when ali the information l am privy to makes me want to tell them just the opposite? How can I serve as a .. goodwill ambassador\ when my own opinion of Union has deteriorated tremendously over the past year? When asked on WRUC during Monday's interview why you persist in remaining as president in light of the facts that an overwhelming majority of faculty voted no- confidence in you, the consistent expression of student leaders that you are leading this college down the path of moral decadence. and your impoundment of the administration's vote of oonfidence, you responded by saying that the mission charged to you by the Board of Trustees bas not yet been completed. What mission. Dr. Bonner, could be so impt>rtant as to completely disregard, and in faet, alienate a majority of tbe campus community1 If your main function is public relations and fund raising. you should be working for Exxon or the UJ.A., not Union Colle~. Our chief executive must first and foremost be a man committed to quality education and academic integrity, with tasks such as P.R. and fund-raising fulfilling no more than a Se(;ondary role. Pres. Bonner, your actions over the past months have disgraced Union College, and have caused students here to seriously consider whether they should remain. I hope that for the good of the entire campus community, you will decide to resign. Gary Philipson. '79 Disturbed To the students of Union Coll- ege: c/o The Editor.: After witnessing student reactions at the forum meeting on Monday, October 10, we think that it is quitt: obvious that a significant portion of the .>tudent body 1~ highly dhturbed about the affairs of the Administration of Union Co! lege specifically those of Thomas Bonner and his Presidenttal leadership qualities, rhe meeting pointed out that more information needs to be distributed to all the students regarding the allegations against Dr. Bonner, and the types of a(;tion that can be tak~n to inform those both the College's present and future - the Trustees of Union College. Regarding information, students can read Concordy, listen to WRUC, talk to student leader~, or students present at the Forum meeting. However, the thrust of this Jetter concerns what we, as students, can do to ex.press our views to the Trustees. No matter what your opinion on the Bonner ltlatter is - whether you feel he is being unjustly accused .. that 1 review of his Admini$tration is in order, or that Bonner mast leave to save Union, there ue two very effective ways <Jf expressing your views: (L)Write to the trustees of this school. Their addresses can be found in the Union College Catalogue, beginning on page 169. Give a copy of your letter to our student trustees - Andy Koblenz or Brian O'Toole. {2.) An even more effective way of persuading the Trustees is to have your parents write to them. Why7 Our parents are a fundamental source of financial support for this College. Even if 100 parents wrote to the Trustees indicating that due to the present controversy, they will not contribute one penny to Union other than their child's tuition, the Trustees will listen. Trustees listen when money talks. They sUp}J'ort Dr. Bonner because of his success in raising funds for this College. However,. if the Trustees realize that Or. Bonner is hurting Union financially because he i$ ·tarnishing Union's image outside the iron gates, then the Trustees will be fGrced to do something. Remember, we are the future of Union College, as well as the present. Together~ we have a voice because Union will be turning to us for contributions once we leave beautiful Schenectady. We ean control purse strings. Therefore, educate yourselves and edW!at~ you pare.nts.. Write to the Trustees! Sincerely, Rob~rt Lurie '78 Karen Silverstem '79 Common Values To Union College: c/o the Editor: We are all members of an order of which 1 personally am very fond. Its designation is Union College. Its members are all those who care about it, those to whom I address this letter. We are an order which is indeed more than an association. a community, or a society. We are an order as a result of our commonly lleld values concerni,h.g both scholarship and moral integrity. We have imposed, upon ourselves, many obligatiom for the purpose of assisting u~ m best reaclling these ~:ommon guals. Our quest ~~ not an t!asy one and no um among u~ could accompli!.h 1t lull; without the rest ul the community contributing It is in the mutual pursu.it of our objectives that we gain the rectitude and solidarity that hopefully makes each of us proud to be members of this order.

I have written an~i re~written it three umes in the last eight days. Everyday somethins new, be it a letter, a rndio show, or a meeting. surfaces ~nd gives one a slightly altered pel'$pective toward exactly what is going on at th~ College these ~~ . - In the past eight days, Dean of Students Mark W. Smtth _was fired, President Bonner appeared on WRUC to answer questions frotn the .. masses,\ and· a. substantial.percentage of the masses held a speci;tl Student Forum meeting. One ma,y be bewildered about what this ail .means, but at least one thing is manifest ··- the campus is on« again electric with the feeling of tensi<m, chaos, worry and uncert~inty which was present during most of l;,tst yeaL These three separate but obviously interrelated events are very · interestirtg when one really considers lheir implications. To initiate · the action Dr. Smith issued a letter full of accusations and vague allegati~n~ concerning the actions of the president. The president responded by \relieving\ Smith of his official dutie!> three_ days later: Smit·h, relieved. in every sense of the word, has claimed that he can and will substantiate all ef his charges against Dr. Bonner. Dr. Bonner countered by offering himself to WRUC for a campus wide question-and-answer session. The reason he _gave for doing on the air was that he wanted to keep the campus mformed . about his actions and motives. (Parenthetically, one wonders why, if this is really the case, the president no longer writes a weekly column in Concordy?) _ _ . _ _ Employing the warfare terminology w~1ch rs presently prevalent on campus, one can label the WRUC \skrrmish\ as, at best,~ draw as far as the president is concerned. Due to several co_ntradlctlons . and a great deal of obfuscation on Dr._ Bon':ler's part, 1! 1s hard to say what the net \outcome\ of the mtervrew was. Cym~s were sardonically amused, naive students were bewildered, and smcerely .interested students were either outraged or merely upse~. . On Monday night, 300 students filled Old Chape~ lor a meetmg of the Student Forum. Once again, in this grimy httle wa~ where · small gains are all important, the ne_t outcome of the meetmg was . Indefinite. The assembly was successful m s1mple terms of turn-out and generation of valuable discussion. However, near the_ end tt degenerated at points into mere shouting matches an_d, ult1mately, no clear consensus was anived at except for the sent1rnent that no clear consensus could be arrived at unt-il most stu~ents had more time to become better informed on the questions facmg them. · So now, in retrospect, I've tried to int~rpret what has o~urred and, by doing so, come to terms with :-\hat _1 perceiV~ as be~ng the current state of Union. Arguments deahng w1th rnn,rahty, ethtcs and intelligence are endless and subjective. and the difference between accusation and evidence (and, in fact, the need for one or the other) is veiled by 1:he necessary confidentiality of certain documents and sources of information. _ . _ Therefore, the only course of argumentatiOn wh1ch can hear val1d. conclusions is one which addresses the Simple questions of what exactly has happened and what can be expected to happen m the future. Given certain conditions such as the large numher . of ~acancies in important administr.1tive positions and the pervastve air of mistrust. and tension currently covenng the school, I have finally reached the [allowing considerations_: . . . 1) Will any talented, innovative admmistrator he w1lhng . to acc~pt a position in such an uneasy envmmiTlent as the one whtch now exists at Union? . __ 2) Can any faculty members tolerate working ~~ a sttflrng situation where inteilectual innovation and freedom ol thought are occupati·onally hazardous? . . . J) Can any student, trying to learn m surroundmgs whKh arc not conducive to that end, justify paymg $.,0.000 for a d1ploma which may be, five years from now, as valu~ble as a $3 bill? And as a corollary to this consideration, can th1s type nf envnonment continue to attract iptelligent and curious new students? These questions may not be the end-all in discussion of current campus turmoil, but consider them well all the same, f?r the futures of both Union and of each person workmg or learmng at Umon ate, I think, contained within the answers. Union Divided by DAVID SCHMERTZ . . In recent days, student sentiment calling for the restgnatwn of Dt. Thomas Bonner as College President has heightened to the point of emotional irrationality. No doubt, the time has come for l)r. Bonner to contemplate his resignation as President. _Though Dr. Bonner's objectives have always been controversial; and complex.. there is little question that he believed them to be 10 t~e best interests of the College. Nonetheless, he led the College m directions counter to its prior tradition and, as a result, has met considerable opposition. Whether his goals were right or wrong is unimportant at this stage in the College's development. The College, I believe, is hopelessly di~ided and must seek a new and fresh direction. Unfortunately, Umon College has been woun~ed ... wounded by disunity and bitterness. Justly or unjust!~, there hes an. indelible strain upon the President's office, one whtch cannot be removed by time. The students, administration, faculty and trus:e~s are forever pre-occupied with controvers.y, when thetr concentration should instead be upon the workmgs of the college and its educational development. So long as t~e co_llege c?mmunrty is torn and distrustful, that fresh, new dtrecuon wdl he an impossibility. _ . , The increasing desire of the student body to request D_r. Bonners resignation is a conviction which lraglcally_ holds ment. But the student effort must be a responsible and cautwus one, and must not give way to emotion and irrationality. for the reputatiOn o~ ~mon · College is at stake. The ramificatiOns of harmful publicity or hurried administrative disintegration will be devastatmg. . . J( the College is once again to move in a progrc~sive. direction, Dr. Bonner must eventually resign his pos1tion as Pres1dent. But the students must take care. not to force that tcs1gnalion wtth emotionalism which will only serve to damage the C()llege as a whole.

But in order to do this let's take a look at what \state\' Union College is in, is in, particularly in reference to student rerspective. A sizeable group of students came together Monday night at a Student Forum meeting to express different idea1> ab()Ut what we, as students, should do concerning the tenability of Tom Bonner as President. Out of this meeting came obvious conclusions; that the students participating are divided as to what we want to see happen, that we ate divided as ~0 what we want to do and that, most importantly, a majority of the campus does not know wh~t the turmoil is about - but tf they did, they would also have important opinions to express.

A third possible objective might be to call for . tl:ie resignation of the prem;lent (effective immediately or at tile end of the year) based on tile conclusion that Union College and its distinct parts can rt() I~nger perform its functions, because of its .president. These are the issues that must be raised when students talk with other students. · A consensus will emerge that provides a position th~t all students can unite around. It is from these objectives our unified effort as .a cohesive student community shou1d be made against selected targets we want to move. Organize! Fot a better Union Community.

Though this is only · my freshman year. 1 feel that it is impo-rtant to become involve-d from the early stages.·· of my education here at Union. Iii the past weeks, my knowledge has been exposed to soine annoying faets atmut , the._ 11dministrative pro~ses.:. · whlch gov-ern this institution., , With the recent dismissal of· Mark Smith and the posiU'<>n · of P:r-ovost being vacated shortly. l a.tn led to wonder why is this huge shift in administrators taking place. By past evidences. l am clearly convine<Jd that President Bonner sliould take these respon-sit>ilities into his present thoughts. I see a nee<! for immediate and thoughtful · responses .to these problems. There seems to be no consistency in the decisions made by D:r. Bonner on various matters. I arn now aware that in the spring of this year, an admissions code (in ' .. turn ~ University code) was violated by the present director of admissions. For this action he received no reprimand, but a contract renewal. Yet after Dean ; Smith's recent letter to President Bonner expressing sincere emotions about current_ as well as past administrative principles;. Mark Smith Wa$ out of a job. ln a greater ligtlt,. aft$r physj(:al tb~ats by MlKE ROTONDI fhis is an opinion. concerning the present and the immediate future of Union College. I have written and re-written it three times in the last eight days. Everyday something new, be it a letter, a iadio sh1>w, or a meeting, surfaces and gives one a slightly altered perspective toward exactly what is going on at the College these days. . In the past eight days, Dean of Students Mark W. Sm1th .was fired, President Bonner appeared on WRUC to answer questwns from the ••masses, .. and a substantial percentage of the masses held a special Student Forum meeting. One may be bewildered about what this all means, but at least one thing is manifest - the campus is once again electric with the feeling of tension, chaos, worry and uncertainty which was present during most of last year. These three separate but obviously interrelated events are very interesting when one really considers their implications. To initiate the action, Dr. Smith issued a letter full of accusations and vague aJiegations concerning the actions of the president. The president responded by .. relieving\ Smith of his official duties t~ree days later. Smith, relieved in every sense of the word, has da1med that he can and will substantiate all of his charges against Dr. Bonner. Dr. Bonner countefed by offering himself to WR UC for a campus wide question-and-answer session. The reason he gave for doing on the air was that he wanted to keep the campus mformed about his actions and motives. (Parenthetically, one wonders why, if this is really the case, the president no longer writes a weekly column in Concordy?) . . Employing the warfare terminology whtch ts pfesently prevalent on campus, one can label the WRUC \skirmtsh\ as, at best ~ d.ra\o\: as far as the president is concerned. Due to several co.nt:adtctwns and a great deal of obfuscation on Dr. Bonner's part, II ts. hard to say wlut the net \outcome\ of the intervieY\ was.

So now, in retrospect, I've tried to interpret wh~t has o~urred and. by doing so, come to terms with :-vhat .1 percetv~ as be!ng the current state of Union. Arguments deahng wtth m~rahty, ethics and intelligence are endless and subjective, and the dtfference between accusaticm and evidence (and, in fact, the need for one or the otherl is veiled by the necessary confidentiality of certam documents and sources 1>f information. . Therefore. the only course of argumentation which c~n bear vahd conclusions is one which addresses the simple questiOns of what exactly has happened and what can be expected to happen m the future. Given certain conditions such as the large number .of vacancies in important administrative positions and the pervastve air of mistrust and tension currently covenng the school. I have finally reached the following consi?erations.: . . . 1) Will any talented, inn.ovattve ad~tmstrator be wtllmg . to accept a position in such an uneasy environment as the one whtch now exists at Union? . . .. 2) Can any faculty members tolerate workmg m a suflmg situation where intellectual innovation and freedom of thought are occupationally hazardous? . . . 3) Can any student, trying to learn m surroundmgs wh1ch are not conducive to that end, justify paying $30,000 for a dtploma which may be, five years from now. as valu~ble as a $3 bill? And as a corollary to thi~ co~sideration, ~an this type or.,envlronment continue to attract mtelllgent and cunous new students. These questions may not be the end-all in discussion of current campus turmoil, but consider them well all. the same, f?r the futures of bGth Union and of each person workmg or learnmg at Umon are, 1 think, contained within the ansv.ers. Union Divided by DAVID SCHMERTZ. . . In recent days, student sentiment c~lling for th~ restgnatton of Dr. Thomas Bonner as College President has heightened to the point of emotional irrationality. No doubt, the time has come for Dr. Bonner to contemplate his resignation as President .. Though Dr. Bonner's objectives have always been controversial. and complex. there is little question that he believed them to be m t~e best interests of the College. Nonetheless. he led the College m directions counter to its prior tradition and, as a result, has m~t considerable opposition. Whether his goals were right or wrong 1~ unimportant at this stage in the College's development. The College, I believe, is hopelessly divided and must seek a new and fresh direction. Unfortunately, Union College has been wounded ... wounded by disunity and bitterness. Justly or unjustly, there lies an indelible strain upon the President's office, one whtch cannot be removed by time. The students, administration, faculty and truste~s are forever pre-occupied with controversy. when thetr concentration should instead be upon the workmg!'. of the college and its educational development. So long as the co.llege c?mmumty is torn and distrustful, that fresh, new dtrectwn w1ll he an impossibility. . The increasing desire of the student body to reque~t D.r. Bonner~ resignation is a conviction which tragically holds ment But the student effort must be a responsible and cauttous one, and must not give way to emotion and irrationality, for the reputation o~ ~mnn College is at stake. The ramifications of harmlul pubhc1ty or hurried administrative disintegration will be devastattn~. . . If tbe College is once again to move in a progresstve. dtrect1on. Dr. Bonner must eventually resign his position as ~restd.ent. But the students must take care not to force that tes1gnatton wtth emotionalism which will only serve to damage the College as a whole. ~ • • \ \ -· \. ~ I. \ .. , .,. ~ , ~ ~ 0 ,., ~\' , ... • .. ._ 'I\ '· ~ \' •• ' \' ·' ~

In his report to the committee, Or. Bonner announced that Provost Enteman would be leaving to dSsume his role as President of Bowdoin early in January. He expressed no desire to rush into the establishment of a search committee to fill this post. The reasoning behind the delay is to give the administration sufficient time to reassess and possibly redefine the office of the Provost. A-lso discussed was the dismissal of the Dean of Students. The President was strongly advised by the Board to respond · to the accusations contained in the Smith letter, noting that his silence might be ttiiscoilstrued by students as an admtssion of guilt. . . - E p c is to· m· ake th. t.

Otherwise, I really didn't know what was going to happen. My expectation when I went in was that the President had taken action of some sort and was soliciting faculty input regarding the decisi9n. I didn~t know what it was about but just assumed that•s what was happening. I certainly had no indication or expectation of the position being offered. to me. Q: When Was the first time you actually spoke with Dt. Bonner? A: rve only been OJJ; campu, since January and I ·speni most of the last two terms just trying. to get my feet on the ground in terms of my classes and getting my family moved up and I reaUy' hadn't met many people outside of my department ...until recently. Dr. Bonner and I had never . formally met until the evening <)f Carl Bernstein's lecture at the reception at the President's' house although we had nodded on campus on occasion. Q: What was your reaction to the firing of Dean Smith? was that was wliat th·e Pr:esident was doing and felt important for him to do regarding the situation with the Dean of Students. My personal feelings about ·· the decision to .have Mark leave are hard to discuss as I didn't know Mark well and had just met him socially, thus limiting our relationship. My coneern at the ·time was that the situation was so important · and so vital to the ongoing functions oil campus that something be done immediately to get and keep things func:.. tioning over there and tl;tat some qare be taken to find someone to be a permanent replacement for Dean Smith that would be an absolutely top flight per$on. Again, it's hard for me to respond to the question in regard to my feelings ab«>ut Mark as I just wasn't · that familiar with the situation. I responded more in response to the needs of the college rather than to the specific · situation. Q: What was your reaction to 1 the- Smith letter'! A: I read the letter and again rm not really sure how to react. My first feelina is that the letter~ had I ~en in the position of having thotoe opinions, should have been addressed directly fll'!it, and I'm not saying that thty weren't.

CONCORDIENSIS. Oetober 12, 1977 Page7 Acting. Dean of Students A: 1 certainly hope so. ion-making aspects ·of the campus. l had · come from a college where those things were given Httle more than lip service· and that was one of the reasons I didn't like where 1 was. I thin·lc that the ,governance structure as it exists right now is an important representation of the need fQr input from the variety of elements on the campus. The fact is that a college or universi~y exists for the students, number one, and the business of a college or university is. primarily teaching, research and scholady activities. The joh of an administn~tkm is to make it possible for students and faculty to be able to carry those things on. 1 feel very strongly about th:tt and in tenus .of the specifics of the governance structure ifs ·difficult for me to com~ent upon thc;:m not knowing the particul~r struc- ture itself hut certainly my commitment is to maximum involvement for everyone as we rec:~lly are a community. I have no intention ·Of seeing it .any other way. Regarding the ho~;key issue; again, I came from a school that has 2300 js th¢ smallest school in the: country to .play Division I football and the only small school in the country to play four or more Division I sports. lt is a school that has now done aw!lY with special admis- sions for athletes, largely by virtue of the input of a lot of people, myself being one. I enjoy athletics, I enjoy watching them, I enjoy participating i11 thetn and I· think they have. a to'le on a campus, ~ntratnurals I include in the whole package, l'rn not tal~ing about inter~collegiate, l'm talking about athletics in general. On the other hand, 1 certainly for one ~on't want to see it become a disproportionate part of any place. I think the implication§ are very clear that faculty and student opinion is important regarding these kinds of matters and l see· conc~ns that Union's image as a firie quality, well-rounded institu- Everyone that 1 have talked to from the President on down wants these things resolved and wants to get back to business as usuaL Whether or not they will be resolved I certainly can't p.redict, but J, hope so. I think there ate enough of us, those of us irt tile administration, the students and the faculty, that are concerned. that things .get hack to normal, so th.at hopefully we can get these- . things resolved ami get things .. tion not be tampered with to any significant extent. Q:: Do you foresee the carr.ent issues on campus coming to a dose\! flowing smoothly again. Q: We have hear.d that you wiU probably be the next department chairman of Psychology. Is this true or just rumor? A: That decision has not been made. I was recruited certainly with the understanding that l would be a candidate for that positiol1. I think it's safe to say that if the depaftment chairman- ship opens up in the near future as the expectations are, I will be a principal candidate for it, no question about that. Q: If you were offered the job of Dean of Students permanent~ ly, would yoU accept'? A: At this point in time simply cannot answer that. 'I told .. Pteifdent Bonner that l would accept the position as Acting Dean of Students with the under- standing that l would not necessarily submit my applica- tion to be considered for the;: position. the reason I can't answer that, and I hate to hedge, is because I really have to get my feet wet,. I have to see what's i,nvolved, I have to see if I think .1 can do it although I think I certainly .can fulfill the position as Acting Dean of Students. As soon as I get into things I'll have a much · better feel for that. Obviously that decision <;m my part as to whether or. not to submit an application will have to b~ ·made in the reasonably near · future. l' .. Q: What do you think DT. Bonne:C can do to close the wide gaps now separating him from students, . faculty and various administration members? A: 1 don't have any ideas about specific steps that he will take but I ha:ve talked with him about these issues and. he is concerned that these gaps be closed and he communicates to me hts willingness t:o be open to all segments of the campus commun- ity in order to undertake this. Exaetly what he will do 1 can't say because he has not specifi- cally told~me that although he is aware of the concerns among people on the campus and I think feels the need to respond in some way. Q: What has the Faculty reaction been to the firing of Dean Smith and to your appointment as Acting Dean of Students'! here for the same kind of goals and hopefully we can see some uniting of effort. Anyway, the fact that the faculty people I've talked to have been very supportive cer- tainly makes me feel better about having accepted the position. Q: Do you have any further comments to make? A: Well, the only comments really have to make are that I do want to be accessible to students on as an informal a basis as I can be. 1 ask people to keep me informed and to let me know thmgs I need to know. I'm not going to be working any kind of magic but I will try hard, thafs one thing I can pr-omise ifnd I~m going to need a lot of help from a lot of different people and I'm not going to be hesitant to ask for it. I'll try to be responsive to the A: I haven't heard all that students' needs as immediately as many responses to Dean Smith's I can be and will be. calling on leaving.

The first three weeks in October are the peak weeks in the autumn color change in Vermont. If yo11 have never seen this phenomena of nature, you haven't experienced nature. in its most beautiful form. The mountains seem te come alive with flatning leaves that literally dance in the· sunlight. As one drives through the Green Mountains, be is arforded spectacular views of valleys and mountains in their yearly metamorphosis that has False Alarms Cause Lost Sleep · capture<i artists, writers · and philosophers since this area has been inhabited. by JIM DAVIS Many Union students have had reason to become heated up over the rash of early morning dormitory fire alarms that have awakened and sent many of them outside into the pre-dawn chill only to find that ·there is no fire and that they have been needlessly aroused. Most of these false alarms have been triggered by the recently installed smoke detectors, according to Cliff Wood, Director of Security. \I can understand the students' anxiety,\ said Mr. Wood, who was the Schenectady Police Department's Chief of Detectives before assuming his post here three years ago. He said, .. The new qetectors are very sensitive. If they find any foreign substance in the air, they go off. But this is. unavoidable and representatives of Honeywell, the company that installed the system at a cost of .nearly $25,000, will .remain on campus until all the problems are ironed out.\ Still, under present conditions, the detectors which will auto- matically activate the alarms can and have been set off by steam escaping from showers and the smoke prOduced by students who cook in their rooms. •• And I'm starting to get a little tired of it,\ said Curt Moulton9 a freshman living on third fioot West. .. It's like the little boy cried wolf - after a while people just won't bother to get out of bed when they hear a fire alarm!' .. The system's stiD got some hitches in it,\ Mr. Wood said. .. We Want the detectors to be sensitive. They have to be if they'R: going to save people's lives. But we don't want them going off every ten minutes.'' Each time the alanns are triggered, either by the smoke detection system or by an individual pulling one of the caD boxes located on each floor of every dormitory, it is necessary for someone to phone .the security and safety department. At least two of the staff of twelve .full-time campus police officers will respond io such a call. Upon reaching the dorm; one of .the officers will stand by the building's enunciator board, located in the ground floor foyer. These boards indicate on which floor the fire alarm has been sounded. Additional officers will go up to the floor on which the frre wa11 reported, along with the per.so~ who saw the blaze. If there ts a fire, the officets will attempt to extinguish it, or, if it is af sufficient magnitude, they will contact the Schenectady Fire Department, which will respond rapidly. The current detection system that requires campus police officers to be C'ontacted by phone will saon be improved according to Mr. Wood. ••Right now, offi<;:ers can respond to calls in a matter of seconds,'' he s~id. \But there'~ still a delay in waiting for someone to report the fire.\ To cut down on this wasted time, a campus-wide central fire alarm system is being installed. The system, which is scheduled to be completed early in 1978, has been installed over a three•year period at a cost of approximately $150,000. 1 •It's a complex. system,\ Mr. Wood said, \And we want to make sure evetything works correctly.\ . The computer-controUed system is sophisticated. When placed in ,operation, alarms will be in every publi<f:~nd private buUding on campus, Each of these alarms is connected to an automatic read-out board, so that any time an alarm is sounded, a light will be activated on the board. One of the campus police officers will monitor the board 24 hours a day. ••This person will be completely isolated,\ Mr. Wood said. \Even the other officers won't be able to talk to him. The r~d-out will tell the officer on duty the exact location of the alarm, so he'll be able to immediately send over other officers to investigate.\ Installation of the central alarm system is part of a continuous program of improvements in Union security. \But right now our fire detection system exceeds the minianum regulations set down by local fire codes and of the Underwriters' Association,\ Mr. Wood said. In addition to the call boxes, other fire safety equipment in campus dormitories includes, on each floor, two carbon dioxide fire extingui$hers for electtical and grease fires and two water- propelled extinguishers for paper and wood fires. Heat detection units that are activated if the room temperature suddenly rises, are also located in every room. To further fire protection, campus police officers go on three fir~ from 5 p.m.·-1 a.m., securing all watches each day. During these th~ offices, as well as patrolling watches, the officers walk through and completely closin~ the each floor of every building building.

Page I questions. One question dealt with the place of loyalty to the President as opposed to the personal opm1o ns of the administrators .. Dr. Bonner responded that he wants outspoken administrators and the p-roblem was that, in a number of c~ses, they didn't give the President \good information\ about the feelings of those in the campus community. But then asked why Dean Smith was fired if he did communicate his feelings, Bonner re.plied· that . he should not have ·~stirred up\ the controversies of last year. When asked about the Davenport R~port to the Trustees, which seemed. to be critical of Bonner, he responded that he could not comment on the contents of a confidential report. The question of who allegedly undermined Dr. Eonner;s position and 'how it was allegedly done 1ast year was ans\,!Vered similarly. President Bonner stated that it wouldn't be fair to name those be believed involved because he wanted \to put the past behind us... Dr. Bonner tllen stated that he had rnade sollle mistakes and has chang~d his mind on some issues and about some people. A question w.as then asked on why there were di~repencics in the treafment of 1\fr. Shupe, Mt. Harkness and Mr. Smith. Dr. Bonner explained that each case was dealt with tbrouJh tbe .proper channels. Shupe was revie:wi!'Ci by the Allen :C omlllittee•s rec~Jlnmendation to the P .A. B. Ha.rkness was susp~nded by . Bol11le( for a two week per.iQd on · the evidence of the William& letter and then was reinstated by ~he Board of Trustees. Smith was also deiUt with by Bonner but was then summarily dismissed. A.n!!'ther question dealt with both tl:ie Arts and Hockey programs. The President denied . that athletics have any sort of pri~rit:y with his administration. He then· wemf on to ~ay that an Arts pr()Eram is gradually being · develo]Jed and when a definite program is decided upon. only thea will a building. be .planned. to upgradt! the present facilities. In a. closing question, Bonnet respcnded as to whether he ' contributed to the climate leading to the a.dmissiQns violations · . cited in the Allen Committee- rep~:> ft. Dr. ~onner s~ted that he accepts some .of the responsibility for the mistakes of last year in tertns <>f this issue. At the conchasiort of the interview:, President Bonner stated that the fu.ture of adll'lissions, .the nature of the ~latioEsllip with the ·•university .. , and cl:langes iQ tbe Governance systelll · would be his major cortcems for Union's future.

Every Thursday night something slightly II!agical happens in that weird little room in Carnegie Hall. A· room full of pe.ople are gently persuaded to takepart in a show and they enjoy it. The laughter, comments from · the audience and applause are proof of a successful endeavor . Your friends are there. They get together whatever talent they have aJ1d put it into some presentable form for your enjoyment. There have been some priceless moments; recall, if you will, Joe Zolner's act, The Gong Show, and the Dating Game not to mention Thursday Night Dead and the fire juggler. 'As this list indicates a wide variety of acts appear at Cabaret. \We're very flexible with the types of acts we put oil,\ says Sue Portin, programming director of the Cabaret. There have been one-act plays, musicals, films, musicians and singers. This year Cabaret .i!! looking for the same variety including mimicry, comedy and illusion acts. Cabaret was originally founded in 1974 to provide an opportunity for performets to express themselves in a different way. Since ·it is more of an intimate nightclub than a theater, you will see acts there that would not appear in a Mountebank's production or anywhere else on campus. One of the special thiQgs about Cabaret is the infortnality and dialogue between· performer and audience. There the stage is part of the audience and the auoience is part of the performance.

President Bonner has sh()wn, through bis past actions~ a disregard for every student, faculty n1ember, and administrator at Union College. His remarks Sunday night, Octo-ber 9,. on WRUC, when clrecked against other reliable ancl informed sources made a ' ' lll(rek.ery of the pn}.gram. Boomer · obviously bad nn regard towards a~uracy or the truth, and the stories be tO-ld made_ hitn sound more ltke the scapeguat 'of the situation than the cau$e. _.U·y Stretching and di~~_egatding the truth. Pre-Sident Bonner bas lost aU his' credibility. And with it goes a tittle bit of Union Co.\ft~ge\s reputation. lt ian.•t juSt'\~ the ·unfair treatment affotded Dean Snuth. lt's the Wb:0W SitUation, Wb.ieh is nQW oUt'. ·of hand. By retaining Burtner, the college cannot hope to keep adding exoollent faculty members .and administrators, and the end result will be a far less prestigious Union College. This situation can only be remedied with a strong, truthful, and responsible college president. We won 1 t be abl-e to shake the stigma of \Union Gate\ until Bonner leaves Union College.

He knows that this cretinism. is for· faseistsandeommunists,yet. he feels that h-e must change the system. This is ex:t:remcly difficult to perf\rm by one person, and his efforts tg, restr·ucture are soon completely exhausted. The people in Student Government thus proceed to oust the -studcem be~use of his nun .. conformist views. This· action taken b-y. the Government is naturally a sound Qne.

They · think they c.an · hold elections on certain issues without the full representation of the student body. When asked to reveal certain key facts, they claim that the campus media have already edu-cated, or will educate in the near future, the students. Is this because our \representa- tives\ do not know the facts? ~r perhaps they are engaging tn a cover-up far greater in severity than the ones they aUege are occurring in c.ertain offices on the campus!

Scaceia '8i Pub Screen To Mr. Greent c/o Editor. Conoordy: What a nightmare it would be if dozens of Union College students assembled in the Pub tQ watch a spoi'ts event or ntlrer special program on a Su)lday afternoon, rather than seclude themselves ·in the library or the-ir ro-oms. And wouldn't it be terrible if students filled the Pub Qn a Monday night rather than sit in fro-nt of their own television sets with their roO-mtnates? I am sure that it would be a nightmare for Angelo as well, seeing all those students drink the Pub's liquor and eat the Pub's f0:9d, on what would otherwise be quiet times for business. The point being made here is that the television screen would undoubtedly help bring. students t~gether on occasions when they otherwise would remain at home. Furthermo-re. if Angelo had spent the Pub's money to improve the audio-video equipment in SS016, or tO' better stock the library, I rea1Jy do not think it would have improved the Pub's business. And, in any c-ase, Mr. Mazzone has indeed done a \phenomenal job\ with the Pub {which he has) and everyone knows that special drink nights definitely do preserve. the \overall atmosphere .. of the Pub better than a spe¢ial programming· event possibly couki {and ewryone has been screaming about those for a long time). Well. Mr. Green, don't worry too much about the 6- foot television screen ruining tb¢ \overall atmosphere\ of the Pub. as only the left half of the atmosphere w-l'Juld be ruined, as the right hand side has been preserved fnr .. social mixing.\ ln closing, before you make· blind accusatioos about the manner in which the College allocates its funds, 1 suggest that you should look for the facts first. In ~his instance, the fact of the matter is that the Pub did indeed solely foot the bill for the screen - and not the College~ as Mr. Mazzone bas assured me, Respectfully submitted, Lanee S. Hoffman '79 Gratitude Dear Editor: l cannot let your October 5 issue go by without expressing my deepest gratitude for all you said. With your indulgence, 1 would like to correct a factual error and also what may be a misiropression. First, the fact* ual err.or. l was, n-et .offered t~ prtsideney of MampJhite: C()i'· le-·. the anonymity and integrity of bath candidates and colleges, these negotiations are usually private. No less so in the case of Hampsbil'e and, as far as I am concerned, so it will stay. Unhappily, Bennington allowed its problems to become part of the current journalistic media~bype and, in spite of my efforts, that matter became part of public record. With respect to misimpressions: it is just wrong to leave the impression that I alone solved any major problems during my ;·years as Provost. (Especially the ones you refer to · with _respect to tenure and the ''budget.) In euh case, I have-- W\lrked with faculty~ S:tudtntt, other administratp.rs · and trustees. They have • b-e® willing to share with m-e. tbe headaches ,......... 11 the l~t . \'friehdsbips the · seemingly ep.dle~s · b.ours of discussion and just plain hard work. Tbeydeserve the credit and the thanks _qf_~ll of us; my o.wn hopes. for Union depend upon their continued participation.. The facts are that particip,atory governance CBR be made to WOl'k~ that no one has infinite wisdom on the difficult issues attd that it is more efficient as w-ell as more in keeping with the educati-onal aspiratians of a college committed to liberal education to have people work together in solving collective problems. Leadership is needed} and 1 tried to provide that, but effective leadership depen~s on .many sacrifices by ethers and we must never forget our gratitude to them. If one who leaves- can be permitted to pontificate, I should like to leave you with the following tho-ugbts. Union is a fine college. The two critical elements for educational excellence are here: faculty and students both fully qualified and both committed to the highest educational standards, to the highest qual-ity and to integrity. We enter a difficult period in higher education. lf Union can keep itself f-ocused carefully on wbat it does so well: providing perhaps the broadest and mo-s.t challenging undergraduate curriculum in an~ small residential college, U nmn can emerge from the difficulties of the next decade -with the prominence and rec<!gnition it once had and will so richly deserve. The times will ttot be eas~, but perhaps w~ will all be able to . l(}.()k back in 1990- and say with pride that we helped this college provid'e its students with the finest education. I think Union is so close and the opportunities are so real that settling for anything less should be intolerable. Willard F. Enteman Provost Outrage To the Student Forum: e/ o tile Editor! We, as mem~rs of the Senior class are outraged at the October 6th and lOth meetings of the Student Forum to minimize the sentiments of ma11y m~m-bers of the senior class by giving them limite(i input as to wh<lm their student rep.resentative waub;l oo •. After diseussing the matter with memt>ers of the Student Forum, we feel that our rights as seniors have been superceded by the comparatively minor n~ed for ex.~die11cy. A majority of the members of the Forum -are not seniors and we, as seniors. find it incomprehensible tnat these ·people should have more say than us as to whom 'OUR' representative should be. Consequently, we ask for the only democratic means available -. an election. The time it takes is worthwhile. During the compositi-on of this\ letter at 12:30 a.m., Wednesday. Oct. 12 in the Coru:ordy office, a phone vote of the Forum regarding this issue was taken in response to this letter. Sudd-enly, the vote V!'as changed and this l-etter appeared· insignificant. However, we question the means by which these ends were achieved. We feel that seniors should have been polled rome carefully as to their opini<On before a decisiun was made. In tlte future, student sentiment must be taken in consideration more carefully. With honest feelings, :Karen Spar Gary A. Cohen Josh Oppenheim Election To the- Stlident Community: c/o tbe Editor: In response to the expressed opinion of a sampling of seniors, the Student Forum has reversed an earlier decision regarding the replacement of the vacated senior representative spot. At two different meetings. the Forum voted to have the Committee On Committees institute a ~election process whereby mterested seniors, who signed a list in Student Activities underwent interviews. The Committee On Committees working with set guidelines and criteria would then chouse five candidates to submit to the Fo-rum. The Forum would then decide on a Senior Class Representative from these five names. No djssent was voiced by members of the Senior class who did attend the open Forum meeting at which thi$ was d.istu$ed. The Forum rnembe,rs were dpen to input since the maj9rity of members did not decide, until the vote was forthcoming. The vote at the second m~ting Monday evening was slightly altered by the outcome was the same. After discussion with segments of the Senior class, on Tuesday, Ot::tober 12 who opposed the final vote of the Forum, the Forum members realized that there was very strong sentiment for an election. They were then polled and a majority voted for an election. Thus, the Election Committee will be immediately notified of this decision and · will begin preparation for an election.

A late Union drive spearheaded by Kevin Scheuer's course record win in 25:14 brought the squad to a win over Trinity, but left them staggering in the wake of a ime performance by a very to-qgh and ·talented Williams brigade.

The Hamilton game started off much like the St. Lawrence game. The day was sunny and warm and maybe the U rtic:>n booters just weren't qsed to it as they foUnd tMmselves trailing 2..;0 before even 25 minutes had passed. Union soon buckled down after realizing that the·y were .controlling the field of play. Pete Martini got things rolling with a penalty kick after a Hamilton player pushed a Union hooter down in the penalty area. Mike Smith tied it up with a ·somewhat unusual goal. From about 20 yards up the sideline in Hamilton's half, Smitty took a throw-in which traveled a good 70 yards right past everyone and was deflected by the goalie into the net. If the goalie hadn't touched it, it wouldn't have been a goal. A throw-in is indirect, which means that the ball must be touched by at least one other player, offensive or defensive, before it can be put in the net. The goal pushed the ga1Ile· into overtime. Fullback Mike Smith drills ball upfield. Union kept the pressure on. Soph. Doug Crawford Plays Outstanding Week i~ Goal Doug Crawford, a sophomore from Pittsford, N.Y., is this issue's athlete of the week. A talk with Crawford at a recent Dutchman practice which he was forced to watch due to • aching shin splints revealed a thoughtful player who can credit a great deal of effort for his success in the crease. \When I rnade the switch from high school to college. it kind of threw ine for a loop,\ said the brown-ltaired goalie, \and as a result my goal tending suffered.\ Indeed, as a freshman, Crawford · · was the back-up behind then- sophomore Mark Rekucki, and saw limited action, starting in only three games. With the summer transfer of Rekucki, fhe burden of the starting job fell on the relatively untested Crawford. After a tough pre-season training camp and a shaky start, Crawford began responding to the pressure. First against St. Lawrence, after allowing one fluky goal early in the game., Crawford shut out the visitors for the last eighty minutes. Then, versus Hamilton, Crawford \he1d the team together\ according to a veteran teammate with his clutch saves in a scoreless sec<>nd half and overtime for the continentals. \The most important characteristic for a soccer g9alie to have is self-confidence,\ said CraWford, ''and by the time the Hamilton overtime tame around~ ,.

Paul Marvin took the ball away from a Hamilton player, beat two others and just barely got his toe on the ball to get rid of.it to John Kovacs. Kovacs split in between the two Hamilton fullbacks and got a shot off past a rushing goa:lie who just wasn't there in time. Score! Union revenged their loss of last y~ar to the Hamilton squad and went on to win 3~2. If you dislike violen~e in sports, and you missed the Albany State game last Saturday, you're lucky. This game wasn't violent like \Clockwork Orange\ wasn't violent. The game finally culminated with Union on top, to the surprise of many as the game had been called ••a tune\UP game\ for Albany $tate's games with Oneonta and Hartwick this week. Well, Union showed everyone who had more desire and mqre spirit. Union might have been outskilled by a largely foreign Albany State team, but when you come down to it, it's not who can dribble the ball all day long,. it's who scores more goals. Union Union, after trailing by l goal, put together a devastating offensive thrust in the last 25 minutes of regulation play. Leading the team was goalie Doug Cra\vford, who probably singlehandedly motivated the team on to win by his amazing and I repeat, amazing, play. He came up with saves that were unimaginable. A point black shot by Albany State grabbed out of mid air and sucked in by Crawford drew an ovation from the crowd. But it wasn't just one - it was about lO that just left the crowd in awe. His total was an impressive 23 saves. Union tied the game when Pete Handy took a high-spiraling shot as Pete Martini flew in front of the goalie. Martini deflected it ever so little past the goalie. Five minutes remained as Union was keeping the pressure on. After regulation, the score was 1-l. In overtime, the momentum was with Union. Aggressi:ve play by Bobby Hogan, who kept his cool despite constant hacking by Albany players took control of the midfield along with Marvin and Miller. Union's winning goal came when Jamie Hilton sent in a throw to Martini who drew out the Albany goalie. The ball passed over to a crowd in front of the net. Albany failed to clear it as John \Clutch\ Kovacs ·~handed\ Albany the loss with a goal to the right corner of the net. The game ended with a lot of sore, but happy Union players. kept the game from getting too far away from them by putting up with the overly aggressive, bush- league play by the Albany State players. Unfortunately; the referees let the game get carried ------------ away. They were handing out R yellow cards (warnings) instead of u Q·Q e r s · red cards {expulsion) too often. The Albany players couldn't have been more blatant in their .. chop- elll~own\ style of tackling. The game ended with only one Albany State player being expelled. From this writer's viewpoint, another four state players could have gone with him. When a player runs l.S . yards full spring straight towards another player on the other team, and chops him down, that isn't a · yellow card. It was typical of the game though. This coming Saturday is a much welcomed home-game as the 5 win~ I loss Dutchmen face highly regarded Albany Med on Library Field. The Ruggers hope for a fine showing for this game from their fine Union fans. We are a11xious to sh()W you what has made Union one of the finest Ruaby powers in the area.

For the third consecutive week the Dutchmen lost the coin toss and on each occasion their opponent has taken the opening kickoff in for a score. Colby started on their own 38 and needed onl:y seven plays to march the remaining 62 yards with quar.terback Frank Sears running it over from the Union five. The PAT was missed and Colby took the lead 6-0. Kevin K ormondy's diving interception of a Sears' pass on the Union 48 set up the Dutchmen's first tally. Relying mainly 011 the run, Terranova moved Union downfield to the three yard line where Romer knifed over for the score with only five seconds gone in the second quarter. MacDonald added. the PAT to give Union a 7.,. 6 lead. · Union boosted its lead to 13-6 as Terranova guided the Dutchmen 90 yards in just seven plays. The clincher came on Joe Poletto's brilliant catch between two Colby defenders of a 36 yard Terranova aerial with 2:38 remaining in the half. Poletto, who transferred as a sophomore last year trom the University of Rhode Island, had an outstanding game with five catches for 74 yards. The Dutchmen defense failed· to hold however as Sears continua:lly took advantage ·Of Union defensive errors to spot wide op¢:n Colby receivers time and time ag~t,in. With only 28 seconds remaining in the half Sears bit halfback George Dolan with a six yard scoring strik~ to cap a 68 yard drive, and bring Colby to within one point at 13-12.

Union's women were psyched to beat this school - and apparently Vassar was determined to defeat the Dutchwomen. It was definitely a battle of nerves, as the games see-sawed back and forth. What both teams saw as an easy victory turned into a grueling two hour match. The games were tied two apiece when it appeared that Vassar would be the victor because of their 10-4 lead. Union refused to surrender to the socialites as Cathy \Hustler;' Reals put away six fantastic serves, creating havoc among the Vassar team. Heads~up play by the rest of the team and superb spiking and net defense by the two \Fantastic Freshwomen\ Sheila: O'Donnell and .Jill fhomson put an end to the struggles of their opponents, and an end to the jangling nerves of Coach Barta as Union took the match 3-2. Monday night the women traveiled down the Tllruway again in search of easy prey and found it in the f<Jrm of Ulster County Community College. Having never battled them before, Union was wary and ready to play their hardest, having decided that another win was what they desired. The game started slowly, almost lethargically, as both teams moved sluggishly and without any great exuberance.

t n y · EPC on Honors by DAVID GOSS 'The· Educational P.oHcy Committee, carrying out ~ts responsibility for curricular and educational innovation, began work on the proposed honors program delineated in a report by Professor Byron Nichols (January, 1977). In his \Proposal to Create an Honors Program at Union College: the Steinmetz Curriculum,\ Nicholas favors a program which would provide enrichment rather than ac~eleration for students .. He sees this as being logically consistent with the idea of Liberal Learning. an honors program as de~cribed in Nichols' proposaL Last Wednesday, the committee began discussion of the program. As Oean of Faculty Paula Brownlee noted during the meeting, some students would really be sparked. by the knowledge that the opportunity afforded by an · honors program is available.

Therefore, s():rne of the honors courses offered should tran$verse the .academic disciplines. But since different Divisions within the cllllege have different needs to which the honors program should respond, Union should not limit the program to . inter-departmental type courses. Each Division, under Nichol's proposal, Wotdd be free to create i~s own honors courses within established guidelines. At the end of Wednesday's meeting, a subcommittee was creat~ to .study and report on certain of the goals of the honors program. Already considerable progress has occurred in tlte meetings of the subcommittee.

Student Forum held another open meeting in the Old Chapel at 9:00 p.m. as agreed to at last week's meeting .. At last week's meeting, it was decided that various means af communication would be used to inform and educate the campus of impending issues concerning the college. It was also decided that students would express their opinions via letter-writing to the Board of Trustees. In a closed meeting: held earlier Monday evening, the Student Forum passed th.e following resolution: \Be it resolved that the Student FDrum requests an immediate review of the Presidency of Tlu~mas Bonner.\ This reso-luticm was moveq, seconded and passed unanimously. The open meeting, attended by approximately 200 students, was opened by Forum President Michael Ganz. The first thing discussed at Monday night's meeting was the idea of a Presi- dential Review. It was suggested t:hat the Review Board would probably consist of students~ faculty members and trustees. The Board's first task would be to define the criteria used to evaluate the President. Testimony would probably be taken from various members of the campus :, ,. . . . . . . .' ... . TheStudem Forum community. The Review Board would make their decision and report their findings to the Trustees. The following resolutions were acted upon at the meeting. I) Be it resolved that in this critical juncture of U niort's history, students will articulate their sentiments and perceptions to 1he Board of Trustees. 2) Upon discussion with and advice from student leadership, it is felt that the most effective form this articulation can take is letter- writing. These letters sh<Juld be sent to the Board ofTrustees and delivered to Andrew Ko blenz, Box 709 1 Brien OToole, Box 1634, or to a st~nd erected in the { '· ' lobby of Carnegie hall during the week. Koblenz and O'Toole· will then forward these letters to the Board on Saturday, October 22 at the Board's scheduled meeting, along with their perceptions of the situations. These two motions, though separate, were voted on together, and were passed unanimously. 3) Be it resolved that the body of students congregated at Old Chapel for an open meeting of students called by the Student Forum, requests an immediate Presidential Review to be constituted by the Board of Trustees. This motic;m was also passed unanimously. 4) Be it resolved that the Student Forum conduct a poll of students. The question to be asked should focus on the Bonner Presidency and a review -of it, but its exact wording is to be determined by the Forum at a later datt:;. The results of this poll should be available for the meeting of the Trustees on October 2. This motion was defeated by a vote of ninety-seven to fifty-six. the proposal made by ·Sophomore Representative Randy Feldman to set up a booth in the lobby of Carnegie for the purpose of providing a place for student letters to be left, Will also provide materials to write these letters to the trustees . ~sponsive student environment that complements the educational objectives of the College. As part of its mission, Union has accordingly set goals for student life programs of higb quality, an attractive campus setting, educa- tional contacts with the surrounding community and professional colleges in Albany, and a vigorous term abroad experience for a majority of its students. \The College is deep.,ly concerned about the career objectives of students, as expressed in its curriculum a~d administrative services, but sees no conflict with the central objective of broad preparation in the liberal studies. The · comprehensive range of Union's educational offerings, it is · assumed, is the best training ground for all careers and career choices, as well as for leading a satisfying life. Union must continue to make clear its historic conviction that liberal education is career education in the deepest sense. The College agrees with former Provost Theodore Lockwood's statement that \the pursuit of happiness requires self- , confide1;1ce, understanding, and sensitivity. These are qualities which education can neither foster nor neglect. Certainly. technical training has no obligation to reach beyond the provision of the requisite skills. A good liberal arts education must, on the other hand, build self- confidence. It should arouse our innate curiosity and foster a love of learning. Admittedly, these are goals; it does not follow that sensitivity and zest for a lifetime of learning occur in every student. But the opportunity is there, and it is the most important opportunity we have unless we are willing to reduce happiness to that old philosophical definition of the absence of pain. •• \Graduate education shall continue to be a vital but minor part of Union College for the benefits it brings to the intellectual life of the campus, the example it provides of dedicated scholarship, the opportunity it gives for limited education beyond the bachelor's level, and the support it gives to under- graduate education through courses offered in advanced technology, quantitative methods, problem-solving methodolt>gies, ' and special skills necessary to ·Continued on PageS

1·. t .. l '_ Action Now Nine days ago a large contingent of students j~mmed into !he Old Chapel in an effort to learn of and discuss the tssues for whtch Union College has become infamous. An hour and a half later, after the yelling and debating subsided, nothing, in reality, had been accomplished .with the .possible exception of incr~sing the divisiveness already s1tuated on ca!flpus. The student body, or at least the ones who gave a damn-, sttll ~elt uninformed. The Student forum promised to oblige. by supplytttg as much information as possible in an unbiased manner. The Forum suggested Coricordiensis, the student newspaper, the \voice\ of the college, and after much more weary-eyed debate, a four-page spread was decided upon, with its impetus directed at the man students wished to know all about, Dr. Thomas N. Bonner. This objective was carried out and all those who were concerned now had the information as so desired. Unfortunately, the continuing and growing problem . of divisiveness remained ubiquitous and solutions were simply not in sight. A week full of discussion on the prominent issues at the college passed as the campus grew farther ~part. Thi~ past. Mon,~ay, President Bonner began his first of a .senes of meetmgs wtth vanous student .. leaders\ which ended with,...aneated argument between Dr. Bonner and a Student Trustee, thus only widening the already Jarge gap existing between the president and the student body. Only a well conducted Forum meeting held that evening, where a resolution was passed encouraging a letter-writing camp~ign . to bring student sentiment to the Truste~s, helped calm the SituatiOn for the time being. Unfortunately, conflict still remains at this time; c~nseque.ntly, enjoying one's years at Union College has become an mcreasmgly difficult task. Also, remembering that we are all students here has also been somewhat forgotten. Why is this so? This situation exists because Dr. Bonner has caused it. Perhaps not so much by what he has done, but by the effe~t of his a.ctio~s upon the campus community. As long as he remams .at Umon, 1t will be such. Although his resignation would be the eastest way out, it is unlikely to occur so the decision of whether or not to \terminate\ him rests solely upon the Board of Trustees. Therefore, C:oncordiensis urges an immediate and thorough Presidential Review and the subsequent proper actions. Thorburn Report The Thorburn Report recently released by President Bonner as a discussion paper warrants serious scrutiny ~y the student body. The report (see page 4 for details) descnbes the effects of last spring's turmoil and its association with the governance structure. More closely, however, the report questions the effective~es.s of the All-College Senate and the student-faculty-admtmstrator Committee System. Implied in the report is the fact that stu~ents no longer have a deep regard for this governing struetu~-e-at-l:Jmon. The present governance structure was formed du~n~ the 1971 academic year. Clearly, it was a result of student a~t:v1sm. of that time; but, equally important, it opened up admmlstrative and advisory control to the student poplilati?n: Today there ar.e 29 standing committees ranging from Adm1ss1ons and Educat10nal Policy to Library and Traffic Control. Student~, faculty,, _and administrators serve together to make combmed dec1s1ons regarding Union. . . . . Concordiensis is deeply concerned w1th the tmphcatlons of the Thorburn report. We strongly feel that studen!~ should and _mu~t serve as advisors. and decision makers at U mon.

administration and its campus censtituencies are expre~sed. If the president does not accept the. concept manifest · in the present governance system - and his utterances and actions of this sumnwr and fall as well as of last winter and spring proclaim that he does not - then what does he seek from this meeting? Surely, the complexity of the issue b.efore us cannot, urtder the best of curcumstances, find unanimous resolution in one brief meeting. Does anyone doubt, given the president's p~st record, that he will choose for transmission to the Board only those remarks that either favor his views or appear to serve his interests? Can this meeting be expected to produce reasoned, documented debate on \changes in current programs or program emphasis\ which would then .. be subject to full <l.iscussion through the regular committee structure\? We believe n'ot, but even if this were possible, does anyone have a scintilla of confidence that, were the process to result in proposals running counter to the president's manifest biases, he would accept them and serve as their advocate be.fore the Boatd? How could the president command such confidence? By pledging his support in advance? We have traveled that route before and know the 'precise value of his pledge. 2) If the president were sincere in involving the faculty and the students in the determination of Union's future course, the manner in which he has laid the question before us would raise serious doubts as to his competence as a leader and administrator. He announced this meeting a month ago, and he_may have considered calling it months before that. He has therefore had ample time to prepare for it. But has he sought guidance in articulating the issues or in gathering data to inform our discussion from the E.P.C? from the Planning and Priorities Committee? from the P.A.p.? from the Divisions? Arrogating full responsibility for the preparation to himself, he has assumed full responsibility for its shortcomings. What has been the pattern of Editor, Concordiensis~ In the midst of all the stupid :.creaming for Bonner to be lynched, I would like to rl!gister my opinion that Hunner is not nearly so bad as has been implied by many of the misinformed and/or uninformed people who are shrieking the loudest .. First of all, what specifically has he done wrong! According to an \inside\ source (who has the best information I have heard}, Shupe went to Bon11er asking his , opinio~. ~s ~o. whether or not a hQckey player with low gra;aes:· · rdiould be admitted. Bonner told Sl1upe that he (Shupe} . , was the admissiorts director and that. he should make , the· de¢ision himself. s<> Shupe· admitted the person, independently. How does that prove the ''moral decadence\ of Bonner? Adtnittedly~ th~ truth of the· above story is unknown, bnt so is the validity of all the oth.er rumors floating around. l hereby defy anyone to come up with any solid, · - ,, , .-CONCQRDIENSlSt fktq/ler 19~ 19'17 • • - .. ' I . ' . - -- -, - - ' ~pplications in the various, College programs for the past decade? How do they compare with the patterns in similar colleges? What data indicate how the presence of the diverse programs affect alumni support and special giving? What is the quality of the studtent& in our graduate programs? What are the real costs of these programs? What has been the financial record of Col;ltinuil)g Education and the Summer Sch.ool? Wh.at trends have emerged over the past decade in the proportion of the College Budget ass~gned to undergraduate instruction? to salaries in Administration? Etc., etc. Unlike the song the sirens sang, the . answers to » these questions are not wholly in the province of conjecture. lf it is not for us to know the answers, it is not for us to help in deciding t-he issues to which they attach. Lacking the facts, this meeting cannot grapple with the questions posed; it is left to the mercy of prejudices and pieties. To be sure, the president does give· us several sets of statistics, but these are not very useful in a discussion of the matters at hand. The Statistical Abstract or Population Bulletin could have furnished· figures for eighteen- year-olds, much more relevant than the aggregate figures for the eighteen to twenty-four year old group provided by his source; further, the population figures which should concern us are n,1t · those applicable to generai p~pulation which r~flect the disproportionately high fecundity of the lower class but those relating to children of the middle class families who generate the bulk of our applicants - figures far mote disquieting tl:lan those the president cites. But the basic problem is not with the reliability of the statistics; rather, it lies in the fact that they are exogenous. We at Union can do nothing to change the census figures, but, properly led and informed, we might be able to do something to improve · our position vis a vis the market that exists. Although the statistics in the president's paper may alert us. to the need for reaction,they do, not provide information that d.g,cumented, operational evidence 6r concrete misdeeds by Bonner. If such is produced, perhaps a case could be ma(te against him. All I have heard and read so far is unsupported ' hearS:ay, nearly all of it blatanUy hostile to this man, much of it smelling of out~and-out sl~nder. 1 am , appalled and ehraged by the incredible ~mpunt of unsupported, til~gtadina~ and abusive dirt which has unfairly been dumped in· Banner's lap.

If these things are so, he should be pitied, not hated. cqul4 guide us in planning the best strategic allocation of our energies and resources. 3) The president readily admits that his paper does not provide a blueprint for the College's future, but is it not his function to dr:a w a blueprint -- or alternative blueprints for our d~eiiberations? Can such blueprints be expected to arise frorn this floor? Or is it his intention to solicit nodding assent to platitudes and ten etch his plans in councils at a far remove from this body? In the April 16 report to the Board, President Bonner, quoting no less an authority titan himself, states: \To be effective, a President · must not only have the confidence of the Board and the campus, he in ust be the principal communicator between the · governing board apd those who comprj.se the college community ... A well~informed and skillful President can over time ... prevent . those unpleasant and unnecessary , conflicts that can come from lact of effective communication ... I believe there is an important difference between leadership and management. Many institutions are well managed b\lt poorly led .,.l do believe that the President can and should articulate goals, that he shoulc,t set a tone for the entire institution, that he must be the principal planner, the most persistent communicator, and the a~_gressive ·promoter of ideas.\ Our present predicament on this campus is evidence of whether President Hoimer has the confidence of this community necessary to lead it toward the ne~t decade. Beyond that, the paper this meeting has been called io discuss demonstrates neither a principal planner nor an aggressive promoter of ideas. If this statement by the E. P. C. is preoccupied with questions that do not advance the formulation of plans for Union's future, it is becau'se President Bonner is too concerned with his present personal survival to devise future strategies for our consideration. Now, I would like to mention some of the things which I and others happen to like about Bonner. (I) He has brot,~ght it: successful hockey program to' Union College (by recruititl~ Ned Harkness); This is one o'f · the few sports we've seen h¢:t:e which has risen above a mediocre level of performan~e· in terms of games won. l ·would like to see this team. remain here and continue it$: a~omplilibments; if lto·nn~r ,. ~oes, Harkness and the hockey ~am wilt probably disappettl ', also.

''university.. tl.ll\e~J)ft . is, in. my opinion. · i\n., important idea which cov,t~,: , prove vital to enhancing Uriib# · College's chances for sut·vival: in the years to come. If you · Contitlded on - t-lr\ ,. · Trustees Here For most students the Trustees are a group whose workings are rem()te and arcane. When they meet here Saturday though, their decisions will have such profound consequences for this school, and hence all of us, that it behooves us to take a closer look into their machin11tions. In the first place, it is somewhat misleading to speak solely of the October 22 meeting. Much of the work that will be done this weekend will happen in committee meetings on Friday, the 21st. The trustees have 8 standing committees. The are: Academic Affaifs; Buildings, Grounds and Equipment;. College Resources; Nominations. Awards, and Honors; Student Affairs; Executive Committee; and finally Budget and Audit. All of the Trustees sit on more than one of these committees and may attend any other committee meeting they desire. It is on Friday that you have the best chance of seeing that group of (mostly) men walking between meeting places in the kind of expensive 3~piece suits to which we all , aspire. If any of you, as many students have already indicated they do, have any qJ,testions you want to ask a \real\ trustee and see one, please be courteous, but don't feel any qualms about walking up and asking your question or telling him what your concerns about Union are. We are on the board because they want to know what is weighing on students' minds; use us but don't confine your expression simply to Student Trustees. Their visit provides an opportunity for them to get a look at Union in1 greaterd~th;allow them to do so. On Saturday, the full board meets. The President, Provost, Student Trustees, as well as the chairpersons of aU standing committees deliver reports to the Board. And our report, aside from individual inquiries of us in a mOfe casual manner, provide the primary form for us to describe the state of the campus from the students' perspective. It will probably be in this forum that we will present the board with the Students' letters and explain their context. Then along with the president we will ask for a Presidential Review, and then perhaps independently of the president. we will ask for an immediate review. Finally, we reiterate the importance of writing your thoughts and feelings down in a letter. We have, and will continue to visit floors seeking input before the meeting; but for ourselves as well as the other trustees, a letter is a much more forceful statement of your feelings. If you plan to write, and can sense the presence of lurking procrastination, recall that in a very real way you've got a responsibility to yoursefves and this community to let your thoughtful response to our situation be heard. This is your community, you as students have been allowed to play major roles in all significant decisions because you merit that right. The time has come to act and confirm the implicit trust that lies with you as members of a distinctly fine educational community. Andrew D.

LETTERS Editor, Concordiensis, In the midst of all the stupid :.creaming for Bonner to be lynched, I would like to register my opm1on that Hunner is not nearly &o bad as has been implied by many of the misinformed and/or uninformed peo.ple who are shrieking the loudest .. First of all, what specifically has he done wrong? According to an \inside\ source (who has the best information l have heard), Shupe went to Sonner asking his . opinion as -to whether or nota hockey player with low grades- should be. admitted. Bonner told Shupe that he (Shupe) ·was the admissions director and that he should make the decisi<>n himself. So Shupe admitted the pers<tn. independently. How does that prove the \moral decadence\ of Bonner? Admittedly, tbe truth of the above stO'ry is unknown, but so is the validity of all the other rumors floating around. I hereby defy anyone to come up with any solid, dQcurnented, operational evidence of concrete misdeeds by Boruter. If such is produced, perhaps a case could be made against him. All 1 have heard and read so far is unsupported hearsay, nearly all of it blatantly hostile to this man, much ·of it smelling of out-and·out slander. l am . appalled and enraged by the incredible amount of unsupported, degrading~ and abusive dirt which has unfairly been dumped in 8()rtner's lap. 1 demand that we attempt to live up to the American ideal of presuming a· rnan innocent until p.roven gJ~i1ty! . The worst criticism of Bonner which I. have heard which seems to me to nave a chance of being demunstrated as legitimate is tlt~t he hesitates to make firm decisions ot to tttke · decisive action on his id~~s;- · al~t. he expends too much : effort worrying about his. iPlag~ and . trying .to justify. h~~¢lf to others, .. when he should be just exercising his aut.Jtority in a confident manner. If these things are so, he should be pitied, not hated. Now, l would like to mention some of the things which I and others happen to like about Bonner. (I) He has brought a successful hockey program to Union College (by recruiting Ned Harkness). This is one of the few sp<lrts we've seen here which has risen above a mediocre level of performance in term& of games won. t · would like to · see this team remain here and continue its accomplishments~ if Bonnet gbes, Harkness and the hockey team will probably disappe\if' also.

Finally, we reiterate the importance of writing your thoughts and feelings down in a letter. We have, and will continue to visit floors seeking input before the meeting; but for ourselves as well as the other trustees, a letter is a much more forceful statement of your feelings. If you plan to write, and can seme the presence of lurking procrastination, recall that in a very real way you've got a responsibility to yourselves and this community to let your thoughtful response to our situation be heard. This is your community, you as students have been allowed to play major roles in all significant decisions because you merit that right. The time has come to act and confirm the implicit trust that lies with you as members of a distinctly fine educational community. Andrew D. Koblenz, Student Trustee Brien O'Toole, Student Trustee An Open Letter From: Paula P. Brownlee for the Internal Education Foundation To: Concordiensis It is my pleasure to inform all memb .. rs of the educational community of . Union College that the Internal Educational Foundation is a reality for 1977-78. We are now ready to implement the policy action passed by the Senate on May 19, 1977. This Jetter is to inform you that we are looking for individual proposals from students and faculty members. We are anxious to receive these as soon as possible in order to make awards that can be fully utilized this year; to this end we are asking for the proposals (forms are available in the Dean of Faculty's Office) in the categories '(b)' and '(c)': I.

In order . to achieve and maintain this, Pres.: Bonner Releases Thorburn By JIM DAVIS President Bonner, attempting to sway the opinions of Union College, circulated a report on the present campus sovernance structure. The report by Dr. Thorburn, an American C<>uncil on Education Fellow :at Union last year, was first s~nt by President Bonner in July to the faculty members of the Presidential Advisory Board in July. He indicated that the report · might form the basis for discussion concerning the campus government. Student members of the PAB received copies of the report at the beginning of this term. On the request of Ted Bick, chairman of the P AB~ 1he report is now available to any person at Union. .. I talked with Dr. Benner about the report/' said Andy Koblent, a trustee of the St11dent Forum. ..He said tltat the report isn't in any way official or binding. It's just <>ne person's · opinion and Dr: l!onner thought it would be of value to make those views known.\ The Thorburn Rc;port studies the Union campus gcvernment as an example of what Dr. Th<Jrburn terms the \community governance model.\ In this model, suggested by an ad-hoc committee created in the 1970-71 academic year to study the then-existing ~ampus governance system, Union's administrators share their basic decision-making responsibilities with faculty and students .in the All-College Senate. The All-College Senate is composed of ten students, twelve faculty members representing each of Union's four academic divisions., and two administrators - the Dean of Students and Dean of Faculty. The Senate is chaired by the President with the Provost and Secretary in attendance. The Senate legislates over all changes in curriculum, discipline and most other areas having to do . with educational, social and economic aspects of the college. The Thorburn Report questions whether the community gowmance model, as embodied by the AU-College Senate, is · effectively legislating college affairs. \The community governance mcdel creates tension,\ states the report. \The system can . effectively slow down decision making.

As a member of the senior class and as a Head Re~ident Advisor, l find myself increa~mgly concerned for the future of my college. In the past ) years I have seen a decline in the rnorale of the students and a loss of respect for the College, Furthermore, I am led to believe that this is a result of Pr~idertt Bonner's !:ldmimhtration.

Last year the faculty voted no confidence in Dr. Bonner. 102 to 28. The administratio-n :Started a similar vote; Dr. Bonner impounded the ballO>t box saying that the ballot was unauthorized. Why have these results not been released? 3. Why is Ned Harkness still employed by Union College after he admittedly lied to President Bon!'ler and said he would lie agait~ if he felt it necessary? 4, Why did Pre:sideJH Bonner appoint Rudy Nydegger to the position of Acting. Dean of Students without ever consulting any Student Affairs adllllnistrator$ or students? 5. If President Bonner questioned Provost Enteman's integrity as an a.dmini$trat.or, how could Enteman have been unanimously elected {out· of 300 candidates) to the. Presidency of Bowdoin College? Thank you for your time; I believe Union College will benefit greatly from you;r immediate attention to this matter. Sincerely, Dawn C. Porto '78 antics Dear Editor, Are the continuing a,ntics of President Bonner and friends really just an experiment by the Psychology Department to determine how much deceit, double-talk and deception a college student can tolerate? Or are Prc,ident Bollner's escapad~'> iHl exreritnen t by the Political Science Depart- ment to gaugt: ho·w lon11 a man can remain as head of an institut il''· ~ hi:c he destr:oys the in~titation', reputation and credibilit) hy couplillg poor judgement with Machiavellian beliefs'? If ~o, let'~ hope that the experimenters' conclusions are deemed satisfactory by President Bonner, lest he debase and ignore them as he did the conclusions of the Task Force on Athletics, the recom~ mendations of the All-College Senate and the conse11sus of the faculty.

'1977 5port5 UColl Air Attack Sinks RPI 22-13 by KEN PLUMB Union used its best performance to date along with mme timely passing en route to a 22-13 victory over rival RPl. The score was no indication of ,the game, however, as RPI scored their two touchdowns with under 2:30 left in the game against Union's reserves. Until that point the Dutchmen had completely dominated the game, suc~essfully capturing the Dutchmen Shoes Trophy for the third consecutive year. The first quarter produced little more than a ·punting contest as both teams adjusted to a field which only hours before had h-osted a rain filled Uniqn-RPI and quagmire at best. Union did have one opportunity when defensive tackle Mike Heavy recovered a fumbi~ deep in RPI territory. The Dutchmen hawever fumbled the baH right back on the very next play and the first quarter ended in a 0.:0 tie. · • A 17 yard punt gave Union the baH at midfield and the Dutchmen~ unable to run the ball, began to go to the air. Terranova hit sophomore tight end Kevin Eberly for 17 yards and after several un~uccessful running attempts he spotted freshmen Henry \Elmo\ Wright on a fourth anc;l six from the RPI 26 for the score.

The Union College Cross- Country team failed to spoil the R.P.I. homecaming by .succumbing on the hills of Troy to their most ungracious hosts, 19-40. Despite solid efforts by K.evin Scheuer and Bryan Liss, the Dutchmen's record slid to 2-4 in the third straight loss for the team to R.P.l. in as inany years. From the sound of the starting gun to the finish line it was a duel between Union standout Kevin Scheuer and R.P.J. trackster Paul Herbert. The pair WllS even past a 4:46 first mile, and at the three- mile point after the uphill section of the course they were still together. At this point, ho-wever, Herbert took advantage of his considerable experience on his home track and disappeared from a fatigued Scherer, going on to win in a course-record 25:29. \He just seemed to shoot away on the downhill. I was running as hard as I could but couldn't catch him,\ said the p,reviously unbeaten Scheuer \and he ran a great race.\ Next in order for the Dutc~men was Bryan Liss in seventh place. Liss, who has been erratic so tar this seas<m, came on strong at the end of the race and tan ••his best race of the season\ according to Coach Ted Bick. Between Scheuer and Liss, how~ver, was . a supporting contlngent of Herbert's team- mates that grouped together in front of Liss well enough to give R.P.I. the race, 19-40. The loss dropped the Dutchmen striders' record to 2-4, and left them only Wednesday's meet at Middlebury to improve on their two win performance of last year. ATTENTION!

His desperation pa~s floated· well over the head of Henry Wright, however, to end the threat though Union still led at the half 13-0 . Union ended the game for all intensive purposes in the third quarter with a textbook ball c~ntrol drive covering 80 y.ards in etght and a half minute!!. With the RPI defense keying on Romer all day long, Terranova once again went to the play action pass and with. virtually all day to throw the ball, he waited for the elusive Poletto to break open across the middle where he spotted hi.m with a 16 yard scoiing strike. .

The entire defe11se shined, however, as they held RPI to only 113 yards ou the ground and continually came up witb the big play when they needed it. Interceptions by defensive back Dave Wilbur and cornerback Andy Jartet being but two instances. Saginario plagued RPI all day with numerous open field tackles while Weber personally knocked down almost as many passes as the Engi:Qel!r receivers were able to grab collectively. Doug Napodano returned to lead the Dutchmen ground game with 60 yards in 17 carries while RPI did ~anage to hold Romer to only 48 yard~. With the defense overplaying the run, it was Terranova, 10~20 for 156 yards, Which sparked the offense as the Dutchmen again showed that they can move the ball through. the airwaves if need be~ The win was a big one for the Garnet who play host to favored Hobart next week back at friendly Alexander Field . V -Ball Loses by LYNN BATEMAN Last Wednesday the Union Women's Varsity Volleybal-l team met With a disappointing tri- match, against Williams and North Adams. The play in the Williams game, the second game, was not all disappointing; the discontent lay with the loss of the match. Williams and Union were equal opponents in their battle, yet one would never tell by the first score of 15-4, Williams. Union played well, but had incredibly bad luck in landing their ser\les on the court. Williams served very well and the first game was definitely won because · of this. l'he second game, however, had Union going with a strong rally through improved serving and exceptional team playing. Union's coverage on spikes was excellent, as they frustrated the Williams' women's attempts to end the volleys. Amy Juchatz had an excellent defen ... sive game as she continuously saved Williams' spikes and stifled their cheers. There Was also , superb blocking and spiking at the net by Jill Thomson, Sheila O'Donnell and Liz Yager. Cathy \Hustler\ Reals lived up to her nickname oi).ce again as' she hustled all over the surface to do her setting. Unf()ttu.nately, Union's rally seemed to end, at their lead of 13-10; as a psyched Williams player burned in their last five serves to win 15-13. It was frustrating to lose, but an excitifi:S and action-filled game, as the spectators attested to. Union's former ·fire seemed to die .as they faced a much weaker North Adams team, however .. The Union women knew that they would be victorious, but as the game seeh1ed to merely consist of service practice by Union, play was very sluggish and limited to short-lived volleys. Diana Gazzola had some excellent sets for the spiking hands of Kathy Mahar, Audrey Stein, and Diane Roncin as they finished off the North Adams team and left the court semi-victorious by the scores of 15-2, 15-8. Union repl'ays Williams November 2 at Russell Sage, and there is no chance of Williams s;;eakiim a game a way from the Dutchwomen again. ln the meantime, for the benefit of the fans, there will be a match against twc old rivals, Green Mountain College and ·Hudson Valley C.C., Thursday, October 20, at 7 p.m. in the fieldhouse.

I I. .. Page 1 Editorial Union College, as a result of tbe turbulent controversies concerning administrative policies and student repf(:sentation win s~on have several difficult decisions to make. One of these decisions Will .be whether or not to demand and force the resignation of Prestdent Bonner. Many students, faculty and administrators have already decided; others are waiting for more substantial evidence before re~ching a conclusion. It will not be long before this divided, but tens10n-fi~le~, c~tmpus will unify to take decisive action; all factors are pomtmg toward some form of action which would force the resignation of President Bonner. · · Be.fore reachi~g any deci~ion on this issue, it is imperative to ~onstder aU posstble ~lterna!tVes. T~e fir~t and most obvious option 1s to demand the unmedtate restgnatlon of President Bonner. Conseq~~nt to this. action would be a request for Dr. Huntley to fill the pos1t1on .of Actmg President. This would leave the leadership of the c.ollege m the hands of people who .are ~ccutely aware of the transtent na~u~~ of their appointment, and ntight tberefore be reluct~nt to .mittate .long range policies - Acting Dean Nydegger came mto h1s a~pomtme~t as· a ~rvice to the college community and has stated his lack of mterest m retaining the appointment; Dr, Huntley has announced that next year will be his last at Union· Prov?st Enteman will ~e leaving _Dnion in J~nuary. It js neady unamm~us that there extsts a quest1on of competency in the pte11ent leadership on campus; a complete turnover in leadership would only compound the problem. Another al~ernative widely discussed is that of writing letters to the T r~ste~s m the hope that, once cognizant of student opinion, they w1ll take some form of action. At best, this would result in s~me form of presidential review boatd to investigate the allegations dtrected at Dr. Bonner. On the basis of past experience -the lack of Trustee action when faculty voted no confidence in Bonner t~e l~ck of Trijstee action when Bonner iltlpounded the administra: t1o17s ballo.t, the lack of Trustee action when students requested that thetr P.restdent not hand them their diploma covers during grad~~t10n, the .lack of Trustee action When 20 out of 70 adm~n~strat?rs left Union during one year of Bonner's adm1mstra~1on - w~ lack confidence in the promise that the Trustees will tak~ ~ctton once .they view campus o.pinion. They have seen campus optmon and done nothing. It would seem foolish to plac~ our trust and f!lture in their hands in the light of last yea,t. Still yet, another alternative is to ask for President Bcmner•s resignation, to become effective at the end of the school year. ~owev~r, the co~sequences of having a president fqr 20 weeks, who ts cogmzant of h1s pending dismissal, qould be more detrimental to the. ?~alth of this ~mpus than the present state of unrest and decay. Th!!i 1s to say nothmg of the fact that we feel Dr. Huntley is mote than capabl~, and commands the needed respect, to hold this campus together for the remainder of the year. · · I~ lieu of these ~ircumstances, we have formulated a proposal whtch wo~ld sen:e m the best interests of the campus. We request the followmg actlon: · . l) ~he resignation of President Bonner; to be effective 1mmedta~ely, as h~ . no longer. has the support <>f the college commumty prereqUistte to effective leadership. 2)·:4- formal petition to Or. Huntley requesting that he accept the appomtment of Acting President. 3) . The formation of a search committee pur.posive to recruit candidates for the offices of President, Provost and Dean of Students. 4). To imp~ore Dr. Huntl~y to retain the position of Acting Pres~dent dunng 1978*79. Thts would enable the search-committee to fmd a president well-suited to the needs and goals of Union College and as well, provide the new president with the time n:ec~ssary to ~cclimate his I herself with our campus. While this is o bv10usly askmg Or. Huntley to take on a huge responsibility, we fee.l that only he can command the respect and confidence needed to · _ umfy the campus in this time of distress. 5) To inaugurate the new president in the Fall of 1979.

Director of Physical Plant In the course of one year under a Bonner administl:ation, there was a 27 percent turnover in personnel. No matter what motivated each individual departure, the implication is clear and loud and it does not say much good about the present executive branch of out' campus. It. is of great interest to note that President Bonner was. approached. by Acting Dean Nydegger on this matter. Says Nydegger, .. 1 addressed this question directly to the Presiaent who was unable to name 17 people who would have been involved in this ... \ (see Nydegger interview) In light of the fact that the Oampus Voice has devot(?d this issue solely to mtJtters concetning President Bonner, we felt it only fair to give him an opportunity to present his views.

I am not Q: One of tlu basic problems at Union stems from ~isagreenient on the role of athletics on campus ~ there is a great need for the standardizatio11 of admissions procedures and an overall policy- setting for the conflict of interests that athletics and academics seem to produce. rtaditionally, Union has· placed the greatest emphasis on academics but a new interest in athletics has been sparked by · the creation ()f a first rate hockey team. Y~»'ll stated in \Concordiensis\ that while at Rice Universi:t;y you participated in a situation in which academics and four Division l sports coexisted and one in which no admission irregularities occurred.

What was Unfortunate, in a small student body like Rice, was that the athletes were recruited on : standards and on criteria that were vastly different than those of the other stu<lents. lf they tume(\ out to be decent students it was often times simply a .matter of coincidence.

I know . for a fact that the President has read and will read the issues of Concordiensis and that he is aware of the opinions. I hope that I am able to communicate to him the degree to which these Q: ls President Bonner still capable of leading this school in lieU of the erosion of his credibility'? A: President Bonner and I have discussed this; he feels strongly that he can regain the confidence of the faculty, students and administration and pull the college together in such a way th1lt we can, in fact, be unifed and progress towards the gQals that we set for ourselves. I think in all reasonableness that we have to reserve judgement on tl:lat. I'm not sure that it can be done - I d'on:t know. Perhaps only time will tell on that. I think we have to be very careful and avoid rash decisions one way or another. To immediately claim that it's impossible and can't be done and therefore, immediate resignation should occur, or to say, \Okay we'll forget that the issues ever occurred, we'll give you another chance,\ are two alternatives which are not acceptable. We need to be open to· the President's ideas, we need to ask him questions that need to be answered, and I think time will tel'l whether or not President Bonner can unify the .campus in spirit and purpose. fiscal solvency and til~ ,essential · l'm not saying that we .shoUld character of the college. ne forget ·things that have happened. issues that perhaps underlie some But rather than focussing in on of the events of last .year certainly events, let's get beneath the event-s Carl Bernstein on the Hotbeds of Union must be addressed, must be to. the issues t:hat surround them, ..bY \-ertraJt wJI~am~ out all the dirty laundry of Union answered, and must be resolved. su<:h as .. clarification of the · NOTI~: The foll~wmg 1s an College. and hang it on the line for We can put the events beh~d us .. responsi~ility of adffi.inistr~to~ to !luthe~ttc tr_ansc~tpt ?f .. an the American public to see.

It was suggested that the cost of these damages be included on each student's bill as a separate item. The feeling was that this approach might cause the vandalism to be noticed and help dampen the problem. Some felt that this too would cause problems. It didn~t seem right for this item to appear on an incoming Freshman's b i 11, considering that thej were not on campus when the damages took place. It was also felt that this might not solve the problem and may only serve to upset parents. This matter will be discussed further at future meetings. Last weekend's concert was the next topic discussed. Concern was expressed over the four thousand dollar loss absorbed by the Social Committee. The .possibility of greater controls ,over committees was suggested. It was stated that the Forum has the right to reverse any decisions made by committees and that maybe the Social Committee should be required to report on any large expenditures. This was ·~ot accepted because it was expressed that the Forum should have confidence in the Social ·Committee, even though they may have miscalculated expen- ditures for this concert. They did, however, feel that losses of this magnitude should be of major concern. The last topic .of this meeting was presented by a representative from the Audit Committee. He expressed a need for greater control over supplies purchased with Student Activities · fees. Some examples were electronic and dark room photography equipment. Some of this equipment is being used by students for their private use. At the present time there is no ·definite policy concerning dam- ages to this equipment. At the next meeting an explicit proposal concerning this will be made. The next Forum meeting will be held Monday, October 31 at 8:30 in SS llO. The election for Senior Class Representative will be held on Thursday between 8:00 -~-m.-6:00 p.m. Szarkowsld has conducted many major surveys, inc::luding responsible for the terms of office meetings.

~Page 2 '1., EDITORIALS Applause The Union College Board of Trustees met on campus this past weekend to contemplate many of the conrmversies Which are presently facing this institution. In a move sH:ongly applaude.d by Concordy, the board voted for a presidential review of Pres1dent Bonner (see story on page I). Concordy hopes that the Chairrnan of the Board, Samual B. Fortenbaugh, who will charge an independent corporation with the review of Dr. Bonner, will direct its focus on the President's activities of the past 8 months, in the context of his overall term. Moreover, it is imperative that all campus parties, students, faculty and admiili3trators, be given the opportunity to express their opinions regarding the current status of the President with implications to the future direction of this institution. Concordy also believes that a forum can now exist for former Dean of Students, Mark W. Smith, lo release tach backing his allegations and charges of Presidential 1mproprietie~. This forum may too sanction and solidify the diversity ot opinions ensuring a fair appraisal of the President and his actions. Concordy hope~ that the campus will now he able to return to its prime mot1ve education, and leave the disruptive politics of last ~pring behind.

If not, they should oe damn sure that the losses are kept to a minimum and the attendance to a maximum. 2) It's high time the COC assumes an assisting role in aiding major committee decisions, especially those in which Student Tax money is concerned. After all, if the COC doesn't look after the administration of committees, how can the Tax Committee be expected to look after theirs? It's one thing to have the COC run the other committees, it's another to have them assist .in their operat-ion and foresee administrative, financial and; or internal political problems.

The Road Back Through all tllat has transpired over the 1ast year or ~o. no one, with any measure of real confidence, has been able to say that Union was on the road to recovery. Ar, the meeting you've heard so much about and anticipated so hopefully, the Board of Trustees ha~ taken steps thiit .permit others, besides Pollyannas, to feel ~uch confidence. · By unanimous vote the Trustee\ have directed the chairman and anyone he choos~s to work with to tak.e the fir'>t steps of Presidential Review. He is to report to the Executive Committee meeting in New York City on Dec. 7th what outside bodi6 are capable of performing this kind of review, ho~ much they would charge, how long such a review \H>uld take, a.nd other necessar~ logistical questions. Those present (probably a. ~ignificatlt portion of the whoie board) will then vote upon which of the \.ariou~ review procedures are best for the college. In the minds of the Trustees what is at this point best for the college is that pr.ocedure which emuFes a fair review of thi-. situation a.t the earliest possible date. Re.cognizing that man) of la~t year's questions were not addressed with the depth they warranted and that new, volatile issues had arisen, the Trustees have concluded that the on'ly measure that will effective'ly a\ert the maintenance of campus unrest or even ih escalation is a fair, reasoned, review of the situation. The president is at the heart of the situation and so he and. the t'ole of the pre~idency will be at the heart of the review. We have been told, and we believe that this favorable turn of events owes a considerable debt to the immeme ~:untribution students have made. The Trustees could hardly ignore dissent that was so responsibly expressed. The tact that v.e received 0\er 300 letters (aH but 6 eKpressing at least enough dissension ll'l call for a presidential review) e\tinguished all tllusions of tranquility on the campus. Furthermore, t.he idea prop.osed by so many ~tudenh coincided with an idea that some of the Tru~tees had bandied about among themselves. As more and more letters clammed for a review, ~everal of the Trustees began to see the mcrii in an idea that might have died for want of impetus. In conclusion, we would simply like to congratulate ~tudents who took the time to write on the succe~s of their effort'>.

Even if he is innocent of an charges. h1s presence at Union and the turmoil that surrounds it will: l) Take students• minds off studies (as mine has been in the past few days) and put them on this issue and 2) Keep competent administrators away from Union College.

SCACCIA In an effort to bridge the gap between Union alumni and the campus community, the Alumni Council, who sponsors Homecoming Weekend, is offering many actlVlties and programs · throughout this weekend's festivities that draw interest from both the alumni and the students. In fact, a majority of this year's schedule· is open to everyone. • In past years, many people have regarded Homecoming as a Satt,trday 'afternoon football game surrounded, and often precluded, by each individual's indulgence of his favorite beverage,. whatever that might entail. 1;1 owever, this year students are encouraged to involve themselves in a broad \Scope of the carefully planned activities. For instance, although The Academic Briefing Session at 3 o'clock Friday afternnon is geared to alumni, it is obvious that many students would. gain much understanding of the Liberal Learning Program by attending. Also of general interest are \So You Want to Go ·into Management,\ \Artificial Heart Valve Project,'' the \Walter C. Baker Lecture,\ \Union's Athletic Program and Chalk Talk,\ the \Departmental Receptions,\ the \Tail Gate Picnic,'' the \Men's Glee Club Concert,\ and, of course, all of the athletic events. As is plainly evid¢nced by the Homecoming schedule. the range of activities should be fulfilling in ail aspe<,:ts: academically and in t e II e c t ua II y, so cia 11 y, athletically, and culturally. Of coijrSe, preceding all of these factors are the elements of pure fun and enjQyment. Besides attending various· activ.ities, students are encouraged to take an active role in the Homecoming program and subsequent programs to be carried out by the Alumni Council. Some of the programs now available for student participation include the. Career Resour.ces Program, the Alumni Adm~ssions. Representatives~ and an endeavor to initU!te the· reinvolvement of . alumni at Union. Students will allio be needed on a volunteer basis to servF as tour guides, ushers, and babysitters for events s.uch as Homecoming. As indicated above, the When · Father Felago first arrived in. Japan, he didn't speak Japanese. \That v.resented a problem. I .spent t:wo years studying to improve myself in that area.... Father Felago now speaks Japanese fluently. While he worked there, he had enough \mastery ·Of the language to be able to counsel callers on the .telephone and to aid homeless teenagers. \Inferno\ in Fox House Alumni Council has been organizing many f11ture activities •.

But I'd say that .J. learned more about their culture than they learned about mine .... Father Felagp said that he decided lo visit Union so that he could share his experiences in another part of the world with some stud~nts here. \This is the second timt;l l've been here,\ 'he said. ''This is a beautiful locale, by MITCHELL WOLIN A little past midnight on Sunday, October 23rd, there was a small fire on the first floor of the south half of Fox House dormitory. The fire was accidentally started by cigarette ashes that were flicked into a garbage <:an filled with paper items (amon~ other things). The garbage can caught fire and was moved out of Room 155 into the corridor. Once it was in the corridor, attempts were made to use the hall fire extinguisher to put out the blaze.

Aside from the astonishing fact that none of the students present at the time of the .original flareup knew how to operate a fire extinguisher (a skill tapid1y acquired by sorrre in the pursuance of the \perfect water fight\); it is similarly amazing that someone would drop live ashes into, a wastebasket laden with 'flanitnables.

Semerad, who died Sunday, October 16 at Cohoes Memorial Hospital. Semerad, 62, had been a professor of law at Alhany Law School since 1945 and had been Dean since 1975. He was an expert on trusts-, estates, artd contracts, and among numerous other positi.ons, an editor of the State Bar Association Law Digest. Semerad was also often con~ulted by members of the State Le.gislature and Executive branches in his field of · specialization. Dean Semerad was a graduate of Union in 1935 and received his J.D. degree from Harvard Law School in 1938. He also served on the Board of Trustees from 1964 · to 1972. President Bonner; chancellor of Union University, expressed his regret at Dean Semerad's death. \Ralph Semerad enjoyed the professional respect and personal admiration of his colleagues. His contributions to Union began during his undergraduate days and continued t~ enrich Union University throughout his career~\ A memorial service for Dean Semerad was held at ll A.M.

Peller, the consort's director and counter-tenor. began his musical career as a chorister at Canterbury Cathedral and later won a choral scholarship to St. John~s College, Cambridge. In 1962, he joined the Deller Consort and made the first of many records with them and in duo with his father. This is the consort's first North American tour under Mark Deller Consort at Union Stratford-on-Avon. Jean Knibbs, who is making her second tour of North America with the consort, studied singing and piano in her native Wales before winning a scholarship to the Royal College of Music in London. She has sung with the B,BC Symphony Orchestra and the English Chamber Orchestra at the Royal Albert Hall, and performs contemporary vocal music as well. Rosemary Hardy, who studied at the Royal College of Music and the Franz Liszt Music Academy in Hungary, also performs with the Wilbye Consort and recently toured with the Kent Deller's leadership.

Dutch- men soccer team turned jnto this week's ice-.cold Dutchmen losing their Jrd consecutive game to an obviously Weaker opponent. This time it was the B4ntams of Trinity who handed Union yet another 2l- I loss. A beautiful sunny day with: temperatUres in the niid-60's greeted tM travelling looters when they arrived in Hartford on Saturday, After having their Colgate game postponed due to Daley field's wet condition, Union players Were eaget to \come Ol!t flying\ according to Junior Peter Handy after their week layoff. This is exactly what occurred as Union dominatecj the game with accurate passing demonstrating that'they were clearly the~ better team. Finally; Jamie Hilton who was moved from halfback to forward· for the game as a result of Coack Magee's \sba.keup skillfUlly placed a rebounded shot into the left corner of the .net. Tllis ~mly executed goal gave the Dutchmen the halftime lead for the first time a.ll year. Union•s defense had been • giving Freshmen, first time star~er, John Angelotti all ~e protection he needed. in the nets, and eyed their first shutout as the second half started. However, a quick Trinity goal .off a corner 'kick ended that hope, thus Union needed anothc:r go,al that · they Wf1re never to obtain. On Trinity's only other scoring oppol'tunity of the ffi!lf, a cross was allowed to toll from post to post wbere it was hit in by an oncoming Trinity forward. Union seemed to lose control of their excellent first half passing game. With .30 nlinutes to play, patience might have earned the tying UColl's Bob Hogan moving upfield during second period.

The talented and soccer smart K.ovacs will be out for the rest of the season. This was indeed the biggest loss of all on Saturday. Union, now 3-5, hopes to even out its record by beating Col!Jate and Mi<!dlebury in their next two games. 8inghamton and Kings Point will be their final two games. Meanwhile, the Junior Varsity team coa~;hed by Parker Antin, defeated the Trinity team 2-0 in a game played' right after the Varsity game. Antin, one of.,last year's Varsity tri-captains, has done a fine jdb with this year's 2- 3-l team, whose other win was against Albany State. The goals were scored by Vernon Wetmore on a volley kick off a Jim Berger cross, and on a penalty shot by Berger.

Slavin, coming down to cover his own kick made the score on the play and proceeded to kick his own conversion to put Union ahead\l0-4. The Watertown squad managed to score once more in the first half while capitalizing on a Union mistake. Watertown scored again in the middle of the second half to make the score 16- 10 Watertown and the ever hustling Weasel stuck it right back to him with the help of the cover of his serum to make it 16- 14 still in favor of Watertown. Watertown managed to take out to the wing to score on Union one more time in the 2nd half to make the final score 20-14 Watertown. Special mention must be made to those ever hustling Ruggers, Tony Ward, Mark (Edgy) Edgerton, Mike Paquette, Cliff Cohen and Mike E.'orcier.

The Dutchmen playing without key starters Rich Romer.

Once again however, yards virtually untouched as I the Dutchmen failed to find the Hobart opened a 6-() lead, Later : right formula for getting the ball in the first period Hobart took ' into the end zone as an errant advantage of the first of Union's Terranova pass was picked off at five turnovers as th~y recovered a the Hobart eight and ~;etumed all · the way to the Dutchman 32. Hobart, again taking advantage of a Union turnover, grounded out the remaining 32 yards in eight plays with Davis scoring from the five. The half ended with Union down 18-0 despite a second quarter drive which brought the Dutchmen down to the Hobart 18 · before the Statesmen defense stiffened leaving Union empty- handed once again. Sophomore workhorse Doug Napodano shrugs off Hobart defender. In the second half the Dutchman defense began to stiffen and the majority of the burden was shifted to the offense. Midway through the third period Terranova had the Gamet driving again as they marched their way into Hobart territory, Throughout the day, b~owever, turnovers had a way of ending Union scoring opportunities and sparking Hobart touchdown drives. An interception on the Hobart 37 set the stage for what proved to be the winning tally. Hobart drove to the Dutchman ten where they faced a fourth and . two.

Red-Hot Volleyball Rolls to Five Wins · by LYNN BATEMAN Were those long double sessions of pre-practice worth it? - Were those aching muscles, tight tendons, and generally bruised bodies worth it? Were the sharp, scrutinizing criticizing eyes of Coach Lynne Barta worth it? Yes, yes, and yes!unanimously acclaim Union's women's varsity volleyball team, as these dubious trials have now earned them a five game winning streak, and a growing record of 7-4. This feat could never have been accomplished without all of these \pleasures\, which will be remembered for a long, long time. the honor to begin ag!lin$t winner GMC (which was humorous because Union had picked GMC to be the underdog), but there was really no cause for worry as Union beat the Green Mountain girls by the scores of 9-15, . 15-4, 15-ll. Then came HVCC, the team to beat, and beat they were by Union in two quick and pitiless games, 15-1, and 15-3. Cathy Reals picked up ten beautiful points in the first game, while in the second game the women split the points a little more fairly with Diana \Gaz\ · Gatzolo taking nine straight and Liz- Yager finishing off with six. The Union seniors of the team thought that this day would never come and viet ory was very sweet. Davis (22 carries for 143 yards) scored his third touchdown from five yards out and the Statesmen ~were finally able to add the extra point, making the score 25-0. In the next series the Dutchmen were once again able to move the ball; this time with th~ aid of a , Star Freshman receiver, Henry \Elmo\ Wright rough:ing the kicker penalty. Again the result was a first and goal from the nine. An unsuccessful · run followed by three incomplete passeS resulted in yet another drive without a score. With the game now headed into the fourth quarter the Dutchmen put their aerial attack in high gear and Terranova,. amidst constant pressure from an aggressive Hobart defensive line, began to connect with his outstandin.g crop of receivers. He spotted freshman sensation Henry Wright (8 catches, 130 yards) on a 41 yard bomb and then hit Mike Wroblewski, who added yet another il! H. long line of acrobatic catches, . with an eight yard scoring toss with 12:01 remaining. A jarring tackle from freshman Chet Krinsky forced a fumble on the ensuing kickoff which freshman Andy O'Connor recovered to ·give Union a first down on the Hobart 25. Two · more passes to tbe sensational Wright gave Union a first and goal from the four where Dutchman halfback Mike Squire knHed over . · for the score. Terranova then bowled his way over for the t\Vo point conversion, putting Union righ.t back into the ~game trailing 25-15. The defense continued to hold and Terranova got the ball right back .. With Wright finally being double covered, Terranova looked for some of the other outstanding though less prolific Dutchmen receivers and he found them. He spotted sophomore tigQt end Kevin Eberly for a bundle to move into Hobart territory and then, with uncanny accuracy, latchecl on to junior receiver Kevin Frederick from the 19 yard line for a final tally with 3:59 left on the clock. Hobart was not about to be The streak started with the win against North Adams which is already recorded. Nex.t was Albany State, longtime rivals to many of Union's teams. Union allowed Albany to stretch the match to four games by letting them win one, then put them away in a no-contest match. This competition was just a warm-up for an even more potential power to come two days later, Hudson Valley C.C. For the past several years, HVCC has been a great threat on the volleyball scene, creating anxiety wherever their name was breathed. It was in this awed but defiant spirit that Union was to face the \valley of the giants\ in a tri-match with Green Mountain College last Thursday night. Imagine the wonder then, when unrated GMC defeated this bastion of volleyball power in a see-saw battle, Union thco bad, Siena College, the next team on the schedule, must have been unaware of the rolling wheels of the Garnet Machine. or they surely woUld have cancelled their match in order not to be crushed beneath the hot tires. As. it was they f_iled into the fieldhouse, serenely ignorant of what was to happen to them - and it did as they were struck down by the merciless spiking of Jill Thomson, Sheila O'Donnell,. Liz Yager, and Diane Roncin; set up by Diana Gazzola, Amy Juchatz and Cathy \Hustler\ Reals; and served to again and, again by Katherine Maher and Audrey Stein. Union happily took the match in three games, IS-10, IS-S, 15-3, thanks to fantastic spiking and quick saves by the team. Some nice Volleyball star Amy Juchatz moves for block at net. , stopped however . as they sent their two big backs Davis and Cooney (30 , carries, 119 yards) repeatedly into the line where they slowly grounded out yardage to run out the clock. On the day Hobart amassed 313 yards rushing as they needed to throw the ball but six times enroute to their fifth victory of the ye:;tr. The Dutchmen on the other hand found running the ball to be an extremely difficult chore against the Hobart defense as they totaled only 106 yards ruslling. They still, however, won the offensive battle as Terranova connected for 2.67 yards liitting on 18 of 32 passes, including a fourth quarter in which he hit on 13 of 15 passes in a phenomenal display. As good as Union's ground game is~ its passing game appears to be nothing short of unbelievable. Even with starting wide receiver Joe Poletta watelling the game from the bench, the Dutchmen receivers led by Wright and Wroblewski ran rings around a Hobart defensive backfield which was always one step too slow. serving was performed by Cathy Reals, Sheila O'Donnell and Audrey Stein as they each captured 5 or more points apiece. Diana Gazzolo proved that her setting was once again inimitable, showing good judgement .in a difficult position. Union if' pleasantly surprised by this streak of five Wins, and hopes to continue it against a very tough opponent away on Thursday. With a little luck, hard practice, inspiration from our fans and some help from Above, we will be another ungracious guesr and defeat our next host. New Paltz.
