Ploughing t.hr:ough fhe line of the fo-Gtball tea~n :sent to play Union here last Saturday by the Col· lege -of the City of New York, the Garnet eleven scored with such frequency in the first half that the ga1ne lost interest to players and spectator~ alike. This, and the fact that practically t:he en- tire second team played the 1naj-or part ·of t.h·3 ·s~cond half, explainB the fact of fewer ·scores i:1 that part ·of the game. The New York team was lucky to secure five points as they ·did, and thl~ Beare is n1ore to Union's discredit .than to C. C. ~. Y.'s goo-d playing. The accident happened in the n1iddle of t!he first half, when the ball was ln C. C. N. Y.'s posses·Bion at midfield. A forward vass was attempted and wa.g fumbled by the Ne\v York forward. A general scran1·ble for the bat~ ensued, in which the entire backfield of the Union defence joine·d, leaving the field clear f·or a p.oten- ·The game was ·called at 3 ~ 15, the two tea1ns having made their appearance a few minute:s pre- viously.

Owing to t.he inferi·or playing of the visitors it waB hard to tell the quality of football that was being put up by the Garnet team, although thJs see·med very ragged at times it wa·s due in a large 1neasure to the careles,sness resulting fron1 the playing against the ea.sy tean1 .of Ol)ponents. No one s'hone on the Garnet tea1n as a brilliant star, aB all the players given .the ball were abL~ to 111ake large gains at almost any point t 1 hro-ug·n the New York line. Potter played his usual coE- sistent game, and Hequembourg carried the ball on mo·st of the gains. In the second half the second .team was put in, and all of the player;:; demonstrated their ·superiority over the visitor.:;, although not in the same degree shown by 'Var-sity. Jewell played the quarterback positio~1 with good judgment when placed there near the end of .the second half, and showed good ability both in carrying the ·ball and in n1aking tackles. being ·Caught by Streibert and carried over for a touchdown. Potter kicked the goal, after the kickont ha:l been heeled. Score: Unio-n, 11; C. C. N.Y., 0.

New York'1s :fir·st play· was an attempted forward pass, which re:Bulted in a loss, as the end fai le·d to touch the ball on the pass. Uni-on again received the ball and Hequembourg n1ade a g.norl gain on an end run. By line plays the hall ·was advanced ·well into the enemies' territory. Th 9 f·orwa:rd pass to T·ompkins was worked for a. gain of ten yards, and again being atte1npted would have proved /SUccessful, except for the fact th:at the Union lines·rnen ·were off rside and a pen- alty resulted that gave the hall to C. ·C.

Har'd 1)ressed, Ne·w York at- tempted the forward pass, an .attempt that was fraught with wild fumbles, first by .the New Y.ork end and then by the Union players that ran in t'1 help out the Garnet 1nen on the play. In the. r~::­ sulting e·onfuBi·on a New York player !SCrambled from under the heap of combatant:s and ran down a clear field .thirty yards for a touchdown. The goal was ·not ldcked. Score: Uni·on, 17; C. C. N.Y., 5. New Y·ork kicked off to Streibert and a success of line plays and end runs quickly ·brought th,-:1 pigskin to 1nidfield. Here McNab ma,de a pretty end run for a gain of thirty yards. Line bucks were used with ·continued succes~s and in a few n1inute;s Hequembourg, who caught a forward pasfs, crossed the goal line for another .touchdown. Potter kicked the goal. :Score: Union, 23; C. C. N.Y., 5. New York kicked off to Vogt and Union was rus'hing the ball through the line of the Ne .. ~s York tea1n for large gains when time ·was called for the end -of tlJ.e first half. Score: Union, 23; C. G. N. Y., 5. The second :half was marked by the rapid with- drawal of the 'Va.rsity 1player~s and the- substitu~ tion of the S·ec·ond team men, ThfB· was not con- ducive to the running up of a large score in thB fseco-nd half as the players 'hardly had time to ac- con1modate then1selves to one series of changes in tbe 1ine-up before another would be n1ade. Fum 1Jles ·consequently were frequent :and rthere was a .superabundance of ·off..:slde playing, due to the anxiety of the men to get ·off ·before the ba:! I. New Y.ork started their half by kicking ·off t:J Union, ·who·se fold .ta,ctics. continued to be goo·d f.or large gains, and in .a very short time the New York line had again been cros·sed ~or a. touc'i:l· down.

Union Uned up but ·was penalized fifteen yards for off-s-i·de 'WOr1{, !bringing tihe ball to the Garnet three yard lin~'. Potter\ made a pretty punt from here~ but C.

A drop kick was. tried for goal, but t 1 he ball :$ailed bel·ow the crossba•s and Potter kicked. out fro1n Union's twenty ,.yard line on the next play. Fun1bling a forward pass, New York .again lost the ·ball to Union. Union also took a hand at fumbling and lost the ball to New York on an atten1pted forward p.ass. New Y·ork, in ·spite of the bad luck attending the tplay, .again atten1pted the same formation. This time Pot- ter was located in the proper position and roped in tbe ball before the C. C. N.

PROSPECTS FOR TO-DAY'S GAME. Accon1panied by a large portion of the student hody, the football team left for Clinton this mo.rn~ ing and this afternoon one of the iliardest contests of the year ·will be f·ought on the Hamil ton Col· lege ·campus. Hamilton is deter;lnined to win to retrieve. the loBs of the R1ochester game, in ·which .they were beaten by a 1score of 26 t-o 9. Concerning the gam0 Hamilton \Life\ said: \La.st Saturday, Hamilto11 ~met -defeat at the hands of Rochester by a score of 26·9. 'I'he de- feat was -due not at .all to the 1shai\p and fast play ing of Ro-chester, but to the listless, 1He1e·ss, and apathetic playing -of our own team. \A -detailed ac-count of the g.an1:e would reveal only the fact tha;t Hamilton lost her chance;s to 1soore through loose playing and ~did not play fa:~t enough to stop Rochester''s attack.\ Hamilton, however,. put up a different quality of football in the g•ame against Lafayette, and won the admiration of the larger university by t.lw steadiness of their :playing . Tlhe \Lafayette\ says of this game·: \There .was .a real game of football on March Field, l~Bt :Saturday, when Lafayette defeated the strong Hamilton team ;by .a .score of 43 to 0. \The game was hard from e;very ,standpoint and the score ·bY no ·means illustrates the clo-seness :of the contest. Greatly ·outweighed, the visiting eleven played gamely from .start to finish, but the Lafayette .syiBtem was too n1 uch fo-r it. From the s~pectator,s.' viewpoint, ;the game was intensely in~ teresting and exciting, f.or long runs and sharp de-fense br-ought the ·spectators to their feet cheer~ ing 1nany times. The loyal little bunch -of Hamil~ ton !'looters won the admiration of the Lafayee0 ln:-der-graduate.s by their ·cheerin.g and ·singinq; during -a loiBing game. Thus the Hamilton eleven is :somew'hat of a proble,matical quantity, and .the final ,solution fl'Oril the Garnet standpoint will come this afternoon. Hamilton's record to ·date .is: Sept. 28-Cazenovia S., 0; H-amilton, 32. Oct. 2-0ornell U., 23; Ham:ilton, 0. Oct. 5-St. Lawrence U., 0; Ha.n1i1ton, 10. Oct. 12-LaFayette C., 43; Ham.ilton, 0.

King '08, who was not elected manager until this fall, has found the time very sho-rt in which to arrange games, hut he has done remarkably vvell in sc 1 heduling dates ·so as not to oo·nfiict with the other c·olleges. Nearly all 1nemberB of the o l:l team are back in college and there is plenty of · Freshn1ea n1nterial to draw from. The old ID·€11 include ex\'Ca.ptain Sl<lutler '08, Starbuck '09, Brown '09, Buck '10, Hequembourg '10, and Au- :~ = r::: o ~1 ' 1 0. The schedule of the games to date is: December 1-R. P.

February 19-Ha.milton at SclheNectady. February 29-N. Y. U. at Schenectady. March 6-7-~. Y. U. and Rutgers, ·On trip. Besides the-se .scheduled games, Manager King ha.B hopes of 1naking ·s.a.tisfa.ctory arrangements fo1' games with Pratt Institute, Fordham, Ver- nlont and other tean1s. Several of the dates are practically agreed upon already. The. ahs·olnte honor system adopted at Yale a year ago has proved a failure and was abolished last week. The weal{ness of the system lay in its lack of any method of trying a man accused of its violation. Public opinion was the only means of dealing ·out pnnishment, and as a man is considered innocent until proven guilty, it at once becomes evident why the Yale men coul~l not condemn a fellow student on mere suspi-cion, without investigation and trial. Coach Ten EycJ\: of Wisconsin is making ar- rangements for an interclass rega·tta on I~ake Mend·ota on the morning of the day of the foot- ball game with Illinois. '

At the last meeting o·f the Bo,ard -of Trustees the Board approved the suggestion n1.ade through Dean Rillbon s·ome time aga, authorizing the ex- pansion ·of t:he Catal·ogue into a colle..;e bulletLl of four numbers. At the present time the College catalogue and the University Quarterly are the only official Col- lege paJpeTs and these have proved very inadf.:· quate and unsatisfactory as a n1eans of ·Official vublicity. The idea of a College bulletin was con- ceived son1e tilne ago; and :since the college ope11· ing in Septernber the officials have been ·working out and perfecting the l)lans. While it has been practieaHy 1u1own for son1e time that the bulk- tin wouh;l be establh3hed, the authorities would n0t UNION'$ FIRST ALUMNI. give out an official staten1ent e·arlier because of In ·a little country cemetery situatecl on a the fact that Dr. Alexander and the Board re- fused to definitely express their attitudes. gently sloping hill about ten miles fron Sche- nectady there is a marble shaft, which marks the final resting place of the bo{1y of Rev. Joseph Sweetman, D. D. Dr. Sweetman was graduated fro1n Union Col- lege in the class of 1797 ,the first that She ever .sent out into the world. He was, too, tl1e valeclic- torian of his class and the only member to re- ceive in after years the degree of D. D., and to 'be elected into membership in the Phi Beta Kappa Society. So he is rightfully called the first grarluate of Union College. It is to our first alumnus that we are indebted for a great p.art of our l{nowledge about tl1e in- fancy of the College. It is he Yvho has given us our only authoritative description of 1Jnion's first ·co1n1nencement exercises. The story oQf that graduation was told in a quaint, pleasing style in his address delivered in 1845 at the semi-cen- tennial anniversary of the college. An extract from his speech on that occasion will show his deep regard for the goDd old Col- lege he l·oved. of 'the very He said, \I aiJ.1 here, a remnant infancy of Union Co liege. My ;;:;trength is weakness, my day is closing·, the sbacles of night are coming.

This nu1nber will ·be sent to all off .th'3 alun1ni, and i·B expected to review 1nen1ories of Union in the ·oldest graduate, and ·redound to the benefit of ·college .and individual. The fourth copy will be the com1nence1nellt num·ber and will eontain .in great part the sub· stance o.f the con1mencement \Quarterly\ in fuller forn1.

THE CONCORDIENSIS GREAT ADVANCE IN STATE .FOHEST WORK. \Forest work carfi.ed ·On by the States y,n.ade greater advance €luring 1906 than il!1 any previous. year\ is the encouraging report of the Forest Service in review.ing tlhe 1prindpal achievemeNts of the year in fo.restry for the Y earbnok ·Of the Departn1ent of Agriculture.. \M.ore than 20 States n·ow have forest officers, an-d 10 :have State fore,st re~s.ervations. '''Within the ·boundary ·of thei ~Gat.­ skHl Preserve in New York there are 92,708 aGres of :State lands and 483,412 acres privately owned: the total area of ·the A:d-irondaek Preserve is 3,313564 acres, of ·whic.h the State now · owns 1,34 7,280 acres. \Under .the law of 1905 t'he ·superintendent oE forest's was able to ·patrol the State preserves .efficiently during the dry iSeason at small expense. To supply stock for planting in the preserves the State maintains three, large nur,series for ·conifers in Franklin County and one f·or hardwoods in Ul-ster Gounty, tn the CatskiUs. The three Adi- rondack nurseries co1nbined have a capacity o0f a million 3-year-o.Jd transplants per annum. On•3 of the1.-a·e, the Saranac Inn Nursery, was established. by the State in 1903 and the others, Axton anJ Wawbeek, were first establishe·d by the Cornell College of Forestry and were placed in charge of the State fore,st .commis·sion in the spring of 190,6. Five plantaUons, embracing an area of 1,500 acres, have been planted. In 1905 an·d 1906, 50 acres of pines and spruces were~ planted by the seed-iB1pot method ·With encouraging re-sults ..

Corbin will serve in that capacity, and for the affirmative, Hanigan '08, Faust '09, and his colleagues on the con1n1ittee will be, revrc- The Philomatheans 1 have for the subject at that tiin.e \Resolved That I11tercollegiate Athle~ s·2:1tativa,B of the various fraternities and th2 neutral body, ·selected by their or.;anizati·ons, from the class of 190'9. Cavert '10; for the negative, Wright '08, Wal- rath '09, and Lent '09. The Adelphic topic is, \Resolved T'hat Colleg;e and University property ·slw•uld be Taxed on the San1e Conditions as Other Real Estate.\ Th•:: a ffirrnative ·will be compo.sed of Weyrauch '08, Grover '1 0, McGill '10.. The negative will b,; c·ompoBed of La Cro·sse '0.8, Millias '09, Carmich · ael '1 0. There has been considerable agitation relative to the 'holding of several intercollegiate debates this season. If possi-ble, the Rutgers Debate will be held earl.ier this year than has heen the cus- tom, and in a·ddition .to this it is 11oped that arrangc·men ts can be 1n:ad~ with ';:lome of th3 near-by c,olleges for debates. Arrangements will soon be ·completed by tlle Adelp·hic ·S·ociety for their debate against t'he Parker S·ociety of Al- bany Law :School. As an ·off-shoot of the Parker Debating Society ·in the Law School the Bates Debating Society • bas recently sp·rung into existence, and it is rum·ored that the members desire to meet one of the c·ollege organization in the ·near future. Neg.otiati·ons have a·.:; yet not been opened. Student;:; at a number o,f the elasses on the day of the Han1ilton football game were rather a minus quantity. That dtd not prevent a num- ber of recitations fr01n being conducted as usual, however. 'The Pr.on1. will in all probability take plac'~ on the Friday night of Junior \Veek-that is, on the fourteenth of February next. If the present plan.s are carried out the dance will be held ~n the Ten Eyek I-To tel, in Albany. As yet the Sophon1·ore class has taken no deft· nite action on the n1.atter of eJ:ecting a chairn1a 1 1 of the new Sophon1·ore Hops Con1n1ittee. The class finds difficulty in detennining ·on a plan ·of concerted action on the n1atter, owing to the faet that all -o·f the n1en wh·o have been considered as being capable of filling the posi Uon, ·see1n to con- si-der that there is a bnrd~n ·Of odinn1 connected with the chairmans'hip of the hops eon1n1itteP. Without doubt the underclassn1:en will con1e to some sort of an agreen1ent upon the n1atter dur- ing the comh1g week. If they do not the Juni·or Class has expresse·d its willingne·.ss to continue the series of minor dances, as has been the cus- tonl of that cla:Ss heretofore, so that a 'hop will doubtle-ss be schaduled for the near future. T'here will be an election ·Of a ·captain for the Freshman baseball tean1 early in the week. 1911 is bound to retrieve U1e loss at f.oothall by get- ting ·out on the diamon·d :first in the Spring;. Tl1ere is n1uch good baseball timber in the ~n­ tering ·clas.s this year, if .ru1nors .are true.

6 THE CONCORDIENSIS THE ROCHEST:ER G,A,M:E 'Varsity ~meets Rochester ·en the Can1p:as thi.3 afternQon. The Rochester team is ·said to ba a strong aggregation and ~coach Tenney expects th-a:t the wearer:s of the g.a1'net -will be com.pelle~.l to exert then1selves .to theh~ u tn1ost to ·win. The Rochester team defeated Hm'llilton early ill the ·season by a score of 26-9,. and 1 held the .stro,ng Army tean1 to 30 points, although. they dkl. not score. There i.s no ·doubt that Han1ilt.on ha:s im- proved greatly :since the Roche·iSte;r tean1, so vic- tory oHght to go t·o Union. ~Rochester this seas·on has pl;ayed ·seven gaines, each with such a different ~sco.re, that it can easily be seen ·what a :prob~e1natical quantity Uni·on will play against to-day. T'he scores are: Sapt. 28.-Rochester 6, SyracuJ3e 40. Oct. 5.-Rochester 7, Niagara 1'6. Oct. 8.-Rochester 0, Colgate 41. Oct. 12.-Rochester 5, St. Lawrence 0. Oct. 19.-Rochester 26, Ham.ilton 9. Oct. 25.-Rochester 0, Army :30. Nov. 2.-Rochester 11, Hobart 6. Roche!ster'.s line-up against Union to.:day wil.l probably be as follows: . Rocheste,r. Position. Union. B. Ramaker • • • • • • • • • • • • • t • • • • • • • ••• Tompkins A. Br-own and Captain McNab, of the U11ion tean1, received injuries at . Hamilton 1 that will pro·bably keep them out of the game to-day. Pot- ter ls back in f~or.m .again and ·will probably stay in at l~ft half for the entire ga1ne. HAMILTON 6, UNION 0. Accompanied. by one hundred and fifty students as rooters, 'Varsity went to Clinton la:st Satn1'· day to meet Hamilton on the gridiron. H was a r.niBera ble, r·ainy day and a wet, muddy field that greeted the Garnet w.arrinrs as they carne out for the c.ontest. The cheering and :singin~ of both hleechers wa:s superb, although if any- thing the ·supporters of the Garnet were a little bit 1n~ore in eyidence wWh their yells. The ex· hibition of college ·spirit shown by both crowds was one tha;t would be hard to ex,cel. The ga1ne began by Hamil ton's kicking to Potter who advance·d the ball ten yard.s befoi'e he was d·owned. The Hamilton line was found invincible .and Streibert punted to Capt. Holley- in mid field where he was downed in his tr·acks by Wright. Han1iHon rthen attempted two line plays but faUe·d to gain be~cause .of 1the agility of Tomvkins. Hainilt·on then attempted .a field goal fron~ Union''S 40-yaPd line, ·but this failed, and Union pu.nted out from her 20-yard lin~:;. Hmnilton advanced the hall to Union's 30-yard Left E·nd.

By an ex- change .of punts Union fo-r·ced the ball into Han1- ilton's territory. In a :series of line plunges Hequen1bourg ~and Striebe.rt advanced the ball to Hmnilton's 20-yard line .. Potter, though very weak fro1n illnes·s, vlayed a .plucky game and n1ade .:;everal good ga.in·s. On a forward pass To1npkin;s advan~ced 'the ball ten yards, then Hequernbourg advance.d 1the ball on .a line bHck t.o Han1i1ton's five-yard line. Here with victory in sight, Union was held for down:s, having ad- vanced the ball hardly 1nore than three yards. Han1ilt~on punted ·out of 'danger and tmmed- late1y got the ball on a misjudged forward pa 1 SS. Union then be,came as a stonewall and foreed Han1ilton to punt. With ·renewed vigor Uni() 1

THE CONCORDIENSIS 'J .. plowed down toward Hamilton's goal. Near tho v·osts a costly fumble lost the hall to Han1iHon, and Holley started to punt, being afraid of Unio-n's aggre.ssiveness. The punt was bloeke(1 by \rright and Hamilton'·s end was downed for a loss of 15 yards. The second attempt was hlore succe.ssful and Capt. ::.\1c:.Jab, ·who received ·the punt, advanced for a good gain. Again Union ran away with her oOl)ponents and whP.n time vvas called the ball was 1Jnt a few yards from the Huff and Blue's goal line. The Second Half. In the second half Un.ion kicked o:I to Hanl- ilton. For a time t'he Buff and nine seemed to be running away with Union, bnt in a few ll1·\J· ments ev.Erytlling was changed and the Union line threw Han1ilton hack time after time. This half was almost a repetition ·of the first. Strei- tert made a g.ood tackle by throwing Harper for a loss and a ver'Ling a possible touchdown. Once on a blockeu punt A. Brown ·advanced the ba.U ten yards. About the 1niddle of this half the Hamilton team, by a series of forward passes alHl end-runs !had advanced the ball to Unioa '3 20-yard line. Here they were held for downs, a;1d Streibert punted to Capt. I-Iolley who was forced to the e·dge of the gridiron. Several Union n1en thinking he had gone ont of bonnds, aHowctl hin1 to pas;:; through, and 1nake the touchdown. The go.al was· kicked hy \Vhite. ScorE', F-Iamilto·1 G, 1Tnion 0. On i'he kick-off Union rece.ivecl the ball a'nd had rushed it to Han1ilton's 20-yard line whe11 t ilne was called. • The game was well play~·d on both siJ.e.s. althc;uph Union gained almost twice as mnc'1 ground a::; Ha1nilton and tore up Hamilton's line for fine gain.s nearly every tilne. Of the ~player~, all the Uni-on tean1 were at ·their best. The ends were the star.s if fhere n1igh t l)e any choice ~ll the players. Capt.

8 lN THE MEDlCAL DEPARTMENT (Dr. Tucker's Address). At the forn1al opening of The Albany Medic~tl College this year, the address was delivered by Dr. Wi His G. Tucker, registrar o.f the .c-ollege. He ·chose as his subject, \Educational Dem ')- cracy,\ and delivered hiB address not alone to the eHtering class, but to all of the students of the college. Dr. Tucker began by speaking a few word:; of welcome to the new students and t'he old. His address in part was as follows: \I have bee:l connected with the Albany Medi- ca~ College for nearly forty years, and have had as 1ny associates, the numerous great men of the college who have helped make it fan1·0US in th~ aNnals of Arnerican Medical Colleges. \Let me ren1ind yon that the buildings we pos- sess ar2 not very ilnt~lressive, and they do not, per11alJS, c·on1pare very favorably wit'h the ·showy cxterio.rs ·of rnany of the larger colleges. But the student shGuld keep in n1ind the fact that Bnrronndi:lg.s are not as important to his educa- tion as is the knowledge he acquires. Sn1al1 col- leges are by far the best for educational fa-cili- ti€S. '::-.Jow, to carry on the great work -of education, e:xtar~rdinary facilities are not required, and the employn1e::.1t of genius-es on the faculty is not: an essential to efficient work. Size seem.s to be the Inain idea in the public n1in.d, and this idea has been carried into education, for philan- t'hro11i'Sts, instead of giving to the smaller .and m:are needy institutions of learning, give n1·ore to those that already have n1uch. Thus the b~g m1 iversities are n1ade like trusts, and often fail in their real 1)lHpose b2callS·e of their va:st size, and the increased cost of education to the stu- dent. th>Ough new legislati·o'n regarding fb!e subj:eet was oonstantly being agitated, and fhat tlhe e~amJn­ ing hoard·s w·ere constantly strivtng to rai:s'e th~ stan·darcl.s of knowledg·e ·o·f madi.oal 'in.tS•titution'~ the profe,ssi.on is no better now thaR 1t was twenty~five years ago. He advanced the opinion that new fads in the line o.f special subJects relating to nH~:dicine, mor•3 or les.s ICl()se:.J.y, ought not to •be a:d:de·d pT•e>mh~cn­ ously to the ·CHrri·cnlum, f•or sttch fads .only crowded out S·O·:tRe of the older and n1ote inl· portant work of the course. !He advised the ·omi:sslon ·of a regular college c·ourse for the n1-edieal .student and entrance t:J the medi·cal c-ollege dire.ct from high school. In closing the educational part .of his address Dr. Tucker ad vised .the stud ants· to think fo~· thernselves and that each one devise so.n1~ s~heme for the raisi-ng of the .stan-dard of the college course and t'he betterment of the medi· cal profes:Sion. Then ensued Borne words of advice to the be- ginners. He disappr·oved any class hostility in the ccllege and any boyish frivolities and pranfc~ such as are carried on by the ordinary college ' stude!J.ts. He advised d·ee.p, hard ·study without fear -of dangerB resulting from too strenuo1us application and too little recreation. Dr. Tucker then spoke a few ·W•ords ·On the advantages of the Albany Medieal College .and the positions held in the world of science by its graduates a~1d clo·sed his address with .a repeate•l welcon1e to the students on behalf ·of hin1self and the fa;cnlty. UNUS·UAL HA·Z·ING Men1b0rs of the S·ophom·ore class at Nehra;3ka, having: exhausted all .the eut and dried stunts, s~;Jrang th·e .sensation by herding the under class- \The State Universities as condueted in t'he men into a large r·oom, w·he·re a he:a.rt-to.lheart West have n1any advantages over the ordinary universities, and we should have more conducted on this plan in the future. Money cannot be better expended thall for the education ·of the ve·o-ple .of a given con1munity. and the taxes cau- not be put to better advantage.\ Dr. Tucker told of the .diBadvantage:s resulting to the medical vrofession through the power of the State Examining Boards, and stated that al· talk on the evHs of ignorance and th~ value of education was 111ad,e. The effect wa.s seen a day or two later, when every FreBhman m-ade a perfecl score .in ltcture and study, every man ·was present at chapel and every man cut .out tobacco.. It ·was unheard of ' and, while t'he punishment w:as a little ·har.sh, there has been no indi·cation of relenting on the part ·of the Sophomores.

: I THE CONCORDIENSIS 9 FRESHMEN ARE BEATEN On Friday l·ast the Fre-:3hinan f.ootball teau1 was de-feated ·by the Sophomore eleven, in a v.ery hard .ana well~p1ayed ga.nle. The Freshmen, though ·clearly outplayiag the S.ophmores, had hard luck in t'he se-eond half when on a poor 0/. punt Anderson re-ceived the baH on their fifteen- yard line and carried it .over for a totl·chdown. During the. first half the Freshmen broke thr·ough the S.ophn1ore Hne at will, and w·orked around ·their 01pp-onents' ends f.or substantial gains. Baker 1nade a nice drop-kick which re- sulted in a goal. In the se.c·ond half the :Sophmnores took a brace ·and by punt.:; adva-nced the baH to the Freshman ten-yard line, where they were held for downs. When 1911 punted out Anderson re- ceived the ball and 1nade a touchdo-wn, Potter afterwards kicking the goal. The re·st of the gan1e resulted in no further score. being n1aJe, t'he score standi-ng Sophom.ores 6, Freshmen ,t_ ThB ga1ne decided the re.:lult of the ·caue rush which was a tie.

Seward, class of 1820, is without question :one of th.e most illustrious of the alumni that has ever gone forth from the halls of 01:1 Uni.o.n during her progress of over a c2ntury. tSoon after 'his graduation he was admitted iG the bar and ia hi:s profession quickly won a:1 enviable reputation f.or originality ·of though r, independe::.1ce of action, and industry in hiB legal w·ork. Early in his career ha turned his atten- tion to the })O.li tical questions and probl2n1s of the day. He show-ed pronounced opposition tJ ·slavery and devo.ted n1uch of his tin1e, often fre~ of charge, to the caus2 of its abolition. During his political car2er Seward was elected to t'he Senate of ~ ew York State, and was th2 youngest n1an that had ever been ele,cted to that office. He was governor of the State for four ye:trs, a n1en1ber of the United States Senate fo~· twelv2 years, and Secretary :of State under Lin- c·oln f·or two terms. This office he filled with a;- nl.ost unparaJleled industry, energy, and success. Only such a n1an as Seward could have piloted the Ship of State through suc'h 1perilous tinle.~. A magnifieent tribute has been paid to Scwanl and to Union College by CharleB Emory Smi E1 in his ·spee.ch at the Centennial Anniversary ill 1895. He said: \It is almost a proverb that in earlier years Union had a larger prop-ortion of representatives in public life than any {)ther instituti-on.\ And t'hen he continues, \William H. Seward was at o·nce. the m·ost conspicuous and n1o.st eharacte:·- iBtic product of the federal Union; in the galaxv of American statesn1en he was a star of the fir;:;t magnitude.\ Truly Seward was an alun1nus who has r~­ ftected lasting credit on his Alma Mater. Old Union has had glorlous -days in the past, .an:-1 her prospe.cts are now daily growing brighter. So t'here iB reas.on for the hope that her be::3t days are not in years gone by, but in the futurr:> just ahead. :'.:!: .· ~-· '\ .. ~:. ·r .·,

Dr. Tayler, t'he speaker for to-morrow ,is well known to all of the old~r college n1en. The Christian Association 'h:as hopes of rousing enough interest to have a good representation prrsPnt at the n1eeting. Tnesday evening Bell '08, will complete l1i\.-1 s;:Ties of ta11{S on the \Price of Poverty.\ In these talks the speaker has ·dealt with the condi~ Uons of the exceedingly pnor people of New Y.ork City Tuesday evening's talk will concern its.elf with the n1oral :asvect of the situation.

The 1ne€Ling w;as the first student gathering since the I-lanlilton ga1ne, which practically ev-ery one had attended. Con·s.equently, when CaptaL.1 :VIc~ab arose to speak, he was greetecl I with an ontbnrst of applause. \Scotty\ got un slowlY ~and it was evident that he was very . ' much moved by the loyalty of the students. After a few words he was ,obliged to sit down. Tho student lJod.y gave the long yell to expres:3 their s:nnpathy. Kline gave a shoTt talk on the showing thr> Unioa delegation n1ade on the Ha1niUon Co1leg2 fie-ld, in the line .of cheering and singing. He said that for a visiting college to 11old its ·own on all ad. versary'.s field was rare,. and was n1o.:Jt worth~· of con1n1endation. :>;o ful'th ee bnsine.ss arising, t'he n1in ntes wer2 read, and. t11e n1eeting was adj.ourned. --------- 1907 BASKETBALL Preliminary basketball training started this \veek. an cl the 'Varsity team has been called out for vrac tice four tin1es a week-Tuesday and Thursday aften1nons at four o'.clock and WeJnes~ day and Friday at five. \Bill\ Hard1nan ha·;:; again been ·secured to coach the team, and he expects to turn out n. winning five for Union this season. The schedule as announced two weeks ago has been Tatified, and everything is in readiness to start wo·rk in earnest. The official lJa.sketball guide,' which has ju8t n1ade its a~pvcarance has two cha·nges W·orthy of note, fron1 last year's rules. The first rule ,orders the referee to ·disqualify a player wh0 pushes an ·opponent in the act of throwing Fl. basket. Roughness, it is hoped, will thus be re~ duced to a n1inin1un1. The second change vrovides that in. 1 a lie ge:une play shall l1e continued f.or a period of fivo minutes extra. It is hoped that this will work out to a. nn1ch fairer conclusion than the old system.~ under which prejudiced officials could easily \throw\ the game by calling fou1s. nesi.d.es the 'V,ar·sity basketball squad there .will >' , ' ,, ' ~ I . ~' '' ' ~' ' ( ,· -~ .: . ·'

14 TI-IE CONCORDIENSIS FOUND! On the Campus. Union College, Schenectady, Nov. 3, 19:07. Dear I-i\\~ather:- I want to thank you for the cheek received Friday. The text-books .seem. to be very expensive tt :s terrn, and your check:. was very welcon1e. 1 fE'el sure that if you look 1111 the rates again yo~1 will find that the trip to Clinton is really quite expensive, and that n1y esthnate was not too gre.a t. Hotel expenses were very !high indeed~, and the ga1ne cost us a go·ncl deal-the price of adn1ission being exorbitant in the extreme. A.s yon probably saw by the papers, we were d(~ fe::t~ed, but do not feel a. t all disgraced, as it w1s a fine gan1e and Han1Hton played well. Yes, the chaJ~)el and the Y. M. C.

I 1Hesun1e you know all a bor. ~ then1 so I will not tire yon with a descrip- tion of the interiors. :.vr~r work is progres.si:ng -well, hut I am afraid I mnst be cautious about ·studying as several doctors have said that n1y eyes should not lJ,~ ns::::·d too n1uc:h. I do h.::)pe tbat this will not lower my grades. The new text-books for Bible-study, Rhetoric a1~ :i Hygiene will reon1e soo·n, and I may have to ask for another check then.

THE CoNCORDIENSIS VOL. XXXI. UNION COLLEGE, NOViEMBER 18, 1907 No.7 UNION'S ,EARLY ALUMNL ( Che.ster A. Arthur) . / In the class •of 1848 there g'raduated fron1 Union College at the age of .eightBen a y0ung n1an, who has since ·been des·cribed as \tlE~ most court]y, accomplished, and graceful Presi- dent .of t'he United States since ·the days of iVJ:adison.\ That distingui.;:;lhed alumnus was Chester Alan Ar.thur. All of his education was ·received in Schenec- tady, first at a private academy :and then over on the hill at Uni.on. As .a student he was re- markably popular, and although during his .soph- m.ore and ::1enior years he taught s-chool to lhelp defray his ·college expen:;:;es, he graduated wit!1 1nore than the usual am·011n t of honors. After gTaduation Arthur became prinei:pal of a .school, studying law at the same ti'rne. In 1855 he entered a law offiee and to:ok up tlv~ 1egal profession a:s a partner in a firm •of wide reputation. At the ·outbreak of the Civil War Artlhur w.as appointed quartermaster-general of the N·ew York S.tate troops, and his ·w·a::1 the tremendous task of organizing, quartering, uniforn1ing and equipping her quota ·o.f men. In all he sent fully seven hundred thousand m·en to the f·r.ont to battle, one-fifth of the •entire 1force .thaAt was r-aised. That .the future President fulfilled this office in a !highly efficient m~anner is ·shown by the following statement .of one ,of his comrades: \Let the soldier of New York State first expre:3s his gratitude to the great quarte-rmaster-ge·nera1 who fed and ·clothe-d us, and watched over us with a father's care.\ In this conneC'Uon it is gratifying to note that bo less than three hundred Union College men, graduates and undengraduates, served their coun- try during t 1 he ·civil :strife. Many of thes•e arose to distinction and brought honor to their Aln1a Mater and glory to the flag. Union Oollege nobly fulfilled her mission to the nation in those hours of direst nee:d. A~th.ough no unusual events distinguished Arth- ur's administration as Chief Executive of the United States, he was a {jjjgnified President, al- ways loyal and .patriotic. His sole am. bi t.ion, as cxprescS'ed in a speech of his soon after his inaug- uration was to enjoy the confidence of his con ll- trym.cn. This an1bi.tion was fulfilled to a re· n1arkable degree. The san1e qualities that har1 n1ade him so popular in his college endearr;J him to .the hearts of his people. ROCHESTER 4, UNION 0. Once 1nore t:he Garnet colors were lowered in defeat on the gTidiron for the series of 1907 games, when Rochester, in one of the ·Clo:.:;est contests· of the present scas.on clipped off a vie- tory by tCo.e sco-re of 4-0. after a gan1e that was pregnant with opportunities for a victory. N.o hard luck story attends the history of tlH~ game, a:.s it was a clean, well played contest fro111 both sides. The score cannot be taken as aD accident as i.t was made after an unsuccessful attempt ·of McNab's fol~ a field goal, that WHS only missed because of tlhe .time ta·ken in re- covering a poor 1p.ass fron1 center. R·ochester has a team the equal of Union in every respect, with a capacity for interference and temn work that the· Garnet lacks, due, no doubt to the fact that this is the first year on the gTidiron under the new rules. Union had one opportunity to score in .the first half, and Roch~s.ter twice wa.;; lheld on the five-yard lt-:.e of the Garnet defenc~ without gaining the coverted distance for a touchd-own. Jewell 1playe.ct a fine g·ame at quarterback after McNab was taken out on acc·ount :of injuries, ancl he n1ade :son1e excellent ·running catches of thl~ tricky Rochester .on-side punts.

6 THE CONCORDIENSIS Union had .a 'Slight .advantage on the score or gaining ground, the re·cor.d showing that the Gar- net gained 143 yards ·by line bucking lo Roch- ester's 128, while tlhe gains on punt~ run back were 105 yards ·te 59 yards. The Game. ·Rochester :opene·d the game by kiekin:g ·Off to Streibe'rt ·on U·nion'.s. 5-yard line, an·d he advanc- ed the ball about 10 yards. ·Union was ·held an<l Riggs punted 45 yards to Roches•ter who return- e-d the ball a .short distance. Rochester was hald for downs and Union received the ball in ·mid- field. Union was held and Riggs punted t•o Roch- ester's 20-yard line wlhe:re the ball wa·s held. Rochester then tried .an on-side kick. McNah received .the ball and returned it 10 yards. The.1 by end runs :and line bucks the ball was carrier! to Rochester's 5-yard line where it was lost on C:t fumble. Rochester punted to her 3@-yard line so•on recovering and punting 25 yards. McNab advanced 10 yards. Union was held for downs, and Rochester gained ball on he·1· 35-yard line. Here she was llel'd and l)Un.te.d to Union's 30- yard line. Union was penalized 15 yards ·on ,second ·down, so Riggs punted to R:oches·ter' i3 43- yard line and the ba11 was recovered by Wrigtht. ·Tompkins 1nade 6 ya.rds on a forward pass. After a slight gain Rochester ·w·as penalized 5 yards. Hequmn bouTg n1ade three yards on two play·:3 so Capt. McNab tried a drop kick fron1 Rochester's 40-yard line which failed by a nar- row margin on account .of a poor pa:s.s. Roches- ter kic·ked out fr-on1 .. her 15-yard line to Nellis. M·cNab was injured and Jewell ·replaced hin1. Af.ter no gain in two downs Riggs pun\tcd to Rochester's 30-yard line and the ball was re- turned 5 yards. Rochester was held for downs and 1punted 35 yards out of bounds. Riggs punted to Rochester's 40-yard line and ball was ad- van.cBd 5 ya:rds. An exclhange of punts followed and the half ended with the ball in Roche~i3ter's possession ne.ar the center •of the field. Riggs began the sec·ond half by kicking to Rochester's 20-yard line after Union had been penalized 5 yards for being off side. By an ex- ·change of punts the Rochester .team obtained the hall near the eentre of tlha field and rushed it down to Union's 5 -yard line where they were he~;I for downs. Afte·r Rigg:B' punt Rochester again rushed the ball ~or downs. 'Tompkins was here replaced by MiUer. On Rigg.s' pl!lnt out, Joy made a fair ·catch on Union's 35~yard line an:<!!. Pray kicked a beautiful and difficult field goal. Score Roches·ter 4,. Union 0. Riggs kicked ·off to R.ochester's goal line .and the ball was advanced 10 yards.

The whol-e s~tory is surrun·cd up in the fa.ct till-at Union was clearly outplayed by :t;:he Hartford team. At no time during the gam~e were the visit·ors in imminent ·danger •Of losing the con- test, an·d by the stenar work of their fullhack, Xanders, and their qnarter·ha:ek, Pond, tG.'1ey gai :1· ed large distances by cleverly working. the for· ward pas.s, and a doubl\3 pas.s on end runs, i11 seme ·cases the ball being sent forward after two n12n that had carr•ieod 'it were downed. U aion tried for the first ti·me a elever line-up that gained good distance several time,s, hut the 'heavie-r visitors generally .managed to prevent very large gains. In the :second half on .a fum- ble ''Buster\ Brown prove-d tfhe hero of the oc- ca..sion, by ·catehing a. ,fulnbled pa.ss from thG Trin'ity team, on Union's ten-yard line, and run- n'ing over for a touoh,aown. Every in·dividual man on the OaTnet team played his !best, and in many instance's flashes of exe:ellent playing lightened up th~ dismal prospect of a total annihilation. Jewell at quarterb:ack pulled .the team out of tigh.t places time after time, while Hequenlbour~g, E,treihert ·and acting captain Potter ripped :through the solid lin.e of the Trinity defence f·or good gains. Our two ends we-re in every play, and cleverly broke up many attempts, in ·so do- ing ta;ckling .theifl heav·ier opponents for losses several time,s. Th~ .story of :tf'ne game is as follows: First Ha,lf. The play started with a 40-yard kick-off for Uni·on by Riggs. Trinity ·re·c·eived the ball on thetr 15-ya:rd line an·d advanced by end run:5 and an 071S'ide kick toward Union's goal. * The playing was marked by the ·excellent wor.k of S:tretbeTt, Hequem.bourg and Lefferta, hut the Garnet boys seemed to be unable to stop t'he enemy, and .so a.fter about five n1inute.s of play, r:I:'rinity made a .touchd·OW11 and ~icked the goal. Trinity was held and forced to kick and Union made several gains but aga'in lost by the failure of an on-side kick. Trinity then mad·c an end run and score·d aga,in. T!hey kicked the goal, m.aking, the score, T'rin'irty 12., Union 0. Riggs kicked off to the 5-yard line and ·Trinity advanced to the 20-y.ard line but were fotced to puat. Hequembourg tihen made a run around the end for 35 yards and by line bucks the ·hall was sent f.orwa.rd for several gains. Trinity got the ball •on a fumble and made a run of 30 yar(l.s, which would have resulte·d in another touchdown had it not been for the fine tackle made of Jewell. Trinity then gained rapidly and made another touc'h:down, also kicking the· goal. ScoTe, Tr,inity 18, Union 0. Riggs kicked off for the fourth time anJ t~e ball was brought back to t'he middle of the field by Trinity and stayed there several minutes, fluctuating from s•ide to side until with only two minutes of play left, the visiting team got t~1.e ball on a fumble and by quick work sent it ·ove:- for another touchdown. They then kicked the goal and brouglht the score up to 24 to 0 w~en time was called. Second Half. Trin-ity kicked to the 15-yard line anJ through a .fumble they regained the ball on the 20-yard line. During this play Riggs was knocked out by slugging and although physically unfit, return- ed to the game. Trinity then worked the baH quickly over the Garnet g,oal and n1ade a touc~l­ down but failed to :ffiiek ·the goal. Score Trinity 29, Union 0. Riggs kicked off to the 10-yard line. an-d Trinity advanced to the 40-yard line- where Union got possession of the ·ball ~on downs. Union trieJ a forward pa·..ss but lost the ball on a fumble. Riggs was taken out of ,the game at this tin1e and \Buster\ Br·own went :in.

Captain Cunninghan1 has the deal J:Jped out like this: \Nest High Sc-hool of Rochester de- fea,ted Rochester University 1six to nothing. Binghan1ton defeated Roch- eBter vVes t High School five to nothing. E. F. A. defeated Binghanl- ton 12 t·o 2. TherefoTe E. F. A. would beat Rochester University 18 to 0. Roch- ester U lli versity defeated Han1ilton, -vvhich ran away with \Union and therefore E. F. A. would :have little trouble in disposing of the Union College team. It would be a great game and would attract a very large crowd . IN THE ALBANY DEPARTMENTS Dr. I-I offn1an will deliver a series of lectures before the n1embers of the Student's' Club on 3unday afternoons. Dr. H·offman will .speak on \The Bible anJ.

The main theme, the tragic love story of the young Empe'ror Otto III and Stephania, wife of the Roman senator, Crescen'bius, is a new one tG American literature. The .s;tory is vigorou·.s and in t~nse. 8eenes of the voluptuous -revelry of the period are contrasted wit·h th~ s·ombre and my&- tic rltes of the monks. Mr. G.allizier displays great Uterary ability, and lhis new work is a great a:dva.nee upon the for- mer one written by him about the :sam·e p·ariod in. history.

Th·J .one dollar tax levied· .this year ·on the !Student body for the •support o.f the Asse.ciation is to b8 continued in the future and the' finance•s will be managed much as are those of the athletic depart- ments, all money being paid out by a faculty rel)- resentative after appr10val ·of an auditing · con1 mitteE:.

8 THE CONCORDIENSIS tlle new rules ;:;hould put the 'Varsity eleven i 1 1 Lhe dass of the 1nost successful of the ·country's stn:r.:ll college teams. Following is :a brief outline of the intercolle- giate games played this Beas.on: Union-St. Law.re,nce. 1}nion'·s football eleven opened the season of 1907, at Clinton, N. Y., dBfeating St. Lawrence ~nn tlte:ir gridiron by a score of 16 to 2. Union scored 4 points in t 1 he first half on :1 drop kick and St. La wTenee .2 on a safety. The Garnet players entered the second half with a .s·nap that soon scored two touchdowns. Both goa.ls were kieked. St. Lawrence gained •only ten yards in the ·second half. Hcore Union 16, St. Lawre~1ce 2. Touchdowns WhE:adon 2, drop kicks McNab 1, goals McNab 2. U n ion ---'CO I gate ·T.he Colgate game, although not a victory, was one of the m·ost creditable showings made by the Garnet team this sea:aon. The Union eleven not only held, but in .many ·points olltplayed their ;heavy ·opponents. In the first half Colgate, through M·oore's clever catch of Union attempted forwa·rd pas.s, advanced the baH to our 5-yard line. Here the Garnut players pulled together ~and foT three downs 1 held back \their opponents from the goal line. Til the ·latter 1p·art ·Of the .second half Unio!l ·was ateadily advancing :to ·Colgate's goal line with a. good cbance to seore when the team was penalized half the length of the field for foulin;?;. Tin1e was called with t 1 he ball in UDion's posses- sion on Colgate'·s 30-yard line, no score having been n1ade by either .tea~1. Union 0, Colgate 0. Union-Middlebury Union played her third gan1e . of the season agatnB.t Middlebury at Middlebury, Vt. The gan1e was :s.mnething of a dis.appnintn1en t to the Gar- net te.a111 eo.nfident ·of ·success against the MJddlebury eleven. The game was played on a field of clay, used forn1erly as a baseball diamond. Rain for tw-o days prior to the game llad converted the field into a slough .of Blippery n1ud. Under ~hese eonditions fast play was in1- ·possible, and the ball fluctuated ·near the cente1~ ·Of the field during m·o.s.t of the game. however,. g.ainea m.o;re ya.rd.s than their opponen(:3 a~1d in the second half clearly ·outplayed the1n. Score, Union 0, Middlebury ·o. Union-Rutge,rs The Garnet tean1 went d.own to the first defeat of the .seas·on bef~ore the Rutge-rs eleven on :th·3 can1pt:s, the score being 12-5 in f·av.or ·Of the visiting tean1. It w1.s the trick play:s and clever tactics gained fron1 two year.s' experience under the new rules t·hat Ena.bled Rutgers to score ·on the Ga·rnet. Rt_l tgers scored first, advancing . the hall by a . . ueriEs of .forward passes and fake kicks. In the rat~er })art of the first half Union •obtained the ball a:1d, playing straight football,. tore up the Til~ t;E:r.-s' line and rushed it over fo-r a touchdo·wn. T!l the se.cond half Rutgers again, by snappy and tricky playing, was a.ble to croB·S the Ga:r- net line. Uni.on failed to score in the sec·owl half. Touchdowns-Fisher 2, Potter 1. Goals- FisheT 2. Score Rutgers 12, Union 5. Union-C. C. N. Y. On October 26, a team repre·Benting C. C. N. Y. appeared on the campus and but fo:r Coach Ten- ney's putting in a w1hole scrub team in the sec- ond half, C. C. N. Y. would have been wiped off the face ·of the map. The C. C. N. Y. aggrega- tion played like 'high :school boys and incited some of tha·t s.pirit in to the Garnet playe-rs s·O that t11e game was rather uninteresting, due tv the ragged playing . C. C. N. Y. made her touch- down on a fluke but was unable to kick the goal. Union 35, C. C. N. Y. 5. Hamilton-Union It waB a ·rainy day for Union ·in more ~than one ·way when the Garnet jo·u:rneyed .to Clinton on Novem·ber 2. The game was magnificent tl> watch fTom the side lines. It was esveci-ally !heart- reading W 1 hen after twice advancing the ball nearly the leng.th of 1the field the Garnet lost it within Hamilton':s 5-yard line, and then on that punt to ·see Ga.pt. H·olley ·place t!he ball between our r·oal ·P·osts for the -only score in the ga1r1e. Hamilton playe:d excellently, but if distance gained counts .anything Uni-on ·played better. The h lE1-dred and fifty Ga:rnet cheerers thundered ·out y elH and S·Ongs, even after defeat was assured ' Middlebu·ry re-ceived .several free tries for a goal from placement but failed t·o seore.

THE CONCORDIENSIS 9 - Ro·chester-Union Again were the Garnet coloTs lo·werecl to de- feat on November 9. The game was an ideal o11e with a slight advantage of weight on Roch- ester's side. The first half ended in a 0-0 sco.re, Ur1ion twice holding R~oohester on her 5-yard line with mer stone wall defen:3e. In the seeoihl half on a punt J.oy n~a.de a fair ca,t,ch on 'varsity's 45-ya:rd line and Pray kicked a go·od fi.eld goal. noehester 4, Union 0. Tri ni ty-U n.ion . On Noven1ber 16 Union met a team 'way out. of her class. No such .f.o·otball has _been se~n ~on the c.ampus as that which Trinity sho-we~l. Their trick plays netted t:hem gain after gain, although Uni,on'.:; line was almost invulRerable. Union's touchdown was made by \TV. Brown, who caught a forward pas:s by Trinity ana trotteJ ::.crm:.s the goal line. Union's line was :1nuch stronger than that of Trinity a-s time a·fter tin1e Uni·on made her distance through Trinity's line while the visitors found t~hat san1e U1ing ·with our tean1 a veTy difficult matter. Trinity 45, 1Jnion G N. Y. U. 12; UN ION, 7. ~ew York University defeated Union;s t.eam ·On Ohio Field Saturday by a ·score of 12 to 7 before a crowd ·of 3,000 ent.husias:t:ic ·;:;pectatoTs. At every point in the game Union slhowed su- perior strength but inability to 1neet with the strategy ·of t·he New Y.ork temn until the secon 1 half, when Union's S 1 hift f.ornla.tion had the city tEam completely puzzled. New York's good use of the forward pass was acc·cu·ntable for the firBt touchdown. ~ewen s made a successful pass to Young who easily carried it over the g-oal. Newens kicked the goal.. After tl1e first gaal ·w.as n1ade Union kickeJ. to ::-.Jew Y~ork's 30-ya.rd line and held the-1n for downB. On a fumble Union obtained the ball and gra.dua.lly w·orked their way hack into N. Y. U. territory. New York, however, ~took a bra.ce and when they were apparently held f·or the third down, H. Bro!wn was suddenly dragged ·out by N ewenB and ·ran forty yards for a touc:1down. Newens ki-cked th·e .goal. Time was ·soon ·called, w'it!h the hall in lJnion's po-ssession on N. Y. U's 15-y-ard line. 'Sco·re 12 to 0. ----- Between the halves, ~. Y. U. students and alun1ni swar1ned ~onto t11e field. and sang Beveral t:ongs and gave their yells. Union's showing was also good, there being fully 20G students and alumni on the benches and the good <Spirit and cheeriNg w·as a feature, favcrab1y c.omnl'e·nted on by New York .::;pecta- tors. The sEcond h.alf was by no n~eans a repetilion of t:1e fi:rst. Uni-on played a .different game. Hal Tenny's final coaching took effect. ~ '2-W York seemed unable to .hold them. Jewell had re- placed Mc~a b and swiftness charaeteriz2d a 11 ~plays. Streibert and Brnw·n were 1·ernoved, Slln1ter taking Streiber.t's pla•ce. Union pushed the ball rapidly toward ::\. Y.\s goal and .scored a touchdown in seven 1ninutes, l.mt fai18d to kick the goal. Again Union }msh- E:d the ball dowll the field and seaTed a safery 0~1 ~- Y. U. 'This made t·he score 12 to 7. .:\ew York rallied and played with fierce ef- forts to :1old Union and although Union h:ld the ball on tl1e 8-yard line they were held.

FOOTBALL MEN TAKE NOTICE It is the desire of the management of the 1908 football season that the men on the squad turn in their suits at once to one of the following m·en: N·ielson ''10, Hutche!ns '10, Potter '10, Hotchkiss '10, or Smith '10. Some o·f the 'varsity men w'ill doubtless desire their old sui'ts next se!ason. In \' order to. insure this the 1 y should strap the~i r suit up into a roll by means of the belt and enclose the 1 ir name on a slip of paper, calling the atten- tion of tlhe collector to it. It is necessary that everything be turned in regardless of condition. This will insure com· plete equipment for the entire squad at the ver·y beginning of the 1908 season. COLLEGE ME:ETING At chapel lll'ee.t:ing la-st Monday the studenl'l3 were rather s.caree, tihe decided defeat by Trinity, D·O doubt haV'ing some effe-ct u.pon them.
