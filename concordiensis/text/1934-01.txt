E. Kenneth Mees, director of research at the Eastman Kodak Company, will deliver the eighth Steinmetz Memorial Lecture in the Chapel tomorrow evening at 8:00 1· p. m. on the subject of \Scientific Thought and Social Reconstruction.\ Dr. Mees was born in England, and received his education there. From 1906 to 19t2 he was a.ssociated with the manufacture of photo- graphic dry plates, and in this period he n1ade several important contribu- I tions to the photographic art. He was then invited by the head of the Eastman Company to organize and direct the research laboratory of the Eastman Kodak Company at Roch- ester. In 1918 he was appointed di-· rector of re.search and development and in 1923 he was a director of the company. His work at Rochester has given him an unusually valuable background for a consideration for the sociological side of scientific work. He is the author of various works on science and photography, and has been the recipient or many scientific honors, both m this country and abroad. The Steinmetz Memorial Lectures have been endowed by fr·iends and E.dmirer.s of Dr. Steinmetz. They are given under the auspices of the Schenectady Section of the Ameri- can Institute of Electrical Engineers, and are open to the public. In the past the foundation has brought to Union such m~n as Dr. Michael I. 1-'upin, Dr. Robert A. Millikan and Dr. Karl T. Compton. ---·0·--- Local Graduates Attend Alumni Luncheon Meeting A luncheon meeting of the Sche- nectady County Alumni Associa- tion, which was attended by twen- ty-six members, was held yesterday at noon.

We can harmonize warring elements in nature but we cannot harmonize even our own use- less hearts,\ said Dr. Charles Alex- ander Richmond, president-emeritus of Union College, in his address Sun- day in Memorial Chapel. \When we consider the amazing triumph of man in the field of serv- Ice.'' he continued, \we are struck with astonishment at his shameful defeat in the field of human rela- tions.\ Dr. Richmond went on to say that the answer was simple, that we have been trying to gather grapes fl·om thorns and figs from thistles. Althou~h all the nations talk peace 'nd dif'armament in the many peace ~onfet·ences, these same nations, he pointed out are building battle ships, YJaking poison· gas and preparing for war in many other ways.

Edward Ellery, its author, pointed out eight items which can be regarded as a ba.sis for each stu- dent to try to 1i ve up to. Commenting upon this creed to a I eporter of The Concordiensis, Dr. Ellery stated that he will welcome commenis on it from the students either in person or by letter, prefer- ably the former. Emphasizes Self-Belief The eight points of the creed, as outlined by the acting president are: 1. I believe in myself, in my innate possibilities of moral and intellectual superiority. 2. I believe that these possibilities develop gradually and slowly; that their· devolepment Te- quires constant patience and hard labor on my part. 3. I believe that neither a single mistake nor a single accomplishment indicates my real character; that my character is indi- cated by moral and intellectual ten- dencies shown in the four years of college life. ~traigbt Dealing and Honesty 4. I believe in straight dealing- in intellectual honesty-and in avoid- ance of evasion. 5. I believe in eman- cipation from inflexible traditions and in the exercise of a flexible in- telligence. 6. I believe that educa- tional method must change as hu- man society changes. 7. I believe that student manners which are socially correct, and stu- dent practices which are ethically right will advance the best interests of Union College. 8. I believe in Union ·College-in the sincerity of its efforts to ad'l.'ance the best interests of its students-and in the Union Plan to further the development of individual native ability.

'33 Is Among Students PreRented to Pope George F. Harris, '33, former business manager of the Concordien- ds was a member of an international group of students presented to Pope Pius XI on December 20. Harris who now attends the Uni- versity of Bordeaux, won an inter- national scholarship to that school while a student here. Besides work- ing on the •Concordiensis board, he was president of the French Club and a member of the debating team. The group which was presented to the Pope was formed in Rome dur- ing the Christmas holidays. Harris plans to see the points of interest in Italy, including a visit to Naples, be- fore his return to Bordeaux to re- sume his studies. Faker Flails Mentality of College Students As Union Squad Spoils Act By DON MOULTON f'ompletely misunderstood by a patent medicine salesman, the Union basltetball squad and its escort were forced to withdraw from a most in- teresting lecture given in a large, vacant, corner store in Hartford, Connecticut, Saturday evening. The group, on its way to Middle- town for the Wesleyan g-ame, had stopped in the Connecticut capital city for a lunch. On the way back from the restaurant the window front of the aforementioned corner store attracted the squad's attention. Plastered all over the glass pane were such intrig-uing signs as \Hear the Man Who Makes Millions Think,\ \Are You \Veak or Timid,\ \Here's Your Cure-all.\ Such an invitation was not to be refused, and the whole delegation, coaches, manager, players, and even the bus driver, swarmed into the rommoner's Hall of Learning, swell- ing the audience about fifty per rent. The faker did not appreciate this fertile new market, but keeping a wary eye on the newcomers, he continued his oration. He was hold- ing up a bottle, describing its con- tents. It loolted as though it bad bluing in it. \Now when you get a bottle in your hands,\ queried the salesman, \what's the .first thing you do with it?Jt \Drop it,\ was the casual sugges- tion of Union's one-man rooting sec- tion, Fred Wyatt. The faker called a halt in bis sales talk, and went off on a tangent that among other topics touched on his early life, college boys, courtesy, and getting a laugh. The harangue was broken off several times with a di- rect command for the much inter- ested delegation to leave. Somewhat disappointed, the team members filed out but soon discov- ered that Track Coach Ketz and Torch Singer Jackson were nGt present. Whether their curiosity had been aroused or they were too proud to be classed with a bunch of col- lege rowdies was not learned, but they soon showed up with a report of the marvel-man's after-remarks chief of which was this: ' \There's nothing In the world more dumber than college boys. They're just a bunch of puddinheads. I know folks, I used to be one myself.\ '

Friedman During the second week of the Christmas recess I was in Chicago, and while there I had the good fortune to see a basketball game between the University of Chicago five and the Marquette outfit. In the mid-west Marquette is considered one of the best teams in the country (the papers there never write about New York City fives) along with the Notre Dame boys who have not lost a game out of their last 19. The .Marquette-Chicago game was played in the gigantic Chicago U fieldhouse. This building also houses several tennis courts, a gridiron and a ball diamond, besides several smaller rooms and the basketball court. The court Is tremendous in size, but all mid-west courts are big, according to information I received. The size of the court necessitates a slow kind of brulketball, with emphasis being placed on dead shooting. Totals ............... 17 5 39 Score at half time--Wesleyan 19, Union 17.

Arcade The other Marquette star, Gorychka, made 7 points, but missed enough to defeat Chicago single-handed. The 5,0CO spectators went wild when Chicago started the second half 8 points behind and almost tied the score. A victory over Marquette would mean more than winning the Big Ten. But •Chicago was not up to the Marquette standard, and the Wisconsin boys won 31 to 24. The only 5cores Chicago made from the field were long shots, beautiful to see when they dropped. Lang, Chicago guard, dropped in five gotgeous shots from mid-court. It was practically impos- sible to break through the Marquette defense. The whole squad consists of giants, while Chicago has all diminut!ive players. Bill Haarlow, sensa- tional .Chicago prep school player of two years ago, began his college court career that night. ;He was ineligible up until that night. A special quarterly History exam put him on the floor for the game, but he was bottled up completely and scored only 5 points. I found it very uninteresting to watch the slow way tbat these two teams played. The large ·courts in the west cause ihem to slow up the game and depend mostly on fact brealts tlu'Ougb set defenses or else to take long shots. To be a star a player has to sink most of bi~ shots.

The first thing people see and like about Luckies is how round and firm they are. The tobacco doesn't spill out and there are no loose ends to cling to lips. That's because we pack each and every Lucky full to the brim with long, even strands of the finest Turki~h and domestic tobaccos-only the center leaves_ Not the top leaves- because those are under-developed. Not the bottom leaves-because those are in- ferior in quality. \V e use only the center leaves -because they are the mildest and fully ripe for perfect smoking. That's why Luckies always draw easily, burn evenly- and are always mild and smooth. So smoke a Lucky, a fully packed cigarette. And remember, \It's toasted'' -for throat protection-for finer taste. ···=:=:···:::~::>: ..... , ····:··=···. .·:·::·-:·.· .. ··:=:·:·. ·: .. ::: .. Always the Finest Tobacco and Only the ..

Mees, director of re- seat·ch of the Eastman Kodak Company, speaking on \Scientific Thought and Social Reconstruc- tion,\ the eighth Steinmetz memor- ial lecture given 'Wednesday night in the Union College Memorial Chapel, developed the theme that the scientific man's duty to society is to cling to the method of thought that dbtinguishes the scientist from the remainder of society, the \scientific method,\ in considering the problems arising as a result of the present social and economic transition. Dr. Mees said in part, \The his- tot y ur manktnd is rull of pseudo- sclentiric methods; pumitive magic, tne appeal to Iaith, the argument trom e•notion. These false methods must be resisted since they loo.d to lalse conclusions which may pro- duce disastrous results. As Clittord wrttes, 'Scientific thought is not an accompaniment or condition of hu- man progress, it is human progress itselt.'\ Before the lecture Dr, Mees was the guest of honor at a dinner at- tended by twenty-four local men prominent in the scientific field. Dr. Edward Ellery and Dr. P. I. Wold were among those who attended the dinner. The Steinmetz lectures, endowed by the many friends and admirers of the late Dr. Steinmetz, are given under the auspices of the Schenec- tady Section of the American Insti- tute of Electrical Engineers.

M·iss Kellas, like Mrs. Alice Pal- mer, honorary '95, is a great edu- cator. and I!:i an advocate uf a well rounded scholastic training for women. She is noted for her great ability and courage. In her youth she was attacked by paralysis. To- day a sJight limp Is all that betrays the .struggle to overcome the afflic- tion. Although now past her prime of life Miss Kellas still retains that marvelous capacity for work that has brought her fame in the field of education. Her fondness for her s1udimts has never waned. Perlhaps she no longer plays. pranks with them as was wont to do not so lOng ago, ·but Miss Kellas by no means has lost her Interest in her students.

In that it ha~ failed. As a n1achine for the in:>Ulance of worltl peace, it is a supreme joke In a \civilized\ wmld, the pos- sibility of permanent world peace is highly dubiou:;. The materialisti- cally acquisitive natme of the in· c.lividaal is expre:osec.l in national· h;m. And nationalism leads to in- ternational suspicion, fear and hat- red. Economic greec.l i:; woven in- to every flag. So perhaps the League of Nations should not be condemned for failing to accomp- lish the poss<ibly impossible. But the League ehould be :;ttongly con- demned for that policy which has r en de red the possibility of wo1ld peace even more remote. :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::u:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::;: ill ~ :;; SCHEDULE CHANGES ;;; !i!,,,,,,,,:,~.:~:.: .. ~.~.::,:~:~;,,~:~~~.:~,,,,,,,,,iil Senior C.

This plan was devised to fit the needs of a small per- centage of the student body and it is not the intention that it should be generally used.

First Forum To Be Held in Old Chapel ·Wednesday Night Ancient Ima,ge Discovered By Alumnus. Near the City of Shanghai Donated to College .· Rep1·esents Lion According to Chinese Tradi- tions Lion Has the Power To Ward Off All Evils By WILLIAM E. FERGUSON, '37 The truth about Union's Chinese Lion, better known as the \Idol\, can at last be told. An interesting folder containing conespondence between the donor of the image and a Mr. C. W. Clowe has been recov- ered from the vertical file of the Library and is being ·prepared for the College Collection, consisting of books about Union and many by some of her alumni. The Lion was presented to the colll'ge by Dr. J. M. W. Farnum, Union, <:lass of 1856. For over fifty- five years Dr. Farnum served as a missionary in China and it was during this time that Union's Lion was found and given to him. He t·emained faithful to his Alma Ma- ter until his death. He once said in a letter to Mr. Clowe, \I ·am al- ways glad to hear of the \prosperity of dear old Union\. When this was written, he was eighty-five years old and was serving his fifty-fifth year in the service of the mission- ary field. At the request of Mr. C. N. Wald- ron, present secretary of the col- lege, Mr. Clowe once sent to Dr. Farnum, a questionnaire concern- ing the Lion. The reply to the questionnaire is the only som·ce of information about the Lion that the Administration has today. Not An Idol Chemi-stl'y Club Meeting, Chem- Istry Building, 8:00 p. m.

Larrabee, professor of philosophy, in his talks before the alumni associations of Union in the west this week. He spoke last night in Buffalo, tonight he wlll be in Cleveland, Thursday in Detroit, and Friday in Chicago. Hade Intensive Study Dr. Lal'l'abee has made an inten- sive study of American college pol- icies and teaching methods as a member o£ the Union curriculum committee which drew up the Union Plan. As secretary of the eastem division of the .American Philosophical Assoeiation, frequent contributor on educational prob- lems to magazines, and as one of the book editors of the Jour·nal of Philosophy. Dr. Larrabee has been in intimate contaot with the de- velopments on the various fronts of educational progress. Two-Fold Purpose of Project To Increase Effectiveness, Broaden Courses of College Courses Reorganized Four Divisions of Study Made; 101 Schedules of CoUI'ses Available to First-year Men Edltots Note: The following is one of a series of letters by membe1·s of the Faculty con- ceJning the new Uniun Plan of Education which will go into ef'fe('t in September. The letters were written to Dr. Ellery who has given The Concordiensis, permission to reprint them. The Union College Plan, recent- ly announced, i~ not an experiment in education.

An. extensive program of intercol- legiate athletics was suggested as a means of bringing students to- gether, and giving them a common rteld for interest. Dr. Ellery be- lieves that the evils attributed to intercollegiate sports have been grossly over-estimated. A whole- some athletic plan, he thinks, would benefit the college.

This application must be ap- proved by the student's parent or guardian and after that by the Bursar. The application form can be obtained at the Bursar's Office any time after the 5th of January. The applicants are then requested to present their applications on Wednesday, Jan- uary 17th or Friday, January 19. No application will be approved by the Bursar until he has had a personal conference with the student making the application.

Pr·of. Charles N. Waldron, Secretary of the college, will speak on \College Spirit\ and will discuss the history of this spirit at Union. Some of the questions that will be discussed are: Is spirit essential to a college? Should it be revived at Union? If a new spirit is to develop, what form should it take? In sequenc·e with Prof. Waldron's discusswn, the U. C. C. A. will spon- sor a series of forum discussions which will occur at regular inter- vals throughout the w.inter. The spealters are: Feb. 7 --Dr. Peter I. Wold, speaking on \The Merits of Proselyting;\ Feb. 2&-Dr. Edward Ellery, speaking on \Science a:nd Religion;\ Mar. 14-Pl'Of. John L. March, speaking on \The Evolution of Religion.;\ Mar. 28-Dr. Ernest M. Ligon, speaking on \The Psy- chology of Faith.\ Over 350 post cards with informa- tion concerning the time and place of Prof. Waldron's forum have been sent to the students desirous of participating in this forum. Posters giving the date of this a:nd future discussions, have also been printed and have been placed at conspic- uous points about the campus. This series of forums is given in order to promote student interest and college spirit, and follows di- rectly in line with the pep rallies and the Christmas carol singing, also sponsored by the U. C. C. A. Seniors Agree to Flinn's Th1·ee Dollar Tax Motion Dr. Farnum says in his reply that the \Idol\ is not an idol in any sense of the word. According to Chinese tradition, the Lion has the happy factlity of warding off evil. Chinese child.ren are led to believe that lions will come and carry them off or devour them. ;\s a result the Httle tots have a tenacious fear of lions, a fear that they never over- come. There is nothing religious about the lion: it is· not an object of worship. They are placed, always in pairs, at ihe entrances of pub- lic ·buildings, temples, and tombs, one on each side of the path or walk leading to the building. More than anything else, the many economic difficulties with which c91leges are faced today are responsible for their tendency to re-examine their faculties, curricula and teaching methods not only for salre of economy but also in an at- tempt to reorganize their ins.titu- tions to bring about .an improve- ment in the quality of their finished produets: t hri r graduates. To accomplish the second the specified subjects required for ad- mission are reduced in num·ber and only those subjects are specified in which work done in preparatory schools must be continued in col- lege. This is bJ·oadening, not low• ering, our entrance requirements. Only elective uni1:.3 from an ap- proved list will be accepted. The present courses are divided Thomas J.

The particular lion which is to be seen at Union College was dug from the ground on :the south side of the city of Shanghai. It was un- covered while excavations for a breastwork to protect the city from long-haired devils\ were in process. The man in charge of the work gave it to Dr. Farnum who placed it in front of the boy's school which he had just completed. Upon fur- ther thought, however, he surmised that it would be more appreciated as a vare and valuable gift here at his Alma Mater. (Continued on Page 4) Annmmc('d Plan in November Union announced its \Union Plan\ last November after a year's study o·f its experiences during the 137 years of its existence, and those of other small colleges in America. The plan is based upon the belief that small colleges have a different function from that of large uni-• versities, and that more definite- ness and responsibility must be added the liberal-arts courses. Dr. Larrabee is secretary of the social studies division and there- fore conversant with the manner in which t·he divi'sional system oper- ates. A cer·tificate of g1-aduation, a recommendation .from the head o.f the school, a satisfactory interview by an officer of the college, a:nd fifteen units of preparatory school work from the approved ·list will be required. After admission additional op- por1unities are offer·ed because the divi~ion unit offers a g1·eater free- dom of choice of studit-s than could be offered by the department unit.* A stuct·en.t may major in a division as a whole, in a field of a division, in a topic covering more than one· field of a division, or in a topic covering work in more than one division.

We are all made on the same pattern with the same pur- suits. We are all inquisitive, look- ing for something. Our difference is that some are more inquisitive. \Success and failure depend on the quality of riches we obtain. Some think that we are only a suc- cess when we can tell the world that we are rich. The two classes of riches are very different; the question is which is better. All ·riches are open to discount and losses. Our only riches not lost are w~thin us. \The differences between Jesus and the people of today are His personality and power. His life was a wholesome life; His gospel deep; He came, not to destroy, but to fulfill. He placed no value or pre- mium on riches. America is not at all like the Kingdom of God, be- cause of Us searcn for riches.\ Very similar 'in pm-pose to the Union Plan for the Intell~tua:l Ad- vancement of Youth is the educa- tional system in use in the small town of Carmel, New York. There are but a few elders in the town who have unique ideas about schooling and have decided that the boys and girls of their town will get the kind of an education they desire. Just as Union will henceforth recognize that every student has some speciai aptitude, so does the educationai plan of this small ham- let assume; when they discover this aptitude, they give the pupil practical as well as classroom training in that work for 'Which he is best fitted. For instance, if a boy wants to be> an electrician, and shows abili- ties along those lines, he is given an abundance of mathematics to study plus an apprenticeship with the local electrician for a certain number of hours per week. The decision for the pupil's ap- titude is not left to the word of the boy or girl concerned. Early in the school year every member of the juniQr and senior classes takes a series of tests devised by Charles K. Taylor, a retired psychologist who is the founder of the Educ·a- tio'lal Records Bureau of New Yol'l{. City, The results fif these tests plus a mass of incidental in- formation about the student him- llelf are carefully tabulated, thus giving a pretty accurate picture of the student's social, mental, and physic.:tl makeup. If a boy desires to be a doctor and the information gathered from the Taylor tests shows that he -is adapteu for the profession, he is first given an apprenticeship under the druggist's care. Here he be- comoo thoroughly familiar with the rudiments of pharmacy. Later the student is 'advanced to the local doctor's office where he assumes the title of \Student in Practical Medicine.'' With the doctor as his master the boy learns to make c?emica:l analyses, give first-aid as- ststance, sterilize the doctor's in- ~truments, and keep his bag in or- der. By the time that he graduates from high school he is thoroughly prepared to study a pre-medi-cal cou~·se in one of ow· universities. Gtrls who show teaching abili- ties are given a chance to conduct clas~es in the lower grades a:nd they are given every opportunity under the Carmel Pian to put that ability to a test before graduation. A certain girl, who in her senior year in the Carmel High Schol was assistant to the town llbr&rian is now at Syracuse university spe-:, cializing in that sort of work,

Outstanding Five The regular starting Reindeer team consists of De Young and Al- koff at forward berths, Sanford at center with Phillips and Maister in the re~r court. It is possible that these five stellar players may not start against Union, as Andreas will be reserving them for the stronger rivals to be met in the near future. Union nevertheless, will be facing its :toughest assignment this year, whether against the five regulars or the substitutes. The Garnet line-up will be virtu- ally the same that lost to Williams and Rocheslter and beat Vermont last week. Coach Nitchman will have to preserve his men as much as possible for the tilt with R.

Visitors Football Stars Union outscored the visitors from the field but the accuracy of the Yellowjackets on the 10 foot marker proved the margin of vic- tory. All on the U. of R. team were football players except the center, Craytor. Geddes, Spaiches, and Mc- Culley were in the starting back- field here in November. Soehner started at end; Blowers wa:s sub- stitute end. Three times during the first half while the ball was in play, the lights went out.

New Plan Permits Greater Economy Says Dr. Bennett Editors Note: The following is one of a series of letters by members of the Faculty con- cerning the new Union Plan of Education which will go into effect in September. The letters were written to Dr. Ellery who has given The Concordiensis permission to reprint them. It appears to me that the Union Plan has many fine features which will prove themselves in the years to come. I want to mention par- ticularly the new divisional organ- ization. It will undoubtedly prove superior to the rigid departmental organization. It greatly simplifies essential cooperation in allied fields of ltnowledge and, by preventing duplication of effort, will permit a more economical utilization of our resources. The emphasis will be changed from that of departmental individuality to that of interdepart- mental coordinatipn. This ought to improve the quality of the curricu- lum as well as the quality of in- struction. There can pe better su- pervision of student programs so as to fit individual needs and interests more adequately. I believe that the new entrance requirements are 'better than the old ones. The admission officer is now free to select boys on the basis of their appar!)nt qualifications for college worlt and will not be ham- pered by a rigid llst ·of course re- quirements. WILLIAM W.

This report will be brought up for discussion a,t the next regular meeting of the Stu- dent Body. The report was read by William Waldron, '35 chairman of the committee, who then pro- posed an amendment: making any member of the student body eligi- ble for selection to the permanent tax committee. The report recom- mended that only members of the Council be eligible. The amend- ment 9:1so provided for filling any vacancies that may ocrur on the committee.

The Concordi- !).nsls will next be published on Tuesday, January 30. By VEDDER M. GILBERT The first undergraduate paper at Union, and certainly one of the first, if not the first, in any Ameri- can college was 'The Pastime,\ edited by Union's literary genius, John Howard Payne, '12. In 1807 Payne was in financial distress. He owed numerous debts to his father, who was finding it a difficult task to keep his son in col- lege. Payne decided that .be had to meet the situation by some means. \The Pastime\ was a ·solution to his problem. The boy immediately drew up plans for a weekly and presented them to his acquaint- ances. Persons wishing to promote Paynp's project had to pledge them- selves \that no exertions (should) be wanting on <their) part to ren- der 'The Pastime' a spirited auxil- iary to the cause of polite liter- ature.\ The paper, an eight page weekly printed in a near octave form, was to sell at a dollar per issue.. The first appearance of the sheet was on Febi'Uary 21, 1807, the last appeared June 18, 1808. There were thirty...six isSU!JS in all, printed at Irregular intervals oecause of the editot''S ill health. Poetry bore an important part in the makeup of \The Pastime.\ It is likely that Payne composed much of the verse; however, it is difficult to be sure since pseudonyms were in common use. Little college news, unfortunately, found its way into the sheet. Local news was avoided because the paper had quite a few Albany and r-jew York subscribers. When, however, college news was included it was written in a gl•an!ii- ose manner. Often essays were not submitte\} for publication, then the editor <there was a Board of Edit- ors but like so mnny boards they seldom functioned) had to substi- tute biographies, usually of men of l~tters. The essays that were pub- !!shed bore souch dignified titles as, Moral Tales and Allegories;\ \Re- marks on Men and Manners:\ and \Articles on Levity and H~mor.\ Occasionally \The Pastime\ resort- ed to low forms of humor. The epitaph given below is characteris- tic of the type of drollery Payne in- dulged in.

The idea itself, of having such a: stable policy, merits laudatory words, but as proposed it deserves even more praise for the foresight with which the plan will be put into execution. And while I am on the topic of commendability, allow me to con- gratulate the staff of The Concor- diensis for a splendid journalistic output during the school year. After some of the vacillating space-filler I have read in the editorial columns of the school paper, it is refreshing to read the vigorous comment on the good and evil things \under the college eaves.\ I am reminded of the quotation which appears in Vol. I, No. 1 (June 1932) of The Iconoc- last, to the effect that when respect- able vices take shelter under the eaves of the college, then comes the time fo,r the stern iconoclast. I am proud enough of The Con- cordiensis to display it to my friends at Brooklyn Law School, and take personal pleasure in the praise they give it. Jerome Prince, who graduated in June from the law school, summa cum laude, and at P.resent edits the Brooklyn Law ReVIew, tells me that it is undeni- ably one of the best college papers he has read, from the standpoint of material.

AI- Schedule though their record is not impres- sive to date, the Army sextet is sure to put up a good fight and their reserve material will give them a decided ·edge. Building Up Defense Through the efforts of Mr. Achil- les the squad has been able to practice on the General Electric rink, and when that was impossi- ble, on the rink at his own home. Both Dr. Clark and Mr. .Achilles have been working hard with the men, stressing in particular the fundamentals of the game, and building up the defense. Williams has been shifted from his old position at center to defense and with Fox as the other dfrfen.se man, that part of the ice should be ably taken care of. Captain Hutton, Jenkins, and Bergman will form the forward wall and are expected to do some good work in the scor- ing division. The goalie has not been definitely chosen as' yet, but either Smith, Walthers, or Neu- mann will defend the net. The probable starting line-ups of both teams are as follows: UNION ARMY Walthers ..... Van Nostrand Tonight-7:30, Delta Upsilon vs. Phi Sigma Kappa; 8:30, Sigma Chi vs. Kappa Nu.

Their attack is bUJilt up principally around Powers and Bernas, forwards. The team, coached by Edmund Donald, will be handicapped somewhat by lack of experience, but R. P. I. is usually a different team when meeting the Garnet. Nels will probably st&rt the same five- men that opened against Syra- cuse. Failure to follow instructions correctly may prevent one regular from starting. Van Waldron, who has perfected his playing greatly, is slated for the pivot position, with Capt<tin Dow and Jack Mof- fett as guards.

Friedman No doubt there is plenty of conversation around the campus lately relating to the little euccess the ewimming te~m _has had, and the mediocre record of the quintet. It seemed at the begmnmg of the year as though both these teams looked like sure winners, but to date the swi~mers haye suffered three straight defeats, which were more or Jess trouncmgs, wJ:;lle the courtment have won four and lost an equal amount. The Garnet swim- mers are veterane of several years, and some of them hold College records. These men are still swimming at the same speed. The poor showings no doubt are the results of fine swimming on the opponents side of the P?ol. Williams and the Connecticut Aggies bad men that are capable of domg better times than most of the Union swimmers. There is no reason why the Colgate defeat should seem very disastrous eince the times turned in by the Maroon were very good. There is no alibi to be offered by anyone for the defeats. The quintet's defeats we-re sufl'ered at tile hands of Williams, Syra- cuse Rochester, and 'Vesleyan. Only tile Rochester contestt ended in a clos~ score. Wherein lies the faul~Union has been meeting teams a little too strong fo1• them. One glance over tl1e number of times we have won games from the Little Thme colleges, Williams, Wesleyan and Amherst, shows that year after yea1·, in every spo1-t they 1ake us over thf) rocli!!. Of <;oUise, occasionally we wip. some gp.mes, bvt tlte overwhelming majority of times these teams Imve defeated us shows their superiority beyond a doubt. In my opinion they should not be met in all sports. Last fall Hamilton College lost only one football game, and that to AmhPrst. Next fall they will play the same teams, with the exception of Amherst, for whom little Susquehanna has been substituted. Of course Colgate, Cornell, and Symcuse do not belong on om• schedules. We gained nothing b3• playi.Iig Syracuse Wednesday night. The team traveled to Syracuse in the afternoon, played at night, and returned immediately after the game getting here late in the morning, with at least two men having to tal{e hour exams at eight o'cloclt Thm·sday morning. We realize we played the best we could,\ but in the newspapers appears the ove1whelming score, and who, out- side of Union students, falls to think that we have terl'ible teams? Our schedule .should include teams that are our equal, regardless of the monetary problem that may be involved. Prestige may be gained by beating a bigger school, but it occurs so seldom that it .should be dis- regarded. There are plenty of colleges in New York state and New Eng- land that are our equal in athletics, that would make formidable oppouents. Rochester, R. P. I., St. Lawrence, Clarkson, Alfred, Middlebury, Ham!Jton and Vermont are a few. These teams should appear regularly on all our schedules. No one can say that a team can have spirit if it continually plays other teams that are slightly better an the time. Give a team a fighting chance for victory and there will be some spirit, not only among the players, but also the student body. The reason we Jose so many ath- letic contests js because we play teams acknowledged to be much better by everybody. There is no use fooling ourselves by thinking we can beat better teams. It can't be done, and it only spoils Union College in the face of the outside world. Other American players who reached the last eight include Frank X. Shields, ranking at top of the new United States list, aud J. Gilbert Hall of South Orange, N. J. M.P. Margesson of Toronto, and Marcel Rainville, Laird Watt and Charles W. Leslie, all of Montreal are the Canadian players still left in the running. George Lott, ranked number 10 in the United .states, arrived late and must defeat Jack Reitman before entering the quarter finals.

M. ' By LESLI}l} :&. LONG Nearly two weeks ago the blood- stained limoUsine of Edward G, Bremer, .St. Paul bank president, was found in a secluded spot a few miles from where he. is reputed to have been kidna;pped .. The kidnap- pers aslred for $200,000; friends of Bremer guaranteed payment of the ransom in unmarked money; last week tl:le Minneapolis postmaster recedved an u.nsigned note stating that the banker had been ''bumped off by mistake\ and that', the l:Jody could be found near Anoka, M:inn.; no further wo:r.d· has been received and neither Bremer nor his body has yet been found. Cha.llenge of · Kidnapper The challenge of the professional kidnapper to organized society is one which has not yet been success- fully met. The majority of the kid- napper's victims are returned after his demands have been met. And in not a few cases the criminal has been apprehended and brought to justice. The efforts of the govern- ment have not been futile in every instance. But the Lindbergh, Brooke Hart, and Bremer cases signify that either the departments of justice are incompetent, the methods used by those agencies could be im- proved or the annua,l tribute of life and money paid to the profes~ sional criminal is inescapable. Despite the combined efforts of local, state and federal departments of justice in the Lindbergh case, the only tangible discoveries made were those of the fact that a crank had committed perjury and had Impeded justice, and of the muti- lated body of the Lindbergh child. The responsibility for the crime is still a mystery. Lynch Law Ineffective The body of Brooke Hart was found in a California river; the bodies of his kidnappers were found in a California tree. It was said at that time that \lynch law\ had solved the problem of the kidnap- per- that the fear of that sort of punishment would deter the kid- napper from practicing his art in the future. The fallacy of this ar- gument has been amply proved. Lynching, as a method of removing rrime from society, is analogous to the removal of a pimple from one's face with an axe. The kidnapper stands today as a gaunt spectre spreading terror in the hearts of all classes of society. His is an enterprise not essentially dissimilar from that of the monop. olist of modern \big business\. Af- ter the victim has been abducted, the kidnapper holds a perfect mon- opoly over the life and safety of the kidnapped. He is in a position to demand almost any pri·ce he choo:::es. In other words he offers a certain value for sale; he has created this \value\ illegal·ly and immorally but he nevertheless of- fers a \value\ at a stated price, and he bargains as a monopolist. His business is the illicit traffic in hu- man life and human emotions. He is a parasite who lives at the ex- pense of the love of man for wife and of parents for their child. Kidnappei'S Position Impregnable But what makes his position so impregnable? Undoubtedly the an- swer lies in the fact that he is pro- tected in so many different ways. In the first place, abduction itself, does not require the criminal to work in the open. It is infiinitely safer to overpower a man or child and to make terms later than to commit a daylight holdup in a guarded bank for the same amount of loot. Then too-, the reluctance of the family and friends of the kidnap- ped to cooperate with the police is a real handicap to the department of justice and a protective advan- tage to the abductor. The police usually have the meagerest of clues to work with. The press is another factor which tends to thwart the apprehension of the criminal. It is a protective of the criminal and esneci\llv so of the kidnapper. The American peo- ple demand news. Consequently ev- ery movement of the police and (Continued on Page 4) College Orchestra, Silliman Hall 7:30 P. M. Thmsda.y Daily Assembly, Daniel Flinn, Pres.

Glee Club Will Give 3 Concerts On Tour To Sing at Osw~go, Lowville And Watertown; Comedy Skit, Soloist to Be Featured The glee club will set out Friday, February 9, on a two-day trip, in the course of which concerts will be given at Lowville, Watertown and Oswego. The club plans to leave Schenec- tady Friday morning for Lowville, where the rtrst concert, a short and informal recital, will be offered at 1:15 in the high school. The same night, the club will sing at the South Junior High School in Watertown. This performance is sponsored by class A of the Senior High School, and the opportunity to appear was obtained chiefly through the efforts of Melvin B .. Myers, '33, manager last year of the club. Saturday the club will journey to Oswego, to give a recital at the high school under the sponsorship of the junior and senior classes, and Sunday will return to the col- lege. The program at the Watertown and Oswego concerts will consist of four groups by the glee club, a comedy skit, a group of solos by Herbert Hausser, '34, and a number of songs to be given by the string quartet. On this trip also, Mr. Tidmarsh's arrangement of the popular ballad, the Last Round-Up, will be featured.

I had to resume my classes .1t the Conserva- tory the day after we arrived and all my pupils were eager to start their work at once. Then there were many concerts to arrange and a dis- couraging mail. Anyhow, we begin to see our way clear and to settle down. Learning an Orderly Process A very important featm·e of the new scheme is that it makes the stu- dent see that learning is an orderly process. Under our present system information is presented to the stu• dent in small packages, so that he sometimes falls to see that educa- tion is a unified and orderly pro- cedure. The teaching of Greek will be considerably benefited if the stu- dent looks upon the subject n.ot as a separate thing distinct from the other parts of the curriculum, but rather as an organic part of a larg- er whole. A great psychological ad- vantage is gained by letting the stu- dent see at the very beginning that we have a reasonPd plan for him to follow, that we know what we want to do and have a reason fot• doing it, that he is offered courses In Greek, not because Greek has been taught for centuries, but because aft- er careful study of the existing sit- uation, the college feels that Greek has a place in a modern curriculum. The student's confidence in the sub- ject is thus increased because he realizes that we are following a corulcious design, not clinging un- critically to tradition. I ·do not anticipate that large num- bers of students will elect the Greek courses under the new plan; I do think, however, that judicious ad- ministration of the entrance provi- sions plus the divisional system of conducting the work, will increase our chances of getting students in- terested in what is still an important subject.

MARCEL DUPRE ----------------------------------~~- Capt. Jackson's Garden Was Begun In 1811 By Prof. Thomas Macauley By VEDDER M. GILBERT During the early part of the nine- teenth century much of Union's campus consisted of wood lots. There was one particular spot of land which attracted the attention of the artistic Dr. Thomas Macauley, Pro- fessor of Mathematics from 1811 to 1822. The broad ravine cut by Hans Groot's Kill (\The brook that bounds through Union's grounds\) made an ideal location for a garden. The doctor began the work which in l83ll. was taken up by Prof. Isaac W. Jackson. For forty-five years, or until his death in 1877, the garden was Dr. Jackson's pride and joy, and be- came one of the outstanding sights on College Hill. During the later years of his life he spent most of his hme when away from the class room in the quiet of his garden. When he died, his funeral services were held under the great elm CThe Nott Elm), where in life he had so often rested from his work. So completely. had Dr. Jackson be- come identified with the gardep that it is still called \Captain Jack's\ or \Jackson's Garden\. After Dr. Jack- son's death his daughter, Mrs. Sam- uel Benedict, whose home was with- in the garden area, graciously and generously assumed aU further re- sponsibility. Under her care the garden with its simple informal beauty won the acclaim of dis- tinguished persons here and abroad. For many years Jackson's garden has been the site of Commencement Week exercises, and has served as fl. quiet walk where the great possi- bilities of Union College and of Union men may be carefully ex- plained either to incoming freshmen or to the lovely ladies seen on the campus at Prom time, Impossible to Fit All Boys Into Same Mental Mould \The best men to formulate school curricula are school men. The best teachers to organize and conduct college curricula are col- lege men,\ said Dr. Edward Ellery, Acting President, in a speech broadcast over WG Y this after- noon. The speech was the seco·nd in a series of discussions of the Union Plan, and was entitled \The Union Plan and the Secondary School.\ The speech follows: \Secondary schools are entitled to the same freedom in enlarging and enriching their curricula as coll.eges exercise. in formulating theirs. College mterference with courses of study in secondary school~ is as unjustified a.s domin- ation of college curricula by the schools would be. Connection with a college does not of itself rendPr '!- college officer competent to JUdge the intellectual possibilities of students who have reached the menta! maturity of tf:te school boy. Only If the college mstructor has had secondary school experience is he capable of pronouncing safe judgment on school courses and methods. The intellectual advance- ment of the boy, improvements in the school system, educational progress of the colleges are best conserved when school teachers and college teachers co-ordinate their experience and their trainin2' and their ideas, and in the main do not interfere with each other in their application to the differing mental conditions with which each group is confronted. Have Broader Contacts \Secondary school men have broader contacts with human life than college men. They meet a larger group of students, springing from a greater variety of en vir on- ments, with almost unlimited vari- ability in mental attitudes and moral standards, and with some ideas or with no adequate ideas of what makes for relinement of liv- ing. Every secondary school tea~~er, 'Yith a back,ground of good trammg m scholarlmess and high standards of intellectual work with ideas of mental cultivation ~d re- ~neme.nt of !iving clearly delined, IS obVIously m advantageous posi- tion to adapt the con text of courses and methods of instruction to the conditions in secondary schouls. \Further the secondary school teacher knows better than college teachers the mental limitations of secondary school students. H:e knows that it is impossible to fit all boys into the same mental mould. Nature does not do it. Human in- genuity has not accomplished it, in spite of insistence through decades on unintelligent standardized ad- mission requirements on the part of colleges. Boys can be forced to memorize se.t answers to several hundred standard questions in a given subject -reproduce the an- swers when called for on an ex- amination-the mechanical but not the intelligent method of educa- tion. And the boy's intellectual blind spot may never be affected. ~emory i.s valuable but a compara- tively ummportant mental quality · one of the first to appear and one of the first to disappear. Intellcctua.l Blind Spots \Everyone has intellectual blind spots which no amount of memor- izing affects. Some lad:s do mathe- matics and science \veil, who are failures or strugglers in languages and history. Some lads are par- ticularly sensitive in literary appre- ciation and comprehension of his- torical or governmental or eco- nomics movements, who seem al- ways incompetent to grasp and apply principles of mathematics. Secondary school teachers have contact with this intellectual char- acteristic of the human kind long before college officers do. Colleges have been in error when they com- pelled school boys to use mental energy in an effort to overcome in- tellectual limitations. The college of the future will be wiser and ask schools to inspire boys boldly to concentrate their intellectual energy on the development of their natural mental ability. (Continued on Page 4)

MUSIC by Rankine Hinman I , We carried away a v:ivid impres- sion of the twenty-nine year old Russia,n pianist, Vladimir Howwitz, after his recent concett in Albany. Mr. Horowitz suggests the artist in GiQrgi{)ne's \The Concert,\ with his tall, slender figure, his unusually long and supple finge1:s, aqove all with his highly sensitive feature£, rela:ted In a delighted and very at- tractive smile only .after the .Jast number had: been played. The tremendo.us vigor and .pow«=r of his playing, into vyh'ich he puts his whole body, resUlt, !lowever, in a. too obvious outwar•d revelation of effort and te1nperament q.uile for- ti.gn -to Giorgione's figure. At one moment he fairly lifts himself from the ·bench; at another his head is bowed within a few inches of the keyb<>ard while he produces piani~­ slmos of inCI·edihle lightness and rapidity. At times he braces him- self with both leg-s .far apart or with one thrust behind the •l:!ench, once even with one hand gtipping the side of the· bench. · Teehnique Wltllout Soul Mr. Horowitz's tone is not par- licularly distinguished by warmth . His touch, rather, is c1isp, scintil- lating. He has developed a brilliant, :~.lmost prodigious technique that is little short of amazing. He devotes co much care and attention to the actual mechanics of his playing, unfortunately, that his work lacks conviction; while he played· we 0ould: not believe he was living the music, his soul absm'bed in it. It \Vas as though he had planned out his interpretation, his effects, and had then, in a detached state, set about their accomplishment. We particularly felt this in the Busoni arrangements of four Bach Chor· ales, which became virtually \tours de force,\ their spontaneity and depth of feeling utterly lost. The program was especially suit- ed for a. display of virtuosity, with Schumann's brilliantly colorful \Arabesque several of the most d'ramatic of Chopin's Etudes, and Liszt's \Sonata quasi Fantasia,\ with its vivid impressions of Hell, Purgatory, and Paradise. We en~ joyed the artist most in the softer passages, which he played with great beauty,-portions of the Llszt Sonata, the wistful middle move- ment of Beethoven's E flat Sonata, Brahm's A flat Waltz. Although Mr. Horowitz's playing failed to Inspire us we thoroughly enjoyed the concert. He is in the first rank of pianists, an artist for whom the highest standards may be set and whom we .may criticize only because of the progress he must still make to attain the high goal within his power. His tech- nique will t·equire less and less of his attention,. and though he may never become a Paderewski he may well be another Rachmaninoff. f~~m::n:::m::::::::m:::m:mm::m::::mm:~m::::m::l:il ill Notes On Our i!! • m lm,:,,:,::,:n:::~::,,:,:,,:,:u:::ml Famlllarlty Breeds Contempt \With Harvard so nearby, I might as well say that after four years at Yale and Munich, I have had enough of university life,\ declared President Hugh P.

To the Editor of crime. Buot this would in most cases mean the death of the !tid- napped. The penal-ty for murder can be no more than death. If the death of the kid,napped would in- crease the chances of the abductor for escape, he will not hesitate to kill. If he happens to be caught, he has nothing to lose i.f he has al- so murdered his victim. The protection of the life and safety of the abducted should al- ways be the paramount concern. The friends of the kidnapped are more concerned with his return in safety than with the apprehension of the criminal. The government should consider this end as primary. There is need for an efficient fed- eral secret service unit which would deal solely with the kidnap- ping problem. The press should be severely censored. The demands of the lddnapper should be met at once and perhaps the government should itself stand ready to meet these demands. Finally, abduction should be made a federal offense- not merely a felony-and the pen- alty should be established on some plane below that of murder. Some form of torture such as that used by the ancient Spaniards might be provided. Barbarism perhaps has no place in civilized society.
