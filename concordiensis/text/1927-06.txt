H ® 1927 A v E c A M Modern smoking pleasure that never fails THE smokers of 1:his age are the most independent ever known. Accepting no hearsay, they have smoked out the facts. They have learned that the choicest Turkish and Domestic to- baccos grown are rolled ·into Camels, that here is the incomparable blend- ing for goodness, .that Camels simply never tire the taste. Camel is the cigarette that never fails to please the modern age. Re~ gardless of how often you want the comfort of a smoke, of how steadily you light one after another, Camel will never fail you, never give you any but the finest thrill of smoking pleasure. This is why Camel's popu- larity, by far the largest in the modern world, keeps overwhelmingly in the lead. As modern taste becomes more insistent upon choice tobaccos, in- creasing milli<ms discover Camel's in- comparable mildness, smoothness and mellowness. If you want the cigarette that's good to live with from morn to mid- night, the one that is the choice of the modern age, ••Ha'Ve a Camel!\ R. J, REYNOLDS TOUACCO COMPANY 1 WINSTON•SALEM, N. C.
