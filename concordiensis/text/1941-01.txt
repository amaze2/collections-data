The outcome of the instt·uction is a private pilot's license. Cammittees Arranged The meeting Tuesday night, be- sides the organizational business meeting, included a talk by Presi- dent Fox and a short musical pro- gtam, Dr. Kellogg said. Othe,· l1f - cers of the relief committee include Mr. Robert L. Gibson of S~henec· tady, vice-chairman; the Reverend Timothy Pantelakof, of the Hellenic Orthodox Church. secretar~: ?nd Mr. Lawrence C. Rapelje, of the Union National Bank, tt·eDsut·e. Dr. Kellogg said that the committee had arranged the uBual set-up ul · administl·ative sub-committee to carry on the organization's work. They include a finance committee, a publicity committee, a program committee and a committee to carry. on the wo1 k of solicitation. i This last group will have 10 or 12 : sub-committees working with it to I expedite the task of collection, Dr. ' Kellogg explained. \Before I went for these inter- views\ he continued, \I was beset with the great utge to give the whole thing up and join up in the lighting forces and see the war through.\ He decided, however, to \leave the matter in the hands of the ,Colonial Office, such that my decision would in reality be their decision\. The association set $15.000 as its minimum goal. The money will be used for medical civHian relief. , More than $3,000 has already been contributed to the cause. Dt·. Fox Speaks President Fox, in his tallt, told the association that \Greece has ' stopped listening to the siren song 1 of fake efficiency of the dictatots and has commanded the respect of I the world in their fight for the of their own culture\ He said that right to live and to remain trustees the Greeks have differentiated be- tween the words \harmony\, as' used by the democracies, and \con-! cm~\ as used by the dictators. : The president pointed out that I the first American philanthropy for . Greek aid came in 1920, when . money was raised through concerts, I balls and theater parties. The tech- 1 nique for raising money for assist- ance of this sort was developed at this time, Dr. Fox said. Dr. Kellogg presided at the meet- ing and introduced Mr. Gibson, L. U. Mur·ray, former President of the Schenectady Chamber of Com- met ce. head of the direct solicita- tions committee. and Fred H. Neal, chair man of the project committee. 0 NEWS IN BRIEF Dr. Samuel McCrea Cavet, '10, national executive secretary of the Federal Council of the Churches of Christ in America, together with a dozen clergy- men and other religious work- ers, will <pend the day of Jan- uary 23 on the campus in study of the work in character de- velopment being carried on in Union's Child Psychology Lab- oratory under Professor Ernest M. Ligon. The decision has, therefot·e, been Greek Freshman Guest Of Local Rotary Club Dimitrius Calogirou, student ft om Athens, Greece, and stu- dent member of the Schenectady Rotary Club, gave a talk before that body at a luncheon during the Christmas recess. His re- marks were ·Of timely interest in view of the present struggle the Greeks are having and the al- most constant appearance of it in the news. Calogirou told of the extreme poverty of the Greek people, quoting the scaie of wages from the lowest to the highest. He stated that the chief occupation of the people is still farming; they raise olives for olive oil, fruit and tobacco. He eaid that tobacco was one of the main ex- ports to Germany with whom they have to barter. The Greeks have few of the modern conveniences Americans have in the hou8ehold; he said they live a life of utmost sim- plicity. As a final note to his talk Calogirou indicated that the spirit of the Gt eeks of today is equally as high as the old spirit of tl1e ancient Greeks in the days of Marathon and Ther- mopy!ae. Dr. Alfred E. Stearns Sunday Chapel Preacher Dr. Alfred E. Stearns, Principal- Emeritus of Phillip!!! Academy, Andover, Mas-s., will deliver the sel'- mon this Sunday at 11:00 o'clock in the Memorial Chapel.

He set vcd in this post for thirty years, until he was forced by illness to resign in 1932. Organ Recital mere tiger\. Loudon .pointed out that a job of this sort is vastly interesting and Is adventurous and pleasant into the bat·gain. It also will provide him. an opportunity to travel and see even more of the world after peace is declared in Europe. \I've still got an awful lot of the States to see. Needless to say, alter last year, It will ·be my first stop,\ he concluded. \With best wishes to all, very sincerely, Niel Loudon.\ State law Makers To Air Problems Assemblyman Steingut, Senator Desmond to Speak at Town Meeting Two members of the New York .State Legislature, Senator Thomas ~. Desmond and Assemblyman Ir- win Steingut, will open the first Town Meeting of the new year, this Sunday in the Old Chapel, with a discussion on the topic \What Are the Outstanding Problems Con- fronting the State Legislature?\ Both men at·e connected with the college. 85 Pe1· Cent Pass About 85 percent of the forty-six students taking the fall course passed the ground school written examinations given before Christ- mas. Repeat tests will be given this week. A:bout 70 per cent of the flight training has been completed in spite of weathei conditions hold- ing them up. To date the Union College flying course has been un- marred by accident. Requirements for admission to the spring course includes United States citizenship, two years of college training and the passing of a physical examination. Candidates must be within 19 and 26 years of age. In addition the ap.plicant must not hold a private pilot's license and students under 21 must have the written consent of pal ents or guardians. Those accepted for the Federal scholarships get $10 course fee, six dollar medical examination fee and nine dollar insurance premium, giving $3,000 life or accident cover- age and $1,000 hospital and med- ical expenses.

Union Degree $2.000 Yearly Positions Provided in 15 Fields; To Hold Examinations The United States Civil Service Commission haE> recently announc- ed the creation of two branches of employment open to college stu- dents and college graduates, cover- ing a wide diversity of fields. The positions open to college under- graduates concern employment dur- ing vacation periods, and are open only to applicants who have com- pleted at least three years of college work. The fields of employment for young college graduates provide for employment under the title of Junior Professional Assistant at a salary of $2,000 yearly. Des-r::ond, a graduate of Harvard Coli ege in the class of 1908, and of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, has served as a mem- ber of the Board of Trustees of the latter institution and as presi- dent of its Alumni Association. Union College con-ferred on him the degree of Doctor of Humane Laws in June, 1939. Among the important measures he has sponsored are bills for: eight·hour day for state employees, nemarital medical examinations, ~ivil service reform, highway 31fety. unemployment insurance law revision, minimum wage legis- lation, county home rule, city and village home rule, New York City charter revision, aid to holders of defaulted guaranteed mortgages certificates, and l.ow cost housing. Minority Leader The undergraduate examinations under the title \Student Aid\ are open to students who have com- pleted three years of study later than May, 1938, and must have for- mally indicated at the college their intention of majoring in the op- tional subject chosen in the Stu- dent Aid examination.

Hails American Integrity The spiri.t of American ft eedom rather than a tenacious and narrow view of the institutions under 1vhich we practice democracy was re:!ommended as precept for guid- ance of the American people by Dr. John L. March, senior professor of the College, speaking in daily as- sembly on Tuesday. \We are in the midst of a great movement of progress throughout the world,\ he said, as he denied that America might follow the lead )f Germany and Italy in keeping the institutions of democracy but permitting a dictator to dominate them. Radi~o Wo.rkshop Offered Position On I.B.S. Chain College Broadcasting System Unanimously Accepts Union Group The Union College Radio W01 k- shop was unanimously accepted for rnerr:bership in the Intercollegiate Broadcasting System at the latter group's annual convention, held this year at Columbia University on December 27 and 28 The Work- shop's membership will become ef- ficial as soon as it acceptB the con- Btitution uf the Intet colle~ late Broadcasting System. This consti- tution will be ptesented for consid- eration at the next meeting of the Wot·kshop's executive .committee. The Intercollegiate Broadcasting System, according to the report on the convention to ·be presented to the Union Radio Workshop by Granger Tripp, ·secretat y and con- vention delegate, is a non-profit association of college and univer- sity br·oadcas.ting systems organ- ized for mutual assistance ·bY the college groups. The IBS now in- cludes some 15 membet· groups. The IBS hopes to serve as a means to- wai d the furtherance of education, entertainment and .goodwiH among member collep;es, according to its ~onstitution. Must Continue Broadcasts By accepting the IBS constitu- tion. Tripp's repOI't states, the Union organization will be obli· gated only to the extent that it must continue an active ot·ganiza- tion in radio worl{ in order to maintain its membership. The m- ganization is establishing a library of recorded programs, to be ex- changed among its members. It will also kee·p a personnel file for its members and engage in active per- sonnel research among prospective employers in the radio industry. A bulletin is published at Cornell by the IB·S publicizing developments on the campuses of thf' me:nbet· networks. The IBS will also serve as a source of program ideas and ma- terial, the convention report says. It is anticipated that a well-organ- ized script exchange will be set up among the IBS members. An IBS committee consisting of the Union College and Columbia University members was establish- ed at the convention to investigate the possibilities of Frequency Moct- ulation 'broadcasting as an outlet for IBS program material. Non-OommE\rcial Basis In explaining the organization of the IBS, w:hich has been in exist- ence a little more than a year, Tripp said in his report that IBS member stations are divided into three major classif.ications: first, those members whose systems broaccast only to their own cam- pus, and who can accept advertis- ing; second, those members with 8ampus-confined systems on a non- ~ommercial basis; and finally, those groups who have available a short- wave transmitter as an outlet for their programs. Union was accept- ed for membership under this last classification. The IBS acts as na- tional ad vet tising representative for the stations which accept ad- vertising. IBS policy is determined by a governing board consisting of one representative fr.om each r. e:-: bcr network Day-to-day ·business is carried on by an executive commit- tee elected by the govern.ing boatd, which ordinarily will meet only at the annual convention of the Sys- tem. Founders' Day exercises marking Union's 146th anniversary will take place in the Memorial Chapel February 26. A national figure in radio, in politics and in the academic world will be the principal spea]{er and will receive an honorary degree. Announcement must await final action by the trustees after their January 15 meeting. Miss Greta Brown, pianist, will aid Dt'.

I some. 1 Last Spring we suggested that membership in such an org-anization could bring· a great deal of benefit to our own: Radio ·workshop or Radio Club. At the annual convention of: the Intercollegiate Broadcasting System held at Columbia University on December 27 and 28 the Union College Radio Workshop was unanimously accepted for membership in that organization. v\'e are glad indeed to see a Union activity look alive as the Radio Worl{shop has looked th1·oughout the year. Taking advantage of opportunities such as the one presented to the Workshop often means the difference between success 1 and failure for organizations of all kinds. Along this line we would repeat a suggestion made as earl~· as last Spring. :\Iembership in the Intercollegiate Broadcast- ing System may be along a number of different lines, one of which includes those clubs which have the facilities to estab- lish a campus broadcasting system. Such a system would b1·ing daily progmm to dormitories and fratemit~· houses by low-powered long-wave over a web of transmission lines. The Radio Club, with its station and equipment in the Electrical Engineering Building could easily serve as a nucleus around which to org-anize a local IBS station. With the physical equipment of the Radio Club as a foundation, L1P. members of the Club combined with, or in cooperation with, the members of the Radio Workshop, which includes men interested in the technical aspects of program planning, direction and produc- tion, tend to make Union's position in such an enterprise decidedly advantageous. :\Iembership in the IBS for the Radio Club as well as the Radio \\'orkshop would offer the advantage of previous knowledge alon gsuch lines and the possibilities of establish- ing such a campus bmadcasting system could be determined. Such an undertaking would not benefit only those students interested in radio. Campus broadcasting, or even intercol- legiate broadcasting, could be made of great interest to all students.

It plays a major part in making your telephone service the finest and cheapest in the world. Here is one of many cases in point: Above you see two telephone loading coils-one old, one new. Such coils are spaced at regular intervals along tele- phone circuits. They reduce electrical losses •.. help to bring your voice through clearly, strongly over long distances. Through the years, engineers at Bell Telephone Labora- tories have succeeded in making these coils smaller and smaller. In so doing, they have greatly reduced the cost per coil, which ... multiplied bythe millions in use ... has helped to keep the cost of out-of-town service low. Why nottelephone home at least once a week? Long Distance rates to most points are lowest any night after 7 P. M. and all day Sunday.

In other parts of the world whole cities huddle under- ground, while sirens wail and bombs crash-- but these Americans watch without fear_ The sharp fingers oi light sweeping silently across the sky are reassurance, symbols of security. Industry is on the job, providing the eyes of defense. Searchlights are not the only defense items being built in Schenectady and in the other plants of General Electric. Great steam tur- bines are under construction, totalling mil- lions of horsepower, to drive the ships of America's expanding navy; intricate con- trols will direct the operation of warships, tanks, planes, and guns; radio equipment will facilitate communication on land and sea and in the air. :\nd playing a vital part in these defense preparations are Testmen, young student engineers just off the campus, whose re- sponsibility it is to test these machines. SP££D INDICATOR WHE!:'\ an airplane catapult hurls a plane into the air too fast, the pilot may be injured and unnecessary strain put on the plane. If the plane takes off too slowly, it will drop into the water. In the past, barrels have been substituted for planes for testing purposes. A new speed indicator, designed by the General Electric Company, checks the ad- justment of th.e catapult without risking pilot or plane. The skid is shot down the track empty; if it registers the proper speed, the plane can then be placed on it and launched into the air at the correct speed, With some changes the equipment may be used to time other moving objects.

'42, said that the club would be glad to co-operate. He indicated that the network neecs f.urther study before even elementary steps can be taken. On last Friday, The Concordiensis again editm ially suggested that the Union College Radio Workshop and the Radio Club combine forces to form a broadcasting web to trans- mit programs to fraternity houses and dorm residents. It has long been known that the workshop, which now broadcasts over WGEO and WGEA, is in favor of such a plan. The Radio Club first discussed the matter of erecting the neces- sary facilities for program trans- mission last spring. At that time Gordon Jacob. '43, drew up a set of plans for an Audio- Frequency sys- tem, which could not run afoul of federal radio laws, and presented it to C0rnptroller Hoadley. The cost of such a system, which would have required the rebuilding of ordinary radios so as to receive wire pro- ~rams, made it impossible, Eldred said. Wire Cost $100 A racfio frequency system could be installed using the equipment of the club at much less expense Eld- red indicated. About $100 would .be t equir ed for wi·r e to string to the fraternity houses to hook up to their electrical systems. However the club feels that it coes not have the money to bear the cost of the erection. Such a system might also violate the Federal Radio law as club technicians believe that radio irE>quency wires radiate very much and would ·be heard off the campus. The Audio Ft equency system which Jacobs proposed is transmit- ted on a wave length which can not be picked up on ordinary re- ceivers no matter how great the radiation. Special tubes and equip- ment would have to be attached to ordina-ry receivers and unless the owner bore the cost himself, the costs would be tremendous. Shield- ed wit es can be used on ·a radio fre- quency system but are expensive. Eldred suggested that an experi- mental line be set up between studios in the Electrical Engineer- ing Building and either South Col- lege or Silliman Hall to enable the club's engineers to study the amount of radiation of a radio fre- quency system. After the problem has been -solved. he said, the exten- sion of the lines all over the cam- pus would be a simple matter. Plan& were drawn up last year :;hawing how the campus might be wired. Eldred had no idea how off campus fraternities might be wired nor did he have knowledge of the city restrictions gover·ning wires on the street. ----0---- NEWS IN BRIEF President Fox is speaking tonight before the graduate students in history at Columbia Univer- sity.

Without warning it went off in his hand. 1 The bullet penetrated his chest 1 and came out through the shoulder. A.fter the accident Orkis returned to the house and crawled in bed I occupied by his brother Michael ·without awakening him. Brother Hears Groans According to police, Michael awoke apparently a few minutes later. John was groaning and Michael asked him if he was sick. \Nothing is wrong,\ John is said to have replied but Michael soon discovered his brother's plight and went to the garage to get the auto- mobile. Neither Michael or John disturb- ed other members of the family who were sleeping in leaving. Mr. Orkis, a General Electric worker, was at the plant. State measures to round out the national defense programs were suggested by Senator Thomas C.

Also president of the Philoma- thean Society, Marshall has not yet announced his resignation. No Campaig'n For Transfusions Oversupply of Blood Halts Planned Campus 'Blood for Britain' Plans to inaugurate a \Blood for Britain\ campaign on the campus were halted early this week when Dr. Charles R. Drew, of the Blood Transfusion Betterment Association wrote Robert K. Killian, '42, orig- inator of the idea, that the supply of blood in England is adequate for present needs. Had plans gone through students would have been asked to donate a pint of blood for shipment to Lon- don. The blood would have been used to. give transfusions to wound·- ed civilians and fighting men, Kill- ian said. Killian WritPs Embassy Early in December, he wrote the British Embassy suggesting a plan which would set up an organization on college campuses affiliated with the Student Committee for D0moc- racy to facilitate the transfusions. Mr. L. McCormi-ck-Goodhart, At- tache, replied for His Majesty's Charge d'Affairs. thanking Killian for his \generous suggestion\ that an organization be started to which the youth of America might con- tr·ibute donations of 'blood for use in Great Britain. He referred the matter to the Blood Betterment Association of New Yorl{ City. Dr. Drew of the association wrote: \Word recently received from the Medical Research Council of Great Britain indicates that their supply of Plasma and Blood for the time being is adequate. Further shipments are not needed.\ He also informed Killian that the association will soon transfer its activities to the collection of Plas- ma for our own armed for·ces, and suggested that he get in touch with the local chapter of the American Red Cross if he wished to co-oper- ate. ----0---- Dr. Leo Wollemborg Arrives on Campus 2 Committee Members Use Vacation Making Contacts for Group Two members of the Student Committee for Democracy today disclo;:;ed that they had attended the convention .of and privately conferred with leaders of the Inter- national Student Service and Stu- dent League for Progressive Action, formed at New Brunswick, N.

Out of the meeting flowed two events important to .the future of organized, vocal, student opinion. First, the National Student Feder- ation, composed of members of 100 student groups ... finds itself in complete disagreement with the AYC on foreign policy .... Second a new organization, the Student League for Progressive Action, ... designed to take the place of the ASU and it indorses aid to Britain and China and the maintenance and extension of democracy within the United States.\ Feigenbaum, Schwartz Attend Armand V.

Robert Bishop Since the last issue of \The Concordiensis\ the second issue of \The Idol\ Union's quarterly magazine, has made its appearance on the campus. We seldom received, in the past, so many letters to the Editor on an identical subject as we did after the distribution of the January issue of the quarterly. In as much as such an outbu1·st of student opinion is rather unusual and almost un- precedented it behooves us to mention the fact in this column. It is not om· purpose to review \The Idol' 'at this time; such a review appears elsewhere in this issue. We feel, how- ever, that it is our duty to comment on that particulm· part of the publication in question that has aroused such a storm of student protest. We too protest-not to the publishing of an editorial con- taining student opinion, !Jut to the unduly rash tone of such opinion. We doubt seriously if the \legislative branches of College government\ have become sulJmerged under any tidal wave of administrative power. Organizations such as the \old Terrace Council and the new Student Council\ have been submerged, not as a result of administrative acts of power but, we frankly admit, as a result of the lassitude of the student members of those organizations. The editors of \The Idol\ have defended themselves with a \right to be heard\ paragmph and under similar license we continue and those who share om· feeling that the Idol edi- tors are not justified in their editorial accusations may see their letters in print on this page. We doubt seriously if the \indispensible man\ argument bears any repetition at Union College and to intimate that American educational institutions are reverting, or have re- verted, to self-perpetuating oligarchies appears to us absurd. Too many of us have learned that \dismal and desperate futures\ result rather from such false implications as appear in Cnion's \Idol\. UTILIZATION OF RESOURCE Public opinion is a stt·ange and fea1·ful thing·. Ovemig·ht, with unpredictable impulse, it has arisen and, with its power unleashed, affected the construction of the machinery of civilization to the point of its reconditioning and reinforce- ment. The unleashing of public opinion has been long overdue on the L'nion campus; its first expression in some time is to be found on this page in the form of letters on \The Idol Situation.\ There is more, too, by way of student activities that the student bod~·-the final judge-must examine and pass upon. The criteria of this examination of whether a student activ- ity justifies its existence should be: 1. Does it represent stu- dent interest? 2. Is it run by a representative body of stu- dents with free entry to this body always available to any and all? and 3. Is it furnishing as much good as is physically possible to the student body? All Union activities, not just one or two, must am;wer this test. A. F. THE CONCORDIENSIS, Tl'ESDAY, JANPARY 14, 1941 rr=~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~==~~~~~~.--------------~--~--.

We are tii·ed of having a publication for which we pay the fin~ncial bill so regularly abused by one who is after all only its trustee, not publisher. Has he consulted gent>ral student opinion Lefore speaking as their accreditee representative? \Vhy all this intimi- dation? We say that Alfred Knopf, Jr. owes an apology to President Fox, the Boa! d of Trustees, and to the faculty men on those import<:<nt committees whose work in behalf of Union, valuable as it is, he never- theless impuned to be a sort o! \\ Ot'll out \Rubber-Stamp.\ Frankly, we are selfish in writing this letter: we know that Presi- dent Fox is responsible for the tre- mendous increase in prestige of the college dm ing the past six years. He has been \called\ to the Pr esi- dPncy of several, larger institu- tions, but has chosen to lead us. We wr.nt him to know that Alfred Knopf Jr. does not speak for us when he writes those veiled attacks Situation l\lEIN KNOPF'S Atlministration in Washburn Hall To the Editor: Of inte1·est, perhaps to those who ate a ware of the shift in emphasis in government today !rom legisla- tive to judicial-to administt·ative-- are the names of undergraduates, <5iven tl:e g-racious condecesion of ·'Mein Knopf,\ the Master of Wash- burn Hall, to committees whose im- portance varies.

The purpose of this column is to note the various inter- esting ! we could have said artistic or worth-while) events which 0ccur in Schenectady from time to time, and als0, perhaps, to note why they were of interest. Does that answer all remarks? * * * Before school closed a young chap named Gundry p1 esented a violin concert which was adequate and very pleasing. A foetball p-Ia) er who attended said that he had a good time. A couple of the profes- sors were given tickets by various friends who felt sorry for them and thought the teachers might enjoy the concert. They were t:mexcited by the whole thing and would have been just as happy at a bingo party. Again, the most inte1esting thing about the -concert was the audience . Schenectady used to be the dread of every vaudevillian and stock- troupe! ~n the country, and the 1udience ·hasn't changed much since the good old days. The audi- ence was up to par at the Gundry ~oncert and successfully defended their title as the nation's Most Dis- respectful Audience by walking out during the encores. It wasn't en- tirely the audience's fault, however, because the encores wet en 't very exciting. Everyone managed to get out of the theatre unharmed. It was just like a movie audience.

V'.'ith 20 seconds to go in the game, played here last Friday, Freddy Kikoff slipped the puck past the St. Lawrence goalie to give the Gar- net aggreg.rrtion a close 3-2 vic- tory. This goal was contested by the Larries coach, but the protest was :oot allowed to stand. In addition, Wikoff made another goal imme- diately after play was again re- sumed,. but this goal was nu1lified because it was scored Gne second after the game had ended. Baker Spearht\ad Bob Baker was the spearhead of the attack. He led seve1al assaults upon the Larries' goal and scored twice without assistance. Jerry Grace, star wing for the Larries' sextet, blasted the puck past Cap- t:..in Dud Holmes for the first goal ol the game after 7:55 of the first period. The second period was scoreless, but early in the third pe- riod Bobby Baker shot one past Goalie Vilas to put Union ahead. G1ace of St. Lawrence knotted the score almost immediately after- ward. Then came Wikoff's blast to win the game for the Dutchmen. Uniun St. Lawrence Holmes ........ G ........... Vilas Hat tt ......... D. .. . . .. . . . White Keppler ....... D ..........

Coach Art Lawrence will take his team to Williamstown tonight to participate in the stiffest contest of the seven game schedule. The RPI engineers defeated the Garnet cag.ers on the Union court Saturday evening for the first time in ten years by the score of 32-21. Led by the Trojan's star forward, \Rusty\ Carman, who scored 17 points, and Captain Bill Coleman, center, the RPI five took command shortly after the middle of the first period and were never headed after that, The Dutchmen took and early lead on a field goal by Co-captain Mickey Rathlev and protected that lead for most of the period. RPI was unable to solve the Union de- fense for most of the first half and was bottled up while the Garnet f:ve added seveval field goals to increase their early lead. Midway in the period Union led by 7-3 and 10-5, but that lead dwindled to 11-10 at the fifteen minute mark, Then \Rusty\ Carman sank a field goal to put the Engineers ahead for the first time in the game, At this point the Garnet offense stalled and the Trojans went on a spree with Carman and Coleman caging several field goals and Coleman adding a charity shot for good measure. At the end of the first half RPI had a 4 point lead. 15-11 R. P. I. Puts On Pressm•e The RPI quintet continued to pour on the pressure in the second l:':alf and sewed up the game in the first four minutes of this p·eriod when it sank five b::~sl,ets in. a row. From this point on the game slow- ed up considerably. The Dutchmen tightened their defense and allow- ed the Che1 ry and Whit.e courtmen 0nly eight points in the remain- ing 16 minutes of playing time. The Union offense which stalled midway in the first chapter failed to rally in the second half and was held to two field goals and six charity shots in that period. The Gar net machine was dealt a blow when Sophomor·e Bob earn- right went out of the game via the foul route early in the second chapter. High scorer in the game was \Rusty\ Carman, tall forward of the Trojan quintet, who sank seven held goals and three charity shots for 17 markers Close on his heels was Captain Bill Coleman who C'halked up 9 counters.

This was ade- quately proven Saturday evening when Nels shouted \14.\ The boys passed the number around and bingo, a basket. Ed Fitz attempted to help the freshmen out of their dilemma near the end of the game. With 50 seconds to go, Coach AI Ciampa sent in the \shock troops\ and im- mediately after the referee blew the whistle to commence play.

The RPI freshmen, who have a.J- ready played several games, had not difficulty in penetrating the Garnet defense and score at wHl.

At the end of several minutes of play Doug DeWeese, guard and set shot star, had three personal fouls against him, and Coach Ciampa substituted Cy Meisel, a produced of the championship Amsterdam High team. At half time the score was 24-15 in favor of the Cherry and White quintet. The second half was practically even in a matter of points. with the Ga1•net freshmen trying to catch up with the Trojan yearlings.

Basing this on an ob- servational visit to Europe ·four years ago, the psychologist also \guessed\ that the \rE>cent collapse of France was in part due to the absencE' of ma,s enthusiasm ther P.' Comparing the totalitarian s)s- tPl11 of living with the community of \prize ted hogs\ which his father raised on a T<>xas farm in his boy- hood, Dr. Ligon derided th£> treat- ing of the mass of men as \dumb animals\ fit only to be led ·by a small body of \leaders.'' Ps)chologically analyzing the sci- ence of totalitarianism, he stated that mass hypnosis depends on f£>ar and anger, both of which practiced exclusively r·esult in a mental de- rangement which compels the sub- jects to \do without t.hinldng brains and alwa)s bE' picking a fight\. \Demoeracy is bungling along\ he said, \but when all is said and done, it dues permit mPn to grow. There is more and more appeal to reason.

Dr. Rojansky had rested proof of his theory on whether a new amount of energy would be emited by the comet whPn it came in con- tact with minute particles of earth- ly matter suspended miles above the earth in a stratosphere. Tests have been taken at larger physics laboratories throughout the country but will take about a month to be \reduced\ to interpreta-ble form. Factors such as baromect ic pres- sure. temperature, distance of the comet from the earth and influence of the sun must be discounted to give an accurate story of the comet's energy radiation. The current issue of the \Phys- ical Review\ carries an article by Dr. Rojansky explaining his theory Dr. Rojansky believes that if the universe is properly balanced, there should be as many negativ!:!ly charged atomic cores as there are positively charged ones. His sug- gestion is, therefore, that outside our solar syste mmatter might be built up on the reverse pattern. Some of the comets are believed to have been captured by the sun from outside space. That is, they do not belong to the solar system by origin but have been added to it by the sun's pull The tails of the comets might be caused by the desh uction of such atoms when they come in contact with the earthly particles in the strato- sphere. ---0---- NEWS IN BRIEF The Rev.

Such matter, he says, might be present in comets that enter the solar system from other parts of the universe; and also in meteors produced .by the breaking up of these comets.

Ordinary The colliding of the proton he:ll'ts of the two types of atoms would result in their mutual annihilation with only energy being left.

Januaty 17, 1941 GOLDEN OPPORTUNITY Union is not an in~titution which live~ and dies by the vary- ing- fortunes of its football team. Yet, when there was a noticea:ble lack of school spirit exhi·bited last fall in support of the eleven, the hue and cry in college publications was, rightly, long ancl loud. Similarly, l'nion dues not follow its • hockey team with baited breath. In fact, it is sometimes hard to see in what ways l'nion follo\\'s its hocke~· team at all. The sundry misfortunes experienced by the leaky campus rinks and the disappointing weat!H'l' fcH·cing· game cancella- tions of past years ha\·e not been conducive to enthusiasm. But this year. there is reason to hope that the situation will l.Je different. The hockey team, faced Lly a powerful Wil- liams team played a countg'L'om;]y inspired match that won the respect of its most ardent opponents. Led by the goal- keeping of Captain \llud\ Holmes, who approached a record with his 61 saves, and the hard-driving- center attack of \Bob\ Bake1·, the team ~_o:m·e promise of future success in spite of its 7 to 2 defeat. ltarely has l 'nion seen such esprit- de-corps. Certainly this weekend, us never l.Jefore, the entire squad i::; deserving- of the best \spectator-support\ l'nion has to offer. Furthermore, it is not too early to look ahead to the Ham- ilton match, Ft>ln·uary H. The c!Dsing days of the football, season showed the spi!'it Cnion can muster . .;\lay our support 1 of the team at Hamilton evidence this same spirit. C. T. FRESHMEN WE STAND; SOPHOMORES WE FALL Spontam•ous ch•ma!Hls f1·om the class have evol<ed a call for the Freshmen to gathe1· in :.lemorial Chapell\Ionday, January 27, to elect a \Freshman !lop\ committee, President John Clowe announced today. This unified enthusiasm of the Class of 19.14 is another manifestation of that steamroller spil·it which carried them to victory over the sophomores in LJoth Cane Rush and Tug- of-War, plentifully peopled the pajama dances down State street, and built huge bonfires which were practically the only success of otherwise drab football rallies. We can remembet' the time when another freshman class, the Class of 19-1:3, also carried seven stressed and strained canes across the north goal line of Council Field. They then turned from collecting canes to collecting a bevy of the most beautiful girls in the Capitol District and points north, east, south and west, especially north, for one of the sweetest swing .sessions that ever brought Union \200 coeds for a night.\ \Ve can remember· smouldering embers of this same spirit when these sophomores vainly conferred a mandate on their leader to arrang-e a Sophomore Soiree for pre-Christmas enjoyment; but \time's a-wastin'.\ But let not the Freshmen look to the sophomores for lead- ership in this matter. Let them look with clearer perspective to classes whose leaders have kept alive that spark of class spirit; the class of 19·12, for example. R. B. 9 A.M.

As the System grew and the telephone network became more complex, this problem of supply grew more difficult. But it was solved this way. Western Electric was given responsibility for manu- facturing, purchasing and distributing the equipment needed by the telephone companies. The concentration of these functions has resulted in keeping qualityupand costs down-to the benefit of every telephone user.

Smith will also meet w~t~clu~~~~~d~~ government while on the Union campus and speak to them on \Whom does the Representative 1 epresent, and how?\ For his Founders' Day address, Mr. Smith will speak on \The Po- litical W,ay of Life,\ in which he wm incorporate his three great loves, philosophy, politics, and poetry. Wrote Many Books Professor Smith was interna- tionally known to fellow phi!oso- phets through his more than a dozen books and as editor of \The International Journal of Ethics.'' But he became a widely known public figure since he helped to organize and conduct the Univer- sity of Chicago Round Table, one of the oldest continuous educational programs on .the air, and as radio speaker on nationad issues. His radio debates with Senator Robert Taft <Republican from Ohio), in the spring of 1939, preceding the presidential nominations, have been published under the title \Founda- tions of Democracy.\ His busy political and oratorical activities have not prevented Pro- fessor Smith from teaching philos- ophy courses at the University of Chicago, where attendance at the classes reflects ·his popularity with undergraduates. His most recent books ate \ Promise of Ameri- can Politics,\ \Phi!osophet·s Speak for Themselves,\ \Creative Skep- tics,\ and \Beyond Conscience.\ In 1935, he ran for the office of state senator on the independent Democratic ticket and was elected -to the surprise of his friends and enemies alike. He otganized and was chairman of the Illinois Legis- lative Council in 1937-38, and then was elected member of the 76th C:ongress as Representative-at- Large from Illinois. His term ex- pires at the end of this year. 0---- Two members of the varsity de- bating team will travel to Rut:gers University in New Brunswick, N J. to meet the Jersey debaters on the question of the Western Hemis- phere.

January 31. 19~1 ROUND TRIP-IF YOU PLEASE! This week L'nion bade adieu to one of the finest visitors · t has eve1· been her pleasure to entertain. The Carnegie ,·isiting Professor of International Relations gave his con- cluding- lecture last Tuesday at which time he discussed \Great Pe1·sonalities and Humble Folk in Italy.\ Chapel. :Speaking a,bout the personality of these \humble folks'' the Count ~aid that just as in England\ tlie , r~atest hero of her wonderful re- ~istance is the anonymous Btitish people, the same, some day, will b<) said of Italy .... The Italian peo- ple have been cheated and deceived during fifteen yems by t-he mo-st ~lever and devi.Jish of all propa- gandas-that of Fas~is:n. But as s;,on as the Itaiians will be given a ~,hoice, they will show their horror of wa.ts of conquest, and of alli- ances with Naziism; they will as- sert their old love for freedom. The same Ita:ians who fought heroicall~ 23 yea.r~ ago against Ger·mans, Aus- tt ians. and Hung at ians see t·oday the stupid E'mptiness of a war a·gainst small nations like Greece, just as they remember that Italy had never anything to fear from England. while Italy has been in- vaded ten times by Getmany.\ Following this address, the Count left the campus Wednesday after- noon for Westminster College in Missouri where he wiJ.l give three lectm es on \Total! tat ia·n ·wars anc the Future of Democracy in the World.\ Active Associatl\ Count SfOi·za's activities, during his full semester stay at Union in- ~luded, in addition to his twelve public le~tUtes class discussions and confet ences with faculty anc student members of the Interna- tional Relations Club. In these latter two-class discus- sions, and con!~t·ences, the tr·ue versatility of the formet Italian leader was most clearly shown Outside of treating of the compara- tive merits of democracy and Fas- cism with the sophomore sections of elcmentaty government, the ~ount talked with Dr. Silber's class on \Italian Literature\ on the same general topic to the \Compaiative Literature\ course of Professor 2offin, and on philosophic theories in vogue in Italy to the p-hilosophy classes. In addition to discussing the Eu- ropean situation -both past and present in conferences with mem- bers of the Intetnational Relations ~lub. the Count, upon question, also treated of political and economic East based on his experience as cond,itions in the Far and Near l 'ndoubtedlv there are some among us who had forgotten ~ .hat Count Carlo Sforza. exiled foreign minist.er of lt~ly, I C 1 N EM A Afic.i_a~l~.' assumed his duties on t~1e can~upu~ w~th the :~;~~I =======.:.! of \ JSJtJJJO' P1·ofessm· of lntematwnal helatwns, but \\e r~:: 1 • o · • • .

He wrote, the :::ount said, 'I spoke f.o·r two hours yesterday with two German gen- erals. Both told me that the most te~rible events in Europe now are :he German victories. The mote we .vin, the more our vict01y escapes us. \Ve are afraid we will end as in 1918.' The Spanish friend quoted the two generals as saying that such a fear had staved off invasion of Spain. Asked w.hetnet· he knew anything 1bout efforts of the Sforza family to set up a new Italian regime, as teported in European dispatches re- . ~ently, Count Sforza answered in the neg3tive. The Count laughed when reminded of clippings from ltalian press dispatches describing him as \a ver·y old and shaky man who hardly knows how to speak and walk.\ Actually he is hale and hearty and was often seen striding about the cam-pus in snowstorms or swimming in the college pool. To Visit Virginia Consistent with his policy of not meddling in American internal af- fairs, avowed at the beginning of this collegitae year, Sforza refused to comment on the adequacy of the !enc~-lease bill now ·being discussed by a Congressional committee. He made one observation, however, be- ~ause it was \psychological not po- litica·l:\ \Nothing good wm come from a .passing publicity mania for asking advice about any problem from anyone whose name is on the front page. In weighing international .problems since I was 25, I have learned how difficult it is to judge and decide. Thetefore, there is something surprising in seeing a great nation asking advice on inter- national problems of commercial aviators or anybody else equally ignorant of the deep problems of international affairs.' After his three lectures at West- minster College, Count Sfoxza will spend the second semester of this collegiate year at the University of Virginia where he will repeat sev- eral of the lectures he gave here but as he said, \improved by the learned discussions which followed each of my lectures at Union.\ The addresses that he has and will give will eventually be included in a book, the Count said. Union bids goodbye to a colorful personality. TCiTION NOTICE ATTENTION SENIORS! I NEWMAN CLUB Tuition, Student You are eligible to make app!ica- .

Mainly or:I. counters by Co- captains Mickey Rathlev and AI Turchick, the GarRet wrested a 7-4 lead afte·r about five minutes of play, only to see that blasted away, when Captain Hank Welker and Bob Yates suddenly exploded a f.a- tal flurry of baskets and started to move away into a lead that totaled 29-15 at the i'ntermission. While the Dutchmen continued to throw away passes, and miss ea>y Ul'lder- the-basket shots, Hobart was fash- ioning a highly efficient defen<;e, which was quite impervious to the home five, Union found little diffi- culty in working the baH down the sides, but ran into. considerably tougher going as plays down the center and into the ba8ket clogged up hopelessly. Rathlev High Scorer The second halt proved a bit m:ore thrilling, as the play became faster, but still the visiting outfit saw to it that they matched Union basket for bas·ket, and waited for the final gun. . Once again it was Co-Captain Mickey Rathlev who accounted for a large share of the Dutchmen's points. He dropped in 12, four of which were free throws, while Whitey Carnwright bagged six. Benny Jakabowski made six him- self, and, in addition, appeared at times the on!~· Union player who was able to get his share of re- bounds, both defensive and offen- sive. For Hobart, it was Captain Welker who really led his team to victory. His big \21\ was a steady factor in the GarneC·s dO\vnfall as he proved himself to be a fine de- fensive player as well as a s·erious scoring threat. His 13 points. led the Hobart point-getters,. while Bob Yates. with 12, and Eddie Popali- sky. with eight, helped form a strong supporting cast. PreHminary to the main game, AI Ciampa's freshman five lost a practice game to a quintet from Albany Law School. The freshmen trailed at half-time, 15-8, and the older team from Albany held its lead throughout the .,;econd half to win, 23-15. Summary of the main game.

Had Union made some of the lay up shots missed this season, the ball tossers record might be different. The g-reater use of Ronnie Ma- t:omber was predicted by Nels >~hen he said that the expel ience he has picked up lately made hirr, \fit in\ better. He was described as n hard worker and u player who did a \good job.\ Another fcctor to be considered is the playing of Mickey Rathlev. Against Amherst he was hot but against Hobart he was stone cold. Four times he threw the ball away in getting off poor passes. A Union victory or loss depends upon how his playing goes. Stevens recently beat Hamilton by one point and have several other victm ies under· their belt. Ed lsraels, captain and Sports Editor of the Stevens Stute, i~< a real lead- er on the floor.

All through the week parties arrive.d an.d left after do- ing a bit of do,.,\Ilhill skiing and their own. cooliing. This was the ftrst visit of the year for many. They found that the c:l'bin had ·been equipped with electric light:: which lessened the danger of fire and that pla,ns were bdn~,; JH ujecteu fut the purchatiC uf an electric stove. They also noted that the e'lectric lights mad;e the ca:bin stand out like a beacon and made an effective guide for skiing betwe:en Freebun1's barn and Ski Haberl. \\'eathPr Is Mild A contrast was inevitable be- tween this week end and that fa- mou~ Outing Club week-end after t•xams la~t year. Then 33 (s-ome claim more> packed themselves into the cabin which will hold 15 at thP· mo~t comfortably. They ~1ept in the main room, in the kitehen. on top of eaeh other, on and under the tables· and in. .fac.t l'VL•rywhere that they could. lie and be warm. That week-end, too, was cold and windy a-nd invited a com- pari:;on betwePn North Creek, N. Y., and Finland. That was the week-end that Duquette dro\'e his car deep into the gnow of Free- bmn's field, that John Bass was IPft in the \'illage and had to hike to the- cabin in the dead of night, that Ser·til pu~hed out window glass of the rl'ar window of the edHor of the \Ski New':-\ station V\.~agon. This· last WE'ek-end was \mild\ compared to that of a year ago. The weather wa& favora'ble, the temp<>rature up. The 15 or Eo who availed themselves of the cabin were somewhat c1·owded but com- fortable. The skiing was excellent and the club esscaped the injuries that Schenectadians who came up on the snow train ran into. Trouble came from another ·source --- automobiles. John Gard- ner, '41, ran into the front of a moving snow plow with a borrowed 1935 Ford aRd crumpled a fender besides Etoving in part of the grill work. John Warner's '35 Ford boil- ed and boiled all the way from Schenectady to North Creek be- cause part of the motor was frozen. Warner and his passengers, Norman Dietrich, '41, and So!Qmon Blechman, '42, made two starts from ·Schenectady because those u11-happy gentlemen discovered that D!Ptrirh had left his· binding-s in the Sigma Pai place. They also were treated to a ride to the top of Gore Mountain, before they reached the cabin, When Warner mistook the mountain road fm• the road to the cabin. The road might have looked funny to the group but they did not d-iscover their error Ulltil they reached the top. Coming back Monday night, the ice plug over the stop cock melted, allow- ing the water to run out. The re- sult, two cracked cylinder heads north of Warrensburg. But the most graphic story of the week-end was the entry in the Jog book by Alfred A. Knopf, Jr., '42. Wrote Pat: Entry from \Mein Knopf\ \Bob Molloy, '41; Pat Knopf, '42; Bud Ackerly. '44-left Union at 3:20 this afternoon <Jan. 24) iR Molloy's 1939 Mercury license L-798. We arrived here at 8:00p.m. --four hours and forty minutes. The reason-Molloy drives into four ditches; ending up in a deep one about three quarters· of a mile from the cabin. With much help, we get out of the first three ditches, but at the fourth ditch, we run into a pack of wolves, and we had to run for the cabin. As we neared Ski-Haben, Molloy dropped in the snow from exhaustion, while Knopf fell in the well. With unparalleled bravery, Ackerly .rescued first Mol- loy and then Knopf. Everyone thawed out and felt fine later. Mol- loy. before retiring, shut his eyes, and pretended, as he was drinking a glass of water, that he was' im- bibing at Smolky's. Amen!
