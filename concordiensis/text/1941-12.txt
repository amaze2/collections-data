These problems were essentially wrapped in the fact that liberal colleg:es would, in the not too distant future, be forced to alter their natures and policies in the face of the increasing demand for fullest utilization of all available resources that de- sire to win the war will force. Also presented was the statement that the1·e are two channels through which the new problems may be met. The Channels One alternative ·would see college resources developed under a policy set by agencies other than the colleges themselves, namely those of the government. This particular medium would suggest a solution that could not be significantly different from the Stu- dent Army Training Corps program of the last war that was found highly unsatisfac- tory by America's colleges. The second alternative would find the problems that liberal colleges face due to World War II faced squarely by colleges themselves. It would see the colleges, in col- laboration with the appropriate govemment bureaus, developing and organizing programs of their own. It is clear that this second alternative could not be immediately as successful in meeting practical responsibilities to the na- tion as would an SATC. The second repre- sents a system that would have to be devel- oped gradually. Example As one example of this gradual develop- ment of factors that will come sooner or later anyway, liberal colleges which are yet without ROTC training might establish Home Guard units, possibly uniformed by the state. This action would furnish oppor- tunity to students of the college to point to military training on their record when they were drafted after graduation. It would also be entirely possible that, as time went on and more officers were made available for train- ing duty, these Home Guard units could be changed into ROTC units with far less effort and far more reason than on those campuses where no military 1.mit at all was available. This second alternative-colleges' adjust- ing themselves to the emergency situation under their owB pressure-seems the wisest solution to the problem, from the college standpoint. Not only would a partial reten- tion of liberal college values during the emer- gency be insured, but their full return at the close of the emergency would be made surer than under any other system available. What We Can Do It would seem hig·hly advisable therefore that Union, as one of the liberal colleges bound to be affected, begin as soon as pos- sible an analysis of the new responsibilities that intensification of our war effort will call upon the college to assume. With this con- sideration as a preUminary basis for action, Union would have the opportunity to develop and empower a program whereby students and faculty wiH be able not only: 1. To fulfill their most important respon- si\bility today-that of staying right here on the job, but also 2. To develop opportunities for adapting the college gradually to responsibilities that the new problem will obligate it to face: a. Services to benefit the nation or its agencies-already begun, in a measure, by the Student Council's ''Smoke Screen\ idea. b. Facilities for obtaining the new kinds of training which the nation may well de- mand more and more from its liberal stu- dents if it permits them to remain in college -military and vocational training being chief cases in point. Since no organization now exists which could most effectively handle the consider- ation of these new problems, we would sug- gest the fo1·mation of a committee of stu- ::lents and faculty which would have such a consideration as its purpose. The college would thereby be able to con- sider now, before they become pressing real- ity, the solutions of these much feared prob- lems. outside the full routine, Comp- troller Anthony Hoadley may ·be asked to give a prelimina1y con- cert, featuring the famous spir- itual: 'Nobody Knows the Troub\le I've· Seen.' \ And to add to Dr. Fox's list of Mr. Hoadley's woes-a water pipe from, the library to the Ubrary field, put m last summer, burst late yes- terday, fl0oding the basement stacks to a depth of an half inch. Love Nest The third floor Silliman Ball apartment, the new Houghton resi- dence was called \the love nest of the Silliman Ha'll bird cage\ by one we'd like to see in a cage any day. We hope the Houghtons keep their promise of feeding the Con- cordly staff. Mrs. Houghton pledged herself to lowering a thermos bot- tle of hot coffee down to the staff every evening at nine. E. Pier·pont Fliegel, who has tried her cooking. reported on ela- borate mouth-watering breakfasts she has set before the Christian Association on Sunday mornings. Baked eggs of some sort were her opecialty. FacuHy Food No one student has. as yet sam- pled all the faculty wives' cooking.

It happened to him last SlJmmer. Said the magazine on Nov. 29: MEANING OF THE MANAGERS' COUNCIL \Couple of weeks ago, there was a party at a well known uptown res- taU!•ant-for a retiring professor at Columbia, if we have it rightly-- and one of -the guests noticed, while the fruit cup was being served, that his soup spoon had an unmist<:l!kable spot of egg on it. He showed it to the waiter, with some such muttered remark as 'What the hell~' The waiterd smiled sym- pathetically, shook his head, and pointed to another spoon beside the diner's plate. 'You've got the wrong one,' he whispered.'' The Managers' Council, which will conside1· its first business tomorrow night, holds within its organization the capacity fot· mak- ing possible the most sweeping economies that Union's fraternities have seen in a long time. For fraternity managers to meet merely for the purpose of talking about problems of mutual interest is certainly highly desirable in itself for the fraternities involved. When, however, the managers are able to exchange price lists while swapping \shop talk\ and when the managers are able to de- velop bases for cooperative buying of essen- tial Hems while discussing the comparative merits of linen and paper napkins-then the body in which such action may take place has possibilities that are really enormous. fraternity buying units come together in groups: A comparative study between Williams fraternities, among which coo·peration did not exist, and Amherst fraternities found average fraternity costs at Amherst $165 lower than those at Williams and attributed most of the disparity to the cooperation at The Students Amherst. · Vassar It must be recognized, of course, that Those dashing Sigs were at Vas- sar this weekend and reported they Union's Managers' Council will have to test played bridge in one of the girrs its wings slowly before being able to accom- rooms from three to 5 o'clock Sat- urday afternoon.

Vermont's center, Phil Chesarone, nearly made the team. Lawrence explained the ab- sence of Jannone, Lemke, and Bruckel by stating that he didn't think they showed the all-around ability, offensive and defensive, of the men he chose.

Origin of Plan A party of eleven Union College chemistry students, accompanied by Dr. Egbert K. Bacon, aseistant professor of chemistry, left Thurs- day afternoon for New York City, where they will visit the Exposition. of Chemical Industries being held iil Grand Central Palace. The ex- position, assembled every two years, shows all phases of the chemical in- dustry, and attracts scientists, pro- fessional chemists and students from :all parts of the country. The Union party on Friday will inspect the International Smelting and Refining Company's plant at Perth Amboy, N.

Returns are not measured .by pecuniary intake, but purely on the effect of the project to the ad- vancement of science. Students and teache~s travel from and to their homes at great savings on these College Special tickets. To make this saving, all you have to do is purchase one from your hometown rail- road ticket agent before returning from the Christmas holi- days. The cost is amazingly low-liberal return limits fit your school program -you can make stop-overs, too! There are reduced round trip Pullman rates, also. When Spring holidays come you can use the return coupon to travel home again or use it at close of school, The student body is in agreement on the need for more social affairs. But the proposal for a \Winter Dance\ has not yet gone beyond the \it's a good idea\ stage. -If we do not wish to allow a valuable function to pass out of the picture, a fresh- man dance will be held this year. -If we do not wish to allow a valuable function to pass out of the picture, a sopho- more dance \\ill be held this year. -The proposal for a Senior Dance, to round out a four year cycle of class dances, has not had a decision one way or another from the senior class or the college at large. -There have been suggestions to connect a Glee Club concert with a dance. All in all, therefore, we have the potential- ities for a wide variety of social functions, but we have not yet done anything about any of them. At the present moment we do not have the need for more social functions, so far as ideas for social functions are concerned. What we do need is action on the ideas we do have. BEST WISHES TO MISS TRAVIS We wish to extend the best wishes of the student body to Miss Froances Travis, whose fello·W workers in the Dean\ s Office helped her celebrate her birthday yesterday. This unusually capable lady has worked hard for U nian in a multitude of ways, not the least of which has been to aid a steady 60o/ 0 of the undergraduate body to employ- ment. Union appreciates it. POLITICS AND THE N. Y. A. It is extremely fortunate that the Wash- ington opponents of the National Youth Ad- ministration were not able to get their knives to the heart of the measure until now. Part- time jobs are plentiful, pai•ticularly for col- lege youth. For this reason we may tend to minimize the importance of the expected drop in an appropriation that has helped Union under- graduates through college for some years. The surface reasons for the N.Y.A. slash are somewhat obscure; in terms of objective criteria they become more so. Time Magazine reported on the matter that: \First Comptroller General Lindsay War- ren charged it (N.Y.A.) had tried to keep young men out of the United States Army. Then the Educational Policies Commission, a committee of \bigwigs\ representing U. S. school superintendents and teachers, pro- posed that the N. Y. A. be abolished. \Reporting; to Congress on an investigation of N.Y. A. during the past year, Mr. Warren declared he had found evidence of N.Y.A. misspending (on travel expenses, Christmas cards, excessive telephone pills, etc.). But his gravest charge vms that the N.Y.A., to keep up its quota of enrollees and to justify its appropriations ($161,000,000 this year) had asked Army recruiting officers to refrain from trying to enlist N.Y.A. boys. \U.S. educators believe N.Y.A. and C.C.C. are developing a separate educational system rivalling the public schools. Last week the Educational Policies Commission asked that both N. Y.A. and C.C.C. be discontinued as soon as they finish their emergency job of training defense workers and that their con- servation and building jobs be taken over by othe1· agencies.\ Apparently arguments against the meas- ure neglected to observe its positive effects on a host of American youth and certainly the advantages its funds have brought to many American college men and women, Union men certainly among them. A political argument in terms of personal frictions and alleged excesses may be built against any government agency that has ever been conceived. It is unfortunate that Washington pressure groups and representa- tives have been fit to use that form of argu- ment against a measure that has meant so murh to man~' American ~'otmg: pE>ople. Aid to Chinese The granting of money to scien- tists in 'China to enable them to keep on with their scientiHc efforts, the purchasing of scientific litera- ture current now for the ;benefit of the European scientists when the war is over, the increase of the Sigma Xi publication in size, and bases for membership into the fra- ternity were some of the topics treated by Dr. Ellery in his lecture tour. Our retired bead of the Chemistry Department experienced many an interesting situation on his trip. He 1 hopes that no scandal is caused by ' IMPORTANT-It is expected that on account of a heavy volume of Military furlough travel, as well as civilian holiday traffic, passenger travel during the forthcoming Christmas-New Year's Holiday period will be extremely heavy this year. If it can possibly be arranged for students to leave school December 17th or before and return to school January 7th or later, it is .urged they do so. It will also be found. easier to make reservations and more comfortable to travel on or before December 17, 1941, and on or after January 7, 1942.

He spoke at a ses- sion on \New Directions in the New World\ which climaxed the week-end con.fel'ence on inter- American reiations. It was generaly ag!'eed by the 150 members present that more than Pan-American solidarity was needed to make the world a better place to live in. The Western hemi- sphere cou:d not atta.cl' the prob- lem of totalitmianism alone. Francis White, former assistant secretary of state and chairman of the foreign bondholders' protective committee, also addressed the meeting. Flags of 21 American re- publics decorated the chapel. Union of Americas Don Alberto envisioned a federal union of the Americas, which he said would be \the international ex,periment of the ages\ in his ad- dress. Abolition of all tariffs and of all immigration and .passport laws and compulsory study of Spanish and Portuguese in the United States, and of EngHsh in South American countries. were part of his plan for a Pan-Ameri- can union, which he said would be- come a reality some day even if men lacked the vision to achieve it during this generation.

Steps to be taken in the United States if the same problem should develop here also were studied. A resolution was passed anc: sent to the national or- ganization in favor of lowering the initiation fee for Canadian chap- ters.

Of that number four are in the Army and Navy service. Col. Lawrence S. Churchill '12, is in the Air Corps at Nicols Field at Rizal, Philippines. Yesterday the National Broadcasting Com- pan reported \terrific damage\ at the airfield where gasoline supplies were destroyed by enemy bombers. Nicols Field is only a few miles from Manila. Two Union alumni are in Pearl Harbor. They are John K. Slotman '37, who is in a Naval Air Patl'ol Squadron and Ensign Maxwell R. Kleeman '40, who is serving aboard the USS Pensacola. William Merrit Yarnall '40, is at Fort Shafter in Honolulu. Oth- ers in Honolulu but not in the mil- itary service include John V. Do- lan '23, and Robert H. Lowrie '12. Only two Union alumni are in Japan at present. They are the Rev. Theodore Walser '10, a mis- sionary. and William H. Young '25, an official of the City Bank of New York. In the Philippines are Herman C. Kluge '05, an official of a lum- ber company in Baguio, which was also bombed by the Japanese yes- terday; Carrol C. Grinnel '19, who is a salesman for the G. E. appli- ances and a former resident of Osaka and Tokio, Japan; Harry Fenton '29, chief announcer of KZRC. Manila; Leahman B. Neas- tle '35, Insular Life and Robert D. Everest '37, with the Standard Vac- uum Oil Company. Three Union alumni are in Shanghai, China. They are Clar- ence Zeuyi Shi '29, Harry Tao-fon Sun '3:0, and Chung Phong Sun '31. Yesterday the departmental and divisional heads met in the Presi- dent's office and clarified the stand- ing of any student who may be drafted. The President then issued the following statement: \Students inducted und£'r selective service before the end of this semester wHI receive academic credit for the semestet· in accordance with their record to the date of their depart- t ure from college. Under this ar- ra·ngement attendance will be 1'£'- quired up to a date one weelt pre- vious to actual induction. \Degrees to Draftees \Similar credit and attendance will operate for students inducted under selective service after the first marking period of the second semester (the end of March). \Students so inducted during the first marking period of the second semester will be rebated their tui- tion payments for the remainder of the year. \When students return to the col- lege after service with the armed forces, every effort will be made to help them individually in adjust- ment to the work !'esumed.\ Dr. Fox squashed rumors that college degrees will be granted to drafted students. Reports have been circulating around the cam- pus that \since seniors were grant- ed degrees i!•.tring the last war though they d :,een dta<fted, they are doing to get them now.\ The President said that those who had received degrees in the past with- out finishing their college work had been gra.nted honorary degrees and not \degrees in course.\ Their de- grees also had been granted after the Armistice, No Military Training At present there is no possibil- ity of any sort of military training being given on the campus Dr. Fox said. He told of communications between the college and Robert P. Patterson '12, Under-secretary of War, in which the college had ask- ed if the department had any sug- gestions. Patterson had replied that the war department was opposed to any further extension of military training in colleges and was defi- nitely opposed lo the Canadian system ·of some training in the college and summer military du- ties. Dr. Fox also revealed a possible working agreement with the Ma- rine Corps by which they w0uld pick seven men for officer train- ing.

That we do have impressive national unity and that the Japane::;e have been presmnauly unable to damage critically either Pearl Har- uor or the defenses at ManHa is a fact for which we may feel thankful.

Movies were ,·cars. This shock of attack, launched at a time when peace negotiations were still in pro- gTess, was undoubtedly one of the elements upon which Japan counted for success. The Axi::; has long· made a stereotype of the theory that a sul'prise attack immobilizes a democracy fmm effective action for months. We gave the lie to the Axis stereotype. We were not immobilized; our external de- fenses stood firm and our internal cohesion was tremendously strengthened rather than significantly weakened. As soon a::; the Japanese uegan theil· at- tack, the American military machine went into action and units of the American navy, already \somewhere in the Pacific\ sought out and engaged enemy craft. J.\Iinutes aftee Washington heard of the Pearl Harbor at- tacl<, the govemment >vires \Vere flashing commands to army and navy for the opening of the sealed orders for the defense of the United States and her possessions. The Fed- eral BUl'eau of Investigation officially ac- knowledged its war time footing, and \Vent into action after saboteurs and enemy agents. Most important of all was the strength and courage with which the American ,peo- ple rose to the danger which threatened their land. A peace-loving nation which had yet hoped for a peaceful solution to the Japanese question, America reacted imme- diately to the treachery of the Japanese at- tack by complete national unity for facing and destroying the danger before us. The American people demonstl'ated that unity to the world yesterday when the Con- gress of the United States, in recot·d time, passed the resolution for the Japanese wm· with almost complete unanimity. Old time political rivalries and ancient personal hatch- ets were buried \for the duration\ and the And if it is true, as reliable rep0rts have indicated, that the Nipponese have been aule to take Wake and l\Iidvvay Islands and Guam, as well as damage and sink some of our cap- ital ships, then we are in for a hard time in the Pacific. We need not dwell in unrealities. It is cer- tain that Japan would not have acted against the United States and Britain if she hadn't received promises anG encouragement from Garmany and Italy, her Axis partners. We are as much at wa1· with Germany and Italy as we are with Japan, and we may rest as- sured that these states of war will be mem- orialized in the near future. We are finally faced with the full truth of what we have, in the past, recognized as c.nly half truth: we are in a World War to the finish-a war between two completely different wa,ys of life. We are at last able to call a spade a spade-the Axis is ouJ' enemy and we must and will des,froy it and the infamy it represents. Our immediate to.s-k is that of smashing away at Japan with all our resources so that, in the words of the Presid£.nt, we may unever again be called upon to face the threat of that same dan- ger.\ The status of and demands upon the in- habitants of the United States have really, however, not been significantly changed by the sensational developments of the past three days. American democracy still makes the same demands upon all of us that it has been making for some time: we must be available when needed, we must be strong, and we must be calm. Fot· some of Amet·ica's manhood this means service in the armed forces, for others services in the industries of the nation, for still others-the students of Union among them-the pursuit of various forms of civil- ian activity. The students of Union realize that the government will inform them of their spe- cific ablig«tions when they are needed, but that their chief responsibility right now is that of remaining in college and doing as good a job there as possible. Allan Jac:kson, '86 Dies on Sunday Allan H. Jackson, '85, vice pres- ident and general counsel of the I General Electric Co. until he re- tired in 1929, dropped dead on lower Union street, near the rooms of the Schenectady County His· torical society, at 1 o'clock Sun- day aftern0on. Physicians were hurriedly summoned but he was dead before their reached him. Mr. Jackson had been irn good health and active in his personal affairs up until the time of his death. Mr. Jackson was a native of 1 Schenectady, born June 23, 1864., He attended the Union Cla~sical institute, graduated from Union I college in 1886 and f1·om Albany Law school two years rater. He entered the law office of his father, Judge Samuel W. Jackson, of the state 5'Upreme court, remaining un- til 1892 when he went to New York vvith the law firm of Chanler, Maxwell and Phillip. Three years, later he returned to Schenectady, entering in to partnership with his father until 1902 when he joined General Electric's legal department. In 1912. at the death of HinsdiU Parsons, Mr. Jackson became head of the law department and in 1922 was electP.d a vice president and general counsel, a position he held until his retirement. Devoted to Union Mr. Jackson was a member of St. George's Episcopal church, a trustee of Union college, dir.ector of the Schenectady Trust Co., mem- ber of Kappa Alpha, the Union club and Bankers club in New Yol'lt and the l\'!ohawk club, Mo- hawk Golf club and Edison club in Schenectady. Mr. Jackson never marri('d and resided with his brother, John, and sister, Mrs. H. V. N. Phill-ip at 27 Washington avenue. He is survived by one other brother, Coi. Frank Jackson of Greenfield, Can- ada, and another sister, Mrs. H. W. Preston, of E!imra. Dr. Dixon Ryan Fox, president of Union col- lege, declared la>:'t night that \Allan Jack>'On has been one of the most helpful and devoted of our Union college alumni. \In fact, I can imagine no finer idea-l for any college than that all of its alumni be Allan Jackson's. GUEST EDITORIAL \For many years he has been a t-rustee, and mol'e recently the chairman of the board's committee on building· and grounds. When, in 19313 on the 50th anniversary of his graduation, he was given the hon· orary degree of doctor of humane letters, he was gratefully cited on behalf of the college as 'cherish-· ing her welfare in his daily con- cern and bringing wisdom and ex- perience to her deliberations; illus- trating in his personality the finest traditions of the Old Dorp as well as of the college, a living example to all of us as to what a gentle- man should be'.\ December 8, 19H FoUl' days ago I took advantage of an in- vitation from President Fox to address the student body of Union College. J.\ly discussion concerned the position of Japan in the Orient, and my purpose was to familiarize my fellow students with the causes and l'easons for Japanese expansion in that particular po1·tion of the world. Whatever I said at that time I said with the firm conviction that I was speaking the TRUTH, and for that my convictions remain the same. Yesterday, however, the Imperial Japanese government turned away from the Orient, and undertook an unprecedented military ag- gression against the United States. Without waming sa\·e for the methodical hum of ap- p1·oaching Japanese aircraft and the bom- bardment from near-by Japanese naval units, American forces in Pearl Harbor and lVIanila were attacked.

He even went oO far as to say that he hadn't been informed that there would be a league. ---o--- IT PAYS TO ADVERTISE Almost everybocj reads The Con- cordiensis, but have you ever stopped to think how lonely Tom Gould gets on cold Tuesday nights. It pays to advertise in The Con- cordiensis and besides everybody does. Bob Baker's making his fare- wells. Late Thursday night or early Friday morning he leaves for California, where he is sched- uled to report for duty as an army flying cadet at Ventura air field at Oxnard. 1 His Chi Psi fraternity brothers will give Baker a sena-off party Thursday night which should set him on the road to the west coast in the right kind of spirits, despite the tense situation. During the past week since he received notifica- tiion to report for duty, Baker has spent much of his time on the cam- pus. He was even seen in several classes. Ohi Psi will miss Baker. So will his many friends. So will Union's athletic teams. He would have been hockey captain. Art Lawrence was counting on him to do most of Union's scoring again. ---0----- LADIES ON LOOSE \Ladies on the Loose\ alias 16 Smith girls put on a swell show at Northampton Friday night with the aid of nine Am;tersts who played male roles in the production.

Ald- rich, '42, chairmaJ:l of the drive an- nounced today. 424 packages of cigarettes were collected from all but four houses which will probably give their share this weekend. Aldrich called the drive a success aJ:ld pointed out that the amount given represented contributions from every foqrth student which is considered a good average by such organizations as the Cummuni:ty Chest which make long and sustained driveS'. If the contributions represented an average of what Union smokes, Chesterfields are easily the college favorite Aldrich said. He revealed that 230 packages of Chesterfields, 96 of Camels, 47 of Lucky Strike, 42 of Philip Morris, 8 of Old Golds, 1 of Raleigh, and 2 of Pall Mall had been collected. Money Not Talien Co:Iections were made Monday evening from the majority of fra- ternity houses, Tuesday morning from the Chape~ and later during the week from frater11ity houses that had ·been slow in gathering cigarettes.

The students of Union College voted an endor~ement of the Fac- ulty's plan this morning to shorten the college year by four weeks, in order to advance national service. By this plan the students give up half their Christmas vacation, ac- cept a heavier program. prepare for a highly concentrated examin- ation schedule in January and at the end of the year, and made pos- sible a Commencement on :\.iay 11 or 12 instead of June 9. This re- arrangement releases 750 men for productive employment four weeks earlier than in normal years and gives selective service students more education before such date as they may be called. Action Lauded The sacrifice of a holiday week when many social engagements had ·been made shows a mature sense of the gravity of the national need, according to Dr. Fox. He added that in the interest of defending national life and liberty Union Col- lege has subordinated the pursui• of happiness. Four student speakers and the President urged a decision one w<-.y or the other this morning in Chapel. Following their speeches, ballots reading \Vote on Spacing Two Vireeks Vacation·· Check one- December 20 <~oonl-December 28 (plu.s New Year's Dayl-December 20-January 4, ~o Spring Vacation\ were distributed. Through a typing error in mal{· ing up the ballots the information about a spring vacation was left off the baliot but the President tolll the assembly that the first choice included that vacation. ------------------------------------ President Robert K. Killian '42, head of the Student Body and the Student Council, reminded the audience that we were in the midst of a grave national emergency and that all were agreed on the shorten- ing of the college year. He pointed out that after four years experi- ence it was his belief that the long stretch from January to :March or as suggested from January to May was a definite nerve strain and that a spring vacation was neces- sary for the smooth running of the college.

We felt that we would almost certainly be taken out of college for one form of service or another, in an extremely short tiiHe. \\' e felt that otu· nomml tasks and nol·- ma:l occupations would pass away suddenly. vVe see the future somewhat more soberly aml more realistically today, after the shock has worn off. We see that things do not change as suddenly as we thought they did, even in war-time, and that most of Union's students m·e not going to be directly affected by the conflict for some time. Those of us who are eligible for military service 110\V recognize that there is still some time before we will be called to duty. There are factors such as the necessit~· for building new camps, training ne\V officers, and manu- factming new equipment. Those of us who m·e under draft age now realize that there is little possibility of con- scripting men under 21 for some time. There has been no suggestion of a proposal for labor consc1·iption, while lowering the draft age is still being bandied about in the idea column. Logic would lead us to believe that aH early passage of 18-44 legislation would be fm more for the pmpose of permitting draft boards the use of additional months for the clerical job of classification, than it y,·ould be for the purpose of furnishing sol- diers immediately. \\' e see ftuther that the day by day occur~ rences of o\ilr lives have not been foo greatly altered, beyond the increased responsibilities and anxieties that have been placed upon us. We still work at our jobs and our class obli- gations, we still are busy in our extra-curri- cular activities, and we still have a desire to go to Skidmore of a Saturday night. Today, six days after Japanese bombs blew the United States squarely into World War II, the students of Union recog:nize that the drastic changes that the war will force upon them will come slowly, and not in im- mediate flood. They recognize that the pull ahead is going to be long and hard, and that in it will be applicable much the same cri- te!ia for achievement that they are lear11.ing at college. The students of UnioH recognize now, in pe1·haps more meaningful fashion than they did eal'lier, that their real responsibility, particularly under the new college calendar decided upon today, is remaining right here and learning as much as they are able. They recognize now that this job is not going to be an easy one-that of remaining at a nor- mal occupatio:n in times that are far from normal. They recognize that it will take just as much initiative and just as much courage to stay here, reading about principles of gov- emment or even principles ot' physics, as it does to chuck it all and move on to some other field that may, at the moment, seem to be of greater benefit to the nation as a whole. WE RECOGNIZE OUR RESPONSIBILITIES Tuesday evening last, the President of the United States reminded the American people of the \nil out sacrifices\ that they will be required to make in order that this nation may win ultimate victory. In this war- which has been begun with a defeat and is certain to be long and hard-every man and \voman must, to the best of his and her abil- ity, do those things whe1·eby they ma;v best help America's war efort grow greater and more powerful. Twenty-fom· hours later-Wednesday at eight-a special session of Union's Student Council heard Dr. Dixon Ryan Fox explain the plan through the operation of which L'nion College would be able to do its part and to fulfill the responsibilities that the President of the United States had outlined for the nation: The 750 students in the college should be allowed io complete their collegiate obliga- tions as early as is feasible, so that their work may be made available to the country as soon as possible. For Union this would mean Commencement in early May. Union's students and faculty would be call- ed upon to give up, a week and a half before it was to begin, half of their Christmas holi- :lay. All other scheduled college recesses were to be suspended, and a streamlined ex- amination period would replace the tradi- tional mid-years. Students would be forced to cancel previous obligations and \study catch-up\ plans for the holidays; faculty members would have to give up plans for what was really their only vacation during the academic year, and many of them would be forced to relinquish hopes of attending professional society gatherings which are scheduled for that portion of December in which Union will institute class work. But the nati'cm would have many more weeks of wark from 750 men. With near unanimity of opinion, the Stu- dent Council aproved the plan in straw vote on Wednesday night, and renewed that ap- proval officially the next afternoon after President Fox had explained the proposal to the entire student body in daily assembly. Yesterday afternoon the newly appointed Faculty Committee on Education, the \col- lege senate,\ passed the plan along. Last night the executive committee Stu- dent Council, after further consideration and after further investigation among students and faculty, decided to add a week's vacation in March to its plan. It was felt that this va- cation would ease the tension that the long steady strain inevitably develops at that time. The student body, in daily assembly this morning, voted its approval of the plan that the Student Council had presented it, reject- ing an alternative pro:posal for a two week Christmas holiday that the Council had de- cided against. Union would make its small attempt in the nation's effort to win the war. The Union community, nine hundred strong, is but an infinitesimally small seg- ment of a great nation. Yet its students, faculty and administration have mirrored the rising mass civilian spirit of that nation. With clarity of purpose and unanimity of opinion they have recognized their respon- sibilities. They have translated these re- sponsibilities into the plan whereby those on Union College may best be fulfilled-with the standard of action being \what is best for the country\ rather than \what is eas- iest for us.\ 2 • • • malie th' 'e M ·. an·· ''and industry.

Many of these are imported but others are made in America, and some of the best are those hand-woven, hand- dyed ties made in Santa Fe and other western cities. No man ever has too many hand- kerchiefs. White cotton ones are always acceptable, and if you think about it ten days in advance, you can have time to have a half doz- en monogrammed without too much expense. Midnight blue or white initials are smar·test. Handkerchiefs and shirts should not match, but they should be in harmony as far as color is concerned. Many men use solid blues and grays in their vest pockets. Others l:ave designs, particularly stripes and plaids. There is an increasing use of paisley silk handkerchiefs for the breast pocket.

In the pro,per sense, it is only an island of 4 square miles. The British took this sma•ll island from China in 1841, as a result of the Opium War. It alw signifies, however·, a.n area of 400 square mi:es --including the Hong Kong extinct volcanic island, Kowloon, and the New Territory, both on the southem tip of the peninsula op- posing Hong Kong in the north, separated from the ·island by a nar- row strip of water, and ma·ny other small islands SUITOUndlng the Hong Kung isla·nd. The latter definition is used by the newspapers and is thu~ understood by the people here. Island Overcrowded Hong Kong is located along the south eastern coast of China. at the mouth of the Pearl River, and is a·bout 100 miles south of Canton. There is a railroad connecting Hong Kong and Canton and was jointly controlled by the Chinese and British governments. Normally it has a population of a little over ha·lf million. However. since the invasion of Shanghai and the .fall of Canton, the population has in- creased well over one and a half million. More than 95<ff of them are Chinese. The bulk of the popu- lation is concentrated in the is- land and Kowloon. The New Ter- ritory is a rural area and the small is:ands are, in gene1al, unpopu- lated. These small islands, however, have tremendous strategic values of defending Hong Kong from en- emy's a-pproaching by sea. More than 6 years ago, 1as far back as I can remember), Hong Kong had already been planted with search lights and anti-aircraft guns. With· out doubt, they have planted more search lights and anti-aircraft guns since then. And more of the coastal guns and machine-gun nests. in ad- dition to the mines and submarine nets have also been installed. Hong Kong harbor has a military airport, a naval dock and small shipyards.

Allan Jackson was a ta:ll, erect man of aristocratic bearing; the word \gentleman\ came to your mind as soon as you saw him. There was no show-off about him. He was a bit aloof, modest, but Open Minded Always His interests were never nar- rowly professional. He read good books and anderstood their signi- ficance. Both his trruining as a law- yer and his work in a great cor- poration tended to rnalre him con- servative in thought. The New Deal drove him •0Ut of the Demo- cratic party, and at times he could explode a·bout \that man in Wash- ington.\ But all this nevet· blinded him to new conditions nor was he unwilling to try to understand them. To preserve this qual'ity of mind when he was past seventy years of age was a tribute to his courage as well as to his mental vigor.

Are Temporarily Dropped: Others Will i!e Curtailed No conclusion was reached nor any concrete plans made at the conference. Representatives of an insurance company were also there to present a sickness insurance plan which would begin to op- erate three days after students had entered a hospital and would pay for a certain total amount of days a year. Students woald be allow- ed to choose their own doctors. The plan appeared to the eommit- tee to have been another version of the many accident and health insurance plans already submitted to this campus which have failed to click. The meeting was an outgrowth of recommendations made by the Proctors' Committee to the Board of Trustees in October. Professor Smith as well as the other proc· tors have long felt the need for additional medical care for stu- dents on this campus and especially in the dormitories. P·ropose In1irmary They are said to have proposed that an infirmary be built on the ground floor .of Olygym Hall. At least eight rooms would be set aside, six of them to be used as hospital bedrooms and the other two as doctor's offices. There would be no entrance or exit into the dormitory and no other means of communica·tion between the regu- lar residents of Oldgym Hall and the patients. who would thus be isolated. The lava-tory facilities of the dorm could be easily adopted to the needs of an infirmary. The infirmary would serve both dormitory and fraternity students. To finance the improved health service students would pay a spe- cial health tax which would be collected along with the tuition. Ah infirmary would be expensive to mtaintain as it would have to meet the heavy health standards set up by New York State. This would probably mean the mainte- nance of a full time nursing staff. At present students must pay the complete cost of any hospital care which they may need. Many are treated free of charge in the doctor's office in the gym and are sent to bed in dorm or fraternity houses. The greatest danger there is the possibility of a contagious disease spreading. The meeting between the com- mittee, administrative officais and Mr. Wright took place before the start of the war. No plans were made. Whether the idea will be scrapped until the end of the war or not could not be !earned today. ----0---- Administration Denies 'No New Year's Party' Rumors Ch·culating 'Over $50' Stolen ·From Delta Chis Police are still investigating the theft of \over $50\ from the Delta Chi house Friday evening. Members of the ft•aternity de- clined t~ name the perst:ms who lost money nor the amounts taken from each individual. Nor did they know just how the thief went through the house. But they \guessed\ that he entered the house through the front door, which was not locked, went upstairs to the study rooms and was able to !'an- sack desks and clothes for some- time. Delta Chis were asleep on the third floor of the house. The last time the Delta Chi houst was robbed membe·rs said was \in that series of robbel'ies two or three years ago.\ Williams RobberiPs WILLIAMSTOWN, MASS. - Fil- ching cash from under the noses of sleeping scholars, a light-finger- ed night hawk made away with some eighty od.d dollars worth of capital assets in the form of bills, coins and railroad tickets at the Delta Phi and Delta Upsilon Houses of Williams College last Tuesday night between 2 and 6 a.m. -~---0---- fiynn Wins Fin Thomas Flynn '45 won the Moun- tebank's fin at the drawing M·onday morning. The organization offered all freshmen a chance to win five sil- ver dollars for attending the per- formance of \Outward Bound.\ Freshmen registered at .the door and were given numbers much in the manner that neighborhood theatre~ conduct bank night, kitch- enware night or doll night. D1·awings were made by officers of the freshman class. Flynn held the winning number and Gordon Rust poured the silver cartwheels into his hands. Thatcher, co-ordinator of the local CAA unit, pointed out in a recent announcement. Dr. Thatcher said that seniors in particular, who are in danger of be- ing drafted before the completion of the present school year stand an excellent chance of being de- fened unti'l June by the Army shoald they became enrolled in the CAA. In addition, the Army and Navy Air Corps, due to the need for college graduates in their ranks, will, according to past prec- edent, will tend to discriminate in favor of CAA pilots, who will have not only the benefit of flight training, but are college graduates as well. Dr. Thatcher said that no word ha·d come from Washington as yet with regard to the status of former CAA students who are not as yet in the service. Next .course Feb. 1 The local unit has been authori- zed to go ahead with plans f.or the new course which will start Feb. 1, 1942. These include the holding of the receipt of applications and the holding of medical examina- tions. The co-ordinator emphasized the importance of applying early. \Men are apt to find themselves in unfortunate positions with re- gard to the draft and come to us asking what can be done about it. After the first of February at the latest, we won't be able to do any- thing.\ In a survey conducted by the lo- cal CAA group including all stu- dents who have completed either primary or secondaory training be- fore this wall, it was found that all but three of the men who were in the army at the present time are in the Army Air Corps. The same situation existed in the Navy. Naval Commissions Available There will be a meeting this eve- ning of all Juniors and Seniors majoring in engineering, chemistry or physics who are interested in securing commissions in the Naval Reserve. The meeting will take place in Room 107 of the General Engineering Building at 7:30. Lieut. Commander W. L. Field, head of the Naval R. 0. T. C. unit at R.P.I. will be in attendance to answer questions and clear up details.

The party will ru-n from 6 to 8:30p.m. Last year's party featured sev- eral student skits, music, a magic show and a drawing for several passes to Proctor's Theatre. ----0•---- Mrs. Fox 1 Stillman Hunt 'Mean• Thief W. James Stillman '42 and Mrs. Dixon Ryan Fox were on the hunt today for one of the \meanest thieves\ to come on the campus in years. The thief broke into the Me- morial Chapel some time between 2 and 6 a. m. Sunday morning and stole a fifty cent Christmas tree. College officials in charge of decorations had to replace the tree in a hurry before the Sunday serv- ice. Entry to the chapel was gained by smashing a window pane next to the window catch, un)lock;ing the window and crawling through. Stillman hinted that the tree was in. a nearby fraternity house. Five Man Defense Council Is Formed A five man committee has been formed to act temporarily as a de- fense counsel for the college, whose functions will be similar to those of city defense councils in organiz- ing for civilian defense. Headed by Anthony Hoadley, comptroller of the college, the committee also in· eludes Samuel Johnson, head of the grounds c1·ew, Robert Stanley, instructor in eng-ineering and proc- tor of North College, Frederick Wikoff '43, and Robert Bishop '43. This committee is only tempo- rary, and it will eventually be en- larged. No action of any sort has been taken as yet. This is primarily due, Mr. Hoadley said, to the in- ability of obtaining an appoint· ment with Robert Christie, chair- man of the Schenectady Defense Council, as yet. Mr. Hoadley has on three occasions attempted to get an appointment with Mr. Christie, but for undisclosed rea- sons each attempt has met with failure. A blackout has been planned for next week in Schenectady, and the students will be home, no test on the campus can be made. Mr. Hoadley indicated that plans will be formulated after the meeting with Christie, and orgar\izational work will then commence. ---0---- Sixteen Initiated By Four Fraternities Sixteen men were initiated by four fraternities over the week- end. Of the sixteen, five were freshmen and in only two houses did the initiations represent a gen- eral one. Following quickly on the heels of the Student Body vote in Daily Assembly Friday Dean Charles F. F. Garis released the new col1ege calendar which covers college events from December 20 to August 18. At the same time Director of Athletics J. Harold Wittner an- nounced the complete elimination of heshman spring sport teams and severe curtailment of the var- sity athletic program. He said ·the move was necessitated by the pre- mature closing of college early in May. Golf and tennis will be temporar- ily suspended as varsity sports and the base·ball and track teams will be forced to play a:b.breviated schedules. It is possible .that the la- crosse team may get in a m&jority of its scheduled matches by play- ing them during March. Freshmen will not be allowed to become can- didates .for varsity teams, Wittner said. The college will plunge into in- tensive work following a New Year's recess. Hour examinations, which are to replace the reg·ular mid years. will be given during the week of January 5 and the first semester .will end on the lOth. Foundet·'s Day has not been changed and will be held as usual on February 25. Marks will 'be dis- tributed on Saturday, Fe:bruary 28 instead of March 15. A Week in the Spring Spring Recess will start at noon Saturday, March 14 and end Mon- day morning, March 23. Sub-Fresh- man weekend will remain the same March 27-29. Junior Prom has been moved up to the weekend of April 10, fully a month earlier than the traditional date. Prize day will be Apirl 22, examinations will start on the 30th and end May 6. Next day Survey- ing summer school will begin. The commencement weekend will follow its usual traditional pattern but will fall exactly one month earlier than usual. On Friday May 8 the Extempor- aneous Prize Debate, the meetings of the alumni organizations, the trustees and societies will be held. Saturday will be Alumni Da.y, on Sunday the President will preach the Baccalaureate Address and re- ceive the graduates and Com- mencement will fall on Monday, May 11. Chief repercussion of the calen- dar change has been the dropping of freshmen spring sports. With the :moving up of the whole school calendar, spring vacation, during which the baseball trip was to have been made ,falls early in March, too early for baseball. The schedule will now consist of only four or five games. Coach Wilford Ketz's track schedule has been cut to two meets. A 1 evised spring schedule will 'be announced in the near future. ---0--- Schedule Annual Physics Lecture The loss of a pane of glass was called an especially distressing de- struction. Dr. Fox pointed out that the amber and clear panes might be compared to stained glass win- dows in a church and as such were just as hard to replace. The war has made high grade glass scarce. The new calendar keeps the ini- ation date recommended by the student Council as a change from the December initiations March 6-7.

Neatly fore, the wa1· has not yet proved State to give u:; a taste of Lor.dcn, recorded by Glenn Miller & Co. There have really been two distiHct ele- ments discernible in the development of stu- dent govemment at Union. One has been a force driving· for a decrease in \campaigns in \electioneering and in \fiery contests.\ The uther has been a move toward increas- ing the interest of Union students in their government, usually by infusing into campus government the factors of partisanship upon which om· national gove1·nment is based. These two elements have never been equally ba.lanced, and it is the first which is riding the crest of the wave at the present time. When the present Student Council system was initiated in 1938, it was felt that the mess in which the student g·ov- emment of the time found itself would be cleared up only by a \very tightly organized\ system in which electioneer- ing· and campaigning would be at a min· imum. This resulted in a Council setup characterized by secret nominations, by nominations for positions made by the Council members in the class directly above the one which would vote on the nominees and election of the man who would act as Student Body President by 3 l/3o/c of the entire Student Body. The system \Vas certainly the swiftest an- swer to the problem. It cleared up whatever mess the student govemment of the time might have been in. It eliminated campaign conflict and electioneering, or at least it re- duced the numbers \vho could participate in such maneuvers. It did not, however, do anything towat·d increasing stud-ent interest in campus gov- ernment. The trend was the other way, as a matter of fact. This year's Student Council has made a strong effort to increase campus interest in its govel'llment. Aided by administration at- tempts to give mo1·e and more opportunity for the voicing of student opinion, the Coun- cil has attained a certain degree of success in its endeavor. Interest in student govern~ ment at Union has certainly increased this year. But before any real development in stu- dent interest may be attained, there are ce1·- tain factors v.;hich must be eliminated in the system under which the present Student Council s;ystem operates. For the Student Council elective system, this would result in these suggestions: 1. Since the President of the Student Body (who is also Chairman of the Student Council) is the leader and representative of all campus government and its policy forma- tion, he should be elected directly b;\· the Student Body at large. This election might work through a poll of the entire Student Body with the candidates the seven seniors- to-Le, who had been previously named as in the past. Since the secretary and treasurer of the Student Council are more directly offi- cers of the Council and less directly policy forming agents and representatives of the campus at large, they should be elected by tii.e Council itself. 2. Since the fratemity and neutral repre- sentatives of the Student Council are the direct representatives of their respective classes, their nomination and election should be brought as close to these classes as is pos- sible. This involves open, rather than secret nomination. It involves nomination of class rep1·esentative by members of the class in- volved, at least in part, rather than by mem- bers of a class above. Next spring, approximately five sowho- mores (the number of men that class seated on the Council) will nominate all the fresh- men upon whom the class of 1945 will vote fol' their sophomore Student Council repre- sentatives. It certainly does not seem that any five members of a class other than the one concerned can do an adequate job of nomination. Title two of the Constitution of the Stu- dent Government at Union College reads: \The Student Council shall be the active legislative body of the Student Govemment of Union College. It shall guide student af- fairs, represent the undel'graduates to other bodies, represent the students in cases of student discipline, confer with the College Administration and Faculty on matters per- tinent to student welfare, and set up neces- sary mechanism for efficient execution of the legislative measures of the student gov- ernment.\ With the establishment of the new Faculty Committee on Education this \representing the undergraduates to other bodies\ becomes all the mo1·e important. There is not, how- ever, any direct channel for such representa- tion. The best that the Student Council can do is to send its Chairman to see an administra- - tion officer or a member of the Education Committee to explain the student outlook on certaiil topics. It cart, too, draft a letter. Suggested to remedy this situation would be a conference committee of student and faculty leaders. Four Student Council lead- ers and foul' Education Committee leaders could meet at those times when problems re- quiring joint consideration came up-wheth- er telescoping the college year or working· out a cut system. This conference commit- tee, by providing liaison between the Student Council and the Education Committee, would go a long way toward making up the campus government system at Union more definite. IRRESPONSIBLES The man or men who broke into J.\.Iemorial Chapel the other night will probably be in- terested to knO\v that, barring unusual good fortune, the pane of stained glass that they broke is almost impossible of immediate re- placement. They vdll probably have to add that knowl- edge to the rest of their morning- after thoughts. It is really all a question of possessing a sense of 1·esponsibility, no matter what the circumstance a man may be in. The student body has usually been used to its members having that sense of responsibility. that American collegiate youth is in nineteen forty during such a II -S. G. weak and need tal'e ·to d1·ink.

As our hero, whose name is Victor Daneski, was Iool,ing over the lesson he had planned for the day, an amused look began to play across his face. Turning a quizzical eye to his class he said, \Looks like I received some poetry today.\ \From whom?\ shouted a chorus of voices. \I dunno,\ replied the student teacher. but I'll read it to you. While the students are exchang- ing looks of suspicion he read the following jingle entitled: \To Mr. Daneski.\ \Black coat, grey pants, always dressed to style, Brown hair, brown eyes, plus a darling smile. Polished shoes, neat tie, this is your appPa1·ance, l\Iay you stay through each day without interference.\ By the time Mr. Daneski had finished reading the last 'line, a cer- tain blonde, !mown to her 12B classmates as Mary Alice Sprague, had turned the prettiest shade of pink you'd ever hope to see. Mary Alice :;hyly acknowledged her mas- terpiece and work returned to nor- mal until the next day. It was then that Mr. Daneski re- taliated with the following verses which he read aloud amid scornful whispers of \mush\ from the boys and deep sighs from the girls. \Tre.sses blowing in the breeze, Wavy !celts so fair and fine; Naught compares in grace to these, I only wish that they were mine. Eyes as brilliant as the dew, Full of soft content and love, Colored li·ke a sky of blue, Blessed as though an angel above. Cheeks so soft with natural fire ... etc. -and so far on into the period.

Whtle the mot ning and afternoon serv1ees are always the work of the choir as a unit, certain individ- ual performers carried off their· parts with glory. George Coler.

Tidmarsh, was. as all have come to expect, an artist in every sense of the word. Gen- ('t·al acceptance of his work down through the years has detracted not at all from its quality. Three numbers, not originally in- cluded in the afternoon's program, were added at the request of some of the morn-ing's audience. The choir re-sang the spirited \Pat-a- Pan,\ and the ever-popular \Good King Wenceslas,\ while Dt·. Tid- marsh added the beautiful \Noel Eccosais\ to his recital repertoire. Dr. and Mrs. Fox Ente-rtain Just before the afternoon recital, Dr. Tidmarsh advised the choir to \loosen up\ a bit, since he thought they were trying too hard. The real \loosening up\ came after- wards when the entire group ac- cepted President and Mrs. Fox's invitation to supper at their home. Despite the sumptuous meal set before them, the choiristers gath- ered around the Fox's piano and sang some of their better-known .:elections. Assisting the Fox's in entertain- ing the hungry singers were Mr. and Mrs. Ben Whittaker and Rev. and Mrs. Herb Houghton.

The ·meeting was to have :been a makeup meeting for the one that was to have been held on Decem- ber 17. Notice was given in Chapel and in this newspaper. President Edward Bates of the Freshman class told the Council of pla:ns for a joint class dance with the Sophomores. Because of the new shortened college calendar it was impossible for both classes to hold sepa-rate dances, he said, and instead it seemed a logical thing to him that the classes combine forces so that they could have a \real bang up affair.\ He pointed out that there were few eligible weekends when the gym was clear and when it would not conflict with other ac- tivities and suggested that the date of February 21 be considered. John Clowe, President of the Sophomote Class, thought that a joint dance would ·be a good idea. They both suggested that the plans be brought before a meeting of the classes. Following further c0nversation they decided to hold a joint Fresh- man-Sophomore class meeting in the Old Chapel Monday, January 5, at 10 a. m., to discuss plans for the dance and to receive sugges-~ tions from class members as well as seek evidences of support. President Killian announced that the committee which picks the Junior Prom Chairman, would in- terview candidates for that position in the very near future. The date, he said, would be announced in Chapel, posted on the board out- side the Old Chapel and carried in a news story in The Concordiensis. The Council heard Ray Aldrich ask that the initiation date again be moved forward. He told them that the present initiation date was not the best one because it would leave the f-reshmen only a few meetings before college would close. He said that it was i-mperative for them to attend some meetings be- fore the house elections. Questioned by council members he said that the draft was a major factor as all of the Kappa Alpha members from half .the sophomore class could be called before the close of school. A straw vote showed the Council completely in favor of the date switch. President Killian said that the executive committee would meet with the President and the Dean to fix a more suitable date. ------ 4 -------------- !'l\l\:\''\'s·\'=a;.\n''\'\t\a'\=w'\\\\'. a_,~s'\\''~H=e\\r\\\\e-\\.,.,.,.., I NYA Slash Starts March 15/~~~.~:i~:·~:..,~rw~oe:i~ Ho_ad~ey Names !

Yuen Predicted Japanese Strategy Writing in the December 12 is- sue of The Concordiensis, Shiu Kong Yuen '42 said: \Another point I want to mention pa:rticu- larly is Hong Kong's water sup- plies. Hong Kong is surrounded by salt water. Thus the popula- tion depends for its wate·r supply entirely upon whatever amount of water it can accumulate in the Reservoir during the rainy sea- son. Although from a military point of view, or even as a mat- ter of common sense, it is ex- tremely difficult to drop a bomb directly hitting the Reservoir from 15,000 to 20,000 feet a·bove and we can take it for gran ted that the Reservoir is well pr-o- tected, there is a chance for the Japanese to score a \lucky\ though catastrophic hit, which would ruin Hong Kong's only water supply.\ The London story telling the reasons for the surrender of Hong Kong to the Japanese in- vaders spoke of many \catastro- phic hits\ upon the city's water supply system. Pipes and mains were shelled so often that they could not be replaced thus forc- ing the surrender of the island because of lack of water for the population and troops. ----- ---------- by the National Youth Administra- i Jl y pI I Gymnasium. -Prof. \\'i:ttne·r. t-ion on the Union campus until II n ree . ear . an I Ba-iley Hall-- Prof. \Vhitak('l'. after ~l:arch 15, Miss Frances Tra- Benedict's Barn--Dt·.

Aldrich '42, revealed in a letter 1 ead in Student Council meeting last night. Failure of parents to reply was the main reason that cigarettes were not sent to many other cmen on the list the Dean's office gave him, he told The Concordiensis earlier in the day. The 16 pack- ages sent represent a carton and three-fifths of cigarettes. Aver- age postage on the 'bundle varied from 8 to 15 cents depending upon the zone in which they were to go. Postage will come from the Student Council funds. Cigarettes remaining will be saved to mail to Union men who may be drafted. ----0---- Union to Celebrate (j)uiet New Year's A check made yesterday indi- cated that most Union College fra- ternities are officially planning to celebrate a quiet Ne.w Year's Eve.

Last night Schenectady's chief wnr dC'n, R. K. Hamlen, told 900 air raid warden::; that the blackout would last ten minutes and would be a surprise. Wardens would be phoned 40 minutes ahead of the blackout but Schent>ctady would not be informed when it would come. To signal the start of the black- out, the large fire horn atop the Central Fire Station, the large whistles at the General Electric and the American Loc-omotive Companies and all fire sirens and horns will be sounded for one min- ute. The all clear signal will be the same horns a.nd sirens sounded for 10 seconds, then there will be five seconds of silence and then a second blast of 10 seconds. The Building Wardens, listed in the next column, will take charge 'lf the buildings on the campus dur- ing an air-raid alarm or blackout. Mr. Hoadley pointed out that these- lection was limited to men living on the campus as those off cam- pus would not be able to reach their posts in time. F-ratE'rnity Presidents RE'sponsible The president of each fraternity hae been asked to be personally re- sponsible for enforcing complete blackout conditions at his chapter house during the practice blackout on Monday and for any subsequent blackouts. Each warden will inspect the building for which he is respon- sible as s.oon as pessible after the ala.rm has been given. He will have to be sure that every light is off. The warden will also direct the occupants of the buildings to the safer parts of it. A Warden's Headquarters will be established in the basement of Washburn :•1.1: and may be reach- ed by caJ:,, ,·: 4-7917. A complete sPt of mast~!' keys will be avail- able there. For the present, the College Civilian Defense Committee ·has limited blackout constructi-on to the boiler house, Warden's Post, Cacualty Station. If the frequency of blackouts makes it advisable, later steps will be taken to ex:tehd the scope of the hlaekout con- struction.

Certainly to the senio1·s, New Yem·'s Day, 1942, has always meant only that far-off be- ginning of that far-off year in which they would disassociate themselves from the col- lege and would do any number of those thing-s which a colleg·e g1·aduate is tradition- ally supposed to do-from pounding the sb·eets in search of a job to tmmp-steaming one'.s way around the world. Today we are faced with far graver prob- lems, are loaded with far mo1·e mature re- sponsibilities than New Year's Day, 19-12, symbolized, factors that call upon us to as- sume vital roles in the fiercest struggle the world has evet· .seen. No laager are we per- mitted the luxury of the indecision of plan that has long been the college man's prerog- ative; the decision as to what we are going to do has been made for us. We, more than any other single gToup in the Cnited States, are faced \vith the re- sponsibility of recognizing that decision and going: ahead with it. The dictators have claimed that democracies are decadent, and their people lazy and soft and \'.'ealc It is our responsibility to give that claim the lie in the factories, in the laboratories, in the classrooms and on the field. New Year's Day, 1942, faces us with the stark reality that we have been picked by fate fo1· a tough job. It is a job that we can and will do. THE SHAPE OF THINGS TO COME The wisdom of l'nion's action in \telescop- ing\ her college year has been many times ratified these past few days. The press has been carrying account after account of the decision of a number of colleges throug-hout the East to hold a :\lay Commencement. It is fortunate that \Ve have shown wis- dom and clarity of p1.upose in our initial ac- tion motivated by the world conflict. The immediate future can demand only greater and greater quantities of both wisdom and purpose; we shall have to make others of these rapid, sweeping changes. Mast Important Change FiJ·st and most important of the changes we must come to is increase of the academic year from nine months to twelve months. Such a \three year course\ has been made necessary from almost every practical aca- demic standpoint. In the first place, students will be enabled to graduate at an earlier age, thereby elim- inating much of the p1·esent conflict with Selective Service. Too, academic institutions may make use of their full equipment during the entire year, rather than allow that equip- ment to 1·emain idle for almost one third of that year. In these days of the \Nose to the Grind- stone\ and \Speed up\ the psycholog·ical effect of a twel\'e month college course would be bound to be a happy one for students. History showf'. us a multitude of instances in times of emergency wherein men have felt an essential inferiority because of the fact that they are unable to demon- strate that the demands on them are as st :>rn as those on other men. Not Easy Such a speedup would clearly not be aimed at making the burden ea.sie1· fo1· either stu- dent or faculty member. Such is not the pur- pose. \Ve must expect increases in difficulty of tasks in the world today. It is very possible that the American Col- lege, like so many American institutions be- fore it, has finally come to the end of the \lwrse a.nd buggy\ e1·a of its existence. We use that term because it describes most aptly the original motivation for the type of col- lege calendar we have today-a few short -_·acations and one long summer holiday. The reasons fm· esta.blishing- this long summer holiday and for the nine month col- lege year \Ve1·e those of transportation diffi- culties and of the need for students to heir work the farms dming the fine days of the summer. And as Congress, as but one, hm had to discard a calendar schedule that wm devised to meet the needs of an early, agri- cultural America, so, too, are the colleg·es of America being forced to make this same change. A Century Amidst the Uncertainty There is yet one thing of which we may be sure among all the unsure factors of the metamorphosis we shall have to see. We need never fear the ultimate results of changes made voluntarily in themselves by American institutions. We may be sure that even though we may be forced to change our philosophies of the chl'OilOlogical schedules of college educaton, the college education it- self will always remain essentially the same free backbone that a free America will al- ways need.

President 7 ox exp'a!ned the college's attitude ~oncerning the draft and other :1tltte1'S. He first expla·ined the new calen- dar and what it will accomplish. Then he w1·ote: \Though our sec- ond semeste'r begins now on Jan- uary 1 rather than on January 6, our tuition payment dates will re- main the same, February 4, 5 and 3 -this to disturb family calcul:o~­ tions as little as possible. In this cme1·gency we have ruled that those· students who are ca·lled in-to selective service between Januaty 12 and about March 13 will have theh· tuition remitted for those weeks that they have been in col- lege. Urges \Cart>ful Attention\ \Union College earnestly hopes that any and every one of its stu- dents will give very careful atten- tion to the national need, present and ultimate, and his own rela- tion to it beforE' volunteering. If we said to our students: 'Don't en- list!' we would be misunderstood by the public. We say to them in- stead: 'Get all the education you can before thf' nation cecides that it needs you.' The 1·esumption of an individual student's coHege edu- cation after war is ve1y problem- atical. It is likely to be a long war and it may be that its vet- erans, many of them, will feel themselves .too old and ccnfronted too closely with the responsibili- ties of maturity to go back to com- plete pre pam tion for special pub- lice usefu:ness and individual suc- ce~s. vVe ane ~tuC:ying the po!\sibil- ity of arranging our work so th'l.t students may gi3duate in less than four years. Nation to Decidt> \This morn·ing's newspapers an- nounce that the Government is swinging to the selective service plan exclusively a:> a basis for man-power, a very sensible read- ing of national welfat·e. We feel that our judgment is vindicated and repe::It our counsel to our stu- dents: 'Get all thE' education you can before the nation decides fuat it needs you.' On December 18 on question, the oftice of the Presi- dent of the United States advised this attitude for collegE' students. We are announcing no new provi- sions in credit or tuHion mrange- ments for t:1ose who voiuntarily leave college.\ MODERN DINER Cor.
