Dickinson Speaks On the Value of Engineering History Discusses Ways in Which History Aids the Engineer l'n His life and Work :MONDAY, Oct. 3.-Mr. Henry W. Di<:kinson, biographer of Robert Fulton and James Watt. tonight ad.dressed an audience in the Old Chapel on The Value of History in Eng-ineering Education. Mr. Dick- inson said history gave us lmowl- ed:ge with which to correlate the present with the past. He expressed th~ belief that the history of engi- neers and their achievements has been sadly neglected.

Concet ning its action, the council made the following statement: '·The Interfraternity Council is not op- posed to a dance Hamilton Week- end. The fratei nities would gladly endorse a dance Ft iday evening if a satisfactory arrangement could be wor-ked out. We are opposed how- ever, to the proposa 1 which would deprive us of our week-end in March and transfer that dunce to the Hamilton week-end under the control of the student council. The I nterfr ater nity ball 111 Ma1 ch is a college function. Last year many neutrals were present and the atgu- ment that sucn a dance would ex- clude any member of the college community is not true.\ Want House Dances At last evening's meeting, which was held in the Student Activities office, the council also carried a motion to the effect that member organizations are in favor of house dances the evening of the Hamilton game. The council was also opposed to any fraternity initiating a pledge who is on scholatship warning. The meeting was adjour11ed atter the following committee appointments wei e made: Scholarship committee, Ben Rathbun, ·chairman, Tom Burke and Howard Van Kuren.

The Cou~h That Has Nine Lives One enterprising fellow bought up furnishings for his room from seniors who •left last June. Though they parted sorrowfully with the old oaken chest, the end table, and the rug a11d couch set, they were hardly pa1·ticular about the price. Ferdinand acquiled a nice big divan, comfortable-looking but not sitting, we ran swear. This is in- stalled to<lay eleganlty and is more than an ordinary kind of sofa. It is an archive of relics: old letters, report cards, shoe strings, collar buttons and on down the list of things tl:Jat are hidden or hide themselves at the most inopportune times. Ferdy has had endless pleas- sure with his couch. So much so is he wrapped up !n its mysteries that he got himself lost in the depths of mohair, felt, and wire spt ings. If done correctly, the divan can be entered at one end, and after a reasonable lapse of time, left at the other end. Vl'ol'!onen on Toast ..

Of Steffens and Roosevelt To Be Topic of Discussion Personal -reminiscences of Lincoln. 3teffens and of Theodore Roosevelt will be the subject of an informal talk by Burges Johnson to the fresh- men on Monday afternoon, October 10th. at 1:30 p. m. This is the first use made by the English Depart- ment of an hour alloted by the Dean in the freshman program. There is no conflict with laboratory sched- ules at that time. According to the . Dean's schedule the fom·th Monday of the month is allotted to the field ad' English and the second Monday to Social Studies. This month an exchange of Mondays has been ar- ranged. Whether the various fields of study will make use of their Mon- day afternoon privilege will depend in the future upon special needs that ma-y arise and upon the oppor- tunity to provide programs of signi- ficance.

It was further decided that the Executive Committee of the Coun- cil meet with the Intel'fraternity Council in special sess10n to inquire whether or not the latter body would be interested in managing the new dance. If the ~ntertrate<­ nity Council r efuse·.s. to take over the dance it will automa;t,cal,y t:.t!l .o the Student Council to do so. \For the -first time in my life 1 realized my nationality.'' said Baker, adding that he became awar-e of the differences between his speech, table ·:manners, and customs and .those of the English. \Unconsciously he continued, \I began to accept or criticize their methods and .saw therefore my own country's failings and assets.\ Student CtJrLil-cil To Meet To1r1ight We pass this informatiOon on to Mr. T. Ralston, Union's .pres- ent representative in Scobland. The day will be .climaxed by the Skidmore-Union exchange dinner · and dance to be held In hale House and Hanna Hall; this will be the second in the series for which a delegation from Skidmore will jour- ney to Schenectady under the auspices of the Skidmore Student Government Assoeiat!OI\, the Union Terrace Council, Mrs. Henry T. Moore, wife of the president of Skidmore, and Mrs. Dixon Ryan -Fox. B •·d T f Heritage Plays Large Part rl ge . 0Ufnamen Baker found the English to be a To Be S -po:nso.red . slower living people than the aver- . age Amedcan and apt to be much B F t •t• . more conservative. He noted, also, : y ra ernl JeS that tradition and heritage play a larger part in English life than they Purpose Ex:plained The purpose of official \Fresh- man Day\ as explained by David Yunich, president of the Student Council, is \to endeavor to obtain unity and, at least, a semblance of organization in the class of '42.\ The Student Council is most anxi- ous to see the class of '42 \func- tioning as one body\ in an effort to foster class spirit, which, Yunich explained, is so essential to college life. Yunich also added that while the Council wants the Freshmen to have a good time at their official \Fr·eshman Day,\ no infringement of college rules will be tolerated; the Student Council and the Sopho- more Discipline Committee will be on hand to see th~t rules are obeyed. \Freshmen must ·remember that the eyes of Union will be upon • them and let it be said hereafter that this attention was merited,\ Yunich said. ----o--- Faculty to AHend Sports Events Free Britten, '40, Proposes Competition for NinE Houses and North College At a meeting of the athletic t::bairmen of the ten campus frater-. nity houses, nine of whom reported. their respective honses were ·in favor of a proposal to hold an inter- fraternity bridge tourname11t, this arrangement proposed by :Burdiek Britten, '40, was adopted. Under this plan the nine partici- pating houses and North .College, which was in vi ted to par-ticipate, will each be represented by two teams of two men each. These 'teams will meet teams fro.m other houses at times convenient .to both gro11ps. Drawings have already been made, and a tentative £chedule is being formulated. Each competing group is. to con- tribute to a general fund, the pro- ceeds of which will go tow<lrds the purchase of a cup for the winning and the second place tearxl in the toumament. The scoring will be based on total points accumulated in the prescribed length <Jf time; ~ncomplete rubbers will nr:;t be fin- ished. do in our life. \The best example of this tradi- tional or conservative attitude is in the English ideal of a University eciucation,\ he said, adding \The University has, in effect. changed little from the days of its begin- ning. Classics is still the most pop- ular degree.\ Directing his remarks to the freshmen engineers, he urged that they study one subject. whether it be art, history, music, or philosophy and try to correlate this subject with their work. \It's been nice to go away, but better to come home,'' said Baker in concluding his address. Outing Club Plans Trip to Cabin To rehabilitate the new cabin at North Creek, the Outing Club is sponsoring two trips to the cabin over this weekend. One group on this North Cree It trip will leave the campus Saturday at 1 p. m. A sec- ond group will' leave on Sunday at 7:30 a. m. In addition to the North Creek trip, the club is hold- ing a canoe trip on Lake George. Members of the club not attend- ing either of these activities will wor-k on the Rotterdam Ski Trails. Knew Both Men Dr. Johnson's choice of a topic is due to the .fact that freshmen gen- erally throughout their various sec- tions of English are reading the autobiography of Lincoln Steffens. and considering methods of other biographical writings, incluciing the many papel's by or about President Theodore Roosevelt. Dr. Johnson's contacts with both men were fre- quent, and it is possible for him to present an intimate picture not found in the written records. \Outside visitors are welcome,\ Dr. Johnson said in answer to an inquiry, \in case they arrive on time. One-thirty is the hour.\ Town Meeting Forum Postponed One Week The Schenectady Town Meeting, originally scheduled for Sunday, October 9, has been postponed to Sunday, October 16. This meeting was to have been the first in a se- ries, being sponsored by the Capi- tal District Forum Project of the United States Department of Edu- cation. Through an arrangement be- tween the Student Activities Com- mittee of the faculty and the ath- letic department, members of the faculty may attend all home ath- letic contests as guests of the Field of Physical Education, free of charge. If the bridge tournament is suc- cessful, the representatives plan to sponsor an interfraternity ping pong contest and a billiard tourna- ment. ----o----- Boys to Be Guests At Middlebury Game The Club is interested in hear- ing from any students interested in local Indian history. A former professor from Amherst College has written the Outing Club to stimu- late activity in this field. Alvin Van The Garnet Key and the Christian Valkenburg '36, now instructor in Association will join forces on Sat- Geology, and Payson Hatch '39, urday to act as hosts to members of are leading the movement. The series will present a num- ber of prominent speakers in lec- ture and discussion forums. The program will be public and will be broadcast for one-half hour over Station WGY. Members of the stu- dent body have especially been in- vited since it is assumed. that it will be of great interest to them. The forum will consist of two speeches, each upholding opposite sides of the same question. ~~allow­ ing the speeches, the entire ques- tion will be given over to discus- sion by members of the aadience. All married members of the fac- ulty will be entitled to two tickets to the respective contests, and all unmarried faculty members to one ticltet. These ticket& are not trans- ferable and must be procured at the gymnasium prior to noon of the day of the contest. A government tax will be col- lected ort all tickets. 0---- Organ Recitell To Feature Dupre the Schenectady Boys' Club, and. will accompany the local :youths to the Union-Middlebury freshman football game. It originally had been planned by the two groups to accompany the members of the Boys' Cl-ub to the Colby game, but the cancellation of lhat contest necessitated t'lle change tn plans.

Balance Dn.nc.e Program All Student Cou:ncil members must be l'•·esent, and all other students a.re ·invited, although non-Cowteil rnemoers a1•e asked to sit in tl!e ·balcony. The Student Council felt that by changing one of .the All-College Dances it would give the college dance program a better balance for the year and also diminish any possible competition with the Jun- ior Prom. Freshmen To Be Hosts To Skidmore Football Game, Dinner And Dance Included In Party Program Approximat~ly 70 Union first-year men will entertain an equal number of Skidmore freshmen tomorrow. when a group from Saratoga will be escorted to the Union-Middlebmy freshman football game by Union yearlings. The Skidrncue freshmen are ex- pected to arrive on the campus at 1:30 tomorrow\ afternoon, at which time they will meet at the Presi- dent's home with the Union fresh- men, and partners will be desig- nated for the afternoon. Following the football game, light refreshments 'VIill be served in Hale House. It is hoped tha.t there will be an all-fre.5hman band for the game, as all-~heers are to be led by freshmen.

The need for a concept of a per- sonalized God· was expressed by Dr. Dan Gilbe·xt at Thursciay morning's daily assernb ly program. Only a con- cept of a personal God can destroy \subversive athiestic and an-Amer- ican\ activity which is so rife in the world today, Dr. Gilbert said. He depl>Qr<ed the tendency of the modern sd\.:rla-r and theologian to conjure a \panthiestic sterilized, rationalistic•' idea of God and ex- pressed the ·belief that this was a force aiding- those canying on sub- versive aciivity in American gov- ernment. John Boyt '42 has been named ecene designer for the year. He has already made ground plans and water color sketches of the seven scenes to be used in \The Adding Machine.\ These will' be placed on exhibition in tl!e new show cases in the library. Worll has begun on the publication of a subscription book- let for the Mountebanks, and sev- eral of Boyt's sketches will appea.r in this brochu:re. The new stage man~.ger for t'te production is James Barfor d, '40, who is working with a crew of eight men. Fred Richards, '41. is the new master electrician, and will work with a crew o·f seven men.

Clinton, who was the judge of the contest, opened up for the winter sea- son in the International Casino in New York City on Saturday evening.

His talk opened a series by the faculty in the fleld of English. The subjects of his talk were in keep- ·ing with the present work of the freshmen. Roosevelt was a thoroughly dem- ocratic man, said Dr. Johnson. When he represented the United States at the funeral of King Ed- ward VII of England, he had many expet·iences with the kings and emporers of Europe that were never published, because Theodore Roosevelt enjoined those members of the Players Club in New York who heard him. Interfraternity Council to Give Dance Nov. II Clark Is Chairman Student Council Votes Group Privilege of Having Dance; Assume Full Responsibility Friday, Oct. 7.· The Student Coun- cil tonight voted the Interfratemity Council the right to give a dance on Friday evening, Nov. 11. The mo- tion ·as pa.ssed contained the follow- ing provisions: 1. The dance shall be known as the Interfraternity Ball. 2. The Interfratemity Council shall assume full responsibility for the management of the dance, and will be responsible for any possi- ble deficit incurred. 3. The profits from the dance, 1f any, shall be turned over to the Stu- dent Tax Committee to be admin- istered at its discretion. President Yunich submitted a te~ port from the executive committee of the council based on its joint meeting with the Interfraternity group which stated that the Inter- fraternity Council wanted to give the dance alone, or if that were not acceptable to the Student Council, to give the dance in conjunction with the Student Council. This latter pio- posal would place the management in the hands of a committee of four, two to be chosen from each body, Interfraternity Group Wants $75 In the discussion following this report Thomas Burke, '39, speaking for the interfratemity group moved that they be allowed to give the dance and receive $75.00 of the profits, all above that figure to go to the Student Council. President VanDyke of the Interfraternity Council was a.iso present and spok~ briefly in favor of that body man- aging the dance, declaring that they were definitely in a position to man- age a dance this fall. Philip Duchscherer, spealting for the Tax Committee, questioned the necessity for the Interfraternity Council having $75.00, in view of the fact that they had no definite pro- gram or object which would call for the expenditure o-f such a sum, and Lon Barringer amended the motion to read ·that all profits, if any, be turned over to the Tax Committee. President Yunich brought up the question of financial liability and Burke further amended his motion to state that the Interfraternity Council would assume any deficit in- curred. The motion, with these two amendments was passed by a large majority. Clark Appointed Chairman Van Dyke, speaking for the Inter- fraternity Council announced that Robert Clark, '39, had been ap- pointed chairman of the dane~. Clark is a member of Kappa Sigma. Yunich offered the assistance of himBelf and Louis Carr, Secretary of the Student Council, to Clark in that they had already contacted .sev- eral orchestras with the assumption that the Student Council would have a dance this fall. The question of a system of op- tional examinations was brought up by Stanley Luke, '39, who moved that the Council go on record as favoring such a system. Because of lack of definite information on th.is motion Yunich tabled it, and ap- pointed Luke chairman of a com- mittee to investigate the matter more thoroughly, with power to ehoose the other members of his committee. An informal show of hands revealed the council in favor of the suggested optional exams.

Fahy Copy Desk Editors .Jamt>~ T\Villing Ja('.k Phillip:-: Tuesday, October 11, 1938 HELP WANTED! Each fall thousands of students enter col- leges throughout the l:nited States with in- sufficient funds to complete their selected course of study. Faced with the necessity of working in their spare time in order to de- fray part of their collegiate expenses, these men invariably look for financial assistance from one of l\h'. Roosevelt's alphabetical organizations, the N.Y. A. A few years ago before the N. Y. A. ap- propriation was cut, the majority of these needy students could be given work. Re- cently, however, with a reduced budget to work with and an ever increasing number of applicants, college student emplo;yment bureaus have been fOi·ced to reduce the num- ber of maximum hours a N. Y. A. worker may labor. This situation necessarily calls for a corresponding decrease in each work- er's income, with the result that many are forced to leave college. Yet, we feel that many students \give up the ship\ without first investigating other possibilities of earning- spare money, espe- cially those offered to Union students. It is common knowledge that many activities of- fer financial reimbursements to students who are elected to positions in their senior year. However, for some unexplainable rea- son, unless the average L\ nion student is un- willing to gamble on an almost sure thing, there are only a few candidates each year for these remunerative positions. As an example of this tendency we can cite The Concordiensis, which is the most familiar activity to us. At least once, and often two or three times a year, a call is issued for candidates to the editorial and business boards of the paper. If we are for- tunate, fifteen to twenty men will app1y for candidacy to the editorial· board and five to ten for the business staff. Usually, two years later, there are seldom more than enough candidates left to fill our seven posi- tions on the senior board. Often, the remain- ing candidates are not those who showed the most promise at the start, but those who had the greatest amount of perseverence. We feel certain that approximately the same condition exists with The Idol and The Gar- net staffs. There is so little competition for positions on the Union Col.lege publications that anyone who is willing to work fo1' the prescribed period of candidacy is virtually assured of a position in his senior year-and yet with this situation, ,Union students still moan over the fact that they cannot devise The Classical Club, an organization made up of students and instructors, holds its meetings on alternate Tuesdays.

Page Four Polish Professor Will Lecture On Campus Dr. Halecki to Recount Stand of Poland In Present Crisis Professor Oscar Haleclti, eminent Polish scholar and lecturer, in the United States as exchange profes- sor under the auspices of the Kosciuszlw Foundation, will speak on \Poland and Lithuania\ Mon- day night, October 17, in the Old Chapel. Professor Halecki is the third in a series of public lecturers spon- sored by the college. Since he ar- rived in the United States during the \international crisis\ in Cen- ti'al Europe, it is expected that Dr. Halecki will shed much light on the Polish situation which is now one of the crucial in the European alignments taking place. But Professor Halecki's purpose is purely intellectual and cultural. He wants to visit a number of typi- cal American institutions of high- er learning with a view of becom- ing more intimately acquainted with the work they are doing in an atmosphere of American de- mocracy and academic freedom. His lecture at Union College, to- gether with those he will deliver at other colleges before he sails back to Poland in December, will be published. The Kosciuszko Foundation was established to create memorial scholarships and for the promo- tion of intellectual and cultural re- lations between Poland and the United States. Dr. Henry Noble MacCracken, president of Vassar College, is president of the foun- dation. ----0---- Fox Dedicates Theatre President Dixon Ryan Fox was recently the dedicatory speaker at the presentation of an outdoor ! theatre at Hood College. : _...,,••:•'•''·'':'>~;'·'N•.•.:;:;~'•'•.•,,_, THE CON\ CORDIENSIS, TUESDAY, OCTOBER 11, 1938 Outing Club on Canoe Trip; Repair Newly Acquired North c~eek Cabin Five Union men accompanied~•>---------------­ nine Vassar girls over the week- end on a canoe trip up .Lal!le George sponsor:ed by the Outing Club, while another group journeyed to North Creek to work on the newly acquired Outing Club cabin there.

Thomas in Lineup Suffering from a serious malady of last-period defeats in their games with Trinity and Swarth- more, the varsity gridders will lineup with a team at near full strength for the first time this sea- son. Offsetting this considerably is the fact that Vermont is far \tronger than eitner of Union's two previous opponents. Most heartening of any of the news emanting from the varsity camp concerns the appearance of \Rabbit\ Billy Thomas, sparkplug back on last year's eleven, in tomor- row's opening team.

FROM ONE YOUTH TO ANOTHER :\Ionday moming two Chinese delegates to th.e World Youth Congress, which was held at Vassal' College in Poug-hkeepsie this surnmn, will arrive in Schenectady. They will be received by a co1nmittee representing both adult and youth organizations in the com1nu nity. Cnion College, quite fittingly, has played a large part in planning the ex- tensive round of activities by which Sche- nectady will tender its feelings of interna- tional fellowship-particularly for the ~'oung peoplE in China who are gl'owing up amid the devastating ravages of war. L'n ion Colle_g·e is proud that its president and Fir·st Ladr, Dr. and Mrs. Dixon Rran Fox, have graciously sponsored the two main events of the delegates' visit-the reception and t€a at Silliman Hall Monday afternoon, and the public meeting Tuesday evening at Old Chapel.

In fact, music lovers arrange their own concerts and reprodu~ce sym- phonies on their own victrolas. The cost, ·however, of the victrola rec- ords is dear and I would like to suggest, :along with the other stu- dent with whom I have spoken, that the library add to its collec- tion of ·boolts a selected number of symphonic records and loan them out but for a period shorter than that allowed for booKs. I believe that the library would be willing to answer this request, especially if more students would voice an interest by petitioning the library. Yours truly, R.M. ·rise. If ''Muskrat\ ever becomes president, and he might, it will be due to his steadiness. Here is a man to hold against the world! But, on second thought, it would not be fair to hold a grudge against the whole universe just because of Jack. To see him bounding around the campus walks on the balls of his feet, one would not take him to be a genius. No crowds of adulating freshmen follow him around for Jack is the epitomy of modesty.

BACK TO THE COONSKIN ERA Our varsity football team has lost its first tiVo games, but n()t because it has not b€en well-coached or th~t it doesn't possess winni11g ma.te1·ial on its roster; but prin- cipally because \Old .:\la11 Jnjmr\ the tradi- tional headache of all fot>tball coaches, has dogged its tracks before and since the Gar- net's 1938 footbai! season was inaugurated.

Th.e team will be play- ing in its home environment for the first time this year which sllould be a definite pRychological advantage, Furthermore, when the squad trots out onto Alexander Field, the team will be the nearest to full strength that it has been all season. Several \key men\ in the Gamet atta.ck and defense will be in the starting line-up for the first time, and as the Catamounts are undoubtedly tak- ing our chances for a win very ·lightly, these men may very easily spell the difference be- tween victory and defeat. .;\liss Liu and Dr. Yin have come thousands of miles to extend the friendly hand of China•s youth. Every student of Union will surely want to be present Tuesday evening at Old Chapel to answer: \Fr<lm -one :youth to another, we pledge the friendship of America's young people- for a lasting good will and for a peaceful world.''

H. Column In Two Years Features Self-Interview by Ferd The Concordiensis has asked me to give its throng of eager readers some account of myself. I was born in Schenectady and edu.cated in its public schools. I underwen:t farther and, I think, more .effective ex- posure to learning at Union, where I received an A.B. degree in 1937. Ce1·tain acHvities not strictly of the classroom did, indeed, attract. my attention. I worked with the Mountebanks as a female imper- sonator until the introduction of the genuine article into the casts 1 educed me to performing less bizane functions. My e:xperience with the Mountebanks had, aside from the fun of it and the oppor- tunity to learn threatrical tech- nique, this very definite value. I decided that nature had not in- tended me to be an actor. A sum- mer in 1935 with the Mohawk Drama Festival confirmed this de- cision; during the summer of 1936 [ was librarian to the F'estival. I wrote a column for The Con- cordiensis of which at thill late date, I suppose, the less said, the be: ter. I eerved on the editorial board of the Idol. Literary Ooutributions This hasty summary of my un- dergraduate activities may not help those who do not kno1v me and will probably mystify those who do. People who may remember me as a Motmtebank may wonder that I do not tell stories about instruc1ive rehearsals and exciting perform- ances. Some who recall me as a co- ~haizman of the Idol Board :may be su!;prised that I do not expatiate upon the state of that magazine during the palmy days of 1937. . Others who have not forgotten my column may not understand why I do not smooth the earth above . the buried hatchet. But readers with such memories are probably few, and, in any case. pleasant though my undergrad11ate years were; (Continued on Pag-e 4) .After mo1 e c11eerlng, the crowd proceded to the Council Field, and a huge bonfire was lighted in the Mohawk Drama Festival audience pit.

Thank you. cal disseration upon the position Organizations Donate and policies of Poland in relation to Lithuania. Stressing the neces- sity for the historical perspective in the auditor, Halecki constructed an appealing backdrop of history against which the conflicting inter- ests of Poland and Lithuania have ilabhfd since the growth of the democratic spirit in Lithuania im- mediately prior to the World War. The Poles have their racial ori- gin in the early Slavonic tribes, whereas the Lithuanian people, in common with only one other na- tional group, the Latvian, stems from the so-called Baltic race. How, historically, the two separate na- tionalities at first carne to coop- erate, is explained by their mutual necessity for defence against a common enemy, the German order of Teutonic Knights during the early fifteenth century. In addi- tion to the obvious necessity for protection, Professor Halecki as- serts that the 1·eligious motivation for fusion of these two national groups, although not obvious, was of vital import. The Rmhenian sec- tion of the Lithuanian ~tate was of pagan origin, thus giving the Teu- tonic Knights the obvious reason for invasion and christianization of pagan Lithuania. Both Lithuania and Poland were saved from im- pending obsorption by Germany by a royal union between the two rul- ing houses in the year 1410. From that time until the rise of the dem- ocratic ideal A.nd th~ •·ecurrent .surge of ethnic nationalism in the RuthE'nian sections of the Lithuan- i:,.n state, Halecki pictured an idyllic cvoperation between the two states . .A cooperation which, how- ever, gave to Poland the virtual control of the cooperative policy. .At the conclusion of the World War, this \mutual assjstance which had resulted in so many successes\ was shattered in the conflict be- . tween ethnological and historic in~ terest over the city of Vilna.

Our system of education, according to Dr. Eller~·, is dil·ectl~· opposite to the modem methods used hy business, industQ:, and govemment. Toda~·. mass production char- acterizes industry, regimentation and collec- tivism government and business; while om· educational trends are away ft·om regimen- tation and toward the stress of individuality. By making the individual underg-raduate, and not the class, the real unit of observa- tion and sttldy means an incre<~se of inquir- ing minds and likewise a more effective re- sistance to mere propag-anda. This is all very interesting and hig-h- sounding, but just how does Union empha- size the individttal? As soon as a student enters Union he is given a total of twelve tests. These tests related to the scientific, niathematical. language, and arts abilities of the student are part of his college record and are available to members of the faculty when forming a judgment regal'ding his ca- pacities and character. A comparatively new innovation at Union are the vocational guid- ance tests, which usually reveal whether he is qualified to enter his selected p1·ofession, and if not, \Vhat vocation he appears to be best fitted for. The student is allowed to choose his course of stud~· from four ma,i OJ' divisions, litel·a:ture, social studies, science, and eng-i- neering. Each of these divisions has a wide and almost unex:haustible list of subjects open to its unde-rgraduate members. Each student is also offered several extra-curri- cular intellectual and cultural opportunities to broaden his social and cultural outlooks th roug·h associations with honorary fellows, public lecturers, and distinguished Sunday chapel speakers. These are only a few of the stresses our educational peers place on developing our in- dividual personalities. D1·. Ellery's statement is thus no idle boast, and we can feel certain that we are a part of an up-and~coming edu- cational system. Congratulations are in order. h f Have you ever noticed the deplcn- stihttions.

THE BABY GROWS UP S IXTEEN years ago G-E radio engineers crossed their fingers and snapped a switch in one of the laboratories at Schenectady~and a split second later heard through clumsy earphones, \This is WGY, radio broadcasting station of the General Electric Company, Schenectady, New York.\ That was the \birth announcement\ for this G-E sta- tion, whose rise from swaddling clothes to the 1 usty strength of sixteen years has paralleled the rise of radio broadcasting from experiment to smooth efficiency. From the start, WGY was an unusual child. When only three days old, it started pioneering by presenting the first remote-control broadcast. And the pioneering is still going strong. As the station grew, it provided the groundwork for network broadcasting, mobile trons- mission, coast-to-coast television broadcasts. This year, WGY celebrates its sixteenth birthday with a new 625-foot nondirectional antenna (70 feet higher than Washington Monument) and n modernistic new studio building with everything from a model kitchen to a large audience studio.

In each case, we learned, five bearded men staggered into the stores in apparent disguise and demanded· the above merchandise. We have a faint suspicion as to the identity of the five, but what else could be expected with three startling upsets and two unexpected tie affairs glaring our illustrious prognosticators square in the face. The \lucky\ stooge after Saturday's experiences was our Ed. Chief Fred Hequernbourg who \called\ the· Syracuse-Cornell outcome. How- ever, \Ott\ Lawrence managed to hold on to first place with a total of 17 out of 24 for a .708 mark, calling three out of six over the weekend, as did \'Nels\ Nitchman, in second slot with 16 out of 24 and a .667 percentage. Hequembourg taltes over third position with 15 out of 24 for a .625 average, also selecting three. The two-out-of-six forecasters were Sports Ed.

Mallard pointed out that propor- tional representation is a principle toward which the citizens of New Yorlr State have wcrked for many yeat·s, and that it was not until 1S42 that a ·bill was passed com- pelling elections from districts. He quote-d a piece in Dr. Charles Stein- metz' own handwriting, in which this great man had said that pro- portional r epresentution is the engineer's answer to one of the moet vital political p10blems of the age. Mancuso, on the other hand. held that \P. R.'' is absolutely un-Amer- iean in that it tf'nds to abolish majority rule, a fundamentally Amedcan tradition, as set forth in the constitution.

Speaks Here Tuesday MAYOR LA GUARDIA Mayor La Guardia, Dr. Fox said in making the announcement, was secured .for the meeting through Senator Robert Moses of New York City who assisted the college in ar- ranging the meeting so that stu- dent may better understand the current movements in state gov- ernment.

Carroll Announces •Adding Machine• Cast and Dates The Reform Mayor from New York City has been much in the limelight since taldng office in 1934 where his spectacular tactics in set- tling labor strikes and managing the New York CLy :Board of Al- dermen have brought him almost as much publicity as former Mayor James J. Walker received in his heyday. At the time of his re-elec- tion as Mayor in 1937 he broke two records in being the first reform mayor elected to succeed himself, and in receiving tbe largest vote ever cast in a mayorality election in New York City. LaGuardia's Record The La Guardia vote was rolled up by a Republican- Fusion- Pro- prossive- American Labor party <:oalition w1th the vote cast by the American Labor Party, 482,459, be- ing twice as large as the par~Y polled for president Roosevelt m the 1936 election. His victory was a double blow to Tammany Hall in that he carried with him his run- ning mates. to gain control over the Board of Estimate. Mayor La Guardia's 55 years of life have been crowded with ac- tion, most of it JJOlitical in the service of the Federal and State governments.

Yunich, presi- dent of the Student Council, in- dicated today. Elections from the list of nominees will be held Wed- nesday. The positions for which candidates will be nominated are: President, vice-president, secretary and treasurer. Yunich pointed out that the pres- ent freshman class appears to have splendid class spirit and added that the nominations and elections will be held in such a way to prevent \deals\ so as to preserve the class unity. \We hope,\ said Yunich, \to get the ·best men, rather than men temporarily riding a wave of ath- letic popularity.\ Open Nominations Nominations will be open, and any freshman will be able to make a nomination from the fioor. The election itself, however, will be ar- ranged so that the freshman wit!:'!. the greatest number of votes will be declared president, the one with the second largest number vic~· president, the third highest man will be secretary, and the fourth treasurer. This arrangement, it is hoped, will eliminate politics from the elections. Leaders Named Among the leaders of the con- ference is Eduard C. Lindeman, na- tionally known sociolog i:;t.. Georgia Harkness, author, atld J.Jrofessor of H.eligion at M0UDt Hol,-oke College, is also one of leaders, as is Sher- wood Eddy, well known traveler, author, and speaker. Henry S. Leiper, sec1·etary of th.e Umversal Chustian Council, is al&o to be pre<~­ ent. These leaders will direct dis- cussion groups on the four main themes of the confe:ren.ce. The delegat~s will register in Sil- liman Hall, conference headquar- ters, upon arrival, and will dine in Hale House, after which they will adjourn to Oid Chapel to listen to an. address by Dr. Lindetnan on the subject \Ouistanding Frob I ems Confronting America 'J.'oday.\ Discussion Groups t[) Meet Saturday after breakfast the dele·· gates will conduct a seJ::vice of wor- ship, and then will hear a talk by D~:.

After luncheon the delegates will con- tinue their group meetings, and will then participate in a program of recreation and sports. Follow- ing dinner in :Hale House Dr. Eddy will deliver a fo:rm.al address which will be followed by square dancing in Hanna Hall. On Sunday the conference will meet at 9:30 in a summary session, and will later attend the Sunday Services in Memorial Chapel in a body. Dinner in Hale Bouse at 1:00 will conclude the conference.

Last Saturday the Union cubs beat the Cherry an.d White Yearlings 13·0- margin in the varsity gridiron se- ries, the Dutchmen llaving won 28 of' the 30 contests while the En- gineers have won but four. Four of the games, including last year's 6-6 game, have resurted in ties. The last time the 'Tutemen won a Union game was in 1933 when the Garnet was drubbed 16-0. several of our men will be unable to play. RPI has a psychological advantage in that they are rated as the underdogs. They have a far heavier l-ine than we, and will un- doubtedly throw many passes at our reputedly wealt pass defense On the other hand, we have worked out plays designed to gain against the flaws of the RPI team, based on its showing in previous games.

This game will be Union's undefeated cross-coun- try team will meet the biggest hut•dle in its campaign for an un- defeated season when, minus the services of Paul Santoro, it runs a formidable squad of Trojan hill and dalers over the Tray course. The R.P.I. team will be out to avenge last year's upset defeat at the hands of Coach Bill E:etz' men. The freshman runners of both schools will be out for their first win of the season when the fresh- man meet is called, both squads having lost their first meets. Union holds a very comfortable Although the Dutchmen enter the fray as favorites, there is no pre- mature counting of poultry in the Union camp; all realize that the defeating of Union is the chief aim of RPI's football campaign, and that this is one game in which ad- vance showings mean little or nothing. Coach Nels Nitchman reflected the tenor of Union opinion when he said, \It will be a tough game; Union followers are taking with a grain of salt the rumors that Shako, Shingle, and other RPI stars will not be in condition to play because of injuries, as it is known that these men were with· held from the game with Brook- lyn College on last Saturday. The fall issue of the 1938 Idol will definitely appear on November 20, Lon H. Barringer, editor of the literary magazine said recently. No radical changes in the policy of the magazine are contemplated, according to the Editor. It has been decided to retain tbe page of pic- tures of life at Union. The cover will be much the same as it was last year; a campus scene in one comer will form the main part of the cover. Barringer stated that the Idol will take a more definite editorial stand on campus acti-vities and ·on other phases of college life.

Union is proud that it \Vas chosen as the host for the delegates this year, and hopes that the conference is a success in every pos- sible wa~;. The leade1·s of the Student Christian l\Iovement are to be commended fo1· obtain- ing such outstanding men as Eduard Linde- man and Sherwood Eddy as the conference leaders, thus receiving practical knowledge for themselves and giving L'nion students and residents of Schenectady an opportunity to hear these famous individuals. Leslie Paffrath, Dean Garis, l'nion fra- ternities, and the \Cnion College Christian Assodation as a whole are cooperating to make the deleg-ates' stny het·e a ~uccessful and pleasant one. The college not only welcomes the repre- sentatives to its campus, but hopes that they learn more about Union and its students, so that they will look fol'V>·ard to the time when the conference is held here again. MEN FROM MISSOURI The uproar raised by some of Schenec- tady's conservative groups when it is an- nounced that some politically unpopula.e na- tional figure as Fritz Kuhn and Gmnville Hicks has been invited to speak before the undergraduates of Union is amazing to those who know us best. The townspeople, solely interested in om· welfare. pour myl\iads of teleg-rams, letters, and phone calls upon our administration officials admonishing them for allowing such dangerous people to speak before a g-roup of impressionable students. However sincere their interest in us may be, it is unnecessary, as the percentage of Union men who attend these lectures is al- most negligible. Each year the college goes to considerable expense to bring us a well-rounded program of lecturers. Among this number in the past have been many well-known national and in- ternational figures, people who understand and can tell us just what is happening out- these duys of reaction against the colorful. war, treaty making, coining of em of our forefathet•s, when a colle!:re man' rr.oney, etc. generally associated - with an independent territory? was an extraordinar~; social animal, 'vho What a splendid experiment in self · f 1 · h d government.

WEEK'S BEST EDITORIAL \VI)rds and Words A bouquet to President Dix{ln Ryan Fox of l'nion College at Schenectady, New York, who had the daring when the world was pre- occupied with pel\ilous tenitorial wrangles to devote a welcoming talk to the defense of the English lang-uage.

Nominations were received from the floor by Dav-id L. Yunich '39, president of the Student Council. Those nominated are as follows: Jay Van Aevnam, Benjamin Le- land, Robert Baker, Wiliiam Paul, Howard Lawrence, Morris Fr·ied· man, Bradford Grant, William Harkness, William Coates, Emlen Hutchins, Charles Clowe, Thomas Parsons, Waldo Strahan, Harry Stevens, Lee Sherman, Earl Ram- pel, James Billick, Robert Davis, Richard Twing, John Ehrcke, and Robert Murphy. Try To Close Pons Several times during the nomi- nations attempts were made to close the polls, but Yunich ex- plailied that in a meeting where nominations are received from tbe floor, all desired nominations must be accepted. After several nominations had been made, Robert Reynolds ro.se and suggested that in so much as there were so many small groups represented, it would be better to postpone the nominations until t:he Freshman Record appeared for distribution so that the freshmen could get to know each other from the pictures and personal data in the book.

Mr. Eddy ex- plained in this first discussion that he w-as optimistic rather than pes- :;imistic cot•cerning the outcome of the pl'esent crisis because he feels we are gradually working towal'd :he kingd()m of God. However, Mr. Eddy feels that the recent settle- . ment has only postponed another World ·war which is quite inevit- able. Friday evening Dr. Eduard C. Lindeman made the first official address to the delegates when he spoke in Old Chapel. Dr. Lindeman, professot· at the New York School of Social Work, said that the under- standing of the nation's problems is =ore pertinent to American youth than the international crisis. The United States will be in grave danger in ten or twenty years un- less the youth of the country can ·solve their own problems.

F:irst Spencer Lecturer Says fhat Average Man Is a P!>et and Sometime In Ufe Writes a Poem Louis Untermeyer, noted poet, antho!qgist and critic, discussed the poet and the average man, last night, tllce first in the series of the Icabod Spencer lectures sponsored by Union C'ollege at the Old Chapel. Mr. Unterweyer said that the average man is a poet, he can't es- cape if. \The average man lives by using poetry,\ continued Mr. Unterllleyer. \Everybody has writ- ten a poem sometime or 'another in his 'lifetime. Man uses poetry dur- ing tim\Ss of emotional stress, if he can:t write it, he turns to some- one else's :poetry.\ Imaginative leaps, daring use of phrases, .the ability to make com- parisons, this makes poetry, not metet:' .~r rhyme, stated the noted poet. \'rhe average man uses the essence of poetry every day of his life, he Ulles metaphors and similes,\ he contended. llescrlbes Average Man Mr. 'Untermeyer illustrated his ideas •t.y taking a routine day in the life ()f an average man, Mr. Babbitt. Mr. Babbitt is one who despises poetry, but yet is deeply poeti:c~J. in expressing his feeling througboLJ.t his orderly day. Mr. Unte:r10eyer said that when Mr. Babblt has slept well, he will not exmnine his night's sleep realisti- cally, but will say, \I slept like a Jog,\ 'tl-l1d if he feels exceptionally well, 'll.e will say \I feel fresh as a daisy,:• or \fit as a fiddle.\ These expressions are extremely poetical, they ·a:re metaphors, and when Mr. Bab bit drives to his office in his ·cat and he happens to be going at a. ·fast rate he will say \this car eats U.l/ the miles,\ and according to Mr. Untermeyer, only Emily Dickhson, one of the great Amer- ican poets of the last generation, could• state something as poetical as tha..t phrase, it has power. These phrases, continued Mr. Untermeyer, used by Mr. Babbit are all \poetic p lat:itudes.\ Defi.nies Poetry \Fo.etry is observation plus imag- ina;.ti()>n,\ stated Untermeyer. \Poe- tty 'iras the exactness of a report. Tile real poets are using the lan- guage of the average man, they say what we all have within us.\ Mr_ Untermeyer stated that when he w:as a youth, \the poets of the La.tlil. European countries, were re- spected and revered, in England they were merely tolerated, but in Aoocriea, they were neither respect- er nor tolerated, they are scorned.\ Student Council Con~idering Union Membership to Hitcfl.,hiking Club By JOHN P.

SIDELINE SPORTSMAI\ISHIP Until a week ago, the Radio Club had not approached Professo·r Wittner on the matter of installing such a public address system ; in fact, the speaker was not ordered until a short time ago, and probably will not arrive until ::;ho1tly uefon~ the Hamilton game-if. then. The Radio Club, in our opinion, has been guilt~· of gross negligence in this entire mat- ter. It was given the funds with which to buy this speaker with the explicit under- standing that the speaker would be used a.s . a part of a public address system for foot-. ball games this fall. Because of its failure to execute its part of the bargain, Union is forced to go without this much needed serv- ice at its football games. ers-Memorial Chapel-10:00 a.m. Rehear:;al, Schubert Club- Old Chapel-7:30 p. m.

Billick's score came after a 55-yard onslaught, fin- ished off with a .forward-lateral toss from Hillick to Bundy Shaw to Captain Bob Baker, who downed the ball on the R. P. I. nine-yard stripe.

FRED PATRIE, '40, HB Fred Patrie, Union varsity half- ·back, has been listed among the high-sc:oring players in the Eastern football scoring · .parade after the past weekend games. Patrie leads all players from other eastern col- lege football teams on Union's gridiron schedule. His total of 24 points to date were all garnered as a result of touch- downs, including one each in the Trinity and Swarthmore contests and the two tallies made in Satur- day's game with R. P. I. This ranks him on a par with almost half of the other high-scoring Eastern col- legiate players. The remaining touchdowns dur- ing the past four games were reg- istered by Larry Brockmyer and Sam Hammerstrom. Brockmyer carried the ban over in games with Trinity, Swarthmore, and R. P. I.; and Sam scored against Vermont and R. P. I. Points aiter touch- down were all scored by Ha.mmer- str•om, except in the Vermont game in which Sam passed to Vannier for the extra point. ---0--- Swimmers Drill Daily Under Coach Wheatly Under the ambitious program of Coach Joe Wbeatley, a large squad of potential varsity and freshman candidates are practicing daily in Foote memorial pool. At the present time the team has indulged in easy workouts. The sprint men have been slow but Coach Wheatley expects vast and constant improvements from the veterans. .Although practice has been going on for the past two weelts, the coach believes there is · going to be definite impl'ovement over last year's squad. Prospects for a freshman team are very favor·able, Coach Wheatley points out. Several yearlings with good potentialities have been un- covered during their first week of practice. S.

In losing out by three points, 29 to 26, Union also saw a two-year record of eight consecutive vic- tories broken by R. P. I. It was \revenge with music\ for the home forces in Troy, what with the Gar- net smashing a string of R. P, I. victories with last year's conquest. The absence of Paul Santoro was deeply felt, as Head of R. P. I. finished 40 yards in the van of Frank Melewicz in 26:05. The first eight positions alternated between the two teams, as Joe Annese came home fourth, Howie Sheffer check- ed in sixth, and Bill Johnson ter- minated the grind in eighth place. The time represented the faste.>t clocking of any of the five Union meets.

Led in by three Garnet trotters, the freshman cross-country men scored a 21 to 34 win over the R. P. I. cubs Saturday for their first victory of the season in two meets. Dick Conly, Don Fields, and Jack Pearson placed first, second, and third, respectively, for Union over the three-mile Trojan course, with the winner's time at 16:08. Donald Brockwehl wound up in ·sixth position, after Union re- linquished the two preceding slots to R. P. I.

Ripley of the General Electric Company, spoke in chapel Saturday on the advantages, both economic and fTom the standpoint of labor involved, of the use of electrical appliances in the home. The featurE' of Mr. Ripley's talk wa~ a one minute speech in which he compared the energy in a kilo- watt hour to the amount of work which a man would have to do to squal that energ-y. He then went on to explain the increased usc of electricity in domg the work in the home and to predict that this Jield of e<pct rkal application would be expanded many times over in the future. In Mr. Ripley's opinion this will become one of the most important Jields in the electrical engineering inJntitt·y. ished ·by a Union student, C. War- len Gammons '39. The ra,ilroad is a model t•oad and was built in his ; spare time ·in the cellar af the Delta· upsilon House. Gammons did the II'Ork under contract to the Mont-· gomery ward Company in Me- nands, who ate p\lanning to use it for the di~play of toy trains dur- · ing the Christmas season. The complete road consists of about 150 feet of three rail track, with five sidings capable of hold- mg one tram apiece. It 1s also pos- Slb<e to I•Un two trains on each of the main tl aci;;s, maiung the total acccmmodations for the road nine trains. The whole outfit is con\! oiled 'from a central switchboard on the .neit!e or the track, eight double .ever switches con~rollmg the s\\itch machines. The center of the platform b; cut away to make room tm tnc> operator. Three block con- tra! sw.tcnes atlow the operator to cut otr Cti'rtain siding,;. ·1 wo trans- formers are set at constant power, rheostats giving separate control for the main lines. A rheoscat has also been installed on the outside of the tracks. malting it possible for customers to operate the trains. Gammons, who bUilt a similar road fot· the Alling Rubber Com- pany in Schenectady and one for a firm in Utica, started on his proj- ect at his home in Schenectady in the latter part of August and moved it to the campus shortly after school opened, when he was assisted by David G. Hayner '40. His first step was to bund the ta- ble or platform for the tracks twenty feet long by seven feet wide in six sections. The foundation for the road bed followed, consisting of pieces of one by three inch wood laid in long strips. For the curves he cut these strips into short pieces and nailed them onto pieces of one quarter inch wood on the outside of the curve to give the effect of banking. Gammons covered these t.!, 1~ r·. 1 7. .

On top of this bed went 3,300 fibre ties to serve as the base for the rails. These were made up of 500 feet of steel rail in four foot strips. For the curves Gammons made use of a special rail bender to bend the rails to any desired radius. The switches of the rails had to be filed by hand. These switches are controlled by switch machines, two solinoid mag- nets which pull the bar back and forth to open and close the switches. There is a cam in the bar, making the switches self-locking. A train approaching a switch set against it is automatically stopped. One hundred and fifty feet of panel wire was necessary to com- plete the electrification of the third rail. Each of the six panels have terminals at each end, about a hundred in all, to hook up the ·brea]{s caused by the division into sections.

Newbold Morris, president of the City Council of New York, spoke in the Old Chapel Wednes- day night on Proportional Repre- sentation. Morris's speech was· of particular importance because of the controversy which is taking place in Schenectady over just that method of election. \The only answer to the demand for a better administration is a greater freedom and less state in- terference,\ said Mr. Morris. He spoke at considerable length of New York City's acq_uaintance with \P.R.\ and said that although the history of the city council was not a quiet one, the disorder was not due to proportional representation but rather to the fact that the Tam- many political machine did not work smoothly.

Sober college 3tudents at St. Bonaventure are or- ganizing to quell it. Now Alfred Dennis, president of the Bach So- cie:y, has appealed to the Fedet;?-1 Communications C()mmission to te- voke the licenses of stations broad- casting swing versions of the class- ics. He remarked· that the society endured the swinging of the Scotch Ballads in silence but when swing penetr·ated Bee!hoven, Chopin apd Mozart 1:umbles began to be heard. Then last week the members hea.rd a swing band going to town on Bach's \Toccata in D Minor.\ Tbe majestic high and low chords of the fugue were being amply em- broidered w ltll the hdt licks on a trumpet. That was too much for Mr. Dennis. As an economy measure bull fighters in Madl'id will be paid with meat. ft•om the bulls they kill.· The toreador also has to dispense with his flambo~all:t costume and don overalls. After months of unconfirmed ru- mors that Marshall Vassily K. Bleucher, commander-in-chief of the Red' arrny in the Far East was in trouble wlth the Stalin govern- ment, 1\<[oscow has definitely an- nounced that he has been re- placed by Gener·at G. M. Cern. It is that insubordination in fhe ranks ·of the army which may partia:lly explain Japan's disregard of Rus- sia in· her march to the south· .of Chin.a. E. C.
