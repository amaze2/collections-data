But be- ing published in the Albany Argus as ·well as the Schenectady paper, they reached many who would readily credit them, and so were liable to · work the College an immeasurable amount of harn1. Stirred up there- fore in defense of their own honor and the reputation of their Alrua Mater, the four classes held a joint meeting, and appointed a committee to call upon the n1inister and request him to publish a retraction of the objectionable statements. The suc- cess (?) with which they n1et is evi- denced by the follo\ving card which that gentleman read in his pulpit and had published in the papers. CAl,{ D. \ 1'he undersigned hereby ex- presses his regret that in his sermon last Sunday evening, the distinction between the moral condition of Union College students as regards drinking customs at the present time, and in the past, was not more strictly drawn, and would offer the further explana- tion : read 'liberally patronized 'instead of 'supporfed.' In afriendly conference with the students he finds that not more than four per cent. of the busi- ness of such saloon is obtained from the college. 3· The speaker did not intin1ate that the drinking habits of those Alumni of Union College who have been in Congress were any worse or more frequently indulged in than those of Alumni of other colleges, for he thinks all such drinking customs are equally bad. With this last reference, all allu- sions to the students of Union ended. The sermon contained nothing more that was meant to apply to them. In order to correct any further misapprehension that may have arisen beyond Schenectady-the sermon being designed entirely for home consumption-thespeaker volunteers the further statement from his own observation and belief, that, at no tin1e previous to the present, was there a higher n1oral tone among the students, more regard for temperance principles, and in the class and study 1.

The statement that ' one saloon is notoriously supported largely by the college students,' should have themselves, but n1ore especially is the credit for such results due to the earnest and hard-working Faculty who aim at and succeed in keeping high the standard of the college,

If con1parisons be made with other col- leges, it would be safe upon the speaker's observations to say, that for good morals, studious application, ability of the instructors. or safety in the social environment of the stu- founded by the enterprise and en- dowed by the money of the church of which he has the honor to be the pastor.\ In the above card there is not the least sign of an apology, for the incorrect and grossly insulting state-· ments which the speaker had made; and as for his pitiably lame explana- dents committed to her care, Union tions, let us examine each separately will now stand superior to the aver- and see how t.nuch justice he has yet age, and perhaps peer to the best i done. college in the United States.

He has only to add, that if, while fighting the chief enemy of the city and college, he has inad- vertcntly wounded his friends he regrets it. While heartily hating the traffic in intoxicating liquors, he pro- poses still to remain friendly to that college which was in its ong1n lime to the ridiculous. The for:m er statement was that Mr. Weincke's saloon was \ notoriously supported largely by the college students 11 ; he next said this should have read \liberally patronized\; and finally he ended by declaring that only four per cent. of Mr. Weincke's business was 1 obtained from the college. Perhaps if he had pushed his inquiries a little further he would have found that Mr. Weincke spoke the truth when

THE CONCORDIENSIS. 12 7 -- --- --------- - --- he said that what he got· from the students would not buy his salt. The third point in his explanation(?) was merely a silly evasion of the question. He said he had not intimat- ed that the Alumni of Union College in ·congress were greater drinkers than those of other colleges. Perhaps not. Then, if there was any sense at all in his \Vords; they implied that the Congress of the United States were a set of topers, that Union Col- lege graduated more topers than any other college, and that consequent! y she sent n1ost men to Congress ; statements which, with the exception of the last, the speaker \vould find difficult to substantia-te . . Mr. W eincke says that if the writ- er's statement is true, the only differ- ence between the reverend gentle- tnan and himself is that the latter sends n1en to Congress, while the former sends them to Utica. He then said that this refer- ence to our Congressn1en was the last allusion to the students. We believe he 1neant it to be, but no one would think so without being told. Without a break he had gone on to say that on a holiday, no lady \vould dare pass the drunken crowds that swarm around the hotels. Would not any candid reader very naturally suppose that he was merely continu- ing his comparison of the students of to-day with those of '67, and that he was comparing \the smoking half or wholly drunken crowds that swarm and loaf around the hotel steps\ to- day, with the \ drunken graduates\ that \sat and lolled and driveled with blear eyes and rum-flushed faces on the loafer crowded hotel- h ,, . 86 ? pore es 1n I ? . If this was not the writer's meaning, he should have been more careful with his para- graphing. For the speaker's compliment to Union College as it now is, we thank him. As regards his declaration of friendship toward the J:i-..aculty and students, we can only say he takes a queer way of showing it. In one of the recent examinations in Williams College, the Ji\\'reshman class \vent in in two divisions. The first division came out bringing the questions with the answers worked out. The second division, or at least thirteen of theirnumber,appropriated these, and of course went in thor- 1 oughly prepared. The Professor, learning of the trick, notified the Faculty, and the thirteen guilty ones have been suspended until May 19. We tender our hearty congratula- tions to the Faculty of Williams Col- lege for their prompt action in this matter, and earnestly wish that in every college all fraud; whether per- petrated by a class or by an individ- ual, in examination or in the

Inasmuch as many tnen in co11ege love athletic games, and since base- ball, for many reasons, cannot be en- joyed by all, we do not see \vhy a lawn tennis club could not be fonned \vithout interfering \vith other sports. 'fhis game is becoming n1ore and n1ore popular, and the prospects are that an extensive association will be forn1ed an1ong the colleges. Union has alwavs succeeded ·well in ·what- . ../ ever she bas undertaken, and there destined to ren1ain popular for a number of years at least, and to in- crease in importance among recog- nized and established college sports, there seems to be no good reason why an intercollegiate lawn tennis association should not be formed at once. If such an association could be formed this winter a tournament equal in interest and exciting as a base-ball game might be held in the tory steps taken soon in regard to this matter.\ The Yale Daily News asked a sin1ilar question.: \Why we do not have a lawn tennis tournament with our Harvard, Columbia and Princeton friends? All three of the colleges have tennis clubs. Harvard, we understand, has the championship of New England. We \vould like noth- ing better than to see our champions meet with hers. We hope something will be done in regard to getting a match between son1e other college or colleges.\ To this may be added the Yale

Record's conundrum, \and what num- I Sophia Smith College at Northamp- 0 her is more productive of fun than ten is?\ \ The lawn tennis boom has struck Princeton in earnest, and a white flannel suit and a racket is all the rage. Tournaments are being played, and an inter-class contest will serve to place tennis on a firmer basis than heretofore,\ says the Princetonian. \The tennis tournament has been finished,\ said the Harvard Ecko, \and the results are very satisfactory. It has been shown that out of the very large number of tennis players in college there are quite as many who play a good game. A tourna- ,ment is in progress at Yale, and the interest in tennis at all the colleges seems to be on the increase. We ought this year to take some decisive steps toward instituting an annual contest with other colleges.\ ''There are half-a-dozen first-class players in the university,\ observed the Colu1nbz'a Spectator, \and if an inter-collegiate tournament should take place, as we judge probable from the college papers; we would certainly stand a very fair chance of coming out creditably.'' The Wz'llia11ts Argo argued that as a high degree of proficiency had been manifested by lovers of the sport, that they might safely undertake a series of games with the young ladies of the ton. At the close of October, when the four existing clubs had joined to- gether in a formal organization and arranged a tournament, the Trinity Tablet said : \It is a wonder that this fortn of athletics was not adopted by the students before, it has so many advantages, especially for those who have little time to give to such h . \ t 1ngs. The adoption of the pastime by fifteen of the ~u tgers men was also mentioned approvingly by the Tar- gu1n, which later printed a list of newly chosen officers, and said that \ a constitution has been drawn up and adopted and the necessary ma- terial for playing ordered.\ Likewise at Lafayette, according to the Your- nat, ''lawn tennis has made its ap- pearance, and bids fair to attain as great popularity as it has at other colleges. The players may be seen practising daily on the campus.\ The Wesleya1t Argus reported:· ''The tennis players have braced and two fine courts adorn our can1 pus. Great interest is being shown in the game, especially by the novices. The club is limited to sixteen men1- bers\ The Bowdoi1Z Orie-nt notices the organization of a tennis club by the Sophomores.

The \Major\ bas introduced a little hand-book on military tactics among the lower classes. It is a handy unexpensi ve volume, contain- ing complete information for the soldier in company movements, etc. A series of cuts to illustrate the text accompany the book. It is printed by a Detroit firm, and is a compila- tion from more exhaustive works. At a meeting of the Base Ball Association amendments to the con- stitution were adopted by which all n1onies are to be deposited in the hands of the treasurer of the college, and bills are to be paid by him only after passing through the hands of an auditing board. This board is com- posed of Prof. Price, Ford, '82, and Waddell, '82. mores of organizing regular foot ... ball elevens, and would be glad to see an eleven m·ade from each of the four classes. As we had no games last fall, it is probable that we will have some athletic sports in the spring. It has been the custom to confine the games to a few contests in which only trained athletes could contest with a hope of success. Why would it not be advisable to add some con- tests in which many could compete, and which would afford amusement to the spectators ? Other colleges infuse a large comic element into their sports, and with good success. Let us have a few wheel- barrow, three-legged, sack-races, etc. If prizes are not numerous enough we think sufficient money could be col- lected among the students. Above all things let the prizes be money, I 1 and not useless tnedals and cups.
