In addition there are six fraternities off-campus who need houses. and if we are to in- crease our faculty this coming fall we must obtain homes for them also.\ \A new catalogue will be out soon,\ Dr. Davidson continued, \with a reorganizati n of curricu- lum, improving the coordination of both the liberal and technical courses. The faculty is recuced in size at the present time. particu· larly in the Liberal Arts coursrs. but by September the size of the faculty should be up to pre-war standards.\ \I feel,\ he concluded, \that one of the main problems that the students can assist in, is inducting the new neople.on the campus to the life of the college; its habits, prin- ciples. and traditions.\ President Davidson is a young man for a college president, having been born 40 years ago in Louis- vill, Kentucky. He got his A. B. at Harvard in 1925, completing the four year course in three years: an action that he regrets at present. During this undergraduate period his main extra-curricular activities were debating and singing in the Harvard Glee Club. Singing is still his favorite hobby, and though he prefers barber shop quartents, he still manages to sing many solos; usually parodies of his own making <We gleefully wonder what new verses he will have, after being at Union for a few months.) He tool~ his master's degree at the University of Chicago in 1930; both degrees in the field of litera- ture. His doctoral thesis, and this is an eye-opener. was \The Immi· gant Autobiography as a Dccument of Cultural Assimilation.\ While teaching at the University of Idaho in 1926 he married a stu- dent. Capitola Brown of Louisville. In the ensuing years they had two children, Cynthia. 7, and Christo· pher, 12. Mrs. Davidson plays bridge, and enjoys reading, but prefers being with people more than anything else. DR. CARTER DAVIDSON Dr. Ernest M.

The Concordiensis, in cooperation with the Interfra- ternity and Student Councils, is urging all students to indicate their opinions about a spring dance by filling in the blanks below and returning it as soon as possible to the Concordy office. If enough students are willing to signify their intention of attending such an affair, it will be possible to make early arrangements and thereby obtain an outstanding orchestra for the event. I favor (do not favor) having an all-college dance this spring. I pledge to support such a dance, if it is possible to have one. Signed .......................... , .. .

Home of the - . ,. / Concordiensis ./: It was in 1836 that the first step in the direction of growth was t~tken, and it was not more than three months latet· when. in Feb- ruary 1837, a Delta chapter was founded at CCNY, Two years later the Beta chapter at Yale was con· ceived, and so it continued until twenty-eight chapter stretched from the Atlantic to the Pacific, An im- portant factor that is extremely note-worthy is that because of careful placement and the strength of the Psi U union only one chapter of the entire group, the Alpha at Harvard, has become inactive. This record has never been equaled by THE CONCORDY NEEDS MEN any college fraternity. In Days of Old Psi U Rising from the days when the old Psi U's would approach their meet· ingplaces in downtown Schenectady two by two, Theta became extreme· ly influential in the college and maintaint>d a high degree of schol- arship during the first 25 years of the fraternity's life 70 of its 201 initiates were elected to Phi Beta Kappa. It was during this time that such illustrious men as Chester Arthur '48 and many others attended Union and were members of Psi U. ThP Rt>turn to the Campus Old Psi U met for almost fifty vears after its beginning in the ~arne general run of meeting places that were employed by all of the ft•aternities on campus. In the eighties, however. a new movement to build a house on campus began to take effect, and in 1892 a house was completed on approximately the same site that the present house now occupys. The house was .par· tially rebuilt from time to time for over a period of forty years, and finally the present house was erect- ed. This building is the newest fraternity house on campus, Working on the Concordiensis, the college newspaper, is one of the more worthwhile activities on the campus. This activity offers the interested student an opportunity not only to see how a paper is prepared and composed, but also to participate in the steps necessary to printing a college weekly. The men who are responsible for publica- tion of the Concordiensis are given a chance to view the makings of a newspaper from the inside. Beginning with the essential task of uncovering and writing the news, experience on the Concordy teaches much more about the newspaper game. Make-up, headline writing, advertising, editorial writing, and feature news are all included in. a college newspaper. Valuable practice in any or all of these fields may be gained while a student is still in college, In addition to the apparent material gains which this activity affords, we should also mention the fact that newspaper writing is a good method for improving literary tech- nique and style. l\Iany valuable contacts may be made as a college reporter and the person working on the paper often has a much fuller knowledge of what is going on around the campus. The Concordiensis has recently begun to blossom forth from its restricted wartime activity and is now in the midst of what might be termed a post-war reconversion period or a reorganization procedure. The staff is interested and anxious to have a number of new men to aid it in its weekly endeavors. We are issuing an invitation to any men who might enjoy working for this publication to come over to our offices in Washburn Hall and join us. The editor, Albert K. Hill, the managing editor, William G. Clark, and the business manager, Seymour T. Pearlman, will be glad to furnish more details and to give you an opportunity to demonstrate your journalistic skill. ABOUT 7,000 miles of coaxial cable will he added to ft our plant during the next few years. Inside each cable are six or eight copper tubes-each pair a broad communications highway over which two television programs or nearly 500 long distance telephone calls can travel. Giant plow-trains will \plant\ much of this cable deep in the ground-safe from storm and fire, This construction is hut a part of our activity in the television field. Now in an advanced experimental stage are plans to link coaxial cables and high frequency radio relay systems to provide a nationwide television network, Our part in television is the transmission of pro- grams from one station to another. As this new industry develops, the Bell System will be prepared to provide whatever network facilities are needed. BELL TELEPHONE SYSTEM FRIDAY.

Womly Herman and the Herd, band poll winners of 1945, usher in their-first pairing for the year with these titles. The former shows th·e great Herman trl!lmpet sec- tion of Can- doli, Berman, Hefti, Lewis, and Rogers in rare and fran- tic form. Gold Woody Herman Award win- ning \Flip\ Phillips tenors through both sldes, F1:ances Wayne sings Love Me, and Woody handles both vocals and the clarinet in the latter (Col- umbia). BOOGIE - Decca featm:es the powerhouse trumpeting of \Little Jazz\ by Roy Eldridge in a Buster Harding tune, Little Jazz Boogie. Dynamic Roy J'eaches for his bag of tricks in his trumpet rides and uses punching riffs, trills, and some stratospheric notes. His high ones into the fade-away are always exciting, and an Eldridge trademark. On the re- verse he solos to the Gershwin oldie, Embraceable You. j VOCAL STANDOUT - The \Voice\ has a pair of winning titles-Oh! What It Seemed To Be and Day By Day. Both are sugary with sentiment in a strictly wistful vein. Franlt Sina- tra's handling of the lyrics. Frcmk Sinatra and backed on both sides by some truly line orchestrating by Axel Stordahl, will make his fans shout with glee, and others, fans or not, nod with approval (Columbia). j DANCE DISCS-Charlie Spivak runs the gamut of his famed \sweetest trumpet\ style in The Bells of St. Mary's, from the RKO picture of the same name. His muted trumpet is supported by soft brass whrch estab- REVlEW all effects are highly pleasing, and are handled with excellent taste. Jimmy Saunders sings the vocals, and, for the fade, the band resolves into the tones of the Great Organ. On the flip- over Jimmy Saunders sings, You Can Cry On Somebody Else's Shoulder, which is done at a lively an.d easy dance dip (Victor). j Harry James gives an expansive treatment to the Chopin adapta- tion, I'm Always Chasing RiLin- bows. Here the James horn is heard in a groovy, open style that is lifted by a highly dance- able beat that the band drops in for support. Harry ~a111es Buddy Di Vito sings the vocals to an all-out sweet James ar- rangement. The platter-mate, Baby, What You Do To Me, has a lusty dance kick, screaming brass riffs, and vocal by chirper Kitty Kallen (Columbia). J Carmen Cavallaro turns in one of his best performances to date with a dance arrangement of W a1'saw Conce1'to. His flying fingers round out a type of piano technique seldom heard in a dance band. Throughout there is ·exceptionally good taste in the handling of muted brass and strings with unusual re- sponsive effects. On the baclting he plays, A Love Like This, and injects a buoyant Latin rhythm to support his piano and band, and also has the vocal sung by Gloria Foster (Decca).

6 Chaplain C. Victor Brown has issued an invitation to all stu- dents who are interested in de- veloping a campus wide discus- sion program dealing with reli- gious and ethic-a.] questions, and an organization to sponsor com- munity leadership projects, to meet in his home at 628 Nott St., this Tuesday evening at 7:30 P.M. I Enrollment Over Previous Years Dean's List Is Released The Dean's Office this week an- nounced that 147 students attained an index of 3.0 or higher last term and were therefore placed on the Dean's List for the term ending February 22nd. In the spring, a young man's fancy lightly turns to thoughts of The civilian section ·of the student, body by far outdid the Naval stu- dents by placing 86 men on the list to the Navy's 61. Of the civilians, 26 equaled or surpassed a 4.0 index, while 12 X a val ttainee,; al:.;u reached that point. The List, which includes representatives of nll classes and courses follows: where, in the general neighbot·- hood of Union College. he can find a room. Undoubtedly, many stu- dents are still searching for a room in which to dwell perma- nentlr. It has long been considered a necessity of life that man have shelter, a roof over one's head with walls to keep out wind or women from the North country. For years. eight hundred ot· less students have had rooms to call their own. sometimes even a room- mate or two to pat on the oock in time of financial need. Students of Union College in the past have expected, and received, a four- walled den with ceHing of lightly falling plaster. complete with a closet to conceal their baggiest at- tire, a desk at which they could sit and bury their heads. and a set of drawers in which they could hide their clothes, hair tonic, and other fluids of varying alcoholic content from probing housekeep- ers. Now, howevet·, everything has changed. The average student is either without a room or without the furnishings therein that have proven necessary for a happy home life. Some. rooming off-campus. have even been forced to place their bottles of evil brew on win- dow ledges for want of better places of safekeeping. The net result of such activities has been bitter encounters with land-ladies who fear the corruption of their morals, not to mention their daugh- ters. Sadistic students have threat- ened to build Quonset huts on Li- brary Field. to li\'e in the shadow and shelter of Payne Gate. or to stay at the end of the line in Hale House and thus remain there o>·er- night. What has brought on this housing problem. this bit temess on the part of students? To quote a resident of Albany who desired. but was not allowed. to move to V..'ash- ington a year ago. \Let's take a look at the records.\ Civilians: Bach<\lor uf Arts; James A. Baar. LeRoy W.

Last Thursday four hundred new stu- dents arrived at the school. Of these, all but a bout fifteen were veterans. One hundred and eighty had started their college careers at Union befor·e the war, while theother two hundred and twenty are new to the campus. This con- stitutes the largest influx experi- enced by this hundt·ed and fifty year old institution in five post- war ears. The student totals of three hundred and fifty navy train- ees. and about four hundred and fifty >·eternns and one hundred other civilians adds up to an en- rollment surpassing any enrollment in Union history. Dean Charles F. F. Garis has announced that Pven this figure will be surpassed in September. -----0--- Interfraternity Council to Meet W. Manne!, John R. :Martucelli, D. M. McCormick, John H.

Wyatt, recently sep- arated naval lieutenant commar.der and thts we~k named dit'ector of alumni relations and placement, will head a faculty committee of consultants for this work. \Integration of alumni and place- ment work will make for maximum efficiency in helping more than 3,000 Union men being separated from military service to make satis- factory readjustment to civilian life,\ Dr. Davidson added, in ap- pointing a seven-man faculty com- mittee to include Prof. Harold W. Blodgett, chairman of the field of English; Prof. William W. Bennett, professor of economics; Prof. Charles B. Hurd, chairman of the field of chemistry; Prof. Harold W. Bibber, chairman of the division of engineering; ProL Warren ·C. Tay- lor, professor of civil engineering; Frances C. Pray, director of an- nouncements; and WUford H. Ketz, asistant to the dean. In taking up his new duties, Wyatt said he will place job re- conversion for alumni as the num- ber one goal of Graduate Council activities for 1946. Alumni gradu- ated in the past decade are being canvassed to draw up· a list of graduates in search of employment. Employer alumni and hundreds of business firms are being aslted to submit information on positwns open for college graduates. Expansion of placement activi- ties at Union is based on sev- eral decades of placement work by the college. For a number of years Miss Esther G. Ely, former registrar, was responsible for the work. Upon her retirement, a com- mittee continued placement affairs and in 1935 a bureau was set up under the direction of Mr. Wyatt who headed the worlt until his call to navy sen.-ice in 1942. During the war period, ::-.:Ir. Ketz handled placement. Since termination of the ·war .. Wyatt has been director of employ- ment for the Naval Ordnance Lab- oratory in Washington.

Gerald Rock presided, acted as temporary chair- man uptil a new slate of officers could be elected. The off campus representatives were not present, therefore elections were tabled until the following week. The big topic of discusion was the Spring Prom. The college has put their \Go Ahead Sign\ on this im- portant social event of the season \if the student body proves that they will give their complete sup- port. The Prom Committee of the In- terfraternity council was sanctioned by the Student Council to proceed with its work on the Prom until a committee from the Student Coun- cil could be appointed to assist. The deciding upon a date and the se- curing of a popular orchestra will be looked into by the Prom Com- mittee. The Council urges those who do \business\ with the Union College Date Bureau to look at their Sldd- more or Nott Terrace \Drag\ with a second thought in mind, lor should we say a third), namely, as a prospect for the spring Prom. Suggestions were advanced as to how the line at Hale House could be moved along at a faster pace, and were promptly adopted by the Hale House management. Any one interested in putting their energy, brains and talents to work in order to inject some fresh life into still dormant college activ- ities such as Mountebanks and the Idol: should contact the council. A committee consisting of Hank Hoculli, Perky Pearlman. and Ed Wiliiamson was appointed to work on the series of lectures that are to be given on the advantages and disadvantages of service organiza- tions such as the American Legion, the VFW, and the Veterans Ad'• ministration. -----o--~~-- Veterans' Groups To Send Speakers To Union Campus A committee headed by Heney Vif. Hochuli, which was recent!?' appointed by the Student Counc!l to obtain speakers from the vari- ous veteran's organizations to lec- ture to Union College students, has planned a series of. We~nesday Chapel programs whzch wtl! fea- ture representatives from all of the larger veterans' groups. . . Two Ballots Taken rector was correctly forecast as In planning the experiment, Prof. winner with an average support of Larrabee gave his class surprise 713 percent. baltots and asked them to register Close Con!Rst their choices for the 1945 movie \Oscars.\ A few days later the class was supplied with a sheet of relevant information concerning other awards and additional in- formation concerning the judg- ments of experts, movie reviewers, etc. They studied the matter and discussed it among themselves. Then a second balot was taken and the result sealed to await the ver- dict of 9,000 members of the motion picture industry who voted the awards. Picked \Lost Week End\ This year the class picked \The Lost Week End\ as best picture, and correctly predicted awards to Ray Milland as best actor, Billy Wilder as best director, Joan Craw- ford as best actress, and Anne Revere as best supporting actress. Missed James Dunn The one \miss\ this year was James Dunn in \A Tree Grows in Brooklyn\ who was awarded the gold statuette for the best per- formance by a supporting actor. In the Union poll, he ·finished second to Robert Mitchum of \The Story of G. I. Joe,\ probably because of the heavy preponderance of vet- erans in the class, 22 of whom had seen the war picture as against only 14 who had seen \A Tree Grows in Brooklyn.\ There was much more doubt hero is on its shoulders.

Top Registration As 304 Men Enter The release of men from the services paved the way for the largest registration at Union Col- lege in the past four years, with 304 men having entered the col- lege on March fourth to continue 01 begin their education. Prom Returns to Friday Night One of the main changes being undet·taken .for the pending dance is the switch of the all-college dance to Friday evening and the re- turn of individual house dances to Saturday night. This will be the first time since the war hit the campus with its full impact that the prom has been held on a Fri- day night. The Administration yielded to student opinion on this point and will allow the dance to run from 10 to 2 A.M. with the understanding that students will attend classes as usual the follow- ing morning, Attendance at classes the morn- ing after house dances at the \Win- ter Carrousel\ week-end was nor- mal and if the students match that z·ecord this time, the holding of future dances will be assured. House Dances Planned The committee is already work- ing on arrangements for the in- dividual house dances to be held Saturday evening. These affairs will be held from 9 to 12 P.M. in the various dorms. The Prom Commit- tee expects that all nine of the fra- ternity houses now being occu- pied as .dorms will be opened for Saturday night's festivities. Among the probable dance sites are Alpha Delta Phi, Beta Theta Pi, Delta Chi, Delta Phi, Delta Upsilon, Phi Delta Theta, Phi Gamma Delta, Psi Upsilon, Chi Psi, and Sigma Phi. Baseball Game Scheduled In addition to the two dances appearing on the program, the traditional baseball contest with the Hamilton college nine will also be a part of the week end sched- ule. A record crowd is anticipated and should furnish a good deal of hacking for the diamond squad. The committee is planning sev- eral more events to fill out the pro- gram and every student is guar- anteed more than his money's worth of entertainment, The date is only a little over a month away, so with the old axiom, \The early bird gets the worm lor woman)\ in mind, every student is urged to swing his personal plans for the week end into effect at once.

In days gone by, members of the gym classes were often used in this vvork. However, with physical educa- tion compulsory for the Navy, and not re- quired of veterans, it is impossible to obtain their services in this line. We would like to suggest that the Student Council consider this proposition and investi- gate possibilities of putting such a plan into action. A number of colleges have community service projects in which the students render their college community some sort of aid along lines of this sort. Whatever work is done benefits not only the individual, but the college as a whole. Union might adopt such a system, but not on a compulsory basis. We could rely on an I individual's pride in his college to participate i for an hour or two in such an effort. With an all-college prom coming up in l\Iay, we should all make some effort to make our campus presentable to our guests. In its present state, we would be looked at in anything but a favorable light.

Bobby Sherwood and his orches- tra are mpidly climbing to the pinacles that the great dance bands of the country attain. The awards Sherwood and company have re- ceived do not speak as well for his populal'ity as do the numerous en- gagements he has played through- out the country. The band has re- cently appeared at two spots which feature the outstanding orchestras of the United States, the Para- mount Theatre in New York City and the Glen Island Casino in New Rochelle. Get a Date! Sherwood's public appearance· list reads something like a directory of the \400\ outstanding theatres and hotels. He has toured the States from coast to coast and was widely acclaimed at each appearance. Some of his major engagements were in Boston, New York, San Francisco, Cleveland, Miami and Chicago. NPver Hesitate! The collegiate circuit has also been electrified by his playing. Har- vard, Yale, Cornell, Rutgers and Penn State are only a few of the many colleges at which the group has put in an appearance. In ad- dition to all this, Sherwood and his orchestra have toured many mili- tary installations to put on shows for servicemen. Their appreciation of his talents and efforts was shown when a 1945 Billboard poll selected him as the young band which the G.I.'s most favored. Ballots in this survey came in from all corners of the globe in which American soldiers were fighting. R!\rnember the Date! With the signing of a top-notch band and the selection by the Student Council of three men to serve on the group planning the affair, the committee has begun \Operation D\-\Operation Dance.\ Wally Wiggins was elected as chair- man of the committee and he will work with the following men: Hank Hochuli, Joe Harmon, Bob Scott, AI Hill, Seymour Pearlman, Jack Tway, Stu Miller and Dick Palla.

Bobby Sherwood and his orches- tra are rapidly climbing to the pinacles that the great dance bands of the country attain. The awards Sherwood and company have re- ceived do not speal{ as well for his popularity as do the numerous en- gagements he has played through- out the country. The band has re- cently appeared at two spots which feature the outstanding orchestras ,of the United States, the Para- mount Theatre in New York City and the Glen Island Casino in New Rochelle. Get a Date! Sherwood's public appearance list reads something like a directory of the \400\ outstanding theatres and hotels. He has toured the States from coast to coast and was widely acclaimed at each appearance. Some of his· major engagements were in Boston, New York, San Francisco, Cleveland, Miami and Chicago. NPver Hesitate! The collegiate circuit has also been electrified by his playing. Har- vard, Yale, Cornell, Rutgers and Penn. State are only a few of the many colleges at which the group has put in an appearance. In ad- dition to all this, Sherwood and his orchestra have toured many mili- tary installa lions to put on shows for servicemen. Their appreciation of his talents and efforts was shoWn when a 19·15 Billboard poll selected him as the young band which the G.I.'s most favored. Ballots in this survey came in from all corners of the globe in which American soldiers were fighting. Remember the Date! With the signing of a top-notch band and the selection by the Student Council of thr·ee men to serve on the group planning the affair, the committee has begun \Operation D\- -\Operation Dance.\ Wally Wiggins was elected as chair- man of the committee and he will work with the following men: Hank Hochuli.

H is one 0f great social stresses in which many men lool{ed toward the development of a better society through closer relationships and understandings. It is one of Jack- sonian democracy opposing an American aristocracy. It is one in which college students were given a choice of roads to follow: one leading in the direction of the secret fraternity; the other, to- '~<Vards the goal set by Delta Up- silon's founders. It was at this time that a group of men at Williams College, seek- ing a closer relationship and de- testing the conditions brought about by the secret societies, which they found almost intolerable, formed themselves into what was to become Delta Upsilon, then known as the Social Fraternity. There were thirty members when the organization was fol'med on November 4, 1834, and by 1838 its membership had increased' to eighty-two, or more than two-thirds of the college. Its success had been complete. The N!'W Idea Far more important, however, than whether this organization lived or died, is the ideal behind it. H should be remembered that while The Social Fraternity grew and augmented its control over the Wil- liams campus such secret societies as Kappa Alpha at Union and Alpha Delta Phi at Hamilton were doing likewise. These were organi- zations that wel'e secret and placed themselves above the common herd! \Believing that secret societies are calculated to destroy the har- mony of college, to ct·eate distinc- tion not founded on merit, and to produce strife and animosity, we feel called upon to counteract the evil tendencies of such associa- tions.\ This is a part of the pre- amblo:> of the Social Fratemity. Few words could express mOI'e ex- plicitly the feeling of these men to- ward the secret society. TO OUR DEAD H:EROES To you, our dead heroes, we have dedicated this issue of the \Concordy.\ We have done this to sho\v our appreciation of your great sacrifice. We are proud of you. Proud, because you are men of UnioH-because you oHce were part of us. Proud, because you are men of Amel'ica, and as such are not only our heroes, but also heroes of aU righteous people throughout the world. We wish to honor you, but you have passed into another world.

Our g-l'ief over your deaths is great. The fact that they shall not have been in vain is our only consolation. You entered the war, knowing· that war \Vas necessary for our survival. Some of you enlisted, others were drafted. You knew that this war would not be easy to win. You knew that many sacrifices would be de- manded by the god of war. But you also knew that the war would be won. Nations fighting for justice cannot lose - their strength is too great to suffer defeat.

We honor you for your courage and fearlessness. We honor you as Americans. And lastly, we honor you as men of Union-as our men.

It should be 1•emembered that while The Social Featernity grew and augmented its control over the Wil- liams campus such secret societies as Kappa Alpha at Union and Alpha Delta Phi at Hamilton were doing likewise. These were organi- zations that were secret and placed themselves above the common herd! You are men of Union-graduates who went out into the world to find that it was not a bed of roses but -of thorns, and under- graduates who left in the middle of your college career to answer the call to battle. You at·e our heroes. We knew many of you as fellow students, as fraternity brothers, and as comrades. Uany of our unforgetable memories are associated with you. Our g-rief over your deaths is great. The fact that they shall not have been in vain is our only consolation. You may not be among us anymore ; yet, never, never shall we forget you a.nd what you have done. You have won us the war and now we must win the peace. As with war, it will be costly. But you have shown us that no expense is too great, no task too laborious if our country, our homes, our entire philosophy of life are at stake. You knew that, and therefore you went out to fight. .. PARIS IN THE SPRING .. \Believing that secret societies are calculated to destroy the har- mony of college, to create distinc- tion not founded on merit, and to produce strife and animosity, we feel called upon to counteract the evil tendencies of such associa- tions.\ This is a part of the pre- amble of the Social Fraternity. Few words could express more ex- plicitly the feeling of these men to- ward the secret society. You entered the war, knowing that war was necessary for om survival. Some of you enlisted, others were drafted. You knew that this war would not be easy to win. You knew that many sacrifices would be de- manded by the g-od of war. But you also knew that the war would be won. Nations fighting for justice cannot lose - their strength is too great to suffer defeat. You knew that you might never return, and yet, :vou went fearlessly-you knew that it must be, that the1·e was no alternative, and that it had to be wot·th the cost.

Confucius said it a good many years ago, but it still holds true today. In the field of sports, nothing proves more interesting than good action, group or in- dividual photos in the section of a publication devoted to athletics.

In the field of sports, nothing proves more interesting than good action, group or in- dividual photos in the section of a publication devoted to athletics. The Sports department of the Con- cordiensis would like very much to print pictures each week on this page, but it has been unable to locate photographers. If any students who are planning to photograph any of the action in baseball, tracl\, football, lacrosse, -or any of the other sports during the spring, would be willing to loan his prints to this office it would be appreciated. See David Markson at Phi Gamma Delta House regard- ing the matter. ---·0·--- NOTICE What Union College professor came here as a former T.C.U. foot- ball sul:)stitute and through the years has vktually made the All- American teams?

Freshman Orientation fer All in FoFur Lectures; To Study Breakfast Question The Student Council held meeting of the season Monday night with Perky Pearlman presid- ing in the absence of President Donald T. Olson, Mr. Anthony Hoadley and Mr. William South were invited to an- swer queries as to th~ possibilities of not chargmg men for breah.fusts they did not eat. After a half hour of considerable debate, after which both guests had to leave, n0 sat- isfactory answers 0r condusions nad been arrived at. The p1 e>b!t•m will be brought up ng1.'n a~ the next meeting. Numerous suggestions were ceived for the relecation of the Scuttlebutt. Some members thought that the Navy mess hall would serve as an excellent Scuttlebutt and recreation center where stu- dents could enjoy bringing their dates after affairs, dancing, and refreshments. Fl'Osh Orientation .Spencet· Gowrie, reporting on the Freshmen Orientation Committee, stated that his group had proposed compulsory attendance to a series of four lectures in Old Chapel for all first-term students. These fresh- men Orientation lectures w.ill be held from 12:50 until 1:20 p.m. for four successive days. Starting Monday, April 1 The first lecture will deal with the opportunities for athletics at Union .College and,. members of the athletic staff will speak. The sec- ond lecture will be given by Dr. Charles N, Waldron. Student Ac- tivities will be the subject of the third. and a pep rally and sing. led by the cheer leaders, will com- prise the fourth. The Council and the Administration have both sanc- tioned this compulsory orientation program. In connection with the current spring cleaning Union College is undergoing, a proposal was made to place more trash cans around the campus, The poor condition of the old Blue Gate was condemned as an eye-sore by members of the Council. Don Larson and Don Trainer were appointed to see Mr. Hoadley about having this condi- tion alleviated. 'Vhat About the Alumni Review? A question was raised concerning the Alumni Review. Some students complained that they had paid their fifty cents but they were not receiving the Review. Wilford H. Ketz cleared the matter up when he pointed out that the students will receive the Review free of charge after graduation. Wally Wiggins reported that the fraternities have decided to back the Saturday night house dances 100 per cent. Some students were alarmed at the overwhelming trend and em- phasis put on prayer at the Wed- nesday assemblies. The matter will be looked into by a committee and Chaplain Brown. --·· Tomorrow night, the Student Council's highly advertised Fresh- man Frolic will begin at 9:00 in the ·' Alumni Gymnasium to the lilting music of Fre·ddy Gray and his All Collegiate Orchestra. The entire af- fai!· is being given by the ·Council on a non-profit basis and will be financed by contributions which will be accepted at the dance. Singing Tomorrow A Belated Welcome The purpose of the dance is pri- marily to welcome the incoming Freshman and secondly to bring together the entire college fot· the fii'St time this tet·m. Originally scheduled for the second week of the semester, the dance had to be postponed for various complications which set in at the beginning of the month . Another important reason behind the affair is the desire to acquaint the Freshmen and all others in- terested in local gil'is in order that they might know and be able to secure dates for the Spring Prom. Freddy Gray and his band have played at many college affairs be- fore including the successful dance held after Union's victory over R.P. I. last winter. Gray has an eight to ten piece orchestra, which has been famous around Schenectady for many years playing at Union house parties before the war. His music ----------------1 is always almost continuous with a FRATERNITIES NOTE! The Interfraternity Council will meet in the Student Activ- Ities Office, Washburn Hall, Tuesday evening, April 2, at 7:00 P. M. All fraternities are re- quested to send theil· represen- tatives to the meeting with a complete list of their pledges, present members and officers. Students To Flood Campus Next Fall Union College will put its \small college philosophy\ in storage for the next two years to meet the en- rollment bulge caused by educa- tion demands of returning veterans, Dr. Carter Davidson, president of the 151 year old institution said this week. Pledging cooperation \to the full- est extent of our facilities,\ Dr. Davidson explained that the college will expand, if necessary, from its normal enrollment of approximate- ly 800 students to a peak of 1400 in order to fulfill an obligation to veterans in the capital district area who may be able to attend college only by commuting from their own homes. The temporary expansion will be undertaken to meet the needs of three groups, Dr. Davidson said. These groups include <1) return- ing veterans who are former Union men, < 2} sons of Union alumni and other high school or preparatory school graduates who are necessary to provide continuity for the nor- mal college program, !3) and civi- lians and veterans living in the immediate vicinity who can live at home and who thus have no hous- ing problems. Union College hopes to return to its small coil ege philosophy by 1949. In the meantime it will re- tain as many as possible of its \small college\ ideals and continue its \balanced .college\ structure. minimum of breaks. DPcorations and Effects The decorations promise to be novel and several exceptional novel- ties are in the offering. The fore- most of these is that upon entering the Gym each couple will be greet- ed by a member of the dance com- mittee and be presented with a green or white carnation according to the escort's class. Another special innovation will be the free cigarettes that will be given to each couple with the com- pliments of Chesterfield. This added attraction was procured through the efforts of H. Gerald Rock. Finally, th.ough far from least im- portant, is the arrangement by which refreshments will be sold from 8 to 12:30 in the Scuttlebutt by members of the faculty. It was through the extensive cooperation of Dr. C. V. Brown that these arrangements have been made and much gratitude has been extended to him by the Student Council. Footing the Bill The dance is being presented to the Students of Union College ab- solutely free of charge by their Stu- dent ·Council, and all bills will be met by contributions which are ex- pected to be large. It should be re- membered, however, that any defi- cit that occurs will have to be met out of Council funds and will ham- per greatly the chances of having more informal occasions such as this one in the future. Because of this it is hoped that all atten.ding the dance tomorrow night will do their share in supporting it and will therefore insure themselves of marty more enjoyable times. The committee's expectations can be entirely summed up in D. T. Olson's staement \We expect a ter- rific crowd. It's going to be awfully dark.\ ----o•---- Prexy-Dish Me Up a Malted ·snounoo +uapn+s pua Al!ll.IO:jB.IJ.IBlUI 8t:(l JO S}.IOJJa 8 Jl O:j. anp UI8t{l Ol uado MOll SJ All ati 1 pull IUM 8 ql pass8.Idxa .Kp~a~~ aaeq s)uapn+S a28HOO uo!Ufl .K 11 j 8 ·:wl!l 'fll.M.

It was in the year 1842, a year and a half after the founding of Chi Psi, that the United States brig Somers put out for Africa. Onboard with the warrant of act- ing midshipman was Philip Spen- cer, one of Chi Psi's founders, The trip to Africa was totally un- eventful, but it was on the return passage, approximately three days off St. Thomas, that a mutiny was reported aboard ship. The pur- ser's steward cla·imed that Spencer was the ringleader. The accused were seized, chained with their hands behind their necks, and served meals composed of a bad smelling variety of mush. Tension ran high throughout the ship. Something had to be done. The ship's commander, Alexander Slidell MacKenzie, called a court of inquiry in his cabin whereupon various members of the crew were questioned, 'but none of the ac- cused parties were brought before the makeshift court. Then, after a short consultation among the officers, MacKenzie called all hands on deck and addressing Spencer, said. \You have ten minutes to live.\ After the accorded length of time Spencer was blindfolded; his feet and hands were tied together; a rope was placed around his neck; and he was hung from the yard- arm with two other members of the crew. It was not until many hours later, sometime after dark, that he was cut down and ignominously dropped into the Atlantic. On the 14 of December the Som- Prs arrived in New York, anchored in the navy-yard, and held little communication with the shore. Spencer had been the son of Presi- dent Tyler's Secretary of War and charges of murder, oppression, and illegal punishment had been pre- ferred. The nation reverberated with the news. A court of inquiry was convened i and after a drawn-out, sordid affair acquitted MacKenzie, but the fact that MacKenzie could not prove the guilt of the other men involved in the affair, whom he had brought back with him, proves the incred- ible lack of sound evidence, the superficial thought which had pre- ceded the act. and the great in- justice and wrong of the entil•e af- fair. His actions had been excused by a nation because of the cus- toms of the navy at that time, but the fact still remains that Spencer died without ever being given even an opportunity to defend himself. Nor was this tragedy in Amer- ican Naval history to end here for its effects were to be felt by ali liv- ing participants for the remainder of their lives. Spencer's mother, shocked beyond relief, was to die ?oon after, always believing in the mnocence of her son, while Mac- Kenzie, himself, was to die an un- happy and disquieted man not more than six years following the voyage. Always badagered from without by attacks on his con- duct; always tortured from w·ithin by conscience, the man's life closed at the age of forty-five. Not even the Som!'rs long survived Spencer, for she sank in a gale off Vera Cruz in 1846 carrying forty men down with her to join the ill-fated midshipman. But today Spencer lies not for- gotten, nm· will he ever. Chi Psi's will always remember his name. The world has 'long since buried him, but his fraternity never will.
