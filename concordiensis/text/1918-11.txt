On June 20, 1916, Captain Miller first ~ntered active duty in the service of Uacle Sam, enlisting in Company C, 18th Pennsyh-ania National Guard. whcih is now the lllth Infantry, .:;en·ing in France, and which so nobly accounted for itself fighting with the 11arines at Chateau Theirry. With Company C, Captain Miller served six months at El Paso, Texas, during the ~Iexican trouble along the border. He retllrned home Christmas day, 1916, and was mustered out of service the following month. April 12, 1917, he re-entered the service of the Na- tiona! Guard with his former com- !)any, which was at that time engaged in guarding railroads at Pittsburgh. Due to his faithful service he grad- ually rose in r.mk from corporal to scrgean t and ftrst sergeant. .

He was then sent to Camp Meade, lo.Iaryland, where he was attached to various units. He was at Camp Meade when the first draft contingents arrived and assisted in as- signing them to the 29th Training Battalion.

The two years courses in electrical and civil engineering, instituted under the S. A. T. C. regime, are to consist of about ninety-six weeks, as com- pared with the former four year courses of little over one hundred twenty weeks. By the elimination of subjects, such as German, French, English, Rhetoric, and Argumentation, which have only an indirect value in engineering, the courses are shortened by two years but only by about twenty five college weeks, without seriously :mpairing their practical value. The drawing has, if anything, been in- creased. The vital defect in the new courses is the lack of practical train- ing which the ordinary summer V!lCO.• tion afforded. NO.2 UNION DEFEATED IN GAME Al' HAMilTON Rain and Repeated Fumbling Loses Game fr:>r Union. NARROW SCORE OF 2-0 Line Holds Well and Backs Pierce Center for Gains-But One Forward Pass. Union was defeated in the initial game of the football season last Satur- day, by Hami-lton, at Clinton, N. Y., by the narrow margin of 2-0. A rain- storm prevented any sensational play- mg and it was only through a \fluke\ that Hamilton managed to score a ~afety, thereby winning the game. During the first quarter the Garnet ,?layers were a little nervous but this soon wore off and they showed good iorm. It was in this quarter that Hamilton was obliged to ki.:k and ~ferriman, who caught the ball near lJnion's goal-post, was downed im- mediately. Then Union spoiled a kick ..md a Hamilton man captured the pigskin behind the Garnet goal. At the time the referee called this a touch- Jown, but later, after a conference with the other officials, revoked his Jecision and called the play a safety. After Hamilton had scored the Union players settled down and out- ..:Jassed Hamilton although unable to score. The mud and rain made it im- c)ossible to try anything but center iine plunges. Heidorf then proved to be a consistent gainer and hit the Hamilton line for gain!:' of five and six yards at a time. The only thing that prevented a Garnet touchdown was the fact that the ball would generally be lost on a iumble after having ueen advanced 30 or 40 yards. Then Hamiltott, after a few vain attempts to hammer the Cnion line, woulcl punt to saiety and the grind would begin all over again. Cnion was able to effect but one complete forward pass-Merritnan to Heidorf. \Vere it not for the rain there would probably be a different stury to tell, because the line was strung and repeated efforts on Hamilton's part failed to made any impression on it. The backs worked well on defense as well as when attacking ant! plunged through the Hamilton center for con- sistent gains.

Syracuse University met Dartmouth College at Springfield and while it was generally expected that the former would win the game, it wo.s hardly to be .expected that the Orange would pile up 34 points to only six for the Green. It shows that Syracuse has a very strong team for this fall. A big surprise to the followers of the game was the victory secured by Swarthmore College over the Univer- sity of Pennsylvania by a score of 20 to 12. Swarthmore was playing the Red and Blue because Lafayette Col- lege was unable to keep the date, and the substitutes proved worthy foes as they prese11ted a very versatile style of play which was too much for the Pennsylvania eleven. ·wesleyan and Williams met in a game of great sentiment to New Eng- land followers of the sport, as these two colleges are among the oldest contestants in American football. Wesleyan sprang somewhat of a sur- 1- rise by winning, 19 to 0. Last year Vi illiams went through its season un- defeated. Annapolis Academy piled up an- o.ther big score, making 66 points against the Helena Naval Station which failed to score.
