THE CONCORDIENSlS VOL. 34 MAY 16, 1911 NO. 24 UNION DEFEATS ROCHESTER TEAM IN HOTLY CONTESTED TRACK MEET. MarEh Breaks Pole Vault Record--Baker Wins 20 Points-Vedder Wins the Two-Mile in Prettiest Race of the Day. In the first dual track n1eet between the two institutions in several years Union defeated Roch- ester Saturday afternoon on the oval by the score of 63 to 54. A strong wind considerably hindered the runners and made fast time impos- sible. In the first part of the tneet Rochester ran a way from Union and the outlook was al- together too dubious to inspire tnuch confidence in the Garnet athletes. However, Union came hack strong in the finish, taking all thr,ee places in the pole vault, first and second in the ha:tnmer throw in addition to a num.ber of firsts and thirds in other events. Marsh, 'r2, broke the college rec~rd in the pole vault, which was held by him- self. The record now stands ro feet 8 3-4 inches. Baker, a freshtnan, showed up particular:Jy well for Union and won twenty of the total points. Hull, J osoloski and Maley of the Albany depart- t11ents gave added strength to the team. The prettiest exhibition of track work, however, was seen in the two-mile run that was captured by V edd.er, '13. Vedder took the lead on the first lap, held it throughout the race and at the finish let ot1.t enough to considerably increase the dis- tance between himself and the second rna n. Cap- tain Travis n1ade a pretty finish in the event by sprinting in the last hundred yards and snatch- ing second place frotn Coughlin, of Rochester, who seemed to be booked to take it. The sun~tnaries: roo yard dash-Won by Chamberlain, Roches- ter; McDonald, Rochester, second; Maley, Union, third.

UNION TAKES HAMILTON INTO CAMP, BUT LOSES TO COLGATE. The two days' trip of the baseball team last Ft; day and Saturday resulted in a decisive victory over Hatnilton and the first defeat of the season by Colgate. On Friday afternoon Alpert pitched the nine to victory at Clinton when the Bluff and Blue, who were over confident as to the result of the gatne, was beaten by th.e score of I r to r. Union had its batting eye with them and played a snappy gam,e in the field. At no time did Hatnil ton give any signs of rallying and the re- sult was inevitable. Alpert aHowed but a few scattered hits. There was another story, however, the next day when Colgate ran up fifteen runs in seven tnntngs while Union tallied but three. It was (Continued on Page ro.)

'14. Uni~n C.oll~g~ Jlt-bl~ti\S That Union is again con1ing into her own along athletic lines is beco1ning more and more evident as the season advances. For a few years past some of the varsity teams have scarcely held their own in athletic competition with other college and university teams-a fact almost be- yond explanation, but none the less disappoint- ing to the studentbody that has loyally backed lTnion' s athletes in victory and defeat alike. All colleges are subject to such slumps in athletics and an off year or off years in one or more branches of intercollegiate sport is not uncon1- tnon even in the largest universities. Union has had the inevitable slun1p, but at last the ''hoo- doo\ is broken, and she is shaking off the reputa- tion of the rece11t past in a phenomenal rise to her rightful place among the colleges putting forth winning teams. The pace was struck when Union was represented by the fastest basketball five in the history of the college. Following the string of victories· in this sport the baseball team opened the season by defeating its most formid- able rivals. In tennis again Union is showing her superiority over the smaller colleges and even over institutions much larger in student registration. The track team is developing into one of the best organizations in this branch of athletics and even at this early date the foot- ball season has an auspicious aspect. Athleti:cal- ly speaking the outlook for Union could scarcely be brighter and it seems probabl:e that Garnet tea·ms will he frequent winners tn nqany ·inter- coH egia te contests in the future. Jln~nvmous Communi~atiQns Chancellor Day, of Syracuse tuliversity, re- ce<t'l'tly received several anonyn1ous letters in whkh the writers., students at the institution, threatened to leave the university with a number of sympathizers if certain members of the senior dass were per-mitted to graduate. At chapel ex- ercises the Chancellor spoke in bdef [n regard to the matter saying that such conduct was right- ly ignored and arraigning the wri t,ers in the strongest language. Many individuals and al- most all newspapers and magazines have been recepients of anonytnous communications; hut no right thinking person nor reputable ;periodical gives them a mon1ent's attention. Such a method of expressing views or of endeavoring to obtain an end is despicable. It is the course taken by a n1oral coward to accomplish that which the very method would indicate <~to be questionable. If the expression of his ideas and opinions are not worthy of the author's signature they should be suppressed as being detrimental to the cause or evidence of intrigue. Because of lack of space 1n this issue it has been found necessary to. condense much of the news and to otnit several contributions that have been received. We hope that it wi'll be possible to publish in the next issue of the Concordiensis that which has necessarily been withheld this week. As the management provided bttt four n1ore issu.es of the Concordiensis this year the past two nutnbers were omitted. For this reason much of the news carried this week is consid.erably anti- qua ted. Sin1ple announcetnents oi such news has seemed sufficient. There wiil be tJh,re.e n1ore issue of the Con- co.rdiensis, which will appear weekly until the close of college. This includes the cominence- ment number. NI I. A more. 2.

This meeting was called under the auspices of the Graduate Council and is one of a series of sin1ilar gatherings which aim to unite the alumni and Union more closely. A full report of the conference will appear on the alun111i page next week. H.oy W. Peters, '12, was elected secretary of the athletic board yesterday at college meeting. INTERCLASS BASEBALL SCI-IEDULE. ~ . Dr. MacComber discovered reoently a larg~ silver cup in Silliman Hall. It had in times past been used as an award for interclass baseball championship, but had been unused of fate. Now it has heen arranged to start interdass baseball contests and the winning class is to have its num- erals engraved upon the cup .. At a recent meeting of the captains and man- agers of the interclass tean1s, the following schedule has been adopted~ May 17-Class 'r2 with 'rr. May 17-Class '13 with '14. May rg-Class 'r I with 'r4. May 22-Class 'rz with 'r4 . ] une 5-Class '12 with '13. Date unsettled-Class 'r r with '13. . It has been decided that all games shall be played in seven innings except in case of a tie. Varsity track and baseball men are to be de- barred. Any game is to be forfeited to the team on the field if the other fails to appear. UNION TAKES HAMILTON INTO CAMP, BUT LOSES TO COLGATE. (Continued from Page 5.) an off day for the team. Frequent errors coupled with illness of O'Keefe did the trick. O'Keefe, who pitched a steady game against Colgate on the campus holding them down to a few hits and no runs, was taken sick while on the trip and went in the box with the hope of pulling into shape. His condition was such that his usual speed was lacking and Colgate snatched at the loop-hole to roll up a few runs. In the third inning Captain Dunn started to pitch for the first time this season. He was not in his usual form, and his lack of support at critical 111on1ents al- lo·wed the hotne teatn to score aln1ost at will. \NO-DEAL\ SYSTEM DEFEATED. The \no-deal\ resolution, which was laid on the table at the last meeting of the studentbody, was defeated by a large vote at yesterday's college meeting. The system was to improve the present conditions of class elections by having the stud- ents agree not to enter into combinations to elect or defeat a candidate for office. ( As!

EDITEI> 'BY GRADUA T:E COUNCIL BUFFALO DINNER. 0 n Monday evening of April 24th the Ah11nni Association of Western New York held their s@ring dinner at the University club of B.uffalo. P:resident Richmond and the secretary of the Graduate Council attended this gathering and tble seventeen alumni present held a most enthu- siastic meeting. Dr. Richmond gave a vivid picture of the pro- gress that the eollege had made in finances since :Cr. Bailey has been treasurer. He also pointed oat the marked growth in our faculty, in our physical equip1nent, and the nun1ber of oar stud- eats. The president also briefly outlined the m·any visits he had n1ade during the year to the different alun1ni associations and told of his pleas- ure at finding am.ong them many pro1ninent men. Three years ago this Buffalo association offered a silver cup as a t,rophy for the cha1npion hockey team of the city. This was done to bring the cDllege before the students in the various high schools and, as the report of the committee in ch.arge showed, had been a m.ost satisfactory agent. This cup was finally awarded to the Lafayette High School which had won it three consecutive ti1nes and the question rose as to wl1at the association would do to conti11ue this work. After some discussion a committee was appointed with power to act and they are to con- sider the many suggestions .offered that nigh\, 1'he most popular suggestion seen1ed to be to provide a scholarship which tnay be secured after a cotnpetitive examination by students frotn the local high schols. This Buffalo 1neeting showed that many of its 1n. en1bers were trying in practical ways to assist tb.e college. Five nan1es were given the secre- ta.ry of boys who were planning to come to Union as a result of the efforts of several of these tnen. This is proof of the statement that has appeared on this page so often during the year, that the interest of our alumni is of the first importance, for given this they will them.- s.elves find numerous valuable ways of helping the colilege. An1ong those pr·esent at the banquet were: Mr. Carl H. Vogt, Mr. F. E. Abbott, Mr. foseph T. Wright, Mr. E. P. White, Mr. Willian1 B. Col- burn, Mr. Daniel P. Manning, Dr. Andrew V. V. Raymond, ex-Congressman Howland B. Mahany, Mr. N onnan D. Fish and Mr. Miles Ayrault. rHE SCHENECTADY ASSOCIATION. The first annual dinner of the Schenectady Alurnni Association was held at the Mohawk Go:1f dub on April 27th. The hundred and five alutnni present gave this association a rousing sendoff and the enthusias.m over its future out- look was well reflected by the several speakers of the evening. Dr. Richtnond ren1arkecl that 1t was a fitting clin1ax for the n1any gatherings he had attended during the past winter and he be- lieved it w·as typical of the new interest the city was showing in Union college. The presi(lent was followed by Dr. Steintnetz who gave a re- n1arkable review of the changing tendencies in technical education. He laid emphasis on the soundness of the position which clen1anded an ec.ucated man bt=:fore atternpting to n1ake hin1 a technical expert. He further said Union college is not turning out electrical engineers and any institution which says it is doing this in a four years course tells a falsehood. Our aitn is to educate the tnen and at the same titne give then1 a grounding which will help them to becon1e electrica1 engineers. The doctor's development of this position was 111arked by his usual clear- ness of expression which ·made doubly forceful the great knowledge he brings to this subject. The other speakers were: Dean Ripton, Judge Strong, Rev. Clayton Potter and his Honor Mayor C. C. Duryee. The mayor was especially happy in his remarks which dealt with the rela- tion of the college to the city. A unity of the great forces which con1pose the city he pointed

The Garnet n1ne went to New Brunswick on April 2gth and defeated the strong -Rutgers team by the score of 2 to s. Alpert pitched and prac- tically won his own gan1e hy a dean hon1e run. This is the second hon1e run the teatn has scored this season. The 'varsity defeatecl Colgate on the can1pus, the Friday following the Rutgers' game, one to nothing. The game was exciting throughout and was fea tu.red by fast fielding. However, the hit- ting was very light, both tean1s together scoring but five scattered hits. O'Keefe was invincib1e when tnen were on ha.ses. He tnacle two hits besides hitting an inl~eld liner which scored the w~nntng run.

MR.-SPEER MR.MOTT Speakers at the Northfield Conference NORTHFIELD DELEGATION LARGE. The prospects are bright for a large Union de- legation at N·orthfield. The attractions are cer- t~inly greater than ever before, and the nun1ber of Union 1nen who will take advantage of this opportunity for a superb vacation will probably be corresponding·ly larger. This year is the twenty-fifth anniversary of the establishn1ent of the confere11ce, and the speakers are to be es- pecially notable, the athletic program n1ore ela- borate; and the conf ere nee on the whole is to be n1ore f\Lttractive than ever. The following mert have signified their intention to go, if possible: Branson , Cavert, Duchscherer, Faust, Maxon, Potter, Randerson, Schern1erhorn, Shepard, Trtunbull, Walser, Webb, Dewey, Finley, Gard- ner, Gilbert, Girard, Eutchens, La Barron, Trem- per, Ewens, De La V ergne, Ennis and Folensbee. WEST POINT TAKES FAST GAME. The varsity went to W,est Roint last Wednes- . day and was defeated by the score of two to one. O'Keefe and Alpert w~re both on the sick list so Captain Dunn did- the box work and allowed but four scattered hits. The Garnet team was shut out until the eighth :nning \vhen N.atunann knocked out a home run far over the left fielder's head. Biche did the san1e stunt in the ninth inning, butt the <Umpire declared the hit a foul. After the game the ;\rmy captain apologized for the decision, but that die! not bring victory to the varsity. How- ever, the tean1 feels that, with good umpiring, the Garnet nine would have brought a victory l:on1e with it. Following is the summary of the gan1e: U~ION. r. h. po. a. e. 1\ . . h. po. a. e.

The fact remains, however, that there is no rule by which the future of a college student can he determined 011 the ground of whether he is a 'grind' or not. The man who gains scholastic honors has an advantage. over the one who does not. He may not n1.ake the most of it and the one who stands I:ow in his classes may overcome the handicap of the lack of it, but it is an advantage nev.erthele.ss. \That a matl is a 'grind' often shows that he has the courage and -p·e·rseverance to overcome a natural difficulty in learn- ing and they are qualities that will help to bring success in whatever he under- takes. \Anyway it is the principal business of the college student to apply hi1nself to his college work.\ That a man is a \grind' 1 DOES often show · Htha t he has ·the perseverance to overcon1e a na~ tural difficulty in learning,'' but more ·often the \grind\ is the tnan who can obtain high scholar- ship with less effort than the '\n01j~grin~l.\ It is not as a rul~, because a n1an enters too much into I athletics aud rother college activities that he is:··; . •• • . \'<t low in s~holarship-but rather it. is because of a' certain negligence on the part of the student, which, if corrected makes it possible for hin~ to participate in the activities and still to attain fuio-h • •• • • J b scholarship.

COLLEGE NOTES. \1\T ednesclay aft era oon the juniors defeated the seniors in a well-played game by the score of six to foHr. The Chi Psi and Psi Upsilon fraternities will hold dances in their chapter houses on Monday evening of next week. Eugene Fink, manager of the Musical clubs, entertained the organizations at the Delta Up- silon house last Friday evening. Dr. Richmond V1Ji11 speak at a tneeting of the New York Library Association Institute, held Friday evening, May 26, in the All Sairtts' Cathe- dral, Albany. On May 9 the sophotnore tennis teatn defeated the Schenectady high school by a score of 6-o. The sophon1ore tean1 was as follows: Mull, Dickinson, Frank and Davis. Mull is trying to arrange a schedule with high schools in this vicinity. In the first of the series of interclass games the freshn1en defeated the sophomores last Wed- nesday n1orning in a very one-sided game. At the end of four innings the score stood sixteen to two. IN THE SPHERE OF COLLEGES. The English department at Cornell will gtve ''Much Ado About Nothing\ this year. T'he Aeronautical ·club at M. I. T. is complet- ing a motor biplane and a new glider. The publication of a weekly paper was begun by the undergraduates at Smith on March r6. Minnesota and Purdue tied for the basketball championship of the middle west during the past season. One hundred and seventy-five students are tak- ing courses in journalism at the University of Wisconsin. Harvard and Yale hope to arrange a track meet with the combined teams of Oxford and Ca.tnbridge to be held in London during July. The Dartmouth tennis schedule includes a match with the Minnesota tean1, which will play several colleges in the east this year. The first free university in Germany will soon be established in Frankfort. It will comprise three departlnen ts-law, philosophy and tnedicine. M. I. T. has secure·d 700 acres of land on the shores of Gardner's Lake in East Machias, Me., as a site for the Summer School of the Institute. The Harvard Crimson has adopted a new sys- tetn of con1petition for positions on its editorial hoard, which is based entirely on editorial writ- 1ng. The men1 bers of Phi Beta Kappa among the Atnerican Rhodes Scholars who are now studying at Oxford, have organized a chapter of the hon- orary society there. Statistics which have been compiled at Prince- ton show that the average scholastic ranking of the \P\ men is practically equal to the average rank of the whole undergraduate body. The University of Chicago is discussing the adoption of the honor systetn. No provision for the enforcement of the system is included 1n the petition that is being circulated; the student is to be placed entirely on his honor and if he does not live up to his agreetnent nothing will be said.

The vnse have oft proclaimed the influence of environ1nent upon the destinies of n1an. ''One cannot long associate with thieves,\ they say, .. without succwnbing to the temptation of theft, nor with the vicious without becotning addicted to \'ice.\ /\ncl such I find to be the case; for al- ready tl1at cloak of elegant phrases, which Pro- fe~sor Hale aptly terms \Addison's wonderful ce>mm2nd of the English tongue,\ which formerly ga.rbed the unseen1ly bareness of my ideas, has fallen fron1 rny vvritings and I have gradually as- sun1ed the lucid and startling dialect of young An1erica. Indeed, the potnp and splendor of my forr:ner vocabulary presents, just at this moment, a rather jarring incongruity with the gentle . refrain, \The Grizzly Bear,\ which a 'gentleman frorn Verona,' n1ore rmnan tic than cleanly, is grinding out outside tny window. Surely, I have l)een more or less mediaeval hitherto. I must keep pace with Father Titne. So I will n1ake no further pretence of erudition. Moreover, I do this g la d.ly for I have long been in deadly tenor lest my guise be penetrated by 'the piercing glance Photographer\ WHITE, 229 State Street Near :Barney's t 1 .ress and manner, they were.. I have since v,eri tied this fact by considerable observation. It is true; they are alike, just alike; two auburn heads beautifully matching two scarlet ties, two azv.re-eyed, sun kissed countenances, two broad- shouldered, slim-wasted figures clad in somber ( ?) green, two pairs of verigated socks putting the whole, rare color-schetne on a sound footing. I can imagine circumstances in which being twins would have its advantages. For instance, when the girl-of-yesterday altruistically telis the- only-girl-in-the-world that she saw you flirting with Blackie's cashier, how simple to relieve the situatiop by a confidetHial wink and a \Bedatn's a bit wild, you know, I can't do anything with hin1.\ Or brother, Adam, n1ight tnake chapel for bC?th if he's religiously inclined while Bedam, be- ing of literary bent, writes and delivers two ora- tions. However, before encot:rag-mg any of you to becom.e twins, I tnust in honesty adtnit that there are disadvantages to such a predicatnent. I tnust confess that I should hate to risk having even my brains (did the faculty but know the writer!) divided between two of me. Perhaps they would of certain literary critics on the engineering not work as coherently when separated. Per- faculty. Having turned to toss a quarter (n1y last, by the way) out of the window in order that the tnusician might cease to interrupt tbe muse, I noted, with sotne amusement, his monkey; and my thoughts were logically and naturally turned to the subject of twins. There are a 1nunber of twins in the world; but none, I believe, can compare in uniqueness with those celebrated McMann brothers, Adam and Bedan1. I chanced to n1eet this pair on the campus last week and I was profoundly itnpressed that there could exist two of such a type in one untverse so divine of face and figure, so noble of hearing, and so thoroughly collegian tn haps I would never outgrow dressing just like brother. Perhaps it would break n1y heart not to sit beside my other self in classes. Perhaps so, but it rather seems to tne that I'd l~ose most of the conceit with which I atn now burdened if I had to see just what I looked like and acted like, all the ti1ne. It n1ight even (\naturally I hear you say) drive tne insane. However, I can- not help believing that I would have just enough sense left to either decoy orother out on the Mo- hawk bridge son1e dark night and push him off, or else make an extended visit to the lower side of our glabe to settle down in some lonely spot on the banks of the Hoang-ho where I could go without scarlet ties and orange socks all the rest of my life. I might, who can tell? 5( t ,_..._ 1- ~ f. ~ I f . S< ··H ' f .(:.· . ·~, ... •) ,,., ~ i . '\· ·: •. :·i fo: 21 r ~ ·. ·~·. -.•,' ,, . ... ..

T-HE CONCORDIENSIS VOL. 34 MAY 30, 1911 NO. 26 UNION DEFEATS ROCHESTER NINE IN INTERESTING GAME ON CA'MPUS Shaw to Fairbairn to Bische Was the Com- bination That Made Three Double Plays ......... Roche~.ter Also Made 'One. The winning of the baseball game Saturday was not a co1nplete surprise to Union supporters, alt~ongh it is the first time in some years that the Garnet nine has beaten Rochester in the spring sport. Union was picked to win in spite of .the fact that Colgate, who had taken a gatne fron1 Pnion, l:;ad heen defeated by then1 earlier in the season. The fact that Hamilton had easily \·Von from Rochester the day before, cons,ider- ahly raised the \local hopes,\ inastnuch as Union defeated Hamilton by a large score this season. The gan1e was witnessed by a fair-sized crowd, cmnposed of a1umni and townspeople, and every student, as far as could he judged, was on the hleachers with his lungs in excellent yelling con- dition. O'Ket'fe was in the box for Union and <lid his usual stunt by holding his opponents dovvn to three hits. The feature of the gatne was the fast playing of \Tommy'' Fairbairn, Shaw and Bische. This co1nbination accomplished the unusual feat of tnaking ttree double plays during the gan1e. Roc~1ester also n1ade a double play. Dennis, the speedy :leftfielder, made a sensa- tional catch in which he ran for what looked like a sure hit and managed to scoop it up fron1 the ground just before it struck. He made a fine recovery with the hall safely in his hand. Don Hutc~1ens had his characteristic nerve with him behind the bat and received Dan's speediest with perfect ease. :Mackey had his throw frotn third to first under perfect control. Captain Dunn pulled down two hot ones in center field, and ~amnail did creditable in right field. Rochester had first bat and were quickly re- tired. Union squeezed in a run in this inning when Brown, Rochester's catcher, let a ball get by him with a Union tnan on third. There were few critical tnoments when Union was in the field and these were safely bridged and crossed hy Dan's consistent work. In the second inning LTnion failed to cross the platter, but pulled in two runs in the third. The fourth again failed to show a score, hut twins were the result of the fifth tnntng. This ended the sconng the ga1ne. The sun1mary of the game follows: ROCHESTER. A.B. R. H. 0. C!ancy, c. f. -------------- 4 0 0 I Ecl.\\t·ard s, 3h. ------------- 3 0 I I w. R.

These are conditions that should not exist. The weekly n1eeting is tll.e one tin1e when the students come together as a body, and it is the only and. best means of keeping the college spirit up to the stcnHlard, which has .always been c ]aracteristic of Union. It is true that n1any of the n1eetings are Gf rather long duration and the tin1€ for hokling th en:r is such that a lengthy dis- cussion encroaches tq,on the lunch hour.

To have us both enjoy an afternoon of the sport it m.eans a dol- lar expense under your present charge of ad- nlission. I know of no other .of the stnaHer col- leges that has such a high admission price and feel sure that you are injuring- yourself by put- ting an ah11ost prohibitive price on the baseball . . ganTes. Many of the office mea have spoken about this and have said that they would enjoy seeing the gan1es on the can1.pus, hut they think tl:-:a t fifty cents is too rnuch to pay. As I am not a Union graduate I hesitate a little to be so bold as to write this letter to you. However, I feel sure if you knew the ideas of tna ny of the General Electric n1en on the sub- ject you would seriously consider putting the price of achnission at twenty-five cents, which was the price two or three years ago, I believe. In publishing this letter will you kindly not use tny natne? Very truly yours, ---------------------- HOW THE FACULTY WILL SPEND THE SUMMER MONTHS.

I() THE CONCORDIENSIS. IDEAL VACATION AT NORTHFIEL.D WHERE SOME TWENTY UNION MEN Will Represent Their Alma Mater in Athletics and Participate in Great Student Conference. On June twenty-third ahout twenty Union men will start for North field, the place of the hitercol- le_giate student, conference. For the past several years Union has heen represented at Northfield, bqt_ th~s year it is planned to increase the size of the delegation in order that 1nore nen may he enabled to take advantage of this opportunity. The conference co1nbines a vigorous athletic two w.eeks' vacation in .the co:mpany of th..e finest n1en of all the eastern colleges with. an op- portunity to see what religion tneans to such a group of n1en, and to get yourself into the spirit of a n1..anly christianity. The speakers at the .conference include the . leaders in r~ligious activity in the whole country, every one of thetn well worth hearing. They are n1en who are crowding the churches of our large cities e:very Sunday, and they ha-ve some- thing to say which is sure to n1ake a man's life count fo~ n1ore. They include Mr. John R. Mott, Mr. Robert E. ··Speer, Rev, Henry Sloan Coffin, _ Bishop A. S. Lloyd, Prof. Harlan P. Beach, Prof. Philip M. Rhinelander, Rev. Satn Higginbottom, Rev. Harry En1erson Fosdick, Rev. Artley E. Parson, Rev. H. Roswell Bates, Prof. J. L. Gil- niore, Mr. Clayton S. Cooper and Mr. E. C. Carter. I_n the afternoon no religious services are held, and the \studes\ devote thetnselves exclusively to athletics. Each delegation has a baseball tean1 which enters the seri~s and a tennis tour natnent for a hands0111e cup takes place on the spacious courts of the conference-, w-hile the Connecticut river affords an1ple opportunity for boating, fish- ing and bathing, a large float being provided for the purpose. ?\ear the ·close of the conference an intercollegiate track tneet and field day is held, and in the evening· a general celebration which - is alone worth go-ing to see. The Union delegation will can1p in tents in a fragrant pine grove overlooking the Co11necticut river. All the college m·en eat together in the large dining hall, which resounds with college yells during- meal tin1es. o ·The total expense of the conference is twenty . doUars, including ·carfare, and with such facilities for a sup·erb vaca f,ion, the return from the 1noney invested wili be ten-fold. lJNlO:N ~'ELEBRATES HER ONE HUN- DRED FIFTEENTH COMMENCEMENT.

This tnonth a sin1ilar appeal was sent to our alutnni engaged in secondary school work. We invited thetn to return for a conference on mat- ters of n1utual interest and provided a day's en- tertainment which was planned to be of profes- sional value as well as general pleasure. Invita-· tions were sent to I r6 alumni and the following _ progran1 was inclosed: Progra,m. ro :45-Address by Arthur B. Brubacher, Ph.

This letter was followed by a second urging their attendance and finally a third letter, con- taining a list of three questions bearing on the question of securing their co-operation, was sent out. The second letter was not sent to those 1nen who lived too far off to justify their at- tendance, so w·hile the figures given will not ex- actly state the an1otm t of interest indicated by this test, they serve for a general statetnent. Alt.1n1ni invited ---------------- I 16 Alumni attending -------------- 20 Alutnni ·answering ------------- 57 Per cent. of interest shown_____ 49 Those tnen who answered were enthusiastic and it seems fair to assume that they are all willing to lend their aid to the progress of the college. The n1en trav,elling_ the greatest distance to at- tend this meeting were frotn the very recent classes, but there were several superintendents of schools among. those present and .other older g~rad ua tes. The amount of assistance the teacher can give the college is very great. If the council can bring hin1 to a definite support of Union it. will have justified its existence. Our aitn is to have every alun1nus do his share to bring the college prosperity and fan1e.
