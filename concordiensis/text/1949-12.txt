Compulsory Chapel The administration has taken no action on the l\Ionday chapel program. They are waiting to see what the_C~:mcordy does. We are asking for your support. One act1v1ty can- not get results by itself. It needs the support of _o~her groups, of other leaders. We a!·e asking you ~o start petJtwns and present th~m to the dean tf you agree w1th us that com- pulsory chapel should be abolished. We are not opposed to chapel. We are opposed to com- pulsory chapel. Compulso_Q: chaJ?el attendanc~ and the ~e­ mocracy which the admm1strat1on often pomts to with pride as existing on campus do not go tog·ether. _Where one exists the other cannot. There is a slight paradox here. Whereas tl~e admini~­ tration is willing to let the students be democratiC where 1t doesn't count, in physically runnmg activities, they are con- stantly on the alert against any efforts on the pa~t of stu- dents to be intellectually and culturally democratic. They feel it is necessary to milk-feed culture to us so that our thought will be directed in the right directions. \Culture\ How far does the duty of the administration extend? Does it extend so far that they must force \culture\ on a srudent body which is indifferent or which wants to p~rs~e its own interests'? Does it extend to an attempt to mstlll \spirit\ into an apathetic student body by artificial means? We do not think so. Culture, expose the Loys to culture, says the administra- tion, and they are bound to benefit to some smal_l degree. We ask is it better to have five hundred people m chapel who we~e forced to go, who spend the period reading, eating lunch, sleeping, and doing everything except paying atten- tion to the program, than to have twenty ~en m chapel who go voluntarily and listen because they are mtereste~? Just think, if chapel were voluntary th~ peopl~ arrangmg pro- grams might even be moved to get mterestmg programs. As for \spirit real spirit can come only through a de- sire on the part of those concerned to create it. It cannot be squeezed out of a dry stone by outside pressure. Whereas the administration seems interested in phy- sically exposing the students to a certain minimum of cul- ture,. we favor setting up an atmosphere which will make the student receptive to the culture offered. Voluntary attend- ance would do this. As long as the administration has rec- ords to show that the students have attended chapel th~y are satisfied. Whether the time spent is profitable or not does not seem to enter in. Next week we will expose the case of a student who bucked the administration policy regarding chapel and was graduated despite his refusal to go to chapel. Meanwhile, if you agree with us on compulsory: chapel, get the petitions in to the dean. PLACEMENT NEWS The Naval Ordnance Laba.ratory@> of White ?ak, Md., will have a Psy. lab., Mr. W. V.

The next step was the abolishment .of credit for Sunday chapel, a direct response to student pressur.e. T·he most recent. move was the 'reduction of the point requirement ferom 40 to 30 pomts, under the pathetically weak pretense of compensating for chapels missed .by students taking noon hour examinations. NaturaUy it is hard for the trustees and administration to a~m~t point blank that compulsory chapel is a remnant of the useless. dism- plinll of a bygone age. We students can help them save face '?Y ~d­ mitting to them that we won't object in the least to accel~ratu;m of trend toward abolishment of compulsory chapel. THERE ARE THREE ways of expressing student .disagreement with chapel: an intellectual discussion between students ;;t.nd adminis- tration members, with delayed results; orderly .presentation of student in the form of petitions or polls; and a downright strike against chapel.

My sudden change of heart came about on Thursday morning, in the middle of one of Carl Niemeyer's lectures. I was supposeci.to write my column at 10 o'clock. At 9:30 I was listening to Dr. Niemeyer, thinking about the column, and sketching weird symbols in my note- book. Then Carl said something which made me forget chapel, the rest of the lectul'e, and all my lovely symbols, which I later discovered were obviously phallic anyhow. NIEMEYEI{. was talking about Dada, and the cult of screwball artists in Europe in the Twenties who revolted ag~inst all structure and meaning in art, in an effort to assert their individuality and per- sonal freedom. Immediately, I began to compare myself, and all the rest of ·the campus clowns with their high ideals about freedom,· with the Dada jokers. Then I thought of guys like Dos Passos' John Andrews, or Wolfe's Eugene Gant, and those many other characters in modern fiction who represent the oppressed, misunderstood artist fighting his battle against the restrictions of modern social systems. And then it dawned on me- with a little more help from Niemeyer. \While a writer like Thomas Mann, for example, can say in his novels that the artist cannot exist toda:f because he has no freedom, .Mann himself, nevertheless, has man- aged to make a few personal compromises and seems to get along just dandy. ..,. THE ANSWER, obviously, isn't for the discontent artist to throw up his hands and discard all order, in efforts to achieve his freedom, but to find an even greater freedom-that of indifference. He's got to learn to make the most of a lousy and often stupid situation by getting beyond it intellectually. It's the same with chapel. We've all got to take a certain amount of guff; so, what _the devil. Instead of exerting our pseudo-freedom: by ·raising a stink, why not look for some real \freedom\ by putting ourselves above the pettiness and becoming completely indifferent. If the college wants chapel, buy a good novel, take it with you, and you can probably finish it easily while you're getting yQur 3(} credits. Or, better yet, take a 20-minute snooze for 30 days, ;;md the hell with it all. -==:.;;if For Car Troubles See a Union Man \t'Villiam H. Plath Auto Service 601 UNION STREET ...

All other entrants received 40 has had the satisfaction of seeing each of his teams Improve upon the record of its predecessor. The 1946-47 squad posted a 1-4 mark. The followmg year saw a 4-5 rec0rd and last year's team went over the .500 mark with a 5-4 record. Last year's squad was the third win- ning team in the 28 year history of swimming at Union, and the only squad to win five meets. ONLY FOUR men, Harry Kuni- holm, Heinz Staedule, Gene Ben- man, and Herman Haus have been lost. Returning to the fold are nine veterans from last year, including four individual record holders, and seven outstanding sopho•mores up from the freshman squad. Leading the mermen this year will be record holders Joe Tafel, breaststroker who broke his own record three times last season, free style experts Jim Cauter and Dan Mead, and diver Dick Johnson Other outstanding veterans return- ing are Mike Sarna!, leading sprint- er last year, Bob Diam.cond, John Berbert, John Isbister, team high scorer last Sharadin. season, and Paul In a practice meet held recently with Amherst College, the Dutch- men swam well, but in the opinion of Mullane can do a lot better. Though no official score was kept, the competition was very close. THE THREE new oppD·nents added to the slate this year, McGill University, Boston University, and the U. of Mass., will make the sea- son more difficult for the mermen. McGill of Montreal, which will play host to the Dutchmen a week from tomorrow, is the strongest adver- sary on the slate, being Canadian champicons. RPI rates a strong sec- ond to McG1ll. Back on the schedule this year are Hamilton, Rochester, and Ford- ham. Mullane's protegees last sea- son beat Brooklyn Poly, 54-24, split with Rochester, dumped Hamilton twice, and toppled Fordham.

It was feared that Carter David- son, president of the college, had usurped the authority of the faculty council 'by granting credit without consulting the council. One deleted paragraph, aimed at clearing Davidson of these suspicions, quoted a se<:tion of the contract between the college and the air force which granted academic credit pending faculty council appl'Ova'l (the condition having been inserted ·by David- son in accordance with the juris- diction of the council over suc·h matters.)

New· Frosh Dorm to Be Constructed This Spring Construction of a new freshman dormitory and student union, the latter containing dining, lounge, and recreation facilities, will begin in the Union College pasture between the Terrace wall and Seward place next spring, Dr. Carter Davidson, president of the college, announced today. It is hoped that the building will be ready for occupancy by next fall, Dr. Davidson said. Research Increases ~ The building will replace the wa1· emergency dorms now located in the pasture, and in it will be housed all members of succeeding freshman classes. They are now housed in the emergency dorms and in North and South College.

THE ~IG student complaint seems to concern the slow service during rush hours. but, according to the management, a sales engi- ii'eer has been working, on the problem and service should be speeded up as the employees adjust themselves to the facllities. Dancing will not be possible in the- near future, according to Thomas Elliott, general manager, since the installation of a julie box for dancing will necessitate the charging of a twenty percent cabaret tax, which would be un- fair to most of the students who do not bring dates to the raths- keller. THE COLLEGE will not allow women, other than staff members and student wives, in the 'skeller unless chaperones are present. Wil- ford H. Ketz, coordinator of stu- dent activities, will have chai·ge of the selection of chaperones which, according to Dean C. Wil- liam Huntley, must be paid hostesses, faculty members and/or wives, alumni and wives, women staff members or married students and wives. The rathslteller is trying to ob· tain voluntary chaperones feor the time being, as it is doubtful whether people will be hired. for a while. If the rathskeller cannot provide hostesses evry night, a schedule of \date\ nights will be presented to the student body soon. --'--0--- Plans Progressing Arrangement for the Mid-Winter Prom, to be held on Feb. 17, are now being made and a bi'Ochure is being prepared to be sent to approximaely 1000 schools through- out the country in the hope of creating interest in holding dances for charity causes. Those inter- ested in the Mid-Winter Prom, the proceeds of which will be re- mitted to the Damon Runyon Me- morial Cancer fund, hope that this broch11re will cause Union's ex- ample to be followed by similar af- fairs at other colleges. DURING the dance a cup will be awarded t othe fraternity house ,.which presents the best novelty dance. Bands are now being con- tacted, and work on decorations and other arrangements is being carried out. William VanOst and Harry Petrack are co-chairmen of the Prom Committee. Jack Fischel is in charge of publicity; Art Kean, decorations; William Herrmann, of life in Budapest told in a pro- logue and seven scenes, and is con- ~idereu by many to be one of the finer·things in the modern theater. It has been successfully produced on the continent, in England, and twice on Broadway, and the musi- cal version of it, \Carousel was an outstanding hit a few seasons ago. The play, a fantasy, tells the story of a shiftless young ne'er-do- well and bully of Budapest, who works as a barker for a carousel. He is somewhat of a rogue, and many servant girls fall victim to his charms. Among these is Julie, with whom he falls in love and marries. Learning that he is about to become a father, Liliom becomes associated with Ficsur, a local scroundel. From this ac- quaintanceship the pint of the play develops. A GREAT deal of emphasis in this show has been placed on scenery, with five complete set changes included in the production. Walter Rockwell designed the scenery and was in charge of the paint crew. The technical effects are among the most extensive ever used by the Mountebanks, despite the limited equipment on hand. Leslie Couch and Robert Strand headed the technical crew and sur- mounted untold difficulties in the construction of the sets. Some of the firsts to be used in this show are a cyclorama, a translucent drop, several cut-out drops, and a box teaser. Cast in the title role is Mitcnell Rabbino, who is participating in his third year of Mountebanll:s pro- ductions. Rabbino, a senior from ~t. Vernon, N. Y., was the ex- change scholar to St. Andrews last year. THE PART of Julie is played by Miss Shirley Neary of Schenec- tady. While at Syracuse univer- stiy, Miss Neary acted in \Re- becca,\ \My Sister Eileen,\ and \The Little Foxes,\ and has also been heard on both local radio stations. Miss Louise Woodruff of Sche- nectady takes the part of Mrs. Muskat, the owner of the carousel at which Li!iom works. Miss Woodruff, who may be remem- bered as Peggy in last year's Mountebanks production of \The Front Page,·• has worked with the Schenectady Civic Players for sev- eral years in such plays at \Blithe Spirit\ and \Dream Girl.\ RICHARD HEIMANN, a fresh- man, makes his first appearance on any stage in the role of Ficsur. )111iss Janet Koehler, a student at Nott Terrace high schooi, portrays Llliom'f< daughter, Louise, Miss Judith Greenberg of Mont Pleasant plays Julie's friend, Marie, .and Miss Marietta Jacobson is Mrs. Hollunder, Julie's aunt.

Chapel Precedent Here is a sto1·y to illustrate the change in the administration's attitude toward compulsory chapel. Weeks Washing by Byron 1 FRIDAY, OEC~MBER 9, 1'949' THE BEST lS SilENCE 'By DAVE MARKSON I have never met Helmer Webb, captain of that hor.rible mon- strosity in the center of our lovely campus, nor, have ~ ever had any- thing to do with the gentleman. Nevertheless, I m a.J;ratd I have to say that i don't .Jike him at all. - . . . I don't want to be petty, either, but my main reason fo; d1shkmg him is because of that aromatic pipe of his. When he fhts around sucking on that damned thing all day, while I have to duck out into the cold hall for a drag on a weed, I get -pretty sore. . . BUT BESIDES that, all Mr. Webb ever seems to do, ))esides refill that pipe or talk at the top of his voice, is to hammer nails or re- arrange pictures. Now I don't ask the man to alte~ the shape -of that wretched .building of his, which he could best do w1th a slug of TNT,. but the least he can do is change its internal conditions so that a .guy doesn't go \Qatty when he's foi·ced to make use of the joint. ? \-but don't you see; this is om· third undefeated season in sixty-thxee yeax·s and if we set a precedent now by giving awards, we won't be able to follow tip for futm·e teams on our small budget.\ First off, for example, why doesn't Mr. Webb bu~ some bo.oks. They do belong ·in .Jibrari'es, you know; but Mr. Webb, tt ,appears, has different ideas. · TAKE THE NOVEL as an illustration. I've been Jed to believe The Book Shelf it's a literary form that's here to say. Yet go 'looking. for ·one in Mr. Webb's stacks. If it's the least bit obscure, unusual or ·filthy, Mr. Webb either hasn't bought it, has locked it up, or has let some faculty mem- ber keep it indefinitely. THE- MAGIC CLOAK By James Cla-rlt Moloney, M.D. Review~>d by Prof. Clare Graves The best way to insure world health, at least for the world of tomorrow, is to start now with the cradle, the newborn babe-and to keep him well.

According to Bill, reached last night in California, his failure to attend chapel was purely a protest move, and was so recognized by both Dean Huntley and Presi- dent Davidson. MAN IS UNABLE to see through his own camouflage. The real self of the child that might develop into the real self of adulthood is forced into hiding by the demand- ing woPld in which the child lives. Since his real self which would do his own acting, think his own thoughts, and live his own life is smothered by the demands of too early and too rigid acculturation, the child learns that he too will ·come out on top if he threatens. language that wil~ drive many from it, were it not that his argu- ments are tediously presented and his conclusions laboriously arrived at, it might create quite a furore! That many will criticize his an- alyses is certainly true for he does not hesitate to <tread on the toes of vested interests. A few of these analyses presented below best rep- resent his thoughts and his book: Editor Dear Sir: Why doesn't the administration have some of the minor product of the heating plant, ashes, spread on the various footpaths? The argu- ment about expenses, which they used in the case of the proposed steps for upp~rclass walk, does not hold here; the ashes cost nothing, the labor is small, and the probability of injury from a fall on slippery walks is large. In regard to the ex:pense of installing steps on upper- class walk, what price does the administration set on the sufferings .of the possible victims of falls there? Bill was not exempted from chapel as an eig·hth term senior. When questioned by Huntley as to possible misunderstanding· of the rule exempting certain eighth tenn seniors, Bill refused the implied loophole, stating that he fully understood that he was required to attend chapel. Whan Davidson was consulted, he lost little time in making a decision. He said, according to Bill, \I guess we can overlook it.\ Bill was graduated with his class a week later. A precedent has been set, further evidence that compulsory chapel is on the·way out. The administration knows it. So do the students, if there is any sig-nificance in the hundreds of names already on student petitions calJing for an end to chapel points. \Culture\ A survey conducted by WRUC was not especially populax with revealed that the concensus of Union students, but that, given the opinion of those intet·viewed fav- opportunity, he waul& undoubtedly ored more comedy and drama, con- reciprocate the sentiment.

Our wilTing infot·mant told us of a plot to be pet·pctratcd on the unlmowing studentry and their guests, in the interests of furthAr- ing the financial aims of -a c£'l'tain small group on campus. After the buildup, we were frankly a \\'ee bit curiou:;, and we pt·ubed deeper. \Ve learned that the Block \U\ so- ciety, of all things, was hatching a plan to put the gym drinking fountain out of ot·der, so that the coke sales at the basketball games would be increased. The Bloc!\ \U'' society has the coke and food concessions at all home games. WE SNIFFED amund campus for a couple of days, just to see what was in the ·wind, aside from snow. and found nothing.

Assured that the plumbing hnd not been sabotaged, vee went io the other end of the floor and talked to the hoys dispensing the coke. \iiJhen asked about the rumored plot, one of the Block \U\ mem- bers remarked that they had been thinking about pulling the foun- tain out entirely. \Heck the darn thing's no good at all,\ he said.

Men who do not dress for dinner will not be served. THE DEAN does not feel that this is an excessive requirem~nt for students dining in Hale house as most fraternities re- quire similar dress f<Jr dinner. Dean Huntley noted that dress- ing for dinner is a. part of co-1- lege tradition and that it is about time that Union went off its wartime basis and became \collegiate\ again. It is felt that dressing this way for dinner does add to the atmosphere and general pleas- antness of the meal. Union Col- lege is planning to remove the mess hall and have students take meals in the dining hall again as soon as is possible. It is hoped that the proposed freshman dorm will make this possible.

Star of Faith Star shining on the desert Three men, sweaty, with eager eye Camels The stable, moist with dung Baby Jesus Star of faith Cynics claim the story of Jesus Christ's nativity has been enfabled over the centuries. They can't be proved wrono-. Every year that separates us from the event gives rise t~ new doubters who can pvove logically that the miracu- lous events surrounding the birth could not have happened. But one thing they can't dispute is the remarkable power this strange, humble man has held over people of all cen- turies since. This, too, would be incapable of logical analysis. Each year new eyes peer back through the darkness of time to capture the spirit of the stable. Their faith is stronger than the scorn of doubters, their faith in the babe Jesus, symbol of re-creation. · Campaign Lags The chapel petitions started out in a blaze of activity and have petere·d out since the first three days. There are only· a few hundred signatures on them, certainly not a majority of the student body which we expected to get. When the campaign started we thought that we were following the dictates of the majority of students; apparently we were wrong. Never in the history of the college has there been such a welter of objective thinking as took place after action had been initiated. Whereas a great number of intel- lectual devils took great glee in attacking chapel, when it came down to their following om· lead with action, most of them shied into a little corner to think to issue out. We are sorry that student sentiment is so seasonal, but would not trade the experience of seeing these young radicals repelled by action for anything. Any further moves on chapel must come from you, student body. We, however, are still ,opposed· to compulsory chapel. No Lifting, Please! Hale house lounge has been missing an increasing num- ber of magazines the past few months. They are small ones usually, of the Time, New Yorker type. Do you students who have been taking them know that you are perfectly welcome to take them to your rooms if you sign for them? · Let's hope that this knowledge will take the kick out of your pilfering so that other students will have a chance to enjoy reading them in the lounge where they belong. The Reader Writes Dear Sir: There is absolutely no excuse for the unwarranted attack on Hel- mer Webb which appeared in the Dec. 9th edition of· the Concordiensis. If Mr. Markson thinks he is being clever or witty, he is sadly mistaken. I think his article showed very poor taste. As· Markson apparently has exhausted his ideas for a column to such an extent that he has to lower himself to vilification, \The Rest SHOULD Be Silence.\ Yours truly, PAUL WOODS, '52 Weeks Washing by Byron Letters to the Editor Mr. James Murray, Editor Dear Jim: THE RULE WHICH has governed my tenu!'e as adviser to the Concordy has been that I put in my two cents worth when the -staff asks for it and not before. From your gang's viewpoint, that's good; according to some of the school-masters on board, it's bad. Since I do have other things to occupy my time, it ordinarily works out well for me. For once, however, I'm going to break the rule; I'm sounding off without an invitation. Dave Markson's precociously adolescent piece about Helmer Webb last week really got my back up-not so ·much at Markson, as at you. As I g-et Markson, he's deep in the literary flutter-bug phase during which, by the approved formula, one gets to be god-awfully clever by by taking a very dim view indeed of everything-especially everybody- from the splendid, harrowed isolation of a private world. If they're good-and Markson is good-such characters can be very entertaining. But when you let them loose in the only newspaper in the community- which has a pretty vital social function to perform-they've jolly well got to be edited if you don't want them to malte some extremely impolite noises in public. The thing that irritates me most about the Markson-Webb incident is to see you-who, I think, have improved the Concordy more than any editor in the last 10 years-sucked, by some rather vacous abstractio:p.s about \free speech,\ into an act of ir- responsible journalism. THE FALSENESS of the abstractions, of course, is that, in the real world, the area of \free speech\ which holds in a responsible news- paper is tightly hemmed in by official and semi-official restraints. \Free speech\ doesn't mean license or libel, slander or bad taste so patiently lousy that it loses the public support necessary for survival. A college newspaper operates in an unrealistically loose environment. There are no effective libel laws; the administration normally is cowed by the free speech abstractions; the status and income of the .s,lleet is legally assured; and the personnel of the community are transients- if they create a mess they only have to live with it for another year or two. By these tokens, a college paper is a bad training ground for budding journalists unless its editor fills up the gaps, and, by the same tokens, he needs a more acute sense of social responsi-bility than his real world contemporaries. What seems to me inexcusable in the Markson piece is not, cer- tainly, that he attacks a campus institution or the way it's run. For my money, you should be free to run your anti-chapel-or, if you want, anti-library-campaigns without any inhibitions except those of taste. But Markson's piece- smells when it lashes into a personality. And- this amendment is important-without any conceivable constructive purpose. There have been occasions at Union where student publica- tions have set out on a systematic campaign to \get\ a man. It's a very nasty business, but there are instances, I suppose, where such tactics may seem the only ones available and may even qualify as deliberate, responsible action. But surely there was no such object here. I can't believe that anybody on the staff can believe that Helmer Webb as a person is a \problem\ of that magnitude, or that there is the slightest chance of unseating him by student agitation. THE ONLY RESULT, then, is a thoroughly destructive one. Did Markson-or, mote important, did you-stop to think how it makes a ~uy's insides grind around to read something like that about himself? Does it make a better librarian out of him? Not unless he is a mouse, it doesn't, and I can assure you that Helmer Webb's no mouse. I happen to believe myself that the content of the attack was mistaken, the argument poor, and the factual re~~arch behind them abysmal. But that's not what I'm concerned w1th here. It's the vehicle which bothers me. Please understand that this letter is written at my own instigation and direction. And, if you are willing, it might be a good idea to publish it.

DECEMBER- 16, 1949 THE REST IS SILENCE By DAVE MARKSON To Mr. Hel:iner Webb Union College Library Dear Mr. Webb: EDITOR JIM: MURRAY has been good enough to give me free reign in my column in the Concordie~sis thr.oughout the term._ In Iast week's issue I took advantage of this confidence. I .not only abused the privileg~ of .free speech, but also went overboard i~ a display of flagrant bad taste. . . My article dealing with you and the Umon college library never should have been written. It serves as a flagrant example of the work of a hot-shot kid, annoyed by a few slight irrita~ions which. he does not understand, exaggerating then and attackmg _somethmg which does not need to ·be criticized at all-and, also makmg a fool of himself in the process. When :t wrote the piece, I was in complete ignorance about the situation in the library. It followed, therefore, that almost 8!11 Cilf the faults I found with the system. turned out to be nonexistent. Those few criticisms which might l;>e valid are so only because certain conditions make them unavoidable. . SIMILARLY, therefore, my criticism of you had no basis. In de- ciding: to discuss the library, I decided to do so through th~ medium of your name, which, in a sen15e is synonymous with the library on the campus. I criticized you only ·because, as a writer, I needed a \point of view,\ or what might -be called an \angle and happened to choose you. In so doing, I had no intention to condemn you, either as an individual or in your work. I also regret any personal criticisms of your staff. . . I did not realize that the article, which I believed to be innocuous in nature, would be construed as any sort of personal condemnation. I say this in all seriousness, and admit in logical sequence that the fault must lie as much with my inability to wdte good satire as it does with my poor taste. I AM EXTREMELY SORRY that, in my unthinking manper, I have offended you as I have. I -realize that an apology means very little. Nevertheless, I offer mine here, as sincerely and honestly as possible, in the hope that you will believe mee and accept it. And from what I have gotten to know of you in the past few days-and this makes me feel like an even bigger heei'-I believe I can hope with a good deal of assurance that you will. Very sincerely yours, DAVE MARKSON CRUMBS ALONG THE MOHAWK By George T. Orick As it must to all groups, dissention last week came to the student rathskeller. In short, two or three members of the 10-man executive committee would like to uproot Tom Elliott, general manager. Before the sour-grapes movement gets underway, let's go .over a few facts about Elliott. Tom was pushing for a rathskeller way back when few student11 knew there was a possibility for such a place on campus. He sta11ted agitating a few hours after Helmer Webb argued in favor of a raths- keller at a Tippecanoe meeting. Elliott has worked like hell, stirring up student sentiment for the prQject,_ bullying friends and others into working, getting publil:lity, raising funds and making contacts. Now some of the band-wagon-jumper-onners, who have done plenty of work themselves, in some case::;, want Tom's job, or if not that, at least most of the authority connected with his job. There's something about the rathskeller which brings out something O!l' other in people, even though only soft drinks and frosts have been sold there since the student eatery's opening two weeks ago. For example, so it is said, when Chaplain BI\Own made his first visit to the place last week, his right foot reached without results for some sort of support at the base of the soda counter. A couple of student-taxpaying students have wondered why the total seating capacity at Mountebanks performances is smaller than the total number of students attending Union. The theory seems to be that, should all the students decide to see a Mountebanks play insuf- ficient seats would be available. · ' In fact, the complainers are correct, for there are 1025 seats ·avail- able for the CUI'rent production, \Liliom while there is a student body of over 1300. Armed with these facts, I had a talk witl:i Donald Jones director of the Mountebanks, Aside from being pleased with comme~ts, good or ba~, 17bout th~ Mountebanks, he expressed, as only he can, an almost f?-nabc mtere~t m accommodating all who wished to see his produc- tions, by God. He swore he would make every effort to 'COntinue ·any pla:y- as long as there ~e sufficient students who want to see it. So there. ~d while we're canside1•ing the Mountebanks, I wonder if the Bill Van Ost whom I saw participating in the by no means profaneless Mountebanks chapel program last Monday is the same Bl,ll Van Ost who not so long ago was horrified by the alleged lack of taste of the Burner-Leason-Keitn chapel prqgr.ain.

4 BENCH BLISTERS .=BY JIM ElliNGER- coach Nels Nitchman, an old timer as far as Union College ath- letics is concerned, has quite a knack for telling stories. While talking over old times with Hal Wittner las week, the subject some- how or another got around to Fred Wyatt. \I REMEMBER a story about F1~eddy,\ Nitchman suddenly re- marked· laughingly. \It seems that several years ago Union and Amherst were playing a nip and tuck basketball game. The score had .been tied continuously, and naturally through all this tur- moil Fred had gotten quite excited, and was letting people know who he was rooting for. In the last few seconds of the game, with the score tied :n~31, Union was awarded a foul shot. The shot, was made, pre- ceded and follcwed by several ver- bal outbursts from Fred, and Union won the game. As the spec- tators were filing out of the gym afterwards, one of the Amherst fans was heard remarking \rhey should have won, they had the wind on their side'.\ THIS STORY can be used to illustrate a point. If cheering is done in the right manner, it is a definite aid to the spirit of a team. There are two types of cheering, however. Some people root for their team and then there are those who do most of their cheer- ing against the referees in the form of insults and boos, and against the opposing team. Some of the attack on the offi- cials stems from the fact that many spectators don't understand that a foul may be committed whether it is intentional on the part of the player or whether it ~s unintentional. A good referee 1s not interested in whether a player intended to commit a foul or not. It .is his duty to call what he sees, and in most cases he is able to see much better than the specta- tor. Continual booing of the ;e- feree may upllet him to the pomt where he actually does call a 'few bad ones while previously h-e \had been doi~g a good job. When this happens, the home team certainly does not benefit by it. WE NOTICED much of this op- position type of cheering in the Williams game, despite the fact that the officials were doing an excellent job. We certainly hope that it will not continue on through the rest of the season. According to Mr. Wittner, who has the reputation as one of the best officials in this section of the country, the referees obtained for Union games are the most experi- enced and the best in this area. Why give Union a personality of its own among these top flight men who have been following the rule books for years?

B\lt during years of work on many varied lighting projects, Pipkin kept up the search for a still _better coating.

This new success of Marvin Pipkin has come only after thousands of ex- periments and years of investigation.

It Is Rumored By ROBERT NAVIAS For the past several weeks, pre- medical students have been bitterly complaining about what they termed a rank injustice to the pre- medical students of Union College. The complainers said that Albany Medical College had changed its policy, or something, and that this year it was taking only half the number of Union men that had been taken in years past. What the policy is, or when it was formed, no one seems to know. Dr. Allan C. Scott, acting head of the biology department, says he has heard nothing. of the matter, and Miss Mary Carroll, registrar of Al- bany Medical College said she would simply disregard the rumor. NOW ALL TmS is very inter- esting, because whether or not Al- bany Medical Scho<>l has cha.ilged a policy, it seems that just about this time last year, In the Dec. 18, 1948 issue of the Concordiensis, we reported t:hat the premedical seniors were all het-up about the possibility that their letters of recommendation might be late and nullify their chances of getting into medical school. At that time we thoroughly investigated the situation, and found nothing out of line. This year again, we have foun~ nothing to suggest that there is anything: amiss. It is our opinion that this is an- other case of what we call the December pre-med med s~hool jitters. It looks like the senior pre- meds get all worked .up about medical school at this time of year, and pick on the :first thing they find as an outlet. Hence the rumors and gripes. RUMOR HAD IT early this week that Dr. Harold A. Larrabee, chairman of the division of social studies; had been offerred the posi- tion of head ()f the Harvard phil- osophy department. But Dr. Lar- rabee, said, when interviewed by phone, that there was nothing to it at all and. that he had never heard a thing about it. He went on to say that such stol'ies are· often heard about professors on sabbati- cal leave. However, when a ·profes- sor takes sabbatical leave he agrees to teach for a year after his return. There is no advantage in looking for another JlOSition while on sabbatical leave, Larra- bee .said. LANGE & RAPP Pharmacy PRESCRIPTIONS \Service for the sick\ CHEMICALS - DRUGS • Cor.
