APRIL 3, 1912 No. 18 ANNUAL SNOWBALL SCRAP TAKES PLACE ON CAMPUS Freshmen Triumph Over Sophomores m :Hotly Cbn- tested Combat hy Score of 44-22 The SnowbaH Scrap has at last come off. After long discussion and varing stages of freezing and thaw, the weather man and the powers that be smiled upon us and the historic combat was held. The charge of the sophomores from the chapel windows and the throwing of combatants over the Terrace wall was stopped, in deference to someone's tender feelings and to the growing delicacy of the underclassmen, and instead a roped ring was formed from which the .corpses were thrown as the fight progressed. Still, even with all its distinctive features gone, it was a pretty good scrap. The sophomores and freshmen assembled at their respective meeting places at 12 o'clock, called the roll, and then marched to the foot-ball field, where the squared circle was ready. A blast from a whistle and instantly the air was filled with hard packed snow- balls. Thud! Crack! Bang! Ah, it was magnificent ! Superb! Titanic! In writing of an affair of this sort one natur.~Hy falls into the style of the French paragraph. Toot! went the whistle and hostilities dosed for a But soon a new form of battle began as each side strove to throw its opponents from the ring. 0, that scmeone could describe the Homeric battle that raged around the class presidents as they lay on the ground, hel-d down painfully but firmly by their faithful re- tainers! W auld that the bard of Chios might write it in rolling hexameter for the edification of the A. ·B. frosh. But finally the sophomore president went out with many of his devoted followers, leaving the fresh- men masters of the field by a score of 44-22. 0-o-o-o soph! PROFESSOR LOMAX OF TEXAS LECTURES ON COW-BOY SON!GS On Friday evening, March 29th, Professor John A. Lomax lectured in the college chapel on \The Songs .of the Cow-Boy.\ The lecture was under the aus- pices of the English Club. For a number of years Mr. Lomax has devoted his time to collecting these genuinely popular ballads of that picturesque character in American life-now al- most extinct-the cow-boy. Nearly all the ballads have been taken down from word of mouth from cow- boys themselves or from those who learned them fron1 cow-boys. Speaking of the collection, the New Orleans Times-Democrat said: \The tragedies, the loves, the pleasures of these dwellers in the plains, are all re- flected in these songs with which they were wont to beguile the· hours that would otherwise have hung heavily upon them. These ballads and songs sprang up in the seventies along the cattle trails. They are breezy, realistic, and often unblushingly profane; love songs, camp songs, trail songs, freighting songs, songs of the stampede, of the Indian fight, of the miner, of the hunter, of the squatter-all the airs that appealed to the imagination of these unknown ballad-makers.\ They enable us, as no body of written documents does, to reconstruct in our imaginations the actual life in that important and now past period of national expansion. Professor Lomax gave liberal selections from the songs and specimens of cow-boy lingo with illus- trations of cow-boy singing. The lecturer is Secretary of the University of Texas, from which he was graduated in 1897. He took the degree of Master of Arts at Harvard in 1907 and holds the Sheldon Traveling Fellowship from Harvard for the Investigation of American Ballads. He is also President of the American Folk-Lore Society. Pro- fessor Lomax has recently delighted audiences at Harvard, Yale, Pennsylvania, Cornell, Vassar, and 1nany other colleges.

8 THE CONCORDIENSlS MUSICAL CLUBS WILL WlNNIN'G TENNIS TEAM HOLD MA:NY CONCE,RTS IS PRESENT PROSPECT One ·of the most successful concerts of the season was held by the .musical clubs at Troy on the evening of March sixteenth in the chapel of the Emrn.a Willard school. All of the members of the glee dub were in espedally good voice and entered into the concert with spirit and vim. Needless to say the mandolin and banjo clubs did splendid work.. That the efforts of the clubs were appreciated was shown by the re- peated encores. After the concert the junior class of the school gave a reception. Last Tuesday evening the clubs scored another suc- cess before a large and appreciative audience at the Methodist church in Scotia. For the remainder of the coUege year .manager Male has arranged a very full and complete schedule. On April twelfth a concert will be given in Watervliet_ The next week the dubs, compri.sing about forty men, will make the New York trip in a special Gar, leaving town on the seventeenth and giving a concert at the First Presbyterian church of Poughkeepsie that night .. This is the church of Rev. :c'r. McNab, who is a Union alumnus. On the eighteenth, nineteenth and twen- tieth concerts will be given in Kingston, Freeport, L. I., and at the Washington Avenue Baptist church in Brooklyn. The following week the clubs will journey to Cana- joharie where a matinee concert on A_pril twenty- ~eventh will be given. The next night will be spent in Fort Plain. On May fourth a trip will be made to Glens Falls and on May tenth a concert is to be given at Bal' ston Spa. Although arrangements are only tentatively com- pleted concerts will, in all probabHity, be held in Am- sterdam, Saratoga and at the TenEyck in Albany. DR. ELLERY APPOINTED MEMBER OF RECEPTION COMMITTEE Dr. Ellery has been appointed a member of the re- ception committee of the Eighth International Con- gress of Applied Chemistry. The association will meet in Washington on September 1, and later in New York. At the latter meeting a number of prominent chemists will read papers in French, German, lt&I:an, and English. At the close of the session the foreign chemists will inspect some typical American manu- facturing plants. ------- Prospects for another winning tennis team this ye;tr are exceptionally bright. Last year's team will be (!Ut for practice as soon as the courts on the hill wiH pt:· r. mit. Captain Fairbairn will play this spring, and manager Coykendall, a1ithough recently out of the hu-;. pitali will undoubtedly be on the team. Carmichad and Smith, last year's briHiant players from the law department will also play. The schedule . as arrangtd so far by manager Coykendall is as follows: Trinity, at Trinity, April 29th. Wesleyan, at Middletown, April 30th. Brown, at Schenectady, May 3d. Rutgers, at New Brunswick, May 25th. N. Y. U., at New York, May 27th. ~::;:t l Syracuse -. :~,~.~ .. Stevens J Schenectady dates not definitely decided Also games with the Boat Club and the Edison Club will undoubtedly be scheduled. ENGLISH CLUB HOLDS INTERESTING MEETIN,GS The English Club, which was organized last Febru- ary for the purpose of promoting interest along liter- ary lines, has listened to four very interesting papers during the last two months. The first wc.s a paper on \German Universities\ delivered February 16, by Dr. Stewart. Mr. W. S. Hastings discussed \The Senti~ ment for Nature in Jean Jacque's 'Rousseau'\ on Feb- ruary 20. On March 1, Mr. S. P. Chase read a paper on \The Sentimental in Byron's poetry.\ On March 15, Mr. Willis T. Hanson, '05, read a paper on \The Early Life of John Howard Payne.\ This paper was particularly interesting in that it gave many striking incidents in. Mr. Payne's life during the time he was a student at Union College. Mr. Hanson has unpublished letter- books of Mr. Payne's of which he is making a thorough study. Question: \Why is Clark like the Pope?\ Answer: \Because he makes so many bulls.'' ( t ' .... t fi n r c

nd ub a 'THE CONCORDIENSI~ 9 . -- . - . ----: --· -· . -~--:-:--:-:--:-----:-------:-------,.-- -- ·- ---------- ------·-------- NEWS OF Tl-rE ALUMNI 1858-Rear Admiral ]atnes R. Tryon, U. S. N., died ~ .. 1arch 20th at the United States Navy Hospitrl in Brooklyn. He has been surgeon-general of the Navy tor several years. Rear Admiral Tryon was born in Coxsackie, N. Y., in 1837, and graduated from Union in 1858. After completing his medical course, he en- tered the naval service in 1863. At .the dose of the Civil War, Tryon was -made assistant to the surgeon general. After four years, he went to the Asiatic station. He was made medical inspector in 1891 and the next two years he served as fleet surgeon on the flagship Chicago of the White Squadron, and during its cruise he received decorations for· bravery in the Venezuelan revoluti~on. Upon his return to the United States, Tryon was promoted to surgeon general, with the rank of commodore, and chief of the Bureau of THE !GLAD:IA TOR Across the sodden, dreary campus came a woeful looking creature. Around his head, to keep in place his towsled hair, was a strip of cloth, spotted with blood and dirty. His face was wet and sweaty, his open p10u th and labored breathing tokened some strenuous exertion. A blood-shot eye blinked under a swoUen eyelid; one lip was puffed out and lent a bi- zarre appearance to his features. A sleeve of his jer- sey was missing and his mud-bespattered trousers were torn. And yet across his battle-scarred coun- tenance reposed a smile of deepest serenity, of con- tentment, of triumph. Whence, then, this incongruity of physical disorder and m.en tail poise ? And then the answer came. The gladiator was returning from the snowball scrap, and across his breast, on his dirty, slush-covered jersey, stood in bold, triumphant figures Medicine and Surgery. He was retired with the the \1915\. rank of rear admiral in 1905. Admiral Tryon held the degrees of A.B. Ph.D. and LL.D. from Union. 1860-J\Ilr. Charles E. Sprague. president of the Union Dime Savings Bank, died March 21, 1912, at his home in New York City. Mr. Sprague was born at Nassau, N. Y., on October 9, 1842. He graduated from Unicn College in 1860 with the degree of A. B. Two • years later he received his master.'s degree, and in 1893 the degree of Ph. D. from Union. He served in the Civil War and was wounded at Gettysburg. In 1870, Sprague became connected with the Union Dime ~avings Bank, and becan1e its president in 1892. He became a professor of accountancy at New York Uni· versity in 1900. He wrote much on banking subjects, about which he was an authority. Mr. Sprague was a member of the Cfntury Club, the Loyal Legion of the G. A. R., and a member of the Alpha DElta Phi and the Phi Beta Kappa fraternitie3. SENIOR CLASS ELECTS COMMENCEMENT OFFICERS At an election held on Friday, March 29th, at noon, the Seniors elected the following commencement of- ficers : Class poet, Henry A. Schermerhorn; class marshal, Ralph P. Clarke; song writer, Jacob E. Van Aernan; pipe orator, Blaine R. Butler; ivy orator, Ray- mond D. Shephard; class orator, James H. Potter; class prophet, Martin E. Untermeyer. THERE'S A REASON No wonder Hubert Mann got such good marks last term~ Let me tell you what he did. At least this is what he told. me. He went into strict training to pre- pare for them. In thinking over the best diet for such work, he came to the conclusion that some brain- food would be best, :§o he ate largely of head-cheese. As a special preparation for psychclogy, Hubert went downtown and bought a case of \Grape.Nuts.\ ''There's a reason\ h~ explained, with a wink, when he told the b)ys abo~t it. ~ ~~~ PRESS CLUB MEETS The weekly meeting of the Press Club was held last vVedn'3Sday evening in their rooms in Washburn Hall. The attendance was small and little business was transacted. The present system of sending out news was C:iscussed and was found to be working admirably. A detailed report of the calendar comn-:ittee will be made at the next meeting. The contract for the 1913 calendars has been given to the firm which printed the 1912 caL:ndars, and it is expected that they will be even better than those of hst year.

Orr, '15 Publication Office The New-Hes-Mor Printing Co., Schenectady Railway Waiting Room Building, 420 State Street W~c J\ims of tq£ ~£fu ~narh As the new board is about to assume charge of your paper we naturally feel the loss of the senior members from our number. More fully, ho~ever,. do we now realiz~ the responsibility that has fallen to our lot, but more willingly than ~~er shall we endeavor to bear it to the best of our ability .. Our eyes have not been shut tv defects which have crept into our columns but we hope this year to keep our eyes open more widely to prevent a repetition of thes,e same faults and to ward off many new ones as well. A rather popular criticism of our publication has been \It's very good but still there's room fot\ improvement.\ We are aware of this, but here is where we appeal to the :students. Tell us in just what respects you want the paper in1proved, it's your paper and it is the sincere wish of the new management to issue a paper that shall deal with your interests. If you have any criti- cism make it kn0:wn to any member of the board and it will receive care- ful attP.ntion.

'fHE CON:COI-<.DIENSIS This year we hope to keep four main ideals before us. The first is to make THE CoNCORDIENSIS a conveyor of news. Too often has our paper brought to the notice of its readers events which have occurred a week or more before the date of appearance. Of course this difficulty cannot be en- tirely obliterated in a weekly publication as wiH be at once apparent u PQ_n a moment's reflection. A resume of the week's happenings must be given and an effort must be made to present this old news, so to speak, as though it were real live news. But hereafter we shall adopt the motto of the daily paper, in so far as p:ssible, and publish all the news while it is news. This will necessitate the paper's coming out on time and Wednesday will be set as the day of debut. Secondly we are not unaware that our publication might be improved along literary lines. It should show more originality. It was a happy thought to elect a man to the board to have charge of this department. By his aid together with other assistance we expect to make THE CONCORDI- ENSIS more attractive in the future. Thirdly it is desired to give the publication a more personal tone here- after. That is, the individual men will be made t~ }eel that THE CONCORDia ENSIS is their paper. It has always been customary to allow the men in athletics to make news for the college but we shall now try to even up mat- ters. The big men of the college will, as usual, supply the greater amount of material, yet those men who are not so favored as to be prominent in athletics or politics will not be left entirely in ihe dark. To accomplish our end a special effort will be made to publish student cuts. Fourthly we shall endeavor to print news that will interest our alumni since so many of them are subscribers. We realize that they are interested in student activities but especially in their own classmates and on this ac- count it shall be our aim to run an alumni column as frequently as possible. To attain these ideals, just enumerated, means that the new board must work effectively and to work effectively they must work as a unit.

' 14; all it he ay THE CONCORDIENSIS 13 SU'MMARY OF SUCCESSFUL :1912 BASKETBALL SEASON The basketball season of 1912 was a distinct suc- cess, as regards the percentage of games won and lost, and as regards general results. While H was hardly as suocessful as the 1911 season, nevertheless it would not be saying too mHch to state that every- one was we:ll satisfied with the showing the team made. The season was undoubtedly one of surprises. The games which were counted upon as sure victories often proved to be defeats; on the other hand the teams which were reckoned as the best were defeated. The victory over West Point, in the opening game of the season, was unexpected by the students; the team had not shown up to very great advantage in practice, the \scrubs\ beating them almost every afternoon, and the Army aggregation was known to be a strong one, having already played three games. The next three games, against Syracuse, St. Law- rence and Rochester, were disappointing, particularly so when the fact is considered that Union outplayed their opponents in the Syracuse and Rochester games, but were beaten solely through their utter inability to shoot fouls. This was a weakness which developed in some unaccountable manner, and proved very disas- trous until the team once more \found itself\. With this record of three straight defeats, the team was anything but encouraged at the prospects .of play- ing Williams, especially since Captain Fairbairn had suffered an injury in the Rochester game, and was un- able to take part in the following five games. Our in- vasion of New England opened with· a gloomy out- look, but ended in a blaze of glory, when the news went around on the Hill that we had won, twenty-five to nineteen. The significance of this victory will be realized when one considers that this was the third time in four years that Williams had been beaten in basketball. The victory over Massachusetts Institute of Technology followed the Williams ga1ne, and res- tored both confidence and percentage. The trip to Syracuse and Colgate resulted unfavor- ably; the team was still crippled by the loss of \Ton1- The Junior Week game with Wesleyan proved to be our sixth defeat .of the season. Captain Fairbairn re- appeared in the lineup, but the team was heavily han- dicapped by the absence of \Jake\ Beaver, whose nose had been broken at Colgate the week before. Union put up a very spirirtecl game, and did all that a team hop lessly outweighed could possibly do; but Wes- leyan had the advantage throughout, owing to their superiority in height and weight, together with fine speed, good pass-work and accurate shooting. Thie prospects for a successful season were bad. The team had fougl<tt hard and had played very credit- ably, but through inability to make their foul shcts good, injuries and hard luck in general, the season stood six to three against them. And then things took a different turn; the team-work improved, the shooting became wonderfully accurate, the guarding was so close that in the four remaining games their opponents were able to make only twelve field bas- kets, an average of three a game. The team had played itself into form by the hard knocks suffered in the past, and was in wonderful shape. It would be difficult to picture the surprise on the Hill when the report came that we had beaten Rochester seventeen to twelve on her own ftocr, a feat that was six years in the making. The Pratt gan1e proved rather listless, and was an easy victory. During the next week the men worked very hard, and developed into a . team of very great speed and efficiency, shown by the way in which they bewildered and completely rcuted N. Y. U., fifty to seven. This made the games six to six, and all that was needed for a successful season was a victory over Colgate in the last game of the season. Before the largest crowd of the season the Garnet administered a decisive de- feat to Colgate, the score being twenty-seven to nine, and thus atoning for the defeat earlier in the season. The credit for the good results are due not only to the team, but to the \scrubs\ equally, many of whom came out night after night for practice, with very little hope of making the team, and with the sole de- sire of giving the varsity a good scrimmage. and thus of 1naking the season a successful one. The regulars all played well, bJth individually and my\ Fairbairn~ and was in a slump. The difference collectively. The veterans, Fairbairn, Coward and in playing conditions at Syracuse and Colgate was Hequembourg were even better than before. Captain also a factor in their undoing. The Syracuse court covered an im1nense amount of space, it being scarcely possible to pass the ball the length of the floor. Contrasted to this was the Colgate floor, closed in all around, and not sixty feet in length. The weight against Union was overwheln1ing, a:1d though the men fought very hard, two defeats ensued. Fairbairn was handicapped by injuries, and was not quite up to his physical standard. Upon him fell the difficult ta'3k of playing the one-man defense ga1ne, and how well he fulfilled his duty is shown by the small number of field baskets earned by the oppo- nents. Coward was a very able guard, and by his playing forward n1any games were won. \Jew\ had

14 THE CONCORDIENSIS =================================================================================-~ remarkable ability in gu.a11ding his rnan 7 and at the same time getting free down the floor, and scoring. He al'So deserves much credit for the way in which he handled the team, while acting-captain, during the most critical and hardest part of the season,. when the outlook was very dark. Hequembourg was shifted to center this year and played his new and strange BLAC.K CAT SOCIETY HOLDS FIRST ELECTfON At the first m:eeting of the Black Cat on Friday, March 15, the foU()\vi:ng officers were elected f:or the spring term: Edward R. Doyle, president; Ambrose M. Clark 7 vice~president; Donald A. Coulter, secretary: position very creditably. ''Chick 7 ' was unfortunate in and Raymond S. Blodgett 7 treasurer. The meeting usually drawing the lar;gest man of the opposing team, and was handicapped th:t:oughout by hi~ weight. He was very clever in pass-work, and played a close and .effective guarding game against some of the best men in a basketball suit, as Castle of Syracuse, Parkinson of Wesleyan, and Victor of Williams. The Beavers, \Dave'' and '£jake' 7 as forwards need no comment. Most of the points scored by Union this year were due to their skHI: in getting free and to their wonderful eyes for finding the basket. They co-operated in a very effective way, as was noticeable when one of them was not in the gan1e. These men will undoubtedly prove to be the. two best basketbaU players Union has ever had. Houghton played a very- go<?d game as guard, covering his man closely. He showed a marvelous abi:Lity for long shots, w hid'l figured largely in the score. Houghton proved to be a steady player, and did remarkable work, especially in the out-of-town games;. his long shots decided the Williams game in our favor. His foul shots were a big factor in the scores. Heslin of the. medical school took part in most of the games, and was a fast and able player in any position. His pass-work was quick and accurate 7 and was of ten the means of a basket. Heslin worked hard, but a sprained ankle kept him out of the last five games. The team-work was of a high order, an:i showed constant improvement as the season progressed. The plan of four men down the floor with a one man dE· fense worked out very well. The team was handi- capped by the lack of weight; the n1en averaged only 136 pounds, and were often opposed by tean1s that outweighed them forty pounds to a man. Considering their weight, it would be a difficult task to find a better team, and it seems as if some of the men should be seriously considered for the All-American Team this year. \What Happened to Jones\ IS to be staged by the Colby Dramatic Club.

--~--- -------~- --- - ------ ---- ------- VOL. 3S. APRIL 17,. 1912 No. 20 UN:JON: WILL PROBABLY H.A VE WINNIN:G NJN.E Although the varsity failed to make an especially good showing last Saturday in the game with the Law Department of the University the contest indicated that there is considerable material in the team which can be quickly developed. It is also a pleasing thought that the best mert on the Law School nine wiH be available for the varsity and will probably be out for the next practice. F. T. Dawson, the new permanent coach for the Garnet teams will work in harmcny with coach Ber- gen and this will increase the chances for turning out a winning team. Both coaches are pleased with the rnaterial at hand and predict a successful season. Coach Bergen has long cherished the idea of form- ing a second team and the matter has now been laid before the athletic board for consideration. The ad- vantages of such a team are appan~nt. This nine will help the varsity get into shape, and at the same tim-e will be developing for future varsity teams, material that will be needed as the senior members drop out. Practice is being held regularly every afternoon at four o'clock in order to put the men. in the best con- dition possible for Saturday's game with Tufts which will be played on the campus. At present the campus is torn up badly but work is rapidly progressing on the diamond and it will be in spLendid form for the first game of the, season. Dan O'Keefe and Don Hutchens will probably be the battery for the opening game. The faculty of Vanderbilt has granted to seniors and juniors the privilege of inflicting corporal punishmen or \padding'' upon wayward freshmen who stray from the paths of rectitude. The facul~y made this conces- sion instead of agreeing to a \personal liberty\ pro- vision, which stated that no freshman should be absent from his room after 9 o'clock at night without special permission from the supervising committee. PAGEANT FOR BENEFIT OF NEW G YMN·AS1UM Will Be Held in May and Will Show Development of City Cjlnd College Plans are now well under way for a pageant, or- ganized by Mrs. Richmond, for the benefit of the new gymnasium. It wilt be given on the afternoons and perhaps also the evenings of May thirtieth and thirty- first and June firs.t and will celebrate the two hundred and fiftieth anniversary of the granting of the first charter of land in Schenectady-· the real founding of the city. The services of Miss Constance Mac Kay of New York City have been sec1;1.red to direct the pageant.. She is especially well fitted for the work, as she has had wide experience in similar affairs, having been connected for some time with Percy Mac Kaye, the well known play-wright. The pageant will have fifteen ·scenes and will be participated in by about three hundred people. About forty of those who are to take part are already at work. The scenes will represent the development of Schenectady and the College. In accordance with the legend that Hiawatha lived here, the first scene will represent his birth and another his departure . to the West. Another scene will represent the massacre by the French and Indians. Others will show the visits of Lafayette and Washington, the founding of the Col- lege, the birth of fraternities, and the departure of the students at the out-break of the Civil War. Dr. Nott will be shown in his three-wheeled chariot. There will also be a symbolic representation of the industrial development of Schenectady, and., the pageant will dose with a symbolic group showing Schenectady clasping the hands of industry and learning. There will be other groups also, but so far their character has not been definitely decided upon. Princeton and Syracuse have added compulsory swimming to their curricul urn.

THE CONCORDIENSIS ==============================================================================~~~ PRINCETON MAN CHOSEN FOR PERMANENT COACH F. T. Dawson will assist \Tommy'' Berg~n in coach- ing the baseball squad this spring. Mr. Dawson will have charge next year of the three sports of football' basketbaH and baseball. However he win be able to be at Union during the spring- and will proba~ly have charge of the second baseball team and of the spring football practice. Mr. Dawson ·entered Columbia University, and after a short time, went to Princeton and was .graduated with the class of 19q6 •. He·p~ayed every position be- hind the line on the PrinGeton. varsity football team, and was catcher, anci .in. his· senior year; captain, of the champion baseball team. While he did not .play basketball in college, Mr. Dawson will be ab1e tocoach as he was active in this sport on his. preparatory school team. 0 JU:NIOR· AND SOPHO.MORE .

SHEPARD TO BE GENERAL SECRETARY Raymond D. Shepard, '12, has been chosen by the Advisory Committee of the College Christian Asso- ciation, to be the General Secretary ne:xt year, suc- ceeding Cavert, '10, who goes to New York to study at Union Theological Seminary. SPRING FOOTBALL PRACTICE TO BEGIN SOON Spring football practice will start as soon as the weather permits. The men will get out in togs and start getting into shape. Coach Dawson will have charge of spring practice, which will consist of punt· ing and general light work. IN·ERESTTING EXPERIENCE ON .DEP·UTATION TRIP Students Go on Easter Trip_ to Work Among Boys \College Boys Coming-·· April 3 to 7\ was the notice that welComed seven: Union CGllege students, when they stepped off the train at Stamford, a little viUage in the Catskill~, where th~y went in company with Ralph Colson, the State Student Y. M. C. A. Secretary, and \Dan\· Chase, the Boys' Secretary of Delaware County, to work among the boy~ and young feHows '• of the town. The men who went from Union on the trip were: Shepard, ;12; Ttu~bull, '12; Hutchens, '13;. Dewey, '13; L.a Barron;, ':13; F~tensbee, '14-; and Cavert, '10, . 'c The purpose of the trip was ·to try to show to the fellows of the town the value of a strong character and of straightr dean Christian lives. The days were spent in \mixing in\ with the boys and in getting ac- quainted with the people of ·the town~ One mornin_s was given over to a climb up Mt. Utsayantha, 3300 ft. hight. Saturday afternoon was devoted to a basebaH game between \the town boys\ and' ''the college boys.'' The game resulted in a victory for the latter due to their excellent battery, Deyvey and Hutchens. The less said about the rest of the team the better! How· ever; it was a game long to be remembered. In the evenings meetings were held in ·one of the vil- lage churches, at which \the college boys\ gave straight simple talks about the Christian life. A \eel- lege quartet\ composed of La Barron, Folensbee? Dewey, and \Dan\ Chase, captivated(?) the audience One evening a moving picture show a few doors away competed with \the college boys\ yet over 100 people came to the meeting. On the last evening there were over 300 present, among whom were almost all the boys and young felloys of the village. Altogether it was a great experience. \The college boys\ had a fine time, made many friends, and had the j.oy of feeling that they had helped, in some measure at least; a lot of the boys to live strong Chris- tian lives. ELIHU ROOT MAY BE HONORARY CHANCELLOR Although it has been reported that Honorable Elihu Root will be unable to act as chancellor, no definite word to this effect ;has been received from him. Presi- - .. . ' dent Richmond in spite of these rumors has again written urging his acceptance but up to the present time has not received any reply.

We are glad to say that such a view is not held by many of. the men on the hill. Let us ask why the juniors and seniors should not desire the an- ... nual snowball scrap. They have all taken their turns at it while they were ~ . .-: underclassmen and it is a well deserved privilege to be a spectator after the '• \

Moreover it is not true that the underclassmen.were greatl·y opposed to the fight. Of course, there may have been a few \'short sports'' in each class, and it can be admitted that the thought of such a combat is not a most pleasant one, but yet the under classes as a 'vvhole were far from wishing to do away with one of the old college customs. As for the cases of pneumonia that have been caused by it they are few and far between. If such catastrophies were a usual result the scrap would have been stopped by·the faculty long ago. Many precautions are taken by the combatants against evil effects. After the contest a number of the men go to the \gymn'' where they take a warm bath and have a good rub down and where there are dry clothes awaiting them. Those who do not go to the gymnasium retire to their fraternity houses where equal precautions are taken. It appears ludicrous to clain1 that interest in the combat was lacking. One need only to have witnessed the fight to come to such a conclusion. The warriors on both sides set up their warhoops with vim and entered the strife with vigor. Equal interest was manifested by the faculty, students, and spectators in general. Our friend who says that interest in the under- class contests is lacking after the first part of the college year should wit- ness the scraps that take place at the idol and last the whole night before moving up day which comes in tlie latter part o{May:· If these are the reasons, should the scrap be abolished? Why not abolish the cane rush and idol worship also? Let's abolish everything that is distinctive of Union ! If we give up one custom others will suffer the same fate and it will only be a matter of time before we have a real lady like institution. Surely it is strongly opposed to true Union spirit to do away with the snowball scrap. The majority of students desire its continuance and the men who want it abolished are, as a rule, those who lack backbone. ~n ® lo ~ltiott Q1ustom A number of years ago it was a favorite custom and pastime of the Union students to come together on pleasant spring evenings and sing the old Union songs while sitting on the terrace wall. An effort is now being made to start this custom anew as the weather is becoming more pleasant. This effort certainly deserves the hearty support of the entire student body. The men in charge will endeavor to select a night most convenient for the majority of the students and it is hoped that a large delegation will be on hand. Surely this is an admirable custom and true Union men should need . little urging to get right into the spirit of these meetings.

12 THE CONCORDIENSIS PROF. 'CALLAN LECTURES BLAC:K CAT so·ciETY ON A'RCHITECTURE WILL 'HOLD DINNE:R Professor John A. C. Callan of the engineering de- partment commelilcecl his series of lectures on archi- tecture,. Monday evening, April the first. The subject of the :first discourse was Egyptian architecture. Mr. Callan showed the vast scope of the work of the an- dent Egyptians and explained its true significance~ His remarks were rendered more forcible by the use of stereoptican slides. The lecture was held in. the college chapel. This lecture was followed by a second in the same place on the ,ev.ening of April second. The subject for Tuesday night was of special interest to the stu- dents in the classica!l department as weH as to the en- gineers; Greek and Roman architecture was discussed. Views of many famous works of architecture were thrown on the screen. Notable among them were the Acropolis as a whole, the Parthenon, the Appian Way, and the triumphal arch of Constantine. Professor Callan laid special stress on the last men- tioned structure. In discussing the work of the Romans, he explained what influence Grecian archi- tecture had upon it. He also explained that there were three diff~rent types of architecture prevalent at Rome. The lecturer's discussion of the natural re- sources of the Greeks and Romans for sculpture proved that the advantage Jay with the latter. These lectures are to be continued in the future. CORNELL ADOPTS NO-TREAT SYSTEM On March 22 the \no-treat\ system was re-instituted at Cornell by a senior meeting in the Dutch Kitchen, at which each man bought his own drinks. The plan, by which all treating is abolished, seems to have found favor both with the al umrri and under-graduates. It is claimed that it promotes rather than diminishes sociability and ~ood-fellowship and that it will enable students of moderate means as well as those who wish to take only a few drinks, to join in the down-town gatherings. Agitation for a crew of their own has been started by Syracuse women. They say that if Smith women can play football they ought to be able to row. Uni- versity officials have been asked to allow them to use the rowing tnachines nights after the men have fin- ished. Possibly a shell will be bought also. A fine address was heard by the members of the Black Cat Club last Friday night, which was giv:en by Charles N. Waldron, secretary of the Graduate Coun- ciL Mr. Waldron spoke on \Some lnteresting Union Alumni, Living and Dead\. The ta:}k was of great in. terest and instruction to the members of the dub in that it gave them a starting acquaintance with many of Union's famous men. The dub entertained Samutl M. Cavert, Gen. Sec. of Silliman Han;. Thomas A. Fair· bairn, Pres. of the Terrace Ceunci]; Roy W. Peters, Sec. of the Athletic Board and Bayard B. Webb, Pres. of the Senior Class. The meeting was the first to be addressed by an outside Epeaker. At the next meeting which will be held on Friday, all the men on the hill who are interested in Socialism are invited to attend. Walter Lippman, secretary to Mayor Lunh, will speak ·on the \College Man and Socialism.\ Mr. Lippman is a Harvard graduate and founder of the \Intercollegiate Sociaiistic Society\ for the study of socialism. He is ably fitted to speak on the subject and will try to explain the essential prin- ciples of socialism to the college .men. The dinner will begin at 6 o'clock sharp. Those who do not care to come to the dinner, which will cost 25 cents,. may come later to hear the speaker at 6:30. The dinner will be held at Goodman's restaurant under the auspices of the club but wiH in no way be considered a meeting under the lead of freshmen. The club is merely trying to give those an opportunity to hear Mr. Lippman who care to. Those intending to attend the dinner should drop a postal to R. S. Blod- gett, Pyramid Club, to be in his hands not later than 9 o'clock on Thursday morning. Places will be re- served accordingly. MR. HOLT WILL SPEAK Mr. Hamilton Ho!lt will speak in the chapel on April twentieth. He comes under the auspices of the World's Peace Society and will speak on the Fedration of the World. The subject of universal peace is an important and widely discuss{d question and we are very fortunate to have such a speaker as Mr. Holt. His speech is sure to be interesting and well worth hearing.

J~bn Van Rensselaer Hoff, a member of the class of 187i., was retired April 11th after forty years of active service in the United States Army Medical Corps_ Cot Hoff was born at Mount Morris, N. Y., on A.~I>il 11, [848. After graduating frbm Union in 187:1, he took :a course at the College of Physicians and Surgeons=-· Columbia Uni:ve:rsity. When he had received h:is. medical degree, he began his military and professional' Hfe in Nebraska as . a Lieutenant of the Niedical Corps G>f the United States Army. A few years later he was transferred to the East and then spent a year at the University of Vienna. Here he came in tol!lch with European medkal practice and studied the san,i.tation of the European armies. In 1887, Congress passed a law organizing a hospita;l corps, and :fhis biU was successful 1 argely because .of the efforts ()f <:aptain Hoff, who is acknowledged to be the creator ()I the~ Army Field Hospital as it exists to- day. He has travelled widely, having been sent by the government to Porto Rico during the Spanish War, to Pekin during tbe Boxer uprising and to Russia in the Russo-Japanese war. His study of: nilitary sanatary <;onditions in all parts of the wodd made Major Hoff an expert in hygiene and he now began to lecture to the younger .officers in the Corps. After his trip to Russia, he spent one year in the University of Nebraska and two years at Manila as Chief Surgeon. Col. Hoff's work has done much to bring about the remarkable health of our army. As a tribute to his work he received the honorary de[:ree of LL. D. TRACK NEWS ---· The track squad is working hard in preparation for the dual meet with Hamilton May 11. The men have been wcrking indoors but now that the weather is better they are running out of doors. The outlook for the team is very bright; .9-S they have some ex- . :'f. cellent material. Streever, '12, and Vedder, '13, are out for the two mile; Streever, '12, Rogers, '13, Trem- per, '13, and Elmore, '14,: for the mile; La Barron, '13, for the half; Dent, '15, for the quarter; and Hughes, '15, for th.e dashes. Folensbee, '14, Titus, 15, and Butler, '15, ar.e training for the sho~ put, and Ruth- steiner, '15, :B-utler, '15, and Mac Taggert, '15, for the jumping and J>ole vault. THE 1913 GARNET After several months of labor on the part of the . Garnet board the manage1nent is ready to announce that the first issues of the 1913 Garnet will appear about the second week in May. It was the aim of the ' manager to have the annual appear at an earlier day but many details, which had to be included in the year book, delayed the expected date of ·completion. The judgment of the readers win decide the worth of the effort of the class of '13. The board feels jus- tified in saying that from present indications the book will be as good as any published heretofor. The board modestly alilows the reader to say better. The 1913 Garnet will contain about 275 pages bound in a semi-flexible suede leather cover of a rich garnet color. The issue contains many novel features and every student should surely possess one if only for the sake of having the late Prof. Ashmore's mernorium. Through the kindness of Mrs. Ashmore the Garnet will contain a recent photograph of the late Professor taken a short time before his H1ness. A cut of the New Gym with sev,eral pages of desc;ription is also a matter of prime interest to the student. Aside from all these features, you will have to see the Garnet for the others not mentioned here, the art and literary work is fully worth the price of the issue. The manager has contracted for only a limited nun1ber of copies so that no extra copies will re1natn unsold. In order that all students may receive the opportunity of purchasing a copy of the 1913 Garnet they should place their order with the business manager, C. R. Fischle, Beta Theta Pi House. Orders shall be filled in regard to the time of their placement with the manager. Further information on this subject will be given at a later date. The price of this year~s Garnet will be $2.50 or $2.75 sent by mail prepaid. Don't fail to get in your order early. DR. AND MRS.

BASKETBALL RUL:ES CHANGED At the annual meeting of the ·College basketball rules committee, held in New York on Friday and Saturday, several minor changes, designed to make ~he game faster and less rough, were adopted. A player is. to have but 10 seconds for a free try for the basket, after the referee has placed the ball on the foul-line. The two-minute rest periods in the halves were abolished, and the out of bounds rule was de- fined as requiring the ball to go to the nearest ·eligible player. The rules concerning blocking and holding were also made clearer and the officials are to be in- structed to be stricter in their decisions upon these points, in order to make the game more of an offen- sive one.

APRIL 24, 1912 No. 21 UN:l01N'S VICTORY OVER ,.TUFTS BEGINS BASEBA:LL SEASON Garnet Wips 9\7 Through Bunching of Hits and Ex- cellent Work of Dan O'Keefe By W. Earl Weller U11ion's baseball team sprang a little surprise on about 890 of the '900 people that watched the Garnet def:eat Tufts on the campus last Saturday by the score of 9 to 7. A batting streak was developed by Captain Bische's men in the first inning, five hits being rung up in this session. These hits were a combination of swats and bunts that ranged in wannness, and in dis- tance travelled all the way from Dan O'Keefe's. two sacker to left field to Dennis's light bunt towards first. Tufts Change Pitchers The fusillde completely unsettled Davis, who started in the box for the visitors; and he gave place to Carter with no one out in the first inning. The visiting infield also felt the effects of this bunching of hits and two costly errors were committed before the session was over. Carter who replaced Davis on the mound was effective in all but the eighth inning when Union connected for two dngles. These two hits aided and abbeted by a passed ball added two tallies to the Union side of the board. Visitors Play Consistently All credit is due the Tufts team for the game way they fought to win with the score dead against them. They were in the game to the very end and were ready t:> take advantage of any weakness that might develope in the Union team. Hooper, captain and left field of the visitors, starred with a single, a double and a triple with the willow. The Medford infield also played great ball with the exception of the first inning. c·Keefe in Fine F orrn Tufts is reputed to be a hard hitting te::tm, but they found considerable difficulty in connecting with tte ball on Saturday, the majority of their batters going out on easy grounders to the infiEld.. Bische r;layEd his customary gam.e at first and accepted aU his chances without an error. Law School Men Look Good Tasker, McMahon and Dunn of the Law Depart ment covered out field positions for the garnet nine. They had practically no chances to show their worth but, if it is possible to tell a ball player by the way h2 carries himself, then all three are valuable acqm- sitions to the Union string.

8 THE ·CONCORDIEN'SIS ================================================================================~~-~ SUB-FRESHMAN DAY EXPECTED TO BE BlG SUCCESS On Saturday, May 18th, Union will again bolj sub- freshman day. With the experience gained in the past few years and as a result of the hard work of the com- mittee in charge the day this year promises to be the m0st successful yet held. The registration and de- mand for appi:icaticn bl;anks up to the present time points to a lat:ger representation of schods than we have previously had. New and m0re appropriate medals have been pre- }:ared thus removing the necessity of using the ccr lege seat The new medals are in the form of watch fobs, being dihedral in shape with the idol stamped upon them. Below is stamped \Union College Inter- scholastic Day.\ Though there will be no new events n the meet aH. of last year's. trophies will be kept up. The plans for the day are practically the same as those of last year. The only noteworthy change being that the guests will have dinner as well as lunch at the various fraternity houses. This arrangement was made with the view that it would bring us in closer touch with the sub-freshmen and it will also save them the inccnvenience and expense of going down town for dinner. The day will as usual be started off by the reception at Silliman Hall, the visitors being instructed and provided for at the time. The pre- DR. JOHN LEWIS MA~RC'H A MARINE HERo At the breakfast table :last Monday morning we we:re alii filled with admiration as one of our number t\·ad us an account ot the beroic act of '''Johnny\ Mar._:h While out at F:Feeman's Crossing the professor ''·as attracted by the heart rendering :cries of two peo 1 Je whose canoe had been overturned. They were trying to ding to their boat but the icy waters were fast making their bodies numb· and their grip weaker. There were several witnesses of the accident but they all, except \Johnny\' stood trembling and helpless. As our French professor saw that in just a moment a watery grave was to be the fate of the persons in the icy stream., he did not stop to take off his hat, coat or in fact anything, hut like a flash plunged into the deep and was soon at the side of the unfortunates. With a powerful stroke he pulled the victims to the shore and thus avoided a catastrophe secand only to that of the Titanic. We always knew that \Johnny\ had great knowl- edge but we do not understand, how, even in the literature francais he learned to swim and how especially he did the whote heroic deed without even getting his collar wet. Bl:lt then ther~ are a lot of things in the literature of the French peopl ~ that are hard to un:lerstand. Anyway, we know that Doc used liminaries will then be held on the track. At two r.is head! o'clock the finals will be htld. Immediatel¥ after- wards the game with N. Y. U. will be played. At seven-thirty there will be a campus meeting near NEW WIRELESS STA TlON the upper corner of the track at which the medals and J:N WORKIN·G ORDER trophies will he awarded. After several ~peeches the day will ccme to a close. ~ PRESS CL!UB W~LL PUBLISH ALL ATHLETIC PRCGRAMS The athktic Board has voted to the Pre~s Club, the exclusive rigbt to publish the foctball, basket and . baseball pr0grams. It is hoped that this wJl hE.lp the 1 'ress Cl1b in a financi2l way. ·~ MARCONI WILL VISIT UNION Guglielmo Marconi, the inventor of the wireless, will soon be in Schenectady as a guest of Dr. Stein- n1etz. He will pay a visit to the college chiefly to in- spect the ebctrlcal work of t:u~ institution and the new win.l ss static n just erected. The new wirel~ss station on the campus i 3 now tn condition to re:eive m~ssa_ges. Its pole is 165 ft. high and the antennae cover a space of 200ft. by 15ft. The station is set up near the electrical b.b::Katory in which the instruments are installed. The apparatus which was arrang~d by two members of the senior dass is to be used for experimentatbn only. EXAMINATIONS FOR ALEXANDER SCHOLARSHIP The examinations for the awarding of the Alex- ander Prize Scholarship wHl be held during the week beginning May 20. Students who wish to compete should register at the College Office not later than May 10. The requirements for the scholarship may be found in the catalog.

The concerts given were well received in every instance. The following are taken from Poughkeepsie and Kings- ton newspapers in which towns entertainments were he'ld. The Union College musical clubs gave an excellent c-oncert in the chapel of the Presbyterian church Wed- nesday evening and the attendance in spite of the in- cl.~·ment weather was good. The programme was a varied one and every num- ber brought forth deserved applause. Several select- ions that were especially well receiv~ed were the \Rosary\ by the glee club and a popular medley .. \Love Old Sweet Song\ by the m~ndolin club was also one of the features of the evening's programme. Mr. MacMillan's violin selections and Mr. Dicken- son's vocal numbers were received with approval and applauded vigorously.-Poughkeepsie Eagle. The following is taken from the Kingston Leader: The musical concert Thursday evening at Y. M. C. A· hall, given by the Union College musical clubs, under the auspices of the senior class of Kingston Academy was one of the finest productions of the year. The program of mandolin, glee and banjo music was re- cci ved with enthusiasm and hearty applause extremed w~th vigor and animation, with a musical fullness and harmony that reached all in the spirit of that key note o: the free, spontaneou3 character of cc:llege men. There was an a::lhercnce to remembrance and to p1thos when the clubs gave \Home Sweet Home\. The entire program was most creditably rendered. From the moment that the curtain rose at Asso- ciation Hall last eve;Jing and thirty-five Union College men c:ssen1bled on the stage and informally grouped themselves tJ sing their first number until the last e ::ho of the rousing college ydl for Kingston Academy died away, the Union College musical clubs delighted the large audience which had responded to the call of the senior class of K. A. The glee club was made up of good voices and pleased in their sE.riou~:ly musical n:1mbers and their songs full of inimitable college pranks. Perhaps their best number was \Home Sweet Home\ by John H::>ward Payne, Union College, class of 1810. Even the musicians in the audience re- marked that they had never heard so fine a mandolin club, due in part to the unusual instruments used, es· pecially a mandolin bass that gave body to the music, which possessed rich vividness of color. The playing of the men was i1fdeed excellent, the attack and re- '9 ---·------- __ __.__ - -- - - '• , ..... __ --- lease being enviably good·. \Gloriana\ by Weidt, was a really elaborate c0.mposition finely given. The banjo club was also exceptionally good, and quite aside from the realistic finish of war whoop and pistol shot, ''The indian War Dance,\ was splendid. Mr. Mac Millan, the violinist, is a real musician an:i played de Retzke's ''Adoration\ in a truly artistic manner. Every num- ber on the program was enccred and whil'e the leaders of the Union men expressed their p'leasure at the wel- come extended them, it was evident that the Kings- tonians were equaUy wt:ll pleased in their guests. One of the most versatile of the musicians was Louis De LaVergne of this city who was a member of each one of the three clubs.-The Kingston Freeman. BLACK CAT ENJOYS TALK ON SOCIALISM At the meeting of the Black Cat on Friday evening, April 19; Mr. Lippman, former secretary to Mayor Lunn, was the speaker. He opened his remarks by saying that it is imperative for college men, although they were aften believed incapable of doing so, to face the problems of present day politics. He then treated in succession the topics, child labor, food adulteration, and political graft, dwelling especially upon the latter. He showed how one case of graft extended from a city alderman in San Francisco to Harriman, the rail- road kin~. Mr. Lippman next proceeded. to state the Socialistic method for meeting the trust problem, that is, government ownership of monopolies. Upon the conclusion of the address he an3wered questions pro- posed by members and visitors, and t~e meeting was adjourned soon after.

The pre- diction that there was good material in the team has proved true, and if with the little practice that the team has had we can defeat Tufts what shall we conjecture to be the fate of our other opponents when we have settled down to good hard training! The whule team certainly deserves credit individually, especially Dan O'Keefe, who has come back into his old form in an instant and who gives fair promise of being able to handle the sphere even more scientifically this year than in the past. The student body is delighted with the pace that the garnet nine has. set and every rna~ should feel it his personal duty to get right into the spirit of the game and give his unceasing support to the team in order that the whole season may be colored with such victories as that which now tints its. beginning. Come out for cheer practice every time one is held and take your part in it with vigor! Be consistent in your support, systematize your spirit!

·1 .. ~ -==~·~======~============~================~=================== -.,~~ . THE.CONCORDIEN'S1S .ll v m£nnis XUax Taxes are one ·of the necessities for running athletic ~earns. As tennis is one of the sports which is not aided financially by the regular athletic tax it must be supported by a special student tax. The amount has already,. been decided upon and should have been paid at registration for the spring term. For different reasons many of the students did not meet their obli· gations in this respect at the proper time and as a result the tennis manage. ment is not in a very prosperous condition. The underclassmen, especially the freshmen, have been delinquent and it would be showing good spirit on their part if they would atone somewhat for this tardiness by immediate -payment. The tennis team was a winning one last season and gives fair promise . of attaining equally good resu~ts this spring and there' is no reason why the students should be backward in their support ~ttitubi~ itt <llqaptl It is unpleasant but necessary to speak of the improper attitude main- tained. by some of the 'Students during chapel service. There is a general restlessness at the beginning and after this has quieted down \certain indi- viduals assume the right to hold short conversations or pass remarks as to how the chapel service appeals to them. Such an attitude is, of course, be- neath college men and those at fault would do well to be respectful even though the service may not interest them. Xlrl1£ ~efn!i ~epttrfment It has nbw been decided to allow one of the associate editors to have charge of the news department of THE CoNCORDIENSIS each week.. These editors will take control of the issues in turn and are to be held responsible for all news contained in ~he publication. This will tend to give the asso- ciate editors more training in newspaper work and will probably be the . means of a better paper in the future. The news editor for this issue is H. H. Hitchcock~ '14. I• I

12 THE CONCORDIENSIS SOCIALIST CLUB ORGANIZED A socialist club has been organized at the college, and from general indications will n1ake a strong effort to gain recognition. It was organized on Friday, April 19, at t'b.e City Hall by a small group of college men who are interested in the study of the subject. The Club consist of eleven members. It has five seniors, one junior, four freshmen and one post grad- uate enrolled. An effort will be made to interest other men on the hill who are known to be partial to the socialists' cause. A charter will be sought from the Intercollegiate Socialistic Society and a program will be laid down for future activity. An executive committee has been appointed and a constitution wilt be drawn up. Just what plans will be carried out by the club have not been given out. There is no question but that the club will meet opposition in one form or another from various quarters. The fact however that there are Republican and Democratic clubs on the hill seems to foreclude a radical action on the part of the faculty. While it is understood that President Richmond is not inclined to favor such a club, it is thought that he wil 1 not take steps to dissolve it. The destiny of the club will probably ryst largely upon the program the mem- bers carry out, and their attitude toward the faculty. The question of socialism is a pertinent one in Sche- . nectady. To say that. the members of th~ cl~b are socialists is a fallacy, for many of them will not adn1it it. The object of the club is to study the subject and after investigation, some of the members may take sides against it. At all events the n1ost rational men see some good points in socialism, and are willing to give it credit. There are other points which n1eet less ready acceptance. Indeed, the conception of \socialism\ as held by one man may differ entirely from that held by another. It is still being forn1ulated as a theory, and though at times it may appear too theoretical and vague for practical adoption, there are features of it toward which national government in every land is more and more leaning. It would seem un-Union like if those men on the bill who see no good in a socialistic club in the college were to take measures to suppress it. Such an action would show an inconsistent change of attitude fron1 that shown in the motives which lead to the founding of Union and those now in the college spirit. For that reason it seems likely that the members of the club will be permitted to carr~ out their organization as they wish; but if they violate the privilege entrusted in their hands to uphold the name of Union, then is the time to oppose it. At present, however, it is hard to see how such an organization can soil Union's name. The Press may distort true socialistic conditions and the glibe may def~lme it, but back of it is an irresist- able movement in modern sociology ;which college and press cannot annihilate. Let the college men guide and correct rather than destroy in the function of true criticism which is in the last analysis the exercise of open mindedness. Su btnitted to THE CONCORDIENSIS by a member of the club. HAMLET~S SOLILOQUY ON F:IRST By EDWARDS. MORRISSEY To steal or not to steal; that is the question: Whether 'tis headwork on this bag to stick And wait till someone clouts the pill a mile, Or to take chances on the catcher's wing And beat it down to second. One man's down; An infield grounder means a double play. If I but steal I'll score upon a hit, And on an out I'll either hold the bag Or move along to third. To get a start : To steal, or else get out: Ay, there's the rub; For if the catcher pulls a nifty throw, Although I get the jump and hit the dirt, They'll nail me by a mile. Ah! there's the dope That makes the runner hug the bag he's on; For who would risk the chance of getting nipped At second base upon a double play, Or being forced upon a fielder's choice, Or .caught off first upon a fast line drive, When he might play it altogether safe _By going down? I'd sign the batter now To sacrifice or play the hit-and-run, ·But that I dread the pitcher wasting one ; And then thes'd hand me out a showing-up And make me look like something off the 1 ots. I guess I'd sooner bear these ills on first. Than fly to others that I known not of- Good catchers sure m2ke cowards of us all. ~. NEW FRATERNITY HOUSE ON COLLEGE CAMPUS The Phi Delta Theta fraternity has decided to build a new hol}.Se on the college campus. It will be a very carefully designed structure and will probably be situ- ated near the present Chi Psi lodge.

14 .. · THE ·.·coNCORDIENS'IS P·RESS CLUB HOLDS ELECTION AND BANQUET Last night the Press Club held its annual banquet at Glenn's Restaurant. The banquet began at 9:00 o'clock. Preceding the banquet, the eiectio~ of of- ficers for the coming year too'k place. At this meet- ing, the chairman of each .committee made a report of the work done by his ·committee during the year .. The Press Club has originated a new system which is working well. Instead of s~nding the we.e'kly bulletin to a long list of papers, many. of which do nat use the news, news is now sent t() about thirty papers who use it. Also the items are sent out on the day they occur and thus the new~papers get fresh. news, fit to use. This system on the whole, seems to be far superior to the one formerly in use. The wire com. mittee has sent the scores of football,. baseball an.d basketball games to the New York papexs and has placed them on the Associate Press wire immediately after every game. The .officers elected for next year were: President, P. N. Riedenger, '12; vice-president,, H. H. Hitchcock, '14; secretary, W. C. Baker, '15; treasurer, S .. L. Walworth, '14; ,member of executive committee, V. R. Tremper,. '13; faculty adviser, Dr. Barnes. At the conclusion of tJie. business meeting, the men adjourned to Glenn's where the banquet was waiting. Nineteen active members of the clnb were :Present, to· gether with Dean Ripto~, Dr. Barnes and C. N. Wal· dron, secretary of the Graouate Council. President Richmond had hoped to be present but was unable to arrange for it. After the banquet, DJ;\. Barnes acted as t(}astmaster and introduced the variou.s speakers. The following toasts were responded to: ' The ·Press Club in the Past, H. N. Trumbull, '12, The Press Club's Relation to the Alumni, C. N. Wal· dron, '06; The· Press Club in the Future, P~ N. Rie- denger, '13; The Press Club as a CollegeOr~anization, V. R. Tremper, '13. Dean Ripton also gave a talk to the club. The committee in charge was H. H. Hitch- cock, '14 and H. L. Persons, '15. OUTSIDE GAMES ABOLISHED FOR CLASS TEAMS The movement on f~ot, to maintain a second base• ball team will tend to discourage the playin.g of out· side games by class t~ams.. . It has been felt in the past that, owing to a }:ack of organizati()n of class teams, they have not shown up to the best advantage. Inter-class baseball, however, will be encouraged. HfSTO·RY· OF ·,UNION'S SONGS Extracts. from History ·of Union University Written by Andrew VanVranken Raymond, D. D., LL.D. The spirit of a college finds constant ,expression i. . . n Its songs, and while many of these gain quick popu- larity, a few only retain their popularity from genera- tion to generatio.n, so that they are as farniliar to the gray· haired graduate as to the under-~raduate. From the many songs wl1ich have been sung by Union rnen we select four which have stood th~ test of. time, and are.heard today in every gathering of the loyal sons of Alma Mater. Pre-eminent among these is \The Song to Old Union\ as it is, commonly called, which ·was written . by Fitz_ hugh Ludlow of the class of '56, at the close of his senior year upon the request of Dr. Nott. It is said that after writing it late at night, he was so dis- satisfied with it that he threw th~ manuscript into the waste paper basket It was rescued however, by his room-mate who showed it to Dr. Nott with the result that it -was printed and sung at the commencement of 1856; and from that day to this it has brought the exercises of each commencement to an inspiring close. The original manuscript of this song is still in the possession of the Kappa Alpha fraternity of which Mr. Ludlow was a member. Next in popularity is undoubtedly \The Terrace Song\ also written by Fitzhugh Ludlow. To appre- ciate this song fully one must be familiar with the terrace extending across the college grounds in front of the dormitories., and capped with flat stones, from which r,ises a railing inclined at such an angle as to form a ,comfortab~e seat for anyone · sitting upon the stones. It is not surprising that the terrace early be- came the favorite rendezvous of the students, and many of the n1ost delightful memories of college life are associated with the good fellowship of the evening twilight hours spent there. With this explanation Ludlow's song sings itself. To Homer Greene of the class of '76 belongs 'the honor of having written another of Union's favorite songs, \As They Bound the Laurel\ or ~~Alma Mater\. From the day on which it was first sung it has voiced the feelings of all loyal hearts, and it has lent itself naturally to every occasion of rejoicing. \01~ Union Bes:id,e the Mohawk Vale\ was written by Mr. C. E. Franklin of the class of '83. The song met with immediate favor and took its place at once among the songs that Union men wHl always sing.
