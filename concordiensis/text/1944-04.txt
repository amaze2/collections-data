Y •• FRIDAY, APRIL 7, 1944 Price 10c V-12 CO.~Commander Horner rKilb Appointed to Tells Story of His Experiences l~.istoryDe.parbuent Schenectady Man Has Been Teaching Here Since March Holds Private Pilot License:~ Interested in Aeronautics, Clubs, and Civilian Defense The man behind the whole ma- chine of the V-12 Unit here and the one who is r:esp.onsible for its com- missioning and organization probably not too well known to most of the men who became part of this unit March 1st. Lieutenant Commander Maurice L. Horner, Jr., U.S.N.R., the Commanding Offker, occupies this position· in a well-ex- perienced capacity which his pre- vious life reveals. His graduation from Yale-Shef- field Scientific School in 1913 start-· ed Commander Horner on a very interesting career. At college he was a member of the gun team which maintained a superior record. During the firE't World War he served in the Army Air Corps, en- listing in May 1917 and serving un- til December 1919. Following this tour of duty, Commander Horner 1 emained in the Army Air Corps Reserve until 1923. He holds mem- bership in the Aero Ciub of America and in the Institute of Aeronautical Sciences. From 1937 to 1942 he was Commissioner of the Illinois Aero- nautical Commission. Commander Horner has always been in aero- nautics and holds a private pilot's license. After the last war the Captain was very active in the American Legion. He is listed as one of the charter members of that organiza- tion and helped form a post in Chicago. He is also a member of the Forty and Eight honorary Club of the Legion. Prior to entering Naval Service Commander Horner was a Director of the 'National American Whole- sale Grocers Association and held an important position as a Cap- The C. 0. LT. COM:BR. M. L. HORNER, JR. tain in the National Home De- fense Corps. His present Naval career started on March 9, 1942, when he received his commission. Commander Hor- ner received his indoctrination at the Great Lakes Training Station. After receiving this preliminary training, Commander Horner was attached to the Chicago office of the Office of Naval Officer Pro- curment. At this E'tation he was the Senior Interviewing, Reviewing and Forwarding Officer. Commander Horner was then as- signed to command the V-12 Unit at Union and the ship-shape ap- pearance of this unit testifies as to his efficiency. Mr. Cyril Kilh, has been teaching at Union College since March 1st, as in Instr1:1ctor of History. For- merly a student at •I.Jnion, he trans- felTed to New York State Teachers College in Albany where he re- ceived his A. B. degree. Mr. Kilb continued his education at State Teachers to receive an M.A. degree. While at Union he was the ·college correspondent for the Schenectady Union-Star. During the year he spent at Union he took history under Profes- sor Doty, of whom he is now an associate. Mr. Kilb is not only a histo1·y teacher. but enjoys participating in and watching ::'ports, such as squash, tennis and basketball. Our new instructor is musically inclined, a ba-njo and guitar player, who has played in many bands around Sche- nectady and Albany. By these jobs,. and some other time put in at the G.E. and Alco plants he was able to work his way through college. Taught in Hig·h Sehool After Kilb'~o• graduation he re- ceived a position as social studies teacher in the South Kortwl'ight High Scl1ool. South Kortwright, New York. It wa;· during his high school teaching that Mr. Kilb be- came interested particularly in history. It all started when he read biographies, each one seemed more interesting than the next. \Reading these should jm.'t make a person natrually interested in history\ says Mr. Kilb. Born March 18, 1919, Mr. Kilb is a local man, graduating from Mont Pleasant High School in 1937. When asked about Union, Mr. Kilb said that he thought Union to be the finest little college in the country. Both V-12 and civilian stu- dents are of the highest type and he is glad to be teaching them. Here and There The Royal Order of Schmaltzes, a very powerful society, thotgh very exclusive. held an important meeting last Sunday. Don Duff. the president, Walt Finnigan, the vice-president, .and Clem Easton, the Grand Knight, gathered to- gether for a very solemn moment. An application had been received for membership. After appropriate rituals, Richard Wildermt1th, bet- ter known as Wilbe, received the stamp of approval of liquid shoe polish on his *'**. For details see Wilbe.

What was the big gathering of Chi Psi men in the parl.or of their humble abode last Saturday after- noon after Captain's Inspection? Were the boys gathered together to sing songs and have a merry time? If so, they surely were not singing \Who Threw the Overalls in Mrs•. Murphy's Chowder\ their song could have been \Who Threw the Monkey Wrench in the Coke Machine\. After all kinds of threats of reprisals and what not, the boys still not being able to un- cover the culprit, decided to pay for damages to said Coke Machine. Many were the sighs of relief when word came through that the boys could still keep their cherished dates that Saturday evening. What do you say Goggin, won't you keep those Chi Pi'li boys out of trouble? These restriction threats are hard on our morale! Last weekend \Captain F1ood\ did duty in Albany-not on the waterfront either. This week \Cap\ revealed he wrote a letter to the girl demanding that she apologize for her disgraceful advances to- wards him.

Dr. R. S. Cunningham, Dean of the Albany Medical College has been invited to talk on \The Kind of Applicant Who Is Accepted to Medical School.\ Albany Medical College is cm·- l'eiltly engaged in training Army and Navy as well as civilian physi- cians. A representative of the Dean is a member of the Navy Commit- tee of Deans which passes on all Navy app'licants of this Navy Dis- trict to Medical schools.

T.Male Director OfBandSince1911 Was Captain in Last War Former Member of State Council, Also College Engr. Way in the back of the Admin- istration BuDding is an office marked \College Engineer\. It is here that we find that versatile gentleman, Charlie Male. When asked for a story of him- self, Charlie agreed only if the story were to commence in 1906. He said that that was fa1· enough back for any story to ebgin, and far back enough for any one to remember. ISn 1906, Mr. Male was employed by the Schenectady Trust Com- pany. It was in 1908, however, that the academic field first claimed his services. In that year he taught in a little country school. He was awarded his Civil Engineering de- gree by Union in 1913 and in 1914 received his Master's in C. E. here too. From this point on, his life is, as Charlie says, crosspatched. From 1914 to 1916 he worked as a civilian employee for the United ,States Government on the Panama Canal, first as a sanitary engineer and then as a topographical drafts- man and surveyor on the canal fortifications. Upon returning to this country he was employed by Alco and then was appointed as a state health de- partment sanita1·y engineer. Two days after the declaration of war· upon Germany, Charlie was in the uniform of Uncle Sas as a Second. Lieutenant in the Second Light Engineers. He soon was overseas by the end of the combat was a Captain in the Sanitary Corps. In 1919 Charlie returned to his Alma Mater to teach Mathematics and for the next twenty years stu- dents received the benefits of his knowledge and keen sense of hu- mor. Politics have claimed a little of his time too. In 1922-23 he was a New York State Assemblyman. Having tasted politics once, he de- cided that this was not a too healthy pastime or occupation, and so he retired a little from the active poli- tical scene. Today Charlie is still a state committeeman for the Re- publican Party. Prom Will Be Cay Bring a Protege Jflhaddya Say, Eh? At a special meeting last Tues- day night the Interfrate1·nity Coun- cil named President John Mason '45 as chairman of the forthcoming Spring Prom to be held on Satur- day night, May 13. Chairman Mason, with the appro· val of the Coe1ncil, appointed the following committee heads to work with him in organizing the dance: Publicity A/S Robel't MacKay David M. Cohen '45 Decorations A/S Andrew Andel'- son Arrangements William Lasser '45 Refreshments William Baker '46 Booths Tickets Chaperones A/S Lyman Pot tel' A/S Thomas Hoff- man Richard Left- wich '45. No band has as yet been signed, but contacts are being made with several music agencies in New York City so that within the next two weeks arrangements should be successfully completed. The gymnasium and bandstand will be completely decorated in true ballroom style. As as the last formal dance the various Navy ships and civilian dorms will be assigned booths. AJI students are encouraged to con- tribute to some one of the booths so that they may have a place where they can get together with theil· friends between dances. A fee of fifteen doHars will be charged for each booth and ticket repre- sentatives are asked to collect a proportionate amount from each man in their dorms to meet the quota. Hal Wittner announces that a home baseball game has been ten- tatively schoduled with Williams College for the Saturday afternoon of the Prom. More definite infor- mation on the game will be released in the near ·future. Chairman Mason states that the 1944 Spring Prom .promises to be a definite success due to the interest and enthusiasm shown by 'both Navy and civilian students. ----o--~- Beauteous Babe Big Brassy Band Brings Boys' Bliss When asked something about the bands of the past. he pointed proudly to the fact that he was Chapel this Wednesday was the .organizer of the fit•st Union ·graced with an. extra attraction.

INTRAMURAL .FINALS TON:IGHT Vol. LXVIII. No. 6 t The 1 Student :Newspaper and Wartime Log of Unio·n College SCHENECTADY, N. Y., FRIDAY, APRIL 14, 1944 CALL FOR DIAMOND WORKERS Price 10c Lt. Zenti Receives Orders For Invasion Assignment Ticket Representatives For May 13th Prom listed Zenti Gets Indoctrination in~----------~ Florida.; To Go Overseas I j ABE E Outlines Plan Last Wednesday the V-12 Uni~ at I Union College lost a gosd off1cer I and a fine gentleman. Lt. Rico N. Zenti received his orders to report to HoHywood, Fla., for indoctrina- tion and further training before be- ing sent overseas. He expects to ship out in a wee;, or two to help keep the millions of American fight- ing men in trim who are waiting for Invasion date and softening up in the meantime. Lt. Zenti was bol'n in nmthern Michigan on June 27, 1910. The lit- tle town of Princeton, acclaimed as one of the coldest :;;pots in the country, was chosen a:s the luclcy site. Young Rico .often attributed his rcrbustnes.s to the cold weather which often drqpped as low as fifty degrees below zero. Moving from a local parochial school to high school, he saw and played his first game of basketball. His team lost the state championship by two points. Finishing high school, he ente1·ed North Michigan State Teachers College where he majored in Physical Ed. He was President of his Senior Class, participated in all sports and was a leader in many. While at North Michigan he saw his first baseball game. In 1932, having secured his bacca- laureate, he attended Wayne Uni- versity where he secured his Mas- ter's Degree. For the next ten years he taught Physical Training in h1gh schools in northern Michigan. Zenti started his Navy career as a Chief Specialist on March 29, 1942. His first assignments, in Tampa, Norfolk and WllliamBburg. were the training of SeaBee units in military tactics as well as P.T. His most interesting assignments proved to be at the Mobile Re- ceiving Station. Here he was oppo- site the drydocks where battered ships were repaired and new ones built.

Electrical Engineers Delve in Television Last Thursday, Apl'il 6, the WRGB Television Studio played host to a large ·group of Union electrical engineering students un- der the supervision of Profess.or Bibber. The entire studio was open for close observation of the com- plex mechanism of television. Preceding the broadcast, which commenced at 2100, the technical principles of this field were ex- plained by experienced operators. Influenced by the charming personality of Professor Bibber. Many interesting aspects of broad- casting were explained and discuss- Ejd by the announcer, the lovely Miss Helen Rhodes, of Michigan State. The broadcast, an hour in dura- tion, was very interesting and en- joyable. Singing and tap dancing domiated the major portion of the broadcast. Following the broadcast, a film showing the principles of television broadcasting from the studio to the J'eceiving set at home was exhibit- eel. In addition, the operation, or- ganization, and structure of the control room of the studio was ex- plained to the student group by the ope1·ators. This proved to be an evening of enjoyment and great in teres! to all who attended.

V-5 News: New Men Have Been Under Fire l!~ifteen new V-5 cadets, transfers from the University of Pennsyl- vania, have arrived at Union Col- lege. All of these men-thirteen of whom are Marines-have been in the service at least eighteen months, and all have seen action, mostly in the South Pacific thea- tre. In the group is one en~ign, who resigned his commission in the Navy to become a V-5 cadet. The young pilots come f1·om many sections of the country, including the states of Minnesota, Wisconsin, Oregon, Texas, California, New Jer- sey, and Connecticut. For the first time since the es- tablishment of the V-5 Unit at Union a gl'oup of cadets went through without a single failure. The ·honored group is the 44I group, which was tested last Fri- day.

This terrible foursome swore t0 a solemn pact last semester not to say \Here sir\ whenever Prof. Herrick called the roll in his Eng- lish 25 class.

Dming- this presentation there was so much noise that it was hard to hem· some of the softe1· parts of the Fugue and the Spring So11g. Some of us enjo;y this music and ~•ppreciate the fine tickling· which Dr. Tidmarsh g·i ves the ivories and would be thankful if those who don't like the music would fall asleep and not bother the rest. We remember when, not so long- ago, Dr. Tid- marsh had to interrupt the Bumble Bee in the middle of his Flig-ht to request that the audieNce remain a little quiet. Last term there was a drive put on to reduce the noise in Chapel but it doesn't seem to have had much effect. Those in the back rows and also, we think, Dr. Tidmarsh would appreciate any letup in the racket that goes on. This applies to Navy and civilian students alike.

Track Candidates Aust will battle it out for the crown. Picozzi drew a bye straight into the finals while Aust previously downed Mannis. wHI bring together Harry King and 0 • £ • t d Charlie Matthews. Both of these ampazgn lS. e About this time of year around Dutchmanville it becomes some mrhwcky guy's joll to stick his neck out and take a few flyers as to who's going to come out of the finals alive and who isn't. So here goes: \Vt,estling Report Monday; Says Coach Ketz Competing for the 135 pound class championship will be Ward and Lambert, the latter having scuttled Stenehjem and Jones, and the fm·- mer having taken decisions from Howe and DonneJ.ly. entries have copped two previous Tl7 decisions. By 'Hal' rr ittner Hempton-Bla.nchard The second match on the even- ing's program will be in the 145-148 pound weight division, where Bob Hempton wiH .face Fletcher Blan- chard. Hempton and Blanchard have ·both worked their respective ways into the finals by means of two victories apiece, In the next division, one of the best men te show in the toJ;rna- ment to date, Troland, a V-5 cadet, who has pinned all three of his opponents, will tangle with Pracht. This weight class had the largest number of entrants and both men had a good chance to show of what they are capable and to prove their merit to the fullest degree. Ca11Ison vs. Firra \Hank\ Carlson will grapple Pete Firra in the 165-168 pound weight class. The former has al- ready defeated Keneally and Breu- ninger, where the latter has gain- ed his way into the finals by means of two defaults. In what should be one of the most interesting matches of the evening, Page, a V-5, will exchange holds with Hal Boroson in the 175- 178 section. Both men have two victories behind them, Page gain- ing a shot at the title by stopping Fox and Boroson by .downing Whitmore. As thes€ men have styles that are somewhat different, plenty of action is anticip~ted. Iieane, Stecka Heavies The final match, the heavy- weight class, presents Stecka, an- other V-5 cadet, and \Crusher\ Keane. Stecka has pinned both of his ·previous foes, Callanan and Fritze while Keane earned his berth 'by stopping Beyer! and gain- ing a default from Bill Olin, pre- tourney favorite for heavyweight king.

The Dutchmen are slated to run off the first three contests on Alex- ander Field, the first match against Middlebury on April 29, the second one against Rochester on May 3, and the last ·Of the first series of three against Ho1bart on May 6. In these contests ·Coach Al Ciampa hopes to find the winning combina- tion to take along with him on the road trips. On May 10 the Garnet will make the first road trip--to Rochester-- for the second game of the home- and-home series between the two schools. After this tussle, the Dutchmen will meet the Williams- men on the latters' home diamond on May 13. The Union squad will again take to the road to battle Williams away on May 24, and will conclude the season playing Middlebury and Ho- bart away on June 7 and June 10, respectively. The complete schedule arranged so far is as follows: Apr. 29-Middlebury, here. May May May May May June June 3-Rochester, here. 6-Hobart, here. 10-Rochester, away. 13-- Williams, here. 24--Williams, away. 7-Middle.bury, away. 10-Hobart, away. In the 135\138 pound class, we'll take King over Matthews, lly virtue of his more impressive victories earlier in the tournament. Moving on to the 145 pounders, our money goes on Blanchard, although this bout promises to be a close one. \Hank\ Carlson gets our vote in his bout with Pete Firra in the 165-l68 pound class, and if you'd ask us we'd say that Page will give Hal Boroson the bu~iness in the 175-178 pound division. What appears to be one of the most hotly-contested matches on the card is in the heavyweight class, where Stecka of the V-5 aggregation takes on. \Crusher\ Keane. Thi~ is going to be tough, but we'll sink the cash on Stecka. Oh, yes, we overlooked the 155 pounders. This is a tough one to pick, but our choice after much deliberation is Troland, although Pracht impressed us as being fast, tough. and a good all-around grappler. Boxing We'll take Vinnie Picozzi to pound out a victory over Aust in the 126-pound .class, and in the 135-po.und division \Curley\ Ward gets our vote. Lou Zangari looks to us to b~ the winner over Zwiren in the 155 pound class, thanks to his heavy-duty dght-hand wallop. As for the 145-pounders, we'll give Wise the nod over \Spider\ Ernie Fearn. The Bazar-Schwartz tussle in the 165-pound class promises to be a corker. with the two contenders both sluggers extraordinary. Schwartz with his hard left hook against Bazar's one-two routine- hmmmm. We'll take a complete flyer on this one and put the cash on Harvey Bazar. Because of Coyle's better showing in the semifinal round, we'll give him the nod over Sullivan in the 175-pound weight division. Now for the heavyweights-our vote goes to Bob Stegemann. His opponent, Peters, seems to laclr the ease and facilities of the rea- head's motion, and also will probably be handicapped by his lack of speed, aHhough he owns a dangerous right. It was good last week to see the old familiar face of Art Law- rence, ex-Garnet grid and baseball coach, again roaming the campus. SULLIVAN'S GRILL Known For Our Hospitality ... TO ...

The Commander left the Unit in ship-shape appearance which was a credit to his fine ex- ect: tive abilities. Comma·nder Horner graduated from Yale-Sheffield Scientific School in 1913. At college he was a member of the gun team that maintained a superior record. It was in this way that Horner start- ed out on the intereeting career which brought him to Union last July 1st. St>rvt>d in World War I During the first World War he served in the Army Air Corps, en- tPring in May 1917 and serving un- til December 1919. Following this tour of duty, Commander Hornet remained in the Army Air Corps Reserve until 1923. He holds mem- bership in the Aero Club of Amer- ica and the Institute of Aeronau- tical Sciences. From 1937 to 1942 he was Commissioner of the Illinois Aeronautical CommisEJion. He has always been active in aeronautics and holds a private pilots license. American Legion Organizer After the last war, the Captain was active in the American Legion. He is listed as one of the Charter Members of that organization and was instrumental in fot·ming a post in Chicago. He is also a member of the Forty and Eight honorary Club of the Legion. Prior to enter- ing Naval service Commander Hor- ner was a Director of the National American Wholesale Grocers Asso- ciation and held an important posi- tion as a Ca:ptain, in the National Home Defense Corps. Commissioned in 1942 His present Naval career started on March 9th, 1942 when he receiv- ed his commission. Commander H~rner served his indoctrination period at the Great Lakes Naval Training Station. After receiving this preliminary training, the Com-. mander was attached to the Chi- cago office of the Office of Naval Officer Procurement. At this sta- tion he was the Senior Interview- ing, Reviewing, and Forwarding Officer. As was stated above the Com\ mander's new assignment has not as yet been released, but with his past enviable record established both in Chicago and here at Union, the success of any new duty he will assume is self-evident.

St. Rose Concert Is Well Received Monday night in Memorial Chapel, St. Rose Alumnae of Sche- nectady presented the College Glee Club under the direction of Frank Walsh. The program began at 8:30 with a stirring rendition of \The Star Spangled Banner\ followed by four hymns including the beautiful Elijah Chorus by Mendelssohn. At the conclusion of these, .a blonde beatty, answering to the title of Claire LaDeau, appea.red and pro- ceeded to give the ivories such a tickling as they haven't received in a long while. This glamorous crea-. ture was succeeded by two equa.Jly attractive young ladies who gave out with some really solid vocal duets. In. the third set before intermis- sion, four light numbers were sung, among the best of which was \Let My Song Fill Your Heart\.. This was well arranged and very well put across. After intermission the audience was treated to a modern version of \Rock-a-bye-Baby\ that was really on the ball.

How- ever, we finaH~· became accustomed to the fact that if we wanted to <:ommunicate with someone whom we would not 1·eadily meet on the ~:ampus, we \\·oulcl take an envelope, paste on it a three cent stamp, drop it in the reg- ular mailbox, ,,nd in about till ee to f~our days, we would receive an iHlS\\'el· in the same man- net·. This methocl is undoubtedly ridiculously complicated, and it would ue of great help to everyone if we \\'ould establish our o\\'n cnm- pus mail system. · 1 f The boys of North Middle han• excellent and perhaps their on y means o adoi)tPd this as their motto: \GN- Suggestion-a-the-Week: H o w communication with other students.

The Sport I i ght GEORGE HAAS Among the new trainees report- ing to Union Col'lege last November was George Haas- of Montclail·, New Jersey, who arrived here di- rect from Newpot·t News Naval Station where he held the rate of Stot·ekeeper, 3rd class. Within a short time it became appar·ent to his mate:> that a real athlete was in their midst. Haas started out in the field of sports at Seton Hall Prep School in New Jersey. There he held down first base and centet· field during his junior and senior years, respec- tively. However, he was not in- active through the long winter months as he played two yeats of varsi.ty basketba.Jl on one of the classiest teams in the state. Out- side of school he played American Legion baseball with Montclair, which team copped the North Jer- sey Championship in 1941.

The audience's reactions to their efforts attested to the long road of improvement over which the band has traveled in the past eight months. Shortly after the V-12 azrival in July, two Bmall bands were organ- ized by Don Mullen and Bob Breit- inger. Mullen's band played in a chapel program using Jack Hill on sax, Bill O'Breien, clarinet, Karl Greenhut, tt·umpet, Bob Owen on piano, and Mullen playing drums. This chapel program was remem- bered for a red hot rendition of, \The Shiek of Araby.\ The student body liked the program so well that the band was asked to return for another engagement. At the time Mullen asked Breitinger to play in the second program with his band. O'Brien, Mullen and Breitinger, worked together getting men from the Unit to form a larger band, which would play both sweet and swing. Due to the lack of musical talent In the Unit at that time this band did not come into effect until the new contingent of men arrived in November. This first dance band included on its roster Bunsick, Breitinger, Young, and O'Brien, who played saxes; trumpets were Forbes Lynch, and Graham, trombone.s, Fellendorf, LaFountain, Mullen on drums, Rivetti, tickling the ivories, Gates, guitar, and Liedecker, bass. Vocalists at this period in the band's history were Matland, Wise, Fitzpatrick. The original outfit had many en- gagements inclt:ding a five week spot on the USO program over WSNY, an engagement at the Officers Club .by request of Com- mander Horner, a dance at the Marine Barracks by request of Colonel Marlowe, and playing at the Travelers Aid convention which was held at the YMCA in Schenec- tady. The band was also heard at the first Navy smoker in January. was held last Tuesday and officers were elected·. Bob Breitinger was selected as leader. L. Bunsick, Mu- sic Director, and D. Mullen, busi- ness manager. For this tez m the V-12 Dance band has already scheduled sev- eral engagements which include a Chapel program May lOth and a USO dance on the 20th of May.

Mullen played with Bobby Sherwood, Corl{y Babcock with Van Alexander, and Bunsick was offered a job with Les Brown. Ken Forbes was formerly studying mtsic at Penn State. Much of the credit for the organ- ization of the band must be given to Lt. G. Y. Taylor for his cooper- ation in obtaining orchestrations and his musical assistance. The Panthers, also uncorking<S>- their '44 season tomorrow, boast a Dutchmen, and he's scheduled to bat sixth in the lineup.

l I FRIDAY, .APRIL 28 1944 3 Hope to Get Softball Loop Under Way MayS-·'Champ' THE B llG E PUMP Ciampa Reveals Colorful, Varied Sports Background Now that the intramural boxing and wrestling tournaments have ·drawn to a close and everything but varsity sports have hit the bottom of the barrel, a young man's thoughts lightly turn to another outlet iu the form of more intramural sports -softba:ll, tennis, horseshoes, and~---------------­ maybe bowling. ATHLETIC' FIELD I called Delta Chi Field, because of . . . its location near the Delta Chi Chmbmg over the beaten and broken bod1es spl'awled over If the weatherman decides to give our softball-minded colleagues a chance, it is very likely, accord- ing to iht~amural director AI Ci- ampa, that we will soon see many a pmmising team ta:ke the field in quest of another intraim:ral crown., Ciama reportedly is working on a softball schedule and says that he The Sportlight BOB STEGEMANN It was suggested by Jess Perkins this week and we'd like to .forward the idea to the student body and to the Athletic Department-Late in July, when Mel Rein calls for grid candidates and pigskin prac- tice begins, there's going t0 be a shortage of, among other things, athletic fields around :butchman- vHle.

It is expected at the present time that there will be fourteen teams in the intramural circuit. It is hoped also that there will be an intramural track tournament to take place about the first of May. If possible this tour- ney will be held in the evening as will the softball tournament and the runners from the competing houses should see their intramural managers sometime in the very near future about singing up to participate in this sport. As for the tennis tournament- much desire for such a tournament has been expressed by several members of the student body, and With the school already getting tennis court repairs under way it probably won't be long now! Much talk has also been flying about over the rumored bowling tournament, and in some of the Navy ships much enthusi~sm ?as been exhibited along this lme. Many of the men were getting their bowling eyes in condition last Saturday night at a local trundling emporium and a few of them ap- peared pretty sharp. If the neces- sary arrangements can be made, such as arrangements for finding a suitable time, a place where al- leys would be .available, and of course the ever present question of getting permission to get off campus during other than the spe- cified liberty hours, the tourneys will be held. In Schenectady It's for Shirts I BOB STEGEMANN With the opening gun of track season only three weeks away, Coach Ketz has been critically eying his up and coming track squad. The resl!llts of his search find many weak spost in the quar- ter, half, and mile positions. High- land is in good candition and will be of great use in the building up of these positions. Webster will also find plenty of wmk ahead of him in the sprints and dashes. The hurdlers will be Eddy, Christopher- son. Morrow. and McFate. In the hip.-b jumps Thurston will get the call to duty as will Galligan. Cal- Inman and Green have been work- ing on the shot pat and the javelin position is wide .open with not too many prospects to fiH the blank space. Coach Ketz is searching for a few strong arm men to try out for this position and will welcome any .candidate with the necessary arm and willingness to Jearn the art. Discus throwing has very little prospects at the present time al- though a talented thrower may turn up between now and May 20 of V-1Z trainees. Since then he -so hopes Coach Ketz.

CIRCULAR BOXING RINGS vVe spotted something of note in n West Coast newspaper the other day -·- a prominent West Coa:sot sports editor and boxing enthusi- j ast has proposed a plan to several boxj.ng commissions whereby cir- cular boxing rings be substituted for the square ones now in use. The purpose of it all is to do away with the fatal and near-fatal beat- ings some fighters absorb when trapped in corner and can't get away from the sometimes-lethall bJ.ows coming their way. . The sport would have to be revolutionized in order to absorb such a plan, but the more we think about it, the more reasonable it becomes. ~, COACH AL CIAMPA of the lowly freshman position and became a high and mighty sopho- mm·e, he turned out for football again, this time being switched to center under the tutoring of the famous Columbia mentor, Lou Lit- tle. An unfmtunate incident occur- red during that season-Champ suffei ed a concus::,ion that incapa- citated him during the rest of the year and prohJ.bited his participa- tion on the g·rid squad during the 1932 campaign also. During the preceding spring, that 0f 1931, AI filled a guard's spot on the Frosh basketball team, which experience no doubt accounts for that dead- eye one-hand push shot of his. In 1933 and 1934 Champ moved on to the big time. He was selected the pivot man on Coach Little's grid squad of those years, and traveled to the West Coast with the '34 squad to play Bobby Gray- son and Co. of Stanf01 d in the Rose Bowl. AI claims that day was the hottest day he's ever sweated out anywhere, and the game itself was described by famed sports writer Bill Corum as \the gi·eatest I've ever seen.\ In Corum·~ ac- count of the tussle he holds noth- ing but high praise for \bespec- tacled AI Ciampa.\ Champ became a football coach at his alma mammy the day he played his last football game there, and served as assistant line coach, center coach and scout at Colun:ibia during the campaigns of post of the Coiumbia University 1935, 1936, 1937 and 1938. freshman eleven-he also ran at In the spring of 1935 AI took a the blocking back spot during the shot at the horsehide and wound same year. up playing varsity shortstop with In 1931. when Champ moved out· (Continued on Page 4) The University TEA ROOM House Breakfast - Luncheon - Dinner Sunday Dinner 838 UNION STREET We Cater for Parties We'll Beat Middlebury Saturday; ~I Then ~o dorun and play the game over at the :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::m:::m:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::m::::::mm:::::::::m::::::::::::::::::::::::::i Van Curler Tap Room ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::m::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::m:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
