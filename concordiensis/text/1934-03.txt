The under- O'raduates of Union are anxious to become 0 ' well acquainted with the gentleman who 1s to be our next president and also the high and preparatory school men who may be among our ranks within a few short months. The sentiment of the various agencies of the college has been one of great pride for the past \Veek at the realization that one of America's foremost scholars and historians has be~m chosen to guide the destinies of Union in the future. Students, faculty, ad- ministration, townspeople, and alumni will be present at the Spencer Lecture this evening to make their first acquaintance with Dr. Fox. Such a gathering upon such an occa- sion is certain to make tonight's one of th.e, most colorful lectures ever attended by those who will be present. We are happy that you are able to be with us so soon after your election, Dr. Fox, and we hope that you find the spirit of Union at its highest point.

The ti- PUT THEM IN THE BY-LAWS William Allison Shimer, secretary of the united chapters of Phi Beta Kappa, answer- ed several arguments which have been raised against the policies of the national honorary academic society in an article which appear- ed in Sunday's edition of the New York Times. He pointed out whereby several steps have been taken toward the broaden- ing of eligibility qualifications for member- ship, amon;g them being the one raised by De. Ellery at the recent dinner of the Upper Hudson Association of Phi Beta Kappa. .1\Ir. Shimer stated that thet·e have bel:n cases of students declining membership 'on the ground that the methods of selection have sometimes excluded bl'illiant scholars and included various types of \grade-getters\ who were in no sense of the word scholars.' The 119 chapters of the societ;r have as many sets of rules for selecting members. About half of the chapte1~s insist on grades as the sole basis, for, they say, any other criteria would be subjective and open to wire-pulling. The Phi Beta Kappa senate recently ap- p!1oved the report of a committee of distin- guished scholars who have recommended that the proportion of the graduating class which will he eligible for membership be re- duced from twenty-five per cent to ten per cent, and that the minimum average grade requirement of eigthy-five per cent be set w;ide in special cases.

A plea for concentrated study is a chord too often struck without any appreciable effect. Concentra- tion does not mean or imply a con- slant ~truggle with intellectual p1oblems, nor d'oeo; it mean such appJ.ication that no amount of ex- t<'lior tumult or noise may dio>tur.b the student. It rather means a culm mental application which will inev-itably lead to an interest in the bouk before one. Libraries, orig- inally halls for concent1·ation, have ve11· often in the American college lost this meaning, and have bec·ome book-lined rooms for conversation. The quiet which reigns in Amed- ca ·.,. mo:st beautiful and most com- plete library, the Library of Con- gre~s. furnishes an example which migtit well be followed by every college library. The evils of child labor me so genet ally acknowledged that both the suppm teu:: and foes of 1 a tifi- cation make it plain that they a1 e opposed to this form of ex,plcita- tion.

RERULTS OF THE POLL The results of the poll conducted recently in Daily Assembly are most gratifying if considered seriously. There is no shadow of doubt that the Student Body as a whole took the questions seriously with the result that we now kno·w \\'hat is popular, what is not, what is read by many and what is read by few. These are the things we were most anx- ious to find out. :\lany good f'\Uggestions were offered. There was little destructive criticism. Every one of these suggestions will be considered most carefully, and something will be done It would be extremely wise for the national council of Phi Beta Kappa to amend the gen~ eml hnvs according to the above recommen- dations. Such laws would reflect the recog- nition of the fact that the present grading system employed by American colleges and universities is Mthing more than an ancient, shopworn tradition that needs a general housecleaning. The pressure for the consid- eration of students' personal qualities and inteeest in their studies is increasing with fervor throughout the educational world. It would he highly fitting for Phi ,Beta Kappa, the :zenith of scholastic hon.ors in academic work, to set the example and for college fac- ulties to follow suit. 000 One of DE.'an Pound's favor- ite epigrams: \Few ·things are morf' ephemeral than information.'' 000 Well, they ,.;ay the bacl1bone of winter is just about brol1en, and a lot of shovE.'lers report the :,;arne thing about their·s. IGNOTUS. -----·0--- Week's Best Editorials \EDUCATION FOR QUALITY\ In his Phi Beta Kappa address on the subject, \Education for Qual- ity.\ Professor Donald Davi·dson €mphasized the .great need of the American college of a reversion, at least partial, to the study of the humanities. He acknCYW!edged the vitality of the relationship between the sciences ·and the broader hu- manities. and nbserved that quality can not exist where either is exclud\ ed. The widespread domination of the arts and letters by practical science constitutes the greatest 'Problem of today in regard. to sub- Ject matter in the modern college.

It su1 ely 1s no :::.unday-scnool picnic as L,,aJor 'J.'inlter would have u:s be- lieve. .h-rax told me that his \soft- e;:.t job was that of tlymg trom the aviauon post, some thirty miles be- hind tne front, across the enemy lines to mal{e observations of any nocturnal movements of the Allies. by making his approach at an alti· tude of several t11.ousand feet, \cut- ting\ the motor and soaring quietly down to within a few hunared teet of the ground, he was able to note any suspicious lights and even hear the advance of troops and equip- ment and the movement of heavy a1 ttllery. After having recorded his observations and established his positon, he would return to his post and land with nothing but a green Uare to guide him. The next day pictures would be taken of that same territory and checked with those previously taken in order to detect any changes in the land- scape. 'l'his type of observation flying was what Shider called his \soft- est\ job. And it was done in the black of night with neithel' radio beams nor lights of any kind to guide him-nothing but a compass and a more or less imperfect alti- tude finder.

Dr. Dewey maintained that if the New Leisure made possible by tech- nological advancement is intelli- gently utillzed, the quality of our civilization can be t•aised to a level hitherto only dreamed of, in its social as well as economic aspects. 3: 00-Fencing, Union vs. Wil- liams. 6:30-Dinner 7:30--Interfraternity Basketball game. 8:30-Basketball, Union vs. R.

They are on -the round table in the 7 center of the Library opposite the 8 Librarian's desk. 9 The most widely used of Dr. 10 Fox's books is the set entitled \His- 11 , tory of American Life\ of which he 12 was co-editor with Arthur M. Schle- 13 inger. T-he History department has found this set .to be of great value to them in reference. A newer set has been purchased recently, called \New York State Historical Asso- ciation Series\ which is expected to become as popular as the aforemen- tioned set. Dr. Fox was advisory editor of a fifteen volume set of \Pageant of America\. He prepared for publi- ' cation Herbert L. Osgood's \Amer-/ ican Colonies in the Eight~cnth Century\. Osgood is a fellow pt o- 1 fessor of Dr. Fox's in Columbia Uni-/ versity's History Department. As for the books that Dr. Fox has 1 written and published himself, they! are many and well 1 ead.. They in- 1 elude: \Decline of Aristocracy ia: the Politic,; of New Yorl:\ \Har- 1 per's Atlas of American Histmy\ \Caleb Heathcote--Gentleman Col- 1 onist\ and in a book called \As-J pects of Social History of America\ he wrote the chapter \Are We Bet- ter than Our Ancestors?\.

There is no ques- tion that the weather conditions of the past week have been unusual to say the least. There is some excuse for the regrettable loss of life and equipment in the Army's attempt to meet another one of the emer- gencies which Roosevelt has cre- ated. The Republicans call it umurder .. \ cause eking out an existence has as teacher of Mathematics, Latin consumed so much energy. \Of and Greek in the Newton Collegiate course we can not all reach the Institute of Newton, N.

In the fullness of time l.;;ev-: eta! thousand ye'inl the Chtic,tian religion took form --an improve- ment, \Ve hold, on what had PIe- ceded. Something better ror man in the way of its expression may be r·e,vealed in the .uourse of time- something that will advance the spirit of the individual and of the t•ace, more effectively than present day religious forms .. We must be prepared to adopt it when it comes, but until then, accept with satis- faction what we have. Dr. Ellery believes that religion and science should ·both alike Fecog\ nize and acknowledge their limita- tions. The true scientist refrains from making any assumptions out- side the field of his own researches. Religion is challenged ·by science to acknowledge its limitations. Re- ligion unc·overs no facts about the physical universe, offers no solu- tion ,of the problems of heredity, makes no attempt to explain the relationship of mind and body. ONE STRONG SYSTEM But despite the inclemency of weather, both the explanations of the Army chiefs and the blunder- ings of the individual pilots who welcome the opportunity to show the world \w:hat they can do\ indi- cate only too plainly that the Army Air Force is frightfully inefficient and totally incompetent to meet any emergency. The mail routes throughout the country are mapped for both compass direction and irregularities in the P.'round surface. The various fields are lighted up like Christmas trees and powerful arc lights send their beams for many miles. In addition, radio beams are projected on both sides of the air lane to guide the \blind\ pilot along the route between them. Yet the flying of the mails is an \impossible task\ for the Army pilots. If this does not constitute a complete acknowledgement of in- competency, then blaclt is white. Next War in Air The next war,-and it may not be very far off-will be fought in the air. That unit of the national de- fense whbh should be the strongest is the Weakest. General Mitchell said this years ago.

Likewise, the study of the Bible may be considered comparable to that of history if l'ead as a biog- raphy. On the other hand, if the Scriptures were to be read a.t5 col- lections of historical facts, one would become very ,bored by them. The boolts of the Bible may repre- sent various periods or phases in man's development, such as the Book of Psalms which symbolize a period of wisdom, or the New Test- ament which creates a man, who, before the coziness of his log fire, struggles with the pro·blems of his soul. In conclusion, he schowed how the study of history or the Bible might be made interesting if read in the light of biographies. when he went to the First Presby- terian Church of Cambridge as pas- tor. In 1893, Dr. Beattie was called to the pastorate of the First Presby- terian Church of Mankato, Minne- sota. In June 1899, he resigned his pastorate for a year abroad. Five months of this year were spent in volunteer work in the slums of London in connection with the West London Mission under the leader- ship of Mark Guy Pears-e and Hugh Price Hughes. After seven more months on the continent, Dr. Beat- tie· returned to the United States with his family and was invited to talte up work similar to the West London Mission in New York by Dr. Charles H. Parkhurst and the Madison Square Presbyterian Church. For the past 32 years, Dr. Beattie has continued in this work as the pastor and superintendent of the Madison Square Church House, a large and encouraging sphere of social activities on a purely Gospel basis where there are from sixty to se~enty different •activities each month in practical application of the the teachings of Jesus to the lives of men, women, children, Many Mysteries Science and religion are alike in that each is full of unexplained mysteries. What the scientist does not yet know is the exact nature of the forces and energies about him. What is true of science is true of religion. There may be a law of the survival of the fittest in biology, but not in human sociology. Man has assumed the responsi-bility of caring for the menta!J.y defective and the insane. Why not let them die? Science would; religion will not. Modern science does not account for such public institutions· as the Louvre and the British MUGeum, or the common support of the intel- lectual training of those not paying taxes. Religion has given evidence of an urge from within that is not scientific. \The two realilliS, scientific and religious,\ concluded· Dr. Ellery, \are distinctly separate. And yet they are closely related, for In both the mental attitudes should be the same.\ Welded together by common policies and ideals, the 27 Bell System companies work as one.

Elliot Hatfield in the Alumni gymnru;ium. Although -his star pitcher and catcher of last year have been graduated, the men reporting now show even more promise. Coach Hatfield is beginning his third year a£ head -baseball eoach. Jim Loomis, a junior, is the only veteran pitcher on the squad. Loomis saw little service in the box la.st .season, which was occu- pied so brimantly by Bus Dill, heavy hitting twirler. Guy Griswold, a sophomore, is the other strong pitching prospect. Griswold last year, as a freshman, .pitc-hed to the varsity in practice games and, al- though no official score was kept uf ·the::;e gamer:;, his speed and change of pace had the Garnet ba-f- fled. Clark Reports Other ·pitching candidates include George Clark, southpaw first base- man of last year. Clark has a strong left arm and may be used as relief twirler when not on first base where he starred last year. Harold Ellithorn, a senior, and two sopho- mores, Doug Lambeth and Gene Hull, fill out the list of pitching candidatefS_ The only veteran catcher return- ing is AI Rapalee, who was a cap- able assistant to the hard hitting P.ed Ackley, who held the Garnet catching berth f'Or three years_ John Sawicki and AI Stevenson, both members of last year's freshman squad, also rported to Hatfield. These men will -be strong aspirants for the position behind the plate. ---0---- Bnow Train for North Creek To Leave Schenectady Sunday A snow train, the first of its kind ever made up in New York Sta,te, will leave Schenectady Sunday morning at 8-:15 for North Creek, a skiing center in the heart of the Adirondack Mountains. This train, sponsored .by the Schenectady Win- ter Sports Club will remain all day on a sidin-g within easy walking distance of goQd skating conditions, mountain trails for snowshoeing and some of the best ski runs i~ the east. If enough students obtain tickets, a special car will be re- served for them. The train will reach Schenectady about 8:00 o'clock Sunday night. Round trip tickets may be obtained on the campus for $1.50 from Arthur Plum- mer, Sigma Phi Place . other noted sports authority proba- bly will be picked. Acting Pres- ident Edwa:rd Ellery will also be one of the speakers. Last year, at the sixth annual dinner, Coach Andy Kerr of Colgate was the prin- cipal speaker, while George Daley, Sports Editor of the New York Hera! Tribune, was toastmaster. Daley, of the class of '92, is the originator of the annual dinners and presided at the first, on May 10, 1928. The headliner at that banquet of nearly six: years ago was the late Knute Rockne. Roc- kne had not reached his pinnacle at that time, but directly after that year he became one of the fore- most football coaches of all time. In 1929 the Terrace Council pre- sented Bill Roper, former Princeton gridiron coach, as the main speaker, and 'I homas A. Crighton, '98, as toastmaster. Walsh Spoke in 1980 For the 1930 dinner the Terrace Council introduced Adam Walsh, captain of the great 1924 Notre Dame eleven and then line coach at Yale_ The speaker in 1931 was John B. (Jock) Sutherland from the University of Pittsburgh, where he was head football coach_ At that banquet former President Frank Parl{er Day made his fa- mous plea for \athletics for all.\ It was with this idea that a few months previously he had attacked college athletic pro-fessionalism, which was heatedly discussed throughout the United States. In 1932 Bill Bingham, director of ath- letics at Harvard, provided an ex- cellent main speech. Lou Little stands today as the outstanding football coach of the country_ When he came to Colum- bia from Georgetown he had in- herited a complete wreck from the previous regime. He made no promises at that time, but there was vast ground to be covered in the improvements. Now, at the end of four years of his reign, the gen- ial Mr_ Little has accomplished what observers in 1930 said would take a generation's work on the Morningside campus in New York City. Won Twenty-sevl'>n Games Since he took over the coaching duties at Columbia his elevens have turned in twenty-seven victories and two ties in thirty-five engagements. This year's team, despite its early season setback by the clawing Ti- gers of Princeton, is regarded as his most powerful product. Their first victory this year was scored over Lehigh, 39 to 0- The stubborn University of Virginia team was de- feated 15 to 6, but the following week Princeton scored its 20 to 0 win. The Lion then routed Penn State, 33 to 0, as Little completely revised his team. Scored in Rose Bowl Tilt Cornell was the next Lion victim to the score of 9 to 6, while Navy supplied the nex:t prey for the now hungry Dion. Pennsylvania was the next victim and the regular season ended in a blaze of glory with a 16 to win over Syracuse. Following this game the Rose Bowl authorities invited Little and his Lions to meet Stanford on New Year's Day. The invitation was ac- cepted and Columbia won the con- test, 7 to 0 .

The problem of control- ling speculation, or more aecurate- ly, excessive speculation, is a very difficult one. A survey of a few of the problems involved brings out the significance and the aims of regulation. What Is Speculation?

For exam·ple, Dr. Meeker, economist of the New York Stock Exchange, has given a definition which has aroused the ire of Mr. J. T. Flynn, a member of the brain trust. And Mr. Pratt, another authority, has definedspec~ation in a~ill iliffe~ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ent way. The difficulty seems to - be in determining the difference, if any, between speculation and in- vestment. One interpretation is that speculation is the buying and selling of securities for the purpose of reaping a profit from pl'ice fl.uc- tuations. Investment, on the other hand, is the ,buying and selling of securities for the purpose O·f deriv- ing an income from dividends. Al- though a person might be .both a speculator and an investor if we accept these definitions, the fact remains that the definitions are as close to determining the difference in the two transactions as we can hope to get. The second pro.blem that arises is whether we want to retain spec- ulation. This brings us to its func- tions. Fundamentally, the priee of a security is based upon an esti- mate of the future earnings of the corporation represented by that security. Now when a temporary cause makes a security stand at a price either higher or lower than it should normally have, that is, if its price does not represent as closely as pos.sible an estimate of the ,prob- able future earnings of that corpor- ation, the opportunity for profit arises. When prices fall too low, speculators \'bull\ the market, and when they rise too high, they \bear'' the market, The result is to bring the price of the security into closer relation to its real value. In other WOl'ds, the price of the security tends to reflect more closely the real value of the enterprise it repre- sents. Speculator Assumes Risks If we examine this function close- ly we see that the speculator per- forms a specialized, risk-bearing function for which the community is willing to pay. Whether we want to retain speculation depends upon whether we want to encourage spe- cialized risk-bearing. There is noth- ing inimical or harmful in the bear- ing of risk, since risk is an inher- ent element of our economic system. It is o;bvious, therefore, that spec- ulation performs a beneficial eco- nomic function. theoretically. It may be excessive or insufficient, mis- taken in its estimate of future val- ues, and indulged in by unqualified persons. In short, it is S'Ubject to abuse. Yet its pos.ftion in our pres- ent economic svstem is secure. The next problem closely follows. Inasmuch as speculation is a dis- tinct part of our economic system, should we control it? And this brings us to its evils. Apart from the effects upon confidence, busi- ness, and credit, it is necessary to bear in mind the theory of how the whole process of speculation be- comes disastrous. If a speculator bases his judgment, not upon eco- nomic realities, but upon a guess, he ceases to pel'form his economic function. F.vr example, if he buys on margin, not because he thinks Call Ball X For better and quicker Service in Clothes Cleaning and Shoe Rebuild- Ing-at no higher cost than else- where. ONE DAY SERVICE ANY DAY UNION COLLEGE received its name from the circumstances that several religious denom- inations cooperated in its organization in 1795. It was the first non-sec- tarian college in the United States and its charter still prohibits its con- • trol by any one church. The liberal spirit which marked its birth made Union a pioneer in ·educational reform. During the presidency of Dr. Eliphalet Nott, 1804 to 1866, there was added to the usual classical curriculum a scientific course in 1828, instruction in civil engineering was begun in 1845, and in 1854·, chemistry was placed upon a technical basis. Thus from an early date scientific and academic courses have run side by side at Union College, each making its own contribution to the intellectual life on the campus. Union College together with its graduate departments in Albany, twelve miles distant, constitutes Union University. The graduate depart- ments and the dates of their founding are: Albany Medical College, 1838; Albany Law School, 1851; Albany College of Pharmacy, 1881; and the Dudley Observatory. The undergraduate courses at Union lead to the following degrees: Bachelor of Arts Bachelor of Science Bachelor of Science In Chemistry Bachelor of Science In Civil Engineering Bachelor of Science In Electrical Engineering Bachelor of Science In Physics The Union campus of 97 acres, overlooking the Mohawk river and facing the Helderberg Mountains, is one of the beauty spots of the country.

The Schenectady Chess League won two gamP\ and the Poughkeepsie Chess Club one: the remaining game, of the four played, being un- finished, is to be adjudicated later. This match was begun Saturday, B'ebruary 24, and lasted a total of 141.\ hours, ending about mi-dnight last Saturday. The operators at the college station were W. Bradley Plummer, '36, W2CMI; George W. Tracy, '34, W2·EFU; and George Hobbs, '37, W2FLY. The Pough- keepHie station W2AXX, owned by Jamed White, was operated soley by Donald Love, W2BJX.

By CHARLES L. REED, ,JR. The Glee Club made its annual trip to New York last week-end, leaving Friday morning, and get- ting back Sunday at eight o'clock. The club got off to a relatively early Etart, leaving only half an hour late, and picked up Dr. Tidmarsh in Al- bany. The trip down was uneventful, except that shortly after lunch, which was eaten ih Poughkeepsie, the second bus ran off the road intp a deep snowdrift, and was stuck there for half an hour. After all at- tempts to push and pull it out with the other bus failed, it was finally towed out by the road scraper re- Bponsible for the mishap. Because of this delay, and the heavy traffic in upper New York, it was after four when the club finally arrived at the Hotel Pennsylvania. The concert. given in the Crystal Ballroom of the Ritz-Carlton, was very successful, to judge from the comments of the audience. Many of the audience who had been at the concert last spring said that the work of the club was much better than it was the previous year.

In- cluding the dozen or so sltiers who joined the train at Saratoga, there were nearly four hundred people on board, together with skis, snowshoes, n:nd toboggans, In North Creek there was a mad scramble as cohorts of Schenect:J.dians, armed with ski poles rnd snowshoes charged through a line of curious townspeople to a line of waiting buses. Fifteen minutes later the village streets were almost deserted while numerous buses and trucks packed with jumbled masses of arms legs vnd skis climbed steep mo~ntair{ roads to the heads of various ski runs or to practice slopes on open hillsides. Although the snow was sticky, the steeper runs were fast •'llough to throw more than one skier head first into deep drifts or plowing Jown hill with feet in the ? ir.

To the tune of wintry blasts, each member of the college grumbled about the temperature, which hit a new low point for this vicinity when the thermometer registered thirty degrees below zero. And as the wind whistled across the open spaces on the campus, the war-cry was: \If there's a breath of wind anywhere in the world, it's sure to be in front of the Union College library.\ Indeed that was more than true for before one could mount the library steps, he was obliged to run the gamut, so to speak, of the gusts of wind which howled down from the Rotterdam Hills from the west and the n to arrive in the building breathless and teary-eyed to the amusement of more fortunate ones already safely sheHered. Among other things, it may prove interesting to many, especially to those of Robert Ripley complex, that during the time some fifteen houses reported broken water pipes despite the fact that they were heated; that the college used one thousand eight hundred thirty-nine tons of coal up to February 18 in order to withstand the cold; that the many thousands of feet of un- derground pipe in the campus were pushed to capacity in transporting steam heat, and during the weelt ending February 11, two million five hundred and three thousand pounds of steam were used; that the college doctor has on record some dozen or fifteen cases of fro- zen ears, feet, and noses which he trE:ated; that in spite of all the handicaps of weather in general scholastic average rose during the time. How many of the students, however, are willing to undergo an\ other period of similar torture in order to keep up the marks is still a moot question.

The abolition of freshman in tevcol- legiate sports would remove the undue em- phas·is which too many freshmen place on athletics. Sports are placed more in the categury of reel eation rather than business, and a:thletics ar t• made ::;uboruinate to ::;chol- astic activities. The abolition of freshman intercollegiate sports would release the staff of the depart- ment of physic-al education for intramural work . .More attention could be given to .the men who would not compete for a position on a freshman or varsity team. More atten- tion could be given to those sports which can be enjcyed long after graduation. These carry-over activities-golf, tennis, swimming, handball, and squash-are of more value to the average student than football, lacrosse, ur track.

Because there is no other en- trance to the stage than through the audi- torium, the l\Iountebanks must make a choice between parading their acto.rs during the intermission down the aisle, and cooping up forty-two players and assistants in a space scarcely large enough for a dozen and eminl:!ntly desirable as a location for scenery and properties which are not used in the scene tha:t is being presented.

If all these colleg·es should abolish freshman sports, the three year rule would be doomed, and members of all four classes could compete in intercol- legiate sports. Until our neighbors take such action, however, there is nothing Union can do about the three year rule. Colleges not allowing fteshmcn to compete on their teams will not permit us to use first year men. The whole situation must be investigated carefully. The Council should find out ex- actly what our contemporaries are doing be- fore any action whatsoever is taken. BALONEY •. There is no question but that freshmen sports should be re-established here next year unless, as we have said a;bove, our com- petitors take the action they promised last year. Continuing further in the article ap- pearing in the issue of The Concordiensis of February 10, 1933, we find more facts. too-clean stokei·s of the preceding scenes.

Ault, head of Boston Univer- sity's history department, urges that the United States enter the World Court and sign the four- power pact. \The time has come,\ this histor- ian asserts, \when we must either arm ourselves to the teeth, or take practical measures to keep out of war. Positive, constructive leader- ship towardS ,peace is what we need. I believe that it would help to join the World Court, even at this late date. We might enter the four-power pact in Europe and make It a five-power pact. France would feel more secure.\ Co~yright, 1934, Tho American Tobacco Com\OanY From the Diamond Horse-Shoe of the Metropolitan Opera House Saturday at 1:50 P.

The Secretary's office declares that the week-end was the beginnin gof a worth while idea. It is hoped next year to send out invitations at an earlier date, and to include a wider range of terri- tory. The program ran smoothly enough, but there were a few slight hitches. The administration has already begun plans to rectify their mistakes and improve the program for next year. Approximately 115 secondary school students enjoyed their trip through the General Electric Com- pany's \House of Magic\ and the plant of American Locomotive Company Friday afternoon. That evening many of the sub-fresh- men attended the third lecture of the Spencer series given by Presi- dent-elect Dixon Ryan Fox under the auspices of the History De- partment. Saturday morning the secondary school boys learned through prac- tical experience how college classes are conducted. In Daily Assembly Acting-president Ellery delivered an address of welcome, and Assist- ant Professor Bronner of the His- tory Department spoke on the early history of Union, stressing particularly the position of honor that Union held among its early sister colleges. In the afternoon many boys witnessed a rehearsal of the entire forth-coming Mounte- bank production, \The Hairy Ape,\ by Eugene O'Neill. Some of the sub-freshmen watched the Union fencing team lose to Williams. \The week-end was <!uccessfully topped off by Cnion's victory over the R. P. I. basketball team,\ is the opinion of the Secretary's office. Official U. C. Photographers Portrait and Commercial Photographing THE WHITE !STUDIO 215 State Street U. C. Repre,;entative T.

Audience Is Amused by Many, Of Author's Serious Lines By PAUL WASSMANSDORF After six scenes of \The Hairy Ape'' the majmity of the audience seemed to 1ealize .that they were not witnessing a comedy. Both· Friday and Saturday nights the weB-washed people in Hanna Hall tittei crl g-leefully at thP crude and shocking language hmled at them 11om the <ltage. lJuling the seventh and finally at the last scene the audience appru ently discovered that t:lomething t:lerious was happening, that on the stage was a brute man fighting desperately against some- thing which he couldn't understand.

ELLITHORN Electrical Engineering Mr. Markman seemed to know what was going on, for his inter- pretation of his very difficul·t role was expertly done. He very care- fully built up his climaxes in the many long speeches he had, and he very capably used the powerful lines at his disposal to convey to the audience the turmoH that was taking place in the soul of Yank .. To play the part of Yanl!: required an intellectual grasp of 1his strug- gle that Yank can only sense but not understand. He comprehended his character and portrayed it skill- fully. Yank, of course, dominates the entire play. It was therefore ab- solutely necessary that this char- acter be played strongly and con- vincingly. Mr. Markman was equal to his difficult assignment. Yank is the \Hairy Ape\ he is the play; u.nd Mr. Markman was Yank. F. GERSINSICH Electrleal Eng·lneel'ing S. SIIIION Cltemlstry G • .A.. 1\IOORE B. s. in Chemistry F. TURNBULL 1\Iathematlcs W. T.

Most of them were very good, a few were excellent, and a few were bad. I would suggest that Mr. Berger leave off his mask. I see very little reason for his wear- ing one. The one best delivered line in the play was the \Go to hell.\ at the end of the seventh scene. The impression that Mr. Roylance gave with that phrase foretold the tone of the last scene. Despair and hopelessness were all that faced Yank. The last scene could not have been any different. \Go to hell\ could have been delivered in a fashion to get a laugh. But a laugh before the tragedy of the eighth scene would have been most unfortunate. The Audience is Amused Many of the earlier \hell's\ and \damn's\, and other things the Concordiensis won't print, the audi- ence giggled at like shocked high school girls. It was very easy and also very superficial for an audi- ence to laugh at the crudities of the language and the slang of sailors.

This program in- cludes the following three points: 1-The immediate adherence of the United States to the covenant of the League of Nations. 2-The nationalization and in- ternational co11trol of the sale and manufatcure of armaments. 3-The severance of all com- mercial relations with belligerent nations (so far as is compatible with the League covenant). \We have,\ says the Herald, \no false hopes that these meas- ures will proVide an absolute guar!l-ntee of peace, but we do be- lieve that they will help to allev- iate the present situation and present a foundation on which further peace efforts may be based.\ Union College students are asked to register their opinions in the poll on page 4.

Thompson, Profess·or of English at the New York State College for Teachers and President of the Upper Hudson Phi Beta Kap- pa Asso-ciation spoke to the newly elected members o.f the Union Chap- ter of Phi Beta Kappa at the initi- ation han.quet last nighrt in Silliman Hall. After the meal, Professor Thomp- son was introduced. His speech was amusing and in:teresting. He told the new members not to take them- selves too seriously, and tl\)at ac- cording to supposedly mathematical calculations, all Qf them would be famous some day and would pro~b­ ably be listed in \Who's Who\ if they weren't careful. He also stressed the need for an increased irrterest of academic men ln. politics, and aliso in education. Finally he advocated a tendency away from the hypocritical sophis- tication of many modern people, and towards a genuine sincerity. Allison P. Oreon of Albany, a graduate of the University of .Ala- bama, was among those initiated. The other initiates were: Julius J. 13itney, Henry W. Tulloch, Charles S. Bridgeman, Joseph B.

Bell, Honorary Canon of St. John's Cathedral of Providence, Rhode Island in his sermon at Sunday Chapel. His re- ply was that the answer might be clearly seen if one would note that Christian ideals are not practiced in poli-tics, banking, industry, edu- catiOn, or even in social intercourse. People who express any Christian tendencies are called prudes. If the~e basic principles of American soctety no longer recognize or ob- serve ~hristlan morality, it is only too eVIdent why the Christian reli- gion has lost its control. '_'Our li~e~ have been led in pur- SUit of tnvral pleasur·cs in:;tuad of in search for the meaninl-\ of beauty,\ continued Dr. Bell. Christ was the mruoter artist because of his ability to exemplify the finer things o~ life .. We ought_ t? try to appre- crate hts mode of hvmg, by making our lives a growing beauty even though there is pain and sor row around about us. Shall the Chr it:l- tian religion disintegrate beca u,;e we have become so used to foolish luxuries that we have lost sight of the nobler ideals of life? In conclusion, he stated that the future will hold for 'Us an era of investigation for truth. This re- search will keep us from drifting back to the days of easy living. The age cannot be called sinful but merely slothful. All Americans have cared for is to have a sufficiency of clothing and food; other than that they have been satisfied. A new day dawns hi which every one. wii! find something for which to strive, some- thing for which to sacrifice.

North TUESDAY, MARCH 13, 1934 A \UNION PRESS\ On Friday we had the pleasure of making a hasty trip through the offices of the Syra- cuse Daily Orange, and although we did not have anywhere near enough time to see the entire plant, the short time we spent there WitS enough to indicate why the Orange is the excellent paper that it is. The ~yracuse paper is run the way we hope to see the Union publications conduct- ed in the not so very fm· future. Everything is done on the pt·emises. The paper is set up by linotype machines right in the building. Everything 1s done in the same building which naturally saves a great deal of time, and makes it possiJJle to get the paper on the pres::; in short order. Of course L'nion is no where near the size of Syracuse, but we spend thousands of dol- lars on printing every year. Not only are there three college publications, but the col- lege, itself does a tremendous amount of printing. It would be possible for Union to have its o\vn machines right in Silliman Hall. It must be admitted that a large sum of money would have to be spent to start the project, but in the end the college would save thousands of dollars, and students would get a lot more valuable experience than they do at present by working on publications. 'Silliman Hall has not been utilized to its fullest extent fo1· many yem·s. The building is here, and there is plenty of room for the installation of a complete printing plant. It might be a good plan for the Administration and those stud2nts who are interested in publications to start thinking about this mat- ter now. Such a project would be an excel- lent investment. TO BE GOOD AT SOMETHING To be recognir.ed as a success it is almost always necessary to be recognized as being good at some one thing. It apparently does not matte nvhat a person excels in, as long as he be a leader in some field of endeavor. The same thing applies to colleges to a large extent. Many of the neighboring col- leges are nationally known for no other rea- son than the fact that they excel in some particular aspect. One comparatively small college in central New York is nationally prominent because it produces football teams that can compete with the best teams in the country. Another small college in Pennsyl- w d t k d f . 't t' gutter-ta:l·k; no mere actor could was some one else.\ No retums familiwr work.

When eleven Army air mail pilots lose their lives in crashes-that's a national shame. But when several miUion young men, nearly thirty of them from Union College, were shot down in the world War-that's national glory, something to be proud of. It will remain a glory as long as millions of college students remain their present apathetic, weak-minded attitude about war. When Lloyd's, the great London insru·- ance company, makes drastic changes in its rates, and when numerous conservative Oib- servers of international affairs predict an- other widespread war in from three months to fifteen months time, it is certainly fitting that one give the most crucial of all questions some serious consideration. What would ;rou do if the country became involved in another war? The head of the political .science (lepartment thinks we would all enlist. James Finegan, '02, one of Union's most active in civic affairs, in a speech two weeks ago declared a similm· opinion, \You would all go.\ Dr. ~icholas ..\Iunay Butler, president of Columbia Cnin.>l~ity, recently stated that \College studenu should take the responsi- bility for the direction of public opinion in international affairs.\ In Europe an and South American countries studf'nts are often responsible fOl' the ovP1'th1·uw of a party, or even of a govemment, while here in the l'nitl'd States \H' are contPnt to ld the Raskobs and Cunys do whatever p1·ofits them most in directing the country's affairs. And wars bring lovely profits for a certain few greedy capitalists, while young men of our age rush madly to the front to stop lit- tle lead pellets. The program to preserve peace, suggested by the Brown Daily Herald and reprinted in this issue, may or may not agree with the views of Union students. At any rate, the organization of a movement of any sort to maintain peace is worth far more than other activities. Such an organization at Union would be a forward step. CONDUCT After listening to the raucous bellowing from our visitors' jeering section at the basketball game a \\veek .ago, our respect for Union fans, hitherto rather meagre, in- creased greatly by the comparison. We fail to see what enjoyment a spectator can derive from a game if he is so narmw- minded that he can't bear to see his team get beaten without loudly voicing the childish complaint that the oft'icials are playing on the opponent's team, totally ignoring the possibility that the other team may be bet- ter. Most of the sa.cmstic remarks ;,;houted at the t•eferees were sufficient to justify the calling of a technical foul for hooting. When one considers that the visitors team had only one more foul called on them than the Garnet,-the actual count being 21 and 20,-and that each team lost three player:s, such unsportsmanlike wailing is even less called for.

So say we all? So say we all. The purpose of a university is, we had supposed, to broaden and en- large an individual's outlook. How- ever, that may best be done by a hearty interest in student elections, the junior orom, comments on the <:onditions of the campus and en- thusiastic editorials about the great moral victory the team won against Oshkosh teachers. So say we all? So say we all. The impenetrable vastness and significance of the doings of 5,000 adolescenLq is, of course, the key to understanding. Roosevelt and his program, the A1.1strian situation, the war clouds in the Far East, the mobs of Paris-they are nothing- nothing but that which is apt to change the lives of all of us. The mere fact that we have so many labelled educational doses to take each week is no excuse for surrounding ourselves with a cloud of denseness and colloqualness. That can best be saved for our coming days as prosperous dry goods merchants in Sauk Center. The most direct way of acquiring a start towards an education is to try a bit of thinking on the side. -syracuse Dally Orange. with most pleasing results. Here was one which not only gave forth hot water, but was also, mirabile dictu, adjustable. Ten showers, four extremely cold, one not work- ing, and five warm or hot. Changing my towel at the lion's cage, I proceeded toward the other end of the building. I stopped in at the coaches room to see if they had any cause for complaint, and dis- covered a very fine private water- ing system there. The same was true for the shower in Trainer . Fitz's hospital. The showers in tPe vt>rsity room, however, were in a sad plight a fact which was made evident even before I arrived there by loud wail- ings from three track men. There were seven showers. The first one on the left was absolutely cold, while the next three were all luke- warm, mostly luke though. The last of these thtee had ·one power- ful stream right in the middle of it which played a heavy tattoo where- ever it landed. Of the three show- ers on the other side, one was again ice-cold, the middle one lukewarm, and the third one bore close resem- blance to the gentle spray of a gar- den sprinkling can. That's the evidence in the case: seventeen showers for the use of students, of which there are four good ones, one boiling hot one, six ice-cold ones, four lukewarm (ID«;!Stly luke), one gentle garden- sprmkler, also lukewarm, and one with nothing doing at all.

Gilbert FRIDAY, MARCH 16, 1934 SOMETHING IS ROTTEN IN DENMARK The fact that only forty-five undergrad- uates have signified their intention of major- ing in the division of languag-e and literature speaks for itself. It is beginning to look as if some of the \dead wood\ on our faculty is being found out at last. If we look into this question, we find that there are several reasons for this rather startling fact. In the first place, there are never many stu- dents who major in modern foreign language or ancient classics. The very large majority in this division are English majors; and here, we believe, lies the trouble. One man, Profe·ssor Herrick, will teach three of the six electives in English next year. It is true that he should teach the two composition courses because he came to Union expressly to teach this subject, but should one man have half of the electives in a departmenO It does not make any differ- ence whether he is the best teacher in the world or just another professor. Such a situ- ation tends to overbalance the department and should not be tolerated. Perhaps Pro- fessor Herrick could be induced to give u,p one of his electives, and have some other member of the staff teach it. This is, it seems, a perfectly reasonable suggestion, but we regret to say that we would be greatly surprised if anything should be done ab()ut the matter. The opinion of many students and S()me interested observers is that our English de~ partment is not very strong. At the risk of embarrassing a member of th.e staff we make the following statement. Mr. Bagster-Collins is leaving this year because the department has to be cut down by one man. Now we ask the students, the English department and the Administration this question. Is Mr. Bagster-Collins leaving because he has been here a shorter time than any other man in the department, or is he leaving because he is the least competent instructor? It is not necessary to answer this question, because most .students know the answer already. · · · · · ·. · ..................

We quote from the editorial which ap- peared in the May 12, 1933 issue of The Concordiensis entitled \Charge to the Stu- dent Council,\ which was published on the day when the present Student Council was announced.: \As a whole you are an excellent group. * * * It takes a lot of courage for a man to speak at the same place on two consecutive days--We hear that there are struggles for power be- tween nations and divisions.

Necessary work of these various groups wdll be carried on by committees. For generations there have been officers of the four classes of the college. Time and a~ain during those years, there have be~n bitter battles waged by different factions to obtain these so-called honors. Abolition will end these fights and therein the college as a who!~ will benefit. From the time a freshman enter- ed tll!is institution, and others like it, 1?-ere has been a clashing of ambitious students to win office and thereby t() be recognized as amon·g the leaders. Seldom have they been friendly struggles. The bitter feeling engendered has ex- tended to the members of the fra- ternities . jnvolved, turning one against the other; while non-fra- ternity men have become jealous because lack of organization often has deprived them of offtices. In the outside world men fight for office, sometimes because of an honest desire to serve their fellows.; but usually for the sake of the hon- or, and of the financial returns There is no reason · to expect thi~ condition to change. That would be contrary to human nature. The situation, as it exists, demands imme- diate attention. Conditions in the Adminis- tration make it impossible for much to be done in that direction. The Boa1·d of Tl'US- tess would do well to investigate this matter at once. Youth will not be advancing intel- lectually in the English department under present conditions. The best brains of the campus are among your • numbers. We must admit, however, that some of your organization are not ex- pected to be of great aid.\ The absense of enthusiasm at the recent student body meetings is indicative of the lack of punch in the Student Council. If the Student Council were more compact, there would be a greater amount or enthusiasm in its affairs. Bailey Hall has been dead a long time.

Makes Discontent: CALENDAR 'No Miracle Coaches' Says Little in His Block U Speech Colm,nbia Mentor Says Head Coach Can Do Better Job With Competent Assistants Daley of Same Opinion Both Agree Teams Must Work Hard to Achieve Success Lou Little, head coach of the \mythical champions\ the Colum- bia University football team, be- lieves very definitely that coaching a football team is not a one man job. \I am positive that a head coach can do a much better job if he is assisted by men who •know their jobs,\ the Lion mentor stated in an interview for The Concordi- ensis yesterday. George Daley, spoDts editor of the New York Herald-Tribune and the founder of the annual Block \U\ Dinners which take place ev- ery year on the campus, heartily agrees with the Columbia coach. \'.L'alking with Lou on the train coming up,\ he said, \he told me that blocking was the most impor- tant job of a football team, and that one man cannot keep an en- Ure team working on such funda- mentals as blocking without help. Lou Little himself could not coach a successful team without help.\ Team Work, Spilit Needed In answer to the question con- cerning what he considered the most important feature of a team, provided that it was well drilled in fundamentals, the Columbia coach said, \You can't get far with- out team play and plenty of spirit. It is a very important factor. I stress it continually. A man who is doing his best is a great help to the team, but if I find a man lying down on the job, he gets a good talking to.\ Both Daley and Little agree that if the boys on the team do not work, nothing can be accomplished \I like to make the men in my de- partment feel that they are working on a football team. You must pull together to get results,\ said the New York newspaper man. Line Coach Needed The Union undergraduates have been asking for a line coach for the past few months to assist Coach G. Elliot Hatfield, and the words of Little and Daley are most wel- come on the campus. Daley is a Union man of the class of 1892, and has followed the fortunes of all the Union sports teams for many years. He has kept in close touch with the football situation, and is ac- quainted with the coaching situa- tion at Union. ]l]xpeet Appointment Soon It was learned yesterday from reliable authorities, that Professor J. Harold Wittner has been con- sidering at least two candidates for the line coach position, and an announcement of an appointment may be expected in a week or two. SIGMA CHI ESCAPES QUARANTINE Following an examination by Dr. MarceHus Cl0we, college physician, and an interview with the health commissioner, it was fouild that the Sigma Chi ·house would no1 have to be ·quarantined.

It was the first case of the dis- ease on the campus in two years. ----01---- 'Truth Finally Pre- vails,' Says Speaker Dr. Niebuh1· Contrasts Good- ness and Power; Strong· Of- ten Win But Lose in End \Truth finally prevajls in this world, but only when defended by people without too much regard for its immediate success, for this suc- cess is never guaranteed,\ said Dr. Rheinhold Niebuhr, professor of ethics and philosophy at the Union Theological Seminary, in his ser- mon in the Memorial Chapel Sun- day. \It is the old story of the saint and the Caesar,\ explained Dr. Nie- buhr, \the contr~st between the man of goodness and the man of power. The man of power, Pilate, holds the saint in contempt, for he is weak. Yet there is a measure of admiration and respect, for he is still a man. He recognizes virtue when he sees it.\ Dr. Niebuhr went on to say that the undecided p}ace of man is found in the two theories of Chris- tianity, the one that it is unprac- tical, and the other that it is prac- tical, the one which is most ad- hered to today. It is difficult to de- termine the kingdom to which man belongs but Jesus knew that there was another kingdom and that man might belong to it. The idea seems more paradoxical whenever it is thought of. Man is the animal, the lion which devours the lamb, yet which dreams of a time when they both shall lie down together. \We today are living in a world that is tortuously winding its way toward destruction,\ he stated. \The civilization in which we live is falling apart because of unjust- ness and evil. It has nothing to fear, however, from conscience, if it does not rebel. Therefore the Caesars prevail today, while the call of conscience is in vain.\ Dr. Niebuhr concluded his ser- mon by saying that the struggle to be successful, must not be carried on by men who have an eye to the immediate future. It is only in the long run that honesty proves the best policy or that love triumphs over evil. There is a place in this struggle where conscience must have no regard for the outcome; it must fight. Spring Time Inspired Canal Trips When Union Boys Wore Whiskers By VEDDER M. GILBERT When the ice in the Mohawk floated away into the Hudson, when the campus grass had turned green, and when the undergrad- uates ambitions became flavored with Spring, then the Union boys of the eighties and nineties planned ways to entertain the weaker-stron- ger sex. Those college lads who were someday to cultivate long bushy sideburns must have been a roman- tic lot, for many an evening star found groups of fraternity men loading a piano upon a wagon, and then dragging the instrument un- der the window of some fair dam- sel's boudoir. When all was in readiness the pianist struck up a favorite tune and the greek trotiba- dors sang the lyrics until the blush- ing maiden 9ame to the window. Likely as not the following Sun- day afternoon would be reserved for a river tea or a canal trip .. River teas consisted of a mixed group hiring a fleet of canoes, placing a boy and a girl in a canoe, paddling up stream a ways, conversing much about sweet nothingness, and then when everyone was sufficiently tired, lashing the canoes together and partaking (}f lunch. When the repast was over, and the sun drop- ped in the west the canoes were cut loose and allowed to drift down stream. Canal trips were very similar to river teas. They differed. in that instead of bringing their lunches the canoists stopped at a Canal House and ate there. Canal Houses were similar to the present day road stand. Occasionally undergraduates tore themselves away from their work and female companions and had a Keg party. The poor unfortunate freshmen furnished the keg, built a huge bmifire, and entertained the three other classes. Perhaps lteg parties were not as picturesque a custom as fraternity serenades, but to many they proved more exciting. Working Men Squander Pay On Spil'ited Dlinks, Then Ask Aid of Administration ·. CWS Men Have Grievance • SJ~:illed Accountants, Directors · Get Miserably Low Wages By RAYMOND BONK The Civilian Works Administra- tion has been functioning since last November when $400,000,000 of Pub-· lie Works funds was turned over to Harry L. Hopkins. The object of this organization was to put 4,000,- 000 men to work within two months. In administering this work, which incidentally was not to be called relief work, the personnel used in administering State relief was taken over. Under the C. W. A. a man would be hired regardless of whether or not he was receiving relief. The fact that a man was married or single was not to enter into the question of obtaining a job. The minimum wage was to be $15.00 for a 30 hr. week. It at once becomes apparent that a married man with 3 or 4 chidlren was being discrim- inated against by such an arrange- ment. Orders were recently issued from Washington that no addi- tional relief was to be given where a man was receiving $15.00 from C. W. A. except for medical treat- ment. CWA Lowering Labor Morale C. W. A. was supposed to give work to the unemployed in order that the morale of the working class would not be upset. Instead this organization has served as a set-up for lowering the morale of the laborer. The men working on the highways have developed organized discontent and gang leadership of the ignorant sort. Working men on receiving their pay often spend a large share of it on spirited drinks and then wish for relief. As already mentioned this relief cannot be granted and so mothers and children must suf- fer as a result. Some conscientious men have gone so far as to attempt to turn in their pay checks to the relief administrator and asked to be placed under the care of the home relief division. The question naturally arises as to whether the unemployed have become so demor- alized by the original relief system that C. W. A. can not bring them back to a calvinistic spirit of inde- pendence or to carry the problem still further whether C. W. A. is (Continued on Page 4) ---01---- Berg Relates Childhood Experience With Ghosts \Are there ghosts? I doubt it, doubt it very much,\ said Dean Ernst J. Berg, Chairman of the En- gineering Division, speaking before the student body in assembly this morning. Dr. Berg traced his own ac- quaintance and experience with ghosts, and his research and con- clusions on the subject. As a boy in Sweden, he lived in a house that had quite a reputation for being haunted, and many people feared even to visit the Berg family on this account. He himself was a firm believer in their existence, and like the rest of his family and his neighbors, refused to have anything to do with them. Tonight Spanish Club meeting, Silliman Hall, 7:30 p. m.

Exhibit Ready For High School Pupils Biology, Geology and Psychol- ogy Departments Invite Students for Demonstration A crowd of 339 undergraduates and alumni, the largest since the · founding of the BI0ck \U\ Dinner seven years ago, were present in the Alumni gymnasium last night to see 157 awards given out to Un- ion's athletes. The banquet was sponsored by the Terrace Council, and dinner music was furnished by the Garnet Goblins. Daniel Flinn, president of the council, introduced James Finegan '02, as the toastmaster of the event. Finegan, recently appointed civil service commissioner of New York City, declared that \he never needed any urging to come back to Union, for Union has been a real mother to me.\ Telling severe! stories about New High School students of the near-· York business, Finegan stated that by communities have been invited \many of the law-officers in New York ought to be moved up to Sing by the college to visit Union Satur- Sing.

One college would borrow particularly good players from another college in or der to win. \Rochester playing Williams, probably picked up an extra player or two at Union to add to its strength.\ How Columbia received the in vitation to Palo Alto, was then re lated by Coach Little. \The first intimation that Columbia might go to Palo Alto came on the Monday after we defeated the Navy. From then on sports writers hinted at it although quite casually at first \But on the Saturday that Army lost to Notre Dame, and Duke to Georgia Tech, Columbia got much nearer the Rose Bowl. Feared Ra-zzing \It happened that between the halves of the Army-Notre Dame game I was to give a ten minute talk over the radio, and I predicted that Army would come back in the second half and score two more touchdowns. But it was Notre Dame who came back and did the scoring. When I got home after the game, I received one telegram, say ing, \Now what do you think of your second-half predictions?\ La ter on some one called, over long distance, declaring he was Al Mas ters, the graduate manager at Stan ford. I thought I was getting razzed some more about my predictions would come to the Rose Bowl, so I asll:ed for some proof. Masters said it was costing him money to convince me, but I told him to send me a telegram confirming his in vitation.

Van Trumbull TUESDAY, MARCH 20, 1934 MAKE IT COMPREHENSIVE The survey being conducted by The Con- cordiensis reveals nothing unusual in the methods of grading in colleges of this coun- try. Primarily, the A, B, C system is uni- versal in the United States. At least, every college included in the survey takes no rec- ognition of what the student accomplishes in any other fashion than his scholastic rating on a basis of one hundred per cent being perfect. Within the past decade the collegiate world has taken cognizance of the worth of comprehensive examination system in an academic as well as a technical education. Previous to that examinations had been given on a basis of covering only the work of the period prior to the date of the exam- ination. For such purposes the old marking system of rewarding a student for his scho- lastic accomplishment was fully adequate. To quote from an editorial which appeared in the February 20, 1934 issue of The Con- cordiensis we find: \From a comprehensive examination system a student is brought with a bang down from his academic realms to a marking sheet that places him on a par with the memory artist who can repeat his instructor's ideas with such success that he can be on the Dean's list.\ Such a condition exists not only in Union College, but in most of the colleges of this country. We repeat that if the higher education of this country is to be placed on a basis of equality for all students, there is but one thing that can be done; that is to create an entirely new marking system whereby a stu- dent's interest in his course and the improve- ment which the quality of his work shows be taken into full consideration. Give th· college man an opportunity to get away from the monotony of mechanical grades which has had for twelve years before he h~ matriculated.

Thus showing an unusual dramatic, singing and even some- what terpsichorean versatility. Somehow or other Hamlet's \To be or not to be\ doesn't mix very well in the same cocktail shaker with Gilbert and Sullivan's music, but, nevertheless, it was very satisfactory. However, it left in my mind sort of an amateurish \hang-over\ and it was therefore with a most peculiar feeling that I re-entered the little theater on the cam- pus Saturday night to view the presentation of O'Neill's \Hairy Ape\ ... a feeling in which curiosity mingled with a sense of astonishment that a group of youths- just mere youths-ever dared to attempt the presenta- tion of that very difficult drama. For two hours, I sat in astonishment,-pensive, per- plexed, and meditating. The element of surprise rose higher and higher for, considering the difficulties, technical problelllS, the size of the stage and the fact that I had amateurs before me, it was almost incon- ceivable how these boys could play it as well as they did. But they did and that is all that matters. To me, who remembers the rise of that typical American revolutionary movement-the I. W. W.-the academic debates of Eugene V. Debs, Daniel de Leon, Bill Heywood, Max Eastman, Jack Reid and others, the play, in addition to its artistic merits, brought also all sorts of memories. Notes On Our Contemporaries Students Follow Labor The Tech, paper of the Massachu- setts Institute of Technology, is conducting a poll to determine stu- dent opinion on a proposed five-day weelt. The students have been campaigning for the abolition of Saturday classes, and the vote is being taken to determine exactly how powerful the stand is. Among the reasons given for the omitting of Saturday classes are: 1. Saturday classes are poorly at- tended. 2. One or two Saturday classes spoil the entire day for those who are planning a Saturday program. 3. A great num.ber of students do not study Friday night for their Saturday morning classes, which results in a waste of time, efficiency and effort on the instructor's part. 4. Commuters waste time and money in attending but one or two Saturday classes. 5.

He can sign up every sucker that bites; often for the same \exclusive\ territory, or for .a territory previously combed. He has no reason to help the stu- dent-salesman and seldom does. He is hired for his ability to sell con- tracts to suckers. The \corporation\ (which often does enjoy a nationally good repu- tation) knows that about half will never start out. The other half will not work all summer. But a thou- sand students will average a couple thousand salell, or more, fot• the summer. The company has made a neat profit at practically no ex- pense. Several thousand samples and sales manuals can be produced at a ridiculously low figure. About one in a hundred actually makes more than his expenses. A few really make good. We hear about them and bite, and then blame ourselves if we fall. At this time or year, these rac- keteers begin their migrations to campuses. At least 50 Syracuse men get \hooked\ every year. Most of them couldn't sell lids to gullible frosh at a dime a throw. Yet they jump at the chance to compete with the arm.y that now rings every doorbell in the country twice daily. They .allow these smooth-talking pirates to convince them that they are \born salesmen.\ The most frequent victim is the poor son-of-a-gun that gives up a chance to make a few honest dol- lars in order to chase the rainbow.

R.C. March 19, 1934 Editor of The Concordiensis: I have always 'been satisfied with the editorial policy of the Concordi- ensis but I was m.ore than pleased with the vigorous stand it took on the matter of Mr. J. F. Bagster- Collins' future dJsm!ssal. Union College is taking liberties with the quality of our training when it selects ·seniority as the basis for the retention of a position on the faculty. E;ow can such a policy be anything but detrimenta·l! In its desire not to offend, or for sentimentaJ reasons, the college seems to have selected a harmful basis for reducing expenses. My contact with Mr. J. F. Bag- ster-Collins has amounted to only a little more than one semester, but in that time I have met no one of his students 'Who has felt anything but the greatest respect for him and his ability to teach. There are many others on the ·faculty about whom such a statement could not be made. At the time of the Concordiensis questionnaire, I had nothing but faith in the probable success of the Union Plan; had I the question to answer .again, I should say it was doomed to failure-on such a basis for thinning the faculty.

Stravinslry Artur Rodzinski has chosen an exceedingly -interesting program for his first appearance in this area with the .Cleveland Symphony Orchestra, which he will direct Thursday evening at 8:30 o'clock in the Philip Livingston High School, Albany. The concert will be the final one of the current Civic Music Association series. The D minor Toccata and Fugue belongs to Bach's early Weimar period but is not to be confused with the better known \Dorian\ Toccata and Fugue in the same key. The fugal portion is usually free in appearance and is based on a subject partially concealed by milling harmonies that interweave in broken fa-shion. A coda of tre- mendous power and majesty brings the work to a dramatic conclusion. Tchaikovsky's Symphony No. 41 Tchaikovsky's F minor sym- phony, less famlliar than the Fifth and Sixth (Pathetique), is in a lightet•, distinctly more youthful vein. Although its theme is a de- pressing one, the overwhelming power of adverse Fate, the work abounds in passages of joy and beauty, dreams of happy childhood, efforts to escape from reality. Of the fourth movement the com- poser wrote: \If you have no joy in yourself, look around you.\ He follows with a picture of popular merry-making. \Scarce have you forgotten your sorrow than untir- ing fate once more announces its presence .... You would affirm that all the world is sombre and joyless! There is still happiness, however, simple, primitive happiness. Re- joice in the joy of others-and you can still live.\ This symphony is by no means as great as either of those which fol- lowed it, but it is delightfully re- freshing, pleasant to listen to with- out being weak, and an overflow- ing repository of passages of pur- est beauty, of passages exuberant with youthful eagerness.

It has grown bigger than I ever expected.\ \I want to commend before this gathering, your athletic director, Hal Wittner, a fellow you can de- pend on, a man of high principles,\ was Daley's tribute to Wittner, who was recently promoted from as- sistant director of athletic to his present office. \Have faith in yourself, your as• sociates, and your country,\ was the keynote of Daley's talk. Faith is the backbone of what we live and strive for.\ He e11ded his ad- dress with a motto which he had stored away in his mind for some time, \Choose to give, don't choose to get.\ Following Daley's speech, Wittner read off the names of the 134 ath- letes who participated in Union's sports during the past year. The banq11et was concluded with the address by Lou Little.

In the first place there are seven juniors and seniors who write editorials regularly for this paper. \Ve men tiun them l>y name: George R. C01·y, Jr., C. \Villiam 11 untley, Robert H. Smith, seniors; Clemens Hatha- way, Donald Moulton, Joseph Woolman and Milton Berge·r, juniors. It has been said in the class room and on the campus that these seven $tudents are influenced, in fact told by certain parties what to write. Each one of thes.e undergraduates emphatically denies any such implications. They invite their ac- cusers to prove one single instance where such may be the ease. In fact they would welcome ariy such attempt. The above members of the staff have specialized more or less. For example, what we have had to say about the abolishment of class officers has all been written by a junior. Athletic questions have been writ- ten up by another junior. Still another third year man has handled the marking :;;ystem question. As far as our 1·ernarks a:bout conditions in certain depa1·tments are concerned, the edi- tor-in-chief tal\es the full responsibility. But not once has anything been done without the full approval of the entire editorial board. It would take a pretty clever member of the faculty to influe11ce the opinion:;; of seven undergraduates. We would be mo1·e than glad to talk over our position with anyone who does not be- lieve us. We do not expect to change the minds of our critics by writing this editorial. We will never mention this subject again. It is not woi~th wasting the space on such inconsequential matters. Dut one word of ad- vice:lt would seem that ()nly tlte weak and incompetent members ()f both the faculty and Student ll()dy would criticise us behind our backs.

A small group of seven socially prominent ,;eni01~s is the log-ical one to carry out such a program, and should be a.ble to accomplish much more in this direction than the bulky, unwieldy Student Council. In directing a definite social program, the Terrace Council would not only make itself more useful, but would add gTeatly to its popularity. WORTH ATTENDING We have always supported to the utmost anything that will aid the Student Loan Fund. Now comes the news that the Glee Club \\·ill appear in the near future at the Mohawk Golf Club in the annual concert sponsored by the Schenectady Alumni Asso- ciation, which is a live and worthwhiiP group to say the least. It is up to every student who can possibly afford the price of admission to attend this concert. Those who were present last year remember what an enjoyable time they had. This year the program promises to be even more attntctive than in the past. A number of students, over one hundred, benefit by the Student Loan Fund. Those who do not have to use this fund for help, or those who have used it in the past should be more than glad to contribute to such a worthwhile cause.

A few months later the wise man came once more to the little town for the Sabbath day. He again MUSIC by Rankine Hinman Monday evening Jose Iturbi, Spanish pianist whose fame is quite recent, thoroughly justified the wide acclaim which has placed him a- mong the greatest living virtuosos.

Iturbi so caught us up in his spell that we were seldom aware· of his perfect technical accomplish- ment. The artist showed courage in be- ginning with two quiet Scarlatti Sonatinas, but also good taste; a Bach Chorale or Prelude, ror ex- ample, would have placed the ma- jor work of the evening, the rela- tively moderate and exceedingly beautiful Mozart Sonata in A ma- jor, between two numbers· of such .great strength and grandeur as to make it appear insignificant.

Midget Infield, Fast Outfield To Feature Squad Composed Of Sop'hom(}res and Juniors \Things are beginning to talie a little more shape and we now can tell approximately who will be cai'- riPd through the s.eason·:. sail;! !Jase- ball coach .Elliott Hatfield in an interview Wednesday afternoon. \As yC't the>re is nothing very definitely c<>tablished, since there are several• posi·tions stiii to be decided upon. Few places are fill'ed and there is u chance for anyone who can prove himself worthy of a position on the team.' 1 One or twu places, however, are rather definitely settled, according to the coach. It is almost certain ttm.t Semerad, third baseman on last year's nine, will cover cente1• field. His hitting is good and he is de- pendable in the pinches. Griswold, sophomore twirler, looks lilce the first ,choice fol\ the pitching assign- ment. He is closely followed by Loomis, another one of last year's men, and Lambeth. Stevenson, an- other member of last year's fresh- man group, seems to have the in- side lane in the race for the re- ceiving end of the battery, a pos- ition left open by the graduation of \Red\ Acl-iley, chief slugging threat for· three y·ears. He is work- ing well as a catcher and his hit- ting is consistent. Outfielders Plentiful There is a wealth of material yet to be given positions, said Hatfield. New men, as well as veterans fvom the 1933 season, are still fighting for positions on. ·the squad. Captain Garrison 'holds the edge on the right field berth, although he is be- ing pressed hard by Bush and Cooper. Loomis and G!'iswold, when thE>y a1e not in the picher's box, will alternate in the outfield also. If Clark i~ called on for mound duty, Gt\i;;wold will get the signal to CUVt•l fit:;t. First base will be covered by Clm k wh<:>n he is not pitching. Da· vi,.;, onP of Clark's undE>rstudies, will prohnbl)T be carried through the season because of his reliability at bat. Second base seems to be pret- ty well tucked away in the hands of \Mil;;l'\ Fiore,. dimin.utive sopho- mor \· who seems to be the a.ll a r ntn1d man among the newcomers. \VhPn FiorP is not on thP playing fi,.ld.

The topic of the forum, which is the last of a series of discussions under the auspices of the \Y\ Cab- ·inet, is The Psychology of Faith. \The psychology of religion and faith has been my major study for fourteen years,\ said Dr. Ligon in an interview for The Concordien- sis. \'1 intend to approach this question strictly from the stand- point of a psychologist interested in healthy mental atUtudes.\ What Is Faith? \Faith has in the past inspired men to almost o>uperhuman efforts and tests of endurance,\ Dr. Ligon explained. \The psychological ba- sis of such experiences, and the place of faith in modern life will be considered in the forum discus- sion.\ Among the contruven:;ial topics which will be raised are: What is there about faith that gives men this force of personality? Could men do just as well if they had no faith? Must faith be religious in nature? Is faith merely a form of auto-suggestion, a kind of com- fortable self-deception; or has it evidenced some objective reality? Is Religion He.althy? According to Dr. Ligon, many students regard religious faith as unhealthy sentimentalism. Religion from the standpoint of mental health will have a prominent place in the discussion. Are all religions mentally healthy? Can one achieve mental health without any religion? Is prayer necessary for a healthy religion? If one believes that a religion is psychologically helpful, is that sufficient justification for adhering to that religion? A large portion of the time for the forum will be devoted to the discussion of specific questions raised from the floor. Each student upon admission is assigned by the Dean of the College, as an adviser, a mem- ber of the staff of the division in which the student is regis- tered. This member of the staff continues as the student's ad- viser during his four years in the college unless the nature of the student's major work makes a change at the begin- ning of his junior year desir- able. In this case a new ad- viser, recommended by the chairman of the division con- oorned, is appointed by the Dean of the College. Advisers will request the students in their charge to call upon them so that the students tnay be given copies of the time schedule for next year and such other material and advice as is necessary. Copies of the new catalog prepared by the office of the Dean of the College may be had at this office after April :1. The entire program for each student will be arranged with his adviser and .Jater filed with the Dean of the College. Any irregu- la,rity in an individual program of study must be approved by the Dean of the College before it be- comes effective.

Hoadley, th\1 col• · lege bursar. This fact is one that puts Union in a comparatively en- viable position financially, accord- . ing to the survey just completed by the United States Department of the Interior, which found most of the \private'' colleges in bad straits financially. Accordtng to Mr. Hoadley, the college owes no bills whatever, and has all its debts paid up. This is in direct contrast to the condition ex- isting in other private institutions. Many. of them are carrying large numbers of needy students, accept- ing notes: for tuition; some have accumulated obligations for salaries and other operating costs; many have obligations for buildings and repairs which require financing, and many have mortgages, bonds, and other miscellaneous debts which are difficult to meet in these times. Although only seven out of 69 private colleges covered by the sur- vey have no students who have had to give notes for their tuition Ur;Jon has no such problem. Its re~ ce1pts from student tuition have kept well up to par, and the actual enrollment has remained practically the same. Union, however has a fund from which small s.J.ms are loaned to needy students to be ap- plied to their college expenses. These loans are due beginning one year after the student has com- pleted all of his formal education payments being made one fifth each year thereafter.

Van Tl'Um.bull TUESDAY, MARCH 27, 1934 WHAT THE STUDENTS ASKED FOR The results of the poll taken in Daily As- sembly by this paper some time ago have been tabulated, and we have attempted to follow out many of the suggestions that were offered. Here are S(}me of the things we have done. l\Iany students seem to want a column more or less like the \Winchell\ type. E. Pluribus Unum should satisfy this group. It is a very difficult proposition to find a good columnist, especially of this type. That is one of the reasons why ·we have not had a gossip column until recently. A great deal was said about the distribu- tion system. We have admitted that this is one of the worst features of the paper. We promise that it will show improvement this year, and that next year a thoroughly com- petent circulation manager will be announced. Several undergraduates seem to be of the opinion that we do not publish all the letters received. With two exceptions, we have published every letter that has come into the office, provided that we knew who wrote it. We have asked for more letters constantly, but very few students seem to feel that they want to write us. ?.lore box scores of intramural sports were asked for by a very large number of stu- dents. We have taken care of this matter to the best of our ability. In ans\ver to comments concerning ph(}to- graphs in the paper; we have appointed two students to take care of this matter. Little has been done as yet, because we have only a limited amount of money this year, and we want to use most of it for spring sports pic- tures. As soon as the teams get outside, we will get to work. There seems to be a strong feeling about the condition of the paths on the campus. We have tried to get something done about them, but af; yet, not much has been accom- plished. This matter will be mentioned again. A better coaching staff is desired for the football team. Professor Wittner has as- sured us that he will get a line coach next year. The Collegiate Digest is very popular. As far as we know this feature will be continued indefinite!~·. In addition to the pictorial sec- tion, we receive many valuable hints and a great deal of news releas-es from this organ- ization. It is a great help to us, and as a WHY HAVE THEM? Several students were heard to remark about the utter futil.ity of Student Body. meetings y.esterday after the close of the regular meeting. Some even suggested rea- sons why they are so deadly. All seemed to agree that they are a waste of time. This condition is going from bad to worse. Thet·e are just two things that can be done about it. Either don't have Student Body meetings, ot· make them worth attending·. If there is no business to come before the stu- dents, why have a meeting? The Student Body has accomplished prac- tically nothing· at meetings this year. Off hand we can recall three measures which might be termed of majo1· importance. The group \unanimously\ voted for the rein- statement of varsity hockey. It abolished class officers and it accepted the report of the Tax Committee. These three measures were all settled long before they came before the meetings. The appt·oval registered by the undergraduates simply serv.ed as a rubber stamp, and not a very good one at that. There is only one course to take. Forget all about Student Body meetings until there is a need for them. If something should arise that the Student Body should discuss, let the president of the Student Council call a meeting. If the matter is worth talking about, the students will come. Otherwise, let Monday morning be free as far as chapel or meetings are concerned. COOPERATE It is highly probable that most of the un- dergraduates are not aware of the tremen- dous amount of work that has been done by the Administration and members of the fac- ulty preparing the college for the Union Plan next year. Everything has been done that is humanly possible to insure its success, and we hope that the undergraduates appre- ciate this fact. The Union Plan is a very serious and diffi- cult undertaking. Almost everyone con- nected with the college in any way realizes the major changes th;tt it involves. How these changes will work out, nobody knows yet; but it appears that most students feel that it will be a success. The plan can not be a success without the support of the undergraduates. Many seem to feel that they will be restricted to some extent iii so1ne fields. To this group \Ve can only say: cooperate with the college to your utmost. The college is interested in your welfare, and will do everything that can be done to give you the best that can be offered in an education. The Union Plan will be in operation next year, but it will take another year or so to iron out the rough spots. Most students realize all this, and seem willing to continue with the excellent cooperation with the Ad- ministration and the faculty that they have in the past. CORRECTION It was erroneously stated in Friday's Con- cordiensis that the Glee Club concert to be given soon under the auspices of the Sche- nectady Alumni Association was for the benefit of the Student Loan Fund. The money realized will be used for scholarship purposes hy the association, and not for the Loan Fund.

Their function is to serve. In a normal, free society their pur· pose is to provide the individual with the implements of living and neighbor. They are not the ends of to define his relation with his living, but the means, and they are to be used. Their authority stops there. They can never satisfy a man's spiritual aspirations. He can· not look to commerce or the gov- ernment to teach him the exalta- tion in a Beethoven symphony or the beauty of the sunset in the dun- colored smoke across the Hudson. Our destinies lie outside the range of institutions and have to be pur- sued alone. The most we can ex- pect from business and the govern- ment is the freedom to follow after our highest individual instincts, and to quicken our perceptions of beauty. \It is misguided to imagine that it is the whole duty of every man to devote all his genius to the brawl in the market place. If that were true, the joy a man feels when he is under the open sky would be pure ignorance and the screech of the factory whistle in the morning would be the main theme of a heavenly anthem. Among those who have rights are poets who want escape from what is not life into truth that harmonizes with their genius.\ Notes On Our Contemporaries virile inte11pretation of a program in which the descriptive predom- inated. Cleveland Orchestra Plays Mr. Hodzinski was sensitive, how- ever, rather to the dramatic and artistic possij)ilities of each number than to i.ts more profound signifi- cance. In his decidedly objective reading of the Toccata and Fugue In D minor, for example, the essence of the work,. the greatness of soul which it should reveal, was totally lost. For the sweeping grandeur of Bach he substituted an dlmost incisive strength; the hur- ried te1npo, over-stressed accent, and protracted holds with which he accentuated the running passages of the Toccata imparted to it an alien restlesl5ness. It is, we believe, impossible to be very profound with Tchaikovl5ky'>J Fourth Symphony; although its theme is the tragic power of fate, i~ is too good humored, too descrip- tiVe for stern treatment. After a series of joyous recollections, inter- rupted from time to time by de- spair, and melancholy, relentless fate is about to prevail; but no,- the jubilant mood which predom- inates the Symphony returns. Tchaikovsky explains, \Rejoice in the joy of others, and you can still live.\ The idea is wholesome, but not very convincing in the .sym- phonic expression given it by Tchai- kovsky. The importance of this work lies in the comparison which it suggests with the Fifth Sym- phony and the \Pathetique.\ Hurried Tempo In the opening Andante of the Symphony Mr. Rodzinski again dis- played a tendency to hurry the tempo; there !s a consequent loss of power in spite of the virility which characterized his rhythm through- out the evening. In the 150ft, rather melancholy pensiveness of the An- dantino, however, the rendition was exquisite, incredibly eloquent. The extremely difficult pizzicato work of the Scherzo was equally fine.

We quote a part of the letter: \In my opinion, st;udents would be foolish to retwn to Union, when they can get the ne- cessary course in American Government at almost any other college.\ Tuition Installments Students are reminded that the next installment of tuition will be due on Monday, April 16th.

The neutrals, anxious to increase their activities other than intra- mUral sports, conducted a poll in chapel. The results of the poll showed that many neutrals were in\ terested in having a dance. Those who are sponsoring the dance hope that there will be suf- ficient interest among the Neutrals to warrant holding an annual af- fair, ner an informal dinner will be served to the members of the so- ciety at the Corner House, 1202 Union street, at 6:30 o'clock.

We might graphically repre- sent the present situation by a pat- tern of many mutually intersecting circles, each retaining its individ- uality, yet at the same time occu- pying a certain ·amount of common ground.\ Astronomy a:n Example Perhaps the oldest science in the wmld is astronomy, already in a :state of comparali vely high devel- opment in the early yean; of the Christian era. Yet astronomy, with- out the aid of the physical :>cience of optics, which has provided us with the telescope, astronomers could never have pi~rccd the skies with their large r.~fracting tele- scopes. Another aid furnished by the physicists is the spectroscope, by which the chemical elements composing the stars may be identi- fied. Without the knowledge of the chemistry of photography, to carry the illustration further, no record could be made by the astronomers of stars and nebulae at such great distances that the human eye, even aided by the most powerful optic means, is unable to respond, so minute is the amount of light given off by these bodies.

In fact the whole life of an animal or a plant is simply a continued chem- ical experiment of unbelievable complexity, and here again, the physicist, with his optical instru- ment, the microscope, has given the biologi:>t a most valuable tool, which has revealed a vast under- world of infinitely small organisms. Anthropology and psychology rep- resent the application of biological principles to special problems re- lating to the races of man, animal behavior, and the lilte.

Crowley, Jr., at the beginning of his talk, \Political Sci ence Course at Union College,\ in chapel Wednesday. Since people have variouoJ abilities and interests their wealth varies accordingly. The government controls these interests through the medium of political parties. The constitution of the United States, although a model of the English institution, wab changed to suit the various factions prevalent in the country in 1789. Before the Civil War the South and West maintained the balance of power but in 1869 the leadership was transferred t() the North. The Un ion too was forced to win the sup port of the West. From this time until the government was operated for big business and not for the benefit of society. The political fac tors with the aid of the public wrested the control from the manu facturers in the period before the World War. The Great War ended this period of reform but, again in 1932 the administration fought for the benefit of the majority. In short, political science is the understand ing of the problems of the world.

The Union Plan was designed for self-ad- vancement in intellect-students have ex- pressed thei1· faith in the plan through the recent poll of The Concordiensis. · By taking four courses in each of the junior and senior years a student will be permitted not only to acquire a cultural education but he will be .mabled to secure a fundamental knowledge of any one field, as represented by the vad- .)US fields of study within each division. The average student is twenty or tw.enty- one years of age by the time he reaches his juniol' year. When a man reaches that age he should be permitted to work on his own- that element of self education has been lack- ing in the past in Amel'ican colleges. Such systems as the Union Plan recognize that it is up to educators to instruct present day students with present day methods.

One student went so far as to say that he was what a college's educational scheme may be. We do not want to set up any one field as the one in which Union should try to attain national excellence, but we are vitally inter- ested in any plan which we believe would jn- crease the prestige of Union, and we think that the best way to attain this end is to be- come good at some one thing. With this bit of peasant wisdom examine the new list of electives p1:1blished in the last issue of this newspaper. The salt butter is now being wrapped in brightly colored cellophane instead of this movn- ing's Thnes. And the cellophane is none other than our widely publi- cized Union Plan .for the Intellect- ual Advancement of Youth. AH courses will be integrated. No more overlappitlg courses, even though there never were any. Union men will now be allowed to study philosophical history, ·histor- ical philosophy, philosophical his- torical history, historical philosoph- ical philosophy etc. etc. etc. etc. etc. etc. The college needs economy, But mere economy is like cacaophony during a symphony. So the result is that the courses have new names. Some courses have been dropped. Some instructors have been dropped. A new ideal has been announced and the college saves money. The wise men will pool their wis- dom and co-operate. In fact from now on they will integrate. The courses which they have been giv- ing for years they are going to throw in the waste basket. This summer they are all going to move into the New York Public Library and have live lions stationed on Fifth A venue instead of the stone ones to keep the peace. There in the library they are going to evolve new courses which will integrate into one big beautiful course-CUI,- TURE. But not only will these wise men teach new wisdom, they will also change themselves completely and teach from new aspects entirely. They will think beyond the'ir own precincts and embrace the world as a monism or as does Plato's hey too agatha idaya. I will now tell a story. This he did.

D•r. Ligon maintained that one must have faith in a personal God, and in a good and friendly universe in order to be free from fear and anger, the cardinal sins. Such a faith is not merely credulity, al- though credulity has its uses, par- ticularly in the curing of functional disease. Faith should be experi- mental and positive. As the scien- tist has faith in natural law, so we should have faith in spiritual law, which is just as real aud knowable. lieve that Jennings, alone, wrote All of these methods have con- that scholarly Jetter on the Ameii- tributed to man's knowledge of his can Governm.em.t cow·se which bios- dwelling place and of his environ- somed forth \In the Mail\ last ment, but only the mutual helpful- week.

The liberal spirit which marked its birth made Union a pioneer In educational reform. During the presidency of Dr. Eliphalet Not+, 1804 to :1866, there was added to the usual classical curriculum a scientific course in 1828, instruction in civil engineering was begun in 1845, and in 1854·, chemistry was placed upon a technical basis. Thus from an early date scientific and academic courses have run side by side at Union College, each making its own contribution to the intellectual life on the campus. Union College together with its graduate departments m Albany, twelve miles distant, constitutes Union University. The graduate depart- ments and the dates of their founding are: Albany Medical College, 1838; Albany Law School, 1851; Albany College of Pharmacy, 1881; and the Dudley Observatory. The undergraduate courses at Union lead to the following degrees: Bachelor of Arts Bachelor of Science Bachelor of Science m Chemistry Bachelor of Science m Civil Engineering Bachelor of Science m Electrical Engineering Bachelor of Science In Phys.ics The Union campus of 97 acres, overlooking the Mohawk river and facing the Helderberg Mountains, IS one of the beauty spots of the country. lnforma.tion regarding entrance requirements may be obtained from C. 1'-l.

Dispite the fact that Bill Coon, high scorer for the Neutrals in their first game was out of the lineup, Naguszewski, Podbielski and Krizek rolled up a tremen~ou::; lead which the Phi Gams were un- able to equal. Throughout the fizst half the splendid defensive work of the Neutrals limited the Fijis to a lone field goal and 6 foul shots while they unloosed a barrage of shots to give them an 18 to 8 ad- vantage.

Dr. Philip E. Mosely's course in Recent European History, covering the period from 1870 to the present, offers to the student a thorough understanding of the background of the major world problems of our generation. The course consists of assigned readings in various books, class discussions of the readings, occasional lectures, and a course essay. The material is organized In such a way that it falls into certain natural topics, each of which is studied thoroughly as a unit before proceeding to the next topic. This method, being more log-ical, has the advantage of greater facility for the student than the strictly chron- ological approach. Hour examina- tions are given, as nearly as pos- sible, at the conclusion of each ma- jor division of the course. Previous to each examination Dr. Mosely gives the class a list of sample ques- tions as an aid in reviewing. The chief merit of the course is the scholarly familiarity of the in- stt·uctor with his subject. Further- more, Dr. Mosely having lived and studied in European countries, is able to bring the European scene to the immediate attention of the students by recounting incidents which have come within the realm of his own personal experience. Wit Mingled With Wisdom F~und In Comments In Concordiensis Ballot The questionait·e handed out in chapel last week by The Concor- diensis gave campus humorists a chance to air their wit as well as providing opportunities for more serious thinkers to make helpful criticisms. One senim he·aded his comments at the bottom of the sheet with the suggestion that the campus newspaper find a name for itself which couldbepronounced itself which could ,be pronounced without stuttering. Another was anxious for the introduction of col- umns of the \Winchell type.\ Sophomores Inwrested Whether The Concordiensis should appear once a weelt or blos- som into a daily is a moot ques- tion with the sophomore class; opin- ions are -almost equally divided. At a glance this class seems to have thought up the greatest volume of criticisms, while freshmen have formed revolutionary schemes for all 'branches of student life. One senior has an educational plan of his own-to divide the year into four parts, one for each subject. In. this way a student may concen- trate upon a single subject during each period. . Some clamor for a campus gossip column, while others advocate a policy of strict intellectualism. One student wishes to see stiff criti- cisms of Sunday preachers, others cry for a .new marking system, while gre·at numbers agree that the gymnasium showers should :be re- ;paired. Nearly every coume in ()Ol· lege comes in for at least slight criticism, and two seniors hold that any eight o'clock is in itself unsat- isfactory. A student to whom ma- thematics is distasteful gave as a frank t•eason \tis I.\ Another con- sidered chapel an unsatisfactory course because \Bacon is always there.\ Criticize Distribution One man with an eye for expan- sion suggested that off-campus sub- scriptions might be 'boomed. Many called for •better distribution of copies, more space for intramural sports, and more college news. Sev- eral seniors chose as the most val- uable feature The Collegiate Di- gest, while one thoughtful member of the graduating class finds the Camel ads most worthwhile. One member of the senior class insists that he never takes unsat- isfactory courses; another has found all of his courses worthwhile because, he announces proudly, \I am an engineer!\ In an.swer to the question \Do you think that the Union Plan will be a success or a failure, one honest man answered, \Don't think.\ A membet· of the junior class thinks that instructors should give quizzes on what they have taught, not on obscure points which they have skipped over. Some one else wants The Concordiensis to make the Student Body government con- scious, and a third loolts forward to vacation announcements as the best feature of the w:bole :pa.por. President-elect Dr. Dixon Ryan Fox, this year's second Spencer lecturer, will speak tonight on \Refuse Ideas and Their Disposal\ at 8 o'clock in the Memorial Chapel.

Baker, of the class of 1915, and trust officer of the Guar- antee Trust Oompany, has .been elected a life trustee of the college, it was announced today by Acting- President Edward Ellery. Mr. Bak- er was elected an alumnus trustee for a five-year tel'm in 1931, but his increasingly important work for the college resulted in his receiv- ing the permanent .position. An alumnus will be elected in June to fill his unexpired term as repre- sentative of the alumni on the hoard of trustees. Mr. Baker's chief contribution to the college during the past six years has been made as chairman of the finance committee of the graduate council and in conducting in this capacity, the annual \alum- ni gift cn.nvass. When he took over the chairmanship in the fall of 1927, there were only 266 contributors. Last year his committee reported 1202 contributors, the number of contributors to the fund having grown steadily each year. The $70,000 received from ·alumni dur- ing this pel'iod have been used for important physical improvements of the campus, including a new campus lighting system and intra- mural athletic field, and during re- cent years as loans to needy stu- dents. Mr. and Mrs. Baker have also personally contributed to the col- lege library fund; Mrs. Baker es\ tablished the Mary Louise Johnson Library fund in 1929. Two years ago the Bakers gave the college a concert by Herr Friederich Schorr, of the Metropolitan Opera C<lm- pany, and the entire proceeds, over $1,000, wa.s given for the student loan fund.
