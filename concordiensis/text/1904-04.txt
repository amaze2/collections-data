THE CONCORDIENSIS No. 23. VoL. XXVII . UNION COLLEGE, APRIL 6, 1'904. . ·:· RANGE INVESTIGATIONS lN .WASHINGNON. By J. S. Cotton, '97· Only fifteen years ago the greater part of Central 'Vashington was open range land, characterize-<! by luxuriant growths of bunch grass. \Vhile this range land has been stock- ed ever since the early 6o's there has until re- cently been plenty of good feed for all. In r885 the sheep from Oregon and the countri.es to the South, where the effects. of overgrazing were beginning to be felt, began to make their way into this country that they n1ight get a part of the good grazing. The range was soon badly overcrowded; and as a necessary consequence began to deteriorate. Shortly after the sheep entered it was dis- covered that the greater pa.rt of the range lands, which it was supposed were of no value except for grazing purposes, would raise good crops of wheat. With this discovery the set- tlers began to farm the more favorable por- tions and the wheat fields began to encroach on the range. A little later the imn1igration to this section comtnenced. At first this immi- gration was slow but during the last four years it has been very rapid. As a result the wheat belt has been extended until the range is now confined to the broken coulee lands, to the foothills, and to the arid sage brush plains where the annual precipitation will not exceed eight inches. Even the last two areas have not been exetnpt. In the mountains two large forest reserves have been created for the dual~ purpose of protecting the timber and storing water for irrigation purposes. In the sage brush region large areas of land are now being put under irrigation and are proving to be the garden spots of the state. rfhe rapid reduction of the range area, to .. gether with the heavy overgrazing that has tak· en place, has in a very short time reduced the range to a sad state of depletion. The better class of stodz tnen soon saw that they must buy, or in other ways get control of their range lands if tbey expected to remain in the busi- ness. This they have been doing at a very rapid rate during the last two years. At the present tir:Je there is very little free range left except in the high tnountains and in those places that are inaccessible to water. In Febru~v y I was appointed to take charge of investigations co-operative between the Washington Agricultural Exper~ment Station and the United States Departn1ent of Agricul- ture to find out what could be done to restore these devastated ranges. For this purpose two range experiment stations have been es- tablished where various grasses and forage plants adapted to range conditions are being tried. One of these stations, situated on the Rattlesnake }/[ountains directly north fron1 Prosser is typical of the setni-aritl conditions. The other, which is a little over sooo feet in altitt1de ·is ]o,:~ted on the \Venatchee Mountains 26 n1i les north frotn Ellensburg and is typical of the surnmer range. So far the work on the vVen at ch ee 1\Iou ntai n station promises to giYe excellent results. The results on the Rattlesnake 1Vlountain station have been wholly negative. While these negative results are somewhat discouraging they are of great value, for they show conclusively w·bat the true problem is. At the titne that it was be- gun no one had any conception of how such work shoulcl be carried out. These experi- ments have therefore been of very great im- portance, in that they have given a clue to the 1nethods that must be pursued in order to ac .... complish this restoration.

6 THE C'ONOORDIENSIS. The ti,me not devoted to work on the sta- tions is spent in n1aking a reco11naissance of the range lands of the state, studying carefully the various conditions that are n1et ·with, and in making collections of the econon1 ic plants. This 1neans that a great part of the thn:e is spent in travelling. Although in 1902 a trip of 8oo mUes was made in a mountain buck- board, the majority of the trips are made on horseback. During the last season I have travelled son1 e 2500 miles in the saddle and for the greater part of this distance have trailed a packhorse. The method of travelling with a pack ~orse is most advantageous in this country as one is wholly independent. \\Vhen travelling in this manner one can stop at a hotel, farmhouse or cabin, or can camp out as is most convenient. Again one can travel on the main road or by trail or can strike across the country without either road or trail as best suits his purpose. My outfit on these trips is to aU purposes the same as the stockmen use when \riding the range.'' In fact I am usually taken for a ''cow puncher,\ or for a \sheep packer\ (a tnan packing provisions for a sheep cam.p ). The pack horse carries the grub and camp outfit. T'he cooking utensils, which consist of two frying pans, a stew pan, a coffee pot and tin dishes to eat fron1, together with the grub and my plant presses are carried in two large canvass bags, called alforkeses, one of which goes on each side of the horse. The blankets and tarpaulin are piled on top of these. The whole pack is held in place by a ''lash rope'' which is clinched up as tight as it can be drawn. \Vhere the feed is scarce the pack horse also has to carry a three to four days ration of oats. \Vhen in a region where water cannot be gotten, and dry camps have to be made, enough water to cook with is also carried. This means that the pack horse has a load varying frotn I 7 5 to 2 so pounds, de- pending on the needs of the trip. However, I always try to keep the pack as light as is safe, for the lighter the pack the faster the pack horse can travel. The saddle horse usually has the heavier toad .. for with a 35 pound saddle, gun, lari~t; camera, storm coat, chapajeiros, and the rider, his whole load amounts to a little over 225 pounds; which is about all that he can carry over the steep mountain trails. StiB he has the advantage over the pack horse in that ~his load is not \dead weight.'' In travelling in this manner I can usually n1ake fro·m 2 5 to 30 mil;es a day. In the mountains where there is a good deal of fallen timber to jump, or where the trails are very steep and rough it is often in1possible to make even this distance. On the level prairie land I have made as high as so ~miles in a day. That is a big ride when one considers that a pack horse should not be taken faster than a walk and that four miles an hour is good thne. Y. M. C. A. BULLETINS. TheY. M. C.

N. Littlejohn, of the Long Island Diocese of the Protestant Episcopal Church, has given a sum of money to build a new structure for the church of the Transfiguration, Fulton St., and Railroad Avenue, Brooklyn. The church is to be a memorial to Bishop Littlejohn. The amount given and the name of the giver are withheld at the request of the latter. The Rev. Dr. F. C. H.

Consideration. 'rhe recitation schedule for this term is ce~tainly unfortunate in one respect. The Sophomore and Freshman Engineers are especially handicapped in having recitations every afternoon except one, until 4.30. For· the· baseball candidates this is .a very serious drawback and one which we ask tpe Faculty to .consider. When Athletic Teams are recognized they should be supported by the college at large for defeat or victory means more to Union than mere disappointment or gratification to the Student l3ody. There happens to be quite a number of promising candidates from the engineerin~ divisions of the two low- er dasses this Spring but on account of recitation hours scheduled until late in the afternoons they are not given a fair chance to show theil' desire or ability to make the team. These two hour periods could just as well begin at two o'clock and it would harm no one to cut them down a half an hour, so that by 3, 30 the men could start to get ready for practice. Capta:i n Mahar predicts an exceptiqn· ally ,fine team fhis year but says he must have considera· don. This slight change does. not seem much to ask, when it is apparent that it will help the baseball season very materially and will be instrumental in bringing honor to the College. I The First Game. When th.e next Concordiensis appears it will contain an account of the openin~ of our :baseball season, the game with West Point. We do not prophesy a victory, nor do we stand with open arms ready to receive a defeat. We just expect a hard game from beginning to finish as has al· ways been the way in our baseball games with the Cadets. Last year the score was 3-1 and the year before 2~1 in their favor. Defeats, to IJe sure, but of the kind that breed hope and then perhaps-victory ! We have precedents to emulate and ambitions to gratify this Saturday at West Point. A Protest. The artide printed in this issue under the above tittle is by one who is closely allied to the true interests of the college. It is in reply to an editorial which appeared in the 11 Concordy '' on March 23rd. The subject is one of disagreeable interest to the College at large and a discussion of all sides of the question would prove interesting. The Editors would be glad to know the opinion ()[ others and invite further comment. ------· ...... ---- LONGING. \Vere I a rose, Fate might be kh1d; perhaps I'd lie

A. NIGHT HUNT IN. THE ADIRON- DACKS. lt was a ·night in early September. 'f.he.· quarter. moon shone dimly through heavy clq~ds. and ·ba-rely ~~lvered at intervals the placid waters .of a little mountain pond, lying sUent and ghost-like, in a depression be- tween . two thi~kly timbered ridge·s. 'The ·shor.es of the pond. were covered to the waters ed,ge wi.th ~n uncut ~rowth of pine and hem- lock,. ~htougb, c~.h~ tops of which the slight cur- rent of. air that wa& moving sang a wierd and plaintive sort of melody .. No note or jarring sound pierced the still- ness save the indistinct, far away hoot of an owl which came now and then frotn the side of a distant mountain. 'fhe beautiful picture the.1ittle body of water made .fro1n the shore, the artistic effect of moon. and clouds, did not appeal, however, to Hank the guide so he propelled his slender Saranac,· with .long silent strokes of the paddle toward the upper end o:f the pond. He saw in the night with its warm, soft air, the cloudy sky and a plentitude of mosquitoes, only an excellent chance of brin.ging success and con- tentment to the eager but erratic sport\man who now sat with his repeating shotgun poised careiull y across his knees in the bow of the boat. It is well to know that deer are ac~ustomed .during. the. summer and eariy part of the hunt- ing season to come down in the night time to the shores of solJ!e quiet lake, where they may . feed at will on the tender lily-pads and seek to .. rid ··themselves of the .torm~nting flies and mosquitoes in the ceol water. It is here that the un:skiHed or unsuccessful hunter, with the· aid of a~1 artificial Hght or so called. '' j.ack '' and an unscrupulous guide, often seeks his quarry. As Hank bent over his paddle and the skiff travel.led r!lpidly up the lake; he dealt out whispe·red in.structions and words of caution to the sitent attentive figure in the bow. 'l,hat which~ to the guide was but a cornmon place, though hazardous undertaking, seemed to the other a great a·nd memorable event to come, which tnigbt in the future be thrillingly related around some fireside, while the antlered proof of his prowess graced ·the wall above. A muttered order from the stern startled hhn from his reveries, and he saw that the skiff was near the shore and approaching the dark, hlpenetrable shadows which bordered the poud. vVith nervous fingers he adjusted the slide on the bulls-eye lantern in the bottom of the boat and put it on his head to the evi- dent sat~isfaction of the guide behind him, who directed his movements with professional at- tention to detaiL The jack threw· a bright circular patch of light on the dark surface of the wat{!r and the trees and bushes along the edge, revealing them accurately to the occu- pants of the boat. Its searchtng rays quiv~red slowly and stealthily over rock and bush and grizzled tree trunk, now and then shining out on the glassy water, thickly spotted with the lily pads .. Slowly the boat crept along, hugging the shore, uoiseless and phantom like,pseeming as th.ough some mysterious outside force, other than the skillfully wielded paddle of the guide was urging it forward. A ripple in the water at the side caused the watcher to turn his head quickly and start r~ervously as a muskrat, surprised in his noc- turnal wanderings sought the reedy bottom with a splash which sounded enormously loud in the stillness of the surroundings. Moments passed, the jack continued to reveal nothing to the watchers but a monotonous sameness of dead and ghastly tree trunks, standing out

Hank knew that if there were any deer around the pond that night, this 'vould be their favorite haunt and he whispered in a SU1'othered tone a word of encouragement and advice to the man in the bow. T:fue jac'k:er straightening his tired and aching bacl,. peered with fresh hope along the marshy edge.. No noise or sign, however, of the presence of deer in this di:sn1al spot . ' came to the hunters for several moments. The boat had nearly passed this stretch of shore, when a q;uick, sharp splash followed by a slight inquiring snort of surprise drew the light .with a jerk out into the shallow water. It flashed completely over an indistinct, gr~y form, standing there in the water, head raised, rigid with mingled frigat and curiosity. Two blazing- eyes, shining from the dar.k- ness with a pb()sphorescent glow seemed .to the anxious hunter in the bow the OJ..lly tangible part of the . game before him. Nearer and yet nearer, sl()'V ly, ste~lthily, Hank plied his silent paddle.. Now the jack glean1ing fixedly on those fiery eyes revealed dimly the antlers and sturdy form of a buck. A slight- quiver of the boat, it was the guide's signal to shoot, and breathlessly, quivering with a strange excitement the hunter raised his gun. A brief motnent of suspense follow- ed, the deer took a frightened step, but the ivory beaded sight stopped for an instant in its waverings between . the burning eyes and t~e report r~ng out, sharply echoing back and forth acro~s tfue pond. Tt}e aim at the close range had been true, but the anin1al instinct- ively seeking. the shore with its dying strength, required a second shot before it stopped.

Bum Watson, colored, is dead,· but he had a poor chance. Bum was a favorite with John Andrew Drake, the saw mill' man. Last fall John sent Bum to the woods to cut a big white oak ; the tree ·was three feet ·in diameter. Bum went to 1nove his old \hat out of the way as the tree was failing and it fell on him, tnashing him as flat as a flying squirrel. · In hour or so John went with the: wagon to haul the log and found Bum under the tree. Seizing an axe in 'his excitement he atternpted to cut the log in two where it lay across Bum's body, about the first lick the uplifted axe caught in a bush and.came down with tremendous force on Bum's head. The axe turl?e~ when it caught the limb thus hitting him with the back in- stead of the blade, or it would have been all up with Bum right then. Drake thought he was dead and decided to . get him out as quickly as pos'sibl~. so he put a ch-ain around Bum's neck and hitched a mule to it, he put a tree pole under the l.og and made two me :lighten the log and started the ·mul~es. and pul1ed Bum out, and to his surprise he found Bum still breathing, but from a stocky 1nan to five feet two inches tall the mule had stretched him out to a six feet two-inches man. Drake sent for Dr ..

Pond's Extract-the old family doctor-might with equal propriety be called the old college doctor. For over· 60 years Pond's Extract bas been doing a work of mercy-curing .cuts., bruises, burns ; relieving aches and pains ; easing suffering, and m.aking life brighter. lt is just as efficient to-day. A bottle should always be keptconve• nlen,t. Soothes and freshens the face after shaving. Don't experiment with ~~~~§iii so,..called remedies said to ill! be \just as good as Pond's Extract\ -there i3 no subst-itute. Watered Witch Hazel, a weak: sol uti on -sometimes offered in place of Pond's Extract -has no medicinal value-is positively worthless. Pond's Ex- tmct CURES-therefore is priceless.

CONC~ORDIEN.SIS v OL. :XXVII. UNION CO'LLEGE, APRIL 13, 1904. No. 24AI WEST POf.NT, 5: UNION, o. ,., '·. The Garnet's base ball season was opened J las.t Saturday with the West Point game. on·ly I six innings were played on .account of rain and I the fielding of both teams was very good con- l · sidering the condition of the ball. ,The cadets ~. I tallied three runs in the first in nin ~ but Union :: steadied down after that and but two soldiers crossed the hotne plate during the ren1atntng five innings. Union was ·beginning to strike a dangerous pace when the play stopped in the sixth, and it would not have been at all extraordinary if there ·had been something else than a cypher under the run column for Union had the game continued for nine innings. fi,.orns, who did the twirling for Uni,on, showed up remarkably ·well, strildng out eleven rne:n and allowing but five scratch hits. Mahar was steady at short. Sawyer and Robinson, in left and ri~ht did promisingly. Easton was put behind the bat without any training and naturally was a little wild. Odwell on first was the same Odwell of tvvo years ago-nothi:ng went by hiln. 1,he game was without any brilliant plays and the steady rain rendered star features im- possible. Union's teatn was cordially enter- tained by the Cadet Corps. The stnnn1ary : UNION. AB. R. BH. PO. A. E.

Never did Graduates' hall look prettier or more inviting than on Friday evening, when the Otnicron chapter of the Nu Sigma Nu fraternity entertained its friends in a most pleasing way. College and fraternity pennants and flags graced the walls. Cosy corners, appropriately and temptingly a::ranged with sofa pillows of college and fraternity signi- ficance, adorned opposite corners of the hall. Potted plants, palms and flowers were prettily banked in a third corner, presenting a most delightful retreat for a specially selected orchestra, which dispensed the latest harmonies for the entrancing waltze!s and two-steps that occupied the evening. At the intermissi~1 Caterer McElveney served light refreshments, and the 1VIedics certainly sustained their rep- utation as hospitable and entertaining hosts. The patronesses were : Mrs San1uel B. \Varcl, Mrs Henry I-Iun, Mrs Frederick C. Curtis, J\t1rs Edgar VanderVeer, Mrs Alvah I-I. ·Traver, of Albany ; Mrs John H. Cotter, of Poughkeepsie ; Mrs Tho1nas E. Carney, Mrs Frederick C. Reed and Nirs MacDonald. of Schenectady.

Address all communications to THE CoNCORDIENSI£, Union College, Schenectady, N.Y. 1'he Last Lap. In less than two months' time this college year will be over. They are the shortest of all the months, too, for there is so much going on, athletics for some, and then again, '' In the Spring a young man's fancy lightly turns to thoughts of love.'' We do not think there are any students here who wou1d 1 wilfully neglect their studying, their nearest duty, to go calling :on girls or anything Uke that. Oh, not In fact the majority can scarcely· tear themselves from their books to see a baseball game or to replete their systems with a modicum .of digestible matter, n1uch less leave their one real joy in life for the Vampire. Perhaps the preceding may souncl unprecocious. It is all laid at the door of the SpriHgtime. It is hard,to be serious at this seductive season,. but still, we must not forget that for some of us, at least, the tents must soon be struck, and not for many a long year will there be a • • Tenting on the Old Camp Ground.\ For others, the sumn1:er's vacation wiU be found quite long enough and they will welcome the fall again, tho' we hardly think they will embrace the Incidental Fee with tears of joy. This te:m, that is any Spring terrn, proves many a man's worth. If there is any lazi11ess in him, this is thethne' of year .it harvests a hundred fold. It is one crop that it pays not to give a chance. We \Vi\1 not be so tragic as to advise anyone to say ''I will pluck it from. my bosom tho' my heart be at its root,\ but suggest that it be remembered that Spring fever is fatal to work and to ambition.

One of the .good stories told of Sir Henry Hawkins, now Lord Brampton, the famous English Judge, is this: He was presiding over a very long, tedious and uninteresting trial, and was listening apparently with absorbed attention to a protracted and weary- ing speech from an etninent counsel learned in law. Presently Sir Henry made a pencil memorandumJ folded it and sen.t it by the usher to the lawyer in question.

'' Counsel's display of oratory came to an abrupt end. . . The Executive Co·mmittee of the Inter· colle.giate Association of Amateur Athletes of Atnerica has decided to introduce an in~ novation in the cotning intercollegiate track and field meeting to be held on Franklin Field May 27 and 28. This will be a raised plat- fonn for the exclusive use of the judges of the ga.me. For this reason the judges will not be allowed to cluster around the ·fin ish as they have done in the past, but will be station- ed about twenty-five feet from· the finish line and on an el~vated stand. This is the method of judging races in England, and has been chosen for the intercollegiate contest because of the dissatisfaction over the work of the judges in the 1 oo-yard race. at New York last year. In that race there was a discussion as to whether Schick of Harvard or Moulton of Yale finished second. The new plan will haYe. its first trial at the relays April 23~. Another innovation for judging the finishes will be the use o£ a white line on the ground at the finish, instead of the tape at the breast. This has been chosen because of the. tendency of so many athletes to throw themselves across the line in a close finish, instead of breasting the tape.

THE CONCORDIENSIS UNION COLLEGE, .A.PRIL 20, 1904. No. 25. .DR NOTT ON 'fHE MINISTRY. In the Auburn Serninary Review for March, 1904, there 1s an article under the above head- ing by S. JVII Hs Day, 'so, of Honeoye, N. Y. rfhe greater part of the article is taken up with a letter from Dr. Nott to 1VIr. Day, (who was at that ti1ne Secretary of the Union Alum- ni Societv of Auburn Serninary,) in reply to \ an i.nquiry as to son1e of the duties of the ministry. That \Vas fifty years ag0, but the counsel seen1s as good to~day as ever. Dr. N ott sq.id, in part : ''Health is indispensable to usefulness and should be studied in so far as habits of temper~ ance and chastity and well regulated habits of cleanliness and exercise are concerned; as for the rest, so far as official duties are concerned, it is better ' to wear out than to rust out.' ''In the early part of rn v- min is try, I occa~ siona1ly dined out with gentlemen of wealth. In the latter p:\rt of it., never. I visited the rich of n1y congregation little-the poor more -the sick and afflicted most. \For the n1ost part, a minister's visits should be religious; mere social calls are worth little. Religious calls often tell on the conscience, and when and xvhere tbey do not, there will be no con1plaint because they are not n1 ore frequent. ''Let puiitics alone-let religious contro~ versy alone-let heresy a lone. \ If you ~peak at all of others, dwell on the points in which you agree, and not on those in which you differ. \ In one word, do all you can by preaching Christ crucified, and by prayer, and leave the rest to Providence.\ Signed-ELIPHALET NOT r.

He had been an Assemblyman frotn Orange cot:ll!l- ty in 1845 and Senator frotn the 2nd district in 184r, '42, '43, '44, '45, '46 and '47. He was Comptroller in the first year of the Wt'H, at the inauguration of high taxes and the large expenditure of that period. His administra- tion was wise and conservative. \, William F. Allen, '26, a distinguished lawyer and democrat of Oswego, became ·2 Ist Comp- troller, Jan. I, I 868. Mr. Allen served as member of Assembly from Oswego in 184-3 and 44 and was appointed District Attorney in 1845 and was apointed Judge of the Supreme Court in the sth district in I847 and elected to the same pos1tion in 1855. lie was re- elected Cotnptroller in Nov. I 869, but resign· ed June r4, 187o, to accept an appointment as Judge of the Court of Appeals. This latter position he held with great distinction unlti:l his death, in June 1878. It is an interesting fact that in the campaign of r86g, Judge Al· len had as his opponent in the run for Conlp· troller, Horace Greely. / ·~ elson IC. Hopkins, '42, a lawyer and are· publican of Buffalo entered upon his duties ;as 23rd Cotnptroller, Jan. r, 1872, and continue<l therein for four years. This was the begi~tl· ning and the end of b is career in State politics. For five years, fro1n IS69-73, there was an aggregate deficiency of $8,637,720. 74· Th~ money to the extent of this deficiency had been supplied to the treasury by using the moneys frotn the bounty debt sinking furHI. Heroic treatment was necessary, so disregard- ing political effect, Mr. Hopkins advocated and secured the adoption of the highest tax rate in the history of the State, to wit, 9 3-8 mills on the dollar and 3 1-2, mills went to make up the deficier,cy. During Mr. Hop 4 kin's four years bf service the bounty debt was reduced $r4,40I,7oo. \~{Edward Wempte, '66, was the 28th Comp~ troller. He was elected in 188.7. He was a manufacturer and a den1ocrat, residing at FultonviHe. He was a rnember of Assembly from Montgomery county in 1877 and 1878, and a Member of the 48th Congress, but was defeated for re-election to that office. 'He served in the State Senate from the 18th dis- trict in x886 and 1887. He was re-elected Comptroller in 1889. JUNIOR HOP. One of the most succe~sful Junior ~ops of the year was held in the Yates' Boat House last Friday evening. rfhe boat house walls were very prettily decorated wihh bunting and Union flags. 1'he dancing, which lasted from 9 till 2, was enjoyed in every detail, as the floor was in very good condition and the music was all that could be desired.

TO A YOUNG FRil:\\£l'JD GOil\TG A\¥ A Y FROlVI HC)])/IE TO GE'T AN EDUCA'I'I()r.J. My Dear Friend: A good 1nany years ago I did wb~tt you are doing now. Since then, things ha ..,.~e changed a little in our American schools and colleges. The tern1 opens later in the fall and cl uses ear- lier in the sun1n1er. Students' roonu; are finer and warn1er. '~Entrance requiretnents\ are b.rger and stiffer. Tallow candles have gone out, electric lights have come in, and even kerosene oi 1 has been refined to astral brillian- cy. You are going to b ave n1ore teachers, 1nore elective courses, tnorc expenses, more athletic trainers, more \n1odern advantages,\ including probably n1ore kinds of food, than I had. But, after all, these changes clo not n1ake any real difference in the tnean ing of the fact that you are going away fron1 hotne to get an education. Your outfit n1ay be bet- ter than tnine, and the road may be a bit smoother; but you are starting on the satne journey, ~nd you have to face the same ques- tion: \Vl1at goal are you going to tnake for, and how are you going to travel, straight or crooked? To ans w.er this question rightly you n1ust, first of all, rernetnber that you are now a mem- ber of a privileged class. You are old enough to earn ·your own living. Under ordinary THE OONCORDIENSIS. 7 conditions, you wou:ld have to do it. :But you are going to be exempt from that necessity, in all probability, for four years, seven years, ten years-as long as it ,may need to complete your course. During all that tin1e you will be let off from tb.e corn1non duty of taking part in the world's work. Everr if you should do sornething to help pay the expenses of your education by laboring in vacation and between times, you would give farless than. you ·would get; and the opportunity to do at least that nuH.:h has been n1ade possible only by the gen- erous benefactions and endow1nents of un- known friends. Yes, you owe it to yourself to look the fact in the eyes. You are a person set apart; a guest at tbe world's table; a consumer, not a producer. No one will ask you what your trade or your business is. All that will be asked of you is how you are getting on with yonr education. You will be pennitted to de- vote all your titne and energy to yourself, and so1nebody else will pay for your living. \Vho is going to do this generous thing for you? \Vell, a good n1any people will have a share in it. First of all, your parents will do the greater part of it. You know· sotnething of the sacrifices and gifts that they will have to n1ake in order that you may enjoy your ye~rs of privilege and opportunity. Then, the conununity to \Yhich they belong has a part, indirectly, in 1naking it possible for them to give you an education. Then, the people who have given the n1oney to found institutions of learning and keep then1 going for the sake of you and others like you, contribute directly to your benefit. 'l'hcn, the great arn1y of teach- ers who are spending their lives in hard work for srnall pay 1nake an offering- on your behalf. F'inally, the State, the Nation, by its appropri- ation of public rnoney for educational purposes ( which are all really bound together and in- terdependent), n1akes you its beneficiary. Now, yourown sense of honor rnust tell you, at once, that you cannot fairly accept such benefits as these without incurring- great obli\

8 THE CONCORDIENSIS. gations. \'\hy have these people put you into a privileged class? 'Vhy does the world, in ef- fect, agree to pay for your living while you go on with your education? The question c..~on1es up to you. rfhe answer is plain and straight. rrhe world pays for your living in order that your llfe, through education, tnay becon1e of n1ore value to the .world. That is the es<ential fact, the puint of hoG. nr, which you must never for- get. You are t.:tken care ()f and provided fi.A.. during a period of yt>ar.s when you are (or at least you ou ~~h t to be ) a 1 J l e to pre vide for yourself, with the definite design that your in~ telligence, your charctcter, your pn rpose and power of doing good work n1a r be su develnp- ed that you 1nay be worlh n1ore to yuur fellow- men than you are now-and worth enough more to pay for what it is goin~ to cost to ed- ucate you. If you accept your place in a privileged clitss on this condition, it is all right. You are not an idler, a burden, a pau- per. You are an investment. But if you take the privilege and refuse or dishonor the obliga- tion, you are an object of rnisplaced charity, a cheat, a fraud. 'Vhat you have to do, then, is to make up your n1ind that you will get out of your educa- tion the thing for which it is given to you-a richer, fuller, stronger life, of which the world shall receive the benefit. I do not think that it is your business just now to invent a new plan and devise all the tneans for securing this resu It. On the contra- ry, I think that if you try to work out an orig- inal educational n1ethod and course for your- self you will probably waste a good deal of time-which as I have just ren1indcd you, is ' ' money, and other people's tnoney, too.. The general schen1e and syste1n of education, with the improven1ents suggested by experience, and the variations nee{led to adapt it to differ- ·ent individuals, is there waiting for you. If you are wise, you will put yourself into it not w·ith flabby indifference, nor with blind resig- nation, bnt vdth the clear and steady purpose of making it grve you just as much as possible for the train in~ of your n:1ind 11nd for the in- crease of your power as a person and of your worth as a 1nen1ber of so~..:iety. T,ake your stucUes as they come, but 1nake them count for son1ething before they go. 1'hey will be of two kinds: those that you like, and those you disiike. lJse the forn1er to de- velop your natural gifts, and the latter to cor- rect yonr natura1 defects.

A s.~~>Jnd-ci<=t·;;; tnind well cultivated will yield a gn~.tt deal trl.Jrc than a first-class rnind left fallow. .All that you have to do is to 1nake your own gard .::::1 (not so n1e other n1an's) give the be.::;t crop of which it is capable. Exat.ninations and grade·.; and class- room marks are\ goven1n1ent crop estirnate•;,\ As a rule, they are fairly accurate. But, after all, it is not the estitnate, but the crop itself that cotnes to market and feeds the world. You know what you have learned. And you have learned just as tnuch as you know. Make your frientb with a purpose of enlarg- ing your life, your tastes, your sytnp:lthies, your hopes. .Follow your inclinations in fonn- ing acquaintances, but keep your eyes open, and see where they are leading you. Unless you enjoy a friendship it is not 1 ikely to be of tnuch good to you. But, on the other hand, unless it really does you good, your joy in it will grow· barren, or turn to pain. I-Iave some friends to who1n you look up, and some who look up to you. Be a grateful receiver as well as a gen· erous giver. Let the secrets you share with yout ftien ds be such as will n1ake you not a~ sharned, but glad, tu look deeper into each other's eyes. Play the out-of-doors games that suit you and give you honest pleasure. 'l'hey will SLlf- fice to give you all the physical trai uing that you need. The object of athletic sports an1ong atnateurs is twofold: first, to relax and amuse

'l'here is no advantage in cultivating- !Tlore n1uscle than you are [ikely to have any nse for unless you are go·ing to be a professional athlete. On the contrJ.ry, it is a burden and: a danger. \Yhat you want is a body that will be a ready, cheerful, and capa- ble servant to your mind. Do not starve or neglect the spiritual side of your nature. The best and wise~t ~men of the world have all agreed that a full and noble life is not possible for man without religion. It would be a poor outcorne for you and for the world if your education should end in that half- knowledge which, as Lord Bacon says, tends to athei:stn. But even atheis1n, it seen1s to rne, is better t l1an the dead and dry religion which exists without praise, without good works, .. with- out personal prayer. Give your best thought, your deepest feelings to the subject that means most-t l1:e true and i1n1nortal1ife that is brought to light in. Jesus Christ. A hundred questions, and some of them very perplexing, are sure to meet you as you go on witl1 your education. Do not try to an- ticipate the1n. Do not try to answer them now. Let yourself go, with a good heart and a cheerful courage, into the course that opens before you. Take yot1r pri\ 7 ilege with its obligations. Let the world pay for your liv- ing now. But make sure that your education fits you to pay the world back for all you have received, in a life equipped and disciplined for fine service an1ong tnen. Faith fully yours, Princeton University.

A word to the wise should uc sufficient, yet it often fails. The Concot·dy has tried to bring on t the unse] fish element in College Spirit this year by siding against politics; but it seems as if its labors have .been at least partly vain. \Vhom the Gods destroy they first make mad or politicians. \Ve do not hesitate to say that never in the past four years has there been such wholesa Ie grnft in co11ege as there is now. The. little hollow honor which may come from underhand measures is in keeping with the characters of the men. who pose as leaders in CoBegi:- affairs. There are some whose very names cause others to bend their knees. Well, the Concorcly genuflects with a difference. If the student body will persist in being duped and befooled at every turn they not only show themselves to be fatuous but they injure the College by not putting the right man in the right place. If U nio~1 men are sick of the vdwJ e thing 2nd fall into apathy and inaction, that :rdll not help matters nor reflect credit upon them. The prob I em is one which will continue to exist until the sober-mh1ded and loyal element in College solves it by united and de- tennined action. Truth and Although the Press Clnb is the official regulator of College news in the papers, it cannot curb everything: it can only Fiction. suggest and occasionally censure. \\Ve note the following items from the local papers of last week: \Phonographs are to be used in the Modern Language Department.'' \The College session will be ten weeks longer next year.'' \Commencement is on June I7th this year.\ Those and similar statements College reporters unblush- ingly submit to the unsuspecting editors. It \Vould be 'Well for the student body to do what it can to suppress any news, in so far as possible, which is not strictly true. Before long \Ve may be reading in blazing headlines: \ Professor's pet jackal has a Dermoid Cist.\ SOMETIME.

TRACI{ ATIILETICS., The call for hard work and training on the part of the candidates for the Track tean1 has been issued and the work is under way. The result of this Spring's Track Season depends entirely lll)On the earnes(ness and the willino·- ., b ness to do his best of each student who in any THE OONU:ORDIENSIS. 11 way wishes to help the Track team to victory anct so further the interests of his college. At present \Ye note many things which 1nay tend to make this season a. success. In the first place we have not lost tnany men by grad- uation and we have a stronger nucleus of capable rnen in three upper classes than we have had fu.r several years. In the second place ·we are fortunate in having secured the serv1ces of a good coach, 1\'Ir. \Villiam \V. Tbon1pson, who proved so vainab1e to the 1902 tea1n, is under contract to coach this ye~n·'s tean1 fnnn Apri:l I 8th until ·the Han1il~ ton Iv1eet of Iv1ay 28th. l\Tr. Thon1pson is ll1\)St enthusiastic in his work and should be gi yen the best of support by the students in bi~ efforts to turn out a winning tean1. Anothec encouraging feature has been the showing 1nade by the ljreshmen in the two inter-class meets that have been held. Col- burn, Harvey, \Vhite, \Vaite, Rohinson, 1\tiaure, Richarclsun and Keigher have .given evidence of their ability. It is up to the1n now to inake good. l3csicles these n1en there are n1any . · others in the Freshman slass equally good who are ready this spring to do their best toward making the tea111. There will be plenty of chance for each m~n to sho\v his worth in the tneets \Ve are to have this ~pring. Besides the Trinity and Han1ilton 1neets, \vhich are sureties, we will probably baxe a n1eet \vith R.ochester at Roc hester on J\fa y 21st. \Vi t h three n1eets in which to con1pete tbere are a11 sorts of chanc- es fur n1cn to do credit to thL\ir college and win their u_ It \VOtlld be a shame if \Ve djd not \\vin at le~lst two of tl1ese meets.

As regards the different events for which men are in training it would be welt to say that we are in need of g·<H>d men for each event and tots of them.

1~ THE CONOOI{DIENSIS. the satne one. 1'he tnor:e n1en that try for an e\,.,·ent, the better showing will ·we be able to n1ake in that event in a meet, especially a dual meet. It is far better to have a we'll balanced teatn for dual meets than to ha\·e a couple of s;tars, and we will have a well bala11ced teatn if every man does his share ~u1<J does not lea Ye the burden of the work,. to fall upon a few rnen. \Ve are nH1re in need of rnen for the Ioo and long dis- tance runs than for any other event, and i~ would be well for as nutny as possible lo enter these events in thr inter-cl ~tss tneet to be helu on the oval, April 29th. The oLject of this meet is to give the coach and captain a defi- nite idea of the ability of the tnen and the events fur which each ,jg best suited.

Union, with a patched-up t.ea1n, :lost to 'V:il- liams last Saturday in a closely contested and well played game. The Garnet played re- markably good hall, p:-1.rticularly in considera- tion of the fact that O'Brien was pitching his first game; that Ferns donned the mask and mitt with absolutely no experience; that this was R.idcr's first game of the year at first, and that the ground about third ·was unexp 1ored territory to Goff. The two errors credited to the infield \vere due to the 111ulldy diatnond. The 'ViHiarns tnen won through their hitting, while Union could do nothing with the splen- did twirling of 'V adsworth, ·while 0 'Brien was not hit freely, yet the hits came when they were needed; five of the eight being for more than one bas.e. Union's onlyrun can1e in the sixth. O'Brien reached first on vVatson's 1nuff of a thrown ball, took second on JVIabar's out at fu~st, stole third and jogged borne on I:fagar'.s · pretty hit to center field. One of the features of the game was a sen- · sational stop and throw to first by ''Jack '' I\'lahar. The play was roundly applauded by the spectators. Nesbit. \Villiatn's third base- man, also made a pretty catch of a ~iliicu1t fly, running far out into left field before he could get und ~r it. The su tnmary: UNION. AD. R. H. PO. A. E.

The forest leaves were faintly tinged with their autunnal hue, while the very air itself seemed to rouse some latent hunting instinct in the breather. From over a little wooded knoll came a faint jingle, as of clanking tinware, and the unmistakable swish of corduroy. Now came a \vord or two, faintly spoken, as three pack- laden campers filed slowly into view over the crest of the rise. Swinging wearily and stolidly along the rough trail, they paid no heed to the surroundings or to each other. A slouchy, swarthy, half-breed, in moccasins and bending under the largest pack, led the way. 'I' he trailing two had a dejected, listless manner as they forged ahead, while torn clothes and the battered appearance of their outfit spoke plainly of hardships undergone an.d days passed in ranging through the woods. This was a party of hunters returning from a hunting ca111p in the mountains. All signs, however, went to show that success had not been theirs. No trace of venison, for this be- yond doubt had been their quest, was visible either in the battered pack-baskets, ·or the weighty burden of the guide. The wary dee1~, sought day after day in his own haunts, had baffled thern. Now they were emerging again into civilization, dissap- pointed, but rich in a store of health and new . expenence. Through the silent \voods. the little party filed on. A squirrel rasped inquiringly from a ~ neighboring beech as he watched the passing, and once a partridge, surprised in her after- noon meal, got up from beside the trail and whirred noisily into a dense thicket. The trail was leading now through a thick piece of second growth forest. I-Iere and there black stubs projected. Evidendy, years ago, a for- est fire had run over this track. It was excellent feeding ground for deer, but the fact, which only a bit previously would have arrested their attention, gave them no in- terest now. 'I'here was never a chance of meeting up with a deer on the way out. If the guide thought of the matter at all, he showed no sign. 1:-lis pack, containing the greater part of the heavy duffle, took all light- er thoughts from his mind. The trail led them over a slight rise of ground. Beyond lay a little wooded gully, through which ran a tiny stream. The hunt- ers, hot and thirsty, stooped to drink, packs and rifles laid aside. Joe, the breed, had risen and stood filling his pipe from a dingy le·ather bag. 1'he others, face down on the mossy bank were drinking joyously from the cool stream. Fifty paces away a twig. snapped. Joe was rigid, his black eyes shifting restlessly through the tangled underbrush. Still peer- ing sharply into the woods, he stooped to one knee and touched the drinking sportsman be- fore him. The man sprang up quickly, aflush with ex- citement. There was a short, quick snort, a bush shook strangely and the watchers caught a glimpse of a defiant white flag fluttering atnidst the foliage. A mad scramble for guns took place and all fired hastily as a streak of gray crossed the trail a hundred yards ahead. All three scored n1isses at the running target. This they plainly knew from the occasional glimpses caught through the trees of the flee- ing deer. The frightened animal was running swiftly, leaping fallen lo.gs and brush with ease, tail defiantly up . . Although the contents of two rifle maga- ;zines were pumped rapidly at the escaping

It a{ways drops when the animal is hit. 41 Overcome by the realization that no furthet hope of a shot remained to them, with the settlement only a half mile distant, the disap- pointed hunters vainly sought solace in a smoke beside the scene of the encounter. The chance so long wished for, had ,come and gone, leaving them at this last ,moment, when success rrlight haTe crowned their efforts, emp- ty-handed as before. A detailed rehearsal of the unexpected and · e~citing event followed, but all knew as they resumed the galling pack straps that this was the last chance. 1..,hey catne, about dusk, into the little back- woods settlement and though the broiled veni- son which they put away that evening at its little mountain inn tasted exceeding1y good, there came-a touch of bitterness as they won- dered why they had failed in bringing in their own.-F. B. C. 'o6 ACROSS TI-lE CONTINENT. By Stephen S. Read, 'oo. April 14-To describe, in detail, the trip, would be too lengthy for this article. We must he cohtent to view only the few interesting in- cidents and wait for a more detailed account, when the writer shall have been privileged in the future, to visit his Alma Mater. After leaving Bath, Friday, Novetnber 27, w,e retired early, partly to gain the needed rest and partly to drown the lonesotneness that was creeping over us. Speeding across the plains of Ohio and the level and bleak Indiana country, we ran into Chicago about 6 p. 1n. Grabbing our baggage and leaping into a bus \four deep,'' we were driven pell n1ell through the dirty streets ,of Chicago. Early Sunday morning we landed f\,t St. Paul.. f[ere l r~m~in~d ~or ;l four days' THE OONOORDIEN,SIS. 7 visit, during which time, I visited po,ints of in ... terest, such as Minnesota's rich agriculture lands, the University of Minnesota and Hiawa~ tha's famous Minneha:ha Falls. From Minneapolis we started on our journey of 1,47,5 mHes to Spokane, Wash. Through North Dakota the wind btew a terrible gale, so swift that it is doubtful vvhether the snow had touched the ground for two days. So strong was the wind we faced that frequently our en- gine stopped between stations to steam up, then the wheels would freez~ to the rails. At Minot, N. D., I ventured out to find the coldness not very noticeable, so drr was the air ! Eut the wind, wind ! Yet for all this, North Dakota is rich in her productive farm lands. When we passed into ivfontana the storm had abated, the sun was bright, the air clear. cold and dry. The morniro:g sun revealed countless glittering diamonds upon the frosty prairie grass. Eastern and Middle Montana is one vast plain over which large herds of cattle graze, while Western Montana is more hilly and rocky, yet thousands of cattle feed over this grassy plain. Falling into conversation with a gentlemanly cultured rancher, who had been out ''rounding up \ cattle, I learned much about herding cattle upon the Western plains. Very seldom are the stock taken up and fed, but are allowed to graze over larger tracts. The sweet grass js very nutritive and the juice supplies the stock with proper water. Occa- sionally could be seen a man or woman astride the little Cayuse, hurrying across the plain to keep the stock collected. Scattered over the vast plain the grazing cattle appeared like specks in the distance. Others near the track were plump and hearty. \Vhen a rancher sells, he ''rounds up'' the kerd, picks out the ones bearing his brand, then lets the others go. Each rancher endeavers to keep his stock with- in one day's travel of his ranch. Mile after mile we sped over the vast prairie, even to the foot hills of the Roc,kies, \Vi th here and there a rancher's hut; but ever dotted with grazing cattle. The scene waf> impressive. A raneh-

But I n1ust hurry on-Suddenly we beheld the snow-capped peaks of the Rockies, tcnver- ing, 'like white church steeples far above the plains.

I stepped ont to view the town. The scene was beyond ci(lscription. vVitb high mountains n pon every side, it was as though one were in a deep walled roon1, with no ceiling, save the canopy of heaven and all painted a rich 1!0lden hue, by the setting sun. At 3 a.m. Decetnber 5, we ran into SpokanE'. rfhe following day was clear, ancl \Vann, with a bright sun. The city is rightly natned Spok- an, \ The land of the Sun.'' From here I visit- ed the Crystal Marble Cotnpany's quarries, 7 5 n1iles north of Spokane. Two pleasant days ·were spent in catnp at the quarries in the rnoun- tains. 0 the tin1ber, timber everywhere !

Leaving the inland .metropolis of the west, I made for Seattle, 2,85 5 miles fron1 Bath. T'he ride through the scenic Cascades and down Ttunwater Canyon was appalling. \Yhen we ran into Seattle, Oh the fog, the rain and the rnud ! \Water '\VJ.ter e\·ei-y'Nhere and not a drop to drink.\ Yet the hustling, bustling heterogenous population of I Io,oe>o do nol tnind the rain and mtJd This hilly and terrac- ed city possesses a co1ntnanding view of Puget Sound-that landlocked sea.

At Seattle I tnet a frienJ, a forrner Schenecta- dy man who is president of the New York Seattle copper n1ine, in the Cascades. Nothing was left but to visit the rnines. John J. Elliott, my old classmate accon1panied us and we went by rail 70 miles north east to Index, a stnall place, frotn which one tnight well wonder how he could escape, so cotnpletely is it surrounded by high mountains. Stradling little Indian ponies, we followed a narrow trail fourteen n1iles up the tnountain. T'he forest is one n1ass of vine, fur, cedar and spruce trees, each vying with the others to see which could kiss the sky, as they reached upward, straight as an arrow, for over 300 feet. At the txlines I entered the deep tunnel and assisted in bringing out a car of rich ore. Returning after a few days so- journ here, we saw four large black bears across a deep ravine. The consoling thought in this scene was that \ Between us and you there is a great gu 1f fixed ; so that they which would pass fron1 hence to you cannot ; neither can they pass to us that would come fron1 thence.'' Farther down, another black bear sauntered across our trail and obstructeJ our passage for a moment, bL1t tnuch to my satisfaction the an- ilnal scatnpered in to the fore st.

CONCORDIENSIS 1 Single Copies, TERMS: $2.oo per Year, in Advance ro Cents Publication Office: Oneonta, N. Y. Address all communications to THE CoNCORDIENSIS, Union College, Schenectady, N. Y. The. Broader In a recent number of The Winthrop Vision. College Journal, one of our very best exchanges, there is an editorial which pleads earnestly for the broader culture in the college life of today. The truth of the argument is put so aptly and the conditions it sets forth are so app1icable to many Union students that we take the liberty of quoting it in part: \The majority of students who go to college seem to think that .the only thing they can do is to- select a course of study, which bas probably been mapped out for .them; and devote their whole time to this. As far as it goe~ .J this is to be commended, as it is always a very good plan to have some definite course to pursue. But one who does this and this alone is not accomplishing half of what he ought to at that college. Every student recognizes the necessity for his develop· ment mentaUy, morally and physically; and yet he goes on neglecting one phase of his nature for .anotherl which finally results in the abnormal development of one side of his character and the weakening of the other two sides. A student who has m:ade the best of his ti111e at college will have developed every phase of his chamcter possible. A broa~ minded, cultured student will not only get a great deal more pleasure and good from life himself, but he will be able to help others to receive pleasures and benefits. What every student needs is the wide, ·general culture which can only come from the symmetrical development of all three phases of human nature.'' Track Athletics. It has been quite a while since Cap~ tain Raymond of the Track team is- sued the first call for candidates. So far only a very small squad has reported and it, is dis· couraging, especially when it is well known that there is athletic ability going to waste simply on account of lazi~ ness, which is sometimes synonymous with a lack of col- lege spirit. Coach Thompson is a man who puts all his energy and experience into training the candidates for the different events and can be relied on to develop a first class team if he has the necessary support. He is willing and glad to give every man a chance and he knows in what direction each one is most likely to prove a success. The argument of not having time is old as the shirker and is scarcely ever valid. Surely every man who has the least ability can spare half an hour ~ach afternoon for the benefit of his college ancl for his own physical well· being, for that is a natural effect. If you try it once you may find your forte andieven if you do not set any records, you will not regret having shown that you do care about Union's track athletics. ,':

Ah yes, but then 'twas old; From childhood we had seen the honey-bee Go lagging home, so filled was he with sweets; We had seen the roistering brook go tumbling· on Until in some cool, scented wood it fell Asleep in broad, deep pools upon whose breast, The water-lilies dream throughout the night. 'rV e had heard the distant lowing of the kine At nightfall, the sleepy croak of frogs, and know That on the river's brink the rustling reeds Were nodding drowsily and teUing tales Of love and woe about the silent-flowing stream, Beneath.

What must It be,, we thought, to live in such a land, \Vhere colors soft as rainbow hues must fill The air, and where the morn.ing sun first kissed The dews away, and lingered fondly where The valleys far below were hushed and still ?
