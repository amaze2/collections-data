Exehange Editor An Unusual Development Harold Van de Car, Union's Director of Development, and usually a competent commentato1·, apparently needs a little journalistic redevelopment. Last Tuesday, in chapel, he suggested that the News Editor of Concordy had some evil, anti-Republican plot in mind when he selected Richard Sobol, chairman of the Students for Stev- enson group here, to cover Professor Schmidt's pro-Demo- cratic chapel talk. He also intimated that under the cir- cumstances, the story could hardly be unbiased and un- colored. Even assuming that an individual was asked to cover Professor Schmidt's talk merely because he was an active Democrat, the question still must be raised, if a Democrat won't write an objective story about another Democrat's speech, who will? If 1\ir. Van de Car had taken the pains to check the masthead he W<>uld have noticed Richard Sobol's name listed on the reportorial staff, as it has been all semester. He was picked to write the story because the editor felt that he was a competent reporter and conscientious enough to write objectively in spite of any personal political lean- ings.

What possible forces could there be be- hind him to give such a wormy weasel such great powers? In answering these questions, Pssstt! staff members · unearthed the en- tire ta.le. We now present, in summary forni, - The ~ Coznowski Story. ·Melvin was very active as a child. He wouid hurry home froon . school and spend · an hour prac- ticing on his blow gun . Tiring of this , 'he might wander outside and kill an ~lley cat or throw stones at little girls passing by. 'While watching television, 'he would boo Howdy Doody and Buffalo Bob. Once , he smashed the screen with the butt of a toy he received . for his birthday, a submachine gun, in the middle of Ding Dong School. One day he filled a bucket with scalding hot water and poured it on the maihnan .from a second story window . He had quite a reputation as · a . practical joker. · dent. He ran tl~e mile in 4:12.2. Although lie seldom cracked a. book, he wound up with a 4.4 in- dex. He ran the mile in 4:11 flat. A boor and a social dud, he had dates with the prettiest and best liked girls in the vicinity, and was rumored to have had several \affairs.\ He ran the mile in 4:13.5. Coznowski did things that no one else would do, and thus be- came even nore despised , He returned books to the . library, praised the fooq at West College, sang the school songs in chapel, and cheered a.t football games. He was a complete o1,1tca.st. The oniy really memorable thing he did at Union was to com- pose a song. !Je wrote a fe~ notes of it each time he took hxs heroin shot. It is a song still ::mng at most fraternity- parties around campus ..

His Bosom Friend Pssst! F...xclusive by Ira · Halperin We all know that a. college pres-~ . · · · · · · !dent's business prevents him him from l;>eing arou118 campus all the time, But . is · it \):msi'hess\ that calls Union's president away from his comfortable Nott Street home so often? Just how \busy\ is Carter · Davidson on a. typicai weekend. Two weeks · ago .the honorable . Dr. Davidson ostensi!Jly made a trip to attend the Small College Conference on Milking Funds .at Rochester. Luckily, :Pssstt!'s rov- ing undercover agent on campus . Dirty Linen Nussbaum, caught a: secret . glimmer in . . Carter's eye and noticed that his Homburg was titlted at a suspiciously racy angle. Dirty Linen quickly added this incrimin<~oting information to the fact that on the past Tuesday chapel program, President David- son had sung a: inore-than-lusty version of ''Ode to Dear Old Un- ion\ and decided that here was a story fit for Psssttf \Cherche la femme\ our indominable Nuss- baum muttered delightedly to himself . as he boarded the plane for Rochester in the ingenious guise · of a Good Humor Man. At Rochester, Dirty Linen quickly donned a blol!k R and mingled with the undergraduates to see whether he might dredge up a few more interesting bits of gossip before Davidson arrived. On the way to look up a couple of coeds he learned about dredg- ing, Dirty Lfnen saw Carter smile at a pretty young Rochester freshman as he was being shown about the can-tpW~. At last Nussbaum was on to sly old Prexy. Quite clever of him to secretly arra.tl/?:e for a ren- dezilous with a Rochester coed while pretending to pick up some pointers on how to untie alumni purses at the Small College Con- ference. But the mystery was by no means unraveled, for Dirty Linen still had to find the site of Carter's bide-wway-from~Union, where the president lured coeds out for a. thrill~ So our intrepid reporter decid- ed to follow Davidson about after dinner, after trying to get a prom date with those coeds he dredged u . p. Eight ci!clock thus found Dirty Linen · lounging casually be- hind the front door of the dean's of men's home at Rochester, where . the . delegates to the Small College Confercnc.;e were having a cocktail party. Jotting fever- ishly in his small black notebook, Nussbaum knew that the time when Davidson would have to consummate his relationship with the coed was .fast approaching, for her curfew was at one and Carter hadn't yet emerged: from tile party. \Bolstering up his courage, eh,\ thought Dirty Linen with the inexorable logic of a . true rePorter. At last the party ended and Ca11ter entered a cab to take him to his hotel. Dirty Linen breath- lessly rushed to his waiting car and followed Prexy to the best hotel in Rocheste11. \Covering up your sins with a respectable fa- cade, old boy,\ thought o1,1r man Nussbaum as he took the eleva- tor to the Davidson. suite. Stand- ing undaunted in front of the ' apartment, Di:rty Linen heard · the ;;how~r turn on and a little later the deep 'bass tones of a voice crooning. \W . e've traveled down the Mohawk vale ... \ emanated from within the apartment. \Poor girl,\ Dirty Linen mut- tered sadly to himself as he turn- ed down the corridor, finished the · last sentence of his expose, and closed ' his notebook, \but we've finally caught Cru ~ ter in the act. The voice · lVI as the inevitable give- away:\ Pssstt! · ha.s publif;lhed this · story of Carter's lost weekend as a warning to those foolish under- grads who think that the strange twinkle in Prexy's eye as he hums a. little song to himself while walking down campus is an inno- cent one. The old academic eye hasn't lost that gleam yet. --------~------------------ CARTER DAVIDSON Pssstt!

Finkel- stein, originator of the Joe Fink · backhand serve, has al!ways been an a . stute stUdent of the game, and w>ill use his nffiV' book, \The Importance of Footwork in Bad- minton,\ as a ·basic text -in coach- ing the new sport. Another neJWI sport that will · be introduced at Union, probrubiy in 1958, rwill be creWI racing on the Mohawk River. It js : rumorP.d that the rea.Son for reviving this water sport is :because Harvard University has been demandifig for the past 117 yeav.s that UniQn give them the · opportunity to win baclt their original color, garnet. Although no coach bas been aP- pointed yet, TeQ. . Beek, a, leading stu:dent i:t;J. Music lOa, is writing a fight song for the creil\\ enti- tied Row, Bow, Row Your Boat. The Board of Visitors also re- ported that the new at~letic pro- gram ·would be unsuccessful un- less top grade athletes cou,ld be induced to . attend Union. Conse- quently, President Davidson, Dean .Huntley; and Director of Admissions Jonathan Pearson, secretly met to discuss this new problem. The outcome of this meeting was that athletic scholarships and grants-in-aid ' rwill 'be offered for the first time at Union. Top scholarship ~ill 1be the 13ailey Memorial Scholar::;hip, which of- fers $2,000 per year to a deserv- ing athlete. Among the 17 other scholarships :will be otfered next year, are the Seward Scholarship for Descendents of Civil War Veterans, a scholarship given by the class of '49 for footlball ta9-kles or guards, ~d a Veteran's Ad- ministration Alward to be award- ed to veterans ll'liho received the purple heart. These three schol- arships are good for full tuition for four years at Union. Davidson emphasized that \of course athletes on . . scholarship rwlill naturally be expected to keep their indexes llp;\ He !idded, however; that a slight benefit IWIOuld be given to the atl:iletes. This ' \benefit\ Is a new· series of courses 'W'hich naturally. will have the same high level of schol- arship as all other conrses at Union, but will te~d to hold spec- Ial interest for athletes. The .courses are devided rough- ly into tw9 sections, tentatively entitled Physical Edueation and Hygiene ~;~.nd Physical Culture and Relaxation.

This news is not start- ling to those wbo have seen the inspired eleven play, but to others it will require an explanation. The second of three Garnet up. sets was over Hobart by a 20-7 score . Hobart beat St. Lawrence 54-0, thus malting Union 67 points better than St. Lawrence. That team lost to Buf.fa.lo by 29, 41-1~ leaving Union with a 3S.point bulge. Bucknell lost to Buffalo 31-13, and Deiaware beat Bucknell 2-6-7, giving Union 37 points . better than Delaware and 25 better than Connecticut, which beat Delaware 26-14. Connecticut, by virtue of its 27-7 victory • , over Rutgers, which was smeared by Colgate 48-6, leaves the Garnet with a three-point bulge over the Red Raiders of Colgate.

'Who but a man clearing a tidy sum in bets. That evening, as we sat be- m.mlning our fate, a couple of runners burst into our office and made us get into their car. Ketz was taking no chances of our not paying off! The car raced wildly onto thE;! Skidmore road and followed that route for fif- teen minutes. Then, in a · deso- late area, the car turned off onto a dirt road toward the quiet shaclt pictured above. But once inside the little shack, ·blazing lights suspended from basketball hoops flooded us in a drunken, smoking mass of col- lege men and women from the best schools in the East.

As I took out my wallet to pay him off, I cas- ually snapped his picture with my cigarette lighter In which was cleverly concealed a tiny Graflex with flash attachment. After carefully counting the money, Ketz slowly smiled and said, \Why don't you enjoy your- selves, the drinks are on me, or rather, on Williams.\ Stunned, we reentered the noisy h~ll and began . picking and threading our way through the shouting throng. Trudging slowly d-own the path toward route 50, I said to my fel- low reporters, \Nobody will be- lieve us.

Unfortunately, he finds that educational matters (a paper due Monday) must once again in-· terfere with his SOClia.l. life. (This means that at the last minute, September 24, he found himself without a date for the Big Bla.llt. Actually he just couldn't find a girl that shared his· vie~vs. But then again, how many people DO believe that Assistant Garbage Collector of Caracas, Venezuela., should be an honora;:ry position?) He realizes that y-ou will have to work h.ard to bea.r the strain of the absence of his presence. Nevertheless, he wishes yilu well on this festive occasion and reminds you that he will be back with you once a:gatn . next week. Clyde n ,.. tit'\ ....

The Missing Tickets We cannot go alono· with those who have portrayed Athletic Director Ketz ~s some soi:'t of villain, smiling as he ca..hnlv handed tickets to alumni over the pleading·, out- stretched hands of students. He \\'as, however, guilty of a serious errol' in judgment concerning the intensity of demand for the free passes. Certainly, he has made a mis- take, !Jut that's hardly a reason for a mob to assemble in front of his home, exploding firec1·ackers, displaying signs in th€ worst of taste, and shouting abusive language. On the other han,d, we cap't. blame the students who were i11citefl :.o ~hls m&b crctfoh, either. They had received fc~r from a fair deal. They felt that they deserved the free passes as much as those who h.ad gotten them, and more than alumni, who can much more easily afford to buy them. In addition, they were in a position where they n1.ight not be able to get tickets even if they were willing to !Jay $2 apiece. Add to that a warm night and some surplus spirit and the mob is easily explained. But that still doesn't make it right. 'To start vdth, it f'hould be brought up in 1\lr. Ketz' defense that it was he who played a large part in organ- izing- the whole exchange ticket prog-ram. Without that, no one would get any free passes. But we do find it difficult to figure out how he could have so vastly under- estimated the student demand. 1Ie argued that only about 200 students took advan- tage of the free ticket offer two years ago. But even if that figure is correct, he should have reserved at least 20() tickets for students instead of the 160 which he did. Not only that, but he had announced that 200 student tickets would be available. IIIr. Ketz was certainly aware of the <:omparative records of the football team now and two years ago. At this time in 1934, the Garnet eleven had a 3-3-1 mark as compared to 5-2 this year. Not only is Union assured of its best record in the memories of all its students but it ha..s a~hie':ed that mark as al!- underdog, scoring exditing upset v1ctones. These factors are all important in trying to determine what the ticket demand will be, because the demand is proportional to interest in the team, and interest hasn't been higher at any time in the past four years. Attempting to judge demand by attendance at the Williams game, or at any game played at Union this season, was another error. True, we upset Vermont, but losses to Amherst and Rochester didn't promise a very good season. Student support at the RPI game wasn't the best. But we had a 1-2 record going into the game and we figured to beat the Engineers anyway. But then, it might be argued, shouldn't have the attendance at the Williams game been good after our upset victory over Hobart the week before? Wouldn't the ]aclc of student support at the Williams contest indi- cate some sort of apath;y which would mean that the demand for tickets for the Hamilton battle would be even less than two years ago? Not at all. Because just about no?~dy thought we had a chance in the world against W1l11ams. touted as one of the top Little Ivy powerhouses. Why g-o to a game at which we were supposed to get slaughtered ? \V e did win, though, and the victory brought spirit to a ne-w peale The Kings Point game the following week was an anticlimactic rehearsal, fought in the bitter cold for the -eontest tomorrow. ' To sum up, this season the team has scored three dramatic upset victories climaxed by the thrilling, last- quartel' win over Williams, in amassing its best record since 1949. Hamilton has a 5-l mark. And yet, 40 less tickets were reserved this year than in 1954. There was !l serious flaw in Mr. Ketz' thinking when he decided how many passes to hold for students. But we think his en-or was one of omission, notr commission. Also_, it is quite easy to sit in retrospective judgment on a decision. It is a lot easier to show why an event happ~ned after the occurrence than to predict it. While the shortage of tickets has put a slight damper on the :plans of many to attend the contest, the controversy has .11-t the same time brought interest in the game to a new high. Even without tickets we doubt if any Union students will be turned away at the gate, and it appears as if the1·e will be a record turnout. Now, we just hope Unit>n wins.

Camedy as depicted by Bus- ter Keaton belongs to the school Charlie Chaplin o-rig:jnated; the humor is derive& frorn a cen- tralized, rather 11 ello.developed character, instead of relying upon situation for the comedy. Keaton, however, had an excep- tionally dry, mechanical and repetitive quality. He achieved an even greater comic effect by having the character ·he created assun.e an unvarying personal- ! ty, one of utterly ridiculous stoicism. Keaton's style was to incor- porate this figure, essentially l::!.umorou.s in itself, 11\lith an acute sense of the ludicrous. Keaton's comic hero, -with his inscrutable mask, invariably scelts to con- trast himself with other objects. This contrast of :shapes and sizes, in Keaton's films, is car- ried to other forrns, so that Kea- ton tries to prov<>ke humor f.irst on the visual level. Ei:s greatest mainstay for ~reating hUI!lor, however, is the more subtle con- trast of the sober-faced little man forever involving hirus·elf in in- credible situations and maneu- vering his rigid llody \\ ith the agility of an acrob:at. With these essentials, the Keaton film em- ploys a minimum of detail with a maximum effect. Whether or not a.n individual will find Keaton hurr<orous, ho-w~ ever, depends upon w·hether or net he is 'Willing to. -concede that Keaton's action are possible.

We Wonder. • • Once again, we will attempt to direct attention .to several situations on campus which might have otherwise gone unnoticed. by speculating about them. This evening, at 7 and 9 P.M., in which :Eisenstein treats his in EE 22, QUe of the w<>rld's subject.

When ground -will be broken for the new library, since the funds for that most necessary building have reached such gargantuan p11oportions that the student aid which was offered was rejected? If the HPC will consider the purchase of a telescope for the top of the Nott l\Iemorial library or gold plated door knobs for, all rooms in Bailey Hall after they have installed a clock on West College? If the recent jazz concert held by the Rathskeller will prove a turning point in its fight to remain solvent? When some new records will be added to the library's current collection? If other campus activities will follow the HPC's lead in providing for the Hungarian refugees? How the Student Council can get enough ads for the Blotter without approaching local firms? How many times the rules which the HPC set up last year regarding pledge.rides and hell week have been vio- lated already? Whether or not anyone intends to do anythinO' about the present sorry state of Eliphalet Nott's three-~heeled carriage? , Whether ID ·cards will really be worth the money which tne Student Council will have to expend to secure them? ESL Letter to the Editor To the Editor of Concordiensis: It sometimes amazes me how perfectly some cliches describe the personality and actic>ns of peo- ple we know, For example, take the old phrases: \Give him a hand and he'll tike an arm\ and \he oites the very hand tl:ta.t feeds him.\ Does it convey a picture of someone to your mind? To most of us I think it does, It is the picture of a man Vi·ho, tlmJugh his keen business ability and salesmanship, took over the man- rugement of the West College cafeteria three years ago, and, since t4at time, has been pusl:ting an ever ·growing snovvball of dis- satisfaction and discontent to the size where, hy all principles of economics, fairness, and in telli- gence, lt should be ahle to roll no farther. It has been obvious, it seems, to- everyone but the administra- tion, that this man bas gone to every effort to cut down his overhead to such an extent that the quality of his food has been reduced to the lowest possible level of toleration. The chef does all he can to .D:Jiake the food palat- able (and let us add, that he does an excellent job with the food he is supplied with), however even his skiJI cannot hide the basement quality of the food. Mr. Fleishman is guaranteed, because of the coompulsory sale of meal tickets to freshmen, of a minimum 'daily patronage (prob- ably somew'here in the area of 300), and thus escapes, to a large degree, the everyday risks of overbuying and spoilage taken by othez- restaurant owners in the purchasing of their food. How does he respond to his increased security? Mr. Fleishman has brought down the quantity and quality of his food to such an ex- tent that some freshmen are even sacrificing costly mea.! tickets to eat elsewhere, rather than suffer- ing through another Fleishman meal and leaving the dining room hungry. If one wishes to examine what I have said about the quality of the food, aU he need do is eat in, the West ColJege cafeteria. It is obvious to anyone who has come from a home where any type of half-way decent food is served that the quality of the food <mainly the meat) is distinctly below what he has been accus- tomed to. Mr. Fleishman, as a reward for his fair play and thoughtful con- sideration of the students has, this year, been given the manage- ment of the Hale House cafeteria to toy with. It does not take a very keen observer to see that Hale House, which last year was overflowing with students every evening because of the high qual- ity and abundant quantity of the food served, is now a \ghost\ cafeteria at dinner time. It's easy to guess the reason. land!I}arks. sation of their vitality. Having to meet the more-than- rigoro-us standards of Soviet cen- sorship, the Russian film has naturally tended to depict the cruelty of the czarist regi:me and the benefits afford'ed by Com- munistic society. Although Rus- sian directors could therefore not neglect .the propaganda con- tent of their films, some, lik'€1 Eisenstein, -could still utilize their tren•endous a.Mlity to•ward ex- pressing their ov,n creative in- stincts, even if their personal view of life had to be ·subordia- ated to the State's. Since the suhject matter of the Russian film therefore had to deal with the mass of people ra- ther than with individuals, their films quite natu:rally ap·proac·h the level of epic. Th'e theme of Battleship Potemkin superficially resembles the theme of a group of recent American productions on the style of T.he Caine Mutiny; the cmw of a Russian battleship rebels against their superiors on account of tyranpous treatment. But fl'O'rr< here on in the simi 1- arity becomes obscured, for the ship sails into the ·port of Odessa 'V.here it is 'warmly received by the populac.e, :\\ ho are sulbse- quently reward'ed f(}r their pains 'by an attack from the local mili- tary forces. The picture's climax comes when the battleship fin- ally meets the remaindez- of the Russian fleet. · This theme is epic, therefore, because Eisenstein portrays the <lollective spirit of the battleship's crewt and not the suffering of a particular individual. The sig- nificant events and scenes of the film are only concerned with emotions en masse, such as the suspense of the crew a~wa.i.ting the arrival of the Russian fleet. It is not merely the theme of Battleship Potemkin which :rr.akes it great,, however, but the style The extraordinary strength .of his films stemmed not only from this dynami<: spirit bout also from a great store of techillcal sldll and artisti'c instinct. He derives much of the vital, impulsive na- ture of. h-is films through a nat- ural sense of depicting motion and n.ood. Probably no one could portray a crov,d as effectively as Eisenstein. In Battl.;ship Potem- kin he balanced the movement of vast throngs through in anum- lber of awe-inspiring scenes. Streaming Cl'O'V\ds of people are contrasted in scenes where a nu:rrlber of throngs move in dif- fering planes and d'irection·s. Eisenstein emphasized images through repetition of a number of still shots chosen for the mood they created when vierwed in se- quance. Perhaps one of Eisen- stein's greatest a'bilities in both the technical and artistic sense Wlas his handling of o:v·erlapping and of montage. He could achieve trennendous insistence upQn a scene by deli-cately over- lapping the pictuTe as seen through a J:!Umber of different camera angles and attitudes. Or, as in the unforgettahle scene on the steps of Odessa, he could produce the same insistent qual- ity by over-lapping the move- ment of the soldiers rushing downwards. The use of over- lapping thus produces an impl·es- sion which is doubly strength- ened thz-ou.g):t the visual percep- tion of t:JVI;o .scenes in one. The greatness of .both Battle- ship Potemkin and the recently shD<wn Cabinet of Dr. Caligari, bv;IQ films generally conceded to rank highest in motion picture history, lies not in a single great development of technique or some original innovation of plot, but in the handling of the film as a ~vhole to make it distinctly a form of art in itself.

Scholarships and living apran·gements at the fra- ternities have been set up and offered to Hungarian students who are able to come here. Two have accepted· S()' far and six or seven more applit:ations are being processed. The HPC ha.s started· a fund for aid to Hungary with a few hun• dred dolLars. T}lis is all good and shows that we are orr the rig'!lt track a,nd are not willing to let do-wn people who are willing to fight and die for the freedo'li:l. we are born 'With. But isn't there more we cari do? In Bud!Lpest, sttid'ents like our- selves are dying, fighting and pourin:g their blood out to galn even a measu:ve of the freedom we· take so much .fo~ granted.

The ad- ministr-ation has showed that it is willing;. the HPC has demon- strated its willingness :;z.lso. We can send food, mo-ney, and cloth~ ing to those still encircled by Russian tanks. We can do all of this and more, if we are willing. Let all t'hose who are willing, J;lleet and plan toward those ends. Let us not disappoint the free world any more than we already have. Will all interested people please meet in the- West Ceillf;lge library on Monday, December 3, at 4:30 p. m.? Representatives of the faculty, the students,. the ad- ministration, :a:PC, Student Coun- cil and all reUgious and social .groups on campus are needed to make this a success. It is imoper- ative that we do so; not only for F.(ungary but also for our own peace of mind, now a,nd in the. future.
