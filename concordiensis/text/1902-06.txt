The ConcordieJl sis VoL. XXV. UNION COLLEGE, JUNE 6, 1902. No. 28. ASSOCIATION. SETTLEMENT WO~K. At the recent conference of theY. M. C. A. presidents held here April 3-6, the Settlen1ent Work of the Young Men's Christian Associa- tions of our colleges and unive,rsi ties was dis- cussed, and the need of, and the benefits derived from such work, were vet-y clearly in1pressed upon all present. The object of this work is principally to give enjoyment to the poor boys in the vicinity, to raise their ideals and to better their lives ; boys who have no advantages in life, and who if :left alone would go downwards instead of u pvvards. In some of the larger universities gi ris and work- ing men are helped. Its second object is to en- noble the lives and characters of tl1e college men who undertake this difficult task and those who are interested enough in it to help in the '\vork in some way. In no case has the under- taking of this work, hard though it is, failed of either object. On the contrary it has!li\' made the Y. M. C. A. a force binding together in a grand enterprise every man in college whose mind tends higher than the mere per- formance of college duties. Frequently it has happened that me~ not actively connected with the Y. M. C. A. have entered body and soul . into the settlement work simply because they then had '\ something to do.\ Philanthropy is the key word to this work. More and more it is being realized that the uni- versity or college stands not only for the life of culture, but for the life of service also, that she gives learning and power to her sons that they may give it to others not so fortunate as they. In giving much, men find they receive . much. SetLetnent work gives undergraduates a practical training for service in the world. The spirit of believing in ''bringing things to pass \ dominates every success in life. Two examples detailed below show the practical work of this nature which is being successfully carried on at Harvard and Penn- sylvania. The difference betw/een this and what is being accomplished by many smaller colleges is one of scale. For the past few years the Y. M. C. A. at Harvard has increased wonderfully in pow·er chiefly by means of its settlement work. Over forty men are at work in the social, educational and religious work of the Riverside Alliance, which began by starting a library for poor boys. The association main- tains a reading-room on a wharf, which is patronized daily by r6o fisherman. Harvard House, the settlement which the association has recently established in East Cambridge, is the centre of club and class work in one of the most neglected districts in Greater Boston. Two undergraduates are residents at the house and through the 16 clubs and classes over 200 children are being taught. Sorne of the wives of the faculy are co-operating in extending this work among the girls and women of the district. Forty men are teaching in the Prospect Union, a university extension for the working men of Cambridgeport. Engaged in all this varied work there are probably over 400 men. The University Settlement Work at Pennsyl- vania is hardly five years old. Three years. ago a regular club for. boys was organized, open every night from seven to nine. The boys amuse themselves with books and by playing garnes. From three to six students are present each evening and an effort is made to come into as close personal contact with the boys as possible. Saturday evening an entertainment is given consisting ot stereoptican lectures, musicles, etc. This club has the cordial support of the provost and the faculty. One of the most suc- cessful features of the work has been the \ Boy's Camp\ held each summer in charge of christian athletes from the university. At a meeting of the Union College Y. M. C. A. a short time ago, it was unanimously voted to undertake some form of settlement work.

THE C'ONC·ORDIENSIS. Consequently a Boys' Brigade was started for the boys of Park Place and Nott street. Drill was thought to be the best thing to attract the boys at this time of the year. In the aututnn the brigade will be turned into a boy's club where the boys may gather evenings to read and play games. There have been three drill with an average attendance of forty-fiv~ boys and six students. Despite the s,mall number of students present the boys have kept order and behaved well. The gymnasium exercises and a few simple movements have been taught them. Now this work cannot be carried on without proper support. Sorne protninent men and women of the city are interested in this work and a few young rnen fron'l the town are doing active work. It is a big wo1·k, but if tnany take hold each one will have but a very little to do. This work has not failed of success in any other college. Why then should it fail here? Each man in college should do his part in giving this new to us, but noble undertaking, a good start this spring. You have a chance to do. \ Doing becomes Habit Habit becomes Character Character lasts Forever.\ THE ENGINEERS' TRIP. On May zo, fourteen students in the engineer- ing course of the three upper classes left for an inspection tour of the great engineering works of New York. The greatest feats of the mechanical and electrical genius of the day were shown and carefully explained. Prof. 0. H. Landreth and Instructor Fred- erick Edwards, who conducted the party, ex- pressed themselves as being highly pleased with the trip and stated that it was of such profit to all that doubtless it would be made an annual affair. Prof. Landreth wishes to acknowledge especially the courtesy and aid of S. L. F. Deyo, '7o, of the Subw2y Construction Co. and of G. H. Barby, '97, superintendent of the cable stretching operations on the East River Bridge. The itinerary was as follows: The first morning was spent in viewing the subway, one of the greatest excavations of the· world. The work in all its phases, was care- fully inspected. Several portions of the tunnel had been com,p1eted and these were made special points of critical study. The arched dome, tl~e walls, the double tracks and the plan . of heatiNg and lighting were examined and as the pro£essors pointed out interesting features of the work, note books were brought into . service. The tourists then proceeded to the East River bridge. The length of this great structure was found to be horizonally 2,8oo feet, the three spans measuring respectively 6oo, 1 ,6oo and 6oo feet. The four cables which sustain the weight of the bridge are made of 3 7 strands, each strand consisting of 208 wires. The next point of interest was the navy yard at Brooklyn, where the students boarded the battleship '' Massachusetts.\ The dry docks also were visited and the method of ship-build- ing lightly ex:amintd into. At the power plant of the Metropolitan Street railway, the party was courteously received and the old and new methods of furnishing means of conveyance were technically pointed out. On Friday afternoon the men were taken to Brooklyn, where a sewage settlement plant was visited. COMMENCEMENT WEEK. The Cotnmencement exercises will be held on the second Wednesday in June. The alumni and friends of Union are cordially invited to be present. The classes of '42, '52, '62, '72, '77, '82, '87, '92, '97, and '99 will hold their reunions on Tues- day, Alumni Day.

8 THE CONCORDIENSIS. PLANS FOR FALL WOI{K IN THE .MUSICAL ASS·OCIA TlO,N. It is the desire of those in charge of the Glee Club to institute a new :system fot· the cotning year. In preceding years it b.as been the custom for men to try for the clubs at the beginning of the year and from the number trying the leader would: within a few weeks pick out six.teen men to cConstitute the club for the entire year. The new manner of selecting will be to form a chorus of as many voices on a part as are advantage()us, and to carry the chorus until the New Y C)rk trip. A fall trip will be arranged, if possible into the west central portion of the state, a concert will be given here in December, and a spring trip will be taken down the ,Hudson, ending as in previous years in New York city. The remaining rehear.sals of the week are at 7 P. M Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday. It is urged upon every member of the Glee Club to make it a personal ca.re to be prompt and and regular at these the most important re- hearsals of the term. 'f'.he program for the June concert this year is short, will last but little over an hour in order that th<>se who wish to attend the other functions of the evening may have abundant opportunity to do so after the concert and thus tnay have no excuse for staying away from one of the representative college events of commencement week. UNION WINS !HE QUBBEQ. The third game of the season between Union and R. P. I. was won by the fonner to the tune of 15 to 9 at Ridgefield,. in Albany, on Saturday, May 31st. N\.

TRE CONCORDIENSIS. 9 :UNION, 12; MIDDLEBURY, 3. Union won fr\Qm Middlebury on the campus l.ast Satut·day by a score of 12 to 3· Though the score would indicate a rather one-sided con- test, it was not so by any means and was perhaps the n1ost interesting garne played on the campus this season. The Vermont rnen sitnply could not hit when hits meant runs. Twice Grout struck out the third man when the bases were full. On the other hand the wearers of the Garnet hit the ball hard and often. Griswold and Odwell did 1 the best batting £or Union. Odwell's home run was probably the best and cleanest hit that has been made on the catnpus this year. Union's fielding was very good considering the condition of ground. Heath probably had the worst difficulties to contend with as the mound which is bad enough ordinarily is twice as bad on a wet day. Bradley made a pretty catch in his part of the field. Grout exchanged with Devoe and pitched the entire gatne. Devoe covered third in fine style and stopped everything that came his way. The single error that he made· was on a bad throw to first. Drake's one-handed catch of a. fly was the fielding feature of the game. Score: UNION. A. B.

David Jayne Hill, the First Assistant Secretary of State, has been chosen to deliver the chancellor's addt·ess to this year's graduating class. Mr. Hill is a graduate of Bucknell University, pursued studies at Berlin and Paris, and became V\ 7 hile still a very young man, president of Bucknell. He afterwards ac~ cepted the presidency of the University of Rochester, and after eight years of successful ad- ministration resigned that position and went abroad. He spent some years in the study of Public Law. As an author his writings include Biography, Philosophy, Social Science and International Law, and his ability and learning have been de- voted to the national service for the last four years in the Departtnent of State. As is well known, the office of the First Assistant in the State Department is one of the tnost responsible in the Government, and has demanded a special ability in view of the political situation of these last four years. President Raymond and our college, which he represents, are to be congratulated upon the choice and acceptance of such a man for this position. The commencement exercises of the Uni- versity of Pennsylvania will begin on June 15, one week earlier than usual. In the future all college debators at Yale must take a regular course in debating, and be recommended by the instructor.

The policy of the past year of nursing the interest taken in this paper at the schools in Albany will be :firtnly adhered to and they will welcome that day when this interest has grown strong enough to warrant the Board in changing the title to read: The Concordiensis. A Literary and News Weekly Published by The Students of Union University. In order that it may be true to its title the aid of every student is invoked for maintenance of this student publication upon a standard of honor and pride to the university. There is always a place upon the Board open to faithfulness and ability. The Passing of the Seat of Stone. It is evidently tl1e intention of the powers that be that the ''grand old seat of stone '' shall discontinue in that capicity, at least that part of the af()resaid seat in front of North College. Students rooming else- where. than in North College will not miss it nor do they care, they tnay even condemn the writer for mentioning such a seemingly trivial affair . But, nevertheless, the writer is voicing the senti- ments of students rooming in North College when he says that he has his doubts whether it was the The Policy of the Board. intention of the treasurer of the college to have the The new Board in taking up railings of the Terrace removed jast in front of their new positions and duties North College, the very place where the seat was wh~h to express their apprecia- tion of the training and example given them by the retiring Board and their determination to make it show in the character of the publication while it is in their charge. The aim will be to put forth a Weekly of interest and value to the men of all courses ,in the college and of each department of the university. Under- graduate and alumni news will coRtinue to receive strict attention and a special effort will be made to obtain original literary contributions and occasional papers upon technical subjects. It is most used. Not only were the railings removed but the iron supports were broken ,off. The rail- ing beyond North College even to the gate at the end of the Terrace, was left intact, although in ~ more delapidated condition than that directly in front of the building. So the situation at present is that the Terrace in front of Nortb. College can- not be used as a seat, being minus a back. When the alun1ni return they too will be denied thepleasure of sitting on the \jolly old seat of stone,\ unless they choose a part in front of South College. The idea of removing that part of the railings that

THE CONCORDIENSIS. 11 needed repairing is not objected to, where that part was :not often used, but to take away entirely the back to the \grand old seat of stone'' \where the old a~umni sat in balmy nights of yore'' is a measure that cannot be allowed to go uncon- demned. MUSICALE IN SILLIMAN HALL. A musicale was given in Silliman Hall on Friday evening, May 23, from 8 =15 to 9 :30 under Mrs. Raymond's supervision. The con- cert was given by talent from New York city, , Schenectady and the college Glee Club. BOOK ~EVIEW. [Practical Talks by an Astronomer. By Harold Jacoby, Ad- jun.ct Pr.,fessm· of Astronomy in Columbia University. Illus- trated. PublislLed by Charles Scribner's Sons, 1902.] In this volume is found a. collection of essays treating in a. popular manner the more interest- ing sides of the subject of Astronomy. The author adn:1its in the preface that the layman is not interested in all the details of his science, and that interest really centres in out of the way subjects, and in the incidentals, rather than the substance. He says that the volume was not intended as a systematic treatise on Astronomy. '' The Science of Astronomy\ he says, '' con- tains subjects that admit of detached treatment; and as ma11y of these are precisely the ones of greatest general interest, it has seemed well to select se-veral, and describe them in laPguage free from, technicalities. It is hoped that the book will thus prove useful to persons who do not wish.. to give the time required for a study of Astr()norny as a whole, but who may take pleasure in devoting a half-hour now and then to a detached essay on some spe~ial topic.\ The author has succeeded admirably in treating the subject as he states his ain1 to have been. The book is very readable even to one whose knowledge of astronomy is nil. The subjects of the diffe1·ent chapters are of general interest and these chapters have appeared in magazines previous to their publication in book form. To show the range of subjects the following is a list of the chapter headings: Navigation at Sea; The Pleiades; The Pole-star; Nebulae; Temporary Stars ; Galileo ; The Planet of 1898; How to make a Sun-dial; Photography in Astronomy : Time Standards of the World ; Motions of the Earth's Pole; Saturn's Rings; The Heliometer; Occultations; Mounting of great Telescopes; The Astronomer's Pole; The- Moon Hoax ; and The Sun's Destination. The occasion was a new one on the hill and thoroughly enjoyed by all present and it is under- stood that it is Mrs. Raymond's iRtention to make it an annual affair. The audience was a large one and included many representatives of Schenectady society, the members of the faculty, their wives and the upperclassmen. The selections bv Mrs. Chambers were \ particularly fine and she was repeatedly encored. Miss Williams' rendering of Von Heitzsch'~ Romance was exquisite. Chopin's Polonaise was splendidly executed by Mrs. Seward, of New \\-rork city, wife of the Hon. Geo. F. Seward. Mr. J anzer on the cello, accotnpanied by Miss Young, was especially enjoyed·. The program opened and closed with good selections by the Glee Club. The program was as follows: College Glee Club. Romanze, Von Heltzsch, Miss Williams. (a) Violets, Wright; (b) Under the Juniper, Hollaender ; (c) Because I Love You, Dear, Hawley, Mrs. Chambers. Polonaise, Chopz'n, Mrs. Seward. (a) Hindoo Song, Bemberg; (b) Open Thy Blue Eyes, Massenet; (c) Slumber Boat, Gaynor, Mrs. Chambers. (a) Dedication, Hopper; (b) Romanze, Von Goens, Mr. J anzer. Glee Club. UNION, 8 ; G. E., 2. The game played on the campus on Memorial Day between the 'Varsity team and that of the Testing Department of the General Electric Co. resulted in a decided victory for Union by the above score. The gan1e was prettily played throughout, the field as well as the battery work being excellent. Captain Grout pitched, again exchanging with Devoe.

14: THE CONCORDrENSIS. THE ALUMNI COLUMN. Interesting News About Union Graduates. [Every alumn.us and undergraduate of Uuion is in- vited to send to the Alumnz Editor items of interest for insertionin this department. News o..f a personal nature, about any alumnus, will be gladly received atzd printed.] '53.-· President William C. Whitford, of Milton· College, died at Milton, Wis., on· Wednesday, May 21. He was .graduated from Union College in 1853, and three years after-. wards from Union Theological Seminary of New York. For several years he held the office of state superintendent of public instruction in Wisconsin. '56.-Hon. J. Sterling Morton, former secre- tary of agriculture, died in April 29 at Chicago. J':llius Sterling Morton was well-known in Washington where for four years he was secre- tary of agriculture in President Cleveland's second adn1inistration. He was a man of stead- fast convictions, unswerving honesty and un- doubted ability. By nature a controversialist, Mr. Morton came to the cabinet with many fixed ideas about the government service. He was a practical farmer and ran his department along practical lines. He regarded the distribu- tion of seeds as paternalistic, and on that subject found himself in opposition to Congress. The ex-secretary was the author of Arbor Day, April 22, which began to be observed generally during his incumbency as head of the department of agriculture and is now generally . ohseJYed in all the states. His· ·constant tnotto was to H plant trees,\ having it stamped in large letters under the picture of a tree on his itationery. He was an inveterate letter writer. H~e found keen enjoyment. in answering the con:lrnunications frotn farn1ers, and it was no unus.ual occurrence for him to call new~paper men1 into his office to read the answers he was writing to farmers, often giving out portions of · theta for publication. Ii:e was of Scotch-English descent and was born ~in Jefferson county, New York, his·patents m<>ving- to Michigan when he was very young. He entered the University of Michigan but finis:f.Jed :at Union. He wa:, a member· of the Chi J>si fraternity. N1'. Morton was connected editorially, for a time with the Detroit Free Press .and the Chicago Times, and then located at Bellevue, Neb,.,. in November, 1854, where in April folle-wing he issued the first number of the Ne1>raska City News. He was elected to the terri~torial legislature the same year and re- elected in 1857. He was appointed secretary of tlie territory in 1858 to £11 the vacancy caused by the death of Thomas B. Cuming and served unti1l May 18, 1861, part of the time as acting governor. He was elected to Congress in 186o, but \?las unseated as the result of a contest. He was, four titnes nominated by his party as gove:rnor of Nebra&ka, but failed to be elected. ~.g.-Announcement is made of the marriage on Nay thirty-first at Plainfield, N. J., of Harrison K.

The ConCordicll sis YoL. XXV. UNION COLLEGE, JUNE 24, 1902. No. 29. \fHE BACCALAUREATE SERMON. 'l'h·e first exercises of the one huu.dred and fifth Co.mmence.ment were held in the State Street M. E. church on Sunday evening, June 8. After the reading of the scripture lesson by the Rev. Dr. Lawrence, '69, and prayer by Re·v. F. W. Adams, Dr. Raymond delivered a most powerful and rnasterly sennon on the te~t .: \Because thou hast been faithful in a few things, I will make thee- ruler over many things.\ Matt. XXV., zr. After the sennon, the scene beca1ne one of increased solemnity as the forty seniors in black rohes arose with bared heads to listen to the last address of counsel and direction that the presi- dent will ever make to the class. Dr. Raymond said: ''\Young Gentlemen of the Graduating Ciass- ~'For you college days now belong to the past. You can live them over again only in memory. This you will do often and always with delight. They have not been free from care. At times, I d()-ubt not, you have thought your lot hard, and yet, as they recede, you .are certain to forget the hardships and rem.ember the pleasures. Seen in the distance they V\ 7 ill be days of freedorn, of . gl-orious fellowship and joyous achievetnent, l1eroic days, more aud more heroic as the years carry them further away\. The glamour of the past will be over them, and you will not resist the spell. Even no\'r you look back with a sigh that they are over, but the future invites ; y()u, and your thoughts are more of what is to be than of what has been. What I have said in g--eneral this evening, I have meant for you in .particular. Before you are all the possibilities ()f life, as represented by increasing dominion. You may become rulers over many things. I .have tried to show you what this means, and need not draw the picture again, but one thing I have not said which is perhaps the first sug- gestion of the text that I have chosen in the hope that it may be an inspiration and help in days to come. The way that leads upward to increasing power and influence, the ·condition of every real advantage in life, is faithfulness. 'Because thou hast been faithful in a few things I will make thee ruler over many things.' You can have no surer guide than this to the realiza- tion of your dreams of glory. The larger dnminion to which you aspire waits upon the exercise of the power that you have now. Despising the day of small things is the open secret of all life's failure. Every possession, or in the language of the parable, every talent; is a tt:ust, some thing to be used not ignored nor hidden. To make the most of it is to ensure a larger con1mission. 'Well done' is always the first greeting to him who is to be given more power, a higher place of authority. \ Surely I need not attempt any specific application. 1\'hough you are college graduates, you will begin the future in some humble place, with seemingly small opportunities ; but may I not add, that because you are college graduates you will begin with a high sense of responsibility and with a habit of faithfulness, for this has been the dominant purpose of the instruction and discipline of these four years. More im· portant than the knowledge which you have gained, important as that is, ·is the sense of obligation and of the need ot thorought~ess, which fron1 first to last your professors have sought to cultivate. Moreover, you have not reached this first culmination of your hopes without attaining some measure of self-mastery. These are the requirements which give you an advantage as college tnen, start where you will. It is reasonable therefore, for us all, parents, teachers, friends, to expect that you will fill a larger place in the world than is given to those less favored at life's outset. We expect you to be leaders in whatever field of effort you enter ; not only leaders of thought, leaders in enter- prise, but leaders of men ; for this is the power

6 THE CONCORDIENSIS. that carries with it the highest dignity. I have not spoken of this before, because I wisl1ed to leave it especially foryou. The sovereignty of personal i11fluence may well represent your supreme atnbition. No ruler is so great as he who changes, not tbe outward circumstances,, , but the lives of others, dit·ecting their thoughts, insp,iring their purposes, leading them into a ! larger world. Those are the true kings arnong men, whose dominion rests not upon force but . ORATO~ICAL CONTESTS. The annual oratorical contest and extempora- neous debate was held in the State Street Methodist ·church on Monday evening, June 9, before a good-sized audience. The judges :for the oratoricals were Prof. A. H. Pepper, '87, the Rev. F. W. Adams, and Edward Hayward, '78, and for the deba~e, Rev. C. E. Fay, '82, F. D. Van Wagnen, '82, and W. P. Landon, '86 . upon servtce. \In every sphere of influence may yon in- carnate the spirit and 111eet the approval of Hitn who said, 'Because thous hast been faithful in a few- things I will make thee ruler over tnany things.'\ PICT·U:RESQUE IVY EXERCISES. The class of 1902 held the annt1allvy Exercises in Jackson's Garden Monday afternoon, June 9· Long before the hour appointed throngs of people began to asset'llble in the glade around the historic N ott Elm, and by three o'clocl{ the east side of the glade was filled as well as the row of seats around it. At three o'clock the seniors led by President · Yat6s and Grand Marsha1l Griffith m«rched down the shaded path singing the class song. As they eatered they n1arched to the elm and seated themselves on the ground under its boughs. The class song was again sung and the class yell was given. The pipe oration was then given by Donald C. Hawkes of Elmira. After music by the orchestra, Addison H. Hinman of Albany, read the class poem. The class then left the garden and proceeded to Nott Memorial Hall, where the ivy was planted on the southwest side of the building. After it was planted, The<;>dore DeL. Coffin of Glens Falls, delivered the ivy oration. Colgate won the meet held by the N. Y. S. I. C. A. A., at Rochester on May 31, by the score of 4573 to Han1ilton's 39 1-6 and Roch- ester 32 I -6. The speeches in general were wt·itten and delivered wen, the prizes being finally awarded as follows: Sophomore :first prize, $15, to J. L. Don- hauser; second prize, $ro, to E. V. Mulleneaux. Junior first prize, $25,, to R. C. Donnan; second prize, $r5, to T. G.

The hall was decorated in garnet and white and the tables were decorated with lavish boquets of syringas, peonies and wild flowers. The entrance of the aged a11d honored alun1ni was the occasion for an outburst of loud and vigorous applause on the part of the younger men. Then following, in high glee, the songs of Old Union, sung loud and clear, while the orchestral music accompanied. The arrival of the board of trustees was greeted by enthusiastic cheers fnom the assemblage. As soon as the classes were arranged the dinner was served, and it was as usual a most bountiful and excellent i 4 epast. After the alumni had done ample justice to the dinner, President McElroy expressed general thanks to the ladies who had served the dinner, and introduced President Raymond. tl tl p 0 d h fi y I f: 1 0 g . 1 l r l t t 1 c

THID CONCORDIENSIS. Dr. Raymond welcotned the a.lurnni and: told the1n of the good fortune of the college during the past year. He s<:Jid in part: \We welcome you especially because your presence means your affectionate interest in the old college, and the glory of the college is th:e devotion of her sons. And now that you are here and memories are renewed by tl1ese familiar scenes, we hope that you are :saying to yourselves: 'How .tnuch we ovve to this place. How different life would have been but for tl1e faiths and inspirations which carne to us het:e.' '' The President paid tribute to the faithfulness of the late treasurer Harroun and of the gratitude and loya~ty displayed by Mr. Bailey in taking up the work of this office -while so burdened with the t~esponsibilities of his far_ reaching private interests. ''The long strife over the Armstrong estate has at last been ended on terms ve1·y favorable to the college, whose principle, as seen by the treasurer's report, has been incteased b:y $6o,ooo : through it. The necessary fund fot· the t·enova- tion of South college has been compFeted by a check from the General Electric Co. for $z ,5oo. By fall a dormitory with complete n1cdern con- veniences, tho' still retaining all the ,extern a charm of the old gray walls, will be ready for occupancy. This investment will probably net the college ten per cent.-what tnore pt·actical way of helping the college still further, than thro' the r~novation of North college ? \Thro' the bene£cence of Mr. Carnegie, Nott Memorial Hall is to be completed as a library. The plans contemplate broad stone steps, repainting, the replacement of the wooden drum of the dome by ornarn.enta} copper, and of the ft·agile stained glass by plate glass. \Within upon the ground floor, there are to be placed iron book racks running radially from the wall half way to each pillar. The centra floor wi] be filled with reading desks and tables which can be removed upon the occasion Of dances and banquets such as the present. \The first gallery will se1~ve as a genera stack room. '' At the level of the second gallery a permanent floor will be thrown across with an opening twenty feet in diameter in the centre through which we may still see the stars in the dome. . This floor is to be supported by arches of steel ctuving from the colutnns of the first gallery to the central opening--giving a dome- like effect to the whole low,er part of the building. '' The second floor will be used as a museum of natural history~ where the various collections, now scattered, may be brought together. Al- together we shall have a building as attractive as useful. This comes as the completion of Dr. Potter's work for Union, built by hitn as president it is to be finished as a result of his own appeal to Mr. Carnegie, made just before his death. As though to round out the memorial significance of the ha[, I have recently received word from Mrs. Potter that her husband had willed his library to the college.\ Dr. Rayn1ond closed with a beautiful tribute to the tnen1ories of Daniel Butterfield, Dr. Perkins and Dr. White horne and an appropriate reference to Dr. Wells and his retirement. THE TREASU:QER'S REPO~T. Treasurer Bailey rnade a report, in which he said that the college was on a finn financial basis and that it would stay there. He dis- tributed his printed report, giving a detailed account of the financial condition of tbe college. According to the report he received when he came into l1is office $4o6,992-40. Some of the real estate he converted into available cash and at present the assets of the college amount to $54o,o28.82, exclusive of the grounds and stand- ing, which the treasurer says are priceless. He had the heartiest words of commendation for Assistant Treasurer Pond who has had charge of finances here for the past few months. The report says in conclusion: \For the next fiscal year the receipts from incon1es only will not be equal to the expenses by about $5 ,ooo. That deficiency, however, as you know, has been subscribed by the trustees. ~he sale of our Schenectady real estate should

s TRE CONCORDIENSIS. increase our incotne by $3,500, so 1903 and 1904 should show no depreciation in assets. We have one large expenditure threatening and that is the repavement of N ott street. It vvill cost us $7,ooo The fund for improving South College dor- mitory is completed. It amounts to $I I ,398. This improvement will increase the incotne next year by $r ,ooo net. We are indebted to the G:eneral Electric company for $z,soo, which amount completed the fund, and to our alumni and local friends for the balance. J. N. Van- derveer, '99 and your president have been instru- mental in raising the fund. That great giver, Andrew Carnegie, has donated $4o,ooo to corn- plete and adapt the N ott Memorial building. This gift was made at the solicitation of Dr. Eliphalet Nott Potter, assisted by Mr. George F. Seward of the class of '6o. The permanent endow.rnent of the college ·has never been impaired. For five years past cur- rent expenses have been m.et as due. This statement shows that our college is on a sonud financial basis and is entitled to support. Every future gift, unless otherwise conditioned, will be added to the pern1anent endowment and thus the regular inco1ne of the college will be steadily increased. It costs the college for every student annually $299·90, while the college t·eceives from the student an average of $38.8o, making the actual cost per student per year $261.90. During the past year we have assisted students to the amount of $r r ,220-nearly t'\,vice as much as the entire receipts from students. QETI~EMENT OF DQ. WELLS. Of all the events of Comtnencement week, the one possessing the greatest amount of general interest was the acceptance by the board of trustees Tuesday morning, June ro, ·of the resignation of Dr. William Wells, professor of modern language~. He was retired by the board as professor, etneritus, and was granted a salary and home for life. Dr. Wells has been a professor at Union College for almost forty years and is now with the exception of Dr. Wendell Latneroux, librarian emeritus,_ tb,e only living n1e1nber of the faculty who &erved under Dr. N ott. The action was taken by the trustees in view of his long years of service and devotion for the college, and it is heartily en- dorsed by every son of Union,. whether graduate or undergraduate. \Uncle Billy,\ as he is lovingly known to all Union men has a warm place in every Union man's heart, and his unfailing popularity with each succeeding class is the best attestation of his worth and sterling character. For many years his classes had a yell made especially f()r ' Uncle Billy, which was only given in his hon<>r. The yell was '' Berumht Billee, Berumht, Billee, Herr Doktor Wells.'' Dr. Raymond announced the retirement ()f Dr. Wells to the alumni at the dinner and ex- pressed the love that Dr. Wells has inspired in all his associates, either as fellow members ()f the faculty or as students. Prof. Albert H. Pepper, '87, spoke next and said that it was but a few days ago that the news of the proposed resignation of Dr. Wells had been given ou!, but in that time such of the alumni as could be readily reached, were apprised ot the fact and it was decided that the presentation of a token of respect to Dr. Wells would be appropriate. Prof. Pepper said that he considered himself especially fitted to present this tok~n as he was one of Dr. Wells'\ old boys\ aud he had been closely associated with him on the college faculty in the modern language department f<>r a decade. Prof. Pepper then presented Dr. Wells with a sterling silver loving cup and tray, the former bearing the inscription, ''To Dr William Wells of Union College, Commence .. ment 1902. From some of the Old Boys .. ,, The presentation was greeted with a thunderous burst of applause and class vied with class in yells and cheers. As soon as the assetnblage had quieted, Dr. Wells arose to express his thanks. So moved was he by the gift that for a ti rne he could not speak and after simply saying, \I can not talk,\ stood with bowed head until he could control his emotions. When he did so, he ..

THE CONCORDIENSIS. 9 spoke lovingly of the old !college, of the faculty and trustees, and especially of men who have gone out from the college and who return to meet their Alma Mater year by year. He told how deeply he· appreciated the thoughtfulness and love of his ''old boys\ as he called thetn when they came to pay hitn their respects at each Con1mencement and especially at this last one, when he has been made nearer and dearer to all by the death of two other of Union's most revered pt·ofessors, Dr. Perkins and Dr. White- horne. Dr. Wells closed his talk by invoking the divine blessing on the college and on all connected with it. The whole scene was ·mingled with pathos and throughout his talk Dr. Wells could with difficulty ·control his emotions, while there were tears in the eyes of many of his auditors. THE ALUMNI MEETING AND ELECTION OF TRUSTEES. The meeting of the alumni on Tuesday morn- ing, June 1:0, was called to order by the presi- dent, William. H. McElroy, of New . York. The Rev. E. C. Lawrence offered a fervent prayer for blessing on the college and alumni. Prof. S. G. Ashmore reported for the com- tnittee on necrology and said that pamphlets had been distributed among the alumni. General Parker announced: the following nominations for the oom in g. year, and the ticket was e~·ected without opposition : President, WiUiarn H. McElroy, New York city; vice- president, Clarence E. Akin, Troy; secretary, William T. Clute, Schenectady; treasurer, Allen T. Jackson, ot Schenectady; executive committee of five members; J. Newton Fiero, Jatnes Heatley, the Rev. E. C. Lawrence and Frank Coope·r. Bulletin committee of three members, E. C. Hoyt, A. L. Bennett, Andrew McFarlane. One member of athletic board for three years, R. J. Landon. SIGMA XI ELECTIONS. At the .meeting of the Sigma Xi society held Tuesday, June 10, the following officers were chosen: President, Prof. D. H. Landreth; vice-president, Dr. William Wells; treasurer, Dr. W. T. Wright; recording secretary, Dr. F. B. WHliatns. Frotn tl1e senior ciass, Everett J. Best of Elk Creek; H. Burdett Cleveland of Amsterdam ; Howard E. Sands of Jordan and David J. Shaw of Au burn, were elected to membership, also from tl1e faculty, Dr. B. S. Curtiss, B. Edwards, and E. B. Wheeler. \ BASEBALL CAPTAIN. On. Saturday, May 3x, Guy B. Griswold, 1903 of Whitehall, was elected baseball captain for the cotning year. The choice is very fortu- nate and natural as \Gris\ has shown himself, during three years past, to be one of the best players upon our team-cool, steady and quick, he is always \in the game.\ Popular in class and college and all-around athlete that he is, he should receive the enthus.i,astic support and con- fidence of all. A letter was read from an unknown alumnus, who suggested that each alumnus pledge himself to send one man to Union each year for the next five, or to forfeit $1 ,ooo. He also stated that as Troy and Albany are now brought nearer to this city by the electric railway he thought that more men from these cities should attend Union. To give the idea impetus, he agreed to pay the expenses of a young man from Troy for four years, such a student to be .selected by the superintendent of schools of Tt·oy. The name of the writer of this letter was vvithheld. At noon the balloting for trustees took place and the Rev. Philip H. Cole of Syracuse, was elected to succeed himself and Prof. Franklin H. Giddings, '77, of Colun1bia University, was elected to fill the vacancy made by the death of Gen. Daniel Butterfield, '49· Lehigh defeated Lafayette in a track meet on Ma.y 31 by the score of 69 to 40. The features of the meet were the breaking of the Lehigh pole vault and broad jutnp records.

In many ways the week has been notable. The number of alumtli registered was exceptional, the class reunions very successful, :the president's ad- dress and treasurer's report more full of interest and promise than usual. The past year has seen many changes for the better, notably in the 11torale of student life; .the future is bright with new possibilities, almost realities of increasing power for good. In treating of these matters nothing has been intentionally slighted tho' in some instances we have been forced to give mere outlines whete we would have been glad in a larger issue to publish full details. THE GA THE~ING OF THE CLANS •. '32-Though unrepresented in body it was in spirit as was well shown by a long letter written in his own hand and sent to his society by John L. Kanouse of Boonton, N.

Of the nine, one is a trustee, the Hon. Silas B. Brownell. '58-0ne of the alumni who returned from the Pacific coast to do honor to Union was Rev. John K. McLean. The class also had a num- ber of enthusiastic members from nearer by, at its table. '6o-All welcomed the wit and poet of 186o, Wm. H. McElroy, LL. D., of New York. '62-Prof. S. B.

The occasi()-n was truly a tnost pleasant one. Before leaving it was unanimously agreed to hold a reunion every year and to make strenuous effort t<:> 1lave a large delegation always present. Many other Union sons were back, :;;ollle un- kno~n to the observer, others belonging to the intermediate classes. We trust that an had a good time, that peace remains with tbem, and that we may often have the pleasure of greeting ·them in the future. The decennial and semi-decennial r.eunions seemed an especially strong attraction thjs year. 1902 departs with good omen. Nay this always continue.

12 TRE CONOORDIENSIS. THE MUSICAL CLUBS' ·CONCEQT. A large audience of Schenectadians, as well as out of town commencen1ent visitors, gave a warm and appreciative reception to the musical clubs on Tuesday evening, June roth, at the Van Curler, on the occasion of their annual spring concert. l'he affair was very successful from both artistic and financial standpoints. The well-handled chorus was in its best voice., while the instrun1entali~ts more than sustained their good reputation. The temper of the assemblage was expressed in abundant applause, that brought the men to the front repeatedly. With one exception, encores were given to every number. The audience was composed mainly of society people, eager to do homage to Union's mus.ical contingent. Among the nutnbers that met with especial favor were a solo, \The Cellarers' Toast,\ from De Koven's ''Maid Marian,\ rendered 'vith delightful purity and richness of tone by A. H. Hinman ; an ovetture by the Mandolin c1 ub, and a characteristic song, entitled, \Lazy Bill,\ by Harry L. Crain, accotnpanied by the man- dolin, glee and guitar clubs. The latter selec- tion found a fitting climax to the evening's entertainment. The entire affair reflects great credit upon president G. B. Griswold, manager A. S. Peck, leader S. B. Howe, jr., and the clubs. GRADUATION EXE:QCISES. The graduation exercises of the class of 1902 were held at the State Street M. E. church Wednesday morning, June I 1. The church was well filled with friends of · the college and a large nutnber of the friends and relatives of the seniors. After music by an orchestra, the first oration was delivered by William H. Adams of · Charleston, S. C. His subject was \ Progress Through Personality.\ The next oration was by Everett J. Best of . Elk Creek, who wrote on '' Biology and Ethics.,., He was excused ftotn delivering it. William H. Gillespie of Brighton, S. I., next delivered an oration on \ Sensationalis·m. '' He was followed by Frazer Metzger of Freehold, who spoke of ,, 'The Ethics of the Twentietb Century.'' After a selection by the orchestra J. Milt<>n Russum delivered an oration entitled \A Lesson in Honor.\ The next speaker on the progratn me Howard E. Sands of Jordan, was excused from de- livering his oration on '' The Power of tl1.e Ideal.\ The final speech or valedictory was delivered by Frank T. Ostrander of Albany. The subject of his oration was \Our Written Constitution.\ The following engineering theses were excused: \ The Design of an Intercepting Sewer and Sewage Disposal Plant for Amsterdam, N. Y.\ H. · Burdett Cleveland, Atnsterdam; \The Design of an Intercepting Sewer and Sewage Dispostal Plant for Schenectady, N.Y.,\ George I. Oakley, East Williston ; \ The Design of :a Water Power PlantatAqueduct, N.Y.,\ James H. Small, Jr., Charleston, S. C. THE CHANCELLOQ'S ADDRESS. The address of the honorary chancellor, de· livered by the Hon. David J. Hill, the assistant secretary of state of the United States, was on \The Public Influence of Scholarship.\ Re- ferring to the activities of the nineteenth century, · which now in the twentieth are blooming into conscious national power and industrial suprem.- acy, he pointed out that we are now reaping what has been sown in the quiet seed-time periods of our history and that the new .era upon which we are now entering as a nation is only the legitimate fruitage of the earlier planting. After tracing the debt which the public owes to the universities and colleges of Europe and America, Mr. Hill concluded: ~' The best service the college can render to our country is to continue qeepening the in- tensity of An1erican efficiency, implanting in young men a sincere love of truth and knowledge, I i·

THE CONCORDIENSIS. 18 insptring them with an ardent patdotistn, and thus fill the land with no b~e, intelligent and faithful men, standing everywhere for high ideals and the, helpful critieisru of public policy, and ready when occasion 1nay arise to ~erve their day and generation vv:i th the best talent at their command.\ Speaking of the preparaHon of young men for the the public service, Mr. Hill said ''And let them by no means despise the service of the state, or look with disfavor upon public life as inferior dignity to the :great vocations of art, science, literature, and retigion. Ifever Ameri- can manhood bore a noble fruit, it was in the serene soul of \tVilliam McKinley. Once in ·his presence, a visitor sneeringly spoke of a certain n1an as ' a mere poli6cia.R.' The president's cheek flushed for a mon~ent as Sir Galahad's . tnight have critnsoned at an insult to knightly honor ; then he quietly •·emarked. ' I trust he has done nothing to ,traduce so honorable a calling.' \Politician he undoubtedlv was, the most \' consummate of his gene1'ation, the most ac- complished, perhaps, of the tnodern times; but he knew how to con'lbine with political service a conception of personal integrity and a fervor of patriotric devotion that lifted that vocation to the heights of a pure a11d noble statesmanship.\ In closing he exhorted :young men not to for- get that American scholarship has a pride in never having created an i utellectual aristocracy to sit apart from the tasks of life, but has found its highest reward in the plain duties of the citizen and the patriot; transmitting with a generous hand to· all classes of society the l{nowledge which it has received in trust for the universal benefit of man. nEGULAR AND HONO~AnY DEGREES The following regular and honorary degrees were conferred by the trustees at the close of the chancellor's address: Bachelors of Art-William Hooper Adams, Everett J.

THE SENIOQ BALL. This crowning event of the Comtnencement season was a truly brilliant and unusually successful function. It was, altogether, a most fitting clitnax to \ Old Union's'' one hundred and fifth com- tnencement. The music, the refreshments, the decorations, and all details had been placed in the hands of most competent persons, with most gratifying results. Nothing which could tend to the comfort and enjoytnent of the guests had been left undone. The decorative scheme, carried out with a wealth of garnet and white ribbons and bunting, was very effective. The scene on the floor when the pleasures of the evening were at their height was a kaleido- scope of beautiful gowns, fair and vivacious won1en, forming a most pretty sight. Dancing began at 10:30 o'clock, and continued, with an intermission of half an hour at 1 o'clocl<, until the streaks of gray dawn flitted across the eastern horizon and the senior ball of the glorious class of I 902 was over-but not to be forgotten. The dance orders, tastful conceptions in suede, were especially commented upon, as was also the dainty and abundant collation. The success was due to the indefatigable efforts of the chair- tnan, D. C. Hawkes and the committee, F. J. Ostrander, Gilbert S. Woolworth, and Willard S. Yates, to whom great credit· is due. ! I . ,·,, I >'.

The class reunions, which seemed especially to attract the \grads\ this year, will he found n1entioned elsewhere. We regret that lack of space prevents the publi- cation of the list. FACULTY CHANGES. At the meeting of the trustees, all the tnem- bers of tne faculty were retained with the excep- tion of Dr. F. R. Jones, who goes to Bryn Mawr. R. Neil Williatns ofthe General Elec- tric company was chosen to succeed Prof. H. T. Eddy, who has accepted a position in the University of Cinci nna.ti. Instructor Edwards was advanced to assistant professor of engineer- in~ and Mr. Williatn Wells was retired as pro- fessor emeritus with salary and residenee for life. 'I'he board adopted resolutions regretting Dr. Jones' departure.

16 THE C·ONOORDIENSIS. BASE BALL SEASON QEVIEWED. The work of the base ball team this season cannot rightly be judged by the immediate l~esults, in scores. As a whole the team has been one of the strongest that has represented the college in recent years, but the fact that only one game, that with West Point, was played with the regular 1 varsity team indicates sotne- what the extent to which it has been crippled throughout the season. Although Union won :five ,gatn·es and lost six, she scored 99 runs against her opponent's 69. Only five men played the entire season, Capt. Grout, Griswold, N. Devoe, M. Devoe and Heath. . Capt. Grout and Griswold have taken part in every game since they have been in college. Of those participating in m .. re than three games, Bradley led at bat with 382, the next four men hitting better than 320 In the field, of those participating in more than three games, Mahar, six games, leads with I,ooo, followed by Griswold, Odwell, N. Devoe, and Capt. Grout. Griswold scored I 7 rues, Capt. Grout and Odwell I 2 each. Griswold also leads in stolen bases. Capt. Grout reached first on base on ball 17 times, Griswold second with 12. Especial credit is due to both Griswold and Devoe for their steady and conscientious work in the points during the season. Tl1eir efforts have been heartily appreciated and the student body will welcome their appear- ance again next spring. As Capt. Grout is the only member of the team graduating this spring, next season's prospects are exceptionally bright. A.. SKETCH. [Frederick Robertson Jones, A. B., Ph. D. In- structor in Hist<;)ry and Sociology; Union College, 1897-1899, Assi:stant Professor, 1899-1902.] The course ia sociology as it now exists in the college is practically Dr. Jones' creation. In developing it he has, by means of ~contribu­ tions from the successive senior classes, built up asociologica'l library that cotnpares favorably with the departmental libraries of other uni- versities. He has also extended the courses in An1erican history, in particular by his special work in the history of New York state. As secreta1·y of the library committee, he has done tnuch :to continue the very valuable work done by Mr. Lynes in reorganizing the library several years ago. Dr. Jones has also been and secretal'y ofthe Alpha of Phi Betta Kappa, chairman of the co:tntnittee of readers in history, of the uniform enh·ance examination board. . FRA.TE~NITY FUNCTIONS. The private functions, which always add so much to the brillian.:e and enjoyn1ent of our cotnmenceruents, this year included a reception and dance given by the AI pha Delta Phi frater- nity on Friday evening, June 6, at their chapter house on the campus; on Monday afternoon, June 9, a reception and tea given by Kappa Alpha in their lodge on the campus ; Monday evening the annual dance of Sigrna Phi, given in Yates' boathouse; and Tuesday a reception by the lJelta Upsilon fraternity in the satne place.
