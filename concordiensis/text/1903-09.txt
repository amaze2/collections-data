With the results of last year's games to stir detennination and the outlook of a bright fu- ture to waken confidence, there seems to be no reason why Old Union should not distin- guish herself in football this fall. for the season. Anyone who knows him, Nutt either personally or by reputation, realizes how much it means to the team and the col- lege to have him with us, for \Bill \ knows, if anybody does, how to turn out a victorious eleven. Captain Olmstead is well pleased \Vith the showing made by the freshmen. The mate- rial, he says, is good and, most encouraging of all, the candidates are willing. There is one marked disappointment, however, and that is that the other classes are not contributing men as they should. 1~here is good material in all three of the upper classes and yet the men show an inclination to let their ability lie dor- mant and to lose an opportunity to win honor for their college. It is to be hoped that they will realize their 111 is take for Union has need of them. On account of the Athletic Tax, the Nlan- agement has been able to secure the best equip1nent that the tean1 has had in years. The schedule of games is a hard one but very well arranged.

The blood of both classes was heated by a chapel rush in the morning and every thing helped to tnake it a fiercely contested ~'scrap.\ According to custom the Sophomores had about six bags .of salt apiece while the freshn1en brought forth several large baskets of tomatoes and it is said even a few eggs were seen in the melee. rfhe Freshmen started with an improvised yell which was well made and were answered with the familiar bat- tle cry of 1906. As the classes marched down the field the air was filled with fruit and salt. After some little individual scraps Captain Olmsted of the football team threw up the cane which fell under a number of n1en, mostly sophomores. But it was not destined to be so easy a victory for so me one n1ad e a cry 1 of \man hurt\ so ford bly that the scrap was called and the classes ordered to line up again for a second trial. rThis titne the superior weight of the Freshmen tolqand a rush carried them under the cane and gave the1n first hold. When the writhing .tnass was removed the Sophomores were found to have six hands on it and the Freshmen eleven. But this was not the end for the Frosh had yet to take away the coveted prize and the men of rgo6 were not the ones to submit to defeat willingly. So t11e scrapoing aontinued until by common consent :IDt>ctor 1'owne took it off for the1n amid the c:lamo1$ of 1906 for another rush and a decis- ion of two out of three. This was not granted however so that the £nal decision was a victory for the Ft:osh. rfhe Fteshmen had about sixty men on th.e field and the Sophs fifty, making one of the largest cane rushes held in several years. A G00'D KICK-OFF. Union Defeats Laureate Boat Club, 5 too. Saturday opened the football season for us, and opened it with the gods on our side. We were well treated to a fair exhibition of o1d- tin1e Union spirit against unfavorable pros- pects, finally resulting in an old-time Union way. None of the 1nen on the Laureate team would have been qualified to enter a lean man's race, and in a weight contest with our team would have easily averaged forty pounds to the good. It was a case of beef and brawn against spirit and fonn, and the latter won. It gener\'all y does when \ Bill '.' Smith is back of it. The game occurred something like th.is: Patton kicked off and Tredick downed the Laureate runner on his 2 o yd. line. Then a few passes with good gains by Laureate which were soon forgotten \vhen Sherrill got the ball on a fumble, and soon after ran with it himself for 20 yards. Laureate soon held for downs, but, although in the shadow of their own goal posts, refused to punt. It was ill-placed collfi- dence on their part. Dann got the ball on a fumble, and the next moment, on a beautifully delayed pass by Sherrill, Capt. Olmstead crossed the line for a touch-down. Patton failed to kick a fairly difficult goal, but ob! it seemed so good to have Union once more even make the attempt. T'he rest of this half, Laureate had the ball and n1ade good gains despite the fine tackles of Oln1stead, R.aymond and Tredick. The half ended with ball on Union's 30 yd line. Second half. Cook got the ball on the kick- off but was downed with srr1all gain. Dann then took the ball for 2 5 yds. followed by \., l I J!' 1.· ,· I' ·• I I r ' .

THAYER'S LECTURE. rrhe l-Ion. Samuel R. Thayer, '6o, of Minne- apolis, Minn., delivered a very interesting and instructive address before the students and son1e friends of the college in the chapel last Friday afternoon. In introducing the speaker, President Ray- n1ond n1ade reference to Mr. Thayer's distin- guished services abroad as an am bass ad or fron1 the United States Government. Aside fron1 its intrinsic merit, therefore, his speech was appreciated as coming from one of Union's sons who had brought honor to his Alma ~1ater. 'The speaker began by a resume of the facts of the Millennium Celebration of the birth of King Alfred the Great, which occurred in England two years ago. Mr. Thayer had been appointed a special delegate to this celebra- tion by the Minnesota Historical society, and his description of it was vivid and impressive. His 1nain subject, however, had a far wider scope. H~ dr©w ;;t ~esson of living from this

'' The grand- est achievement of man,\ he said, ''is cha- racter. The individual who possesses this ap- peals to his conscience rather than to his ap- prehensions. It is the expression of the Divine and the essence of all real manhood is of Divine origin. What our country most needs to-day is spiritual power for that alone is immortal.\ The speaker dwelt at some length upon many of the burning questions and frequent situations of the day and pointed out some valuable processes of reform. Taken as a whole Mr. Thayer's lecture was a scholar's ad- d . 0 ress and 1ts tenor was highly elevated. VESPER SERVICE. On Sunday afternoon the Rev. George Tal- mage of the Second Reforn1ed Church ad- dressed the students in Silliman Hall. His talk was very instructive and eminently prac- tical. He chose for his topic, \The Preserva .. tion of the Vision.'' He gave numerous ex- am pies of ordinary defective vision and grad- ually made his subject bear on the spiritual side of the question. \ My message\ he said in part, \is to young men who have recently left the restraints of Christian homes and have entered the new license and liberty of an en- tirely new life and different surroundings. 'T'o the pure, all things are pure ' and the greatest danger to young men lies in the fact that his vision may be contaminated. Preserve purity of thought at any cost. ''The pesshnist thinks the world is going to pieces but the pessimist is either a bad man, a warped man or a sick man. The loss of faith in the world, in mankind and in God is truly a terrible thing. Whatever things are true, hon- orable, just, pure and lovely, and if there be any virtue, let us think of these.\ COLLEGE MEETING. :Mon.day, Sept. 2rst.

Last night a snowy rose was given me Breathing out Hope and Faith and Purity: Glowing it was, lit by some hidden fire- ( Perchance a song ftom some bright angel's lyre Lost in celestial flight did downward fall Tinging the rose with everlasting flame)- One rose, my rose, for others know no claim, Thy heart is mine, thou answerer to my call.-· Today the bloom is then~: the leaves are dead, Yet no less lovely is the heavenly glow So fair it is tny heart has almost said, \Immortal rose, no fading shalt thou know.\ And yet I know its splendor soon shall pale But though all flowers die, Hope shall not fail.-- S.

Address all communications to THE CONCORDIENSIS, Union College, Schenectady, N.Y. Football There is one season of the year at least when the campus feels especially proud. This is the time. The time when the garnet and buff clad soldiers of Union's gridiron start that work which means victory. Football is the impetus and victory its goal. '' Bill \ Smith has been secured to coach the team and that means even more than a good team. But we have a good team, too, although as yet it is \ in em- bryo.'' With a few weeks practice it is hoped, and there is reason for this hope, that Union will put forth as !trong an eleven as ever defended the Garnet's hon- or. Captain Olmstead is capable and confident. There is one thing, however, which, so far as his team goes, he will not tolerate. To use the only word which express· es it, it is ''knocking.\ lie says, '' If there is any complaint to be made, let it be brought to the manager or to myself.\ This habit is not :foreign to Union men. It is rather customary and very obnoxious. There is absolutely no use for it except as a harmful pastime. If the student body would only stop to con- sider they would find that nothing is gained in the end by this practice. The idea of running down one's own team ! If it should happen that it does not deserve pra1se let us at least be silent. Once more the halls .of old Union greet an incoming class. Again the blue gate, the campus, the terrace, (the idol?) and Captain Jack's garden \velcome the freshmen. And all the welcomes, however varied and strange., are none the less hearty and the hand which greets every member of the class of 1907 comes straight from the heart of a loving Alma Mater to so many noble men. \Vhen the first flush of the new-born experience of college life has abated, however, the members of the youngest class in Union must not forget the purpose for which the college was founded and the purpose for which they entered. It will be beneficial to remember also that the first year of college life often determines the tenor of the remaining years of study and therefore of a whole lifetime. There is no doubt about the fact of a character's being formed in college. It is the time and all circumstances are propitious. Strike rock the first year and the structure which shall be raised from such a foundation shall never fail. Another suggestion will not be untimely. Make up your minds to have lots of college spirit. As the Freshman Bible puts it '' Determine from the first to have plenty of manly college spirit. ' 1 Do that and you will be a credit to yourselves and to Union. Policy of The Board. It will be the purpose of the Board of Editors to pay more attention to the Literary and Alumni departments of the \ Concordiensis \ this year. There will be no radical .(

The Board urges every student in the University, who has any ability or inciination in the direction of writing, to contribute what they can to the paper, and the Editors would specially welcome any contributions from Ut!l.ion's Alum- ni. Resignation We have :learned with surprise and re- of Dr. Truax. gret that soon after Commencement Prof. Truax severed his connection with the college. For eighteen years he had been Professor of the English Language and Literature, and by his ability and faithfulness had won a high place in the regard of his students. vVhile exacting in his demands, he was uni- formly just and courteous and seldom failed to secure the best work of which each man was capable. It is needless to say that he will be greatly missed, in bet it is difficult to think of Union without him, so closely had he become identified with her varied interests. On behalf of all who will never cease to remember him with gratitude, we offer ' him our best wishes for tl1e future in whatever field his energies n1ay be engaged.

Old Union and all her children are happy to greet them. DICTES AND SAYINGS. The race is to the swift mind and the battle to the . strong heart. Selfishness is merely personal interest ad nauseam. The power of application is the greatest test of m- tellect. The greater the height a man attains, the farther the fall should he slip. Unthinking, rose colored optimism is almost as bad as pessimism. The greatest vice in virtue is self-righteousness. 'ri-IE CONOORDIENSIS. 11 THE CON:STITUTlONAL AMEND- MENT. The fol :owing an1endment of the Constitu- tion of the Concordiensis was passed at a meet- ing of the Board for that purpose, held after due notice, on June 4, 1903: IX. 1. In the fall term ofeach year,candi- dates fron1 the sophon1ore class shall, upon call of the business 111anager, register 'vith him in competition for that position. 'I'he busi- ness manager shall then assign work connected with the n1anage1nent of the Concordiensis to each candidate, and report to the Concordien- sis Board the an1ount of work performed by each candidate. In the Spring T'erm, the board sho.li deliver to the president of the sophomore class the nan1es of such candi- dates, as th~ey consider ba ve done work suffi .. cient to rt,nder thetn eligible, and from the number of such eligible n1·en ·the sophomore class shall elect a second assistant business manager, who at the beginning of his junior year shall becotne assistant business; n1anager and in his senior year shall be business mana- ger. In case a vacancy shall occur in the office of assistant business manager the office shall be filled :n the same manner frorn the Junior class, except that the period of competition shall be not less than four weeks. A vacancy in the office of the business manager shall be filled by the senior class. Section V. of the Constitut~on shall be construed as relating to the assistant business manager, except that a vacancy so occurring shall be filled in the satne manner as a vacancy arising from any other reason.
