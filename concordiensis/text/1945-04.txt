Hemp ton Chosen DanceCommitteeChairman. l,nterfraternity Council Convenes On Post War 'Fraternity Housing At a meeting of the Interfrater- • nity Council held Wednesday even- ing, April 4, in SHliman Hall, the major topic under consideration and discL ssion was the future and position of the fraternity houses on Union College campus. Dr. Benja- min P. Whitaker, Acting President of the college was present and he revealed the plans of the adminis- tration and the way in which it intends to cope with the situation. 9> Inter-Fraternity Council, Senior Class Sponsors The Interfraternity Council and the Senior Class of Union College have formed definite plans to spon- sor an all college prom. Mention of such a prom had ·been made in last weeks issue of the Concordiens-is. A tentative date of May 26, 1945 has been given. I Dr. H. La!rrabee' s New Type logic Text Publ:ished cult for the former off-campus fra- ternities to regain their houses 111fter the war because in such in- stances as in the cases of Kappa Sigma, Sigma Chi, and Kappa Nu, these houses have been turned into apartment houses to help meet the critical housing shortage in this area. The alumni committee on frater- nities feels that the time is now at A permanent committee of alum- hand when fraternities should do Hempton Is Chairman William C. Baker, president of the Interfraternity Council and A. S. Walter B. Goad, Jr., president of the Senior Class have announced the appointment of A. S. Robert E. Hempton as chairman of the forth- coming spring prom. Announced this week by chair- man Hempton were the names of the six men chosen to work with him on the committee, the list in- cluding three Navy men and three civilians. The committee roster at the present time re·ads as follows: Decorations . . . . . . Robert I. Potter Publicity .... Albert W. Plambeck Invitations . . . . . . Walter A. Short Booths ........ Calvin R. Simmons Chaperones . . . . . Thomas Carney Tickets ...... -.~. homas R. Reid, Jr. WE\el{-End Affair The prom this year will feature a prom weekend instead of the usual Saturday evening dance which has been the custom of proms dt:ring the past few t.erms. A. S. Francis C. McMath Will be placed in charge of securing som.e form of entertainment for the Fri- day preceeding the night of th_e prom. It is expected, although 1t is not yet definite, that these en- tertainment plans may include some informal parties or dances. No name has been given this prom as yet but however in the. very near future, a suitable name will be presented and made public to the college community. It has not been definitely decided whether or not a \name\ band· or a local orchestra will appear at this prom. One proposal in favor of a local orc·hestra is that many bands of the type we are accusto~ed t? have broken up due to the Imposi- tion of the midnight curfew by the War Manpower Commission. An argument in favor of a \name'' band is that there should be some ba,nds availaJble for contract in as mt:ch as the month of May Is the period between the regular winter and summer seasons of most bands. ----0•---- Members Sought for Christian FellowshJp At the last weekly meeting of the Union College chapter of the .rnte~­ varsity Christian Fellowship, 1t was decided that all future meet- ings will be held on Tuesday eve- nings at 1830 instead of on Monday evenings as in the past. The . next meeting is to be held on April 10, at 1830 in Silliman Hall. Althoug.h the membership of this . group IS steadily gaining, the offiCers and present members express their de- sires that still more of the student body become members of the. ca;m- pus chapter. No dues or adm!ss.t~~ fees are required. The sole requne ment is that members be sincere Christians who desire to become a_f- filiatd with a group whose ma~n purpose is Christian fellowship through Bible slt: dy and prayer. ----o---- Finance Officers Elected Abbott Weinstein. was elected chairman, and A.

A resource sttdent is one who because of his interest and maturity will be suffi- ciently acquainted with a topic so that he will be able to keep the high school students, who will also participate, in constant discussion and not allow them to wander from the topic under discussion. The International Relations Club is most pleased to work with the Schenectady County League of Women Voters in this worthwhile program of immense civic signifi- cance. Mrs. Harold A.

Union College will continue to have a Navy V-12 t1·ainees' t:nit during the college term beginning July 1 and lasting until November 1, Dr. Benjamin P. 'Whitaker, act- mg president of the college has an- nounced. For a time it was believed that because of a general curtailment of the navy college training program, the unit at Union 'College would be discontinued at the end of the cur- rent term. The navy has found it impractic- able, however, to initiate new naval reserve officers' trainin·g corps on July 1, and has requested that colleges and universities now having V-12 units contim:e having these units for another term. An official statement by Dr. Whitaker on the continuance of the Navy V-12 unit is as follows: The Bureau of Naval Personnel ha.s notified us that the Navy V-12 Unit at Union College will be con- tinued for the term beginning 1 July 1945. \Recent developments in Navy training,'' according to the letter received from the Bureau, \have made it impracticable to commis- sion .and new NROTC Units on 1 July 1945, as contemplated in Navy V-12 Bulletin No. 288, dated 15 Feb- ruary 1945.\ The Bureau states, however, that \in general, the plans for transition from the V-12 Program to the ex- panded NROTC Program will be carried forward in accordance with the general principles laid down in the Navy V-12 Bulletin No. 288. In particular the time at which any student begins courses in Naval Science and Tactics will not be af- fected, because such courses will begin at .all units which will have NROTC candidates.\ \The number and distribution of officer candidates to be included in the training program for the 1 July 1945 term cannot yet be deter- mined,\ the Navy letter goes on to state. \As a consequence, while the V-12 Unit will remain at your institt: tion for that term, it is im- possible to specify at this time the quota of trainees to be on board and the facilities required for housing and messing. It is expect- ed that information on these mat- ters will be forwarded to you not later than 30 April 1945.\ Union is of course pleased to have the privilege of continuing its participation in the Navy V-12 pro- gram for an additional term. The College has filed an application for an NROTC Unit and would wel- come the opportunity of continuing its satisfactory relations with the Navy Department in the training of Naval officers as a participant in the expanded NROTC program.

FOR ANNIVERSARY DAY This Summe1· l'nion ,,.ill commemorate the lGllth yem· of it::; founding. Preparations :m::> under way for the celebration. ~ot many colleg-es in the l 'nitect States can l>uast of such an ag-e. A lilOth anniversary is no minor event for a colleg-e. Let the celebration be IHH'th~- of the occasion. The \rm· will undoubted!~· have a damping ll'e can still commemo1·ate the event. The effect, but that cannot be moided. Howewr alumni and f1·iends of the Colleg-e can meet nn the Campu~-alunmi and anniversary din- ners ma.\ be given-and a general. thoug·h mnderate, atmosphere of festivity may be maintained. Fur this important occasion, the Campus should be put in the best of order. Little re- pairs he1·e and there should be made to show the College in its true splendor on anniver- saQ· ctay. When the visitors arrive from near and fal', let them find the College in perfect appeat·Clnce. One of the repairs that should be made cunce1ns the .:\Iemorial hCapel. 011 the ceiling· and the west wall are numerous spots where the plaster has loosened and fallen. These spots are rather unsig-htly, pm·- ticulal'ly for people sitting- in the balcony. The overall appearance of our beautiful chapel suffers severely from these few spots. If the Colleg-e is to look its ebst, these must be removed. It is only a minor repair-no large effort will be necessary. Another repair job that is quite necessa1 y concerns the outside appearance of the Old- g)·m I>ormito1·v. A little pa.inting would im prove it much .• ·Uso some of the faint truces of paint on Paine and Klue gate should be re- moved m· overpainted with a neutral color. Some of thl:' paint marks on the sidewalks should be similarly treated. Sophomores and Freshmen: let's h,;ve some painting of the Idol-let's show the alumni that there's still some of that old spirit left at Vnion! FORUMS In a previous editorial, we expressed the hope that, in the near future, Union Colleg-e would see Student-faculty discussions of the t~·pe instituted at the University of Ver- mont. At these fot·ums topics such as teach- ing, ad ministration, and study were discuss- eel <:tt great length; both the student body and the faculty, though hard pressed for time, were able to anive at definite conclu- sions, and plans were made whereby the ma- joritr of persons concerned were appreciably benefited. There is no reason why discussion gmups of this sort could not function here at Union College; it is solely a matte1· of cooperation. and the sooner the students voice their opin- ions as to the desirability of these \bull-ses- sions\ the sooner the faculty members may be approached to play their essential part. Because of our accelerated program, man~· problems continually arise; problems such as tests. classroom work and standardization of ma1·ks, and man~· others, are in dire need of suitable and sufficient solutions. The stu- dent would be able to say what he thought concerning these matters, without a w~ste of lecture hours, and thus clear them up in his mind once and fo1· all. Every member of the student body lws at least one sug·g-estion of imp1·ovement to make. Our teachers and professors, because of the varied and lengthy experience that is theirs, are definitely capable of answering our queries on an~· topic pertaining to edu- cation, whether it be compamtively personal ot· whether it deals with a specific gToup. They are alwa~·s approachable and \\'illing to help. They realize that only through a com- bination of independent educational \delv- ing\ on our part into our work, plus a con- stant flow of advice on theirs, will our college career be a success, in the true sense of the word. The ·1eaming process is a complicated one, and it would be folly to plunge ag-ain and again into a blind alley, when sober words of ad vice and help, fl\Om men who know our various problems, may set us straight, save valuable time, and enable us to see clearly and thus advance confidently. These \bull-sessions\ have been a great success at the University of Vermont-much has been accomplished; and judging by the comments in their school newspaper ther have been received favorabi~· b~· the majority of the students. Please dmp your note con- cerning the approval of the forums into the Concordiensis letter box as soon as possible, so that we may judge whether or not the students think such a plan feasible. Plans will then be made--but not before~ It is more than probable that these forums will be a distinct help to you in your studies at Union College.

Church St.. Schenectady. at 8:30P.M. The production, t nder the capa- ble direction of Russel Field, is very much worth seeing, and should not be missed by anyone in- terested in the theatre, or by any- one who, for that matter, enjoys a good laugh. When first produced on Broadway, and later in Holly- wood, the play attracted so much attention that by now it's fame is universal and a commentary on the play itself would be superfluous here. This comedy is good ente•·- tainment for its laugh lines alone, and only censorship prevents some of them from being reprinted in this article. The play is full of ·brilliant repartee, abounding in srch epithets as \Miss Bedpan,\ and \boduoir butterfly.\ Those who would have the full enjoyment of such banter will, however, have to >·ee the play for themselves. \The Man Who Came to Dinner\ is, howevet·, more than a vehicle for bt'illiant repartee. This produc- tion is particularly worth seeing for the two leads alone. Henry Nelson does a beautiful job in the part of Sheridan Whiteside, and Nancy Howe is a superb Maggie Cutler. Keep your eyes on this young lady: she's going places. Lynn Thomson plays her part for all it is worth, and twenty-three other supporting characters make this show a riotous adventt:re in the field of comedy. ! • Speaking of Operations!

Breast stroke artists quali- fying in the finals of the 50 yard breast stroke ar·e Fox, Braun, Canter, and Dalton. Commenting on the swimming 1-ntramurals, Mel states that he likes the enthusiasm displayed so far. Civilians have been a little lax in making good their inten- tions to swim but this, howevel', is not a criterion for subsequent sports as interest is running high. Following are the dates and times of swimming events as posted by Mel Hein: April 10- Tuetiday Semi-Finals -Side Stroke 50- Yards. Time: 1630 Heat 1. 1635 Heat 2. Semi-Finals-Free Style 100 Yards.

Even the Chief Specialists were amazed to see second-class swimmers perform with such first-class prowess that number one slots were awarded to them. Important baseball news will be found this week on page 4, eolumn 6, and page 1, column 4. This news was too late to make the sports page, and therefore appears in another part of the papf'r. Watch the Concordy for future sport breal,s! Concordy's Sportling is proud to present this week Bob Veigel, chunky southpaw hurler on Hal Whittner's Garnet baseball nine. Hailing from Rochester, N. Y. he entered Monroe High School in that city, September, 1940. In his sophomore year at Monme, Bob was on the baseball squad and also played golf, a sport in which he has always excelled. The fol- lowing year Veigel transferred to· Manlius Military Academy in Man- lius, New York just outside Syra- cuse. At Manlius Bob was a re- s~rve fullback on that institution's football squad, played basketball and was one of the stellar perform- ers on the golf squad. The following year he returned to Monroe High School in his na- tive city where he immediately won a spot for himself as the qt.arter- back on the football team. At that time, the husky Veigel sustained an ankle injury which shelved him for the entire eeason. When the spring rolled around he took up his glove and assumed the roll of pitcher-outfielder on the school baseball nine. As a hurler he start- ed only one game and relieved in four others and had a s>eason rec- ord of two victories and no defeats. His batting avemge for the season was .456-obviously high for a pitcher. For his all aroun,d .per- fanuance he wa~ given honorable mention on the All-Rochester Scho- lastic Team. Bob's greatest thrill in sports came during the fall of 1943 when he was runner-up in the Junior State Golf T01.:rnament held that year in Syracuse. Entering Union in July, 1944, he was active in intramurals. His first taste of varsity competition will come this spring as a member of Union's baseball nine. Bob is at present awaiting word from Anna- polis concerning his appointment to the Naval Academy i-n July 1945. Bob maintains that his fast ball is his best, and he particularly likes to puzzle the batters with a change of pace. His greatest desipe is to pitch a winning game against a college team. Bob is a member of Phi Gamma Delta fraternity, into which he was initiated last October. C. S.

The change was made after it was found that a confliction with the Interscholastic Track Meet, sponsored by the Schenectady Police Department would occur if the dance was held as tentatively scheduled on May 26. It was decid- ed that preparations for the even- ing's dancing 0n May 26 C'ould not be made, as the gym would be in use all afternoon. This will be the first Dance weekend since 1943 when Enoch Light was featured at the Prom. This was bef01'e the arrival of the Navy on the College scene. A week end fi-lled with sports, parties and the Prom dance is be- ing planned by the committee, Al- though no definite plans have been made, the committee is making ar- rangements fot· a picnic and en- tertainment to take place Friday night. This idea has been worked cut so that it can be held, come 1 a in or shine, and will be included on thE' pricP of the Prom admis- sion ticket.

Dr. Benjamin P, Whitaker, act- ing president of Union College, is- sued the following statement con- cerning the death of President Franklin D, Roosevelt: \President Roosevelt's death is an international tragedy. Coming at this critical hour when the mHi- tary victory for which he gave so much is so near at hand, and when the struggle to establish world peace - which needed his strong leadership-has hardly begun, his sudden passing is a severe shock. \Whatever our political allegiance or our attitude toward the Federal legislation and programs during the past thirteen years, we recognize the greatness -of Mr. Roosevelt's leadership. For his reforms he not only gained acceptance, but re- tained a popular devotion virtually unprecedented. The first to serve his country as President for more than two terms, he continued to receive the confidence and the sup- port -of the people-a people who, above all things, suspect and dis- trust dictatorship. \Mr. Roosevelt's achievements ex- tending over thirty-five years of public life assure him a place among the really great men of the world, Being human, he made some mis- takes. But his countrymen will remember his vision, his concern fot· the common man, his per- sistence and courage in effecting the reforms he considered overdue. \Union is especially grieved by Mr. Roosevelt's death because we have long considered him a close friend, if not a direct member of our family. His father, James Roosevelt, took his college work here and was graduated in the class of 184 7. NAVY V-12 UNIT UNION COLLEGE SCHENECTADY, N.

Meeting Every Friday Night at 7 P. M. ill Student Activities Office-Washburn Hall. A•ll ln·l'erested Are Invited to Attend. AN ERA ENDS The death of P1·esident Franklin Delano Hoosevelt has shocked the nation and the world. Last nig-ht and today newspapers Juwe screamed the tmgic news to nearly every individual the world over. The Concordiensis is a colleg·e newspaper that must keep its group of readers informed. It is not with pleasm·e that we announce the repercussions of the death of our Commander-in-Chief. .:\!any great men have passed to their g-loi'Y in the past few months. The deaths of Wen- dell Lewis Willkie and Alfred Emmanuel Smith, champions of millions, brought <\Or- row to both their former ::;upporters and op- ponents. The sudden and unexpected r1Path of OlU own ueloved Dr. Dixon Ryan Fox brought grievances to all our hearts, and the hearts or thousands of educators, stu.tes- men, and friends the world over. Only last week we read, with many memories, of the passing of David Lloyd George-one of the Big Four who developed the Versailles Treat~·-one of the greatest English St:ites- men that eve1· lived. Yesterday the gTf'atest blow was dealt. Franklin Delano noosevelt held the un- known quantity of a great equation-per- haps the greatest and the mosts compli~ated equation the world has ever known-the peace that is to follow this great world strug-gle. lie wm; ncquainted with ever~· prmse of this world wm·. Who, if anyone, can ever replace his familiarity with the scene of the world today'? We fear that ques- tion can never be answered. President Hoosevelt was not great for these things alone, however. He was to be looked to as a great inspiration by those thousands of crippled and maimed wm· vet- erans who, after this war, will find them- selves unprepared to reenter the sudety which they left. F. D. R.'s reco1·d is the example of the amount of guts that a man can use. Despite his great physical disab1lit;v he rose to the world's most prominent posi- tion-the Presidency of the United States! Regardless of our political leanings and philosophie:::; ,.,.e cannot help but feel gri<'f in our hearts. The leader elected by the ma- jority of American voters has left us. Within our minds remains the impression of his strength, ability, and love of our country. He 1 epresented a philosophy of Government opposed b~· millions, but preserved b~· the majority. He has led the United States through mol'e than twelve years of her his- tory, and 110\\'-because of his efforts-he has left us. He will never be forgotten. R.H.U. GOOD MUSIC PLEASE! Of great inte1·est to the whole student body is the formal dance which is being planned by the lnterfratemity Council and the Senior class. It has come to our attention that a local orchestra is being considered to play the key part in this \to be remembered\ social event. During thE' late .rears of the colorful hi~ tory of Union College, the custom has been to make a foi'l11al dance the highlight of the social season. In peace times the \House Pm·t,y Weekend\ was one to look forward to with more than mild anticipation. Tile talk of a formal dance without n name band makes us stop and wonder if the social activities at UnioN College have \gone com- pletely to the dogs,\ and whether Ol' not it is even worth while to talk of a formal dance. As far as we have been able to discern, the1•e has never been a formal dance in the con- temporary history of Union College at which a 'non-name' band has played. The last two formals have been successful from all stand- points, r·eg-ardless of the decrease in regis- tl'ation. Is it beyond the realm of the possible that the men at Union would pay a bit more to obtain a band of national fame'! Is it not more than possible that a fot·mal dance would be a failure if such a band is not obtained? Would you he willing· to import the \g-al from back home\ to a weekend sparked by a mediocre orchestra? We h•a ve these questions in the hands of the prom committee! Perhaps it is old fashioned to ask that t1·adition and precedent be not disturbed, but if ti'Hddition is good-is there anyon'= who should destroy it to substitute a weak sec- ond'? Vv'e do not believe there i.s, and we be- lieve that with a little extrf. work on the part of the committee, the ticket salesmen, the organizations involved, and the whole ~ollege community, a prom worthy of con- gTatulations can be successfully managed. R.H.B. HONOR ROLL The list of Union College graduates now serving in all of the armed forces of the United States, is indeed an imposing one. Union College alumni have partidpa ted in every major battle and engagement in this war where American forces have been ac- tive; they have been decorated innumerable times and their achievements have been de- didedly noteworthy. A day hardly passes \vithout the Student Activities Office receiv- ing some bit of news about one of Union Col- lege's many soldiers, sailors, mm·ines or services. .Moreover, there is another list of even greater importanc~-the casualty list of Union College's honored and cherished dead. The dead who gave their lives far abovf' the ruins of gutted German cities, in the sticky feve1·-l'idden jungles of the South Pacific, and on the hot and bloody sands of 1'.:0rth Af1·ica, Salerno and Anzio. It is p1·imarily to preserve the lives and the actions of these men in the hearts and the minds of all those who came in contact with them or otherwise, that we ask for the construction of an honor- roll. We want an honor-roll that will contain the names of every Union College alumnus now serving for his cotmtry. At first such an order my seem to entail a great deal of work and expense-but it can be done, if the people who would necessarily have the authority over this matter, want it badly enough. \Where there is a will there is a way.'' And to come right down to it- there really is not very much work. Thet·e are many sites for such an hvnor- roll on the Union College campus. That would not present any great problem. An honor-roll, such as the one we propose, would be a mute testimony to the effective· ness of the college in the training of mel\l to meet any emergency or situation, and to meet it boldly, squarely and without flinch- ing. We therefore propose it as a highly. -Ballads and Swedish foil~ songs from the .famed Jenny Lind repertoire will be presented by Miss E. Fl'llnces Keelan and Miss M.

F 0 R A R R 0 W SHIRTS The intra-squad game was clut- tered with Pl't•ms, most of them very stupid et·Jors. The pitchers missed several opportunities to Practice Action NEL.<;ON WRAY ratch a man off l~Ii! sack, and did not take their windups when the moments of respite were offered. In the infield the day was spotted with muffed grounders, and wild throws. Ray Hart missed an excel- lent chance to catch a runner ad- vancing to second, but instead of tagging the runner out he threw the ball wildly to the third base, This is only one of the errors com- mitted that day, but it clearly il- lustrates the lack of good baseball The loss of Southpaw Bob Veigel i:o a hard felt blow. Coach Wittner had been planning to use Bob 1egularly this coming season and the loss puts a big dent in the pitching staff. Bob passed the en- tr·ance examinations for the United State::; Naval Academy, and is leav- ing school to rest up for the gruel- ling days ahead of him. Hal is counting on Lowell Brown to carry most of the weight this season, backed up by Harvey Jensen, and Dick Donahue. Union beat Nott Terrace in a practice game Wednesday to the tune of 11 to 2. Both of the teams put on a very sloppy exhibition of baseball. Terrace's pitching staff looked very poor, and the Garnet sluggers in the persons of Jim Albrecht, Bill Holstein, Lowell Brown, Lou 'Zangari, and Bob Fox had a field day at the plate. Jess Perkins is the mentor of Nott Ter- I ace this year, and it looks like he has a lot of work on his hands to whip the team into shape. He has a slugger in the person of Jim Albrecht's younger brother who was responsible for one of Ter- 1 ace's two runs.

Charlie Brockner has been a great help to Hal Wittner in the past week. Charlie has been work- ing the outfield, while Hal has been able to devote his attention to the infield. Charlie has also been teach- ing the rudiments of sliding to the men who are not too familiar with that art.

Y •• FRIDAY, APRIL 20. 1945 GOOD LUCK \THROCKY\ Price 10c P·owerful New Cargo Vessel Named After U n1on • Starlight Soiree Name Chosen for June 2nd Dance i V. }uselis, Navy Man, Submits Best Entry; Play for· Friday Evening, Starlight Soiree was chosen as the name for the dance highlight- ing the Prom weekend of June Sec-' ond which will start both formal and informal festivities of Union's Sesquicentennial Anniversary. The Idea for the name, and entry win- ning the .free ticket to Union's big- gest prom of the year was select- ed after careful consideration of over one .hundred entries submitted to the Committee, it was llllinauced by A. S. Robert E. Hempton. The Committee represents the Inter- fraternity Counci·l and the Senior Class. The winning entry was submitted by Vince Juselis a Navy man, from South College. Plans Taking Shape Plans for Prom Weekend and the Starlight Soiree are being whipped into shape and a definite announce- ment of the name of the band is expected in time for next week's issue of the Concordiensis. After a thorough study the Committ- has :11onnd it inadvisable to obtain a name band. This was decided when, according to the committee, it was found that the price of a ticket would be around fifteen dol- lars. To many men would not be able to attend if the cost was madEi so prohibitive, and the entire Week- end would be to.o expensive for both Navy and civilian studen~s. The Committee has made one of Its aims, to obtain the best possible entertainment for the Prom week- end, without making prices out of reasonable proportions. Local bands are being auditioned. Play Friday Evening Plans for the Friday evening en- tertainment under the direction of A. S. Francis McMath and A. ~­ Donald Dalton will include an Ol'l- ginal play depicting the life o~ a civilian and Navy student at Umon College in these harrowing times. After the picnic and play several fraternity houses will be opened to permit informal dancing. The Comimttee bas arranged with the College to open several fra- ternity houses to provide overnight accommodations for guests. The price of quarters for the girls for the weekend, Friday and Saturday nights, will be under ~\:o dollars for both evenings provid!llg a loW cost answer to the problem of where to put your girl. Price of tickets will include ad- mission to the picnic, play, and in- formal dances -on Friday evening, and to the Starlight Soiree at Alumni Gymnasium. Saturday evening. The cost of admission will be announced shortly after the selectioin of the band. . Any ideas for Prom Weekend w_Ill be welcomed •by the Prom Commit- tee, and may be turned in to Chair- man Robert E. Hempton, Room 4, South College, or left at the . Stu- dent Activities Office. All . Ideas will be given the fullest considera- tion. ---o--- ASCE Informal Dinner Both the Union and the R.P.I. Student Chapters of the ASCE gathered with the Mohawk-Hud- son Division of the ASCE ast !ues- day night for an informal d!llner meeting at Hale House. The purpose of the meeting was to give the members .of the tv:ro Student Chapters an idea of the dif- ference •between schooling and the actual practice of engineering, and · 'th some of to acquwint the men WI · the Civil Engineers in the Schenec- tady area. c t Among the speakers were ap · Burrell, USN, now stationed at Troy who spoke on some of his vari~d experience gained with ~he N during 38 years of service. 0~;:; speakers were City Mana~er Harrell and Morris Cohen, U:nion graduate. and Sanitary Engmeer for the city of Schenectady. Launched Soon- ''U. S. S. Union Victory\ -~ Portland, Oregon Site of Proposed Launching, May 16 Dr. H. D. Gideonse Addresses Youth Meeting at Union The challenge of fighting what he termed as the \deepest scourge of our social structure, war,\ was given by Dr. Harry D. Gideonse, president of Brooklyn College, ad- dressing the youth meeting at Union College Wednesday at the ail-day student conference on \Peace.\ Two hundred thirty-five students representing schools of seven counties, including Schenec- tady, attended the conference, which was planned by the Schenec- tady County League of Women Voters. Challenge of Peace Dr. Gideonse declared that in a country which has the power and the wealth and the moral drive of the United States, and in a country that has produced such leaders as Woodrow Wilson, Wendell Wilkie and Franklin Roosevelt, there is a have brought us for the second time in a generation to world war, he said. As a hopeful outloolt toward the building of a permanent peace, Dr Gideonse spoke of the methods of approach of the present time to the problems of the peace. We are this time worlting toward ultimate world organization, more in a piece-meal, one-at-a-time fashion, rathet than trying to accept an entire plan all at once, he indi· cated. The peace at the close of the last year, Dr. Gideonse said, was embodied in one document, the Treaty of Versailles ,which con· tained the covenant of the League of Nations, the I'eparations, the possibility that plans for lasting peace may be built. He expressed a belief that if we become suf- ficiently aware of this challenge to enduring peace, we may accom- plish something about the scourge of war. Dr. Gideonse propounded the idea that the world has arrived at great- er thinge in the past through rea- son of judgment and understand- ing, than by way of expert knowl- edge. He spoke of the aversion many leaders of the times have toward untl'ied ideas, and pointed out that unless we are willing to try the new, we shall continue in the old mistakes. Ideas we have already tested at:~d have relied upon (Continued on Page 2) STARLIGHT SOIREE BALLOT This ballot is to be filled out and placed in the mail shute of Mr. Given's office at the South end of Washburn Hall before Monday night, April 23.

Characterizing the conference as a diagnostic clinic, Acting Presi- dent Benjamin P. Whitaker wel- comed the delegates, who came· un~ der ODT .regulations from twenty states and Canada. He spoke brief- ly on the need for deeper relations between the medical schools and thepremedical colleges, and called particular attention to the medical problems of the veterans who will be returning to college in increas- ing numbers. In delivering the main address of this morning's session on the ob- jectives of scientific training in premedical education, Dr. Joseph Clarence Hinsey, Dean o1' the Cor- nell University Medical College, de- clared that the future of medicine will be best served if students come into it with a variety of trainings. \This training, however, should comprise,'' he said, \a minimum of three academic years before en- trance into medical school.\ Dr. Hinsey listed various detri- ments in sound premedical train- ing, and st:ggested certain improve- ments, such as more emphasis upon methodology in scientific instruc- tion in secondary schools, the in- creasing of the number of teachers, <Continued on Pa_ge 4) Leaving Us?

First came the sneak attack on Pearl Harbor, followed by many atroci- ties by the enemy, and now, I'm being \booted\ out of the Unit. I want to take this opportunity to thank all the people who have been so kind to me during my stay at Union. From the appn·ntice sea- men to the Skipper and the many civilians who have been darn nice to me. I realize why I'm being \transferred\ from the Unit . , . I had a habit of chasing everyone not in Navy blue. I'm not sorry for chasing anyone, because the ones I chased who rate an apology don't need one since they understand and the only sorrow I express to the ones who claim I bit them Is that I didn't. I would have stopped chasing people, if given a cha.nCl!', and would like to remind you that Rome wasn't built in a day, and Juliet wasn't an overnight job. I've chased some of the biggest men on Campus and they weren't afraid . • . why, I chased the Dean every morning and afternoon and. twice on Sundays and all I got was a scolding and an understanding pat on the head. I appreciate the help and consideration given me by the many people who tried their .best to give me another chance, and I'm even willing to bury the hatchet with those who didn't . . . the line forms to the right ... with bared heads. U.S.S. 'Union Victory' New Victory Type Cargo Ship Faster Than Older Craft Early in February 1941, shortly after the United States Maritime Commission authorized the con- struction of a huge fleet of cargo vessels, ground was broken for the construction of an 11 way shipyard on a 78 acre site along the east bank of the Williamette River, in the northeastern suburbs of the city of Portland, This shipyard was called the Oregon Shipbuilding Corporation and operated for the United Maritime Commission by the Kaiser organization. S. S. Union Victory Since the inception of the Oregon Shipbuilding Corporation this one shipyard has launched and deliver- ed 330 Liberty cargo vessels, launched and delivered 30 Attack Troop Transports and with the launching of the S. S. Union Vic- tor~· on or abot:t May 16 will have launched 77 Victory cargo ships. The new Victory type ship is a faster vessel, with finer hull lines and equipped with turbine.gear propulsion machinery of more than twice the horsepower of the recip- rocating st~am engine used in the Liberty. Greatest advantage of the Victory Ship over the Liberty is her increased speed. The Liberty has a speed of a little rriore than 11 knots, while the Victory is design- ed for 15 knots or more. Of all steel welded construction, the Vic- tory ship is arranged for the freighting of dry cargo in five main holds with deep tanks for fuel oil and ballast. Alumni Representatives Plane are now in the making to have any Union College Portland area alumni present at the pro- posed launching on May 16. One of the alumni will be officially desig- nated by the college to represent Union College at the brief christ- ening ceremonies and will give a short talk. A message from Dr. Whitaker is expected to be read at the launching platform. Union College is to present the S.S. Union Victory with a 30\ aerial photograph of the colleg which will be hung in the quarters of the ship. Victory ships are c~:rrently being named for American colleges and universities. The Ust from which names are selected is made up of all colleges and universities In the United States having a body of more than five hundred. The order of assignment follows as closely as possible the chronological order of the dates of founding. ----0--- Fellows, I'm writing this letter in a, state of exhausted pleas and hope for staying here with you. It will be impossible for me to be an Alumnus of Union College. Are you going to follow my example? Are . you going to bat for me, OI\ will you, too, submit to the desires of the insignificant minority? A par- don must be forthcoming by Satur- day noon at the latest or I'll be wending my ~:>ad way to another home, leaving h~:ndreds o1' heavy hearts in my once happy hunting grounds. The home will be a good Delphic Society Plans to Get Key The Delphic Society has petition- ·ed the Student Finance Committee for an allotment sufficient to cover the cost of keys for all members. William Baker, president of the So- ciety, stated that the amount nec- essary for this is $99.00, American money. This figure covers not only the cost of keys, but the federal tax, and charge for alteration of the die. Since the society will as- sume the old Terrace Council key, these changes are necessary. one, but I'll miss the days I spent with you fellows. There are things I would like to say here, but it wouldn't be nice.

It was also announced that Prof. The results of the strength tests will be anounced next week, Lt. (jg) J. B. Palmer stated today. The Con- cordy will publish the results in next week's paper.

All Interested Are Invited to Attend. AN ANSWER A battle roral could easily develop over the question of the band to play at the Starlight Soiree. This week's Concordy carries a letter from A. S. Hobert E. Hempton, Chairman of the Committee in charge of this ball. In this letter :Mt·. Hempton suggests coopemtion from the Concordiensis. We ask l\lr. Hemp- ton to count the number of inches of space this publication has devoted to publicity for the tSal'ligh t Soiree. We have made no derogatory remarks about the formal or its managers. It is not our desire to work against this Committee. It IS our desire to place om· efforts on a constructive basis. Today we have included on the front page a ballot which will indicate the desires of the student body concerning this dance. We believe that if a name band is procured for this event it will not be necessary to charge such a phenominal price as is suggested by the committee. It is our contention that Union men would more willingly support a big prom on a one night basis than a week- end affair sparked by a small local orchestra. It is our desire to discover the true senti- ments of the undergraduate body, and thus let the Committee benefit from the students' opinion. The Starlight Soiree obviously cannot be ~uccessful without the wholehearted support of the whole college community. We have attempted to reflect what we believe to be the contentions of our college commurdty. lf we have failed we will gladly admit it. If the Commimttee has been too presumptu- ous, we hope they will t·ectify the situation we ask no more . . . the vote will tell. R.H.B. THROCKMORTON Fur almost a year the Vnion College cam- pus and the student body has lJeen blessed by the presence of that brov:n, cuddly sprite-Throckmorton. Wherever we went, his intelligent, homely face haunted us. We could never have asked more from a dog; cleverness, keen sparkling antics, and an un- usual ability when it came to learning new tl'icks-these were his attributes. As a mas- cot. there should be no doubt in our minds- he v.:as unsurpassed. Because his exact par- entage was never determined did not bother us; we only asked that he demonstrate his own God given dog-traits. And he did! Perhaps it would be advisable to study, for a moment, his sturdy physical character- istics. His fox-like head is a masterpiece of sculpture perfection, his sharp inquh-ing eyes forever shine with the light of canine wisdom and knowledge, while his muscular body well proportioned as it is, is ably de- signed and adapted for the strenuous pm·suit of stray vagrants, automobiles and trucks on our quiet, peaceful campus. The \rakish\ angle of his ears, we are told by animal experts, is inddicative of his virile character- istics. Have you ever seen him lounging liesurely here and there-no! He is always up and around with an amazing, if not mys- terious, energy. But suddenlJ· a deep, dark shadow was cast upon this pleasant and sunny picture. Evil and designing forces, working behind the massive and closed doors of this institu- tion, have drawn up wicked schemes for the deportation of our beloved mascot! God grant that such a crime be never perpa- trated. Surely Providence will never allow our precious Throckmorton to be snatched, cruelly and viciously, from our . protecting arms, and then too, perhaps the strong- and powerful instigators ·of such an infamous act will relent, and see that such a dastardly thing should never be ! \Vatch him closely now, and see that de- spite his persecuHon he still carries his head erect, as is his inborn manner, with his jaw thrust out in defiance of the whole world. Not for an instant did he slink away to nurse his wounded pride and spirit. And yet he still may be taken f·tom us, this king of dogs, this knight of the canine world! Never let it enter your thoughts that a suitable sub- stitute may be found for Throckmorton- \vhether it be more pedigTee or not. This cun- not Le-we think. We end this editorial with the firm belief that the icy and darkness enshrouded spirits that hovered over this fa.ir campus and chilled it with that fateful declaration, will t·epent and grant us thP company of that \perfect specimen\ of dogdom - Throck- morton. SPORTS INTEREST With the approach of the baseball SPason, perhaps it would be wise to ascertain our future attitude towards sports at Union Col- lege. The baseball' team faces a difficult ~chedule; very few of the present dia111ond squad have had actual previous college ex- perience, and it will be our duty to keep their morale at the highest possible pitch. \Ve can achieve this end b;; showing them that we care-by regular attendance at the scheduled games, by watching their practice sessions whenever we have a chance ,and by sincerely cheering them on. Their coach, their man- agers, and the squad itself is putting every- thing they have into it-they know that they near future, and as a result their pr:.1ctice are to face good college teams in the very periods are hard and are aimed at eventual victory. However, a college team cannot be expected to respond and function wholelwart- edly if the entire student body does not thmw their energ-ies, for victory, in with the team's. During the last season, the general atti- tude was not one of laxity, it is true-but it could have been much better. Not everyone attended even the home games, a11d this showed a definite lac]{ of school spirit on their part. As for the intra-murals a wholesome atti- tude has been displayed towards them. The bowling and the swimming- tournaments Pave been centers of vital and lively intetest; others such as the volleyball tournaments have yet to start-let us make them even more prominent in our extra-curricular sports activities. The Navy men's program is at the mo- ment, a very rigorous one, and time is at a premium-there is no doubt of that, but we can certainly g-ive just a little more time to sports interest if it means the diffe1·ence or the swinging of the balance from defeat to victory. Everyone on campus wants to par- ticipate wholeheartedly in these activities, if not as an actual participant then as a lively bystander. However, in many case.s it is just a problem of ine1·tia-of not having that in- itial 1 'get-up-and-go\. This editorial is a plea directed at just such men-the teams and the scheduled in- tra-murals programs need your help and in- terest now! FRIDAY, APRIL 20. 1945 The C. .... .............. .

April24 Champions of the tank are mak- ing headlines this week as Mel Hein's well-managed intramural swimming meet is rapidly drawi·ng to a close. On next Tuesday the final secrets will be out as individ- ual winners ·bring home their point-free bacon. The first of the laurels were tosE>- ed abol t one week ago last night when the mermen held their breath and swam for distance in .typical U-boat style. Winners, their pla- toons, and distances covered arc listed bel ow: Schmey, B-1 ............ 225 feet Highland, C-3 ........... 210 feet Fox, B-1 .. _ . . . . . . . 190 feet Hobsan, B-1 ............. 174.5 feet Schmey, the \ironman\ was carrying the odds before the ra.ce and completed three full lengths of the tank before surfacing. Art Highland was fifteen feet from the bulkhead in the shallow end when he came up for air. He seemed to falter and without hesitation Andy Shriver, fully clothed in khakis, dove in to make the rescue amidst admiring cries of \Our Hero!\ As- sisted by Bob Fox, Art got on dry land only to quiz perplexedly, \Whasa rnatteJ•%\ Of Interest is the relative times the swimmers were under water. Schmey made his three t·rips in the astonishing time of 47 second. Highland was under water for a total of 73 sec- onds. In view of the fact that Art is an established runner, it is feas- ible that he can hold his breath for this length of time, but the physi- cal exertion accompanying it con- tinues to mystify even the on- lookers. Following is a list dividing the honors in the 50-yard back stroke: Jensen 1st tor C-2, Dalton 2nd for B-1, Brownell 3rd for B-2, and Bill 4th for C-2. First in the 50-yard side stroke was Baker .for B-2. Following him were Dersch for C-2, Tuttle for B-1, and Closson for A-2. Last night winners were sched- Lled to place in two events, the 50- yard breast stroke and the 100-yard free style. The meet will be brought to a close next Tuesday when the 200-yard medley relay is decided. Platoons are aheady spec- ulating on an extra liberty by gar- nering the highest number of inte- gers in their finals scor·e. The aforementioned extra liberty, how- ever, still lies well within the con- fines of scuttlebutt.

BOTILED UNDER AUTHORITY OF THE COCA·COLA COMPAN'I' BY THE SCHENECTADY COCA COLA BOTTLING CO. --------~--------~------~---------------------------- The Sportlight JACK O'BRIEN Garnet Sports In the course of its travels the 3porUight has reached South Col- lege to interview Jack O'Brien the mighty mite of the Dutchman footbaJ'l squad during the 1944 sea- son. Forfeits Dissatisfy Hein; Volley Ball Schedule Here Born in Brooklyn \Spic as he is ca:lled by his friends, moved when he was six years old to Great Neck, Long Island where he still makes his home. After graduating from g1•ammar school in that community he entered Gr·eat Neck High School in the fall of 1938. O'Brien waited two years before engaging in varsity sports but in the fall af his junior year he started out upon what was to ·be a great athletic career in the Long Island School. Spic played left halfback for two years on the football team. A very fast and shifty runner, O'Brien was a hard man to bring down In an open .field. He also played basket- ball ad baseball for two years. In the diamond sport he was a second baseman and a consistent hitter averaging .340 for the two year period. With the initial volley ballq>- matches campleted and the entry deadline for the ping\pong tourna- ment scheduled to •be Monday, April lards received a forfeit over the Gulls. The civilian Federal League's power was displayed by the Orioles who trounced the Raiders by 15-7 and 15-2. Howecer, the Raiders made a comeback in edging out the Gunners in a closely played match by 15-11 and 15-8. The Buccaneers were handed a forfeited win over the Owls when the latter team fail- ed to make the appearance at the scheduled time. Spic relates that his greatest thrill in sports came while playing in the first of his two year basket- ba:ll stretch with the Great Neck quintet. In an extremely close and exciting contest against Manhasset High the game ended in a tie. In the ensc ing overtime period Spic put on a one man scoring spree looping eight points through the hoop enabling Great Neck to win 42-34. O'Brien's sports career was almost cut short in the spring of 1942 when he was hit by a pitched ball in a game against Roslyn High. Although his cheekbone was smashed Jack with his character- istic gameness stuck in the fray. A few moments later he crash- ed into the opposing catcher break- ing that youth's arm while try- ing to score from second and was removed from the game. That night O'Brien was operated on for the head injury and had to give up sports for a year. In the fall of 1942 Jack entered Clarkson Tech at Potsdam. Upon entering the Navy V-12 pro- 23, Director Mel Hein has his intra- mural program well under way. Although he is pleased with most of the games which have thus far been hotly contested, Director Hein is dissatisfied with the number of forfeited matches. To date, four of the 11 matches scheduled have been forfeited. Since the cause of this lack of representation is thought to be the large number of teams en- rolled, Mel has decided that each ship or dormitory will be represent- ed by only one team when the soft- ball league begin at the close of the volley ball schedule. The most exciting volley ball match played this week was in the V-12 Eastern League when the Eagles, after losing the first game to the Storks by the scare of 11-15, came from behind with flying col- ors to take the last two games by 15-12 and 15-7 and thereby to win the match. The other match in the Eastern Lea!:!'ue was a win for the Teals over the Albatross by a for- feit. In the V-12 American League, the Senators handled the Sooners diplomatically in winning by 15-9 and 15-7 while· the Forty-Niners proved to be quite agile in trim- ming the Red Skins in successive games by 15-7 and 15-6. In a sec- ond contest, the Senators evened up their win and loss record by forfeiting to the Buffaloes. Upholding its team's name, the Rough Riders rode over the Mud Hens in the decisive scores of 15-4 and 15-5. These same Rough Riders, however, were thrown from their horses when attacked by the Hawks with the \birdmen\ being victorious by 15-12 and 15-8. In the league's other· scheduled match, the Mal- gram he was transferred to Union B-2 Blazers to the college basket- in July 1943.

Union will take on the following teams for two games each-one of which will be at home and one away: Colt:mbia University, RPI, Wesleyan College, University of Rochester, and Trinity College. RESEARCH AND ENGINEERING KEEP GENERAL ELECTRIC YEARS AHEAD b n· WIZARD If you had a G-E differential an- alyzer in your room, you could get your calculus homework done and still make that nine o'clock movie. You might even get rid of all those back assignments that have been pil- ing up. In only a few days the analyzer can solve problems that may take years to work by conven- tional methods. Working with differential equa- tions, this machine can perform as many as fourteen simultaneous inte- grations. There are four input tables and two output tables. As the vari- abies in the equation are being solved, the shafts rotate, moving pens which in turn plot accurate curves. And you've got a graphic solution of your problem. The analyzer may never actually help you with your homework. It's too big and complicated. But it does help G-E engineers in solving many problems-radio, hydro-dy- namic flow, airplane stress, speed governors. The answers have im- portant applications in war work.

A Glimpse Into the Future? ,. Ca~m'Pus Consensus For $4.80 Price Franz B. Andreen, Commanding Officer ·Of the V-12 Unit at Union presented in the weekly chapel service of Wednesday, April 25, his views .on the passing parade of American response and participa- tion iR events of world consequence. \There a1ce two major forces. whiC'h during the l'ourse of history have been the implementing factors. either to improve or retard the gen- eral wel:fare of human beings. I refer to the force inherent In the process of education and in the use of armed might. \We think of the process of edu-' cation as a force for good. But, if wrongly used, it can be a force. for evil. Remember that the growth of Nazism and Fascism were both implemented by a tremendous edu- cational program. The most fan- atical Nazis in Germany are the· young men and women who have been subjected to Hitler's educa- tional process. Emperor worship in Japan is the result of a perverse educational process. \When we witness the destruc- tion in wake of war it is easy to think of the fierce of arms as a force for evil. Yet, abundant his- torical evidence can be cited to sup- port the argument that often only by the waging of war have conclusions for the good of mankind been reached. \The accomplishment of America in organizing its man and material forces of war and in using that force to bring the day of Victory closer has its inherent root in the force of education exemplified in the thousands of institutions simi- lar to Union College which are scat- tered throughout our fair land. Union College Heritage \Union College has a great herit- age in its past service in helping to build these United States. Its very name has a connotation con- necting it with the Union of States when this nation was an infant republic. These men, in the name of \Union\ established an institu- tion of learning to amalgamate their differences in training young men for service in the union of states. Union College's contribu- tion in realizing this vision of its founders has been great. Dr. Wal- dron had me read a little book, \Union College the Maker of Men\ . . . This book \establishes Union College in the front rank among institutions of learning which have contributed intellectual power to the nation. Among its more than 10,000 graduates are numb~red ~in­ isters, statesmen, financiers, JUr- ists, medical doctors, educators, scientists and others who have left a profound imprint upon the char- acter of this nation. \This task for those of you who are associated with and an integral part of Union College should be a challenge to your imaginations and adventuresome to your efforts. May. you acquit yourselves as strong men in this task so that you can in the future, when Union's contribution is evaluated from t~e milestone of this eventful year m its history, say with pride: \I was there when Union celebrated its sesquicentennial year!\ ----0 Bibber, Boring Talk af New York Prof. Harold w. Bibber, ch~irman of the division of engineermg at Union College, and Mr. M. ~· Bor- ing, technical employ~ent director of the General ElectriC Compa~y, were two of .a panel of fom: Which last night in New Ym:k. City ~Is­ cussed the kind of trammg whwh industry will require for future electrical engineering. Following the brief talks by the members of the panel a discussion was held to explore the ways in which the en- gineering college may mee~ these needs with increased effectiveness. The conference was sponsored by the New York section of the Ame~­ ican Institute of Electrical Engi- neers. Loss Mourned by A:U Faiths; Civic 1Uinded; Union's G1·eat F1·iend The Rt. Rev. Msgr. John Liguori Reilly, pastor of the Church of St. John the Evangelist and dean of all clergy, both Catholic and Protes- tant, of this urea, died quietly Thursday morning, April 26, in the rectory of the church. The monsig- nor was 91 years old and would have observed his 92nd birthday on May 25. Msgr. Reilly was the oldest active p1·icst in the country, though he ranked second in point of service by a few months. Hempton and Committee Plan Varied Pro9ram for Much Desired Weekend Up until his death, he took an active interest in community af- fairs and was respected by all the Schenectady citizens, whom he served through connection with vir- tually eve1·y civic and patriotic en- deavor. He had celebrated Sunday mass regularly up until his death. The purpose of the current United Community and War Chest Campaign is to mise funds fm• tlu·ee sig·nificant purposes. The principal po1·tion of the fund will be assigned to welfare agencies in Schenectady. Among the many participants are included Catholic charities, the Jewish community center, the association for the blind, the Y. M. C. A., the city mission, and the boys' club. A second portion Results of the student vote on the price of tickets for t.he Star- light Soiree which is to be held on the Prom V'l'eekend of June 2nd indicate that the majority of the Navy and civilian men questioned would be willing to attend at the $4.80 figme.

OUR LAST 1 'PROM GRIPE'' Buffet SuppE'r served at the USO Club, 1700 to 1930. Movies at 1930 will be \Texas Rangers\ and a short subject. Last week the battle was climaxed by a ballot which was intended to reflect the in- terests of the entire student body. The re- sults of this poll were inconclusive becausP of the small nmnbet• of returns. Of the bAllots returned, fifteen voted for the \name band\ proposition and twelve voted for the \\Yeek- end\ affair. This is to be the last editorial-the last stcmd-on this topic of the Starlight Soiree. 'Phe Concordy must no\\' explain itself, and its stand. The ballot which appeared in last week's issue was poorly worded and vague. Now let us be logical and eunsider what this prmn could be, if the committee really wants to do a little work. Some members of the committee have ap- pnmched us and asked if \H! realized what a \weekend'' would cost the committee. ]:<~rankly, no, \\'e do not realize what a \week- end\ wouid cost. H is ir.conceivable to us that a weekend would cost the committee one cent beyond the formal dance on Satur- day. \\'ould it cost any mole to open the fra- ternity houses for l \\'O nights rathe1· i han the normal one'? );o! \\'ould it cost any more to .supply sheets and pollm-,· cases fo1· t\\'o nights instead of one'! :\\ol \\'ould the pl·o- posed play to be held on Friday night present u.ny cost to the committee; );o: not if use is made of the props and materials of the old :\lountebanks societ~· and the :\lohawk Drama g-roup. \\'ould there l.Je any cost to obtain \canned\ music and machines for the infor- mal dances on Friday night'? ~o: there are plenty of records and phonograph machines llll campus to provide the music. t:CRS might even be induced to pipe the music into the houses as an indication of their COOPERA- TIVE tendencies. A \weeliend\ wiil cost the comniittee more American dollars? How? It is also inconceivable to us that a formal dance should be held at Union College with· out an orchestra of national standing. \\'e can see no reason for not making this formal one of the most important afl'ait·s of the sodal season by combining a weekend with a big dance. Let us now proceed to facts and figures. lf the prom committee could be assured of an attendance of one hundred couple~:~, which seems to us an ausolute minimum in view of the interest and the recot·ds of past proms, we believe the following would occur. Let us assume tha.t each man would be will- ing to pa~· ~fi.:>O admittance to the Starlight Soiree. This price is an avel'age price paid for the last few proms. If one hundred men attended at this cost, and the committee.· combined this revenue with the appropria- tions from the college and the Navy, they would have the sum of $1,000 with \\'hich to produce the Starlight Soiree. With some conscientious work on the part of the deco- rating committee, the gym could be satisfac- • torily adomed for some $40 to $50. This would mean that the plan of decoration would be undertaken b;y the committee, and the actual work as well. This price is quoted • from the record of the Gridiron B1tll at which Jack Teagarden played. Othe1· incidentals such as J'lowers, printing, etc., would not· bring the cost above $100. H such action were taken, a band in the ::;sou to S900 class could be acquired. Such f.\) F.SQUIRF., INC., lO·Ij Reprinted from the May issue of Esquire \Father!

Powerful Rus- sian fot·ces are already battering into the German capital and the complete destl·uc- tion of the city is imminent. Hitler, with pleading voice, has asked the German army to institute n program of infiltration o1· guenilla tactics, while the vision of hi~ in- evitable end floats horribly before his eyes. The black darkness of defeat is settling J\ap- idly on a flaming Germany. Are we to imagine falsely that because our armed might and the armies of Russia are both succeeding so well on the Eastern and the \\'estern fronts against the \Yehr- macht-that the war is over and the time for celebration is near. They have not sur- rendered: they will fight lill:e the mad dogs they are until their very end, if only to create a myth of heroism and martyrdom for future German generations. Many years ago Hitler promised that if World War II was lost by the Ge1·man \master race\ a holocaust, a deluge of de- struction and vengeance would fall upon the western world like a lightning bolt. Have we remembered this; are we vigilant; do our everyday tasks and obligations mean enough to us? What may seem to you to be simple acts, such as the continuous purchase of war bonds and the donation of blood to the Red Cross, are actually of the greatest im- portance insofar as they represent the atti- tude and the general feeling of the American public towards the war effort, besides the obvious values of these practices. members of the Schubert Club as guest artists.
