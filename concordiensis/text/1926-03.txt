''Mike O'Neil carried off the scoring honors in the first half with a total of eight points while Makofski tallied seven and Ripton netted three field baskets. The scoring for the Hoboken aggregation consisted of counters from the floor by Aschoff, forward, and Kerr, a substitute, and four foul shots contributed by Asch- off and Captain Rainer. Hopelessly ,)tJtclassed, the Stevens basketeers made an abortive attempt to stem the l'nion rush but the half ended with the Garnet ahead by a 22 to 8 count. Coach Hardman sent in his regular combination for ·the second period, during which the Garnet representa- tives replaced the horse-play by an earnest attempt to pile up a formid- able lead. \Benny\ Ripton came through for four tosses from the boards while \Sig\ Makofsld sent three baskets through the rim. Two free throws tic;d him with Ripton for high scorer of the contest, each man accounting for 14 points. O'Neil shot vaux.

'world's first super-power transmitter The World's Loudest Voice On the rolli.ng plains cf South Schenectady, in several scattered buildings, is a vast laboratory for studying radio broadcasting problems. Gathered here are many kinds and sizes of transmitters, from the short-wave and low-power sets to the giant super-power unit with a SO- to 250-kilowatt voice . Super-power and simultaneous broadcasting on several wave lengths from the same station are c.mong the startling later-day developments in radio. And even with hundreds of broadcasting stations daily on the air throughout the land, these btest developments stand for still better service to millions of listeners. Only five years old, yet radio broadcasting has developed from a laboratory experiment into a mighty industry. And alert, keen young men have reaped the rewards. But history repeats itself. Other electrical develop- ments will continue to appear . .And it will be the college man, with broad vision and trained mind, who will be ready to serove and succeed.

But your job has to fit your head as well as your · hat, for it has to fit your state of mind. Like your hat also, your job needs to fit your purse. Therefore, why not choose one that brings not only satisfaction in service but in financial return. Selling life insurance is one of the few modern busi~ nesses that does just this. It takes: Intelligence, Zest and Ability It gives: Liberty of action, the ,. philosophic satisfaction of selling future security and present serenity to living people, and a response, im- mediate and tangible, in monetary as well as mental reward.

His awe at New York's \giant skyscrapers\ seem& even to have surpassed the wond.erwhich most Europeans feel when they :first gaze upon that sky- line .. e'But,\ he continues, \the elec- tric iift made the skyscraper a fact.\ In these words he has expressed very tersely a truth which many of us have come to take for granted. Nothing could be more fantastic than the sight of those mighty tow- ers climbing u.p through the many- colored mists of the great city; noth- ing could be more dream-like. And yet, nothing could be more useless were it not for the thousands of Otis Elevators whioh are busi.l'y plying within those high walls. The skill of architects a;nd engi- neers has created a vision, a mirage wilder than any of the ••doud-capt towers\ of fancy. But the Otis Ele- vator has made the skyscraper a fact. There are over 17,000 Otis Elevators operating inN ew York City, ranging fronl. the lowly hand-power elevator to the 800 ft. speed automatic signal control elevator for intensive office building service. All elevators in New York carry mote passengers per day than the combined subway, ele-vated and surface car lines, amounting to ten million people per day. 0 T I S ELEVATOR COMPANY Offices,in all Principal Cities of the World
