What if tbe American does not exhibit his emo- tional re-action . with boisterous. demonstrations? Is such conduct •. lil.dicative of lack of feeling? Ob- viously not. If S'Qch is truly the case, the burden of proof rests with the European, which. thus far he has failed to establish conclusively. Union welcomed more than two hundred musical guests 'Sunday afternoon. And those people Who, for that very brief hour, deserted the problems and tribulations of.· this squali<;l world, embarked upon a musical journey with Pr()fessor Tidmarsh and Mr. Tr-<>mbini through an incomparable Bach pro- .gram, commencing with \Passacag- lia and Tug.ue in C Minor\ reaching an awe-inspiring and magnificent destination with Bach's famous Toccata and Tugue in D Minor.\ To talk about Bach's inventive genius, or the intangible greatness of his work is futile and today banal. Critics have favorably com- pared him with Shakespeare, Mich- ael Angelo, and Martin Luther, contending that what the flrst did for literature, the second for art, and the last for the Bible, Bach. did for music. His own .na.me, Bach, is translated brook, and Beethoven in an lnspir.ed moment when testing the immortal nectar and ambrosia of his fellow artist's compositions, to which hi.s own genius made him accessible, cried o.ut with exaltation \He is no brook; he is the open sea.\ But all comparisons and ex- planations, however meti.culous, can never reveal Bach or his mu- sic; because Bach is Bach, and his music, his music·; and to under- stand Bach one must feel his music. Any attempt to am8.Iyze either de- stroys both. Sllakespeare had his Marlowe; Michael Angelo, his models; and Luther his Lollards. But Bach scarcely had any one to illume his extending vistas. Even Beethoven's admirable observation is not entir.e~ ly C<>rrect. A brook or sea may as- sume stater characteristics, but Bach's music :filters like magic deeper and deeper into the human soul, until the. soul exhausted can absorb it no longer, but bursting its fleshy shackles uses and floats into a kingdom all its own. Bach's rhythmical vitality in his fingers, swelling and culmin<ating into mighty crescendoes, animated and shook the chapel until it, too, ap- peared to move with vehement in- spiration and intense rapture. -~-.o--____, SQPHOMORE NOTICE Sophomores who wish to become candidates for the position of as- Sistant manager of swimming are asked to report some time this :Week to Duane Cri~hton at the Beta Theta Pi house or to Lawrence Withington at the Chi Psi lodge. · Phone 4-6303.

It is hoped that the present student body will revive this traditional method of stirring school-spirit up to maximum sup- port of its teams. This year, there seems to be more reason tbmt ever why the students should tlirn out \en-masse\ and show the football team their appreciation of the ef- forts of the individual men, work- ing together as a body, to bring victory to \Old Union.\ Fighting Spirit Each student knows how the team began their· season by losing the first two games of the schedule to Vermont and Columbia.

It is that fighting spirit and cour- age which has caused the student body to feel ashamed of its mo- mentary lack of support and made them turn out in full spirit for the team. It should be that same ad- mirable courage of the f-ootball team which should make the stu- en t body turn out tonight and how the team that they have their ·ntire and full-hearted backing. .~.'he student body should do their Jhare in helping to beat Rochester .omorrow, by coming down to the .l.

Sim THE CONCORDIENSIS, FRIDAY, NOVElVIBER 6, 1931 Zabuesnic Depicts Temple of Angkor D-Cady Herrick Translates Original Manuscript Mr. Zabuesnic gave a talk on the 'Temple of Angkor before the French club last Tuesday evening. The tan~, which was delivered in French, was of g1•eat interest to both the student of l!'rench and the student of Architectu11e. by building roads to tb,e very gates of the old pile. The history of this old .temple fills volumes, because it was the ·center of ancient Oriental art and archeology. Present-day Europe and America have only recen:tly dis- covered the vast treasu1•es that Angkor has stored for centuries. Ever since the niQth century the :building has been added to and enriched by the variol:ls kings who have wished to make eternal traces of their wealth and to leave .some testimony of the power aitd cultiva- tion of their empires. The sio,ry of Angkor resembles that of the Pvra- m.ids and the temples of .Ancient G1·eece and Persia. Opposite the Temple of Angkor has been constructed a . ,bungalow, marking the apogee of Khmer c!as- \\ sic art. This was built in the . twelfth century and dedicated to the cult of Vishnou. In this little building are found sculptured the epic poems of India; besides this the perfection of the plan, the harmony of the l:)ui:lding make visitors carry .away with them a picture that may be favorably compared with the most pretentious buildings of Louis xrv. The history and the beauty that are Angkor'~ have been faithfully repmduced in the Parisian model that the Indo-Chino government has· erected. Today it is possible to enjoy the beauty of ancient India. without going 0utside of Paris. SAVE AT THE APEX GROUP T() ATTEND GAl\fE SCHOL~RSHIP TO WERLE, '00 A delegation of football enth:usi-.

PHONE M036 To;t:n Behan BlU Dwyer In his address Mr. Zabuesnic op- ened by saying that the French Colonia'! 'Exposition held in Paris this Ternple was situated in the student of architecture and .sculp- ture, for here are some of the · greatest examples of colonial bUild- ings have been faithfu_lly repro- duced. The most startlmg repr0- duction is found in the exhibition of Indo-China, for here the entire Temple of Angkor has been erected. Mr. Zabuesnic explai:ned that tbe Temple has exerted great influence on the ·occidental imagination as it became attracted by the far East. Years ago when the first explorers visited Indo-China they found that this Ternplel was situated n the midst of an .almost impassable for- est over which its towers projected like the torrents of a lost city. Ang- · kor was indeed a lost city, for tigers, elephants, and wHd deer sought retuge in its midst. Only by great effort could a traveler reach the Temple, for the trip nec- essitated a large caravan because of the ruggedness of the ground and the dangers of the country through which the visitor must· pass. Year after year as the. num-. ber of travelers to Angkor increas- ed the way became easier, until the old pronhey that the Temple should · be restored by foreigners, came true. Today the French School of the Far East has restored much of the former glory of Angkor by re- facing the stones and making the Temple accessible for all travelers. e'd and rather have a Chesterfield College Special Genuine score H 'GRAIN ~ 5 .90 -P Pair LEATHER BY ~k~ GLASGOW t SCOTLAND From the bonny banks of Scotland .• , Glasgow. , • come the genuine Martin Scotch Grain Leathers being used in these shoes ... the finest, softest, most pliable, durable, and beautifully-grain· ed leathers of its kind in aJJ the world.

Frank P. !IJay last Saturday m addressing the , G.raduate Council. He declared the 'substance of a coll'ege educatwn to ! be the inteHectual and moral de- velopment' of the undergr·aduate, 'while the shadows are the extra- , curricular activities .such as ath- . Letics, dramatic and glee clubs, and ·publications. \The world needs great souls to take the place of such men as • Dr. George Alexander, Dr. Frank- Lin H. Giddings and Dr. Olin H. ; Lan~reth, who passed on thia year\ , contmued Dr. Day. \How are we to develop such men if we do not give rnost or our atten- tion to the substance rather than . the shadows of a college educa- tion?\ The following officers were elect- . ad by the Graduate Council: Lud- .ow L. Melius of New York C1ty, president; William J. Smith of Brooklyn, vice-president; l<'reder- •Ck B. Richards of Glens Falls, treasurer; Charles N. Waldron of Detroit, secretary; and D. Richard vVeeks of Auburn, Maine, assistant 3ecretary. . The council appropriated $2,115 from the alumni gift fund for new bleachers on the athletic field, and $7,000 was allocated for scholar- ships, physical improvement or the .campus, and extra-curricular ac- tivities.

A resolution was passed that the college take over the complete con- trol of the athletic depaL·tment as well as the financial management, and that. tuition be used to pay 1ts axpenses as in any other depal't- ment, thus obviating any student cax to support the intercoaegmte program. · The council passed a resolution of condolence in respect to Dr. Olln H.

Wyatt and Sorkin to Face Elmh·a Debatot·s Nov. 19 At a meeting of the Philomath- ean Debating Society held last night in the Old chapel, a very in- teresting debate was held on the topic; Resolved: \That the foreign indictment of• American culture is justified.\ The negative, upheld by Frederick Wyatt, '32, and Reuben Sorkin, '33, gained a 2-1 decision over the affirmative, upheld by Frederick Dommeyer, '32, and Jul- ius Sitney, '34. ·The debate was a practice affair In preparation for the forensic encounter with the El- mira Girls' College team whiGh will come to Schenectady on Novembe1· 19 for a radio debate over the Gen- eral Electric station, WGY. It was announced that the Un- ion team, upholding the negative of the topic, will be composed of the same two men who won the de- bate last night. They will engage in another practice debate on the same topic at next week's meeting, and will be opposed by Dominick Cerritto, '32, and William Couch, '34. A new method of judging the de- bats was inaugurated· last night, when the old system of having three individual . judges cast their ballots and comment on the debate was done away with. Instead the criticism is· deliver:ed by a critic judge who does not vote on the outcome of the debate. The position of critic judge is a permanent ap- pointment, and at present, the posi- tion is he!d by Milton Lifset, '3.2.

EvERYONE knows now that Camels are the fresh (!igarette. If inquiry went deeper, it w~uld reveal that Camels are the natural moisture cigarette. That's important; because in handling fine to· haccos, when you process out natural moisture, you sacrifice freshness and flavor too. Camel smokers needn't worry about that, because Camels are blended of fine Turkish and mild Domestic tobaccos· that are never subjected to violent process• ing. They need no parching·· or toasting to make them smootb, palatable, cool. That's why the Camel Humidor Pack is such a boon to Camel smokers-it preserves the freshness, flavor, natural moisture, fragranc·e that are in this fine ciga· rette to start with. Camels are fresh in nature's own n1ild way, and if you want to see what that means in :unalloyed smoke· enjoJinent, switch to them for just one day- then leave them, if you can! R. J.

But <Continued on P.wge Tihreit) Dr. Rand Delivers Spencer Lecture Harvard Professor Inaugur- ates Twenty-second Yea~f Spencer Foundation \The modern librarian has his troubles, but he would not change places with the medieval librar- ian,\ said Dr. Edward Kennard Rand, professor of Latin at Har- vard university, The lecture, which was entitled \Libraries of the Mid- dle Ages,\ was given in the Old chapel Friday night and inaugur- ated the twenty-second year of the Ichrubod S.pencer Foundation lec- tures. In outlining the histGry and de- velopment of the library of the Middle Ages. Dl'. Rand stated that Cassiadorus, prime minister of the Gothic chieftain. Theodoric, was the first to establish a medieval library. He started by gathering a collect- ion of the classics, and had. the binders assemble the books to fac- ilitate classification. The first li- brary, which was founded in south- ern Italy, was, like most libraries later, in a monastery. The system of training of Cassiadotus was a- dopted by the Benedictine (}l'der, and for that reason has been per- petuated. Physical Aspects of Lib:rarltls Dr. Rand described the Interior and ml!!.llagement of the library of the Middle Ages, and contrasted it with that of the present day. \The library,\ he said, \began as an ad- junct of the chm•ch in the mon- astary. It had few books, and part of thenl. were kept in the church. Where the library was larger the books were kept in a larger room, Sometimes the collection of books Was large enough to permit it to be divided into two rooms known as the outet· and inner rooms. The former contained treatises and books on secula.!\ learning, while the latter contained the wo.rks of the classical authors. Often a. spe- cial library in the church contain\ ed clergical books-, and at times the higher functi<maries of the monastaries had smail libraries. \Just as the· librarian of the pre- sent day, the librarian. of the Mid- dle Ages was responsible -for the books in his library, and hf.l.d to take them down at least twice a year and inspect them to s.ee that they were in good conditio-n.

Fras•er, Jaclt (C{)nfdnlied on Pa;ge Three) League Viewed as Police Power Says Pl'ofessor Shotwell \PubJ.ic opinion of today is not enJ:ightened as regards world af- fairs,\ said Professor James T. Shotwe-ll, head of the history de- partment at Columbia university in the first of the Joseph P. Day lectures which was given last night in the Old chapel. \Because the United States is hypnotized by the fear of the League of Nations as a police power and by disarmament as a solution to world peace, OUl' government at Washington is standing in the way of world peace,\ Dr. Shotwell continued. \We still are using the methods, and are holding the ideas of our forefathers which applied to an isolated America, not to the Amer- ica of today as one of the great nations of the world. Isolation Regime Passed \We need leaders who will strive for clarity and understanding, not passion and emotions and resulting war. Our isolation regime has passed and never can return. The American. people and the govern- ment is apparently unaware that we are not the America of the seventeenth and eighteenth centur- ies, that we have become a nation and that we must join with other nations. to solve the vital problem of world peace.\ Dr. Shotwell proceeded to dis- cuss the history of the United States as a world power, and stated that until 1890 we were a.n isolated agricultural nation with our foreign policy the Monroe Doc- trine. \It was not until recently that the great power and influence of that great doctrine was realized.\ Age a Crucial Oue \The method of solution of an- archy and strife following the World War was the League of Na- tions, and America's contribution to the League was a plea for a world-wide Monroe Doctrine. Fol- lowing our refusal to JOln the League, we turned to other devices including numerical disarmament and the four power pact. The re- sult was to hypnotize. the Amer- ican people with the illusion that disarma.Illent would solve the peace problem and to show ourselves an obstacle to world peace.\ Dut·kee Says Faith Is Most Powet·ful Force In his sermon Sunday morning, in the ;Memorjal chapel, the Rev. J'. Stanley Durkee, of Plymouth Church, Brooklyn, depicted faith as a force more powerful than any mechanical force such as steam or electricity, and capable of accom- plishing anything. The words of Jesus, \All things are possible to him that believeth,\ served as the speaker's text, upon which he de- veloped a definition o.f faith and several illustrations of its infinite powers. In a comparison between the power of belief and the powers which modern physics has dis- covered, Dr. Durkee showed that in dealing with physical forces one must be governed by definite scentiflc laws. Similarly, in deal~ ing with faith one must do so in accordance with the \mechanical laws of the spiritual world.\ \It is possible to move mountains with faith,\ declared Dr. Durkee. \The steam-drills and dynamite are merely the instruments which faith uses in building new structures. Buildings are not erected by steam shovels and riveting machines, but by the faith of the builder in his project.\ Dr, Dw·kee closed his address with a dir.ect bit of advice to the students in the audience. \It is only as you have faith in your- selves. that you, as young men, may attain success,\ he said. \No one is ever defeated until he is de- feated at heart and knows that he is. A man who has not faith is a crippl~, and being crippied spirit- ually is such more to be pitied than a physical cripple.\

Maxon Tuesday, November 24, 1931 ''MORE FREEDOM\ The changes in the absence rules which were announced by President F1·ank P. Day in chapel last we.ek are definite steps forward in the dit·cction of recognizing a. college man's ma- turity and ability to think for bitmelf. This is a specific movement awa:y from the> populat· <·ou- ception that an American cellege is, what 'I' he 1J7orld-Telcgram chooses to eall, \a glorifiPd nut·sery\. Colleges can be conside1·ed \'glorifil'd n urs- eries\ in so far as faculty control of what should be student activities has relieved the av- erage person in college of the necessity of think- ing a thing through for himself. This typ~ of student is one who is content to stand on the sidelines and watch things which affect lti1t1 take the course presaibed by tl1e faculty. Thi~ type of person is one wl10 is not interested in education in itself, but only in acquit·ing tlw \sheepskin\ which after all is nothing ntore than a certificate saying tha.t the student has passed the required number of courses with the necessary grades. Decreasing the gt·ude neeessary fot· excuse from all absence rules is an indication of what the administration of Union College is striving for: an ideal school of learni11g, a place where the student shall ultimately enjoy freedom and with it the imvi table cagernc ss to learn. This broadening of the range will not, as some may suppose, lower the scholastic standing of out· college. On the other ha11d, it will tend to raise it by bringing this promise of freedom nearer to that grade of student who does an average amount of work and obtains a high third grade. However he does not tend to exert all his pos- sible abilities toward procuring an 85 a ret·age because It seems too far away frorn his reach. Now with the new goal brought closer to him, he will tend to become more interested in his THE CONCORDIENSIS, TUESDAY, NOVEl\fBER 24, 1931 TREMBLAY'S 'TERRACE INN Nott Terrace Next to Hi'gh :School Spring ferer twice a year .is a little too' ST A~RTS T:O·D AY • •. m11ch £or eyen the most ~ensihle of us to with-: I ·: sta.nd.

Dr. Rand Delivers Spencer: Led,tures (Continued from Page One) he had to supply the scribes with :parchment, an.d a place for- them to work. He had to be so familiar with the <:ontents of the boo·ks that he could discern any mistake that the abbot might make a.t matins and other services. Among his other duties, he was supposed to compile the monastic almanac, and was often given. the task of taking care of the finances of tlle church. \Books were lent if the borrower could provide sufficient guarantee. The monks were generous, and the libraries suffered in consequence, particulariy at the hands of the students of the University o.f Paris. The reader was directed to handle the books with care. One book, warns, 'Let eacJ1 reader have dry and clean han.dg.' Often directions in these books were put in poetic :l!orm.'' Dr. Rand concluded his lecture· by sh0wing some slides which in- cluded plans of the Medie·val mon- astary, pictures of old reading desks, and parts of the most fa- mous of the medieval libraries. ---10 Ninety-Six Men Win Honor Marl\:s (Continued from Page One) Friedman, Oliver H.

Any one who attends the student-body meet- ings regularly ·discovers that only a handful of· enterprising students mo1,1ld the poli.cies of a meek: and aquiescent Union-student-body. Oc- casionally .some opposition is direct- ed ag·ainst this group, but it is never successful. Never d,uring the last four yea·rs has the student 'Qody been represented by more than one- fourth of its members at the Mon- day chapel meetings. And yet stu- dent body government is spoken of as if it were a reality.

The FFosb Peerade has intro- duced much camment. That most of the student-body was agai·nst it · is an established certainty. But the Terrace Counci1 had good reasons for its stubborn insistance on see-· ing tlJ.e Peerade through. The foot- ball audience had to enjoy the evanescent titillation this Peerade supplied.

What we want are statesmen. No one oan deny the force and truth of Dr. Day's observations. But if we want statesmen we must begin their edu- cation first at Union. Last year a junior became inter- ested in the work of quite an im- · portant oampus.. organization. This· enthusiasm seized him three weeks before the final school~ year was to • end. He put in an appearance in:· the organization and made known· his ambition to become affiliated with it. 'Some seniors, juniors, sophomores, and freshmen had faithfully attended all meetings. throughout the year. Fortunately, · unwittingly, and unbeknowing, to the gentleman who attended one meeting, he was elected president of the organization on his next ap- pearance the following week. In all fairness to him, he was con- gratulated, but to this day some feel his fraternity shouid have been congratulated for on the night of his election a majority of the votes cast in his favor were cast by mem- bers of his fraternity. Another case analogous to this one was decided exactly in the same way, with the exception that the voting took place under more . favorable circumstances. In this case, a meeting was called after the school year had expired, so that a:ny possibility of failure to elect the undeserving man was pre- cluded.
