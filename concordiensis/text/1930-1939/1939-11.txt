Y., FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 3, 1939 New A rom Syste~m Voted: At Stude.nt Council M,eeting All Ca.mpllls Groups To Be Represented On Da·nce Committee A new Juni<H Prom Committee arrangement, whereby all the cam· pus groups wiJ.l be represent~d ~nd an opportunity to have able Jumors managing the Prom wiU be insured, was adopted Wednesday night at a meeting of the Student Council in Old Chapel. Under the new plan, each fra- ternity and each dormitory will choose one junior and the day-stu- ·dents will choose four junior·s to act as the Prom Committee. From these twenty-four juniors, the 0ffi- cers of the .cJass and the president of the student council will choose seven men to act as an executive committee. This executive commit- tee will direct the management of the Prom, while the rest of the committee wi.JJ act as ticket sales- men. An added featut e of the new arrangement provides that for every three tickets a member of the committee sells he will have one dollar deducted from the price of his own ticket. The Student Council voted to go on record as being in favor of a discussion between President Dixon Ryan Fox, Director of Athletics Harold J. Wittner of Union and President William 0. Hotchkhis of R. P. I. to consider whether a change in the relations between the two colleges will grow out of the recent R. P. I. attacks on Union property. Uniform Key Proposal Adopted Acting on the problem of insur- ing a large Union attendance at the Hamilton game in Clinton on November 18, the Council appoint- ed Dudley Holmes a committee of one to encourage such attendance. It was pointed out that students who show evidence of attendance at the game will be excused for ab- sences from third and fourth period classes the day of the game. lJuplicate Text BoGks TG Be Sold at Library DupHcates of text •books on European and American history wHl be placed on sale at the Li- brary tomorHrw morning at 9 o'clock accord.j.ng to Helmer Webb, College Librarian.

Beck S~pea~ks At tuncbeon Meeting C·oncluding Two-Day Conference Doriot and McGolderick Address Group On Last Day of Campus Sessions Of Second Industry and Goyernment Meeting Union College's second annual two day \Conference on In·· dustl·y and Government\ was concluded with yesterday's luncheon meeting in Hale House at which the Hon. Oswald D. Heck, speakee of the New York State Assembly and an alumnus of Union Col'lege, addressed delegates numbering close to one hundred on \The Tendency Toward Increased Regulation of Business and Industry.\ College Carillon to Tell Of Victory or Defeat Through tl:e coopet·ation of the Concordiensis and Chester Robinson, '·10, official college clanger, students who at·e forced to remain behind When the train pulls out for Williamstown to- morrow will know the results of the game 1 at least whether the outcome is favorable to Union men or not) almost as soon as the last whistle has been blown on Weston Field. The Concordiends has ar- ranged to telephone the result of the game upon its conclusion to Schenectady and Robinson will inform all shut-ins of the out- come by means of the car ilion. Should the Garnet be victorious tomorrow afternoon in the land of the Purple and Black, naught but the Marching and other col- lege songs shall peel ir·om be- hind the Chapel clock. However, should Williams take the honors on the morrow, Robinson a:;- sures us that such a dirge as has never before ·been sounded will ring over the Union campus, r e· minding all of the woe that has befallen the Dutchmen in ·battle. Yearbook Out by Prom Editor Crosby Promises Explaining that the printing and engraving contracts for the Garnet had been awarded this week, Harry L. Crosby, '40, announced that this year, contrary to other years, The Garnet wlll be in the hands of the students by Junior Prom time. This year for the fi.rst time it Among the prominent speakers at the conference which began Wednesday were the Hon. Joseph D. McGoldrick, comptroller of the City of New York; W. Gibson Carey, Union alumnus and trus- tee who is president of the United States Chamber of Commerce; George F. Doriot, professor of in- dustrial management at the Har- vard Graduate School of Business Administration; Ewan Clague, d·i- rector of the bureau of research and statistics of the Social Se- curity 'Board in Washington; and Milton 0. Loysen, New York State executive director of the division of placement and unemployment insurance. \With the rise in importance of problems of social control, business and industry will in the future not be Jess regulated but gradually, step by step, will be more regulat- ed,\ asserted Mr. Heck. He con- tended that until 10 years ago the American public had' asserted un- bounded faith in the structure of business, but that with the crisis of October, 1929, the supposedly soutvl structure began to crumble and was hastened to its downfall by un- precedented reform regulation passed by Congress, thereby losing the faith and confidence of tr.<! public. It was the speaker's opin- ion that these regulations went fat' beyond the natural tendency to re- strict and control that would oth- erwise have prevailed: in normnl times. McGoldrick Speaks at Forum \In 1937 began a lightning-like reversal of the public attitude,\ CC'ntinued Mr. Heck, who cited as examples the American Institute of Public Opinion. \Dissatisfac- tion was generally expressed with msny of the restrictions, especially with that of the excess profits tax,\ he said·. The proposal to adopt a system of uniform award keys for Union activities was adopted. The keys will have insets to distinguish the particular activity of the owner The prices and exact designs for all the keys will be reported at a later meeting. Lawrence Pellettier was named a committee o: one •o investigate the question of a Fathers' Day at Union College. Although the coun- cil favored the day of a home foot· ball game as the best ti!lle to hold such an event, it was decided tc try to hold the fir::t in the serim next spring, with the annual events to be planned for the f!lll after this year. The question of a ::;pecific day to honor the father' of Union students grew out of ar editorial in a recent Concordiensi~ and subsequent approbation by tht student body. The meetings are held under the joint auspices of the college and of the Schenectady Forum Service. This year, the meetings are to be held from 3:15 to 4 instead of from 3 to 4 as last year. They will be broadcast over WGY from 3:15 to 3:45. Tickets may be obtained in the book store, the barber shop, and l't om members of the committee. The committee includes George Miller, Foster Brown, Robert Han- son, John Cone, William Witbeck 3nd David Hayner. In his conclusion, Dr. Jewett ex- pressed gratification in the way the public has responded to the improvement in telephone service, the increased number of calls, making economically possible the further improvement and expan- sion of this industry. \This public reaction is equally as important as the behavior of electrons in vacuum tube,\ Dr. Jewett said. Kelly Confesses Culpability in Cancellation of Condemnation Campus Capers; Commendable a was found necessary to place a con· tract for ·PI inting outside the Cap- itol district Crosby explained. The printing will be done by Country Life Pre~s. Incorporated In Gat·den City, New York. The engraving contract has again been placed with Jahn and Oilier in Chicago. \It seems apparent today that a definite conclusion of . . . these public opinion polls is that busi- ness and industry are returning to popular favor and that the ex- treme kind of reform has fallen from the peak of popularity. In other words, the trend is toward conservatism,\ he concluded. ~------------------------------------------------ Pres·ident Louis J.

Nice picking, Tom- Fabian Theaters The (;arnet team which meets Williams tomonow will be one which is firmly con- vinced that the Pmple jinx over Cnion can be broken. The Dutchmen are not losing sig-ht of the fact that Williams held Prince- ton on even terms for three periods, nor are they forg·etting that while the Eph squad bowed to :\Iiddlebury and Tufts it outrushed both of these teams. The L'nion team real- izes that it is to be pitted ag-ainst a line which averages 16 pounds heavier per man than its own forward wall. Despite these obstacles, however, the Dutchmen are convinced that the Purple squad can be beaten by an inspired Union team, and they have little doubt that they will be that inspired team tomorrow after- noon. The memory of the brilliant 30-21 up- set which the '34 team scored over the Eph- men has not entirely been forgotten by the present band of Dutchmen. Union has beaten strong Williams teams before, and the Gamet squad is determined that the bells in ::\Iemorial Chapel will ring out in celebratfun of a Union victory tomol'· row afternoon.

This the 34th game with WiHiams in the 52 :vear old grid series, in which Union stands the loser having ~von only five games to Williams' 24. The remaining four games were ties. The Union team has ,been \•ork-~--------------~­ ing hard this. week in an effort to I v • H o bliild up their pass defense and arslty arrl e rs much emphasis has been put . on . pl:lnting and place.-kicklng. The Meet Swarthmore f,ve men llne whtch worked so well against R. P. I. is expected to stop Williams' running attack. T.his week ther·e has only 'been one scrJm- mage-·on Wednesdays Because of rain Tuesday, the team stayed in- doors and had signal practice. The Union starting line up will be the same as last week, with Bothwell and Guibert at ends; tackles, Wally Baker and Augy Kluge; guarus, Dick Kearns. and John KtuH; center, Bob Baker. The backfield will find Dick Balch at qua~ter; Jack Vannier at left half; Oeorge Norris at right half and Captain Sam Hammerstrom at full- back. The whole team is in good shape according to Coach Nitch\ man. However, Balch'.s shoulder is not quite as good as it could be and he has been resting it all week. 'The Toughest' Seven members of the Union varsity cross country team left for Swarthmore College this morning at 8:30 p. m. to try to annex the second win of the season. Co-captains Paul Santoro and Frank Melewicz are likely to be the Union 1 and 2 men. Bill John- son will run in the third spot fol- lowed by \Doc\ Maines, Don Col- lins, Dick Conly, Jack Pearson and Gale Hoffman. During time trials held this week, Paul Santoro ran the three-mile course in 14:59, the first time. ac- cording to Coach Ketz, that any Union runner· to his knowledge has ever run three miles in less than 15 minutes. \The team is steadily improving,\ said Ketz, \and on the whole I think we have a good chance to win if the men running fourth and fifth can pull up a bit stronger.\ When queried on the outcome of the game, Nels Nitchman said: \This will be the toughest game of the year; they're laying tor us.' The Coach also said that he was putting more emphasis on thii: game than any of the two others that are to come, Rochester and Hamilton, Williams has a lot stronger team than their season's record would indicate, Hamilton was beaten by the Purple team, 20 to 6. Against Middlebury the Williams team was master of the field most of the game, but on a \break\ the Middle- bury team came through with a victory. Against Princeton, Wil- liams was the far better team on the ground and trailed only 13 to 6 when the Tigers started throw- ing passes, and scored two touch- downs more, to win 26 to 6. The total first downs at the close of the game was twelve for Princeton and nine for Williams. Tufts was vastly outplayed, but still won over the favored Williams team, 14 to 12. Williams put up a strong fight to tie 0-0 with the powerful Bowdoin team which was undefeated up to that time. Union so far has not had a very . successful season losing to Ver- mont, New York University and R. P. I. and winning over Middle- bury. Swarthmore is believed to have a fairly strong team since they showed up well in a triangu- lar meet in competition with La- fayette and Lehigh. The Williams line up is not cer- tain, but the team that started against Tufts is expected to start Saturday. That is composed of Hearne and Wood, ends: Frost and Brool{S, tackles; Head and Herguth, guatds; McCarthy, center. The backfield is made up of McCann, left half; Fisher, quarterback; Morgan, right half; Holden, full- bacl,. Three good men that may start are Batten, Daly and Meehan, a!l sophomores, in the backfieltl. These men although not used much, will be s'erious threats to a Union vic- tor>·· Daly is a very good backer- up and Meehan has shown up as one of the most capable players on the team. Captain Sam Hammerstrom has averaged 122 yards a game in the five games played this season. He also holds third place in the East for scoring, having tallied 45 points. Proving conclusively that he is a triple threat, Hammerstrom has punted 15 times in four games with an average of 32 yards per try. These figures are exclusive of the Haverfo1·d game for which there are no statistics available. His passing has also been very good. Out of 19 trie.s, 10 have been com- pleted for a total of 130 yards. ' Captain Pete McCarthy of the Purple team was down with a bad leg for the Hamilton game two weeks ago, but last week he was in uniform for the Tufts game. One of the most valuable Williams men, George Duncan, broke his leg in practice just before the Tufts game. This is a serious handicap because Duncan was one of the few remaining letter men in the line. The Dutchmen and the Purple are fairly evenly matched althoUgh Union holds a slight e,dge. The team will leave about 10 o'clock tomor- row morning for Williamstown. Coach Nitchman will take every man on: the squad with him. Those who will not travel with the vars- ity will go on the bus reserved for the freshmen. ------0------ Freshmen Tilt With Williams Tomorrow The Freshman football team wlll ;Jlay one of the hardest contests of its season Saturday when it meets the Williams freshmen. The team has lost every game so far and the Purple Cubs are by far the stronger team. Two weeks ago the Williams men beat R. P. I. 43 to 0 in an easy victory. Last week the frosh held R. P. I. down to one touchdown and a conversion. Union lost when the try for point after the lone touch down failed. Coach Lawrence remained non- committal when asked for his opin- :on on the outcome of the tilt. The line-up for the game will be the same as it has been with the ex- ~eption of two changes, Paul Sar.- :ee at left end, and Dick Hoffman at left tackle. Last weeli Sante~ was hit in the head causing a slight concussion; he is, however in con- dition this week. Hoffman, a sub- 3titute last Saturday, made a bril- liant .showing when he recovereJ l fumble made by R. P. I. The Williams Cubs have very good raw material according to the Williams Record and in the last four weeks have learned an entire- ly new system. The Purple yearl- ing's coaching staff have promised \a better brand of football.\ The team w.ill leave at 10 o'clock, the same time as the varsity and the game will begin at twelve. ------0,------ NOTICE All students interested in form- ing a chess club and an intercol- legiate chess team are requested to leave their names with Dr. Stub- ing of the Modern Language Divi- sion, Robert Davison at the Phi Sigma Kappa House or Maurice Duel at the Kappa Nu House.

TANNER \Gee we didn't do so well this year. Our Alumni weren't on the ball with their scholarships and it looks as though we may have a pr·ctty sour sea~on ·on the gridiron. We've still got a few of the old se!oolar~hip men back but last y~ar's batch weren't so bright. Ten of the twelve fl unkFd out.\ Such is the talk that t·evolves around subsidized college football these Jay~. Col.Jege football has resolved itself into a commercial ex- ploitation that lmows no bounds. Broadcasting rights, advertising rights, enormous gate receipts, and many other angles have turned a once amateur game into nothing more than a money-making business. But in the middle of it an, a few colleges havE> retained their ama- teur standing and among these Union College is pwud to be numbpred. It has become a t1 easured tradition at Union that om· athletes are not fighting their hearts. out for the oltl \hard cash,\ but are playing the game because they like it and want to play. Union College is not best known for its athletic field accomplish- ments, as are many other colleges. The college has often been criti- cized because of the poor showing made by the Dutchmen in some sports. But an examination of th<e records will show that Union College team victories hcver about the .500 marli ovH a fairly extended period and s11ch a record is certainly not one to be criticized. The main reason for the refusal to s11bsidize player~ has lain in the fact that Union College has emphasized \brain~ before brawn\ and is committed to do so in the future. We meet teams in our own class although in sports other than football, the college often goes out of its class to play larger colleges. This has been especially true in bas- ketball when the Dutchmen have engaged such teams as N.Y.U., Columbia, C. C. N. Y. and Colgate. Last spring, Union College met West Point in track, while Rutgers, Syracuse and Colgate often provide oprositim~ in baseball. But the main tendency on the pat't of Union College's athletic de- partment is to keep within our own class and play teams such as Ham- ilton, R. P. I., Middlebury, Williams, and others. Every so often a hue and cry is raised on the campus asking why we do not buy \just a few athletes.\ The t•eason is clear. Once the practice is started it cannot be stopped easily and grows with each succeeding year. Possibly these few would like to see Union in the position of a certain well-known southern college. In this college each member of the squad is paid $10 outright after the game. If a player starts he gets $20 and for every touchdown be score.s he re- ceives an even larger sum. Or perhaps these people would like to at- tend a college up north here which is very well known for its winter sports. I knew a member of the squad who said that after each game the members of the squad were given their carfare back to the college -only the carfare was four times that which was needed to buy the ticket. The well known \coal belt\ in the Middle Atlantic States has proven rich in man power for some of the powerful teams of that territory. Here they are Jess crude about the subsidization-they give the playe1 s their tuition and board but give them jobs for their spend- ing money. I am sure the dissatisfied ones would have revel!ed in the recent strike by the freshman players of one of these \coal belt\ col!eges be- cause they WEREN'T BEING PAID ENOUGH TO PLAY FOOT- BALL. A truly remat·kable condition of affairs is present when labor problems invade a college supposedly for the pursuit of higher \learn- lng.'' Here at Union we don't experience such things and we are proud of it. We lose game<J but we win just as many. And as far as ALL AMERICAN material this college has proven that amateur athletes can get the recognition. No farther back than 1936 the college boasted an ALL AMERICAN lacrosse player in Jack Smith. This year, Union College has one of the strongest teams that has represented it on the gridiron for many years. But there's more to it than. just being strong. We know that the team which is making history llere is one hundred per cent amateur, plays for the love of the game, and that the players are not going to get a meal ticket or a check when they get off the field.

Game Tomorrow Recalls Semerad, One Man Team Of Five Years Ago When the Garnet meets the Pur-~=---------------------­ ple tomorrow at Williamstown, Union will be seeking its fi.rst vic- tory from Williams since Ralph Semerad ran loose to score· 24 points in the epic contest of 1934. Coming from behind in a long up- hiH f.ight, Union defeated Williams 30-21 by a barrage of pas\e\ and line plunges. Early in the secomi period, Union's hopes dived to a temporary low point when Williams took advantage of a blocked kick and an intercepted pass to score twice. Immed·iately afterwards, however, Union went into action. Afte·r a se1 ies of passes and line bucks, Semerad threw a 30 yard pass to Van Waldron who caught it on the 20 yard line and scored stand~ ing up. Union soon scored again, but failing to malie the conversion trailed by one points. After liick- ing off to Williams, Union took possession of the ball on downs on the 45 yard line. Unable to ad- vance, the Garnet was forced to kick and after a long return of the punt Williams scorpd again on two rever~es and a pass and also kicked the point. After the kickoff, Williams was kept in its own territory for some FOR THE time. Milano suddenly scooped up a WiHiams fumble deep in their tenitory on the 23 yard line. Dain then threw a scoring pass to Sem- erad standing in the end zone, but Union still was behind two points. Union rooters had visions of the Gat·net defeated by two points and went wild when Semcrad, una'ble to gain on the ground or in the air, dropped :back to the Williams 25 yard line and place-kicked a field goal .from a sharp angle, putting Union out in front 21\20 . 8emerad gcit a chance to make another score when the Wil'iiams line opened for a moment and be- hind superb blocking he traveled downfield 54 yards to make the final score in the game. The game as seen by the ordinary spectator must have seemed a one- man affair with Semerad a, one- man team stacking up against the entire Williams varsity. The suc- cess of the Union team, according to the Concordiensis of 1934 was brought about by the use of passes and line plunges at the psychologi- cal moment, but to the majority the game was won not by foot- ball maneuvers but by Ralph Sem- era d.

In the contest ucts.\ last year, ten dollars was awarded Reuben D. Hea(i, '25, told the Union College students In daily as- sembly tody that \life insurance is thi> American people's private form or social security_\ Mr. Head's speech came as part of the local observance of the 1939 Annual Message of Life Insurance. The speaker traced the history c,f man's stt·uggle for security and added that \every American wants to provide for himself if possible, The people of this country for the past hundred years have fought !o conquer dependency through life insurance, not only for themselve~ in old age, but for their dependents in case the income they provide is cut off by a premature death.\ Mr. Head said that the people of this country have built up a tre- mendous security stake through life insurance. In this country 64,000,000 people own 125,000,000 life insurance policies which are worth $110,000,000,000. With seven percent of the world's population we alone own 70'/r of all the life insurance ol the world. Monetary Retm·ns \Every year,\ ile continued, \sees an outpouring of money to the populace from the tremendous se- cUt·ity fund they have amassed\. Last year alone approximately two billion, six hundred millions of dol- lars was paid out to b<:neficiaries and living policy holders. 60% of this money was paid to living policy holders in the form of retire- ment income, disability payments, endowments, cashed-in-policies and dividends. The speaker pointed out that in 1940, the Social Security payments in old age pensions alone will reach $110,000,000. In retirement pay- ments in 1938, 333,000 people re- ceived $11~.000,000 through insur- ance. In concluding his speech, M•· Head said, \Accor·dingly while we make provision for the future we are building up one of the strong- est supports of om· economic sys- tem, the .fruits of which help us to make that provision larger. Life insurance is one of man's greatest accomplishments in his struggle for security.\ Prexy Delivers Shortest ChapelS peech on Record It was a sorry looking chapel when Dr. Fox bowed from the waist t0 seat the undergradu- ates in Saturday morning's daily assembiy. With two of the four markers, and about three- fourths of the students absent, fhere was a general air of \What's the use?\ D~r. leo Strauss 1 WiU Be First I Spencer lecturer As the die-hards and the \too- many-cut\ men settled into the unrelenting wooden benches, Dr. Fox announced with regret that the scheduled speaker, Rabbi Goldstein, had been sudlle!lly taken ill and would be unable to appear. The students seemed to be taking their disappointment pretty well when Dr. Fox re- marked calmly, \But there's a rather important matter which I ought to discuss with you for a few minutes this morning .. -\ and paused to view the wrecli- age left by this bombshell. With hopes dropping silently and jaws dropping almost silent- ly, the president earned himself as hearty a round of applause as the anemic attendance could scrape together when he remem- bered to add, \But I won't.\ This is undoubtedly the shortest chapel talk on record.

Larrabee announc- ed today that Dr. Leo Strauss wlll deliver the first Spencer Lecture of the year on Wednesday eve- ning, December 6, in Old Chapel. The subject of Dr. Strauss' lecture, which will be open to the public, will be \Persecution and the Art of Writing.\ Dr_ Strauss is an ex- iled German scholar and an inter- nationally recognized authority on political philosophy. Dr. Strauss' lecture will be 'l. part of his five weeks' stay on the Union campus. He will arrive on the campus on Monday, November 13. Previous visting Spencer lec- turers have spent little time in their visits here. Will Lecture to Classes Dr. Larrabee has secured his services through the Committee on Political Refugees of the Ameri- can Philosophical Association.

Kussma,n, Chess Wizard, Defe.ats 16 Players in Simultaneous Tourney During his years of study in Eng- land, Dr. Strauss brought to com- pletion the work for which he is best known, \The Political Philoso- phy of Hobbes,\ which was pub- lished by the Oxford University Press and acclaimed by Ernest Barker as a \new and original contribution to the interpretation of one of the greatest of England's thinkers.\ Since that time Dr. Strauss has made a special study of Greek political thought. He is a man of wide scholarly interests in history and literature as well as philosophy. He has traveled widely and speaks .excellent English. The constantly rising costs of government was the topic discussed in the Empire State Town Meetin1r of the Air on Sunday aftet·noon by Speaker Oswald D. Heck of the New York State Assembly and Dr. Chester B. Pond, acting direc- tor of the state department of tax\ ation and finance's bureau of re- search and statistics. Speaker Heck said that the most powerful impediment to those who seek to \curtail unnecessary func- tions 0f government\ are \the mul- titude of interest groups constantly seeking additional appropriations· to continue or expand functions of par amount importance to them but of doubtful relative value to the public at large,\ He emphasized the fact that he receives more let- ters in opposition to these expendi- tures than he does ad¥ocating them. Dr. Pond agreed with Speaker Heck that the chief reasons for the rising costs of .government was the \increasing demand for public serv- ices especially relief,\ and added that \until something can be don:;; to cure this cancer on our economic body, relief )Jids fair to remain a major function of government.\ He added that one thing the depres- sion has done to aid the graduates of institutions of higher learning is to give them an outlet for their talen4; .in an ·expanding program of governmental activities ground- ed .in popula~ demand. chine.

Kussman, cham- pion exponent of the intricate pas- time of the black and the white_ Undaunted by the announcement that Mr. Kussman has survived as the national intercollegiate cham- pion of 1928, and that he has been chess champion of C.C.N.Y. and. of Columbia, the challenging under- graduates entered the contest in the Civil Engineering Building with hair atoss, cheeks ablaze, all set for the fray. At this, the first meeting of the newly-organized Union College· Chess Club, few of the participants realized from the outset of the tournament that they would suffer such ignominous defeat at the hands of this wizard of the chess- board as they did. The method of Chester H.

Smith is presi- dent. Kussman, who had .tied for first place in the French-Swiss tournament in Geneva in 1933, hardly expected to be gi·ven a close run for his money last evening, but one hardy individual managed to keep at it until the game was de- clared a draw by the judges. The fellow evidently felt rooked at this, but time was telling on the players after their vigorous set-to over the board and further maneuvers had to be curtailed. (The session lasted four hours for the more persever- ing hangers-on.) After seeing what a compara- tively few players could do in one evening with only a small number of the umpteen-million possible po- sitions of the chess-pieces on the board, the interested members have decided to hold regular week- ly meetings and to arrange matches with teams and clubs from other nearby colleges. A bunch of vagrant faculty members from the math and science departments popped in during the tourn,ey to kibitz awhile, and perhaps to suggest some wlerdly unorthodox plays to foil the un-foilable Kussman. But, regardless of what system was used, the games, with the excep- tion of the one draw, ended up with Mr. K's opponent sunendering, waving the white flag from the top •of his castle and muttering, \All right, .guess you win, gambit!\ While making his residence here, Dr. Strauss will occupy the visit- ing lecturers room in Hale House. He will maintain regular office hours at 207 Bailey Hall for infor- mal tall's with students. ---o---- Hale House Committee To Recieve Complaints A student committee of Hale House diners has been asked by Dr. Dixon Ryan Fox to serve as a representative group for the pur- pose of bringing student complaints to the attention of Mr. Mcillwaine of the Comptroller's Office and Mr. Cease, manager of Hale House. The committee will meet about once a month with Mr. Mclllwaine to present any complaints or sug- gestions which may have been brought to them by the diners at Hale House. Mr. Mc!llwaine ex- plained yesterday that it will be up to him to discuss whatever the stu- dents may bring to his attention with Mr. Cease.'

To say that they were dis- appointed would be to make a gt·oss mis- llp in the baliwick of the Buff and Blue, to doubt that Hamilton can beat any Union team on this field is virtual heresy. A glance at the recorcl of l'nion-Hmnilton contests played at Clinton would tend to confirm the belief that the field is a jinx to the Dutch- men. Of 23 encounters played on the cursed greensward, Union has won but five; and one must look back ten years to the 1929 contest to read of the most recent Gamet triumph. Good and even great Union elevens have bowed to reputedly weak Buff and Blue teams at Clinton. Two yea1·s ago a campus sage was de1·ided fo1· infening that the Con- tinentals would even score on the Dutchmen -the chapel bell at Hamilton tolled fm· eight hom·s aftel' that game, in testimony or a 7 There's onP lad in this here cam- of punishment as anyone else.

They are familiar to every stu- dent, and have been the most prevalent source of conversation on this campus ever since last Saturday. Our point is that the l'nion-Williams rivalry has gradually assum- ed the propm-tions of a g-rudge fight, and that there is no pm-pose in continuing it. Other g-ames on the Union schedule may be more spirited and more keenly contested, but none has the teaditional significanee of the Hamilton fray. The rivalry has mellowed with time, and has developed into what has ll 0 N 5 C R E E N\ ~~ long been 1·ecognized as one of the finest _ _ competitions in New York state. There is 1!;;;:===========::.'.1 little of the antipath,v present that we find TherP is very little to be said There is no enjoyment to be gained from watching a game such as last Saturday's, and the ill feeling· between the colleges concemed is increased with every passing yea1·. There is also the considemtion that injuries are more p1·evalent in the Williams game than in any othet· game on ou1· schedule. The style of play used by the Pm·ple team last Satur- dav is a menace to the health and safety of ev~ry man who dares to face this type of opposition. With these things in mind, we recommend that the Union-Williams rivalry be di::;con- tinued at least for the present. Let us not foster such exhibitions in the name of sport.

Ironically, the Williams eleven, which ga-ined heavily on the ground all afternoon, star ted by piling up four first downs and advanced to the Union 37-yard line. Williams, however, fumbled far behind their own line of scrimmage and Union recovered o.n the Williams 47. Van- nier lost a yard on an attempted end sweep and Hammerstrom crashed the center for four yards. Vannier then faded back and heaved a 24-yard aerial to Diamond Marotta who cut to the left and raced 20 yards for the first Union tally. Hammer strom's placement was wide. There was no farther scoring in the first period although Vannier successfully passed to Marotta for 37 yards.

The other films to be shown later in the year concern skiing in the Swiss Alps, scenes in United States national parks, mountain climbing in United States and American ski resorts such as Sun Valley. 'fhe film depicting skiing in Switzerland is being loaned to the Outing Club by a Swiss Railroad ·Company. Olmstead also announced that Otto Schniebs will return to Union again this year to deliver a lecture on December 5th. Bradford Wah- burn, famous explorer, will also visit the campus under the auspices of the Outing Club. On Saturday, March 3, 1917, most of the student body was probably thinking of the basketball game that night between Union and Dartmouth, but noted in the paper of that date is the fact that on the night before, 24 faculty members sent ::-. telegram to President Wil- son asking for a declaration of war against Germany. Articles on the progress of the student machine gun corp~. and editorials on military service soon began to appeat· and by the first of April, military training was be- ing ta.ken by a large percentage of the student body. The Concordien- sis of March 29 reports \The Maxim Machine Gun made its ap- pearance on the campus. The members of the corps will start drills at once . . .\ In the same issue is the notice \The Dean an- nounced in chapel this noon that all seniors in go\)d standing who enlist In some government service A few days later President Rich- mond announced the formation of a Re»erve Officers Training Corp at the college, and within a week of the declaration of war, military training was recognized by the fac- ulty as a r·egular course of study and the Union College battalion held its first outdoor drill on Li- brary Field. On May 11, 43 students and 4 fac- ulty members left the campus for Madison barracks where a week later three members of the Ter- race Council were tapped. From the beginning to the end of the war, the files show a multitude of stories, pictures and letters about Union men in the se1·vice, while on the home front, the student corp» ambushed each other in the wilds of the woods on Lenox road. These manuvers appear to have 'been serious affairs in which some few of the students showed some skill in the gentle art of skirmish- ing while others seem to have ob- jected to crawling about through the briars in pursuit of the friendly \enemy.\ The Concordiensis wax- eel patriotic mood by printing an Her version, by the way, of ·the Freddie-Bronner-locked \.out-of-his- own-house episode is entertaining, to say the least.

May these ' COLLEGIANA JOURNALISMA The college j oumalist has been described as a none-too- happy combination of ultra-conservatism and ultra-radical- ism. Some time last yem· the Sew Yot·ker, joumal of super- sophisticated Americans described this phenomenon thus: .. they (college newspapers) are the real liberal jomnals of the country l>ecause theit· editor:s are twenty-one. At tv•enty- one an editm· has the lovely tart quality of the unripe. S:Jcially he is a conservative-more conservative probably than he will ever be, but editorially he is a rainbow of mdical thought, large]~·, :we believe, because of the sudden orgiastic pleasme ·Of literary exp1·ession. lie has a distinctive literary style instantly recog·nizable: a kind of pedantic sarcasm. The first flush of printer's ink is like \Vine: that is why campus papers are so alive and why they cause deans so much acute distress worse than cramps of the stomach.\ This seemingly glib comment reveals, upon closet· scrutiny, a.n amazing· amount of truth. There is a marked tendency of ::;orne undergraduate newspapers to tackle current events in a big way. It is especially evident that editorial writers are prepared to g-o out on a limb at all times. That premise is borne out by the recent f:'.urvey sponsored by the Princetonian on American neutmlity. The smvey disclosed the fact that \hard! a college paper in the country had not backed neu- trality in its editorial columns.\ Time was, in the days of Joe College and Betty Co-Ed, when the college newspaper (so-called) was the prime vehicle fot· smutty jokes and sexy innuendos. With the passing of the \collegitae\, em, the college editor has seemingly adopted a sober and very \newsy\ approach. He is, an all probability, aiming at a big-time newspaper career, and takes his work ser.iously. He likes to believe that this is his journalism school. The editor has no time for pranks. At twenty or twenty- one he has an inherent sensitivity to fresh breezes of thought. He is dead ag;ainst war, or is, until war arrives. A product of the democratic scheme of things, the college news- paper is deeply cognizant of democratic rights and institu- tions. It is indeed \a lilwral jomnal\; -McGill Daily guests of Union leave behind them I memories of the tinkling of glasses, I lipstick traces on cigarettes, bub- ' bling laughter and the fragrance ! of perfume. ---0--- NOTICES Regular Varsity basketball prac- tice will start Monday and continue through next week at 8:30 p. m. in Alumni Gymnasium.

Randy Kenyon, injured sopho- more end, will also be In the game against undefeated Union. There is also a possibility that Bill San- dow, rugged sophomore quarter- back, will recover f.rom a shoulder injury in time to take paz·t in the tussle.

C. Sher- riff's \Journey's End,\ which is now 1n its last stages of rehear- sals under the direction of Miss Miriam Doy1e, visiting director from New York. Under Miss Doyle's direction, the play achieves its moving force with a simplicity rarely expressed by non-professional groups. The students cast in the production make the most of the play which shows the effect of war upon a small group of young officers. S!\eond Play Here This is Miss Doyle's second play at Union College. In 1936, during the leave of absence of Edward L. Carroll, '27, director of the Mountebanks until last June, Miss Doyle staged \Squaring the Cir- cle.\ Miss Doyle left the stage, unlike most actors, at the height of her career. She had appeared for Belasco and played with David Warfield in \The Return of Peter Grimm,\ and had followed that with another performance in the leading feminine role in \The Goose Hangs High,\ a comedy by Lewis Beach, that was not alone the highlight of its season, but is likewise remembered today as one of the most expert and amusing comedies of all time. Cast for Play Instructor Takes Leave; Plays in Harvard Band Douglas P. Dryer, instructor Qf economics and logic, attended the Harvard-Army football game in Cambridge last Saturday as a member of the Crimson band. Dryer played the clarinet in the Harvard band both as a gradu- ate and as an undergraduate. Asked how the band had changed since he left it, he re- plied, \Oh it's degenerated!\ Later he admitted that he had spoken hastHy and said that Harvard had one of the be:;t military bands in the East. Dry- er explained his presence at Cambridge by saying that he went \since I had Saturday off.\ Dryer has played in the Hat- vard band for seven years. In his graduate days he was direc- t0r of the woodwind section. Ht' claims never to have missed .1 Harvard football game in his college years.

Freshmen Prepare For Spelling Bee Annual Match To Take Place Tomorrow Night The final eliminations in the third annual freshman spelling bee will be held in the Old Chapel to- morrow evening at 7:30. accord- ing to Professor Green of the Eng- lish department who is organizing the match. The procedure of the match will be the same as that of an old fashioned spelling bee. The contest originates in each of the eight freshman English sectior,s. Every freshman enters the con- test and eliminations are made by withdrawing a man after he ha:; misspelled two words. If a worJ is misspelled, it is discarded and a new one given to the next m'ln, thereby eliminating the opportunity for any contestant to spell a ,, ord correctly only by hearing that tn <: other possibility is wrong. \vord:; for the contest are arranged m order of increasing difficulty. After the preliminary matches held in class, the two undefeated men from each freshman English section will meet for· the final bout. Dr. Kellogg will pronounce the words for the finals in which the rules are to be the same as those used in the preliminaries. A prize of ten dollars is awarded to the wi,l- ner of the finals, five dollars to i he first \r·unner-up and a two-dol· lar consolation prize to the third highest man, Last year Armand Fiegenbaum won the first prize over Eric King, the runnE'r-up, who was downed on the word \apothegm.\ ----0--- Johnson Defines Censor.

George Miller, chairman of the Ball, announced yesterday that over three hundred tickets had been sold, and said he believed that the members of the faculty and foot- ball team, their guests and the chaperons who were invited ta at- tend' without tickets, accounted for the remaining hundred couples. Sixteen House Dancl's Other scheduled events in the program for the week-end included the Rochester-Union Football game and the sixteen fraternity dances held Saturday night. Approximate- ly four thousand persons witnessed the Roc,hester contest, while more than five hundred couples spent part of Saturday evening at one or more of the various fraternity dances. Chairman Miller announced yes- terday that when all the bills for the Interfraternity Ball have been paid, he expects to have a profit of slightly over one hundred and twenty dollar·s. This money will be turned over to the Student Council, he said. The half hour radio broad- cast from the ball over the NBC Red network has brought Miller several letters praising the music The reports included wme from El· mira and Boston. Hale House Crowded Mr. N. W. Cease, manager of Hale House, announced yesterday that 130 persons took advantage of the fact that the dining hall was open during the intermission of the Inter-fraternity Ball. The group included President Fox's party, and a large number of faculty mem- bers. Among the highlights of the ball was \Sincer·ely Yours\ an original Eong by Jim Cooper, of the Union undergraduate boozy. Woody Her- man played the melody as a clar- inet solo and then sang the words.

SNOW CRUISER W HE\' it comes to dignity,Antarctica'~ penguins, with their permanent tail coats and stiff shirts, are right in the front row. Hut their dignity is due for a shock. A \snow cruiser\ will soon be rolling across the penguins' icy frunt yard. Putting it mildly, this cruiser is quite dii .. ferent from the locomotives, trolley coaches, and other vehicles that G-E engineers help to build or equip. But these engineers weren't the least perturbed when called upon to design electric equipment for the strange conveyance. Four G-E traction motors, generators tor the two 150-hp diesel ePgines, and complete control equipment were installed. Designed by the staff of the Research Foun- t!ation of the Armour Institute of Technology tor use by the Government during the U. S. Antarctic Service under Rear Admiral Byrd, the cruiser is so built that it will crawl over crevasses 1 'i ieet wide. The vehicle, constructed hy the Pullman-Stand- an! Car :\Ifg.

THE CONCORDIENSIS, TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 14, 1939 Page Three 'DUTCHMEN DOWN ROCHESTER, 46 A PECK SPORTS to 0 OF The Union team closed its home season in a blaze of glory. . . . Besides Captain Hammerstrom, those sopho- more backs looked plenty good .... Waite Hoyt, WGY sports commentator who broadcasts every .Saturday at 7:30 p. m. says that Hammer- strom could be a star on any college football team in the country .... Sam's m:ost out- standing cnaracteristic, when on the gridiron, is his foot- ball instinct, Waite claims .... This commentator is a star in his own right, you know, as star hurler for the 1927 New York. Yankees.' _ . . He has seen Union play all four of its home games and states that the Dutchmen are much bet- ter than they were against Trinity, and could now take the Hartford colLege by at least 19 points. . . . Dick Griffith did a nice job of calling signals while he was in the game. . . . Of course, we're satisfied with the score the way it was, but can think of four other occasions when Union might have scored again-~. Hammerstrom's run when he was stopped after going 49 yards because a team-mate missed a block. 2. Norris, when the speedy wing-back, stepped out of bounds on a reverse play when he was in the clear. 3. The last few minutes of the game-when Kearns tried a field goal when it was first down and 13 yards to go for a score. 4. The first half ended with the reserves on the Rochester 11 yard line after going 46 yards in fiv-e plays. Our condolences t'o the cross-country team which lost to Williams Saturday and therefore completed the poor- est season - two wins and four losses-any Union cross- country team has concluded since 1914. Strange that the varsity gridders are doing better than any football team since the same year. . . . Union was lucky not to be penalized for having twelve men on the field Saturday . The extra was \Pal Sherry Hillick's dog who tried very hard to remain with his play- ing master. . . . Trinity was knocked from the ranks of the undefeated last Saturday when Amherst took them into camp, 19 to 0. . . . A large delegation of Union students should journey to Hamilton Saturday to see the Dutch- men conclude this history- making 1939 season. Tickets can be secured at Hal Witt- ner's office with a fifty cent saving. . . . Basketball prac- tice started last night in the gymnasium. Coach Nitchman certainly has his hands full with Union's two most popu- lar major sports over-lapping. ... That was some crowd which answered Coach Ci- ampa's call for freshman courtmen. . . . We sincerely hope the better team wins next Saturday at Hamilton, because then there will be no doubt as to the winner.

Dr. Smith countered that \the teacher who remains honest with him~elf. cannot logically demand the unmolested right to affiliate with the cause of labor. the cause of capital, the cause of political doctt ine which is contrary to the fundamental tenets of the society which supports and protects him, or th<' cause of any religious sect whose purposes or methods conflict with the purposes and methods of his society, and at the same time deny th<\se right.s to the members of the army, the navy, or the de- partment of justice.\ CALENDAR Toda.y i :30 p. m. -Classical Club Meet- ing.

ALL THESE TOBACCOS except Turkish (which is bought direct from the planters in Turkey and Greece) and Maryland (which is bought through sealed bids under government supervision) are bought at public auction, just like any other auction where you might have bought in a table or a chair. AT THE AUCTION SALE the tobacco is piled in baskets weighing from about 100 to 500 pounds and each purchaser buys all of his tobaccos by competitive bidding for the particular piles he wants. THE CHESTERFIELD BUYERS buy the best of these mild ripe tobaccos for the Chesterfield blend. And it is Chesterfield's Combination .•• the right amounts of Burley and Bright ... just enough Maryland ... and just enough Turkish- that makes the big difference between Chesterfield and other cigarettes. IT IS BECAUSE of this combination_ that Chesterfields are COOLER, have a BETTER TASTE and are DEFINITELY MILDER. They are made of the world's best cigarette tobaccos.

A sylvan setting for the dance was indicated by Ben Leland, dec- oration chairman. \There will be lot::; of trees and woods to get lost in an.i you'll have to rough it at our dance because we plan to have only logs to sit on,\ Leland said. Tickets have been prepared for every member of the sophomore class and will sell for $1.00.

Bellinger's orchestra has played at many college dances throughout central and northern New York and Canada. Among his recent en- gagements have been the Syracuse Senior Prom, the Colgate Senior Prom, the Hamilton Junior Prom, and dances at the Universities of Buffalo, Montreal and McGill.

Of course it From this committee of 24 juniors, the class officers and the Student Council Chairman will pick an executive g1·oup of six or seven men. This selection, also, will be subject to the appl'Oval of the Student Council Executive Committee. The members of the Prom Executive Committee will serve as chairmen of the groups in charge of publicity, band, decor- ations, favors, chaperones, and favors. The remaining mem- bers will, in large measure, serve as ticket salesmen, and will be given a 20'/( reduction in the price of thei1· own bids for every three tickets they sell. The Prom Chairman will be selected aftet· the executive members of the dance group have been interviewed by the class officers and the Executive Committee of the Council. Following these interviews the officers will propose a chair- man for the function. As in the case of the choice of the committee itself, this selection is subject to the approval of the Council's Executive Committee. A clearly defined list of free-bid recipients has been an- nounced so as to prevent the annual consternation, confusion and ill-vdll caused at Prom time when there are many re- quests made for these complimentary tickets. There may be flaws in the new arrangement-we doubt that there ever has been, or that there ever will be, a perfect Prom system. We do feel, however, that the new plan is vastly superior to .Union's former \popularity contest.\ Every faction will be represented by a man who is considered to be its most competent junior; such an arrangement should do much to p1•event a repetition of the \boycott\ of last year's Prom by a few disgruntled group.s. The members will be appointed to the committee on a basis of competence, rather than elected to it because of an athletic prowess m· mere affability. is necessary to reckon all such sword-crossings as the Scottish wa1·s. the War of the Roses, and the 17th Century revolutions as at least two crusades a piece, two British causes having claimed equally divine origins in each case. Last Sunday the congregation he1e was lectured without any particular subtlety on this theme: Ye are fighting God's Fight: may He forgive and be merciful unto our enemies-once their sins are well accounted for. Here is the final verse of the final hymn of the morning: \Grant us Thy help till foes are backward driven: Grant them Thy truth that they may be forgiven: Grant peace on earth and, after we have striven, Peace in Thy heaven.\ The service was concluded with the singing of \God Save the Kmg,\ The above probably will be vari- ously interpreted as either pacifis- tic, atheistic. or expressive of deep- seated dis-like of Britain and its people; all three are equally remote from the truth. For a moment we will drop the editorial veil in the interests of self-defense. In the first place, and to answer my own challenges, I am strongly pro-allied in respect to the present ing itself before political forces, so disappoints me. For those of us who favor dem- ocratic governing processes - al- though we probably ar·e not at all certain what, or if so, where, de- mocracy is-it seems that Britain and France are fighting for sincere convictions as well as by economic necessity. But the fact that the present state of affairs is lo be pre- ferred, both on material and ideal- istic grounds, to some less desir- able alternative, does not Christian- ize such things as incendiary bombs, mustard gas. and the West- ern Front. Rather the present debacle is the 1·esult of the mis- tal{ened policies, not of one man or one nation, but of the community of nations. and probably, to go further, of a drastically benighted social organization. The big battle of this war will occur not before the armistice, but after it, when some people and some organizations will fight the medal-bedecked forces of militar- ism, nationalism, and revenge, to secure a more reasonable. tolerant, and lasting peace than its prede- cessor of 1919. It might well seem that one of the leaders in that fight should be organized religion, but, unless that institution changes its cou1 sc veL y soon, its words will carry little weight if it attempts an abrupt about-face after the last bomb is dropped. And in all prob- ability no change will be made, be- cause the Church in Bl'itain at the moment is not being unusually hyprocritical, but is simply running true to the conventional form of any organized religion in any na- tion in any wartime. The situa- tion at horne was exactly the same in 1917-18, and as a result the clergy had a chance to preach a second sermon sometime in the late twenties repealing their exhorta- tions of the previous decade. Per- haps about 1950-55 they will have a similar opportunity. * * We re-dan the journalistic mask and apologize for such long-winded subjectivity. Tonight the Men's Union pre- sented a \mixed smol,er\ or variety show which exhibited the amazing amount of vocal. instrumental, dra- matic, and comic talent which re- ~ides. generally quite inconspicu- ously, in the student body here. Undoubtedly the star of the show was none other than Niel Louden's young brother, Allister. who did the best impersonizations that we have seen, professional or otherwise. A week ago we picked up Leo Solley at a rnent when he was eulogizing Union gridiron victories, and predicting the best Garnet sea- son in many :o. day. Congratulations lads; if YL'U have won the Wil- liams game, our one regt·et of the year will be not having been there.

Union's offensive power thiOugh these years completely out- ehines that of the Buff and Blue, the figures being Union, 524, Ham- ilton, 279. The contest means much, not only to the Dutchmen, but alEo to Hamilton. A win tomorrow would give Union its first undefeated sea- son since 1914, when the Garnet overran Hamilton on Steuben Field. A win tomorrow for Hamilton would be mo1e than enough to make their season a success and atone for the numerous defeats the Continentals have experienced in this Fall's gridiron war!\.

Balch will be at quarter and Nor- ris and Vannier will be running in the halfback positions. Kluge and Balch were slightly hurt in the Rochester game but will be in shape for the game. The previous records of both teams point to an easy victory for the Garnet. However, records down through the years point out that neither team find this game an By compa1ative records the ea:sy one, nor one to be taken in Dutchmen should enter tomorrow's stride.

Cooke again doffed his hat in tribute to Union Col- lege and its star fullback, Cap- tain Sam Hammerstrom, in a feature story in Wednesday's New York Herald Tribune. Cooke mentioned the system of selecting All-American players and the resulting fact that small college gridiron luminaries are lost in the scramble and then went on with a description of Sammy's football feats this fall. Cooke states that the method of formulating these mythical teams is hazardous, but will continue till the end of time. He says that \in the building of the All-American. the smaller col- leges are usually lost in the shuffle, hidden behind the glory laden headlines preserved for larger institutions. Such is the case at Union College where the football squad has won six and tied one this season and where Sam Hammerstrom has astound- ed the team's followers with his repertoire of tricks.\ The A I ban y Knickerbocker News gave Sammy notice on Wednesday evening, running seven pictures of him, with long cut-lines under each.

The book, written by the author of \My Fatherland,\ does not pur- port to be another translation of \Mein Kampf.\ It is, however. \an entirely accurate and faithful de- scription of Hitlf'r's world pro- gram.\ \Hitler Is No Fool\ relates Hit- ler's rise to power, explains why anti-Semitism is an inevitable part of fascism, and why the real facts of Hitler's life ar·e not told in his autobiography. Der Fuehrer's wide- ly scattered views on Jews, democ- racies, war, peace, and racial theories are arranged in an or- derly form in Billinger's work.

The ft•eshman basketball squad has been working out all weelr un- der the watchful eyes of Coach AI Ciampa, assisted by Nels Nitchman. The team, which commenced prac- tice last week with the abnorma:l number of 35 candidates, has dwin- dled to 18, as many found the pace too strong and voluntari·ly dropped out. Ciampa stated that the yearling squad is a bit green but at the same time fast, spirited, eager to Jearn and show great posstbilities. So far the men who have shown up best are Seguin, Carnwright, Wy- socki, Macumber, Rinoldi, Carpen- ter, Kozlowski, Douglas, Lee, SJi.ng- erland and Duford. The yearlings have been hold·ing · daily informal practices with Ni leh- man and Ciampa who have 13een str·essing the fundamentals of pass- ing, shooting, simple plays and basic offensive tactics. Most of the players are accustomed to the zone type of defense and need a lot of drill to strengthea their defensive· play. So far the practice sessions have been informal to get the play- ers in shape slowly, but Ciampa an- nounced today that extt>nsive drills and training are scheduled from now on. Varsity A's Working Nitchman has been working hard with tht> varsity basket tossers to get them in shape for their first game on December 13 against Ste- vens Tech. Nels has been drilling his squad in a new style of play which the key men on the team have rapidly learned already. These \key men,\ Miller, Rathlev, Swart, Turchick, Co-captain Carr, Jacobowski and Sherman, will be joined next week by Hammer- strom and Vannier who are still busy on the gridiron. Co-captam Watson has not reported for prac- tice as he has to work each after- noon. However, Herb is going to take his two week vacation after Thanksgiving so that he can work out with the squad. Nels has been drilling his court- men mostly on the new style of play but announced that when all the men report he will start worl~ on fundamentals for a couple of weeks and will arrange for two practice games before the curtain- raiser with Stevens Tech.

Of aN the students who originally indicated that they · were interested in such a course, only seven have succeeded in meeting the 1 equirements im- • posed by the government and . the college. The Aeronautics . Authority has granted the col- · lege permission to lower the nu·mber of students necessary to start the course from ten to nine. Upperclassmen who are inter- ested should see Dr. P. I. Wold in the Physics Building imme- diately. Freshmen are not eligi- ble. Union drama patrons ct·owded the Mountebanks Theater last Fri- day eveping in typical \first-night\ fashion for the initial performance of R. C. Sheriff's \Journey's End.\ Under the direction of Broadway veteran, Miriam Doyle, the college players did ample justice to the BritiBh 1 war-time play, bringing out with commendable accuracy the sly humor and tender pathos with which the author has por- trayed life in the front-line trenches. The general tenor of the , play is high in morality, for the '---------------• author attempts to bring out the \incredible nobility\ of man which tries to rise above the reek of lhe trenches, the horrors of war, and even death itself. The Mountebanks cast has miraculously caught this elusive spirit of the play, and through their sincerity have achiev- ed results which make this stand out over their previous productions.

The best varsity football se Jsun since 1914-that is the record estab- lished by the 1939 gridion squad which concluded its season agaiPst Hamilton Saturday, compl.:ting eight games with seven wins and one tie. The 1939 Dutchmen, by virtue of their fine record become the sec- ond best team in Union Collrge history which extends over 52 sea- sons. The 1914 team won eight and lost none. That history making; squad and the present varsity will be feted in a banquet at H<>.le House tonight at 7 o'clock. The 1939 Dutchmen also take another place in the history of football at Union by piling up the third highest number of points any Union team has scored in one sea- son. It is necessary to go back t•J \ancient history\ to find a team to better the present varsity's 203 points in eight games. Garnet Strong in '91, '94 In 1891, the Garnet piled up 226 points in six games, defeating the Clinton Liberal Institute and Al- bany Academy by big scores. Also the 1894 team was notorious for its powerful offense, scoring 281 points in twelve games. True to form, Andrew Speziali again won his laurels in the part of Captain Stanhope. His portrayal of the company commander, loved an,d revered by his men for his un- selfish devotion to duty, yet addict- ed to whiskey from a mortal fear of death, is an interpretation of character worthy of note.

Fraternity Alumni Discuss Problems Advisers Confer With College Officials on Scholarship, Rushing The advisers of Union College's seventeen fraternities, President Dixon Ryan Fox, Dean Charles F. F. Garis and Assistant Secretary Frederic A. Wyatt discussed prob- lems of mutual interest to fraterni- ties !3-nd the college administration after a dinner in Hale House last night. The advisers who were invited to attend, were the representatives of the following fraternities: Alpha Delta Phi, John G. Green; Beta Theta Pi, Walter S. McNab; Chi Psi, John L. Schoolcraft; Delta Chi, Sidney Fort; Delta Phi, Dr. Beverly L. Vosburgh; Delta Upsilon, Fred- erick Bronner; Kappa Alpha, An- thony Hoadley; Kappa Nu, Benja- min Naumoff; Kappa Sigma, W.

Marcellus Clowe; Sigma Chi, Franlt Saunders; Sigma Phi, John R. Hartman; Theta Delta Chi, Dr. William C. Ostrom. Schuman, Bennetton Discuss Its Position In European Conflict Dr. Frederick L. Schuman, Wood- row Wilson Professor of Govern- ment at Williams College, and Dr. Norman A. Bennetton, Assistant Professor of French at Union, were the two main discussion leaders at Sunday's Empire State Town Meet- ing of the Air when the question \Are England and France Actually Fighting for Democracy?\ was con- sidered. Dr. Schuman maintained that \the future of democracy, here and in Europe, is bound up with the Anglo-French cause.\ Dr. Bennet- ton, who was born and received his basic education in England, on the other hand, maintained \with a very heavy heart\ that it was his \sincere\ conviction that Europe to- openly pro-fascits war.\ Dr. Schuman countered by de- claring that Chamberlain and Da- ladier have now been awakehed by the shock of Hitler's \rapacious- ness,\ and continued by describing his ideas on why Britain and Ft·ance are at war today. Dr. Bennetton replied by outlin- ing a set of four \War aims of the Allies\ and said that \for years millions of people have been plead- ing for collective security to stop aggression without war.\ He added that no matter what Germany's de- mands for peace now are, they can be amended at the peace confer- ence. Dr. Schuman said that Hitler made his greatest blunder in the Nazi-Soviet pact, in which, he said, Hitler was out-Hitlered by Stalin. 0 Faculty Represent Union At Chemical Meeting The starting team played only 35 minutes of the Haverford game and then the reserves were insert- ed into the fray and also made a good showing, scoring three times. At the first home contest of the ~·ear, the Garnet stacked up against the Trinity Blue and Gold and came out of the game with the only blot on its record, a 7 to 7 tie. Union Downs Williams Middlebury, which boasted a 7 to 0 victory over Williams-made by \breaks\ in the closing minutes of the contest-supplied the opposition in the second home contest and the Dutchmen won easily, 31 to 7. The next week, Union journeyed to Vermont to meet an unbeaten Green and Gold eleven, and came home with a 19 to 6 victory under its belt after a great second half stand in which it scored all its points. At home again, the traditional rivalry with Rensselaer Polytech- nic Institute was renewed as the Dutchmen romped through the Cherry and White for four touch- downs, while holding the Engineers to one, and winning 26 to 6. Coach \Duke\ Nelson, who had a fine sea- son at R.P.I. this year, was throw- ing his team against his former associates. The Purple of Williams played hard and rough against the Dutch- men on Weston Field but could not score enough points to upset the fine record established by Union, and the Garnet juggernaut rolled up 27 points to Williams' 7.

The fittest always survive. Let there, however, be no misunder- standing. Because a state is \fit it does not necessarily follow that it has 1eceived the stamp of appro- val of other states, or even that its right to existence has been uni- versally recognized. Fitness in the sense here used is synonomous with size, military and economic strength, and preparedness. The nations of the world fall into a definite classification when consid- ered in this manner, and it appears as though the process of natural selection is about to terminate the independent existence of a few mo1•e nations which are too weak to compete in the struggle for sur- vival. 'l'he Private Lives of Elizabeth and Essex, somewhat adapted from a play by Maxwell Anderson, is now describi·n·g high circles at Proctor's. Bette Davis, who ap- pears often enough on lcca.J screem; to be m1staken for a serial queen, herein enacts the role of a real, genuine although virgin queen. ~Iizabeth, the 1·egal one, emerges fzom the ordeal a woman of mono- tonous mannerism who waves her heacl, at m<:;, aud royal <:;cepter at ohe and the same time. When the waves have su·bsided she rubs her hands and fingers her jewels. She's an active one, is Liz'. Based on the assumption that ordering the death of favorite Robert Devereux, Earl of Essex, was more than even a queen could bear, 'l'hP Privati' Lin•s of Eliza,.. bt>th and EssPx is deftly handled to impress the point that people like Essex who are victims of their own wi11 to power should be subdued at all costs. You might almost ca·ll that propaganda, now mightn't you? Errol Flynn's interpretation of the ill-fated Essex leaves an in- delible impressioR that here was a handsome rogue with a strong head but an empty one. Alan Hale, as the ·IDster leader, Tyrone, skips nimbly through his single scene on a fi·ne bogus Irish brogue. (There will be a meeting of protest at the A.O.H. hall this evening at 8:30 sharp.) We must not, of course, forget to add that Sir Francis Bacon is done to a Crisp. Finally there is the inevitable comparison of Miss Davis's per- formance to that of her Broadway p1 edecessor, Judith Anderson. Here, as in all matters involving wide knowledge of the metropolitan scene, we consult E.ditor Knopf of the Idol. \Bette Davis,\ he says mysteriously, \is no Judith An- derson. Her Bess is none too good.\ Parallel: With its ·well-eamed 6 to {') victol'y over a truly inspired Hamilton team on Saturday, the Union football team brought to an end the eight-week assault on student nerves which has existed on the campus since the opening of the grid season, and established itself as one of the finest teams ever to represent l\Iinerva. Ah·eady sports experts are mentioning the Garnet as the foremost contender for the mythical \best small college team in the country\ rating. As people all over the world paus- ed to commemorate the end of the last war and pay respect to its victims, two little countries, pre- cariously situated between power- ful warring neighbors, assumed a specious calmness and prepared for the worst. Belgium paid one of the greatest tolls in the last war, and for all its suffering it 1·eceived noth- ing except the valuable lesson that words and promises are worthless in modern inter national relations. If conditions were such in 1914, they are many times worse today. Distrust in Europe has increased to such an extent that guarantees of non-aggression are looked upon as means to induce countries to dis- arm so that they may be more easily overcome by a surprise at- tack. Such is the attitude of Bel- gium, and also of Holland which has undoubtedly profited by the for- mer's bitter experience. Both coun- tries apparently believe in the prin- ciple of the uniformity of nature which states that what happens once may, under a sufficient degree of similarity of circumstances, hap- pen again. There is no denying that conditions now are much the same as in 1914. Recognition of this fact, coupled with German troop con- centrations on the border, caused Holland and Belgium to take defi- nite and probably very timely dip- lomatic action. The motivating force in the story is Essex's insatiable thirst for power. nis unwillingness to meet Elizabeth except on equal terms . . . as king to her queen. The Utle went through a series of rapid c·hanges while the pic- ture was in production because Master Flynn insisted that his role be featured with a prominence at least equal to Miss Davis's. J.D. P. ---0--- IN THE MAIL To the Editor; If we are to be consistent with the democratic conception of jus- tice, we cannot, without more defi- nite proof, say with certainty that Germany intended to invade her little neighbors at any time in this war.

The season's showing of seven vic- tories and one tie was the culmination of months of planning, hard work and plain grit. Head Coach Nelson Nitchman is especially deserving of praise for the large part he played in giving Union its first undefeated season in 25 years. The amount of time and energy expended by \Nels\ during the course of a football season will probably never be known; we are confident, how- ever, that it far exceeds that which could be asked of any faculty membe1·.

The reserve strength .of the team was, in large measure, responsible for the ,splendid showing-, and we should not over- look the role played b;y the men who filled the breach when the occasion demanded. The effective way in which the breach was filled probably meant the difference between vic- tory and defeat in more than one game. Certainly it is but \a modest proposal\ when we suggest that each man on the squad be awarded a football charm as a memento of his con- tribution to the team's unblemished record. The one factor about the team, however, which has earned the respect and admiration of all Union's undergraduates, is the all-important one known as Sam Hammerstrom. We have seen him collapse from sheer exhaustion during a game, we have frequently seen him outgain the entire opposing team, we have seen the glowing tributes paid him by newspapers of rival colleges in describing- the playing of \Slammin' Sammy\ as they have labeled him, but perhaps more than anything else, we have seen the quiet, unassuming and even diffident way in which he has worn his laurels. The ·Concordiensis merely echoes the sentiments of the entire Union student body when it salutes Sam Hammerstrom, a great athlete, and a true sportsman. which has been trained to see and appreciate the value of minor but nevertheless important details. Just as timely diplomatic action by the United States delayed but did not prevent the outbreak of hostilities, so the last minute pleas of Leopold and Wilhelmina saved their respec- tive nations for a short time only. War knows no rules, for the end justifies the means. The day is not far off when the diltes of Holland will be opened, and the Belgian sol- .diers will once again take their places in the trenches which they occupied in 1914, in another despe- rate attempt to retain that \right to life\ which needs only military foz·ce to make it \natural.\ John A.

On a reverse Norris went aroun.d the left end to the Hamilton 42. Hammerstrom cracked the center of the line and ·bulled his way through for seven yards. Bob Davis made it another first down on an end-around-play to the Hamilton 28. Norris, on a reverse, went down to the 20 and then Lee Sherman snatched a Hammerstrom pass, shook loose from two would~be tacklers and crossed the goal line standing up.

With first down and twelve to go for a touchdown the Union forward wall allowed the Hamilton backs only three yards and on the last .down \Sonny\ Dale's attempt- ed field goal was inches wide. Buff and Blue Threaten Hamilton entered Union territory only four times, apparently content to sit back and hold the powerful Garnet offense in check as much as possible. Finally in the last period the Buff and Blue made a strong bid to tally and tossed caution to the winds as they threw the ball three out of every five plays, and worked the ball inside of the Union twenty for the second time that afternoon. With a minute to go and the ball on the Garnet 16, third down and ten to go, Keane faded back to pass. Several Hamilton men were wait- ing for the ball on the Union eight, but Bob Baker who played an alert game ali' afternoon, com- pleted his second interception of the game and the gun ended play seconds later. Union rooters spent an anxious 15 minutes in the last period as Leavenworth and Keane showered the Union backfield with aerials. working to perfection, often with Naylor and Sisson picking them out of the air when surrounde.d by Garnet players, they rolled down toward the Union goal three times only to be stopped by in- terceptions and fumbles. Hammerstrom and Leavenworth were the offensive stars of the game. Besides running the ball 139 yards, Sammy threw 11 passes, four of which were completed for 62 yards. Leavenworth completed seven out of the 13 passes for 105 yards and constantly bottled Union up with his long kicks. Leaven- worth also carried the hall on 18 of 31 rushes gaining only 29 yards but his unerring passes threw plenty of fear in Union hearts.
