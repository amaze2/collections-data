The judge,; for last night's debate were: Colonel James Healy, of the Albany Times Union; Reverend William Spicer, pasto1· of the First Presbytei'ian Church in Glovers- ville; and the Honorable Henry Schrade, Jr., Mayo1· of Saratoga. These men listened to the argu- ment in their own. homes and then telephoned their decisions to the studio where the result was an- nounced at 12:30 a. m. This debate maz·ked the third in a series of eight such radio con- tests, the first two being with Syra- cuse Unive1sity and Middlebury College. At the regular meeting of the Union College Philomathean Soci- ety last night, a practice debate was given on the topic \Resolved that the Municipalities Assume Ownership of Public Utilities.\ The affirmative was argued by Paul Goldberg, '38 ·and Joseph Woolman, '35, while the negative was upheld by Collins McGovern, '36 and Char- les Reeves, '37. The decision was 2-1 in favor of the negative, The .purpose of this debate was to de- cide the pmticipants of the next radio encounter with Amherst on Feb1·uary 11th.

College section of the American In- Luhr, of the physics department, stitute of Electrical Engineers to Criticises Governing Group As Not Worth a Damn The nomination of class officers by the Student Council was criti- cized yesterday in Student Body meeting by George Stroebel, '35, who favored, instead of the present select nomination, the plan of open election, with the ten seniors the four juniors, and the three s~pho­ mores who receive the highest num- ber of votes being elected. In his denunciation he stated that the method of having a hand full of Stu- dent Council members select the nominees was undemocratic. Mr. Stroebel went further in his criticism, saying, \although I like the Council members personally as a governing gx:oup they are 'nat worth a damn.\ Accusations Answered In answer to these allegations Austin Fox '35, a member of the Student Council, avowed that ap- parently the students themselves took no interest in open nomina- tions, as was the case in the nomi- nation of the Junior Prom com- mittee and that the opportunity for political maneuvers would be too access! ble. Stroebel aslted for an explanation of how nominations were made by the Council and Ralph Semerad, '35, president of the Student Body, re- plied stating that apparent ability, campus activities and popularity, as well as \other considerations,\ de- termined the adequacy of the can- didate. These \other considerations\ be- came the center of discussion as Stroebel challenged Semerad to ex- plain these qualifications. So much time elapsed in the ensuing discus- sion, however, that Semerad had to adjourn the meeting until next Monday. _ Fox Interviewed Austin Fox in an interview after the meeting said that the attaclcs of Stroebel offered no constructive criticism, and in questioning the methods employed by the Student Council in deciding who should be candidates for nomination displayed ignorance that all candidates are chosen after careful consideration of both their scholastic and extra- curricular activity. The grades of every candidate are procured from the Dean's Office, he explained, and a proper survey as to his general characteristics is pursued. He argued that a small body can more ea.Sily and more comprehensively select. and come to agreement upon controversial matters than a large unwieldy body like that of 80() stu- dents. Closing the interview with these words . he said, \democracy functions well until it becomes too democratic.\ and Dr. Thomas Wilson of the TT\ • • TT. • •t .

Now those behind .Mr. Stroebel have found it expedient to change their g-oal and seek elections without nominations. This in itself is most undemocratic for any large group such as any one class of the undergraduate body. As pointed out yesterday morning, such a system would result in the most popu- lar men, and not the most capaule, l>eing elected to office.

Alumni Gift Fund, and next year the class of 1935 will be enrolled among tile alumni. Some gift of definite use to the college, preferably o.f intellectual tone, would be wel- comed by the Cblleg.e and would be a fine ges- ture by the class as a whole. There are sev- eral gifts which come to mind and almost anyone would be satisfactory and feasible. A scholarship fund is not unlikely for it would not take many years to build up the principal for a scholarship. There is a nota- ble lack of scholarships to offer to incoming freshmen and if Unio11 is to keep up to the pace set by Amherst, Williams and her other rivals, steps must be taken toward cr.ea ting more scholarships. Another appropriate gift would be the establishment of a fund for the purchase of books for the library. If this latter were done by the class the gift would materialize much sooner as the purchase of books could begin at once. One further gift th.at is withi.n the reach is the fact that the fraternity men It seems that the Mountebanks not foreseen •by the engineers in were the ones who were so vehem- have not given up the Ghost. charge of the work had been en- ently opposed to deals. * * * countered.

It was the first non-sectarian college in the United States and its charter still prohibits its control by any one church. The liberal spirit which marked its birth made Union a pioneer in educational reform. During the presidency of Dr. Eliphalet Nott, 1804 to 1866, there wa.s added to the usual classical curriculum a scientific course in 1828, instruction in civil .engineering was begun in 1845, and in 1854, chemistry was placed upon a technical basis. Thus from an early date scientific and. academic courses have run side by side at tUnion College, eaeh making its own contribution to the intellectual life on the campus. Union Colleg.e together with its graduate departments in Albany, sixteen miles distant, C<?nstitutes Union University. The graduate departments and the dates of their founding are: Albany Medical College, 1838; Albany Law School, 1851; Albany College of Phannacy, 1881; and the Dudley Obsel'Va- tory. The undergraduate courses at Union lead to the follow- ing degrees: Bochelor ol Arts Bachelor ol Science Bachelor of Science in Chemistry Bachelor of Science in Civil Engineering Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering Bachelor oF Science in Physics The Union campus of 97 acres, ove1·looking the Mohawk river and facing the Helderberg Mountains, is one of the beauty spots of the country.

As you said, it is ·by the student tax that the program of the Athletic department is in the main financed.

Tugwell Conducts t ts To Speak Initial In Spencer Forum In Lecture I Old Chapel Next Week __ _j ...... Vol. LVIII., No. 28 UNION COLLEGE, SCHENECTADY, N.Y., FRIDAY, JANUARY 18, 1935 PRICE FIVE CENTS Tugwell 'To Speak AtMemorialChapel• In Spencer Lecture··· Stroebel Interviewed Maintaining his stand on the unfa~ruess of the present system of Student Council nominations, George Stroebel '35, claimed in an interview today that the pres- •ence of only one neutral on the . Council is entirely unjust in the ' light of the fact that over forty \The Progressive Tradition\ Brain Truster New Deale1· Supporter of New Deal Cl'itieizes Old Order Rugged Individualism in \Battle For Democmcy\ .. per cent of the students are neutrals. Rexford G. Tugwell, under-secre- tary of agriculture, will be the sec- ond lecturer on the Ichabod Spen- cer Foundation series. :Mr. Tug- well's lecture is scheduled for one · week from tonight, in the Memoriat Chapel, on the topic, \The Pro- gressive Tradition.\ While admitting the proposal for no nominations at all which he made at Student Body meet- . ing last Monday to have as many weaknesses as the present· system, Stroebel nevertheless be- lieves that with .proper investi- gation a plan of proportional. representation might be evolved, giving representation to fratern- ities and neutrals in proportion to their number. Cooperation with the Student Council, he be- lieves, would probaply lead to a satisfactory compromise. \I would like to see Ralph Semerad appoint a committee to study possible alternatives,\ .he said. \.Such a 'body could com- prehensively study and thrash out the many possible methods without encountering the obstin- acy of open debate.\ Spencer lectures are held in the Old Chapel by custom, but it ·has been necessary to move this one to the newer and larger auditorium : because of the evidences of wide in- terest in the lecturer which :will probably result in a large crowd. Mr. Tugwell is a former .professor of Columbia University and has been a member of President Roose- velt's Brain Trust. His position as . under-secretary of agriculture was created for him, Critic of Ca,pitalism In recent speeches and writing Tugwell has .been an ardent sup- pol·ter of the New Deal and a fear- less critic of the old style capital- ism. His latest bool~; entitled \The Battle for Democracy\ appeared about ten days ago and contains some vigorous thrusts at the old order ot rugged individualism, which meant the regimentation of the many for the benefit ·Of tl1e few. He favors the new and higher kind of individualism which would free the many from the regimenta- tion of the few. Ml'. Tugwell was born in upstate New York. He was educated in Buffalo Public schools and la:ter at the University of Pennsylvania (Wharton School of Finance). He was on the faculty of Columbia university from 1920 until 1933 when he joined the Roosevelt ad- ministration. For the last two years of his career at Columbia he was a full professor. He is the au- thor of many bool(S and articles in- cluding the following: Economic Basis of Public Interest (1922); Trend of Economics U924l w-ith other authors; American Economic Life (1925 and 1930). ----•0•--- TaylOT, Abbett Appointed 'l'o Highway Survey Committee At the annual meeting of the American Society of Civil Engi- neers held in New York City yester- day and today, Warren C. Taylor, associate professor of civil engi- neering, and Ro•bert W, Abbett, as- sistant professor <>f .building con- struction, were appointed to the committee on Highway Surveying Codes. Mr. Taylor also attended the meeting of the New Yo.rk State Sewage Works Association which started Tuesd:ay and was continued on Wednesday in New York. He was appointed to the Research Committee of that organization. Acknowledging that chances of his passing the :proposed legis- lation past the necessary two- · thirds vote of the students were slim, Stroebel felt that at least a large number of students will have had a chance to show dis- satisfaction with the present system. Casts Selected For Two One .. Act Plays \Fl'iends\ and \Campbell of Kilmhor\ to Be First Stu- dio Presentation The casts for the two one-act prod11ctions of the Studio Players have .been cast with lhe exception of one female role and rehearsals wil1 begin on Monday at 7:30 p. m. Georg·e Stroebel '35, president of the Mountebanks, in making the announcement of the casts this morning, stated that no date has been set for the presentation, .but it will be decided upon as soon as the pace of the rehearsals can be de- termined. The two plays which were chosen are \Friends by Herbert Farjeon and \Camplbell of Kilmhor,\ by J. A. Ferguson. These plays will be ·directed by Stroebel and Harvey Groesbeck '35. BoLh of the direct- ors have had three and a hal!f years' experience under the direc- tion of Edward L. Carroll, director of the Mountebanks. Although the Studio Players is a subsidiary organization of the Mountebanks, Director Carroll of the parent organization has no duty other than that of adviser with the student enterprise. The Studio Players were organized three years ago and it was then de- cided that all directing and de- signing of sets would be done by the seniors in the Mountebanks.

Dr-. Fox devoted most of his ad- dress to the thesis that local history, or state hiswry, .is essential for a true understanding of national history. He .pointed out that na- tional movements grow out of states, that even fore,gn relations are affected by condit,ons in the states, State History In the development of his theme that OUl' scnool books as well as our more advanced study should be more concerned with staLe history if we are to get a true understand- ing of our national self, Dr. Fox said: \The American history that 'every school boy knows' is the history of Congress and the Presi- dents with some attention to the generals and a hasty paragrap.h or two upon the opening of the west. The writers are particular enough about each separate colony before the spring of 1775, indeed the text- books have quite generally neg- lected to point out th!'l ieatures common to all. But when Wash- ington has taken up his sword be- neath the Cambridge elm, or at least when he has taken the presi- dential oath in New York city, all attention is suddenly refocused, first on Philadelphia for the first few years and then for all time on the District of Columbia. The re- sult is a strange distortion.\ Careers Begun in States Dr. Fox then pointed out that great careers are begun in the states, not in Washington. \Na- tional movements, too, often grow out of situations in some state or states. How can one comprehend the Free Soil Party without a knowledge of the rupture in the Regency at Albany.\ Historians must seek to sense the peculiar culture of each section in times past before they can trace by what processes of syncretism a general American ta:ste has been developed.

It will be remembered that the initiation fee was attacked as exorbitant by The Concordrensis during the fall.

Cohen Friday, January 18, 1935 CHEERS AND JEERS Judging from past performance we can reasonably expect a spectacle of rowdyism from the hands of our neighbors in Troy with whom we are playing basketball tomor- row night in our own gymnasium. If mem- ory serves correctly they visited us last year with all sorts of jeering contraptions and put on an exhibition which was worthy of an ordinary high school. What will happen to- morrow night remains to be seen, but it would be wise if the students of this college would take it upon themselves to put on a performance which would be a direct anti- thesis of the one staged by our rivals a year ago. This is not necessary as a request, but merely a reminder that it will be desirable if Union students are on their best behavior tomorrow night. Some day, we hope, a bas- ketball game v.-ill be staged between the two institutions where clean sport will be exhibit- ed in the stands as well as on the floor. We understand that there will be some distinguished guests on the campus for the weekend. In order that the.se guests may re- ceive a favorable impression of the college it would be well if the readers of this article would bear the facts in mind and consider them tomorrow night. It is not necessary to go into a complete review of what has happened when the two institutions have met on the athletic field before. The memory is fresh in our minds of what happened at the football game in November. Slightly less remote to our mem- ory are the incidents of last year which nearly resulted in a severance of athletic re- lations between the two institutions. We are looking forward to a good game tomorrow night. It is up to the student body to do its part and suppor~ the team lustily and be as sporting as are the players of both teams themselves. .. , THE CONCORDIENSIS, FRIDAY, JA:NUARY 18, 1935 ATHLETICS FOR ALL THE COLLEGE WORLD AROUND THE WORLD· By FRED FELDMAN By RICHARD SNYDER In a recent address in Schenectady Andy Kerr, famous football coach at Colgate, stated that the athletic programs at the up~ There was; once_ upon a time, a I of the c~usa~e against col!ege ·dolts High Nazi officials attempted to state college, including intercollegiate and glorious crusade m the world to and umverSlty tomnodd1es - the keep the meeting ·of <the pa.rty in intramural, enabled n1nety percent of the fight mightily against the only evil struggle against over-education the former state Oper:;t.

INCREASING UNION'S SCOPE Last weelt: the esteemahle Gazette announced that in the opinion of 424 leading critics of the country \The Barretts of Wimpole Street\ was the best picture of the year. It will be a surpri'se to many to find that we have so many \leading critics\ in the country. As I re- member at the time that this pic- ture was playing many people com- plained that it put them to sleep. This effect while very met·itorious is scarcely compatible with first rating. The picture was a well made thing and Laughton, though I don't particularly care for him, did a very good job. However, it was not the best picture of the year.

The Garnet year- lings closed in on the boys from Massachusetts in the laJSt period to come within a pont of tying the score. \Vithin the last five minutes of the game five points were scored by the two tea.ms, with Lenox tak- ing the advantage. Bill Butler, center on the Yellow and Black tea1n, a11d Gordon Reese, left wing, formed the ape.'t of the attack which the Len{)X team kept up throughout the game. Although the ice on the Mohawk rink was a •bit soft, the two teams gathered speed: in the second and third periods, mal{ing all their points then. Evenly matched during the con- test the sextets •battled back and forth for the puck. Butler shot the first point in the second period, and shortly a.fterward, Jim Bond tallied fol\ the Garnet after an ac- curate pass from Harrison Beal. No more scoring was done until the middle of the last frame when the Lenox team began to click, shooting two goals in less than 10 seconds and another a minute later. Hol- lins, Reese, and Upham were re- sponsible for these points. Union returned strongly, and some nice blocking and shooting ·by Fred Hawley and Beal accounted: for two more Garnet tallies.

P. I. freshmen. Al- though they have played several practice games against the varsity teams, the yearlings have yet to encounter their first official oppo- nent. Coach Hatfield is confident that , his- charges will give a good account · .of themselves in tomorrow's fray. The Rensselaer cubs have lost their first three games, including two to Lansingburgh High and Troy High. The Garnet cubs make a tall, : rangy team, fast-moving on the . offensive. Most of the men have had experience on high and prep school teams. Philip Duchscherer and Ted Podbielski will probably start in the forward positions f()cr• U~on. Grant Smith will start in the pivot position, and Johnny Schultz, Vincent Smith,. Lenny Schultz, and Charles McCarthy are the choices for the guard positions. Last Saturday the freshmen de-· feated a pick-up team, the All-Stars, in a preliminary game by an over- whelming score. The defeats which the cubs have also administered to the varsity rese!\Ves spealt well for the Frosh chances tomorrow night.

It was the first non-sectarian cQllege in the United States and its charter still prohibits its control by any one chm·ch. The liberal spirit whlch marked its birth made Union a pioneer in educational reform. During the presidency of Dr. Eliphalet Nott, 1804 to 1866, there was added to the usual classical curriculum a scientific course in 1828, instruction in civil .engineering was begun in 1845, and in 1854, chemistry was placed upon a technical basis. Thus from an early date scientific and academic courses have run side by side at Union CGllege, each making its own contribution to the intellectual life on the campus. Union Colleg.e together with its graduate departments in Albany, sixteen miles distant, constitutes Union University. The gTaduate departments and the dates Qf their founding are: Albany Medical College, 1838; Albany Law School, 1851; Albany College of Pharmacy, 1881; and th.e Dudley Observa- tory. The undergraduate courses at Union lead to the follow- ing degrees: Bachelor of Arts Bachelor of Science Bachelor of Science in Chemistry Bachelor of Science in Civil Engineering Bachelorr of Science in Electrical Engineering Bachelor of Science in Physics The Union campus of 97 acres, overlooking the Mohawk river and facing the Helderberg Mountains, is one of the beauty spots of the country. Information regarding .enbance requirements may be obtained from C. N. Waldron, secretary of Union College, Schenectady, N. Y.

The married woman in 1800 could own no property, run no busi- ness. No woman could be even the treasurer of her church sewing circle unless there were a man ready to endorse her signature at the bank. She was in almost every respect civilly dead. Her education was neglected, but her morals and duties were strictly laid out, he continued. She was not expected to be the mental peer of her brethers, her role, according to a ladies book of the period, was \Be inconspicuous,\ As long as she was sympathetic a:nd lovely, her brains did not count. But today, she is man's equal in almost every field. ---0--- CONCORDIENSIS NOTICE .All members of the Concordiensis staff are expected to attend the regular meeting held each Thurs- day at 1:15 o'clock.

The title of his presentation was \.Audible Light.\ His voice, phonograph records, a radio program of Ed Wynn, and many sources of light having varia- tions of intensity visible and not visible to the naked eye, were in- troduced before the photo-electric cell, passed through the amplifier, and made audible to the audience. All the phenomena were very in- teresting and some of them very amusing. The following students were elected to the Executive Commit- tee: C. M. Rhoades Jr., class of '35; W. B. Plummer, class of '36; and H. Knack of the class of '37. Visitors from the neighboring school, Rensselaer Polytechnic In- stitute, were present, and the faculty was well represented. Semester Ends Tuesday, New Seating Lists to Be Issued The second semester of chapel begins on Tuesday, January 22, it was announced this morning by Dr. Dixon Ryan Fox. For this second semester the seating arrangements of the respective class groups will be reversed so that those now seat- ed in the front of the building will be seated in the rear. In order to facilitate the making of these changes, new seating lists will be posted in the entrance to the Mem- orial Chapel. An in1ormal meeting of the col- lege chaptol\ of Sigma Xi held Tuesday evening in the Geology lecture room was featured by three speeches rela.ting to the Pittsburgh meeting of the American Associa- tion for the Advancement of Sci- ence. Dr. i!I!dward Ellery, chairman of the faculty, spoke on the highlights of the convention. Dr. Peter I. Wold, professor of physics, discuss- ed phases of the meeting of the American Physical Society giving a report of the symposium on heavy hydrogen ancl its compounds. He also spoke on Dr. Millikan's lecture on the cosmic ray, and DI'. Knud- sons' paper on the absorbtion of sound 1n gases, which won the asso- ciation's $:1,000 prize. Dr. Ernest E. Dale, assistant prol!essor of biology, told of the genetic session of the meeting.

Tugwell was instructor in Econo- controversy. Argument Declared Fruitless \We're not getting anywhere arguing back and forth in student body meeting,\ Stroebel said. \A small committee could accomplish much more; but all the various fac- tions should be represented on this committee. I suggest that there be three councilmen and three n(}n- councilmen, including at least one neutral, appointed. \We don't. think our plan is the best one possible, but it is better than the present system,\ Stroebel added amid loud applause, \and the committee's recommendation should be even better.\ Horwitz Made Chairman The proposal was greeted with enthusiasm, and President Semerad promptly appointed the committee consisting of Seymour Horwitz, chairman; William Waldron, James Loomis, George Stroebel and Albert Morrison, all of the Class of 1935, and Robert North and Douglas Lambeth, Class of '36. Waldron, LoGmis, and North are members of the Student Council; Stroebel and Horwitz have been active in the recent reform movement; Morrison and Lambeth are neutrals. The movement for revision began at a meeting of the student body in December when Stroebel asked for an amendment to the constitution of the student body permitting each class to nominate as well as elect its representatives to the Student Council. Last week, Stroebel re- stated the proposed amendment to prGvide for direct elections, elimi- nating nominations entirely. Spealting from the point of view ot an employer·, Mr. Trench sum- med up four qualities which he would look fot· in a: college grad- uate applying for a job: scholar- ship, leadership, general personal fitness, and common sense. \vVe want men who are in the highest 25% of their class and who exhibit some signs of leadership as shown by their extra-curricula!' a'C· tivities,\ he said. \We also expect the general impression of fitness which goes with clothes, neatness of personal habits, etc. Lastly, the college man who wants a job should have some idea of what a dolla:r is worth, it's utili1y and it's limitations. We call that common sense.\ What lhe interviewer is really trying to learn, when he questions a college graduate is whether he has madtJ a success of his college life, M•. Trench explained. Dt\pt>nde on OuP Fa<'tol' \College success,\ continued Mr. Trench, \depends upon one factor, and tha:t is the selection of the things on which you spend your time and energy. Unless we put these personal t·esources to work wisely and carefully, we will all be failures, whethet· we are in college or business, or anywhere else:· The fact that many men think of college as separate from their life 1fter gltlduation, is responsible for many failures, Mr. Trench conclud- ed. \There is a continuity betweE'n your wotl{. in college and your work ·1ftenvard. You cannot ignot<> this fact and say with a shrug-, 'Oh, well, when college is over I'll PettlE' down to work'. College lifo is not a thing apart.

Al- though an accomplished exposito1 of the theory of planned economy as embodied in the industrial con- trol bill, the young professor is far prouder of his critique of the works of Thomas Hardy. \A liberal but not a radical,\ is the self-classification of Dr. Tug- well who states that a liberal is one wh(} is content to experiment in reconstruction of economic in- stitutions, while a radical is one who insists on \revolutionary tactics.\ According to his own statement, the youthful brain- truster is opposed to these radical tactics. Dr. TugwEll was one of the orig- inal members of the much-discussed Brain Trust, and as such has been very active in the formation of much New Deal legislation. Ex- pexts have ventured that next to Professor Raymond Moley he ex- erted the most influence on the policies Qf the administration. Many will recall the charges made by Dr. William W!rt to the effect that Dr. Tugwell was ODE' of the leaders in radic-al revolution to socialize the nation. This rift was the outcome of a split in the Brain Trust, with Dr. Moley and Dr. Tug- well forming the left wing and Donald Richberg and Secretary of State Hull the major members <>f the opposition, or conservative ele- ment. So important was Dr. Tugwell's work on the recent Pure Food and Drug- Act, that il is his name that supersedes Senatot· Copeland's, even though the New Yorker first introduced the bill. Union C<>llege students are fortun- ate to be able to hear Dr. Tugwell twice, since he .plans to remain overnight and addre::;s chapel on Saturday morning. Befote chapel, he will interview two delegates to the Model League of Nations kl- sembly. Sjnce planned economy is on the agenda, Dr. Tugwell will be asked his opinion of the various phases of international econQmic relations on which he is an expert. ----0·--- Plaza All-College P1·ogram Postponed Until Jan. 30 Due to the apparent lack of in- terest In the All-College night which is being sponsored by the Plaza theater, this event has been postponed until Wednesday, Janu- ary 30.

Smith, instructot ot English recently in speaking about the mordernist writers who have adopted the \Cult of Unintel- ligibility.\ The movement of \modernism\ in pr·e.sent day literature \is pt>rhaps stimulating because it forces us to reconsider basic principlE's, · bu< so far none of these writer!<, with the dubious exception of Joyce, <'an put in even a putatiYe claim to literary cminincnce,\ Mr. Smith said. \In one sense the cult of unintel· ligibility is a teflection in literature of the chaolic distruhances which are wtacking the world in ,;o many other directions a;; well.

The petitioners had the endorsement of Cornell, Hobart, Syracuse and Toronto, who make up the Second Province.

W eek•s Best Editorial THE RADICAL FISH \Beds Throng Big Colleges, Says l!'ish.\ So reads a headline in the New Yorlt Journal, the article itself stating that Representative Hamil- ton Fish of New York characterized \ten leading colleges in the United States as 'hotbeds' of subversive ac- tivities.\ Mr. Fish named the fol- lowing hotbeds: Harvard, Vassar, C. C. N.Y., Columbia, Smith, Wes- leyan, Chicago, Wisconsin, Califor- nia, and Washington. Furthermore, he stated that Wesleyan was among the eastern colleges that \have shown a marked increase in both Communist and Socialist activities.\ The statement is amusing. Hav- ing been here but once in his life, and then for but a few hours, Mr. Fish hardly seems qualified to analyze us, particularly In so dog- matic a statement as he is credited with. (Wasn't Mr. Fish the speaker who said his only bond with Wes- leyan lay in that he, too, was la- menting the poor football record of his Alma Mater?) Again, it seems questionable whether Mr. Fish is familiar with even a quarter of the colleges of the country. Offhand, we are tempted to say that he is exceptional if his acquaintance with 1() colleges is more than a bowing one. In the brief hours that he was on the campus---he came in a hurry and left in a hurry-he was evi- dently able to analyze the college body as one of the 10 most radical lp. the country! That inference is a hard one to accept. We are more inclined to accept the results of the poll of 97 under- graduates taking Economics courses as indicating the true political and economic beliefs of the Wesleyan undergraduate-our proverbial Joe. He is \sympathetic with progres- sive political and economic pro- grams,\ but radicalism he does not endorse. The poll indicating changes in political faith caused by the Parley s~milarly indicates a sympathy with ideas. Socialists and Individualistic Democrats are numerically equal; of the 319 votes tabulated, 275 were still on the con- servative side of Socialism. And the report failed to indicate the many votes for \Robocracy\, \Stoopnocracy\, and other would-be humorous political faithsj the exist- ence of such answers alone seems to indicate that many a Wesleyan undergraduate is not very serious- nor radical-in his political lean- Ings. Now that Representative Fish has had his little joke-for what eLse could it •be?-it seems time to correct the erroneous impression before it becomes further publi- cized. Wesleyan radical? Hardly. The truth of the matter seems to indicate that Representative Fish is the radical one. Funlt and Wag- naBs tells us that a radical is \one who carries his ideas to their furth- est application; an extremist.\ Whatever idea Mr. Fish originally had regarding the political faith of the college body, he most certainly has carried it to its furthest-and most ridiculous-application. -The Wesleyan Argus. her concert in T:roy, April 25.

With renewed hopes of taking its first victory this season, Union kept close to its strong com- petitor during the first part of the meet. The score at the middle of the contest was 13 to 23 in favor of the Purple team. Garnet Loses; Ground In the ·backstroke and breast- stroke, however, the boys from Wil liamstown took the only good places. The Dutchmen were pushed farther •back. Captain Guy Gris- wold came through in the 100-yard dash to beat out Sawyer for second place, but the Williams team had already piled up too many points to allow any hopes for a Union victory. In the dives Bill Keens, Union's star fancy diver, led until the last three tries. Then Roberts of Wil- liams scored heavily on some ex- cellent springboard exhibitions. .A back half-gaynor netted him 13 points, the highest given at .the meet Saturday.

COMPANY. INC. 147 JAY STREET Schenectady, New York UNION COLLEGE received its name from the circumstances that several relig- ious denominations co-operated in its organization in 1795. It was the first non-sectarian college in the United States and its eharter still prohibits its control by any one church. The liberal spirit which marked its birth made Union a pioneer in educational reform. During the presidency of Dr. Eliphalet Nott, 1804 to 1866, there was added to the usual classical curriculum a scientific course in 1828, instruction in dvil engineering was begun in 1845, and in 1854:, chemistry was placed upon a technical basis. Thus from an early date scientific and academic courses have run side by side at •Union College, each making its own contribution to the intellectual life on the campus. Union College together with its graduate departments in Alb:my, sixteen miles distant, constitutes Union University. The graduate departments and the dates of their founding are: Albany Medical College, 1838; Albany Law School, 1851 ; Albany College of Pharmacy, 1881; and th.e Dudley Observa- tory. The undergraduate cou1·ses at Union lead to the follow- ing dep·ees : Bachelor of Arts Bachelor of Science Bachelor of Science in Chemistry Bachelor of Science in Civil Engineering Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering Bachelor of Science in Physics The Union campus of 97 acres, overlooking the Mohawk river and facing the Helderberg Mountains, is one of the beauty spots of the country.

Besides hav- ing been a member of tlle highly touted Brain Trust, Dr. Tugwell was very l}lUch inter!lsted in the at- tack against the Pure :Food and Drug Act, which he wishes to amend and to make more severe. He has also been very much inter- ested in public services, and has at- tempted to manifest his s()holarship for this cause.

Feldman Friday, January 25, 1935 NO ACTION TAKEN What has become of the Student Council committee that was looking into the possi- bilities of a revised rushing system'? We have neither seen nor heard of a report from that committee which was appointed in No-vember. The appointment of such a committee indicates that the Student Council feels that In order to relieve the g-en.eral college budg-et, there is the alumni gift fund which has provided more than one hundred thou- sand dollars during the past twelve years ~n recent years most of that money has been turned over to the student loan fund. Added to these are the larger gifts such as those mentioned in today's Concordiensis. Colleges survive by the very generosity of its friends. For the stu.dent body, we thank Union's many kind donors who have turned necessary improvements into realities; who have provided so that future sons of Union will receive financial aid; and lastly, those who have increased the educational facilities of the college.

The lineups and summary: SYRACUSE (2S) FG FP Pts Gu!ey, rf ....•....... 2 Mlnsavage, rf .... , .. 0 0 0 4 0 Although five of the eight letter- men from last year's Army hockey sextet were graduated in June, the team this year has won two of the three games played. The number of cadets who were !'eserves last year or on the pJe·be squad were sufficient to form a team and two sets of spares of nearly equal abil- ity. Union will seek its first victory from the soldiers, and will try to make up fDr its defeat at the hands of the Williams team last week. The game with the Purple brought out many defects in the teamwork of the Garnet squad. Coaches Leonard and Achilles have been de- voting the past cold week to the strengthening of the defensive and offensive plays. Maxwell ·Tinchor, a plebe last year, and Bill Grohs and Gordon Holterman of last year's reserve line, are the leading .players on the Army squad about whom Coach Ray Marchand has built his team. Army lost its opener to Colgate, 2 to 0, ·but redeemed itself in the next two games with wins over M. 1. T. and Massachusetts State. Last year the Cadets obtained a 4 to 3 victory over the Garnet squad, and it is the belief of the Union coaches that \Army will know tomorrow that Union has .been in the game.\ With nine regulars who see al- most a full game of action, the Union linup for the game tomorrow is still uncertain, either \Doc\ Orton or Bolb Warner will start at left wing, 'Summerhays or Bergman at rig-ht vving, and John Emans or Captain Bill Jenkins at center.

The income fl'om this fund will be used for two scholarships to: be awaFded on conditions to be an- nounced later, after the donor has had an opportunity to consult fur-· ther with President Fox. Other gifts included $1,400 from Mrs. 'Walter C: Baker and $500 from Mr. and Mrs. Frank Bailey, both oi New York, for rPnovating and re· furnishing the offices of the presi- dent and. secretary in the Admin- istration building; a gift of $75C from Dr. E.

Mr. Elmort• McKee, Rector of the Trinity Church of Buffalo since 1930, will speak at the chapel services Sunday morning at 11:15 o'clock. Mr. McKee was graduated from the Taft School in 1914 and from Yale University in 1919. He re- ceived his t1ainmg for the ministr) at the Yale Divinity School, from which he was graduated in 1921. The following year as travelling fellow of the Yale Divinity School he studied in the Graduate School of Edinburgh University. He served as curate in St. John's Church, Waterbury, Conn., for eighteen months, and in 1924 became rector of St. Paul's Church in New Haven, Conn. ln 1927 Mr. McKee became Chaplain of Yale University, during which time he preached frequently in the Yale Chapel and also at col- leges and schools in the East. He resigned in 1930 when he accepted the rectorship of the Trinity Church of Buffalo. Mr. McKee is the editor of two volumes of sermon:>, \Preaching in the New Era\ and \What Can Stu- dents Believe?\; and ha:o publi,;hed ''Communion With God,\ a collec- tion of prayers for chapel. pastor a!. and private use. Ideas and Moral Courag( Emphasized by Dr. Cooper \The mental courage to stand by what you think is right is on a plane much higher than physical courage,\ asserted Dr. Herman Cooper, regent of the University of the State of New York Wednesday morning before the student body. \America needs young men with Ideas and the moral courage to stand behind those ideas,\ he said. \The world today seems to be pre- paring for leisure and is consider- ing work as a thing of the past, but great achievement is the result of great sacrifice, and a good idea is the result of years of mighty hard work.\ Dr. Cooper declared that men of today do very little real thinking. The invention of modern conven- iences has enhanced man's lazy habits: he can listen without any difficulty to the comfortable views expounded over the radio, without any mental effort. \Only under pressure does man work fast, and there are a very few that work fast under their own initiative.

In the fiscal year 1933- 3fr the Federal Government collected $425,000,000 from the tax on tobacco. Most of this came from cigarettes - six cents tax on every package of twenty.

No one !mows better than I how small the actual accompli:shments of this ad· ministration have been up to now.

There was little thought for the future 01· of -build- ing for better life.\ Position of Lobbyist Dr. Tugwell then made a few observations which he said \may be of service.\ Lobbyists are one of the most significant adjunct:IS of present day government. They owe their allegiance to the voters and taxpayers, but since contact with them is difficult, they exist more in the abstract than in the flesh. \But the lohbyist exists very much in the flesh. He is always present and is very pleasant so long as you do nothing which disturbs the priv- eleges of his employers, but an of- ficial soon learns that the quickest retribution ensues upon his displeas- ure. He learns that the easy way to get along is to plaeate t h!' lob- byists.

Dr. Edwin Wilbur Rice, jr., chair- man emeritus of the Board of Trus- te.>es, was born in LaCresse, Wis- consin, May 6, 1862, the son of Dr. Edwin W. Rice, Union '54. Dr. Rice came into the electrical industry when both he and it were young-. Shortly after g-raduating from the Boys' Central High School of Philadelphia, he became assistant to Professor Elihu Thomson, famous for his pioneering with the arc light and alternating current. In 1883 they went to Lynn, Mass., when the Thomson-Houston Electx ic Co. was formed, and Mr. Rice, at the age .of ~1, became plant manager. In 11192, when the General Electric was organized, he was made chief engi- neer and technical director, eventu- ally becoming second vice-president, and serving as p1 esident from 1913 to 1922. He was chiefly responsible for the 1 esearch laboratory and the develop- ment of the Curtil's turbine at Gen- eral Electric, and was also largely instrumental in securing the services of the late Dr. Steinmetz. Dr. Rice has received degrees from Harvard, the University of Pennsylvania, R. P. I., and Union. He is also a Chevalier in the French Legion of Honor and a member of the Japanese Order of the Rising Sun. Lilrewise, Dr. Rice has been for a number of years a fellow in tlle · American Academy of Science, ln which body he has been very active. After serving on the Union College Board of Trustees for over thirty years, Dr. Rice was tendered the chairmanship in January 1931 which office re accepted. His resignation was reluctantly accepted in June, 1934, but he is still on the executive committee of the Board. Dr. Rice was succeeded in the capacity of chairman by the prese.>nt incumbent, Dr. Hiram Todd.

The inquiries are, in addition, rnore numerous than at a,ny time in the past five years, From time to time vario1.1s edu cators and essayists con:te to the fore with the my that the colleges :11 e too crowded. The professions ~an not support the men already liained for them, let alone absorh the horde of gra:duates who jump into the strife of life in search of a livelihood. Perhaps these men who criticize education fo1· the masses are correct in asking fm education only for the select. Yet if by failing to open education to the masses they hope to lessen the competition in the professions, they might also consider W'hat is to be come of those youths deprived of an education. Aro the unskilled tril:des less c1owded than the professions? Does it increase the standard of living to have a greater nurnbe1· of less educated men, even it these men find work not requiring years of preparation? T1 ue, one must admit that those who prepare for a give·n calling a:nd are never able to engage in it perhaps grow des pendent and lose some ambition There is a tremendous social waste of trained men who rnust face the fact that their technical training may never be utilized in their chosen professions. l3ut ca:n one lose an analytical mind, the know ledge of what is worthwhile and how to live with a full appreciation of the best in life? In the United States at present there is one who has college train ing in every forty-four people. In percentage this means 2.2% of our total population is college trained. In England the percentage is only l'ir of the entire population. Eng- land has more rigid qttalifications than the United States. There are social barriers to be surmounted the expense is greater. Our colleges have opened their doors to all who are willing to study a11d have the ability and means to partall:e of an education. The percentage of col lege graduates increases yearly. In England the percentage remains the same. Are we in the United States any worse off than England in any way? Her students are se- lected and kept stationary in num- bers; ours are not so rigorously se- lected socially, and we do not try to limit their numbers if they have the a:bility to pass the require- ments. Perhaps education for the masses is not to be scorned when the henefits are weighed and found in surplus. -The Colgate Mar()on. r I G ( bl tl: il1 w Y' F S( oJ e1 .b tl t• s ( t s '] l

Faelten and Steatns again repeat- ed their act in the 440 event, after trailing the two 'Tute swimmers, R. Smith and Thompson, by taking the first two places. Keens in the dives a-ave Union more of an advantage, and R. P. I. was behind by 16 points. Before the 100 yard event R. P.

Everything depending upon whether Union won a first place or not in order to secure tht> winning point, Griswold outdis- tanced Sanborn and Geise in the 100 yard dash to clinch the m£>et for Union. Without a care the Garnet relay team lost its race against the 'Tute team. Gordon Holterman, assisted by Donohue, sc01ed the first goal late in the first period. The next tallies came towards the end of the second frame after Union had constantly threatened, with many poor shots, the Army cage.

COR, RTA'fE AND RROADWAY College Seal Jewelry Fountain Pens \The poet is an extraordinarily sensitive instrument upon which the most fleeting and the most pro- found aspects of human and nat- ural experience are recorded,\ stated Dr. Bertrand M. Wainger, assistant prbfessor of English re- cently in tb.e third in a series of six book talks arranged by the Al- bany Public Library at Albany. He illustrated several points in his talk on the \Human Values in Poetry\ with readings from Modern English and American poets. VISIT THE ENLARGED TAP ROOM Dr. Wainger said in part: \In his effort to elqlress these recordings, the poet strains the inadequate means provided by language--he coins words, inverts word order, em- ploys figures of speech--and poetry is therefore 'difficult' reading. \The reader must meet the poet half way, by carefully studying the language and by filling out the · hints and clues in the poem from the resources of his own experien.ce. In that sense the reader recreates the poem every time he reads it. The ultimate values achieved are easily worth the effort: a keener sensitiveness to experience, a deeper infllght into the values of life--in short, an education in the high_est sense of the word.\ GOLo·s SCHENECTADY'S POPULAR RENDEZVOUS Gazette Press Pennants Leather Goods OUR NEW LINE CIGARETTES and SMOKING TOBACCO Hours-8 :45 - 12:00. 1:15 - 5:00 collegians.

. ! Four Work of Professors Will Be Published Rep4lrt of Members of Physics Department to Be Printed By Learned Journals Four members of the Physics de- partment have received noti.ce f.rom editors of learned journals who are to publish articles in forthco:tning issues upon the work done by Doc- tors Peter I. Wold, F1·ank J. Stu- der, Everett W. Thatcher and Over- ton Luhr. These men reported their findings at the recent A. A. A. S. convention in Pittsburgh. The Journal of Chemical Review will contain Dr. Wold's \illquation of Waves m Media with Velocity Varying with Time,\ which relates to certain theories which •Dr. Wold has been proposing and studying in' connection with the so-called \ex- panding universe.\ The question as: to whether the universe is indeed: expanding, as is urged by some scientists, is a moot question. Dr. Wold is disposed .to hold to the view that the experimental observations do not necessarily require such an interpretation. Thatchl'l' RepresentPd Dr. Thatcher's \Multiple Space Charge in. Double and Triple Grid Tubes\ will be published in the Journal of Chemical Physics. The article is a description and explan- ation of certain phenomena. in vac- uum tubes which have l>een ob- served by Dr. Thatcher and to which he has been giving much study during the last two years. The phenomena is of substantial in- terest in the field of vacuum tubes used as amplifiers and for other purposes. \The Hall Effect in Eodiurn, Po- tassium and Cecsium\ a report by Dr. Studer and Mr. William. D. Wil- liams, '32, who received his Master's degree in Physics at Union last June, will appear in the Journal of Physical Review. The work con- nects up with studies being carried on in the Physics department on the problem of conduction of elec- tricity through metals, Articlo by Lulu A report, \Triatomic Ions in Mix- ture of Hydrogen Isotopes.\ which relates to the experimental work carried on by DT. Luhr last year while at Massachusetts Institute of Technology will be printed in Phys~ ics. The article deals with the an- alysis of ions in mixtures of hydro- gen and deuteron. This latter is a new element, sometimes called \heayy hydrogen,\ which has the same chemical properties as ordi- nary hydrogen but has an atomic weight of 2. Under certain condi- tions Dr. Luhr found in such mix- tures a certain amount of Ions of atomic weights 3, 4, and 5, these be- ing combinations of hydrogen atoms or hydrogen with deuterium.

SCHENECTADY ENGRAVING COMPANY, l:Nc. 147 JAY STREET Schenectady, New York UNION COLLEGE received its name from the circumstances that several relig- ious denominations co-operated in its organization in 1795. It was the first non-sectarian college in the United States and its charter still prohibits its contl'ol by any one church. The liberal spil·it which marked its bhth made Union a pioneer in educational reform. During the presidency of Dr. Eliphalet Nott, 1804 to 1866, there was added to the usual classical curriculum a scientific course in 1828, instruction in civil .engineering was begun in 1845, and in 1854, chemistry was placed upon a teehnical basis. Thus from an early date scientific and academic courses have run side by side at .Union College, each making its own contribution to the intellectual life on the campus. Union College together with its graduate depa1tments in Albany, sixteen miles distant, constitutes Union University. The graduate departments and the dates of their founding are: Albany Medical College, 1838 ; Albany Law School, 1851; Albany College of Pharmacy, 1881; and the Dudley Observa- toJ·y. The undergTaduate courses at Union lead to the follow- ing degt·ees: Bachelor of Arts Bachelor of Science Bachelor of Science in Chemistry Bachelor of Science in Civil Engineering Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering Bachelor of Scieace in Physics The Union campus of 97 acres, ov:e1·looking the Mohawk river and facing the Helderberg Mountains, is one of the beauty spots of the country.
