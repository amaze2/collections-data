With its ingenious situations, ·broad humor, and gorgeous costuming and setting, it will be the most colorful comedy that the Mounte- banks· have presented in the past tew years. The story is of one Colonel Fain- well, an English officer on half pay, who is determined to better his for·- tunes, which are sadly in need ol 1t. \Vhile at Eath, he has met a lady whom the original dramati~ personae naively calls \A Fortune u1 Thirty Thousand Pounds\ Mis- tress Anne Lovely, and attracted almost as much by her chlLrms as by her finance,;, he propose::> mat- riage. Guardians an Obstaele Although the lady is willing, she has four guardians who must con- S<:'nt to her marriage, and who are notorious for their inability to agTee on any point whatsoever. T!lerefore the Colonel must needs set himself out to make \the bold stroke\. With the assistance of a friend, Freeman, and an innkeeper, Sack- but, he outwits Sir Phili-p Modelove, an old fop; Periwinkle, an anti- quary; Tradelove, a merchant, and Obadiah Prim, a quaker hosier. These four guardians are so de- lighted to see each other tricked that they grudgingly consent to give him the girl. Costwning Varied The costumings for the play range in variety from the broadest and flashiest of fashions worn 'by Sir Philip to the quaker's sober gray, and from the Colonel's swag- gering regimentals to the antiquat- ed garb of Periwinkle. Settings, designed by Anton Swyka and S. Ralph Cohen, are being painted a light lettuce-g-reen with decorations in bright colors. · The women's par,ts in•·the play will be ·filled by women for the first time in :;;even years. Mrs. Philip Sayles will play the part of Anne Lovely, and Miss Ellen Dewey will play Mrs. Prim.

Harold Witt- ner, director of athletics this morn- ing. This is the second change made in the price scale within three weeks. General admission was re- duced from $1.10 to 55 cents about a week before the game with Ver- mont. The first cha:nge was made in re- sponse to the numerous requests that had been made for a revision in the price scale for admission to football ga!lles. The success of the first reduction ls believed to be the cause fot• the additional change. CAI\ENDAR •.ro1norrow Daily Assembly-Professor J. S.

Delta Upsilon Founded As Protest Against Secret Campus Societies By ROBERT C. NORTH When the centennial celebration of the founding of Delta Upsilon was observed at Williams College this September, the fraternity had grown from a small group of stu- d£.onts who in 1834 felt that secret campus organil'lations had become cluttered with meaningless mystery, to the well-developed organization which exists today in 61 colleges and universities in Canada a;nd the UnitEd States. S<>on after the Williams Chapter had been organized under the name of .the \Social Fraternity\ a similar grou..p at Union fanned the Equit- able Union\ a society built upon the same ideals, and endowed with the same purposes. The founders of Delta Upsilon felt that secret societies had formed themselves with the sole Idea of mon'Opolizing campus honors and controlling extra.-cw·ricular activi- ties. In 1847 the Union Chapter called a convention at Troy. In that city organizations from Hamilt<m, and Amherst joined with the Will- ·iams and Union Chapters in draw- ing up the Articles of Confederation and forming the \Anti-Secret Soci- ety\. This name was used u11til tbe name of Delta Upsilon was adopted In 1864. Incorporated witJ1in the frater- aity- were four main purposes, the promotion of friendship, the de- •;elopmenl of ch.aJacter, the diffu- sion of liberal culture, and the ad- vancement of justice. Practically e\\o·ery meeting centered about the discussion of some social, religious or political quest.ion which was be: f?re the student. body or the na- tion. The Texan and Mexican dis- .putes, the growth. of peace societies, and the trend towar-d abolition were a few of the topics debated. In 1864: the fraternity adopted a moderate tone In regard to secrecy. The chapters felt that secret or- ganizations had· for the most part ceased their menacing attitude and !-hat a new relationship was grow- mg up among ca.mpus societies. In 1881 Delta Upsilon formaily abol- ished the idea of an ti·secrecy, al- though the fraternity itself continu- ed to function as a non-secret so- ciety. In the meantime the fraternity- ?ad been establishing new chapters m other eastern institutions In 1867 \Our Re<eor-d\. the first ~f all fraternity magazines and the fore- runner of the .prc_sent \Quarterly\, was founded to 'bind the scattered: chapters togethe:r. Since its incor-poration under the laws of New York state in 1909 Delta Upsilon has expanded to th~ south and west and into leading Canadian institutions.

To Race Yellowjackets Tomorrow RADIO CLUB At the regular meeting of the Garnet Harriers Expect~d To Meet Stiff Opposition ------~-------- · Radio Club, Tuesday, November 6, Rochester, With Triumphs Over Hobart and Ham= ilton, Seeks Third Straight Victory in First Meet On Home Course ~---·----~--- Coach Blll Ketz's varsity harriers are set to meet one of the toughest : teams on their schedule tomorrow afternoon at Rochester. The Ro- chester cross-countty squad has won its two meets so far against HobaH •and Hamilton, defeating the : first by a perfect score, and the second, 16-39: Last week R. P. I. presented a · much .:;tronger f1onl than was ex- pected from the Tech runners, and the Ga1net team was .pw,hed all the way. Tomorrow the Dutchmen have no illusions as to the t.Hfficulty in overcoiiling the Yel!owjacketH. ·l:J. of R..'s Fh-st Home Meet Both teams will be running on, the full Rochester couF:;e for the first time this yea,r in college com- petition, for the Rjvermen have run . all their races away ftom home.

I nlproving Fast .·>1. ,,. :··-,:~ . ::: ·. ::~ .:{~t·:~:.: ... ·:~.~=~;i;~t~~ Gi!do Mirate, Bill Brockwehl, and Leahmon Nestle, the three leading men on the Union squad, are ex- pected to set the pace for the Yel-: lowjackets, with Ed Bastedo, Gerry' Neuman, Russ Knox, and Sam.·· GERRY NEUM.A.N\ '86 An unusual feature of Williams' football record last year was the fact that there were seven shutouts in a seven game schedule.

Present Strong Squad The Rochester squad is also made ,,./.,,: Williams lost to Middlebury, 3 to o·; to Princeton, 45 to 0; to Bow- doin, 14 to 0, and to Wesleyan, 7 to o. The Purple beat Tufts, 6 to 0; Union, 14 to 0, and Amherst, U to 0. u.p of some formidable runners. __________ ...;.. __ _.. Johnny Field, Jim Benford, Con Thayer, Warren Phillips, Dan An- drews, \Red\ Fogarty, and Jack Harley comprise the team. Neil Mulcock, the only other sophomore runner besides Harley, has also joined the squad. ·In the first meet, Field, Benford, Phillips and Fogarty tied for first with Andrews scoring fifth. Last week Phillips jumped two places and scored first ahead of his team- mates. Their time was cut down considerably in the second race of the season_ Improve in Trials The trials held during the week on the Garnet course have shown the fine development that the Dutchmen have undergone since the beginning of the season. Knox and Mirate are scheduled to give some good performances in tomor- row's race, since their injuries have not hampered them this week. Mi- rate nearly failed to stay on the Union squad because of ill health, but his running yesterday unearth- ed no new troubles, and he will cer- tainly run tomorrow. ED BASTEDO, '36 SPORT SLIDES By MILTON A. BERGER I learned from Philosophy the value of the deductive method. You have self-evident facts -or premises from which you deduce certain con- clusions. From these cc>nclusions you deduce more conclusions, and so on. I applied this system of reasoning to Union's varsity f-ootball team and now my faith in the Garnet's gridiron ability is confirmed. Observe: Union opened the sea.son with a clean-cut victory over Wesleyan, 7-0. The Cardinals beat Haverford, 21-7. Since we were seven points better than Wesleyan, and they were l!i points better than Haverford, then we are 21 points better than BaverforiL Get the idea'? Now Haverford dropped a close one to Johns Hopkins; 6-0, and through the same analysis as before we find that Union is 15 points better than Johns Hopkins. Then Lehigh squeezed out a victo~·y over Johns Hopkins, 7-6. The Dutchmen are 14 points better than Lehigh. But, Lehigh downed Haverford, 52-7.. So now we have gained 45 points on -Haverford. Since we are 14 points better than Lehigh, and Lehigh 45 points better than Haverford, we are now 59 points better than Haverford. A little while ago we were a mere 21 points better. Thus far the Dutchmen have lost only three contests out of the 18 that have been held during the past three years. N. Y. U. and Manhat- tan were the victors in these con- tests. Since Union has run against teams of its own strength, it has come out victorious In 10 straight meets. As was said before, Johns Hopkins beat Haverford, 6-0. So Union is 53 points superior to the team fr-om Baltim-ore, N.Y. U. triumphed over Johns Hopkins to the tune of 32 to 0. Our lead is cut down, but we are still 21 points to the good over the New Yorkers. N_ Y. U. ·dxew with Georgetown, shifth11g the advantage. Manhattan College fell before the : GeorgetoWti onslaught, 9 to 0. Manhattan may have tbeaten us in cross- ~=============~ country, but we'd have to spot them 30 points in football. MUSINGS OF THE OLD SPORT Ey WILLIAM E. FERGUSON Now we follow Horace Greeley's advice. We migrate westward. Manhattan tied Kansas State, 13-all, leaving the Dutchmen with a 30-point advailtage over Kansas State. The latter beat Kansas Uni- versity, 13-0. This leaves us with a 43-point superiority over the Jayllawks. Since, the latter fought a 7-7 deadlock with Oklahoma. we hold the upper hand over Oklahoma to the same extent.

They have nine veterans re- porting on the squad and anyone that saw last year's eleven in ac- tion will know that these boys are all that is s-aid of them. Last year they were the underdogs 'because they had a poor schedule. This year they are, by most of the local sports predictors, given the edge over the Dutchmen. Last year they won. This year we should turn the tables on them as they did on us last year. It can be dQne. .. . . The Williams luminary is Nick Holmes whose position is halilbaclt HE> is the sparkplug of the whole team and his fa,me has spread abroad on more than one occasion. Union fans will rememober him from last year when he grabbed a Garnet aerial in the first five min- utes of play and dashed more than half the length of the field to score. Again he accepted one of Semerad's punts andi ran ·again for a score. He wears a big number 4 on his jersey and he will have to be. have any hopes of keeping the Purple a way from their scoring there tomorrow and get !behind that team as no other Union student body has a Union team •before.

S. C. Smith, professor of Geology in his speech \Vednesday before the student body. Prof, Smith explained that the planet would naturally ht> a ~maH one, hut it would be as truly a planet a~ is the one on which we live. '!'his miniature world is but one of the many bits of matter re- \'olving about ti1P \'un that are con- lluuully iuter::;~ctmg the orbit of the earth and which are attracted earthward. These fragments of matter vary from the size of du;;t to bodies weighing many tons. Their rapid motion through our atmosphere produces enough friction to raise the temperature of their outer por- tions to incandescence. Although thousands of these meteorites enter the atmosphere daily it is- probably l'qunlly truE' that only a few sur- vive the high temperature produced by their rup1d passage through it. Although mnny of thP!'P Rurvivors fall in inaccessible place~, \the wonder I~ not thnt Wf' tint! so ff'w but that we> find so many\.

One of the rarest types of me- teors are the stoney meteorites of which only seven have been found in New York state. Prof. Smith concluded his talk with the sug- gestion that the Outing Club ex- amine some rocks on its next trip to discover some of these rare meteorites. \You can put Union College on the map as having found the eighth meteorite in New York.\ Cites Need of Cooperation In Daily Chapel Address Dr'. Benjamin Boss of the Dud- ley Observatory spoke bc>forc the student body yesterday morning in assembly on the need for cooper- ation in thE' continuance of human activities. He chose as an example of his topic the organization of Neighborhood Astronomers who in- formally meet and help each other. Scientists must co-operate, said Dr. Boss, in explaining the fact that each scientist cannot specialize in all branches of his work. \In the future,\ predicted Dr. Boss,\ some of the most remarkable develop- ments are going to be made by scientists in different fields.\ \The ideal group of scientists are the astronomers,\ he said. The in- formal club of neighborhood as- tronomers furthers ea-ch man's thought, for f'ach person brings his own problems and in a select group discusses it. rn this way he is benefitf'd by rcct>iving criticbms, while his listeners get the benefits of his original thought. As for one man stealing another's ideas, Dr. Boss said: \It is Impos- sible to talk with a man one night and to knife him the next day.\ Dr. Boss suggested that some kind of national otganization founded on the same thcOiies as the informed a;:,tronot.ners club would be of great benefit to everyone. \Life would be a great deal happier if we all came to mutual understanding.\ ---0---- Fox to Address Phi Betes On Outlining the Future The first me~ting of the yea!:\ of the Upper Hudson Association of Phi Beta Kappa, will be held to- morrow night at 8:00 o'clock at the Troy Club, corner of First and Third Streets, Troy.

When the concert begins at 8:30 o'clock the larg-e auditorium of the school will be filled to capacity, for the association has this year not only u full mcm·ber::;hip but a lat ge walling li~t.. Members of the Union College Glee Club will usher.

On that occasion the piano had to be car- ried 4[) miles by dozens of men, he relates. Beyond the flat rocks rising in semi-circle, each towering above the others as nature had placed. it, Heifetz gazed upon the moonlit peak of the Mount of Tiberias. Even more stimulating, he believes, was his audience. \It listened to the music with a reverence border- ing on religious piety.\ (Continued on Page 6) scraps which have fallen to a state of practical decay in recent years.

Coaeh<\!i Favor Gamt>s A:, a method of further determin- ing how the students in football feel about subject at hand, the Concordiensis prepared a questionnaire and has consulted many sophomore members of the varsity squad, as well as the' coaches. Head Coach G. Hatfield was among the first to be consulted and it was found that he was very much in favor of such a plan. \I feel\ he said, \that a · greater spirit among the members of the two classes could be gained by a contest of this manner. As for having it before the Hamilton game, however, it is out of the question, for I couldn't permit my players to risk their condition in such a game.\ Coach Nels Nitchman of the freshman team is also an advocate of a football game between the two classes. \I would be willing to lend my services to coaching teams for the game if it wouldn't inter- fere too much with coaching bas- ketball,\ he said. \I would not allow any members of the basketball squad to participate in this game because of the pos10ibility of injury.\ As for the members of the two classes playing football at present, the sophomores seem to be strongly in favor of such a game. When the questions were asked, the members of the squad were told that the rdea of a scrap, or of scraps, was out of the question and that this game was to create an all-Union affair which would be attractive to the entire student body. The fol- lowing questions were asked: l. Would you be willing to play in such a game, in spite of the action td.ken by the student ·body at its meeting yesterday morning, pro- vrded that the college would take care of you if injured, just as it does during the regular football tieason? Z. If such a game were played, do Y9l1 think it would help toward the creation of greater class ::~pirit? Varsity Men Give Opinions Jim Doyle, a sophomore playing end on the varsity squad, says, \I am wiiling to play in the encounter if it is before the Hamilton game. It would probably create a st:~irit if it would be regularly instituted in the college activities.\ Don Liffiton, another sophomore on the varsity and last year's presi- dent of the freshman class, states, \I am very much against such a <Continued on Page 4) ·----0----- Victolious Team Opposes Economic Self Sufficiency Arguing the negative of the sub- ject \ResQlved that the United States should adopt a policy of self- sufficiency\ Robert Everest and Guy Graves, both sophomores, won a 2-1 decision of the judges over an affirmative team consisting of Carl Olson '36, and Paul Goldberg '38, in the practice debate .held last night at the meeting of the Philomathean Society. At the conclusion of the debate Messrs. Robert H. Smith, coach, and Fred Wyatt, director of debating, criticized the individual speakers and the debate as a whole. Because the opening intercollegi- ate debate of the season will take place Monday, it was decided not to hold the regular meeting at that time. No definite action was taken on the suggestion that the weekly meeting be held Tuesday instead, and the members were told that unless advised to the contrary ln. the meantime, there will be no meeting of the society next week. • , .

Moseley, faculty adviser of the delegations. These members, Cal'l Olson, '36, Richard Snyder·, '37, Ja:mes Q. Doyle, '37, and John D. Hall, '36, are the first to be chosen under the new regulations which, by eliminating course and class prerequisites, have greatly widened the eligibility, a step taken last spring when an appropriation from the student tax was made to the delegations. Carl Olson, a member of Delta Upsilon, is one of the group of stu- dents which recently organized the Social Studies Club. He has been on the Dean's List with a first grade average, and ha·s participated in varsity debating. He was a dele- gate last spring to the New Yorlr .Sto.te Debaters' Conference at Col- gate. Ilichurd Snyder Is a member of Alpha Delt3 Phi and lives in Sche- nect8uy. He has been on the Dean's List, a member of the Concordien· sis beard and entered Union with the February-September· class. He is a member of the Philomathean Society and is one of the two men c:m the first varsity debating tearr of this season, which will meet a Syrac :e girls' team later this month. J 0hn D. Hall was on the Dean's List throughout his Sophomore year. He is a member of Theta Nu Epsilon, and comes frc>m Troy. James Q. Doyle, of the Alpha Delta Phi fraternity, was a member of the Student Councii in his Fresh- man year. was re-elected for this year, and was on the ft eshman football and lacrosse teams. He is now on the varsity football squad. Doyle's home is in Springfield, Mass.

By MILTON D. BEDELL Trailing a heavily favored Will- iams eleven by at least one point for three-quarters, Union's white- shirted gridmen staged one of the greatest rallies ever seen on Alex- ander Field to upset the Purple team Saturday, 30 to 21. The lethargy which settled over the crowded stands early in the second pel'iod, after the powerful Williams team had taken advantage of a blocked lcick and an inter{)epted pass to score two touchdowns, soon disappeared before the heroic on- slaught of the Union team. Li~t­ lessness vanished and frenzy kept the spectators on their feet for practically the remainder of the contest. Passes Passes! Passes! Passes!

Here great difficulty was encountered with the adminis- tration which was directly opposed to any but literary societies. For some time meetil1gs were held ln a log-cabill, built in the forest a half-mile from the campus but a vigilant fa-culty member made it his business to report the names of the men attending these secret con- claves.

Nitchman Reviews Year's Work President Nitchman reviewed the work done by the Alumni associa,- tion during the past year. He em- phasized the important work done by the scholarship committee head- ed by Douw F. Beekman which awarded two scholarships to boys in Schenectady County to study at Union; he paid tribute to the com- mittee headed by ;Reuben Bead, which arranged last year's dinner for the football team; the fine work of the committee, chairman- ed by Horace Van Voast, '24, which arranged last year's Glee Club con- cert and dance at the Mohawk Golf Club, received praise; com- mendation was also given to the Alumni-College relations committee of which J14r. Bannigan is chair- man, to the engineering committee, including William Landreth and Fred Frisch, which made valuable suggestions to the college concern- ing its civil engineering depart- ment, to the association for its at- tendance at the college pep meet- ings, and for its successful demand that the admission prices to foot- ball games be lowered. Favo1·able Balance Mr. Oppenheim in his financial report declared that the association had a favorable balance although it used all its funds for scholar- ships. The surplus is from public affails held by the association. A committee consisting of Mt. Wyatt, Professor Frederick L. Bronner, '23, and D. Richard Weeks, '28, was appointed to han- dle the contributions of Alumni to the college library. The committee will carry out the suggestion made by Pre::~ident Fox at the October meeting at which he said that alumni may set up memorials for themselves at little expense yet of great value to the college if they would donate sums to the library which would purchase books for the amount and then insert a spe- cial bookplate indica;ting that the volume is a memorial for the donor.

A fumble by Gordon, which Doug Lambeth .recovered for Union, gave the Hatfleldmen the ball on the 48-yard line, Semerad immediately caHed for a pass, 'Dain to Semerad, nine yards! This ini- tial play was a warning and an, omen of what was to follow during the rest of the game. For the re-. mainder .of the first period the two teams battled back and forth, with the fates favoring the Purple team. Frank X. Connelly, starting for the first time this year, did splendid work in the backfield. Doug Lam- beth and Ernie Brown worked to- gether on a couple of plays and piled up the opposing plays at the line. Salsich Scores Shortly after the second period had started, Salsich, after two at- tempts, plunged over the last mark- er for the first score of the .game. Captain Noehren had intercepted a Garnet pass as the first period end- ed and ran it 43 yards to the 6-yard stripe, from where the touchdown was scored. A few minutes later Lewis, sub center, blocked one of Semerad's punts, scooped up the ball and dashed six yards for an- other six points. Lamberton con- verted both attempt for the point after touchdown. At this point of contest, a battling Union team be- came a deadly machine with but one idea-to get those points back!

Neither i.s nearer to the pot of gold. Several upsets marked the week-end's grid encountez·s, and the Sages went into a three-way tie with an average of .417, with five correct selections out of 12, which is all right for baseball, but not so good for prophets. The Chicago-Purdue, North- western-Wisconsin, Texas-Southern Methodist, and Fordham-Tennes- see games foiled all three. Hathaway stole a march on the boys in the Yale-Dartmouth tilt, Berger in the Temple-Holy Cross encounter, and Fox in the Illinois-Army game. The results: Yale 7, Da1·tmouth 2.

They call attention to the scores of the Purdue-Chicago, Northwes- tern-Wisconsin, Texas-Southern Methodist and Fordham-Tennessee games. Dain ran the kickoff back to the 27-yard stripe. Passes by Dain to Burton and Semerad and line bucks by Ernie Brown and Dain resulted in two first downs. The last was the result of much careful measure- ment and meditation by the referee. On the next play Semerad faded back and heaved a thirty-yard pass to Van Waldron on the 20-yard line, who evaded one man and dashed into the end zone for the score. Semerad made his kick- off, and feeling rather tired, sat on ~t for a f~w ~econds before bring- mg the prgskm up to the 30-yard line.

A line play and a pass failed to gain, and Semerad ldclted to the Williams 23-yard marker. Salsich made it first down on a 24- yard run around end. Holmes then called for a short pass and a lat- eral which was incomplete. The ball was given to Union on the 45- yard line, Salsich took Ralph's kick back to midfield. On two re- vei·ses the ball was advanced to the Union 30-yard stripe where a pass from Salsich to Moseley in the end zone gave the visitors their third touchdown. Lamberton's kick was good . ran oughCut Williams was kept in her own territory after the kick-off. .Toe Milano, who had been breaking up many of the Purple plays, gathered a Williams fumble in and gave Union the ball on the 23-yard line. After advancing the ball to the five- yard line, a fumble placed the ball back on the 11-yard marker. Sem- erad demonstrated his keen percep- tions as quarterback by calling for a pass. \Chip\ Dain faded back. and shot the ball straight over the line to Semerad in the end zone. Ralph ldcked the point af·ter touch- down and Union Trailed Williams by one point, 21 to 20. Semerad's Field Goal In the final period the Garnet- covered shoulders of the Union team appeared in the open numer- ous times. From the 30-yard mark- er the ball was advanced to the Williams 12 on a pass from Sem- erad to Sloatman and. end runs by Brown. Two passes failing, Sem- erad took the ball on a wide end run but was unable to gain. With the ball on the 15-yard line close to the sidelines Semerad stepped back to the 25-yard line and kicked a field goal, putting his team ahead for the first time during the game. The stands at this point threatened to collapse with the joyful pushing and clamoring of the Union fans. With nine minutes remaining of . the game, Williams threatened to score again but Semerad clinched the game, when, with excellent in- terference, he darted through tackle for a 54-yard scoring run. He kicked the point after and Union remained in front, 30 to 21. Stanley made a beautiful return of the last kit::koff as the stunned Will- iams rooters glumly watched their team make a last desperate stand. Milano and Brown played great ball in these l•ast few minutes and Emery Burton ended all the Pur- ple hopes when he recovered a Williams fumble. The game ended shortly after with the happy Gar- netmen hugging the ball tightly and taking no chances. Jn the manufacture of Granger Rough Cut Pipe Tobacco the Wellman Process is used.

Vieuxtemps may not improperly be called the ~leyet·beer among composers for the \\iolin for he shares both the good and bad qualities or that gn·at opera writer. In his work there is frequently beauty of melody and extremely clever calculations of effect, only too frequently offset, however, by bombastic and theatri· cal pathos and occasional lapses into triviality. The \Hora Staccato\ which Hei- fetz will play is his own arrange- ment of Dinicu's composition. It retains the prevailing melancholy of Roumanian music, applied to a tune that is oddly gay and fiery. The national dance, the \Hora\, is m rondo form. Debussy's \Girl with the Flaxen Hair\ will be recognized by all stu- dents who have attended Dr. Tid- marsh's Sunday afternoon recitals.

Maybe the teams bec&me peeved whon I said the Little Three were too good, If 'they continue with the fighting, scrappy spirit that they showed against Williams Saturday and show results, I will take off my hat to Union.

In speaking of the programs of diversified athletics as sponsored by colleges in the United States, Professor Ketz said that the pro- motion of intramural activities stifled a lot ot criticism on the part of the people who were opposed to varsity athletics on the ground that it favo1 ed only a few skilled performers. \The entire object of athletics is to show a man the way to health and happiness in his life a:fter col- Jpge hy keeping alive the spirit ol plaY\. said Professor Ketz. ··rn Arne, ica during the first half of the 18th century it was believed that brains and brawn were de- veloped in the inverse ratio.

Through the med- ium of these columns we have pointed out defect8, tried to arouse interest, and sug- g-ested qllesLiuns which required legislative action of the students. Altetldc.mce at the Ineetings this year, especially the last tvvo, has prompted us to add to the discussion with which this subject has already been favored. Those who graced the rec€n t l\Ionday convocations with their presence will no doubt l'ecall the vociferous \Noes\ with which seve1·av motions were voted down, the loudness of the \Ay.es\ or \Nays\ determining- the majority. Those who were especially (}bse1·vant might have noticed that much of the intensity of the sounds was due to the efforts of a ce1'tain few ·who expressed theil· votes by shouting at the toJ> of their voices. If, as we p1·esume, the id{o!c.t uf voting- is to determine the num- ber of votes each side of the question re- ceives, might we suggest that the present means of measuring this entity is inade- quate? It seems to us that a more suitable mel:!ns ()[ accomplishing the desir·ed purpose might l.Je found in the standing vote. Those who possess delight in multiplying theil' votes would then indeed find a fe~tt worthy of their mettle. ART AT l.JNION THE CONCORDIENSlS, FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 9, 1934 to it in other courses. Art has taken a back seat along· with classics in American colleges Ill the past half century. Nevertheles;S the fact that Union has se.en fit to cling to thi.s one tie to nineteenth century college educa- tion is g-ratifying. Considering the fact that approximateb· :~0 students, all uppercln~:omL'n, ure nw:king a study of art, with perhaps another ~0 get- ling a smatte1·ing of alt in other courses., the whole college shoutd feel grateful that it is being given the opJJul·tunity to see an exh:ilJit, fl·ee of chmge, of etchings by contemporms American artists rig·ht here on the e<~lllpns. LEST WE FORGET Sixteen years <tgo Sunday the nwst des- tructive war in history was ended. The world was exhau;;ted after four ,rea.rs of international epilepsy. People believed that the world wus at last safe for democrmy, that neve1· again would the experiences of 1914-1918 l.Je repeated. But the expected convalescence has come. All the innoculatiun::; of peace treaties, all the formulas of the vl'ise men, all the incanta-: tions of the 'vitch doctors have not stop11ed the world's l'ising l.Jlood pressure. Today the nations m·e beginning to foam at the mouth. once more and a se1·iou8 relapse is imminent.' We m·e not alarmists. We merely face facts. The wol'ld today is not only afraid of war, it is prepal'ing for war. The two condi- tions aggravate e£tch other. The moi'e we fear war, the mm·e we prepare for it; and the more we prepare, the more we are afraid. The 1·esult is inevitable, and will alvvays be inevitable unless we abandon the profits-and- patriotism motives in ::;uciet.r. The gal.J-a.nd- gTab system. War is a disease, an epidem.ic disease. Our susceptibility to it is deeply rooted, but it i.s not hereditary. Its germ::; breed both in the filth of political and economic greed and in the starched colla1·s of our national p1·ide. Hope for international health lies not in anti- dotes but in prevention. Armistice Day is a fitting time to con- sider the war situation and to recognize c.md expose the intensive JHopugauda fo1· war which is now flooding· the newspapers and news reels. Too often is Armistice Day the occasion fo1· those insidious memorial serv- Ices which glol'ify tl1is national disease and idolize its unf01'tunate victims, the \he1·oic dead\. Bellum delendum est!

Rochester's Passing To date the Rochester team has sl1own unusual strengLh in ·both. phases of the game. They have an exceptionally strong and bewilder- ing passing attaclt, while Coach Davies has also drilled his charges well in the art of rushing, end runs, and reverses. Oberlin was defeated 7 to 6, Kenyon 19 to 0, and Hobart 20 to 7. Amherst took the Jacltets to camp by scoring 35 points to 7 for Rochester. Despite this differ- ence in score, the real strength of the River team is shown in the fact that they made 10 first downs, while Amherst could only heat this total by two. Although defeated, by Hamilton 13 to 0, the 16 first downs made by Rochester, com- pared to the eight for the Hamilton boys, indicates that Rochester is far from being an easy setup. An- other factor in favor of the Yellow- jackets is that Union has defeated them for the past three years straight. Not a touchdown has been scored against Union since Coach Hatfield took over the Gar- net ball carriers. No team is going t() lay down and be walked over for four years in a row and Rochester, with this idea in mind, has been pointing for the Union game all season. The 'Jackets are a good team at any time, but on their home field, With a heavier team, and a determination to pr·event Union from repeating its impres- sive victories of the past three years, they are going to be a hard team to beat. Union has an advantage by virtue of its win over Williams last week This win brought back some of th~ fight and headwork which has been CHARLES' Fu:;;r;;~~ty The Official Union College Barber for the past 24 years.

On Track Team Mirate has been on the cross- country team for three years and was elected co-captain with Bill Brockwehl last year. He has also been on the track team, running the two-mile course.

Besides his running, Nestle also did some broadjumplng. Tomorrow the race against Mid- dlehury will start at 2 o'cloclt on the Union course and the runners will wend their way over the four and a half mile Alexander Course before returning to the finish line.

The talk of Mr. Har- ris is one of the highlights of the inter-.American short wave radio program which will feature an ex- change of greetings between Rotar- ians in Buenos Aires, Argentina, South America, and in Schenectady . Much Preparation Preparations and tests have been underway many weeks for this in- ternational Rotary broadcast. Ro- tary in Schenectady was first to conceive of such a linking of clubs when, three years ago, a similar two-way exchange was carried on- by Rotarians of that city with Ro- tarians in Melbourne, Australia, When this broadcast was at- tempted, facilities were not avail- able to permit other clubs to listen as they are to be on this occasion. From This Vicinity Among the Rotary Clubs which will join the Schenectady group at the dinner at the Alumni Gymnas- ium will be those from Albany, Troy, Glens Falls, and Amsterdam. Referring to his experiences in the Bolivia War zones he told of being aboard a modern troop train proceeding to the Chaco front.

There are many reasons why the whole student body should be in attendance at that function. Several reasons are pointed out above. Im addition, it is the last game of the season. Saturday's encounter will provide the last opportunity to see eight members of the team in action. This is to be the forty-second meeting on the gridiron between the two colleges. When two schools can manage to keep up a friendly rivalry for so long it is to be expected that the respective student bodies will show an intense interest in the encounters.

Is it necessm·y to stamp feet man's constitution then the rut just outside to the tune of one of the hymns which is The Class of 1924 Gate opposite Gillespie being su11g by the choir? Men averaging from 18 to 22 years of age, possessing intelligence quotients of more than one hundred, and studying in college can righ. tfully be expected to act oth.erwise than some of the students of this colleg-e do in daily assembly. Perhaps it is not realized by these students that there is a great deal of effort extended by many people in ar- ranging these programs. Furthermore, daily assembly is truly a 'snap' compm·ed to what it was in the days when chapel was when it was held at six o'clock in the morning. The programs are announced sufficiently in ad- vance so that if any pmiicular pmgram does not appeal to a student, he can 'bolt' that exercise without much fear of flunking- the course. street will do the job. A professor in Bailey Hall spends 40 min- utes drilling his subject into the mind of the undergraduate. When class is dismissed the student rushes out of the building, hops into his automobile, and begins his treacher- ous journey along the rut infested Gym road. Each jolt is enough to dislodge the precious knowledge gained in the class room. The administration may hope that winter snow and spring rain will level the campus roads, but climatic conditions are not apt to alter favorably the contours of ground.

It was the first inter-American short-wave. Rotary broadcast, with rotarians of Argentina, providing the other half of the meeting. Rotarians of New York State spent more than one half hour of the night exchanging greetings, club songs and native music with their brothers of the Ar- gentine who were conducting their festivities -in the balmy weather of early summer.

To try to guess a winner would be out of the question, for the two teams are evenly matched, both in games won and lost, weight, height, and abili- ty. SPmerad and Dain Play Finale The Dutchmen are going to have with them for the last time eight seniors who are making their cur- t<tin call in Union College football. Perhaps the most prominent publi- cally is Ralph Semerad, Union's candidate for All-American honors qnd popular student leader. He has played in every varsity football !l\ame since his sophomore year, •fter having served a year's appren- ticeship on the freshman eleven. He Is going to be heavily counted ~n to bring- home the baron today. He is a brilliant broken field run- 'ler, an excellent passer, an efficient line-plunger, and his punts have 'veraged over 40 yards so far this >eAson. The second to bid farewell to col- 1ege football is Captain Chip Dain, 1ne of the most accurate passers, 'n small college football. He has 'PHd his team throughout the year vith wisdom and the respect of his 'eammates, and is expected to be !l\reatly missed by the Dutchmen next year, for he has been in one end of many of Union's scoring plays.

BUILDING UP THE LIBRARY H.ecently Dr. Dixon Ryan Fox sent out a number of letters to the mm·e prominent publishing companies requtsti ng them t<:, send copies of their newest novels to the Idol Boa.rd and promi::;ing that each book received \·ould bL· reviewed in that publication. Otw compan~· has responded by shipping four books to the Idol Board and other companies hm l' promised to send new books a~ tht•y ht·· come a\·ailaule. This idea, brilliantly con· ceived, will be very beneficial to the Idol and also to the college library and we wish to commend Dr. Fox upon it. Through this plan the Idol will be able to print reviews of books at the time when they are released to the public rather than several weeks or even months after they have been introduced. The very latest books will be :hi:; goal: let war be t.!eclal ed only Jfter the people have voted on the matter in a national plebiscite.

Last Saturday Union's cross- country team completed its sched- ule for this year, winning four out of their five meets. A summary of scores of the meets held during the season follows: Union defeated Vermont on October 13 at home by a perfect score, lli to 40; Union defeated Wesleyan University on the Cardinal's course, 19 to 36, on October 20; the following week, R. P. I. was downed 22 to 33; Rochester won the only meet against the Union team this year, breaking a streak of 12 consecu- tive wins on November 3 at Roch- ester by the score of HI to 36; Union's last meet against the Mid- dlebury runn~rs ended in a victory last Saturday on the Garnet course where Nestle smashed the course recorc1 by 23 seconds to lead a 22 to 33 victory over the Middies. The freshman season was not so successful, for the yearlings won but one O!f the three meets sclled- uled. On October 20 the Nett T•r- race jayvee runners beat out the Cubs, 19 to 36; on the following weelt the freshmen travelled to R. P. I., only to lose again to the 'Tech frosh, 18 to 3i; and the last race against C. 13. A. on Novem- ber 3 on the Alexander three-mile course was won by the Frosh, 26 to 29. Hamilton, incidentally, eked out a win over R. P. I. because \Sohnie\ MacKensie made good his !tick after touchdown, giving the Conti- nentals a 7 to 6 margin over the Troy lumberjacks. ..

Broader Study of History Already such a broader study of American history Is ·being taught, he continued, and the Spanish contribution is receiving justice at last, \for after aH, Spain and Por- tugal gave America to the world. It was one of the greatest geogra- phy lessons the world ever· had and it has gratefully acknowledged it and then often forgotten that these early e:x;plox·ations were -but a small part of the total contribu- tions of these nations to the 'v'Vestern Hemisphere.\ \This is especially true ot earlier Anglo-American writers who only saw the Spanish borderlands ex- tending- from Florida to Califor- nia, the Spanish outposts then, and concluded that the Spanish did not colonize after all. They forgot that the real Spanish America lies be- tween the Rio Grande and Buenos Aires . . . They failed to see that the Spanish and Portuguese settle- ment was so rapid and so effec- tive that two thirds of America today are still Latin . . . Some fifty million people in America to- day, have Spanish ,blood in their veins, speake Spanish, follow the Catholic religion, and have a cul- ture largely inherited from Spain . . . Spain did not fail. True both Spain and Portugal lost her col- onies but England, it wm be re- called, lost the best of hers.\ Assimilate Natives In Race games. Ernie Brown, sophomore ace, will take the place of Don Lif- fiton who is going to be held in re- serve. Hamllton Has Vete-ran Team Hamilton also presents a veteran and well-oiled eleven. At the flank positions will be Grier Hand and Gilbert Palen. The tackles will be Tom Smith and Harry Goss, while Bob Jagger and Jack Carmer will perform at the guard posts. The Buff and Blue will have a vet- eran pivot man in Jack Byrnes who is playing his final year on the squad as are six other members of the Continental aggregation. This line is a tough one to get past and will be a cause for more Union headaches than Gartnet fans have had in a year since Union last played Hamilton. , Hatha.\l'a~· Brown vs. Holy Cross ...

He placed the blame squarely upon historians because they \felt themselves quite isolated from oth- er Ameri·can colonies, and their approach being especially from an English point of view, was quite parochial. Professor Bronner urged at this point the study of American history as a part of the larger story of the expansion of Europe, a course which would embrace the entire western hemisphere and be analog-ous to those given in gen- eral European history. In defense of this wider study of American history, Professor Bron- ner declared that the older type of American history has obscured many of the larger factors in the development of the United States. Further, \that culture and com- merce often ignore .political boun- dary lines, which after all are of zecent origin.\ The recent increase in the commercial relationship be- Professor Bronner· pointed to the Spanish custom, unlike that of the English, of trying to complete- ly assimilate the natives in race, religion and culture.

He declared, further, that Spanish explorers taught murope another geographical lesson in running the strange legends about America to the ground-except one: the \foun- tain of youth\ which is still being advertised by enterprising realtors.

If Germany should suc- ceed in establishing a new type of social order and economic order which might help overcome the present state of poverty, the end might justify itself. \It should be kept in mind that the changes in Germany are in line with a long tradition of Ger- man history, that the best minds in Germany are already working for unity, anc;i that there is a continu- ous chain of events marking the gradual progress toward that goal for more than a century.\ --0--- Research Engineer Will Speak to the Radio Club The first of a series of special monthly m<>etin~C:~ of th<> Radin Club will be held neKt Tu\~dny eve- ning. :\1r.

By A. E. BAXTER At Wesleyan University in Mid- dletown, Connecticut, on December 5, 1870, a congenial group of sopho- mores organized a society whirh became known as Theta Nu Ep- silon fraternity. For many years Theta Nu Epsilon continued as an honorary sophomore society. At the present time the, eleven active cha'Pters of Theta Nu Epsilon lo- cated from coast to coast at various colleges in the United States accept members from all classes. Phi Nu Theta was formed as a local fvaternity at Union College in 1919. Unti!1922 the fraternity us~d the dormitories in North College for thelr' .meeting place. During that, year Phi Nu Theta purchased a house on Gillespie Street which is the building now occupied by Gamma chapter of Theta, ;N.u Ep- silon. The members of Phi Nu: Theta petitioned Theta NU. Epsilon: to join its sool~ty ae a national fraternity. On Saturday. April 24. 1925, Gamma chapter of Theta Nu Epsilon at Union CollegE' was ac- cepted into the national Theta Nu Epsilon f!ocidy. Many prominent members of Theta Nu Epsilon in- cluding two of the national officers, one of its founders, and represen- tatives of two other chapters of Theta Nu Epsilon attended the ceremonies besides President Rich- mond and' Acting Dean Waldron of Union College. Over 45 active and alumni members of Phi Nu Theta were initiated lnto Theta Nu Ep- silon as chnrter mc>mb('r.'! of Gam- ma chapter. Many men who w!'re outstanding in college activitlefl a11d who have now attained prominence in public life are loy:;tl alumni of ·Gamma chapter of Theta Nu Epsilon. At the present time there are eighteen active members of Gamma chapter beside«! several pled&es. Authorities Make Statements In Behalf of Football Coach During Recent Interview Hatfield Questioned Head Coach Declares That No Qfficial Aetion Is Decided There is at p~:esent a rumor float- ing around the campus that either Clifford Montgomery, last year's star of the Rose Bowl game, or Nelson Nitchman will succeed Head Coach G. Elliott Hatfield as the head mentor at Union next fall. To determine proof for such a bold statement, those who should know the state of affairs have been questioned and It :has .been discov- ered that no one of them has been able to shed any light on the sub ject. Wittner's Denlal Professor J. Harold Wittner, di- rector of athletics, absolutely denies that any such plan is on foot. \It is all ,beyond me,\ he said. \I have heard nothing to that effect from the administration and have had no such idea myself. As far as I'm concerned, my money is still in Hatfield's corner.'' President Dixon Ryan Fox was unable to make any kind of a con- crete statement about it. \I know that the faculty has said nothing about it and there is no :basis for such a story.\ Coach Nitchman, of the f~:eshman eleven, one of the two mentioned to succeed Hatfield, also denies any such possibility. \I think that it is false from start to finish and know absolutely nothing a;bout it.\ Hatfield's Statement Head Coach Hatfield himself says, \Although I feel that if my work were unsatisfactory to the ad- minist~:ation, I would' have been told of it no one has approached me about the subject of my being or not being here next year. I have thoroughly enjoyed being here and my associations with the assistant coaches as well as the boys them- selves have been of the best. I think that the team gave every- thing it had to give this year but in t~e Hobart and Rochester g~mes, a slight dose of over confidence contributed to defeal We had a pretty good season taking into con- sideration the fact that with the exception of Amherst, every mt.jor small college team :m the schedule was beaten. Wesleyan, Williams R. P. I. and Hamilton were beaten:: To further strengthen the oppo- sition to the rumor, college officials have also pointed out that C'lach Hatfield is not a se<:~.sonal coach but a mezn.l;ler of the facu1tv. Be~ sides coaching varsitY football, Fiat- field is an instructor in physical education, and coaches tl1e varsity baseball and freshman basketball teams. Coach Hatfield: came to Union College four years ago from the University of Rochester Since that time be bas enjoyed a good small college record of 16 wins, 12 defeats and four ties. His teams hav~ beaten every member of the Little Three and has won hard-fought games from other elevens in many of which Union took the field as the underdog. SCHOLARSHIP REPORT Scholarship reports for the first report are ready for distri- bution. Reports for the members of each fraternity chapter will be mailed to the head of the chap- te~:. Students who are not members of a fraternity will obtain their reports from their advisers. No reports will be given out at the Dean's Office. After each date set for the faculty to report grades to the Dean's Office some time will be needed for the compilation of re- pm·ts. The time at which reports will be ready for distribution will be announcecL. (Signed) C. F. GARIS, Dean.

Snyder Tuesday, November 20, 1934 IT'S OPEN SEASON ON COACHES The campus has been a hotbed of discus- sion for the past four days since the start- ling- announcement m the Union-Star that there was a rumor floating about that Cliff ;.\lontgomery, star of last year's Rose Bowl contests was being contacted as a possible gridiron mentor for Union in 1935. There is absolutely no basis for such a statement in that it has been definitely denied by all con- cerned that any change in the coaching staff is being contemplated. Union stands uniquely among colleges in the east through its policy of faculty coaches. Such a policy certainly stands out as an at- tempt to protect the institution from the category of colleges who earn undesirable publicity at the conclusion of unsuccessful football seasons. It is an old trick of sports editors to hire and fire football coaches. One of the cardinal virtues of the Hatfield reg-ime has been the cleanliness <Jf the bmnd of football played by the Garnet. If the col- lege wants to sacrifice clean sport, it will hire another coach. If the colleg.e wants wide1· publicity from football it will engage some nationally known figure in the realm of the sport at a much greater expense. Nevertheless, the fact remains that lVIr. Hat- field is still a member of the faculty as much as the most distinguished instructor of any of the textbook courses. Unfortunately he is subject to more outside criticism than an in- structor of philosophy, economics or physics. Evidently the announcement of the rumor did not shake the morale of the team to such an extent that they could not play well against Hamilton on Saturday. If that indi- cates satisfaction by the closest men to the football coach, it is worth considering by those who hire and fire members of the faculty. CRIMINAL LAZINESS One of the first lessons taught in the comparative government course here is that a native of the United States is a citizen from the time of his birth. We at Union never learned this, or if we have, it has been forgotten. All around us the history of the world is True, we have had our pacifists and ·pad<Jr They were noisy.

After :McKenzie had punted out at midfield, Union drove t() the Hamilton 20-yard line where \Jiggs\ pulled a \fast one.\ Talting the ball behind the line of scrim- mage, \Jiggs\ came up to the for- ward wall and stopped dead. Every- body else stopped with him, but \Jiggs\ had started again before the referee had blown his whistle and nearly had a touchdown. Ee was stopped on the one inch line.

Director of Russian Dancers Sees· DevelopmentofNewAmericanBallet 1 By RALPH COHEN \The ballet is propaganda for. beauty,\ declared Col. Wassily de- Basil, founder and general director of the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo which appeared in Schenectady Wednesday night. A genially modest, heavily be- spectacled man, with nothing but a scarred cheek and the white cross of St. George in his lapel to attest to his war career, he sat telling of his conception of the ballet and his ambitions for it. \The ballet is the highest form of art,\ he continued, \for it is an en- semble of all the arts. Music, sculpture, painting, poetry, the drama, folklore, as well as chore- ography-all enter into it. Further- more, it is the foundation of culture as well as a manifestation of it, for in the ballet inspiration for further artistic endeavor may be found. As much education as it is recreational, this form of dance is ideal training for the perception and genius of our youth. \We have come to America to try to found a real American ballet. You yourselves have folklore, tradi- tion, composers, librettists and art- ists second to none-yet we could not find any movement toward national ballet. We are not em- barked primarily upon a commer- cial enterprise; it is our dream to educate the younger generation in the perception of beauty and of art that only the ballet can foster. This movement, we hope, will bring about a renaissance of na- tiona! American culture. for it in· eludes, and will stimulate, all the arts. Also, the youth of America, when they have seen the dance, have seen it in vaudeville shows and burlesque house,;. We want to show them that the dance can be inspiring, beautiful and amusing, without being immoral. \Here in the United State~ you have everything ready for a ballet. As I have said, you have a back- ground the equal of any country's. You have talented dancers. each an expert in one branch of the dance. But the smallest and youngest bal- lerina of our corps can do every- thing that Ted Shawn. Albertina Rasch, Mary Wigman or Ruth St. Denis can do. \What you need is a tchnical foundation, and that is the funPtion of the Ballet Russe. Like the oil on the painter's palette. it is the base for every shade of national culture. You must add your own peculiarly American pigments, we will supply the base. \We do not wish to found a school, for that would become a personal organization. We want to awaken the country to a nation wide movement. Already we have come to see that we are not living a dream, but are part of its realiza- tion. There wi!I be an American ballet, and it will be among the best. It will have as its technical foundation the heritage of the Ballet Russe-but the rest, that must and will be American.\ \Bold Strol>e for a Wife\ to Run Tonight, Tomorrow, And Monday in Hanna Hall Trying their h:mtl at co;;tume comedy, the Mountebanks will open theit twenty-third season tonight with \The Bold Stroke for a Wife,\ by Mrs. Susanna Centlivre. The play will continue tomorrow and Monday night,;, and will be pre- sented in Albany on December 7. This 1 ollickmg and satirical com- edy-drama is one of the most bril- liantly staged plays that the Mount- banlts hu.vc produced. With the gorgeou~ costumes of the cast, the w;tty lines, the ingenious situations and the clever settings, it possesses a charm that has ltept it alive for more than two hundred years cinse 1ts premiere at Drury Lane in 1717. The play is the story of a young officer on half-pay who is deter- mined to bNter his fortune by mar- riage. While at Bath, he has met a charming young lady, whom the original dramatis personae naively characterizes as \Mistress Anne Lovely, A Fortune of Thirty Thou- sand Pounds,\ and, attracted as much by her beauty as by her money, proposes to her.

Although there are many people who believe that artist:; are different than themselve::;, the creative man is different in but one characteristic: the ability to see beauty in every.thing. This insight I:> something that makes life hap- pier for the artist. \You are ju::;t as much an artist a:; I am,\ continued Mr. Arms, \each one of you ha:; the potential creative power within you. Where- ever· one may be there is always beauty, every 10imple action contair.:; beauty. But art is not the expres- sion of beauty ... any expression that is beautifully done marks an artidt. 1 ' The modern belief in America that art is a luxury was attacked by Mr. Arms who stated the French pea.::;ant had more feeling for beauty than the average cultured Amer- ican. It was not a luxury for the Greeks, the Romans, the people of the Renaissance and the middle age~ he said. \As soon as we can develop a need for art as a neces- sity not as a luxury we shall have a cultured and civilized country. Apply the saying, \lift up thine eyes,\ Mr. Arms concluded, \and you will find things that you never knew existed before.\ Mr. Arm:;' etching,;, achitectural in theme, have been shown in both Europe and America. He combines highly technical skill with a spir- itual appreciation of his particular· re~ponse to the beauty of the world of yesterday.

FINCH Betha Theta Pi was founder! at Miami University, Oxford, Ohio, in 1839. It was the first fraternity to originate west of the Alleghanies, and the seventh to be founded in an American college. Through the century of its existence Beta Theta Pi has become one of the most powerful and best !mown of fra- ternal organizations in this country. By a policy of rapid expansion, the fraternity now incorporates eighty- seven chapters, situated throughout the United States. Francis W. Shepardson, once vice president of Phi Beta Kappa and chairman of the Inter-fraternity Council, is the president of Beta Theta Pi. Under his leadership the fraternity ha~ enjoyed its greatest prosperity. In 1881 Nu Chapter of Beta Theta Pi was established at Union College. During the first years of its exist- ence here, the members lived in a house on Union Avenue, opposite the Campus. A better site was later purchased by the alumni of Nu Chapter. The new site was on the campus, and is where the present Chapter House stands. The fraternity is exceptionally sound financially, due to the fine worlt of its past treasurers. A board of Trustees, alumni of the Chapter, meet each month to aid the House in any way possible. This group acts as a bond between alumni and active members of the fraternity, as well as having a stabilizing effect on the general policy of the House. Founded by pioneers, Beta Theta Pi strives to move on to new heights of achievement, to be agressive, and always to improve. The purpose of the fraternal union is the promo- tion of the social and intellectual welfare of its individual members. The freshmen derive much benefit in their studies from a set program of study hours and from the assist- ance which upperclassmen give them.

The play will continue tomorrow and Monday nights, and will be pre- sented in Albany on December 7. This rollicking and satirical com- edy-drama is one of the most bril- liantly staged plays that the Mount- banks have produced. With the gorgeous costumes of the cast, the witty lines, the ingenious situations and the clever settings, it possesses a charm that has kept it alive for more than two hundred years cinse its premiere at Drury Lahe in 1717. The play is the story of a young offi.cer on half-pay who is deter- mined to better his fortune by mar- riage.

Bedell Friday, November 23, 1934 SOMETHING TO FIGHT FOR- Each year some member of the senior class is given an award, known as the Bailey Cup. It is presented to the member of the graduating class who has rendered the g-reat- est service to the college in any field. Such an award tends to stimulate the members of the student body to work harder at their re- spective extra-curricular activities, and the colleg-e consequently benefits by this added effo1·t. .Union has many fraternities, all of whom do render distinct services to the college. Perhaps the greatest thing that the fratern- ities do, as groups, is rushing. They bring material to the campus for the consideration of the admissions committee, and are con- stantly engaged in this campaign upon which their existence is so vitally dependent. Just as the college benefits from the efforts of individual members of the student body, so does it benefit from the rushing activities of the fraternities. Moreover, fraternities are doing- other things for the college, such as cooperation with the colleg-e in its various functions. Sometimes one fraternity outshines others in respect to what it does f01· the colleg-e. In consideration of this fact, we recommend that a cup be given each prize day to that fraternity which has done the most for the college during the course of the year. Such an award would have to be made definitely on the group activities of the fra- ternities as opposed to the individual activ- ities of its members. The benefits derived from the activities of the fraternities must be fully realized by the administration. These Greek-letter societies have a stronghold on the campus since they have been a definite part of the institution for more than a cen- tury. Surely they deserve some ~ecognition for the services they have rendered to the college. PERHAPS IT IS THE FACULTY There is no way in which to expect order for the first three or four minutes in daily assembly if students continue to straggle into the chapel long after the choir has begun to sing its processional.

BUSY WEEKEND The lethargy which usually settles down upon a college when the excitement of the football season is over has not appeared on the Union campus. The Spencer lecturer, the Mountebanks' play, and numerous p~e-holi­ day hour tests are doing- their part to keep us on our toes. Much interest has been shown in the am- bitious schedule which the Mountebanks have planned for this .season. The campus has become too small for them. They have bought a trailer for the scenery and props and are taking their plays on the road. The comedy, \A Bold Stroke for a Wife,\ which is playing- here tonight, tomorrow, and Mon- day, will be performed in Hudson Falls and at Skidmore on later dates. Prayers and con- gratulations are in order. Advice: Be sure to see the play while it's here, and save the carfare to Saratoga. • * * Culled in class: Clark Gable the sex symbol and Joan Crawford the emancipated washerwoman. • • * The etching exhibit in old gym dorm is worth the time you would spend looking it over.

B.s have ever been in the elec• trical engineering building? How many of the student body in general have ever been on the third floor of the library, in the attic of Bailey Hall, in the bell loft of the Chapel? There is one. * :) * I know a good story, but having been censored twice in the past two weeks I shall refrain from telling it. • * * I forgot to mention that you may purchase any of the etchings in the exhibit. The prices run from fifteen to a mere seventy five dollars. . . \ Also from the classroom: A man bought. a gold mine which wasn't. He sent a soil sample to the govern- ment and was told that cabbages would grow excellently in it. The cabbage plants grew but produced no cabbages. Said man indignantly wrote to the government and in a few well chosen words exhibited a very definite bias against the hire- ·lings of Uncle Sam. Return mail brought a missive from Washington saying that the man would have to get some bees in order that future cabbages might be mated by these busy workers. The man telegraphed the government, \Have done much. Refuse to play bawd to a cabbage patch,'' J. B, D. ... The corpse of Hamilton week- end has been thomughly shaken up in the last issue, and we gather that the boys are taking a more derious attitude towards life; alum- ni haven't changed a bit. And now comes the issue of moment-marks. For faculty, trustees, and the bur- sar's office this Union Plan may be a huge success. For the average student it has resulted in a muddle. The shining ones who generally get high grades are doing as usual, but those in the middle seem to have taken a licking. Is everybody sud- denly dumb? • • * . . . Then how about repeated courses? If a man is repeating a course, and it is admittedly 25% harder this year, isn't it only fair to raise the grade 25%? . \' . . . . One of the highlights of the week came during the speech given by Mr. Thompson of the Regents board this week. When he praised Dr. Fox the resulting applause was so spontaneous and thunderous as to leave little doubt as to who the most popular man on the campus is at present. • * • . . . Speaking of intensive measur- ing, Prof. Larrabee says that if two men each claim that there are more pretty girls in their respective home towns, they Will return to them to- gether and make a count.

By RIOHARD SNYDl!lR Much has been said in the news- papers concerning the th~·eat to world peace brought about by the activities of both France and Germany in the Saar Basin; how- ever, it would seem that the real danger will come after the ple- bescite and not before. According to the Versailles Treaty, Germany must pay France for the valuable mineral mines in the event that the Saar went to the rule of Germany, which is almost a certainty. Now authorities agree that that the economic condition of Hitler's regime will permit no sooh pay- ments. A crisis will arise when France demands renumeration from a government that is unable to meet the obligation. * * * The large trade that advocators of the recognition of Russia main- tained would be realized, is being delayed by the f~iltp:e o;l; tlle.

On the heels of this announcement, comes the report that Italy has adopted the same form of government.

A member of Sigma Chi fra- ternity, Bastedo has been associated with the track team and cross country team since entering Union. In his freshman year he was awarded his numera1s· in cross country and last year received the Block \U\ in the same spor.t. He also ran in the two-mile run on the track team.

Twelve freshmen received their numerals for freshman football and five for freshman cross country. Last year twenty major awards were given for varsity football, six for cross-country, and seventeen sets of numerals were given to freshman for football. No fresh- man cross-country team was main- tained in 1933. · Five Senior Gridmen Bastedo came to Union from Hastings High School where ·he was prominent in many fields. He was a member of the track and cross country teams, wrote for the school paper, and took part in the orator- ical contests. He was also con- nected with the dramatic club. As the second week of practice near:> completion, the van;ity basketball squad is beginning to function with some degree of smoothness. Coach Nels Nitchman has been concentrating drill on the· fundamentals, featuring passing, shooting, guarding, a:nd daily scrim- nlages. There a·re seven veterans from last year's squad; Captain, Ray McDowell, Joe Milano, Jack Moffett, Ralph Semerad, \Jiggs\ Rotunda, Van Waldron, and Mike Priznar. Bud Nichols, star of the class of '35 frosh team, who has M elinette, Gifford, Greeno and Boright been out of school for the past two ' years, has shown up well and is a Five seniors, five juniors and six sophomores received block \U's\ this year. They are: Captain Charles Dain, halfback; John Finch, guard; James Rotunda, fullback; Ralph Semerad, quarterback; Will- iam Waldron, tackle; Charles Krull, tackle; William Lambeth, tackle; Philip Little, guard; Joseph Milano, end; Van Antwerp Waldron, end; Robert Barton, center; Ernest Brown, fullback; Frank Gatchell, tackle; Donald Liffiton, halfback; William Potts, guard; and John Sloatman, end. Minor awards were given to Emory Burton, halfback; Richard Woodruff, halfback; Paul Campbell, center; and James Dayle, end. This year he has been most con- sistent runner under the coaching of Bill Ketz earning number three position on the team. In the open- ing meet with Vermont, Bastedo helped the Garnet team to score a perfect meet by taking third place in good time. Running at Wesleyan over one of the hardest courses in this section of the country, Ed came in with the fine time of 26:30, again taldng a third. The Tutemen from Troy were taken over by the Union harriers with Bill Brockwell, Jerry Neuman, and Ed Bastedo tying for first place. Although the cross country team ww:; de.feated by Rochester, Ed ran his usual good race and came in among the leaders of the Union pack. His time for the Rochester run was 25:54. In the last meet of the season, Bastedo continued his good work and placed third of the Union men and fourth in the race. Freshmen to Pit Strength In Tilt With Sophomm·es The annual freshman-sophomore lacrosse game is to take place to- morrow promptly at 2 p. m. on the Library Field. This week the scrim- mage sessions have been thorough. The spirit of both groups having reached a keen pitch. Present indications give the edge to the sophomores because of the fact that they have experienced players. This handicap may be overcome by the freshman, how- ever, as their reserve strength out numbers that of the opposing team. All signs point to a good, hard, fast game. This will conclude the lacrosse activity for the fall. All equipment must be handed into Fred Parks early next week.

Eigh- teenth century humor, so applause indicated, found complilte apprecia- tion in a twentieth century audi- ence. Despite the protestations of the Mountebanks, the element of burlesque was present in the com- edy, as it must almost inevitably be present in the re-enacting of any work of a period remote from the present day. The exaggerated emo- tions, the shouted 'aside', the cop- ious gesture are all foreign to the modern drama. Only in beer garden revivals do villains hiss through their drooping mustaches while flaxen-tressed heroines wring their hands and pray for their virile lovers. But there is no need for apology or explanation. This strange atmos- phere of another day was the most attractive feature of the comedy. Both the subject and the mood of A Bold Stroke for a Wife were ad- mirably suited to the players. Sel- dom has the selection of the cast been so exact as to carry the illu- sion of reality attained in this pro- duction. The first Dean's list of the yea1 for the marking period ending November 15 show;; a large drop in the number of students who at- tained Dean's List averages. For all four classes the total dropped from 274 to 195, a dec1ease of al- most 80 names. The Seniors have the best record for this period with 64 men on the list. The sopho- mores were second with 58 men listed, the freshmen had 38 men and the juniors )lad 34 men on the Jist. In compar1son with the last marking period this year's sopho- more class was the only one to head its own with the records made last year. The other three classes were between 20 and 30 men be- hind the corresponding classes of last year. In this year's Dean's List the first grade men have not been separated from the second grade men.

Ft·ed Feldman T1.1esday, November 27, 1934 GETTING ON THE MAP By creating the position of \Honorary Fellow,\ Dr_ Dixon Ryan Fox and the trus- tees have made a step forward that should be hailed by everyone connected with Union College. Cet·tainly there is no greater tie be- tween a small college and the outside wot·ld than those \\'ho are intimatrly a part of hot h factions. Dr. Fox touched the keynote it. making his announcement when he said. \the small colleg~ must watch carefully k~t it lose touch with tlw rC'a!ity of tlw prPsf'nt active world.\ There are so many colleges in this coun- try today that it is impossible for them all to be equally well known. Perhaps the great- est means of spreading the name of a college is through sports; in contracting the learned, the educational principles of the institution and the JHoducts of its faculty are of prime importance. Yet considel'ihg that the name of a college reaches the farthest corners of the nation by athletics, it is indeed a ten- strike in creating the position of Honorary Fellow in athletic sports. Every advantage is given the student th1·ough the creation of the new position. Considering that there will be twelve honor- ary Fellows in all, each of whom will spend a short period in residence on the campus twice each year, there will be one of these distinquished gentlemen on the campus al- most continually throughout the college year. Students are urged to make use of thes.e valuable contacts for they will doubtlessly benefit greatly from them. Many seniors are probably still at sea in regard to their future occupation. No greater opportunity can be offered them by the college than the one which has been created by the Board of Trustees. students who call on them at thei1· homes <ll't~ seeking to better their grade:; for making- the visit. mildly intelligent, and as bomeone for that bill.\ e_hculd have a triumphant, pUipoEe· remarked, \ltonibly respectable.\ -.A. lui nng; yet the prevailing im- ------- ----------- pression of the musi<\ is funereal.
