Y., FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 3, 1939 PRICE FIVE CENTS M:encken Arrives On Campus Tomorrow 'American Language' Author to Meet Students at Tea H. L. Mencken, veteran newspapet and magazine editor, will be the guest of the Buiges Johnson's this weekend. Mr. Mencken will hold an informal discussion on Saturday afternoon, in the student lounge of Hale House, with members of the faculty and student body. His subjects will be those of the audience, and it is Jiliely that the author of The American Language will be asked to talk mostly on s.Jang in America, newspaper edit- ing, and the New ])eal. In a recent letter, Mr. Mencken voiced a hope that \there will bE pl<'nt;· of Com- munists· .present, and that if there are any Christian Scientists or Dunkers at Union Colleg!', let them come, too.\ M1·. Mencken, along with George Jean Nathan, founded the Ameri- ca.n Mercury in Hl24 after a num- ber of years editing New York's Smart Set magazine. Mr. Nathan left the Mercury after two years, and Mencken carr-ied on until 1933, when he retired from the editor's chair to rewrite The American Lan.- gua~e. Since then, he has been liv- ing in Baltimore, covering political functions and writing editorials for the Baltimore Sun. Among Mr. Mencken's more per- manent volumes number the six series of PA\ejudices Treatise on thP Gods, The American Language, and Notes on Democracy, ----0 Tid marsh to Feature Ce>ntempora ry Works The works of several contem- pclary composers will be featured by Dr. Elmer A.

Marcel Dupre Dupre Dupre Dr. Blodgett Ta:lks At Meeting Of Sigma Xi Famed Scientist Gives Demonstratio•n Of 'Invisible Glass' Before Audience Dr. Katherine Blodgett, discov- erer and perfecter of non-reflecting glass and a member of the research staff in the General Electric Lab- oratory, spoke to the members of the Union Chapter of Sigma Xi and its guests on Wednesday night and demonstrated her new discovery. Opening her lecture, she illus- trated the technical aspects of re- fractory light with diagrams which showed the two requirements for extinction of reflective light: the 1 ays must reflect with equal ampli- tude and must reach the upper sur- face of the object at the same time. Dr. Blodgett said the films used are made by dissolving fatty acid in benzine and then dropping them in water. She demonstrated this by way of experimental procedure. The solution was dropped in a long tray on the table and the molecules co- .agulated. The inventor explained that those which attached them- selves to the hydrogen were fatty substances and those attached to the cadmium in the water were doapy in substance. Demonstrates Discovery Dr. Blodgett then dipped a metal slide in the tray and explained that each time the slide was inserted and extracted it collected a layer of film. After twelve insertions, the slide was faint yellow. The slide was then dipped in alcetone and the fat disappeaied .fiom the film. For exhibition purposes Dr. Blodgett showed some small lengths of glass with plain glass on both ends and an inch of film in the mid-· die. When Dr. Blodgett held this glass under a 10,000 lumens sodium light, the glare was so strong on both ends that nothing could be seen through them, but a newspa- per could be read through the film- covered portion of the glass. An unusual feature about the· film is that it turns the glass purple in color, but when a person concen- trates on an object he is looking at through the glass, this color is not noticeable, Dr. Blodgett concluded, \We are sorry that this film is not practical for economic use, but due to the fact that the film rubs off so easily, it would be impractical. . , . We hope, however, that it can be used in cases where there are several lenses and the film can repose on all but the outside lenses.\ A TRAINING SCHOOL FOR COACHES When we read in the Schenectady Union- Star of the appointment of Mr. Albert Ci- ampa to the Athletic Department as assist- ant coach of varsity football, we thought that a suitable replacement for Walter \Duke\ Nelson had been found. Mr. Ciampa's record as an athlete and a member of the coaching .s.taff at Columbia is highly propit- ious; and as his f<>rmer coach and present coh01·t on the gridiron, Lou Little, is l~ecog­ :nized a.s one of the nation's greatest teach .. ers of the \pigskin art,\ we sincerely fee1 that the Athletic Department has made a wise dwice and desel'Ves the congratulations of all the membe11s of Union's family. How- ever, we will watch Mr. Ciampa's career as a Gan1et coach with severe misgivings. The corpus delicti has b.een laid to rest, but in view of present con~itions, we feel that it is permissable to rattle its bones be- fore the public eye once more. When Mr. Nelson's resignation from the Union coach- ing staff was announced in December, there wet'e many who felt that one of the best coaches Union has had in many yea1·s had been needlessly sac1·ificed to our athletic rivals in Troy. \Duke\ has been one of the (Continued on Page 2) Scholarship Reports To Be Issued Saturday Scholarship reports for the second marking pel'iod will be in the ha.nds of advisers ready for distribution on Saturday morning the Dean's Office indi- cated recently. Students are reminded that, as in \the past. no grades will be issued from the Dean's Of- fice, a.nd the scholarship re- ports must be obtained from the respective advisers. Copies of tl1ese reports will be mailed to parents shortly. Idol Reviewer Is Favorable To Winter Issue Notes Improvement Over Previous Magazine This department is utterly fascin- ated by a man named Lon Barrin- ger, author of a little piece in the current issue of the Idol called \A Look at the Mohawk Drama Fes- tival\ the inspiration for which we are indebted to our *florid friend fiom New Jersey, S. Ralph Cohen '37. Dean Garis Explains Chapel Absence Rules What happens when one takes more than the fifty chapel \cuts\ .per semester allowed by the Administration? No, there is no compulsory Bible Course--· Dean Garis told us so! A ,student failing chapel is al- lowed but 25 \cuts\ for the subsequent semester. If the de- linquent scholar has more than 25 and less than 50 absences in the following semester, he is given credit for chapel for that semester, but still has his chapel deficiency to make up, and no student will be .given a diploma who has not satisfac- torily passed the chapel requil·e- ments. Dean Garis declined to tell us how many men had failed to pass chapel this semester, but said that the unfortunate ones would be informed of their shortcomings soon. Hayes Appointed Library Assistant; Succeeds Shipman North Carolina Alumnus To Assume Duties On April I Kenneth C. Hayes of Greensboro, N. C., has been engaged to become library counselor, it was announced today. Hayes has been librarian at Hi- wassee Dam, one of the T. V. A. regional libraries for two years. Be- fore that he studied at the Univer- sity of North Carolina, majoring in physics during his undergraduate years and in library science during his post graduate work. While at the University of North Carolina he won the Buchan prize for the best thesis in philosophy. Hayes will assume his duties at Union College on April 1 when he will replace Joseph Shipman who 1esigned January 1 as Library counselor to accept th<!! post of li- brarian of the technology division of the Toledo, Ohio, Public Library. Jackman Speaks On St. Andrews Traditions Exchange Student Describes Life Helmer L.

VanDyke Endorses Stude:nt Exemption From Security Tax Wnit&s to Crowther Many Colleges in Move To Prese11t Students' Case Before Congress Union entered the ranks of a large numb-er of cuJ.Ieges through- out the country engaged in a move- ment to exempl college students from the provisions of the Social Security A.ct when Frank Van Dyke, as Pr-esident of the Interfra- tern-ity Council drafted a letter to Represen. tat.ivl! Frank Crowther of the Sch~ nectady area urging that he act t() support this proposed ex- emption. The Ways and Means Committee of the H.ouse of Representatives is now con.du<Jting heal ings on pro- posed ex:.emption to the Social Se- curities Act and undergraduates from sev-e1al colleges are appearing befme that body to present their case. These proponents of exemp- tion are arguing that students who work their way through college are generally o:f meagre means and the losing of the 1 'i{ and more they must pa.y each year constitutes a definite loss to them. And often there is no clear employer-employee basis .fO>r the tax since students may receive only meals rather than financial remuneration. Unfl!l.lr to Fraternities The law also discriminates against fraternities inasmuch as college employees are exempt from the p rovisi <ms of the act. All students arc being urged to write their representatives advo- cating l his exemption through the stimulus: o:f fraternities and other campus mgani·zations. Several leg- islators have already expressed their su:pport of this proposal and since it is expected that this ses- sion of congress will give definite considerati<m to the revision of the Soci'Ll S-ecurity Law, there 1s great hope that the exemption of college students Inay be effected. tCon.tinued on Page 4) ----o---- Carroll Lists Cast For •R.osmersholm• Ma~cft 3, 4, 6 Set As Presentation Dates; To be Given in Albany At Scottish University is a little harsh with that yet youth- ---o---- ful organization but some of his The <!asting of \Rosmersholm Union's student body had its first points are well-taken.

Since the fall of 1937, we cannot recall \vhere or when the Athletic Department has made any costl;y expenditures. Breaking do\vn the aggregate SU11}lus covering- the six ~-eae pel\iod fl·om 1931 to 1937, we find that the Department averaged a surplus of over $3,UUU a yem. Fwm a theoretical point of view, it would seem that the Department should be financially sound at present. \Ve feel along with l\lr.

For as one campus sag-e so aptly put it, \Union should not be merely a training school for coaches.\ old adage \an ounce of prevention is w01th a pound of cure\ ir::. applicable in this case, but it has been found that when syphilis is treated in a pe·rson of this age group, the chance of com}llete cure is more than 80 per cent. People are beginning to realize that it is better to discass venereal diseases intelli- gently than to feign abh.o1·ence at the mer-e whispering of the word-syphilis. Because of its infectious qualities and its prevalence in many commi.I.nities, we must do something to prevent its s]n·ead. The American Soda:l Ilyg-iene Associ2tion insists that Wasserman tests can be given l>y college doctors at little expense. We fEel that if these tests were g·iven to each 1nembe1· of the freshman class when he presents himself for his regular phrsical examination, fme of charge, and to any other men who volm1teered, Union would help ilmneasurably in looking after the welfare of its stude11t body. CULLS from the PRESS Early this week the Supreme Court decided that the fourteen private companies which challenged the Government's power program had \no right to be free of c<Jm- petition\ and no \standing to main- tain the suit.\ While it was a re- buff to the utilities, it in no v;ay set a precedent which a future con vocation of the court could not see fit to set aside for the con- stitutionality of the T.V.A. has been still left in the air. However-, a hasty survey of the editorial opin- ion of the conservative New Yo:rk papers indicates that they a1·e fac- ing the worst and advocating that even if the law should be declared legal that would not be any ipso facto proof of its economic ex- pediency.

As an example Mr. McGuire pointed out that many people are apt to give as the cause of the World Wal' or the depression any one of economic, social. psychologi- cal or poltical reasons without a thol'Ough study of ,the subject. Mr. McGuire v:ent further to en- large upon the tecent split in the American Federati<m of Labor and the present day controversy be- tween the A. F. of L. and the C. I. 0.. as an eyample of the theme of his tallr. A great number of people consider as the cause of the schism in the A. F. of L. the fact that the A. F. L. will not tole- rate any industrial unions within its organization b11t wishes to re- main a strict crafts Union. On the other hand the C.

Defends Posi\Lion PROFESSOR Wl'.I:'TNER Explains Situation Hiring of Coaches Not Governecl By Athletic Department In an interview with a Con- cordiensis reporter, Professor J. Harold Wittner·, Director of Ath- letics, stated that the author of the editorial entitled, \Training School for Coaches,\ appearing in the Feb- l'uary 3 issue of T\he Concordien.sis, was hasty and unjust in his ac- cusation and when writing his arti- cle was laboring under a miscon- ception. Professor Wittner went further to explain that the athletic de- .partment has nothing to do with the paying of salaries to the vari- ous coaches with the exception of the .seasonal coaches such as the lacrosse and swimming mentors. The names of the athletic cos,ches do not appear on a separate pay ·roll, but are on file with the other members of the faculty in the comptroller's office and are paid through that office.

Since the applica.tions for stu· dent aid far e:xceed the number who can receive assistance, the average payment has .been reduced in order to assist as many stud•mt' as possible. The total .allotment of college and graduate aid for this academic year is $11,838;555. These allot- ments to the states are made oil a monthly basis, usuall':y over a nine month period.

Eastern New York section of the It's a kind of Gallup survey with pictm es. Idiot's Delight, we mean If the reaction in the United States is so overwhelmingly favorable that it can off~et cancelled O!'det s from Em opean exhibitot s, there will pmbably be a flood of films dealing with pacifism, militarism, and na- tional honor. Especially the last. All Goldwyn wants is the assurance that honor is not without profit in his own country before he lets loose with a series of dJiamatic thunder- bolts for pat! iots only. The play from which Idiot's De- light was adapted was a vety wordy affair which hammered horne the id•ea that rnunHions-makers are not nice, etc. The movie achieves the same end with fewer words and less hammering. Clark Gable is tremendous as Harry Van; he's never been quite so good before. Norma Shearer gets the most out of a very floridJ role.

American Chemical Society will be held on Tuesday, February ·7, at 8:15 p. m. in the X-Ray Amphithea- ter of the Albany Hospital. The spea.l1er will be or: Ralph W. G. Wyckoff, of the _Deder!e Labora- tories. His subject will be, \.Phys· ico-Chemical Properties of VIruses and Other Macromolecules.\ This will be essentially a sum- mary of the present knowledge of the virus proteins and other sub- stances of s.imilar molecular size. A discussion of methods of isola- tion, chemical and especially phys- ico-chemical properties of the iso- lated materials, the relation be- tween these substances and disease and the improvement in our under- standing and control of disease, will complete the talk. ,.,lJlll Slal'tlng TODAY \PE RSO·N·S IN HIDING\ \'\'lth LymLe Overman, Patri~ia ;ll<>l'ison, J.

I would butn the books of theology as well, not because I think thoo;e things are false, but for the time bemg they ;,l10uld 1;., dimir.atcu. We need a new beginning, a sim- ple foundation and that must be fellowship.\ \Forty years ago,\ explained Dean Metzger. \1 came to the Union College campus as a freshman and in each .;;ucceeding visit l have re- turned with a deep ~ense of wv- erence.\ RPflecting on the changes he noticed upon his present visit. the Dean said he found very few in the campus, the college itself, or in any material way. The change was a spiritual one, evidenced by the present day books, songs, and Pven present day politics. Today men are reflecting, and leaning on ~ociety with such terms as social ~ecurity and terms of technology in evidence. Forty years ago an in- dividual endeavor was witnessed. The change has left everyone confused and bevl'lldered. No one is on a sound spintual basis, ac- cording to Dean Metzger. The xe- ligion of fellowship is not a new one. It is found throughout t·eligion itself as the doctrine of love. If this problem is being ap- proached, it is being approached from the wrong angle, Dean Metz- ger suggested. Some think of achieving the sound basis by theology and others by social se- curit;r. \I am a rugged individualist in the mattE>r of fellowship,\ said Dean Metzger. \It is a matter of faith and of nothing else.\ Pe1·sonal relationship, ot· fellow- ship. is a matter of the heart, bound by no contract, and thus made Ktrikingly singular from business relatlonslllp, fol whtch 1t \' often confused. The religion of fellow- ship is the simple foundation to be strived for., Dean Metzger con- cluded, and fellowship with God is the most important of all. ·.;.•' .. .. ~·· ,•' OMBINATION is Chesterfield llJhen lJOlt!re bidtlinr /Or More Smokinr; P!eusta'ff By combining (blending together) the right kinds of mild, ripe American and aromatic: Turkish tobaccos, Chesterfield brings out ,::a;Jl their fine smoking qualities and gives you a.. cigarette that's outstanding for mildness .... for aroma •.. for taste.

Boyd, Jr., Union '37, a member of the pub- llcity committee of the Club. Prominent Periodicals Carry Favorable Reviews An advance release to college newspapers from Farr~r and Rine- hart, Publishers, indicates that \BEER FOR THE KITTEN\ by Hestet· Pine, which is alleged to have some reference to Union Col- lege, is being favorably reviewed. Henry Seidel Canby writes in the Book- of. the - .l\'Ionth Club News: ·'Good light novels about faculty intrigues, faculty loves, faculty horne life, and the drama of a col- lege town, are rare. Here is a read- able one. And underlying the :fiip- psncy of the book is a real serious- ness in some of the fundamental questions of American education.\ Nationwide Program The program, under the direction of Dr. Tidmarsh, will be opened with a gro.up of Szechoslovakian songs and will be followed by a lighter group including \One Two, Three, Four\ \I Got Shoes,\ \Eight Bells\ and \Aura Lee\. which will be sung by the double quartette. Next will be a number of selec- tions from the Works of 'Richard Wagner after which more songs .of the lighter type will be sung by the double quartette. A skit entitled \Up to Date Opera\ will be given following the completion of the fifth group. This ·skit, which was presented in a somewhat different form two years ago, is a farce satirizing the opera which has as its climax, hilarious escape from a burning building. .l\'Iembers Making Albany Trip The members of the Club who will make the trip to Albany to- morrow evening are as follows: I•'Irst Tenors: Leonard Bull.

Dr.FoxAnnounces Tuition Increase February 9, 1939 TO THE EDITOR OF THE CONCORDIENSIS: At a meeting of the Trustees held in New York on Janua1y 16 the question of tttition costs was left to the Finance Committee with power. At a meeting of that committee held last week it was decided that henceforward the tuition charge at Union College will be $400 for entering students. Those re-entering with the class of 1943 and all students admitted with advance standing will be con- s·idered as entering students. Cordially yours, Signed DIXON RYAN FOX. Dean Garis, reportLng' as chair- man announced that a mail box for ~se by The Con~C>rdi.ensis staff would be placed l:n Silliman Hall in the near futul'€ andl tha.t his investigation of .the Union Grid- iron, the college footi:Jall program, convinced him that lt was a non- profit making enter.p:rlse and was being handled satlsfactol:'ily by Mr. Enzer. It was ad.ded Chat Enzer would hire a student assistant next fall who would receive a slight remuneration. Editor Hequem:bourg of The Con· cordiensis brought up tbe problem of accepting adve:rtlsellJ.ents from beer manufacturel:'s for The Con- cordiensis since tile administra- tion has decided 11 ot to consider it an intoxicating beverage in en- forcing' fi,aternily r:lrlnking. No action was takel'l. on this ques- tion. Under the direction of Dr. Elmer .A. Tidmarsh, the Schubert Club will present its second concert of the season at that time. Thomas L. Thomas, well known radio bari- tone, was the featured guest at the :first concert presented last Decem- ber. The program will consist of selections of varied choral works for male voices, including Grieg's \Land-Sighting MacGimsey's \To My Mother,\ and Tchaikowsky'~ \One Who Has Yearned Alone. Mr. Musikonsky began his musi- cal cal:'eer at Carnegie Hall, in New York City, in 1932. He has been acclaimed most enthusiastically by ·leading critics· as a fine artist des- pite his youth. The , \N~w. ~ark Times\ wrote of him, ' a vJollmst of solid and. laudable. attainments.\ Mr. Musikonsky will play Handel's \Sonata in E Major,\ the Bruch \Concerto in G Minor\ for violin, and a group of incidental violin pieces. In its book section for next Sunday '.rbe New York Times will be decidedly favorable to the new novel: \BEER FOR THE KIT- TEN is a spicy, sparkling brew made up of the various ingredients of the college faculty life. It is inspiring but not intoxicating, highly enjoyable . . . Hester Pine does a good job of showing up col- lege politics on the one hand and on the other accentuating the ordi- nary human aspect of faculty men and wives, young and old.\ The New York Herald Tribune \Books\ will criticize in a similar vein: \ ... beneath the surface of satire, there is a genuine under- standing of the zeal and sincerity of the born teacher, a sympathetic appraisal of the forces that impel a man with brains to live on less money than his brains would con\\ mand elsewhere It's nice to know that they are human clay,\ The purpose of this change is to :provide as a protection against a possible decrease in the revenue fl:'om the college endowment funds. According to Comptroller Anthony Hoadley many privately endowed colleges in the United States are encountering financial difficulties and the increase is an effort to provide a form of insur- ance for Union against the possibility of such difficulties. Ansell Sweet reported that the second issue of t1H Id<II had ap- pear<'d and wn• a Hw ~ng<?H short· er than the previ0ous lss'l!e. He also (Continued QD Page 4) Lewis Gannet also gave the hew novel a generally favorable publi- •cation-uay rev i'ew in the Tribune yesterday. The increased r.evenue will not be utilized for any particular purpose or enterprise but will be retained chiefly as a \shock ab- sorber\ against the eventuality of a decrease in endowment returns. This is the first change in the college fees at Union since 1935 when the control of the finances of the athletic depattment wa.s shifted from the Student Tax Committee to the college trustees. At that time .the tuition was increased fl:'otn three hundred and fifty dullars to thr·ee llund!Cd and srventr-fivc dollat-~ with a conespond- ing decrease in the sof.udent tax. When asked for a statement as to the probable outcome of the protest Dr. Bronner .said that, although nothing bas been definitely decided as yet, an answer will be for thcom ing within a month. He intimated however, that, if a special co.urse in accounting is arranged next year only students who have taken cor poration finance this year will be allowed to register. Consider Special Course The reason ror this specification is that a new course in corporation finance will be offered next year which will include the fundamentals of accounting. This course will not be open to those who have already studied corporation finance. There fore, during the transition period of one year, a special course may be offered for those who, otherwise, would be unable to get even the fundamentals of accounting. Under this rule of eligibility, it was found that, of the 47 signers of the petition; 20 would be allowed to take the course if it were offered. A brief survey by the Concordiensis however. showed that there are at least ten other eligible men who want to take a course in accounting but who did not sign the petition <Continued on Page 4) ·---0 Workshop Pr~pares Broadcast Scripts Coast to Coast Broadcast Planned; Robert Fowler Chosen Student Announcer The Union College 'Radio Work- shop is arranging scripts for four programs, one of which is a coast to. coast broadcast, and one of which have student announcers. Robert Fowler, '39, was chosen to announce the program for the Union College Glee Club recital which will be given over Station WABY on Saturday at 6:30 to 6:45 p. m. The auditions were held yes- terday in the studios of W2XAD and W2XAF of the General Elec- tric Company. At the Workshop meeting Wed- nesday the members discussed the forthcoming half hour broadcast of February 27. The theme of the pt·ogram will concern the found- ing of Unian College in 1795. Ac- cording to Mr .. Sheehan, '25, pro- gram manager of the short wave stations and director of the Radio Workshop, the program put on by the students called \Fraternity Life at Union College\ on January 23 was a success. A committee of six has been chosen to prepare the script and production for Feb- ruary 27. The Radio Workshop is also pre- paring script and arranging to employ a student announcer fo:o the Glee Club's program over WOU on Saturday, February 18, from 12:45 to 1:00 o'clock. Another group of members are preparing a script for the special ''guest feature\ which Union Col· lege has been granted on the WOR pl:'ogram called \Collegiate Re- vue\ which is broadcast Saturdays from 11 to 11:15 a. m. on a coast to coast network. On February 18, the Union Col- lege quartet and an interview with Henry Clay, '39, will be featured on this popular program conducted by Tippie Taylor. The College News Bureau has arranged the broadcasts for the Glet• Club and the Radio Work- shop.

The petition which wRs presented to Pro- fessor Bronner this week brings again into the limelight a problem which has been troubling the college intermittently for a numl>.e1· of years. Corporation finance and accounting are two courses \Vhich intermingle and coincide to such an extent that one of them cannot be completely understood without at least a basic understanding of the other. For this reaS011, students who take one oi' these courses without the other are at a disadvanc tage. Obviously tthe ideul thing· would be to have the two courses running side by side every- y-ear. However, the college rule, limiting the numl>et· of U[}per chtss social studies courses to 15, prevents the administration from of- fel·ing this solution to the .situatiou. .From 1929 to 1936 the two courses were combined into one which was ui fered every year. Be- ginning; in 1936, however, a different plan was :put into effect. The two studic:s were given on alternating years. This plan, whilE offering a 1110l'e eXll'll:..;i\'0 ,tudy uf each, had its disadvantages. The stuc:lent was for-ced to tu.ke one course without any know iec;ge of the ut het·. A class ccmposed of .1 uniot s and seniors was at odd~ with itself, because. the seniors had already taken the course which had been given lhe yem· befm·e, and consequently were bel ter p1 epared and could advance nwre rapidly than the juniors, who. were unacquainted with the nth<>r course. Seeing these disadvantages, the college has decided to retum to the odginal plan of giviag one course, in which both suiJject,; are cumb:ned. l!uwcver, this decision leaves the juniors who are taking co-rporation fi- nance this year without an opportunity to acqtwint themselves with even the funda- mentals of ncccuntillg. Having already studied corporation fi- nance, they are ineligible to take the com- bination coul'se which will be offered next yea-~·. Certainly they should be given some sort of knowledge of the language which business talks in its record-keeping. 1Ianr students who have graduated fi'Om here in the past two years have found their account- ing comse of infinite help in getting jubs. Therefore, we m·ge that the administra- tion make some sort o.f provision fm the men who, during this tnnsitory period, are pre- vented from getting ~tny course in account- in g. midnight visitations from mernbers of the· ... Bill Hasltell, wllo gave the two fellows the ride when they were fairer sex to rnen·s rooms.

QUALITY 1 NOT QUANTITY The announcement of an increase in tui- tion from $37 5 to $400 was not entirely un- expected to those who have noticed similar notices recentlr in publications of other col- leges. Hamilton has raised its tuition, and the University of Rochester as well as R. P. I. has announced an increase. The tuition at R. P. I., fOl' example, has been increased from $400 to ~450. • * * Mm·e .Stuff ... Social note: Mrs. Fox sent the Alpha Dells a cocoa- nut from Florida . . .

The idea, as we un- derstand it, is that the students the class of 1913 will be the first to ted this sell their books ba.ck to the book- heavier impo8t. store at the end of the year. Why Not 0 ?? Even a more searching examination of the effects of this increase, however, will produ·ce a d!Vel gence of oj,)inion. Some will insist that this higher cost will p1·event many students from coming to Union, while others will maintain that the decrease oi students will be negligible and that taking a long-runge view of the matter, it will prove beneficial. \\·c are inclined to side with the latter school of opinion. A compal'!son of the tuition at Union with that of other colleges which we consider in om· class reveals that our fees are appre- ciably lower than those of our contempor- aries. Amherst, Colgate, Wjlliams, R. P. I., Trinity, Brown, and Swarthmore all hav.e a tuition of $\100 or more, with supplementary fees ranging to $50. Does Union offer less than these colleges? Certainly not I In brief, we IJelieve that whereas this tu~­ tion increase might result in a nominal de- crease in registration, we feel that this lower attendance will be more than compensated for by a ra:sing of our prestige, with the consequent result that Union will attract a higher class of student. Quality is prefer- able to qua11tity! • * • Hester Pine has written a book. That books is said to be based on Union College.

Seward '20 First to Recognize Lincoln's Abilities \'To commemorate Lincoln's :birth-· day it is only fitting to consider a tew Union ,College alumni wh<J we1 e: his famous contemporaries,\ Dr.' Waldron '09, secretary of the Col- lege, said when he spoke in chapel yesterday. Dr. vValdron gave short sketches of the lives of ten fan::wus· alumni, Breis, Patterson, .Seward, Toombs, Bigelow, Hellock, ~lair, Butterfield, Pope, and Ripley. Sidney Breis, '18, was a famous Illinois jurist under whom young Lincoln tried many of his cases. William H. Seward, '20, was one of the founders or the Republican party with Lincoln. He was a can- didate for the preside.ncy at th~ same time as Lincoln. Lincoln however, appointed him Secretary of State. Of all the men who workea with Lincoln, Seward was the fir-st to recognize the President's r·e- markable ability, Dr. Waldron said. Robert Toombs, '28, was United States senatm from Georgia and later candidate for the prestdenq of the Confederacy against Jeffer- son Davis. Although made Seer e- tary of State by Davis alter the election, he soon resigned llccau,;e of his inability to get along with Davis. John Bigelow, '35, was Counsel to Paris in 18tll and won distinction by advising Frencn financiers or the weakness of Confederate secur- ities. Daniel Butterfield, '40, Pope, '55, Ripley ,'52, and Hellock gave mate- rial aid to the Union in the Civil War by their outstanding military ability. Austin Blair is famous as Approximately 200,000 radii> listeners hear the weekly broad- casts of the \Empire State Town Meeting of the Air\ Jrom Old Chapel, according to a re- cent ~ut vey by WGY officials. This \con:oer vative\ estimate inc! udes listeners from an area extending from Permsylvania to Plattsburg and fr·om Wor- c<•sler to Syt·acuse. To determine this figure a telephone survey was made in large cities within this ana. A check-up made in Utica during the program of December ·1, re- vealed an audience of 5400. A similar check-up in Sc·henec- tady on January 15, showed t Ita t approximstely 7000 fami- lie:o •within the city limits were tuned in on the broadcast.

Erie County), agreed today that as far as the St. Lawrence Rivet• is con- cerned, the state should develop its water power resources and operate it \for the benefit of all the people.\ Spea:.t:ng before the weekly Em- pire State Town Meeting at Union College on the question of what shall be the policy of the state to- ward water power resources on the Niagara and St. Lawrence river, the two government officials ap- proached the subject from widely different points of view. y esteruay atternoon a representa- tive of tne Connecticut Mutual Life Insurance company was on the campus to interview senims. Ap- proximately ten men were sched- wed to meet the representative in Stillman Hall. This afternoon a similar opportunity is offered to students who were graduated in 1~38 or before when a representa- tive of the New York World's Fair will be on the campus. Invitations to interview this representative were sent to members of previous classes who would .find it conveni- ent to· get to Schenectady.

Mr. Wyatt also announced that the college is arranging a trip through the General Electric plant for any and all students interested. The trip, similar to one held two years ago which met with much approval, will be held on Thursday, March 2,. and wlll start at the Ad- ministration building at 1:15 o'cloclt. Busses will be provided for trans- porting those students who cannot otherwise get to the plant. The trip of two years ago was made to the turbine and generator department as well as the refrigerator depart- ment and the schedule for the planned trip will be much the same. Any students interested. are requested to report to the Admin- istration building and register on or before Tuesday,, February 28. Mr F. H.

INTERPRETING THE NEWS lf it were not a common occurrence for The Concordiensis to be I'epeatedly pl·ompt- e-d for mis-quoting som.e()ne, we would be a.roused by l\lr. Frank VanDyke's lette1· to 1.!S appearing in this issue in our \In the Mail\ column. His criticism is certainly ill- c~nsidered in its connotations and implica- tons, and for all its vet•bosity \Ve feel that he has p-resented vet'y few facts to back up his apparent objectives. We are, first of all, accused of empha- srzmg \the least imp·ortant matter dis- eussed\ at the last Interfraternity Council meeting-refusing to pass an act on limiting the number of unchaperoned women in fra- tel'llity houses. We can best set Mr. Van Dyke- right on this count by reminding him that headlines are usually written to empha- size what we feel is the most important part in the article. As we are responsible for the editing· of the paper, \\\e accepted the pre- rogative of emphasizing what we think is the most significant note in an otherwise un- important meeting. Secondly, the Interhaternity Council's President declares that we stated falsely that Dean Garis had a].)p-roached it with a Jll'Oposal to limit the presence of unchaper- oned women. Instead, aceording to l\1r. Van Dyke, the Dean suggested to him that the fraternities through their Council take some action on the presence of unchaperoned women in their chapter houses. Just where is tlte difference? In the eyes of the admin- istration, the president of the Student Coun- eil, the editor of The [d-ol, or the chairman of the Tax Committee, are those respective organizations themselves, and hold the \heads\ accountable for any action that is taken. Whether a suggestion can be prop- erly termed as a proposal is a matte1• of grammatical opinion; Webster's New Inter- national Dictionary says it can. As far as we can asce1tain, the only other respect in which our views are divergent from t)1ose held by Mr. V a.nDyke is whether the fraternities are in favor of licensed or bawdy behavior'! We inferred that the In- terfraternity Council was in our last issue through the medium of an editorial titled \Rules on Women\ beca1:1se they failed to pass some resolution to the effect that un- chaperoned women be prohibited from at- tending chapter houses after certain h~urs. practical decorate their schedule cards.

Considerable space has been ~iven in intercolleg-iate news co-lumns concerning the 1·ecent articles which have appeared in The Coneor!Uensis. Surveys wbi!Ul have been ·recently made by the Carnegie Foundation and' by Fortune magazine in- dicate that college graduates at·e receiving severe competition fro:rn high school graduates in the pro- cess of seelting permanent employment. The Car- negie Found:atl<rn', conducting its pole in Pennsyl- vania, foUDil tJ:lat ,two thirds ocf the blgh school graduates ·wbo ·d,id not go to college have made as good progress in business as those who did attend college. The Fortune pole indicated that employers preferred exper-ienced high school graduate;; rather than inexp~!\iell·Ced college graduates. College stude:nts are doing an increasing amount of thinking concerning the marital problem of life, if .the poplllarlty of marriage courses in many col- leges i.s an i\:IIdicatlon. Two hundred and fifty schools throt.Lgh-out the country now have courses on marriage ~n. <I' related subjects. T-his is a rather startling n11mber when it is contrasted with only ten such ·courses .\vhich were given only a decade agQ. · Many colleges which don.'t give such courses that. carry credit, •have lecture s-eries <Jn th-is subject.

Fresh ftom their surprising up- set over R. iP. I. last Friday, Coach Nels Nitchman's charges will be hal\d .pressed for victDl'y when they face C. C. N. Y., as the New ¥m-k five is the .strongest and most talented gt oup on the Union schedule. Coached by the renowned Nat Holman, the big city five ale ways shQWS polish and effective- ness for which Metropolitan outfits a1 c noted. C·oach H()lman has been handi- c:ap ped this season, however, by a lack of seasoned material. Six reg- ulars were lost through gradua- tion, leaving Co-captains Jarmon and Leflmwitz as nucle.j around which to build the current team. None of the sophomores has shown any of the exceptional talent which Holman has become accustomed to finding in his men. I'he Garnet troupe has been concenh ating on an efficient attack to use against the visitors. The Beavers ·use, with great success, a man- ta-man and zone sw-itch- ing defense which has proved a t.ho rn in the ~iLl~ uf many of their opponents. Union has also practiced on an all-court pressing defense for use tomorrow night. There Is a strong possibiliy, also, that the Dutchmen will unleash a deceptive passing attack, the like of which they have not displayed all sea- ·son.. T'he Union-City College series started back in 1917, although the teams have met only eight times. Union has :yet to garner Its first win from the :New Yorkers. Last year the Beavel\s won by a 37-19 count. Hocitey, Swimming Hel'e Balked three times in its at- tempt to play at home, the Gamet varsity ho<:key team will malte a final stab on Friday afternoon. The New Hampshire University sextet wm help the Dutchmen wind up their ice campaign on the local :rin.k. New Hampshire eked out a 2-1 victory over Army last week :in a hard fought match. The West Pojnt six ran rough shod over the (}arnet skaters earlier in the sea- son. What w·ith Dud Holmes again jn condition to tend the nets, how- ever, Coach Nelson feels his squad is primed for a win. Union's swimming aggregation will conclude its water season at home on Sat u r d a y afternoon against the University of Rochester natators.

The climax of the entire season wi1l arrive Saturday night when both the freshman and varsity quintets journey to Troy to engage in battle with lhe R.. :P. t. outfits.

Lefkowitz is a cool, a1ert playmaker while Adler is a steady and efficient courtman, es- pecially when under fire. Al Soupios at 6 foot, 1 inch, the tall- est man on the City squad, will be at center. Dave Siperstein and Co- captain Manny Jarmon will be the guards. Siperstein is a fast, deadly- set-shot ar.tist and Jarmon is about the smoothest all-around man on the Lavender and Black five. ·City has won seven and lost four to date, although Union, which has also played eleven games, has out- scored them 425 to 382.

Ove.r R.P.L Quintet Friday, Feb. 10 -R. P. I.'s bid for .top eastern intercollegiate basket~ ball honor8 passed into oblivion quietly tonight, when the Union ~arsity cagets administered a re- munding 53 to 25 upset before a ~apacity c1 ow d at Alumni Gymc nasium. Taki·ng to the road for the first time, after five straight victories in Troy, proved too much for the :Elngineer10. Although they opened the scoring w' th a free toss in the early minutes of play, they were ommediatelr swamped by a deluge of Garnet field goals which gave Union an 8 to 1 lead at the six- minute mark. Led by speedy George Miner and Lou Carr, the Dutchmen played inspired basket- ball throughout to take their 11th straight series victo1y from the Troy institute. It was R. P. I.'s fir$\ set back of the current campaign. Union Never Headed With the count at 25-10 in the third period, Coach Nels Nitch- man l:'emoved his regu!ar quintet and sent in the reserves. With Billy Thomas leading the way now, the Garnet continued to pHe up points for the home team. Through- out the melee, the Garnet showed an aptitude for approach and lay- up shots, the type of attacl{ with which they have not had much suc· cess >to date. Acting Captain Lou Carr copped individual honors with 11 points, closely folio\\ ed by Miller, Herb WatsDn, and Thomas with ten, eight and six, respectively. Ed Kneuble was high for the Tro- jans with ten. The Tech five, unable to check the s1vift Union offensive, was held back by the tight zone defense the Nitchman charges displayed. The strategic move was unexpected as the home team had been using a sliding man-to-man prior to this battle_ Once Union grabbed the lead, it .vas never headed. At one stage of the game, in the third quarter, the Dutchman's score was more than three times that of R. P. I.

And he certainly hit it right on the nose, didn't he? Yes, he certainly did. Tho original Din was a \regi- mental bhisti\ whose main claim to fame was that be forsook his water-carrying duties long enough to render a crude sort of first-aid to a wounded soldier, \An' a bullet come an' drilled the beggar clean\ fol' his pains. The cinematic Din is made of different stuff, though. Something has transformed him into a pathetic little man who wants with his whole heart. to be a soldier, and eventually proves himself worthy of that honor by pprform- ing an amazing 1and quite impos- sible) act of heroism. In the meantime the audience has sat through a film filled with sound and fury and Grant, Mc- Laglen and Fairbanl{.S. It·s a wild picture. But the kids enjoyed it, and so did we. The three prindpals are very good. Sam Jaffe leaves onE' with the impression that Gunga Din was a great little guy.

With this thought in mind, we approached Secretary \Charley\ Waldro.n, the Concordiensis' autho·r- ity on all things Union which date more ·than four years back. Im- agine our surprise when he told us that initiations at the turn of the century were mere ba.sket .parties compared to the modern ordeal. According to Dr. Waldron, there was little \horseplay\ attendant upon the initiations of old. The ceremony consisted in little more than the formal ritual of inducting the new members. severe as the present variety, ac- cording to Dr. Waldron. One of these societies, of which he was a member, held its initiation ·in the basement of the President's home. The candidates were lowered into tbe cellar head first-a rope around their feet-and the President's cook took great delight in wringing her hands and lamenting the fate of \those poor boys\ during the cere- mony.

The upperclassmen ~f the period satiated their sadistic tendencies by hazing any and all freshmen, rather than by venting their spleen on members of their particular fra- ternity. In this respect, Dr. Waldron told of the cane rushes. Idol scraps, and class banquets that used to ·be held. \Verdant freshmen would be asked to pay a mythl~l \salt tax\ or would he \sold\ chapel seats and hymn ·b-ooks by their campus elders. There were several so-called sophomore societies on the campus at this time. These societies em- braced little more or less than the ceremony of initiating freshmen, 'but even this initiation was not so The transition to the present style of initiation, we were told, was largely bx·ought about by the insistence of college authorities that all fraternities hold their ini- tiations in one designated week. Dr. Waldron explained that frater- nities had been in the habi.t O·f hold;.. ing ircitiations whenever they pleased during the year, but with the advent of Saturday classes and the increasing number of outside activities to claim the time of the students, it was found imperative to have all fraternities hold their initiations in the same week.

Without any additiona:l cost over the payment ef regular. dm·mitory fees, the college is offering· to in- stall a unit of individual locked mail boxes at some central station, probablv Washburn I lall, in. which all dunnitory mail will be left. Cnder the existeat systern, the postal em- ployees leave mail for dorm residents in re- cepticles placed in each section l.Jy the col- leg-e. These ct ude boxes are open to anyone who has an urge to be curious or to play ptanks on hls fellows by defacittg' or nlis- chievously m~sla;>)ng their mail. Similar o·c- currances would be t·educed to a minimum under the proposed plan.

Sibelius has contributed greatly to the development of the modern syrnphonia form. Before his time it was an almost invariable rule that the first, and often the fourth, movement, conformed to the ·strict sonata form-that is, two main themes were immediately stated in their entirety, then developed, twisted, turned, and disguised un- tn, in the last section of the move- ment, they were repeated again in their 0dglnal form. Sibelius, in his later works, reversed this process. In the Firth Symphony he intro- duces only melodic fragments, at first, and then pro cedes to integrate them into full theme. After the melody has been stated in its en- tirety 1t is broken up once more into its fragmentary parts. This technique affor·ds the comp-oser much ·more freedom from formal anchors, although it is a little con- fusing to the listener until this new liberty becomes more familiar. Sibelius' Fifth Symphony is cer- tainly far from his greatest or n.ost pleasing but it is one of those lesser works of a great master that demands regular, but not too fre- quent ,playings.

This system is so simple, and yet so beneficial to the colleg-e as a whole, that it seems strange that it has not been adopted in a modified form here before.

He gave his name as George Place and admitted that he had Jived in Schenectady all his life. Commended for his skill in beat- ing the Union battler to the punch, he politely replied, \Aw shucks, sir!\ and added that it wasn't any- thing. He posed for a portrait (Which, unfortunately, is too blurred to print) and drew himself up proudly to his full stature of four feet, eleven inches when we told him he looked mighty spruce ln uniform.

O>--- Hand-Eye Coordination Essential, Says Ketz Thursday, Feb. 16 \Whether or not a per son is a good athlete in any given sport depends on the relation of the movement of his hands to what his eyes see,\ Wil- ford H. Ketz, coach of cross-coun- try and track teams, pointed out to faculty and students in Daily Assembly this morning. \No one with two hands is 100 per cent 'handy'. Some 92 per cent of the people are right-handed, and there are over 25 theories to explain this. There are seven per cent of the people who are left- handed and only one per cent ambidextrous. \Considering the eyes, we find that one eye is always stronger than the other. The two eyes see different fields and one eye, the 'master eye', c·ontrols the action of the hands. This 'master eye' does not need to be the stronger eye. As with the hands, there are varying degrees of 'eyeness,' for one eye may be only slightly strcnger than the other. Coach Ketz mentioned four Neutrals Lead Intramural Basketball Playoffs The Neutrals took first Jilace in che intramural basketball play-offs this v;eek, defeating the KapJ>a Sigma Fraternity five on Tuesday. Kappa Sigma is in second place, having won one game from Lambda Chi Alpha, while losing one to the Neutrals. Lambda Chi Alpha brings up the rear, having lost one garne to Kappa Sigma and won none.

Sporting a fairly tight defeme, the New York City bays held the locals at bay throughout the entite evening. Union, playing witho·.tt Herb Watson, high scoring center, ehowed its hau!est brand of basl:c:ball, and remarka,ble spirit throu;;hout the encounter. From the outset it was apparent that the Dutchmen were pressing their City opponents abnormally close. The Beavers retaliated by sinking tr.e;r· set shots from the vicini.ty of the center of the .floor. Latue Buchanan opened the scor- ing when ·he :;a nk a ft ee toss with- in the J.irst minute of play. Co-. captf'in Lou Lefkowitz then tallied for New Yorlt en a long shot. The game see-sawed until the last three minute> of the initial period when C. C. N. Y. led by Dave Siperstein. applied the pte>:sure and ran the count to 17 to 6. Dt>ft>nsivP Game From that point on, the game was fought on even terms. The Beavers were bewildered by the hard pressing tactics of the home team, while Union was held down by the spectacular defense of the Holmen. Almas t all of the visitors' tal'lies were registered on their long set tosses. Union counted mostly on under-the-basket hurls. In the final period, the Garnet out- scored its opponents 12 to 7. T~e highly touted City College passmg attacl< also provided bas- ketball fans with a genuine thrill. The New Ycrk boys passed the sphere with swift, amazing ac- ~uracy. George Miller and Lou Carr topped the Union scoring with 10 points apiece. Lou Lefkowitz AI .loupios and Dave Siperstein ~ith ~3, 12 and 10, respectively, led the mvaders.

T\',:Jlllllg Tue:;day, February 21, 1939 OUR BIRTHDAY Tomonow mot'lling· when the college offi- cially celebrates its birthday at the annual Founders' Day exercises, we students of Union will have an oppol·h.mity to demon- strate out· loyalty to this institution to which we owe so much by attending the exe1·cises in large numbers. In the past, stu· dents have proven themselves reluctant to support the college in this official function; probably their failure has been due more to thoughtless negligence than to any. intention of being disloyal to the college. The lack of student attendance at past exercises has been embarrassing to the college because more outsiders hav€ attended than students. We feel that the exercises have some- thing constmctive to offer those who attend. Colorful, dramatic ceremony and an espe- cially interesting speaker in the person of Dr. l\lorison of Harvard as well as the ad- dress of our own Dl'. Kellogg; we would lil\e to see the entire student body in attendance to add to the attractiveness of the exercises. Here is yom· opportunity, students, to demonstrate your affection for Union. And may we also remind you that abs.ence from this assembly will count double? MUM'S THE WORD The background of the request of the Garnet Board for further funds is set forth in a journalistic, and we believe an impartial, manner on our first page. We cannot over- emphasize the adamant refusal of both the editor, l\lr. Allnutt, and the business man- ager, Mr. Gertz, to advance the desired in-: formation to The Concordiensis which sought the reasons for this request. remc. 1es SUlrQ'es e or u.s su. en p e ·.era ~- than 12 noon.

The two most logical :r;ea- sons for this condition are poo1:er material and the addition of stronger teams to our schedules. We have been told by erninent authol'i'ties on sports, that athletic material runs in cycles and it seems very plausible that in the past two years we have struck the ebb point of the curve. The reco~ds of the fi'eshman basketball teams during this period lend support to this theory. Since 1930, C. C. N. Y., Colgate, Columbia, and N. Y. U. have been added to our basketball schedule. During this four year span we m.et these four teams eleven times and lost that many contests. So apparently the addition of these teams to our athletic program is a St)Cond cause for our mediocre record during the past two years. A college committee composed of Dean Charles F. F. Garis, Secretary Charles N. Waldron, '06, Comptrol1er Anthony Hoadley, '23, and Student CooTdinator William W. Bennett has decreed that Union shall ••play teams of its own size and kind.\ If this statement is carried out to its logical conclu- sion, it would mean that our teams should have a 50-50 chance of winning. When we recall that our winter sports teams are vic- torious lEss than 30% of the time, it is ap- parent that the committee's wishes are not being realized. As Union has placed its athletic teams on a strictly amateur basis, we feel that the committee is wise in allowing Athletic Di- rector Wittner, '20, to schedule only teams from colleges that have formulated a sim- ilar policy toward p1·ofessionalism. Hmvever, thet·e is something to the theol'Y that th.ere is a great deal to be learned by playing· \big- time\ teams, especially in non-eontact sports as basl{etball. There is such a thing as over- ern'Phasizing the \win complex\. We feel that the committee has taken this aspect into consideration by making up two separ- ate lists of possible opponents, one of 16 for football, a contact sport, and anothe1· a))out three times as large for all other con te·sts. Last spring the committee revised both lists slightly, dropping some opponents who had grown out of our dass in either ~'size or kind\ and adding a few who were sympa- thetic to our athletic views. Undoubrtedly, this revision will help bring the percentage of victories back into a more favorable bal- cipal of Jamaica High, greeted the the musical style of Gounod, was standing l'OOm at the opera re- Ciub members and ushered them enthusiastically applauded as the served .for them for the afternoon into a private dining room, wher8 last listed number on the program. matinee performance of Tristan a well-received luncheon was The final encore was th.e popular un.d Isolde, Without such fortunate served by several select members military song, l Love a P.aroade. cooperation, !t w:ould have been im- of the student body's fairer half.

He clarified the situation by stating that there was no rule gov- erning this practice but that the Administration was strongly op- posed to initiating those on proba- tion. He cited the fact that a man deficient in scholarship would prcve to be no as~et to a fraternity, but he stated that there was no nason why !'. man who brought his marks up to his class standard could not be initiated later in the year. The Council reconsidered its mo- tion that pledging during sub-fresh- man weekend be restricted. After a heated discussion, a motion was placed on the floor that pledging be rest1 icted only to legacies dur- ing the weekend. The body con- cluded that if such a motion were passed, there would be no means of enforcing it. President Van Dyke, however, brought it to the attention of the group that the Ad- missions Office strongly favored such a move, but that it would ac- C(·pt any decision handed down by the Council. The motion was voted down by a very small plurality. CONNELLY BROTHERS of the· baH after the free the dyi·ng minutes of the yet .the Garnet attack fal- even after it i'etrieved the Srunmary R. F.

In Third Founders' Day Program Tomorrow. February 25. wjU be a Red Letter Day in .the Favors Cooperation Minister, Priest, Rabbi Speak Successively In Thursday's Chapel A Protestant ministe1·, a Catho- lic priest, and a Jewish Rabbi, yesterday made a plea in the Daily Assembly fot· all people to live up to their religious convictions, re- gardless of what those convictions might be. The first spea1rer was the Rev. Ft anlt Jennings, Executive Secre- tny of the Mas;;achusetts Council of ChUtehes, who declared that, \It is net enough for the various religions to live at peace with each othel'. We muot cooperate with each other to combat the forces of paganism, nationalism. and irreli- g:on. We have a gt'eat chance to attack the enemy which is threat- ening u,. Although we believe in the right of free speech under de- mocracies we also believe that re- ligion has a right to try and d.e- stroy the forces which are seek- ing to undermine civilization.\ Religious Uberty Human Rig·ht The Catholic 1aith was repre- sented by Father Michael O'Hearn, S.J, of Weston College, Boston, who eKpi essed the idea that religious f1 eedom is a human right and is guat an teed b; the Constitution of the Un,ted States. Although his speech was started in a decidedly humorous manner, he quickly turn- ed to a serious mood by discussing religious libet ty. \A pet son does not have to beg for it, he can de- mand it. It is not always as easy to grant one pe1·son this right as it is to another, but intolerance and bigotzy a1e not precepts of any creep. They are qualities of human beliefs. If one knows that a man has a certain belief and lives up to it, he can respect that person.\ Rabbi Levi A. Olan of the Tem- ple Emanuel of Worcester, Mass., said, \The greatest drive in history and philosophy has been for unity. In Russia, there is uniformity of class, in Germany uniformity of race and in Italy, uniformity of ,>olitical group. But uniformity does not mean unity. Unity can be achieved without uniformity. I am a Jew, and have been brought up in the Jewish tradition with the vast store of Jewish songs, ritual, and teachings. I am useful to so- ciety only as a Jew. These other men are Christians and are rich- est when they play their particular role. If I were to change, I would become twisted psychologically and my value to soci€ty would be lost.\ Pleas for Amel'ican Way \The American way is for the va- t'ious reyigions to live without hat- ing each other. Liberty is greatest when people are different and ;yet can. live in unity. We are different but struggle hand in hand for the beliefs we hold. n is like an orches- tta of many instruments. Each is playing differently, but, when we stand off to a distance, we hear harmony.\ The 1 eports goes on to say t·hat at Union College, eight of the 19 fraternity chapters were above the all-men's average i.n scholarship, and the fraternity index was sl·ighlly below the all-men's index. The study dioclosed, how- ever, that Union fraternity men dropped in scholarship .from 1936-1937. Schurz Foundation Offers Essay Prize Will Be Awarded To Most Proficient Student of German The Cal'i Schur·z Memorial Foun- dation is this year offering to the student who is most proficient in German a five volume set of the works of Rudolph G. Binding, Dr. GeJrge H. Danton, chairman of the field of modern languages, an- nounced recently. The ptize is offered annually to the student who, on the basis of a competitive essay, is the outstand- ing German student in college. The winner last year was Bernard A. Shapero, '39, who was awarded a set of the works of Adelbert Stifter. The Carl Schurz Memorial Foun- dation is an international organ- ization which annua-lly offers prizes to outstanding. German students in colleges both here and in foreign countries. The foundation itself 'was set up as a memorial to Schurz 'by a group of German people. Fox·mer Harpers Editor Though Schurz was born in Ger- many in 1829, and assumed the role of a revolutionary student there, he settled in the United States in 1856 and became one of the lead- ing citizens and statesman of this country. Upon arriving here, he set up a Jaw practice until the Civil War broke out and then took an active part in t·he fighting. In 1861 he was appo.inted to the position of Minister to Spain and continued serving this country as Secretary of the Interior under President Hayes.

Speaking at the Founder's Day Convocation 1ast Wednesday mark- ing the 144th anniversary of the organization of Union College, Dr. Samuel Eliot Morison, noted his- torian and writer, compared the George WaBhington \New Deal of 1789\ with the New Deal of today. The distinguished Harvard pro- fessor predicted that \The future of our New Deal of 1933 will be very similar to that of the New Deal of 1789. Whatever party is elected in 1940 must continue the fundamentals of the New Deal- government regulation of business in the interest of social secm·it~-. We may have a new admini·stra- tion and a wisel' administration, but it must govern on the same basis as the present one. Dr. Ellery pronounced the invo- cation on the assembly, after which Dr. Tidmarsh Jed the Glee Club in singing Hail, Bright Abode from Wagner's Tannhauser. A selection from the scripture was read by the Rev. Clark V. Poling, pastor of the First Refot·med Church of Schenectady. After an organ se- lection by Dr. Tidmarsh, Dr. George Dwight Kellogg, in a preliminary address, spoke on The Ever Resur- gent College, pointing out the value of the small college and its posi- tion in the educational system. The assembly joined in singing one verse of Tile Dutclunen's Song, snd following this, Dr. Morison was Introduced to the audience. \It is only a few years ago- -13 to be exact-,\ reminded- Dr. Mmison in opening his address, \that we were celebrating the sesquicenten- nial of American independence, and this year we are commemor- ating the 150th anniversary of a New Deal, the first New Deal in American history, the organization of the first .government under the Federal Constitution. . .. \There is a certain fundamental resemblance between the situation in 1789 and the situation today. The Federal ·Government in 1789 was a New Deal, ground out from the bit- ter necessities of the times, not be- cause anyone wanted it for its own sake. It seemed strange and illogi- cal to Americans, who had started a revolution against a centra-l gov- ernment at London which imposed a few taxes on them, to set up a new central government in Amer- ica that had almost unlimited power to tax them. There seemed something wrong to a people who dreaded power as such, who were suspicious and jealous of aH gov- ernment, to be setting up a. presi- dent of the United States who was also commander- in- chief of the army and navy, and who had more power over the lives and future of Americans, if he chose to use it, than George III had ever claimed. \We can well afford to laugh a-t these ap·prehensions of 1789,\ Dr. Morison continued. He descdbed the mounting difficulties of the federal government under the Articles of Confederation which preceded the Constitution, and then went on to say that \the really surpnsmg thing is that enough Americans had the supple- ness of intellect, the grasp of hard facts, and the vision of the future to streamline their government and install a New Deal only 13 years after independence had been de- clared, only six years after inde- pendence had been achieved.\ Af.ter admitting the great danger of drawing parallels between one age and another, Dr. Morison sug- gested that \The events of 1787-97 may help us to understand those of 1929-39, and that our experience of the last 10 years may help us to appreciate what bold innovations the United States made 150 years ago. \Both eras ilustrate the principle that circumstances, material cir- cumstances, U!lter much more rapid- ly than men's minds change to eope <Continued on Page 4) Proposed Mailbox PlanT o Be Dropped ~ --·-- lives of freshmen, sophomores, and juniors in the various fr a- ternities on the campus as Hell Week, the period for i:n- fotmal initiation~. comes to an· end.

R. P. Patte rso'n • 1:2. Named for Bencl1 Senate Approval Needed For Confirmation to Federal Circuit Cour-t Judge Robert Porter Patterson of Garrison, N. Y., an a! um.nu s of Union College in the class of 19:12, has been nominated by Presjdent Roosevelt as a candidate fOI- the United States Circuit Court of A.p- peals, succeeding Martin MaTtton, who resigned while under .fire of graft charges. The nominatio-n of this candidate, a Republican, has been submitted to the Senate for approval. Judge Patterson, a native of Glens Falls, is now 48 ;years old, having received a cum laude de- gree of LL.B. from Harvat·<l in 1915. after completing a three-year course in the Harvard Law s~.bool. While an undergraduate at Union, Patterson was active in varim.r:s or- ganizations: he was a member of the Phi Delta Theta fraternity, manager of the basketball team of the 1911-1912 season, vice-president of the Senior Class, and .rle was actively engaged on Tlte Con- COl'diensis staff and on the illebat- ing team. Phi Beta Kappa 1\lembcl\ During the World War, P:atter- ,;on saw active service as Ca.ptain of the 306th Infantry in the 77th Division of the A.E.F. Later, be ...vas advanced to the post of Ma- jor of the same Infantry, and wa,; awarded the Distinguished Service .::ross for heroism in action in 1918. Grants Garnet Money Makes Recommendations For Idol Improvement, Final Plans for Block U Day An All-College dance with the price of ticket,; set at one dollar per couple will be held Saturday evening, March 18, in the gymnas- ium following the Union-Skidmore joint glee club concert. This was made definite Wednesday evening when the Student ·Council passed a resolution to thio> effect, and Chair- man Yunich apvointed a committee cu!l.':>isting of Louis Can, chairman, John Schultz, 'Rollin Twining, Alex- ander Turchick, and Warren Kim- mey. Whi'le the date of the dance had been tentatively e:;tabLished, it re- mained indefinite pending action by the Council. During the course of the discussion, Stanley Lul>;e, '39, proposed that the dance be made infonnal. Thi,; motion was voted d·own. The dance will begin ai a-pproxi- mately 10:00 o'clock and last until 1:00 a. m. The Council also voted to in- crease the Garnet appro.priation by an additional grant of $73.30. Edi- tor Emest Allnutt submitted the request and declared the money was needed to replace individual senior engravings that were used in last year'\ ·book, and which he had planned to re-utilize but had found to be missing. $50.80 was voted fot· this purpose. The remain- ing $22.50 will be used to cut up the plates on whic:h the senior pictures were run last year. These pictures were engra.ved on blocks contain- ing nine portraits and were cut up ·bY the CQllege Placement Bureau in preparing their senior employ- ment applications; and ·since the Garnet would have been forced to have the ·plates cut had the Place- ment Bureau not done so, the Gar- net staff agreed to pay half of the expenditure involved. Block \U\ Days Besides having achieved di..stinc- tion as a member of Phi Beta Kappa, Judge Patterson was elect- ed to the honorary legal fraternity, Phi Delta Phi, in New Ycnk City. His most recent advancement, prior to his nomination to ti1e •Fed- eral District Court, was his elec- tion. in June. 1937, to the presi- dency of the Harvard Law School \ssociatiort. WilHam Thomas '39, reported for the Block \U\ Committee and an- nounced that the administration had consented to set aside the as- sembly progra.ms on March 30 and 31 for the purpose of honoring Union athletes. It ·is .proposed to make athletic awards on one of the two days and have a speaker on the othe'l'. Thomas declared that his committee was contacting .Tohn Kietan, columni.st of The New Yorli Tintes, on the possibility of hio speaking to the student body on either March 30 or 31. The Counci.l we·nt ~'D \ecord as lmanimolis.ly favot'ing :~~ petition presented to the adminisu·,~ion by Louis Ames, '40, advocating that a course in accounting be taught next year. Y11nich reported that be- cause of the ill·ness of Professor Bronner, chairman of the Social Studies Division, he had been un- able to get a statement from him as to what action would be taken on this petition. ~----a---- Student Identity Cards Offered by the N. S. F_ A. The three speakers are membei'S of the Inter-faith Team of the Council of Ch1·istians and Jews, and these men have sp.ol;en to audi- ences at several colleges and Ro- tary Clubs throughout the east. The principle of thtJir tour. Is to ask each other questions so that the similarities and differences of the r elig.ions may be clarified for the audiences. ... --o--- Bl'onner Family Recove1·ing The meeting will be presided over by President Dixon Ryan Fox and will be broadcast over station WGY from 3:00 to 3:30. The discussion leaders will be Richard A. Douglas, Chairman of the New York State Roadside and Safety Committee, and John B. Stewart, vice-president of the Outdoor Advertising Associa- tion of America. Each leader will speak for 8 min- utes and then will submit to ques- tions from the audience. Mr. Doug- '·las is the author of \Common Sense in Driving Your Car\ is vice- president, of the Argus Company of Albany, and a former editor of the Albany Argus. He is a graduate of Yale in the class of '14 and the Hill School in 1910. While at Yale he was Editor of the Yale Daily News. \The results of the vote indicated a laizzez.-faire attitude on the part of the dormitory residents,\ said Assistant Comptroller Charles Male in commenting on the responses to the administration's query for stu- dent sentiment conceming the pos- sibility of replacing the present open. dormitory mail boxes with centrally located locked boxes in Washburn Hall. Because less than one-quarter of those questioned ex- pressed favor for the suggested change, the administration will talte no further action upon the matter at present. boxes, and 15 supported the sanc- tioned change to Washburn Hall. Oldgym Hall reversed the concen- sus of the two larger buildings, with 13 students wishing to let the matter slide, seven writing in their suggestion of locl:s on dormi- tory boxes, and only two holding with the proposal. Students considering t1ips ab1·oad this summer can economize O·Tt, and facilitate thei·r travels by obtaining lhe International Stude.nt Ia entity Card which is offered by tbe Na- tional Student Federation of Amer- ica to undergraduates of At11erica n colleges, This card, which costs $1.50, more than compensates its owner by the savings in traveling; visas and hotel expense.5 which it entitles its holder to; it also can sec-ure re- duced ·charges on theatre and ·con- cert cha.rges and free adnitt.:mce to museums and galleries. Yunich reported that a copy of ihe Council',; resolution favoring the introduction of a system of optional examinations to be given at .the discretion of the individual professor~ had been forwarded to the divisional heads by President Fox, but that .these men as yet had made no reply. A proposal to investigate The Idol wa.s discussed by Lon Barringer '39, editor of the magazine, who stated that he had prepared a .Jist of rec- ommendations concerning the fu- ture policy of Tlte Idol which he in- tended .to submit to the Publica- tions Board at its next meeting. Yunich deferred action on this l'e- por.t until after it ha-s been pre- sented to the PuMications Board and iL has been acted on by them. The ailing Bronner family is now on the road to recovery, Dr. G. Marcellus Clowe, college physician, told a Concordiensis reporter. Dr. Bronner, who., with his daughter, has been suffering with an attack of the grippe, is now out a bed and Mrs. Bronner, who has had influenza, is now \comfortably ill,'; Dr. Clowe said. At his last visit Dr. and Mrs. RronnPr was much improved. Dr. Bronner will resume his dasses in l·he very near futme. Dr. Fox will take over the classes dur- ing his absence. Mr. Stewart is President of the Outdoor Ad'Vertising Association of Iowa and a partner in the Dixon and Stewart Outdoor Advertising Agency< and former President of the Chamber of Commerce of Clin\ ton, Iowa from where he is coming to speak here. Of the 121 residents reached by the letter signed by the dormitory proctors, 63 replied. Of the 17 North College men who submitted an answer, five favored no change, two demanded locked boxes within each dormitory, and ten agreed with the proposal. In South Col- lege, six held for the status quo, three suggested dormitory locked The totaled result: for no change, 24; for locked boxes within the dormitories, 12; for the Washburn Hall post office, 27. Professor Male explained that, as much as it would like to, the ad- ministt ation is unable to install the proposed new boxes within the sev- eral dormitories because of preven- tive coEts. Since the situation in Washburn Hall would allow access to the back of the boxes, and since the pc~tman, not having to walk so far, could fill them himself, the single unit of locked boxes would be much less expensive to build and operate. It will also be useful as a letter of introduction to EmQ<:pean stu- dent groups. The N. S. F. A. is also s]Jo:nsoring several diff.e1 ent groups ol bicyC'ie and hospitaHty tours whi·-ch are planned for college students. These trips are offet,ed at luw co~t and are under the leadership of .e:x·per- ienced d'irectors in student. move- ments. This is ·one of the sez.vjce.s of· fered to member college,; h .. y N. S. F.

A report from the committee in- vestigating the possibility of secur- ing class keys was read by John Schultz '39, who recommended that sueh keys be obtained from the col- lege bookstore. Mrs. Jenkins, man- ager of the store has indicated her desire to cooperate in this matter, and Arby H~J-lpern '39, who made the original proposal for the adop- tion of a Class key, withdrew his suggestion that they .be obtained through a private dealer.

The proposal is opposed only by Dr. Ti<i- marsh who presents his aeguments ag:aim;t the case. N o11e ()f these do we consider valia. Dr. Tidmarsh ltas said that the reco1·ds, although given to the college for the use of all students, \are <:tctually fol' serious a.ppre· cia tion and not for mere enjoyment\. ·w· e would like to th.ink that this argument \.V!:l.S advanced by Dr. Tidmarsh in haste, and that he did not quite realize how specious it is. Only those who sincerely aprweciate musjc can enjoy it. His othel' argument against the propos::~] is that the class in l\lusic Appreciation makes use of this librm y three times a week and that \to have to go to the library and select the recm·ds for that d<\Y would be a definite disadva.ntage.\ T() this we say th::~t Dr. Tidmarsh. could plan his work i11 atCl· vance, as other instructors do, and that an N. Y. A. worker could deliver the records to be used that week to the Chapel so that be would in no way be inconv.enienced. As far as we can see, the only possible o•b- stacle to the plan is the difficulty of raising the small fund needed for replacing worn o:ut records. The ()bstacle would not be instil'· mountable, and the expense vrould be quite justified. The advantages of the plan are :so obvious as to need no furthe1· e:xplanatiO>n.

Th-i~ statement has been made by the United Stale Office of Education, using a typi- .- , c~l group of American coHeges. ' February 27 ,from 4:00 to 4:30 p. m.. I The script for the program as 'lntramura S It was d-iscovered that one- third of the stuclents d·rop out at the end of their freshman year and: that only one-thitd ever graduate· f1 em the -college they miginally en- ter.

This tournament is going to be scored on a group basis and the more entrants you have the better are your chances of win- ning. Rostaura.nt-Tnp noom-Dcllcatessen GOLD'S ALWAYS POPULAR • Union Loss Below A'>l'l'lt.ge According to Dean C. F. Garis, at Union the loss is considerably less than this figure, but in spite of this, only about 50 per cent of those who enter as f1cshmen l'C- ma:n to graduate. For example, the clat5s of 1938 ente1ed with 247 student\ and graduated only 153, of which number about 18 were not in the class at the time of its ad- mission. An average loss of about 16 per cent of the student body is realized every year when Fresh- men, Sophomores, and Juniors are elevated to Sophomores, Junior·s and Seniors. A college !'ealizes a financial los~ wht'never a student drops out. This is certainly true at Union, where the college spent last year $660 per student and received in return an average of $393.30 from each student, the balance coming from income or endowments. The college provides its students through scholarships, loans, N.Y.A .. and other employment, with about $80,000 or one-fourth of the total 'uition.

Individuals and corporaticms pursuing their own interests had brought prosperity to the com1.try under othcl' circumstance:;, with an open frontier, free marl<ets, and free immigration; but even then there had been recurrent crises and depressions, and it was· just that system of free. unregulated individ- ual enterprise, unrestrained by gov- ernment regulation--or eve-n by common sense and elementary morals-that produced the crash of 1929. 7Jance oli!te Ogarettefwii!t \But it's tnle enough that the New Deal of 1789, liite the New Deal of today, meant a loss of lib- erty. The degree of liberty that in- dividuals and states enjoyed, in 1787, like the liberty that business and finance enjoyed in 1929, proved incompatible wi.th order and Iib- ert~·. Every generation has to strilce a neW balance between liberty and order. The readjustment is painful, and we are all suffering from that pain now.\ In conclusion, he said: \I ask those of you who are out of tune with the times to adjust your minds to this: the age of fr€{) busi- ness enterprise has gone, never to return, unless in the far future, -be- yond our ken. Minding your own business was a fine principle in the 19th century, and made America powerful and the favored ()nes prosperous; but any attempt to ap- ply this principle today w·ould merely ·bl'ing on a crisis much worse than that of 1929, and pmb- ably a violent revolution under some 'crackpot' leader.

Stewart, vice- president of the Outdoor .Advertis- ing Association of America, Inc., marshalled the opposing argu- ments. Elaborate plans ror the wee.kend have been made by John Bigwood, 39, in conjunction with l.i'rederic Wyatt, club adviser. They have been assisted by John Gardiner, '41, and William Kruesi, '42.

The Radio Club is co- operating by forwarcllng weather bulletins to Bigwood and Mr. Wyatt. The area has not been lacked in snow during the first week in March in the past four years. Although the program is infor- mal, some definite features have been planned. The I. 0. C. A. mem- bers will be on the trails all day Saturday.

Dr. Waldron has published many articles significant in the recorded history of the college. These have often been written by faculty mem- bers, including Professors Edward Everett Hale, Morton C.

Others envision him. as the amus- ing person who periodically enlivens a daily assembly program by relating interesting anecdotes about alumni who have made their mark in the \vorld. To many of the alumni, however, \Char- lie\ has a greater significance. He is their representative on the campus. Accurately describing and editing college news with his own \affectionate\ style as editor of the Alullllli Monthly, he has l{ept innumerable graduates in close contact with their alma mater. July 1 of this cunent year will mark 2S years of distinguished service to the col- lege by \Charlie\ as editor of the Monthly, and fittingly enough, he has chosen this date to resign as active head of that magazine, and place its future in the hands of l\Ir. Dan- iel R. Weeks, '28. We would like to take this opportunity to, congratulate both D1·. Waldron and J.\/Ir. Weeks; \Charlie\ becam;e of his remarkable and distinguished service to the college, and \Dan\ because of the enviable post to which. he has been appointed. \Ve are happy to heat· that \Charlie\ will continue to write for the Alumni Monthly, and also continue as secre- tary of the college and the Graduate Council,. as well as director of admissions. l\Iay his services continue to improve life at Union.
