Although briei, tae consideration of the practibility of the new con- stitution, was the most import- a• t .business of the evening. lviem- bers of the Council, still hazy as to what functional representation implies, decided-to take serious ac- tion on the proposed constitution at the next meeting Tuesda.y night. Poor Sweaters In regard to rne· quality of ath- letic awards made by the athletic department the Student Council !:ad appointed a committee to in- vestigate complaints made by ath- letes in spring and fall sports that their Garnet sweaters were of po-orer quality than have been a- warded before. The committee, composed of Winterton U. Day, '38, Hyman A. Enzer, '38, and Louis Carr, '40, reported need for bring- ing the pr-oblem to the attention of the general student body. Suggestion made by H. Laurence Achilles, '38, at the last meeting of the Council to have the present year book published by the junior class a senior class publication was considered by the Council. Dav1d L. Yunich, '39, managing editor of the 1939 Garnet \vas asked to se- cure a report from the present ed- itorial board as to tbe advisibility of such a change. On the question of holding the second all-college dance definite designation of the date was with- held by the Council until word is received concerning a possible change in the hours that dances will be held on Saturday nights. Yunich was appointed a committee of one to see the administration on lhe extension of the 12 o' cloclt ruling. John Krull, '40, chairman of the sophomore discipline committee, re- ported that up to the present date two freshmen had their hair clip- ped for violation of ft·eshtnan rules, Paul Reiger and Robert Schulberg. 0·---- Foote, '32, Writes Article Several members of the Un- ion College staff are being en- vied by their colleagues who are in teres ted in having low license numbers on their auto- mobile.

Whe·n presented by The Guild December 15 and 17, according to the :Bennington Banner \The Con- trast\ delighted the first night audience which \found its light, satiric, treatment\ most enjoyable. The Guild's production does not attempt to burlesque the old com- edy as has so often been done with old melodramas and plays of early American origin, but it presents the characters in such a way as to \bring out the particular kind of grotesque and unconscious humor wJ:Jich they contain.\ Several members of the Benning- ton Dance Group assist in the dance interludes between scenes, \The Contrast\ and \Electra\ are the two Bennington plays now on tour in the east. Scheduled to open January 14th is Clifford Odet's \Waiting for Lefty\ which will be presented by the Play Production Course stu- dents, under the direction of Ed- ward L. Carroll. This play ran very successfully in New Yorlt three years ago when presented by the Group Theatre. A special cast, composed of Mr. Carroll's. course students in the past three years, has been work- ing on the play for almost two months, and it will be presented in conjunction with Professor Cum- min's class in labor problems, which annually makes a study of the laboring classes. Already 300 tickete have been purchased by the C. I. 0. and a nominal charge will be required of students as well as the public to defray production costs. When first produced \Waiting for Lefty\ received enthusiastic recep- tion by labor sympathizers. Yet though called one of the most powerful dramas of the modem stage it was banned in many cities far its social motlf.

The Council is now in the throes of in- decision about what it shall d(} to reform the exisiting evils of the present set-up of stu- dent government. Perhaps a p1·ogram for functional repl'esentation is not practical. Perhaps it is too idealistic. The chiseling cel'emony was played up by one of the local pa]>et·s (this was in 1930) as evidence of Union's tenible shame, shame. Ryder went to Sing Sing- in that year and $1,000 tips to waitresses by \Little lloy Blue of Broadway\ were no more. His name and Union's were flashed across the continent. His death ends a. strange but not entirely sad career. He is now said to have been merely the front fOJ.' a powerful New York criminal syndicate and the leg·ends will con- tinue to roll on forevet·. In publishing the announcement of the appointment of Dr. Lang- sam as Profess()-r of History be- ginning August 1, the Union Star headlined the stow, \Name Lang\ sam to Head :Union History De- partment ... •• Obviously, the headline writer added something: whicl1 was not in the story that Union College of- ficially released to the press. Nothing of the sort. We don't have effi. ciency now and we doubt if there ever will be efficiency in student organization. Our :plea is for student government that will be understood, even if it is not appreciated or liked. Best if it is not liked. More fun. We might as well make it interesting. But at least let us know the terms we are using. We have a student government here. That may be unfortunate in an educational sys- tem. But since we have it, let's make it alive. FELLOWS Union's purposes in securing honorary fellows three years ago for the >benefit of its .students have been slightly impeded by the means to accomplish those ends, Whether it has been the method of conducting round- tables with the visiting personalities or whether it has been due to deficiencies as \'instructors\ in those men is not our prob- lem here. We congratulate the college on its wise selection of Tyler Dennett and Sheldon Cheney as ho110rary fellows in the govern- ment and the fine arts. Both men, like the <Jthers appointed by President Fox, are out- But so long as we can feel confident in our own integrity 1\'hy begrudge Ilmold Itus- sell Ryder the place he undoubtedly deserves in our history-a sensational mistake. MR. BAILEY The magnanimity of Frank Bailey as ben- efactor of Union College comes to us with more force upon investigation of the paet he played in the Ryder fiasco of 1929-30. He suffered heavy financial losses to sustain a bargab1 that could not hold water. His accomplishments as treasurer of the colleg·e for 36 years have been mentioned in part. What he has done materially will prob- ably 11ever be known. But on the anniver- sary of his 73rd birthday (Tuesday) we con- gratulate and thank him for a pe1·servering spirit that is so deserving of eulogy. Dear Tom: We miss you on the corner of South Col- lege. Please hurry and get well. The Boys. F'rom the inq 11ir-ies which the college administration has received, one gathers that there is much tmth in the saying that it is the· l:cadlines and no·t the story which most of us read in newspapers. I hope, therefore, that you will save space in the Concordiensis to pub- lish that no su<!h administrative appointment as ··Head of the His- tory Department'' was made in ap- . pointing Dr. Langsam Professor of History.

C., \and my bread and butter depends on making the right bids. That's why I have to know tobacco values. \Now I've smoked Luckies ever since 1918, and the reason is, they suit my taste to a 'T'. Nobody knows better than we tobacco men that Luckies are made of the finest center-leaf tobacco.\ Yes-and that isn't all ... Luckies' exclusive process, \It's Toasted\ takes out certain irritants naturally present in all tobacco-even the finest! The result is that you will find Luckies not only taste good but are easy on your throat. Surely ,independent experts like Mr.Valentine make good judges of cigarettes .•. Sworn records show that, among independent tobacco experts, Luckies have twice as many exclusive smokers as have all other cigarettes combined! 40.000 60.000 100;000 40.000 54.864 94.864 40.000 53.086 93:086 40.000 51.054 91.054 40.000 49.784 89.784 40.000 49.276 89,2;76 40.000 48.768 88.768 40.000 47.244 87.244 40.000 45.212 85.212 40.000 44.958 84.958 40.000 43.942 83.942 40,000 41.910 81.910 40.000 40.386 80.386 40.000 39.116 79.116 40.000 35.814 75.814 40.000 33.528 73.528 40.000 30.734 70.734 40.000 28.448 68448 .000 26.670 26.670 .000 12.700 12.700 . 000 5.588 5.588 COLLEGIATE WEDDING Believed to be the first wedding held on any Big Ten campus, the marriage of a coed in the College of Education at the University of Minnesota took place in the chapel of the Center for Continuation Study on the Minnesota campus.

Sunday, Investigation Started After Athletes Protest Poor Quality nf Letters Wittner Issues Statement Athletic Dh'ect()r Clarifies Position; Declares Move Is Wananted Student opinion, especially that of athletes who received Block \U\ sweate1 s the past season, is critical of the policy o-f the college athletic. department buying a poorer qual-· ity athletic letter than that of pre- vious seasons. This issue was raised · at the last meeting of the Student Council after a g:voup of athletes had complained. In an effmt to clarify the ath- letic department's p'Osition on the change in sweaters, J. Harold Witt- ner, athletic director, issued the following statement: \The college· has bought O'Shea 6C sweaters for a long time. Whenever another sweater was issued, Spaulding sweaters which are of the same quality, have been used. \The O'Shea. sweater wholesales at $U.W with the letter being extra. . This year's sweater is the same as in the past seasons with the excep- tion of a chenille letter which was used in place of the interwoven. The chenille letter was substituted because it was felt that the saving of a $1.10 warranted such an action .. Any man who prefrerred the old style letter could so so by paying the additional co·st. Students Object The Conc01diensis, In an effort to gain student opinion on the change, inte1-viewed several members of the student body last night. Several men were apparently dissatisfied with the new type letter but refused to make a statement for publication. However, the majority of the men interviewed gave very caustic state- ments. Joseph Annese, 'W, sai-d: \The new letters are the same as those of most high schools. They are much cheaper than the old ones. Con- sidering the work of the boys prac- tically hiring their bodies out to the co1lege, it should be glad to give the athletes the best material in its awards. It's not enough to slave for the college, you have to pay fo-r a decent sweater.\ William Johnson. '40, said: \I am dissatisfied with the new sweat- er beea.use I had to pay $1.10 to receive a decent letter. It's not fair.'J Samuel Hammerstrom, '40, said: \The new letters are not as nice as the interwoven ones. They were something the other colleges didn't seem to have. Something original!\ One student, who didn't wish his identity to be divulged, said: \While other colleges are paying their players, our players almost have to pay to play. The tight-fisted ath- letic department is getting to the point where it is ridiculous.\ 'I'he Student Council appointed a committee composed of Winterton U. Day, ':!8, Hyman A.

The fourth Spencer lecturer will illustrate his talk with the aid of colored lantern slides, depicting the scenes common to life at Oxford. The talk is entitled \The Age and ~outh of Oxford,\ and covers in discussion and pictures the boy's anival in the \City of Spires,\ his enrollment in the college of his choice, and the cerilmony of enter- ing him on the books of the Univer- sity. Daily Routine Next there follows a detailed de- scription of the day's routine. The aud.ence goes with the student from the time he is routed out of bed until he retires again to the solace of restful sleep at the end of the long day. The customs, unique in Oxford, and the examinations and grad- uations which follow three or four years of study, are described. The talk is a revelation, ex- plaining simply the intricate and strange mode of life and teaching in Oxford, It shows the audience Oxford in operation, a sight that the tourists never get in their sum- mer visits made while the univer- sity is closed and on vacation. ~esides giving the values of the Oxford Educational Methods with scholarly insight the talk is thor- oughly sugar-coated with rare humor. ----0---- Skidmorites, C.

The Play Production Course takes an im- portant step forwm·d in edt1cation with the presentation of \Waiting for Lefty\ for Pro- fessor Cummins' labor problem class next week-end. For the past few years students studying the Jabot· movement in this country have also been reading the proletarian liter- ature as part of that study. It is convenient to have such bl'illiant adages, at this point, such a.s \there's more than meets the eye,\ etc., to apply in at- tempting to answer these questions. Yet the one answering them usually fails by still fur- ther beclouding the issues. The fear of obvious propaganda has driven amateur observers of the international scene straight to the arms of the experts of subtle pe1·suasion. Note: Don't fail occasionally to run your eye over the monthly cir- cular \Ten Outstanding Magazine Articles\ issued by a Council of Librarians. The Library posts it on the end of one of the magazine ing and acting he's ()one, We are Worden · · · aloo imterested in a lHJy who has •Editor's Note: This is a lie. been on the ma.nageriai: ~nd of a:n Light just couldn't see Manheim activity\ ... what, no ·marks, Mr. for the smoke.

Originally the students of l\lr. Carroll'::; class were to produce Clifford Odets' elrama 'with myalties paid from student admissions. , The CIO chapter in Schenectad~· immediately took an inte1·est, ;~oo seat~ worth, and tlu· question of finance::; is HOW solved. To us the action of the two diverse colleg-t courses, one in social sciences and the othei in the arts, is probably the most inte1·esti ng aspect of the forthcoming event. The play itself, very attractive as a drama, is in this case subordinate to the m<-tJm· purpose for which it is b€ing produced. Just befol'e the Chlistmas vacation we had occasion to uphold the administration's attitude on the question of free speech. especially free speech in its ilcademic garb. At that time we felt and expressed an abhor- rence for the specific \victim\ chosen to illustrate our liberal attitude. Fritz Kuhn was by no means an ideal subject to elect for that illustration. The study of cumnmnbm in our class- l'Ooms, following the same method of reason- ing as was used by :\1 r. l\lanheim in justify- ing Kuhn, can \i]{ewbe hP rlefendec! anrl fOl' much better reasons. \Waiting fur Ldty\ tww bring::; to the minds and senses of our students what they could enjoy only two-dimensionally be- fore. In appropriate jargon \it's a swell way to hold classes.\ Friday and Saturday nights education gets an obj.ect lesgon that we feel Union col- lege must recognize as extremely important. Here is certainly something to be proud of. We see, and from the intentions of Mr. Car- roll, ther-e will be other dramatizations for the benefit of other courses. Imagine how Yet something must be believed. We're searching for universal peace and we feel the need fot· boycotting the Japanese who, we are told, are utterly unjustified in their pursuits in China. Therefore, edito1·ials pointing out that a lw~·cott of Japanese goods is a boycott upon Americans is very disturbing. \\' e me told that the tax on corporation surplu:.;es has caused the Iecession. Yet in- vestigation of the tax shows that only clear 3Urplus, above all expenditures, is subject to taxation. Naval rearmament is considered a great aid to industry. The Christian Science Mon- itor writes and proves armament as better- ing business is a fallacy. A crusading publication called The Pam- phleteer in its 15th issue presents logical ar·gument on the Asiatic conflict more favor- able to Japan than any written in the better- known unprejudiced journals. Shall we give in to Norman Alley in face of logic? We don't have any definite answers to anything. But we can have definite ques- tions. We're hoping for Universal Peace in bold face, 62 pt. caps., and at the same time we're being led by the nose to slaughter. Jur ears are plugged with the droning mon- otone of suhtle propaganda. Our eyes are ,ixed on \uncensored\ pictures and type. Where are we? LEARNING stands.

Tracy's \Manuel\ was, after all, his own interpretation of what Kipling, the only authority on the subject, in- tended the character to he; he was to be hampered by no limits other than those of his own imagination. And he went ahead to do a fine bit of acting. Bo~·er, however, was selected to play the part of a man who has been inferred to be every- thing from altruist to zany.

He empha- sized the difficulty involved' in de- termining whether lhese t·ars com- ing from outer space were in. wave motion or discharged as a stream of particles. .American Scientists Millikan and Compton have opposing vie1vs con- cerning the cosmic radiations.. Milli- kan claims that their motion is wave-like, and Compton rnaintain:o. that they are pat·ticles electdcall:y charged. Energies of upwards oi . 600,000,00() volts have been computed by the latter physicist. Man has so far been able to build up a labora- tory energy as high as 2,01}.00() volts.

THE L·ECTURE PLATFORM Van Wormer Walsh gave an interesting speech on Oxford University Wednesday night under the Ichabod Spencer Lecture Foundation. It was something that everyone present agTeed was well worth hearing. The three Union College students in the attdience ,hought so too. The number 0f opportunities Union Col- leg·e students miss to cultivate themselves is a sore point in om· educational system here. We cannot forgive the administration, how- ever, for scheduling l\Ir. Walsh on the same nig•ht that Unio11 played N.Y. U. in basket- ball.

M. 0 REVIEW Bookstore Scoops Library You Have Seen Their Faces. Erskine Caldwell and Margaret Bourke-White. $.75 at Booltstore. Those readers who place a prem- ium un originality would do them\ selves a. very good turn by wl).irling to the bookstore and buying one of the six copies of this book. There are 64 full page .photographs which should be worth the scrutiny of any camera esthete quite aside from the ugly social conditions im- plied in them. The 54 pages of tex:t by Erskine Caldwell present clearly and read- a)>ly, without unnecessary emo- tional adjectives, the condition of the sharecropper, called by the au- thor the successor of the planta- tion slave. In this book are aligned the efforts of two experts In their field. There is a contest involved here between picture and word, and it is hard to say which evokes the more concrete response. Caldwell traces the history of the cotton grower from the pre-Civil War era to mod- ern times. Inferring from his thesis, the reader is led. to believe that Lincoln freed the slaves about as much as T. R. busted the trusts. One could almost pardon the whites when, in their desperation concern- ing the source of their misery, they fall upon the blacks and lynch them. As Caldwell put it, black la- bor is found to be more tractable than white, and more easily intimi- dated. Since the philosophy of Business ·is Overwork and . Underpay, the more individualistic white laborer is being rapidiy replaced by the children of the slaves, who are easily cowed, and almost instinc- tively seJ;~.sitive to the demands of their .traditional boss. At any rate, If you don't like to I'ead, there are plctutes for you more expert than anything you'll see in any of the \Gape\ magazines. There are ten millions of these people either floating about or literally bonded to the soJl. · M, V, We heflr from a source close to Bennington College, that their Players had originall:v intended to present \Electra\ here, but fell that out· student body was not the type to appreciate it.

It should be interesting to view tile work of such a group. • * • Tonight, of course, the Play Pro- duction Course is giving \Waiting for Lefty\ in the Mountebanks Theatre.

A form note was sent by the pub- licity director, Ruth Benedict, to the editors of college papere in the east, Inviting them to send review- ers to the show. The scheme worked exceptionally well, for the manage- ment since \Malachy's Miracle\ re- ceived some excellent publicity, even. though pro and con. The pic- tures In Life Magazine two weeks back was further evidence of its powers. Delos Chappell, producer of the play, like all producers, was taking a long shot with a play that seems too \respectable\ in philosophy for Broadway, but it is going along very well now, despite the varying reviews. Geo1•ge Jean Nathan liked it and every student newspaper whose reviews we have seen printed has liked it. Invoiving the Church of England in any conb:oversy usually means lots of theological fire and brime- stone, but \Malli.chy's Miracle\ added the proper touch of the in- congTuous that made it most pleas· ant entertainment. The criticism of Author Brian Another of the British films-to- come is a moving-picture version of George Bemard Shaw's Pygmalion. This may not ma.lte much money, but it's certain to acquire lots 'n' lots of prestige. Ho hum. .T.

The presence of several sophomores has added greatly to the strength of the squad, and al- though he would make no definite pred'iction concerning thE outcome, Coach Wheatley is inclined to be optimistic about his :squad this year. Chuck Passe and Be t·t Brittin, both '40, have already sh.aded some of the college free style records in practice, and it is expecte.d that they will show the same form in the meet tonight. Captain Arnold Gordon is also counted on for points in t'he breast stroke event. Last year Trinity defeated Union 56-21. Its present team shows few new faces and has already defeated M. I. T. 58-16. Not only will they have an edge in experience because of their veteran mermen, but they will also derive some advantage from the fact that theil• all-around strength is so great that no man will swim in more than one event.

There has been some cri.ticism of the council among students l:lecause •the council has been slow in bringing the new form of government into effect. The Co.ncordiensis, in an effort to soun<l stu<lent opinion in the mat- ter, has iBterviewed what it thinks rept'esents a cross-section of stu- dent opini:on. The following statements. were given by ~tudents: Preston T. Reed '38 said: \The· New York State Legislature has delayed t·eapportionment of mem- bership tn that body for eight years; the student council has de.- Jayed action ·on the proposed con- stitutional 1·eapportionment of stu- dent reJlre~entation for eight months. In .both bocUes the DJew set-up weuld entail drastic turn- over in \membership and control. It seems that politicians hesitate when asked to sign their death warrants.~• Ry ROBERT H. FERGUSON \Waiting for Lefty\ proves that you never can be sure. A :presenta- tion of the Play-Production Cours.e,' whose membership is limited, lack of players forced several men Into more than one role. No scenery' was employed. Rehearsals were fewer than for a regular Mounte- banks show. Most of the audiences, ·and especially your revie.wer, thought it would be necessary to entertain a very charitable atti- tude towards the production. Such sympathy proved totally unneces- sary, \Waiting for Lefty\ stood. on its own merits as a fine .production-- deserving to rank well in the dra- . malic record here. Comprised of a series of short scenes, the play is not difficult. It is, however, ex- cellent \theatre.\ Like all gooc1 propaganda plays, \Waiting for Lefty\ has tremendous punch and fire. Perhaps it was this which inspired the cast and director to turn in such a fine performance, Every member of the cast, with but two exceptions, gave a splendid perfomance. All seemed inspired by the force of the drama--and, we are inclined to thjnk, by good direction. Edward Canol! seems to have treated each role with re\ markable sympathy and realism, At any rate; almost every scene brought applause, Friday night, and several times membel'S of the au- Gale H:~ffman '40 stated: \The council is culpable for its inactiv- ity, However, the student body is even mor-e at fault for its lack of interest in the council.\ Man Is More Than Biological Unit Dr. Douglas Horton Says Man's Soul Is Beyond Scope Of Technical Te1·ms dience were noticeably on the edge of their seats. The largest bouquet for the pro- duction belongs to a veteran, Bill Mulvey, Playing three roles, be turned in a topnotch performance in each. Lon Barringer also de- serves lots of applause fm· his role of Miller. If a finer piece of acting has ever been done on the stage of the Mountebanks Theatre <than the scene between Mulvey and Barringer--let's hear when! Equally splendid was Mulvey's role of Fatt, while his Grady was not far behind. Also in line for orchids are: Doug Stevenson (both roles), Jack Malone (who proved critics can act and do it wem, Hal Stephenson, master electrician Chris Cammack, and two non-mem- bers of the course Arlene Hunting- ton and Mathilde Centner. \Waiting for Lefty\ is excellent as what it is--a propaganda play. It is forceful, compelling, and ve:ry dramatic. Yet its propagancHstic element is handled so well that realism is maintained--almost all the time. However, we see no rea- ·son for its being barred in Boston, and other liberal centers, The only objectionable part is the language, and that is objectionable because of its artificiality. If we had some sort of laurel, we'd like to give it to Director Carroll. The characters of \Wait- ing for Lefty\ were real--the re- sult of skillful direction. I. R. C. Asks Carnegie Foundation for Funds Rober.! Haynor '39 said: \Grant- ed the council has a great deal of work to do, I believe that after considering the proposed plan for a year, i:hey should have formu- lated son::te definite action,\ Robert Denzler, '38, said: \I be- lieve the cc>uncil has had adequate time to in vcstigate the proposed system ·IW! it has been used in othe:r institutiocns with student bodies similar toO Union's and that by this time the,y should have crysta.lized their findings in some form of con- crete action.\ The interpretation of man as a purely biological unit could never account for the inexplicable divin- ity which s·ets him apart from other animals said the Rev. Dr. Douglas Horton of the United Church of Hyde Park, Chicago, Ill., in his chapel service Sunday mornjng. Charles Honikel '38, president of the International Relations Club today announced that an effort is being made by the club to secure funds from the Carnegie Endow- ment Fund. If they are success- ful, the club plans to bring prom- inent speakers to the campus to discuss international affairs. Dorothy Thompson, news com- mentator for the Herald Tribune heads their list of hoped for speak- ei·s. However, no effort has been made as yet to contact Miss Thompson, pending the granting of .funds by the Foundation. Father Sheehan, of the Catholic University in Washington was invited to speak but wa.s unable to include Union in his speaking tour, o()'Bl'ien Condemns Union College Mourns · D(3ath of Mrs. Baruch Mrs. Bernard M.

Corinth Carrying off first place in the ski competition, two ·cups, and five medals at the Saratoga Winter Carniva.J over the past weekend, the Union Skl Team jumped from relative obscurity into a blaze of glory. Paced by Warren Gammons,· the team Included Bergstrom, Ladd, Senn, and Wiley. Representatives from R. P. I., Cornell, Syracuse, and St. Law- rence also took part in the ski meet sponsored as part of its Win- ter Carnival by the Saratoga. Wij1- ter Sports Club. Events were held at South Corinth, the down·bill race on the Wildcat Trail and the slalom on Sisto hill. Both races were run in two heats, the sum of each man's times being counted. Dance Interludes Are Included 'The Contrast' Has Been Divided Into Scenes; Four Dances Will Also Be P1·esented Fifteen Union College students who plan to attend the perform- ance of that robust comedy, \The Contrast\ by the Benning- ton College Theatre Studio players, have a rare treat in store for them tonight in the Mountebanks Theatre. Since this will be the only en- Fox Host to Two Classes At 'The Contrast' Tonight President Fox will entertain 40 students tonight at the Ben- nington College production of \The Contrast\ in the Mounte- banks Theatre. After reading the production script for the fa- mous comedy, President Fox in- vited the students in Professor Bronner's American H..istory course and Professor Wainger's American Lit course to attend the performance as his guests. In a sense, the Bennington Players do for these two courses what the Play Produotion Class of Mr. Carroll did last weel{- end for the Social Studies Cou·rse in Labor Problems ·by pr-esent- ing \Waiting for Lefty.\ Union, Skidmore Join Glee Clubs in Concel't On Saturday evening, the Union Glee Club joined with the Skid- more Glee Club to present taeir annual concert.

And when :Bennington turned its attention .to \Brother Jonathan,\ the national press reported the per- formance. The Associated Press drama critic said: \'Brother Jona-- than' emerges alive and drawling from the 11>0-year-old comedy by Royall Tyler called \The Contrast.\ This is the first American comedy, presumably written in 1787 by the chief justice of Vermont to chas- tize the colonists for a.ping British manners. J. J. O'Brien '39 stated: \The council ..should .be condemned for their deLay in acting upon the pro- posed f~rm of government; the new blo.()d which would come. in with the. representation of divers·i- fiecL groups. to increase council ac- tivity ·bec.ause re-eiection of mem- bers w.ould depend upon the work they would accomplish.\ To reduce the value of man to the debasing terms of dollars and cents and to an explanation of J:Jis being merely tbroug'h sci6ntific illustration does not do justice to those qualities· of goodness·, hon- esty, happiness and spirituality which are akin to his character, said Dr. Horton. \We as human beings, do not seem qualified to be happy as a biological unit. There is that in the human saul which is beyond the comprehension of the t€il·ms of the world Vlhich transforms us into. ministers of the eternal.\ The International Relations Club is also considering plans for a series of roundtable discussions similar to those held last year by the club. The roundtables cE-ntered around current problems. with member of the club and faculty taking part in the programs which were broadcast over .station \VGY. In Saturday's downhill event Warren Gammons, Union ace, negotiated the distance twice with no falls and perfect form and con- trol to win b'oth heats. John Senn of Union followed closely for sec- ond place with MacDonald of Syra- cuse third. Jack Bergstrom, Union captain, was dazed in a fall and placed four-teenth in the second heat. Ill the slalom Sunday Gam- mons easily led his field with times of :53 and :49 seconds. Again SeilJl followed with a »trQng §econd with Bergstrom in this case third. Union received the gold-plated troph)T of the Winter Sports Club. Gammons was given a cup for high individual score, and along with Senn and Bergstrom accum- ulated several personal medals. Prior to the concert, the Union men were entertalned at dinner at Skidmore Hall at which about 10 Skidmore faculty members were present; folloVIing the concert, a. dance was held at the Cochran gymnasium with music by the '\Isle of Blues\ orchestra. The next scheduled concert is to be given at the Greenwich High School on January 22. 'f'he affair will be sponsored by the Green- wich High School Alumni; ar rangements are being made by J. Harold Ripton, a Union alumnus and principal of the school. Boston Banned \The Contrast\ \Brother Jonathan,' one of the patriots who did not ape the Brit- ish, stuck in the public mind as the stock stage Yankee, and even- tually became the physical proto\ type of the cartoonists' Uncle Sam.\ Boston of course banned this sa- tirical comedy, but the shrewd Yankee producers managed to pre· sent the play there after adve:r- tlsing that they V/e:re offering \A Moral Lecture in Five Parts Called the ContraSJt.\ Completes Mountebanks Exchange The Mountebanks are returning the courtesies extended by the Bennington College players last spring whe.n Union College pre- sented Maxwell Anderson's \Win- terset\ at Bennington.

They haV(l been rehearsing for the past week in preparation for their initial concert and introduction to the Union student body sometime in the near future.

Yunich, '39, to play at th€ second formal All-College dance which will take place Saturday night, Febmary 5, in the Alumni Gymnasium, it was learned tonight . Wednesday, Jan. 19.-Fear that the attempted reform of the Union Colleg-e student government would prove an un- wieldy, inefficient system divided the Student Council to- night in a heated discussion on the plan for functional repre- sentation. Tonight's meeting was the flrst<$>---------------- devoted to a thorough analysis of the broad problem of the new form of government, following a weekly perusal of the constitution which was submitted in Septembe1· by Vilmar Bose, '38. Discussion on all the specific articles drawn up by Bose had not been completed. But the Council fert that it was necessary to dis- cover whether it was advisable to continue revising and considering the details of the new constitution when many of its members felt that the change would perhaps not prove so desirable as first believed. President Winterton Day empha- sized strongly that the major ques- tion before the Council was not the specific machinery for government which has been suggested, but the general plan to broaden the repre- sntation of the council. To Have Four Groups As the plan stands now there will be four kinds of representa- tion: from all activities, from fra- ternities, from neutrals and from classes. Council Changes Garnet To Senior Production Wednesday, Jan. 19.--The Student Council tonight unani- mouely voted to change The Garnet to a senior yearbook, afle1· hearing arguments from its own members and the present editorial staff of the publication for such a change. A list of recommendations for the publication of the senior yearbook has already been drawn up by the The Garnet at the request of the Council and will probahly be used by the lating the program on which Publications Board in formu- the new Garnet will function. Principal suggestion made was that the junim• class con- tinue to edit the yearbool{, with the seniors as thP. featured class. G.Ep Personnel Man Addresses A.I. E. E. Colleges Must See Needs Emp-hasizes That Professional .Administration Is Needed In Government Chicago, Jan. 21-The Union Col- lege plan of instructing students in the practical aspects of government was outlined by President Dixon Ryan Fox in an address here this afternoon. Speaking before a ses- sion of the twenty-fourth annual meeting of the Association of Amer- ican Colleges, he emphasized the nee dof professional administrators in government and urged that col- leges assist in training them. \Our colleges must be sensitive to the contemporary needs of the American people and especially to their- futlU'e needs,\ Dr. Fox said. \I do not mean that they should re.spond to every new fashion of thought o:r interest any more than I think that they should reproduce a scheme of instruction adapted to the thirte-enth century. Surrender P1ivate Concerns DR. KASiliUR FAJANS Dr. Rasimir Fajans, one of the world famed chemists exiled by Nazi Germany, will address the 201st meeting of the Eastern New York Section of the American Chemical Society which is sched- uled tt> take place in the Union Col- lege Chemical Laboratory, Wednes- day, January 26 at 8 p. m. Preced- ing the meeting there will be an informal gronp dinner In the Hale House dining room at 6:45p.m. The· subjedt of his address will be \The Types of Chemical Linkage in the Light of Refractometric Investiga- tions.\ Faculty Applauds Bennington's Worl' The Bennington College Thea- tre Studio players were accepted ve1y enthusiastically by mem- bers of the faculty last Tuesday evening in their presentation of \The Contrast\ in the Mounte- ·banks Theatre. Dr. Frederick L. Bronner, of the ;,ocial studies division, prophesied that there would be a complete sell-out if they ever play on the campus again. Mr. Frank J. Manhiem, s.lso of the Social Studies division, said that the production was excellent and looked forward to a re?turn engagement. \I parti- cularly enjoyed 'Native Virtue' as she reminded me a great deal of Freddie Bronner.\ Mr. Codman Hislop, of the English Department, comment- ed that \it was a nice example of what can be done with full time attention to the theater. 'Glee Club to Sing In Second Concert P:resident Dixon Ryan Fox also announced that beginning with the forthcoming event all Saturday night dance~ for the rest of the col- lege year will henceforth end at 1 a. m. instead of 12 a. m. The festivi- ties for the February 5 affair will start at 9 o'clock. Tickets for the second All-College will go un sale Friday afternoon in all fraternities, the bookstoie, the news bu1·eau, the ,;tudent activities o!Hce awl Tun;,:'s Bat bershop. The tax: wiil be $1.50 until February 2 when it will be raised to $2. Yunich declared that the action of t11e administration in changing the Saturday night rule indicates its willingness to further the social activity of the college. Incidental anangements are not entirely com- plete for the program, but the ma- jor· pwblems have now been set· tled. Chaperons for the dance will be announced next week. Jacl{ Lanny's dance band, noted for its \rockin'-rhythm. has played at most colleges in the east, includ· ing U. S. Military Academy, Wil· Iiams, Hamilton, SyPacu.se and Dartmouth. The wee!' before it plays at Union it will perform at the Glens Falls Ball for the Presi- dent\ Party and on February 12 ii iJl scheduled to appear at the Cor- n~!! Junior Ball. These four groups will make up the Student Council, approximately 40 member·s. From this group will be elected an executive committee of seven, subordinate to the larger group, and meeting in between the times that the Council held no meetings. Day said thus would be solved the present problem of hav- ing too large a council to deliber- ate efficiently and too small a council to get representative opin- M. M. Boring Tells Engineers What Industry Wants One of the striking social de- velopments of recent years, de- clared Dr. Fox, has been the in- creasing surtender of private con- cer= into public care and manage- ment. The growth of large corpora- tions, the rapidity of modern com- munication and transportation, the intense specialization of. the pres- ent day, have resulted in demo- cratic governments being intrusted· to perform many services for the individual and being invested with the authority and function as an umoire to see that his interests were not jeopardized, Dr. Fajans is a native of Poland and was alsll trained in Germany, Switzerla.nd, and England.

A survey made by Mr. Boring has shown that, while there were from 200 to 250 corpora- tions who were hiring college grad- uates in 1927, today there are ap- proximately 1,800 such businesses who have personnel men vis1ting col- leges throughout the country .

The sym- pathetic treatment shown in Tues- day's performance gave the audi- ence the treat of experiencing the flavor of a drama of another day. Yet the intended humor of the play was really funnier and more en- joyable than a burlesque would have been. So well-executed was the entire Bennington production that no in- dividual actor stood out. All were equally good in their roles, al- though the male members of the cast seemed to be perhaps a little superior to the girls. It was interesting to note the first evidences in \The Contrast\ of types and patterns which later be- came standard fixtures in Ameri- can drama. Among these were the dances and comedy skits before the· curtain which presaged the advent of vaudeville, the smooth villian, Dirnple, later a standard character in melodrama and Jonathan, the first sltetch of \Uncle Sam\ and perhaps the first suggestion of \Babbitt.\ Aside from the excellence of In· terpretatlon a11d acting, the Ben- nington production was striking for its smart mounting and costuming done by the students themselves, Dr. Tiamarsh has chosen many the Sillima.n Hall basement. types of music for his group, rang- Edward N.

STANDING PA:T The Student Council searched J.tself Wed- nesday night and discovered thst after three m.onths consideration of a pr()posed constitu- tion for a new kind of student government th.ere was much dispute as to tiLe ::Practicality of such a government. The objection to the suggeE:lt~d constitu- ti(Jn may be justified because o:i s-pecific pro- posals or articles therein, but .. s t() the sug- gested form of government-tba.t of en- la.:rged student representation c.n the council -there is yet no tenable basi.s :fol!' argument. The Council can make any kind of provisions it desires to fit the :frame~vrOl'k (}f \fune- ti<Jnal representation.\ We are rlllther touched by t!Ie seriousness with which the Council has con:sidered the possible inefficiency of the new form of gov- ernment. It seems slightly pua.doxical under the present system. Our hope for a governmenio] ely-slum will probably never be fulfilled. Jlowever, we can try to :put something ne'iiiV into .effect which from all <>utward as:pe~ts- will make student government an interestiJ1g pl•oposi- ti:-on. According to one of the argunents against the new form of government, tllie new Stu- dent Council would be a hea\?'y-footed ma- chine, dull and slow-moving, ~c:attSe ()f the many divergent interests. Of i(!:ourse, that can be used as a very forceful a..rgument in favor of a new form of gove:rnllltent. Stimu- lation of ideas and all that. A council or house of xeJlrEsentatives is what the proponents are aim.iiLg for, Added to which is an administrative l:l().dy- which can be controlled by the maj()tJt3;1 and which will be small enough to opera.te with some d:€gree of efficiency.

Ciesinski to Slart Coach Nelson Nitchman indi- cated today that Adam Ciesinski would be the starting center for the yearlings, and that Johnny Canfield would be sure to start at a guard post. The other three players who will be chosen to start the game for Union will be picked from Arnold Rathlev, Alexand€1' Turchicl(, Janek Vannier, Howard Mott, and. Bill Ford. Ford is nurs- ing a bad eye and Ciesjn.ski a cut on the face which resulted· when the two players came together in a recent scrimmage session. The weakness in the team in their first two games, in which they have been trounced by the Troy and Mont Pleasant High Schools, has been that the individ- ual players have not been mentally alert and physically relaxed, the t.wo prime req uisite.s for success- in athletic competition. During the week the team has· loolted a little better in practice than previously, but there is still evidence that the men nee·d a more extensive training in fundamentals .

Allow me to approve heat·tily the action of the Student Council in appointing a committee to investi- gate the varsity sweaters 1ecently purchased by the athletic depart- ment. However, this seems .only one phase of a much larger problem that merits the attention of the en- tire student body. Anyone attending one of the ath- letic contests during the winter season cannot fail tu be unfavor- ably lllllHCs\'ed by thll poor equip- ment ol L:nion teams. by this 1 1 e- fcr spec ific:ally to the basketball and swirunung teams. The former squad is for-ced to to carry on with only a s we :at shirt of the regular variety furnished to all ft·eshmen and no sweat pants at all. Many weal tl unks that at·c hangovers from their fr ush equinn1cnt while uthers 1vear the satin trunks worn by teams itt previou8 year,;. The natators, too, have no sweat suits and have only the towels furnished by the ruanag~r,; to wear between events. HE SEllS TOBACCO TO THEM All With every opponent on the Union schedule appearing in uni- forms that make Union look like West Middlesex; Junior High how can Uniutt men help feelmg in- dignant about the appeal ance of . their teams? Especially when they know th.at the athletic department boasts a surplus for last year and the past several years. And the failure of the athletic department to co-operate with the students in explaining the necessity for such drastic erunomies has created a great deal of antagonistic feeling between the two bodies. T h e p e r s o n a I inconvenience caused the athletes who are handi- capped both physically and psy- chologically by this unwise saving is also an important consideration. 'With these shortcoming and the many othets in this line, chief of which is the need for resurfacing Alexander Field, it would seem that the time has come for the athletic department to come out of the huddle and show, with a couple of straight line plays, what should be done with that $2,000.000 surplus of last year.
