A nerve system for energetic skyscrapers Long before the huge bulk of a new sky- scraper looms up, Bell System men have planned its nerve system- the maze of tele- phone cables and wires so vital to its busi- ness activities. From the inception of a building design, telephone engineers work hand in hand with the architects. They determine the telephone needs of thousands of future tenants. Then they plan cable shafts rising from cellar to roof and the grid of un.der-floor ducts that will put telephones within easy reach. of every occupant. There's a real thrill i11 working out these plans, for without telephones the immense structures of today would l!ardly be practicable.

C. Maxon, Jr. Tuesday, October 6, 1931 THE BAND Criticism, however sharp and bi.tter, may also be constructiv.e. Truly, it is not polite t<J be cynical, but there are some organizations Oil Union's campus which need some scathing com- ment to awaken them to the rea1izdion of their possibilities. In .such a situation is the p1·csen t college band. To even caU it an organization is an ironic co1npliment. To attempt to portray its actions would be humorous. For the chief delight of the hand is to convey to its tortured 11earers the strains of a march that faintly re- semble the melody of o·ne of Sousa's master- pieces. Year after year we have listened to i-t and no relief seems to be in sight. There is no reason for such a situation. The band could b-.: Believe it or not, all elections are run under the system of the secr.et ballot. So do not be misled simply because you had to sign your name to your ballot. If you voted for the right . men you may win a cigar, or a managership. To continue, did you know that only the men running for certain offices counted their own ·ballots? So, unless your men win, you may get a haircut for nothing. Furthermore, only thirty-five men voted in the senior class elec- tions. Consequently, the majority by which one man wins will necessarily he small. It would $Cern that there were just enough voters to make a. good \deal\. Also, out of the student body of eight hundred men, only one hundred and fifty-six voted in all class elections. Evidently the l'emairting six hundted and £ol'ty-foui' did not consider the nominees worth the ten cent poll tax.. And six hundred and forty-fom stu- dents can't be wrong!

Like everything else the useless ones fade away, but those that h:nnain receive greater emphasis. Tl:te freshmen-sophomore scraps pe1~form a definite function in college li:fe. Th.ey keep peace · and. tranqui!Uty among the student .body. When these scraps were ililst initiated is purely speculative, but· they probabl:y, had their origin in the growing. discontentment of the . three upper chl.sses. In the early days of Union, students had more time to wot·Jt their will and ven- geance upon the lowly freshman. They devoted: hours inventing de- vices and formulating diabolical schemes t<> inundate the fr·eshmen with a torreD.t of fear and awe. But thei-r efforts were frustrated by their own i11abHity to single out the objects of their condemnation. Freshmen, too, often circumvented their plans by masque:vading as sophomores . .Accordingly, the fresh- man cap was introduced, and 11f;il• ized as a token that should not only aid the upper classes in apprehend-. ing freshmen, but should ever re- · mind the fl'eshman of his place. Reas<On for Tomato During these early years, the scraps, with a ,.few intermissions, lasted throughout the year. Fbr very good 1:easons, the faculty, an- noyed witho :tlle steady interruption, sets aside certain days for these. students t<>ucnaments. The question regarding arms was not especia.Jly difficult to solve satisfactorily. 'I'he tomato :was selected because it ap- proximated .the color garnet; the salt, white. Whether the so]lho- mores hoped to sprinkle salt on the freshinen~s t:aHs, for in those days they wore th.eir hair as our present radical musicians· do, is again pUl'e- · ly conjectural. · The cane jjght was the con-se- quences of more class anim<>si,ty. The sophomores :were all right; but they were not juniors or seniors, Which, of co-urse, mean:;~ they vtere nothing. .After the official battles were conclU<led, the. sophomores un- der the guise of juniors went in, search of niore trouble. On a eer- tain occasioo after the last bit of damage had been charged to the · upper classes, the sophomoa:\es among whcm, at that time, was a P.oet or bett.€i' still a prophet, <le- ct<led at the. r.ecommendation of the Prophet, to take every precaution th.at on tb.e ·following year tbey might not s11f.t'er from their folly.

The team has lost three of last year's outstanding track stars in the persons of Aussicker, Harris, and McCaugue. Ketz hopes to find enough promising material in the intramural meet to build up a win- ning team around the veterans re- main-ing from last season's team. It is expected that the interfrat- ernity meet will prove of great in- terest, due to the new rules which have been put into effect by Coach Ketz. The 125 entries are indica- tive of the great interest that has been shown in the meet, and it is sure that it will be the most out- standing meet, as far as interest :1nd spirit go, that has ever been held on the Hill. The meet started at 4:00 P. M. this afternoon with a representa- tive group of potential athletes en- . tered in the 100 yard dash, the 880 yard run, the shot put, and the dis- cus events. Tomorrow's events in- clude the 220 yard dash, the 120 yard low hurdles, the pole vault and the javelin throw. For Thurs- day, the schedule includes the 440 yard run, the 70 yard high hurdles, the high jump, and the broad jump. The concluding- event, the 880 yard relay will be held on Friday.

Take Pride in Contests The cheering at the Amherst game was better than usual, but where do all the students go in preference to supporting their team and why . .not four cheer leaders rather than two? And who stole the trousers of some of the band's uniforms? Can't that organization learn some evolutions and march about for the entertainment of the spectators, or at least lead the pro-· cession? The patrons of yom· sports have • a right to expect a show for their . money and their loyalty, at least comparable with the enthusiasm. and planning that is shown at other small colleges. If we are in error about other colleges, we can, in any event, urge that all of us; i. e., your teams, your alumni, your many well-wishers in Schenectady and vicinity, and you of the under- graduate body cooperate to makP the athletic contests held on Old· Union's campus events in which we may all take part and likewise take considerable pride.

'l'rips were made ~very afternoon by the various sections to the neighborhood of Clifton Parle . The trip led through fields, wood- lots, and in the vicinity o-f a small pond. During the walk the students were able to, see living specimens of varim.ts plants, herbs, shrubs, trees, mosses, ferns. and lichens. This is the first time in over a . year that the Biology Department has organized field trips for t11e sections of Biology 1.

Field Tomonow TRADITIONAL RIVALS Both the Garnet and R. P. I. Teams Employ Aerial At- tack Effectively Once again Alexander Field will be the scene of a stirring gridiron battle in which tradition will play a large and influential part. Soul- stirring deeds will no doubt come to the fore in tomorrow's clash which will witness the meeting of two ancie11t rivals, Union and R. P. I. Comparative scores will mean nothing as both combinations will have something far greater to fight for. Tradition will once again ~harge the gridiron with electricity vhich will not be dispersed until ~he final whistle is sounded. Captain Gregory Lippitt will )nce more lead his team into the Pray. Union, :by virtue of its over- Nhelming victory against the Ho- bart eleven, last week, will enter lhe contest as the favorite·. The Engineers, however, are still to be reckoned with for their 13:-3 triumph over C. C. N. Y. last week, gives them some claim to power. Cheny and White, whose aerial at- tack turned back the New Yorkers will be a strong factor in the R. P. I. offense. At>1·ia! Attack Thf:' con test tomorrow will, with- out a doubt, be a clash of two sim- ilar· styles of play. Both elevens have haHed their scoring plays around a passing attack. Union's 33-7 victory over Hobart was the direct result of an extremely effec- tive aerial game. Greg Lippitt heaved 16 passes, 13 of which' were successfully completed fQr long gains in yardage. R. P. I. la{!ks anything which even remotely resembles an im- . pressive str·ing of victories, last ·week's tt·iumph being theii· lone achievement of the yea.r. They dropped three clashes early in the season, losing to Springfield, 52-0, William, 35-13, and Clarkson, 13-6. According to reports, the allot- ment of 500 tickets which was sent to Troy is pretty well demolished. Our own ticket committee has re- ported that the stands are filled on both sides down to the 15 yard line. Last minute sales should fill the bleachers. The cheer leaders and the band will be out in all their glory and these along with the usual fresh- man display, will aid materially in kf'eping the rooters of both schools interested.

Larrabee, head of the De])ai'<tment of Phil- osophy, has been notified by the Marq.uis de Crequi-Montfort, presi- dent of •the Societe des American- istes; of his eleetion to that soci- ety at its meeting in Paris on Oc- tober 6. The sodety is composed almost entirely {if European sav- ants who are int~rested in the sci- enHftc study of tll.e history of North and South Amerka:. Its member- ship includes a comparatively small number of Ameri<:an scholars, most of whom have had their works published in EUI·ope. Professors La.rrabee'.s election was in recognition of his recent re- searches .in connection with the Yorktown sesqui-centennial cele- bration and of his interest in Eur- opean il1fluence.s on American thought. · · His researches in the field were publisl}ed as featv.re articles in the Schenectady ·and Albany papers, and several stories concerning the present status of Russia and Ger- many have appeared in The Con- cordlensis. During the past sum- mer, Dr. Larrabee conducted a tourist party through Europe, and, while on the continent, did research wor:\{ of note. At present Dr. Lar- rabee is condueting an. evening course, together with Professors Bennett and Cummins of the Eco- nomics department, on the econ- omic and social aspects of modern thought. ~-~-a~~~~- '; lee Club Will Present First Conee1·t on Nov. 7 Dr. Jones, a graduate of Prince- ton university, is a warm friend of Switzerland and has done consider· able research work on the ihfiuence .of French Swiss on science in the United States.
