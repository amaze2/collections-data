PR]CE FIVE GENTS Ligon Experiments On Development Of Character Traits Advanced Psychology Class To Have Aided in Testing 250 Children Study Child Development Project Receives Coopel\ation Of Albany Westminster Presbyte1ian Church Fifteen students of advanced psy- chology, under the guidance of Dr. Ernest M. Ligon, assistant profes- ~or of psychology, are now engaged m the measUl·ement of special apti- tudes and abilities in children as an important part of an extensive study of the nature and develop- ment of character being carried on by the field of psychology and the \Vestmin$ter Presbyterian Church of Albany. Twice each week children are br-ought to the psychology labora- tory and subjected to tests, design- ed to measure such traits as: intel- ligence, motor coordination, musical aptitude, art aptitude, mechanical ap~i.tude, problem ~olving, language ab1ilty, vbual and auditory acuity, and learning ability. This is based vn the p~ycho!ogical principle of in- dividual differences. About two hund1 ed and flfty to three hundred children will ha\'e been te:;ted by the end of Sp1 ing. They range in age from one year to fifteen or six• teen. rrog-ress ::.\i[easured J~:.ccording to Dr. Ligon, theo- r·ettcal programs of characrter edu- cation have been developed by the hundred but have been applied without measurement of their value. Unless groups are measured in the character traits being developed ?oth bef(}re and after being sub- jected to the training program, and compared with other groups which have not had this training it is im- possible to learn whether the train- ing i.s worthwhile or not. The Union-Westminster project is con- cerned with such measurement. One of the major aims of the whole project is .the development and re- finement of new measuring scales for psychological traits. \Valuable Training\ metals a.re somev;h.at destr~ctive; Not only will the demonstrations Industrial Democracy lecture of the whereC:I.S, the new method w1ll en- reveal at least six of the research season Wednesday ev en.i1115, Feb! u· able a metal to be .aJ:lalized ~ th, ~~- ·projects· being •carriPd on at pres- a1y 5, m Memonal Chapel un the tle or no harm.

Bl'Uckner festival, or a Festival of SCIENCE AND PSYCHOLOGY The question as to whether or not human character can ever be scientifically measured and its future developments predicted. with any degree of probability has long concerned philosophers, educationists, and students of the social sciences. Secure in the hard-earned knowl.edge of their limited fields, some physicists and chemists have scoffed at the pretentions <>f the rasher psychologists to \scientific ob- jective knowledge of the workings <>f the human mind. They have asserted dogmati- cally that man's behavior will never subrni t to aecurate measurement and reliable exper- imentation. Psychology, they say, is not, and probably will nev.er become, a science in the true sense of the word. And the fact that psychologists themselves have disagreed vio- lently on many basic questions of plincipl€ and procedure has contributed to the wide- spread skepticism with which their findings have received. But deciding beforehand whether or not psychology is a true science is usually stupid, and at best futile. The wise sci.entist does not apply to unfamiliar matters a type of hasty judgment which he would never think of using in his own field. And the wise psychologist goes about his work with- out presupposing its value and permanence. These things come aftBr the experiments are performed and the results tested and retest- ed. Only the future can decide. So it is too soon to say very much abou.t the experiments in personality and charac- ter shaping which Dr. E. M. Ligon's ad~ vanced psychology students are conducting with the co-operation of the Westminister Presbyterian Church in Albany. The stu- dents themselves make no rash claims f()r the ultimate value of their work.

FATEFUL FRACTI()NS There follows an analysis of the marks re- ceiv.ed by the Dean's Office fro-m any Union College professor: Student Smith receives 50.347 because he slept on the wrong day. Student Jones is awarded 91.111 since he not ()nly did all the assignments better than the average but also because he showed considerable interest in an article written by a certain member of the faculty. Student Smith is given 89.9.99 because, alas, hi.s last h()ur examination came at the bottom of the pile and the corrector was so fatigued ..•• Student Jones gets a flat 60.000, which in truth is a])out .5923 bet- ter than he deserves but his fa.ther once did the professor a good turn. Because his handwriting is so very legible and his. com- mand of the English language extremely good, Student Smith's grad€ is ~1.113. Student Jones would have found proof of an advertisement for typewriters, since all his double spaced papers are so neat, but all possible benefits were more than counterbal- anced by the fact that Professor ate Welsh rabbit and .shrimp salad to excess, conse- quently spending a sleepless night. Mark- 59.999. Student Smith, Wh<>se paper was next, contrasted with Jones S() much in his display of knowledge, that the least he could be given was 71.228. Jones, the next in line, threw back several direct quotatio-ns from lectures, and cheered up the p1·ofessor with a bit of his own humor: 87.492 for him. At this pgint Profess-or gets disgu.sted with life in general and with attempting to differen- tiate between relative merit in particular, and gives the entire class a blanket grade- which is pl'ohably the wisest policy after all. mad revelry Saturday night as the and the editors, will not end so It might be wise to append the Mountebanks celebrated another successful production. .After the abruptly as did last week's.

The game will be the first that Union has played on the new rink since the opening contest with middle- bury. Union's first year men took a heartbreaking defeat last Saturday evening when they lost out to· the Nott Terra.ce five by a single point. Behind during the entire contest, ex.cept for the opening seconds of play when Halpern sunk a free· one for the first sc«>re, the Garnet bat- tled the high schooJ.ers during the second half with such determin- ation that they outscored them by six points.

Syra- cuse overwhelmed the Garnet in the final period of that first game, breaking through the second string line for its scores. The combination of Captain Bet- ters and Gillman, who were the main factors in Union's latest loss, will again be active for the Orange six this week. Last Thursday these two worked together well, with the other wing Smith and defense-man Guenther contributing in the fine pass work and shooting. Union's lineup will undoubtedly remain the same against the Salt City team, with Ken Tompkins as goalie, Captain Phil Little and Johnny Wold as defenses, Fritz Hawley as center, and Hugo Bel·g- man and \Doc\ Orton as wings . Much of the responsibility for the outcome of the game will rest upon the spares Emans, Warner, B()nd, Kennedy, Merriman and Brey- maier. The contest will start at 2 o'clock on the new hockey rink.

We have more contributors this y~ar titan we did last,\ he said. \At tlte present, in fact, we have enough spare material to make up a whole new issue.\ Featherstonhaugh explained the several new features for the Idol which he believed should tend to increase the numbe~· of contribu- to-rs and subscribers. \We now list the names of the contributors on tl::te cover,\ he said. \This both helps the appearance of the mag- azine and gives the readers a chance to see at a glance who has contributed to the issue.

Doig Friday, February 7, 1936 FARE WELL TO REFORM The present editorial staff of The Con- cordiensis has taken a sort of perverse pride in the fact that since they assumed control last spring, they have resisted all tempta- tion to publish any editorials on courtesy in the daily assembly exercises. Time and again our resolution has been stretched almost to the llreaking point. We have marveled at Dr. Fox's patience and g'()O<l temper as each day he is obliged to stand and wait llefore reading the announce- ments while scores of latecomers bustle into their seats, chat with their neighbors, and call greetings to their friends across the aisle. Yet there is never a word of 1·eprimand from the president, only courteous patience until the noise subsides. In the past, admonitions, reprimands, in- dignant editorials, had no effect on conduct in assembly. It is our firm belief that they nEver will have any affect. People just don't respond to an appeal to their better natures. We describe the daily assembly situation, not as a deplorable fact, but merely as a fact. Now it seems certain that the courteous example of Dr. Fox is having no effect. Cour- tesy is not contagious. We should give up trying to reform. Let us admit that, if they a:re given the chance,· 20 per cent (and this is a cautious estimate) of the student body will stroll into the chapel after the proceedings have begun, interested only in getting to their seats sometime be- :liore the markers have left the building. 'I'hese latecomers distu:rb those who come en time, and are trying to hear the speaker. They give the speaker a very unfavorable imp:ression nf Union if he is a guest, and confirm that impression if he is a student or professor. And too often ·starting as-sem- bly must be delayed because most of the audience is in motion. There is only one thing to lle done; Shut LABORATORY IN GOVERNMENT Union College is peculiarly well situated for students of government. It is only a few miles away from the third largest govern- mental center in the .United States. Only the national administ:t·ation at Washington and the New York city government spend more money each year than does the state gov- .=mment at Albany. Dr. Patterson T. French's students in .State and Local Govemment are taking ad- vantage of their opportunities to observe the .Lctual \Vorkings of Albany's greatest \in.dus- try.\ Visits to the legislature and committee .,;essions, inspection of various state depart- 1nents, talks by state officials, and confer- ences with governmental experts are all on the ambitious schedule of this class. Earlier in the week the class attended the public hearing on the budget, and similar ex- peditions are planned in the future. Quoting from Dr. French's statement in the Alumni .Monthly: \1n order to see the governmental wheels go round, the class will make at least three trips to Albany in -::he next two months. They will attend one or more of the Monday evening sessions of the Legislature, as well as important committee hearings which 1nay be open to the public. In February, they will spend an afternoon or two in Albany, listening to short talks by officials on the ·work of the departments. Commissioner Osborne of the Conse1·vation Department, in particular, has indicated his interest in this feature of the work and has promised the co-operation of his depart- ment.\ The plans which were announced last year for \laboratory work in government\ are be- ing realized into a project of real educational value. EDITOIRIAL CONTEST Of all the problems confronting the Amer- ican people today, none is more challenging than that of how to keep the United States out of war. Nurnemus methods are proposed to accomplish this aim, but none has aroused more interest and discussion pro and con, than the various forms of neutrality legis- lation now before Congress. The issues which the question of neutral- ity legislation raise are confusing, highly de- batable issues which demand clear thinking and intelligent appraisal. College students in particular are interested in the subject, be- cause the policies adopted this year will di- rectly affect them. They have to fight the war if the nation's efforts to keep peace fail. In conjunction -with a nation-wide contest for the best editorial written by a college student on the subject: \Will Neutrality Keep Us Out of War?\ The Concordiensis will conduct a similar contest for Union stu- dents. The best editorial submitted to the editor will be published in The Concordiensis for March 20. All student$ m·e eligible except members of the Senior Board of The Concordiensis. Manuscripts will be judged by an impartial committee of the faculty. Union students have showed an active in- terest in national problems-in the class- room, in the club meetings, debates, lectures, even in bull sessions. This contest is an in- centive to clarify that interest, to get those opinions set down on paper. Clarification it- self is just as valuable to the student as win- ning the national prize money or gaining the 1~ecognition of having an editorial printed in The Concordiensis~ So:rne time ago the faculty got recited that somewhere else. 0 League of Nation,s, what sins together and decided to found a Brethren, we are here to receive ate committed in thy name!

Despite the poor record, the frosh have played some good bas- ketball and none of the losses were by more than a couple of points. The first year men seem to have trouble getting started and wait until it is too late for a spirited rally. After trailing by a large margin at the half time in both of the last two contests, with Mont Pleasant and with Nott Terrace, the cubs have come back strong to c.ut down the lead to a min- imum, but not quite enough for a victory. If the frosh start tomor- row evenings' contest with the same type of basketball that they ended the Nott Terrace game with, they ought to have little trouble disposing of their rivals; lbut if not, the chances for a victory will be slim indeed.

Theatre Class Plans Fourth Proauction Will Present \ThE Crie1· By Night\ and \'l1lte l'nb At Ballyauchlis\ The Union College c~m·se in play productio.n under tile direction of Edward L. Carroll v.oill offer the fourth production of th.e scholastic year on Friday, February 28, when they present Gordon Bottomley's \The Crier By Night\ and Richard Rowley's \The Puh at Bailyauch- lis.\ The latter play will be pre- sented for tile first time in this country. \The Crier By Ni~hl\ will be the most extremely expe!'imental pro- duction yet done by the course, as the class is endeavo·ring to follow out the artistic dictates of Gordon Craig as much as possible. The most distinctive feature of the production will be the use of rudimentary dance forms in the ac- tion of the play. Each of the four characters in the piece has his own. 1·hythm, which he carvied out in. action and in line: A.t lea;;t one solo dance will be g-iven in the course of the play. Masks will also be used, and the settings will be mostly indicated by light. The second .play, however, will be given an ess·en tially re'llistic production. Directed 'l>y a member of the cast, it will be up-to-date in treatment, but will have none of the wierd and exoti<: direction ac- corded the other play In explanation of the two plays, Director Carroll said: ..

Painters are already operating in the lower regions of Silliman, The latest Union graduate to join the ranks of authors is Lawrence F. Shaffer '24, whose book \The Psychology of Adjustment\ has re- cently been published by the Houghton Mifflin Company. Mr. Shaffer was born August 12, 1903, at Johnst01vn, New York, and prepared for colLege at the Johns- town High School. He entered Union in 1920 in the course lead- ing to a degree of Bachelor of Physics. While in college he was manager of lacrosse, photographic editor of the Garnet, and a mem- ber of the Press Club, College Christian Association, Key and Blade Club, Adelphic Society, and Physical Society. Ph. D. at Columbia After graduation from Union, he was given the Master of Arts de- gree in 1927 and Doctor of Phil- osophy degree in 1930 for his work in Columbia University. He taught mathematics at the I{ingsley School, Essex ·F'alls, New Jersey, from 1924 to 1926, and was re- search associate at Columbia from 1926 to 1928. Dttring the summers of 1927 and 1928 he was an instruc- tor at the New York State Teach-· ers College in A.lbany. Since 1928, he has been assi:;tant professor of psychology at the Carnegie Insti- tute of Technobgy. In the preface to his book, Mr.· Shaffer h•ts stated tilat his aim in writing the boo!~ is to assist read- ers to understand human natui·e, rather than to qualify them as practitionei s of mental hygiene .. According to Jl.! r. Shaffer \one of the most impot tant problems of modern p<Sychology is the common individual and f:;Oeial adjustments of normal people.

Fox Notes Change In Cam;pus Religion Speaking at Lafayette Col- lege, Pnsident Explains Modern Sentiment \Perhaps the most ~triking differ- ence between our coldeges today and those of a hundred years ago is in religious atmosphere,\ declared President Dix.on Ryan Fox, in de-. livering the principal address be-. fore the annual dinner of the fac- ulty and their families at Lafayette College, Sunday night. \The old college,\ he said, \in large part, existed f<>r religion. The Christian life and the good life were generally identified, and the mild asceticism which the evange>lical churches preached was generally accepted as the ideal.

Eroblems Include Experiments on· Crab, Rat, Beetle, Frogs and Flowers Exhibits Will Be ShGwn Be· fore Large Group Of Scientists Following are more detailed ac- counts of the projects which the biological staff and its graduate students will demonstrate in the biology labo1ato1'ies tonight: Dr. Leonard B. Clark, who has for some time conducted a pro- gram of research directed toward an understanding of the visual processes occurring in the arthro- pod eye, will demonstrate his re- cent wo1'k on. the porblems of vis- ual acuity, dark adaptation and light intensity discr·imination in the fiddler crab. Dr. Clark will demonstxate his methods of inves- tigation and wlll present some of his recent results. Dr. Clark has also been conduct- ing a research project on the re- actions of amoeba to light which wil'l have not only physiological Im- portance but contains philosophi- cal implicatious in regard to spec- ulations about the evolution of the r'eceptor-effector complex in higher animals. Dr. Clark will demonstrate the apparatus being developed for this study under a grant from the Society of Sigma XL When an amoeba, one of the most primitive animals, is exposed to an increase of light it reacts. No further re- action will occur for a certain time, called the \recovery period.\ The recovery period may be di- vided into two parts, that during which the animal can continue to be exposed to the stimulating light and recovery will proceed nor- mally, and that during which the animal must be in reduced inten- sity or darkness if recovery is to occur. Dr. C1az•k's preliminary ob- servations seem to indicate that the first part of the recovery pe- riod is concerned with the mech- anism of reaction, while the later pat of this period is concerned with the reception of the light stimulu.

Giving Radio Address, Dr. Fox Explains Meaningfulness Of Old Handicraft ''Nothing can so give bacltgr<>und and continuity of meaning to farm life as the preservation and collec- tion of worthy specimens of h<>use- hold gear of the handicraft era,\ de- clared Dr. Dix<>n Ryan Fox in a radio address on \Antiques spon- sored by Sta.tion WGY: a.nd given on the Farm Blireau program last Friday evening. \The tremendous development of machine manufacture has changed farm life more strikingly than any other factor. Giant factories and fast transportation now produce and deliver goods so cheaply that neither the farmer, nor anyone else, can afford to make them. Entering a modern farmhouse, one can scarcely distinguish it from the home of the city mechanic or store- keeper. \Perhaps the change has made for comfort, but something of the richness of life on the old farm has disappeared. There was creative art in the farmer carving a burl bowl, or cutting out a pair of leather boots or bottoming a chair according t<> his own design, though the farmer would have been as- tounded to hear himself called an artist,\ stated Dr. Fox. Dr. Fox advised the farmer's de- scendant, or his successor', \to re- cover, in .his imagination, some of the spirit and atmosphere O'f the old American life of individualism and self-sufficiency by saving or acquir- ing some examples of old handi- craftsmen's work.\ \The conection of antiques has US1lally been thought of as a diver- sion of the leisure class, If one is talking of polychrome altar-pieces, of course, it is.

Emmet Delivers First Of Two Lectures on Turbines William LeRoy Emmet, noted engineer and author, and Honorary Fellow in Engineering, delivered the first of t'vo lectures this morn- ing in the lecture room of the Elec- trical Engineering Building. His subject was The Mercury Turbine. Mr. Emmet's second talk will be given Thursday and will deal with recent developments in steam tur- bines. Besides these lectures, sev- eral round table talks at Dr. Fox's home are planned, probably upon subjects not along engineering lines. Well known as the developer of the steam turbine and inventor of the mercury vapor process of crea- ting power, Mr. Emmet has been consulting engineer for the General Electric Company for many years. He has had wide experience in the U. S. Navy, and is now chairman of the Naval Consulting Board on Submarines. Ho was appointed last year by President Dixon Ryan Fox with the other six men .prominent in public affa.jrs to act as honorary fellow in engineering for three years. His first visit to the campus was made late in the month of February when he also visited with and spoke to students from various divisions. In the field of endocrineology, Dr. Leonard will demonstrate the experiments he is conducting un- der a grant from the Rockefeller Foundation on probleills of th.e physiology of reproduction. Work on Unusual Beetle Dr. Allan C. Scott will demon- strate his research work dealing with the various stages in the life history of one of the most unusual beetles in the entire insect groups. In the· field of physiology Dr. James W. Ma.vor, head of tbe De- partment of Biology, will describe his experiments on the effects of high frequency currents on the body temperature and respiration of the rat, and Peter S. Szyjkow- ski, a graduate student in the de· partment working with Dr. Mavor will explain his experiments on the contracting of isolated frog's muscle. In the field of genetics, Dr. Earnest E. Dale, a botanical gene- ticist, is now working on problems with two other mem.bers of the staff, in addition to a study of the multiple allelomorphs in salpiglosis under a grant from Sigma. Xi. In conjunction with Dr. Leonard B. Clark, Dr. Dale is engaged in a study of budding chloroplasts and spiroga.e, and with Dr:'\ Olive Rees- Leonard is completing a study of the variegation affecting both leaves and flowers iiL Salpiglossis. ---o--- Da.y to Address Engineers Mr. Harry I.

The lec- ture will be illustrated with film of Mr. Day's. The firing of large high-powered guns at Aberdeen, :Maryland and the dropping of bombs are two of the films that readily show the theme of Mr. Day's lecture.

At a recent conference held in Colum- bus, Ohio, two organizations whose purposes overlapped, the Student League for Lndu·s- trial Demoeracy and the Nations Student League merged to form the American Student Union. The American Student Union got off to an auspicious start by adopting a sweeping pro- uram of social and educational reform. Four 0 rnajor planks in their platform include: a vigorous campaign against war and compul- sory R. 0. T. C., defense of freedom of speech for students and teachers, passage of com- prehensiv.e relief legislation for students dis- tinct from the \inadequate\ NY A program, and opposition to racial discrimination in any form in schools and colleges. Of course it is easy to poke fun at such grandiose attempts to reform the world by organized argument. But there is much more than just a platform behind the A. S. U. Behind the organization there ar~ people, thousands of students on hundreds of cam- puses who are sufficiently convinced of the inadequacy of our social system to want to do something about it. There ar.e now two large and influential organizations in the American student youth movement: the A. S. U. and the National Student Federation. Their aims are substan- tially the same, but they differ on points of doctrine. The A. S. U. is definitely the more \radi<:al\ of the two. We doubt if the feder- ation would subscribe to the new organiza- tion's \resistance to financial domination of schools by Trustees drawn from corporation and banking interests.\ It is expected that the Student Council will .•, THE CONCORDIENSIS, TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 11, 1936 at the same time, a g1·oup of students inter- Let the Grecian Scream soon become affiliated with the National Stu.- I:·. dent Federation.

Outwardly yes. But if religion means a belief in a personal set of ethical principles and an attempt to live in .accord- ance ·with them, college students are ju·st as religious as any other class of people. The fact that one goes to college indicates an at- tempt to live purposefully, to justify one's existence in the wotld, and to coordinate per- sonal and social ends. The drive behind re- ligion is still with us, but for college stu- dents, as for the rest of society, it is dif- fused in many directions. We are living in a period of religious expel'imentation and are seeking· salvation in many different ways. OUTSIDE OF CLASSES The Union Chapter of Sigma Xi will spon- sor tonight a series of demonstrations illus- trating different research projects now be- ing carried on in the biological labomtory. These demonstrations should give the non· technical undergraduate an opportunity to appreciate how much valuable work is being carried on outside of 1·egular class rooms. Too often we think of the faculty as no more than mentors who push us through a program of outlined study, examine us, and pass oe fail us. We think of them as spend- ing the greater part of their ft·e.e time in un- ruffled leisure or in thinking up new ways to trip unsuspecting students. In picturing them thus, we overlook a large part of the service they perform. For every hour spent in a classroom there are several spent in careful study or in labora- tories of scientific research. Many men on our faculty have aecom- plished work of nationwide recognition in specialized fields. Yet in most cases the stu- dent body is entirely unaware of this work. These demonstrations may educate the un: dergraduate body to appreciate this work to some extent. Students may, with the aid of graphical illustrations, be able to visu.alize the extent to which specialized study is being carried on. True to form: The Pause-that- Personality, by Ernest M.

Of course, far be it from me to attempt seri- ously to fathom Mr. O'Neill's in- tentions. But that's what I think after reading the play twice and seeing a stage performance of it. There is no thesis in the story, merely a reconstruction of certain phases of pre-war, American, mid- dle-class life.* O'Neill had a mo- ment of regression.

After successfully squelching the diminutive rep-re- sentatives of Stevens TeClh, the Dutchmen are due for an about- face in tomorrow's game with the speedy-, tricky-passing Ne.vr York- ers. Near the close o! 1935 the Gar- net was given a joyous bon voyage to the metropolis when the C<llum- bia game was to be played. There will be Jess fan !are and trumpet- blo-wing for Union's second try at another of the more esteemed col- lege quintets.

This con- test will be the second of the week !or the Union men, after meeting Syracuse yesterday, and will un- doubtedly be the toughest game of the schedule, which has proven to be one of the stiffest ever under- taken by a Union hockey team. Although the horne sextet is of practically unknown calibre, past performances warrant its being re- garded as one <Jf the most power- ful hockey tea!Xll3 among the small colleges. The Clintonians' record shows a defeat at the hands Of Army, 6 to 2, an exact duplicate of the Army-Union score. This places them io. the sanJe boat with Union regarding compar·ative scores, but scores are of no IJra.ctical value as a means of corn.pa.rlson, and Hamil· ton will be the favorites for the game. Union's accomplishments at Cornell and Syracuse lift its rating in spite of the several losses thus far sustained, and the game prom· ises to be a spirited tussle. This game will be the next to last for the year. the Colgate fr~y at home on February 15th wio.d· ing up the season, which so far has seen nothing but defeats and a tie on Union's side of the ledger.

Childisb.Bess Is A Danger to Progress Faseism am Example of Adult Regression, Says Vincent l11 Chapel Sunday \The re.tro.gressi()n to <!hildishness appears as a; danger in times of progressive and critical sociaL move- ments,\ said the Rev. George C. Vincent, minister of the Union Con- gregational Ch·urch of Upper Mont- clair, N. J,, in his Sunday sermon at the Union College Chapel. Selecting his theme from the text; \When I became a man I put away childish things,\ the Rev. Vin- cent stated. that St. Pau-l made pretty high ~laims when he wrote that. \The tendency to childishness lasts on in a good many cases into what is supposed to be adult life.\ \This fact n1ay be illustrated from some of our ·fascbt societies where people have had to face difficult modem situations and have lapsed back to the level of wanting the support of the crowd and the mob for familiar- ideas and ways of liv-1 ing.\ A pointed example from rollege I life w-a.s given by the preacher I when he spoke of childishne><~ on the football field where a deserving I halfback ~efuses to cooperate with his mates because he has not been given his illst due of recognition. 1 1 Likewise the business man or the politician a.nd. public servant give 1 1 evidences of regression into child- ishness by refusing to cooperate and take their losses with their gains, phllo.sophically.

Talking of the second influence, the devotion of growing private wealth to academic purposes and the new conception of state re~pon­ sibility with respect to higher learn- ing, Dr. FD:x pointed out that \this tended to transfer the ultimate con- trol of colleges to secular hands. \Third Dr. Fox went on, \the immense ex:tension of secular knDwledge, especially in all branches of science, withdrew from religiDn much of the attention it had previoUB!y enjoyed. \Fourth tile cultivation of social studies sugge·sted new outlets for idealistic action outside the church. \Fifth the infusion of student personnel of Roman Catholic and of Jewish faiths broke the old Protes- tant monopoly of organized relig- ious action. . . . \Today continued Dr. Fox, \on many campuses the college plctme is reversed. The professor or the student wh:o is notably pious is an exception, somewhat embarrassed by a. prevalent suspicion of en- feebled intellect. A survey of un- dergraduates would discover four types who call themselves Pro- testants. \There a..:re the practically indif- ferent, the xnajority, who ag1ee that religious institutions are desirable props to go-od order and deplore ar- raignment of them as 'unamerican,' but whose \O'llch with religion is confined t<>- orderly attention at the Sunday service when they need chapel credits .... \Then come the coterie of intel- lectual cynics who may or may not be the .best students in their classes. \Finally in the most vociferous group, thot1gh. usually small in num- ber, the revolutionists. ---0,--- Dean's List Shows Rise In Jun.iors and Seniors <Continued from Page 1) George C.

Dr. Scott will al,;o demonstrate as a separate but related feature a pe- culiar cell division process which throws considerable .Jight on the mechanism of cell division. It is hoped that this study will aid in the study of cancer in man. Dr. James E. Mavol', in his ex- hibit of experiments with body temperature and the therapeutic u:;e ot high frequency cutTen ts will show records of the gradual change in the body temperature of the rat when submitted to high ftequency currents. These show that body temperature reaches a critical point at which the rat's tempera- ture control is lost and recovery point. respiration also show a critical is possible. Records of the rate of Peter S. Szyjkowski, a graduate student, is investigating the effect of various conditions and sub- stances on the single twitch con- traction of isolated frog's rnuscle. This is being done with a special apparatus designed to permit the transfusion of the isolated muscle and at the same time allow the recording of the characterist.ics of the single twitch. This experiment is expected to throw light on the general muscle action and nervous stimulation in animals and rna.n. Dr. Earnest E. Dale will exhibit three research projects in which he is engaged, two of these jointly. Under a grant from Sigma :Xi, Dr. Dale is studying the multiple al- lelomorophs In salplglossis, a near relative of the petunia. Dr. Dale has isolated four true-breeding modified flower types in salpig- lossis. These four modifications he has discovered are all due to change in a. single hereditar-y fac- person has,\ declares .Miss Osborne,! \is his body and the top of his• skull.

He will illustrate tlte hereditary behavior of the .types when crossed with normal flower-s and with each other. In conjunction with Dr. Leon· ard B.

Br: Dale has discovered that the· ·n urn·. bet of chloroplasts per cell in the majority of our species of th:e pond scum, Spirogyra., is constant for each species is no longer valid. :;ince his collections of Spi rogyr-a from New York, Nebraska and Cal· tfornia show variation in the n um· ber of chloroplasts in the cells of :oingle filaments.

AROUND THE WORLD to visit the campus to meet with students and help correlate college studies with the realties of the world of affairs, it was every- where considered to be a splendid idea. But there were not a few who believed that the plan would not last after its publi- city value as a novelty had worn away. The first year of the project is over. The ballyhoo which used to attend the coming of an honorary fellow has settled down to more sober proportions. Yet the honorary fellows continue to visit the campus. During a week's time, beginning last Tuesday, Union will have received three of these gentlemen: William LeRoy Emmet, engineer; Georg-e H. DaLey, journalist; and Walter W. Price, businessman. With a mini- mum of fanfare, the honorary fellows carry on their work of stimulation and guidance. They are accepted as an integral part of the college life. THE \Y\ FORUM DISCUSSIONS The announcement of the series of fol'Um discussions sponsored by the college Chris- tian Association is no less welcome because it has been delayed. Difficulty in finding suit- able dates makes the series begin about a month later than they did last year. But the association has spared no effort to make the discussions as vital and interesting as before. These forums are real opportunities for students who are mentally alert, who are concerned with the problems of religion and N UNA..N BILL AGAIN By RICHARD SNYDER A Monarchist Party has been formed in Boston.

Having dropped three contests by two or three-point mar- gins, the yearlings will attempt to bring theil' wins to two, R. P. I. fresh being the only other con- quest. Coach Hatfield will start the same lineup which has inaugura~ed the last two games and wh1ch seems to be the best comlbination of the 12 men on the squad. Center position will again be handled by lanky Bob Controy, .while his for- . wards will be Frankie Myers, pres- ent high scorer of the team, and Dave Miller. Spanky Halpern and Jake Amazon will be used in guard capacities. Albany Academy, reputedly a weaker team than those already met, nevertheless is very likely to .spring a surprise, since the frosh have shown the peculiar habit ~?f weakening startegic points ll1 the game. The Academy team ~as .decidedly beaten by Albany Hlgh, which in turn was defeated by Mont Pleasant, three-point con- querer of Union. Thus it seems that the frosh will be the favor- ites, if their jii:IX can be overcome. WreBtling Schedules -a 0 0 Duplicated 0 0 General Repair Work 1 5 1 5 ElOl Union St., Cor.

How t<r provide the endles.s variety of instraction which individuals must have if they are t<> 'become what they- are capable of becoming,' without at the same time abandon- ing all oar traditional standards of the 'educated man or woman' is one of the major problems confronting educational statesmanship at the present time.\ Our failure to face this problem squarely, much less to solve it, he continued, \has opened an unfor- tunate g-ulf between two large groups of educators. On the one hand are those educational conserv- atives wh<l remain true to the Euro- pean model of an 'intellectual aris- tocracy' firmly founded upon the ancient tradition of the humanities. They would deny that any other system o-f education, especially a vocational one, can produce a truly educated man; and they would ad- mit that only the comparatively few possess e,ither the required ability or resources to profit by such edu- cation. This is the attitude of many of the older colleges and private preparatory schools. On the other b.and, we find the majority of state university a.nd public school author- ities, wh() are busily engaged in fit- ting educational opportllnities to the masses who pour yearly into tax-suppo-rted institutions, or per- ·haps in fitting the students to the time-honored curricula. Their great problem is: how .shall each student be alforded an equal, but not an tdentical, opportunity for self-devel- opment?'' Tragic results will ensue, I>r. Lar- rabee declared, if the gulf continues to widen, and two distinct types of education., one a luxury for the few, and the <>ther a necessity for the many, co-me to characterize Amer- Ica as well as parts of Europe. How shall the gUlf be bridged with- out destr<>ying the values peculiar to each position? As a suggestion, Dr. Larrabee called upon the devo- tees of t:he old-fashioned \Iibera;!\ education. to re-define their concep- tion of an educated man in terms of modern life. In conclusion, Dr. Larrabee said: \It would. be a colossal mistake if we in .Alnerica, in our lauda;ble ef- fort to avoid the caste system and cultural snobbishness in education, should come to the shallow conclu- sion that because standards differ, there are no standards at an. Grades. c::redits, and promotions Up()n a single yardstick are nonsen- sical, it is true. But that means that we need more yardsticks, more ideas abo'Ut what corutitutes excel- lence of various sorts, and not less.\ ---0·--- Skiers Compete in Races <Continued from Page 1) the Ob-stacle Race, and second in the Speed Race, losing the latter blue ribbon position to Walt Wil- liams '31>, Neutral, by only two- tenths of a second.

The Pyramid Club has been an a.ctive organization for many years and is now the only social organ- ization in existence at the college, other than the fr·aternities. Its pur- poses are to represent the neutrals In campus politics, especially at times when an organized expres- sion of opinion Is needed; to pro- vide !!Oclal activities and contacts of a type which would otherwise be Festricted among the non-fra- ternity men; and to provide a meet- ing place for Union Alumni who re- turn to visit the campui!!! years after graduation. The membership of the club has recently been increased by the in- itiation of the following men: Theo- dore Wilmot, William Parsons, George Krayem, Howard Moncton, Frank Moore, Marlin Depp, Reuben Merchant, and Elmer Johnson. A further increase in membership is anticipated in the near future. evils to be prevented were not tire censorship of the press merely, l»ut any action of the government by means of which it might prevent such free and general discussion of public matters as seems absolutely essential to prepare the people for an intelligent exer'cise of their rights as citizens.' \Such inquiry is the main job of some teachers and enters into the W!H'It of all.

Enzer R. Furguson Tuesday, February 18, 1936 PREMATURE CA.l\1PAIGN 1936 is the first leap year \Vithin our mem- ory when the politicians have utilized the extra day in February for the campaign. It is a strange phenomenon to see the big guns of the presidential battle open fire fully four months before the natio11al party conventions which in former years h.ave marked the be- ginning of hostilities. It is a strange :phenomenon and also a foreboding one. The question of the reelec- tion of P1·esident Roosevelt is admittedly one of more th.an OI'dinary interest. The present administration has made warmer friends and more bitter enemies than a.IJ.Y government since the turn of the century. It is natural therefore 1 that th.e contest over his reelection should be better than usual, but is it wise for the party leaders to start the mud-sling- ing so ea1·Iy in the year? For three weeks now the front pages of the daily papers have been filled with col- umns of political palave1·, speeches and an- swers, claims and counterclaims. The ques- tion now b-efore party leaders is: can the in- terest of the voters be kept warm for ten months until the elections? In past election years, it has been a prob- lem to keep the voting public interested throughout the summer and fall. Now the ballyhoo will have to last through the spring and most of the winter as well. There is a point of diminishing returns in political ballyhoo. People get fed up. They turn of the radio when some orator begins pointing with pride or viewing with alarm. They ig- nore the columns of the newspaper devoted to political fur and f-eathers, and turn in dis- gust to the comic section. Politics is a necessary evil of democracy. Free speech involves a lc>t of wasted speech, and nine-tenths of any c.ampaign is spent in obscuring rather than clarifying th.e points at issue. It is bad strategy to increase the natural hazards by starting- prematurely. We believe that the revulsion will come early in when election time comes around. ·11==\=====================--:..!

The sad thing about the lecture -was that Dr. Adler did not need to employ sLLeh spur- ious reasoning. As a scientist he has per- formed certain experiments and reached cer- tain highly probable conclusions in the psy- chology of social adjustment. These results stand on their own feet. They do not need the broken crutches of old-fashioned logic to support them. Sci.ence has a logic of its own, a dynamic logic of hypotheses which are ever being retested and revised. The attempt to deduce eternal, unchanging principles from the inductive findings of science is a pitiful waste of time. WHO KILLED JIMMY SHERWOOD? Dorothy Sherwood took her baby boy, Jimmy, out of his carriage and held. him un- der water for thirty minutes. When he was dead, she took off his wet clothes and dressed him in dry ones she had brought along. She sat on a log for some time, holding the lit- tle corpse in her arms. Then she went to the police station. \Here he is,\ she said, \I killed him. I couldn't take care of him any long-e1· and I thought he'd be better off dead.\ The jury convicted her and now Dorothy Sherwood is to die in the electric chair. Until she was nine years old, Dorothy Sherwood cared for her invalid mother. 'iVhen her mother died, the home dissolved and she was sent off to earn her board by scrubbing floors and caring for children. Then fifteen months in an orphanag-e, scrub- bing more floors and caring for mor.e chil- dren. At sixteen she ran away, working as a wrapper in department stores, cashier in cafeterias, devoting her spare time to vol- untai'Y work for the Salvation Arm:y. Finally she got herself a steady job as a chorus girl in a burlesque show on the road. She met Frank Sherwood, married him and bore him two children. Frank never had six consecutive months of employment. Finally, he could not get a job at all. Dotty, the eldest child, was sent away, and the family went on relief. Frank contracted tuberculosis and died. Dorothy floundered from job to job and in the end she drowned Jimmy because she could see before him nothing but the rnisery her own life had been. Jimmy is dead Qecause society did not want him. There are millians of Jimmies today living the life of wretchedness and squalor this dis- consolate mother sought to .spare h€r child. The execution of Dorothy Sherwood will be a monstrous cr:ime-the crime of a society that impelled her down the trail to insa-nity and murder. -Columbia \Spectator.\ * • \' the maestro is reflected by the May we point out the obvious ?

Although the Garnet skiers only placed eleventh in the combined events at Middlebury, due to lack of jumpers a.nd cross country men, they took fifth place in ~ field of 12 in the down hill races·.

Van Ladd was also high scorer among the Union skiers at Mlddleblll'Y• The down hill races at Middle- l>ury were held on a. new trail cut down the steep slopes of a hill near the campus and covered with un- usually fast snow making each turn especially difficult. The slalom races were held on. a course marked out on a. wooded .slope where a fall meant the loss of much valuable time. At the end of the slalom was a series of close flashes which were almost impossible to maneuver at such high speed. Union Out of Jumps Union was unable to enter the eight mile cross country race or the jumps. Lack of scores in these events seriously damaged their standing in the combined races and final team score. inth. Although snow conditions had been soft all day, the race was held. so late in the afternoon that the top snow had hardened ~d speede~ up the skiing. The leadmg competi- tors entered in this race were the Schenectady Winter Sports Club, the Saratoga Winter Sports Club, and two Dartmouth men. Although the Schenectady skiel·s took the sla· 1om races with flying colors, the Garnet men had no trouble with the down hill course. Since detailed results of the Mid- dlebury Carnival had not been fig- ured out when the Union men left, they will not know the exact scor- ings of each member of the team until official score sheets have been rpailed out by the Carnival judges.

Four Uplifting Qualities In Life Are Three States Rev. McKee Physical, Psychological, and Religious Lifts Aid Man In Living Religion Greatest Religion Enables Han to Fol .. low an Heroic Course, To Lead Powerful Life Although it is \characteristically modern to be looking for lift,\ ex- plained the Rev. Elmore M. Mc- Kee of the Trinity Church of Buf- falo in h1s sermon Sunday, \It 1s through th.e physiological, psychol- ogical, and religious qualities that we can fmd the lift in llfe.\ \Man utilizes available fot<ces to take hold of eXIsting resistances in physical life. And the very lift- ing powers resident in the outer world intrigue him to find out if they possess a counterpart in the inner.\ Three Kinds of Lifts Rev. McKee suggested that \there are three aspects to the lift that there is m life, and that each of us may use any one of them or ~loll of them to get a greater degree than we do.\ \Fil'st there IS the lift WhiCh IS physiological. lt derives from the condition of the blood stream, the body cells and the nervous system -It is obvious that the whGle tone of the body is affected by the ade- quacy of the blood stream's con- tent, and that only where 1t is suf- ficient can the gt•eat cGlonies of cells lmown as tissues and organs remaJin in a condition of vigor. Dif- ficulties and adaption also stimu- late and often cause \lift'. \Second there is the lift which is psychological. The quality of our stream of thoughts is even more Jmportant than the chemistry of the blood. For until we po.sse;;s a mind t.llat IS balanced and peace- ful, through a proper integration of pw·poses, we shall have no pow- el' of harmoniously releasmg the energ1es which our physwlogical processes have been building. \A mind at war within itself will nGt give an effective outlet to the bodily energies. Rather will these energies dash themselves, as it were agaiDJ3t a stone wall in frus- tration ... But all of us can do bet- ter than we do. Modem psychology, though still an infant sCience, is teaching us that nght thoughts al'e as important as nght food. SGme thoughts build up, others tear down. Greatest IJft \The greatest lift of all is the lift of religion. When Jesus said 'If I be lifted up I will draw all men unto me,' he meant just what he s3iid. The cross, to be sure, was a symbol of his sacrificial death, but it was also a symbol that his life of supreme quality was being lifted godward and that God was taking it unto himself. The lift which Jesus found was that of knowing that what he did was the noblest thing he could do and it represented the will of God. \There is no force comparable to that of religion which enables man to follow an heroic course un- der the dominance of the sense of devine compulsion. Men's lives are only partially powerful if they never knGw the lift of high reli- gion.\ ----0•--- Dates Emy, Skiing Fine; Middlebury C\tZrni'l!al OK In addition to the competition of- fered by the Middlebury Camival, the Ski Team of the Outing Club enjoyed a varied social program which began with the coronation of a Carmval King and Queen and ended w1th a sk1 dance Saturday night. In between were fraternity dances, a carnival ball, hockey games, women's ski races, and var- ious informal outings. The ski dance taxed each coupe! according to apparel, each extra accessory CC>sting extra. 'Ties, fol' instance, were fined five cents, High heels ten, suit coat twenty- five. According to statistics the dance was most expensive for .Angle-seventy five cents, while the gate keeper let Bob North in free. The other Union Skiers aver- aged ten cents. Since six women's colleges were entered in informal competitions it was not diffiCult to find dates for the various dances. But the competitions themselves were a dis- appomt.ment, according to the Un- ion. group, unless one enjoys see- ing girls cl1mb through bm rels with akls on.

Miss Swa1thout was m bad vmce the other night. Her warm, drama- tic, lower 1egister shaped tones of loveliness.

In a statement to a 1 cpozter he said: Dr. Fox's Statement \1 believe in patriotism, but nul in compulsory patriotism. If a stu- dent wants to take the oath, there is no gain in having him take it; if the1 e should be a student or two who cannot honestly subscribe, there is no gain in making him do \o dishonestly. \The trouble is with the tendency which may be started by the appar- ently innocent device of a constitu- tional oath. It is in my judgment the first step toward Hitlerism. If one will read the history of oaths, one wil perceive that they have not induced a loyal state of mind, but rather have stimulated discontent and subversive movements.\ To Circulate Petitions In appointing the committee, Krull made it clear that they would merely be the forxnal representa- tives of the student body, and that anyone else interested in the hear- ing would be more than welcome to accompany them. The group plans to begin the cir- culation of petitions asking the leg- itilature to drop the bill ptoposed there by Joseph D. Nunan, Queens County Democrat, early next week. Krull also announced that the daily assembly program a week from Saturday would probably be devoted to a talk against the bill by a member o.f the committee or of the faculty. The committee is composed of prominent men in student affairs, headed by Trumbull, editor of The Concordiensis and a member of the Terrace Council and of Delta Phi.

Thatcher, assistant professor of ph¥sics, are applied in making rad1o tubes. Working for over five years on the problem of thermionics, which deals with the fluctuation of elec- tronic streams in vacuum tubes, Dr. Thatcher today reported his latest discovery before the New York meeting of the American Physicial Society at Columbia Uni· versity. One of the consequences of his present researches on how to o!J· tain an even flow of electrons tn vacuum tubes and thus eliminate \electron Rtatic,\ which Dr . Thatcher reports, is the discovery that if the electrons in the outer space of a tube are divided into groups by suitable grids, a cooper- ative interaction between groups can be obtained. This cooperation results in a more even flow of elec- trons, and thus reduces static.

For some inexplicible 1·eason these opportun- ities which assumed the cloak of \honors cou1~ses\ suddenly were \vithdrawn from the cur:riculum. Their absence is reg'l'ettable to many students in divisions one and two. Today we have an administration which prides itself upon its aligHment with the · progressive forces in education. Upon occa- • sion it has set precedent for new innovations. Dr. Fox's announcement of Union's new con- trol policy for athletics unequivocally evi- dences the administration's views. The pub- licity accorded undertakings of research in the scientific and engineering field indicates the desire of the colleg-e to excel in those paths.

In the editorial \Union and the Youth Movements\ appearing in the February 11 issue of The Con- cordiensis, you wrote \Union Col- lege should keep in t.ouch with the w01lt of student organizations of all shades of red .... The college needs more 'agitators'.\ This is one of the most provoca- tive pieces of writing which has graced your columns this year. By the sheer simplicity and frankness with which it asserts a fundamental truth, namely that we must keep in touch with all organizatio= of stu- dents, it carries the force of a soli- tary pyramid arising in the center of a desolate wasteland. We, as part of the group consti- tuting society, are involved in a game which would emasculate all our rights as students and. as mem- bers of that society. A small group, desirous of monopolizing all the goods of life, are about to press the enactment of legislation that will stifie every cry we utter. They would suppress free speech. They wou:ld forbid free press. And if they could, they would inject machines into our minds which would shape our reasoning. What are we to do? Are we as students, supposedly thinking per- sons, to allow a mere minority, backed by monetary and other means of artificial power, to dom- inate our social, political, economic, and intellectual life? Or are we to organize and defeat those forces which would defeat us? These nation-wide :movement~:! such as the ASU and the NSFA are organizations of students formed to prevent infringement upon our per- sonal liberties. One is more radical than the other. \Redder\ if you pre· fer to think so. But hecause it is redder, it is quite possible that iU! emotions will ·be aroused to a greater intensity and it will, in. its effort to bring justice to students, form a concerted pressure group which will be capable of fighting the enactment of a!},· retrogressive legislation. The \middl~courses\ are invariably known for their meek mental protests. They protest within. themselves. But any active effort to exert real pressure is negli- gible. They at•e the timid \parlor pinks!\ This is a day in which pressure determines the trend of legislation. And the fellow who can. get up• the most steam, always gets his way. By joining one of these youth move- ments we can develop enough stu- dent pressure to preserve us from the fangs of the Nunans, the Ives, and the Hearsts. \The college needs more agita- tors!\ Yes. We need more people to jump on the band wagcm. We need more people to agitate for stu- dent freedom. .And we need more people to show that students are not the pathetic lot the majority of critics would have us believe they are. The editorial is an encouraging sign. At least someone is thinking of other things besides football games and intrafraternity night. Maybe others will begin to awaken and re·alize that unless something is done by \keeping in touch with stu- dent organizations,\ even if it means joining the \reds/' it will be no time before ·we students will be regimented as· are the students in Germany and Italy.

Unfortunately, atter the first few meetings the group dis- banded, and the \active participa- tion\ in social problems became more or less a hazy dream in the imaginative minds of the students. There has been a great demand among the students in this co'llege to do something against certain discriminatory bits of legislation like the teacher's <Jath law and the Nunan bill.

What can be done to secure a body of students that will remain together in discussion and partici- pation when such a z'eal thing as a Nunan Bill no longer sticlts its neck out in the wind? 'l'he moder- ate social studies seminars and clubs on the campus are ro.ainly for discussion. Where are thos·e that will actually attempt to accom- plish something? Where is the group that will try, if only for the joy of trying, to better some of the \abhorrent\ conditions which im- mediately concern everybody? I think some men on this campus have the answer.

MILLER Determined to capture the re- maining .games on its schedule, the varsity basketball team embarks upon a dangerous week-end tonight, when it faces Swarthmore in the Alumni Gym. Tomorrow night the main attraction will be the Haver- ford five, which wm be the second ..>pponent in as· many days for the Dutchmen, recent conqueror of Hamilton's fighting squad. Swarthmore, tonight's visitor, should be the more difficult of the two opp<>nents, for she will pi esent practically th.e same offense as that used by the home team. In addition the Pellllsylvanians have a hustling, fighting- ball club, as was evidenced m a recent game against Lehigh, which the latter managed to win by one point after holding a sizeable lead at the half. Bolstered by three veterans, the Swarthmore delega- tion has won about six games and lost t\ o. Captain Jim Buckingham is the most dangerous man, noted for his ability at long shots and his clever fake. His companion at for- ward is Sam Kalkstein, while Hall- owell, converted from gua:rd, will play the pivot position. The two. guards are Wray and Murphy, as- sisted by Tapley upon occasion. Ken Brown Back in Lineup The Union team will be the same that played so well in the C.C.N.Y. game, and which, with the excep- tion of Ken Brown, played the ma- jority of the game against Hamil- ton last Saturday. Van Waldron will again be at center, assisted by his two capable forwards, Podbiel- :ski and Milano. Ken Brown, pro- viding he has recovered from his recent cold, is a sure starter at one guard, with Guy Griswold holding down the other back court position. Ken has improved considerably since the advent of the season, and it has been his spark and speed which has helped drive the team in the last few games. In case he is still too weak to play, Waldron will be shifted to guard, and Grant Smith will resume his duties at cen- ter. Haverford, on Saturday night, will be in the same condition as Union, for it plays Hamilton to- night, and continues its Toad trip to Schenectady immediately after the game. Therefore, some idea regard- ing its strength may be known as soon as tonight's result is learned. Defeated by three opponents of Union, Trinity, R. P. I. and Swarth- GENERAL OFFICE EQUIPMENT CO.

Four Editor Denounces Fascistic Trends L. I. D. Speaker Calls Politics, Radio, Press, \Gravediggers Of Democl'acy\ Restrictions on free expression and free assemblage are signs that the nation is drifting toward fas- cism, William Mangold, labor editor of the New Republic, warned mem- bers of the League for Industrial Democracy in the Old Chapel Wed- nesday night. Speaking on \Gravediggers of De- mocracy-Radio, Yellow Press, Pol- itics,\ Mr. Mangold pointed to an increased use of violence and terror against labor, censorship of free activity in the field of art among Wl.~A workers, and the teachers' oath bills as symba!ic of fascist ten- dencies. Economic Fascism \\Ve have the economic aspects of fascism· we do not have the poli- tical aspects,\ Mr. Mangold contin- ued. Early attempts at a fascist movement were not taken seriously, he said, but modern figures like Coughlin and Talmadge come close to being fascists, yet have a dema- gogic appeal which assures them a considerable following. The speaker then attacked Father Coughlin's proposal to prohibit strikes and lockouts, on the ground that it de- nies the rights of labor. \Threats to do away with the 1 ight to strike ate harmful as far as l~bor is con- cerned. We've seen what has hap- pened in Germany and Italy.\ Press Ca.lled Unfair The press, he went on, has shown di~crimination against certain or- ganizations. \The Civil Liberty Union issues press release>:l two, th1 ee and four times a week, but you ~ever see them; when _the ~iJ;l­ erty League releases anythmg, It 1s carried in all the papers.\ With radio there is a fairer chance of reaching a larger audience, he said, but hel'e, too, there Is discrimin- ation. \\Ve rlnd workers are denied their constitutional rights-they can't btrike, they can't organize. In this country we do not have a large enough labor group to function_ ef- fectively. I may seem to be a little bit pessimistic--it may be that these things can be ironed out so that we will not have a showdown of force- -but the issue is becoming sharper and sharper and the time is coming when we will have to take a determined stand to pre- serve t:Jhe democracy we still have. Fa.sclsm in Case of War \There i~ little time to be lost. The world i~ rapidly drifting to- ward war. Possibly the one step we have missed in the United States toward fa;scism may be taken in the event that we do have war. At p1 e.;ent there is no reason why tht! monopoli.:;tic industrialists should support a downright fa~cist movement when they can still use the democracy, but if there is the necessity for tightening up the machine1·y of administration, they will not he»itate to go a step far- ther than they have at the present time and take complete control. Ions Can't Jump 'Fence'; So Thatcher Ends Static <Continued from Page 1) months, and man made static may to a certain extent be controlled. \A third form of disturbance has Its origin in the radio receiver it- self. Much of it comes from the tubes as the electrons rain against the cold metal plate from the hot cathode emitter. Still more is con- tributed by the connecting wires where a ceru;eless dance is in prog- ress-the random chaotic dance of thermal agitation. These sources of \electron static\ constitute a definite limit to the useful gain whic may be obtained from vac- uum tube amplifiers.\ Dr. Thatcher finds that \when electrons are crowded into the ::;pace between the elements of the tube there occurs a remarkable quieting effect. The flow through space becomes more orderly and the pelting rain on the plate may be reduced to mere 'drizzle'.\ This phenomenon, known as \space charge,\ has recently been shown by Dr. Thatcher to reduce the vio- lence of even the thermal agitation in circuits containing vacuum tubes. Dr. Thatcher concluded: \One of the consequences of the present work has been the discovery that if the electrons in the outer spaces of the tube are divided into groups by suitable grids, a cooperative in- teraction between groups may be obtained. An arrangement has been studied, for example, where the flow from the outer group to the plate maintains itself constant, re- gardless of small changes which may occur in the number of elec- trons being emitted, and another where the plate current actually decreases with increased emission. These properties seem of consider- able interest since, among other things, they may furnish a new and powerful weapon in the fight against \electron static.\ CALENDAR Tonight FRATERNITY INITIATIONS 8:00 - Basketball, Union vs. Swarthmore at the Alumni Gy·mnasium.

The two bays carry semi-circular benches with upholstered cushions and backs and a round table con- venient to them.

Ferguson 'l'uesday, February 25, 1936 UNION'S BIRTH CERTIFICATE One hundred and forty-one years ago to- day, the good citizens of Schenectady re- ceived a charter from the Board of Regents to establish a non-sectarian college in this town. The original copy of the charter reposes in the safe in l\h·. Hoadley's office. Although wrinkled and yellowed with age, it is still legible. It is vvritten in the fine slanting hand in which all legal documents were copied be- fore the days of typewriters. Whereases and wherefores in large Old English letters stud the manuscript. In spite of the redundency of the phrasing, this birth certificate of Union College carries a message which is \Vorth repeating. It is as challenging now as it was in 1795: \We have granted and declared and by these Presents do grant and declare that a College for the Instruction and Education of Youth in the lean1ed Languages and liberal Arts and Sciences shall be and hereby is Founded and Established in the said Town; ... That the Trustees .of said ·College shall have perpetual Succession and be capable to sue and be sued and to ..• hold lands ••. to appoint a President and Professors and Tu- tors to have the immediate care o fthe Edu- cation and Government of the Students who shall be sent to and arlmittNi in the said College for Instruction and Education accord- ing to such Ordinances, Rules and Orders as shall be made by the said Trustees ... pro- vided that no such Ordinance, Rule, or Order shall be repugnant to the Laws of this State or the Laws of the United States, neither shall any of them extend to exclude any Per- son of any religious Denomination whatever from equal Liberity and advantage of Educa;- tion, or from any of the Degrees, Liberties, Privileges, &enefits, or I!mmunities of the said College on account of his particular Tenets in Religion.\ The grammar may he questionable, but there can be no doubt about the meaning. Union was fouhded as a liberal and tolerant college. May it continue to pioneer in these directions !

R. C. BROADCASTS Union College is not unknown to the radio audience. The Sunday chapel services, occa- sional Glee Club broadcasts, and r·adio de- bates have paved the way fo1· a new type of p1·ogram which has great possibilities as an educational project. A series of four round table discussions on what American youth are thinldng about intemationalrelations are scheduled for suc- cessive Thursday nights beginning this week. The p-roject was originated and is being car- ried out by members of the newly formed International Relations Club. Although. Pres- ident Fox and several members of the fac- ulty have been invited to participate in the informal radio discussions, the students are responsible for the preparation and conduct o.f the programs. Th.e opinions will be the students' own. And the faculty will be pres- ent as advisors and confidants rather than as d1·i11 masters. Thus the discussions should exemplify the ideal teacher-student relation- ship which Union is trying to achieve. The topics chosen are pertinent and chal- lenging-: can the United States sta-y out of war; ~hould we join the League ()f Nations; iR armed force necessary for \Yorld peace; ant! what should be the American attitude toward undemocratic countries? The partici- pants in the discussions are leaders in the International Relations Club and aU of them experienced public speakers. The .set-up is perfect. All indications point to a very in- tel'esting and successful s:eries of programs. The only thing which we ~n see that might mar the project is that the students mig-ht take their responsibility too seriously and make the discussions too :pedantic and debate-like. An informal, life-like argument demands mor.e histrionic ability than does a debate. But if they can capture the atmos- phere of a bull session and make the discus- sion a clash of personalities as well as ideas, the ,great radio audience will not flip the dial to the nearest jazz oond.

Denison threw Weiler after considerable tugging and pulling, and White after abso1'bing the famed scissors from Bob Walter, rolled over and pinned the millinier to the canvas. Mac Murry, broke all records when he flopped Lifsett in exactly thirty-one seconds. Mc- High MoralP Considering the lack of com- petent material and the loss ot Keens from several out-of-town meets, the team did as well as could be expected. Despite adver- sity, the morale was remarkably high. At the close they showed the same spirit that had characterized earlier competition. Bill Leonard, the coach, did a good job with the material at hand, and developed several men who should :be useful next season. Trinity came first on January 11. Keens and Myers finished one-two in the dive, but Union finished sec- ond in the meet, 53-18. On the 18th, in William's Lascell Gym the team -sans Captain Keens-absorbed a 53-22 defeat. Larry Clinton took our only first place in the 50 yard dash. At Colgate on the following Saturday they reached their abso- lute nadir, Colgate pushing them under and holding them down to a count of 61-10. Only Clinton's twu second places saved the Garnet from the ignominy of a shutout. Relay Sets ~cord The invasion of Syracuse on February 1 was awaited with high hopes.

At the re~ent meeting of the U. S. lntercolleglate Lacrosse Association many changes in the rules of. the Indian game were made, among them the x·ule abolishing sticks with umeasonably large pockets. In the future, lacrosse players ary 1 ines will promptly forfeit the baH to the opposing team at the point where the player went out. A b:l-11 crossing any side line shall be considered as a free throw for the player on the opposing team flr:-st touching it. But a ball cross- ing the end-line shall go as a free throw to the first player on the op- posing team who crosses the 1\ne in J>Ursuit, at or near the pomt wher-e the ball went out. Where Union always sent to the penalty box will ha.ve to serve the entire penalty pe~10d in that place. They will be reqUl.red to enter the field at the center lme. Not only are the players affec.ted by the new rules but the officzals too must mark time, When two officials preside, the referee must officiate on one side of the field, while the judge of play has charge of the other half. Numerous changes in out of bounds rules require that the marke1·s be placed on inside lin.es and parallel to the goal posts, 'Yhtle the 90 yards betV!een markers IS to be known as the 'side lines.'

The victory was highly edifying not only because it did much to :>alvage a rather unsuccessful .sea- son but because it put another splotch of Garnet ink on the al- ,·eady .badly blotted debit side of R. P. I.'s ledger. Emerging from a fierce melee in front of the Engineer's het, Fritz Hawley hit the puck into the goal before two minutes had passed and stattcd the Gatnet off on one of their best games of the year. Late in tne fil·st period Hawley's 3hooting mate, Orton, skated down che rink, filtered through the Tr·o- Jan defense and accurately flung ,he pusk from the side of the rink. !'he rubber slid past the Cheny and White goalie and put the Troy- .nen on the defensive for the re- .nainder of the period. Bergman Scores The Tute seemed doomed to go Jown to a scoreless defeat when .e!twing Hugo Bergman evened nonors fo·r the first string line by ,l>ssing horne a sliot similar to Or- .on·::;. The husky wing took the ..,ucK down the ice, broke through the defense, and outmaneuvered soalie William::; to score Union's third point. With Captain Phil Little passing d. brief respite in the cooler for committing a foul, Dick Whittaker, substitute wingman, made the Tro- jan's only tally. Coming out of a scramble in front of the Union net Whittaker whanged the rubber past Goalie Tom Wa1 d. Two minutes later \Doc\ Orton again found the Engineer's cage.

Hurd, Professor of Chemistry, recently published an article entitled \Influence of' Tem- perature and Acid Upon the Time of Set.\ The artic·le was the sixth of a set'ies of studies on sicilic acid gels and appeared in the January issue ·o-f the JoUI'Ilal of Physical Chemistry. a Student Petition On Nunan Bill Circulated Copies of the petition to the New York State Legislatme asking the abandonement of the Nunan student loyalty oath bill have been delivered to each of the fraternity houses with this issue of The Concordien- sis. Students are urged to sign this petition, copies of which will also be placed in the 'library, and the Bookstore, as well as in Silliman Hall. The petition reads as follows: We, the undersigned students of Union College, protest against the enactment of the Nunan Student Loyalty Oath Bill because: 1-lt is a useless, stupid at- tempt to foster .American loy- alty by un-American means. 2---lt is an affl•ont to the let- ter and spirit of the Constitu- tions it is to support. 3-It is conbary to the tra- ditions and culture of the American. people and of the people of the State of New York. Cummins Discusses Supreme Court Rulings (Continued from Page 1) the Catholic Conference on In- dustrial Problems, on the topic \Is Constitutional Amendment Neces- sary.'' He stated further that the Court had the power to choase between the two divergent traditions-that of making national power equal to national needs, and that of con- tinuing the political no-man's land. With the fm•mer, the twilight zone could be eliminated without con- stitutional amendment, by the lat- ter, it would be both desirable and necessary to issue to the Court a mandate which would wipe out this zone.

HN·ves, on the other hand, thought that t1ade and peace are possible to a degree, but that disarmament is tlunget ous. At 12:30, luncheon will be se1ved, following which busses will convey the visitors to the General Electric Company. At the plant they will be the guests at a special scien- tific exhibition in the \House of Magic,\ beginning at 1:30 p. m Following this at 2:45 the studios of radio station WGY will be open for inspection. At 4 p, m. the guests will be able to observe the Mountebanks in a dress rehearsal of Sophocles' play \Oedipus Rex,\ or be spectatots at or participants in athletics and swimming at the Alumni gymnasium. Following dinner at 6:30, the bas- ketball game between Union and R. P. I. will offer entertainment for them at 8 p. m. in the gymnas- ium.

Records show that few stu- dents in the past used for playing, they would have used for playing, in studying. Gene1ally, they u;;eJ this time for attentling some E'nter- tainment, or in loafing. The problem 1 ests on whether people will be able to contl ol their natural reactions in time of war, ~aid Snytlcr. \If young people evetywhei e will use their knowl- edge and enthusiasm in trying to change these eonditions of life which lead to useless confusion ·md suffering,\ the nt'cessity for paying big ptic·es for peace will no longer rxiHt. The club was accompanied by the Garn-et Goblins, the college dance band. The prog1 am of the concerts will include a wide range of vocal music, solos by Fret! M. Alexander, baritone, and Charles L.

I have from time to time heard disgruntled stu- dents find fault with the column- ists on the Concordiensis. But never have I seen so many stu- dents, at one time, be .dissatisfied with one writer. I have yet to meet one with whom G's column is popular. If G. has any supporters, I beg them to write and explain why they enjoy his humor. Humor is, inde~d. a rathm· hard word to define. But consistently, wee!' in and week out, his humor is, to say thE' least, putrid. ThE'Y say it is easy to criticize, but difficult to accomplish any- thing. You must have other writ- ets on your staff. Why not gi've ~'ome of them a chance? If you sincerely believe that G. is your second best writer and cannot be replaced, the solution is still an easy one. Don't put a column in on Tuesday's, when G. is scheduled.

Van Wert needed all his knowledge and ability to subdue Prest in the long- est and best match of the evening. After playing around for 7:18 min- utes, he finally managed to slap Prest to the mat. Robinson took Estrich by the fall route, and Jack Smith ended things for Rick Angle by making him another \fall boy\ in 1:29. lrarr threw Stoughton in 3:14, making the latter's average JUSt .500 for the night, since he won his boxing tift shortly before.

On the box- ing program, the first and last en- counters alone were enough to make the customers satisfied. Nott .1nd Spellman opened activities by sparing no blows and exchanging lefts and I'ights with careless aban- don. Nott was given the decision after three rounds of slugging in which both gladiators lost plenty uf blood and ended up weak and tottering. Denton gained a techni· cal over Annese, Stewart contin- ued with a decision over Scott, and Lewis demonstrated a clever fake and real punching ability in sending Borden to his corner after two rounds. Then Reynolds and Saiwitz took the ring and brought down the house with their exhibi- tion. Reynolds floored his oppon- ent in each of the first two rounds, and finally ended the bout by open- ing Saiwitz's eye after he had talt- en a stiff round of blows himself. Of the eleven matches of wrest- ling, three or four stood out for their humorous aspects as well as tteir grappling accomplishments. The bout in particular was the af- fair between Jacl' Kearns and Payee Hatch, in which Kearns ef- fected a fall aftet' being manhan- dled by Hatch for three minutes.
