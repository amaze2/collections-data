Gill, manager· of RKO Proctor's theatre formal appreciation is due for their splendid efforts to advertise the Union lacrosse game with Ox- ford-Cambridge. Gilmour ·took the .motion pictures, despite the fa.ct that he was terl'ihly busy at the G. E. and Mr. Gill's company paid the bill besides ,showing the 1·eel in the theab·e. The film has now been donated to the .college by Mr~ Gill. All . alumni will be able to view the game in their respective towns, if tl1ey wish. Anyway, it is an interest-ing recoTd for the college to have. Ttue Facts Bared. So far, no absolutely correct version has .appeared of the relay team's ,~ccomplishm.ent a·t the Pe:nn Relays. Both the Concordiensis and the local newspapers have missed up in their accounts. Here are the trl.l·e facts. The Union Relay team broke all I~ecords for the mile in the Middle Atlantic States Collegiate .Athletic Association. This does not mean only in a particular class, hut in any class. Rutgers established the previous record, not N. ¥. U., in 1922 with a time of 3:24:2-5. It is true the N. Y. U. tried to break this record when Phil Edwards & Co. were wearing Violet jerseys. Union's tiJne was 3:21 :4-5. The xelay team is not \one of the best teams in Union's his- tory'' hut the best. No other Garnet team l1as approached the present quaxtet's time by .fifteen seconds. The 1·ace was run this way. Capttiin Bowie handed a two foot lead to Nigriny wl1o increased it to two yards. McCague held this margin until the 220 maJ.·:k where Hartman, crack Lafayette sprinter, passed him. But :McCague let out his famous \:kic'k\ on the home stretch and gave Ha1·:ds a two ylllrd lead. Harris ran away from the othe1·s ,and finished with five ya1·ds to spare. Now you can tell the sto1·y ,of ,Union's only Penn Relay victory to your kid. brothers and any others who Hwill sport your altered pants\ (just came from the Splendid Musical Club concert) and ,you won't have ,t0 worry about his finding out you d.on't know anything.

Some are as old as the college itself; others ba.'¥e been handed down at different periods m tlhe institutioil's history. But tbere 1s one tradition which is young. [i IS only tlJ.ree years old. Jt IS the tradition of tlhe Blocl U dinner; It 1s one of the best traditions this colltege has ever had and deserves the whole-heuted support of every person who eonsiders himself a Union man. It was founded to honor the athletes of Union, to giVIe the stu- dent body a .chance to show its esteem, grati- tude and appreciation for those men who up- hold the honor of their alma mater upon the of history. It might be a toucl1 of the syrnlJ01ic .to have both a Grecian and a Roman striving · together for the possessiOn of the pinn~de, representing the strife of culture and war :for the mastery of man.

How.ever, Union men should not feel too h.adly about the defeat. To wm thirteen consecutive dual meets stretching over a period of sn:. yp-ars IS a glorious achievement. It was to b€ expected that the record could not stand permaaently; it had to be marred by a defeat some time, an(l that particular time happened to b<! UH~ fourt.eenth meet, with Lafayette col-· lege,. hst Saturday. Furtl1ennore, the defeat at the hands of the East~n team was by no means a disgrace. The Garnet squad gave a noble aocount of itself throu,gl1out the entire meet; the victory was not d~tennined until the last two events. And the lll()et was one of the most tluilling and close- ly C{)ntested ever held on the Alexander hack. TlH: times were unusually fast m the runnmg events and in many cases were record-breaking. AU in all, the meet was one of the most inter- esting wl1ich has ever taken place m Schenec- tady, as all who witnessed it will testify.

Playing thei-r second and thi'rd 59~ Score RECORD BROKEN IN MEET Savage Sei:s.A New Colle-ge Record In High JU1llp Taking first and third places in the final event on the card, which was the half-mile run, the Lafay- ette track team defeated Union last Saturday afternoon on Alex:ander field by a score of 66% to 59'%. This defeat is the first that the Garnet has suffered during a period of si:x years Of fourteen consecutive dual track meets under the direction of Coach B'ruc e, The high point scorer of the day was Hartman of Lafayette who garnered a total .of thirteen points for the Maroon and White track and field rnen. He took first places in the century and 220 dashes, turn- ing in a time of 0:9;9 in the former and 0:21.6 for the longer o.f the two sprints. He also placed second to Lehman in the broad jump. Leh- man and Stark tied for second scoring honors with ten points each. Savage Sets New Record The college high jump record, formerly held by M. Cohn with a jump of 5 ft. 10 in., was broken b:v lloth Withrow of. Lafayette and Savage of Union. The former man, once holder of the eastern inter- scholastic high jump record at Peddie Prep, cleared the bar at the height of 5 ft. 11% in. Savage missed this by one inch, jumping 5 ft. 10% in. Cohn took third place in this evEnt. Van Wert, the Garnet's outstand- ing pole vaulter, took that event easily with a height of· 11 feet . .Al- though he tried a heig\ht of 12 feet he was unsuccessful in attempting to break the former record set up by E. Sadosky, '29, who cleared 11 ft .. 8% in. Lafayette Wins the Hlll'dl-es Two of the most spectacular events we~e the high and low hurd- les. In the former Sturmer of La- fayette ran abreast of Cohn, the Garnet hurdler, only to beat him by a fast sprint after clearing the last hurdle. Colton, a Lafayette man, came in a close third. Misfortu:ne frowned upon Union in the 220 low hurdles when Swart, who was jn the lead, tripped and fell when trying to get over the fourth hurdle, causing him to lose his place. Knight, who w011 this race the previous Saturday in the meet against Manhattan, pushed Rosenfeld hard for the first place but lost to the Easton runnet· by a scant margin. Aussick~r Takes the Mile Run In the mile run the field I?,\Ot off to a fast start with Aussicker in the lead, the rest following close behind, At the beginning of the fourth laJJ Christensen sprinted past the Ga1·net man and obtained a lead of about ten yards which he maintained for about half a lap. At this point the pace began to tell on him and he quickly dropped to third place. Aussicker, who was again in tll.e lead, gradually pulled away from the Lafayette men and broke the tape about thirty yards ahead of Che rest of the field. Union entered the last event, which was: the half-mile run, hold- tug the short en.d of the score, then H0%-56¥2. Nigriny, who ran number one for Union got second place from the vost at the start. At the gun two Lafayette men took first and second pla_pes with Nigriny fol- lowing clo.se on their heels. Roth- mann followed Nigrin,y about two places back At the end of the first lap Rothma.nn had nulled llp be- bind Nigriny for fourth place. Half- way around the second time Roth- mann began to sprint, passing Ni- griny and closing up the distance between himself and Christensen, the second of the two Lafayette runners. Upon reaching t h e straightaway Rothmann had pass- ed Christensen and was not more than two feet behind Lewis wlio had also increased his stride. The Lafayette man broke the tape fer first place not more than a foot (Continued on Page Six) ---O--- S PRING HORSESHOES The spring interfraternity horse- shoe pitching contest will continue as soon as the reSUltS ·Of the first round are obtained.

Despite the fact tliat Satur- day Lafayette broke the winning streak that the Garnet track and field team has held for six: years for dual meets, Coach Bruce is con- fident that he will start another list of collsecutive victories tomorrow. Under Coach Bruce Union won the last two meets before relations were bmken off against R. P. I. This is the last dual meet of the seaso:n for Uuion. -After the Gar- net's quartet of quarter-rnilers had broken the eight-year-old record of the Middle Atlantics mile relay at the Penn Relays, Union defeated Manha:£1;tan here 79 t<> 47 and last week lc;>st to. t;~f~yette 66 1-2 to 59 1-2, thus -breall.\ing the siK year rec- ord of unbroken dual meet vic- tor.ies started by Ceach Harold An- son Bruce when he came here in 1924. However the mistakes made in the· last meet were pointed out in pr~ctice and the squad has been working 'hard with the object of scoring 100 points against R. P. I. ()apt. Bowie to R.un 440 .

Rainy Weather :Prevents Opening Of State 'rennis Tour:nament Here Yesterday Outstanding tennis pl~yers repre- senting nine colleges and universi- ties began play this morning and. will continue to play tomorrow in the second annual Ne:w York State intercollegiate tennis clla~pionship tournament held here if weather permits. The rain of yesterday hin- dered the matches from beginning on time. As this meet is held under the rules and has the complete sanction of the United States Lawn Tennis Association, both the state intercollegiate singles and doubles . champions will be cro'Wned. The best players from their in- dividual colleges will represent the following teams: Union, Albany Law School, Canisius, Colgate, Cornell\ N. Y. U., St. Stephens, St. Johns, and Syracuse. N Y. U. is without {{oubt the stro~gest contender with Captain Harte favored to take the single championship, succeeding Tara.ngi- oli his team-mate of last year. Harte last year was runner-up in the tournament. SwaybiU another N. Y. U. player will also be on hand and will be in the limelight as he is a great tennis ace an.d l?resses his captain hard for mdtvidual honors. Challenge Cup Offered A large challenge cu,p ~as l?een offered this year for the flrst hme. The winning team 'Will hold the cup for one year and it will e:vent~­ ally become the property- t;>f th~t team first winning 100 pomts m successive years. The points are scored on the following basis: the winner of either singles or doubles will be awarded 10 points, tlie run- ner-up five points, the team re~ch­ . ing the fourth round three .pomts, round eight, two points, and round sixteen, one point. Chuck ·savage, \'32 has 'been jumpillg bet~er than ·the college record in the 'high jump and Myron Cohn. '32, is p1,1shing :him on in the same event. Charley- ~ansen, '30, has been placing in the shot put, discus, and javelin·in a.ll· the meets and. will undoubtedly- do the same agai11st the Engineers, while Larry Swart, '32, is considered a sure bet in the·Iow hurdles. Ho-wever Swart may :not pe able to corniJete because of a twi~ted ankle suffered last week ino the. Lafayette meet. Vic Nigriny, '30, is slated t<>• run the half rni-le ·with Hank Hothmann, '30.

The team is travel- ing both ways by bus. Hack Livingston, substitute Gar- net center, who came out of the Yale game with a strained tendon in his knee, will not be able to make thtl trill with the team. Jim Personius will probably play the third defense 'POsition in spite of the strained ankle he received in practice some time ago which left him somewhat shaky. The remaind- er of the team is in fine shape to meet the Hobart twelve. Norris Outstanding When interviewed yesterday af- ternoon Coach Harkness seemed to think that the Union stickmen should have little difficulty in win- ning the game tomorrow. The Ho- bart team has not won any games this season, but nevertheles_s should give the Garnet a hard fight. So far Hobart has played teams out of their class and have been waiting for the Union game witli much an- ticipation. Among the teams that Hobart has played are Cornell and Colgate. Cornell beat them by 5 to 1 and they tied with Colgate. During the last week time has been spent in brushing up on the passing and other minor points and in trying to discover material for next year. The attack has improved steadily with each practice period. The individual player that has shown the most gain is Norris at center. The twenty-one men that made the trip are: Forbes, Draper, Per- sonius, Armstrong, Fisher, Hagar, Finegan, Stranahan, Dutcher, Dietz, Foster, Webster, Withington, Langworthy, Norris, Aldrich, Kreckman, A.

Mr. Irish has been gathering pic- tures typical of the Union College campus and the student activities, and he will submit them to the Publishing Board at Dartmouth College, where a group will be sel~ ected for publication representing Union Coll~ge's pictorial share in the magazine. Mr. Knoderer will handle the sale and distriblltion of the magazine, the first issue of w~hich will appear on the first of November, 1930. This new tmblicationis being ed- ited by a- group of undergraduates at I>artmouth College and is being published as the official 01ogan of the Intercollegiate Pictorial Asso- ciation, whose purpose is to foster photographic organizations and publications in the member col- .}~;Jges, and through its own medium to. bring these celleges, into closer . contact with one another. The In\ tercollegiate Pictorial magazine will contain pictorial material from seventy of the leading colleges and universities of the United States and Canada, and will also contain features of .definite interest to col- l~ge men and women. --~~-0·--~--- JURIS PRUDENTIS 1 d t .

Wl1ile we arc on \the subject of awards for teams, there's an- other 11ertinent subject that we should settle. Ht is the matter of major letters. The Block U is an insignia awarded to mem- bers of major teams in reward. for their services to the college. Tl1e Athletics Board's practice of giving a standard swca:t:cr to all tl1ese men is somethi11g we don't a])prove of. Each sport should have a distinctive letter award. Several years ago dif- ferent colored sweaters were awarded for the various sports. 1Ve believe that tha:ti \\\as an irnprovcn1ent over the present! system.

Tha·tl is, have a U wit11 .an FT on the sides of the letter to indicate that the wearer l1as won his letter in foot\hall. In this m anne1·, the students and outsiders who S·ee the swca ter will know ~hat sport the man has W()n it in. Then there \V\ill be more l10nor and distinction in wearing a s1veatei'. In addition the managers of the team should have some sign on their sweaters +.!o show· that they are ma.na- g<:>J·s and.not players.

Vahm and the cake uOnly fine ovens produce cakes of fine tex- ture.\ This rule applies as surely to the most complicated ''cake-baking\ process in modem industry • . . making steel castings for high pressures ... as it does to the simplest domestic cookery. In basic-lined Herault electric fur- naces that apply the heat directly and cleanly to the metal and permit exact control of tern- . peratures at every stage, the steel for Crane cast steel valves and fittings is prepared. Every casting is annealed under temperatures held at I600° F. for hours, then slowly shaded ·off to cooling. Interesting as is the Vulcan-like foundry equipment in Crane foundries, com- plete as are the manufacturing resources that give exactness and uniformity in production, the vital secret back of quality in Crane electric steel materials is not the \oven\ but the skill of the \cooks\ ... the chemists, the superintend- ents, the workmen who watch and control each step and process. Through 7 5 years, this skill has been developed and refined. Back of it is an exhaustive scientific library of labora- tory studies and test charts. Much of the data that has enabled Crane Co. to produce depend- able valves for the enormous pressures and temperatures now used in industry is collected in a book,\ Pioneering in Science.\ It is a valu- able reference book for students Let us send you a copy.

These seven, all promin- ent juniors, will form the nucleus of next year's Council, and four will be elected by the Student body in September to complete the body. The Terrace Council was organ- ized by the class of 1906 to govern .. the Student Body. Its membership ·, ai that time consisted of seven : seniot's,. four of whom were tapped ·each year by the outgoing Council . and three elected by the Student body. Two years ago, however, it ·was .felt that the increasing size of the college required a larger Council in order to secure full rep- resentation of all activities, and the Student body changed the member- ship to its present number. Mem- bership on the Terrace Council is considered the highest honor that the Student body can give an un- dergraduate.

It is also a monument to the Bdl System policy of constantly improving estah1ished methods and developing new ones. For years underground telephone cables have been laid in hollow duct ltn.es especially constructed for the purpose. By this newly developed supplementary metl!od they can be buried directly in the ground. without cog- duit-and, under many conditions, at a sav- ing of time and money. • To do this it was necessary to develop a new type of cable, many kinds. of special equipment including labor-saving installation machinery, and to work out an entirely new installation proced':lre. Progress means change. TIIe BeH System holds no procedure so sacred that it is not open to improvement. BELL SYSTEM t./1 nation-1t:1idt: system of inter-connuting telephones ,, l· ..
