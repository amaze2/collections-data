Cleveland was ·visited ... on Thursday night, and Dean Ellery returned to Schenec- tady today. . The address which Dr. Ellery de- . livered .to the various groups con- sisted of a brief resume of what the educational institutions of the country have learned from the methods of the football coach. He stated that \for many years, oddly- enough, the best teaching at any . American college has been done on ·the football} field,\ and .attributes · this to the fact that \here a small body of undergraduates is under the direct supervision of specialists. several hours every day. The un- dergraduate learns to do things by doing them, under personal c.ontact with a man who has already done them. Football Methods Superb Teaching \There is no arithmetical work- ing system and no grading. Fail- ures are not recorded. A man wins the coveted position or does not win. Those are the only two classes of competition. Further than that, the student's errors, his greenness, at the beginning of his training are not held against him if con- stant improvement shows him at last fit for the team.

Teacher Not Responsible \The teacher is not responsible for this condition. He has longed for the same rich opportunlty to show his skill that has been given the football coach. He knows that his reputation as a teacher w:ould be enhanced unde.r those conditions and the fame of his college would spread as an institution where hab- its of orderly, profound, and dis- interested thought were inculcated. 'The encouraging and inspiring feature of American colleges today is that they- have been educated by the very- process they have develop- ed on the football field. In recent y-ears engaging student teaching assistants to give instruction to .freshmen has fallen into disrepute. Small classes have sup1Jlanted the large groups. So-called 'honors courses' have been introduced. And most important of all, the student's worthiness to receive his 'honor' or his varsity intellectual letter is de- termined by the grip on his sub- ject which he displays in the com- prehensive examination.\ ----<0 NOTICE The owner of a ring which was found in the wrestling room of the gym may pra.cure· dt by- apply-ing to Professor J.

The campaign takes place late this year as the national world wide business depression was so urgent that a s·eparate Red Cros·s drive merited individual support rather t'h11.n taking a percentage of the association's funds. This year, the \Y\ has cut running expenses 50%, and at this mininmm figure it seems that the stu- dent body should support it. Five years ago the Christian associa:bion in- augurated the Community Chest idea to sup- plant the custom of passing the hat on Regis- tration day at the beginning of each semester. It is more ·efficient, insures more intelligent giving, .and a more equable cont:rihution per capita. By combining tl1e various campaigns into one, it .saves us the trouble of numerous canvasses. We hear considerable comment these days as to what the \Y\ does for the students, and why we should subscribe to it Sometimes it would be good for us to realize that intangible values can not be be measured. The college branch of the Y. M. C. A. performs a great many invalu- able services for the student body. $150 a year is allowed for our daily chapel exercises. The programs furnished by Paul Harris and Lau- rence McKinley Gould, and the Hampton and Utica Singers have been so favorably received a great loss to our college life. Finally the off campus expenses, which few • students know about; as Uni(}n's membership in • hhe national and state Y. M. C. A. organiza- . tions, and the sending of delegates to inter and collegiate conferences are worthy projects. Un- ion must join them and by joining them gains a certain amount <;>f pU!blicity w1hi<:h is just as good an advertisement as a championship team. If we should fail to support this drive W!;: would depriv;e ourselves of its many benefits. It is our duty to contribute if 've wish the \Y\ 's work to continue. G. R. B.

To-day's ship is not only swifter but safer and more dependable. Modern depth-sounding devices indicate instantly the height of the ship above the ground surface. A unique feat1:1re of General Electric's recently purchased monoplane is the almost completely electriAed instrument panel. The most recently .developed instrument is the sonic altimeter, which provides a quick means of indicating changes in height above ground. Sound from an intermittently operated air whistle is directed down- ward. The echo is picked up in d receiving megaphone, and the sound is heard through cl1 stethoscope. The: elapsed time between the soufld and the echo determines the height. Tests show that water, build- ings, woods, etc., produce echoes that are different and ·characteristic. Besides developing a complete system of aircrc1ft in- strumer~ts, college-.trai.ned General Electric engineers have pioneered in every electrical field-on land, 011 sea, and in the air.

Varsity Five Friedrich Schorr to Sing in Memorial Chapel on Mai•ch 14 Friedrich Schorr, premier Wag- nerian baritone of the Metropolitan Opera Gom;pany, will give a recital in the Memorial chapel on Monday night, March 14, the Graduate CouncH announced today. The proceeds of this recital, which is made possible by the generosity 9f a friend of the college, . will go to the fund to assist students, who, wi,thou:t financial aid, would not be able to continue their college course. Schorr is a Hungarian by birth. While he was still in his youth, his family moved to Vienna, where his father insisted that the lad study law. Young Schorr, however, in- sisted on studying music, especially singing. Prepared for Law After Mr. Schorr had graduated from the Gymnasium, his friends gave him a farewell party. At this party .the singer sang a few songs. An old gentleman came over to him and introduced himself as Professor Robinson, who was at that time the leading baritone of the Metropolitan Opera. Professor Robinson offered to give young Schorr singing lessons because he was so thrilled by the splendid qualities of the young man's voice. He went to Schorr's father and tried to persuade him to allow his son to become a singer, telling him that after hearing the son's voice he was convinced that Schorr would become a great singer.

Keeping ahead of the second hand To keep telephone service in step with the swift pace of Americaa life, Bell System men tackle many an absorbing:problem, fin-d many an ingenious solution. For instance, they decided that pre- cious seconds could be .saved by a clt:ange in long-established operating routine. The operator used to repeat the number called by the subscriber- now she indicates that she understands by saying, \Thank you.\ To appreciate the importance of the second thus saved, just multiply it by the 40,000,000 conversations handled by oper- ators on th~ average day. In the telephone business, major improve- ments that save the subscriber's time and give him better service often result from just . such apparently minor changes.
