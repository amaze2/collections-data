Wyatt, Director of the Placement Bureau. 33 members of the class are employed and 69 are attending graduate school. The graduate studies that are being pursued are about evenly divided between law, medicine and dentistry. Among the schools being attended are Har- vard, Cornell, Yale, West Point, Columbia, and M. I. T. Eighteen men are studying law, twenty-two are in medical and dental schools, a11d the remaining twenty-nine are following other fields. Some of the business firms that have employed Union men without the past several months are Inter- national Business Machines, Gen- eral Electric, Gulf Oil Company, and Montgomery Ward. Of the twenty-five men who have not as yet secured positions, ten pursued science courses, nine were .nembers of the division of social studies, and two were en- rolled in the field of language and literature. Seven of the science majors were Bachelors of Science in Chemistr;r, and three Bachelor of Arts ih Sdi- ence. Four electrical engineering g1aduates are also without connec- tion at the present moment. 1\ll men who studied the C'ivil eng~­ neering course have positions. Library Will Again Distribute Papers Beca• .. se of the success in the distr;outing of The Concordien- sis from the Library during the !alter part of the past semester, Jack Rabinowitz, '40, Circulation Manager, has announced that the papers will again be distri- buted from that point. Fraternity bundles and single . issues will be found at the right hand corner of the Librarians' Desk at approximately 4:30 p.m. on Tuesdays and Fridays. If fraternity bundles are not called · for by the following morning, they will be opened and uistJ·I- buted to any students who d~­ sire the papers. As quickly as each fraternity is aware of how many papers it will need, it should notify the Circulation Board of The Con- cordiensis. President Reveals Faculty Changes With seven members of the fac- ulty handing in their resignations at the end of the 1938-39 academic year, the Trustees have made eleven appointments to fill the gaps. The changes in the faculty for 1939-40, including resignations, leaves-of-absences, new appoint- ments, and promotions are as fol- lows: The Resignation of: Edward Linus Carroll, A. M., in- structor in English and director of the Mountebanks Theatre, to enter the professional theatre. Ferdinand Helm, Jr., A. M., in- structor in English, to go to Co- lumbia University to continue graduate study under a Residence Scholarship and· Grant-in-Aid of Tuition. Walter John Nelson, B.S., in- structor in physical education, to become coach of football at R. P. I. Joseph Collins Shipman, B. S. in L.S., library counselor, to become chief of the technological division of the Toledo Public Library. Ernst Albert Winzenburger, M.E., S.M., instructor in engineering, to go to Germany to continue grad- uate study. Donald Emblen, M. B. A., In- structor in Finance, to pursue graduate studies at Columbia Uni- versity. John A. McGuire, M.A., to con- tinue graduate studies. (Continued on Page 6) Scottish Student's Visit Here May Be Curtailed by War Neil Loudon, of St. Andrews, to Do Social Studies Graduate Work Uncertain as to how long he will be able to remain in this country, W. Neil B. Loudon, exchange stu- dent from St. Andrews University, Scotland, took up residence on the campus Sunday afternoon. A grad- uate student, Loudon will study economics at Union. Loudon, like Andrew Dryburgh, exchange scholar for the year 1937- 38, is a native Scot, his home being in Dunlop, a small village 16 miles south of Glasgow. His father is a minister. Being 22 years of age, Loudon is eligible for conscription in Great Britain. He arrived in the United States, after having much diffi- culty in getting a boat from South- ampton, on September 2, one day before war was declared. While en route to visit some members of his family in Cincinnati, he heard news of the war and immediately got in touch with the British con- sul In Detroit. He was advised to stay in this country until his age group is called. Loudon says that this may be in a week or a year. He has an older brother in the Royal Scots 11'usiliers. Scot Is Social Studies Student Unlike former Scottish students who have studied here, Neil Lou- don is taking four social studies courses. He majored in history and economics at St. Andrews. He has elected to study the social and intellectual history of the United States with Dr. Frederick Bron- ner, a study of the labor movement in the United States with Profes- sor William W. Bennett, a study of the development of the cor·por- ation and its significance with Pro- fessor Benjamin Whitaker, and a study of state and local govern- ment in practice with Professor Vernon O'Rourke. While at St. Andrews, the new exchange student won his varsity \blue\ for captaining the univer- sity rugby team. He is also an en- thusiastic golfer. If he is still here in the spring, he intends playing several Schenectady courses. Loudon is living in South Col- lege and, for this week, is the guest of Alpha Delta Phi frater- nity.

Fahy, editor. Those freshmen who have not yet been photographed will have their pictures taken within the next week, making it possible to send the book to the printers at an early date. The staff of the Record is busy at the present time gathering scenes of the campus and of the. freshman camp. Any freshman who took snapshots at the camp and would like to l:lave them included irl the Freshman Record are urged to submit them to the staff Fahy said. ' The general form of the book will not be radically changed from that of last year's book. The con- tents will include pictures of the officers of the college, the fresh- men advisers, the members of the class, campus and freshman camp scenes, the freshmen coaches, and the freshman cross-country and faotball teams. A page of familiar campus faces will also be included as will the directors of student activities. An innovation will be the addition of a iist of the fac- ulty. The members of the staff, who a~e are assisting Fahy, are David T1edeman, Al'thur Davis and Mor- timer Robins. '

The Conconi:~,n~i~ addre~~es a cordial greeting, and exp1·es~es the hope that ~·our; college career will IJe profitable and enjoy- <Vule. We have few bits of couns.el to add to the 111HSS of advice \Yhich ha~ already l.Jeen aimed!' at you. Om· suggestions are of the most , patent nature. · The prime comnumdment for freshmen, in our opinion, should 1 ead \lle yourself.\ Col- lege is not a fantastic colon~-. isolated from the dail~· world of realit,\·. but is rather a ~ane group of serious students and their pro- fessors. If ,\'OUI' conception of college life i:,; one characterized by screaming haberdash- ery, unintelligible jargon, and infantile feats of intempewnce, \\'P urgl' you to abandon it at once, The 'coon skin coat. the hip flask. ;mel the \fmt\ housp have long since passed into oulivion. You are now a membei' of a commm1ity of gentlemen, and it will Le to your ultimate advantage to conduct yourself accordingly. Om second bit of advice is to remind the members of the entering· class that yom pri- mary purpose for being at Cnion is of an academic nature. Obvious as this fact may seem it is nevertheless true that every yea.r many students lose sight of this consider- ation and find theil· college career cut short i.Jecause of their scholastic deficiency. In the majority of cases, poor grades are bred of nothing but sheer indolence. Any student with a I'easonaule amount of intelli- gence call make a creditable scholarship rat- ing, if he will uut apply himself to his les- sons; nor does it require more than a little se1·ious work to attain a Dean's List average. You have frequently heard the apparently hackneyed adage \Scholarship pays.\ If you have even the slightest doubts as to the ver- acity of this saying, we suggest that you seek confirmation fmm any member of the college .staff, any personnel manager, any graduate school, OI' any of the several stu- dents who \flunked out\ during the past year.

From whe1 e the next annals will be dated, we are unce1 tain, but the odds are on Paris un- less it becomes too popular with the German air force, and until then we hope that Union organizes no R. 0.

Dul:e and Duchess of W·indser. Uuch em Iier in hi·s career, he crca~cd a sensation when he was appointed organist of St. Vincent's Ghurch in Rouen at the age ·Of 12. i'he next few years he spent study- ng .the ot•gan under some of the gt•ea.t masters of Europe at that time. At the age of 30, he was ap- pointed to the position of organist at the Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris. H is 0nly through good fortune that Mr. Dup-re was on a concet t tour in A·l:lstralia instead of being s~mewherc in Europe that he is able to pt,esent the con-cert at this t'tr.e.

The installation can easily he modified to indicate total horse- power-hours and to write an autflllla tic log of the power delivered during the trip. FLOATING POW£R T HE surging waves of a stormv sea are hcautiful to an artist, disconc.erting to a food-loving passenger, but just another problem to an engineer. Whenever a sleek ocean liner plov.s her how through a heaving swell, her engines feel an added load, and her captain wonders if the fuel will last. So, G-E engineers built an nil-electric meter that will accurately measure the power put out by the propeller of any boat, from a tiny tug to a transatlantic greyhound. The meter is essentially a comhination of two electric generators mounted a little distance away from each other on the propeller shaft, and connected to instru- ments which can be located at any point on the ship. The generators are so mounted that at no load the voltages generated are exactly 1Ro degrees apa1·t in phase and there- fore add to zero. \\'hen a load is placed on the revolving shaft, the torque causes a small angular twist in the shaft; consequently, the two generated voltages no longer add to zero. The Among the G-E engineers who developed the dc\·ice are A. V. :\lershon, Pratt Insti- tute '13 and Cnion College '15, and C. I. Hall, U. of Illinois 'ro.

Postal cards were maioled Thursday to 130 colleges and universities in the United States asking that the Workshop be placed on their respective mailing lists. ly place the Workshop on their lists, and Earl Reed Silvers, pub- licity director at Rutgers, highly commended the work that is being done by the broadcast group. The programs. which will be of a fifteen minute duration, will start within a few weeks. Mahol'ley has announced. A test of this type broadcast was made last June and proved hig'hly successful.

President Dixon Ryan Fox has I anmmnced that Miss Miriam Doyle ' of Lawrence Rivers Inc., play pro-~ ducers, will be the director of the : first Meuntebanks play this fall. , Miss Doyle will be here in the ca- , pacity of guest director, filling the position left vacant by Edward · Carroll who resigned from the di-1 rec~orship of the Mountebanks last I spnng. In explaining this new regu- lation Dean Garis said, \The ad- ministration feels justified in making this additional require- ment both because of the list of d i s t i n g u i s h e d speakers brought to the chapel and be- cause of its desire to inculcate in the students a proper attitude toward guests of their college.\ N,ew Chaplain Often M,istaken For Freshman Houghton Spent Summer Camping, Herding Cattle By Svi..OI.i<JN BLECHMAN REV. H. R. HOUGHTON Union Frate,rnities Pledge 131 Men During First Week of College Number Less Than 171 of Last Year; Sigma Chi Takes Honors With 15 Pledges With the close of rushing week on Sunday eveBing, a total of 131 freshmen, sophomores and juniors had been pledged to the various fraternities on and off the campus. Although this figure is considerably less than the abnol'mal number of 171 set last year it is approximately average with figures of the last few years. The Sigma Chi fraternity led in the number of pledges with 15 men, ioilowed by Delta Upsilon and Kappa Nu with 13 each and Chi Psi with 10. Several other fraternities pledged eight or nine men. ---------'~ The pledge list is as follows: Alpha Delta Phi - Ransom R. Wadsworth Tells Miss Doyle is a well known figuee , on Brodaway and in other theatti- i cal circles, for her production of I \Pursuit of Happiness,\ a hit in New York City a few years ago. She is also vice-president and pto- duction manager for Lawrence ltiv- et-s Inc. The president of this com- pany is Rollin Stebbins, a gradu- ate of Union College in 1904. Steb- bins has made his name with such productions as. \vVhite Horse lnn\ and \Green Pastures.\ The old regulation, allowing unlimited cul:5 on Sunday, called for attendance at less than fifty per cent of the combined Sun- day and daily chapel services and not an equal attendance at both. The new regulation has been added to remedy this sit- uation. \I'm a hard person to i·nterview,\ said the Rev. Herbert Houghton, the new college chaplain, \because thus far I've done so little.\ The reporter differed because he had seen Het·b, as he wishes to be called, in action at the freshman camp.Ther·e he led the boys up Buck Mountain in the record time of 52 minutes and went swimming in Lake George three times a day. On Sunday he preached a sermon to the freshman campers, the crux of which was \true liberty implies responsibility and there can be no appr·eciation of true liberty with- out responsibility.\ The reporter mentioned the fact that Herb had not been around Mamaroneck this summer. \I was out West on a ranch till Au- gust first,\ he said, \taking care of thirty-five youngsters and two hun- dred head of cattle. After August first, I was up here on the campus. One Sunday, I preached a sermon at the Methodist Church, and the rest of the time I tried to bear the Schenectady weather. After it get too hot, I went for a canoe trip in the Adirondacks.\ Herb will prob- ably join the Outing Club. Work to Start Of Arab Revolts On Alexander Field In Jerusalem Micks. Jr., Schenectady; M.

Past Guest-Director Union Cotiege is not unfamiliar ground to Miss Doyle as she was sent here by Rowland Stebbins in the fall of 1~36 to direct the Moun- tebanks production of \Squaring the Circle.· An idea of the quality of her work while here before is expressed by a quotation from a ConcorUiensi:s review of \Squaring the ,Circle,\ which said, \The Moun- tebanks pt esentation directed by Miss Doyle evoked continuous laughtet· and vigorous applause at all three performances this wee.k- end before capacity audiences. The capable direction of the guest di- rector gave the production a sparkle and tempo not usually found in an amateur work. By her skill she kept the play moving at a rapid pace and made a success of one of the most difficult pieces the Mountebanks have attempted in years.\ Tryouts Soon Forty-Seven New Men Accepted For Glee Club Number Not as Large As the Record Group Of 171 Last Year Glee Club tryouts which have been conducted during the past few days by Dr. Tidmarsh. Director, have brought forty-seven new men into the organization. Fifteen of the number are on trial, however, according to Dr. Tidmarsh, and will not be accepted until they justify their membership by ade- quate vocal performance. On the campus, DL Houghton will assist Dr. Fox with the daily and Sunday chapel services. He will preach one sermon the first Sun- day in February. \I shall also teach a couroe on Modern Religious Issues,\ he :said. \We shall take up the religion of science, the author- ity of the Bible, the significance of Jesus, the Social Salvation of the individual and life after death. I also expect to take part in the work of the Christian Association. for I am interested in any and all possibilities of promoting religious interest on the campus both for· mally and informally. My office will always be open to any stu- dent who wishes to talk with me I'd lil{e to meet every one, but, in a college this size, I may slip up.\ Herb then described the beauties of his office in the rear of the ad- ministration building which had been decorated by Mrs. Fox. N t J Alumnus Aids Release ex une Of Kidnapped Americans Drainage System and New Turf To Be Installed At $10,000 Expense Resurfacing and in:stallation of a new drainage system on Alexander Field will be started immediately after the baseball season next spring, President Dixon Ryan Fox announced Wednesday. A movement to repair the field was inaugurated last spring aft~r four consecutive ba:;eball games were cancelled because of wet grounds. Soon after the movement was under way, the alumni made la1·ge contributions to a fund to defray the expense of such a pro- ject. By the close of the college year a large amount had been donated and during the earl>' part of the summer the college administration consulted with representatives of the Rubien Construction Co. of Westfield, N. J., who submitted an estimate for the work. Upon the advice of alumni engineers, Gavin Hadden, consulting engineer of New York, made a report on the amount of worl' nece:ssary t9 in- stall a new drainage system and to resurface the field. Speaking in the daily aBsembly on Tuesday morning, George Wads- war th, '14, Consul General of United States in Jerusalem, told of his quarter of a century in the Near l:!:ast and. how he had helped in artanging the release of two Anter- ican clergymen who had been kid- napped and held for ransom by Arabs last July. · Mr. Wadsworth explained that after the Arab revolt had been ended last July, many of the rebels had fur·m~d into bands of brigands and it was one of these groups that had taken captive the Rev. Jacob Goldner and his son. Mr. Wadsworth arranged with the British authorities not to send out troops as this act might re.;•Jlt ia the murder of the son who wa,; be- ing held for $5,000 ransom. After the British agreed. Mr. Wadsworth called in some influential Arabs and asked them to appeal to the brigands, on political and hum<J.ni- tarian grounds, to release the American. These Arabs communi- cated with the kidnappers truough intermediaries, and the boy was returned safe, only after the intet·- mediaries had received a $500 re- ward. It was later learned that this money was divided between the intermediaries and the brigands. The speaket· taught for three Beta Theta Pi-Sidney J. Hor- ton, Salamance; Donald F.

The reporter asked about his en- counters with the students. \You know,\ he said, \before I came up here, my mother warned me that I would be tal,en for a freshman. Half a dozen students and one in- structor have asked if I was a member of the class of 1943. But the joke was that I took that in- structor for a freshman, too.\ Dr. Fox said,. \The administra- tion found that it was impossible to do any summer work and still play football on Alexander Field, and reconstruction any year would involve playing football elsewhere this fall. At the time we were ready to begin the work in mid-summer, thel'e was not enough time to com- plete it before the frost came. After a conference of college officials, it was decided to award the contract to the Rubien Company.

There they will be safer, though the town is by no means free of danger. Ten miles to the north is the Firth of Tay and the strategically important b!'idge which leads across it into Dundee, one of Scotland's principal cities. To the south forty miles is the even more important Forth Bridge which crosses the Firth of Forth to Edinburgh. These were both objectives in the World War and will be so again. Not more than three miles west lies Leuchars Junction, where is situated one of the most important air bases of the north. During the last war an enemy mine floated into the Bay of St. Andrews. It was carefully towed out to what was thought a safe distance and then exploded by rifle fire. It brol'e half the win- dows in St. Andrews, The two questions most frequent- ly encountered since my return to Union have been \How are the Scottish women?\ and \What will hapuen at St. Andrews this year?\ On the first of these subjects I hardly feel quaJified to speak, but on the second I can at least hazard some guesses. During the Crisis of September, 1938, there was con- siderable doubt as to the Univer- sity's opening; and now that con- flict is an actuality, a normal aca- demic year at St. Andrews is well nigh impossible. Just as in the last war, the laboratories will probably be well staffed with chemists carrying on research in the en- trancing field of poison gas, while the residences will be filled with boys undertaking military training.

Becker Friday, September 22, 1939 ------ ·- ----------------- RUSHING Once again, with the passing of pledging for anothe1· year, the hue and cry of \dirty rushing\ is being raised from all comers of the campus. The annual allegations of \stolen\ legacies, \kidnapped\ freshmen, and first year men held incommunicado are rampant. There is little doubt that many of these 3Tievances are exaggerated, but on the other hand, it cannot be denied that the rushing tactics of several fraternities are at least (.:Jestionable. It is a well known fact that a system of delayed, selective rushing is the most desir- able one yet discovered, but it is also true that with Union's inadequate dormitory fa- cilities, such a system cannot be put into effect here . .i\Ierely because delayed rushing is impossible, however, should be no occasion fo1· the appa1·ently ruthless rusing seen on our campus. The Interfraternity Council has shown fraternity Council is to be the body which guides the policies of the fraternities as a group, why then should it not be the logical body to enact and enforce a rushing code that will remove at least the majority of complaints levelled against our present sys- tem? Such a system would, of course, entail a degTee of respo11sihility and effort which the council might find distasteful to shoul- der. If, however, the group wishes to justify its existence on the campus, and to establish itself as a true goveming body, vitally con- cerned with fraternity welfare, instead of an auxiliary dance committee, it has a duty which cannot be shirked. ATTENTION FRESHMEN! It is an inspiring sight at commencement time to observe the many hundreds of alum- ni who have traveled hundreds of miles to revisit their alma mater and to renew under- graduate acquaintances. We doubt that any normal Union man can witness the alumni parade, hear the class yel:ls, the renditions of the Alma .:\later, and the other exercises attendant upon a class 1·eunion, without mar- veling at the force which has brought these men together, or without feeing just a bit prouder of the fact tha:t he is a Union man. These alumni have not retumed to the campus because of any academic curiosity, but have been attracted by that in tangible magnet class spirit. Their inevitable anec- dotes are not of class room experiences, but are of the annual interclass paint wars, and other similar class ventures. There is no doubt that class spirit is the seasoning which spices a college career, and makes it more memorable years after diplo- mas ~we forgotten. If such is the case, there is little doubt that the efforts of the Student Council to foster this spirit are worthy of commendation, and the Council's program deserves the support of all students.

The class was roused to such an extent that it eventually sponsored an all-freshman dance, the first such function to be held on the campus in more than a decade. The dance, in the opin- ion of many observers was the most success- ful held at Union last year. Pete's Paramount Grill in Sara- toga has been remodeled. It is said that they ilave a Marine Room and, believe it or not, a Submarine Room. If you get a chance, pay a visit to my dear old friend, Pete.

Presi- dent Chari\:; Alexanuet· Rich- mend, faculty members, and the student body were swept along with lhe swelllng tide of patriotism as the college formed a batallion and drilled two hours daily. Ath- letics even came after drilling, as many a football practice was held ?i. A machine gun corp was also mau!l'urat?d and a course in map readmg grven. Finally, the faculty allowed students to substitute mili- tary training for any three hour course. By May 11, 43 members of ~he student body had left for Mad- rson Barracks. In fact, three mem- bers of the Terrace Council were \t~pped\ at trainipg camp. Pa- tr totism was the keynote of Com- mencement. cern, however, it does a remarkable job of ignoring the entire matter. On several occasions, the interfraternity council has been attacked as a superfluous organization. If, by the council, we refer to the almost purely social agency of the pres- ent, the attacks have been fully justified. If, on the other hand, we refer to the body which the council might well be: the group composed of the appointed representatives of the respective fraternities, meeting to dis- cuss matters of common interest, there can be little doubt that the attacks are unjusti- fied. Certainly there are few matters of greater common interest than that of rushing. Un- fair pledging breeds mutual distrust and ill will that will not be forgotten soon. Perhaps we are viewing the matter in too naive a light, but in our opinion the solution Freshmen, here is your opportunity to show that you can at least equal the record made by the class of 1942.

Several students and graduates were listed as National Guardsmen with their headquarters on the Rio Grande in '.i'exas. Speakers spoke on war conditions in Eu- rope, and editorials appeared in the college paper urging the stu- dents to take up military train- ing. On February 16, 1917, President Charles Richmond sent a per- sonal message to thP President of thP United States, Woodrow Wil- son, C'ffering the services of the college to the government if war was declared against Germany. On March 3, Pr·esident Richmond and 24 faculty members sent telegrams to Wilson urging the declaration of war. President Richmond fol- lowed this manifesto by touring the south and eastern tier of states, speaking on the necessity of a common front against Ger- many. The st~dent body pa-rticipated eagerly m the usual collegiate \preparedneEs\ activities. Three ~undred. joined the college batal- ilon, wh1ch was outfitted by money donated .by a member of the alum- Sixty per cent of the students returned to college in September 1 ~ 17 · ov.er half of the faculty re~ srgne?; m fact, a whole new math- eJ?atrcs department had to be hrred. So many of the officers of clubs and other organizations had gone to war • that special elections ~ere held to fill the vacancies A oncordiensis poll of October, 1917, showed that 125 of the stu- ?ents . who had left college were m actiVe service. The Liberty Bond sale hit the college around the middle of Octo- be~·: The sum of $11,660 was sub- SC!Jbed by the student body and fa?uity of the college.

In the scrimmage yesterday aft· ernoon the tackling and general defense of both the second and the first teams was ragged. Ge0rge Norris, however, e:x;ecuted some commendable t>locking as a half- back in the first team backfield. Constant replacements in bot11 teams made it impossible ·to deter· mine j1:1st who would start aga.inst Haverford College just eight days from today. Minor injuries have kept three linemen from practice dtll'ing the past few days. Adam Ciesinski, second team center, of Schenec- tady, sustained a leg injury last Saturday and he has not ,t'eported for practice since. The team physi- cian, Dr. G. Mat·cellus Clowe, said that his leg was healing rapidly and he should join the team with- in the next two days. Two Tackles on In~ured List Also on the injured list are Abe Dorseman, Albany, and Moe Wein· traub, both tackles. 'A'eintraub has a muscle injury in his leg and wHl be kept out of practice for a few more days. Dor~eman is suf· fering from water on the knee, and will not return to the team for at least ten days, or just previous to the opening contest. Max Eisner has been inserted in the line-up frequently to replace Dorseman and has been showing up very well. To make 1:1p for the temporary loss of Ciesinski, Bob Baker, of Albany, has been con- verted from a tackle to a center and has been outstanding on de- fense in backing up the line. Dick Kearns, seniot· and first team guard from Fonda, is also being drilled as a center. After 14 days of practice the team is shaping up fairly well with the main strength in the line. The loss of Larry Brockmyer, who will matriculate at Rochester Univer- sity Medical School this fall in- stead of taking his senior year at Union, will be felt greatly. So far, Captain Sam Hammerstrom, Jack Vannier, George Norris, and Dick Balch have been the starting back- field combination, with Ed Enstice substituting frequently. TENNIS REGULATIONS 1.

The entire program will be under the direction of Profes\ sor Wilford H. Ketz assisted by members of the athletic depart- ment. The com·se, primarly designed for freshmen, will include those upperclassmen who 'have not met the college swimming require- ments. The entire number of stu- dents will be divided into classes, none of which will have fewer than 20 students. At present the freshmen are tak- ing the \achievement\ tests, ac- cording to w11ich the classes will be grouped, and starting next week the regular gym classes will be held. The index for the achieve- ment test is reached by arldin::; the number of seconds it takes a .student to run the 100 yard dash t0 the seconds he requires to swim 50 yards. Fundamental instruction in touch football, speed baH, running, and volleyball will be given dur- ing the fall. Boxing, wrestling, basketball, and swimming will compose the winter schedule, and during the spring softball, track and tennis will be taught. Classes will be held Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday mornings and Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday afternoons. Head Football Coach Nelson Nitch- man, Line Coach AI Ciampa, and Freshman Coach A1t Lawrence are assisting Mr. Ketz in the program. 0 Freshman Harriers Report for Practice The largest group of Freshman Cross Country candidates ever handled by Coach Wilford Ketz re- ported for training this week. l'hirteen men reported on Tues- day and three on Wednesday.

TANNER Once again this column appears in The Concordiensis after a rest ·0f three months. New athletes have appeared on the campus~many athletes have closed the iT college careers. And as is usual before the start of each year, speculation is rampant as to \whether Union will have a good year in athletics.\ This c0lumn looks for one of the best years of recent times. Graduation last June was not as hard on the Dutchmen as that of former years and in the majority of sp0rts dur- ing tl:te fall, winter and summer seasons, many veterans remain. Even the best of prophesies are often upset, but it is expected that Union's athletic fortunes this year will be much better than those of 1938-1939. To start the year off right let's give the usual PLUG OF THE WEEK , .. this time it's for l·ittle Geargie Nonis, a junior in the Chi Psi house ... Norris wil>l probably start in one of the backfield posi- tions on the varsity eleven this fruH and he deserves every bit of praise ... a smal·l, light, man, Norris has improved greatly since last fall when he was a substitute back and he displays some of the best spunk of any man 0n the field .... He graduated from tne Little Falls High School where he played three years of football ... he's played football at Union since his entrance in 1937 . , , The intramural program for the year 1939-1940 will have two changes~one with regard to the sports and the other with regard to the direction and control of the prC'gram ... in the first, a new sport has been added ... it will be a combination of basketball, soccer and football and will be called \speedball\ . . the second change is one which should be of great benefit t0 all concerned with the program and is something which many houses have desired . , . this year there will be an Intramural Council composed of the activity heads of the fraterni- ties, dormitories and the Neutral group and will meet at least once a month to discuss intramural problems ... a meeting may be called at any time if it is deemed necessary by either Bill Ketz or Arthur Law- rence .. , the purpose of the council is to let the participating gmups decide their own policies and rule their own program inasmuch as it is run solely for their benefit ... the council will have the .power to vote on any protests of contests p1·ovided the protests are logical and well founded al<l drawings for contests will be made by the council and at Wednesday's first meeting, the pairings for the first sport, touch football, were drawn ... this column heartily endorses the new council as a way to eliminate or reduce to a minimum all disputes and give all participating groups a voice in the matter ... This will make the fourth year that a trio of runners has helped guide Union College's cross country fortunes . . Co-Captains Fran•k Melewicz and Paul Santoro and Bill Johnson have run in both cross country and track for the last three years and have been instrumental in helping build up good records in both sports ... Bill Lynn has only one worry about his split lip sustained during a football practise .... now that the lip's healed he CAN'T WHISTLE ... the other day on Alexander Field your writer was watching a lad getting off 60 and 70 yard kicks ... the lad was Fred Patrie's brother who made All-Albany last year on the Cathedral Academy eleven he plans to enter Union ... 'tis rumored that Dr. Bronner swings a wicked tennis racket ... if you want an eyeful! take a look at Dr. Sunderlin's serve ... speaking of tennis ... ask Dr. Doty what he thinks of the new tennis \comer Welby Van Horn ... entries in fall tennis this year will be limited to four men per grOUJ.l and rules will be very strict as to for- feits ... the ultimate aim of the athletic department is to finish one ten- nis tournament in the fall ... let's cooperate to this end ... heard on the football field recently ... \how can a guy carry the ball when every time he goes for the hole he needs a ladder to get over\ ... This column would like to commend Al Ciampa on his efforts as line coach . . . the absence of Larry Brockmyer will be felt strongly this fall in football ... Jack Vannier will probably take Larry's place although Diamond Marotta may be pulled out of the line to do some of the punting ... Let's make a date for that Trinity football game on Oct. 7 ... the first home game, you know, and the Dutchmen will be out to make up for that heartbreaking loss last fall . . so what say, fellows, give your best girl a break and take her to the game . . . the teams needs YOUR support ...

The box is weathei' tight and has 12 sliding windows affording a view of the entire gridiron. Accommoda- tions for eight people are pos- sible in the box which is 18 feet long, 5 feet wide and 7 feet high. The room contains a press table 16 feet long, allowing each r~porter two feet of space in which to keep his statistic sheets and play-by-play notes. The usual special telephone lines will be connected. The box is painted gray and trimmed in garnet. Intramural Football Will Start on Monday The Touch Football Tournament, under the direction of Coach Bill Ketz, will start Monday, with sev- eral teams paired off on the grid- ir·on. The pairings for the tourney will be posted on the Bulletin Boar·d in the gymnasium. The games will start at 12:45 p. m., and refe1·ees will be provided for all games. At a meeting of the Intramural representatives of each group, it was decided that each team will \ be given until 12:55 to have eleven men on the field. If one team is not complete, the other wins on a forfeit. It was also ruled that post- poned games will be automatically cancelled.

This is in line with the club's past policy of having Union students as their guests. Yesterday the club held their regular weel\ly meeting in Jack- son's Gardens. Dr. Charles N. Wal- dt·on. Secretary of the college, ad- dressed the group on \Training Dogs and Getting Them Accepted.\ He was asshsted in his talk by Heidie. Dr. Fox and Fred \Vyatt also attended the meeting. Loudon and Yuen An entirely new and distinctive Alumni Monthly will appear in No- vember, according to a statement from R. Daniel Weeks, newly ap- pointed editor of that magazine. The publication will be increased in size to 8 1 \ by 11 inches. There will be thtee columns instead of two, as there have been in previous years. War Affects Magazine The European war has indirectly affected the Alumni Monthly, Mr. Weeks stated. The price of paper has risen considerably since the outbreak of hostilities and threat- ens to go even hig.her. The Monthly has purchased a year's supply so as to protect itself from further in- creases in price. The new editor also said that the magazine had planned to use new type faces, but because the type must be cut in EU!·opE>, it might be unavailable. Another change will be in the cover, each one of which will pic- ture a diffl'rent subject but will retain cet·tain characteristics which will stamp it as the Union College Alumni Monthly. Waldron to Contribute JOHN D. l'IDLLIPS, '41 Cuba's contribution to Union Col- lege's foreign legion this year is Alberto Cardenas, a member of the class of 1943, whose home is is Ha- vana. Car<.'ienas is the fourth stu- dent in the last four years to come to Union College from one of the Pan-American countries. The last student to come up from the equa- torial region was Feliciano Gon- zales, '41, of San Juan, Puerto Rico. Alberto has been to this country before, having prepar·cd for Union at the Berea PI epara.tory School in Kentucl\y. At present he is malrlng his home in South College. Those inquisitive persons who already know Albet,to, aleo know that his chief likes are the radio and ath- letics and that he is enrolled in the electrical engineel'ing division here at college. While preparing at Berea, Al- berto engaged in practically all the sports carr·ied on the school's pro- gram. He not only participated in baseball, track and swimming, win- ning let.ter:: in all those sports, but he captained the baseball team for two years in a row. Here at Union he has air eady shown his liking for athletics by trying out for the freshman footba11 team, but he thinks H no place for a man of his diminutive stature. Vlhen aslrecl why he had chosen Union as the college in which to flll ther his education, he replied that he had considered many other colleges but had finally decided upon Union because of its hugh scholastic standing, its smallness, and the way of living here. The one feature o.f .our campus which A!lberto is most enthusiastic about is Jackson's Garden. \The large and beautiful trees and flow\ ers 1 emind me a lot of my former school in Kentucky,\ said Alberto. He was also enthusiastic about the beauty of the campus and buildings as a whole. Alberto has been in school in Kentucl•y for three years and ha.~ only set foot on his native soil twice in that time. He hopes to make his third trip to Cuba this summer·. Upon his graduation from u.nion, our Cuban student ·is plan- nmg to work for the General Elec- tric Company in his island home unless he can find employment here in the United States, which he would prefer.

The pwgram for the week-end in- cludes worl' on the cabin and grounds, swimming in Thirteenth Lake and a hike in the surrounding area. Those taking the trip are asked to bring blankets, swimming trunks and such tools as ,;hovels, axes, hatchets and hammers. Because of the large number taking the trip, the club's transportation facilities will be taxed to its full capacity. The group will return to the cam- pus on Sunday evening. The following men will take the trip: Fred Wyatt, '32, Professor R. A. Hall, Robert and Richard Hall, Dust Rhoades. '35, Homer Swart. '36. Frank Thorne, '37, Burt Olm- stPd, '40.

Jack Forstbauer and Art LeRoy. 1 Dr. Philemon F. Sturgis, Dean of the Cathedral Church of St. Paul in Boston, Mass., will deliver the first Sunday chapel address of tlte year, in the Memorial Chapel this Sunday. Dr. Sturgis previously ap- peared in Sunday Chapel services in 1935 and again in 1938. Educated in Germany and also at Hobart College, Dr. Sturgis re- ceived his A.B. degree from Yale in 1896; his B.D. from the Episco- palian Theological School, Cam- bridge, in 1900. Brown University has conferred the degree of Doc- tor of Divinit~· upon him. Dr. Sturgis was formerly assis:- ant to Dr. William S. Rainford at St. George's Church in New Yorlt. Aftet· holding the position of 1 ec- tor in the Grace Church from 1916 to 1926, he was appointed !Jean of the Cathedral Church of St. Paul in Boston and has since ~eld that position. Of interest to Union College stu- dents is the fact that Dr. Sturgis' wife is the great granddaughter of Eliphalet Nott, famous president of Union for 60 years. For DeLuxe Coaches CALL Ga A.

The aim of the organization is to stimulate student opinion on present day affairs and to provide a means for expression of that opinion. Tentative plans are for chapel speeches by members of the organization in daily chapel once in every fortnight. This will be followed in the evening by a sec· ond speech, supplementing or op- posing the views given by the morning chapel speaker. Follow- ing this the meeting will become an open floor for questions· and presentation of opinion. Absolute informality will reign, according to Hoffman. Membership will be open to those of the student body whCJ attend and participate in the meetings. Faculty Well Represented The faculty members of the group, which is to be known as the Fortnightly Institute, are Dr. Norman A. Benneton, Dr. Walter C. Langsam, Dr. Vernon A. O'Rourke, Dr. Ernest M.

George Anderson was chosen to marshal the sophomore class, while Bruce May will lead the freshmen. The remaining captains will be picked from among the members of the two committees Dr. Charles Waldron, sec1 etary of the college, gave a short talk on \Class Spirit and Activities\ in which he congratulated the class on tts lively class spirit. \Class spirit is a desirable characteristic,\ he said, \ and scraps between classes are a safety valve for class spirit.\ He then explained that the class could retain its interest in activ- Ities by entering into the regular intramural contests, by giving ~makers, and by holding a fresh- man dance. Epstein Suggests Plan Dr. Waldron advised the fresl':- men to have capable men as officers uf their class and not to show fav- oritism if the candidate did not have the qualities to conduct his office propet·ly. \Men who are not politically minded,\ he continucC, \vote to discourage political nor- inees if the candidates do not fit the position.\ At the close of the meeting, I-.1ar- vin Epstein, '43 read a plan dtawn up by the volunteer freshman cor-.- wittee, whereby the neutrals ~s well as the fraternity men could show their work on the committee.

Force by itself can never master your soul. It can crush your body, silence your mouth, and direct your actions, but it can never overcome your soul. God doesn't establish his kingdom on earth by dropping bombs. The only kingdom God will have is the free acceptance of his rule.\ Devoting this morning's speech to the \maladjustments of the Paris peace settlement,\ Dr. Lang- sam said, \Prominent among the more dangerous heritages of the Versailles settlement was the stigma placed upon Germany by the 'war-guilt' clause. Without trial and without adequate consid- eration, a whole nation was brand- ed an enemy of world society. It can hardly occasion wonder that the German people, jea\~us of their national honor, should have re- sented the slur of an official dec- laration which forced them to ac- cept 'responsibility' for 'causing all the loss and damage to which the Allied and Associated govern- ments and their nationalS were subjected as a consequence of the war imposed upon them by the aggression of Germany and her allies' .

He also stated that the mercurochro!he stains, being long lasting, will be an indication on the campus as to whether or not the various members of the freshman clas& were present at the event. Should the freshmen win the cane rush, the rule forbidding their walking on the grass will not be invoked, whereas if the tide of battle flows the other way, the rule will be placed on the fresh- man \verboten\ list, until the Christmas holidays.

He also announced that Miss Miriam Doyle, the Broadway stage director, will be here Friday to cast \Journey's End\ which the Mountebanks Wlll present as their first play of the season on Novem- ber 17, 18 and 20. Barford emphasized that the Mountebanks will have great need for \stage managers, electricians, property managers, sound men, carpenters, painters, scene design- ers, make-up men, and general theatre handymen\ as well as act- ors and assistants to the business staff. \There is one thing which man needs,\ continued Dr. Sturgis, \and that is government. The question is by what-guns or God? No king- dom dominated by force and sus- tained by guns is lasting.\ Continuing on this theme, Dr. Sturgis said he believed that mod- ern civilization was being afflicted by the belief that one should dom- inate his brother by forGe \whether it is the petty tyranny of the home, Ot' the gigantic and selfish issue of supremacy on the seas.\ ffiqr Olnurnrlltrttaia the activity which offers PRACTICAL JOURNALISM EXPERIENCE VALUABLE CAMPUS CONTACTS FREE SUBSCRIPTIONS AWARD KEYS SALARIES ---0•--- Graduate Council To Meet Here Oct. 13 On October 13 and 14, Union will hold open house for College Week-end, it was announced to- day.

With the new workshop facilities, the technical staff will have the finest equipment with which to build and stage plays on the cam- pus in the history of hte theatre at Union.

The play is to be found in the Freshman \omnibus\ readers used in English classes. \Dominion and greatness and leadership are to be found in him whose words were, \The rulers of the great nations· exercise compul- sion, but among you, it shall not be so. 11 Dr. Sturgis concluded his sermon by condemning the rights of any one individual to command his brother simply because he has at his command more powe:r or wealth. \Although the Versailles Treatey expressly linked war guilt and reparation, it also recognized that Germany's resources were inade- quate to provide complete restitu- tion for all damage indicated in the war-guilt clause .... A Repara- tion Commission was in due time appointed and given until May to evaluate the amount of damage according to this formula and to outline a method of payment. Meanwhile Germany was required to pay on account, in gold or ldnd, five billion dollars. On April 28, 1821, the Reparation Commission announced a total German indem- nity bill of 32 billion dollars. Al- though this was the lowest sum yet to receive official sanction, it was three times as high as the figure recommended by the Allied eco- nomic experts at the peace con- ference.\ \The ill-will engendered by the reparation quarrel was made worse by the simultaneous disputes over the question of aramaments,\ re- (Continued on Page 4) Any freshman or sophomore interested in competing for a board position, or desiring further information as to the competition, is invited to be present at a meeting in THE CONCORDIENSIS office, on -!'he second floor of Silliman Hall at 4:00 o'clock on Wednesday afternoon.

'With almost annual regularity, The Con- cordiensis has pointed out that l'nion is almost unique in its lack of an infirmary, and the editm·ial has usually ended with an impassioned plea that an infinnar:v be built at once. This editorial, while fitting into the annual cycle, does not advocate the erec- tion of an infirmary. It even discourages suc;l a pt·ogram. Estimates for the building of an infirmary have mnged from $20,000 to $60,000, and there is the further consideration that the cost of maintenance would be considerable. The college would be in no position to absorb this expense itself and so, even with an in- firmary, students would be assessed for an infinnary fee. The infirmary fee in the ma- jorit~· of colleges is $1:>. It has been the large initial outlay, and the cost of mainten- ance. which have precluded the building- of an infirmary to date. :\lerely because it has been financially im- possible to build an infinnary, lume\'et, does not solve om problem, and any dormitory resident who has been ill while at college can attest to the fact that it is a problem. To lie in a dormitory room, unattended except for the daily visit of a doctor is unpleasant, to phm:::e it mildly. :\Ienis are apt to consist of sandwiches and milk which friends are thoughtful enoug·h to bring. Certainly such an arrangement is not conducive to a speed~· recovery f1·om any disease, and it is not im- probable that many of the more serious cases of illness might have been averted by proper attention and care while the disease was in an incipient state. Physicians stress the fact that the mental attitude of an ill student, alone in a dormitory room is far from a healthy one. Fraternity residents fare little better than the Dormitory Student. Doctors tell of in- numerable instances in which the patient was found in a secluded corner of a too-well ventilated dormitory section. In fraternity This pt·oblem cannot be ignored, especiaHy when the solution is so obvious and basic. Other colleges without infirmaries have i.n- stituted hospitalization plans to provide for student illness. Could not our answer be found there, also'? :\lerely to show what can be done in this respect, we list the salient points of the hos- pitalization program of a neighboring college which has no infirmary. The plan is tH'- ranged through an agreement with a local hospital, and the cost pet· student is $10 per yem·. Students are entitled to two weeks hospitalization, X-nlys when needed, anes- thesia, operating room fees, laboratory tests, and surgical and medical treatn-lent for aU conditions mising while the student is at schooL Even athletic inj mies are covered by this plan. The hospital sends a doctor to the campus daily. Last year nineteen apendec- tomies were treated-at no cost to the stu- dent.

A Wondering Sophomore. Certainly such a plan is far more attrac- tive than an infirmary program, and the cost is $5 less per yem· than the infirmary fee at most colleges. There are several variations of this plan, all worthy of investigation. Unofficial, b!'+ authoritative sources have indicated that two local hospitals would be willing to co- operate with Union in such a plan. The main objection to such a plan, of course, is that it would increase the cost of attending Union. The student of moderate means will complain about the added impost. What, however, will this same student do when he develops a serious illness, or in- jures himself skiing, or at intramural ath- letics, or even develops a condition requiring surgical attention? To his reply th2t he is never ill, we need only point to the inexor- al.Jle law of averages. We are confident that if a poll be taken of the parents of students in Union (who, after all, usually shoulder the financial burden) the results would show the parents over- whelming·ly in favor of paying this addi- tional fee; if for no other reason than the peace of mind it '..VOuld occasion.

CRITIQUE II Clifford Octet's \Golden Boy\ has been ably transformed by Director Rouben Mamoulian from a play of prestige to a movie which should attain an equal position. In the transformation, the play's unity has been preserved and the ofl- recuning extraneity of the movies is lacking. It is a well-portra~;ed sketch of the entrance of possible wealth and fame into a New York City Italian family. Essentially the picture is good entertainment, and it so justifies itself in the public's opinion. Yet the story em- bodies an old conflict between fame and fortune or the less spectacular path of personal achievement.

The American college student is perhaps given more malicious and falsified publicity than any other type of individual in the world. The movies, the magazines, the radio, even the newspapers conspire to present him as a reckless, carefree nitwit who spends all The widely heralded cane rush and tug-of- war between the freshman and sophomore classes tomorrow will mark a new era of sanctioned and regulated interclass contests on our campus. There is no need to reiterate the why's and wherefore's of tomorrow's program. The Student Cou.ncil, with the sanction of the· college administration, has inaugurated a series of intet·class rivalries and has empow- ered the sophomore discipline committee to administer hai-l' cuts to recalcitt·ant fresh- men in an attempt to rouse class spirit from its former moribund condition at Union. Cer- tainly the intentions of the Council are of the best, and The Concordiensis, in its edi- torial columns, has supported the steps taken. There is little doubt that these inter- class rivalries, in theory, would provide an ideal way of reviving class unity. Now, however, it would seem that the in- evitable has happened. The original purpose of the class frays has been overlooked, and current signs tend to indicate a Roman holi- day for tomorrow afternoon. Apparently authentic reports tell of copious supplies of over-ripe eggs and vegetables which are be- ing stored by each class for the contests. Threats are being made, reprisals being plan- ned, and personalities are more and more entering into the picture. Thus, it becomes obvious, that instead of being a medium to encourage spirit within a class, the scraps will become an instrument which will increase acrimony between classes. Eggs and fruit will fly, sentiment wi1l run high, clothing will be ruined, tempers will dictate the tenor of the battle, injuries will occur, and antipathies which will remain throughout a college career will be made. It is, therefore, with this pictm·e in mind, that we ask that members of both the fresh- man and sophomore class keep in mind the original purpose of tomorrow's program. Union has waited too long for this return of class spirit to have the first attempt at re- vival cut short because a few members of each class have lost sight of the primary goal of class rivalry.

Fox's letters Show America's Reactio·n to ·N;aziism The Concordiensis wishes to thank President and Mrs. Fox for permission to reprint ex- tracts from letters of their son, Herbert 0. Fox, '39, who was doing graduate study in Munich during the outbreak of hostili- ties in Europe. His first haad impressions a r e particularly significant in that they were spontaneously written.-Editot·. Munich, August 16, 1939 I wish you ceuld meet the people with whom I am studying here! I am still marvelling at the great fortune I had in finding such a place which is within my means. They are so friendly and consiue- rate that it seems almost to i.>~ home. Frau Eidam is an extreme- ly interesting woman and is goiql\ to no end of trouble to make my stay here happy and protitrrbk She reads with me in Ni~tsct1e every day and helps me with my German. He~· husband, Het·r· Mu- jor Eidam If the Imperial Army, is a jovial, red faced man with u marvelous sease of humor and he is also a fine violinist! As far as the international po- litical situation goes. I know noth- ing, of course. We hear many ru- mors but I know that they mean nothing. At any rate, the Bradd's have sent me a blanket invitation to their home in Sweden in case something happens. With that in- vitation I am sure I would have no trouble in getting into Sweden. Everyone here, including the Amer- ican consul, tells me that Sweden would be the best place to go, in case of trouble. I could fly there in one day and have my luggage sent after me .... Nazi-Russian Treaty Signed Munich, August 22, 1939. This letter is being written on the day that the German-Russian Treaty wa:; announced. I must say that we Americans and English het e in Germany have not felt overjoyous over such a pact. I am sure that the consequences for the world will be very doubtful. A let- ter, however, is no place for politics so discussions will have to be de- layed until a much later time. It will be vet•y interesting to read the Paris edition of the New York Herald Tribune tomorrow and the next day in order to see what the world reaction to this sensation will be. All we have seen today are the German accounts. One of the American girls in the house got a telegram to come home today so I imagine that the American news- papers carried quite sensational ac- counts. We are all hoping for peace het e-Americans, Dutch, Rouman- ians, Greeks, Bulgarians, English, Swedes and Germans. Isn't it posi- tively stupid to think of the peo- ple at our table all divided against each other across trenches' ... I am sorry that you must wait so long for my letters, but I can't send them from Germany by the Atlantic Clipper IAmer!canl. Be- cause of some stupid trade agree- ment or intemational snarl the~ will not send a letter from Ger- many via the Clipper .... My mail must go by slow boat. You, how- ever, can send me letters by air- mail right now. Advised to Leave Germany Munich, August 28, 1939. What a dreadful week this has been-nothing but war talk and frantic mobilization all over Ger- many. And we get only snatches of news from· outside and almost everything we have heard is most discouraging. I think of the 24th when Poland surrounded the Dan- zig territory. IN.B.: Actually Dan- zig was not surrounded. This was propaganda and false reporting to justify Germany's entry into Po- land.-D. R. F.l That night was pregnant with danger because no one had bothered to talk things over and the ruling force of the moment was emotion. In the mean- time, however, Roosevelt and Da- ladier are corresponding as well as discussions taking place in Ber- lin between Henderson and Hit- ler. I think that the exchange be- tween Hitler and Daladier is es- pecially encouraging. I only hope that the democracies don't capitu- late again as in Munich. I really think that they will not. On the 25th I received a note from the consulate here advismg me to leave Germany immediately because of the \doubtful world sit- uation.\ From the wording of the note, however, I surmised that it was far from an order and was aimed only at our convenience Ctlains, baggage, etc.> and not at our safety. To make sure I called the consulate and was confirmed in my surmise. But on the next da~ it was broadcast on the radio that anyone wishing to travel or leave Germany was advised to do so im- mediately because after the 27th almost all trains and busses would be confiscated for the Army. If I had been well I think I might have gone dewn to Switzerland for a few days w.hich is en'ly thr,ee hours away by train. But it would have been madness to go with such a heavy cold so l stayed .here. L tnin\f: now that things have qui~ted down some that I really saved myself a lot of trouble instead of causing mot•e. But I must admit that It will not be so easy fot· me to get out right now with no trains-if things get worse. But if worst comes ,a worst I can go down ·by motm·cycle. A German friend ·Of mine here has offered to take me if it is absolutely necessary. '1'hat wo11ld entail leaving half my bag- gage but that is better than noth- ing Even in case of a war I am sure I would be quite safe here un- less America was absolutely crazy and got into it also. Visits Hit:er Youth Camp I really hope that our country can be sensible and stay neutral ln the future. Seeing these other lands and talking with the!.\ peo- ples only convinces me that they a1e indubitably different from us in every way. Here in Germany the youth are taught to worship p0wer, war, and \Biut und Ehre.\ I made an excursion the other day to ene of the la·rgest Hitler Youth Camps in Germany. The contrast with our Scout camps and Y.M.C.ll.. camps was most revealing. Th's \Hitler Jugend Lager\ was qmte Spartan and run on very formal military principles. Every hour of the day for these 2,100 children was occupied with some pursuit which was somewhat if not entirely mil.itary in character. From morn- ing to night the tenets of Na- tional Socialism were poured down their throats. And do they love it! You can imagine how these doc- trines appeal to the spirit of ad- venture of those boys from ll tol 18. They are taught that the Ger- man people are the finest in the world and the German nation is the strongest. They are also taught that Germany should have any- thing she wants fot• her \Lebens- raum\ and at the expense of any otheer nation. Of course they are taught that Hitler Is a god and the liberator of his people. Their youthful enthusiasm for all this is only natural. When I was told tha: 90 per cent of the German youth was regimented in this way 1 got a taste of what the German people of 1950-60 would be lilte. On this subject it is wiser to reserve com- ment until a later time! I only say that this experience only served to convince me more thoroughly that America should stay out of this mess. This is really a differ- ent world and it can only hurt us by our meddling with it. German Youths Not Like Others Usually there is a sort of com- radeship between the youth of all the nations of the world. I felt that strongly in Sweden and in France and England last summer. I have met a young National So- cialist my age het·e in Munich and he.ve had several conversations with him. It is as if there were a wall between us because he thinks so entirely differently. He might ru: well be a man from Mars. Any dis- cussion between us is almost im- possible--his premises and mine are so different that argument is useless. He is told to \think with his blood\ and that is just about what he does! I can't remember ever meeting a boy in another country who had so little in com- mon with me. The only thLng we ~eaHy have in c~mmon is the mas- culine sex and that doesn't carry one very t'ar into an unAen;;tanl;l!ng or a f·riendship. And he is a very brilliant law student! I just received a telephone ca·H frem my .friend in Sweden who :n- sisted that I ·leave Germany .his afternoon! .i<'llght to Sweden Stockholm, Sweden, September 5, 1939. Well-here I am again. I am afraid that it is probably a very long time since you have heard from me, but, really, there was ab- solutely ne use writing any sooner because there wasn't any boat ·to take my mail to America. . .. The Swedish .post office told me that perhaps I coul'd get a letter through now for the fi·rst time. As to my escape-and a .rea.J escape it was! Everything was quiet dewn in Munich a week ago and I was sick in bed with a dread- ful cold. I had been advised to leave Germany by the consulate but it would have been madness te go with such a cold. The advice from the consulate was \not to go to Switzerland.\ They said, and quite rightly, that Switzerland was the worst place to go! They were advising all who could to go to Scandinavia. That fitted in quite well with my desires as you can well imagine. Finally, when I was well enough to get up I went dewn to the con- sulate again. They were stm ad- vising Americans to g·o but I was stubborn and didn't feel well and so I didn't go. The next day I get a hunch. that if I wanted to get out I would have to move fast. The Anglo-German discussions couldn't 'last forever. So I caught the only train for Berlin that day which left at 11:30 at night. It was very difficult to find trains anywhere because almost all had been taken over by the Army. Of course no trains had sleepers or dining cars because they didn't have the men to take care of them. So I sat up all night on a dreadful 3rd class train. The next morning we were four hours late in Berlin so I had to wait a whole day and night there to get a train to Sasnitz which meets the Swedish boat, I found a little hotel and managed to get some sleep, even though I was ghastly sick. The next morning the elevator boy told me the \cheerful news\ that the Germans had moved into Poland. I then heard the radio announcements of Hitler's message to the German people. I was afraid that the Sasnitz train wouldn't go but it did and with me on it. I heard, when I got on, that this train was the last one to go to Sweden and that the Swedish border would be definitely closed after this day. I really had phenomenal luck to make it when I did. I must say that this war has ruined a lot for all of us. Oh! How \an people bo so stupid? I only ~lope with all my heart that Amer- Ica can really stay neutral. Swe- ~en has re~lly learned that stay- mg neutral Is not a passive action but an active one. Everyone must tl'~· to stay neutral. That's some- thmg which America won't do I afraid. am Herbert 0.

Thus far Great Britain and France seem not to be placing much faith in the nwmisP that Poland is the la,;t demand: they have had un- folt unatl.' experiencP with similar promises in the past. And that, incidentally, may well be the ex- planation of why the Bolsheviks were so quick to collect on a prom- ise made to them.\ In conclusion, Dr. Langsam European JFar Views Gi t'ell by Bronner, Doty <Continued from Page 1) sin's positiom is that of the coun- t! y which holds the balance of power, \a new situation for Rus- sia in modern times.\ \In view of this position,\ Dr. Doty explained, \Russia will in- crease her power in the Bal·kans and on the Baltic as she has done in Poland and will be the European nation to profit most if the .present war proves to be a long one.\ Both men agreed that from th~ German point of view. the mew position o! H.ussla is very dangerous. The present world conflict has already proven to most that the World War of 1914-18 was not, as claimed, the wa1· to end wars and to preserve democracy. As to whether this new struggle is a real attempt to preserve democracy the two professors were doubtful. Dr. Bronner claimed that it is partly a real attempt. \If the war lasts ten years the economic and social institutions as we know them will be changed so much as to make them unrecognizable. It may mean the abolition of the capitalistic system as we know it or it may mean that we will become self- sufficient, which would not be de- sirable since it would lower our standard of living. The political in- stitutions would probably stay the same. but their operations would be en til ely different.\ Dr. Doty, on the other hand, did not feel that thc issues were :;ufficiently clari- fied to say whether the present con- filet is a real attempt to preserve democracy, since there are two countries with democt·atic form of government fighting a countt·y with a totalitarian form. A possible solutwn or outcome to the foreign situation was broached by Dr. Bronner who be- lieves that the final answer lies in a United States of Europe. \This of course, will only come after the peoples are so worn out that they don't care what happens as long as there is peace.\ The Harmony Grill on Hamilton Street is overrun with a crowd of Kappa .Sigs.

On the basis of what Hitler has done thus far it may be that he is trying to reassemble in one political organization all the po1tions of the former Holy Ro- man Empire. If this should be his aim. if he should seek to be a successor to that Count Rudolph who became the first Hapsburg King of the Germans, then I am reminded of the prayer offered up by Rudolph's neighbor, the Bishop of Basel, when he heard the news of the count's election: 'Oh, Lord God, sit tight upon thy throne, lest thP Count of Habsburg shove Thee off~' \ PINE GROVE DAIRYu Inc ..
