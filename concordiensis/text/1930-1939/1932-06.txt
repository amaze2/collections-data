Errors by the Garnet infield last week gave the Cherry and White combi1lation the opening game of their two game series by the score of &-3. Hard hitting on the part of the Troy batters also helped to pave the way for Sakui·day's down- fall. Coach Hatfield bas spent most of his time during this week's drills in smoothing over the gap- hole left at the hot corner by the removal of Fred Bruhn. Sabatini held down third base in the Rens- selaer contest, but his performance wa:s mediocre. Bavisotto, who has been drilling in the position all week, saw action in the game with Massachusetts State on Monday. Bavisotto proved to be the better of the two· although his work is l;)y no means brilliant. He made a better showing at the plate and it is likely that this will be the de- ciding factor in the choice of a third baseman. The Garnet mento-r has not yet announced his sta·rting hurler, but it is probable that Meredith will take the mound. Dill, however, may be selected to repeat. Dill's work last week was steady and capable. He turned away 14 R. P. I. batters and, with more support from his mates his toiling might have resulted in a victory. No startling changes have been announced in the Union line-up. The Rensselaer team will remain the same. Garnet Trackmen ·End Poor Season Team Will Lose Four Seniors; New Material Promises Added Strength From the point of view of meets wo11, the Garnet track season was far from a success. The Union trackmen did not succeed in win- ni~g a meet, losing to Amhet·st, Middlebury, Manfuattan, Hamilton, and R. P. I. Ratfuer than present- ing a comprehensive revi:ew of the past season the prospects for next year will be considered. Inability to score points in the dashes and the weight events, es- pecially the shot put was largely the cause of the poor showing. In every meet, Union was compelled to concede a,bout 36 points tG the opposition. The broken arm suf- fered by Van Wert in the Manhat- tan meet was also a heavy blow to the team. Lose Four Men The Union runners wiH lose only four men by graduation this year: Captain Cohn, Savage, Van Wert, and Hoffman. The loss of Cohn will be keenly felt as he was a tower of strength in the high and low hurdle races and the high jump. Savage was a consistent winner in the high jump, and Van Wert was dependable in the pole vault and the broad jump. The Garnet still has Turner in the hur- dles a11d the high jump, Reeder in the low hurdles and pole vault and Mirate in the broad jump, all of whom have scored consistently in these events, and with a season be- hind them, should do much better next year. The track team this year was composed mostly of sophomores.
