His • textbooks will continue ta be recognized · as the best in their field. Education has lost a notable exponent in the death .of this man. Union loses more than a great educator · with the death of Dr. Hale. It loses a mau who had the intereilt of Union and of Union men at heart. Dr. Hale grew with Union College and learned to revere it as his own · Alma Mater. Many offers were made to: him to go to schools of greater fame, at . far greater salaries, but he prefered to stay · at Union and give of his best to us. · Dr. Hale was occassionally misunder- stood, but always respected. Always fair · and broadminded, he attempted to realize the student's point of view at all times. We shall cherish the memory of this great educator, theologian, and scholar. WELCOME FRESHMEN We are glad to welcome to Union the class of 1936. You have been chosen as representative of the best plane of American youth. The college abounds with tradition and lore. Acclimate your- self to this new environment as soon as possible, so that you also, may realize that Union is one of the outstanding small calleges in Ameica. Union represents the highest ideals and standards of Am- erican manhood. Do not alloW your personal con- duct to blemish this honor. · · President Day delivered an address last year to us on the relation of extra-curricular activities to curricular work. \Do not mistake shadows for the real objects\ was his way of comparing these two fundamental issues. lt might be weil for all of you to remember these words of wisdom, in starting your college career. Restrictions and orders are placed upon you, as freshmen. These may seem ridiculous and im- mature to some of you, but these rules have been deemed advisable by your elders, so obey and hon- or them. Union is the \Mother of fraternities\. The fraternity system is exceptionally strong here and there are more fraternities at Union per cap- ita than in any other college. Pledge to a house if you are able, so that you may profit by the in- comparable fellowship and brotherhood which may be gained in a fraternity. FRESHMAN-SOPHOMORE SCRAPS The showing made at the \scraps\ Tuesday was extremely disappointing. Less than twent~· sophomores participated in the events. Whether or not the remaining members of the class consider the traditions of Union worthy of their partici- pation is of little consequence. It does stand however that more than six- sevenths of the class of 1935 did not have enough intestinal fortitude to take an active part in the age old custom. The interest of the .sophomore classes, in .reg~rd to the \scraps has decreased steadily: for the last five years. It was, with this in mind, . , .. TH]j:!_ CONCORDIENSIS, FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 23, The Grecian Nightmare ~o y~u freshmen who haven't fallen for the a~lurmg hne handed out by these ·~sinks of iniq- u~ty,\ the fraternities, ·or to anyone who wants a mce pleas.a:nt pla~e in which ,to abide, the sign recen~ly displayed <~n. the door o:f our Dean might be of mterest. . The s1g:n? . \FURNISHED ROOMS TWO DOLLARS;\ My! .My! What ,queer turns this much heralded depres1:1ion takes. We've heard of students desj·ring to go ta chapel (Oh, yes, w~ can Show you both of them) but the Iat.est has tll:e_m all beat. Can you imagine anyone bemg so anxmus .ta attend that he wauld' actually attempt to drive in the front door at thA hour when milk bottles are nestling against porch steps? Yeu don't have to tak:e our word for it. Ask Sch0ony; ar better yet, take a >look at that front axle and figure .it out for yourself. It used to be a favorite sport to mix one green freshman with six potent beers and produce one :new pledge. But times have certainly changed. ~ow the ~tamont .Fair holds a :uespected position· m the rushmg curriculum. Maybe Dr. Ligon could prove th3;t ~he emoti:onal pressuve brought to bear on the V·lCbm when watching Billy Winn polish the. guard rail with his scqoter is greate·r than that created when alcehol leaves the wary freshman unwary. We also noticed that the Idol w:as gaudily rob- ed in a spotless white gown yesterday. The neck- tie was a little off center but then these old boys ought to be allowed to wear a tie as they darn please. It seems rather early in the season for Hallo- ween pranksters, and' the R. P. I. game i$ still far in the future. It was, however, inscribed with the 'tute letters, so we'll have to biame some playful freshmen. Queer, tllese Chinese. If anyone dis- ~overs a couple of sheets missing from his bed, J.Ust speak to Tom. He is a first class consoler . Early merning studes were completely ~hocked yesterday morning while dreaming to their eight o'clocks. We hadn\t realized that Old Man De- pressien had thrust his poisonous fangs into the heart of Ye College On The Hill. Such seemed to be the exact case, however, as a. large and strik- ing sign hung on the Chapel indicated that it was \For Sale.\ It seems that \the powers that be\ are ·in bad shekel straits, for below the glaring words \For Sale\ were added the words, \Or Exchange.\ This certainly is an unriv:aled business opportunity. Think of the uses for this grand old box of ce- ment! Rumor has it that Prexy has been swarmed with offers for ·the disposal of the stricture! Yes, Tony, yau wouldn't have to worry about pvotection, and it would be so handy for the boys. \Burn 'em up Homer\ has the second chance at the place with Edward ''South College\ a close third factor. It seems that the latter is going to promote a nation-wide campaign for indoor rock gardens. -SHNOZZLE that the custom was changed two years ago. Soph- omares were allowe!l to defend the Idol, so as to equalize the strength of the two classes. If complete supp<Jrt is not given to an activity such as this, it is ;better that it be abolished. A tug-of-war m.ig:ht be substituted for the paint fight. More men would be willing to uphold the glory of their class and keener interest would be shown. Some colleges have a pole climbing contest to determine the relative strength of the classes. Innovations at Union such as these would result in a sharper spirit of rivalry, at the same time adding to the number of partici,pants. RELIGION The words \religion\ and \college men\ are seldom used to-geth~r except in a disparaging manner. What is there about religion that clashes with the modern college man's theories of life? Few of us have the courage to denounce it to the extent of practicing atheism. Atheists should be respected for their courage of con- victions. Too many college men base their con- ceptions of religion on a set of principles practiced two thousand years ago, How many men wouid follow engineering if they were forced to ase only the methods employ- ed by the Romans? Engineering would take-a sad plight. In the .same way, religion is doomed if it is interpreted in th-e same way as it was when the books of the Bible were written. Religion is model'Il. It must l;Je translated into our modern world of ideas. It is condemned bY those who fail to build up this transition, and until religion is made a modern issue, it will fail ta gain the regard of college men who are in- terested in the latest developments in their par.: ticular fields of labor, Religion is the sdence of li:lle and until we make it fit into to-dlliy's complex mass of business and science, it will f:ail in its attempt to act as our moral guide. The failure of theologians to modernize re- ligion in proportion to the changing warld, ·is the cause of the decrease in religious activities in American colleges. Wllen this is realized and acted upon accordingly, religion will be resto:r.ed to its proper position of Importance. 000 Before tackl'iu.g the season's : books, plays;, talkies; and assorte(i · quips, the Sign of t'he Three Goose- • · · Egg-s begs leave to salute and congratulate the :former possessors .· 'of two hundred doilavs, the incom- . · . • in,g infants kl!loWn as ' · THE CL,ASS OF 19.36 · As I .gaze ·il!l your down-turned faces · · Established' 1830 · Where red competes with greea, Alert for the. faint~st tra:ces Of promise that yoa'll be keen, · .

GODSHALL STUDIES CHINESE SCHOOLS Political S cienc~ Head Returns From Year's Leave in the Orient Educa,tioa is one of the many remedies prescribed for the politi- cal and military impotence of China, according to Professor W. L. Godshall, professor of Political Science, who has just returned from a year's trip through China and Japan. \Confining our attention first to Chinese government, schools anrl colleges,\ said Dr. Godshall in an interview with a Conc;ordiensis re- porter, \g1•eat difficulty is exper- ienced in procuring experienced and otherwise suita;ble teachers because of insufficient remuneration. Max- imu·n salaries for college teachers of :r: rofessional rank is wbout Mex. $350 per month, payable occasional- ly in depreciated currency. Costs of living to maintain a respectable level are high. Accordingly,, men seek appointmllnts in two or more institutions so that the joint com- pensation will more nearly make both ends meet. Equipment Is Poor \In government institutions the equipment is very poor. In the mis- sion colleges there are move and better facilities, but even in these there are signs of deterioration ap- IParent to ll;he outside obset·vers which are not generally admitted by those close to the work. \Among the requirements is reg- istration with the Ministry or Edu- cation, which can be effected only by compliance with certain I'estric- tions and principles. The most .~: ..:o.;: ,- ,triction is that no em- ph'\' 1 be placed upon the ,:;h ,.. urpose of millsion insti- ', • t' ,her provision$ prohibit compulsory religious exercises or instruction i:n Christianity, and re- quire the appointment of Chinese administrators by boards of direc- tors in China. Schools Weaken \At once, opposition arose on the scene that these regulations unduly infringed the freedom essential to public institutions, but most of the schools weakened in their stand and conformed. This defection serious- . ly dilluted the morale of the oth- ers, until only a few of them sbood aloof. \Another serious problem arises from registration, due to certain Chinese characteristics. A l'egister- ed school must have a Chinese head. That in itself can be open to no objection on grounds of nation- ality or race. And there is no rea- son why a Chinese administrator could not be as well-equipped in a technical or professional sense as any other person. But the Chinese nation finds itself where it is today partly because individuals .too sel- dom can be persuaded to stand out against the crowd.\ Dr. Barnes Quits Secretary Post (Continued from page 1) Union College. In 1905 he was pr,omoted to adjunct professor, and to full professor in 190q. Held Many Offices He has held the following of- fices: President of the New York State Mod·ern Language Associa- tion, chairman of the National Fed- eration of Modern Languages As- sociation, for six years member of New York State Regents Exami- nation Committee in modern lang- uages, for fifteen years supervisor of the college entrance examination board examinations in the Albany division, editor of the Union Col- lege Bulletin for twenty years, member of the committee on mod- ern language syllabus of New York State, and member of the executive committee of the National Federa- tion of Modern Languag~ Associa- tion. Dr. Barnes has written many articles for the Modern Language Journal; one of them aroused much heated discussion in 1917, for he made a strong plea for the contin- uance of Ge..rman in the curricula of the schools in spite of the fact that Germany was at war with the Unit- ed States. The soundness of his plea was verified later, after the w:ar when schools realized that they had deprived many of their stud- ents of a thorough grounding in a language that is increasing in im- portance in the sciences and litera- ture. He also published \Gveek Accidence,\ once a widely used text- book. Mr.s.

PROPOSED SOCIAL TAJ{ A proposed social tax was discussed yesterday in 'Stlldent Eody meeting. The creation of this social budget is :manifold in its benefits. Two dollars per semester would be levied upon all undergraduates, payable at registration. This would constitute an approximate total o:f thirty- two hundred dollars. This sum could be appor- tioned so as to allow for a budget of two th<msand dollars for Prom and twelve hundred dol.Jars for Soiree. These sums would assure us the best in or- chestras for both dances, and there would be no worry as to the financial burden. A definite bud- get could be drawn up by the registrar and the committees would know ex.actly how much to spend. At the same .time, everyone would be able to attend these social functions. College dances should not be given for the purpose of making money, but for all undergraduates to meet in a social capacity. More students would be able to attend these functions, and better dances would result. The possibility of misappropriations would be eliminated by the close check which could be made by a faculty supervisor. At the present time, it is possible to misappropriate funds, due to the im- possibility of check. · · The problem of favors is of importance. Due to the increased attendance, it would be necessary to abolish the custom of distributing favors. It would be possible, however, unlike last year's dance, to provido;l .excellent catering service tor both dances. Concerning this year's dances, The Concord- iensis further suggests that Prom be finan()ed by a temporary fund, created by a special t;l.x of two and one-half doliars, payable at registration in February. · A COLLEGE CAFETERIA The question of whether or not we should have a cafeteria on the campus, sponsored by the college will arouse interest in almost every under- graduate. The establishment of such an enter- prise would effect both fraternity and non-frater- nity men, stu.dents living in Schenectady and those commuting to school. A cafeteria in Silliman hall, as proposed, would be a decided convenience to Schenectady men, especially those who have no fraternai af- filiations. With a reasonable expense the local student could have lunch at tile cafeteria, thereby eliminating the much disliked rush to get home for lunch and back to the campus for afternoon classes. The f.reshtnen would become acquainted more rapidly in such a place. All upperclass. mem- bers of fraternities and ne11trals would find a common meeting spot with an informal atmos- phere that would go far to'Ward awakening the slumbering college spirit. The barriers of .frater- nity affiliations would be forgotten, resUlting in a feeling of equality seldom experienced on a col- lege campus. The \Y\ building would become a central gathering point on the campus, rather than a little used structure. Considering the proposal :from a commercial viewpoint, the.re are seen immediately sev:eral financial gains. The money which the undergrad,. uate is now spend~ng for food. except at .the f.ra- ternities, gives .no direct support to the college. With . a cafeteria the money would remain :within the college to be used by the college. One or mdre students would find employment there, benefiting THE BOUNDING. B.· ROOK .

W. S., Jr. directly in a financial way. Because of the more reasonable rates made possible by running the cafeteria without profit, all students eating there would save money. It seems that, if for no other reason, the undergraduates would patronize the cafeteria because of the lower costs. Of course there is the possibility that some fellows might abuse the privilege by using the place as a \hang-out\ when they should be at a desk. And again, The Concordiensis would be ser- iously burt financially by the loss of advertising paid by local cafeterias and lunch rooms. If the cost of eating at the cafeteria should be made lower than that at the fraternities, the latter may lose the support of of the city men who are in the habit of eating at the fraternity tabJes. The plan taken as a whole, however, should be seriously considered. Dr. Day evidently favors the scheme. It's up to the undergraduates to voice their opinion on the matter. D.C. W. BALLYHOO The general tendency in most colleges today is to strip the ballyhoo from college life. The un- favorable response made to the freshman-sopho- more figl.}.ts last week deMonstrated that this nat- ion-wide tendehcy is juGt beginning to be felt here. At another college in the east the cheer lead- ers have decided to discard plans for pep-meet- ings before football games, because the students felt that such demonstrations are futile. It would appear as though college is attaining the status of a business, into which one puts time and money with the hope of return, either culturally or in- trinsically. The large attendance at the student body meeting Monday morning gave the impression that the students are beginning to take more in- terest in the conduct of their affai·rS than in the past. Hope may have risen immediately in many students that at last democracy is justified, . inas- much as several hundred .supposedly intelligent college men turned out to conduct their own gov- ernment. But the meeting began with an uproar and ended with one. Aside from a few questions and announcements, little was accomplished. The conduct of the legislators themselves prevented any legislation. Immediately following the meet- ing a hat-snatching orgy occurred. No one among those doing the snatching realized that each fresh- man paid a dollar for their hats; each one lost meant another dollar to be expended in order to obey a campus tradition. It will be many years before all the ballyhoo built around colleges will disappear; It is gradual- ly fading into non-existence, and eventually people may realize that .a college education is not for · everyone, hut for those who can utilize those four years to worth--while purposes.

Notice to this effect was made today by Professor J. Harold Witt- ner, director of athletics, in the following statement: \Repeated and apparently willful violation of the rules pertaining to the playing of tennis on Sundays, both last term and thus far this year, has been the cause of constant embarrassment and annoyance to the President, and to the Director of Physical Education. \The restrictions are plainly stat- ed and have been published in The Concordiensis and posted on the various bulletin boards on many occasions. There is not the slight- est possibility of misinterpretation so that non-observance can be con- strued only as utter disregard of the regulations by offenders. \Unless immediate and complete observance is forthceming, the Di- rector will recommend to the ad- ministrative authorities that this privilege be rescinded.\ The rules to which this statement refers are the regulations requiring that play on Sunday shall not begin until 1 o'clock in the afternoon and continue not later than 6 o'clock in the evening. The players must also be dressed in a clean white cos- tume.

Two Plans Submitted to Fra- ternity Representatives At a special meeting of the Inter- fraternity Council held Tuesday af- ternoon, the recentiy-suggested plan of cooperative buying for all fra- , ternities was taken up in d,etail, and two plans submitted by the proponents of the scheme. The plan was first discussed at the regular meeting of the Council last week, and it embodies the idea of having all of the fraternities af- filiated with the college buy their · commissary suppiies through a common source. a stuc]:ent or by a man comtected in no way wifh the coll~ge.

Stewart POLITICAL DEALS With class elections. on Monday the alleged politicians of the campus are busy .at w~rk pro- moting their personal interests in an attempt to gain glory by small and false means. Deals are in the making for all class offices, including those for Prom and Soiree t::ommittees. Any person or persons found guilty of participat- ing in a deal, whether or not they are elected, wHl be punished by the Student Council. This is not entirely a personal matter. A fra- ternity man found guilty or suspected of such un- derhandedness, not only brings much dishonor to his own name, but .also to his fraternity. Class office holders should represent the pop- ular choice of the entire class. Any man who will chance his honor and pride, as well as that of his :fraternity and college, by participating In any po- litica;l agreement should be dismissed from nis fraternity and college. When men take the stand to discourage and abolish deals regardless of their magnitude, class offices will b~ restored to their proper position of dignity and respect. A man who does lower himself to such low measures of office gaining loses the complete re- spect of his classmates, but even greater, loses his own self respect. FRESHMAN SFmiT It seems to have been an annual custom in the past to editorially re:primand the freshmen concerning their spirit, or rather the lack of it. This year is no exception. In fact, if ever a fresh- man class needed to be told bluntly that it is the most· spiritless class ever to enter Union, the class of 1936 need::; it now. It shculd be the rare occasion when a first year man fails, for any reason, to speak to upper- classmeE. The current vogue, however, reverses the situation. An \hello\ from a freshman come~ in the nature of a surprise. There is no better way of becoming acquainted on the campus than by speaking and appearing friendly to the other members of the college. The average freshman, at p~esen~, goes ab~ut with head lowered and expressiOn distant, obliv- ious of other men walking by him. He seen:ls to have no realization that he is on the. th~eshold of one of the greatest adventures in h1s hfe, a col- lege career. It is his opportui_tity to establish last- ing friendships, close compamons, and fond me~­ ories. He will never do this so long as be contm- ues in his present attitude. Appro:J(imately fifty freshmen. reporte? .far cheer practice yesterday afternoon. A Similar repres.entation was noticed .earlier ~n the w~ek. This is certainly a most d1scouragmg show1;ng. Members of their own class have been ;workmg sincere~lv on the gridiron day after d~y m order that the class might be represented. m Intercol- legiate conte13ts, yet only fi~tr of the same class are possessed of enough sp1r1t to lend .their sup- port to ,the team. . It may not be that the freshmen are. entirely at fault, SUch incidents as the hat-snatchmg orgy indulged in by the sophomores following the stud\ ent body meeting Monday will . ~ever . act as a stimUlant to genuine college sp1r1t. Unless the frosh receives .an answer when he does speak to upperclassmen, he will soon come to consider the custom an unnecessary and irksome one. .Unless the upperelassmen set an example by attending Peeping lbru the Keyhole You h~we all heard the phl'aSe which goes like this, \Reluctan:t as the News Hawk to suppre11s his gossip.\ Which aU serves to remind me that Mr. and Mrs. Gossip hav:e been hard to locate this week. Well- It was explained to nie that M·r. ~Tohn SulHvan of the Beta House was visiting in Cleveland last week accompanied by :two .personal friends, or I mi'ght say body guards, because they did act in that capacity for a V17piie~ The interesting thing ·concerns the· loss of his pa,ats, either stofen or strayed. Upon discovery the next merning of the loss Mr. SuUiv;:m ilninediately ·called up his n·,any friends in the city seek'i-ng material to match h·is ceat and vest. Aid was rendered by a person who formerly went to an \Instittr'ticm\ al;>out twenty miles north of here. T:P.e Pants. were discovered at the corner of the hotel: cle~k's desk. 1: ·discov- ered that Mr, Sulli:vai;l's purpose of going to Cleve\'\ land was ln the rale of a \'Big Eastern Bttye:r;\ Yes, he told a cop who sto~ped him, earl·y in the morning, he was in town to 'buy a horse. The other afternoon Cl>piJola was traiUng a double reverse play around right end. When the play was completed Schreck inquired of Coppola as to what he was doiQg :hack there. \Oh I'm waiting for a tumble.\ The Chi Psi Lodge has been the object of thieves, Your writer was informed that ·the amount has reached one h.undred and flfty-two dollars.

Listen,· if you have any desires -of becoming rich over night don't go to the Chi Psi House without firearms. The boys have· put a .bed in the visitor's room and placed a sawed-off .shot gun under the pillow. I can't sweat' to this, but I heard the watchman failed to wake up when one Of his brothers removed the weapon and then rubbed his face. Saw Bob Wiley wearil)..g his new imported jacket today. Heard one of the more intelligent freshmen say ·it looked real ••ducky.\ By the way he showed me the Cambrid,ge label on it wh.iJe walking up the center aisle of chapel today. There is rumor of his paying a visit to an A~eri­ can Indian Reservation next Christmas vacation. Frank Higgins who kee]ls his tennis racquet at the Phi Delta Theta House is. taking his studies very seriously this year. At the first meeting ·he asked Mr. Achilles if the class was going to study the \Middle Testament:\ N~w creations seem to take place every day. What do you think of this for audacity? Two bad boy~ from one of the larger fraternities went over to the Kappa .Alpha Lodge and pledged two prospective Kap pledges. Can you inlagine it, right on the <lawn. Pardon me, a visitor down stairs with some gossip. ....,.Tee Pee. college events- and shewing spirit, certainly nevv--- comers to the campus can not be expected to de- velop any spirit independently. A greater willingness on the part of the mem- bers of the upper classes to aid in making the fTeshmen feel a.t home will do much to instill the nmcl:l desired college spirit In the freshman class. -D.C.W. ON THE USE OF THE \Y\ With the Union College News Bureau located on the second fl()or o£ Silliman Hall there is more reason to believe that this building will not deter- iorate into a decayed old strtlcture. 'The presence of a member of the Administration in the old Y has a disciplinary effect upoq some students who have been accustomed to misuse the building. But there is still :room for improvement: Students who congregate there at noon time and other times of the day should remember that the maga- zines and other facilities provided by the Y are intended for all the undergraduates in the college and therefore care should be exercised in their use. We sympathize heartily with Dean Garis who has announced he will deny the privilege of using the building to those students found guilty of treating the .building in a shabby fashion. Magazines should be replaced in the racks, chairs should be kept in their places, and the buiiding treated in other respects just as one treats one's home. EXTRA-CU:6RICULAB ACTIVITIES The apex of collegiate ~mbition so often,. it ap- pears, is to acquire a veneer -of sophistication which can be bro.uglit into service on any occasion. This ideal, the essence of which is mental poise, is practi~able ·only when carried on to the :next logical step. I . Cosmopolitanism is the natural outgrowth of true sophistication.
