Murphy Friday, Ap'ril 11, 1930 CONGRATULATIONS Congratulations are due to the lacrosse man- agers, to the Department of Athletics, and to President Day £or all that they have done m arranging the international lacrosse game which will be played on Alexander field Mon- day. Many difficulties were encountered m scheduling the contest, but it was felt, and rightfully so, that the Garnet could not forego meeting the Oxford-'Cambridge team. Union was one of the first American colleges to play the British team on its tour of this counb-y four years ago. Because of this, and m v1ew of the fact that Union was tied with the Naval Academy for the lacrosse championship of the United States last season, it is only fitting and proper that we should cross sticks with the star English aggregation on their second tour of this country. Congratulations to all those con- cerned in arranging the match ! The game with the Oxford-Cambridge team on Monday afte1·noon is pe1•haps the most out- standing event in the present athletic year at Umon. It is an extra~season game which was not provided for in the lacnosse budget, and it was only made possible by the cons{:nt of President Day to unde1·write the guarantee to the visitors. He .did this m the belief that it was the unanimous wish of the Student body that a match with the English team take place on the campus. Students can best sho:w their gratitude for this generous act of the President by helping to swell the gate receipts Monday afternoon and inducing as many visitors as possible to attend the international lacrosse match.

TenniS' on Sunday. · Once again comes -the plaint of those who wish to play tennis ort Sunday on the College courts; . We think that there is -nothing • wrong in putting a Sunday afternoon to advantage by taking some healthy e~e1·cise. The rule prohibiting any tennis o~ Sunday is a relic of tbe olden times when students were forced to spend their Sanday afternoons in church and were forbidden. • to. do anything more str-enuous than take a walk. In these days . of church in the morning and golf in the afternoon, we think that ·· the authorities should see the student's point of view and allow .them to play tennis on the campus if they wish to. It is true that if playing was allowed in the morning, it might disturb those in the chapel or that it might keep students from going . to Sunday chapel. Eut if allowed in the a:ftemoon, it would do , no more harm than to keep some of the undergraduates from · going to 'the movies or from wandering around t(:)wn getting. · into mischief. Golf. It was brought to i>ur attention by one of the members of the golf squad of last year that letters for that spott were ne:v:er · awarded to the men who earned them. It s·eems 'that if these · letters were not awarded they should be, in order that those men w'ho won them might have the oppo1·tunity of wearing them. We understand that a golf :tournament is to be held in the near future to bolste1· up the squad and give \€Very one an op- ·. · porhmity to show what they can do. The golf team is .sure to · improve if a large number try out, for someone may be disc- covered in the tournament who otherwise would no't go out for the team.

MitcheU Taxi and Drivurself ·Service ANNIVERSARY • 1930· Cupolas controlled from the laboratory White hot rivers of metal, pouring from big cupolas in Crane foundries, are even more tlloroughly analyzed, more carefully watched, than the drinking water pouring from a faucet in a well-ordered city. Because correct chemical ingredients in valve rnetals are as essential to absolttte safety and right functioning of a piping installation as pure water to human health, Crane Co. has _ always maintained laboratory .control of its cupolas. This means that experts in the metallurgical and physical testing of metals are responsible for the quality of every valve and fitting turned out. It means that tensile strength., yield point, elongation; and reduction of area of test bars taken every hour of the day's mn are known to laboratory and cupola chemists. It means tha.t const~ntly, as tlle metals pour out, the proportion ofsilicon, manganes.e, car- bon,phosphorus,calcium,pure iron, are known and uniformly maintained. It means immedi- ate correction of any variation and rejection of faulty materials. .From specifications of raw m<~terials to final installation, Crane Co. knows its products and what they will do. How Crane Co. developed the background for this know ledge makes an absorbing story. It is titled Pioneering in Science. You are cordially invited to send for your copy.

Union and bring fame to their fu- · · ture Alma Mater.\ .. All-around men are, I must ad- . mit, usually big frogs· in the small puddle of college life, and some- times quite justly so. Still, are · they the only type that your dis-· criminating editorial writer wishes to admit into his select college en- vironment? Is he himself an all-·· around man? If he isn't, he .should flee in shame. But .before he de- parts, let us consider what an ail- round man is. I rather imagine he had a trind of glorified Barstow or Adams in his visionary mind. They were without doubt good men. Some geniuses do achieve success in that way; but the less gifted dub who tries to imitate them may find that he merely becomes .Jack of all trades and master of none. More than that, he will pr.obably. find that his Senior year-which is his last chance for the leisurely en- joyment of his favorite ta13ks and recreatioi:ts~is entirely taken up by a ceaseless round of useless activ- ity in dashing around the campus on a score of petty, diversified er- rands. What of the few men who,· through luck or courage-or both-' have been able to escape the con- fused bustle of many activities? H,?.ve they not been valuable men, both here and hereafter? Think of a few of them please. I do not need to recall their names to you,, for their influence was too force- ful to permit us t.o forget them. . Not being a grind-except per-'. haps at examination periods-and having engaged in a few of these delightful college activities, I feel that I may take the liberty to cri- ticize. But have not even the well- known Greasy Grinds a useful· function in college? If you hap ·pen to. know of one nearby, glance mto h1s room some evening before examination. You will probably be- hold him surrounded by a group of all-around men, who are diligently {wonderful to say) copying his lec- ture notes and plaguing the so- called grind with questions. The aU-around men is usually all around the campus, but . too infrequently permitted to settle down in his study. He has to swallow his. knowledge in undigested masses. If he is quick at lea.rining, he there- by becomes an honor man scholas- tically, and may even achieve the Golden Key of Erudition. But he obtains it at the price of several important concessions to the Great god, Ambition. I do not mean to disparage the aU-around man. If he is really good, he is very useful. He pro- vides an ideal for secluded, timid souls to worship. Someone must carry water to thirsty teams and· publish books with our pictures in them when we are lofty juniors (than which there is no loftier spe- cies). Men must do all kinds of dirty, arduous things for their so- called Alma Mater. But why must any one man be required to do se- veral ~ or indeed any ~ of these tasks? Your worthy pen-wielder need not worry. There have always been plenty of men willing to play wet-nurse to the football team; will- ing to paint scenery; willing to make trip reports; even willing to write editorials on the spur of the unfortunate moment; But, if only for the sake of variety, let us jeal- ously guard our modicum of grinds and our benighted non-ac- tivity men.

The purpose of this message IS to infol\lll stud~nts of something they already know, that the period of examinations IS not fa1· off. The Conven- tiO'llal message then continues with a. few obser- Yations on spring, the ·temptations of the milder· weather and the devastating e:ffects of spring When athletic games were mentioned Algy looked the other way, For his normal fag consumption Was ten packages a: ·day. Thomas Jackson MeN amara Filled the coaches' hea.1·ts with JOY, Half a mile in less than evens Was a picnic for that boy. Mac had speed, he had endurance, He had quanti'ties of guts, He would seem to leave his rivals Standing stupid in their .ruts. Now it cha11ced one summers evening That a little giTl had strayed On a lonely railroad crossing; There was pia ying, unafraid. From the .d.im podentous dista-nce Came the roa1· of an express, What the chances were to save her You're at liberty to guess.

' THE CONCOJ.lPIENSIS, TUESDAY, APRIL 22, 1930 Page Five A. Pine Start . . . Coach Hal Wittner got his team off to a fine start Saturday when the Garnet beat Northeastet>n by a 13 to 2 scun·e. The Union rooters who had expected to see t\. weak pitching sta:fi get pounded over the lot, received a pleasant surprise when M;eredith held the New England~rs to fouT scattered .singles. 'l'he team showed plenty of power in its opening contest and · with a few mo1•e games. under its belt, it should have ,an ext·remely suec~ssful E;Mson. 1 New Scoreboard The game Saturday gave further evid~nce of the need for a modern scoreboard that will allow spectators to· know just how the game is going. During the greater part of the contest, lhe . scoreboaTd was wrong and a great deal of confus·ion arose since . the spectators were unable to learn just how tl1e game stood. A new scoreboard would net cost a great deal an(l the service which it would perform would more than make up fo1· the cost. Ho.w About the Kids? We noticed at the game Saturday that there were a large number of small hc::>ys running around the field and cheering the team on to a victory.

It would be rather cruel to exclude tlte young8ters from the game since they mean well and they enjoy the game. There is a great deal of room around the diamond and the bleachers near the new athletic field are rarely used by spectators, Since a large number of these younger enthusiasts get into the fie:ld to see the game ·even if they a1·e not supposed to, we suggest that a section of the bleachers be set aside for these lad:-; and they be allowed to see the games free of charge. In ·this way they would be in one section of the stands where theJ 1vould not get into mischief and where they would not make any trouble. At Syracuse University a special section of t1le sb:l.nds is set aside for the boys from the town. They have a cheer leader by their stands and they are loyal Syracuse rooter·s, knowing all the cheers and taking part in them. There doesn~t seem to be any reason why Union can't inaugurate such a. system, since it wouldn't cost anything and it wouldn't decrease the gate · PiOCTOR'S DENNIS KING in The Vagabond King with JEANETTE McDONALD also R-K-0 VAUDEVILLE Three Days Starting Wednesday COHENS AND KELL IN SCOTLAND with_ Charles Murray and George Sidney receipts. ~=~~~~~~==~!~ ~ '~-' R ..

Clarkeson Tuesday, April 29, 1930 SUCCESS For the :first time in the history of track at Union a Garnet team has accomplished the· noteworthy feat of tuTning in a victory at the annual Penn Relays, and capturing the M. A . . S. C. A. A. one-mile rcla.y championship. More than this, the Union relay team clipped almost · three seconds off the previous record for the class in whiCJh they ran. This success proves even more conclusively than the record made during the Indoor Track: season that the Gar- net foursome is one of the greates·t relay teams Union has ever had. The victory in Philadelphia last Friday is a tribute to the exceptional cal- ibre of tl1e four runners, to the coaching ability • of Doc Bruce. It was a victory over some of • the best colleges in Union's class. The con- gratulations o:f 'the entire student body is ex- tended to the fom· men wnho carried the Garnet colors and to the man who directed them.
