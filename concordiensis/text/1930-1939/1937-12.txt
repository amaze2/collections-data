The week of January 24 has been set aside as the eKnm'ination week and all tests will be given ih each classroom by individual instructors.

ARE MID-TERMS NECESSARY? ln 1934-3G and 1935-36 the Union Colleg·e faculty abolished formal mid-term examin- ations as part of the plan for the Intellectual Advancement of Youth. That was a step in ih€ direction such highly-i·espected insti tu- ti()llS as Ila.rvard, Yale and Princeton had taken to put college examinations on a com- pr€llensive scale.

Professor Harold A. Larrabee of the social studies division presents these arguments against the mid- year examination: There is a tendency in the edu- cational system to get away from the recitation or week or semes- ter or even the course subject of study as exempiified in such col- leges as Harvard, Princeton, Swarthmore and Wesleyan. The object is to see the whole student and his growth. Frederic Wyatt will show the mo- tion picture, \George Goes to Union,\ which is a pictorial story of the Freshman year of the aver- age Union student. The group which will represeQ.t the Union un- dergraduates at the dinner will be those men who have received the New York Alumni Scholarships. They are Charles Brockner, '40, John Krull, '40, and James Both- well, '41. Andrew Dryburgh, the Scottish exchange student at Union will also attend. The New York Alumni have been active in recent years, spon- soring the Glee Club concert in New York and holding a smoker in addition to their annual Christmas dinner. Last year the association gave a dinner in honor of Frank Bailey's completion of his thirty- fifth year as the treasurer of the College.

We must realize that uniform- ity is not an end in itself and that it should be subordinated to edu- cational effectiveness.

Edward Schroedel '24, Stanley L. Dr. Levi will discuss \Etruscan Art,\ a subject on which he is a widely recognized authority. Al- though many phases of the world's art have been treated by former Spencer lecturers, he will be the first speaker on Etruscan culture, Dr. Levi has written several arti- cles for the Italian Encyclopaedia, perhaps one of the finest works of its :kind in the world. He has also been a frequent contributor to the journals dealing with art and the antiquities. Tl!e lecture will be illustrated with lantern slides, and will be a rare opportunity for students of art, since Dr. Levi will soon re- turn to Italy, where he is the royal superintendent of antiquities and art. He is in this country under the auspices of the Archaeological In- stitute of America, and began his lecture tour with talk before the MetropDlitan Museum of Art in New York City. Meanwhile, local merchants have expressed some concern over the movement and in communications with the student committee, have inricated a desire to eooperate with the League. Paffrath termed the action of the merchants as one of \nervous in- teJest\ and state·d that a committee composed of John Wold '38, and Preston Reed '38 would meet with the merchants sometime later in the week to discuss their plans. The f01·mation of a similar Lea- gue at Russell Sage is now in the process of developing; Paffrath out- lined his plans ·before a meeting at the Troy institution over the week- end.

Peck R. Deyo What's a loy-al alumnus? What does he mean to th.€ cunent undet·graduate? If we wet·e answering these simple ques- tions from a ti-aditionally naive viewpoint, \Ve should say l1e is one who graduated from our college inculcated with love for alma mater, who always thinks of her financially and acadetnica1ly, and who returns fre- quently for commencements to give the im- pression of being a spirited young or old codger. We associate alumni with pulling wires in the collegiate athletic situation, we think of them as well-stuffed individuals who sus- tain or enlarge the endowment every year, we see them as aloof citizens usually with private interests far-removed from the col- lege, and we know sor:ne of them as good friends who either urged or helped us come to college and wh<> have retained their in- terest in us. Unfortunately the loyal alumnus does not get as much recog:n.ition as he deserves. We students are apt to think ourselves at pl'es- ent the most important body of Union Col- lege. However, we are just as apt to forg€t that the men who have been undergraduates and who are y-et members of this college in a long-time view have made Union Col- lege and with the assistance of the admin- istrative body, eontinue to make it . The example of the New York Alumni Association, one of the many active alumni bodies in the country, meeting this Thurs- day for its 50th annuaJ dinner giv.es us an opportunity to recognize the loyalty of these graduates with.out the dreadful blast of rhetoric about the grand and g.lorious ges- ture.

Only Marie Palmer as the switchboard an gel did any- thin?; resembling acting. The trouble with \No More Peace!\ was lack of adequate di- rection and drilling CJ! the cast.

Lack of adequate rehearsal was evident in all the group num· bC\Js <'Xeept the <'PY seen~. This bit with Laban, and the Tnin, Fat, and Little Men, was the best scene of the show.

One of the most uninteresting parts of teaching work is making up and grading papers, and un- questionably any teacher would be glad to escape that work. But if he does give examinations it is in the best interests of the students and for the fulfillment of the highest purpose of teaching. The fact that some teachers feel that returning to mid-years is not being progressive does not imply that those who return are reac- tionary. Dr. Charles N. Waldron, secre- tary of the college, presented argu- ments against the two principal points made by Professor Larra- bee: Real comprehensive exams for undergraduates are easie1• to talk about than carry out. They might be used in honors courses in a way to justify the name, but I doubt if they do justify the name in the ordinary undergraduate course. If attempted in these courses they should be preceded by a period of intensive reading and study. A uniform time for examinations and marking seems silly when one considers the real nature of an in- dividual's education and the great variety in the methods and con- tents of the courses offered at Union. I am, however, in favor of such examinations and markings only because of the strange thing we call human nature, and the confusion which the wide variety of our wo1·k would create if each group were permitted to go its own way. 1 was more wllling to do this since the nature and length of semester examinations was left to each field of study to determine. This, I believe, works no hardship that was comparable to the con- fusion in this lack of unity. This price I felt we should pay to se- cure administrative unity. As it is, our divisional system provides for an unusual amount of freedom within a small college, and I feel it is well to have some regulations that remind us that we are col- leagues in a common enterprise and not loosely united groups of four tiny colleges. ~opytight 19}7, L!GGlllT & MYERS ToaAcco Co.

Stevenson, editor-in-chief. Although .proper attention will be directed to the literary work of the boek, an attempt will .be made to reproduce life at Union in the manner appr-oved by popular opinion today. Stevenson believes that a yeai\book consisting mainly of good pictures will prove more interesting to the students than the usual ty;pe of Garnet. Pictures will depict the campus, faculty, fraternities, cluibs, teams, and other subjects of interest, ibe- sides the prescribed photographs of the Junior class. The technical work has been as- signed to the Chidnoff Studios of New York, protographers, J'ahn and Oilier Engraving Co., of Chi- cago, Ill.; and the Fol!t Orange Press of Albany.

Henry, in fact, liked this instrument so much that he had 75 recorders of his own. \Drew\ first played this \whistle-headed flute\ about a year ago. \It was a g1·aduat1on from a tin whistle\ he stated. This will be his first public ap- peal·ance with the instrument. .An award of $10 was given Mes- erole fol' winning the spelling con- test in which 24 freshmen partici- pated.

Strong- Opposition In his letter to Dr. Wise this week President Fox declared \it has been the unfaltering doctrine of Union College that any cause should 'have a hearing on our cam- pus no matter how critically it might be received.\ The opposition to Kuhn's coming here has been strong and vociferous from the Jewish societies and the labor unions, a.nd some students have al- ready begun campaigns requesting that Kuhn's appearance here be suppressed. Only in the last six or eight years, through the efforts of serious musicians to reproduce compositions of former times originally and correctly on in- struments of their respective periods lias the recorder Te- sumed any popularity. ----0-- ~- Carroll Announces 'Criminal Code' Cast The east for the coming Mounte- bv.nk,s prgdu~tioP, \Crim!nf!l Code,\ scheduled to appear March 25, 26 and 28, has been announced by Pro- fessor Edward L.

The sltiing team is working out afternoons at Rotterdam. Fifteen men are trying out for the s.,uad artd numerous meets have already been scheduled as well as attend· ance ·at several winter camivals. All men Interested in making the trip to North Creek this weeltend are asked to get in touch with Fred Wyatt or. Jack Bergstrom at the Delta. Upsilon House. All Familiar Words The prizes were contributed by H. L. Baggerly, '94, ·an alumnua of Union College. The contestants represented the two best spellers of each of the 12 divisions into which lhe freshman class was divided in preliminaries of last night's con- test. The contest was unique in that no uncommon words were used, the same word was not given to two contestants, and contestants were not eliminated on their first error. Professots Burges Johnson, Dan- iel Weeks, and Raymond Henick, of the English department, acted as judges for the contest. Dr. Har- rison C. Coffin, chairman of the division of language and literature, assigned the words to the contest- ants. .Among the common words which, m!spelled, eliminated con-· testants were: \accidentally ··omission,\ \possession \furni- ture,\ \raspbert·y \stevedore.\ \The Thinker\ Young Meserole displayed his skill in spelling by remaining standing to the last, after he had misspelled a word for his first en·or early in the contest. He showed ski.! not only in spelling, but also his ability to assume the well nnown pose of the 'thinker' on the .lrst pew in Old Chapel, much to the amusement of the audience. As well as Pl'Ofessor Coffin and the judges, several other members of the faculty were present, includ- ing Frank J. Manheim, Cadman Hislop and Milton M. Enzer. Union Sends Delegation To Model League Session. Six Union students spent last Fliday and Saturday in Syracuse as delegates to the Model League of Nations .which convened at the Maxwell School of Citizenship at Syracuse University, The Union delegation, headed by Charles Honikel '38 and Frank J. Manheim, faculty advisor to the International Relations Club which sent the delegation, also included Vilmar K. Bose '38, Paul Goldberg '38, .Alfred Siegel '38 and William C. Robbins 139. Dr. Norman Padelford, Professor of International Law at the Flet- cher School of Law and Diplomacy, Tufts College, made t~e principal address. He discussed the need for the League to take action in the present.

Frank J. Manheim, faculty ad- visor of the IRC, in announcing to The Concordiensis that Kuhn was coming here declat·ed: \l abhOl' and hate most of the principles fOl' which Mr. Kuhn is said to stand, and I would resent it if anyone were so foolish as to consider my position one of approbation or sym- pathy, and I would resent it if Union College's hospitality should be so constr·ued. \Yet I resent even more, as a student and teacher of social phe- nomena in a country and institu- tion which are dedicated to the liberal principle, the attitude of those who would deny us the dght to investigate as we choose.\ He said further in his announce- ment: ''The liberal college sub- scribes wholeheartedly to this doc- trine (of free speech).

Preceding the meeting, a dinne::- attended by delegates from Russell Sag-e, State 'Teachers College, Wll- li;;uns and R. P.

The Union group included Vii- mar K. Bose '38, Marlin Depp '38 John Cebula '38, Averill Stewart '39 and Robet·t Saaf '39.

If there is no evidence, it is because the deal was well managed. At any rate, deals are \bad\ and \dirty\ and \unfair\, \Ve shouldn't have 'em. That's the 1Lsual opinion. But why not deals-open deals-regular camp.aigning-all the log- rolling we want? First, just what is wrong with deals? Do they make any diffet·ence in the way the college is run'? Of course not. Student gov- ernment at Union is mer€ly an empty term. Second, deals are more fun.. They are so hard ·to arrang-e, that a successful deal is a real triumph in und.ergraduate political ac- tivity. The uncertainty, the excitement, and all attached to deal campaigning lend a zest of speech.\ Besides we've never been partic- ularly swayed by any of the campus speakers before. We l:leern to be having a ·boycott mania on the campus right now. Besides having the anti-Japanese boycott, :,;omeone else has :started an anti anti-Japanese boycott. But then this business has all gotten out of hand. For today on the door in Silliman Hall where the Anti and Anti-anti Japanese boycotts had been tacked, we noticed a new sheet of paper with a number of instructions on it. SIGN YOUR NAME BELOW.

I-lequembourg Friday, Decembet· 10, 1937 WE'LL LIS'rE N, BUT- The arguments ag-ainst Fritz Kuhn's being sponsot·ed by any orga.uization are these: that he is an advocate of doctrines which are unworthy of human consideratio11; that he is a rabble-rouser of the lowest order; that the l'eputation of any organization sponsoring him will be besmirched by con- tact with him; that lle is an unimportant black spot in the spo·tt€d life of American cults and orders. The basis for such arguments comes hom second-hand knowledg-€ of what he believes and why. Objectm's to his appearing here are confusing the man, who may be unim- portant in himself, with- the philosophy he I'epresents. Whether Union College students will find his principles of international and national politics agreeable is something we are not concerned with. We are not going to hear Mr. Kuhn merely to have an opportunity to ag-ree or not to agree '\l'£th him. We are go- ing to attend with all g-ood academic inten- tions of being \enlighte11ed.\ We cannot see the validity in the argu- ments against Mr. Kubn's coming her.e, for they are based principally upon anger, fear, disgust, hatred and simiLar emotions aroused by something which ha.s been described as foul. But in the evalu.ation of history or society nothing has a s\te11ch. In that respect .:\1r. Kuhn's coming here should be viewed as fairly as the perfect journalist is supposed to view the passing- .seen€. Het·e is a.n event. It is not our purpose to consider whether it is bad m· good, but to olJserve it as part of the human lmleid()scope. As Mr. Manheim and Dr. Fox state, VJe, as students, are anxious to learn. We d():n't care a bunch of It's Love I'm Mter is very much what students will meet in 'the world'. This in evidence on Proctor's screen thing we call 'politics' with a mental sneer is the very basis of practical ( m· impractical) government today, So why not encourage campus 'politics'? Fourth, if the political activity were brought into the lig·ht, as it should be, deals and log-rolling- would lose the stigma now attach.ed to them. Open campaig-ning should be encouraged. The student council made a mistake in trying to prevent deals by quick elections. Bring politics inte the open! Legi- timize it I We want deals! Open political campaig-ning would make no difference in student 'government' but \ve'd have a lot more fun and there'd be a lot more interest. Let's make deals. SERVICES The opportunity to serve Union College in all ways (we do not specify whether they be small o1· big ways) is open to almost every student and organization on the campus. We take belated cognizance of the service ren- dered 35 Union students who w.ere afforded an inexpensive round trip to New York by George Alper last month. To discover an opportunity and to execute a plan to benefit, in a substantial martrtel', a good i1Umber of students are praisewo1·thy actions. We also take this opportunity to give the appreciation of a good number of freshmen and upperclassmen fl·om Union and Skid- more to the Mountebanks for its special matinee performance of \.No Mor.e Peace!\ That was a gesture for whi-ch the college will always be thankful. \Everyday in every- way .•• \ TIMID ADMONI'J.'I()NS ON UNGRACEFUL SUBJECTS -1 Classroo-m smoking: ash trays for cigarettes are not pr(}vided by the col- lege.

Wednesday and Th ursda:y nights the Schenectady Light Opera Company presented \Patience\ or \Bunthorne's Bride\ and with brief flashes of gay aban- don proved that anyone can be con- tented with a tulip or a lily. The poseurs of Florentine medie- val aestheticism, as typified by the · so-called poets Bunthorne and Grosvenor, surnamed Reginald and Archibalil, respectively, brought more li:ght to Schenectady than many of the local amateur drama- tic or musical productions ever can. Superior in the choral scenes, equalling almost the D'Oyle Carte Company and with the fine voice ·and diction of Miss Beth Walsh, the Light Opera Company did a re- markably good job. The 'frio ·scene, in which love-forsaken Dragoons, try to imitate the fleshy .and the idyllic poets, was the most expevtly executed, by John Guevin, espe- cially. John Carruthers, except for his Scottish accent and slurring of words, did the outstanding male · vocals. H. A. E. ''Can it be done?~' ... here is the Wi!srtrn Electric answer!

Larra.- bee, professor of philosophy, in a. leading article in the current issue of The Franco-American Review, \Henri de Saint-Simon at Yorlc- town : A French Pl•ophet of Mod- ern Industrialism in America.\ Dr. Lanabee publishes for the fit•st time in English the pt ediction of SaintcSimon, made in 1884, that \Ame1'icans have not yet erected a code of civil laws designed to favor productive labor as much as pof\- sible. The civil laws in force . , . have been brought from England, and were originally framed in th£ interest of the nobility ... from. which it results that the men of the law are still today of a great deal too m_uch importance in Amer- ica ... America is devoured by its lawyers.\ Dr. Larrabee points out that \Sa:int-Simon's diagnosis ... shines forth as almost miraculously ac· cut:ate. Born an aristocrat himself, · and ev.er a leader, though often without followers, Henl'i de Saiat- Simon strove throughout his life to replace an aristocracy of privilege by one of teal competence.\ Dr·. Larrabee's at ticle, which is to form patt of a biography of Saint-Simon upon which he has been at woz·k for several years, traces the tangled web of circum- stances which brought the French publicist to the Battle of York- town, when he was only nineteen, where he commanded a battery. ----0 Mu.ch Controversy Raised As to Kuhn's Coming <Continued from Page 1) our interest are only the limits that man has set to his activities. \There is nothing in this world about which the college student should not be curious, and there is no better place to satisfy this curl osi ty than in the relatively secloistered atmosphere of the ccl- .lege where the student can afford to exercise his t•eason without hav- ing to succumb to the outside irra- tional pressures which are charac- teristic of the world beyond the campus, \We should· welcome Mr. Kuhn here in his capacity as a supple- menter of material to feed our in- tellectual curiosity.

College librarians --- the most beautiful songs of its 'Just Average' Union Student Ranks Higher Than 92% Of 9,500 Tested Report Published Union Chosen for Highest Position in Graph of Test Results Monday, Dec 13-The \just aver- age\ student at Union fared better than 92% of the 9,500 students Iep- resenting 162 college:; throughout the country who took a cooperative test in chemistry, it was announced today by Dt·. Egbert K. Bacon. The test, given last May by the Test Service of the American Council of Education, was taken by the 23 members of Dr. Bacon's Chemistry 2 class. This gwup 1 epresents the Bachelor of Science in Chemist1y students, and is not a select group, but was chosen because it was the group most c<>n- venient to assemble to take the test. The Council p1 epa red a report of Lhe results of the test which was printed in the most recent issue of the Journal of ChE>mical Educa- tion, and included a graph in the report. Although the report is im- personal, seeking to avoid compmi- sons of institutions. a letter from the Council to Dr. Bacon said \You will be interested to know that your college was one selected for the highest position in the graph we recently prepared to in- dicate the t·ange of achievement of American colleges in Chemical performance.\ All the Union students who took the test received a percentage grade of 90<1(. ot· over, whereas only 50% of all the students tested re- ceived this honor grade. On a point basis, with 191 points x·ep- resenting a perfect grade, 56% of the Union students received 142 or hetter, while only 10% of the entire gr·oup receiv.ed this marie Only 3% of the entire group received point grades of 160 or over, while 30% of the Union students attained this score. The letter to Dr. Bacon epito- mized Union's showing in the test in the following manner: \The 'just ave1age' student at Union exceeded 92o/r of all students tested.\ ----o---- Capacity Audiences FHl Xmas Services throughout the country have Daley, '92 and Dr. Fox Ad- type,\ says the late:;t \New complained that the percent- dress Lal'gest Gathering Yorker,\ in an article discuss- Dr. Fox's Statement Fox Defends College's Posi- tion in Open Letter to All Anti-Nazi Gl'Oups age of bock thefts in. the li- ing C\ollege songR. b1aries in their charge has In 50 Years President Fox's statement of \Union's policy and his reply to the p1oLests from the Communist Party r.nd other organizations against the scheduled appearance of Mr. Kuhn tonight follows in a letter to Mr. Ma1 tin: been very high.

Formal protests from organiza- tions in the city assailing Union College for allowing Fritz Kuhn, leader of the German-American Bund and Nazi propagandist, to speak tonight at the Old Chapel were received by President Dixon Ryan Fox who issued an official explanation of the college position as a liberal institution. breeding. Outino Club SkiiF; With Vassar Girls Week-end at North c,~eek Provides Good Time For Both Groups By ,JACK BERGSTROM This past Saturday, with the snap of frost in the air and the prospects for a fine week-end of skiing, eleven menbers of the Union Out- ing Club set out for the cabin at North C1 eek. As the four cars of the group pulled up the long snovv- covet·ed hill to Skiihaben the U. 0. C.ers discovered th11:t eight Vassar gids had already arrive-d and were skiing on the open slopes near the ca.bin. Provisions, then, were hastily tumbledi out of the car into the cabin and the usual struggle with the two stoves begun. Fire was the final 1 esull as the snow thawed out of the chimney and the smoke cleared suff.iciently to allow visibil- ity. Soon both stoves had a rou- ing blaze going, the new Coleman lamp was lit and the curling smoke from the chimney as well as tbe warm glow of lights from the cabin brought the skiiers trooping in -with a great blowing on hands and a stamping of feet to the welcome scene witilin. Supper was polished off by tbe voracious crowd in short order and the group afterwards di- vided, soine to ski by moonlig'ht and the others staying inside, to sing rousing songs- with the accon- pl\-11iment of Hilder Sizer's accor- dion. Later in the evening, the gn.ng set off for a square dance at Minerva and once arrived. en- thusiastically took part in bt>th round and squares until twelve o'clock called a halt. A direct course was then set for the cabin and not lou\ aftel\ everyone had return.ed and settled! down to turn in for tlle night. Fred Wyatt, in usual sty-le, was asleep in half a minute as he spread out his bear robe, curled up in his sleeping bag and said good- night. To F. Michler Bishop, '24, chait·- man of the banquet committee-, was given the credit for conducting the \best meeting in fifty years.\ because the whole program clicked along without anyone having to examine his timepiece to make sure the meeting was not going into the next day. Alumni of all classes were rep- resented. Louis Oppenheim, '75, of Schenectady, represented the oldest class and ten members of the class of 1937, including Ferdinand Helm, Jack Dowling and Ralph Co- hen, were the youngest. Dr. Fox gave a stirring address in which he kindled the pride of the alumni !}resent by telling them of the achievements of Union Col- lege during the past year. George Daley, '92, spo1 ts editD>r of the New York Herald Tribune paid public tribute to the college and to Dr. Fox for having chosen Nelson W. Nitchman, '30, to he varsity football coach. Nitchman has done a superlative job, said M:r, Daley, and analyzed in detail our 1937 football season. In speak- ing of sports in general he urged coaches to \put back the 'foot' in football\ so it would be more in- teresting both to players and spec- tators. He commended in this con- nection the work of Van Ladd with his place lticlcing. Mr. Daley also spoke of the necessity of \being steamed up\ for every game, if a team is to play to its best capacity. Dr. Edgar S. Barney, '84, 1·ose to meet a crisis, when Charles H. Vos- burgh, '96, president of the New York Alumni /1-~>&odation, l!n- nounced that nothing was known <>f how the group was organized in 1888. Dr. Barney told the alumni the exact origins and read from the first meeting's minutes. Frederic A Wyatt, '32, showed the motion picture, \Gemge Goes to Union\ -and commented as he went along. Prominent Radio Advertising Exp::rt Advises Seniors Interested in Field Mr. AI thur Pryor, prominent radio adman, was the guest of Kappa Alpha on Saturday last. Afte;· luncheon an infot mal discus- sion was held during which mem- bers of the Senim· class who are interested in ad vei tising exchanged views with Mr. Pryor. Relating some of his early ex- periences. Mr. Pryor proceeded to the modern phases of his business. Since the depiession it has been necessary to get the good will of the people in the street. Produc- tion is now secondary to procuring- a ready market. Constant surveys furnish the ad ve1 tiser with reliable information on which to base hi<; pl'ogramme_ At present, few college ~tudi'nts are of use to the advertise!· bPcau.se of the wealth of experienced ll'f~n. He advised the members prebent to join some large company which possessed Its own advertising bt anch, and from there to work into a position with a straight ad- vertising company. Pryor feels that the ear is capa- ble of receiving more adult mate- rial than the eye. A person will comprehend far more intricate ad- vertising by means of the radio than by the medium of written material. Radio has progressed so rapi·ily that no advertising man is th·Jr- oughly grounded unless he has had some training· in radio work. Since the producer's market is rapidly becoming saturated with goods, the only means of procuring new ·business is by taking busines& away from some competitor. This situation insures a busy field for advertising throughout depression a,; well as in times of ·prosperity. Those present were: Henry Stephenson, William Mulvey, Jul- ius Bundgus, John C. Nett, H. K. V. Tornp'kins, Edwin Otis, Edward Bal'Iy, Joseph Cafarella, and John Gilmour. \We could not honor our own convictions very highly- if we re- fused to test them f1om time to time by contrary opinion or doc- trine. Naturally, eight hundred young men in a typical American college are fundamentally com- mitted to our traditbnal democ- racy, but they ought at least to give a fair hearing to the other man's a1gument presented by the man him;:;elf. This is what should dis- tinguish the Arne! ica1t college or university from the p1esent aca- demic institutions of Germany, Italy and Russia. We know that many of our friends outside find difficulty in understanding that when a visitor says something on our campus it does not necessarily imply that he has the agreeme-nt of the majority or of a single mem- ber of the College. 'Ve are ccm- mitted only to this liberal attitude. Dr. Fox emphasized that the college was in no way endorsing Mr. Kuhn when it allowed the In- ternational Relations Club to in- vite him to address the students in a meeting closed to the general public. Many VPhement Protests \It faces toward the one extreme position as readily as toward the other, always reserving the right entirely to disbelieve or to believe as reason and experience dictate. When we had a Communist speak at Union last year, you may be assured we had vehement protests from the outside and yet it would seem very silly to study and talk about Communism( and such is certainly necessary to an education in this modern world) and yet re- fuse to listen to a Communist. \The point is raised -by our neigh- bois that Fritz Kuhn has been re- fused halls by several organizations in the city of Schenectady and that Union College, in giving him an audience here, is reproving, or even insulting those organ.izations. We would 'protest' agai!Ult any such interpretation. If an crganization is definitely committed to a certain religious, economic or philosophical viewpoint it is not s11rprising that it should close its gates to one who is diametrically opposed. Certainly they have an unchallengeable rig-ht to restt let theii\ property to the use for which it was intended. Many members of the teaching staff said they would attend in or- der to voice their anti-Nazi po,;i- tion in the fmum following the ad- dress. Individual membet·s of the fac- ulty questioned by The Concordien- sis, felt the college administration is to be commended for its cour- ageous stand in upholding its lib- eral policy of premitting students to hear all sides of public ques- tions. Five heads of teaching field:; also queried, however, refused to make any comment. Typical of formal protests to the Kuhn talk from labor, political, and religious organizations, is the fol- lowing letter from James Ma1tin, secretary of the Communist Party in Schenectady, who wrote: \It is scarcely two months since the people of Schenectady by a wave of protests prevented Kuhn from speaking here after he had been invited by -a local Nazi group. We feel that the part of Dr. Fox <President of the College) in his latest invitation to Kuhn is merely one of misguided liberalism. How- ever, we also feel that to bring Kuhn to address the students of Union College is not a liberal ac- tion, any more that it would be lib- eral to invite AI Capone or Hitler himself, especially in view of the fact that the people of Schenec- tady have already shown their feelings in this matter.\ Peru Professors Seek Farrell Data Dr. Orin J. Farrell, assistant pro- fessor of mathematics, has contrib- uted four articles dealing with \con- formed representations\ to the American Journal of Mathematics and the Bulletin of American Math- ematical Society. Capacity audiences fil!ed the Me- morial Chapel at the third annual Christmas community songest spon- sored by the Union College Chris- tian and the Choir. The organ re- cital broadcast which is usually heard from 4 to o p. m. over short- wave stations W2XAD and W2XAF was extended until 5:30 so that the radio audience might hear all of the progra.m. The crowd oat the eve- niilg community sing was so large that many were unable to get seats. The morning service was given over the Choir with Charles Berger, '38, as soloist, accompanied by Dr. Tidmarsh and Philip Ducherer, '39. Dr. Tldmarsh devoted hl,s a:tter- noon recital to Christmas music and was assisted by the Ch<>i-r.

After all found mates to their hearts' desire, evely- one trouped aver to the gym to dance to the rnusic of Bernie Col- lins, imported from Riley's for the event. The outstanding events of the dance were a series of Paul Joneses, about which the majority of couples were skeptical, and a :few attempts at \sugar-footing\ and \shagging done mainly by a Balti- more boy. Then the entire group wandered over to Spring Street Dorm for a. supper of creamed- chicken. The high light of the eve- ning was Jack Gerzov's being left out of the supper party, entirely uh-intentiom•lly, of course. The Ut- where a few inquisitive freshmen turned on the fire alarm, to the amusement of all except the house mother. Several Union men disappeared after supper, and those who were left took their partners to the In- ter-Class Play Contest, which was won, much to the fresh's disgust, by the juniors. After the plays, the group, except for a few romantic couples, returned to Spring Street Dorm, for a bit of dancing, this time to a victrola. The ride back was uneventful, except for a few heated discussions on the merits and de-merits of the party. Hy Enzer is still trying to figure out why the busses were more crowded returning than going up. /1-nd one sophomore is still trying to figure out why he bothered to jump out a window when he found himself locked in Skidmore Hall at 12:15. And Officer Godfrey probably had moments of worry all night when he saw the very open window. How- ever, everyone seemed to have a good time, especially those who spent the evening at the Worden's ba1·- \Under these special circum- stances I think we would have been at least tactless if we had planned a public meeting for Fritz Kuhn on our campus. We do program scores of lectures and other exer- cises during the academic year, to which the citizens of Schenectady are welcomed and without charge . But this lecture on Tuesday eve- ning is not public; no one will be admitted except stude11ts and mem- bets of the faculty group. Thtee- Some idea of the impot tance of the articles is gathered from the request for reprints which Dr. Far- rell received from Professor Al- fred Rosenblatt, lately professor of mathematics at Cracow, Poland, and now professor of mathematics at University of Mayor de San Marcos, Peru. Professor Rosenblatt, in his let- ter, says the papers are interesting andl the faculty in mathematics \would be very obliged\ if they could have reprints, since the uni- versity's library is \very poor.\ The Chapel was colorfully dec- orated with two large Christmas trees trimmed with colored lights at either side of the chancel. Lighted candles were in each of the win- dows, making a particularly lovely scene at the late afternoon and evening sei\vices. Words for the community carol singing were flashed on the screen and the music was amplilled' over a public address system so that it could be heard all o.ver the cam- pus. ----0·---- Hale ll ouse Holds Di·1wer The Hale Club will carry on hallowed tradition tonight when it holds its annual Christmas dinner at the Hale House at 7 o'clock.

Pellettier Tuesday, December 14, 1937 TWO FATS ON THE BA.CK The place of Union College in academic history is pretty well stated by the re~ort on the number· of alumni listed in the Diction- ary of Arneri.can l3iography. Eighth among all colleges in the country, Union is first among the small colleges. The fallacy in giving ourselves too strong a pat on the back for those statistics is that the dictiotun·y lists principally the alumni who are dead. \V e would not minimize the importance of the Dictionary so far as his- tory is concerned, but we would like to make clear that oar standing of eighth place be- longs to the 19th and not the 20th century. There ~vould be little sense in deluding ourselves with visions of important station in the present academic world. When a dic- tionary is accurately edited of important men in the United States in the past thirty years and Union College ranks eighth we shall have more than sufficient cause to re- joice. We could not be so cold-blooded, however, as to state that Union is to be considered now as a college with a mighty past, an in- significant .present and a possibility of a gTeat future. The results of the national test in fresh- man chemistry given this year in the United States shows that Union ranks first among the 104 different colleges which took the test. Of the 4,532 students who were exam- ined, Uni0n's group of 23 in Dr. Egbert K. Bacon's elementary course was the highest. The lowest Union man was above the med- ian for the entire country. There is something to crow over, and it transpired in our own \insignificant\ pres- ent. We have cause to be proud of those sta- tistics and si1nilar ones from other national tests which have proved that Union is main- taining .a high academic startdhrg in some courses. But we have the evedasting pres- ent to consider-in other words the future.

No giving the college an opportunity to explain man alone ain't got no bloody to upholders of free speech why he should man alone ain't got no bloddy chance.\ be permitted to have free speech. There is no doubt that we are making excuses for having Fritz Kuhn come here, .since we have committed ourselves. But our position, now that we are committed, can be upheld-as it is by D1·. Fox and others. But second, the attitude of the opposition to Kuhn's coming here argues from a less tenable standpoint. Don't give the platform, even the private platform of the classroom, to a degrader of public mo1·als, etc., etc. Sophistry seems to be unusually the wea- pon of the man without a realistic objection. When the Jesuits couldn't give acceptably practical definitions. for some of their sins they relied upon sophistic arguments to prove themselves absolved. The administra- tion of Franklin Roosevelt may be doing the same thing. So might the University of Wisconsin. It seems very probable that such are the attitudes in the debate over Kuhn. Beside this main plot develops an episodic sub-plot involving the wastrel rich of Havana and Miami. They have. Harry Morgan has not. Mr. Hemingway, this novel does not jell. I think you have dragged social conscience into it. I do not think you did so dishonestly; in- deed, you have always seemed to me to be one of the few honest writers living. But consider. In or- der to make the story of Harry Morgan really tragic, in order truly to make him a victim of society, he must fight and fight hard agaiMt · his fate-succumb, only in the end, to inevitable defeat. Precisely in the hopelessness of his fight should lie the force of the novel. Your Harry Morgan doe13 not fight. He does not try to master fate. He merely succumbs. He is a virile in- dividualist who tries to play the game by his own rules, a.nd fails. One can admire him as a Na- poleon, But one cannot pity him as a victim of society.

(1) Skiis-Good quality hickory seems to be the strongest and hardest wood for skiis. However·, ash and even birch are not to be overlooked. For a beginner a flat- top ski is a fair start and will turn out to be the cheapest in the long run. For the novice a shorter ski, say 6' 3\ for an a vet age man is advisable as they are ·easier to con- trol. Short skiis are not as fast as long ones.

Rockmore and Raczowski, regular guards for the 1936-37 varsity, are not on the first team which has Goodrich and Leckonby at forward, Martin Byrnes at center, and Flanag:an and Ohmann at guard. Goodr,ich, Leckonby, and Flanagan are thE sophomores. Good1·ich and ·Flana- gan are small, tough, and speedy; Leckonby is a tall, aggressive player who is an excellent 1'0- triever. Byrnes, of medium height, is shorter than most collegiate centers. St. Lawrence can be ex- pected to play an aggressive, ball- hawking game, reaping dividends from its unusual speed. Nels Nitchman is planning to· use Captain Grant Smith, Johnny Schultz, Dave Miller, George Doyle, and Lou Carr for his start- ing five. Smith and Schultz were regulars last year. Doyle started the season on the first team, but was replaced in mid-season by Dave Miller, who came into his own as a regular· guard. Carr will be playing his first varsity game. It is upon Carr more than anyone else that the success of the Dutch- men rests. The ability of Smith, Schultz, and Miller is known They are highly capable performer-s- even brilliant when their shoot- ing is on the mark. Doyle has no excess natural ability, but has risen to regular rank through his intelligent play and through absorbing Nitchman's teachings. Carr was handicapped by a wrist injury on the cub squad last year, and just what he will do is a matter of conjecture. He has loads of natural ability and may provide the spark which the team seems to need, Rules (Jilanged The St. Lawrence game will be Union's first under the revised basketball rules. The center jump has been abolished this season to eliminate the advantage of the tall center and to speed up the game for the spectator. 'l'he stepped-up pace resulting from the new rul- ing is naturally ll:lore exhausting and makes it a necessity to have a strong reserve squad. Fortunately the Dutchmen are more strongly fortified with substitute strength than in other years. , ,mount importance, for it Is they at deceptive ball handling. Little which guide the skiis.

In general, it is not a very ex.- pel'ienced squad, although the boys seem to like the game, learn fast, have very good basketball sense, and appear to profit by their pre- vious mistakes.

He spoke for about 30 minutes and then opened the meeting to questions but .soon re- tired to let them be answered by William Kunze, Bund's \director of public enlightenment.\ Dr. Wold to Do ~eareh Dr. Peter I.

(Continued on Page 4) Lucku Puert()Rican ChildreJnReceive Gifts Twice During Christmas Seaso,n By :FEIHJIANO GONZALES Christm.as time in Puerto Rico brings happiness for all; men and women, old; and young, rich and poor have equal share in the jfry. All the homes are full of fel'ici ty for the celebration of the tradi- tional feasts. Even in the poorest houses is noticed the ha.ppy spirit whlch ·characterizes the season. Christmas is a blessed time. Ever since Puerto Rico has been a possession of the United States, Santa Claus has become as tradi- tional in my country as here. The children in my parents' tim.e knew nothing or little about the little old man dressed in red. The Puerto Rican c{l.ildren, as in Spain, re- ceived their toys on January !>, the day on which is celebrated the adoration of Christ by the Three Oriental Kings. They awaited with great desire the coming of this, their greatest day, when the three kind kings brought them many beautiful toys. As soQ.n as the Americans arrived at the island, Santa Claus appeared a.s from heaven. :Nowadays, boys and girls. receive toys on December 25 from Santa Claus and on January 6 from the Three Kings. Puerto Rican chil- dren can be called the luckiest in the world, because they receive toys twice during Christma.s. Our music during the time is de- lightful. The carols have much flavor and joy. Our Christmas trou- badours, mostly boys, go from house to house with their merry songs. We have great variety of food during the season: roast pig, tur- key, and pasteles are three delici- ous meat.s. Desserts of all kinds are made. Nuts of different classes are enjoyed. For the drinkers there is abundance of liquors. But among all the feasts of ·Christmas, the happiest for boys and girls is the Three Kings Day on January 6. On this holy day the ·poorest child has in his little hands a toy. Even the older persons feel a rebirth of infancy. Happy Puerto Rican days! Holy Night, Santa Claus, New Year, Three Kings Day. It is a blessed time when God is in all homes,

Friday, l>ecPmbet· 1<, 1!!37 KUHN-19:l7 l\lODEL The all-important question as to whether Union College could maintain its untarnislwcl prestige as a liberal college was second in importance following Ft'itz Kuhn's lecturt> here Tuesday night. Beyond dispute t•nion was liberal, and by the vote taken following the meeting Union studeHts proved that no nasty 1·abble-rouser could sway a group of free-thinking young men. What was even more convincing and prob- ably of more vital importance to the meeting was the obdou~ lack of sincrrit~· in :\Ir. Kuhn. His minister for public enlig:h tenment seemed to personify much l>etter the scom- ful Nazi philosophy. But l\h·. Kuhn vvas as unconvincing a potential threat to democ- racy as a gTocer. lie vvas here to sell wares and his wares are t ho.se in a specific com- mercial field. Playing upon the emotions of immigTant Germans who still retain affec- tion fo1· the Vaterland is a business with Mr. Kuhn,-a racket in other words. As a new kind of racketeer, selling uni- forms, literature, newspapers, jellies and other pres.erves to the German \settlers\ in America, Kuhn is not the threat we have feared. Perhaps his \followet·s\ like the man of enlightenment are the real danger and the real Nazi operatives here. But we gave Kuhn an airing. A COLLEGE TRAINING Probably the most familiar admonitions college undergraduates have heard are those which state that college is the training ground for the future, where the founda- tions are set for the greater eonstructioil of the man.

I admit we follow the national so- cialistic philosophy because it is the salvation of the nation. Russian Gold \In this country, we don't have freedom of the press. If there comes an article about Germany· which is absolutely misleading, we don't have a chance to tell .our side. Today the whole country is trying to be undermined by Soviet Russia. Millions of dollars in gold is coming into this country to make it ripe for revolution. \What we (the ·bund) want is a better relation between Germany. and the United States. Germany needs many things. The United States has a surplus of them. Why shouldn't they be sold to Germany? But the boycott is coming down. Goods can't be shipped into Ger- many.\ The Labor Situation Tnrning to the labor situation in Germany, Kuhn asserted: \Adolph Hitler solved the labor union. (Students laughed loudly) Oh, yes, he did and he had a good reason. (The students laughed again.) In Germany now, every man has his wages. True, the living standard in Germany is lower than in the United States but it is· higher than it was four or five years ago. And in the United States the living standard has gone down in this time. The student audience rumbled with laughter and Kuhn said: \Well maybe you will be inter- ested in something about universi- ties and colleges. Before the war, Germany had 52 universities and colleges. We had too many stu- dents. Today, the number is limit- ed. My university, for instance, can't take more than 4,000 students. They pick out the best ones to go to school. Then they don't ask you where you come from-if your father can't send you, the state sends you.\ Of religious freedom in Germany, Kuhn had this so say: \You have heard you can't go to church over there. That is abso- lutely a lie. You can go to any church you wan to. All kinds of churches are open. A!! Adolph Hitler said was: 'We'll make the politics' so Germany took politics out of the church and the church out of politics.\ Persecution of Jews Of persecution of Jews: \You have heard how Jews are persecuted over there.
