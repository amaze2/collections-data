'Kappa Nu Wins Scholarship Cup for Second Year in Row Eminent Columbia Professor Will Be First Outside Speaker of Year Five Others to Talk City Manager of Rochester Will Be Second In Series The study of government, in most colleges and in most courses a study in theory, and theory only, has taken a different trend in Union this year in a course entitled State and Local Government in practise-the practical side of which will begin in earnest next Monday, October 7, when the first of a group of lecturers, Dr. Lindsay Rogers, will address the students. on problems of the state. The series of 'lectm·es has been planned to bring to the college first- hand observations from men who have had an opportunity to explore the vitals of government-men some of whom have been them- selves an integral part of the vitals. There will be six addresses, which will take place a little more than a month apart in the Old Chapel. First Talk Monday Dr. Lindsay Rogers, who is at present Professor of Public Law at Columbia, will begin his talk at 8:15 next Monday, and will discuss some of the problems of the Public Works Administration as he has seen tr.em. He is a former deputy administrator of the NRA, and was Chairman of the Board of Labor Review in the Public Works Ad- ministration. He has also been a Moreland Commissioner to investi- gate the operation of Workmen's Compensation in New York State. The second lecturer will be Har- old Baker, the City Manager of Rochester, who will talk November 12 on problems· connected with his work as city manager, and who will discuss the city manager plan as ::. whole. Lectlll'e in December Another lecture is planned for December, and three more for the second semester. They will be made by men prominent in the State Gov- ernment in Albany, and probably one of them by a government worlter from New York. The speakers have been obtainPrl through the instrumentation of Dr. Fox and of Dr. Pattetson H. French, Associate Professor of Government, who is teaching the new course in practical administra- tion. Dr. French is personally ask- ing most of the lecturers to come to Union. He worked under Dr. Rogers as Secretary of the Board of Labor Review of the PWA, and has secur~d the eminent adminis- trator for the first speaker in the series. Survey New Cahi!l Site of Outing Club Find Condition of Building Satisfactory; Wood Supply Laid in for Winter Members of the Outing Club made their fin:t trip over the week- end to inspect their newly acquired cabin near 'rhirteenth lake in the Adirondacks, and pronounced it satisfactory after a thorough sur- vey Saturday and Sunday. With all cracks in the walls thoroughly caulked, the club worked all day Sunday with ax and cross-cut saw and succeeded in laying up a supply of more than a cord of wood for heating and cooking pursuits. The cabin, which is to be avail- able to Union students interested in outdoor activities from now until the end of winter, is within short hiking distance of several high mountain peaks, suitable for climb- ing, and is only three miles cross- country from the famous Gore mountain ski runs to which thou- sands of winter sports enthusiasts flock each winter. Situated within one quarter-mile from Thirteenth lake, the cabin is in reach of skat- ing and swimming facilities.

After the meeting has been called to order by president Charles Krull, and the minutes had been read, John Wold '38, of the discipline committee read the freshman rules to the class of '3.9. He claimed that many freshmen disregarded these rules. Freshmen were also ordered by Krull to heed all rules and \to do as upperclassmen told them.\ \We needs must face the fact that our civilization is hardly Christian,\ the Rev.

The actual average of the winner was 8.022, an·d in accordance with the rules of the award, .9 of a unit was added as a bonus for having nine men with an average of 8.5 or better. Delta Upsilon, with a mem- bership of 39 men, the largest on the campus, had an actual average of 7.614, and ten men with averages of 8.5 or over. Alpha Delta Phi, third last year, held the same posi- tion this time, with a cup average of 7.857. Alpha Mn Sigma, Third Alpha.

The first five fraternities listed this year were also first, in the sam.e order, last September. I{appa Nu now has two legs on the Berg Cup. Three are reqt:ftre.d to keep it permanently, and tl1e three must be won in suc<:essiv-e years. The scholastic average for t~e whole student body was 7.362, .3 of a unit lower than last year·.s. ~he average for the 22 fraternities was 7.244, and that of the neutrals 7.50S. The award this year was the thir- teenth of the series started in 1914. The winner of the first award, as well as the second, was the Pyra- mid Club which received: the award in September of the years 1S14 and 1915. Permanent possession of the first cup, won hy the first fraternity to win the cup for three years, was gained by the Delta Phi Fraternity. The best record is that of Delta Chi, then Alpha Gamma Phi, which won the cup 10 times in succession from September 1921 tllrough Feb- ruary 192'7, thereby winning perma- nent possession of three Berg Cups. Phi Sigma Delta was the last to win permanent possession of the cup winning the cup in Se:pteznber 1932. Union Originated the First College 'WarCry' in Coun try-Hikah! Hikah! By VEDDER M.

Unfortunately any matter of science terrifies me. And all I can remember is that when Dr. Tidmarsh's finger touches a key, an electric contact opens a valve which opens a larger valve by pneumatic pressure and that wind from a wind chest rushes into the second valve and makes a par- ticular pipe sound. At the same time, the stop which Dr. Tidmarsh has set prepares a certain set of pipes to function in the event that he should touch certain notes which are contained in that stop. Actually the mechanism operates at right angles. A stop prepares all the pipes of a singular line, and the key sends wind across a certain one of the pipes in that line. The mechanism is awesome and tremendously complicated, and there are four different chambers. There- fore when Mr. Lane is required to tune the instrument or locate some recalcitrant part he literally has to \rlimh into trnuh!P.\ For my own part.

Chalmers was the out- standing man on the field for the afternoon. If he had -been rigged in a Union outfit, we would again have been looking at Ralph Semerad leading the Dutchmen into action. Slippery, elusive, and tricky, he reeled off long run-backs of punts, slid through the Garnet line for substantial gains, and side-stepped his way around the Union opposi- tion continuously. With three minutes left to play, a Kru!I-to-Waldron pass was inter- cepted by Philipson on the forty- yard line where the Black Panthers began their last drive. Resorting to the air they drove the Union team back to the eight-yard stripe where Leete fumbled.

' ., -·.! Four Nitchman Expects Successful Season Average Sized Team Expected To Carry On Previous Recot·d Years The chances that Union may pro- duce an unbeaten athletic team this year have been greatly engendered -by the organization and develop- ment of one of the most impn;ssive- looking freshman football teams the college has :oeen in a long time. Coach Nelson Nitchman, who year·ly is confronted with the diffi- culty of selecting, shaping, and drilling a group of men who have never worked together before, stated in an interview yesterday that he expect:o his freshman eleven to go through a good season, sim- ilar to that of past r·ecord teams. During Nitchman's four years as coach of freshman football only four games have been lost, three of them in one season. In 1933 and 1932 the freshman elevens boasted of undefeated sea,;on,;, each with one tie and three victories. Emboldened by the presence of willing and able grid ml:'n, Nitch- man has organized this year an ag- gre;;si\·e offensive as well a,; hi~ usually stoic defen.-ive team. He is seriously di:;turbed on one point, however. He ha:; no capabJ,. kiclH'I'.

They won three and lost one, upsetting Kent School in the opening game 19 to (}, the first time the Connecticut ,;chou! had been de- feated in three years. In the next year the cubs came through victorious in all but one game, tying Kent School. After that the going was easy for the 1936 team and the othet· game,; were taken over in order. The following year the 1932 formula was repeated, a tie and three victories making up the season's record. One of the out- standing contests was that with the R. P. I. cubs in which the Union men came from behind to take the contest 13 to 7. )..'Ianlius was trounced that year also, 6 to 0. Last season the frosh, greatly hampered by lack of material with small men in the backfield, won one game and lost three. Each of the last three games was lost by one touchdown, the opponents advancing the 'ball in. most cases into Garnet territory .by passes over small Union defense men. Gloversville was defeated in the opening game 6 to 0. Coach Nitchman, whose tech- nique for even a football coach is a bit rigorous. as many people have observed, believes in personal con- teat with hi:; player·s during prac- tice so that he may better analyze, criticize, and correct the faults of his charges. He himself was a mem· ber of thn·e of Cniun's \'lHsity teams, earning letters for several seasons in football, basketball, and baseball, and he has learned the finer fundamentals of coaching through years of study and prac- tice. He applies his methods not only to freshman football but also to \'arslty baskPtball. Last yeat·, in his second term a>< varsity coach of the quintet, he turned out one of the most talked about little college bas- ketball teams in the east. He has big plans in that direction for this winter. Season Opens in Two \\'eelts For the openin~: of the season within two weeks the freshman eleven will probably ·be composed of the stubborn, meduim-sized grid men who have been giving the var- sity so much taste of real football battle. Two small ends, Bill Thomas and Don Henderson, will take care of the wing positions this year. Bob Terhune, 180, and heaviest man on the team, and Sumter Irish will hold down the two tackle positions. At the guard places will be Jim Mulcare and Paul Teare. Wally Baker, hausky and aggressive cen- ter, will do the passing from the center. In the backfield Nitchman will have John Maxwell of Hartfor·d, Conn.; Jake Amazon. former Mont Pleasant grid star; Bruno Czech of Amsterdam; and. Louis Comenzo of Bridgeport. The punting, which has been something of a handicap to the otherwise well-fitted team, will devolve upon either Maxwell. Comenzo or Raymond Lewis, sub- stitute .back. The reserves for the freshmen men are Douglas Stevenson guard, Art Grant tackle, Walt Maines tackle, Doug Murphy end, Bob Gar- nett back, Diclt Burrell back, Gene Coppola guard, AI Garfinkel center, Leo Dwyer end, Fred Came back, Gordon Morse end, Dick Masterson guard, and Walt and Bill Burke backs.

The cast of 11, which will fill t-he 40 or so part in the play, will man- age these parts in the order as they appear without much difficulty. In the original eight people assumed all the characters in the play. In announcing the production of \King Cambyses\ Mr. Carroll stated that \in such an experiment two ideas are in view. First, to act through a .play in as nearly as pos- sible the same manner as it might first have been ·produced, and in the same spirit. Secondly, to prove that actors. holding the script in their hands, by an intelligent reading of the part. may create an illusion of reality in the minds of those to whom they are read. \For this purpose the actors have selected a rudimentary approxima- tion of costume and setting. When 'King Cambyses' was originally pre- sented, realism, undoubtedly was stressed. When Murder, an allegor- ical figure entering 'with bloody hands.' kills Lord Semides 'a bag of vinegar is prick't.' Tonight, a rub- ber balloon containing red paint will be squeezed against a white shirt front. And blood will be seen to flow. \On the other hand, a certain sym- bolic interpretation must take the place of realism in a production which has not money to spend. The rustic character of Hob, will be known by his accent, movements, and the straw in his cap; Cupid, by his blindfold and his bow; and the prostitute, Meretrix, by her seduc- tive wig and her red gown.\ The cast is as follows: David Becker '36, William B. Myers '37, Robert Shreve '36, Wallace T. Foote '36, Hugh H. Sharp '37, John B. Dowling '37, Ferdinand Helm jr., '37, John B. Emans '36, Carlton Gar- rison '37, S.

CAZETTE Engraving PRE:SS Binding Survey New Cabin Site of Outing Club (Continued from Page 1) two story building will easily ac- commodate fifteen to eighteen bunks and more if nece,;sary. After trawling throup-h n. dnmp rain to their destination Saturday afternoon the group found the weather in the vicinity of North Creek and North River where the cabin is situa-ted, ah·eady assuming the cold autumn conditions and with foliage already turned color, giving a red and green mottled ap- pearance. An appetizing dinne1 cooked on the kitchen wood stove, however, was eagerly devoured by the entire group. The stoves down- stairs provided warmth inside and several lterosene lamps were se- cured for reading. The Adirondack night proved much colder than that to which Union students are accus- tomed in Schenectady, but the party was adequately prepared with blankets. After a hearty bacon and egg breakfast before which some of the members had taken walks to look over the neighborhood of the cabin, the group went to work in the wood lot on some trees, trimming off the branches, sawing them up, trans- porting them to the back yard of the cabin and splitting them up ready for the stoves. By the time the job was finished in the middle of the afternoon, all of the party felt they had had plenty of good healthful outdoor exercise. The week-end trip waP without a mishap except for the fact that Jack Bergstrom, '37, sustained a dangerous gash in the knee and had to be taken to the doctor ten miles away in North Creek for treatment. In the future, however. the club will have on hand a special first aid kit for any accidents that may occur. For Your Dates!

As yet, no attempts ha:Ve been mdae to storm the last stt onghold of the bees at the top of the stump to get the remain• uer of the honeycomb. Social Problems Forum. Endorses Charter League· Vigorous Conflict Hobart Fresh from Their 52~0 Victory Over Holbrook, Primed for Garnet First Game in 1896 Dutchmen Have Encountered Orange and Purple In 26 Contests By HYMAN A. ENZER Almost evenly m:J.tciled physically, the Cnion ..tnd Hobart elevens will meet in a long-awaited football bat- tle tomorrow afternoon at 2 o'cluck on Alexander Field. It will be the first home game for the Dutchmen thb ::;ea::;on, and the 27th they have played against an Orange and Pur- ple team. Dr. Dixon Ryan Fox, re-elected president of the association for a fifth term, reported that since Aug- ust he has been at work in dtaw- ing up a committee in each county of the state to facilitate this work as soon as funds, estimated at $500,- 000, are available. The Social Problems Forum at its first meeting Tuesday evening. unanimously resolved to support Professor Earl E. Cummins and the entire Charter League ticket for city council positions. The group took this stand since it believes that the platform of the Charter League offers the best solution of pressing local problems.

There will, undoubtedly, be a con- flict tomorrow. Fox: on Theatre The first day's program was eli· maxed by the address of Dr. Fox, whose paper fitted perfectly with the setting of the Lake Mohonk Mountain House, in the heart of the \Rip Van Winkle\ country. He traced the development of the theatre in America and used the unusually long run of \Rip\ with Joseph Jefferson's company for 20 years, as an indication of the vital- ,ty of the American stage. Dr. Fox said that the increasing attention given recently to the development of a national theatre, through Con- gressional charter, and the even more recent ~3,000,000 WPA Thea- tre project placed under the direc- tion of Hallie Flanigan, indicated that the \golden age\ of the Amer- ican theatre is ahead of us. Professor Frederick L. Bronner, 1 ecently appointed acting librarian of the college, contributed a three· dimensional portrait of Marin us. Willet, the stormy soldier of the Sons of Liberty whose heroic Revo- lutionary service was capped by hiE inct·easingly conservative views as a. \party man\ in politics. His in- tiuence was nevertheless far-reach- ing as sheriff of New York for eight years, arbiter between Amet· ica and the Carolina Creek Indians, then as the patronage dispensing mayor of New York, and finally as one of the founders of New York's Tammany organization.

Outcome of Game to Decide Duration of Freshmen Rules Next Semester Methods of controlling student use of the newly acquired cabin at Notth Creek were discussed by the Executive Committee of the College Outing Club Tuesday night, ahd de- finite rules and regulations were decided upon. These rules are to be kept posted in the cabin. \The regimes of the past proved an utter failure\ it was declared, in regard to science in government. \Our only possibility of acquiring government for the people by the people is through electing a body of officials who make the problem of government a science, not a busi- ness.\ With this in vtew the forum therefore resolved to advocate heartily such candidates as are known to be scientific students of government. The college plans to redecorate all the classrooms and offices. Weather-stripping around all the windows and doors will be com- pleted and a thermostat in- stalled to assure better heat regulation. Rearrangement of electrical fixtures has been sug- gested but will not be completed until a later date. About three weeks will be required to com- plete the painting. Men are also working on the drain on lhe athletic field and new connections will be made to keep the cinder track as dry as posible. A freshman-sophomore football gamegame one week after the ter- mination of the varsity schedule, and a recommendation that fresh- m'i.n hats be sold hereafter ·by the College Bookstore at cost, were the results which the machinery of gov- ernment ground out Wednesday night at a meeting of the Student Council. Adopted Regulations Please leave cabin in first- class condition. Pay particular attention to the disposal of refuse and putting out fires. Remember the structure and equipment are rented. Do not abuse the same. The owners have requested that the mattress covers be left intact. The use of ail intoxicants and firearms is prohibited. First Game in 1896 Hobart College first played Union in 1896, and of the 26 games played during the 39 year football series, Union has won 16, Hobart 9, and one game was tied. Under Coach G. Elliott Hatfield, Union defeated Hobart in three out of four games. During the four or five years of the depression the grid teams turn- Dr. Rogers, PWA Administrator, To Discuss 'Doubts, However Reasonable' The new arrangement for the sale of freshman caps is intended to prevent misunderstandings bet ween local shopkeepers and the student body and to reduce the price for future freshmen by abolishing all middlemen. Under this system it will be impossible for individu'i.l students to handle contracts or ac- cept cuts from outside dealers. The freshman-sophomore football game, divised to replace the tradi- tional inter-class fights, was sug- gested last year, but failed to ma- teri'l:lize. According to pt·esent plans, the yearlings will be exempt- ed from all freshman regulations the Monday following fraternity initiations if they win this game. If the sophomores should defeat them, these rules will remain In force until Moving-Up Day. As the fire hazard is great, pay particular attention to the disposal of smoking facilities and kill all signs of fire before leaving the premises. A complete first aid equip- ment is at the cabin for emer- gency use. . ed out in Geneva failed dismally to dispel a tantalizing jinx:, well known as \the losing streak.\ But if the economic slump can be judged by the Hobart football team, then the depression is actually over. Coach \Speed\ Wilson took charge of the Orange and Purple grid squad last year and managed to break a long, unlucky chain of events. He seems to have pulled his team, still further out of the mire this fall, and is edging it on the ·road to swift recovery. &·------------------------------- Chairman of Board of Labor 1 Review Will Open Lectures On Practical Government Students will have their first op- portunity to listen to the newly in- stituted course of lectures on \Pub- lic Administration\ Monday night at 8:15 in Old Chapel when Dr. Lindsay Rogers, professor of public law at Columbia University, and chairman of the Board of Labor Review of the Public Works Ad- ministration will speak on the topic \Doubts However Reasonable\. Dr. Rogers was also former deputy ad- ministrator of the NRA, and More- land C'ommissioner to study the operation of the workmen's com- pensation law in the State of New York. In this lecture he will dis- cuss some of the problems of the Public Works Administration as he has seen them. This lecture will constitute one of the six which will be given as part of the courses in government in- augurated this year under the direc- tion of Dr. Patterson H. French, associate professor of government, and Dr. Douglas Campbell, assis- tant professor of government. D•r. B'rench, instrumental in bringing Dr. Rogers to lecture at the college, worked under him as secretary of the board of labor review of the PWA. Besides the forthcoming lecture by Pt ofessor Rogers, there will be one later in the year by Harold Baker, city manager of Rochester, who will discuss the work of city managers with reference to his own experience. These two addresses will be followed by four others, the object of which will be to give stu- dents an opp01tunity to hear men active in the field of government and politics. The series of lectures will place special emphasis on state and local government. Dr. French head of the courses in government is arranging with leaders in the ad- ministrative and. legislative work in DR. LINDSAY ROGERS Albany for their appearance at Union College. The addition of practical courses in government was a result of a new movement started last year by Dr. Dixon Ryan Fox in order to give better preparation to men ex- pecting to enter the field of politics and government. Last year, some of the prominent men brought to the campus to lecture on these topics were Comptroller Joseph M. McGoldriclt of New York city, Gov- ernor Wilbur Cross of Connecticut, and Rexford G. Tugwell, prominent New Dealer. The program of government courses calls not only for study .in theory, but also for an acquam- tance with the practical sides, for it calls for the more qualified stu- dents to serve an \internship\ In the various branches of state and local government during the sum- mer months. The two teams will be coached by varsity men. VanAntwern W'i.ldron '36 handling the sophomores, and Chatles Krull '36 assisting the freshmen. Other members of the varsity squad, including Richard Woodruff '36 and Joseph Milano '36, will also instruct the two teams. Keys are in the hands of North, Williams and Wyatt. Members are not to visit the cabin unless accompanied by one of these three. Robert North '36, Wall Williams '36, and Robert Symonds '38, were apponted official representatives of the club at a conservation meeting to be held tonight in the state office building in Albany.. Plans were also completed to have members of the club meet Sunday morning at 8:30 at the Blue Gate to go to Rotter- dam to work on the Ski trails of the Schenectady Wintersports Club. Union's football team has follow- ed no such economic analogy. Under Coach Hatfield's four year term the Dutchmen have played 31 games, won 15, lost 12, and tied four. The Union teams have piled up in these last few years 332 points to its opponents' 297. There was no depression in football for Union. Circumstances have caused some difficulties· in the home camp this week. Although Coach Hatfield <Continued on Page 4) 'King Cambysses 'Features Blood ancl Thunder With Cooperative Audience When plans for this game had been discussed, the Sophomore Dis- cipline Committee reported th!J.t many freshmen were disobeying rules and asked that some stringent means of enforcment be estab- lished.

Simple scenery and cos- tumes were in keeping with the in- formality of the production. Be- tween the cheers, boobs, and hisses of the audience, one could faintly discern a really serious attempt at acting in the style the type of play required. To us who were, of course, unacquainted with what a 16th century play presentation should be like, the affair was a bur- lesque melodrama. Giving all due credit to Mr. Carroll and the cast, they seemed as if they were trying hard to please the audience. And after all, that is what counts in any play. The cast included John Emans, Robert Shreve, Wallace Foote, David Becker '36; and John Dow- ling, Frederick Frost, Ferdinand Helm, William Myer, Carlton Garri- son, Ralph Cohen, Tony Sharpe '37.

Hartmann Friday, October 4, 1935 REVIVING THE RIVALRY Apparently the idea of having some sort of contest between the freshmen and sopho- mores for the amusement of the upperclass- men is too deeply engTained in the minds of the Student Council to be completely dis- carded. In spite of the fact that there have been no organized sc1·aps and little sporadic haz- ing for the last two years, the Council has decided to revive the ancient rivalry by staging a football game between the first and second-year men the week after the var- sity football season ends. The success of this project depends upon a number of unpredictable factors: the weather in particular. A post-season game is often more comfortable to play in than to watch, if one discounts the hardness of the g-round. It is also necessary for the players to be sufficiently conditioned to avoid injur- ies; this, of course depends upon the ability of the volunteer coaches, and on the willing- ness of the teams to practice. It seems to us that an inter-class football g·ame is no more necessary or desirable than the old paint-throwing parties. But if enough interest and enthusiasm can be worked up in the game, among the underclassmen, its con- tinuance as a yearly contest will be justified.

The remaining solution is to rebuild the college around it, 011 the Russian plan that features industrial Rrt. Bailey Hall could be remodelled to look like a po·wer station, the gymnasium altered to fit the specifications of an airplane hang-at·, and Washburn Hall fitted out like a locomotive roundhouse. We could have monkey wrench murals and cog wheels painted on the chapel ceiling-. If the administration is opposed to these suggestions, couldn't a pipe line be run from the tank into the cellar of Washburn Hall? The pump ·could then be set up inside with a long enough hose to reach trucks outsid.e? That would be an easy and happy com- promise. \Lady Tubbs\ at the State This is another rag-s to riches story which the movies take great delight in spring every now and then but in this case the attempt is justified. Alice Brady, as the camp cook for a railroad gang, who sud- denly acquires wealth, a title, cul- ture and background all in a breath-taltingly short time, does a nice little characterization with a minimum of trouble.

In fact, not content with being a double threat she played a double part. The story was too .clever for its writers by far. The idea was good but the dialogue and develop- ment were rather turgid. In the scenes during which Miss Page was required to converse with herself we were treated to some of the worst direction that has graced the local screen lately. The process which is known as a transparency shot is never entirely satisfactory but in this picture, Miss· Page sang some vile songs and the dubbing in of her voice whether it -was hers• or not was just plain l<msy.

There has long been I I need of a good statue. H ·would be ev.ery I No-w Showing I whit as imposing as that of Nathan Hale at 1.,!;===========..!.1 Harvard. The next best solution is to consign it to tradition und hold a class paint fight similar to that which made the Idol useful. The change of color from day to day would en- liven interest and serve as fraternity tal>le- talk. And after a dozen years' paint had col- lected, we would have a figure indistinguish- able feom the Idol. We have always under- stood that the Chinese keep those unsightly shapes in pairs, anyway. The remaining solution is to rebuild the college around it, on the Russian plan that features industrial art. Bailey Hall could be remodelled to look like a power station, the gymnasium altered to fit the specifications of an airplane hang-ar, and Washburn Hall fitted out like a lo-comotive roundhouse, We could have monkey wreneh murals and cog wheels painted on the chapel ceiling. If the administration is opposed to these suggestions, couldn't a pipe line be run from the tank into the cellar of Washburn Hall? The pump could then be set up inside with a long enough hose to reach trucks outside? That would be an easy and happy corn- promise. LErS HAVE A DECISION The Student Council has \1·econunended\ that freshman cap·s be sold by the college bookstore. To whom or to what are they making· this recommendation? The constitution gives the council the power to regulate freshman rules. If anyone has jurisdiction ()Ver the caps it is the Stu- dent Council. Now that they have recom- mended a policy to themselves, perhaps they will ratify it at the next meeting-. \Lady Tublls\ at the State This is another rags to riches story which tlle movies take great delight in sprl11g every now and then but in. tills case the attempt is justified. AJice Brady, as the camp cook for a taih~:>ad gang, who sud- denly acquires wealth, a title, cul- ture and .ba.clcground all in a . breath-taitiDgl::y short time, does a nice little charaderization with a minimum <lf trouble. Alan Mow- . braw as the !DJpeccable English · lord is a perfect foil for la Brady's eccentricities. T. S. '* • • \Manhattan ·1\I:Oil':II\ Also at the State an ineffectual bit called '\Manluttan Moon\ with Ricardo Cortez and a newcomer, · Dorothy Page •. who acts and sings. In fact, nC>'t co11i:ent with being a double threat shE played a double . part. The story -was too clever for its writers by- far. The idea was good but the dialogue and develop- ment were ra.ther turgid. In the scenes during -wiUch Miss Page was required to c<>nverse with herself we were trea,_teli to some of the worst direction that has graced the local screen lately-. The process which is known as a transparency shot is never e11tire!y satisfactory but in this pic'tur-e, Miss Page sang some vile song:s and the dubbing in of her voice w11ether it was hers• or not was just plaill lousy. It's hard to say why tiUs --was featured over \Lady Tubl>s:\ J. B. D. Proctor's \Diamond Jiln\ is a swell show. The writing- is :swell. So are the set- tings and the liirection. Edward Arnold is· a swell actor; so is Binnie Barnes in the otltet• gender. In fact except for tl!e va~dev!lle, we had a swell time a.t Proct()r's. Coming Eventually In Albany \We saw \Broadway Melody of 1935\. 'l'he story Js old stuff. The m\Usic is 1nostly just stuff. Eleanor Povter-s is -very entertain- ing. But in spit~ of her extremely- competent hoofing we felt that the melody would s:oll:tld just as well on a comb and dis·hpan. F. H.

And they were hurrying off to get * * * God when Mr. .Achilles said, \Sto'p!\ and his eyes fairly glistened.

The reason is that And then with that lte swung the 'no smoking' sign And got Mr. Enzer square on the head and since Mr. Enzer was a ghost he was neatly divided in two. But did he repine? Not he! He was not <Jne to be put on the shelf. He arose in his doubled. might and started arguing with himself! F. H. Farley is spending the money. Not one unemployed man was given. the job of administering the youth funds in any state. In each case a man who already had a job was chosen. For example, the man in charge of the Youth Administiation in New Jersey receives $4,000 for a state job and now receives $5,000 more for the job mentioned. One man drawing $9,00() when .two men might have substantial incomes.

Dick Woodruff, forceful little var- sity quarter.J>ack, was hurt in the practice scrimmage with the f.resh- man Wednesday, and will be unable to play in tll.e contest. The joh of signal calling will t·herefore devolve upon Captain Charles Krull.

The Hol>art squad has continued its rigorous tr.ainlng drills this weelr, preparing a defense for the expected Un.ion attack. Likewise the Dutchmen have been devoting their time to defense tactics intend- ed to offset the Hobart offensive. The varsity .coach of the Hohart squad is taking many precautions for his team's fii·st real •test tomor- row. With a squad composed main- ly of the .members of last year's un- defeated freshman ·eleven and num- erous. veterans, Coach Wilson has not suffered' from a lack of reserve material. His varsity eleven now is composed of a majority of SOJ>ho- mores, all of :whom have given in- dication that they deserve regular berths.

The Starting Lineups Coach Hatfield will have for his starting tean most of the men who did so well in the Middlebury con- test. Captain. Krull, calling signals, throwing the passes, doing some of the kicking and ball carrying, will have a big assignment tomorrow when he captain.s the team from the vital quarterback .position. Ernie Brown., who does m.ost of the ground gaining on running plays, will fill the fullback position. Greu- lick, playing in the left halfback position, and either .Jack Smith, Emery Burton, or Wally Hughes, starting in the right half, will com- pose the rest of the backfield. The Garnet lin.e will remain the same for the most part, with some doubt only as to whether Frank Gatchell or Jack Sloatman will start in the left tackle place. Van Waldron, lanky pass receiver, and Jim Marotta, fast an.d aggressive lineman, will take care of the wings. Joe N.lilano, Stu Irvine, Vince Smith, and Homer Swart will be re- serves for the end posts. .At the right tackle will be Jack Kearns, letterman from 193<1 who has re- gained his former aggressiveness to secure a regular place on the team. F. Van Ladd, a sophomore, .Art Bullard, and Newton Ritchey will be ready for- the call to play one of the tackles. Bill Potts and .Jim Riggs, both of whom seem pretty well :fix.ed f()-r the starting places on the line, -will again. play at guard. Reserves for their places are Fran- cis .Agostini, Duke Fenton, and Burns Barford. Paul Campbell, do- ing well tllls fall in the center posi- tion, will start in his favorite place. Hobart;'s Strong Ofiense The Oran.ge and Furple, assisted materially by the j}resence of a sophomot·e :named 'Wright and vet- eran King in the bacidleld, will pre- sent a formidable offensive to the Dutchmen.

With the rise of these two, four other touch squads have been elimi- nated from further play in the first round. By veason of two losses apiece, the South College, Beta Theta Pi, Delta Chi and Theta Delt teams are automatically disquali- fied from competition until the sec- ond round of action. In Wednesday's games, Sigma Chi defeated Beta Theta Pi 6 to 0, Phi Sigma Delta outscored South Col- lege 12 to 6, while Delta Upsilon and Alpha Delta Phi took forfeits from. Delta Chi and Theta Delta Chi respectively. .All games played so far have been won by rather narrow margins, with the ex.ception of the Phi Gamm's rout of Kappa .Alpha on Wednesday to th~ tune of 23 to 0. Guy Griswold's accurate pass-ing was an outstanding factor in the easy victory. Phi Gamma Delta heads the list in scoring with 23 points acquired in one gaine, while Psi Upsilon pro- vides somewhat of a novelty in be- ing undefeated, and yet having scored but two points.

Four Varsity Gridders To Coach Frosh, So phs First Football Game Between Two Classes to Be Held In Recent 'fintes What members o.f the varsity football team can do as .players and what they can do as coaches of football players will be tested to some extent this season, during and after the varsity schedule. An in- tramural football program, unique in any college in leCdJ.t tilnteci, ha:; been formulated by the Student Council and the football coaching staff and sanctioned by President Fox whereby a sophomore-fresh- man footba>ll game will be held at the conclusion of the grid season. Unlike the other intramm·al com- petitions, the planned contest will involve not only two classes or groups but a complete representa- tive body of the college in that the two teams will be coached by mem- bers of the varsity football team under the supervision of Coaches G. Elliott Hatfield and Arthur C. Lawrence. The proposed contest is the out- come of the most popular sugges- tion last year in the strife over in- terclass scraps. The proposal was carried over from a me1•e class fray into something of all-round college interest. Laboratory Course By use of students as coaches of the respective teams, the contest becomes more than an ordinary affair, for it is really a \labo1·atory course'' in football coaching. Each man on the staff of either the fresh- man or sophomore group will be re- ceiving valuable experience as a coach. The eligibility of the sophomores is not limited except that no var- sity squad men may play in the intramural game. The freshmen likewise are not limited except that the first 15 men on Coach Nelson Nitchman's squad may not partici- pate in the contest. The others now on the squad are eligible fm posi- tions on the team that will be or- ganized. Captain Charles :Krull and Van Antwerp Waldron, senior members of the varsity team, have been chosen to coach the two teams. Krull elected to direct the fresh- man group, and Waldron the sopho- mores. For his coaching staff Wald- ron chose the following lettermen: Phillip Little, Frank Gatchell, Dick Woodruff and Bob Barton. Krull chose for his asssitants lettermen Ernie Brown, Bill Potts, Jack Kearns and Paul Campbell. With the exception of the supervision of Mr. Hatfield and Mr. Lawrence, the coaching job will be left completely to Waldron and Krull and their aides.

Clowe Colds are not \caught\ but are \handed out\ said Dr. G. M. Clowe, college physician and membe1; of the class of 1911, in chapel. yester- day morning. People who live among themselves ~eldom have colds until they are introduced from outside sources, he continued, in considering the possibilities of in- fection. Describing the common cold as a viru:> infection not ~pccifically known, Dr. Clowe stated that an incubation period of a day or more elap::h!o bdor~ lh\ int.,cliun wha.:h is \handed out\ becomes the annoy- ing irritation in the uppe1· retipit·a- tory tract which accompanies the other initial symptoms of a cold. Although there are advocates of exercise, alkalies and fruit juices as treatment for colds, Dr. Clough con- siders that the maintenance of a good physical condition is the prime essential for cure. Plenty of sleep, good food and the a voidance of any undue exposure are the main .points in keeping resistance high accord- ing to the speaker, who also advo- cated the increased consumption of fluids to aid elimination.

Because he had experienced difficulty in bucking the wind on his bicycle, he decided to leave it in York, and proceed to London by hitch-hik- ing. This method of travel, so pre- valent in the States, is pr'actically unheard of in England, as nearly everyone hikes or rides bicycles. Haskell found, however, that he had no difficulty in securing rides, and that those who picked him up were more hospitable than auto- mobilists in this country, as they went out of their way to accom- odate him. \Two branches of our tri-cameral Legislature are elected for fiXed terms.

Arriving in Liverpool at the end of August, Haskell took a train to St. An- drew's, and after having settled his belongings, started the process of fitting himself out for a bicycle tour to the south of England. Car- rying only a knapsack, a blanket roll and a trench coat he started out and stopped fil'st in Edinbor- ough. Here, as in most places he came to on this trip, he stayed at a Youth's Hostel. These hostels, to which there is nothing comparable in the United States, are situated throughout England and Scotland in towns of the greatest interest and importance, usually only a day's walking distance apart. They were established some ten years ago for the convenience of those who desire a clean bed, with good food, at a very low cost. Each hostel has a girl's and a boy's dor- mitory where one may get three blankets and a cot for a shilling. Each guest washes his own dishes, and makes his own bPd. After three days of sightseeing in London, he went to Oxford, and went through the famous colleges there, leaving the fourth day for Stratford-on-Avon, the birthplace of William Shakespeare. There he witnessed a performance of the \Merry Wives of \Vindsor\ and de- parted the next moming for York again. On his way he passed through Coventry, Warwick, Lei- cester, and Nottingham-the indus- trial section of England. Upon reaching York, he decided to send his bicycle back to St. Andrews by train, and hitch-hilce the rest of the way him.«elf. His extraordin- ary lurk in gE'tting ridfs hPld, nnd he was soon in Edinborough again. As he had little time left, he did not stop there long, but pushed on, through Glasgow, arrivil'lg back at St. Andrew's in the last week of September.

Tuesdar, October 8, 1935 THE CONSTITUTION ON THE CARPET According to the analysis of Dr. Lindsay .:Rogers the constitution of the United States -will not provide a fertile battle ground for ihe political parties in the forthcoming presi- -<!e11tial election of 1936. The Tiepublicans ••can't beat the 'to1n-tom' and the Democmts -ea n't frame any new amendments\. The beating of the \tom-tom\ is utterly :ne-edless. Even were a chang.e of administra- ti()ll to advocate new legislation, reactionery ~r radical, the fundamental structure of the cconstitution is of such a nature that this leg- islation would have to be passed upon by a t:ri btt11al of nine Supreme Court judges before it could become effective. The proposal and passing of new amendments is likewise super- :ffluous, for the judicial opinions of the Su- preme Com·t are en,g·endered by the acclaim m disapproval of a particular statute. The Jlussage of an amendment to sanction the :r;u:omulgation of social legislation would be unnecessary in the light of the Supreme Court's invalidation of the National Indus- trial Recovery Act. Since the Supreme Court apparently as- s;umes the position of Jehovah Almighty '?'Vh.at need have the hoi-polloi to base their p.11e_sidential campaig-ns upon the issue of in- I.21libility of the courtligious adherence to the c-onstitution? Would it not be more sagacious L() question the infallil>ility of the Court? NOTHING FOR SOMETHING There is an old American custom which has become pretty generally accepted: that people should get what they pay for. Mem- bers of Union's football squad, through the student tax, pay for reserved seats at all home games, and they get no return. Admit- tedly, they do have fine seats on the bench, plus the glorious opportunity to do or die for the old Alma Mater on the field, but they pay a great deal more than $1.65 for that privil- ege. The sacrifice in time and effort which they must expend does not have to be related he1·e. a finished actor and as such makes dropped- gracefully through the What Is there to request?

The athletic department probably gets a substantial amount of money from the resale of these seats, often selling them to the play- er's parents and friends who come because of a personal interest in the men who have al- ready purchased seats which are not given to them.

D. 1823 The first American rules were patterned after soccer. Only kick- ing was allowed, six goals constitu- ting a game. Posts were set 25 feet apart, with 25 men on a team. Princeton and Rutgers carried on kicking contests for a few years and even reached the point where they incorporated the rules of the game and called it \Association Football\. Fall Lacl'osse Practices Al'e Held on Library Field Fred Wyatt and other lacrosse e.nth';lsiast~ at the college are get- tmg m therr annual licks in the fall practice of the famous American sport. A large squad of varsity and former freshman players, as well as the usual large turnout of fresh- men has made the Library field once more the scene of swinging slicks and flying balls. Those who are out brushing up on fundamentals and loosening some of the kinks are: Alan Hor- witz, Dietrich Pause, Victor Korcy- cinski, Don Hill, I3ill Matthews Robert Slatterly, Carl Coleman, Jo~ Paul, Henry Clay, George Heart Merlin Fay, Luman Fuller, Ke~ MacMurray, Bill Reynolds, Dick ~ennedy, Hal Vandecar, Ken Tomp- kms, Sam Farr, Ray Robinson, Art Lawrence, Jack Nott, August Lau- renski, Severn Hasbrouck, Jack Coleman, Bud Friehofer Varsity Captain Hugo Bergman, Herb Zuhr Bog Seigel, W.

President White of Cornell healing of the impending game forbid hls students to talm part and issued the classic statement, \I will not permit thirty men to travel 400 miles merely to agitate a ba.g of wind.\ Harvard organized in 1874, intend- ing to join Princeton and Yale in Association Football. They were challenged by McGill University however, to a game of Rugby Foot~ ball, the game ending in a scoreless tie, Harvard then challenged Yale to a Rugby game the next year and won 4 to 0. The \Big Three\ liked the new game so well that the Association was discarded and the American Intercollegiate Football Association was formed. Reluctant to discard the kicking features of Association football, touchdowns were to count but one point, while a kicked goal was to be superior to 4 touchdowns. If Hat•vard had not accepted Mc- Gill's cllallenge it is entirely pos- sible that football today would be merely FOOTball.

The import'l.nt .point is that when Presi- dent Roosevelt took office. in the spring of 1933, the economic and spiz·itual condition of the country was. vastly wm·se than it had been In the summer of 1932. It was his business to improve that condition, and we should appraise policies not only, or eve npz·imarily, in the light of whether they were advocated or opposed, but rather on the basis of whether gre~ter care and intelli- gence should not have been used in their conception, and greatet· skill izl their execution. Limit Pru-ty Regularity \A measure of party regularity may be desh-able, but it should not be made han! and fa,t, either in respect of individuals or of the pro- gram of leaders. When the post-war Europe'ln eon \tit utions wet·e adopt- ed, many of them pmvided that persons electoed to the lPc: islative assembly should :be lxlund only ·by theil· own conscienrPs and not by instruction. Manifestly. this is Ps- sential if Democratic government is to work, fori ts essence is compro- mise, and if a sufficient number of deputies are bound by mandatPs, there is deadlock. \On the oth-er hand, especially in '1 day when the words 'crisis' and 'catastrophe' are creeping into the current vocabulary of politics, it is important that leaders must edu- cate their followers and be prepar- ed to announce that it would be im- proper to carr-y out certain prom- ise,., Parties c h•mge their posit ons. Surely it cannot .be maintained that change is per.rnit ted, not when the needs of the country demand it, but only when a quarlrPnnial manifesto is being drafte-d. \Campaign pledges, however, are pertinent to t:his f>Xtent. and the point is impoz·t•mt. The burden of proof should boe on those who dis- r-egard pledges, to how that changed c<mditions havE\ warranted a change of policy.\ -~~o-- ..

Gifford has for four The program of the pageant will open with a narration, written by Colman Hislop, '31, and read by S Ralph Cohen which will outline Payne'·s life and works. Following this will be the first scene from Payne's life. After this first scene, the nar- ration will be resumed, and follow- ing it the second scene, one from Payne's famous opera \Clari or The Maid of Milan\ will take place Clari tells the ~tory of an Italian country girl with whom a wealthy duke, Vivaldi by name, has fallen in Jove. He carries the hapless maiden ·to his ca~tle and .]{eeps her his prisoner until he can malm up his mind whether or not he shall crown his love with marriage. She awaits his uncertain state of mind at the end of which she is reas- ;,ured by the Duke. A sub-plot has to do with comic speeches and a scene between two of the Duke's servants, Espina and Jacoso her lover. Caroll Is Director The pageant is being staged and managed by both the Mountebanks and actors from Schenectady. Di· rection will be under Edward L Carrol, Mountebanks director, and the staging will be by Benjamin F. Roberts as electrician, Benjamin B. Wilson and Arthur Firth as stage men, and S. Ralph Cohen and William W. Mu!v(y as costume and property managers. Milton M. En- zer, graduate, is in charge of pub- licity. The cast for the pageant is al: follows: William, Payne's father, Mr. David Smart; Sarah, Payne's mother. Miss Anne Quigley; Eloise, Payne's sister, Mrs. John Dalton; Vespina, Miss Bertha Lloyd; Jocoso, Mr. David Smart; Duke Vivaldi. Wallace T. Foote; C!ari, Miss Lil- lian Applegarth.

A varied social program will open this evening with a supper meeting given by the Schenectady Alumni Association for all alumni and guests. After this supper the Payne Pageant will be produced, and Dr. Dixon Ryon Fox will pre- sent to the college a portrait of John Howard Payne. Tornonow morning alumni will visit cla:;srooms and sit in on any leC!ture,; that may interest them. After daily assembly, in whiC!h George H. Daley, ~ports editor of the New York Herald Tribune will speak, the Graduate Council will meet in the Tt•ophy Room of the Gymnasium. At 12 o'clock the Coun- cil will be host to the whole alumni body at a buffet luncheon in Silli- man Hall. Following the Amherst game, Dr. and Mrs. Fox will receive alumni and guests at their home. 0 Fraternities 0 pen Fall Social Season Rappa N u, Phi Gam, Phi Sig- ma Delta, Delta Upsilon and Chi Psi Entertain Five fraternities will open the fall social season at Union when they. hold dances at their respective chapter houses Saturday evening. Delta Upsilon, Phi Gamma, Delta, and Chi Psi will have formal af- fairs, and Kappa Nu and Phi Sigma Delta will hold informal dances. Chi Psi Chi Psi will have music from Earl Strickland's Orchestra. Chap- erones will be Mr. and Mrs. W. H. Lehman and Professor and Mrs. S. L. Leonard. Guests will be: Bea Keneston, Albany; Marion Carlson, Bay Shore; Helen Christensen, Schenectady; Virginia Hall, Nas- sau; Mary Critchfield, Hartford; Alice Remington, Watertown; Edith Kruse, Schenectady; Polly Remington, Watertown; Hughette Shelley, Rye; Jeanette Royster, Rye; Alison Green, Great Neck; K.ay Tolley, New Rochelle; Flo- rence Brenenstuhl, Albany; Mar- jorie Mabel, Albany; Elizabeth R.obb, Buffalo.

Playing before the many homecoming alumni and guests who are expected on the campus for the college week-end, the Dutchmen will be pressed to the limit to provide the returning members of the Union family with the thrill of victory. Amherst, con:;idered one of the strongest small college elevens in the east, has ever been a danger to the Garnet grid teams. Since 1894 the descendents of Lotd Jeffery Am- herst have been Inflicting defeat on Union football squads. During 41 years both institutions have played 18 games, 12 to the credit of the Sabrinas, 4 to the score of Union, and two were scoreless ties. Under Coach G. Elliott Hatfield the Dutch- men have defeated the Lord Jeffs once, and lost three times. Records Even From a technical standpoint, in comparative scores, both Union and Amherst enter tomorrow's contest on even terms. The Massachusetts team has lost two \half\ games, one to St. Lawrence 13 to 0 and another to Colgate 12 to 0, and tied Colby in the opening game 6-6. Union tied Middlebury College in its opening game 6-6, and lost last week to Hobart 7 to 0. The game tomorrow, however, cannot be analyzed by comparison of scores. Amherst lost its star ground gainer, Pattengill, in the St. Lawrence-Colgate trilogy, as well as Pagnotta and Snowball, through in- juries. All three have returned to the lineup, however, and are ex- pected to start against the Garnet tomorrow. The Sabrinas, bolstered up by the return of their veterans are expected to be as powerful as they were last year when Union was defeated 13 to 0 at Amherst. Union likewise was hampered in its campaign thus far by injuries, for in the Hobart contest last week the loss of Dick Woodruff was severely felt. Woodruff will prob- ably be in the starting lineup to- morrow. The fact also that there may be some changes in the lineup for the start of tomorrow's game has kept the team from going through its practices smoothly this week.

JOHN HOWARD PAYNE It is not only because he wrote a senti- mental song that has jerked more tears than any other ballad, that Union College is proud of John Howard Payne. He was more than a song-writer. He was a colorful figure; one of the most brilliant of the many brilliant young men who were attracted to Union College by crusty, kindly President Eliphalet Nott.

We trust that the changes have all been for the better. Union College has taken new steps in recent years, steps that should make the college a finer place. In his own right Payne is worthy to be 1·emembered as an actor and playwright of real talent. He was the exponent in America of the romantic revival in literature, cor- responding in many ways to his contempo- 1-aries in England and France.

After last Friday's assembly program of recordings played on the new Capehart phonograph, all the college is aware that this instrument exists. What few students realize is that this splendid phonograph and an extensive collec- tion of records and scores are available for the use and enjoyment of everyone. Every Tuesday afternoon at three-thirty the Mem- orial Chapel is open for students and their friends who want to listen to the I'ecol'dings .. And for the ambitious students who want to follow the music as it is played, the collection includes the scores for nearly all the records. UNION VS. SKIDMORE On the rostrum of the Memorial Chapel next Monday morning at 11 a. m. Union Col- lege will meet Skidmore College before the microphones of WGY in a debate to deter- mine whether or not woman's place is in the l!ome. Although the relations between the two nearby institutions have extended from love to platonic friendship, never before have representatives of either college met in a platform argument. It is therefore a fitting These afternoon concerts are very infor- mal. You can come and go as you please; you can listen standing up or lying down, or in any intermediate position. The programs consist entirely of s.elections requested by the listeners. A wide variety of selections are available: orchestral, instru- mental, vocal, and operatic, by composers ranging from Palestrina to Stravinsky.

This is the first encounter on a four game schedule which is entirely de- void of soft spots. Although it has shown up weH in scrimmages against the varsity, the squad is still of uncertain calibre. The Gloversville array, coached by \Duke\ Miller, former Spring- field College heavyweight boxing champion, has already swept over Mechanicsville, Dolgeville and Sco• tia. Apparently they have man power, three and four deep, because in each of the three games played thus far, the second team has been engaged for more than half of the time. In addition, the Union team will be handicapped in having to play its first game on a strange gridiron. Starting Lineup The probable startnig lineup for the freshman will include Thomas and Henderson as first choices for ends, Terhune and Irish at the tackles,. Mulcare and Stevenson at the guards, and Baker at center. Comenzo, Amazon, Maxwell, and Czech will be in the backfield. Among the reserves certain to see action are \Red\ Grant, scrappy tackle, who has ·been held ·back by a bad leg, Teare, a guard, and Bur- rell and Garnett, backs. * * • It is interesting to note that two men developed by Coach Miller at Gloversville are now playing on the Union varsity.

However as there is nt> retul'll address o~ this letter, we are printing it in hQpes that Aunt Sue will event- ually see it. Dear Aunt Sue: entation of .two magnificent sym- phonic concerts vvithin the course of 24 hours. On Saturday evening the Boston Symphony played over the NBC network, and on Sunday afternoon the enti·re concert of the Philharmonic was broadcast by the CBS. It would be superfluous to waste space in praising the thri!'ling per- formances of both orchestras. Theref01e, considering the ·diversity of the programs played by the or- chestras, let us recall a matter which was suggested in this column some weeks ago, the problem of style, The principal work of the Boston Orchestra was the Second Sypm- hony of Sibelius; the principal work of the Philharmonic was the Cesar Franck Symphony. Both of these symphonies are totally unre- lated, and paradoxically at·e con- nected by the same limbs. This is possible because the materials of the two are identical, but the re- spective organizations of them have no connection. There are only thir- teen notes of utility for composi- tional purposes. These can be used no more than four at a time if there is to remain a cognizable pat- tern. Now the mathematician will contend that there can be innumer- able permutations and combina tions of thirteen units taken one to four at a time. The musician re- futes this with the statement that not all combinations· yield concor·d. Those of discord are ruled out. It follows that there is a limited num- ber ·Of combinations which are available to the composer. What with the countless number of com- posers who have tried their hand at writing certain sequences must come to light again and again. Franck may use the same se- quence of chords or melodies which Bach used, and Siebelius may em- ploy the same technical devices of Fr·anck. What then, someone is bound to ask, accounts for the dif- ference in their music? The differ- ence constitutes the difference of their philosophies. Art is merely a man's thoughts or beliefs translated into tones, words, colors, or forms, When a man writes a symphony or any other kind of music, he em- ploys old materials and clothes them with what he feels. This feel- ~ng i.s indicated by phrasing, shad- mg. orchestration, accentuation of subtle parts <inner voices), contrast of rhythms, intensity accorded to certain sequences. In the end it is only the interpolation of subtleties into a given form which makes tor difference.

Pencheff Dashes 87 Yards for 'l'ouchdown; Cubs Slipshod In Tackling, Blocking Successfully emulating their varsity compatriots, the freshmen football team absorbed a 25-0 set- back at Gloversville Saturday. The defeat, the worst Nels Nitchman~s tearns have experienced during his coaching career, came as somewhat of a shocsk after the impressive showing the squad made in pre- game practice. Except for sever101I brief flashes of power, the 1939 team put up a dismal brand of ball. They tried hat d, but seemingly every- thing that they did went wrong. liowe.ver, the fact that Duke Miller has a good club at Gloversville can- not be denied. They showed a var· ied attack which made good use of forward and lateral passes, both their own and some of Union's. A.gainst this offense the freshman offered a spotty resistance, the charge of the line being noticeably weak. Semi-Ftnal Reached North College yestet·day a:;>serted its supremacy in the Intramural touch football league by defeating Phi Gamma Delta 7 to 0, and there- by place itself at the top of the heap in the winne1s' bracket. The ,lone score was achieved as one of 'Guy :Griswold's pas:>es was inter- cepted and run for the only touch- down of the game. The teams were evenly matched, and it was the \breaks\ of the game which decided the winner. Phi Gamma Delta still has another chance however, as this was her first defeat, and conse- quently will remain as a contestant in the losers' b.racket. Kappa Nu edged forward in the losers' round by conquering Sigma Chi 7 t.o 0, while Sigma Phi was overcoming Alpha Phi Delta 12 to 7. The losers of these two games are thereby eliminated from the tourna- ment, leaving Phi Gamm, Kappa Nu, Sigma Phi and Delta Phi left to fight it out for the champion- ship of the losers' bracket.

Latest esti- mates show that there are approx· imately 600 colleges with football teams. Most of the~e play an eight- game schedule, which means that about 300 games are played weekly or a total of 2,400 games a season. Average attendance is figured be- tween two and three thousand, which brings U.P the total attend- ance for one season to about 13,000-, 000. * * * Soldiers' Field, in Chicago, the only field or stadium ever to house 100,000 or more at ()ne football game.

On these five occasions he made runs of 15, 45, 56, 67, and 95 yards, all of them being touch- downs! .. Vermont's win over Coach Ketz's trackmen is the first in three years. In the two p: evious meets, Union easily took over the lads from Ver- mont. last year by a perfect score and the year before with a 19 to 36 win.

Last year the Cardinals went down before the Dutchmen. 16 to 39. With the exception of Bastedo, Hawkes and North, the squad ran seven and one-half miles. Bastedo and Hawkes got away with a mere four and a half while North did not run because of a bad leg.

STATE AND BROADWAY Three Colliers' Article Fails to Diminish Lacrosse Squad Frank Owens, famous creator of Philbert in Colliers magazine, and Kyle Crichton, au thor, commenta- tor, and one of Colliers' editovs, combined in publishing an article severa:l weeks ago on the rigours of the murder-sport called lacrosse. The humorous effort was posted in a· public place on the campus as a warning, presumbably, to would-be players of the ancient Indian sport. It is also quite likely that Fred Wyatt, using the old .psychology, tacked up the magazine article in hopes of adding recruits to his fall lacrosse squad. From aU outward indications the former presumption did not have the desired effect, for Fred Wyatt and cohorts have succeeded in tear- ing up the turf on the Library Field once more, and ar·e in for a few months of healt·hy exercises. More than 25 cnthu:;iastic stick-wielde' s have been getting in their daily due under Coach Wyatt's tutelage. Some of the freshmen players in the scrimmages held regularly have shown promise ,of becoming valu- able assets to the frosh team next year-if they aze eligible. Besides the upperclassmen and varsity play- ers who have been doing well in the three weeks of drill, the year- lings who have possibilities are Joe Paul, Merlin Fay, AI Horowitz, Vic- tor Korycinski, Dietrich Pause, and Henry Clay.

The college ought to pro- vide the opportunity for the indi- vidual student to get some exer- cise.'' J. Harold Wittner, director of athletics of the college, pointed out in an interview yesterday that so rarely had the apparatus been used that it bad been deemed advisable to get rid of most of the para:phen- alia which cluttered up the gym- nasium. No Interest Shown. Of occasional light workouts Mr. Wittner said that \no interest has been shown in that sort of thing sin~e the time that Oliphant left the directorship of athletics in 1923. The apparatus which has been sold had rarely been used by anyone.\ Since Mr. Wittner beca:me direc- tor of athletics at Union only two and a half rowing machines were installed as new gym equipment. Besides the four mechanical oars, the college is provided also with many dumb-bells lying unused in the stockroom. Upon investigation yesterday it was discovered that only one person was making use of the l'OVIing machine during the afternoon. Queried as to whether he found the materials in the gym- nasium sufficient in performing whatever exercises he desired, he replied that he had no need: for using anything else but the track and the mechanical oars. Gatchell's complete statement is as follows: \Personally and with several others, I have spoken to Hal Wittner about the laclt of gym equipment. I know that there are at least a dozen others who would like an occasional workout in the gym. Gatchell's Statement \There's absolutely nothing for such a light workout, except to run around the track; and that's no fun. The college ought to pro- vide the opportunity for the indi- vidula student to get some exer- cise. I think a minimum require-. ment would be chest weights, a horse, buck, parallel bars, and a. set of flying rings. Al.;;o the mats to go with them; I believe most of the mats have been sold with the equipment. \The athletic department has been run with a surplns for the past four years. I think they could afford at least this minimum of regular gymnasium equipment.\ Even during this severe depres· sion, certain Union graduates con- tinue to forge ahead in various fields and professions. One of these is George Wadsworth '14, who has just been assigned as consul gen- eral and counselor of legation in Bucharest. This Is one of the most coveted posts in the diplomatic corps, there being only eight con- sul general appointments given by the United States.

Christian Association Meets The Union Coilege Christian As- sociation will meet tonight at 7:30 in Room .20, North College. All stu- dents interested in the organiza- tion or its work are cordially in- vited to atfiendi the meeting. Nearly everyone who pretends to any knowledge of choral or organ music in the Mohawk Valley knows of Dr. Elmer A. Tidmarsh, Director of Music at Union College, who not only directs the college Glee Clu=b but also the long established choral or!,ranizations in Albany, Kingston, Poughkeepsie, Schenectady and Troy, and also gives a public organ recital every Sunday afternoon, as well as private engagements In vari- ous parts of the state. But few know of him as a composer in spite of the fact that starting with the Sesquicentennial celebration in Saratoga in 1927, Dr. Tidmarsh's importance as a composer began to equal his other accomplishments. Several compositions written for the Saratoga .:pageant were so well received th:at they have been re- peatedly used at other great pag- eants, as well as adapted to addi- tional widespread use.

Pe1haps it is too much to expl•ct U.S. oilmen to cooperate with the League and give up this hot m:uket voluntarily.

Dean Friday, October 18, 1935 GYMNASIUM EQUIPMENT The question raised in student l.Jody meet- ing concerning- the sale of g·ymnasium equip- ment should not be misunderstood. No accu- satiol1 of Mr. Wittner or the Athletic Depart- ment was intended. The sale of the equip- ment was not a sensational disclosure, but a simple fact. The issue resolves itself into whether or not there is enough need for exer- cising apparatus to justify its repurchase. Fo1· a number of .rears, when the college had the equipment, no one u.sed it. It just gathered dust in the corner. The Athletic Department did the logical thing and sold all the unused apparatus. ~ow at least one student has voiced the desire for gymnasium equipment. If the num- ber of students who want to use such appar- atus is sufficient to l<eep them dusted off, they should be given the opportunity to do so. The chance to use the gym is one of the things which the student tax covers. Certain exercising contraptions are standard gym equipment. But the college ought not to buy equipment until more than one student has signified his intention to use it. OIL FOR THE SHIPS OF ITALY The United States has declar-ed an em- bm·go on the shipment of war materials to Italy. The moot question is, what are war materials? On President Roosevelt's list of commodities officially defined as instruments of war were .shells, explosives, guns, tanks, gas and airplanes. Notably absent from the list were steel, cotton, and oil. These products have peacetime uses, but are vitally impor- tant in waging war, fully as necessary as guns and munitions. There is only one good reason for a ft·esh- man-sophomore football game-to unify these classes by creating a friendly rive~lry between them. If underclassmen understand this reason and push it enthusiastically, the game will have accomplished its purpose. If they consider it a mere imposition to set them aside as underclassmen, the spirit of the idea will be destl·oyed. Edmund Lowe gives his usual h·ammy ·performance while Miss Sothern exhibits about as much draina as a field mouse. The old story about trying to make an ome- let out of one egg. The vaudeville, except for the piano trio, is the worst that has come to to·wn-and we said some- thing about vaudeville not heing dead! The result of the game rests in the hands of the classes that play it. It is up to them to make it a worth-while custom. THE THESPIAN ITCH We never fail to wonder at th2 sheer per- sistence of the .Mountebanks, and their hard- working director, .Hr. Edward Linus Carroll. The history of this redoubtable organiza- tion is filled with examples of doing the sePmingly impossible. Half a dozen yean; ago they erected their own theatre in Hanna Hall, after a long campaign for the neces- sary funds. During the ensuing years while they struggled with cramped quarters, and made most of their stage equipment, the~: continued to produce plays of high artistic value. Every season has been marked by im- proved equipment, better sets, a new switch- board, or better lighting facilities. Theil· lat- est technical triumph, announced in assembly Wednesday by President John Emans, is the completion of dressing rooms directly below the stage. The value of this achievement c~n only be appreciated by student actors who have tried to change costume in the four- foot space between the stage and the floor of the hall. ---0--- In the Mail To the Editor: Your editorial appearing in the cC>lumns of The Concordiensis on Tuesday, October 15, 1935, entitle-d \Severing Athletic Relations\ strikes me as being out of harmony with the general trend of thought prevalent among the mass of think- ers. You \fail to see how such an at'tion c the refusal to participatP in the Alympic Games> would ac- eomplil\h anything- to intensify the racial ,bitterness and. acrimony which alreatly exists on both sides.\ Does it occur to you what a slur on human intelligence the present order in Germany is? Do you fail to realize how imperative it is to smash thi::; menace? You are suffi- ciently rational to understand how such a regime can only revert so- ciety to ,barbarism. In aceord with this, can you aff01·d to evade any possibility which allows you to throw another bomb into the pres- ent Nazi government? By refusing to allow our athletes to participate in the 1936 Olympic Games at Berlin. we are not inten- sifying the racial animosity of the Germans. We are strengthening the economic boY'cott which ultimately will cause an internal rising against the present Hitler government. The only way to do this is to \starve a revolution.'' It is essential that all rational thinking people con- solidate their forces and boycott Germany from every angle. T HO~GH la~ge, the Bell System is simple in structlUe. Thmk of It as a tree.

In anticipation of a close run, Coach Ketz has put his runners through a hard schedule this week. Not at all pleased with the showing of the Dutchmen at Vermont, Ketz hopes that the intensive condition- ing of the past week has done a lit- tle toward putting the team in more of a balanced condition. One mo1e man to keep up with Captain Ed Bastedo and Bill Hawkes would be enough to give the Garnet an edge on their opponents.

Lineup to Start Against Catamounts; Gat- chell Is Injured Tomorrow·~ contest between the Union varsity football team and the University of Vermont looms up as the crucial test of the season for the Garnet eleven, Not only does the game mat k the midpain t of the L;rid schedule, but it is one of the main deciding factot·s between a .,;ucce::;::;ful and an unsuccessful sea- o:;on. Vermont University, with one victory and two defeats as its 1935 rPcord, ha.,; ever been one of the mn\t fnrmiclable opponents Union ~11d teams have encountered. In the eight games played since foot- ball relations were begun in 1900, Union has barely taken four vic- tories and Vermont three, while the tie game last year exemplified the almost equal balance maintained by the GatnPt and the Green on the gridiron. N I'.CPssary Changes The starting lineup for the Dutchmen is the result of several important changes made by Coach HatftPlu thi:; week in order to bol- stet· up the line and the backfield. The ease with which the big Am- herst bal'k~ and linemen drove •Ju ough th<' local eleven necessi- tated ,;un:e sort of shift or change ·n the sUu·ting petsonnel. Captain Charles Krull went back u h:s ftt v·JI ite right tackle position, ·md Joe MJlano, :.oubstitute end and back, has taken the vacated left halfback post. Milano's size and speed, if they are employed fully tomorrow, should be a most impor- tant issue in the outcome of the contest. He, Ernie Brown, and Herman Greu!ick will have to carry the main brunt of the Union at- tack. Dick Woodruff, recovered from his injury, will direct the plays from the quarterback post. Milano's presence in the starting lineup should also count for added punting strength. Both he and Brown are well able to do the kiclt- ing for Union. The passing, if there is any, will devolve upon Brown and Woodruff, both of whom are southpaws. The only oustanding change in the line will be the use of Jack Sloatman in place of Frank Gat- chell, who is injured, at the left tackle position. Van Waldron and Jim Marotta will start once more in the wing posts, and Jack Kearns a:nd Bill Potts will be the starting guards. Paul Campbell will play at center. , The Catamounts, preparing against whatever may be expeeted from the Union repertoire, have been drilled continually in such de- fense this week by Coach John Saba. Only seven lettermen are on the varsity team, and all of them are expected to start. The greatest strength of the Mountain team lies in the backfield where two veterans have been playing together for al- most tw~ years. Catamounts' Lineup Jack T. Bedell, who started out to be a center last year, was con- verted into a ·back, and his 175 pounds will be a valuable addition to the already heavyweight back- field. Captain Libera Giard! and Ed Funk, both members of the team for the pa:st three years, will be seen in action at the fullback and the quarterback positions, re- spectively. The remaining back- field man will be Sunderland, a husky sophomore. A lighter line blesses the Green and Gold team this season, and some more speed has been added to its ever present power. \M. P.\ Gardner and Trottier will play the end positions tomorrow. Both are under 5 feet 10 inches in height. The tackles will be Austin H. Ross and S. Frait, heaviest men on the team, Ross is the team's best punter, however, and was used with much success in all of Ver- mont's games so far. The guards are Lawton and George, regulars from last year, and the center is the tall heavy Lawton.

Three Sages Pick Eight Contests· Alike, Anything Might Happen After the shellacking the sports editors to-ok last week at the hands of the chief cook and bottle washer, we are prone to be a bit skeptic this Saturday. A few more teams have been added to the roster to make the going a. little tougher, but on the other hand mistakes will not count as much in the .percentages. Here al'e the predictions, and if one falls they all do: A COLLEG~ PROFISSOR DISCOV~HED Besides the six man team that ran last week, Bob Everest and Sam Hewitt will probably be in the Union group when they line up for the start, In Hewitt's case, it is doubtful if he will be in shape to stand the grind of the four-mile run. Everest has shown up well in •lhe runs this week and will prob- ably have a try today. The rest of . the team will be composed of those who ran last Saturday, Russ Knox, Jerry +'Jeumann, Harry Myers, Ed Basted(}, Blll Hawkes, and Bob North. . . ... Myers has improved greatly this weelt. Perhaps he doesn't like to have the \kid\ brother gloating over him. Brother Bill Is doing great work on the fresh team. ---o---- Changes in Will Follow Classrooms Renovation. Students whose classes have !J.een moved out of Washburn Hall dur- Ing renovation will again attend lectures at permanent locations when work In redecorating the old semi-circular building is finished at the end of next week. For the first time, all classes in the Social Studies division will be held in Bailey Hall which will also accommodate Mr. Achiiles' class in Bible. The Student Activities Office, for- merly situated in the Old Chapel building, has been completely fitted out at the south end of Washburn Hall. The old activities office, con- sequently, will be used by the geol- ogy department for exhibits. Offices and classrooms ()f Dr. March and Dr. J<>hnson will be in the south end of Washburn Hall, and those of Dr. Coffin and Dr. Kellogg in the north end. In conjunction with the work on the interior of Washburn Hall, the gasoline pump, which has received a great e.mount of publidty lately, has been repainted a dark green color. At present, tb.is color makes a sharp contrast with the red and brown of autumn foliage, but Comp- troller Hoadley hopes that the pump will appear less conspicuous to the chance 'visitor on the campus; Mr. Hoadley has advised the stu- dent who suggested that a gasoline tank be placed in the cellar of Washburn to learn a little about insuranc& rates. · Contest Stevenson Bedell Trumbull Navy- vs. Yale ............

On the probable schedule for the year will be several con- ferences, speakers, and other activ- ities a:s well as the regular Christ- mas carol sing, pep rallies, and re- ligious forums. The meeting of the association, to be held tonight at 7:30 in Room 20, North College, the psychology laboratory, Neumann stated, is open to all students, and anyone else in- terested in the Christian Associa- tion is invited. The Union College association also plans to send a· representative to the All-Day Conference of Christ- tan Student Leaders of the Upper Hudson Valley held at Skidmore f?ollege, Saratoga, on October 27, 1935. All other students who are interested are urged to attend.

At least that is the case with five million boys and girls who belong to the great Fascist youth movement, the National Balilla Institution, for their motto is \Today Balillas, to- morrow soldiers, always Fascists.\ And there is ample evidence that they believe heart and soul in that motto. There is nothing spontaneous about the Italian youth movement, entirely imposed from above as it is, and with every other organiza- tion suppressed. The control is in Rome, ostensibly in an executive committee, but actually in the hands of one Renata Ricci, a young man himself, who is responsible only to Mussolini.

A. L. who detected the slip. This alp-habetical bureau has the job of spending fifty million dollars to plaster up the breech between the idle youth of the na- tion and the cracked economic system. Mr. Williams estimates that from five to eight million young people between the ages of sixteen and twenty-five are wholly uno-ccu- pied, neither working nor attending school; three million of these are already on relief. And each June, hundreds of thousands g-rad- uate from school and college into a surfeited labor market. \It is a cold and unwelcoming world,\ he says, \that our young people are entering.\ That the NY A's funds are really b-Eing spent to remake the economic world, how- ever Mr. Williams rapsodizes, is open to question. Most of the money is being spent to con- tinue the old FERA college-aid prog-J.·am, and to extend it to include graduate students and high school students whose families are al- ready on relief. This part of the program is of unquestiQnable value in helping nEedy stu- dents to obtain an education, but it is not a permanent economic adjustment between the jobless youth and the economic system. The one point which Mr. Williams is at pains to make clear is that there will be no real tampering with the present business and employment set-up. All NY A jobs will b€ created in addition to present ones, and \in no case shall we try to force young people into industry if it means pushing older peo- ple out at the top.\ The NYA should come out and admit that it is only a temporary relief for our econo~ic ills, and not pretend to be a cure.

After the con- test it was said that even officials were in doubt as to whether the Green and Gold team had made its core.

Popular Sport Still an unrecognized sport at Umon, fencing has gained in popu- larity since its revival tht·ee years Following the pace set by Fritz Hawley last year, Marvin Dwore, 'Freshman tennis ace, launched him- sElf into the final round of the In- tramural tennis tournament by overwhelming George McGee, ten- nis captain, 6-2, 6-3. If the Catamounts had .not regis- tered a touchdown in the second quarter, however, it is highly prob- able that they would have done so later in the game. 'I\he Dutchmen several times were forced with their •backs against their own goal posts· to withstand the drives of the heavy Vermont players. On the defensive the Union eleven at times made a showing that de- serves commendation, but offen- sively theze was no co-ordination between blockers, linemen, and ball· carriers.

In the first year of . its rebirth, the team was defeated · in every engagement, all of them The match, played yesterday aft- ernoon in the face of a stiff wind, turned out to be a breeze for Dwore as he raced through two sets in about an hour. Due to the da;mp clay, Dwore's cut f'hots worked! to perfection, for Mc- Gee could only raise these place- ments high in the atr, and Dwoz'e spent most of his time putting the .returns away at the net. The tall McGee seemed to have trouble with his drives, which nea·rly always hit the top of the net, but did not man- age to faJ:J over, and his usually de- pendable serve failed him at the crucial moments. Dwore maintain- ed a lead throughout the match, -and took the last game of the con- test at love, finishing with a neat placement which McGee could. not touch. The second match of the after- noon was a spirited tussle in which Hawley was forced to extend him- self to subdue Bob Carr 7-5, 6-3. This test, the most difficult of the tournament for the defending cham- pion, provided the few spectators with some exciting rallies, espe cially during the opening set when Carr made his most serious bid for supremacy. Hawley's calm, steady, returning-every-shot style of game was too much for the yearling how- ever, so Fritz enters the finals for the second consecutive year, facing Dwore, sometime this week, in a match which should prove to be one of the best of the tournament. Naturally. Hawley is the favorite, having captured the title last year as a freshman, but Dwot e's expe- rience as Junior State Champion, as well as city titalist, should be considered an important factor in estimating his abilities.

In the past two games the Catamounts had been going the losing way. Satur- day's test was one of the deciding factors in the success of its sched- ule. Union likewise had much to gain in the Vermont co-ntest. A two game losing streak was emphasized one more degree when the Green team counted the Dutchmen out. It is curious to note that pre- game conditions for Union and Ver- mont were almost the same as in 1934. Ai that time the Garnet also played its fourth game of the sea- son with Vermont after losing two straight games to Hobart and Am- herst. Vermont last year had started off its season as it did this fall with a victory over R. P. I., and then proceeded to Jose the next two games. . Union's conquest of R. P. I. m 1934, following the tie with Ver- mont, started the Dutchmen on their way to the climax of the sea- son when they defeated Williams College on Alexander Field. What purport the similarity in the sea- sons may have remains to be seen. Vermont Intercepts The only significant feature in the offensive playing of Union Sat- urday was the forward passing in the final period, when the Dutch- men began to advance beyond mid- field. Captain Charles Krull, who was brought to the backfield f.rom his left tackle po.sition, did the throwing for the Garnet. Van Wal- dron, Greulick, and Burton were at the receiving ends of three of his tosses, but Green and Gold pass de- fense men took care of a few oth- ers. The interceptions by the Moun- taineers were sufficient to keep the ball far up in Union territory in that last frame, although the visi- tors made four first downs to the home team's none. The outstanding defensive play by the Union representatives wa~ a four-yard stand in the third penod when the Vermont backs, Giardi and Funl1, advanced the ball to a first down in that most strategic position, Here the Garnet closed all gaps showed itself a l'eally strong machine, and greatly surprised its opponents by throwing them back every time a play wa.s tried.

Knox, who bad dropped to eleventh place at the one and three-quarter mark, spurted near the end and moved up to ninth post for the sixth Union man to place. * * • Ralph Semerad gets his name in the All Sports Record Book of 1935. He is listed as having taken part in three freshman and twenty-four varsity football contests without be- ing removed from the game once. We are inclined to think that this statement is not altogether true. Can anyone enlighten us on the sub- ject? * • • .Alonzo Stagg bas the distinction of being the oldest coach in point of service in the game today. His career began in 1891.. and he has been going· strong for the past 44 years. * • • The longest forward pass on the record books was a seventy-yard heave made in 1920 in a game be- tween Ohio State and California. H. P. Miller tossed the pigskin to his teammate, H. Stephens. No touch- down? No touchdown. *. • • The team at present consists of but four men with any great amount of previous experience. James Righter, member of Delta Upsilon and acting business mana- ger of the Concordy, was recently elected captain of the team and will fence with both the saber and foils. Righter was a member of last year's team and in three matches was un- defeated. Elmer Sheldon, Earl Dewey, and Jerry Cohen, also jun- iors, complete the roster of expe- rienced men. At the present two freshmen seem to be rounding into condition which warrants their con- sideration for the team. Tyler will probably substitute in the foil events while Capriello will be ready to take on the epee duellers as well as the foils. Th four men now constituting the team aid in teaching the freshmen the finer points of the sport. at the same time brushing up on their own faults and maintaining their accu- racy in thrusting and defensive tac- tics . ----•0---·- Dr. Fox Addresses Civic Players Luncheon Dr. Dixon Ryan Fox was the principal speaker at a luncheon ten- dered the Civic Players on Satur- day by the Chamber of Commerce. Declaring the Civic Players were a \colleague institution\ to Union Col- lege as a cultural agency of Sche- nectady, Dr. Fox enumerated the many contributions that the Civic Players have made to the cultural life of Schenectady. He also men- tioned the help which they have given to Union College on several occasions. · Plans were announced at the lunch- eon for the forthcoming production of John Gay's \The Beggar's Opera.\ Complete Shoe Repairing Service Shoes Dyed Sport Soles Attached While You Wait Service The Wallace Co.-Basement JAMES E.

STATE AND BROADWAY Ernie Brown, who h.ad a most dif- ficult time getting off his punts be- cause he was so o-ften hurried, played a strong game at half for the Dutchmen. One of his kicks in the second quarter was the sparlt that set the Vermont team moving towards the disputed touchdown. Funk, a veteran signal calle~ of fair proportions, carried Browns punt to the Union 32-yard line in that part of the game. Then he took a 22 yard pass from SUnderland, a substitute, and ran to the Garnet seven before he was downed. It was on the next three :plays that Giardi was given the ball to move it slowly but surely towards a score. His last forward motion with. the oval was through the center and presumably over the goal line. Coach Ketz was well pleased with the showing of his team in Friday'~ meet. Yesterday the team went through their paces with a five- mile warmup run. Bastedo, Neu- mann and Hawkes finished to- gether with Knox and finally North coming in. North has be·en bother- ed with his legs whi·ch tighten up often. Everest took a three mile jaunt at an easy stride. Denton did did not run due to an infected foot, while Sam Hewitt, after a brief attempt, was forced to give in because of his leg injury which has prevented him from starting in the opening two contests. Harry Myers wa.s brought in by Coach Ketz after running about two miles. Coming down a hill he turned his ankle and pulled the muscles on the top of his foot. 'Today the varsity team went over the four-mile course. The rest of the week will see the daily grind gradually tapered down to a short warm up on Friday. R. P.

At 8:45 the gro~ will leave the campus and start a march through the tow.n, a phase of the program that it is hoped will be of greatest interest to the student body, what- ever its ultimate character. In chapel this morning, Dr. Fox expressed his regret for his inabil- ity to be present at the rally. He continued by reminding the stu- dents to confine their hilarity to the campus and avoid a repetition of last year's 'raid on the town.' Fred!dy Wyatt, however, assured Dr. Fox and the sl.udents that this year the police were with the stu- dents since the parade through town will have a police escort. ---o--- Changing his tactics from the previous runs, Ketz will send out Hawkes and Bastedo to make time. Bastedo has previously hung back to help the rest of the runners along. With these two men out in Union-R.P.I. X-Country Series front, North and Neuman will run together in an attempt to hole out the first four places. The latter two Year runners will have to show speed to 1925 nose out at least ()ne of the Engi- neers.

Feldman Friday, October 25, 1935 MAY THE WORSE TEAM LOSE! Union versus R. P. I.! Nearly fifty years ago the first football game between the two schools took place on neutral ground at Al- bany. Since then, with but a few gaps, the contest has been waged every y.ear. In slang terms, this game is a \natural.\ The rivalry between Union and our neighbors from Troy is intense, the teams usually rise to the oc- casion and play inspired football, and rooters from both institutions turn out en masse. The traditional argument tomorrow after- noon should be even more exciting than its predecessors. Both teams have made poor showings so far this season. Each will be doubly anxious to get back into the winning column. Union will be host to the engineers to- morrow. The last time they came over they took away with them a souvenir of the oc- casion. We trust that this time the goal posts will remain intact, no matter what the out- come of the game. And may the worse team lose! CONGRATULATIONS ·Congratulations to the new Phi Beta Kappa men!

I'DOL PROSPECTUS It is a custom of several years standing to devote one assembly in the fall term to hearing- an apology for The Idol from the editor of that magazine. The speeches have usually sounded some- thing like this: We realize that you boys use your copies of The Idol for bases when you play softball, or else test your strength by tearing them in two with your bare hands. But may we humbly suggest that you try reading the magazine, just once; or better still write for it? How can you expect us to publish a student magazine if you students don't contribute anything but the money I After listening to that sore of thing for several years, it is refreshing to hear the new editor, Robert Langer, tell his policy for The Idol. He served notice on the student body that The Idol is not going to put on lit- erary airs, nor try to imitate the professional literary magazines. The Idol Board are not going to carry chips on their shoulders be- cause the magazine is unpopular. They are going to win back the prestige and intere~t a student literary magazine in a liberal col- lege should have.

Fresh from indus- trial school the young miner dis- covered that by reorganizing the working method he could produce more than 100 tons of coal to a shift from each shaft in the Don- bas mine instead of the previous average of ibetween five and six. The idea has quickly spread to the railroads and textile mills so that in some p.hases, U. S. production has been surpassed. Some of the Russian workers fear that it will result in more work. in the hands of the editor. We applaud Mr. Langer's decision to en- courage brief articles and stories. It is very great literature indeed that cannot be im- proved by cutting. THESE UNIVERSITIES- We are inclined to measure the value of a university by the size of its plant, the num- ber of its buildings, the newness of its edu- cational gadgets. More than one institution is actually hampered by the vastness of its physical outlay, the upkeep of its trimmings, which executives and proud alumni have erected to give themselves a place in the sun. And the mass of citizenry, baffled by this educational splendor, are tricked into admir- ation for it. A member of the Union faculty spent a summer studying in the Huntington Library in California. This institution, which con- tains a large and valuable collection of books, has been organized to facilitate graduate study by scholars. There are no classes in the usual sense of the word, no professors, nothing to bolt, no assignments to cut, noth- ing but a library and enough equipment to simplify the use of it. The students who are allowed the use of this institution are not there under compul- sion, but because they are curious. They have nothing- to push them except their own in- terest in some certain subject, nothing to hasten or restrict their progress. The library, according to this particular member of the faculty, most nearly corre- sponded to his ideal of a university. And yet there were no education gadgets, no compli- cated machinery to bind the students. Only a group of men reading books and talking about them. Perhaps we should reconsider universities, look deeper than the surface. Have they something apart from system and appear- ance, or are they so entangled with labor sav- ing devices, that students are actually ham- pered? At Proctor's is unfolded a tale of the manicurist and the ne'er-do- well society boy. The boy is about to marry a sassiety gal for her noney and the manicurist is look- Ing for someone with $10,000,000. Tllinking the boy has money, the manicurist starts on the make for him, causing him to miss his boat to- :Bermuda where the future father-in-law is sending him for a short vacation. The boy spends a week at the manicurist's apartment because he has no mo-ney (pm·ely platonic, the Warner Bros. would have us be- lieve) aJ:J.d of course love overtakes then though neither will admit it. H.alph :Bellamy as a crippled flier wl:Jo befriends the manicurist sits in on the reconciliation and glor- iously casts all thought of asking th.e manicurist to marry him as the curtain falls ..As you may see, the plot is not unusual but thP. unique handling of the whole thing served to make us quite unaware of the fact that an old plot was being dished out to us. The .production runs along very smoothly thanks to the adroit han- dling of Director Leisen. Fred Mac- M:urray as the boy is the best juve- nile HDllywood has found in almost two years. He has an infectious grin and a likeably honest face plus considerable acting ability. M:iss Lom.bard, as the manicurist, proves that she is the only one in California to play the type of role wl:Jich she does-perhaps we are prejudiced, though, as she has al- ways ·been our idea of the perfect cine actress. Watch for her take-off of Marion Davies-one of the su.btlest pieces of mimicry we've seen. The camera work, done by an unknown, is also worthy of note. The big scene ending in a kiss and th.e unusual photograph of the kiss ·is swell-truly camera art. The cameraman also realized that Miss Lombard can be photographed from any position, closeup or angle with equal effectiveness and utilized the fact in an expert man- ner. Vaudeville: Phooey!

Lunger, ''36, editor-in-chief, the- reubon that The ldol has not been an inte.est ing magazine in past years it; that it~ editor:; have been over<d ·ecl.stic. ''They want<>d a magazine whict could compare favorably with th€ leading magazines of the country, and tl:>'ey attempted to produce one,\ he declared in his talk in assembly Wednesday. Their ob· jective was impossible. Even those college students who have crea· tive ability lack the maturity and the ex:perience of most professional writers.\ Student Interest Is Goal \Therefore we are going to pub- lish a magazine this year which is admittedly inferior to 'Harper's' and the 'Atlantic Monthly,' an\1 even to most of the less highly-re- puted magazines. Does this mean that our magazine is going to be cheap, to lack any artistic value? Not at all. The Idol was founde(j, as a literary magazine, and as such, we want the best writing that students can produce. But we are not losing sight of the fact that The Idol is only possible through taxes which the students pay, and, therefora, we are going to try to publish a magazine which will be of interest to most students.\ Langer said that material for The Idol would be accepted on the basis of two characteristics. \First good writing, for it is a lit- erary magazine and without good writing there would be no need of having such a magazine. The sec- ond char!¥)teristic is interest, fnr it is the students' magazine, and we must insure student support.\ To Appear on Time \This year one of the major aims of The Idol board is to have the magazine appear when it is sched- uled to. We still welcome all con- tributors and want very, very much to have every student contribute.\ Langer went on to say that the first issue of The Idol for this year would be out in a few weeks~on time. Langer ex~ained \that this year Dr. Burges Johnson, who teaches the advanced composition class, had been named faculty supervisor, although the final authority will rest in student hands,\ these modern oaths, and are no. langei\ mesmerized by them, nev.r ones will be Invented.

Trinity and St. Lawrt>JICt\ the next two teams to IIUik.e :nllnce meat out · of R. P. I., are famed for their po1verful tean1s this ;year. Trinity won · its 14th consecutive game last week, defeating a stu.rdy Hobart team, while St. Lawrence is reputed to ha.ve the best eleven it has ever put on the gridiron, a team which crushed CorneR for the first time, this year. The Clarkson engineers also have a fine team, and for R. P. I. to lose to them by 18 points is no disgrace. It was in tho Clarkson game by the way, that the Tro3·roen scored their fint and o1d;y touchdown to date, when McKinley starting from behind his own g-oal Une, raced 102 yards to chalk up six points. Rensselaer has a great weight adYantage in the forward wall with · .a pair of 200 pound tackles, two heavy guards, an .experienced center, and a duet of veteran wingmen frorn ·last year's team. \Vilh the field in its present moist condition, the line play should be the deciding factor, and there is no doubt as to the heavy line's advantag-e wallowing in the mud ag-ainst a lighter line.

The first official game of organized intercollegiate football which the Garnet played in 1886, when a foot- ball was a \sphere\ and not an \oval the varsity team literally emerged victorious from its contest with R. P. I., played at Albany. The virus of argument and bitter- ness were instilled there.

I. took the brunt of tbe colle.ctive feeling when the Union freshmen, sophomores, jun- iors, and seniors banded together for a real football game. But R. P. I. made up, for its losses on the gridiron by victories before and after the official game. A bastard tradition was born when some enterprising Troy students visited Union and besmeared the sacred antiquities located in the most conspicuous places on the campus.

Union, in spite of and perhaps because of the fact that it has always brought mol'e energy into action against the Engin-eers, has never been able to score more than 45 points against them.

I. has played only one game this season, losing to Catholic Cen- tral High School of Troy, 9-7. Their attack rs built around Carmen Aud- itore, 175 pound triple threat full- back of Brooklyn, N. Y., whom Union must stop if it expects to win. The Cherry and White will have a distiilct edge in weight and reserve stl·ength, but the Garnet team has benefitted from its two weeks layoff, and is determined to put this game on the black ink s1de of the ledger. As the team shapes up now with Lewis and Henderson at end, Irish . and Czech at tackle, Mulcare and Stevenson or Teare at guard, Wally Baker· at center, and Thomas, Ter- hune, Garnett, and Amazon as backs, we find nine of the men who started against Gloversv1lle. Ray Lewis and Bob Garnett are the new men replacing Maxwell and Comenzo of the original back- field. .. . . The late classes of the engineers on the team has been a great han- dicap in practice. Several of the first team men are unable to re- port till five o'clock four times a week, because of laboratory ses- sions, .. . . Reports emanating from the Troy campus say that steps are being taken to raise R. P. I. foot- ball out of the slough of defeat of the past few seasons. This year's freshman team is expected to help alleviate the situation. • • The probable starting lineups: UNION R. p, J, Henderson . , ... LE.. . . . . . . . Winarick Irish ...........

Eowever, no one is able to predict the winner of such a contest, for either team is sure to produce latent power and may sweep to victory when least ex- pected. Garnet Yearlings Face Trojan X:.-Country Team R. P, I.'s frosh cross country team comes to the Union campus tomorrow with an impressive 15 to 40 win over Watervliet High School last week. Coach Stuarts has been putting his men through an inten- sive drill and. has high hopes that his team. will repeat its victory of last year over the Union yearlings. Coach Ketz's first year men were defeated last season on the R. P. I. course 16 to 39. The Garnet team has fallen be- fore Nott Terrace in its one meet to date. .Anlong the best prospects appearing on the team for Union are Donald \Tb.ompson and Frank Myers. Besides these two run- ners are Shef!er, Denton, Eaton and E. D. Thompson. This is prob- ably the full roster which will line up against. the invading Cherry and White team tomorrow at noon. Although nothing definite can be determined from the showing of the Union first-year men in the Nott Terrace meet, some semblance of balance was evidenced by the slight amount <>f time occurring between the Union finishers. The Cherry team is following in the steps of tlit'lir brother varsity team and seems headed for a satisfac- tory if not extremely successful year.

Instead of driving in at :the Payne Gate which is ·kept open all night, he tried the Blue Gate. It was locked. No apparent damage was done to the car, for neither were on the scene when three students noticed the battered gate at 11: 15, and the driver has not reported the accident. The cast iron gate was buckled and broken, from the impact, but the lock and chain held. One reenforced concrete post was pulled askew 'bY the impact, and minor pieces of the gate scattel'ed as far as fif.teen .feet. Acco1'ding to the custom be- gun this year, the Blue Gate had been locked at 10:00 o•ctocll:: by Tom Gould, the campus cop. He had continued on his rounds after locking up and no one witnessed the accident.

HEPNER The first art exhibition of the year, sponsored by the Schenectady College Woman's Club, was opened at the ·Old Gym Dormitory yester- day afternoon. On display are water colors and lithographs by Miss Gt•ace M. Knox, a resid-ent of Scl:!enectady. Miss Knox, art super- visor of the city schools, is a grad- uate of Pratt Institute, Brooklyn, New York and has also studied With the Am.erican painters, Henry Snell and George Pearce Ennis. Miss Knox has painted a tired fish- erman who, at the end of the day, lethargically slumps into a rough chair and rests his -weary body. On the whole, these scenes of Maine are clever, tieh in color, and clear in line. The water colors which are most striking are Miss Knox's still lifes. The color is warm, the form clear, and the entire picture woven into a homogeneous pattern which is refreshing to the eye. There is less rigidity in the few still lifes than In the paintings of the broader subjects such as the land- scapes and Maine coastal scenes. Mr. Ertman outlined briefly the ~~th~odss~~~~~~ht~e :~i~~ t~~= Series of Repairs to Guard Against dustry and Its allied industries, all . Outdoor Board Track Heralds Winter's Advent The 44 water colors and 8 litho- graph\s have as their subject mat- ter, for the most part, the scenes in and about the fishing town of E:astport, Maine. A few miscellan- .eous works concern themselves with France, the Catskills, and the ·vicinity of Schenectady. In the Maine scenes, it is the purpose of the artist to capture the natural ruggedness of the country and the home life of the Maine school of By far the lithographs are the highlights of the show. Miss Knox is more adept with the crayon than with the brush. She captures mood an.d time much more effectively in this medium. The most interesting wodcs in the entire show are two lithographs, The Old Barn Near Mariaville and Late Afternoon. Both have fin contrast of light and dark; their moods cannot be transmitted to words, they are to be appreciated by the observer. Miss Enox:'s craftsmanship is skill- ful, her sense of design, intelligent.

The crowd was shepherded ;.1round the campus to listen to speeches from fraternity porches (in each case with a goodly portion of the brothers on the inside looking out). Varsity players were cheered individually (sample-'Joe l\Iilano is not he1·e, but let's cheer him just the same: Raa-a;,;, ;\lila no!'). A quart of red paint was dumped on the ldol, but the symbolism of this act was left a mys- tery. Then the crO\\ d paraded downtown to adverti::;e to all and sundry theiJ· determina- tion io ueat R. P. I. l\lost of the students who we1·e present at the meeting came for one of two rem;ons: sense of duty, or curiosity. Those sent to rep- resent their fraternities obediently carried their 'Down with R. P. I.' signs, and others hung around the edge of the crowd l'eady to saunter off as .soon as the amusement began to pall. It is small consolation to realize that many masterpieces of literature have been written under p1·essm·e. Shakespeare revamped old plays and dramatized familiar stories in a frantic effort to supply a demand.

Both finished in. excellent time of 27.37. Quite some ·discussion has resulted from this tie, hut the judges ·decision stands. Hawkes Perfol\'lllS W:eU Bill Hawkes, lanky sophomore daler, gained distinction in the race throu.gh his inspired run. Trailing· the R. P. I. leader h:y thirteen sec- onds, Hawkes came in to the finish in 26:55, the second 1Jnion man ever to break twenty-seven minutes. on. the present run. The course was shifted about in 1933. and since that A. I. E. E. team last Friday. Dis- playing a brand of ball which eve:n they didn't think they possessed, the Civila outsmarted the Electri- <Jians during the entire course of the game, holding their powerful opponents to a single score which carne just before the final whistle. The first touchdown came as a result of a short pass from \Power- house\ Stevenson to \Ditch-digger\ Bergman, which was completed on the A. S. C. E. ten yard stripe, whereupon the elusive Hugo squirmed and side-slipped his way to the goalline some forty yards away. Stevenson scored the extra point on a reverse play around left end. The safety was presented by Ralph Thatcher, who let his thoughts wander for a moment and passed the ball from center back over his own goal, where it was re- covered by a teammate for the loss of two points. Led .by the dynamic runs of Quar- terback Bill Thomas which were made possible by the excellent blocking of Jake Amazon and the vastly improved blocking of the team as a whole, the frosh defeated a much heavier R. P. I. eleven 20 to 0. Continuously reeling off long gains, the diminutive yearling sig- nal caller more than fulfilled Coach Nitchman's ·expedations when he pulled Thomas out of the line and put him in the backfield. The first score of the game came ·in the midd.Je of the second period when Bill Thomas climaxed a series ·of end runs with a touchdown, and then had a tough break dropping a pass in the end zone to miss the extra point. Gavetti, one of the most elusive' little quarterbacks to play here this :;eason, gave Union some real· worries when he broke through the line for gains or ran back punts after six or seven D•utchmen had hit him. He had the Garnet men' chasing him from one side of the field to the other in his attempts to break away after· catching a punt. At the start of the contest an off- side play by the home team be- spolte tension and nervousness, and on the second play when R. P. I. was likewise off-side, the 5,000 or so fans realized that both teams were playing on edge. During the course of the afternoon, the over-enthus- i:;atic Dutchmen lost 55 yards in penalties, and the Engineers 35. Joe Milano, on left, played inspired ball against the Trojans from the wing pQSition, while Ernie Brown conti:imed his fine brand of defensive ball ,playing from the full back post. time only Hawkes and Leahmon Nestle have gotten below the 27 minute line. :r'he present record of 26:28 was made by Nestle. Union, with Bastedo, Hawkes and Neuman in the fore, led the field for the first ~nile. After this mark was reached, Hltchcock step- ped up his pace and. took the lead. Pushed hy the three Union run- ners he was extended to his fullest and still had enoug·h left to make a last minute spurt before breast- ing the tape. The R. F. I. leader came within four seconds of the The Engineers seemed to have ali the bad breaks of the afternoon, for a sleeper pass from \Sparks\ Cad- wallader to Engesser rebounded from the receiver's chest with a thud that dazed the little fellow, and he was not able ·to make up for this unfortunate occurrence until the last minute of play, when he took a long looping toss from Cad- wallader in the end zone to bring The Garnet showed their real su- periority, however, in the second half. On a beautifully executed \sleeper play\ after the kick off, 'Thomas caught Bob Terhune's 25 yard pass and galloped unmolested, .the remaining 20 yards for a touch- down. A short while later with their backs to the goal line, the R. P. I. cubs attempted a kick which was blocked by Amazon and recovered by the Engineers on their five yard marker. On their next attempt to .punt, Abbey stepped out of the end zone for a safety. Union opened up on its first pos- session of the ·ball with a completed pass. Of the 18 forwards tried dur- . ing the contest, five were com- pleted for a total of 85 yards. In ,;pite of a few hurried sky-ward passes, Captain Charles Krull was successful at the throwing end. Likewise two southpaws, Ernie Brown and Emery Burton, tried their hands at the art, and sue-' ceeded, one of the latter's throws going to Van Waldron in the end zone for a score. Krull was at his best as placement kicker. He was hindered by bad passes, but he made every extm try good. present record. Second LOSS· T.he Trojan vict<>ry makes the second close contest the Union team has suffered this season. The opening meet of ·tbe present fall schedule with the University of Ver- mont was annexed by the New Eng- landers with a .three,point margin. Saturday's 27 to 2.9 loss is even harder to swallow. 'The Engineers, however have one of the best teams in their history and Union's defeat was a:nything but a disgrace. the score to 9-6. It is now being whispered that the Electricals are not content with losing to their friendly rivals, but are on the verge of challenging them to a second contest. to be played on Friday. This would be meat for the Civils, who boasted after last week's triumph that they could take the \Circuit Breakers\ an easy two straight, even though their rivals did threaten to \load up\ with some new stars. A 45 yard run by Thomas in the final stanza was halted on the 10 yard stripe, and after two incom- pleted passes into the end zone, R. P. I. received the ball. Complet- ing one pass for a first down, the Cherry and White fresh then booted the ball for a total of five yards on a hurried punt. A series of line plays once again brought the Union cubs across the R. P. I.

INTRAMURAL ATHLETICS Tennis It is beginning to seem highly improbable that the tennis finalists will play the deciding match on college grounds, a fact due, of course, to the general sogginess and barrenness of the courts. However, (!!'ritz Hawley and Marvin Dwore, the two remaining players out of a field of approximately sixty, have decided to wait until tomorrow to determine just what to do about it. If the courts by some miracle do become playable, they will be used. If they remain as they are, there still remain two alternatives: the choice of using the cement courts of Prof. Achilles, or the more prob- able selection of the gym as the place of combat. Each has its sev- eral disadvantages; the cement court, in that it is harder on the players as well as the balls, the gym, in that the use of the lob is curtailed to a great extent, and that it provides a faster playing sur~ face. The choice of a court is, natur- ally, entirely up to the players, and they will probably make their choice tomorrow. Let's hope the match Ls played on the campus, b!l- cause there are many who are de- sirous of seeing it, for there are no other two players in the college more evenly matched, and there should be displayed some clever and exciting tennis. Hawley, you will recall is the present titleholder, and Dwore is the freshman champ who eliminated McGee in his climb to the finals. Each has had a good deal of experience, so there is no ·predicting a win for either. Two Way Tie Result of Selections At the end. of the fourth week of picking the winners, Al Stev- enson .and Van Trumbull are. all knotted up with thirty-four cor- rect selections out 00' a total of forty-four games. Milt Bedell is hanging on with a totlal of thirty-three winners. The games at•e becoming harcier and the race is becomin:g tighter.

The visitors took an early lead and the frosh were never able to concentrate their men in scor- ing positions. Coach Ketz's yearlings usually run much better in the practice runs held each week than they did Saturday. They literally \blew up\ in their encounter with the Trojans. Frank Myers put on the best show for the fresh and showed a great improvement over his previous per- formances. He finished second to the R. P. L leader in 16:04. Den- ton was the next Union man to fin- ish in a low-scoring place for the Garnet .He came in behind two op- ponents in 16:25 for fifth position. Thompson's inability to keep in the van· was entirely due to his in- jured leg. It is commendable that be had the nerve and spirit to even finish the tough and gruelling run. Inex:perience also probably had a lot to do with the l'Unning of the first year team. Having only en- gaged in the one meet with Nott Te1race previous to Saturday's race. the frosh are totally without experience as far as cross-country· running in college goes. With more runs behind them and more assur- ance it is entirely possible that they will come up to winning calibre. Rourke, R. P. I., finished the three-mile course in 15:59, excellent time for the Union run. The rest of the runners finished in the fol- lowing order: Myers (U). 16:04; Driscoll <RPI), 16:13; Fulson (R:PI), 16:20; Denton (U), 16:25; .Mitchell (RPI), 16;34; Duggan , (RPIJ,; Ossen <RPI); Sheffer (U); Eaton (U) ; Shugg (U); Thomp- son (U).
