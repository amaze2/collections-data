This is all very interesting, but I fail exactly·' t0 perceive where these polysylla-; bic phrases refute my former posi-. tion. It is one thing, for example, to caH Stalin a. \damned Commun- · ist\ but quite another to disprove the validity of Socialistic doctTin.e. So I wish to point out to these gen- tiemen that their remarks con.cern- · ing me have only strengthened the conviction which I maintained be- fore. I must admit that I was rather amused at some of the arguments · presented by the gentlemen who , criticized my position on the matter. One attempted refutation, especial-· ly, interested me. The author of letter signed \Anonymous\ remark- ed that the student guilty of cheat- ing is a fine fellow outside of the classroom. I quote from his letter, \But when one kn.ows the character and ethics that this man displays during the twelve or so hours when he is not in class are of a fine type and in part even enviable, one re- serves any judgment from finality.\ This type of argument reminds me of the Chicago ganster who brained a vival beer ~baron with a baseball bat and then was excused on the grounds that he was goad to his dear old grandmother. There is, however, one thing that I cannot comprehend about the trio of writers. My letter maintain.ed tlte thesis that we should not forget or f0rgive. Though the three critics disagree with men in their letters, their actions are not consistent with their expressed views. If they actually believed in forgetting the \sin\ of a brother, why in the name of Socrates, do they insist on smear- ing the whole affair over two pages of The Concordiensis ? If I sincerely harbored their opinions, the publi- cation of those letters would have been the last thing to enter my mind. For certainly, the airing of this matter in. the college paper is not conducive to forgetfulness. Without further comment, how- ever, I want to make my stand clear. In the first place, my attack against the student guilty of cheat- ing was secondary. My main inter- est was in refuting the sentiments ex:pressed by Dean Ellery, for it is my opinion that they are counter to the empirical world about us. Granted, it is a fine star to shoot at, but it must be remembered that we are not going to be cast into any hypothetical and ideal world. The bread and butter motive will predominate. We are thrust into a society and must conform to its dic- tates or else suffer the consequences. In short, it is my contention that, if necessary, the individual should suffer if tha.t suffering benefits so- ciety, at large. If one individual or a minority must be crushed and the crushing process is advantageous to great numbers of people and is a hindrance to further undesirable activity, that individual or group should be stamped out as though it were a disease. If they can be re- claimed and made useful again, so much the better; I am the first to accept this idea. But to simply for- get and forgive the ''unfortunate mistake\ of another in a Christian- like manner is, in my mind, an ab- surdity. Our civilization is not built REGNI~ER'S 232 STATE ST.

CAREY, Pro:p. 600 Union Street Phone 4-1123 , the Hfe @f the evening's songs and presented an amusing burleque on the broadcast of a 'radio program, ,,-------------------------------.., it was this group who 'brought forth Union's latest musical find. It was unfortunate that the audience was not abl·e to hear more of this :voice, for it displayed its melodic ' beauty only in a few measures of one of the songs sung by the quar- tette. The voice referred to is that ' of James Horan, '34, baritone mem- ber of the \Revilers\. This is the first time that Horan has sang a ! solo part locally. We certainly hope that it will not be the last. He pos- esses a certain whine which is an attribute to any singer and there are a mere few who can be proud of this boast. Horan certainly ought to pvogress far with such a voice and may it be the good for- tune of Union musical enthusiasts to hear his voice as the soloist dur- ing the next two years . Henry Froehlig, '32, leading the club for the last time appeared as the baritone soloist and rightfully earned all of the applause which he ' received after singing his two pro- gram songs and two popular en- cores. Those who attended are now aware of the fact why Professor Tidmarsh chose \Home On The Range\ as the song to teach the student body. Mr. Froelllig most ably sang this cowboy lYTiC whose melody filled the campus all day Friday. Violin Quartette Plays The other point of interest on the program was the violin quartette featuring George Van Wert, '32, Prince Oleson, ~34, David Locke, '34, and Alan Stewart, '35. The quar- tette played the \Air\ from Gluck's opera \Orpheus\ and a \Rondo\ by Julius Eichberg. .As their principal work, the group at:~sisted by HEmry· Froehlig presented a five part ar- rangement of the negro spiritual \Deep Rive·r\ by Edward Mates, '34. Mates, a pre-medical student, de- votes much of his leisure to the study of music and has produced ; some extraordinary work in the fields of composition. This arrange- ment iH not a simple one by any means and shows that the arranger is familiar with all the essential points of harmony and counter- point. Both appear frequently in the arrangement. The Club concluded the program with the singing of the \Dutchman · Song\ and then all faculty and ' alumni were called forward to sing many of the college songs ending • with the \Song To Old Union\ ..

For Lucky Strike has dared to mention things that were con- sidered .. taboo,. in the cigarette trade. You may have noticed a striking avoidance generally of the word ••inhale\ in cigarette advertising. Why? Goodness only knows! For everybody inhales-knowingly or unknowingly! Every smoker breathes in some part of the smoke he or she draws out of a cigarette. That's why it's all-important to be certain that your cigarette smoke is pure and clean-to be sure you don't inhale certain impurities. Do you inhale? Lucky Strike has Jared to raise this vital question -for it gives you the protection you want ••. because certain im- purities concealed in even the finest, mildest tobacco leaves are removed by Luckies' famous purifying process.

He is particularly famous for his piano co1npositions, and also for considerable orchestral and -cham- ber music. Much of his music has a strangely exotic charm. He has a horror of the obvious in melody, harmony and even in orchestration. His skill in pictorial writing is very marked.

These courses may be taken in the depart- ments of b1ology, chemistry, geol- ogy, matllematics, physics and psy- cho'logy. Education courses offered by the department of psychology shan be excluded. A stud-ent shall take at least two of the ·five courses in one depart- ment .and the head of that depart- !nent shall supervise the major wNk of that student.

The new syatem provides advan- tages not ()DIY for pre-medical stu- dents, 1>11t also for all academic students h:y allowing those interest- ed in science to direct their study in whichever direction t:hey choose. For example, a student specializing in biology formerly took four courses in that department. Now:, by majering in science, he neec'L on- ly take .two biGlogy courses with other scientific subjects. On the other ha11d, he may, if he chooses, elect all .five courses in the biology departmen.t as preparation for a medical school. -----0---- Rev.

Lacrosse CAMPUS S:portop,ics By JOE S:AIDEL ~ 001\llPARATIVE SCORES'- If Syvacuse ,beat Union 7-1, and if Rochester beat Syracuse 7-3 in its opener, what are the proba\ .J:>Hities that Rochester is favored in Saturday's ball game witl:l the Garhet? :Regardless of the high- er matnema:ties involved, the comparative scoring easily indi- cates who shauld be on the wrong end~according ·to figures. But sometimes Coach Hatfield and his nine disregard the mathematical comparisons and just go out to win. Lee Henehan, Yellow Jacket pit- cher, kept the Hillmen's seven safe 'blows well scattered, while the Rochester sluggers showed their prowess from the first inn- i:Ug on. In the eighth the YeHow Jackets crossed the plate six times, but~the runs were un- earned. There lies U11ion's chances for sh0wing up compar- ative scoring as an unreliable barometer. Rocl:lester did, however, send the pellet riding nearly a dozen times in the eighth. Adding in- sult to injury,. she stole four bases. Combined with several Syracuse errors, the earned and unearned bases piled up into a large lead. OLYMPIC GRUNTERS- Leonard Horwin, U. C. L. A. Cor- respondent, has much to say con- cerning the wrestling events in the Olympics this summer. Es- pecially interesting are his com- ments on \The College Monop- oly,\ which follow: \Ever since the national inter- collegiate tournaments were be- gun four years ago, non-college wrestlers have- been non-exist- ent as far as the American Olym- pic Team was concerned,\ says Dave Jones, wrestling coach of the L. A. A. C. \According to all indications, our team in 1932 will be overwhelmingly collegi- ate.\ Oklahoma Aggie and Mechan- ical college-home of Coach Gal- lagher, science-professor turned coach, of whom his star pupils, Van Bibber, Caldwell, and Beery- man of the L. A. A. C. say, \the fellows look upon Coach Galla-- gher as a god,\- will alone have five first-class Olympic prospects. There is Pearce in the bantam- weight class, puny-looking but greased lightening in the ring; Razor in the featherweight and in his first competitive year; Caldwell, defending A. A. U. champ in the welterweight; Mc- Guirk and Van Bib'ber, also A. A. U. champ and three-time inter- collegiate victor in the middle- weight. Lewis of Oklahoma uni- versity, weighing 172 pounds in football season, and reduced to 147 for wrestling, is 1932 colleg- iate champion in the lightweight class. When the Oltlahoma boys are satisfied-Belshaw of Indiana university (featherweight) Go- ings of the same alma mater (lightweight) ,:Oougovito of Mich- igan university (welterweight), Hess of Iowa State (middle- weight), Blosser of Ohio univers- ity (lightweight), and Jack Riley (heavyweight), intercollegiate winner for two years and all- Amencan Northwestern univers- ity tackle in football season- these gentlemen are ready for all comers, foreign and domestic, out to repeat and add to the worl{ of Allie Morrison (feather- weight) who won the lone Amer~ ican wrestling victory in the 1928 Games. BRING ON THE SPORTS- '£he. \merry month of May\ brings delight . to campus sports followers. With one-third of the month already past, there are still twenty-two events to come before June. Five of them are homes' tilts in baseba:Il, with two trips; the stickmen will be here for three contests, going away for a fourth; the Garnet runners ·still have two home meets and a !'rip; the netmen will see action in three home events, including the Intercollegiates 1 and go· on the road for another contest; and the linksmen will divide four matches into home and trip games. :ay Aii The SchE guests off or.gan reci· This groul have atterr singhig or! dertaken. old sixteen folk songs the group 1 0f color h: the superb .the six sin The sext .[u their fir a SQRg W voices in · distinctive .important other part1 sung witho an instrurr of counte1 singers did Iections m heard singi The seco: fl>lk songs the \·a capJ iment) met melody ch the first so and the re: group sin chords har ody.

FIFTH AVENUE AT FORTY -SIXTH STREET \ELECTRIC BULLETS\ T HE result of exhaustive wind-tunnel tests of conventiona I trolley car models revealed that at speeds of 70 and 80 miles per hour, 70 per cent of the total power was consumed in over- coming air resistance. Streamlining saves approxi- mately 20 per cent of the power. When the Philadelphia and Western Railway Company decided to replace its cars with Faster and more efHci ent equipment, it chose \electric bullets''- new streamlined cars-each powered by 4 G-E 100-hp. motors. The cars, constructed of aluminum aHoy, with tapered noses and tails, are much lighter in weight and capable of greater operating efficiency. In developing transportation apparatus, college-trained General Electric engineers have conducted extensive tests to improve oper- ating conditions. On land, on sea, and in the air, to-day's equipment is safer, swifter, more dependable, and more comfortable. 95·922 GENERAL. ELECTRIC SALES AND ENGINEERING SERVI~E IN PRINCIPAL CITIES -

''Made-to-measure'' service for business Whether the business is small or large- the corner grocery or the refrigerator factory -requirements for telephone service vary. So, to meet special conditions, Bell System men custom-fit the service to the subscriber. They worked out a telephone conference plan for a large manufacturer. Every Friday, at spedfied times, each district manager calls the home office, where telephone facilities are so arranged that the chief sales executives are on the line simultaneously. Problems are dis- cussed, decisions given. In minutes, the ex- ecutives cover the country. This plan lowered selling costs, raised efficiency, helped the user to increase profits 31 o/o in a year's time. By making the telephone more useful, Bell System men contribute to the success of many industries. BELL SYSTEM A NATION-WIDE SYSTEM OF INTER-CONNECTING TELEPHONES

The p0rtrait is by Ernest L, Ipsen. The est8iblishment of Prize Day, college officials declare, is for the purpose of awarding as many as possible of the student prizes for scholarly excellence in the presence of the entire student body, instead of at Commencement, which is primarily an affair for the seniors and their invited guests. It is to honor the successful contestants in a more public fashion than hitherto, and thus to emphasize the impor- tance of the prizes and the fact that they exist for the benefit of the un- dergraduates. ---+---- Junior Pt·om is Gala Feature of the Year twice to annex the set at 6-3. • I mean that which contributes to P12E'S'IDENT Berger Spikes Last-Minute Bally the health, ha uuiness, and comfort The class of 1933 will usher in Berger, however, was decidedly of the individual, and the g.roup to next week the gala event of the the better player, proving his. ex- which he belongs; by evil that o.·I Portrai•t of Presi·d·ent Arthur w· ···I· I year, the Junior Prom, Many perience during the fourth and last· which leads to disease, ultimate un- · · • . · · · ' · · · · · ' · ·. · · ' ·.

Results WiU Be Known When Mem:bers Are Tapped Moving-up Day Yesterday morning a special stu- dent body meeting was held in Memorial chapel for the purpose of electing the new Student Cou!lcil for next year. The meeting was in charge of the present Council. Printed ballot slips were given to each student. On the :ballots for the present Junior class were eight- een names, two of these names are to be automatically carried over to the n,ex:t CouncU, whi:le· the class was· instructed to vote for eight of ·the remaining sixteen. 'On the Sophomore ballots were seven names., one being carried over to next year's Council, with the class voting for three of the re- maining names. The Freshman ballots contained six names, with instructions to vote for three men. The results of the elections will be known on Moving-up Day when those men elected to the Council will be tapped by the present Stu- dent Council. On the ballot for the. Class of '33 the names of Ashmore Mitchell and · Thama.S Finegan were carried over, and these men are to be on next year's Council. The remaining eight members were voted upon from the followi:n.g list: Gerard Barnett, Peter Bavisotto, John Dearstyne, William Eldred, Julius Emspak, ,Frank Higgins, Robert Murray, ·'Donald Nitchman, James Young, Frederick Dill, Ernest Capelle, Weld Schoonmaker, William Bail- ·ey,· Clark Prather, James Faulisi, and Thomas Wade.

Already Sold For Performance of Pt~om Play The advance sale of tickets for \Androcles and the Lion\ which the Mountebanks will produce next Friday and Saturday night as the :r?gular Jt,mior Prom production opened yesterday with a healthy sale of tickets at the News bureau, according to the Graduate Mana- ger. Already about 150 seats have been .sold. More students are com- ing on Saturday night than in the . past y'ears, the· sale indicated. Although Bernard Shaw's \An- drocles and the Lion\ is a comedy and filled with satire, there is nev- ertheless a strong central idea be- hind the play which gives a large cast unusual opportunities for do- ing a fine piece of character acting. The play is really an expression of Shaw's views on the eternal con- flict between innovator and \Have- and-Holder\. \Androcles and the Lion\ does not attack or satirize Christianity, as some have thought, nor does it make fun of the Christ- ian martyrs, although they furnish the material for much of the com- edy of the play. · ALLIANCE-FRANCAISE LEC'l'URE A lecture on \Brittany\ was de- li\'ered last night in the Old chapel by Professor Andre Morize, profes:- sor of French literature at Harvard university. This lecture was the third and last of a series of free public lectures sponsored by · the Alliance Francaise of this city,

Ball Team Loses Te Williams, 12-3 Purple Nine ·Slugs Way to Victory; Hamiltmt Here Tomorrow After five innings· of tight, :smart baseball, Lyle Meredith,. slab a;rtist of tbe varsity baseball' team, weak- enf>d; and the Williams nine swat- ted hard to gain a 12-3 victory in a game .played Wednesday- afternoon at Williamstown. Union's inability to ·hit in .the pinches,. coupled with a plentiful number ()f errors and pooc base- running caused the defeat. On the other hand, Filley, Pm::ple twirler was not given very steady su,pport, but timely hitting, which included two h0me runs, counteracted this shortco~in3'. Dill and Campbell fielded well for the Garnet, the former- throwing out two men at home an(l another at second, and the latter accepting nine hard fielding cha.nces with only ot)e misplay,. Tomorrow the Garnet wiU stack up against the Buff-and-Blue nine of Hammon college at &:00 o'clock on Alexander field. No .change is expected in the Garnet line-up, ex- cept that Dill will pitch. As Hamil- ton will bring a weak-hitting nine which .does not present an enviable record, a. victory is predicted for the Garnet.

NH ••• wonder why cigarette advertising generally avoids this question? O NE of the mysteries in cigarette advertising has been the apparent fear of the word \inhale.\ It seems rather foolish-for everybody inhales- wheth.er they realize it or not ... every smoker breathes in some part of the smoke he or she draws out of a cigarette. Think, then, how important it is to be certain that your cigatette smoke is pure and clean-to be sure that you don't irihale certain impurities. Do you inhale? Lucky Strike has dared to raise this vital question ... because when you smoke Luckies your delicate membranes get the protection no other cigarette affords. All other methods have been made old-fashioned by Luckies' famous purifying process. Luckies created that process. Only Luckies have it! Do you inhale? Of course you do!

This senior honor•ary soeiety was installed. £tl Union College in 1906, by a. group of industrious sen- iors who saw ·the need for such au orga11izatjon. The Terrace Council consisted o.f .the seven outsta.nding men of t:be senior class until Dean Garis suggested ha.vjng eleven membet~s 1n hopes of making the Council mor-e 1·epresentative. This year we have 1·educed the numher of new Councilmen to sevEn, in view o·f the .f.act that the recently institt:thd Student OounclL has ta- ken over t:he affairs of student govenm1ent. It is our privilege to deliv.eJ' fhe charge to you new members. Our one plea is that :you do not allow the Terr-ace Council to d·escend to oblivion. The fact that the new Stud:ent Coun- cil has taken over ma.ny of you1· former duties should be no reasen tor the 'r.err:ace Cbuncil to become extinct. There is every opp.:>rtunity for you to make the Council mean even more than it ha:s in the. past. You have been chosen as repre~>entative men of Union College and can do a great <leal for· your Alma Mater in that capacity. We wish to congratulate you a.nd W.ish you every success for the coming year in the deter- mination .of your policy and the m-ea11s to be. used in carrying it ()U t. THE CONOORDlENSIS, A Col·umn ,Of c·olum:ni,sts These are the rogue.s who have been respcmsible for the year~s work in this column. It is th~ :produe·t df thelr heads, or what have you that has been responsi·ble for the many hurt feelin•gs or h.appy thoughts radiated through these semi-week~y outbur,sts. JAMES FOOTE James Foote, better known as \Ice~boat Week-ender\ alias \On·e Mug Catarac.\ Jimmy has been much concen:ted over a certain trip back fro:m .Saratoga and has done m.uch to make the· 'ranch' popular. Another pet subject was J'immy's aversion. .to undergraduate literary effort, espedally when it is painful. A columnist of columnists who has seldom to. be reminded of writing. In the heat of the battle of thought (or pa~sion) due to t11e latest dea·l or 'fast one,' James can click. Un- scathing ~e:dticism,. he maintains, can d.o more to remedy a situation than the. old Terrace Council. Stan, known to his friends and enemies as \Wop and at Saratoga as \Union's Gift to .Skidmore,\ is wha>t we may term a b{)oster. His loyalties mix.ed, Wop fought all year to maintain the dignity of the north region and save it from the unscathing remarks of his col'- league. Stan is what we may term the minute columnist~one minute asleep, the next a columnist. W.e poked him out every Friday morn to get his contribution to literary effort. A \stewedent every bit of it. STANLEY COSTALES Pierce is a self-made columnist, a painter, a:nd somewhat of a man with the women. His careful ob- servations from his window in the Sig Place are responsible for sev- eral things not passing unnoticed. In fact, it was Pierce who fit·st noticed the young lady in pajamas running through the- campus. He is a painter as 'well as g politician, a:Jthoug'b he sel(lom refers to the latter talents; he leaves that tO\ the defeated office-seekers. C. L. P. T. has graced the Tuesday column, sharing it with the aforementioned Ic~boatil).g Cossack fl\om upstate. CHARLES L •. P. TOWNSEND Pinch-hitting for the \Wop\ on odd days- when the trip home took sixty minutes, Larry gained the title of Snort. His comments on college life as he views it from the Beta house gave the old column a new sla:nt on things and took the favorite subjects from our minds. A select variety, sour grapes and all. Wheh not writing columns, he amuses himself with horseshoes, or in taking lessons in contract bridge. The entire group has joined hands to enter in the campus-wid.e search for Dr. Day, in fact \Wop\ went north to solicit the aid of Skidmore in solving the mystery .of the missing president. ., Our e.stimates please Our serv1ce saiiisf.ies THE C,az;etfe ·Prei·S· · .

Go On Rule Breaking Rampage Student Council lnvestig~tes PtofessionaUsm Cha1·ges Against Athletes According to a recent investiga- tion by the Student Connell, it was: found that several members of the facility have· been breaking the rules and .regulations governing: activities. A complaint was mad,e to the council aHeging that Profes- sor Ernest Ligon was elected cap-' tain o:f the faculty baseball team as the result of a deal. Subsequent inquiry disclosed that the whole team has been violating the regu- lations imposed on me111bers of Union College teams. In the first place. norte of the fac- ulty nine are officially registered in . Union Colrlege in -an undergraduate course leading to a degree, All of the participants are guilty of viol- .ating this rule. In addition sev- eral members of the faculty nine. have been in c6lleg.e for less than a year; and therefore are eligible to compete only in freshman ath- . · letics, while other- of the faculty bantossers have been here for more than eight semesters which like- Wise renders them ineligible to . participate in Union College ath- letics. IJgon-~as ·Smith A Searching inquiry into the am- ateur standings of the faculty • nine is being .conducted at present It Is believed that several of the players were formerly wi~h the New York Giants, and it is sus-. pected that Captain Ligon at one time pitched for the Cardinals un- der the name of Smith. It is al- most certain that Mr; Enzer, Who employs his extensive knowledge of athletics to distribute news of Union Colrlege sports to various newspapers, has seriously violated the amateur rulings of the U.
