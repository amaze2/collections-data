Or, should you ad- dt·ess, attend a labor meting, or own pt·operty whereon such a meeting is held, you will find. yourself again among the chosen 'few'. This was the substance of the Dunckel Bill proposed to Michigan Legislature. The Bill was not only pt·oposO'd but almost immediately passed by the Senate and declared constitutional by the Attorney General. And, unless Governor Fitzgerald has been sufficiently dis- suaded by demonstrations, scores of letters, and the pleas of four men on behalf of 4-50,000 Michigan work- ers, the Dunckel Bill has been sign- ed and is now a law. This act is a severe challenge to latbor in the form of a campaign to outla-w all forms of protest against conditions in America. Ostensibly, strikes are exempted from the pro- vision of the Bill, appealing thus to the mass, seeming to be m~~orely a program for annihilation of rad- icals. But, unfortunately-, even lab- orers nowadays have a degree of in- telligence and thus were able to as- <'ertain the real purpose of the Bill. Its significance is that every mili- tant striker can tbe sent to prison in the event that the Bill becomes a law. However, we wonder what verdict would be forthcoming should a case ~e brought up to the Supreme Court.

College to Offer Special Lectures in Engineel'ing Divisional Plan Makes Rapid Stl'ides in IntegTation of Various Courses Operating for the first full year under the divisional plan, the Divi- sion <Jf Social Studies has made rapid strides toward the much-talk- ed-about but seldom achieved in- tegration of economics, government, history and philosophy in a single progr-a1n of study. This ;year's freshmen were the first to take two historical survey courses in the division, one dealing with \Introduction to Social Insti- tutions,\' such as industry, prop- erty, government, war, religion, and the family; and the other with ''History of Western Civilization.\ In the sophomore year, the new curricul urn has centered rubout two things: realistic descri·ptions of present-day society and its major Opportunities for the practical economic and political issues; and study of advanced mechanics, heat tested methods of attack in invest- en\ines and mechanical design igating and unraveling typical wttich could be duplicated in only a social problems.

Under the new course, students are given. the opportunityto choose elective work more suited to their individual desires and capacities, optional courses talting the place of :previc()usly required advanced mathematics and mechanics. After taking ~ertain basic courses, the student :may elect advanced work in one <>r more technical fields. Building construction courses have been revised, and several confer- ences and lectures arranged with practicing engineers from large companies in this vicinity. The student branch of the A. S. C. E. has bad an active year, and much work \Was done arranging education exhibits of civil engineer- ing for sub-freshman week-end, and the historical exhibit last fall. In the field of research, Professor Mortimer F. Sayre has been very active, publishing two papers on the phm:-og:raph method in velocity calculati<>ns in the Journal of Machine Design. Dr. Sayre also helped to develop new high-pre- ci::Jion spring scales, A paper de- scribing this work was presented at the annual meeting of the A. S. M:. E. Dl\.

One new instructor was engaged in the field of modern languages, Dr. Roland B- Myers, to take the place of Dr. FranJt Coe Barnes who died on November 30. Professor Robert W. Crowell, and Mr. Fernand Jagu, long asso- ciated with the field o! modern languages, will reti.re from active teaching because of age at the end of the college year. To replace them, Dr. Fox recently announced the appointment of Dr. George H. Danton, now professor of German at Oberlin College, and Mr. George B. Raser, instruct<>r of romance languages at Harvard University. Dr. Danton will have lhe rank of full professor and will be in charge of the field of modern languag(·t:>, Mr. Raser will be an instructor. Dr. Burges John~on, well-known writer and journalist, and formeily professor of English at Vassar College and Syracuse Univetsity, has been added to the English staff. Dr. Johnson will teach com- position, and will head the field of English with the ranlt of full pro- fessor. Dr. Overton Luhr of tl1e field of physics was awarded a grant of $375 from the National Research Council which he used to buy ap- paratus for his experiments with doubly charged helium ions. To carry out his thermochemical measurements of anhydrous amonia Dr. Frederic C. Schmidt received grants from the Sigma Xi Society and from the American Academy of Art:tl and Sciences. His 1 esearch is to determine energies of chemical reactions and energies involved in the formation of substances. Dr. Charles B. Hurd's research on the conductivity of silicic acid gels has been materially aided by a grant from the National Research Council, and he expects the work will be nearing completion in a year's time. In the field of mathematics, Dr. Orin J. Farrell has published t\Wo papers on mathematics in recent numbers of t~chnicfll journals in that field. His worlt has chiefly dealt with studies of analytic func- tions of polynomials. Augustus H. Fox has completed his thesis for a doctor's degree at YaiQ entitled \Differential Equations with Con- tinuous Spectra.\ ---o--- ical design course.

Clark, Loomis or Griswold may be called to pitch for the varsity, and Stevenson, Brown, Fiore, Reed, Cadwallader, Loomis, Semerad, and Griswold will compose the rest of the nine. Garnet Beats Hamilton The Garnet ball tossers closed their season with six wins, two losses and whatever they do tomor- row against the Alumni. After lacing a highly touted Williams out- fit on Alexander Field, the Dutch- men travelled to Clinton and beat the Hamilton College ball tossers by a five to three count. The day was a cold, windy one which made good .playing almost impossible, and the Continentals owere hot on the trail of the Dutchmen throughout the game. George Clark went the route and got better as he went !Wong, allowing the home team but three hits for their afternoon's work. Union was the first to score when Mike Fiore reached first on an er- ror and came home on Jim Loomis' grounder after having stolen sec- ond. Two ·more runs ca;me home for the Dutchmen in the fourth when Ernie Brown and Dave Cad- wallader singled, and Bob Reed got to first on an error by the third .baseman. Ralph Semerad singled to open the fifth, stole second and came home on Fiore's single. Gar- net scoring ended in the seventh inning when Jim Loomi::> singled, went to second on Brown's fly and came home on Stevenson's single. Hamilton Scores 2 Runs Hamilton forged Into the lead in the third inning when they pushed a run across in •both the second and third frames. Bicknell wallted to open the second, went to second and third of fielder's choices and scored on White's single. In the third Sliter singled, went to second on a fielder's choice, third on an error when Bicknell's grounder was misplayed and he reached first on an error. The Buff and Blue saw home plate for the last time in bbe fifth inning, Sliter reaching first on an error, stealing second and third and coming home on another error. Ernie Brown led his team mates in the batting column with three hits out of five trips to the plate and while practically every member of the line-up also accounted for one hits. Clark allowed three hits and issued but two free tickets to first, being credited with his second win in as many starts. First Loss 2-1 The Dutch.men then travelled to Rochester and met with disaster in the form of tneir first defeat of the year in a return engagement with the Yellowjackets by the score of 2--1.

Captain Scotty McNabb playing at coverpoint, Joe Agius at point, Crabbe Thomas at goal, Stan Mower on the attack, Hugh Elwyn on the defense, and Frank Connelly on the defense will be doing their last duty on the team .this morning. The probable starting lineup for the varsity will •be Thomas as goalie, Agius at point, McNab at coverpoint, Kennedy at first de- fense, Liffiton at second defense, Fraser or Knox at center, Bergman at second attack, MacMurray at first attack, Smith at outhome, and Vandecar at inhome. ----•0·---- RESUME OF 1935 SEASON .An eventful and important la- ·crosse season will be closed this !llorning when the varsity ten meets the Alumni in the annual conuftencement battle. Marked with losses throughout the entire season, the record of the stick wielders seems an unimportant one. Nevertheless, the fact that an al- most entire sophomore group, with n1any players who have been handl- ing the crosse for only a year, composed the varsity and compet- ed against teams of national repute gives Union earnest of success with a veteran team for the next two year:o. Coach Harkness, who predicted ·in the begining of the season that with only three veterans of inter- collel)ate wars on the team Union 'vould have a poor season, believes that the foundation for a team like the one which took over the Na- tional Lacrosse Championship in 1929 has been built upon the hard ~chool of experience this year. Defeated M. I. T. 16-5 Union won one game and lost five, amassing a total of 45 points against its opponents' 61. The only victory was scored against M. I. T. on April 27 when the Dutchmen trounced the Tech team, 16 to 5. The lineup for Union has been composed entirely of sophomores on the attack, except for Hugo Bergman '36, who played one of the Inside offenses. Only two of the five men on the defense were other than sophomores in the regular lineup, Captain McNab and Joe Agiub playing the point and cover- point positions. . Sophomores Kennedy, Knox, Lif- flton, Marsella, Fraser, MacMurray, Potts, Smith, Tompkins, anad Van- clecar have been the mainstays of the Union teaam this year, built around the foundation of Agius, McNaab, and Bergman who played on the regular squad and Hugh Elwyn, Frank Connelly, Stan Mower, Crabbe Thomaas, and Ray R.obtnson of the second squad. Lost To Hobart Hobart opened the Union season by .scoring a victory over the Dutchmen, 11 to 4, on Ap:vil 20. The following week the Garnet out- played Massachusetts Institute 16 to 5, but suffered a loss in its next game, 4 to 1 at the hands of a ·veteran Swarthmore College ten on ,a m.uddy field, The best game of the season came on May 11 when Union lost in a thrill-packed con- test 17 to 11 to a national-raanking .Stevens Tech team. C. C. N. Y. next took the count of the Dutch- .men, 16 to 8, and the last inter- collegiate ·game of the season was lost to the Williams College team, 8 to 5. After holding the Purple even in the first half, the Dutch- men let up to allow the Wllliams- .town ten to score its winning three :points. The scoring this year has devel- oped upon two hard-working attack rnen, Jack Smith and Hal Vande- .car. Smith, who played in only four of the co11tests, averaged bet- ter than three goals a game, while Vandecar with five contests has averaged two points per .game.
