The walls of this college have long ago crumbled into silent dust, an<l only a stone or two remains to hint that once thet e was life. In this t•avine, the brook still. flows, but all is wildeiness, save for the tiny clearing around the giant elm-an open space, over- grown with moss and ivy. Let us kneel and brush away the leaves and dirt from the lit- tle mounds that ·fill the clearing. See! They are graves! '['be stones have toppled-they a1e grey with age-but who are these -who lie in this forgotten spot-dead, centuries past? This stone bears an epitaph-let us read it if we can. 'l'he char- acters are faint and hard to see. \No more shall Mr. Joseph T. Bradbury Upon this mortal sphere be blithe and merry. For many years he taught with envied prudence All Idnds of mathematics to his students. He died. And forty monkeys and a half Took twenty years to type this epitaph.\ Let us look at some other mounds. This one, under the leaves, bears this inscription: \Here lies the body of An- drew Dryburgh, lon.g respected as honorary fellow in thrift. 0 passing friend, Drew did not die. Far from his native Scotland he was cruelly cut off in the prime of life-he was kilt.\ How frail a thing, Iny listeners, is life! Behold these scattered graves and consider.

There are two reasons for such an in- crease. This past year the student tax was i>ased on 780 s tudents 1 but as only approxi- mately 760 students registered, the Tax Committee's revenue was appreciably re- du~ed. As last ,ve::~:r's budget was based on a hail·'s line away from twelve dollars, there was an unavoidable deficit. To add to this financial dilemma, the Junio1' :Ft·om Com- mittee incurred a debit of $2t7.94 which also had to be made up. It i:; use·less to analyze the reasons for such a deficit at this late date; but we sincerely hop€ that next year's Prom Committee will reeognize that ,vith the addition of the two All-College Danc::os and an lnterfratemity Dance to our social program, it ·is imperative t'llat they re- duce the total costs strenuous!~'· .j.f they are to make ends meet. '1'938-39 Student Tax Appropriations The student tax for 1938-39 will be $12.()0 per student based on an estlm!lte of 750 students it was anncmnced Thursday by Philip Ih:o:chscherer, chairman of the Student \Jlax Committee. This is an inerea.se of one dollar ovet· last year's ta:::x.

Dr. Be1·g·s tex thook on Opera- tional Analysis, published in 1929, has appeared in a second and en- la.rged edition.

ConnPctE>d With G_ E. Dr. Ber·g has also arranged in past yea1s to hav-e young engineers at the Generai Electric Compan~· take courses in the dppartments of Physics, Mathematics and Electri- cal Engineering as graduate work at Union. This practice was dis- continued during the depression years, however_ rn commenting upon Dr- Berg's 25th anniversary as teacher here, Dr. Frederick W.

He was made an associate professor at Union in 1927 and a full professor in 193L Dr. Hurd served as act- ing chairman of the chemistry de- partment in 1933-34 and was ap- pointed permanent chairman the following year. He is a member of Ta.u Beta Pi, Sigma Xi, the Ameri- can Chemical Association, and the American Association of University Professors_ ---0•--- Chemistry Department Completes Active Year The year 1937-38, just ending, has been unusually succes.sful for the Field of Chemistry. Certain features may stand out particular- lY', although of course the most satisfactory single feature has been the continuation of se!'ious instruction and research, both of a high standard, in this field of science. The announcement of the re- sults of last year's Freshman Co- operative Tests In Chemistry were especially gratifing, when an- nounced during the fall. The B. S. in Chemistry Freshmen of last year stood highe.st of any group tested, out of a total of over 10,- 000 students at about 200 colleges. Among the additions to the fac- ulty win be Dr. Walter c_ Lang- sam, noted historian of modern ·Europe, who will come to Union College as professor of history. President Fox announced the res- ignations of four members, the leave of absence of one, the ap- point of ·four, the l·eturn of three, and the death of one member of the faculty, as follows: B.esig-nation of: Henry Laureu<~(~ Achillt·R, l'h.
