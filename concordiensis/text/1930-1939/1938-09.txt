We fee 1 th .at in designating- l'nion as your future ~lrua l\Iater, you have made an exceptionally wise choice. We are pnmd of Union because of its high scholarship rating. its beautiful an<l spacious campus, the many opportunities it affords for extm-cunicular activities, and es}Jecially of the unusual air of comradeshiJ} that places Union in ~t class by itself. For the past ·week, you have leGtrned many things about U11i<m. You have been told of th.e requirements you must fn.lfill before you can appl,Y fo1· graduation, and <>f the numerous pitfalls that you must avoid be- fore you may reach your goal. However, we believe that on€ of the most sltlient points that you must t'ealize, is that you are no longet· a lordly senior ,to whom eve1·y t~espect is clue; but instead, a lowly freshman. You have entered a 11ew world, and so like an im- migrant from any- foreign country, you must cast off many- of your old habits and ideals and cond>ition you1·self to a new environment, if you desire a happy and fruitful existence here at Union. 3y this warning, we do not mean that it is necessary for yoa to be sub- servient to all the whims of .YOLU' elders in college status; bn t there at·e mans taboos to observe, attihules to be taken, and inhibi- tions to be set up. Therefore, if you desire a peaceful fresh1nan year, it win be to your advantage to inqnire what is expected <>f you from some up-perclassman, and then act ac- cordingly. We cann<>t for€tell what yom· individual fates are to be, we can only wish you all the luck in the world and hope that your brief sojourn at Unio11 wi~l be fill~d with many happy moments, .and m later hfe you can re- caH your und.ergraduate life \on the hill\ with few reg1·ets.

This system, as a whole, has been a success. All fraternities are put 011 their h(}llOI' to obey all rushing- regulations, and if any infringements can be proven, the guilty house is blacklisted. Usually an intel'- fraternity eouncil is set up to see that these I'Uies are carded out. If we ta.ke cognizance of the fact that Union is faced with a paucity of dom1it()l·y rooms and eating· facilities, and thus must depend upon the various greek letter soci- etie-s to take care of the overflow until such facilities can be el'ected, we must amend the above plan. It is not our intention to draw up a conciliatory program, this can best be done by the various fraternities through their representatives in the Interfraternity Council; but we do desire to see a closed sea- son of at least two weeks, beginning with registration week, on all pledging. In the interim, the freshmen, who are desirous of joining a fraternity, could reside at the fl'a- temities, as usual. If the neophytes moved from house t() house, ne1ther the fraternities nor the prospective pledg-ees would be stuck for long, and more impotiant, both parties would have ample time to narrow their selec- tions down before actual pledging cam- paigns, with their attendant high pressure tactics, began.

Award Garis Cup North College Wins Scholarship Prize In Dormitory Contest Thursday, Sept. 22 -Dean Charles F. J;~. Garis announced today that fraternities at Union last year es- tabli::;hed the best sch•Jlarship rec- ord in eleven years. The Kappa Nu frate1·nity was presented with the Berg Scholar»hip Cup for the foUI·th time since the cup was first offered by Dr. Ernst J. Berg in 1924. The Pyramid Club was runner- up to Kappa Nu for the second suc- cessive year, while Delta Chi jumped h·orn fifth place to third. The order of rank for the others was as follows: Theta Nu Epsil-on, Kappa Sigma, Phi Sigma Delta, Sigma Chi, Delta Upsilon, Delta Phi Alpha Phi Delta, Alpha Delta Phi: Chi Psi, Theta Delta Chi, Psi Upsilon, Lambda Chi Alpha, Ph~ Delta Theta, Kappa Alpha, Ph1 Gamma Delta, Beta Theta Pi, Sigma Phi, and Phi Sigma Kappa. Ga!'is Cup AJso Presented The Garis Cup, presented to the dormitory attaining tbe highest scholastic ave1·age, was won by the North College Dormitory, where 52 students lived last year, under the proctorship of Professor Edward S. C. Smith. South College placed sec- ond, and Oldgym Hall third. Dean Gar·is also announced that the non-fraternity students, who have traditionally led the fratermty members, were ahead by only seven one-thousandths of a point, the average for the neutrals being 2.490, and the average for the :fra- ternity members being 2.483. Kappa Nu established the re- markable record of 3.595 for an ac- tual average, to which was added the bonus of .1 for each of tbe 13 men in the chapter who achieved an average of 4.00 or more, thus making a Berg Cup t·ating of 4.895, the highest ever made since the competiti-on was established fifteen years ago. Dr. Ligon and his associates also offer six additional hours of special individual tests and surveys. Appli- cations for these tests ha.s been lim- ited to fifty students. This oppor- tunity has been taken up by over half that number already. These special testa require a fee of ten dollars to cov-er the costs of their preparation. Rapid Academic Rise in Langsam's Teaching Career everybody in the Front Street ---------------- The painting crew finished paint- ing the college fence along -Lenox Road and on Union Av-enue, as well as outside painting on several other campus buildings. The inter- ior of the North College Dormitor~ was r:epainted also, along with the first and second floors in the Gen- eral Engineering Building. The house at 628 Nott St. was made ready for Professor Langsam, and the house occupied by the late Dr. Cummins was re-decorated for Professor Bronner. Mally Changes from Last Year There were many changes in the Berg Cup standing of the fraterni- ties this year over that announced for· the 1936·37 period. Theta Nu Epsilon skyrocketed from 19th place to fourth place, while Sigma Chi jumped from 17th place to seventh. Theta Delta Chi, on tbe other hand, dropped from fourth place to 13th. Chi Psi jumped out of the cellar, from 21st to 12th po- sition, and Phi Sigma Kappa I'e- placcd t:hem: dropping- froiD. :14th place. Ot.hers moved in a less spec- tacular manner. . neighborhood.

Russell Deyo COI'Y DF~\K I<~DITORH I.a~l<ar ~t·h\\aJtz Friday, September 23, 1938 SCHOLARSHIP PAYS The studEnts, who attended daily assem- bly yestel\d~y along with those who read the story on the annual awarding of the Berg and Garis &cholarship Cups appeal'ing- in this issue of The Concordiensis, realize that Kappa Nu and North College carried off these trophies for the second time in as many consecutive years. Yet, we \oVonder, if these same students realize what sacrifices had to be made and what temptations over- come beforE the members of these organiza- tions could compile such enviable records. Union has frequently been criticized, and rightfully so, because of its over emphasis of the e:xtm-curricular side of college life. :i\Iany students are carrying three and four activities, the number of those who bolt classes is appalling, while many others skim through college by meeting only the mini- mum schol:~\rship requirements. Studying is seldomly resOI'ted to only after all the mm·e pleasut·e-se€king sides of college life have been investigated. At a glance, this anaemic approach to studying might seem to be the most profit- able. Us.ually the members of the Student Council, Ten·ace Council, and Garnet I<:ey are all men who have shown their worth on the football field or in some more gentle- manly activity as the Mountebanks or one of the s.evet·al college publications. Rarely does a man make one of these \select soci- eties\ on pure scholastic merit alone. Too often our criterion for judging a man's suc- cess in college is whether or not he is an outstanding man in extra-curricular activ- ities. We forget that after graduation, the business wo1·Id is not interested in whether we were \All-State Guard\ or Terrace Coun- cil; but instead in whether or not we can produce the de;;ired rewlts. Education and the ability to use our knowledge then be- come of pl'ime importance. It would seem advisable to discontinue our scornful attempts at derision whenever some person or gmup gains recognition for their scholastic ltc-hievE>menttl, and instead give them the desel'ved plaudits. We would like to take this opportunity to extend our hearty conjwatulations to the members of Kappa Nu and North College. Scholarship pays. \WE'LL BE THERE,\ FELLOWS on d sma rectangu ar pot o groun · In, newspapers announce a crisis.

Coaches \Nels\ Nitch1nan and \Duke\ Nel- son have drilled theiil' charges thoroug-hly,. and if injuries do not riddle the squad to ribbons, Union tootball PI'estige should re- g-ain some of its lost heights. Union will have several advantages over the Men from Maine. We are playing at home, our squad of thirty-seven men, four- teen more than last year, boasts more ma11 power than that of the visitors, and Coaches 1'-Jitchman and Nelson, beginning their thi·rd year of tutoring Garnet varsity elevens, can- not be classed as neophytes in the mt o! football tacticsand strategems. Yet, often the best-drilled football teams in the country have lost cont€sts, that they should have won, because of unfavorable psychological conditions. One of the most common failings of l.Jnion undergraduates ol late has been poor moral support behind the team. Our cheering has been disorganized' and spotty, and even when we did con- desce11d to give vent to our emotions, there was little heartfelt enthusiasm behind it. Tomorrow is the beginning of a new sports year, so let's get behind \Nels\, \Duke'' and the team, and show them we are behind them one hundred per cent, win, lose, or draw by cheering from start to finish. HAIL JENKINS Tomorrow we will have as our guests 100 members of the Schenectady Boys Club. To most Union undergraduates the Schenectady Boys Club suggests just another social <H- ganization; but a few l'ealize that it repl·e- sents the sac1·ifice and effort of one of Union's own sons, Rockwood Jenkins '37. Jenkins sacrificed what would have doul>t- less been a more profitable career, finan- cially, to go into the work of helping boys who have had few of the necessities and privileges of life. He is a young- man who possesses a very attractive personality and keen intelligence: there is not a question <lf doubt but that he would have done well in a more lucrative field <Jf work. But there are considerations that can not be measured in terms of money. So when Jenkins makes this sacrifice working for a nominal salary, he does it because he :r:eal~ izes that there is a spiritual recompe-nse, if we ma.r be so uncolleg'iate in using- the term, in knowing that he is making the world a >etter place in which to live. We at·e proud to have a young-er son of lJnion who is moved by such a fine altruistic spirit. The Schenectady Junior Chamber of Commerce has recognized his deeds in giv- ing him the annual chamber award, as one who has done much for Schenectady. R-e- cently Jenkins was listed in a \Who's Who Among- Younger Men ln America\ as one ()f the town's disting-uished citizens. We hope that this editorial can in some measure e:x- press our pride in having Jenkins a::; one <Jf Union's sons; we hope Union can p.roduce .nore men like him.

Monday and Tuesday Head Coach Nels Nitchman and Line Coacll. ·'Duke\ Nelson supervised long dummage scrimmages in- doors in Alumni Gym, and short contact scrimmages on a water- and-mud-laden Council Field, Wed- nesday's time was devoted entirely to running over plays insid<J.. For the first time in five days a thor- ough drill was conducted out-of- doors Thursday, when the second team opposed the freshmen. To- day's workout program was very light. There has been no great preparation for Colby's style of attack for a very logical reason. Colby's likely style is unknown. Coach Nitchman, however, did manage to warn his charges Wed- nesday against the strategy Colby may employ tomorrow, as some safeguard. Action for All Ray Lewis and Bill Busino will lineup at end; Augie Kluge and AI Halavin at tackle; John Krull and either Bill Lynn or Sumner Irish, at guard; Jim Mulcare, at center; Fred Patrie, at right half- back; either Merlin Brockrnyer or John . Vannier at left halfback; Captam Amazon, at quarterback; and Sam Hammerstrom, at full- back. Halavin was an \aUa\ man last year, while Vannier played with the freshmen. All Positions Open With the majority of candidates lacldng ex:perience, the greatest part of Coach Lawrence's pre-sea- son time wlll be spent in working on fundamentals, timing and block- ing. Few yearlings have distin- .gui:;hed themselves, leaving a wide- open fight for at least nine :berths. Bob Baker, at tackle, and Bob Davi~, at end, have shown the most promise to date. Backfield candidates include Lee Sherman, Bob Killion, Sherry HUe lick, Don Quigley, Allen Orton, Ed Enstice, Joe Mudge, Tom Parsons, Harry Stevens, David Clowe, and Clayton WLlliams. • Among the line hopefuls working out are John Shaw, Bob Davis, Fred ,Klotz:, Bob Hallenbeck and Joe Gautie, ends; Abe Dorsman, Bob Bake1·, and William Hill, tackles; Stew Goldblatt, John Mar- sicano, Waldo Strahan, Moe Fried- man, Ed Wantuch, Sol Bleckman, and Myron Mills, guards; and Bob Fitzpatrick and Ross Christiansen, centers.

In general he advised the first year men to choose no more than one extracurricular endeavor; then to \go in hard for that one.\ Finally Yunich warned against an overemphasis on the activities at the expense of marks and urged \a good margin of leisure\ and non- official recreation. In answer to the question, \How fast should a stu- dent plunge into the activities\?\, he simply urged, \There's no hurry;\ ----o----- Smith Ac:ld resses Dorm Residents On St.udy Speaking at a meeting of dormi- tory students in the Old Chapel yes- terday noon, Professor E. S. C. Smith, proctor of North College, encouraged the dormitory students to be mindful .of the Garis Scholar- ship CuJ> award, and to use their opJlortunities to study. Referring to North College's win- ning of the award for the past two years, Professor Smith urged a keen scholastic competition between the co-llege donnitori~s this year. He particularly suggested special effort on the part of Oldgym Hall, which has· not as yet won the cup. The students were also advised to secure their rooms carefully against any possible thievery. and were re- minded to use precaution against leaving their rooms unlocked. Pro- fessor Smith also recalled the rule goveTning the use of radios in the dormitories. The pr{)ctors for this year are: Professor Smith in North College, Mr. John A. McGuire in South Col- lege. and Stanley Luke, '39, in Old- gym Hall.

Bronner, who has returned to the campus after a summer tour throughout Europe. Dr. Bronner, accompanied by Mrs. Bronner and their son, Fred- erick, traveled through England, France, and Germany finding in each a pronounced military atmos- phere, although this in no way ihterferred with his sight-seeillg. Hoadley Institutes New Eqt~ipment For Builtlings Bells Will Si<;Jnal Endin<J of Class Recitations Because of i:he insistent student protest that professors kept their classes beyond.. the expiration time of the fifty mjnu.te period, the col- lege is installing gongs in each of its buildings ·to denote the end of classes, accord:mg to an announce- ment made :b-y Anthony Haadley, Comptroller.

The two ()ther plays chosen are Henrik Ibsen's \Rosmersholm and the recent Broadway success, \Brother Rat,\' by John Monks, Jr. and Fred Finkelhoffe. The Mountebanks accepted their first touring engagement, agreeing to play their- Spring production, \Rosmersholrn\, at the theatre of the Institute of History and Art in Albany so~ne time in March. Edward L. Carroll, beginning his tenth year a.s active director of the Mountebanks, proposed that the organization sponsor a series of motion pictures such as those provided by t.he ]);.1useum of Mod- ern Art film library. The Execu- tive committee is now studying which of the four series of films provided she>uld be rented for showing in the Old Chapel on five successive weeks during the win- ter. A small charge will be made to defray the rental fee. It has heen tentatively decided to inaugurate the motion pieture series with five programs of films which. will illustrate the develop- ment of motion pictures in Amer- ica. Some of the films include Sarah Bernhardt (in 'Queen Eliza- beth\) \The Great Train Rob- bery,\ \Faust pictures by D. W. Griffith, pictures with Mary Pick- ford, William S. Hart, Theda Bara, and other pOiJUlar stars of the past, a Mack Sennett comedy, abd then pictures which introduced the Ger- man influence and which led to the modern talkies of today. These in- clude \Hands by Stella Simon, and \Sunrise by F. W. Murnau. The first Mickey Mouse picture by Walt Disney and \The Last Com- mand,\ are also in the series. Lo!tJled Projector The motion picture projector owned by th.e Geology Department of the college has been graciously loaned to the Mountebanks by Pro- fessor Edwa.rd S. C. Smith to make possible the showing of the films. Council Announces Plans For All-College Dance The date for the first \All-Col- lege\ dance, to ·be known as the· \Gridiron Ball,\ has been set for· Saturday night, Nov. 19, David L.

The last two weeks of his vaca- tion were spent in Paris, whe:re, despite the tenseness and gravity of the situation, the populace ap- peared to be fatalistic about the matter, feeling that the war might as well come at the present as well as five years from now. 7 6 Fwsll Are Related to Union .4.l!.ntni; 26.7 P. C. Of Enteri:ng Class The 1\[ountebanks chose \The Adding Machine\ because of its effective satire oh machine a<>e, This internationally famous pl~y was first .produced by the Theatre Guild in New York. It deals with the life and death of Mr. Zero, a cog in the wheels of the modern machine ag-e. \ The Adding Ma- chine\ is considered to be the se- rious fore-runner of Charlie Chap- li~'s cinema satire, \Modern Times.\ The dance, which will climax the football season, will be one of a se- ries to be held throughout the year. The second will probably be held at the end of the mid-year exam pe- riod, Yunich said. An effort will be made to bring a name band for the affair, however, this will depend on how much stu- dent interest is manifested in the dance.

This is the Question being asked bv the man on the street today. We all hop~ that the olive bearing tactics of England's Prime ~Linister Neville Chamber- lain and France's Premier Edouard Daladier ,vill bear fruit; but many an experienced foreign observer believes the world is plung- ing into a second world-wide conflict. The zero hour has been set ten ta. tively for Satur- day, \vhen either Der Fueh.er's dernand.s must be met by Czechoslovakia or war would appeae imminent. The latest word ft·om Euro-pe finds Eng- land, France, and. R.ussia taking a firm stand against Hitler's latest move for leasing the Polish and Hunp;adan minoTities in Czecho- slovakia to their parent eountl'ies. Troops are being mobilize-d, war tin::~e propaganda issued, munition works sp~eding up their output and foeeign citizens scul\l'ying out of the prospective war zones. Eu1·o:pe is rap- idly taking on the appearat1ce of an a!'lned camp. Yet, there are certain alliances taking fol'm and economic factors b-ecoming strik- ingly evident that point to the fact that war might not be as pr-ofitable to Hen· Hitler as it would have bee11 a few months ago, when he made his sensational coup d'.f't.at of Aus- tria.

Russia and the other members of the Little Entente, Yugoslavia and Rou- mania, have also pledged their aid to the Czechs, if they are attacked.

Our most important reason for liking the new constitution is that we believe, at least we hope, that it will foster some lively poli- tical stratagem. We believe in political deals; we believe that the experi.ence to be gained in g·etting other people to do what one wants them to do, and maldng them like it, is valuable. We look forward to a little life in the Council. We hope we are not too optimistic. A PLUG FOR THE FESTIVAL The Mohawk Drama Festival, which has completed its fourth year of successful opel'- ations on our campus, has long been a stand- ing joke to certain members of the student body, for no good reason. Whenever an in- stitution is doing a commendable job, it al- ways seems that it must weather a storm of detrimental criticism from a. few \smart alecks\ before they sudd.enly realize that perhaps they have been a wee bit assinine. When the 1\lohawk Drama Festival can draw twenty-eight thousand paid admissions to the camp.us each summer, even the doubt- ful must admit that it is certainly a great advertising medium for the college. More- over, if one would take the time to read a few of the press notices given the Festival, they would soon learn that many of the dt·ama eritics throughout the country feel that Mr. Coburn and his staff are doing commendable work in the field of dramatic presentation. One of these critics, Edward Sothern Hipp, writes a very interesting at•ticle in a Newark newspaper that we feel is worthy of reprinting here. But there's a dng's bone to pick with B. J. yet. It's not about Omar or high~blooded Scotties, Pedigreed Spaniels or ribboned setters-but a care for the underdog, the Mutt, the Mcmgrel, the Garbage-Bound. Ar.nong the whole pack of verses not a line of tribute to the critter' It's an unforgiveable !rind of dog- putting-on, an error gross enough to bark an author out of standing, or have the Canine Commoners vote to brand your line of Chows with sear let tongues.

The Colby cancellation was detri- mental to the welfare of the team since it prevented Coaches Nel- · son and Nitchman to see their team in actual competition on the home d, and the injuries sustained in the scrimmage session substituted for the game do not help matters · at all. OTHER LATE STARTERS A glance at the schedule of Union's future opponents this sea- son brings forth a ray of sunshine, because it shows that Hamilton, R. P. I., and Rochester do not open their season until Saturday; there- fore they will have had no more· competition than the Dutchmen ·by the time the dates for the respec- tive games roll ar-ound. Swarth- more College will be opening its season against Union on the 8'th of October. Mulcare's mil·fortune was a cli- max of an afternoon's ]lractice in ~~~~~~~;;;~~~~~~~~~~~;;~;;;~~~~~~~~ which Jake Amazon, captain and I quarterback of the varsity, Bob Garnett, and Adam· Ciesinski were also injured, but their injuries were Hope is being held that the col- lege physicians will :soon issue their official verdict on the injuries of Billy Thomas and Wally Baker and some indication as to when these men will be able to rejoin the team. Mulcare's fracture of the hand has been described as much more .seri- ous than Thomas' broken hand which was sustained a little more than three weeks ago . Schenectady EnCJraving Co. 147 JA.Y ST. ENGRAVERS FOR THE CONCORDIENSIS . found to be but slight after ex- amination by the doctor, Coach Nelson Nitchman yester- . day indicated that either Robert Molloy or Adam Ciesinski would replace Mulcare ln the starting line-up against the strong Trinity · College eleven Saturday in the game to be played at Ha.rtford, Conn. Nitchman also said yesterday that the practice this week would be light with only one scrim- . mage. Mulcare was to start his third i~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~j I season as· a member of the Union n College varsity this year. Last year he was a stalwart of the line as a running guard and a defensive Advance information about the Trinity College eleven shows that the Dutchmen will have their hands full when the stack up against the Blue and Gold Saturday. Nine of the eleven men expected to start for the New Englanders are letter- men from last year's varsity. J. Alexander at left end, S. Alex:ander at left guard, Carey at center, Har- ris at right guard, Dim!ing at right tackle, Kelly at right end, Lindner at right halfback, Rihl at quar- bacit and Morris, at fullback are the veterans.

FOOT .,1J.A.L\Ll]H.O In last Friday's issue of The Concordiensis a list of eight games to be played the following Saturday were given and two of Union's leading so-called journalists and three football coaches gave their prognostications as to the outcome of the tussles. The five men in question: Sports Editor Jerome H. Smith, Editor- in-Chief F-rederick W. Hequembat~rg, Freshman Coach Arthur \Ott\ Lawrence, Head Coach in Varsity Football Nelson W. Nitchman, and Varo>ity Football Line Coach VI/alter J. \Duke\ Nelson, received a \break\ when the Hobart-Amherst and Vermont-Trinity games were cancelled. \Nitch\ and \Ott\ picked five out of six of the eventual winners. while Smith and \Duke\ are in second place With a batting average of .667. '\Hequ\ finished a. poor third with three up and three down for a .500 score. This may prove that those who make sports their business are more capable of predicting results, but then Fred will have a chance to catch up with the leaders when eight more games are chosen next week. All of the contestants agreed that Williams would defeat Middle• bury, and that's just what happened by the score of 13-0. Hequem- bourg wanted to be different so he picked Centenary over Texas Christian, and this is where he fell behind the rest of the field be- cause the Christians won, :13-0. The football mentors coincided in their choice of CalifC>rnia over St. Mary's so Smith and Hequembourg lost along with the Gaels. The score of 12-7. Nitchman sided with the Concordy men in picking Alabam' over Southern California, while his colleagues up at the gym made the sad mistake of thinking California would be the vistory, while the Monday morning quarterbacks find that the Southerners won easily, 19-7. \ 'Ott\ has the ner·ve to pick Oregon,\ we quote from Friday's Concordy and his nerve got him somewhere, because the Oregonians defeated Washington State, 10-2. Congratluations, \Ott.\ The final game on the dope sheet for last Saturday was the Holy Cross-Provi- dence fr-ay in which the former triumphed, 28-0. All five contestants agreed that the Indians would win. Interested in Schmectady Interested in UNION MAURICE B.

Along with these blanks wer•e Bheets con- taining advice concerning tl.e qual- ities to which the entering class should hold in order to stand a good chance for p!a.cement at the end of their four years. The blanks are to be filled in thoughtfully and these will mark the beginnings of \job- consciousness'', which will remain more or Jess apparent to the class during their college car·eer. Yunich Spea.lt:S Yunich spoke to the fl:eshmen o.n the importance of wise and discrim- inating nomination and election of class officers. Stress was laid .on the necessity of avoiding the com- mon tendency among freshman groups to. nominate a large number of candidates. in which. case a com- paratively small amount of votes is bUfficient to elect a man to office, One of the best ways to combat the ever-present political management of class elections is for the individ- ua;l members to become mutually acquainted. Freshman camp and Freslunan Record make this easier to some extent. It was pointed out that the student ·body is trying to avoid a Council of lette1men, and chat an intelligent election of offi· cers· in the freshman year would be a good .start to make the class amount to something in the future. Attendance Compulsory F1 e.shmen were instructed that their attendance at student body meetings was compulsory. Accord- ing to the Constitution, the fresh- men may discuss business at these meetings, but they have no vote in the transactions !Lntil after the first semester. An innovation o.f this year is that the freshmen, and other cla.ssrnen, are encouraged to attend the meetings of the Student Council. The large attendance and interest that was shown wm undoubtedly make for a very interesting contest in the coming elections, which will be held late in October, Wyatt an- nounced. ---a•--- Optional Classes In Public Speaking Professor Kellogg's optional class in public speaking met in the Old Cha·pel last Monday from 4:30 to 6:00 P. M. About 3() students at· tended and it is expected that other students will join, at least for the opening lectures and choral prac- tice. 'The class will meet next Mon- day and succeeding Mondays, when short, individual ex tempore speeches will be encour1lged. Addi- tional sessions .may be· offered so as to accommodate those who are in- terested and who may not have an opportunity to meet or speak on Monday. Dr. Dixon Ryan Fox has ex- pressed his willingness to address the class at some time in the near future and to give some of his ex- periences as to the value of acquir- ing both technique and practice in the art oif ex tempore platform ~>peaking·. Last year, about 60 students at- tended lectures and about 35 tried ex tempore speaking. Students who will be or ha.Ve been asked to ad- dress college <assembly on Wednes- days would do well to .take. advan- tage of the exposition of principles and the chance for practice speak- ing afforded by these optional classes. li ·-··u 'L L I_ n. ~\'.· \!I,\') i'l - V t <_) ~ I I ' ~ I I • • Cosmopolitan Ch.tb Pl.cms Announced UNION COLLEGE, SCHENECTADY, N.

A repre.sen ta tive of the Society was chosen to meet the vis- iting Colgate .cross-country team and act as guide about the college grounds during their visit.

Yumch '39. It is the purpose of the three men concerned in this project, Yunich, Frederick Wyatt, and Mil- t.on M. E:nzer, to institute a re- · viva! of the old Cosmopolitan Club which existed in 192~ and 1930, when Unio.n customarily drew stu- dents from a variety of nations all over the world. The increase dur~ ing the past few years of t~e num- ber of foreign students reg1stering at Union js an encouraging aspect in the distribution of Union enter- ing classes. . . Female Musicans, Wily Politicans .A.dd Color to Republican Convention In this same connectiOn, Yunrch remarked, during the interview, \I feel that the time is ripe now with the influex .of foreign men here for the founding of such a club.\ The object in organizing the group is chiefly for discussion pur- poses, but a further program of varied interests is planned fot the future, after the club has become better integrated. The prospective members are to be: Jose Friere, of Cuba; John Palm, of the Canal Zone, Panar;na; Feliciano Gonzalez, of Porto R1co; Sol Penner, Hans Munzer, and Hans Boll, all from Germany; Shiu Kong Yuen, of China; and Edward Jackman, the new exchange stu- dent from Scotland, who has not yet arrived. ----·0--- Sunday Organ Recital A ,program of varied music wi.ll be offered by Dr. Tidmarsh at hrs Sunday organ recital.

Sellon, visiting lecturer, in Hale House last night had de- tained him in discussion an hour and a quartet· overtime, the ·traveling Englishman was entertained in their social rooms by the ten residents of the top fioors of north section, North College. This is one of the first instance,; of a campus visitor being entertained by a dormitory group in their living quarters. The North North men, (sev- eral of whom were in the din- ner-discussion group), were hit spontaneously by the idea of giving Mr. Sellon a. glimpse of typical American dorm life. Conversation, which earlier in the evening had covered fairly thoroughly the international situation, tUI•ned to subjects ranging from the Anglo-Ameri- can cultural and racial ties, to English university life. Mr. Sel- lon's stories of inconveniences at Ox:fprd amused his hosts- particularly that of the prin- cipal of one of the colleges, who fifteen years ago, was aghast at the suggestion of ''batllrooms\ for his students, \After all,\ he said, \the boys are only up for eight weeks.\ Interfraternity Council Plans Bridge T ournamen·r Hope to Better Social Life Between Houses At a meeting of the Interfrater- nity Council Tuesday evening at the Delta Upsilon House, plans were discussed for a possibl'3. tour- nament this fall in contract bridge. The inclusion uf dormitories and faculty representatives was considered. At present, however, these plans are merely tentative and the activity chairmen from the various fraternity houses have to await developments in theh· respec- tive chapters according to the en- thusiasm for the proposition shown ·before a definite decision can be reached at the meeting to be held Monday night, Oct. 3. At that ttme, plans will be drawn up as to how the tourna- ment i13 to be conducted. The purpose of the tournament is to create better interfraternity social life. If this proposed tour- nament is successful, later in the year tournaments in both ping- pong and pool will be started. The nominal entrance fees· of the play- ers in the toumey will go toward purchasing cups or other suitable awards. ----o--- Freshmen Exchange Dance Series Begins Saturday This ywr's Skidmore-Union Fr·eshman parties will get un- der way when 75 membeTs of the class of 1942 journey to Sara- toga tomorrow afternoon al 3 p. m. as guests of 75 Skidmore freshmen.

THURSDAY, Sept. 29. -\The English people are absolutely united behind Prime Minister Ne- ville Chamberlain,\ declared Hugh Gilbert Sellon, well-knowli. author- ity on modern European and Brit- ish history, in a discussion with a round-table conference yesterday afternoon. Introduced by William C. Rob- bins, '39, President of the Interna- tional Relations Club. Mr Sellon di- r-ected his remarks chiefly toward the .foreign policy of Great Bntam as concerns the present Czechoslo- vakian crisis. Mr. Sellon first outlined the atti- tude o·f the opponents oi Chamber- lain's policy. \The opponEnts, led by Anthony Eden, say that it is im- possible to comp1 omise with the dic- tators ... they will ask for more and more. If they don•t get what they want, they will throvv off the mask they wear and, with their newly-acquired power, attaclt the British Empire. If Ge1ma ny is al- lowed to annex Sudeten!and, she will gain three and a half millions of people, besides a great amount of natural resources and therefore will he in a position actively to threaten Great iBr•itain.\ Chamberlain's Polley \Chamberlain's policy, on the other hand. is as follows: We do not agree with Eden that it is im- possible to come to a compromise with the totalitarian states because the ·balance of power between dem- ccracy and the dictatorships is so evenly distributed. The last chance for a showdown was in the spring of 1936, when the Germans went into the Rhineland. On~e England allowed Hitler to fortify tlu Rhine- . land, Germany became so .strong that the only way out is compromise or world war.\ \The British Empire lost a mil- lion men in the World War_ If those million were to march f(lur abreast past a stand, the time bet-ween the appearance of the first man and the disappearance of the last would be four hours short of five days, ancl nights. This 'procession of the dead' represents the great loss and the tragedy that befell England in the Great War. England is not the great nation she might have been, tecause the flower of her youth were killed ... the lead!'rs that might have led England to great heights wPre slaughtered. England knows this, and there is only one choice when it comes to compr<Jmise or complete destruction.\ Univei·sal Era of Cha!lge \Europe and the world are pass. ing through social, economic and political change. The world cannot stand stilL England insists that the chang€ which is bound to come about shall come peacefully and no.t by bloodshed and revolution. If wat comes, the heritage and culture of centuries will be swept a-vray . . . there will be little, if any-, civiliza- tion left on the face of the earth.\ \If worse comes to wilrst, Eng- land can defeat Germany because the economic resources of En,gland, France and Russia are fa:.r greater than those of Germany and Italy. The war·, if it comes, will lle a very long one. The power of 1iefensive weapons, and especially the rna- rhine gun. has increased tremend- ou.~ly. T'he war will be setiled by economic sanction and the power of !'he Engli•h fleet to blocltade.\ '\When Czechoslovakia was set up in 1919, she was based on the de- militatization of the Rhineland.

Created by Parker to guard pens fre>m pen-clogging inks ••• Ends 69% of the fountain pen troubles There is not-and never has been-any other pen designed to handle all kinds of inks-good and bad -as well as the revolutionary Parker Vacumatic. One reason is that this modern invention has no :rubber ink sac, no lever filler, no piston pump, It is filled .bY a simple diaphragm, sealed in the top, where mk can never touch or decompose its working parts. And its patented Television barrel lets you SEE the level of ink at all times-see when to refill. · This pedigreed Beauty of laminated Pearl and Jet Is everywhere acknowledged to be the grandest pen ever created. Yet even this Guaranteed Mechanically Perfect pen can be plugged up by the grit and gum in ordinary writing inks, Hence to guard the·celebrated Parker Pens from pen-clogging inks, Parker experts developed this utterly new kind of writing ink-called Quinlc~ an ink that actually cleanses any pen as it writes, This is done by a secret ingredient, wholly harmless. It dissolves the gum and other trouble· some particles left in your pen by ordinary inks. It makes your pen a self·cleaner-cleans as it writes. Parker Qui!'ll' is full-bodied, Iich, and brilliant, Never w:atery or g:ummy. And it dries on pAPER 31% qu~cker than average, due to stepped-up penet~atlon, Yet QuinT< costs no more than ordi- nary mks-small bottles, 15c and 2 Sc.
