Reviewer Praises, Also Censures New Idol llS in Chemisb:y Raymo:md W. Barclay, REJonato C. ,_=>omatti, 'iioward E. Sheffer, Louis vV. Thompson, Jr. By ROBERT SAAF lf you call Schenectady, 6-7163, folks, you will get the residence of Erwin A. Heck, 3 Millington Rd., who has no daughter named Ellen. Mrs. Heck has a daughter, very wi!lsome, but she bears no resem- blance to the Ellen of the Idol cover; furthermore she is not yet housebroken and at 8 montbs is not quite read;y to date a Union man. So don't waste your nickel; the editors are pulling a fast one. A.side from their front page de- ception, the Idol editors have done well by t11eir readers. The current issue contains an adequate criticism of Thomas Wolfe by the precocious John Lewis, '41; \Seen in a German Town\ by Thomas Ralston, '40, Ex- change student in Scotland who vividly describes a day spent in a German town at the time of the x.e- cent European crisis; some highly commendable poetry by Leslie Pa!f- rath '39; and a good•enough short sto·ry witil a \kick\ ending by Albert Mould'40. \Beelzebub\ continues his some- what intolerant \Balance Sheet\ series which makes vel'Y entertain- ing lig)lt reading. And the Idol fol- lows the Ladies Horne Jour:nat tra~ dition in fabricating an article on what Union men think about several alleged social problems. The tabu- lations at·e not particularly intexest- ing but some of the remarks of the students are very pithy if you will take the trouble to read them carefully. One \Pro\ lad, in com- menting upon Prostitution, says he \believes it shoLild be lega.lized to halt the spread of disease b;r gov- ernment inspection\. Aside flam a few bright spots like this. the com- ment is pedestrian. The caption on Female Anonym- ous' \They .Also Ran\ indicates rather accurately that it is a \view from the other end of the telescope.\ It's all very dull and sophomoric, I don't see that the good wome;n has said anything at all. Jabie's article in the same vein, written for the last June's issue of the Idol, at least had the virtue o·f being faLr!y fact- ual. The editors ()f the Idol should have learned a .few tricks· from Life in attempting a pictOl'ial account of a freshman party. \Idol Goes to a Party\ should have been much better. Bernal d Krause '39 presents the best .of tl~e three boo:k reviews which include th~ efforts of Editor Barrin- ger and Robert Simmons '39. All are w·eii written if uninspired; Bar· ringer's last senten.ce seems silly, and I d.on't think much of Sim· mons· views on Steinbeck, but that's neither here or there.

Wade And Hequembourg Concordiensis Editor, Columnist and Professor Chosen for Membership Thursday, Dec. 1-Fredel'ick W. Hequembourg, '39, James C. Wade, 39, and Dr. Harold Blodgett, mem- ber of the English staff, were elect- ed to Hale Club recently, Dr. 13ertrand M. Wainger, secretary of the campus literary honorary wcie:y announced :oday. The Hale Club, which is com· pu;;ed of both students and fac- ulty members, had. its origin in the English Club which was found- ed by Dr. Edward Everett Hale, Jr., in 1910. Dr. Hale sought to b;·ing together a group of people .nterested in creative literary ef- iorts; the members of the club met and discus.;:ed papers written by ;cnow members. Reorganized by Waldron In 1932, after the death of Dr. Hale, the club was reorganized ~nder the sponsorship of Dr. Wal- ..:r on, and the name was changed to Hale Club. The club meets once 1 month at the homes of its mem· bers or in fraternity houses. Elec- tion 'o Hale Club is based upon the promise the candidate shows of becoming an \interesting member.\ Hequembourg is Editor-in-Chief of The Concordiensis and is a member of both the Terrace Coun- cil and the Student Council. He is also secretary of the Publications Board. Wade Is Colunm.ist The clru;sroo·ms of Professors Cof- fin, Kellogg, and Match were severe- ly da.ma.ged by the fire, and the Mountebanks' worltroom, as well as the tool::; and other materials con- tained there was ruined. The oait paneling in the Mounte· banks Theatre was only siightly damaged by water, but tbe portion over the ent1·ance door to the work- ~hop was .completely charred. Hoadley Saves Books The quick action of Anthony Hoadley, comptroller, in opening the office of Professor Coffin, saved the large private library there from se· vere damage l:Jy water and smoke. With the aid of Milton Enzer, '29, and fitemen, the books, including many \irreplaceable\ volumes, which w<.re not in book cases were placed in cupboards and out of reach of the water. Awakened by the fire apparatus, President and Mrs. Fox, Dean Garis, Dr. Ellers, and Professors Bronner, Johnson and Kell()gg came to the scene of the fire. Before Professor Johnson arrived E!t his office in the south wing of the building, President Fox and Professor Bronner carried out his desk and c:.ther items of value in th6 office. StudeniE, including William Robbins, '39, and Joseph D. Schat· tan, '41, assisted in removing valu- ables fro:n other parts of the build- ing. Hydrants Frozen Firemen had difficulty in getting water with which to fight the fir6 because ih.e mains nearest to Wash- burn Hall had fro2en.

A square foot of glass was showered about .the ro0m, and only sweetest fortune saved sev€ral hun- gry students, luckily standing nen·the walls, from serious mutilation. It happened near· Saratoga. One Saturday night two of the lads, a junior and a freshman, were \nal>bed\ by a minion of the law wh:te passing a signal light which happened to be red. Hailed befo1·e the judge, they were fined five dollars or five days. Being .broke, they asked if they could spend one night in jail and .pay four dol- lars on the fine. The Judge didn't w·an t to let them do that so they 1sked if they could go home and come back during the Thanksgiv- ing recess to spend the five days. When they were not allowed to do thi8 they asked to see the beds in the \bastille.\ Finally the judge le them go after they promised to mail the \fin.\ Now they find he bas a lovely daughter. So they -are ;ro!ng to take the five bucks back in pe1son. We were one of the earliest disbelievers in the feasibility of allowing the lnterh·aternity Council to run the November all-college dance; mainly, because we felt that it was too lo()sely knit an organization to contract a satisfactory band in the short time it had at its disposal, and especially so when we re- called that last year's supposedly well-organ- ized Junior Prom Committee could not bal- ance its budget. Today afte1· the Council published its com- plete budget showing that it had amassed a profit of $194.70, we are happy to admit that we were wrong in our em·!iel' belief. The selection of l\Ial Hallett's swingsters as the Gridiron Dance Band was a wise one and the decorations, although not especially stup.end- ous, were sufficient to give the gymnasium a congenial atmosphere. ln the final analysi~ it is thus apparent that, if nothing· else, the lnterfratemity Council has proved itself to be capable of running a successful dance from both a social and financial point of view. The Hale House incident is me:t·ely one of the several score near-catastr()phes that have been occuring everywhere on. ·eampus all week long. Each winter thaw endangers every student, faculty member, and towns- person who has cause to walk near the eves of the college buildings. Very probal>ly it is but a matter of weeks until the administra- tion has a liability suit on its hands-unless it takes some drastic steps to <!(}T!'ect the situation. What those steps may h-€, we are not certain, but we advise them at all costs. • • • Hamilton picked, on its All-Op- ~onents football team, three Union men.

There W·el·e sp01·adic outl>reak~ in large industrial centers but the m()bile guards, the gendarmes as well as detach- ments of the regular army had the situati()n well in hand. The unions called the strike as a gigantic protest against the abrogation of sections of the social program which in- cluded the forty hour-five day week enacted under the Peoples' Front government under Leon Blum. Out of the sheer logic of the situation without trying to pass judgment it was ap- parent that if the labor unions won out the government would have abdicated in prin- ciple. A general strike paralyzes civil govern- ment and in effect creates a state of civil war between the secretary generals of the unions and army officers as directed by the executive branch of the government. The question ultimately must be asked to whom do the laborers owe allegiance. If the prin- ciple is decided and it is to the unioa we have syndicalism and a negation of civil govern- ment.

T~~~a;;o~!ght in a tourist Consequently the Philomathean Sjdety met Tuesday evening· to consider mea11s of stim- ulating interest in debating at Union College. College debating today faces difficult com petition on th.e campus. Where once it ex- perienced a glm·ious past .and \Vas the sole extracurricular activity of the college, it must now vie with over a dozen aetivities, many of which have a great deal more pop-, ular attraction and bring theil' partici:pants much more into the public eye. The Philomathean, which antedates even the college itself since it goes back to the old Schenectady Academy for Its origin, can offel' a training and an experience which is extremely limited at Union Colleg€. Only voluntary classes in :public .speakillg are held here. Debating is a valuable supplement to these classes and develops an_ inteJl,ectual alertness and critical faculty wllich are fundamental in any attempt to evaluate or determine current political and social prob- lems. J.\lany suggestions have been made. The old cat and dog fight, decision debates have already been ~bandoned in Union's intercol- legiate schedule and have been replaced by general discussion and questioning following the formal arguments. Other colleges of our size have effected some increase in student interest by h(}lding debates in fr-aternity houses and crea.ting the general atmosphere of the informal discussion gro-up. And an attempt has been made to replace standard- ized debating s·ubjects such as capital pUn· ishment with current topics of a more stimu- lative and controversial nature. * * * We had a fi1e here last Sunday. rhe origin has not yet been de- termined.

For !.\lr. Paffrath's enlightenment, how- ever, we mi.~rht say that when the idea of founding a Capitol District Protest Move- ment against the persecution of Catholic and Jewish minorities in Germany was formu- lated by The Concordiensis, it was hoped that the ensuing program would be anti-Nazi in essence. As far as we can ascertain the \:Manifesto\ as accepted is just that. It as- sumes that we must give succor to the perse~ cuted minorities in Germany, and to give assistance to them in any form, whether it be moral, financial, or forceful, we show ourselves to be in disagreement with that m As this issue of The Concordien- not been able to bring their charges to a sis goes to press, Mr. Paffrath has pitch necessary to win the important games, ll-============::;!1 not as yet answered the charges · b f We hesitate to say that Gary pressed upon him. by The Inside1· are annually thrown out of JObs ecause o in a column in last Friday's paper.

That puts charges as justifiable and without combination each year. It is not our desire to a mask of ambiguity on the state- r.eproach. However, still in an ac- t . th f . f th' t' b t ment and saves us a tarring and quiescent frame of mind The In- ques 1011 e a1rness o · IS ac Ion, U we sider desires to give Mr. Pafft·ath do wonder about the wiseness of the empha- feathering at the hands of the every benefit of doubt which might d h .

Fortunately, there are only a few co1leges that might have to worry about facing similar pi•oblems in the future. But the above case serves as an tion to his report of last week. aspect of the Nazi program. It should not be necessa1·y to remind our excell.ent example of how far we have gone critic that the persecution of German minor- in the last decade in over-emphasizing a.th- ities has the full approval-in fact is inspired letics. Mr. ·Cooper cannot read lines prop- erly and ·is successful only because he can project his own awkward personality into a ftlm which will be seen by millions of sympathetic '!,wkwat·d personalities. He did just that to .perfection in Mr. Deeds Goes To Town. He does just that to perf eel ion in The Cowboy and the Lady. He will do just that to perfecti<>n in Mr. Heeds Goes to WashiligtDn, or whatever his next ftlm rna.y be. And doing \just that,\ we ·submit, is not acting. So what does it prove? Simply that Gary Cooper is a movie per- sonalit)\ and not a movie actor. Does Mr. Paffrath wish to deny publicly the faat that before a highly intellectual and cultured body of Union men and members of their faculty he presented a paper which dealt solely with a defense of Fasci<~m in Europe? If this is true, The Insider then questions the advisability of having a presi- dent of the Union College Christian Association who is undeniably pro· Fascist or pro- Nazi. For no one can deny that our Christian Asso- ciation, although it has made very few active moves since Paffratb had been president, is still hardly a persecutor of Catholic and Jew- ish movements whether they be in Europe or not. by the Nazi government. So when the Inter- collegiate Committee for Relief of German i\linorities seeks to alleviate the d-rastic per- secutions, it is therefore opposed to the main part of the Nazi program, and thus anti- Nazi. We feel that it is being picayune to argue over what a worthwhile Committee should be called; but as l\Ir. Paffrath scored us for supposedly mis-stating the facts, we felt that it was our duty to state the facts as we saw them. We hope that in the future we will be able to find more worthwhile points over which to argue.

ThP Insider still asks that Mr. Paffrath defend himself for he feels that no one who has been presented with such charges, ob· vious as they nay be, should sit back and take them without a word of protest. The Insider, then, in anticipa.'ion of any move Mr. Paffrath may tnake, accepts any challenge of dispute, be it debate, open correspondence, or other means of verbal communication, that the truth and justice of suuh exposures that either The Insider or pro-Nazi Paffrath make may be decided openly and above-boa~d. ---- ·-0 ------ IN THE MAIL ERR-ATUM To The Editor: May I briefly call to your atten- tion an error in the heading of the article relating to the selection of the cast of the Mountebanks' next production, Rosmersholm 7 The leading part is that of Ros- . mer, I aken by Andrew Speziali, '42.

G. Clau&Sen Speaks On Sociological Aspect Of Environment \There are sociological t'anks in the plant animal community,\ said Dr. Ralph G. Claussen, former bi- ology instructor at Union, speaking at the first of a ser·ies of experi- mental biology colloq_ uia in the Bi- ology Laboratory last night. Dr. Claussen, who is now a professor at th eNew York State Callege for Teachel's Is a.n .authority in ecology. Dr. Claussen pointed out how plants and animals must withstand dominant characteristics of thei-r environment. He presented the ex- ample of a heavy wooded, high for- est where greens could not grow bc·cause of the la~k of sunlight. Two main factors present the most important aspects of environment, Dr. Claus:sen added. 'They are phys- ical factm·s and biological control. Weather falls into the classifica- tion of physical factors. Biological control is expressed as rhythm. Dr. Claussen descdbed his obser- vation of the bimlex wasp, of which he has made a detailed study. He outlined Clement's theory of change in plant-animal ·community accord- ing to change in envil·onment, go- ing, in his description, from the desert stage to the cli-max, where a community will theoretically exist forever. Speaking generally, Dr. Claussen impressed upun his audience that animals and plants respond to the environment as a whole while the ecologist completely disects it. As far as ecology itself is concerned, it is a Oltudy of the relationship be- tween plant and animal life to the en vii onment. When approached, one biology professor remarlted that it is \the psychology of bi- ology.\ The ecologist takes morpho- logical and physiological facts al- ready known and tries to correlate hem with environment. --·0· Civil Engineers ·Make Annual Tour to New York Group Inspects World's Fair Construction And New Subway Tunnel 1 uns un old adage and the cover Dr. Philip Stanley, who teaches ul Ute Juul p1 u1·e~ that a: good per- course.s in philosophy and in eco- t:entage ol them come tu Umon. nom-ics in the Division of Social As rPpurted tn .the Concordle'nsls, s·tudies says that \The soC'ial sci- tlle numbc! ti-7lb3 belongs to a e:nces can aspire to the adjective .:O.Jr. Heck, but scientific when and only when they l\lr.

All of these projects are practical applications of the work which the students have been s'udying in their courses in Water Supplies, Building Construction, Surveying, and others. One of the highlights of the trip was the descent into the subway tunnel. Here the boys were forced to don metal helmets in order to observe the actual scene of drill- ;ng. The fair grounds were also of great interest, most of its being centeted in the six hundred foot high Trylon, and in the spherical Perisphere.

UCCA Uses Funds In Nine Ways Report of Last Year's Activities Indicates Diversified Program That the Union College Christian Association engaged· in nine dis- tinct major activities during the year 1937-38 with a student tax al- lotment of $30.00 is indicated by a report which the organization bas released t() the Concordien.sis. The itemized summary of the associa- tion's prog-ram last year follows: 1. Under the auspices of the Chrietian Association, student vol- unteers worked with the Schenec- tady Boys Club. 2. Conducted the annual Freshman Camp session at United State Commissioner of Edu- caJtion. One of Yunich's more difficult tasks a.s an officer of the gathering will be attempting to \sell'' the idea of Union-sponsored Intercollegiate Committee for the R-elief of Ger- man Minorities to the national fed- eration. Tbe committee, which is at present restricted to this area, feels that if it can enlarge itself to na- tion-wide propor·tions, it may have serious effecf on the national ad- ministration. Among the many noted educat<>r.s who will assist at the conference are President Henry Nobel MacCracken of Vassar College and Professor Charles A. Beard of Columbia. There are also many other orig- inal exhibits on display. Dr. E. B. Mains of the University of Michi- gan has depicted the growth and reproduction of the Delphinium in a beautiful set of six photographs. Dr. Harold E. Edgerton of M.I.T. has contributed a collection of pic- tures of flying birds. The most. in- teresting of these is. a series of seven photos showing humming birds in flight. This exhibit has been arranged by Dr. Ernest E. Dale, professor of biology. The public is welcome, and no admission will be charged.

Dr. Gazeley gave his talk in two parts. He tallted first about the aspects <>f social conditions in Eng- land and gave over the second part of his talk to England's in- ternational ,policy. In speaking about the English people as a whole, Dr. Gazeley sta!,ed that their cordiality, for- mality, self - discipline, and all around good behavior were out- standing. He emphasized their for- mality in that it is impossible for one person to speak or write to another, using their given names, without a formal introducUon by a third p.:art:y.

In deciding to work out at Piinceton, the players were forced to turn down the invitation of the Lake Placid Club authorities to participate in the annual intercol- legiate hockey round-robin at the northern New Yorlc State sports center f1·om December 26 to 28, as Union did last winter. Both students and Coach \Duke\ Nelson expressed the opinion that, since the team has not had suffi- cient practice on ice to date and was not likely to have many drills by vacation time in view of the present weather conditions, the hockey group as a whole would benefit far greater from the Prince- on trip. Furthermore, all players able and wHiing to work out in New Jersey will be welcome, as compared to a 12-man team limit were Union to be represented at Lake Placid. Coach Nelson will have the opportunity to size up his freshman hopefuls who also will be able to engage in several con- tact s-crimmages with the regulars.

There are very few homes in England that have central heating systems. Each house is supplied with electricity, gas or coal heaters.

The note which was signed by \The In· sider\ wa.s followed by another of the same accusing nature and furthermore issued a challenge to Paffrath.

Although his charges have been hard at work for several weeks now, Coach Nelson Nitchman will not make known until game time what Union's starting combination will be for the Larry encounter. However, he has indicated that four veteran members of last year's team are almost sure to be repre- senting the Dutchman cause at the opening whistle. Regardless, a sophomore newcomer to the cui'- rent outfit is certain to be the fifth starter, since three ex-freshman stars are staging a close fight for the remaining berth. Lineup Indefinite During Union's .pre-season prac- tice sessions several of the candi- dates showed excellent potential- ities, only to fall down miserably under pres s u r e < in the inform.al co n t a c t scrim- mages with out- side teams. As a result, Coach Nitchman has been reluctant to give out any pos- sible I in e u p, rather desirous to w a i t u n t i I after Monday's a n d Tuesday's workouts. As the situa- tion now looks, Captain John Schultz, L a r u e Buchanan, Herb Coadt N itelunmt Watson and George Miller seem most likely to start. Schultz is the only senior on the squad, the other three hav- ing performed with last season's varsity cagers. For the fifth post, Coach Nitchman probably will choose from Bill Ford, Alex Tur- chick, and Arn Rathlev, all three sophomo·res. The positio11 of .play for each man depends on Union's style of defense tomorrow,. with a combination of both types the like- ly order. Tanner Is 0. K. For a while there was doubt as to whether Hudson Tanner, 811,.- other letterman, wo·uld be able to play tomorrow due to physical dis- ability.

These intt·oductory speeches werE' followed by informal questioning and answering by the contestants.

TIDMARSH Wi,ttner Announces New Arrangement In Ticket Plan Fraternities Permitted To Obtain Tickets In Group Under Plan As a result of a conference with David Yunich, chairman of the Student Council, and Frederick Hequembourg, editor of The Con- cordiensis, Professor Wittner has announced that fraternity groups may obtain tickets for the basket- ball game with Clarkson Saturday night by sending one man to the gym at 7 p. m. to procure tickets for the group. This plan will be tried for the next two home games and if sue· cessful, will he continued. Because of the many complaints about having to wait for tickets at the St. Lawrence game and groups not being able to sit too ge:her, Yunich and Hequembourg went to Professor Wittner to see if a change could be made. Witt- ner declared that the large num- ber of reserved, tickets not called for last year had prompted tlie system used Wednesday evening. during the four years following their graduation. The Council feels hat this will do much to bridge the natu1·al gap which comes when the seniors go into the world and are absorbed with the problems of earning their living. The alumni believe that hearing regularly from the college through the pages of the Monthly will do much to maintain their old interest in Union, and by so doing strengthen the alumni body,\ De. Waldron, Secretary of the Graduate Council and Editor of the Alumni 1\lonthly said in commenting upon the re- sults of the poll. Senior Class ·Eligible Under tne new plan ·which will go into effect nex. yesr, undergrad- uates will pay one dollar per year for four years and upon gradua- tion w i 11 r e c e i v e t h e Alumni Monthly for four· years. The pres- ent senior class, however, Yunich said, will have the pl'ivilege of the new rates and upon paying their subscriptions at the Graduate Coun- cil office r·eceive the benefit of the dollar-a-year-rate for· a miximum of four year·~ subscription. Yunich wilT meet with Dr. Wal- dron some time before the next Student Council meeting to iron out the details of the plan which must receivE. the official sanction of the Student Council before it can go into effect. --0---- AIInut Outlines Plans For 1939 Garnet The students who will speak are Edward Jackman of England, Feli- ciano Gonzales of Puerto Rico, John Palm of the Panama Canal .Zone, Shiu Kong Yuen of China, Hans Munzer. Sol Penner and Hansjoerg Boll of Germany, and August Kluge of the Philippine Is- lands. Each wiH speak a few moments, commenting on the Christmas carol singing, the col- lege itself, and will deliver a pe.r- sonal message to his family and .a Christmas greeting to his friends. A description of the carol singing and of the songs themselves will be translated from the English into Spanish and Portugese. The Cosmopolitan Club was or- ga,nized in October by David L. Yunich, president of the Student Council. During the regular meet- ings, John Palm '39, was elected president of the organization, which has been dormant since 1929. ---·o--- Brand Discusses Hockey In Chapel Address \The weather man has always played the most important part in determining the fortunes of hockey at Union,\ said John Brand, '39, capUlin of the Hocl,ey team, speak- ing in Chapel yesterday.

Of course, it is useless to deny .that the FestivaJ has faults. I have myself bleld fot·th loudly and long, in the :;::~resence of rnern.bers of your ·own board, on some of them.

From a vantage point inside the organi- zation during- its first three years, and a perspective out here for the past two, I sincerely believe that it is functi~ning even more en- couragingly than could be ex- pected.

The second step is writing the statement <not over 50 words) of why you liked such and such a pic tur·e best. After that all you need is an envelope and a stamp and a lot of patience. The ~ponsors will probably take mos·t of 1939 to select the win- ners, thereby insuring themselves against having to run another con- test before 1940. Fr·anltly, now, we expect to find the grand prize winner right here on the campus. As a result of cer- tain quasi-secret investigations re- cently made, we are prepared to wager that the lucky party will be one of the following: Stanley Luke, Dr. Kellogg, \Zip\ Lindeberg, Leo Kupeclti, Alexander Arony, Joseph Rotundo, Armand Feigenbaum, F. Lidell Bronner or Rudy Paffrath. These men all have keen minds and it's' a toss-up amongst them. We wish them all the luck in the world, and would like to put a lien on the prize money for a five dol- lar touch. D, F.

Gentlemen: A simple solution to the whole Paffrath..:Henyan wrangle would be to toss tne whole idea into the wastebasket. The superficial altru- ism of the \Committee for the Re- lief of Gel'rnan Minorities\ has been scraped away to reveal something rather' ug:Iy. Mr. Hequemboul'g, \Father of Anti-Nazi Plan,\ tipped his mitt when, in reference to Ml'. Yunich's proposed N. S. F. A. visit, he wrote: \ ... we are not inter- ested in what they decide, but in what the conference can do to put us before the public. The colleg-e spends a great deal of money yearly to build up our prestige, so it seems !bat we should feel it out duty to lend a helping hand when the opportunity al'ises.\ Since the editorial is unsigned, one can only conclude that it represents the opinion of the editor: Hequem- borug can•t back out. He has laid bare the motive for his relief or- ganization. which Yunich will rep- resent at the forthcoming confer- ence. All in all, it seems a cheap trick to take ad:vantage of some- one's misfortune in order to get publicity.
