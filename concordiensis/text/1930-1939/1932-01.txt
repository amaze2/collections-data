A. Richmond, ically all of the important churches Professor E. M. Ligon, professor of Psychology, has written an ar- ticle entitled, \A Genetic Study of Color Naming and Word Reading\ in the January issue of \The A:m- erican Journal of Psychology\. \The observations obtained for this study,\ writes Dt. Ligon, \w.ere taken from an .experiment in the public schools of New London, Con- necticut. The experimenters were students of psychology in Connec- ticut College. 'There were· two tests; Namely,. the Woodworth- Wells color naming test, alid a w-ord reading test which consisted of a typewritten sheet containing ()fie hu.ndred w0rds, the names of the colors on the color naming test.\ The students used from the first to the sixth grade constituted the .entire student body 0f one public school, thus including the different grades of intelligence, and an ap- proximately equal number of boys and girls. The seventh, eighth, and ;ninth grades were in different schools. Results Interesting It is interesting to note the re- sults obtained. The Woodworth- Wells color and word reading test was given to 638 students ranging from the first to the ninth grades in school and from six to eighteen years of age. The results in brief were. as follows: 1. There was a progressive im- provement in the pc;Jrtormance of both functions throughout the range of those tested. 2. The differences between the two functions remained remark- ably constant throughout the ninth grades. Color naming was consist- ently poorer than the word reading. Only 17 students gave opposite re- sults. 3. Girls excelled the boys consist- ently in the color naming. No great differences were found in the word naming.

The gift fund was put into actual .operation on November 1 and each branch of the history department has been draw- ing on the fund since. The fund went into effect at a most oppor- tune time. The history depart- ment:s work was expanded at that time, and, in addition, the fund was available just when the British ex:- · change was in -our favor, pr-esent- ing the opportunity to purcha;se books in England at a substantial discount. Professor Doty expressed the gratitude of the entire history de- partment by saying, \We feel that such a gift is of the very highest value, and that the class of 1906 has made a p·ermanent contribution to the intellectual life of the col- lege.\ 'fhe fund will add between 250 to 300 volumes to the library. To show the extent of the value of the 1906 Gift fun(l, the history . department is making arrange- ments with Mr. Brewster, librarian, to .exhibit in the College Lil;Jrary, at Commencement, all the books pur- chased through the fund. The 1906 books already available for student use may be recognized by a Union boo-k plate bearing the imprint \lll06 Gift Fund,\ which· is pasted in the front of the books. ------o------- Li.fset, Crowley Debate Syracuse and Hamilton At a regular meeting of the Phil-·.

' ' · ' ' · student a great .deal of selection. Minor ·sports are included in the list and are slowly but surely com- ing to the fore. Basketball, featuring interfrater- nity combinations, early became the favorite winter sport. The tournament during the past month aroused active interest on the cam- pus and it was only after a hard fight that the Phi Delta Thheta: .ag- gregation won the 1932 c ampiOn- ship,. defeating the Neutrals 1:6 to 12. Activity oB the diamond was first seen in 1925 when the Neutrals finished with baseball boners. The clashes from 1925 to 1929 featured the use of the regulat·ion hard ball. At that time the difficulty of equip- ping the nines arose, as a number of the fraternities found the cost of outfitting a team prohibi·tive. Ac- cordingly the soft ball game '!as instituted with no loss of prestige. Baseball continues to meet the re- quirements of the s~uden·ts an?- w~ll doubtless increase 1ts popularity m the future. Competition for the Foote Cup, awarded annually to the victor in interclass boxing and wrestling, is keen. Seven meets ba ve been suc- cessfully staged and an. eighth is in the offing. For those lesser athletes, other sports are 0ffered. In the fall, · touch footb~ll and horseshoe pitch- ing have their respective days of glory. The gridiron belt was cap- tured by the Phi Delta Theta team which vanquished the Alpha Mu Sigma combination 21-15 in a muddy battle. The Alpha Phi Delta horseshoe artists turned back the Alpha Mu Sigma tossers, 21 to 18, rand 21 to 19. \Sports for All\ . New P?licy.
