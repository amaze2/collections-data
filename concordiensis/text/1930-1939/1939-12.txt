The delegate from Union College wi:l be George Miller, '40, who was elected to the post at the IntHfra- ternity Council meeting Monday night, Hayner said. The Confer- ence·~ prog1am will be broaC:cast Saturday mo1 ning between 10;00 and 10;30 a. m. over the Columbia \We have lived with Ji.berty so long that we cannot imagine a country in which it does not ex- ist,\ Lord Duff Cooper began. He went on to describe how liberty has come down to the present day from Palestine through Gree.~e anJ. Rome. To illustrate how freedom holds an empire together, he p.;int- ed out that the Roman empire last- ed over a period of time equivalent to that from 1492 to the present. Saying that the traditions of lib- erty had been preserved in France and England, the speaker added, \But liberty today in France and England is not safe.\ He continued that the Roman idea of freedom penerated to all the countries of western civilization where they made conquests. However, the tribes of Prussia and Russia never came under the influence of Roman ideas, he said. Freedom Felt In the nineteenth century, Lord Duff Cooper went on, freedom made itself felt more strongly through- out all Europe, including even the reluctant countries of Russia and Prussia. Germany itself copied e1e British Parliamentary system for a time, but could not reconcile itself to this p.an, he stated. sian. The four Union students and the three men from Vermont sat about in comfortable fashion. in an at- mosphere far unUke the formal pro- ~edure at orthodox debates, com- pletely unhampered by an audience, and utterly free to dicker and ban- ter as they pleased. The discuo-sion was kept alive without the cust0m- ary displays of individual rhetoric and was punctuated through:mt with interruptions, ·apologies, cr0ss- talk and humorous observations.

Heroes of the s1:ent films of the 18::>0-1928 e1 a were presented as the theme cf Monday night's program. Among them were Lillian Gish, Ru- dolph Valentino and Bebe Daniels. Lord Duff Cooper, praising th0 merits of freedom of press and rt- ligion, urged strongly that steps be taken to insUI e its preservation. '\I'hroughout most of Europe to- day, freedom has vanished,\ the British state s man continued. \Those who have the power to re- £tore it, denounce it.\ He describ- ed the absence of freedom of speech and press in Germany and Russia today, where formerly art a.nd lmowledge prevailed.

The theme of the conference will be \A Functional Program for Unc:!Ngraduate ·Councils,'' according to a program releafed by Dean G.

(Continued on Page 4l ---0·---- Works of Schubert, Grieg Featured by Tidmarsh Dr. Cha1les N. Waldron, Sec1·e· tary of the College, related three anecdotes in chapel ye,terday to illustrate how the ty.pical college student has changed. Dr. Waldron stressed the fact that Union stu- dents of 1801 were confined within West College, lccated jmt below the corner of Union St1 eet and Erie Boulevat d. They were forced to turn to pranks to ammme them- selves, whereas student tcoay have the freedom of the town with all its amusements he said. Liquor in the dormitories was a big problem then but the method of dealing with intoxication was much different Dr. Waldron said While today it is ignored, then the students we1 e subjected to fines and other puni:ohments. Typica 1 excuses given to the faculty were \that we dranl' ·because we had a cold\ or that the offenders needed egg-nog for their health. Seve1 a! students simply did not know how I pitchers or intoxicating beverages came into their rocms. Excuses l1ave not changed much in 140 years, Dr. Waldron o·bserved. Next on the Mountebanks pro- gram of cinema studies is \The We~tern Film,\ which will be pre- sented Monday night, December 11. Rabbi Olan spoke here in daily assembly last year in February as a member of the Interfaith Te:otm which was speaking at many col- :eges and clubs in an attempt to c!alify the di·fferences and similar· ities of the Catholic, Protestant and Jewish religion!'. At that time Rabbi ·Olan m.H!e a plea to the ·stu- dents to live up to their re!iaious convictions, no matter what those convictions are. The worlm of Franz Schubert, Edward Grieg and Pete1· Tchai- kowsky will be featured by Dr. El- mer Tidmarsh in his organ recital Sunday, December 3 at 4:00 p. m. in the Memorial Chapel. Grieg's \Peer Gynt Suite\ and Schubert's \Unfinished Symphony\ will be pre- sented as well as the works of other European composers. Dr. Tidmarsh will also play John Phil- lip Sousa's \Stars and Stripes For- ever.'' The program, which will be di- vided into four parts, is com- prised of: I Unfinished S y m p h on y- Franz Schubert II Peet· Gynt Suite - Edward Grieg Mornil'lg Ase's Death Anitra's Dance In the Hall of the Mountain King III In a Monastery Garden- Ketelby.

His second story 1 elated an inci- dent in which one student had lighted ten candles and placed them in his window in the C:ormitory. Students on the outside availed themselves of this display by toss- ing stoneo at the candles, but the window below, in the room of a Professor McCa~l. actually received the brunt of the missives, A subse- quent complaint from him and other faculty members merely en- couraged further bombardment of still more faculty windows.

Union Seniors Skidmo·re Guests Invited at Attend Concert, Dinner On Monday Evening Frederic A. Vvyatt, assistant sec- retary of the college, has an- nounced that the senior class of Union has been invited to be the guests of the senior class of Sldd- more College on the evening of Monday, December 4. The arrange- ments for the occasion were made by the senior class of Skidmore and by Mr. Wyatt, acting as Union's representative. The seniors attending will leave the campus Monday afternoon and upon their arrival in Saratoga will attend a dinner with their Skid- more dates. Following the dinner the guests will accompany their hostesses to a concert to be given in the Skidmore Chapel by Benia, a noted French opera singer'. This concert will conclude the prc.gram of the first joint Union-Skidmore senior party. Skidmore Students Obtain late leave; Faculty Houses Guests With a frosty setting for its \hop but with a warm welcome for its feminine guests, the class of '43 will revive the old custom of the Sophomore Soiree when Freddie Be!Hnger waves his baton tomorrow evening at nine sharp for the initial medley of tunes of the Sophomore Drag. Chairman Ar- mand Fiegenbaum has promised to set a high mark in decorations for future committees to outdo and says that \the only way to judge the dance is to come.\ Fiegenbaum a n n o u n c e d that Helen Pastor. a well known local singer, has been signed to appear with Freddie Bellinger and his band for this dance. She has pre- viously sung with Gene Krupa and at the Paramount Theatre in New York City. Bellinger will bring an orchestra to the bandstand which is equally proficient in rendering either swing tunes or sweet melodies. His ap- pearance at recent collegiate func- tions at Colgate, Hamilton, Syra- cuse, McGill, Buffalo and Montreal are proofs of his popularity. A graduate of Cornell, Bellinger stepped into Jack Teagarden's spot as trombonist after his graduation when Teagarden left Paul White- man to organize his own band. He left Whiteman because of poor health and is now leading his own swing organization. Forty Tall Fir Trees Ben Leland, chairman of the dec- orations committee, announced that the walls of the gym will be masked with forty tall fir trees to gain a sylvan effect. The trees will in turn be laden with icicles to turn the whole appearance into a wintry and fro~ty setting. The faculty booth w1H render the appearance of .the porch of a hunting lodge wh1le the students will rest their feet while trying to balance them- selves on logs. Mr. Wyatt stated that thus far 51 seniors have indicated their de- sire to attend the affair. Those sen- iors who have not yet registered' but who wish to attend are re- quested to see him at once. Mr. Wyatt also indicated that formal attire would be correct. All men at- tending the party will have to ar- range for private transportation as no other means will be available. Die!{ Conly who is in charge of the date bureau has revealed that Skidmore girls may obtain late leave till two o'clock and that overnight leave may be obtained if desired. Those who do take over- nights may find a place to stay at one of the faculty homes. Conly also announced· that his date bu- reau still has a few candidates left and any sophomore who wants a date should get in touch with him. As stated before, this dance is for sophomores, with the exception of those upperclassmen who have re- ceived invitations. Fiegenbaum has employed a squad of N. Y.

This was an increase of 12.17 per cent over the amount contribut- ed by this group last year. The students of the college will be solicited for the Red Cross con- tributions when they conduct their ca~pus \community cheo.\ cam- paign next spring. It is hoped that $100 to $150 will be raised at that time. Milton M.

Jolm Phillips Assistants Grangl't' Tripp Thomas O'Connor ~~--=='-'----\ ~=~~~-c-·==~===========~~ Friday, December 1, 1939 ======~========~~-~======~==-=========== PONDER THE POSSIBILITIES Last night we had an opportunity to hear the British views on the present international situation at first hand as expound.ed by a man prominent in British Political life. In these fateful days when the life of every American citizen may be intimately effected by events in Europe, such occa- sions as this are of tremendous and unquestionable import- ance and influence upon om· future. Such occasions should be greeted accordingly and treated with thhe intelligence and thought befitting their significance. There can be little doubt that American public opinion to- day favors the cause of the Allies. For this reason if for no other, Lord Cooper's words fell upon willing ears, but fur- ther, his speech was intensely interesting. He presented his points clearly, and in such a forceful manner that the atten- tion of eve1·y thoughtful person present was seized and held in a viselike grip throughout the duration of his talk. By such occurrences as this, public opinion is molded and built up. When a number of such occasions follow one upon another, a vast accumulation of sentiment may rise and boil over, embroiling a peaceful people in mortal combat. Public opinion is a strange and fearful thing. Overnight it can forget the lessons of the ages and hurl millions of men headlong into eternity. Overnight it can change civilization from a machine working to make each individual's life more comf01·table and luxurious to a machine bent upon the de- struction of each individual life. With this in mind, let us consider such thoughts as Lord Duff-Cooper left with us last night with a careful deliber- ation, with as few prejudices as possible. Let us remember that no hurried judgments and emotional statements without due and careful consideration of every fact at our command. PRIMA DONAS? Boo I Siss!

Vannier 1 Guibert Made Co-Captains A pair of Jaclcs-Vannier and Guibcrt--will open the 1940 grid season for the Dutchmen. Co-cap- tains· were elected last Monday by the varsity football lettermen to succeed Sam Hammerstrom who lead the Garnet team in a perfect season this year. Both Guibert and Vannier will be playing their last season for Union after two years of varsity service and one year on the fr·esh- man squad. The two men worked together in a pass combination this year. Vannier made two touch- downs on runs and Guibert took time out from his excellent tack- ling and all-round defense wizardry to tally on9 score. Guibert has won his \Block U\ as center on the Varsity lacrosse team and in 1938 he won an \aUa\ in football as did Vannier. Neither won his \Block U\ last year in foot- ball because they were ineligible for away games. Guibert is affiliated with the Chi Psi fraternity and Vannier is of the same fraternity as this year's c a p t a i n , Sa m Hammerstrom- Lambda Chi Alpha. \Blackjack\ Guibert, who lives in Baldwin, Long Island, won his freshman numerals in football and lacrosse, while Vannier was awarded num- erals in baslcetball and football.

Garis think he would be the recipient of a slaughtered gob- bler when he blithely suggested that the Faculty Club enliven its Wednesday evening's meetin~ with a turkey raffle. Came Wednesday evening and the raffle, came the winning ticket and the gobbler to Mrs. Garis. Not at all disconcerted by the sudden possession of a tm·I,ey, the Dean quickly planned a. din- ner for Thursday evening for the members of the Hoube Com- mittee of Hale House and thtir wives. Fourteen persons were present to enjoy the results of the Dean's brain-child. Freshman 'Records' Are Distributed Because they reel that Hell Week and paddling are outmoded, un- worthy of present-day fraternity men, the 131 delegates to the Na- tional Undergraduate Interfrater- nity Conference passed a resolution expressing strong disfavor of Hell Week practices and urging inter- fraternity councils throughout the country to co-operate with college and university administrators in substituting orientation programs and Greek Weelts for physical haz- ing. Union College's representative to the conference was George Miller, '40, of Phi Gamma Delta. Scholarship, chap t e t' officers training schools, deferred rushing, quota systems, and counteracting \distorted ven;ions of fratHnity life as portrayed in picture maga· zines and movies\ were among the subjects discussed by the 400 dele- gates to the Conference in their 31st annual session at the Biltmore, December 1 and 2. A feature of the undergt·aduates' meeting, at which delegates repre- sented the interfraternity councils of 69 college and universities and 52 national fraternities, was a \bull session\ put on the air by the Co- lumbia Bt•oadcasting System.

Professor J. Hat·old Wittner, di- rector of athletics, made the awards which are inscribed with the player's name and position. At the top of the gold football there is a garnet \U\ with the numbers \19\ and \39\ engraved on each Eide. \Undefeated\ is engraved on the front. Coaches Honored Those who received the awards are: Head Coach Nelson W. Niti'!h- man, Line Coach Albert E. Ciampa, AEEistant Coach Arthur C. Lawr- ence, Edwin A. Fitz, hainer: Ca.p- tain Samuel C.

When the Junior Prom, one of the outstanding social events of the year, is held in the Spring, it will be the first :ouch affair to be man- aged by an appointed committee. In past yeats, the junior class has elected 'its own Prom committees, but financially unsucce::sful dances occurred in the change of policy. Under the new system, tepresen- tatives of each of the 17 fratern- ities, the three dormitory delegates and four day students ar·e members of the committee. Each group rec- ommended two of its members who were considered by the junior class officers and the chairman of the student body. This group made r·ecommendations to the Executive Committee of the Student Council which made the final selections. Mackenzie Chairman Seven of the 24 men will form the executive committee of which Kenneth Mackenzie, of the Phi Gamma Delta fraternity, will be chairman. The executive committee will take charge of dance arrange- ments, including the booking of an Oichestt·a and planning decorations, while the other committeemen will be in charge of the sale of tickets. In addition to MacKenzie, Edwin W. Scantlebury, representing Delta Phi; Robert Corby, Delta Upsilon; Laskar Schwaztz, Kap.p<J. Nu; Al- bert S. Callan Jr., Sigma Phi; Mason Hutchins, Theta Delta Chi, and Cecil Angell, a day student, will serve on the executive com- mittee. The other committee members and their group are: Clarence H.

The halcyon days of the Silliman Hall typing lm- reau. telephone exchange and reading· room should, they agreed, become a matter of history. No misanthropes were these men when they decreed that henceforth the publications' office will be open only to l'epre- sentatives of the college pul>lications. Fortunate in having at their disposal one of the best equipped small college news- paper offices in this section. they merely wish to keep it such, and recent ai.Juses of the offices and its facilities by undergraduates not affiliated with any publication have proved that the former \open house\ policy was not one in- tended to preserve anJ·thing less durable and stationary than a bank vault. Typewriters have i.Jeen damaged, important exchange pa- pers \borrowed equipment has disappeared, and each month The Concordiensis has been called upon to pay long-distance toll charges for calls made from its telephone by unknown students who, in all probability, were on their way to rob some of the town's poorer blind. Therefore, though all term papers from this day hence be written in longhand and though all contact with the outside world be cut off, the editors regretfully announce that the publications' office is open for business-only. FITTING TRIBUTE The recent announcement of the beginning of the annual intramural basketball tournament together with the state- ment that over 180 students are expected to pal'ticipate in the court games this year attests to the popularity of the athletic department's extensive intramural program. The commendable work done by the department 111 en- couraging participation in these contests may be overlooked by the average observe!' in the general fanfare attendant upon varsity sports. When we recall, howeve1·, that 565 stu- dents, o1· approximately 67 ';t of the und-ergraduate body, participated in at least one intramural sp01-t last year, we gain a better appt·eciation of the popula1·ity of the program. Any campus institution which attracts over 550 students during the course of a year is deserving of commendation; the athletic department's intramural games more particularly so in view of the beneficial results of the program. Students who have neither the time nor the ability to participate m varsity athletics, are afforded an opportunity to engage\ in their favorite sport, under competitive conditions, and with competent supervision and officiating. Not only are these men exercising in an enjoyable way, but they are gaining a new understanding of the techniques and skills .employed in the respective sports, and are better able to appreciate major contests. The endorsement of the program by so many participating students is the most eloquent tl'ibute that can be paid the athletic department and the men conducting these intramural games. GZecho~lovakia.

Ac- more comfot·table way of life than tually we i.Jelieve that there is some- thing mor·e in the argument than their own. There you have; comi- that, but it is something which may easily be lost in the hatred of a long and ugly conflict. But that last phrase brings us to our final thought for the morn- ing. From a more or le~s near-at- hand point of view. it ~trikes us that one can't postuate even those attributes-longness and ugliness-- :>f this affair. Very common indeed is becoming the phrase in the more subjective articles in the British press, \Yes it's a funny war.'' The western front apparently has set- tled down into a state of siege and stalemate for the wintet·-as it was bound to do in a war of concrete fortresses. The trench is on the way out as strategic fashions alter, and stories reach us of Ger- man and French soldiers meeting along little streams someplace in no-man's land to do their Monday morning washing. The R.A.F. also comes m for its share of peculiarities. There's no sense in reiterating the fact that it has been busier dropping leaflets than bombs, but perhaps it is not general known home that this per- formance-along with the black- out and gasoline rationing - has administered a vigorous shot in the arm to British humor. The leaflet yarns fall into two c!asses-thost> which concern the one pilot who re- turned from his missive-dropping a.ssignment too late, and the other who got home long before his col- leagues. Seems that the former gent had taken his task a bit too seriously and distributed his hand- bills under German doormats, but when the commandant queried Pi- lot No. 2 on his premature return, the latter was surprised that he had been expected to take any long- er. Then his superior began to see the light. \MacDonald said he, \you didn't dump the whole bun- dle in one lump, did you?\ \Och- aye I did. Weren't I sup- posed to, sir?\ \Supposed to-why, my God, man -you may have killed someone!'\ And that's the war as we see it now. However, as the proverbial man in the street hereabouts puts it-'as long they didn't get Him with that bomb the other night, He's bound to start the bloody busi- ness sooner or later-but the later the better for us.' As we write, the Reichwehr is massed on the Dutch frontier. What that may mean to the Low Countries and to American public opinion we care not to con- sider. Three significant pieces of news have emanated from the WGY news broadcasts in the last fort- night, the last two falling on the credit side of the ledger: <1} our return ticket on the United States Lines seems on the verge of de- function, (2} the Neutrality Bill has finally been pa.ssed, and l3l Union, Z7-Will!ams, 7. cal, isn't it? Dis~enters will speedily point out tha.t Ninotchka and the three com- t a des, supposed to represent the Russian commissariat, are in real- ity unreasonably inaccurate fac- similes of same -that they are no mote lifelike than Arthur Treach- er's English butlers or Shirley Temple's little girls. All this may be, but it doesn't alter the fact that the notion of good, reliable Matxists wading knee-deep in cap- italistic decadence, and enjoying it, is an amusing, entertaining one. Melvyn Douglas, Ina Claire and the Messrs. Granach, Bressart and Rumann are very good indeed. Miss Gat bo is as fascinating and as adept at comedy as she is at any other dramatic form: that makes her number one in anybody's league. Victor McLaglen and his con- science have a good at The Big Guy, Proctor's second feature. Old Vic holds out almost until the end, but his conscience is stricken early in the fifth reel. ---o---- Chemistry Students To Visit New York Students in the Chemistry De- partment are planning a trip to New York City for December 6 and 7 to visit chemical exhibits and inspect several refining plants, it was announced yesterday.

For the past week the varsity hat : · had dummy d-rills and scrimmage~· with the freshman £quad after hav- · mg completed the preliminary prac- lice in fundamentals the ptev10us week. V/ith the addition of four varsity football me.1 early last week, the Garnet £quad numbers approxi- mately a dozen.

Working on Defense In\ preparation for the opening game with Stevens one week from tonight, the varsity is spending a grea:t deal of time on improving its defensive play. More scrimmages with the yearlings and perhaps a practice game later i-n the week are on schedule according to Coach Nitchman. Forwards George :viiller and AI Turchiclt, Center Herb Watson, and Guards Mickey Rathlev and Lou Carr have proven most promising in the early practice, Nitchman ex- plained. Sophomore Jaclt Jacobow-- dki, who was unable to play on the freshman team last year because ul' iliness, has :;hown up very well in pre-season practice. The Stevens squad, which has been practicing since the first ot October. contains two outstanding players in the persons of Israe1 and Brush. Israel is an exceptional long set shooter, while Brush's speciality is his ability to follow up short shots. The center of last year's Stevens' junior varsity is a good rebound man and will havo> to be watched closely. The Engineers play a man to man defense and have a tricky weaving offense. ---0·--- INTRAMURALS Ca?tain Sam Hammerstrom, of the undefeated varsity elPven, cuts viCt:Jry cai•P !.'t f-cotball b:mquet en Novemter 21 a'3 Union celebrates its f-irst undef·e·ated sea~on since -1914.

Second is Alpha Delta Phi with nine, while Kappa Nu, Kappa Sigma and Phi Sigma Kappa are all tred for third with eight men each. Although \Hell Week\ has beeN officially abolished, the usual pmnks have been reported and it is rumored that ,;everal freshme~1 have taken long wall's in the late evening. The following men are candidates for membership in their respective houses: ALPHA DELTA PHI: Franci3 P. hatching session.

Declaring that \persecution is not an invention uf the twentieth century\ but \has been a very com- mon experience in the past,\ Dr. Leo Strauss, the exHed German political philosopher and historian suggested Wednesday night that \the experience 0f ou·r generation might supply us with a key to some earlier writings which up to now have been rather baffling.\ In delivering the Lchaborl Spen- cer lecture on the subject of \per- secution and the art of writing,\ the American Philosophical Asso- ciation visiting lecturer told his audien.::e that since \persecution seems to be the rule governing the fate of mankind and freedom of speech a not too frequent excep- tion,\ he wondered \whether a con- siderable part of the literature produced in eras of persecution in. the past has. not been deeply af- flicted by pet·secution; that is to say, whether outstanding writers of the past have not represented their views about the then crucial topics exclusively betwe!O'n the lines.\ Views on Persecution To Prom Committee The Student Council went on rec- ord as being in favor ·Of adopting a campus community chest at Union in its meeting on Wednesday eve· ning. No definite method of admin· ister ing the chest was advanced at the meeting, According to tentative arrangements, however, the en tire student body will be solicited for funds by the committee in charge. An executive group would then aear all requests for donations, and would di~tribute these funds to the applying charities as it saw fit. It was pointed out that several other Eastern colleges have adopted such a plan. The recent action of the Exec- utive Committee in naming the campus groups which would be eli- gible for free bids to the Junior Prom was reversed ·by the Council, when it voted that the Prom Com- mittee itself be permitted to decide who would receive complimentary tickets to the dance.

An N. Y. A. student has been obtained to assist the committee in this work, he said. The Council heard the report of the Tax Committee which had ap- proved the $65 budget submitted 'by the Interfraternity Council. The Council realized a profit of $160 from its Gridiron Ball, and includ- ed the following expenditures in its budget: $25 for sending a delegate to the National Interf1aternity Council Conference; $25 for the Campus Community Chest; $10 for incidental expenses dut·ing the year; and $5 engraving costs for the scholarship cups which will be presented later in the month. A discussion as to the feasibility of abolishing freshman hair-cuts was cut short by adjournment. -----0---- Kappa Sigma Conclave Here 70th Anniversary To Be Commemorated By Discussions, Dinner Delegates from seven eastern colleges, including four from New York, one from New Jersey, and one from Canada, will be on the Union campus tomorrow and Sat- urday for the district conclave of the Kappa Sigma fraternity.

Twelve Applicants Have Yet to Pass Physical Examination Classroom instruction in aeronau- tics will begin Monday night, De- cember 11, Dr. P. I. Wold, Director of the Civil Aeronautics Authority program on the campus announced to flight applicants at a meeting this morning. The ten men who will be trained in the theory and pr·actice of aet·ona utics have not yet been selected as a final physical examination must be taken. Dr. Wold attributed the delay in starting the course to the rigid physical examinations which have been specified by the C. A. A. auth- orities. He pointed out that the pro- gram could have been under way long ago but many of the applicants were eliminated by the examination which requires almost perfect vi- sion in each eye. Twelve men have passed the preliminary· examination given by the college and will take the more extensive C. A. A. exam- ination which is to be given by Dr. A. W. Green. Subjects Listed Listing the subjects to be taught by the professors who will partici- pate in the course which will be given three nights a week for two hours Dr. Wold said that he will teach Instruments and Radio while Professor Hall, head of the Civil Engineering Department will teach Navigation. Professor E. W. That- cher will handle the Theory of Flight and Aircraft and Dr. Fred- erick W. Grover Meteorology. En- gines, Parachutes, Air Regulations and the History of Aviation will be taught by Mr. Robert Stanley of the Civil Engineering Department. Flight instruction will be in the hands of George C. Haven, Assist- ant Manager of the Schenectady County Airport. The course calls for a minimum of 35 hours of flight instruction. The burden of the costs of both the instruction at Union College and at the airport are borne equally by the participating student and the C. A. A. Br. Wold said. The cost to students is $40 which covers the medical examinations, insurance and otiher incidentals. Each student will be co;,ered by a $3,000 life in- surance and a $500 hospitalization insUJ ancP policr.

Hammerstrom, '40, captain, eastern collegiate high- scorer, scholar, gentleman . Union's \Big Swede\ ... came out of retirement yesterday to take an- other well-deserved bow as the As- sociated Press conferred upon him \Little America\ honors, a recogni- tion awat·ded to only one other easterner. \Little All America\ is a fitting tribute to Coach Nitchman's \gold- en boy,\ whose 86 points and over 1,100 yards gained were no small factor in the achievement of the Garnet's first undefeated season in a quarter·centuty. Union's first son to receive such an honor, Hammerstrom joins a se- lect company. In the backfield with him is the leading scorer in this wide land. Lloyd Madden of Colo- rado College ·of Mines, one of four far-westeners to place on the team, tallied 141 points in eight games, gaining 1,136 yards. Bill Sheridan, Clarion Teachers back whose 81 points enabled him to place second to Hammerstrom, received honorable mention on th<! Associ a ted Pre.;;~ selections. Frank Loughney, a guard at La- Salle College in Pennsylvania, is the only other eastern gridder to make the coveted team honors. Hammerstrom is the sole New York Stater on the eleven. He is also the only member of the backfield com- bination who plays for a school east of the Mississippi. Sole New Yorker Hammer·strom·s greatest individ- ual performance was made away from home. Before a high-spirited University oi Vermont audience and against a team which had been primed to stop him in every de- partment, he smashed through the sixty-minute linemen of the Cata- mounts for gains totaling 177 ~·ards. He passed, and punted, but what is more . . . he led his team and Union came from behind to win 19-6. He also gained more than one hundred yards against every opponent except R.P.I. Union's opponents placed one man on the second team and twelve on \honorable mention.\ Vermont and Middlebury placed four each. while Williams and Trinity were represented by three and two, re- spectively. The following players on teams which opposed Union during the past season were mentioned: Sec- ond team-Dick Lindner, guard, Trinity; honorable mention-Berry, end; Profy, guard; Stabile, center; and Mahoney, bacl{, all of Middle- bury; Wood, Brooks, Head, of Wil- liams were also mentioned. Carlson, Lawrence, Strasburg, and Taylor, were Vermont's representative on the squad, while Carey was the lone Trinity player listed. -----0----- Mountebanks to Present Pre-dinner Music The Mountebanl{s have completed plans for holding a series of \Music You Want to Hear\ programs of recorded mmic on Monday after- noons before dinner-time, Heney C. Meadow, '40, chairman of the com- mittee in charge of the project an- nounced last night. The first all-request program will take place Monday afternoon, De- cember 11, 4 to 5:30 p. m., and will include \Bolero by Ravel, selec- tions of Johann Stl·auss' waltzes, Richard Strauss' \Der Rosenkava- Jier,\ Caesa1· Franck's \Symphonic Variations,\ and Beethoven's \Fifth Symphony.\ The programs will be \very in- formal,\ Meadow emphasized, say· ing students and faculty may come and go, but quietly, whenever they please. The recorded music programs originated when the Mountebanks acquired their high-fidelity sound equipment this year. Those assisting Mead'ow are Everett M. Hafner, '40, Ralph H. 'fiebout, '42, and William J. Lichte, '42. Records are secured .from stu- dents and the College Library.

May, '43, President of the freshman class, told the student body Wednesday, of the experiences of a til·st year mah during his ficst college week. The benefits of freshman camp were enurnera·ted by May who said that this orientation period is help- ful in that it enables the freshman to meet upper-classmen, professors, and the outstanding men of the col- lege. A brief description of the benefits to be obtained by passing through Saratoga on the return to the Cam·pus from Freshman camp W&l a:lso given. \Rush week at Union is an awful lot of fun,\ said May. \The fresh- man is shown all around the cam- pus; he is carefully instructed on the first week routine matters·. He sits at the head of the table with the senims, and is always the cen- ter of attraction. For his evenings entertainment he is offered a choice of several things, and he is not al- lowed to pay for anything.\ The surprise of the freshman upon pledging, when he is assigned to aJ.l sorts of minor duties and the ~hock of being ordered to \Sit Down\ by the sophomores at chapel v.-ere also described by the speaker. ----o-~-- FRESHMAN MEETING A graduate of Pri:acelcm Univer- sity in 19l9, Dr. Van Dusen has done gradHate study at the New College, Edinburg, and Edinburg University.

Such a proposal is scarcely more ludic1·ous than is the humiliation interpretation of the wearing of freshman hats. If, then, the toques were intended to solidify the freshman class, these haircuts defeat the pm-pose. Instead of fostering unity within a class, these attempts to persecute freshmen into respecting their class and college, do little other than breed animosity between classes, and even less desirable, be- tween individuals in the classes. If freshman camp, freshman dances, and interclass athletic contests cannot encourage this class spirit, certainly no amount of coercion will perform the task. The \back-yard\ forensics which resulted from a recent· attempt to administer one of these coiffures vvas a condem- nation of the entire system, and was a furthe1· proof of the very nebulous nature of the rules governing the haircuts. The final bit of repartee-\Never mind, we'll get him yet, and when we do-what a haircut he'll get, and what a pad- cUing!\ we feel, is epitomatic of the vindictive chal'acter of the entire system.

Fuli Line' of Christmas Cards Beautiful Cql)~ge Scenes Order Early At the Union College Bookstore You~d he surprised how telephone engineers put them to work for you How to put more and more wires into a telephone cable without increasing its diameter is an ever present problem at Western Electric-manufacturing unit of the Bell System. Existing ducts bo-neath city streets limit both the number and the diameter of cables-but demand for tele- phone service continues to grow. Until recently, the largeflt cable contained 3636 ~ires in a diameter of 2% inches. Years of study led to an en- tirely new insulating process that saved 3/1000 of an inch per wire. Multiply this tiny fraction of an inch by 3636, and you provide enough space to place 606 more wires in the same size cable!- a total of 4242. With such resourcefulness, Bell System engineers meet countless problems. Result: you can talk to almost any- one, anywhere-qriickly, at low cost. st: )a· be ar WI u h~ fi A is p jt: nE a pl e~ d' p: 1~ tl N cl c Cl c~

The \insr:rlp- tions\ may be roughly grouped un- dei' four general headings: art, poetry, prose, and chronology, Among chapel artists, the first ranking subject is Felix, the cat, with the \Goon\ a close second. The prose selections contain a· number of musings thus: \Chapel' today was lousy.\ \What is this, a· history lecture?\ \I'm getting fed up with this organ recital.\ \'R\Y' tor the class of (censored).\ We tried to find some poetry tha~ we could run, but we only found poetry, so that department is miss- ing from our little summary. Chronology, however, seems most popular with the chapel-bored. One individual recorded faith- fully the time of each Sunday morn- ing prayer for the entire sch(lo! year 1925-26. Other chroniclers bring the r·ecord up to February, 1936-although the gaps are large between dates. The marke·r got marked-when someone recorded Dr. Bacon's bolts for a semester. During Week-end Fraternities Admit Men Before Christmas For First Time Initiating theil· pledges before Christmas for lhe fi.rst time in the history of the college, the Union 1 fraternities have accepted a total of 108 new men into membership. Because of the district Kappa I' Sigma conclave held at Union last 1 : week-end, the Kappa Sigma hou:oe I' initiated its eight new members , two weeks ago. The remainder of the Union fraternities initiated on Friday and Saturday of this week. Sigma Chi initiated the largest number of pledges, inducting . eleven. Alpha Delta Phi and Phi I Sigma Kappa were second with nine each, while Kappa Nu and Kappa Sigma were tied for third with eight each. Percentage Is Lower The National Fraternity has placed first in scholastic achieve- ment among the college frater- nities throughout the country, according to a statement issued upon the r.:ceipt of the averages from the scholarship committee of the National Interfraternity Conference which recently held its annual meeting in New York City. This is the third year in suc- ceEsion that Kappa Nu has placed at the top in national schohrship honors and it is the fir~t 1raternity to attain this po- sition for that length of tim<>. According to the plan submitted: by President David Hayner, each tr:aternity would have a series of· meals costing as little as possible, and the difference in cost between these and the regular meals would be co'llected and used next spring, when work on Alexander Field starts. It is believed that Hale Hcuse would cooperate with the plan if it is put into effect. At pres- ent, the suggestion has been re- f~rred to the fraternities for con- sideration, and definite action Will be taken at the next Interfrater- nity Council meeting. In fact, a whole student history of Union-without gaps-is to be obtained right in Memorial Chapel in the form of a flock of timeworn, and time respected hymn books. ------------------------~---- Chi Psi, Phi Delta Theta, Psi Upsilon and Sigma Phi each in- itiated seven men to tie for fourth place. Following them in order were Dr Ita Upsilon. Ph: Sigma Delta and Kappa Alpha with six men each, Phi Gamma Delta with five, Delta Chi and Beta Theta Pi with four, Delta Phi with three and Theta Delta Chi with two. Freshmen Learn Success Factors Suggestions Offered A number of suggestions for fu- ture work were also presented to the council by the Fraternity Alumni Advisory Group which met last week. Among these were the pos- sibility of a periodic audit of fra- ternity finances. under the supervi- sio r: of the college; the institutio•l of a plan providing for publishing a list of pledged men daily during orientation week and the hrst week of college; provi,.ion for a seminar for stewards on house buying and management to be sponsored by the interfraternity council; and ar- rangements for a uniform system of group chaperonage in the public rooms of the fraternities. Cups To Be Presented These suggestions were also re- ferred to the frater.nities for con- \ideration and discussion. Action may be taken on some of these at the next meeting. It was also re- ported that the scholar~hip cup~ which were bought last year, are now being engraved and will be presented in •:hapel next Saturday.

Saturday's program consisted of a banquet at the Mohawk Country Club. Hamilton W. Baker, Worthy Grand Master of Kappa Sigma and President Dixon Ryan Fox of Union were the principal speal{ers .. Mr. Baker discussed the District Leadership Award to be given an- nually to one of the Kappa Sigma chapters in this section, while Dr. Fox discussed the relationship be- tween a fraternity and a .college .. Dr. Otto J. Walrath, '09, was toast-, master. Other speakers Satur·day evening inCluded Angelo Sederis, '40, presi- dent of the local chapter, Myron L. Stillman, '40, Thomas Brown, Kappa Sigma alumnus, and W. Gorton Taylor, adviser of the Union Chapter, Advertising Costs Topic of Debate Drs. Dameron, Warne Disagree on Subject At Town Meeting Expressing uivergent views re- garding the justification of adver- tising costs, Dr. Kenneth Dameron, piofessor of marketing at Ohio State Univer.sity, and Dr. Colston E. Warne, associate professor of economics at Amherst College, speaking at the Empire State Town Meeting in Old Chapel, both agreed, however, that the consumer pays for advertising as well as other pro- duction and distribution costs in- volved in the manufacture and sale of products. Dr. Dameron, who was deputy administrator in charge of .retail and wholesale codes during the N.R.A., said that he believed that \the purpose of advertising is to sell or facilitate the maldng of a sale of goods or services,\ and that \advertising costs are justified be- . cause advertising indirectly lowers the cost of products.\ Cost Can Be Justified In reply to Professor Warne's charge that advertisements do not give full specifications regarding products, Dr. Dameron pointed out that the American Association Ad- vertising Agencies had led in the raising of standards of truth in ad- vertising. However, he said that he did not wish to \ignore the favor- able points of advertising in his appraisal.\ Professor Dameron was emphatic that the cost of advertising can be, and is, justified to our economic so- ciety. He explained that \mass production itself would not be feasible unless the standardized product of the machines could be sold in sufficient quantities to keep the plant efficiently busy ... aqver- tising extends the market ... and contributes to a higher level or scale of livinj!;.\ ----10---- New Program for I. R. C. To Attract Students The Union College International Relations Club will be reorganized after the Christmas recess to in- clude a program designed to at- tract students in the government courses, it was announced yester- day by Roger D. Marshall, '41. In an effort to obtain suggestions for the re-organization program Marshall attended a conference held Friday and Saturday at the New Jersey Women's College at New Brunswick. The main speaker of the conference was Dr. Freder- ick Schumann, Williams lecturer, who gave documentary evidence to prove that by June 23rd there were private information agencies in Europe which ·knew of the impend- ing German-Russian accord. All-Sophomore Dance Is Financial Success A profit of $5.00 was realized from the All-Sophomore dance, lleld on December 2, a report recently filed by the committee in charge of the dance revealed. The total revenue of $135.80 was derived from the sale of 130 tickets at $1.00 each together with the $4.80 profit realized from a refreshment concession. Ten complimentary bids to the fin:t sophomore class dance to be held at Union since the turn of the century were issued to prominent upperclassmen, the I eport disclosed. The largest item in the $130.80 expense budget was the $89.00 paid for Freddie Bellinger's twelve piece orchestra. Decora- tions were listed at $24.40, while printing and publicity charge;;; amounted to $7.90. Incidental ex- penses included $5.00 for jani- torial services and a $1.00 truck- ing fee for the transporting of a piano which the committee bar .. rowed from an off-campus fra- ternity to the gymnasium. Tele- phone charges and other mis- cellaneous expenses were paid for by members of the com· mittee. The number of men initiated equalled 44.8';; of the number in the freshman class, slightly less than last year's 45.7'/f-. However, the 131 men initiated equalled 82<;{ of tho men pledged this year, while a corresponding proportion for last year· was only 75<;<. To complete the program of Ini- tiation week-end, most of the houses held banquets or formal dances Saturday evening, while a few others completed initiation ceremonies on that night. The new imtiation date was the re~ult of a resolution passed by the Interfraternity Council last March. It was felt at that time that the March date used until this year was too late, causing some fresh- men to lose interest in their frater- nities. At the same time it was pointed out that the earlier date would make it easi-o>r for; some of the alumni to visit their chapter during initiation week-end. It was at this time that Hell Week was officially abolished by . the Interfraternity Council. The 1 pranks imposed upon the pledges I were strongly cnticized by Presi- dent Fox, who declared thai they \rendered the college ridiculous.\ Marks First, Wyatt Says; Stresses Poise. Personality in Advice The desirable qualifications lead- ing to success after college wet·e discussed by Frederic A. Wyatt at a meeting of the freshman class yestet·day in Old Chapel. The six most important qualifications Wyatt listed are: scholarship, energy, re- liability, personality, discipline and imagination. He said that extra- curricular activities were very valu- able and that personnel men are particularly interested in the per- centage of college expenses that the individual is able to earn. Il was pointed out that the man who could speak in public and the man who could feel at ease as an after dinner speaker was the one that would most likely be cho:.en by personnel managers. Hobbies and general cultural background are also taken into consideration, he said. Freshmen were advised to fill out the sheets for the employment bu- reau supplied at the meeting and were invited to call persomt1ly at the Placement Bureau and to d;s- cuss their plans. President Fox Receives Unique Cancelled Post Card From Schenectady Stamp Collecting Enthusiast Fr·om among the many hobbies~•>---------------- ----------------- which men follow, this week there Post Card Bearing President's Name arose one of the most interesting. Joseph P. Thompson, a retired General Electric engineer mailed to President Fox a post-card bear- ing five post office cancellations which spt>lled out \DIXON <Calif.) RYAN <W. Va.l FOX <Mich.), UNION <Maine) COLLEGE <Ga.)\ and asked Dr. Fox to autograph the card. Those who saw the unique post card on President Fox's desk in- vestigated and found that Mr. Thompson had been active in this hobby for about two years after more than a dozen years of active stamp-collecting. Mr. Thompson bored somewhat with mere stamp collecting branch- ' ed out to collect post-office can- cellations.

Sophomore Dance Financial Success PRICE FIVE CENTS Protest Hints Penalty Changes For Freshmen Council President Carr ·Explains Actions Of Discipline Group In an attempted clarification of the entire freshman haircut situ- ation. Louis J. Car'!', President t'f the Student Council, gave a com- plete explanation of the action of the Sophomore Discpline Commit- tee over the weekend to the fresh- man class ill a meeting in Old Chapel yesterday. Carr explained that he thought the situation was the result of a misunderstanding a n d n o t h i n g more. During the meeting he asked several members of the freshman class to express their views, but re<:eived little re;;ponse directly af- fecting the case. Wearing freshman caps until the Christmas vacation is a college rule, not a sophomore rule, Carr ex- plained. To see that those rules were not broken the Student Coun- cil appointed members of the sopho- more class to be known as the Sophomore Discpline Committee. George Anderson, President of the Sophomore Class said that the Dis- cipline Committee was augmented when an agreement was made stat- ing that eac11. member could pick one assistant. This committee has functioned throughout the fall, having the campus barber admin- ister haircuts to all freshmen who repeatedly broke the freshman rules, Haircuts Arouse Protests Last week, when upperclassmen protested to the Sophomore Dis- cipline Committee against plans to inflict maximum penalties on two freshmen, the committee became incensed and forced the freshmen to report to the barbershop for their haircuts. This action aroused a storm of protest, an investigation into the rights of the Sophomore Discipline Committee and a sounding out of campus opinion. Carr attempted to clarify the situation by explaining the duties of the Committee as es- tablished at its origination and Sl'.id that the action of the committee was not the result of hard feelings between the two classes and that there was not, at present, anv sem- blance of ill-will. A suggestion was made to the Student Council that it substitute a new form of punishment for the l'Xisiting haircut penalty to be im- posed on uncooperative freshme;l. In reply to this suggestion, Robert Baker, chairman of the Sophomore Discipline Committee, said that he was in entire sympathy with the propasal and felt that it would be a needed improvement, if an ade- quate substitute for the tonsorial could be found. ----0---.- Dr. Strauss Will Speak To Classical Club Members Dr. Leo Strauss, visiting profes- sor of Political Philosospy, will be the speaker at the regular monthly meeting of the Classical Club on Tuesday evening, December 12, at the home of Dr. Gem·ge D. Kel- logg. The meeting. called for 7:3D o'clock, will be devoted to an ad- dress by Dr. St1 auss, followed by a discussion, on the subject of \Xen- ophon as a Writer of Political Pamphlets.\ Dr. Strauss has had an article published in the November, 1939, issue of \Social Research,\ an in- ternational publication devoted to social and political science. This article, entitled \The Spirit of Sparta, or the Ta~te of Xenophon,\ reveals a new controversial subject in conjunction with the writings of this ancient author. All men in the division of litera- ture are invited to attend, and they are asked to notify Dr. Kellogg if they plan to be present for the meeting. An effort will be made to begin a policy henceforth of leaving the meetings adjourned by 9:00p.m. in order to avoid conflicts with later appointments. Those who wish to participate in the informal discus- sion afterward are given an oppor- tunity of questioning the speaker and .enlarging views on the eve- ning's topic.

It is the inability to foretell events that makes news reports so fascinating to most people. The strange devel· opments which have taken place in the recent past have extended the limits of belief and expectation so that now, more than ever, we won- der what will happen next. As we pick up a newspaper or turn on the radio, howevet·, there is one bit of news which may be antidpated and which seldom varies. With al· most monotonous regularity we learn that all was ca•l•m on the westet n front bet ween F-rance and Germany. ·Constant repetition of I this report has at oused sarcastic and humorou,. remarks, and has made many people begin to wonder if Germany and the allies arc in-· volved in a real wat' after al.J. \\'here >:uch skepticism ex.ists we may strongly ::;uspect the absence of adequate knowledge of the cir- cumstances in this and past Euro- pean wars. Needless to say, for those few brave but unsung heroes who fall daily during the patrol or scout-ing work, there is just as much horror in this conflict as in any other. It do~s not seem quite fair that a few should risk their lives while .others remain in the comparative safety of strong forts, and yet it is a part of military discipline which re- quires only action, not thought. Once these men are gone, it wtll do them little good to have others follow. They died for theit· com- rades and for their country, and this devotion can best bP rPpaid by thnt vi~tory whif'h thPy foug-ht for but did not live to see, The tiize of an army is, of course, im.pottant, but not so important as it once was. Victory now depneds to a great ex- tent on equipment, and to a greater extent on a capable leader who waits patiently until the time comes Quintessence of the cream. Such a title might ·well l.Je ap- plied to the l'nion chaptet· of Kappa ~u. According to recent schohtrship 1·eports released l.Jy the ~atiunal Intel'fratemity Council, the Kappa l'\u J'Jaternity was awarded first place in the national fratemity ratings. L:nion'::; Iota chapter won the Kappa Nu scholarship award this fall for the third consecu- tive year, according to an announcement by Benjamin ~aum­ off, national secretary of the f1·atel'llity, thus establishing itself as the !Jest chapter in the top-ranking fraternity. Cer- tainly such an enviable achievement should rank Iota of Kappa Nu as one of the best chapter houses of any national fraternity in the land. to strike. Preparedness as we know it today never before existed. Only a fool would sacrifice a million or more lives in an assault on the Maginot or Siegfried lines. There are othet· ways to gain victory at less expense. We have only to turn our attention from the western front to the ocean lanes of the world to see clearly that Germany I and the allies mean what they say when they speak of a struggle to the bitter end. I Food i:; the ·best ammunition known. DeprivP your enemy of it and the guns will soon cease to fire. Progress in this war can, therefore, be measured by the rapidity with which one country deprives the other of food for human consump- tion, and materials to feed the hun- gry machines in factories which much operate to satisfy the coun- The feat of the house stands as a refutation of the oft- try's needs.

It is hardly necessary to bring to mind· the· great number of ships of all nations which have gone to the bottom. This does not, of course, take into account the many ill-fated submarines which have .become tombs for many men whom death found far under the waves where we .could not see. A successful blockade does, of couree, bring untold suffering to the vic- tim, but to the victor, the price paid is comparatively small, and after all, the object is to triumph with the least amount of expense and hardship. Small indeed is the English loss compared to what the French would Jose in a foolish at- tack. Ships can be soon replaced, but lives, never. The losoing side may eventually attack on land, but in the meantime, let those who are here, impatient for action, remem- ber that every minute of inactivity means millions of minutes of life abroad. Not disgust, but joy, should greet the announcement of peace on the western front. War can be real and yet accomplish its purpose wiht a minimum of violence. The Concordiensis salutes Iota of Kappa Nu, five time win- ner of the Berg Cup on its third consecutive national triumph. IN THE MAIL The Communists are afoot again! Some say that the broadcasting companies have subsidized the :Memorial Chapel. Others insist that the Administration is contem- plating the organization of a new Protestant sect. The pseudo-Communists are certain that the College has launched a stupendous program in an endeavor to place Dr. Tidmarsh at Radio City's Grand Console. We do not feel that the Communists are attacking either Dt·. Tidmarsh or his performances at the console, But Tidmarsh has been successfully spotted on both Fri- day morning and Sunday afternoon programs and the Communists are determined that if the College insists upon \organ recitals between prayet·s,\ then a certain amount of the \take\ should be allotted to the Musicians Emergency Fund. Both Elmore 1\IcKee and Ralph Sockman in New York City conduct their Sunday services in the orthodox man- ner. Afte1· the benediction, the congregation rises and, to the somber strains of organ music, departs from the church. In Boston, Dr. Arthur Lee Kinsolving also ad- heres to tradition. But here at Union College, and this is where the Communists may have a point, the tradition of the established church is too good. We take our stand along with the more distinguished rectors of the day. So long as Sunday services are held in the Union College ::\Iemorial Chapel, and so long as those services are held primarily for the benefit of the student l.Jody, students even being compelled to attend a certain number of services, we prefer to end the Sunday .service, not with the organ virtuosity of Dr. Elmer Tidmarsh, but rather with the usual \ .•. light of his· countenance shine upon you, and give you peace. Amen/' Hasty decision is one of the greatest causes of error. We should realize by now that most problems are not as simple as they seem, and that there may be others in the world who can solve them better than we because of more thorough training and intimate knowledge. Let us do that to which we are best adapted and leave the generals in command of the army. It is very easy indeed to be liberal with the lives of others. ----0---- NEWMAN CLUB TO MEET The Newman Club will hold a meeting this evening at 7:30 in Sil- liman Hall.

Three Seniors HI; May Not See Action Against .Engin.eers as Quintet Attempts To Avenge Last Season's Defeat After five strenuous weeks of practice sessions, Coach Nels Nitchman's 193!9-40 varsity basketball team will make its. debut tomorrow night against the Engineers of Stevens In- stitute of Technology in the Alumni Gymnasium. The game wil'l start at eight o'clock. Stevens defeated Vnion Iast sea- son by the score of 35 to 20. Pre-game observers, who classed@.·~---------­ the two teams a:> about equal, in the most .part changed their epin- ions today when it was learned that George MHler and Co-captains Herb Watson and Leu Carr might not see action in the game. Miller is suffering from a wrenched ankle, auff~red in the practice scrimmage with the General Electric Athletic Association team Th1u·sday nig·ht. Both Watson and Carr have been suffering from severe colds. The injured men, all seniors, are the backbone of the present aggrega- tion. In the case that Miller, Carr and Watson do not play, Larue Bu- chanan, a senior, Jack Vannier, a junior, and Ben Jackobowski, a sophomore, will replace them. Alex Turchick and Mickey Rathlev, twe junior·,; who saw a good deal of ac- tion last season, will be the other two starters. Drilled on New Offense Coach Nitchman had the squad go through a light workout yester- day, with shooting practice taking up most of the session. The same procedure is scheduled for today. The new type five point offense which the five is using this season has been drilled into the squad vigorously threughout the past two weeks ·by Nitchman, and it will get its test tomorrow evening. This type offense replaces the weaving attack that Union teams have em- ployed in the past. The system uses a combination of a fast and slow break. The team has been drilled to play against a zone and a close pressing defense. Stevens UE'ed both last season. The Engineers present a unique team in that no three year varsity rule is enforced at the Hoboken, New Je1sey, institution, and thus freshmen are likely to see action. Stevens, however, has five of last year's lettermen returning to the court. Captain Hal Brush and Ed Israel are the big guns of the Red and Grey attack. Brush is an ex- pert on lay-up shots while Israel has an excellent eye for long shots. Lee Kreke, Pete Dobi and Frank Mar tin are the other lettermen who will see action tomorrow night. Stevens Wealt on Defense To date, the Stevens quintet has displayed a powerful offense but seems to be lacking in the defensive department. Coach Frank Partel has been combining a zone with a man-to-man system. Captain Brush, a guard, is a fast and tireless courtrnan along with being an inspired leader. Israel, the team's high scorer, will be at the other guard slot. Bob Leek and Dobi wHl start at forwards with Martin at center. Three freshmen, Ben Lewis, Ed Tuttle and Torn Schober, and Krake will see plenty of action as reserves. Ed Numata, Gary Hein, Mal Fireetone, Tony Welti and Tom Petty are the other men on the .Stevens squad. Several players will be seen in Garnet basketball uniforms for the first time in their college careers tomorrow night. Fred Patrie, '40, and Jack Vannier, '41, :both foot- ball players, reported for the team this season. Vannier may start to- morrow.

On Wednesday~ the gym will be available to 2:30 p. m. 5. The play will consist of a !eng shot and follow-up. The long shot shall be taken from the white line directly beyond the foul line; if made, it shall count two points. The follow- up shall be talren from the ex- act spot where the ball is re- trieved after the long shot, no dribble-ins. The follow-up, if made, shall count one point. If the ball leaves the court in taking the long shot, the fol- low-up shall be automatically void. In starting a match, the winner of the toss shall shoot first and then alternately. A match shall consist of the best two out of three games. The loser of a game shall shoot first in the following game. 6. In order to gain entrance points at least five men from each group must compete. 7. Additional points will be awarded on the following basis: The largest number of victories necessary to win the championship will be divided into the 50 additional points and the quotient shall be given for each match won. Forfeits and byes shall con- stitute a victory. 8.

Any disputes as to rules are to be referred to Mr. Ketz. CAUTION: Only enter men who you are sure will corn- pete. If a man is entered and forfeits a match his group will be penalized 10 points. whom may start, have shown good form.

In order that a student may have opportunity to properly plan his work, he should investigate these requirements at an early stage in his preparation. <5) The State of New York also requires a minimum of 18 semes- ter hours of professional prepara- tion. At Union this requirement is satisfied by a sequence of three courses; namely, Psychology 3, Psychology 4, and Psychology 22. In the five year program Psychology will be taken in the junior year, Psychology 4 in the senior year, and Psychology 22 will be limited to fifth year students who have al- ready taken Phychology 3 and Psy- chology 4. Members of the Class of 1943 who plan to teach will con- sequently defer Psychology 3 un- til the junior year. <6l Students preparing for sec- ondary teaching will be under the general supervision of a commit- tee, directly charged with the re- sponsibility for the selection and guidance of prospective teache;os. In order to facilitate the proc- esses of selection and guidance it is de;.irable that students who are thinking of secondary teaching should make themselves known as early in their college career as pos- sible. Members of the Class of 1943, who are considering teaching as a possible vocation, therefore, are re- q.uested to register in the Office of the Dean of the College as soon as possible. ---o--- Mountebanks to Offer Second Record Concert Cites Contributions Of Psychology Mountaineering Club. Character Sketch To Human Happiness \I profess that psychology is now prepared to advance a conhibution to human happiness which may well prove the greateot of any of the sciences,\ said Dr. Ernest M. Ligon, Asdstant Professor of Psy- chology in daily assembly yester- day. At the first meeting of the group on last Monday evening, Robert L. Stanley of the Civil Engineering department lectured on the History of Aviation. Professor E. Grover of the Electrical Engineering de- partment spoke on Meteorology and Professor Russell Hall of the Civil Engineering department began his discussion of Navigation for the lecture on Wednesday evening. To- night Professor Hall will complete the instruction of Navigation and Professor Thatcher of the Physics department will begin Aircraft and the Theory of Flight.

Her lower register bett·ayed the qualities of a tired voice, and although the range of this aria is not extt emely great, st:e seemed to carry it purely by fcrce. This was true throughout the whole of the Concert except in Schubert's \Etl- Jwnig,\ in which Miss Lawrence rallied and :leemed to have her umal fire and dramatic vitality adding good color to her voice. In the opinion of this critic it was ·by far the be:;t performance of the evening. Schube!l wa~ carried out with a dramatic gusto cin the .grcup of tthree songs \Mu:;ensohn \Der Lindenbaum,\ and \Erlkonig\. By the end of thi~ group Miss Lawr- ence's personality had litel'Ully gushed out over the footlights. In the next group of three ~ongs by Richard Stt·aU$:\ Mi:'s La wt ence made it quite clear that uncer the existing conditionE she was una-ble to ·bring out the full capabiJ.itie$ of her artistry.

It's getting so that to venture out into the Channel or the North Sea from the east coast is rather like flipping a coin for one's fate. The land campaign seems definitely to have settled down for the duration of cold weather and aerial fighting, while we know that it never el'ases, has lost some of its color by set- tling into a routine, but maritime warfare has perhaps never been more ruthless or indiscriminate than in this last fortnight, Any B.B.C. news bulletin which does not carry th£' rt'port of the >'ink- ing of at least one freighter, trawl- er, or small liner is unique and only suggests that some more tragic disaster will pop up in the next broadcast.

High scorer for the J·ersey team was Ed Israel who scored six field goals and three foul shots for a total of 15 points. The Union sqHad in winning its first opener in three years missed the services of Co-captain Loa Catr and \Shorty\ MiHer, a-lthough La- Rue Buchanan, sabstituting for last year's high scorer, Carr, played a stellar game, scoring eight points and setting up several scores un- der the basket. Also very much ir. evidence was Benny Jakobowski, former Nott Terrace ace, who play- ed his first game in the Garnet uniform, having been prevented from playing freshman basketbaH by an operation. Watson was sec- ond to Rathlev by scoring ten points. Union Takes Lead game: Union- Jakabowski, rf. Buchanan, If. ......... Vannier, If. ...........

Goals by Jakobowski and Rathlev soon put Union out in front and mid- way in the first half Union led by one point, 11 to 10. Tech's last threat in the fit·st half carne at this point, however, taking a lead in the next few minutes, 16 to 15. The Union offensive went into action immediately, scoring 14 consncu- tive points before the bewildered Red and Gray could tally again. Four points each in the rally were scored by Shorty Miller, playing with a taped ankle, and by Co- captain Herb Watson. Jakobowski, Buchanan, and Vannier also con- tributed a field goal each. Vannier and Millet· were the only two re- serves used by Coach :N'itchman during the contest. In connection with the Winter Sports schedule recently distributed at daily assembly the following cor- rections should be made: Fresh- man Basketball-February 10, Al- bany Acad'emy, away; February 24, R.

At the close of the half Union was leading 31 to 20, but the fight- ing Tech team came back to out- play them throughout most of the second half, scoring 20 points to Union's 15.

The Tech team is reputed to have a fairh tight defense. The probable I ineup will be Brunotte and Walsh at the forward positions, Lindeman at center, and Della Rocco and Hef- fernan at guard positions. Both Brunette and Walsh are excellent long shot artists while Lindeman's specialty is pivot shots. Della Rocco is a veteran guard while this will be Hefferan's first year in intercol- legiate courts as he is a freshman . The Engineers use a weavin~ type of attack with Lindeman in the pivot position. They use a zone de- fense but switch to man to man with the situation . Nitchman will drill his squad on retrieving the ball from the back- board and on following up lou~ shots in preparation for the second game of the season. He announced on Thursday that Co-Captain Carr may stil'i be lleld off of the court tomorrow night by his recent iJl- ness.

Competing with Union in the con- tests for the Samuel H. Packer trophy will be Cm·neH, Hamilton, Massachusetts Institute of TP.ch- nology, St. Lawrence, Colgate, Mid- dlebury and Williams. Colgate will be the first oppcment in the opening test for each team when they meet the Dutchmen on New Year's Day. Should Coach Lawrence's team lose to the Red Raiders it wHI continue in the tour- nament as a competitor for one of the three consolation prizes. Win- ners in the opening round will meet each other, while the losers become contestants in the consola- tion tourney. The two losers in the second round will compete with losers in the first consolation brack- et for second and third consolation urizes. · It is probable that stll the• other schools entered in the tournament with the possible exception of Wil- liams and M.I.T. have had the op- portunity to practice on good ice, and this fact is a further dimmer on Union hopes. During the winter holidays last year, Union sent a portion of the team to Princeton while another group took part in the Lake Placid tourney, being eliminated, however, for using in- eligible freshmen in a varsity con- test. The tournament committee is composed of Samuel H. Packer, H. W. Hicks, James Fullerton and Karl de Silva. Games will be play- ed in the Olympic Arena.

Many who desired to participate in the Community Car0l Sing, the last of the three programs, were turned away after Memm·ial Chapel, and the Mounteb-anlrs Thea- tre were filled in spite of the wet weather which prevailed all day. The College and the City were in fine spirit for the annual prograrn which bt·oke all previous attend- ance records. A capacity audience attended the regular Sunday morn- ing chapel service at which the Union College choir and congrega- tion joined in singing the Christ- mas carols and hymns. At the or- gan recital, presented by Dr. Elmer A. Tidmarsh, assi.sted by the choir, many people were standing in the balcony to make up an estimated attendance of 1400. 2300 at Cat•ol Sing Appl'OX!inately 1600 crowded Me- morial chapel for the Community Sing in the evening, 400 assembled in Old Chapel and an additional 300 were in Mountebanks Theatre. For those who could not gain entrance to any building, an ampliefier on the belfry of Memorial Chapel carried the many hundred voices through the campus and the· surrounding neighborhood. Memorial Chapel was appropri- ately decorated for the annual oc- casion with two illuminated tower- ing Christmas trees on the sides of t:he chancel and Christmas trees, interspersed with poinsettas, bank- ing the rear of the chancel. For the first time during the 15 years Union College has celebrated Christmas in this manner on the Sunday preceding the Yuletide re- cess, a trombone choir, under the direction of Professor Charles T. Male, aided Dr. Tidmarsh and the choir with the program. The trom- bone choir played from the belfry of Memorial Chapel after the morn- ing service, and made a tour of the campus in the evening.

The articles that I think are nec- essary for a good day's skiing are, in the order of thei·r importance: boots, bindings, ski~. poles and some sensible clothes. Boots, first in importance because they aid in the con tt·ol of the skis, should fit snugly over two pairs of 100~,( wool socks. A still arch and a box toe are the two e.::;sential fea- tures of a good ski boot. The next most important .point of control is the harness or bind- ing which is fastened securely tc• the ski and is adjusted to fit se- curely to the boot so that when the foot t u.rns so does the ski. There are in general two types of :;kis, flat tops, which are the heav- ier, and ridge tops. It seems to me that the weight is not too impor- tant because one should not IL\t the ski. A pair of skis made of hick- ory will wear longer and will have more elasticity than ash or maple. As far as poles are concerned, any material that won't break off with sharp edges will do. Tonkin cane and bamboo are perhaps most serviceable. Skiing clothes should have a. hard finish so that the snow wi:l not stick and .soak the material.

(/} ISS in Grandfather's Day When your grandfather needed tobacco he probably went to the tobacconist in his community and had a lot of fun blending differ- ent types of tobacco together and trying out the differ- ent mixtures. HE MAY HAVE FINALLY HIT on a combina• tion of tobaccos that was pretty much to his fancy ..• that tasted all right to him and wasn't too strong. So the tobacconist, with an eye to future business, would make up this private blend and keep some of it on hand for him. THIS HIT OR MISS METHOD of tobacco blending was never very satisfactory. But it proved one thing to both smokers and manufacturers, that you must have a blend of tobaccos to get better smoking results, because no one tobacco by itself has all the qualities necessary to a good smoke. THE CHESTERFIELD tobacco buyers select and bid in at the auction sales the tobacco types that best fit the Chesterfield blend, which is the right combination of exactly the right amounts of Maryland, Burley and Bright with just enough Turkish. These tobaccos and the Chesterfield way of blending them make Chester· field different from any other cigarette, THAT IS WHY there are millions of enthusi· astic Chesterfield smokers clear across the country. They find Chesterfield COOLER, BETTER-TAST· lNG and DEFINITELY MILDER • • • just what they want for real smoking pleasure. You can't buy a better cigarette.

Y. ~uppl~mtitt DECEMBER, 19, 1939 Fifteen years ago wheh the new chapel was opened, Union College began to celebrate Christmas in a manner which would express its good will to the surrounding com- mur;Jity that had helped to raise fur~ds with which to build this memorial to Union's World War dead. This annual Christmas Mu- sic Festival has also become a means for the community's re- sponse, for approximately 5,000 attended the worship service in the morning, the music recital in afternoon, and community carol service at night. Other Christmas features at Union included: enter- ta·inment of groups of underpriv- ileged boys from Schenectady Eloys' Clwb at dinner dwring the week by nine frai•ernities, the Union-Skidmore College freshman, and faculty Christmas parties. A significant intercollegiate Christmas event associated with Union's Christmas celebration was the gathering of about 70 foreign students from Bennington, Elmira, R. P. 1 .. Russell Sage, Vassar, Wil- liams, Kent School, and Union, who broadcast their personal Christmas greetings to relatives and friends in their native lands through the facilities of the Gen- eral Electric Company's radio sta- tions WGEA and WGEO.
