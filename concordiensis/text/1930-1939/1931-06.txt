Traditional Customs Honored Members of Senior Class; English Passes Jug By The seniors who are to graduate Monday were in full attendance at one of the most historic features of this week end of. activities, the an-- nual class day exerc;lises that were held l)'riday afternoon under the ancient Nott Elm in. Jackson's Gar- . dens at 2:30 o'clock. Alumni and friends lined the sides of the nat- ural amphitheater as the members of the class of 1931 took p·art in the ceremonies. Ralph H. Fisher opened the pro- gram with the pipe oration, after President Horace H~ger had intro- duced the Speakers. While Fisher was addressing the seniors, the . great pipe, an exact replica of the college library, was passed to all the men as it has been done for many generations. Philip .James ~nglish, of A]bany, keeper of the Jug, then passed the giant vessel so that each member of the class might sample its mysterious con- tents. Prophecy Given James Brown Hume, Jr., deliver- ed the prophecy for the members of his class and he ('lid much to look into. the unknown future and picture his classmates in their var- ious roles,. both serious and humor- ous. Codman Hisiop, class poet, re- ceived considerable commendation for his class ode, 1 jThis Occasional Sorrow.\ The group then witnessed the planting of the traditiop.al ivy by James L.

If you're not a Camel smoker I we ask you to switch to this brand for just one day, then leave them if you can. Thanks to the new Humidor Pack even a rancher on the Great American Desert can now revel in the fragrant luxury of expertly blended choicest Turk· ish and Domestic tobaccos in fresh mild condition. As fast as they come out of the cigarette making machine, Camels now are wrapped in moisture-proof Cellophane and air· sealed. That means they retain their mildness, lresh11ess, and natural moisture until they come to you. It is pepperydustandparcbed- dry tobacco that .are harsh and unkind to a smoker's throat. If you want the proof of that, try Camels in the new Humidor Pack today, and switch hack tomorrow, if you can.
