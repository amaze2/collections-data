Seven of the activities have had their appro- priations reduced, with the Athletic Department taking the bigge,;t cut of all, $2,000.

Cohen SATURDAY, JUNE 9, 1934 A SUCCESSI<'UL POLICY The close of the college year pl·ovides us with opportunity to review the accomplish- ments of the administration under the guid- ance of Dr. Edward Ellery. Union has recog- nized more than ever before that education has changed during the first three and a half decades of the twentieth century. Dr. Ellen· has continually urged that students of th·i~ college be instmcted in present day education-tossing aside antique methods. The chief indicator of that policy has been the \velcoming of the students' own partici- pation in their education to an extent fur- ther than the classroom. Student criticism, if it has accomplished nothing else, has been the stimulus that increased the morale of the entire college. During the past trying vear on administration and faculty everyone I 1 as been literally 'on his toes.' Nor has this \vide-awake spirit been noticeable in the fac- ulty and administration alone; the various ao-encies of the student body have sought 0 every possible improvement for the better- ment of the college. Functionless organiza- tions and positions have been removed. Dr. Dixon Ryan Fox is to carry on the task of directing the affairs of l 1 nion College. We hope that he will recognize the value of stu- dent participation in education and welcome student criticism as Dr. Ellery haR done this year. The class of 1935 consists of capable m~en who are a:!Jie to follow the example of the preceding class. There are several prablems which Dr. Fox must solve. Certain fields of study, nota;bly psychology, are in the need of laboratory facilities. The dormitories are in poor condi- tion. f<'ratel'nities are 'on the gpot' in Amer- ica-it is the duty of Union, 'The .Mother of Greek Letter Fratemities' to come to thei1· salvation on her o\vn campus. Perhaps a changed rushing system would be the answet· to the problem. For the year 1934-35 there is a very nm·row choice of courses of study, with less cha.nce than ever before for special- ization except in engineering and the sciences. We are convinced that Dr. Fox is the man who can do the job ''.:elL It is the duty of faculty students and alumni to back him up in every move he makes. w.>J of the student tax for 1934-35, WiU- the potentialities of a definite sys- !S========;;;;;;====;;!I t ·h e coinmtlni·c\tl' from any college, dear iam A.

GILBERT On certain summer evenings, ac- cording to the Mat·ch 19, 1909 is- sue of The Schenectady Gazette, when the sickle of the moon points upward, the air behind North Col- lege appears thick with a faint in- describably sweet perfume. On such a night if one stand£ on the liltle slope un Lenox Road, back off the campus, one will see the form and figure of the most beautiful woman imaginable standing, with the moon behind her, on the slight raise among the trees. • • • In about 1672 a peculiar and strange character, who had escaped murder two years before, located himself in a Jog cabin just at the bend in the Mohawk below where the present Boston and Maine bridge crosses to Schenectady. Van Verveer, that was the eccentric's name, kept himself apart from his neighbors, who firmly believed him to be an escaped murderer from the Old World. It was, therefore, not strange that when one beautiful spring morning it was discovered that Van Verveer was missing the citizens should rejoice, believing that their strange neighbor had left for good. Their joy, however, was short lived, for late in the summer Van Verveer returned, bringing with him a beau- tiful young girl, his daughter. All of old man Van Verveer's od- dities did not prevent Dorp's young bucks from being overcome with the vision of loveliness. There were two young men in particular who, states the report, \began to pay her marked attention, but the gen- tle display of his IVan's) rifle per- suaded the young men that it would be better to go wooing el~ewhere.\ A ghost story without romance is fooli.oh, and the Van Verveer legend is by no mean~ non-roman- tie. The girl did not hesitate in having secret meetings with a young lad who had fallen madly in love with her. Eccentric persons are by no mean.:; ignorant. Old Van Verveer soon comprehended the situation. One day when the maiden had been gone for· quite awhile the old man took down his rifle from the ca·bin wall and set out to search for his daughter. The girl was soon dis- covered embracing her lover. With an oath Van shot the boy, killing him instantly. \Knowing this would cause trouble the old man hurried with the girl to his hut. gathered a few things togethe1· and started for the river and his boat.\ The deed wa~; soon discovered and the villian and his fair daughter were pur- sued. The capture was not difficult. Van Verveer's boat sprung a leak and he was forced to put ashore where he was captured nearly op- posite the present Hon. A. A. Yate's home. \He was immediately killed. Van's daughter escaped in the ex- citement and rushed on over the level space but was finally captured east of Union College, and close by what is now known as Lenox Road. Here she was killed for having con- spired with her father-as her cap- tors thought--in coaxing the young man to his death.\ It is Van Verveer's beautiful daughter that one sees among the tre~.:; when there is a soft summer stillness in the air. l ant professor of political sci<'nce 16:1 Seniors Get Diplomas assisted by Dr. Egbert K.

Four THE OONCORDIENSIS, SATURDAY, JUNE 9, 1934 Nine and Lacrossemen Encounter Alumni Teams Today ----~--------------~--------------------------~----------------------~--~~------------~ Alumni to Oppose Garnet Nine Today Griswold and Dill Probable Mound Selections; Grad~ Boast Group of Sluggers By WILLIAM E. FERGUSON The annual game between the L'nion varsity baseball team and a team composed of Union College Alumni will be played on Alexan- der Field this afternoon starting at three o'clock. Guy Griswold will be on the mound for the \'~r~ity and either Dill or Sabatini will hurl for the grads. The 1934 nine may not look ex- actly like the one that has appear- ed on the field during the past few games. The battery of Griswold and Stevenson will remain the same. Bush may be at first provided Lefty Clark splits the hurling duty with Griswold. Fiore will be at sec- ond, and the shortstop position is a toss up between Dain, who has been out of the game for the past couple of weeks as a result of a twisted ankle, and Bob Reed who has capably filled Dain's shoes in that post. Dain has looked pretty good m practice this past week and will probably get the nod. Third Base Open ThiFd base is another open posi- tion between Cadwallader and Reed. They bave been on an even par in this week's tryouts and it Is a question as to which one gets the assignment. In the event that Reed plays shortstop, then Dave will be on the hot corner. The out- field will look about the same, as Loomis, Semerad, and Captain Gar- rison will all be at their respec- tive posts in the outer garden. The alumni team will have Bus Dill or Sabatini on the mound and slugging Red Acltley doing the catching. Ryan may fill in for Ack- ley should he need relief. If Saba- tini does the hurling, then Dill will be on first base and should Dill be the starting pitcher, Campbell will cover the initial sack. Second base will be under the care of Fritz Bruhn, and L. Bruhn will be on third. Campbell, when not on first base, will be at the shortstop posi- tion. In the outfield will be seen Girvin, Irwin, and May. May is coming back for his fifteenth re- union and will be seen somewhere in the outfield. In his day he was a slugger and will have to be watched closely by the varsity today. Ackley Is Slugger The king slugger of the Alumni team, of course, is Red Ackley, who graduated last year and had a bad habit of hitting home runs into the bank beyond the outfield. Other hitters of the nine are Dill, the two Bruhns, May, and Irwin. Gray, who can play at either first base, in the catcher's box: or in the outfield, will also be seen on the field. -------0------- Foote Selected For All- American Post Captain Foote to Play With Laci·o-sse Stars; Fraser, Wiliams Receive Mention Most Of This Team Will Play With Alumni Members of the first nine ever coached at Union by Elliot Hatfield, many of whom are expected to see'action in the Alumni-Varsity contest tltis afternoon.

Twelve points are necessary for a letter. Tom Finnegan, '33, captain of last year's .ten and an All-American player was on the field for the alumni in home position. Tom Ald- rich '31, another former star, played the out home post, while Ken Dorn, '32, who played three years for Union, was seen in the first attack place. Freddy Wyatt, '32, coach of the Garnet undefeated frosh team, held down the second attack for the graduates. Plenty of Reserve Harry Redinger, '32, one of the fastest stickmen to ever wear the Garnet uniform opposed Bill Fra- ser at center, completing .the of- fense. Doug Swick, '32 and Horace Hager, '31, at present coach of the Mohawk School ten occupied the first and second defense positions respectively. Ed Engle, '29, and his classmate Tom Kingston, both members of the national champion- ship team of 1929 played the point and coverpoint positions, with Hank Dill, '33, as goalie. The Garnet alumni had plenty of reserve material. Wearing the old grad's colors were Frankie Cinella, '32, Ed Stranahan, '30, Ed Forster, '31, who is coach of the Yale team now, Bill Norris, '32, and Abe Liv- ingston, '31 all of whom play attack. The defense subs were Kike Adams, '32, former captain of the .team, Jim Young, '33, Ernie Ca.~ pelle, '33, Bob Murray, '33 and Phil Langworthy, '32. The spare goalie was Jim Forbes, '31. Netmen Win Two of Their Five Matches Captain-elect Stroebel and Keats Are Outstanding in Disastrous Season An inexperienced tennis team turned in a record of two victories against five defeats in the season just closed. Captain-elect George Stroebel was the outstanding play- er of the squad, being the only man to turn in wins in the majority of his contests. He played fourth sin- gles at the beginning of the season and after a few matches was moved up to the number three spot. CRptl!.in C:Pxy§ler, S<~.m KQa~ and Jack Moffett were the only veter- ans of the 1933 aggregation left for Coacb Bill Aydelotte to work with. Moffett was troubled with a lame hip all season and consequently never reached t<lp form. Sam Keats, playing his third season on the courts for the Garnet, was the only other player besides Stroebel who was at all successful. The season opened with a trip to Haverford and Swarthmore which proved disastrous from Union's point of view. Haverford won four out of five matches from the Gar-- net and Swarthmore took four out of seven fro~ them the following day, April 21. In the first home en- counter for the Union net~nen, Am- herst scored an overwhelming vic- tory by the count of eight to one, on April 27. John Roberts was the one Garnet racquetwielder to turn in a victory. The following day Union had its first taste of victory, defeating Mid- dlebury on the home courts, 5 to 4. The joy of that triumph was dim- med, however, when the netmen journeyed to Williamstown, Mass., for their next match a week later. Williams had no trouble at all in scoring an 8 to 1 victory over Un· ion, Captain Chrysler and Keats scored a victory in the second dou- bles match. On May 18 Union en- tertained Rutgers and again suf- fered overwhelming defeat, 7 to 2. The final match of the season was played with R. P. I. her(! on the following day and resulted'!\ in a 5 to 1 victory for Union.
