Sec~ndly, the purpose of the new club is to create a training ground for future material to build up the Model A.sselll.bly and Model Coun· cil. Under the present set-up, stu· dents have to apply to the faculty adv1sor of the~e delegatwn:; and be chosen on. t•ather vague qualifi· cations. Thus tb.e new club will provide a more equal oppor-tunity and a much .more practical method :for choosing students to represent Union College ar:-uund the wnfer· ence table. It is the tentative plan of ll1e new group to- formally urgamze, elect officers and establish a sim· pie constituti~n. in the near future. An amb1tiow program Is under consideration., one of the most def· inite phases of which is to have round table discussions to aid in the formulation of a policy for use at the coming session of the Model Assenbly at Vassa1· College. The International Relations Club will apply to the Studt:nl Tax Committ.~e .for administrati~·e wn- trol but not lina.ncial aid.

Almost immediately after the publication of the story in bool' form, the nation, north and south alike, acclaimed it. It was only after the Northerners realized that they too were involved in the at- tack Mrs. Stowe waged against the institution of slavery that the southerners began to feel the power of poor Uncle Tom. Then began the world-wide cry for and against the story, a cry which today has merged into almost traditional veneration. D1·.

Two Scholarships Are Established By Alumni Gifts Dr. Suiter and G1'ad.uate ;Coun .. cil Member Give Funds Totalling $8,500 One Gift Anonymous Unnamed Council Member's Gift Augments Cmrncil Funds of $1,700 As a result of two gifts to the college totalling $8,500 or more, there may be open to students next fall two new scholarships--one of $150 a year from the Graduate Council, and another, as yet tent- ative, for a student coming from Herkimer, N. Y. One gift, which the college has not yet received, Dr. Charles Wal- dron anno-unced, is of $6,000 left by Walter Suiter of Herkimer, who died in 1925. The other gift is from a. member of the Graduate Council. The Suiter gift of which the col- lege has just learned can come to Union only if the estate is settled. The Alumni Monthly In its January issue says that \the estate is In the hands of a Trust Company; and while we have nC> accurate jn- formation, we gather there is dis- satisfaction oil the part of at least one of the beneficiaries. Whatever the cause may be, the fact is that the Co-llege has only recently known of this gift and has received none of the money. Dr. Suiter re- ceived the honorary degree of Mas- ter of Arts from Union in 1893.'' Gift of $~,500 Mr. Hoadley explained. that the increasing volume of business of the Bookst01e has resulted in too heavy a load upon Mrs. Jenkins, manager, and that to maintain adequate service for students and faculty a part time assistant was secured. The other gift from an anony- mous member of the Graduate Co-uncil is of $2,500. This augments the $1,700 already contributed to the Council's Gift Fund by alumni. The AluliUli Monthly says \we may put into operation this fall the first of the sBholarships which. the Graduate Council is funding ... The scholarship will pay $150 a yeai\ to begin with, but it is the purp<>se ·of the Council to- incrca.£~e the princi- pal until the endoWlnents will pro- duce $250 a year •.. Assuming an optimistic ()Utlook, thi~ sh()u!d even- tually fund as ma.ny as three scholarships. ln the meantime, all honor to the modest don<>r of this generous gift which places imme- diately in operation so helpful a Council project.'' The scholarships will probably be put into operation for the first timE' next fall, although It .js not as rE>t known what the provisions for their awarding w.ill be, or what classes will be open for them.

Note: If you get a chance see \Show Them No Mer·cy\ at the The policy of new singers is un- successful. Mr. Johnson has un- doubtedly been coerced ·by the Billy Phelps of music, John Erskine, whose Julliard Foundation has filled the coffers of our esteemed Metropolitan. Mr. Erskine, perhaps inspired by America's Billy, has in- sisted that \home-made\ talent be employed. And \home-made\ talent unfortunately, in this case, Is atro- cious. The Julliard graduates grac- ing the Met are inexperienced. Their voices have not matured to their fullest extent. They lack.: sense of drama. And the most evident fact is that their training ha-s been superficial. Their masters at the institution overlooking the Hudson taught them no music, only- voice production. And despite the con- centration upon voice prod1Jction, the results faoil to manifest it. Mr. Huehn is a competent bass-bari- tone.

Basketball Results Cadets Get Strong Competi· tion Frc.m Smoother Union Six; Williams Away Next ous courts in this section of the; country. This change has been; largely due to the acquisition of a' new coach by the visiting team.: They are at the present time coach- ed by ·stevens, formerly of Syracuse University. He has discarded the old game which had been prevalent• in Canada for a number of years and incorporated all of the tactics used by teams in the United States .. In the old style of play the men were primarily basket hangers, One or more of the players would hang near the basket and wait for an opportune moment when he might receive a pass from one of his teammates who were weaving the ball about outside the foul line. They also were accustomed to float on the defense, That is, they would not play man to man or have a zone defense, the two major de-· fense tactics in use in this countr·y, but instead would play the ball and guard any man who happened to be near them at the time. Under the new regime this has all been discarded. Toronto has two outstanding players, Connelly a forward and Marks the tall center man. Both are graduates of Aquinas Institute situated in Rochester where famous basketball teams are a legend. Be- sides these two men the team boasts of a well-rounded squad and accurate baskl!t poppers. They were recently defeated by Niagara by the slim margin of two points. Coach Nelson Nitchman will probably start the combination that functioned so well against Trinity. Milano and Podbielski at the for- ward posts, Waldron and Griswold at guards and lanky Grant Smith at the pivot post. There is a possi- bility that either Priznar or Ken Brown may start in the place of the newcomers to the Garnet squad this year. ---o•--- Swimrning Team Defeated By Trinity Tankmen 53-18 Trinity failed to score again until the closing minutes of the first half after the first string had been removed and the fast-passing subs had taken the floor. Five points were added to the visitors score, .but the hugh lead piled up by Guy Griswold and Captain Milano was neve1· in serious threat of being topped. The blue clad lads were ob- viously having an off night and the long shots which had given them their two .previous victo1 ies were not dropping at all. Close guarding .by the Union team evidentily had much to do with upsetting .the Trinity attack and placing them in Psi Upsilon with a squad of 12 players completely overwhelmed Sigma Phi 19 to 5 as the intramural .basketball campaign continued un- abated. Kappa Nu showed a well rounded team in .their defeat of South College. Every man on the team scored at least >thl·ee points. Chi Psi lost a close one to Delta Phi while the Phi Delts took an-. other one when they stacked up against Kappa Sigma. Vandecar walked away with the scoring hon- ors with a 13 point to0tal. Marshall .of the Chi Psi's comes in second The size of the West Point ice rink falied to distract the attention of the Union hockey team last Sat· urday, but in spi~e of its assiduous concentration upon the work at hand. the contest with the Army was lost 6 to 2. a score totally un- called for and unexpected to the Cadets. Coach Lawrence's fi•·st team. clicking in the best order, easily equalled the play of the SoldiH'~ and but for the lack of experienced substitutes would have made the final score a bit closer. The first the underdog position. Outstanding for the home team throughout the game was Guy Griswold, star hurler on the nine and out for basketball for the first time since his freshman year. Much better on follow up shots than he was in the beginning of the season Gris tallied two of his six baskets by this method in Saturday's con- test. His total of 12 points was high for the evening and brings his season's total to 30 points. Second Team Plays The second half of the game be· came even more of a rout than the opening session. After seven min- utes of the half had been com- pleted the second team went in and finished the game. Led by Bill Brandow with a total of six points, the second team had little trouble with ten points. ·Psi Upsilon G Gain ............. · 0 Jones . . . . . . . . . . . . 0 'Duscherer . . . . . . . . l .Burrell . . . . . . . . . . . 2 Gatchell . . . . . . . . . 0 :Grant . ..... .. . .. . 0 Cadwalder . . . . . . . . 2 Hawks . .. . . ... .. • 1 Stevenson . . . . . . . 0 Hequembourg . . . 0 Baker . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 0 Masterson . . . . . . . . . , . . 0 Total . . . . . . . . . 6 Sigma :Phi Borden ........ .

Williams Next Opponent downs. * * Hugh Brady beca:me so upset at the great nuntber of All-Star teams and All-American teams that were appearing year· after year that he decided to pick some All-Star teams of hi$ own. The idea was to end forever all All-Star team se- lections. Among the teams that he pkked we find All Proper Meas- ures which includes such names as Scales, Ream, Fuller and so on-. Then there's the All Lay It On The Line Team which finds Ruble of Hamilton, Buyse, Rochester and Cash, Boston College with promi· nent positions. The first half was close with Union taking the lead with two quick baskets in the last minute at 19-15. They couldn't keep up their impetus in the second half, and never· did get the ball rolling. They completely lost the location of the hoop, not ~coring once from the field after AI by Halpern had fired in a long set shot as the first half endeci. * * He continues his selections with the All Nice To Have team on which we find Stein of Hobart. Lamb from Amherst College gets on two teams, the All Down on the Farm and All Who's· Zoo. Williams crashes into the limelight with Jay on the All Fine Birds team. Atn- nerst comes thfough again with a Finn, and Tnnity with a Scott on the team tetmed All-Nations. In the All Out or Work lineup Brady has King of Hobart. .. * * And then Brady comes to the All Home team. Clarkson, Haverford and Harvard are represented with Bratt, Childs and Husband. And lo and behold, our own fair Alma Mater is represented by none other than Ladd. Think of it! An All Stal' man. 'The odd collection of teams continues with such as the All Workers, All Colors, All Right and All Wrong. Quite an interest- ing all All-Star teams. * • * Yale is fairly well satisfied at only losing the game and goal posts to Dartmouth. Once when Harvard scored an unexpected vic- tory over the Bulldog, it cost the Elis $10,000 to remove the crimson paint from the buildings on the campus. * * Per·haps we've told you before, anyhow, the flying wedge-which· was a powerful football weapon in the late '90's-was invented by a chess expert in 189-2. L. F. Deland, the inventor, was also a military tactician and a graduate of Har- vard. The wedge was banished in 1905. * * A few items which we may use in judging whether Swarthmore is in our class on the football field. The past year they lost six out of seven games and were de- feated by Hamilton 7 to 0 and .Am- herst 40 to 6. It was Troy's second victory in as many nights, and for Union it was a disappointing beginning of the campaign. Troy's deliberate attack based on accurate set-shooting and under the basket cuts moved well, drawing a great many fouls from the over exuberant fresh. Most of the vital shooting was done by Steve Guter and Zip Gordon, slinky colored center, whose free throw proficiency kept the Trojans in the running during the first half. For several moments at the close of the second period Union looked like a pretty good team. They were moving the ball well, cutting, pivot- ing, and following, but were having trouble in finding the ring. That factor kept them behind while the more experienced Troy team was making the most of fr·equent defen- sive lapses. Despite their second half blowup, this fresh team is not to .be sold shor·t. In Billy Thomas, they have a fast, hard cutting forward, and Bob Controy, the elongated cneter, should be a sensation if he can lose an unpleasant habit of throw· ing passes into the laps of innocent spectators. Halpern, Myers, Am· azon, Miller, and Rathbun all have shown inherent ability, but could stand experience.

Four Stewart Describes German Course Science Students Are Given Useful Course in German He S~ys in Article A development in the teaching of German that is unique to Union College is described by Dr. Morton C. Stewart, associate professor of German, in an article appearing in the December issue of the \Modern Language J.ournel.\ This new course, which was developed with the cooperation of the faculties of the fie!d.:l .of chemi.stly and physics, consists of a four-year study of scientific German. Commenting upon the course, Dr. Stewart said that although most colleges d·evote only a sefnest;}r to scientific German, at Union that subject had been made into a com- plete course so that science stu- dents can use their knowledge of German when they most need it- in the senior year or In graduate school. A part of Dr. Stewart's article follows: \lJntil three years ago Union College rcouired all fresh- man B. S. ~tudents in engineering, chemistry, or physics to elect Ger- man five hours a week, regardless of whether they offered German, French, or Spanish for entrance. As a result there was a large group taking Getman for one year. The course was shaped to fit their need, with a minimum of grammar and a maximum of scientific reading. \Vhcn these £tudents needed their G<:>rman in the research work of the sC'nior year it was discovered that they had forgotten it (along with fteshrnan history, biology, etc.) Therefore a new plan was adopted: the B. S. men were sched- ulc>d fnr a one-hoUI·-a-week course throu~hout the four year~. These cour~es alternate> with their labora- tory wotk and are counted In the same> wav i. e., two hours' class- room rec.itation receives one l10ur of credit. The instructors may, therefore, hold recitation periods up to two hours. \This course is schedled as Ger- man 5 regardless of class-year or entrance .offerings of the students. There are therefore two sections in the freshman and sophomore years: German 5 freshman and sophomore elementary and German 5 frehsman and sophomore Inter- mediate. The latter for students who offer German for entrance. In the junior year theRe two groups are combined, as the ele- mentary students have about caught up as far as scientific Ger- man is concerned. German 5 fresh- man intermediate is a general re- view of grammar and reading of Dietz's 'Lnt1·ouuction to Sci<:>ntific Germ~r.·. In their second year this group con t!ncu3 scie;~tific and tech- nical German, rcadlng \Yallentin's \Grund:u~c <!<:>r Natu!cl:rc\ among other things. The freshman ele· mentary g;rou;-> i3 starteJ on Fiedlc:- and S:mdhnch'~ 'Fir~t Science Cour!'e for German Students,' with emphasis 011 grammar. vocabulary and word-formation. Considerable amplification of the grammatical part of the book has been found ad- visable. After finishing this text in the second semester the class be- gins Wallentin's \Grundzuge der Naturlehrc\ which is continued in the sophomore year and followed by Greenfield's 'Introduction to Chemical German·. This book is continued in the junior year with the combined groups, with add<:>rl readings in physics. In the sopho- more and junior years some of the problems in chemi,;try and physics are given the students thus coordin- ating the work in the two fields. \The worlt in the senior year is conducted as a seminat· in connec- tion with the student's research in their major fields of science. They select such German books and mag- azine articles as they find neces- saty for the work and hand in their bibliographies for Gern:an 5. Their language difficulties are cleared up in conferences and their readings checked for credit in this course.\ ---0----- Biol()g:v Club Meeting The first meeting of the new Biology Club will talre place tonight at 8:0(} o'clock in the Biology Hall. Officers and programs for the fu- ture metings will be decided upon. The program will consist of two short talk.\. Franci~ E.

Enzer Friday, January 17, 1936 ANNUAL RUMPUS In a few more w.eeks the annual rumpus of fraternity initiations will begin. Each year the weary upperclass brother~ sigh with re- lief when Hell Week is over and decla11e that it is harder on them than on the freshmen. But, sure as fate, when February comes around again, upperclass brains are busy de- vising new and more ingenious methods of taking the starch out of the initiates. Hell Weell:, for those who don't know, is a quaint custom of making life as miserable as possible for the pledges and then suddenly reversing the attitude and welcoming them into the brotherhood with all possible sol- emnity. Its supporters are vague and hesi- tant about describing its benefits, but they cling to the custom with tenacity. In spite of the inroads on the Hell Week idea by fra- ternities who have abandoned the horseplay a.nd concentrated their energies on making the formal initiation sincere and impressive, a majority of fraternities p€rsist in devoting a week or so to badgering their freshmen. What are the reasons for Hell Weell:? No doubt there is a deep emotional satisfaction in paddling one's fellow man. There probably is an elemental enjoyment in watching the freshsmen scramble up and down stairs on hands and knees, putting out a fire with mouthfuls of water. And considerable intel- leetua.l effort goes into planning ingenious ways of hanying the pledge-brothers. But to college men who are supposed to have some maturity of judgement, and to fraternity men ostensibly organized to pro- mote and embody certain high ideals, what has Hell Week to contribute? Nothing, Hell Week is the vestige of a more naive age when college boys alternate between long tedious ho-ning on their studies and riotous practical THE CONCORDIENSIS, FRIDAY, JANUARY 17, 1936 ~~~i:t:a~~ich was their only way for letting ll·======:;;;(=Q==l=:;;;U:;;;: _M=··=,N=.·=======..!II··· .• L'-A==.~=~=~;;;,;N=c-~=r-H=·-eSNY=w-,·-~=ER=;•o=!• We believe that the majority of fraternity . .. ·- men today are a little uncomfortabLe and so mew hat ashamed of themselves as they conduct Hell Week.

MANAGEMENT OF ~LE HOfSE South. Colonnade is l'apidly being trans- formed into Hale House. The annex for the kitchen has been built, and plaster is ap- pearing on the \Valls of the dining- room and lounges. Nearly all the outside work has been completed, and the interior finishing and decoration will probably be done on schedule, so that the building will be open for use in the spring. With the Hale House progressing so quickly, it is not too early to begin planning how the dining room and the commons rooms should l>e managed so that students can ob- tain the m<Jst benefit. The dining room will be the chief problem. Food should be reasonably priced and effi- ciently served, and the menus should be planned with care. This requiTes expert knowledge of dietetics and great tactfulness in handling cooks. Also important will be the questi-Qn of the use of the commons rooms, and the conduct of the diners. Some rules will ha..ve to be made and enforced. But they should be as simple and uncomplicated as possible. As for the job of managing Hale House, if some Union alumnus who has h.ad expe- rience in restaurant management and some leadetship ability can be found, the problem will be ,solved. In the absence of such a para- gon, the man who is to take over the duties of house l11Janager should have a genuine in- terest in, and sympathy- f.or, Union Colleg-e.

But in spite of the disappointment to the fresh- men in not finishing the game in one favor or the other, the manner of play of the cubs left no doubt as to their ability. Each team .scored two goals. Joe Paul, one of the outstanding players in the contest, scored first for the frosh after 10 minutes of play had elapsed. His skating and expert passing featured the other- wise slow game. The Lenox School center, Whitney, retaliated shortly afterward following a general melee around goalie, Borden. ' Scott Smith then came to the rescue for the yearlings in the sec- ond ,period with the iPOint that gave the Union team the lead once more. The last score was made by Reese on a fluke. With the Lenox six pressing close around the goal', Borden plopped on the puck and set there for· several seconds, evi- dently waiting for the referee:s whistle. But after 15 seconds went ·by the Union goalie became convinced that the ice was too wet. His rise gave Reese a chance to push the puck into the cage for the tying point.

In this first game on ice, a square puck was used which had been cut down from a hard rubber ball. The original rules as decided by Smith stated that the stick should not be lifted above the knees.

Melius '96, member ot. the ·graduate council, br-ought to a. close a career, act:iv:e in the inter- est of the college, and the Kappa; Alpha Society of which he was a mennbe~ , Mr. Melius was a holder of the congressional medal <lf honor tor braver-y in the Spanis.h-American· War and one of Walter Camp's All- American football selections in· 1893. :He was born in Albany, Feb- ruary 6, 1874, attended! the Al:bany Boy,s Academy and then Union, graduating with an engineering de- gree from the college. He starred on the varsity football team dul'- ing his attendance here. In the early part of the century he was resident engineer of New York state, and in 1921 assumed partnership as con:trador with the firm of Harvey, kbrams and Mel- Ius. His affiliations witlt the Re- publican party in the general as- sell:l;bly of the Connecticut state legislature ·began in 1931 and their success marked by his reappoint- ment. The diversity of his inter- ests reaehed even to horticulture and through hsi efforts the green- house, :which is used ce>nstantly by the biology department, was built in 192{3, His estate in Warren county was one (}f the most obeaut!ful in .Amer- ica. and numerous articles have been written in magazines extoll- Ing- the natural beauty- ot the old estate, \Reverie Farm.\ Presld·ent Fox, in commenting on the death of the Connecticut as- semblyman, said: \'l'he death of Ludlow Melius has bre>ug-ht grief to the whole mem- ber.ship and constituency ;>f Union We have taken continual pride in the distinction which has marked his professional and .public service since his undergraduate days more than 40 years ago, but he has con· stantly deserved and received our gratitude for his lively and intelli- gent concern in every aspect of the college enterprise. \No member of our alumni coun- cil has been more ready or effective In the study of educational prob- lems, none more generous in dis- cerning and meeting various matt-~ rial needs, none more buoyant and devoted in .maintaining the high spirit of the college. \:He seemed born to excellence, whether as a student athlete, an engineer, a public official, a coun- try gentleman, or particularly, as a college alumnus. One of his most American <JUalities-and no other country could have produced him- was his sense of unending member- ship In his college. In this not even death can intervene, for his mem- ory will continue in strong force in the college. ''Besides his other contributions, he lavished care upon the college gardens; the Melius greenhouse and the spacious banks of -woodland sht·ubs transplanted from his Con- necticut estate will be a gracious monument.\ He wa.s a member of the Amer- ican Society of Civil Engineers, the New York ·State Engineers Society and the Historical and Art Society, ancl was trustee of the common- wealth Savings Banlc of New York and the Lutheran hospital of New York.

Four DrCI Fox Describes \State of Union'' Adaptation of AmmJ,anth Meets JJ?ith Difficr.tlties Describes Achievements Since Fall of '34; Schoolcraft, Johnson Also Speak The 97 alumni present at the Mo- hawk Golf Club for a dinner and reception in honor of President Dixon Ryan Fox were given a thorough and illumniating report on the \State of Union\ which de- scr~bed the accomplishments of the College since the fall of 1934 when they convened last Friday evening. Dr. Fox in making thi::; 1 eput t stut- ·ed that all these \achievements were not the product of one man, but rather the flowering of the many seeds of intelligent effort planted for many yean; by Union'::; great teachers. Among the others who addressed the alumni were J. Leslie School- craft, who declared that no other organization in the city br'ought together such a representative group as were present at the din- ner; Dr. Burges Johnson, who en- tertained the faculty with his anec- dotes; and the Hon. Arthur North, world-traveler, who delivered an illustrated travelogue. Fox Describes Changes (Continued from. Page 1) with the chatacter, ·played the role of Fargo with ea,;e and conviction. Cohen, whose mask was w~ll exe- cuted (we regret that Its maker was not credited on the program.), rende!'ed his Iinecl well and made hicl audience feel that he wa~ wrapped in. spectral mists. Unfor- tunately Mi·. Cohen forgot one of the first rules of make-up-be sure to make up your neck and ears. We found it a bit upsetting to find that Amaranth's slrin was not greenish grey 'all the way down,' The minor characters handled their rolecl v1:ith apparent ea:.>e. lf we had not heard the prompter on several occasions we would have mistaken the pauses made by Even- ~ong, the music-ian t Frederick Frostl, and Amaranth to be part of the play. Robert Shreve's Atlas, the steve- dore-painter, William Myer's Ed- ward Figg-, the lawyer, and Carl- ton Ganison's Ipswich, the inven- tor, were convincing characteriza- tions, not vulgar displays of his- trionic,;. Hugh Sharpe's portrayal of Elaine, the writer, however, did not ring ttUe. Perhaps it was be- cause Sharpe's stubble was appar- ent under his make-up, and his dress hung on him like a sheet thr·own over a clothes-horse. We can not help feeling that Foote handled his nw. te!'ial as well a:; he cuuld. 'Ne hope the author will tl'y hi::; hand at a play that will have a wider appPal. Foote has proved that he can overcome the difficult situatinns ari~ing- in the staging of abstractions, as well as having prm·ed that he can mould verse 'into supple speeches. ---,0--·-·- Psycholog-y Club Notice The CONCORDIENSIS, TUESDAY, JANUARY 21~ 1936 Schedule for Garnet Pictures ·.F.

The organization, composed of professionals and students living in the Capital District, has as its active director William Penny Hacker, young conductor and pian- Ist who studies piano under Iturbi a.nd conducting under Hans Lange. The Beethoven Symphony is unique in that it is the only enter- prise of its kind that has been un- dertaken in Albany with adequate support for securing its perman- ency.

But the sudden fury of Sche- nectady's recent blizzard sur- prised the count, so ntuch so that he knew his wife in Eu- t•ope would never believe him if he merely told her about the snow and its effects here. Therefore he has had photo- graphs made of buried cars and piled snow banks so that he can have more documentary evidence. The snowy weathel' also brought Count Sforza the dis- tinction of being initiated a C!'osby Cougar, a distinction which at Rochester University corresponds to \dormdwelle1·\ at Union. While visiting that school, he stayed in the dozmi- tory, and returning to his room one night, he found his books and papers covered with snow. \And thus,\ as the Rochester Campus related it, \the Count duly became a member of the Crosby Cougars and learned the first rule of the pack: Keep your window closed dut•ing snowball weather! !\ Asks For Justice As Goal of Church : Dictatorships Are Destroyers of MeR, Says Count Sforza Make~ First Address of Two Week Visit; Factional Dispute After Speech Carnegie Peace Speaker Declares War Responsible Fo1· Decadence of Parliaments Through Loss of Men \The fact that we have at pres- ent so many dictatorships\ declared Count Carlo Sforza, in the first of his two Spencer Lectures in Memo- rial Chapel Tuesday night, \is no proof of the success of dictator- ships.

So aroused did several members of two different Italian factions become after the lectur•e by the Italian count that they engaged in a heated argument on the vir- tues of both sides of the dictator question. \How is it possible that so many people take the decadence of par- liaments as the decadence O·f de- mocracy?\ Count Sforza asked, then answer·ed in his own words. \We lost in the war many of our intellectual best, whose absence in .the ranks of our parliaments Is keenly felt.

The heads of the geolo~w and economics departments off.ered to resig-n after they had sig11ed the oath with reservations \vhich were not acceptable to the state authorities. Tufts President, Dr. John. A Couzens said there was no com·se for the coll.ege except the acceptance of the resignations, since re- fusal to comply would 1nean the loss of the college's character. We question the expediency of the two professors' action. If we wel'e in their po·si- tions we would probably comply, sign the oath, and continue teachil1g as we pleased until the patriotic inquisition found us out. The odds are that nothing would happen. Fo1·mal compliance is sufficient to pacify the majority of the 100 percenters for whose votes the bill was framed and passed. On the other hand, we pel'versely admire the spunk of the men who can stick to a point when it costs them their jobs. Sueh admiration is against all nason. Chivalry i..<; out of date, and sacrifice fDr a technical point of honor seems to be comp()unded of obstin- acy and anachronism. But we admire them just the same.

These instances of vandalism are current, some discovered by the staff, others pointed out by ill- censed students. Last year a copy of \The National Geographic Mag- azine\ was placed on our Round Table as part of an exhibit appro- priate for March 17th. One Mon- day morning we were provoked to find that the very fine colored plates of the Irish country side had been ripped out of the article on display. It would be a satisfaction to catch a culprit, but his punishment would not cure the disordered thinking which induces a student to help himself to what belongs to all. If his native sense of fairness does not aid him, perhaps the non- approval of his comrades may help a man to keep his hands off com- munity property. These paragraphs are inspired by the remark, \Someone ought to write about it!\ Our \individualists\ are getting away with our possessions, but not without our knowledge of, and dis- dain for, the offence. Dr. Coffin; Dear Sir: In reading Wednesday morning's \Gazette.\ I ran across your article which states you are emphatically against the so called \soldiers' bonus.\ Don't you think you put 'it 'rather strongly when you say it is a \no- torious .swindle\? A man in your position could well say and get away with that. You are earning good money and probably have been, and have no kick coming, but do you know the sacrifice and hardship of other in- dividuals? Respectfully, C. G. FEULNER, Scotia, N.

N. Berh- man's \Biography.\ It is not our purpose hete to criticize the play, for its success in the movies and on Broadway has already established it as a good popular play. We shall merely try to make a few succinct remarks and let it go at that. Mrs. Sayles as Marion Froud, artist and woman of affairs, was the very backbone of the produc- tion. Whether speaking or listen- ing she was M:arion Froud every second of the time she was on stage. She backed up speeches, and leveled off tempo with a smoothness rarely found in an amateur production. Without fear of embarrassing Miss Harding or Mrs. Sayles we can safely say that the latter's Marion far surpassed Miss H's movie version. We did feel that Marion could have been made more convincing had she been a touch ·more arty; but that is more a matter of personal taste than common opinion. Miss Edith Alex:anderson's Slade was well drawn in the short bit which she had but a wee bit too coy and athletic. W. Elwood Mc- Allister fitted 'Timpie Wilson al- most too well. - Mr. Rich, a newcomer to the Civic Players, is a real find. He has one of the finest stage voices we have ever heard. As yet his acting lacks the force and vitality and direction which are so essen- tial, yet despite this lack his Rich- ard Kurt was not a bad one, wealt perhaps, yet h.ardly destitute of feeling, Our ·biggest disappointment came from 'Bunny' Nolan as played b:5' Mr. Arthur Sherburne. Perhaps it was because he conceived Bunny as an essentially pathetic character and not the pompous bluffer whotn we had imagined, At any rate his characterization \Vas weak and in- effectual until the last act. Mr Norris as Orin was aiso a littl~ wealt, for we had the feiJling that he could have built up the part a little more. Despite Mrs. Sayles efforts the tempo was erratic and slow the best act being the last. Th~ set left much to be desired but the effec~ was heightened by good !ightmg. The production was not as good as the Civic Players' best, not as bad as its worst. -T. S.

In these practices as well as in the Lenox School contest the year- lings have shown real skating abil- Ity and several of the men have stood out in particular. Joe P'aul at center is a. fast skater, expoert passer, and dependable goal shoot- er. He scored one of the goals in the first game and was the fastest man on the ice. Scott Smith at one wing post and goalie Borden are two more men 1.vho have shown a great deal o-f promise. Smith sc<n'ed the secon.d Union goal in the Lenox game, while Borden made sor:ne ex- cellent saves. Other probable starters for the frosh will be Carl Coleman, p<aldng up with Smith at wing, and. Van- derbilt and Herb Fox as tbe de- fense co-mb1nation. Nothing very much is lmown about Coach Watters' boy-s, al- though they always 'have a. good skating team, but whether or not they are a match for the yearlings r•emalns to be seen.

Con- querors of N. Y. U., Columbia, Cornell, and all other opposition this season, the Maroon squad is rated as one of the strongest in the east, second only to Yale Univer- sity.

Ed Blacltledge, sophomore breast stroke ace, also lowered the uni- versity recovd in his favorite 200 yard event to 2.44. Clayt Nichols, not to be outdone, broke a record by taking the 440 yard free style event in the fast time of 5 minutes and 26.9 seconds.

It was not until the 16th century that skis about three feet in length were used with the im- provement of having a built in shoe affixed to the ski itself. The North American continent was familiarized with skis in the early eighteenth century. Only about one ski devotee in ten goes in for jumping. The longest jump on record at the present time is that made by Birger Rund in 1934 when he jumped 301.76 feet. This is a world record mark and was made in Jugoslavia.

Four THE CONGORDIENSIS, FRIDAY, JANUARY 24, 1936 Unlimited Absences Allcwed at Amherst Debaters Lose to Williams; Prepare for Future Events PAYMENT OF FEES Second Half Year 1984-35 Bills for the second half of the Faculty Adopts New System, But Mal\es List of Restrictions Amherst undergraduates will be given unlimited cuts 1n the future under the new policy of the Am- herst Administration. Commenting on the new system, C. Scott Porter, Dean of the College, said the inten- tion is to emphasize attendance of classes rather than to allow more cutting. The new system will be only an experiment and can be re- voked if unsuccessful. A careful check of the number of cuts taken by any Individual will be made so that warning can be given to those taking too large a number of bolts. The new rules are the result of a report on the cut situation made by a. faculty committee appointed last fall. The report of a student com- mittee, appointed at the same time. was rejected in favor of the more drastic suggestions of the faculty committee. The faculty report traces the his- tory of absence rules at Amherst since 1881, showing the lack of change for fifty years. The present absence regulations allow five bolts in a three hour course per semester, with corresponding numbers in one, two, of four hour courses. An unex- cused absence in excess of the al- lowance results in the offender be- ing reported to the Dean, and fur- ther complications. The report of the f:tculty commit- tee explained concerning the change in rules: \\Ve feel that in the past emphasis has been placed on ab- sence rather than on attendance. ·we are proposing the following r£>g- ulations with the hope that the stu- dents ,,.ill be more interested in at- tending classes than in cutting them.\ The Philomathean Society held a practice debate at their meeting Monday in the Old Chapel on a subject that will come into .topmost prominence this year: \Resolved. that Roosevelt should be re-elected President of the United States.\ It was advocated by Norman Stewart '37, and William Leonard '36, and opposed by Charles Honickle '38, and Richard Snyder '37. The Philomathean Society will a·lso debate the same subject on February 7 before one of the social clubs of Utica against the debaters of Hamilton College. Also on February 7, but here in Memorial Chapel, there will be an informal platform defate on the subject, \Resolved that college stu- dents should be required to partic- ipate in extra-curricular activities,\ l. requirement that has been adopt- ed at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

Glee Club Season To Open Saturday To Sing at Hudson Falls In First of Eleven Concerts The Union Glee Club will open its 1936 season Saturday night with a concert at the Hudson Falls High School under the auspices of the Civic League, Student Manager .James Kimball announced today. The concert will be the first in a series of 11 already scheduled. The full complement of 30 men will ap- pear, dil·ected by their conductor, Dr. Elmer A. Tidmarsh. The club's repertory for the Hud- son Falls concert contains a varied selection of vocal music. Negro :>pirituals and Bohemian and Corn- ish folk-songs head the list, in addi- t() secular and more classical music and college songs. Campbell to Speak Tonight On Status of Constitution Dr. Douglas W. Campbell, assist- ant professor of government, will be the principle speaker at a d,is- cussion -after a dinner given in his honor by the Layman's League of the Unitarian Church at &:3(} p. m. tonight. His topic will concern the Constitution and -its contemporary effect upon political and economic progress. Recent Supreme Court decisions having forced the Constitution into the foreground of political con- troversy, there is little doubt preva- lent that it will play a major part in the forthcoming presidential campaign. Dr. Campbell will ex:· plain. the problems and controver- sies which confront the .American peop-le today, regarding the pl'es- 'ent interpretations of the Consti- tution. Dr. Campbell came to Union aft- er several years' experience as stu- dent and colleague of Professor Corwin of Princeton University, one of the outstanding authorities in the country on constitutional inter· pretation. Prior to his Princeton experience, Dr. Campbell spent a number of years in Asia and Eu- rope, and is thoroughly familiar with the important governments of those :regions. IllusionS' of Benefits of Colonization Being Dis:pelled, Says Count Sfor2a Famou.s Former Foreign Minister of Italy Delivers His Second Spencer Lecture Within Week Spencer Lecturer COUNT SFORZA Fox To Give Beta Kappa Four Phi Addresses Among the invitations to speak which President Dixon Ryan Fox has accepted are those asking him to deliver the annual Phi Beta Kappa addresses at Colgate Uni- versity, Dartmouth College, Tufts College and Williams College. This year Dr. Fox has already delivered a Phi Beta Kappa address at Erie, Pa. Last year he performed the same service at Bard College and at Syracuse University. Dr. Fox has also aecepted the invitation to deliver the third an- nual Pen1·ose Memorial Address before the American Philosophical Society, in Philadelphia on April 24. The first address was delivered by an •eminent biologist, Ed wr.r'd Grant Conklin, Nobel prize winner, on a subject dealing wit\1. evolution. Last year the Internationally known. physicist, William Francis Gray Swann spoke. Dr. Fox, as a historian has been asked to discuss whether or not the present political situation in America has developed naturally from our own native cir- cumstances, or whether the current political scene ha.s been affected by European Influences.

The address of the former foreign Italian minister, who has been traveling and lectur- ing under the auspices of the Car· negie Endowment for the Advance- ment of International Peace, was the last public one he will make at Union. The loss of Western prestige in the east due to the effects of the World War have made all col<Jnial empires ineffectual and insecure, said Count Sforza. Cites Japan According to him, Japan in a. few decades will probably lose all p-ro- visional military advanta.ges she has acquired now. And his exten- sion of such similar examples Il- lustrated still further his main point that \the colonial illusion\ of the world is becoming more and more apparent. \Throughout all Asia and Africa the local dynasties are losing fo-rce and prestige,\ declared Count Sforza. \Why? Because fm·ce and prestige were the means and in- struments of all dominations; and the native peoples have resisted better, withdi'awing all affection and all loya.lty from their kings and emperors, who have accepted out of corruption or fear to be- come slaves and toys io. our hands.\ The famous Italian dipl<>ma.t stated that \recently the Rotna.n Church has been giving a. demon- stration of the graVity ()f the sit- uation.

Enzer Tuesday, January 28, 1936 LIABILITY INTO ASSET The announcement of plans for the com- plete renovation of the first floor of Silli- man Hall will be welcomed by the whole college. Students who wish to study be- tween classes will be able to do so in beauti- ful and comfortable surroundings. The fur- niture and decoration of the study-lounges show a quiet good taste which would be a cr.edit tC> any college. The ingenious arraTige- ment of sofas, chairs, and study tables will make possible the comfortable accommoda- tion of twice as many students as formerly. These features promise to make Silliman Hall an asset to the college instead of a lia- bility. In the past, Silliman Hall has always been shown to visitors with an apology. It has been used for all sorts of miscellaneous purposes; club meetings, jazz band rehear- sals, graduate council luncheons, photog- rapher's sittings, in addition to its ordinary every~ay use as a meeting place for non- fraternity men and commuters where they can study and converse between classes. There is a definite need for some place on the campus where men who do not have classes at the time, can \hang out.' The li- brary does not fill that need ; as a \hang out\ it has its disadvantages. The librarians have a prejudice against conversation on the premises. Hale House will have a student lounge intended for social gatherings and leisure reading, but not for study. Silliman Hall should occupy the place midway between the library and Hale House as far as the na- ture of its use is concerned. The new Silli- man Hall will be an ideal place for that com- bination of study and conversation which so annoys the librarians. It will be the place for studying which is too serious for Hale House and not serious enough for the library. In addition to its practical benefits, the new Silliman Hall will be gratifying to all Union men; and, we feel certain, that it will be a source of pride to the alumni who.se gen-. erosity made possible the reno;vation. NEUTRALITY During the United. States' 160 years as an independent nation, there have been two wars i11volving the majority of the nations of the world, the war following Napoleon's conquests, and the World War. The United States wC::ts drawn into both of them in spite of om· distance from the original conflid and our apparent self-sufficiency. The problem which is guiding the framers of American foreign policy is to keep from becoming embroi1ed in another World War. This is not a new problem. It has been a g·uiding pl'inciple for the United States since Was·hington'~ time, but the methods used in the past failed in achieving th.eir purpose. It is interesting to look back and see what were the policies the federal government adopted when .each of these great wa1·s was threatened and which did not succeed in maintaining our neutrality. Before 1812, \neutrality legislation\ was passed by Congress. Dul'ing the years 1914 to 1917, there were countless executive pronouncements declar- ing neutrality to be our policy, and strenu~us effo-rts on the part of individuals and organ- izations interested in keeping peace. Neither the legislation of 1812, nor t:he propaganda of 1914 prevented our going to war. Yet these same methods are being pm- sued today in the belief that they will do the trick. \Neutrality legislation\ strikingly similar to that of 125 years ago is now be- fore Congress and finds supporters in bo-th parties. And propaganda for peace is flood- ing the country as the indications pile up- that another World War is imminent. America should stay out of foreign wus by staying out of foreign wars. Pas.sing- a law beforehand will not prevent a formal declaration o·f war as provided in the Con- [ SECRET SERVICE t The announcement of the new intramural skiing competition to be held as part of the new deal in such sport was received with no Jittle perturbation by the jolly Chi Psis, because it is teared that the Association may chose the Chi Psi Hill as the ideal spot for the sla- lom race ... and what would the cute little wat·ds do? * * * t The new policy of athletics con- trolled by the administration evi- dently took a great weight off P'ro- .fessor Wittner's mind-to quote: he will \no longer be subject to ·the whims and fancies of the Stu- dent Tax Committee ...

Verdi apparently has written. the same kind of music in the string quartet that dominates his operas. Tosca- nini is reported to treasure Verdi's music. Yet, even though I am will- ing to worship at the. Toscanini sb.rine, I cannot see the alleged greatness which ihe maestro finds in his compatriot's work. But then, I am only a philand.ering pen· pusher and not graced by the sp·irits to find the intricate splen- d()rs behind the sco,re ·until they are placed before me l>y someone else. In this ca.se even the maestro's soaring over the music ha.s failed. Antoni Malczewski, translated from the Polish by Arthur Prudden Cole- man and Marion Moore Coleman, The Electric City Press, Schenec- tady, 75 pp. Antoni Malczewski wrote Ma.rya, the Polish masterpiece of narra- tive poetry. in 1825. One hundred and ten years after, this poem has become available in a translation by Arthur and 111arion Coleman, a translation which, if lacking in mechanical perfection, yet retains all of the sensation of fire and un- rest incumbent in the original. 'The other items were projected with the uniqueness characterizing all Toscanini readings. \Marya\ may be described a.s a removal of Byronic romanticism to the turbulent. Tartar-ravaged steppes of Ukraine. The plot, ex- tremely simple, furnishes a solid I background for tremendous clashes II II of wills, emotions, and steel blades. Now Showing Vaclaw, .son of Pan Voivod, a Po- lish noble, marries, against pater- !!=============-!! nal desires, Marya, daughter of a grizzled and battle-worn leader, called only the Sword Bearer. The revolt of Vac.law is apparently for- given by his father, who with hon- eyed words, sends the young knight to meet his bride, and then, to prove his mettle, to combat the Tartars who ravaged the Ukraine. Joy and forboding vie in the heart of lovely Marya when she meets her love, but learns his fllr- ther mission. Shall Vaclaw stay with his bride, and find sens\lal happiness, or shall he ride away in the desperate quest of glory? Renown wins, and, joining uis forces, leaving :Marya in the care of an old retainer, and with those of the Swoz·d Beare!', Vaclaw combs the steppes in search of Tartar bands. Two Byronic cantos suffice .for the telling of this tale. Malczewski employed his material with great effectiveness, successfully convey- ing the emptiness of the glory gained and the utter desolateness which was the aftermath of Pyr- rhic victory. The translation en- dows the battle sequences with a verve and fire which offer recom- pense for the .absurd romanticism of the overwhelming odds against the Polish and the movie-like \to the rescue\ of the Sword Bearer. The translators have overcome gl'eat difficulties in rendering some passages particularly native to Po- land in E11glish, and the slight woodenness of the verse in such se- quences is not a fault. In other, more universal passages, the Cole- mans have performed flawlessly, and even imparted a touch which few translators attain-the instil· ling in the reader of a sensation that he is reading the original, en· joying the undercprrents of Polish music running throu_gh the action,. by some rnlt•acle made audible to hi~ .A.ngiO>-Saxon. ealo'.s.

The reason that I am harking back is to present a point of view and some comments thereupon. The article embodying the following statements appeared In T-he New York Times for Janu- ary nineteenth. It was written by Howard S. C\lllman, director of the Roxy Theatre, and delivered a.s an addt·es.s at New Yovk University.

Four Fox Warns Against Texts Inquisition Suggests That School Boards Ask Advice in Deciding Legality of Texts Warning that \There is sweeping through the country another ing_ui- siijon directed against textbooks in history and other social studies similar to that which Mayor Thompson, Mayor Hylan, certain newspaper's and others led a dozen years ago,\ Dr. Dixon Ryan :E<'ox, as President of the New York State Historical Association, writing for New York History, a quarterly journal, makes a plea to its mem- bers to persuade school boards in their towns \rather than to trust their own knowledge of histOJ-y, American or European, to ask the American Historical Association to appoint a committee to consider and advise upon passages con1- plained of in the given book.\ Dr. Fox made this plea in the leading editorial entitled, \A New Bed Scare,\ which appears in the current issue of New York History, the journal of the New York State Historical Association. He bases his appeal on the fact that just as we turn to a jury of physicians to determine matters of medicine at issue and to laWYers if a matter of law, we should turn matters of his- tory to historians.

Mountebanks.· Tickets Students may make advance reservations for \Charles the Second\ and \Masterpiece\ which the Mountebanks will present this week-end, by mak- ing application at the News Bureau office in Silliman Hall, Thursday and Fziday after- noons, 1:30 to 5. Fraternities wishing group reservations must submit the names of the students for whom tickets are required. Thet.r resear'ches on four weak acids in the Union chemical ·lab0ra- tories reveal that the energy of activation 1s the same when each of these acids is used. This points ' to the fact that the mechanism in- volved in setting is probably inde- pendent of the acid. The paper by Dr. Hurd is one· ,f a series on silicic acid gels hE has been publishing in the J·ournal of Physical Chemistry on his stud- ies of the subject. A more compre- hensive knowledge of the mechan- ism of the setting of these gels will undoubtedly 1 esult in its applica- tion both in chemistry and biology. Because such structures as the eye and other cal'tilaginous struc- tures of the body are made up of gels, the information secured from the studies on silicic acid gels should lead to much more accurate knowledge of these organs in the human body, Three Faculty Publish Book Members Reviews Three Union College faculty members, Dr. Harold A.

Dean Friday, January 31, 1936 ABOLISH HELL WEEK Slowly, but .steadily, fratemities at Union College are doing· .away with Hell Week cus- toms. A few of the chapter houses on the campus have entieely abolished the practice. Most of the others are trying to reduce the number of days of \Hell's\ duration, and softening the ld nd of \Hell\ which they ad- minister to th.e neophytes. The houses with the \stiffest\ Hell Week programs are generally looked upon with dis- favor. It is not a very convincing- boast to say, «We have the hardest Hell Week on the ~mpus.\ Ask the average fraternity man, \Does your house have a Hell Week?\ and the an- swer is usually in an apologetic tone; \Yes but our's last&. only three days,\ or: \We still have it, but it's g:oing to be a lot easier this year.\ All these things are straws w\1.ich give no doubt which way the wind is blowing. The attitude toward Hell Week is definitely changing. Fraternity leaders are openly wondering just what use there is in contin- uing the custom. Sophomores are beginning- to see that Hell Week means for them a lot of hard work which makes them feel slightly foolish. Fres·l!rnen are steeling themselves to go through the annual rumpus with credit to themselves and yet to maintain an appear- ance of respect for their upperclass \brothers.\ The fratel:\lli ties are clinging- to an out- worn custom b€eause it is a \tradition or be<!ause it is too much effort to change. And the half-hearted, watered-down Hell Week practices are as p-itiful as the \good old\ Hell Weeks were disgusting.

The appeal is to the eye first, and the sound of the words is a ·Secondal'Y considera- tion. The emphasis has reaeheci its extreme point in the work of literary radicals like e. e. cummings who use startling typograph- ical arrangements to achieve their effects. A poem about a Christmas tree, f{)r instance, would be set up in the shape of a Christmas tree. This trick is not brand new, by any means, for Lewis Carrol used the same de- vice in the rat's tale in \Alice in Wonder- land.\ Some poets, however, insist that poems should be heard and not seen. Jo:hn Mase- field, in the preface to his collocted works, laments the decline of spoken verse. He also states that his own poetry is written for the ear and not the eye, althougl:l. .some of his poems do not stand the test of reading aloud. In Vachel Lindsay we have a poet who sticks to his creed and does e~ctly what he sets out to do. His verse is meant to be read aloud, to be sung, chanted, dramatized. The full effect of his poems cannot be felt by a silent reading. When Dr. Burges Johnson read Vachel Lindsay's poem \The Congo\ in assembly yesterday, the attentive faces of his hearers showed clearly how dramatic and effective spoken poetry can be. This in spite of the fact that Dr. Johnson declaimed \The Congo\ without the tom-tom accompa.ni.ment which the author would have used. Weeks Best Editorial YARDSTICKS OF KNOWLEDGE Notes on Our Contemporaries \All we know is what we read in the papers,\ said a professor re- cently in the vein of the late Will Rogers but referring this time to the reading of examinations. Al- though the remark was used this time in more or less of a humor- ous vein, it is a good illustration of the faults of the exam system as it is used today In American Prize :Professor colleges. It must be admitted at the out- set that the written examination is the most practical approach yet known to the problem of grading students according to their rela- tive knowledge. Especially is this true in a large class where other methods of determining the amount of knowledge the student has gained are nearly useless. However, the fact still remains that it is next to impossible to pick out eight, ten, or even fif- teen questions from a fifteen weeks' course of study which will hit every student alike, nor is the length of time or• the conditions under which the examinations are held favorable to the fair testing of one's accomplishments. This problem, which must be coped with to the grP.atest extent in large ·classes, might be partly solved (and this is already being done in some instances) by malting the final examination questions of such a nature as to try the stu- dent's ability to think logically on relatively simple but unusual prob- lems rather than having him throw back in the examination the mere facts and figures to which he has been exposed during the progress of the course. However, there are still those who think slowly, but nevertheless accurately, and who are thus outlawed by this type of questioning. The result of this state of af- fairs is that college grades do not reflect accurately the intellectual advancement of students as they should and as they are often ex- pected to do. Considering the problem in a larger sense, we realize that, in· genei'al, the wrong attitude is being taken toward the examination sys- Alexis Carrell, Nobel prize win- ner, wilr teach at uhe University of California during the spring semester. .. * ~ What!

Secret agreements? Now Showing Another obscurity to fame saved from drink stor:y has reared its ugly head at Proctor's this time with Bette Davis, Franchot Tone, Alison Skipworth and Margaret Lindsay. The story is old and shopworn with little or no new material added. Bette Davis how- ever extracts the last drop of dra- ma from it as Joan Trent (or some name simi·lar to it) the tempestu- ous actress what took to drink on account of she thought she was a jinx. Bearing in mind her magnifi- cent performance in \Of Human Bondage\ we believe that in Dan- gerous (a helluva title) she does the same fine work even though the stories are not equally matched. We should like very much to see Miss Davis do Mary in \Children's Hour\ or Julie in \Liliom.'' Mr•. Tone worries us. From an eager youth who injected a cer~ tain amount of spontaneity he has graduated to the ocold, impassion- ate lip-biting smoothly of today The change is decidedly for the W()rse. The change has given his acting a curious repressed and re- strained quality not conducive lo a comfortable feeling. Miss Skipworth and Miss Lind- say do all they can with what they have but that is pitifully meager. The man who plays Miss Davis' husband deserves attention for the way he made his wistful unreal charactet· almost believable. Warner's sp!'ead themselves on the settings. The dialogue was bril- liant but spotty and erratic Miss Davis being th.e most fortunate in that respect.

God may be thanked for giving the boys and girls a big oppor'tui:J.ity but we'd like to ask Him what's going to be- come of them aU. Having poetry read in ass-embly was are- freshing experience. It should be done more often. We suspect that few people have the nerve to read poetry aloud before 800 college students. The last time we :remember en- tertaining the muse in assembly was in our freshman year with Mr. Ma.x Waing.er offi- ciating. the facts.

Coach Hatfield's club, which did not play up to its real ability until the last half of the game with Mont Pleas- ant, hopes to continue where it left off last week, and even the score with the local teams. Whether the fresh can transcend the cramped condition of the Terrace \cigar box.\ and show the continuity of at- tack displayed on their home floor is the chief problem. Union's of- fense, based predominantly on in- dividual effort and continued set shooting, will find that the minia- ture gym will hamper it no little.

Earle Extols Academic Freedom College Newspapers Can Be Iil.struments to Combat Suppression At the annual fall convention of the Intercollegiate Newspaper As- sociation of the Middle Atlantic States, held recently at the Uni- versity of Pittsburgh, Gov. George H. Earle of Pennsylvania char·ged tile college newspapers with the duty of maintaining academic freedom. Gov. Earle said in part: \Th;e American system of gov- ernment has nothing to fear from full and open discussion of other systems. It does have occasion to fear, however, when such discus- sion is suppressed, because sub- versive doctrines thrive on sup- pression where they cannot exist in t.he light of day. It is an encourag· ing sign that editorial ft·eedom has survived even to the extent we oow find it, in view of the forces at work to destroy it American journa.lism deserves eternal credit ;for the manner In which it has re- sisted the drive of business groups for 'colored' news and for sup- pression or distortion of unpleas- 2Ilt facts. \We all know that institutions of learning ca.n subdue or completely muffle a.ny opinions of its instruc- tors by holding over their heads the threat of dismissal, or on oc- CaBion by exercising their right to dismiss teachers who express unconventional thoughts. There can be no real education, though. v.rlthout full discussion of all ques- tions, unhampered by restrictions a.nd taboos. We cannot fashion ed- ucation pills and give them to stu- dents. We can attempt to suppress facts or theories which may not please wealthy contributions to our institution of learning. \As soon as we follow such a pol- icy our schools cease to be avenues of thought and become instead in- struments of propaganda. The col· lege journals of the country can, therefore, perform a great public service by standing firm as the de- fenders of academic freedom.\ -o-- lJnion Stands Well In Psychology Examination (Con:tlnued from Page 1) seven students who took the test scored below one hundred a.nd five and only thirty-one out of two hundred thirty-seven scored below one hundred fifty-five.
