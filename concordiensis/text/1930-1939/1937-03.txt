Union, well Union nev.er· seemed to know just who to pratse for her existence, and now over one weekend we find ourselves blessed \Vith one of the greats of American history, a figm·e who assisted Washington in chang- ing the destiny of thirteen English colonies. And this great gentleman we can now call our own. General Philip Schuyler has become the object of our scrutiny as one who was influential in the founding of our college. His memory was feted at the behest of Dr. Fox in order to bring to the minds of all in- terested in Union's history an intimacy with her past. To Dr. Fox, who was reS!)Onsible for this convocation and to whom the credit must go for its completion. we owe a g:estm·e of ap- preciation as well as to Drs. Larrabee and Waldron and J\Iessrs. Hislop and Enzer fo1 their work in its execution. The name of Schuyler they have succeeded intimately to associate with Union, in fact so intimate that in the dark days of the past somebody made a grave mistake in not link- ing the fate of our college with his illustl'ious name. In a desperate effort to remedy this terrible mistake we of The Concordiensis are undertaking to open a contest for the best song on Philip Schuyler. The rules of this contest are printed in another portion of this paper, and in the interest of the college a great many persons should want to make some sort of contribution .. The prize we offer is not lal'ge, but the pl'inciple of it should offer enough incentive to those who have ability along these lines to make an attempt 1:tt writing a song.

The THE PLACEMENT BllREAU :r\o longei' can the1·e be any doubt as to thP \'alue of the service rendere>d by the Col- leg·e Placement Bureau to students and grad- uates. Since its conception little over a year ago, the Bureau, under the direction of Mr. Fred Wyatt, has shown remarkable results in its efforts to find suita:bl€ and satisfac- tory employment for seniors after gradu- ation. The fact that over ninety-five percent of the class of 1936 is now placed may be attributed in large part to its work. The problem of employme11t is a serious and bewildering one to the graduating stu- dent. The Placement Bureau by collecting and preparing for ready use information about each senior< his abilities and his pref- erences, has immensely simplified this prob- lem. In addition it has an·anged a series of interviews throughout the year between per- sonnel directors representing a cross-section of all industrJ and students seekinu· posi- • b twns. This series has enabled the students to find out what they want and what em- ployei's want, in no haphazard manner. There was a time, not lo11g- ago, when the service of the College Employment Bureau to the student ended with his graduation. The creation of the Placement Bureau as a part of college administratio-n was a great step forward and its achievements are to be commended and encouraged. And at Other Colleges •..

And when Tuesday evening rolled around all the faculty sat down and phoned for taxis. Then they waited. It got to be 11 :45 and not a taxi showed up. Dr. Danton was very angry, wrote letters of corn- plaint t() all the taxi companies. He sent them collect. Then he walked over to the Ad. Bldg. When he got there he found eleven taxis lined up in front. Dean Ellery had called up all the taxis in town and was riding around the campus in them. one after the other.

Coach Nelsiln Hampered I,ack of Material; 4 Varsity Men Basketball Team Preps For Game \\'Vith R. P. I. With but one more varsity bas- ketball game left on the schedule, interest IS already shifting to base- ball and all eady at this early date, Coach Duke Nelson is working his battery candidates daily in the gymnasium. As soon a:; he can ac- quire the gym floor for the entire afternoon, which will probably be next week, Nelson will issue the call for outfielders and infielders, and then nets wil be strung up and the work .begun In earnest. For his first season as baseball coach, Nelson is Pxpected to be hampered no little by the severe l(]ss through graduation of an al- most complete varsity nine, Erni<:> Brown, Harry Marra, Lloyd Waters and Phil Duchscherer being the only holdovers. On to-p of this, the schedule lists thirteen games, three more than last year, and bids to be one of the toughest ever carded. The greatest gap to fill will be the pitching post vacated by Guy Gt is- wold, sin.ce only Lloyd Waters is left from last year's pitching staff, and he at present is ineligible for away games. Colby Jones, fresh- man twirler of last year's tea.m, seems to be the next best bet, but he too is ineligible except for home contests. The other twirle·rs now tossing them down in the gym in- clude Ward, Zweig, Sands, Stewart, Lubansky, Amazon, Haskell and Robbins. Catcher Needro The catching department is also wide open for candidates, since Van Ladd, last year's understudy to AI Stevenson, will tmn his atten- tions to golf. At present, only Dave Yunich, Jack Sloatman and lZyg- mut Szcomzrowski have turned out, and all of these men lack expNi- ence in varsity backstopping. First base will again be held <!own by Ernie Brown, but second needs a man, as does third. Sopho- mores Myers and Amazon are looked to help Jill the gaps. Barry Marra will probably cavort again at short. The outfield boasts only Phil Duchsche:er as varsity candidate, but S()pho-mores Thomas, Roickle a.nd Miller may prove worthy fly- chasers. If the Spring-like weather keeps on, the team may take to the dia- mond much earlier than it did last year, an advantage of considerable worth. However, the squad will be outdoors at least by Easter, and since the first game is not until late in April, the· team should be in shape in time for the opening con- test with Middlebury here. The freshman call for material will not be issued. by Coach Art Lawrence for a couple of weeks in order to give the varsity plenty of time to take full advarttage of the gymnasium. Saturday night the Union Var- Jity basketball will journey to froy to meet R. P. I. in the last -5-ame of the s-eason for the Garnet • ive. The gaine will begin at eight J'clock a.nd it is expected that a .arge crowd of Dutchmen support- )fS will be on hand by virtue of the closeness of the previous meet- ,ng of the two arch-rivals. Intense Practice This week will be a week of in- tensive practice for the Nitcbman- itcs. Nels will work especially with the s.tarting five who are expected to be Dava Miller and Ken Brown at guards, Charlie Wiberly at cen- ter and Johnny Schultz and Cap- tain Ted PodJbielski at the forward posts. George Doyle and Vince Smith will be held in reserve and will probably see much action be- cause the tussle is expected to be hard-fought with numerous fouls. The remainder of the squad will be also depended upon for these same reas<Ons. Possession of the ball will be stressed throughout the practice sessions. R. P. I.

EverEst '37, chairman, announced tonight_ A committee of stewa:r-ds has been w01·king since the first of the. year in order to bring about a saving to the fraternities in this manner. When the final rules, call- ing for a trial period of one month, were submitted to the various groups by letter about two wee·ks ago, the request for an e.arly re- turn wa.s continuously stressed, Everest said. Only Six Answers Only six fraternities, including Delta Upsilon where Evet,est is steward, gave an answer to the proposal. Of these, only th.I'ee had signified their intention ol<J adopt the plan. As this number wc:mld not merit the desired reduc:tion in pric-es by the dealers involved, the matter is being dropped. The group spent considerable time in p-reparing the rules and ob- taining the necessary bid:~. They hacl: secured a reduction of ten per cent on all groceries, canned goods, meats, and vegetables, c:ontracts also called for an average reduc- tion of twenty per cent on all elec- trical goods. Under the system worked out the member houses would tElephone their orders before a s.peciEied time in the day and receive their goods before a set time. Any existing contracts would not preven.t partic- ipation in buying those articles not contracted for. A stipulation that all bills be .paid on or before the tenth of the month was Inserted to protect the dealers. Too Bad Everest's statement foll()ws: There will be 17 of these switches, each one x·un by a lit- tle clock, which may be set for any length of lime from 4 to 15 mmutes. At the expiration of the set time the switch turns off the lights and if the book- seeker wishes to browse a bit longer he must re-set the mech- anism. Dr. Webb wishes it to be understood that these little gadgets are not infernal ma- chines and that their installa- tion was not prompted by any deep Ia1d plot to exterminate faculty or students. \After all,\ he stated, \I make my living here.\ ----0---- Fox Objects to Ives Bill President Dix:on Ryan Fox was among the several New York edu- cators to sign a petition reques.ting ·that the State Legislature rescind the Ives Law which requires that an oath of allegiance be taken by .eachers in schools and other tax- exempt educational institutions.

Friday, March 5, 1937 \Continued from Page 1) Anayed against a portion of the present pet sonnel of the court and its champions, is the President and his adherents. a formidable and powerful combina- tion. President Roosevelt is a man of great political sagacity. No small -part of his po.pularity arises from his advocacy of sociul and ePonomic legislation which has made u pzofuund appeal to th\ fatzne1 and the industrial worker. To the youth of the country, who are without the pt·ospf'ct of a job, President Roose- velt's policies prom is!' irnmPdiatt' 1 e~ult::>. while the old order simply offers hope of ultimate pr·oS>perity if business is permitted to take its. cour::>e. 1rrespec- tive of the vit·tue~ of either policy. there is distrust of old formulas and leaders, b!'cause they have, ap- pa!·ently, failed to solve our most pressing problems. Such are the forces lined up in the present crisis. A consideration of the merit~ uf this controversy may be ::~implified by approaching it from the stand- point of the function of the Su.preme Cour-t in our constitutional 'lCherne of government, and an inquiry whether or not the Court ha::; efficiently pe1formed that function. This may lead to some constz uctzve suggf'stions. Mainta.ln Ch!'l'ks among other things, that there was an unlawful delegation of •the legislative pDWers of Congress t<J the President. A n-ew N. R. A., to be held valid by the most pro~ressive group of judges, would require an entirely different method of dealing with thE' regulation of industry. These illustrati\ons indicate how difficult it is for a judicial tribunal to satisfactol'ily deal with eco- nomic questions. If for a moment we are able to lay aside our pre- conception~. and approach the pre~ent problem with a stern lo-gic, it must be admitted that there aze weak-, nesses in our judicial machinery. Prot<>etion of Majority In the first place, what is the purpose of the checks an.d .balances of our constitutional system? rt is to secure the expression of a prepondet·ance ot settlement in three-fourths of the states, subject to the safe·guaz'd of a delay in tt·anslating that sentiment into law, until the Peo-ple are fllll)T informed of the merits of conflicting views. Chel!lts and balances in a republican form of government are designed to pi'Otf'<'t tht> major·ity from p{)werlul min()rities until a preponderance of sentiment has been created, and, also, to protect the majority against the uninformed and hysterical action of its·elf. In the end, a prepon- derance of sentiment in three-four·ths of the States muRt control, for th!' constitution itself is subject to revision when such a sentiment has been formed. t30 Yale Law Jour. 348}. Has the Supreme Court performed its function as a Richard Dix and. Chester Morris are featured as buddies in the navy. Dix is an expert diver, who, feeling the urge of domesticity, marries a dance hall hostess, while Morris goes off on a submarine de- tail. The erstwhile hostess, Dolores Del Rio, reverts to type while her ,;puuse is away and has an affair with Morris. Drama enters when Dix returns and smalls the rat, throws his buddy out of the house. Inevitably Morris' submarine founders and Dix discovering his wife's perfidy rescues the entombed men. Devil's Playgro1m-d ha.s no enter- tainment value beyond the scenes of the submarine wreck and! the diving operations. Miss Del Rio acts like a jelly fish about to go into a rhumba. A good issue of The March of Time and a short, featuring Judy Garland and Deanna Durbin, re- move so-me of the taste left by the main event. And the vaudeville, though it hasn't any strippers as the boys thought, is an amiable, fast moving r-evue. The chorines are good back- ground for some very decent acts.

Last Saturday's eventful :misfortunes were a fair sa.mple of what Union's traveling singers experience on their weekend trips. By unanimous ag1·eement of the seven membe1·s of the Junior Bocwd of The Concordiensis, five recommendations were handed to the Publications Boat·d this morning object- ing to tlw 1~evisions of the editorial staff made at the last meeting of the Publications Boa1·d. Suggesting that a greater centralization of responsibility was necessary, the Junior Board declared that the new policy \could work in theory, but not in actuality.\ A wards to Be Made To Athletic Teams Fifty-seven Will Receive Let~ ters or Numerals at Block U Dinner The member::; of the board who ::;igned the recommendation::; are: Edwat·d Barry, Julius J.

The petition is as follows: inent local judge, tried to placate the ruffled tempe!' of these foiled firefighters, embar1·assed for wapt of a fire to extinguish; but desp1te the most fervent pleas, the mem- bers of this frat€rnity were charged with the ex:pe.nse of bring- ing. the ·fire trucks on the scene. This reporter, in the excitement of the moment was not able to as- certain the names of the principal figures in the herdics. However in an exclusive interview· with one of the spectators the name of Doug- las Geer '39 was prominently men- tioned. It is thought that most of the credit for controlling the fiery inferno in the Beta. culinary head- quarters belong<:l to him. At the same timeT.

As all of the sojourning sing- ers co11ld not squeeze in.to one bus·, the group was split into two sec- tions.

The freshman hockey team received eight awards and the varsity swim- ming team ten. We, the members of the junior' board of The Concordiensis, pros- pective members of next year's sen- ior hoard, in consideration of the proposals made by The Publica- tions Board at its recent meeting for the revision of the senior edi- torial staff, wish to recommend several ehanges. We have decided ( ll that the system recently insti- tuted would not centralize respon- sibility; l2) that disagreements and disputes will almost naturally arise; and (3) that the democratic policy could wot·k in theory, but not in actuality. Not having the Itecessary uniforms for Hyman A. Enzer and J.

Damages-'lO Cents At the time of this writing the insurance companies had made no formal appraisal of the damages incurred, but it is believed that its extent will not exceed thirty-five or forty cents. The evening meal was not interrupted by this cataclysm and by tomorrow the members of this hous·e expect to have had the debris taken away. As an evidence of t.he fidelity of Unionmen representatives of eight fraternities rushed to the vicinity to lend their assistance in the case that it were needed. This true Union spirit was ph()tographed ·by the camera of several quick witted photographers, and it is hoped that The Concordiensis will be able to reproduce a few of the action shots. ---o---- 'rhe Sergeant very quickly pro- vided the theatrical group with the necessary paraphernalia, in fact he even fut·nished the transportation to the campus of the many articles i.n. the equipment, sending Ute whole collection up in a prowl car. .As a result of tlte courtesy of the Police Department an-d Sergeant FitzSimmons the ac- tor-police Hennessey- and En- zer will be garbed ou:t in the genuine regalia.

Meader's Talk on Art of Boring Hailed as Ideal Saturday Spe·ech With absolute disregard for all rules of dispassionate journalism, The Concordiensis hails an intelli- gent Daily Assembly speaker. Not a.shamer to call a spade a spade, President J. Laurence Meader of Russell Sage College recognizes that honeyed words of wisdom draw no bees as far as Saturday assembly attendants are concerned. Therefor.e, leaving behind all aca- demic and traditional precedents, President Meader spoke Saturday morning, not of high ideals, of lost causes, or the values of virtue- he spoke ou \The Art of Being a Bore.\ The-re are six or seven rules for one who would be a successful bore, said Dr. Meader. First, the borer must have a voice. He can have a high-pitched voice, or a rasping voice, or a booming, dicta- torial voice, or a mumbling voice, or a whining, whimpering voice. But under no circumstances can he have a rich, full throated, well- rounded voice. through which words drop in limpid, liquid sylla• bles. · Then the borer must have a very ge.neral smattering of the subject he is going to speak about.. And if he has just a little more genera.! knowledge of the subject than the person he is boring, the more suc- cessful he will be. Anothet· prime requisite is the te:chnique of digression. If he can make every other sentence the basis for a direvting remark lead<~ him still deeped into obscurity, he is on the roa.d to success. These techniques can be teste-d by the borer through observation of his audience. If the object of his borin·g intentions suddenly turns in the midst of the mono· Iogue and starts a conversation with another person, the borer has most surely achieved his goal, The effectiveness of being a bore can be best illustrated by the silent bore, who lets time and insuffer- able silence blast the nerves of his friend. Filled with important tidings of his heart-throb, Ws roommate pours out the great news. For at lea.st 30 seconds the would-be bore maintains silence. No sound welcomes the important word that has just been imparted. Then when the nerves of the happy one have been strained to the bt·eaking point, the borer says with all its supreme expressivenes&- \So what.\

Fire is a terrible hazard that every now and then strikes with. catasteophic swiftness often irrepa.mllle e ffectiveneRs on colleges dissem- inating thei1· m·dinarr atmosphere of de- corum and scholarliness with the honilJle stench of scandal.

LA..CH OF CHEERLEADERS Athletic wn tests u t Union are noticeably mm•ked by the lack of enthusiastic cheering. Whil.e out· tearns are making creditable per- formane:es in the field, the \stands\ remain mute. Yet :players and coaches have re- peatedly stressed the need of support feom the studetl t body. Union diff.ers in no way from other col- leges in tile composition of its student body. Why, tllen, is so little active support g-iven our teams?

By these enjoyable recitals, students are enabled to enjoy the gTeatest of musical masterpieces played and sung by the world's foremost artists. They me also able to request selections to be play- ed at future dates. It is a common belief that much of music's appeal is lost when it is transmitted to the listener by mechanical a.ppa1·atus. This, to a cel'tnin extent, is the case It is often ex- asperating to be confronted with an awk- ward pause in a beaatiful strain while the record is chang-ed. l\I uch of this inconven- ience, howeve1·, is ai>dished by the Cape- hart's automatic chang-ing· and turning of records. The principle objecthn to recorded music is that, to a slig-ht degree, it distorts the tone quality of the various instruments. The vic- h·ola is not able to reJH'oduce the very lowest and highest overtones which effect brilliance and timbre of a note. However, the vict!'Ola. is much more accurate in its expression o-f these than the radio. Another' reason why the radio falls short of the victrola is the iJ1terference of the vol- ume controller. He attempts to regulate the flow of sound so that a fairly even degree of volume is produced thoughout. This not only is monotonous but of course eliminates much of the fine shading and inspired cli- maxes of a well played selection. An additional advantage in listening to recorded music is the priceless right to play anything one wants at any time and the privilege of repeating at will in order to come to a more complete understanding and appre- ciative g-rasp of a composition. The informal atmosphere of the Tuesday afternoon concerts is conducive to hem·ino· b great music. We urg:e each student inter- ested in music to try ()ne of these recitals. In them he may find a. worthwhile and m- structive aftemoon diversion.

Twice in the last two weeks, however, I have beea forced by circumstances to view rehearsals .of \Winterset.\ It is with a great deal or pleas- ure that r point out to Mr. \twelve year old\ that he is cockeyed. I predict that \Winterset\ wiH be one of the best productions the Mountebanks have ever given. And that, if )\OU will recall some past Mountebank shows, is a rather sig- nificant statement. Please take my word for it gents,-don't miss it! O.ne who knows. Dear Editor: What's all the fighting .about over Dowling's column critising the O:>creen version of \Winterset.\ Of course, the Mountebanks are insane tl·ying to do \Winterset.\ Granted the Mountebanks are good; a.nd they have done some good! wm·k But \Winterset\ com- ing at this time is too difficult an undertaking. I personally, however, intend to go m!'rely- to see what they can do with it. A.nd boy! They're going to have to sh<>w me! I'm from Mis- som·i.

For, with the advent of :the spring season, Ia-: crosse has again been revived after a long rest during the winter months and, along with baseball and tennis, will occupy the spot- light of athletics during the C'()m- ing weeks. Lacrosse has always been an ex-· cellent sport at Union with win- ning teams far overtopping the losing, and this year bids fair to prove this point. !<,or, with practi- cally the entire unc:lefeated fresh- man squad of three years ago around which to build a team, Harkness will have wonderful ma- terial, both veteran and also from last year's frosh team.

Twenty-one salvos blasted the Bra- zilian quietude to smithereens as Frank's cruiser, bristling with guns and empty Schlitz beer cans, poured itself onto Brazil's sandy shores. The excuse for this indis- cretion, landing on the Brazilian coast when he ;;hould have been in Argentina, has never been ade- quately explained. Of course we should not expect that it would have been since Dr. Kingcross Yankpool is no longer one of the smiling-blue-gown henchmen. Com- pare Steel-roller Stanley Baldwin. It is rumored that King would wear the blue gown but he- had to quit because his mouth got tired of be- ing wreathed in smiles. For this reason it was found that he mixed pull-taffy much better than the po- ·litical pot, and a position was found for him more suiting to this voca- tion. To return to Brazil again after this digression, the pug-ugly we found in the water, now swim- ming to his hearts content who was on the sandy shore, gayly dancing, scarf fashion to the tune of MY COUNTRY, I AM SORRY THERE ARE THREE OF U8-Frankie, Elinor, and her, THAT WOMAN. The scene was dramatic, stupen- dous, colossal, it was oh so terribly fine.

A return match with Norwich has been scheduled for Saturday here. The latter· will be out to re· deem herself for· the defeat at Union's hands last Saturday, and at the present the odds are all in favor of Norwich. All the ex:citement and cheering that accompanies a professional boxing or wrestling match were present in the Alumni gym Wednes- day night as the intramural glad- iators fought ·or tussled themselves Into the final round which will take .place on Wednesday evening, M:areh 17. Th1·ee super-interesting bouts were he.Jd and seven wrest- ling events wel'e fought, all of ll'hich provided plenty of action .for the largest turnout of spectators during the four nights of fighting. Opening Match The opening match in the ring .tut,ned out to be a one round slug- fest as two hea.vyweights, Campbell .and Lynn, tore into each other as soon a.s Ed Fitz stepped out of range of the battery of flying fists. The two boys did not let up fo1· a second, but battered each other continuously until late in the round when Lynn began to show the ef- fects and a technical knockout was awa.rded Campbell. Kennedy and Sanderson were the next opponents a:nd again the crowd was kept in an uproa1·. Both warl'iors gave plenty ·for three rounds, but since neither had gained a satisfactory advan- tage, the bout went into an extra round, during which Kennedy man- aged to collect enough points to t'egister victory. The final bout b1·ought togeth.er Myers and Maines in as close a bout as has been fought this year. After a bruising tht'ee rounds during which the odds shifted alternately from one to the other, lMaines wa.s· declared the win- ner in a decision which could easily have gone either way. Bil Ketz took over the wrestling officiating for the night and Jler- formed a creditable job. In the first match, Lawrence gained a time ad- vantage over Tanner in three min- utes. Gem·ge Miller then took six minutes but managed to throw Ralph in a hard fought contest. Dennison next gained victory as he tossed Don DeLisa in four minutes. Mcintosh threw Shanley in five minutes, Thorne made quick worlt of Glennon, disposing of him in a Captain Jim Righter, who is the possessor of a nice case of spring grippe, has been in bed since Tuesday. When it is recalled that Righter won half of Union's vic- tories last Saturday, his loss might wei! mean the defeat of the team. And to top this off, Jerry Cohen, against Not·wich.

The concluding bout was delayed for ten minutes when one of the contestants failed to appear, but just as a forfeit was about to he d<>- clared he rushed in to take part in the gamest match of the night. Neither Horstman nor Braman suc- ceeded in effecting any result in the first four minutes, so ·each was aUoted a two minute per.iod to ac- complish a fall over the other. Horstman threw his opponent to ta:ke the first fall in 52 seconds, but Br·aman immediately !'etalliated to toss Horstman in 15 seconds, 1.hus gaining the decision by the differ- ence in times. In view of the fact that each night has afforded plenty of action in every class, the finals next week should draw practically the whole student body as spectatm·s to the most colorful event of the intra- mural program. Only the top-notch men in each weight division are left, so it can be guaranteed that the bouts will be evenly matched in every particular· and will afford as much color as could be obtained in a night at Madison Square Garden.

It means a man who commanded his own destiny, a man who created his own property and position, a man who made his own way and was not lifted through.

Rifenbaty Tuesday, Marcfu 16, 1937 WE PREFER WELL EHED \HOT ROC'Kf;\ Dr. 'I'yler Dennett, pr:esident of Williams College, was lampooned bly The Williams Rec- ord for his stinging nt.ilery of the \nice boys\ of his college. Decrying the well man- nered, sophisticated, and generally well dis- posed young men now apparently in the ascendency there, he evinced a desire to have a student body which ln\s more of a cross- section of American colleg·e life. Now we are inclined to ag-ree with Dr. Dennett to some extent, but when this cross-section exhibits a lack of kindliness a11d. of appr-eciation to- wards its own kind, it t~eveals the stuff it is made of, and we can no Junger harbor it any good feeling. Such is the state of ..affail·s here. Unicm has always pointed with ])ride to its hetero- geneous student body, ~ll intermingling· of students from all walks .()f life, which the name implies in name .and deed, and it is hoped we can continue teo observe Lhis tradi- tion. Howeve1· when a f.ew ill-bred juveniles know 110 better than tn ridicule the efforts of their fellow students, •we have certain mis- givings as to this attitude.

Part of the increase in efficiency that has come about in the power-generating field in the last few years has been due to increased steam temperatures and pressures. As a result., the model:ll turbine shell runs, almost literally, red hot. This shell must withstand pressures such as exist half a mile down in the ocean and must keep a 20-ton rotor spinning perfectly in line. Heat softens metal, just as it softens candy, and permits it to stretch. This stretch, however, must be kept to the merest creep-about one part in 1000, if the changes are uniform. and pressure of steam used in power generation have been raised to unexpected highs in the last few years.

Ruby Keeler says: ttLuckies are a light smoke that treat a tender throat right\ An independent survey was made recently among professional mea and women -lawyers, doctors, lecturers, scientists, etc. Of those who said they smoke cigarettes, more than 87o/o stated they personally prefer a light smoke. Miss Keeler verifies the wisdom of this pref .. erence, and so do otll.er leading artists of the radio, stage, screen and opera. Their voices are their fortnnes. That'~ why so many of them smoke Luckies. You, too, can have the throat pro .. tection of Luckies-a ligl..t smoke, free of certain harsh irritants remove<l by the exclusive process ttlt's ,..roasted\.

Exercise can :keep the muscles in shape, but there are a lot of things that can go wrong with the voice and throat. It stands to reason, then, that any actress wants a cigarette that is gentle a.nd strikes the right note with her throat. I started smoking Luckies 4 years ago. They're a light smoke that treat a tender throat right.\ LOVELY WARNER BROS. STAR NOW APPEARING IN ••READY, WILLING AND ABLE\ THE FINEST TOBACCOS- .

Thursday, l.larch 18.-\vVithin y.our generation the cause and cure of can.cer may be discovered,\ Dr. William P. Howard, of the Al·bany Medical School faculty, told stu- dlents in assembly today. \The field is ripe for discovery,\ he continued. \But it will require conscientious an:d pains-taking la~bor in the laboratory with spec- ialis-ts from every field of science cooperating. The last word of the medical world regarding cancer is still forthcoming.\ The average layman has been reading in the press that every case of cancer should be cured if caught in the early stages. How- ever, Dr. Howard pointed out, even though people were willing to con- sult their physician early, only a small percentage of the cases would be adequately cured. Many tumors are inaccessible, difficult to dis- cover and surgery an.d radiation are unable to produce beneficial re· suits. There is an endowmt>nt fund of about five million dollars for can- cer research, nearly $700,000 of it being spent annually. But, the proper re;;;;earch work must be backed up by the proper amount of money to carry out extensive ex- periments. \Fear and apprehension have a great deal to do with the malady,\ he stated. \These two together will sometimes do people more harm than the disease itself.\ to the sport writer-s of the metrop- After a review of the books cntl- olis.

All of which proves that the lot of a Hale House waiter is not a happy one. For in Hale House, where the diners write their own tickets, the waiter's first task is to translate the words written on the slips into comprehensible English, which would make the above read something like this: The play will be presented at the Bennington College Theater in the Commons Hall, under the auspices of the Drama Division of the col- lege, Enzer said after a telEphone consultation with George Ebeling of Bennington College. The company of 18 and th.e tech- nical staff of 14 inore will make the trip by bus Wednesday afternoon, arriving in Bennington in time to have an informal rehearsal on the new stage before the production at 8:00 p. m. The scenery will be ship· ped by van early in the mo•·ning with a skeleton stage crew, so that it can be set up in time for the re- ·hearsal. Tony Sharpe, John B. Dowling, Jr., and Ferdinand Helm, Jr., of the Mountebanks staff will drive to Bennington on Monday to make a final survey of the stage there for mounting their production. Although Mountebanks road shows have heretofore occured on week-ends, special permission for a mid.JWeek trip was granted last night by Dean Charles F. F'. Garis. It is expected that this trip will be the forerunner of a regular ex- change of productions between .Union and Bennington.

Not today, unfot'tunately, for today the verdure lies swathed in the depths of snow, a desolation guitahle only fo1· an ice-worm. The gil'ls -will find us ski- minded, and unless they al'e !'lteeled to its rigours, we can vision them using Absorbine Junior or Sloan's Linament copiously to a.rms, legs and back. Some happy individuals will say that dancing all night affects your muscles tremendously, but they never tried skiing for the fh·st time. We could finish this editorial up with a brief summary of all the pangs of falling off skis. However the more engaging act of welcoming all our guests is the cynosure of om attention. So we advise the wan and wallGw to stick to dancing and things, and to leave the .skiing to men. They will do better and have more your bread on the right side and. ,p<Jlish your apple on the left. By this we n1ean that the best way to come to know a professor is not through h·is work. Generally he is too wrap- ped up in it to be of much use, but seek him out as a pnsonality.

FOR WHISKEY ERASURE TRY A MILK CHASURE One of the disocouraging things a.bout an Interfraternity night is the morning after. A unique scien- tific solution to the problem has been offered to those who prefer to celebrate the weekend by get- ting soused. Dr. Norman Jolliffe, head of the alcoholic ward of New York's Bellevue Hospital, recom- mends a milk chaser! And it works. The scientific way (seldom used) to drink, says Dr. Joliffe, \is to take an eighth of an ounce of milk after each ounce and a half of whiskey, The milk d-elays the ab- sorption of the alcohol. It gives you othet· fluids, calol\ies vitamms, ner and Mr. and Mrs. Joseph Cross- berg.

Alcohol also al- lows one to talk back to the chap- erones and to forget completely about one's· date. But when cruel dawn rises once more on the campus, the heavy drinker had better start looking for a cure. Dr. Jol\i.ffe recommends .this: \Go home and drink one or two quarts of warm salty water <that cleans the system); then al- kalize with two quarts of seltr.er; and if you still survive, take a mild sedative such as a mixture of bro- mides and chloral hydrate.

If you happen to be stuck with some totally unconscious inebl'iate the best thing you can do for him, says Dr. Jolliffe, is to arouse him at once. You can do this efficiently by pressing your knuckles under his ribs. If he can't be waked, call a doctor~if you can arouse the doctor. In every case, intoxication comes from the same cause ... too many dlrinks. Despite the popular belief, mixing drinks is not a necessary cause fot• intoxication. The only thing is that the mixing drinker usually dlrinks too much.

The refet·eeing in aH cases- was very efficient; the \Joe Humphries'' of the night, BiU Ketz, did: himself proud, although he's pwbably still hoarse; just enough upsets were registe1·ed to keep t·he crowd continually on ed!ge; humor was provided as the two Phi Gams took turns at giving way to each othel' in a wrestling final; color and action appeared in several \knockouts; and lastly, as clever a show in boxing ability· as is offered in rnany a profes- sional arena was ·offered the non- paying customers. retained the titles they won last year while only two men • Io.st the championships they gained in the first intramural tournament held last Spring·.

The neVI< 165 pound champion, Don Hender- son, gave a neat eJGhibition as he threw hjs heavier op.ponent, Prest, in one of the better matches of the night. Lawrence Upsets ThOl'ne Art Lawrence, in the 155 pound c~ass, upset the apple cart for the fi1·st thne when he gained a time advantage of three minutes over last year's champion in the 135 pound d!ivision, Ray Thorne. Thorne had trouble in keeping- his feet all dluring the match, and Lawrence was awarded the win as he .piled up the minutes in his favor. Fay Begor became the 175 pound champion as he maintaint>d a three minute and a half Ume ad- vantage over Krull, in a struggle in which the -balance of power shifte-d from one to the other. Another sur- prising upset was registered in the concluding bout, as Burns managed to throw Riggs, champion in the 185 pound division after each had wrestled to a standstill for four minutes. In his overtime period, Burns took all the advantage and finally tossedl the struggling Jimmy woho, in his extra period, was unable to do anything with Burns . Sloa.tman Gives Exhibition In the box:ing match for which fans have been waiting two years to see, Jack Sloatman took the ring against Se!smer in the unlimited class. S!.()atman, a fighter of known reputation, merely put in enough blows to gain the decision over his game O'.p·ponent, who was retired after a volley of forceful blows late in the third round. Smiling Jack exhibited himself to his best an•d was hardly touched. The next fiight was a furi- ous affair in which Campbell and! Hammer- strom went at it with tooth and nail. After a med- iocre first round, the two .began to mix it up and both ended pretty l'aul ('ami•bell we II fatigued. Campbell was JAKE AMAZON the third frame, neither had much of an advantage. The fourth stanza was all Rmy though, as he landed about two blows to every one of Maines. The lightwe-ights were next on the program in a contest that turn·ed out to be more of a foot- race. Orton, by virtue of his tack of reach, was forced to back away from the 'blows of Burnham who forced the fight and was awarded the decision amid a burst of .booing from the stud'ents. The bout could have gone either way, and most of the crowd wanted an extra round. Ackerman Beats Rosen Ackerman disposed of his oppon- ent in the quickest •.bout of the pro- gram as he tore into Rosen from the opening bell and land:ed a hard right which 'broke Rosen's n-os·e. With blood covering his face, the game Rosen continued the fight, and landed some telling blows be- fore Ed: Fitz called it quits as Ack- erman again got in several more ja;bs to the face.

MUSIC By HERBER'£ 0. FOX II' II Jndicativc of America's awaken· ing to the value of classical music arE the results of the curt:enl MEtropolitan Opera season. As the present series draws to a close, box off·ic€ reports confirm that there is more interest in opera this year than at any time since the hey-day of Italian opera in the beginning of the 20th cent my. It was then th:at the greatest opera singer <Jf aU t1me, Enrico ,Caruso, sang to ·paclt:ed houses. The interest in the Wagner m u- sic dt·amas flag:ged considerably in th·e 1~20';< •becuus~ of the unofficial ban placed on all German ar·tists b~· the AmPrican public. In fact when the Metropolitan did at last permit a W-agnor opera to be sung, it waE< in English. Huge Get man damsels, upon seeing King Mark's ship approaching in the last act of T:rh>tan, woUJid exclaim ecstatically, \Ach der ist ein sheep.\ This sort of lhing was herdly conducive to the ap.preciation of Wagner's pro- ductions. Now, however, we find an en- ti I'ely different situation. One must order tickets weeks in advance in order to get seats to a performan-ce of 'J.'t•isten. In fact, if we judge fr\om box: office returns, 'l'nstali Is the most popular production <>n B:roaclway. This .popularity is due to two reasons. First, there are very few good Italian singers availal> 1e, so the emphasis is on the German Works. Second, lhe greatest Wag- llEI'i'an cast of recent yeat·s, com- prisEd of Kirsten Flagstad, Karin R>ranzell, Lauritz Me!Phoir, and F'riederick Schorr. is exhibiting· Wagner at his best. NonE of these, h<Jwever, are German. Flagstad is a N'orwegian, Franzen a Swede, M:el- ehi~r a Dane, and Schorr a Hun- g:o.I·ian. This is partly due to the A.merican boycott on GPrman sing- ers beeause of Hitler's Jewish per- secution. Also, during the war years Germany was in no position to Eos- ter young singers, whereas, in the pEaceful Scandanavian countries, music and art flourished a.s usu.al. Quite a literary furor has been raised this year about these four singe1·s. Articles lauding their work havc appeared ln many leading pe- riodicals such as The New Yorker, Stage, and Life. Lawrence -Gilman, o:f the New York Herald Tri,bune, a.nd Olin Downes of the New York 'I\im.es have •both been enthusias- tl: c in their praise. Next Sunday night at 1(} o'dock the General Motor.s Co·ncert will feature Kirsten Flagstad, and, as it was: announced last week, Fried- nic 11 Schorr will visit the campus on .April 16th. ------0----- NC)tes On Contemporaries :Fowttain of Youth In treating strawbet·rie'S with carbon ·dioxide, three e:xperirneilf:- e:rs at the Universlcy- of Minn~sota farm have found a way io lengthen tlleil' s.ale.abJe life. ----o---- IN THE MAIL S«:hedule 1\:icker Dear Editor : Once ag-ain we .find ourselves 1 e· mammg In classes while our friends attending other colleges are at home. I think il high time that the administration of this collt>g begin definitely to designate the Easter WEek as the week of Spring Recess. Well, you may say that F:n~tPr came during spt·ing recess last year, but there again is u !'ut.-h We who are not local boy<d, at lea,;t, had to travel on our wuy bark to college on Easter day. Of com s<> it may sound rather immat<>rial. but it seemg as though Union ColiPgP must consld€r itself a \lora! s<\hool\ when it glv<Js its students no time in which to return from spPnd· inp; one of the fot·emost holl<lay~ of the year at home, when it actually forbids ittS rnost valuable stu<ll'nt~. those from towns at considet ub!e distance fr<Jm Schenectady, from spending the holiday with their families. Let us hope the admin!stiUtion will take this matter into account when making out the college sch<\d- ule for the next year. ObSPI'Vi'l'. Httulent Govemment Editor, Concordiensi!S: Several ll3onths ago the student council pr<r.1JOSed a list of recom- mendations concerning our student, government which were to be pn· sented to the student body at a special m~eting. Among these rec· ommendations, there was one per· taining to a new form of student t·epresentation on a new council set-up. This provision was delegated to a committee which appears to have quietly given un the ghost. Meanwhile, the student council rests on its laurPis, the committee rests on its obscurity and the chairman of that committee juHl rests. And all the while, the student body is accused of ·beinl!; indiffer- ent! At the •beginning of this scholas- tic yea!'. student ·body meetings were held in the Old Chapel evf'ly Monday at 10:00 a. m. After a month or s-o, they were held at in- tervals of every month. Whereas attendance at the weekly meetings had increased, and the time ai sev- eral meetings proved barely suffi- eint for the negotiation of the day's business, thereafter at the monthly meetings, interest and attendance both declined proportionately. It was at that time that this so-called indifference set in. Who has ibeen responsible for the apathetic attitude of our student bodoy; the students or their leadet·s? Various issues have arisen this year which are yet to be untangled. There is the question of our stu- dent govet•nment, of our rushing system, and of freshman rules which sorrtil think has yet to be adequately met with. And there are a host of other new problems pet (Cont;lnued on Page 4) Ther1 a:bout . spent I at ~ COUl\S€ place\ u ~L1eteh Wh~t looklBg a 1\0\\r l plat~s. tltOi·l' \1 but tbt• tlte UJll! and ;;t• onto stl It \<J( have b1 twice t they at thing e and, .()] elected ---we ~ were c1 posed •t last ·\Ve congiE!

Edu.:latio:il mig·ht be divided into two classes the cultivation of the mind and character, and the train- ing of the !body, Ba:ker remarked. \Mtei\ the past weekend we all agree that theve it! still a third and .perhaps more impc>rtant function in going to c()llege,\ he added. Learning not onl~ aids the stu- dent to see 01bjects in a. more use- ful light, ;but also helps him to think arouses bis curiosity and giveS'' the student cc>ordination. We are learning to disti:nguish the bad from the good, the useful from tl~e useless and to <lrganize fact£; m logical, u~ful fo:.:m. \The physieal asiJect of college traini11g has .been to- me one of the most important phases, ·both as participant and spectato1·,\ Baker .stated. \I •believe that college has instilled ·in me a:nd in my class anates a worthwhile habit of rec- reation. Union is a school where the fellow with a minimum of ability can .participate in almcat any spOl't .and t»lll not tee! left out. Despite the fact snow still covers the campus, spring has definitely arrived. For Union's special robin, Frederick Calvin, manager of the Mohawk Drama Festival, is again building a nest on the second floor of Silli- man Hall. Buried deep in piles 1>f plans for the forthcoming season of Union's outdoor theatre, confer- ring with printers and the ver- satile Mr. Enzer about publi- city, Mr, Calvin still finds time to renew his many acquaint- ances at Union. His cheery smile and ever-constant cigar provide welcome companion- ship for late-working Concordy editors in the wee hours of the morning, Schenectady's official recep- tion of the Drama Festival's of- ficial receptionist was hardly hospitable, however. Arriving late Tuesday evening he parked his car and retired. In the morning a bright I'ed ticket adorned his windshield wipe1·, an invitation from one of Sche- nectady's Finest to visit Judge Fryer. But the officer reeked little of the tremendous prestige of the Festival. Mr. Calvin got his money back. Prom Band Choice Narrowed to Four Rhep Fields, Russ Morgan, Bud Hopkins, Ozzie Nelson Are Available The field of prom bands which are available to the budget of the Union Junior Prom Committee has narrowed down to four big-time bands, chairman Hm·old Ackerman announced yestet•day.

I am fully aware of th.e fact that the Dean·s Office now sponsors a Freshman Handbook, but thi.s is woefuUy in- adequate when information is re- quired f·or a gr·eat many things not in the Freshman handbook. I also know that the Garnet has supplemented to some degree the information which is not supplied in the Freshman handbook. The F·t·eshman hand-book contains only the songs and cheers, the Fresh- man rules, which, incidently, now amount to practically nothing, the rules of registration, and the Pres- ident's message to the incoming class. The Garnet, on the other hand, contains the names of all the students, together with the activi- ties of the Seniors and Juniors, the pictures of the Juniors, pictures and names of the member:; of the Fraternities, honorary as well as nationaL and a few Bhm·t write-ups 1 conjUl'es up opinion of differetlt kind in so:rne quarters. Many attH\- orities feel that it is a defeat for the French, ,a weakening fo the tie uf the Little Entente, and a step for- ward in the Italian and Gcrtnan drives for influence and power in the Balkans. The approach to a:rni- cable rela tlons between Italy and Yugoslavia has been slow ever since Italian troops took Fiurne. This pact Is therefore regarded by some students as a climax to the steady rna.t•ch during the past three years towat·d cooperation between the two nations. They feel that there is trothing ulterior in the mo- tive behind the agreement. Hobe1 t Doig [tDbert Ft>rgu~on J. Bund;;uo Sophomore Boanl A.s~istant Editors F. Hequcmbourg, W. Hitchcock: D.

Conscious that this practice is not uncommon, tlie colleges plead that they must rela.:x entrance require- ments t<J meet competition. Thus the Eliot plan of surrendering edu- cational a utbor-itiy to the under- graduate has gradually yielded place to tbe dominance of college policy by ·the sub-freshman.\ In this way does the writer sum up neatly the big fault with Amer- ican education of today. The ele- ment of commercial competition, proverbially an intrinsic part of everything .American, has spread even to the fie.ld of education, which should be safest from its taint, if anything is to be. One can- not deny that the sub-freshman is dominating college policies. Competi ti<>n among the institu- tions of learning resembles compe- tition between two .gasoline stations situated acrC>ss the street from each other. l!ifost college administrations are haunted by formless little fears of declini.ng enrollments and lost prestige. The methods they use to make certain that these fears will not be I'ealized reek disgustingly of questionable bllsiness tactics. Silver-tongue.d salesmen are sent out to recruit likely prospects. Tui- tion rebates, euphemistically term- ed \scholal'Ships are lavishly dangled as bait. The bars of en- trance requil'ements are let down until any vestiges of them that re- main are a joke, Athletic teams of suspicious professional proficiency are moulded too give the institution nationWide ••prestige.\ A few enemic \bright boys\ are openly subsidized. l \We have scholars as well as ath- letes.\) What It all amounts to in the end is big business, operating unadul- terated under a thin veil of subter- fuge. American education is con- ducted in true native fashion. In America today, just as in the Eng- land that Carlyle saw in 1843, everything is a. racl>et, and we should deplore -wh.at he deplored: that the people accept it. A foitnight ago President Ferry announced that the language re- quirement for admission to Hamil- ton had been lovvet·ed. The idea be- hind t:he cba.nge was not, however, fear of a diminishing enrollment. That the plan is experimental has not been made clear everywher·e. The faculty is bent upon finding out whether ~1· not a better type of stu- dent might be attracted under the new requb·em.ents, Jt is well known that many language requirements have been filled in the past by hav- ing th~ material forced down the throats of ]lrep school and summer school \scholars.\ At any rate the plan has been approved for one year only. W'e have yet to see how it will wol'lc out. Hamilton is still one of th.e few remaining institu- tions adniira.bly free from the usual college tactics a.nd policies. of the college sports. The old handbool> contained everything now in the Freshman ha.nd>book. and all the sports scores of the year. Appar·ently the editor~ felt that .the Garnet and the Col- lege catalogue were sufficient to supply information on the individ- ual students. But-what I consider most important after this long in- troduction-the handbook con- tained a number of codes, consti- tutions, eligibility rules, rules for the making of athletic awardB, of which most of us are hardly aware. Also a complete list of all campus activity officers, whether clubs or sports was contained here. Among some of the constitutions which were pu,blic property at the time of the publication of this last hand- book { 1930-1931 > were; 1, the Con- stitution of the Student Body; 2, Regulations which g·overn Student Activities; 3, Constitution of the Athletic Board and the by-laws; 4, ConBtitution of the Undergraduate Publications Board and the by- laws; 5, Constitution of the U. C. C. C.; 6, Constitution of the Inter- fraternity Council and the by-laws: 7, Rushing Rules of the Interfra- ternity Council; 8, Constitution of The Mounteban]{s and the ·by-laws: 9, Constitution of the Musical As- sociation which included the Glee Club. the band, the Gar·net Gnb- lins, the by-laws. and rules for Electing Cheer Leaders, and Song Leader·s. Even if it were found to be im- practical to issue a new edition of this pocket-size, leather•bound handobook, still I feel that there should be come campus publication in which these constitutions and other bits of information should be readily available. As a membet• of the class of 1939, which is definitely the best class on the campus, bar none, I wish to · malte my demand felt for this bit of inf-ormation which will add ma- terially to the daily comfort and welfare of the students. May I re- quest that the Concordiensis begin a campaign with printed ballots for the re-issuance of the Union College Handbook by the Publica- tions Board? I think that results will follow as soon a!l this letter is printed in the Concordiensis. Thank you, Sophomore. ---o--- Notes On Contemporaries Cut-Rate Cosmetics CINEMA By JOHN B. DOWLING Know ye by these presents that the author of this column is in no way connected with the \Jabie\ who dt·ooled forth that \Idle Drivel\ .column in Friday's Concor·- diensis, as has been charged. The person responsible is one of the Juni.ar Board rebels whu i:; filling, temporarily we hope, the space o~cupied by Uncll' Willy':; \Just in Jest,\ which is at present the object of a fine cat and dug fight her-e in the officP. 'fille Business in Hand Swing Iligh, Swing Low (Para- mount; Director, Mitchell Lei sen; Proctot:s, falls below the standm·d of previous comedies entrusted to Carol Lombard and Fred McMur- r·ay. Opening with high promise and a well set comic pace, Swing IIigb, Swing Low itself toward the end in a morass of emotion and pumped up situation, gets too serious f<>.r its own go~d. McM~rray has just been mus- tered <JUt of the army at Panama when he loses all his money paying the .fine for a ruction in a cafe over ruiss Lombard, a hairdresser on a ship passing throu~h the locks. She misses her ship, goes to live with McMurray and his piano- playing friend Charles Butter· worth. Discover·ing McMurray's talent for piaying a hot trumpet, she wangles him a job in a cafe and posing as his wife works there also as a hostess. Success comes to the Trumpeter, he hies himself to Broadway, she waits, he gets caught in the whirl and doesn't send for her, although they have been married before he lea ws. Fron1 that point on Rwlng Hlgl!, Swing Low degenerates as comedy, becomes just another story of a man's downfall and eventual re- demptlo.n by the faith of a woman. In all fairness this film is good entertainment even after its ·break- down, but still it will disappoint McMut•ray-Lombard fans.

Janet Gaynor says: uLeading artists of the screen prefer Luckies'' An independent survey was made recently among professional men and women-lawyers, doctors, lecturers, scientists, etc. Of those who said they smoke cigarettes, more than 87% stated they personally prefer a light smoke. Miss Gaynor verifies the wisdom of this pre£ .. erence, and so do other leading artists of the radio, stage, screen and opera. Their voices are their fortunes. That's why so m.any of them smoke Luckies. You, too, can have the throat protection of Luckies- a light smoke, free of certain harsh irritants removed by the exclusive process ~~It's Toasted\.

I suppose it's just natural that Lu.ckies would be the favorite brand because most of my friends in pictures ha<ve discovered that the long hours of rehearsing and shooting at the studio place a severe tax on the throat.
