The rea- son they do not belong here is that thes ure wasting their time, they put little in it and take away even less. The students here, m· at any other place, fall into four ecttegories: those who find time only to study, those to whom extra-curri·culal' activities comp1·ise the principal course of college, those who find a happy medium and combination of both, and a fourth who spend from six weeks to five ~·ears doing nothing. While it would be interesting to evaluate each of the four. our purpose is to coiiSidel' only the last, :pl\in- cipally because that g-roup is the most pel·- nicious and does the most harm. Modern American colleg-es function m such a way that many a young man after the successful completion of fom· years JW€p- aration walks into the wo!'ld ready to face every exigency in life with the expectation of mastering it or at least with some knowl- edge of how to protect himself from it. T'he problems of life will not be strang-e to him. Of course perfection of this scheme would necessitate that students share in every p-lan o.f college activity, a not too impossible Uto- pia under favorable conditions. Unfortun- ately for both parties, however, the college as well as its students, only partially succeed in attaining this goal, and often as not, have. no success whatso.ever. From the point of view of the student, the bookworm, the athlete, or the clubman, who finds time for only singleness of pm·~ pose, it appears that by concentrating· his ef~ forts on one thing and one only, he will in the end be the gainer, since activity in one does interfere with the other to some ex- tent. It is this lack of coordination between them that causes our system to collapse. If the scholastic inte1·ests of the college would would mean that the criterion~!' jttdging the S. Gilbert.

THE GLE.E CI,UB CO:NCERT Satmday evening, for the fhst time in several years, the entii'e student body had an oppm·tunity to heal' the col lege Glee Club in a concert Gll the campus. 'Tlu joint pro- gram which the club present«ed in conjunc- tion with the Skidmore Glee Club was an unqualified success-musicall,y. The songs wel'e well chosen and well-nigh perfectly rendered. Ilal'dly anyone wh() attended th,~ cunceti had realized heforel-.and that the (;lee Club WlH so excellent. But there is a la.rge gToup ()ll the campus which does not realize how go-od the Glee Club i..c:;. That g·mup includes t:he 80 per cent or mon: of the student body wh<> did not at- teJtd the concel'i. It is difficult to understand why the concer·t and dance, S() carefully ar- J'angPd and V\.·ell·pi~esented by tlte Glee Club; received so little support fron students in the way of att~mdance. lt seem::~ to us that anything so enjoyable a:s the Saturday eve- ning concert -was should be he~tv]!y attended. Those who did not attend the concert we1·e definitely the losers for it was by far th.e best music~le presented on the campus in years. Dt·. Elmer A. Tidmai\Sh and the members of the Glee Club des.erve unlimited pt·aise fol' the excellence of tile ir work and for the skill with which botll concert and dance wei·e maiiaged.

Each selection in the Union Club's program was well sung, but there were several that stood out as exceptional, On Great Lone Hills, an adaptation of Si:])elius' Finlandia, was sung with such feel ing that one cotLld imagine oneself on the great, sllaggy hillsides of the composer's native land. This piece, the national hymn of Fin land is so typica..l of the nation of its origin and S() ·replete with emo- tion, that before the war, it. was 'lot allowed to be played in north west Russia because of the nation alistic furor it always created among the subjugated Finns'. The C1•eation Hymn by Rach- maninoff, which Is an arran~<~ment 'lf his Prelude rn () Sharp Minor was sung with great gusto. The arrangement is -particularly inter esting because of t.he unique blend- ing of the piano and voices in the ce.ntral theme.

His subtle changes from na:.tural voice to fal setto were very effective, This beautiful song, with soft back.- ground in the voices of the entire Glee Club offered a sharp contrast to the majestl~ Creation Hymn which followed, The medley o:f Union songs ar ranged by Edgar Moulton was novel and effective in its method of pres.enting oul' songs in a well knit unit by means of beautifu modulations. However, the Alma Mater, in this commentator's opin ion, was too choppy, and in several places ga:ve the inpression of being almost .syncopated. It was written as a hymn an·d should be sung so The Skidmore Club sang four numbers from which the Indian Lament by Madsen, in which short cres·cendos created the weird effect of primitive rnu~ic and Devotion by Strauss were outstanding. The high, s}lot of the evening however, was wllen the combined clubs sang N<It Afraid, from the Oratorio Elija.h by Mendells sohn, with an organ accompani ment by Dl'.

By CHARLES B. HONHiEL In the edit01ial entitled Thirty Years of Basketball which appeared in the Dec. 8th issue of the Con- cordy, refe~;ence is made to the opening of the thirtieth basketball season. Although the Concm dies of the year 1906 state that year saw the fii~t Union College basketball team, there is evidence that a col- lege team existed and funct·ioned as early as 1899. On January 21, 1899 the Concor- diellBis ran the following story on · page 6: \That Union is to have a basketball team is an established fact. Fifteen basketball ·enthusiasts met in the Gym last Tuesday night and took definite steps towaids its organization. From among the can- didates, F. M. Thebo '02 was elected captain of the Varsity, and Hin· man '02 was elected to captain the second team. Practice began Fri· day night and will continue every Monday, Tuesday and Fiiday night the remainder of the season.\ At this initi'al meeting it was de- cided that only the ca.ptain of the first team should be a permanent player on the varsity; the other positions were to be open to com· petition and changes were to be made at the disctetion of the cap- tain and coach. Physical Director Pollard was chosen manager. 1899 Team Plays This team, which was organiz~d .Jan. 17, 1899, did function. On Feb. 18, 1899 the Concordy reports the following: \The newly organized college basketball team went up to Amsterdam Feb. 3 and played a re- markably good game against the Y. M. C. A. team of that city. It was their first game and although they did not win it, their playing showed that much may be expected from them in the future.\ Union lost this game 9 to 14. On page 6 of the same Concordy another refe>ence is made to the team: \The basketball game last Friday evening <Feb. 10, 1899} at Fort Edward, between the team of the Saterlee Hose Company (not fire engines; real honest hosiery} of that place and the 'varsity', resulted in a victory for the former by a score of 25 to 5. At the conclusion of the game, a banquet was ten- dered them by the members of the hose company at their house.\ On Feb. 24, 1S99 the Union Five was defeated at Troy by R. P. I. 40 to 12. The 1 eport of the game states in part as follows: \The R. P. I. men played a clean gentlernenly game throughout ... and the waxed floor proved a great hinderance to the best efforts of our team, and since the baskets were ·on posts and not fastened against the walls, there was no chance for carom shots. The out-of-bounds was behind the beals, not before them, a.; in the \gym so that our team, had a number of disadvantages to contend with.\ On Feb. 25, 1899 the \college bas- ketball team\ was defeated by the Watervliet Y. M. C. A. 4-0. Ac- cording to the Concordy, \The game was hotly contested only two bas- kets being thrown, one in each half.\ The Rutland Y. M. C. A. was the next opponent ()f the team of '99, <--.-------:::::: :---: Lineup Chang·ed for Games; Dave Miller Wibel'ly Play PINE GROVE DAIRY, Inc. Both 118 S. FERRY ST. SCHENECTADY, N.Y.

E. and Oth~r Honorary Societies Tuesday, Dec. 29.-J'ohn Nicholas Vroo:rnan Vedder '95, professor of thermodynamics, was buried today from the Memorial Chapel of the college, where he had taught for almost a quarter of a century. He died on Saturday of a heart attack at his home located at 115 Coun- try Club Drive at the age of 63. He was one of the founders of the Hale Club, and one of the most beloved members of the faculty. Theoretically professo1· of thermo- dynamics, he was also a scholar in other fields. Professor Vedder was born at Niskayuna, Schenectady county, the son of Abram Vedder and Mary Vrooman Vedder. Hi~ ancestors set- tled in the Mohawk valley in the seventeenth century. Graduated Union 1895 He prepared for Union at the Union Classical institute and was O'raduated here in 1895.

When college students were for- bidden to read or keep in their rooms any play, novel or romance, \except such as belonged to the college or society libraries,\ when it was deemed \lawful\ for John Taylor to open his reading room for on.e hour only on Tuesdays and Saturdays; and when it w_as per- missible for a student to wxthdraw only one book at a time, Union's library was faced with the task of malting itself in student life. At one time, when West College was sold, the library was even packed away in boxes for two years. The first 50 years saw numerous literary socities flourishing quite well. And the college library was by no means the only source of books on the campus. Philomath- ean, Adelphic, Adelphia.n, Pithonian and Delphian societies bitterly fought among themselves for col- lege honors, for the position of He- brew orator, Greek orator, speaker of the college house of representa- tives and senate. EJach organization supported its own library, issued catalogues and made available those books which the regular library failed to have. JOHN N.

Edgar Moulton, co- leader of the Glee Club said that the concert will be given in re- sponse to the urgent request of the student body to hear a club which Dr .. Wainger Urges its ta.J\ funds support. Approximately sbdy girls of the Sav ing of Humans Skidmore Glee Club are expected . to take part, and all of them will Writers' Project Is Valuable In Preserving Integrity Of Unemployed \We must conserve the human resources of our country if we are to conserve it;; institutions,\ stated Dr. Betrand M. Wainger, assistant -professor of English and State di- E'ector of Federal Writers' Project, in an address before a banquet of the stat€ Conservation Association which is printed in the current is- sue of the \New York Conserva- tionist.\ Pointing out that dictatorships gain their strength from unem- ployed, discontented people, Dr. Wainger described the Federal Writers' Project as \important to om· national welfare\ for it af- fords renewed opportunity and con- fidence to hundreds of the unem- ployed of this country. A member of Dr. Wainger's staff, an unem- ployed newspaperman, spontan- eously remarked to his fellow staff members \ ... this job is an oppor- tunity, the last o.pportunity we shall ever get, to prove to society . . . that we can do something worthwhile, that it needs us and can use us.\ Dr. Wainger told members of th~ Consez'Vation Association that \within that broader meaning of the term 'conservation' must be in- cluded in the preparation of a New York State Guide and of a National Guide by the Federal Writers' Project dine at various fraternity houses before the concert. After the re- cital, in which the two clubs wlll collaborate on two numbers, there will be a dance in the gym, Dance Afterwards Admission to the concert will be by athletic tickets, to the students, and will be fifty cents t<J outsiders.

Enzer announced this afternoon. The postponement, he said, is due to the fact that Earle Mitchell, supervising director of the Federal Theatre Project, will be unable to direct the play as originally plan- ned. In a letter received this morning, Mr. Mitchell wrote that his leave of absence has been cancelled, a.., the the project are urgently needed. He services of non-relief directors of will probably be assigned a show opening at .the same time as the Mountebanks play. Meanwhile, a committee headed by director Edward L. Carroll is in New York interviewing several promising prospects, and a new di- rector will be chosen in time for tryouts next Friday :or Saturday. The play, which won the Critic's Prize as the best produced on Broadway during the 1935-36 sea- son, has achieved wide fame in both legitimate and cinematic pres- entation. The leading roles of Mio and Miriamne were taken by Bur- gess Meredith and Margo, respec- tively. Written in blank verse, it is the story of a youth who seeks out the men Who falsely executed his father for a crime he did not com- mit. If one witness had appeared to testify, his father would have gone free, and Mio has determined to find that witness. By a peculiar coincidence, all of the principals in the case turn up one dark night in a little tenement under the Brooklyn bridge where Garth, the witness lives, and Mio is alm~st assured of achieving his desire. However, he finds that he ha.-:; fal- len in love with Garth's sister, Miriamne, and this stands in the way of his revenge and causes the eventual death of the girl and boy. -------01------- Union Defeats Williams In Debate on Utilities Thursday, Janu.ary 7.-Union College defeated Williams by the unanimous vote of the judges in a radio debate over WGY tonight at 11:30 p. m, The topic was \Elec- trical Utilities Should Be Owned and Operated by the Government.\ Upholding the affirmative for Williams wa.-:; John Paul Causey and Julius Glaser.

The much- needed improvoeltlents were the di- rect result of Jlrotests made previ- ous to the recess about conditions in the dormito ;ry section in. a peti- tion presented by 1·esidents of the section to the .college administra- tion. Another irnp;rovernent made dur- ing the recess was the installation of a sprinkle1 .system in the Ad- ministration B111l-ding for the pro- tection of the many valuable rec- ords stored there. The attic of the building was aJso insulated to pro- vide further protection. In an effort to solve the parlting difficulties on the campus, men are now working on. a parking space between the Chemistry and Electrical Engin:oeering Buildings.

Rushing .Regulations Everest and Kenned(V also rec- ommend that a system of frater- nity rushing be adopted in order to provide prospective pledges and fraternities with a better oppor- tunity to become acquainted and thus develop better satisfaction and harmony between the two. It is recommended also that the fraternities, working with the N.S.F.A. committee, adopt a sys- tem of cooperative buying for food, furniture, etc. The recommendation is also made that the Student Body adopt the freshmll,ll. rules proposed by the Student Council. A committee, composed of Rob- ert Everest Lex-officio), Richard Kennedy, l'lorman Stewart, and Kenneth Brown, will ·begin work immediately on the proposal for a change in the method of elections and will present a plan to the Stu- dent Body by February Ist. Everest and Kennedy represented Union College at the annual con- ference of the National Student J:t~ederation of America which was held December 28-January 1 in New York City. Reports Discussed The convention was divided up into 15 commissions for the pur- pose of studying student problems including the structure, finance, powers of student governments and other activities. Reports of ·these commissions were submitted to the convention and discussed. A new syste·m of rules for fresh- mll,ll. conduct was adopted Monday at the Student Body Meeting, and a proposal made to establish a court to judge freshmen guilty of violating rules.

Fred Hequembourg Friday, January 8, 1937 JOHN N. VEDDER The passing of Dr. Vedder has removed from the hearts of his associates, friends and students an ideal imbued with the traits of a true scholar and g·entleman. Those of us who have ever had the opportunity to hear this kindly man .speak on profound or light subjects have marvelled at the scope of his learning and the depth of his understanding. .:\Iany have also left his presence broadly g1·inning or roaring with laughter at his in- estimable wit. Truly Union has suffered a great loss, but a loss which will mellow and ripen into a wonderful memory as the count- less tales of his witticisms are handed down through posterity. CENSORSHIP?

In order not to make the cost of leaming too expensive private c<J!leges have been forced to keep tuitions far below the budget-balancing level, anticipating the re- turns .of private endowment and. subscrip- tion to compensate for whatever losses had been incurred. Along with the advantag-es of private education already commonly known these colleges try to make thernsel ves less and less an extravag-ance. One of the sources of private endowment, and without doubt the most common, springs from donations of alumni. In fact an annual due is expected, Ol' at least requested, from every alumnus, and a substantial fund is built up yearly. Of course the burden falls on the men that have moderate and extensive means. Yet there are still a great number of small contributors who recognize the obliga- tion they owe the college, and in their own small way take steps to pay it. It is custo- mary to approach the graduates each y.ear to ascertain the extent of their willingness to contribute their alumni dues.

DOWLING Sing Me A Love Song (Warner Brothers) features James Melton in a class B production propped up by such standbys as Hugh Her- bert, Walter Catlett, Patricia Ellis, Allen Jenkins and Zasu Pitts. With so many accomplished comedians in the cast it is only reasonable to expect that the picture be amus- ing. Unfortunately it is not. The story revolves ab<Jut one of the old tried and true plots, and because the writers had nothing new to contribute emerges as noth- ing more or less than a framework in which Mr. Melton may sing and try to act. Cast as the playboy owner of a department store, Melton is per- suaded to assume active control of the store. But first he works as a clerk and incognito. While work- mg in the music department he meets Pat Ellis and the usual things happen, and happen until the closing clinch, VI'. W. M. with. the affairs of the Lester fam- ily, whites of the lo\'est strata, Tobacco Road provides quite a · shock to the average theatre-goer, who has little realization to what a low level it is possible for human. beings to sink. It is J>artly by its novE>lty that the play has gained such tremendous drawing power. But it is more than novelty that makes Tobacco Road a success. The strong dramatic power of the piece and the opportunity it affordJS for deep, thorough, anli. interesting cha!\acterizations are D!OlSt impor- tant. Th.e principal role, th=:~t of Leeter Lester, is as difficult a..s any actor could wish to assume. Besides re- quiring- the difficult dialect of an old rnan, a poor Southem white, it demands the ability to. rnake sud- den and complete changes in emo- tion and expression. Ta;:Ybr Holmes assumes this role, in the current production, with ability. Never once does ·he falter in his characteriza- tion, Lnd his portrayal oQf the half- crazed old man is forceful and con- vincing. As Ada, his -wi:fe, F1orence Gerald gives a sympathetic, mov- ing performance. As an evidence of the increasing taste of American music lovers for the operatic classics, the first two performances of the Metropolitan Opera Con1pany were the heavy Wagnerian works \Die Valkure\ and \Tristan and Isolde.\ The opening performance in the past has usually been one of the lighter operas given for the benefit of those in the audience who are . merely exhibiting their sociaJI pr-es- tige. This year h<Jwever, there was none of the usual \rah-rah\ spirit of the opening night. This is due in some part to Kirsten Flagstad whose inspired singing exhibits Wagnerian opera at its best. \Tristan und Isolde,\ the second performance, is probably the most difficult opera to sing in the pres- ent Metropolitan repertoire. Isolde is on the stage at all tir:nes ex- cept during a small part of the third act. This calls for remarkable endurance. Mme. Flagstad at no tirne spared her voice. It seemed to grow in resonance and volume until the curtain finally closed on the famous \Liebexstod\ aria.. Supporting Mme. Flagstad were Lauritz Melchior, Kirsten Thor- berg, and Julius Huehn. On New Year's Eve \Faust\ was played to a glittering holiday audi- ence. Helen Jepson as \Marguerite\ was unusually good. She adapted her voice to the entirely different emotional role of a naive maiden in the \Jewel Song,\ of an ardent lover in the garden scene and of a br.oken sinner in the tragic last act. Richard Crooks and EnzicT Pinza were exceptional in the roles of Faust and Mephistopheles. The action of the Student Council to ere- Why not make this endowment a certainty ate a board of censors for The Concordiensis upon which the treasure of the colleg-e can makes us pause in the course of our usual count.

The policies That Mr. Melton possesses a pleasing, not to say a fine voice is not to be denied. But it is no longer enough to surround a voice with an indifferent picture and ex- pect the result to be good. The novelty has been worn off of the talking pictures for five years and productions in the style of 1932 haven't even a museum interest. Hugh Herbert's portrayal of a genial ldeptomaniac provides the only high point of interest in Sing Me A Love Song. The tunes are not bad. Vaudeville The only reaction that this week's vaudeville awoke in me was a desire for several overripe eggs to be used when indicated. The so- called M. C's had a completely cold and nervous show behind them. The only bright spot appeared in the act of Hal Sherman, the dead- pan comic, who is noted for his shuffling dance with the glides around the corners. The supporting cast, in the cur- rent presentation, is go<Jd with the exception. of William Eishop and Vinnie Phillips whose portrayals of Lov Bensey and Sister Bessie are unconvincing. Bisl!o:p is in- clined to deliver his speeches in far too moving and eloquent a manner for a Georgia c!\acker. Other less important features of the Christmas season were the only fair performances of \Aida\ with Mmes. Rethberg and 'Castagna and M. Jagel, and \Cavelleria Rusti- cana\ with Mmes. Rethberg and Petini and Messrs. Rayner (de- but) and Morrelli. Pagliacci, played on the same bill as \Cavalleria Rusticiana,\ was the better with Tibbet, Burke, and Arthur Garron.

A product of Middlebury College a few yean; back, Walter \Duke\ Nelson, im- mediately aroused interest by tak- ing over the J.inesrnen in football and teaching them how to play their positions. Then winter arrived and he was told to take ove1· the coaching of the varsity hocltey sextet. A star player at Middlebury, Nelson had misgivings when he first looked over the candidates because of the lack of veteran material. He had only two lettermen around which to gr·oup a sextet of stickwielders that would give competition to Army, M. I. T., and the rest of the schedule. But this group of new men be- gan to develop under his tutelage and went over to Massachusetts State Wednesday afternoon and tution of many thousands and that Doyle in the guard positions. , the ball cross-court a great deal, team. this past year the Minnesota eleven Trinity's veteran aggregation is however, and Union should not Lambda Chi Alpha (24) G was voted the best in the country.) compo-sed of Kobrosky and Captain have any difficulty in intercepting Thomas ............... 3 However, he should know what he Ferruci, forwards; Nelson, center; several of their passes.

His suggestions include the elimination of professionalism; high scholar- ship standards for athletes; games between colleges that are natuz a! rivals; reduction of gate receipts and expenses; support of endow- ment funds and free student admis- sion to intercollegiate contests.

Thus·, it seems that the big colleges are clamping down, or at least are taking steps in that di- rection--even if such steps are now nothing more than talk. It will be interesting to follow, nevertheless, any action that may be forthcom· ing fr·om the increased fervor on the subject of professionalism in coli ege s.ports.

Griffith in his annual report as president of the Meet Trinity Saturday Away; Coach Leonard Expects Hard Battle Under the guidance of Pete Fisher, the varsity swimming team is working out daily in preparation for the coming meet with Trinity. Coach Leonard takes over the reins of coaihing at 5 o'clock each after- noon and with the assistance of Fisher is fast getting the natators in shape for the swim against the Scarlet. Little is known of the strength of the Rartford mermen. However, if they al'e anywhere near as well~ balanced as they have been in re- cent years, Union will have a tough battle on their hands. Noticeable improvement has tak- en place among the new men on the squad, especially by Derrick, Draper, Boyce, and Dewitt. Satur- day's m-eet will probably find Harry Myers in the diving events. In the dashes Clinton, Kennedy, and Paton are suz-e to get the call with the other men for the trip being chosen from Boyce, Mills, Dewitt, and Hart. '!'he 220 will be taken care of by Captain Faelton and Ken Rein- hardt, the- 400 by Draper and Der- n'ick. The backstroke event will find Ca:ptain Faelton and Ed Moul- ton entered and Gordon, Kyle, and Burd will swim in the breaststroke. Clinton,. Kennedy, Paton, and De- witt will comprise the relay. The abo-ve lineup is merely a ten- tative one and it may be slightly altered before starting time Satur- day. The swimmers will leave Sat- urday moz-ning at eight o'clock with the basketball team. Nels is rather hopeful about the outcome of the game. He says that the team handles the ball well but must switch faster and stick closer to their men. The team as a whole is fait· defensely but very good of- fensively. J. J. s. ----0•---- Freshman Sextet Opens \1' ith Albany Academy Union's Freshman Hockey team opens its season tomorrow after- noon on the Albany Academy rink. Because of the rain that fell all day Thursday, prospects for the game look rather dubious. The freshmen face a very capable opponent in .Al- bany Academy, the latter team having tied for first place in a tournament held at Lake Placid over the holidays. Albany has had three games so far this year to Union's none. The Freshmen have had their share ~f setbacks this season. Sat- urday's game will be the first time that the team has been on a rink. Practice has been held on an open lake becaulSe of the lack of an- other available place. Ineligibility has hit the team very nard, Fisher, Feldman, and Hack, all very good players,. out of the line-up because of low marl•s, which leaves Coach Lawrence with only three substi- tutes: Furman, Chappell, and Bar- ton. The line-up which Art expects to start will consist of Foster Brown, a consistent scoring threat, at center; Gene Finlt and Johnny Cone, both fast skaters and hard shots, at the wings; Bill Nugent and Bob King, the defense men, are good checkers and can be de· pended on to keep Albany busy at all times; Si Briggs, a very com- petent man, will don the goalie pads.

The games scheduled for that week will be revised, and each group will be notified in due time as to the playing date. Watch the Concordiensis for changes. As North College and Sigma Chi are out of the competition other games will be advanced to their dates: Jan. 13 at 8:30--Phi Sigma Delta vs. Alpha Phi Delta--instead of Jan. 26 at 8:30, Jan. 18, 8:30-Delta Phi vs. Phi Gamma Delta instead of Jan. 25 at 8:30.

Captain Fritz Hawley at defense showed well for the Gar'net as did Paul and Orton. Johnson on of- fense and Ingalls in the net showed up well for State. Tomorrow, the Dutchmen again play host to Williams but this time on the ice instead of the gridiron, After Wednesday's game it is hoped that they will have overcome their first game nervous- ness and will give Williams a hot reception that will melt the ice. Nelson's ever present pessimism is still as rampant as ever but if a victory is laid in his lap you won't see him shedding any tear~. Appearances point to a fair•ly suc- cessful season and you'll find him the first one to welcome it. For House Linen Service PHONE 4-3166 American Coat.

Mountebanks Eleet Herbert as Director English Act()I' and Directm· Will Cast \Winterset\ This Weekend The name of Henry Malcolm Seider, '38, has been nominated for inc! usion in the college ar- chives as the first man to pro- test against a Hale House sand- wich. The plaster images, n~ore than a foot high, were retailed widely some years ago, but production stopped when the manufacturer died here. In the meantime, the Idol languish- ed until the up-state alumni made new designs and molds and began production of the new mascots. John B. Dowling, Jr., chairman of the Mountebanks Theatre execu- tive committee, is in favor of a plan whereby members would be elected to the Student Council on the basis of extra-curricular activities rather than by classes, as at pre_sent. \Functional representatiOn would give student government, the l~fe and purpose it now lacks, he sa1~. \Under such a system extra-curri- cular activities would be more closely knit and it seems the logical basis for a governing body which must also control the financial des- tinies of activities.\ Freshmen Rules Concert to Be Presented By Christian Association The Union College Christian Association has cordially invited the Student Body to an hour of· chamber music in Silliman Hall at 10 p. m. on Wednesday evening, January 13.

Schenectady impossible. He will con duct tryouts for the' play definitely this weekend. Sunday night, seated at the table in Hale House, Seider showed lit tie trace of the fact that he was about to shake the foundations of the college ali- mentary organization. In a calm, unhurried voice, he told the waiter, \Bring me a let- tuce and tomato sandwich and leave out the third and sup- erfluous piece of toast.\ It was a shaken a.nd con- fused waiter who brought the tidings to Julius J. Bundgus, '38, the sandwich man, but Bundgus, a sturdy soul, was adaman.t. George P. Haskell, cheer leader and former exchange student to St. Andrew's who made yesterday's motion to investigate the entire abolition of freshman rules, said, \I think it's a pretty good set of recommendations.

Those groups ag1·eeing to the terms of the plan will buy their supplies from the designated firms only, except in the case of previ- ously madE' rontrar-ts. Monthly bills must be paid tt>n days after being presented. Daily orders received at a specified time, will be deliv- ered on a regular schedule. The agreement is not to be pel'- manent until a trial period of one month has ended. It may be bro- ken at any time if found unsatis- factoz·y.

Opinion Aroused Hy N.S. F. A. Recommendation PRICE FIVE CENTS Larrabee Reveals Mystery of Ramee In Chapel Speech ·Explains Circumstances of How Frenchman Happened To Come to Old Dorp \Anthony Adverse\ Ci.ted College Planner Brought to Schenectady by Parish, Research Shows Tuesday, Jan. 12.-How a tale.nt- ~d Frenchman who was a leading architect in Hamburg and Copen- hagen in 1810 happened to come to America and to design in Schenec- tady the first unified college plan ~anied out in this country was re- vealed by Professor Harold A. Lar- rabee today in daily assembly. The man was Joseph Jacques Ramee, who had fled from Paris in 1792 to settle in Northern Germany; and the college whose campus he laid out was Union under the all- time long-distance p.z esidency of Dr. Eliphalet Not!, which had be- gun in 1804. It had long been known that Union's graceful older buildings were the work of Ramee; but ho whe happened to come to America and to Schenectady had been a mystery. I~esembiPs Novel It appears that the man who brought him was a character in Anthony Adverse, or more exactly, 1. person whose life suggested a ~haracter in that famous novel, namely David Parish. The real David Parish was the favorite son :>f John Parish, a wealthy Scotch merchant operating in Hamburg, who made several millions in a lifetime of adventurous trading with the American rebels, and who became the first American consul J.t the port of Hamburg. The David Parish of Mr. Allen's novel is nine- enths f.ictional. The factuals one- tenth consists of his reason for ~oming to America <the actual date was 1806), which was to manage 1 vast banking and shipping tran- oaction by which Spanish gold from Mexico was tuz·ncd into goods 1.nd transferred to Euz·ope for Tal- leyrand. This 1 isky trading netted him one million dollars in personal pzofits, a large part of which he pzoc<><>dPd to invest in wild f01e~t lands along the St. Lawrence River in northern New York. Most of them he purchased from Gouver- neur Morris, who had returned from his ambassadorship in Paris to become agent for the Antwerp Land Company. In 1809, Parish bought th<' village uf Ogdcm;burg fm· $8,000: and by the end of that Y<''ll hi~ pur chase:; of land amount- ed to $363,000 at a top price of around $2.00 per acre. Views Estates !n IXOR he rode on hor:;<'back to the north country to inspect his new and almost entirely undevel- oped estates, making extensive plans for new villages, a fine resi- dence at Ogdensburg £today the Remington Museum), a summer placP at Parbhnlle. ttw hlllldm~ of shzps, mill,;, churchc:<, and the opening of izon mines and of the whole region generally as a sort of feudal barony. In 1810 he re- turned to Europe; but he came back again in 1811 to Philadelphia, this time bringing with him Ramee qnd his family as architect and town-planner for his new proper- ties. Ramee arrived in Ogdensburg in October 1812, finding it a mere hamlet of a few dozen houses sur- rounded by impassible forests, and momentarily expecting a British attack. One of his first tasks in America was the designing of a fort for the defense of the town. Ramee's worlt as architect in the St. Lawrence region seems to have been confined to interior decorat- ing in the Parish mansion, and a plan for the landscaping, and per- haps the house, on Waddington Island owned by the Ogden family. He also introduced Russian stoves, which became very popular; and took an active part in the social life of the local aristocracy. Early in January, 1813, David Parish and Ramee Jpft Ogdensburg on the long journey back to Phil- adelphia by way of the Black River, Utica, Schenectady, and Al- bany.

Roberi Doig Assistants Robert Walter Cad Trahman Tuesday, January 12, 1937 WHY lVIID-TERM TESTS? The feeling· that these midyear tests are unfair is widespread among the student body, and has apparently not met with the full approval of the whole faculty. In the first place the fact that the tests fall on some students and not on others is discrim- natm'\J' and therefore unfair. Why should those students who are taking- non-social study courses be burdened with the respon- sibility of p1·eparing for three hour tests, \Vhile those in the Social Study Division are not? If these e:xaminations are to take place, we would natu.rally think that the COUl'Ses would be marked on a semester basis, but this is not to be the case. And the only justi- fication for having tests in the middle of the year would be to divide the responsibility of a year's com·se into two parts, unless the authorities wen seeking to punish the in- digent students.. And in the second place few if any of the courses have progressed suffi- ciently to enable the professors to giv.e fair and comprehensive test of any sort.

A LETTER FROM DR. RICHMOND In response to a telegram to Dr. Richmond he replied with the following letter, which we reprint here that it receive the attention of the whole student body to whom in spirit it is addressed: \I greatly appreciate the kind message with the greetings of the Concordiensis: As E look back over my twenty years at Union Colleg-e, among the very happiest of my memories is the pleasure I had in my asso- ciation with the undergraduates, \my boys,\ as I liked to call them. In the larger univer- sities such close !~elations are impossible, and so the president loses the best thing there is in a college president's life. I do not forget that while we wer:e educating the students they were all the time educating the presi~ dent. The friendship of these boys, many of them \old boy.s\ now, I count among the greatest lilessings of my life. The support and coopeeation of The Concordiensis in my time was something- I could always rely upon. I am sure that these friendly tradi- tions are still honored and observed. With every good wish for The Concordiensis and its, editor, believe me.\ Very faithfully, • Charles A. Richmond We must all feel the deep tone of sincerity which it brings us.

MUSIC By LESLIE PAFFRATH When Mischa Levitzki, pianist, appeared last night to fulfill the second concert of the city's Civic Music Association its subscribers accorded him a generous ovatio-n. With a personal concert manner of grace and ease Mr. Levitzki pel\formed a program discreetly chosen from the library of piano composition. It was an exhibition which must have sent Schene-c- tady's embryo Mischas darting homeward to their ke;y:-boards. It was a demonstration which epit-. omized that inerrant coordination of artistic expression with physical. movement so impossible to fathom in the technique of the great ar- tists. It was a technique which was not for a moment mechanized; not in the remarkable militancy achieved in the second movement !Andante con Motol of the Bee- thoven Appasionata Sonata, nor in the legato portions of several oth- er works.

For although souncl think- ing and brave intelligent experi- ment a1·e going forward in the large unde1graduate departments of universities, in there very na- ture there is apt to be an im- personality strangely baffling to a lad who is seeking friendships and guidance as an mdividual .. \It would seem icleal :if a small, histuric, independent college for men. c<Juld be founcl which, stand- ing by itself, was nevertheless in close touch with the conditions of moder11 life and so s1tuated in a college clistt·ict that the1 e were ap- piopHalt: opportunities of vi,;ita- tion back and forth with the stu- d<m£8 of excellent colleges for women.

T'hruugh the windows I can see the beautiful old buildings of the fiht planned college in America, and uthers built in harmony, whe;ze devoted men balance the resp<Jnsibilities of teaching with those of scholarly inquiry, and about these buildings and beyond the college groves and gardens, stretching through our hundred acres.\ MystEry of Jaques Ramee Revealed by Dr. Larrabee c Continued from Page 1) agent Joseph Rosseel, whose papf' Is .al'e now in the museum of St. Lawrence University at Can- ton: \I have left Mr. Ramee at Schenectady where he will be charged with the building of a new college and laying out 70 acres of lands in pleasure grounds for that ln.~ti tution.\ 'The detail<>d plans thus clrawn by a wandel'ing Frenchman 124 years ago we1e realized in part by the builclin.g of Union's North and St>uth Colleges between 1813 and 1R20.

This early defeat of the rc- camped swimming team may be as- cribed to the fact that Trinity had an experienced team and also to the fact that at that institution swimming is a major sport.

While some departments of the college are· strongly in favor of the examina- tions others, a::; evidenced by their failure to use the semester· tests, feel they are not worthwhile. Stu- dent opinion is generally opposed to the mid-year exams except in courses where- the mid-yea.J· test closes the work of the first sem- ester and is rated on an equal ba- sis with the final examination. Outing Club Plans Large Ski Weekend will follow in the gymnasium. Members of the Skidmore club will dine tomorrow evening at var- ious fraternity houses as guests of the Union Glee Club. Following the concert they will be guests at an informal dance In the gymnas- ium. Music for the affair, the only self-supporting money-making ac- tivity of the Glee Club, will be fur- nished by the Garnet Goblins. Ad- mission will be seventy-five cents for couples, fifty cents for individ- uals. Tickets for one dollar will permit a couple to attend both con- cert and dance, Everest announced that the Old Chapel had been secured or the student body meeting or next Wed- nesday night. Wednesday, Jan. 13-Because of the illness of President Rol>ert Everest, the Student Council post- poned its meeting tonight until Wednesday of next week. The re- port on. theN. S. F. A. recommenda- tions will be made at that time. The postponement of the student council meeting has also meant the postponement of the hearings for a new college publication to replace the old Idol. Everest stated that he has received .only one program for a new magazine from a group of students not connEcted with the old Idol board. A program is also ex- pected from the former editors as well as from another student group interested. The new plans will be considered at the next Student Council meeting. More Time Allowed For Semester Fees Cotnptroller Announces That Students Have Thtee Days To Make Payments The Comptroller's Office has an- nounced a change in plans for col- lection of tuition for the second semester which will enable the stu- dents to pay their bills on Wednes- day, Thursday or Friday, February 10, 11 or 12. Heretofore, the under- classmen have been limited to a two,day period in which to pay their bills and the upper-classmen have had a similar limited period. Th.E new plan being tried out thls year will give the stud,ents an extra day in which to pay their bills. The hours of collection will be the same as in past years, that is, from 9:00 to 11:30 in the morning and from 1:1)() to 4:30 in the afternoon. Students who have to pay dormi- tory rents ot repeated course fees will receive especially prepared bills from the Comptroller's Office and it is particularly requested that these original bills be presented by the student when he makes his pay• rnent. Repeated course fees are, in gen- ~ral, paid when the repeated course is being taken. Engineering lec- tures, gymnasium, and library are exceptions to this as the repeated course fees for these subjects are collected in the semester imme- diately following the failure. In soooe instances, students change their plans after the repeated course fee bills have been sent out. In such cases the students should obtain authorization from Dean Garis for having their repeated course fee bills revised. Tuition and student fees will be the same as they were for the first semester-$187.50 for tuition and $5.50 for student fees. College authorities became in- dignant but it was Griswald's \sweetness\ that saved the day and caused the faculty to cool down, But next year, Gl'iswold now only a memory, students re- peated and the faculty thr·eatened. The following semester the ex- chequer decided is was a good thing for the college because he could not dismiss the much-needed 95 leaders of the 180 men enrolled in college. As a result, the Terrace Council was launched and out of Gris- wold's actions Mooving-Up-Day ex- ercises were founded. \Traditions are made by underg-raduates who are not afraid to drop outworn and outmoded actions for new ones,\ Dr·. Waldron advised. T I \I'Y.\ H ryouts or w mterset . To Be Held Monday Night Bruce Adams, recommended by Miss Miriam Doyle and Ed- ward L. Carroll as director for the Mountebanks' production of \Winterset will arrive on the campus Sunday afternoon and will hold the postponed \Win- terset\ tryouts Monday after- noon and night. The change in director and the postponement of the tryouts was made public in a telegram received this morning by graduate manager Milton M. Enzer from Mr. Car- roll. Sin()e Mr. Adams will leave Tuesday there is a possibility that tryouts will also be con- ducted Sunday night. Union Grad Makes Good As Pension Hander-Outer R. G. Parker, the third Spencer Lecturer, who is to be on the cam- pus next Tuesday, is one of those versatile men of whom his college might well be proud. He was grad- uated in 1903, and after working at his profession for several years at the New York General Electric plant he decided to become a banlter which didn't have much connection with engineering. After dealing with banking for several years Mr. Parker entered the field of exporting and importing. As an exporter Mr. Parker seems to have done quite well. His ar- ticles dealing with international trade relations and problems have been printed in many trade jour- nals and daily papers. He became president of the American Export- ers and Importers Association and it seemed for a while that he had at last settled upon a lifework. But then the President o.'k.'d the Social Security Bill and brought about another change in Mr. Parker's career. Now Mr. Parker has gone from exporting and importing to public service by accepting the appoint- ment to the directorship of the 4th district of the Social Security program. Now he seems settled as long as Mr. Roosevelt's Secur- ity Act remains constitutional, Not to be outdone, the story of how Garnet was adopted as the college color, provoded the stu- dents with a share of mirth. Dr. Waldron related the history of how the Union crew earned the right to wear Garnet as its color way back in 1875 when Union and Harvard mutually abandoned ma- genta as their own college color after a bitter fight . ---0>---- Y ..

Among those colleges which will be represented are Mid- dlebury, Dartmouth, Yale, Amherst, Williams, Skidmore, Vassar and Smith. This meet is to be a general get- together of the collegiate outing clubs in which a general good time is planned. There will be skiing on the slopes and trails around North Creek and other winter sports. On Saturday night there will be a square dance in the main cabin. Ski 1'eam Active The ski team of the Outi'ng Club will be most active during the next month with three important meets scheduled. The first of these will be at Norwich, Vt. on January 29 and 30. This will be followed by the Dartmouth Winter Carnival Febru- ary 6 and 7, and the Middlebury ski meet on February 13 and 14. All three of these meets rank as the most important intercollegiate events in the winter sports world. Teams from such colleges as Dart- mouth, Middlebury, Yale and Mc- Gill will participate and competi- tion will be strong. The Union team will be composed of six or eight men, each of whom will be entered In se'veral of the events. The main events will be the down-mountain, slalom, cross coun- try races and jumping. This is the first year that Union has entered the jumping. ' for \variations on a theme.\ The fourth movement is an excellent example of fast counterpoint at its best, with the four instruments in turn chasing each other through the complex contrapuntal passages. The Rice Quartette played this work with gusto and yet with deli- cate shading. Gratitude - or a Woman Repays Us With Quips for a Lesson in News Contrasting themes and intricacy of melody were dominant in the second number of the program, an excerpt from a Tschaikowski Quartette. It was in this work that Edward A. Rice, the leader and first violinist, showed a depth of musical feeling. Outstanding on the p1·ogram was \The Lon ley Shepherd\ by Speaight. This short tone-poem caught the spirit of a forlorn )lerdsman on a lonely plain. Its haunting melody and unusual chords create an eerie effect which was even greater when this number was repeated with mutes as an encore. The quartQtte reached its highest point of perfection in this piece. \Taratella by Schelling, and \Perpetual Motion,\ a musical joke, were short fast numbers which contributed little to the program but variety, for they were neither particularly well playeunor great works in their own right. The popular \Drink to Me Only With Thine Eyes\ was last on the program and left the small but appreciative audience in a warm frame of mind. H. 0. F. Editor's Note: Miss Spellman <not her right name) came into the office last night to learn all about the newspaper busi- ness in one lesson.

He gave a long lecture on the snares and pit-falls of journalism, and then went across the hall to worl' at it. There were others in the of- fice, too, people named Ferguson, Toft, Barry and somebody called Hitch. But they left rather early.

The college physicians are in their offices in the g-ymnasium every day, except Saturday and Sunday, from 4:00 until 5:30 p. m.

Slish-slosh, slap, int()ne the receeding gobs of mud whel'e our footprints had momentarily left theh· vivid im))'ression. Soil encrusted shoes deposit their traces on floors of class rooms, and more noticeably on the spotless tiles of the Hale Jlouse floor. Everywhere can he seen the evide:tftl3 th·at our campus has turned mto a. sea of mud. Last year several new macadam sidewalks were laid down between Bai1ey Hall and the ~lern()rial Chapel and from the Library to the south end of Washburn Hall. This work fell short of what it should have bee11. All the old cinder paths should have been paved o1· raised so that during the wet spells, and they certainly occur frequently and for long enough periods, we could go from build- ing to building without burdening ourselves with clots of the Union campus. 1\loreover, it It happened immediately follow- ing the first performance of \To- bacco, Road\. A delegation from Union was filing out of the theatre when they came upon Guy GI'aves. Mr. Graves introduced them to a Mr. Becker who turned out to be the manager of the \'tobacco Road\ company. \W.ell fellows, how did you like the show\ asked Mr. Becker. \Very good\ replied the llnion- ites. \Now tell me honestly-what did you thin.k of the woman that play- ed Sister Bessie?\ Pause--then scattered: ret<ll:ts. \Not too good\ \pretty-bad\, weak- est in the cast\ \lousy\. \What's wrong with her\ ques- tioned Mr. Beclter. \Gags too .much\ \overa<!ts\, \plays up too much to the audi- ence\ answered the collegiate cr.jtics.

It is with hopeful appreciation that \Ve thank both the Union and Skidmore clubs for what should be a popular yearly event. II. A. E. PROTfX'T t:S FROM COLDS The annual cold rmd cough spell is here ag-ain. Already too m~ny fellows have picked up the obnoxious little germs, and some hav-e even tal<en to bed with the flu, to consider the situation at g-reater length. When the weather is so uncertain and when it is so easy to get our feet wet, we ought to be care- ful. To lose a few days <Jf classes just before mid-term examinations is more serious than we imagine, and when with a little care it could be avoided it seems strikingly futile. l\Tore than this, though, the common cold is dangerous. The complications that arise fmm it run the g-amut of diseases. When our ~esistance is lowered by a cold, we un- bare ourselves to attacll. from all sides. In such conditions we do not have a sufficient number of white corpuscles to combat the invading genus, and we are powerless to re- pulse their ravages. We a1·e most apt at this time to pick up the various types of influ- enza, pneumonia, bronchi~is, grippe, and many other iUnesses. With the presence or these illnesses about .shoes all the time. The administration can do nothing now about fixing the paths other than adding- mon cinders in the low parts where the wate1· :seeks to congregate, but it ought to make some effort so that in the future we will not have to wear water wing.s to get to cla;;ses. And at Other Colleges ... The growing intolerance between the 57 per cent of Jewish children and the 43 per cent C'llristian children at the LINCOLN JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL in Minneapolis was ingeniously solved by a toler- ance movement over· a period of two years under the ~mpervision of Principal William P. Von Levern anu Rabbi David .Aronson. The children jointly helpf'd each other with a Christmas ho!i.fi~~ay pro- gram and a Hanukah festival program this year. Wl1i lr Christ ian youngsters sang \Silen Night,\ Jewi>h studenls hummed the tune. Then the Jewish children sang their \Hatiltvah and the Christian boys a.nd girls did likewise. At least four schools in the South and West have sanctioned the building of trailer colonies where grau ually increasing numbers of college students art> eHhH buying or building their own trallers and parking them adjacent to the halls of their chosen Alma Maters. At UTAH S. A. C. sixteen trailer homE's stand in two orderly rows among the orchard trees.

An endowment campaign begun at SWARTH- MORE: COLLEGE at thE> start of the recent depres- sion was dramatically finished in 1936 when the last dollar of the $4,000,000 pledged was collected. One good way to help struggling college faculty experts to continue researches and publish their results is exemplified by the nineteen research awards which have been made to facultY' members in fourteen fields at WESLEYAN UNIVERSITY, Conn., by the Faculty Committee on research.

What emerges is a drama- tic, memorable film which misses greatness as indefinably as did Anna Rarenina. Winterset is also news on the Union campus for two reasons. The Mountebanks will present the play March 12, 13 and 15, and the man who adapted the sc·reen ver- sion is Anthony Vellier, Union '26, <though he left school before gtad- uation>. Mr Velliet has been laud- ed •by metropolitan critics for the excellence of his work. And, in- deed he does add much to the virtues of the picture by his adap- tation of Anderson's unwieldy blank verse into prose more fitting the characters nf the piece than some of the purple passages of the play. That he has done with taste. But on the other hand he is g-uilty of obscuring the motivation for the meeting and love which arises be- tween Mio and Miriamne; and the occasional cryptic utterances w·hich are only intelligible to a person familiar with the play. Yet he has given the actors and the director good material .vith which to work. In this case, Mr. Santell, has ap- proached his task with intellig-ence and good craftsmanship. He takes the material and the actors and directs them sanely, but with little inspiration. The most obvious cin- ematic devices are employed, pro- sodical sequences for narration; long shot, medium shot. closeup to introduce a scene; and a lament- able overdwelling on closeups at the expense of movement. Likewise, his direction of :Bur- gess Meredith and Margo, fro~n the New York production, is -very straightfOiward. They rise to no heights and reach no depths.

Despite the fact that the Garnet and Wl:Jitoe basketeers are on. a losing streak it must be borne in mind that the previous and fu- ture opponents of the Dutchmen are, for the most .part, first class teams in the basketball world. Col- gate, St. Law·rence, Dartmouth, Columbia, Trinit.y, T<>ronto, and C. C. N.Y. are sore spots on the sched- ule of any basltetball outfit. To date, the Union five ha.s not done so badly as might have been expected. The ineligibility of Grant Smith, first string cente1·, t.ogether with the inability of the entire squad to practice simultaneously has contrib- uted greatly to tiLE wealth of mis- fortune suffered b~ the Dutchmen since the inception o:f the season. The team representing the class of 1940, might also be classed with the varsity squad. Lou Kozlevcar, the star of the yearling five broke his wrist during -vacation and is thus definitely o\Ut of the lineup for the remainder of the season. The schedule of the frosh basketballers is also a source of considerable trouble. Every OJlponent of the yearlings is a definite threat V!ith the Mont Pleasa..nt team expected to be the most tt·oublesome and the R. P. I. five to be the least source of worry. The hockey tea1ns are also vexed by the turn of events. The skater-s, not unlike the skiers of this institu- tion are plaintively calling for weather, cold wea.ther. All hockey games scheduled for last Saturday had to be called o:ff because of the lack of ice. It is suggested that field hockey be sll bstituted for the ice game and that the slalom boys revert to roller ska.ting.-El.

Johnny Schultz will like· wise ·make his usua:l appearance at the guard position. Frankie Myet·s and Arby ·Halpern will be Smith and Doyle. Buffalu's Townsend Buffalo with a creditable per- formance against St. Lawrence to its good record is well-supported by Tiny Townsend, the six-foot eight-inch center who will. make thing~ rather difficult for the in- experienced Wiberley. Townsend is o·nly a sophomore, but he has been the mainstay of the Buffalo quintet this year. The rest of the line.up will probably include Bob Cook and Frank Tuzzulino as guards, and Ivan Le- vine and Chuck Carlson as for- wards. Rochester has even a more im- posing array of players to strike stock Captain Russ Anderson, high scoring ace and clever pas- ser, joined up with veteran sharp- shooting center Bud Spies and ex- pert Jack Mason, Rochester may repeat the terrible lacing the Dutchmen recel·ved at the River campus in 1936. The rest of the Yell ow jacket lineup contains Wes Van Graa- feiland, fot'Ward, and \Goose\ Bantel, a rising star, guard. Jerry Zornow, another veteran, may be out because of an injured ankle. Nevertheless, Coach .Alexander will have good substitutes in E'ddie Mee, Bob Babcock, Lane, and Ger- sbach. again tallied in front of the net on another wild scramble. The frosh visibly slackened their pace after this third goal and contented tl-J.em- selves with the problem of defense against a vengeful series of attacks.

International !· Campus Stars Now Radio Favorites \RENFREW OF THE MOUNTED\ is a chilling thriller for youngsters who like the cops-and• Joan Baker robber game as played in the Canadian Northwest. In r935, Joan Baker's interest in the Canadian North· west was very limited. She . was a member of the Strollers at Ohio State, ctrculatton manager of the Ohio Stater, contributor to the Lantern, and an athlete in women's intra· murals. John Weigei '3 r; was a classmate, working his way through Ohio State as an announcer at a local radio station. They shared in common an en· thusiasm for Ohio State's football team of that year . Now Joan is the heroine of \Renfrew of the Moun· F - ted\ on a national radie hookup and is rescued over and over again. John Weigel has pushed his way forward, too, and is now a Columbia announcer out of the Chicago studios.
