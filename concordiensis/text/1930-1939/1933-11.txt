It is only because of the cooperation of business men and homemakers that the Bureau has been able to place students in odd jobs. Stu.dent Spealters' BtU\eau One of the major plans being evolVed by the b;ulployment .bu- reau is tne creat1on o.t a: l:lt uden t ~peaker·s· J:Sureau. It is planned to get eight or ten well qualltied stu- uents and ol'ter their services as P• ogram speakers to school •. chur~h ~>nd Clvic groups in the uap1tol Dis- trict. 'l'he charge for this service will be within reach of each organ- iza:tion, probably from $3 to $4 plus expenses for the trip. Students in- terested in this kind of work should present themselves to Miss Travt::l with a recommendation from two o1· more pl otesl:lors. 'l'he following placements wcte made by the Bmployment Bureau during the first month: 13 .students were given work for the1r room; 20 students have been given w01k for their meals; 10 boys have been placed on jobs netting a cash r.e- turn · 5 boys have been placed m hom~s where they wm·k in retm-n for both room and board; a:nd 30 students have been given odd jobs. Difficult to Place Students Miss Travis said one of t_he diffi- cult obstacles facing the Employ- ment Bureau is convincing the average employer that college stu- dents are responsible. It seems that the average employer has no fa:ith n the reO'ularity or dependability of the av;rage college student. To effect a change in attitude on the part of such am employer and to increase the responsibility of stu- dents placed, the Employment Bu· ·eau che·cks up on the work of the student, i)Jquiring about his abilit¥, responsibility, and whether he lS generally acceptable. Qther stu- dents are recommended for the po- sition if a student is found to be inadequate. · A file of the students seeking em- ployment and their qualifications ib being kept in the Employment Bu- Teau. This will greatly expedite thP work of placing the right students for the job. ---~o•------ De}egatiOll Outlines League Association Everett Painter to Represent Union On Committee Which Will Plan for the Assembly The delegation to the Model As- sembly of the League of Nations held its first meeting Wednesday In the Semina:r room of the Poli- tical Science department.

GIFTS NOT FREQUENT Income Reduction of 75 Per Cent Since 1929 Decreases Business Men's Generosity ~-------------------------------- versity investments has yet been made. The nearest thing to it that has come my way is a survey made by Wood Struthers and Compa:ny a short time ago covering thirty of our leading universities. While we must bear in mind the possibility th.at the small colleges may be fol lowing an entirely different invest ment pollcy from the universities the figures do nevertheless throw some light on the situation. The largest holder of bonds among the thirty universities has 81.6 per cent of its endowment in this form of investment. The lowest percentage of holdings of this type is 7 per cent, and the next lowest, 12.7 per c~nt, but these cases are unusual Most of the schools have more than 50 per cent of their investments in bonds. The total investment of the thiitJ.· universities in railroad bonds is $87,000,()00, in public utility bonds $95,000,000 and $44,000,000 in indus trial bonds. Foreign bonds with $13,000,000 occupy third from last place on the university schedule Next to last place is held by muni cipal bonds, of which the thirty uni versities have $5,000,000 worth while mortgage bonds occupy last place with a scant $4,000,000. It Is common knowledge that ma:ny small colleges, particularly in the west, have a large part of their money tied up in real estate mort gages, a kind of security which has been hit particularly hard during the present depression .. Very inter e.Jting is the scant enthusi!i:sm for United States Government bonds, of which twenty of the thirty uni- versities have none at all. That it is perfectly possible for a univer sity to function with its money in vested in this kind of bond is shown by the fact that one univer- sity has $16,500,000-more than half of its endowment-in United States securities. The total for all the universities· is but $500,000 more. The total invested in stock was $95,000,000-nea:rly $42,000,000 in pre- ferred stock, and more than $53,- 000,000 in common.

Should this plan be accepted, each student would be allowed nine or ten more chapel absences a semester. To Visit Classes Tuesday- Daily Assembly Speaker, Acting President Ed- wai'd Ellety, \When the Mind Awakens.\ The other plan which Flinn pre- sented to the Student Council pro- vided for meetings in the Old Chapel every other Monday. This . system was suggested because in · that way more business would auto- matically be on hand for discussion for each meeting. The week-end begins of-ficially after registration, and alumni are mvited to visit classes and labora- tories that same afternoon. In the evening there will be a meeting of the Union College Alumni Associa- tion of Schenectady at the Mohawk Golf Club. All alumni are cordially invited to attend.

Dinner will be served at 6:30 o'clock. The members of the Association will be hosts to the officers of the College, the Executive Committee of the Gradua:te Council, and many alumni who are to return for the week-end. Acting-President Ellery has con- sented to speak on matters of in- terest to the College and the Asso- ciation. Mr. Walter C. Baker, '15, trustee of Union College, and Mr. J'ames E. Finegan '02 wil also speak. Edgar Z. Moulton, the holder of the 1933 scholarship of the Association, will be present a:t the meeting, and will have charge of the musical part of the program, including the singing of severa,l college songs.

Under this plan, Robert North, president of the class, Guy Gris- wold and Chester DiLallo auto- matically become members of the Sophomore Discipline Committee. The other two members of the com- mittee will be chosen ·in the near future.

Athletically Dain has been most active. In his freshman year he played quarter back on the football tea:m and was a member of the basketball squad. Last year he won his varsity U in football and baf'!eball. This fall Dain was elected Vice-president of the Junlor class. Education and Business The figures clearly indicate that higher education in America has a big stake in business. It is too early yet for a comprehensive sur- vey of the movement of income in American industry since 1929, but according to figures compiled by the Federal Reserve Boa:rd the de- cline in gross income -of railroad has amounted to 50 per cent, of agriculture to 56 per cent, and of construction to 76 per cent. It is v:ell to remember thflt whatever dividends there are at the present time they are being paid largely out of surpluses. Now it is mathe- tTtatically impossible for this to keep up indefinitely. And when these surpluses become <>Xhausted, restoration must take place before dividend payments of any signifi- cance can begin again. Furthermore, although most \big busincsl:l men\ acted the fool (like ne.uly everyone e!:;e) during the golden era of pro;pcrity, and al- thuugh ll. complete cure has duubt- leB<> not been effected, there is no lJUe<;tion that the present depres- sion is having a very sobering ef- fect upon that class. It has been too long and too severe to be easily forgotten. For some time, at least, even after recovery Is definitely here, the American business man is going to be a very cautious crea- ture. This is going to affect divi- dend payments greatly for the atti- tude that \there are lots more where these came from\ will have given place to a strong desire to hold extra money for the business \in case we have anuther deprel:l- sion like the last one.\ Also it lllaY lead to a smaller income out of which dividends can be paid. A kind of daring venturesomeness, something different from mere recklcs;;ness yet partaking of that quality, seems to be necessary for rapid economic advancement, and such venturesomeness Is going to be largely lacking for a number of years to come. Finally there is the fact tha:t as yet we have no clear· evidence that recovery is under way, and that even after recovery definitely starts, it is going to be a long rough road to prosperity and diyidend payments. Dr. Wesley C. Mitchell, who as chairman of the President's Research Committee on Social Trends submitted its exhaus- tive report, stated that one of the conclusions implicit in the commit- tee's findings was that emergence from the depression now in Its fourth year was bound to be slow. \Recovery is delayed because of (Continued on Page 4)

Four Cummins Discusses Effect Of Economy On Cul'l'iculum (Continued from PagP. 1) the delay in readjusting the private debt stru-cture, principally the long- term structure which was connect- ed with the real estate boom,\ he said. \It is a much slower matter than the liquidation of a bo0m in merchandise.\ Another major source of income f0r private endowed colleges is gifts. PracticaHy everything that has been said concerning income from investments applies with equal force to this type of income. T!1ere is nothing to cause pleased surprise in the Federal income ta:x return for the past year. Individ- ual net income in the calendar year 1931 amounted to $13,231,352,042 as compared with $17,220,753,620 in 1930 an:d $25,226,326,912 in 1929. For the year 1931 only 75 individ1:1als made returns of a million dollars or over tota:J.ing $102,997,603 as compared with 149 individuals and $359,904,655 tota !income in 1930 and 513 individuals and $1,212,098, 784 in 1929. Almost any class can be taken with appreximately the same result. For example, the returns for individuals receiving incomes from $100,000 to $1:50,000 show Ill THE OONCORD!ENSIS, FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 3, 1933 total of $195,011,429 for 1931 as com- pared with a total of $374,170,634 in 1930 and $770,536,078 in 1929, a decrease of abom; 75 per cent from 1929 to 1931. Corporate income re- turns show somewhat the same kind of picture. There were 493,293 returns filed for 1931, of which 170,683 showed net income and 296,- 704 showed no net income. The total net income revealed wa:s $3,- ures' for the worst year of the de- pression, 1932, aore not yet available. They will undoubtedly be even more striking.

Maude Adams, Florence Fogler Are Only Women To Get Union Degrees By VEDDER M. GILBERT In the recent years Union College has conferred two degrees upon women. Maude Adams was the first woman to be granted a degree by Union College. In 1921 the college bestowed upon the great actress an honorary degree of Master of Arts for her splendid histrionic abilities and her work done in the develop- ment of lighting effects for motion . pictures. Miss Ada:ms l).ppeared ir the role of Portia in Schenectady two years ago. The second degree to go to a woman was given in 1925 when Mrs. Bruce Buckland, nee Florence Fogler, earned her degree in elec- trical engineering. In 1920 Mrs. Buckland graduated from the· Massac'lusetts Institute of Technology. Following her studies there she came to Schenectady and obtained a position in the turbine department of the General Electric Company. In her spare time Mrs. Buckland pursued her courses at Union. Her scholastic record shows a second grade average, and on it is a note from Dr. Ernst J. Be1g saying that Mrs. Buckland did ex- cellent work. The day after she received her degree Florence Fogler married Mr. Bruce Buckland of the General Electric Company. Mrs. Buckland, one of the few great women mathE>- matieians, continued to hold her position with the company. When her first child was born, she re- signed. Since that .time Mrs. Buck- land has entirely given up her pro- fession and has become an ardent housekeeper deyoting herself to her son and daughtel\. The Bucklands reside at 1711 Randolph road, Schenectady. She is an active member of the League of Women Voters, and finds a great deal of enjoyment in the playing of contract bridge which she plays· ex- cellently as shown in her success in several local bridge tournaments.

The third team, better known a.s the scrubs, work just as hard as the first team, but g-et less attention from the coaches, do not go on trips, and, in short, are never heard of off the practice field.

MUSIC by Rankine Hinman There is excellent balance in the program which the Glee Club will offer Saturday evening in its first appearance of the season. The mag- nificent dignity and power of Pro- thero's \Laudamus\ and Cesar Franck's setting of the One Hun- dred Fiftieth Psalm are in marked contrast with the delicate senti- ments expressed in Purcell's lovely · arrangement of the English lyric, \Passing By,\ or in \The Best of Rooms,\ the words of which were written by Robert Henrick. The gaiety which is properly ex- pected on a college glee club pro- gram will be furnished by Yon's recruiting song, \Why Don't You Try?\ and .\Shortnin' Bread.'' a neg1·o fo.k tune which bas recently gained wide popularity by its clever words, syncopated rhythms, and lively tempo, \Why Don't You Try\ is equally effective with its vivacity, its carefree levity which in one pas- sage breaks into delightful imita- tion of a flute, and in another into a banjo-like vocal accompaniment. prompted several students to accept mem- take them too. course for B grades, depending on • ·a sonorous voice and the urba:nity • ERIE-Tonight and tomorrow. bership in Pi D('lta Epsilon, so-called na- A regular gets injured; everybody knows of their expression.

Basketball Squad Holds Scrimmages Nitchman Holds Scrimmages Daily in Developing Men Into Fast Moving Teams The second week of varsity bas- ketball practice was instituted yes- terday afternoon with an intensive drill in shooting and passing, fol- lowed by a. series of scrimmages between the tentative first, second, thil d and fourth squads. Coach Nelson Nitchman paid attention especially to the quality of passing displayed in the practice tilts, and interrupted the play several times to point out the vatious errors. The first tea:m consisted of Clem Smith, center; Ray McDowell and Sam Jackson, forwards; Puree Dow and Jack Moffett, guards. The per- formance of this group was quite ragged, the only redeeming feature being the offensive work of Moffett. The slender junior has acquired an assurance in handling the ball, which, together with his native ability, has made him a formidable candidate for a varsity starting betth. During the practice sef'sion he made several fine shots within ~lose range of the hoop. The wor!{ of the other men seemed to indi- cate that none of them have yet hit theil• stride. 1 Ka7.mierezak, U ............... ~1:-!U Gott,;cllall{, U ................. 31:40 3 :-.:estlc, U ...................... 3~:0ll 4 :Y.Iirate, U ..................... 32:30 5 Basteclo, U .................... 32:·11 Broclnvehl, U ................. 32:41 7 Ho<'l,berg, l'. e. :--;, Y ......... 3~:~1 8 Oevelin, C.

Has Varsity Swimming Squad Learning Fundamentals in Preparation for First Meet For the past ten days members of the swimming squad have been performing calisthenics beneficial to the strengthening of muscles used in swimming and diving. Practice will start in earnest to- day. Coach Leonard will attend every day from four to five-thirty. He will first finish the conditioning of his men .. Some time will be spent on the proper breathing to be used in the water. After tllis, the use of the arms and legs v..ill be stressed by the coach, both singly and in unison. When this difficulty has been overcome, the .method of turn- ing will be dealt with. This feature will be especially important as much time may be gained or lost in turning. Following these detailed instruc- tions, speed and form on the start will be developed. Coach Leonard will particularly correct and im- prove the form and style of the swimmers while in the water. Season Looks Bl'ight Last year's team had a fair sea- son winning half of their eight meets. With most of this team re- turning and many promising sopho- mores, Coach Leonard declared, \Our team should prove itself cap- able of winning meets and will doubtless have a more successful season than last year.\ The team, led by Captain Neese, will open its season shortly after the Christmas vacation, probably in the first part of January. Neese, Joe Maney, Bob Oppen- heim, and Gus Brown, all ho!ders of records, here and in other pools, will be on the team again. Brown returns after an absence of one .year due to illness. Recently his record swim at Colgate in the baclc- strolte, was declared official, and he now holds the pool record in the 200 yard backstroke. Other men who will partalte in the meets are \Boom\ Schuman, diver; Maus Sterns, distance; Keene, diver; Griffing, sprints; Squires, back- stroke; Burg, breaststroke; Bridge- man, Flinn, Leake and Griswold. a falr degree of success the fast brea:k on the offensive, emphasized by Coach NJtchman. Both teams were woefully weak in their shoot- ing, missing numerous push-ups and pot-shots.

l<'our 'New Way N,eeded' Declares Hulbert Speaker AdYises Students to Use the Scientific Method In Their Search for Truth \The great need of today is to find the way of life,\ said Dr. Gus- tavus A. Hulbert, pastor of the Brown Memorial Presbyterian Church of Baltimore, Md., m hi:; address Sunday in the weekly serv- ices at the Memorial Chapel. Dr. Hulbert outlined seve1 al steps which must be taken if the world is to come out of its present economic conditions. Upset Machinery of Life Speaking to the young men of to- day, he said: \My generation made the world of today. We upset the machinery of life. The p1 esent geu- eration is responsible for the world of today. It is not an act of God, or a cycle of history. With no regard to the consequences we must seek the truth today or we are doomed. False leadership and trickery have set the world in the rocks. \There isn't an in::;titution in the world today that is not challenged. The stock of manhood has been steadily going up when all other stuck~ have been going down. We are asking for bigger men; we are short of leadership. A leader in the future must be mole than a poli- tician. He must be a man with in- tegrity and insist that all that is low shall be wiped out :;o that it will not fall upon another genera- tion. Scientific Method for Truth \Follow your scientific method for truth. From now on we shall never believe that a nation is a~ strong a,; it::> wealth; it is only as :;trong as its soul. Political Jpaders are not stronger than their souls. Do not be afraid of the ::;cientific method; know its method. Our conscience has not developed in proportion to our science. When a man has a con;;cience he under:;tando and obey::> the law:; of his countiy. \Today we have lost our good taste, but it will come bac!<. Use your good rea:;on, and think straight, and don't forget your re- ligion, the most fundamental thing in human life. It has risen higher in the world than anything else.\ ASSOCIATE EDITORS OF '1.935 GARNET Duncan McNab, editor-in-chief of The Garnet, announced yes- terday that the following mem- ber·s of the junior class have been appointed associate editors of the 1935 Garnet: WHiiam Waldron, Alpha Delta Phi; Michael Blase, Alpha Phi Delta; Jerome Ros- en, Alpha Mu Sigma; Stanley Mower, Beta Theta Pi; Clem- · en:; Hathaway, Chi Psi; Rudolph Stroebel, Delta Chi;_ Robert Pur- chase, Delta Phi; .Frank Chon- sld, Delta Pi Nu; Donald Moul- ton, Delta Upsilon; Edwin Hutchins, Kappa Alpha; Joseph Woolman, Kappa Nu; William Wilson, Kappa Sigma; Raymond MacDowell, Lambda ·Chi Alpha; John Moffett, Phi Delta Theta; George Elmendorf, Phi Gamma Delta; Richard Diamond, Phi Sigma Delta; Hugh Elwyn, Phi Sigma Kappa; Wilkinson Cory, Psi Upsilon; John Finch, ,Sigma Chi; Norman Hess, Sigma Phi; Alton West, Theta Delta Chi; Byron Phelps, Theta Nu Epsi- lon; William Kwiatkowsky, Key and Blade; William Leahy, Pyr- amid Club; John Kuttler and James Dickson, Neutrals.

Washington to Demand Assur- ances of No Red Propaganda If Concessions Are Made · RUSSIAN DEBT LARGE Litvinoff Expected to Propose Payments of Old Claims by Large Purchases of Imparts By LESLIE R. LONG The invitation recently extended by President Roosevelt to the Rus- sian Government for a conference ha:s been widely interpreted as a step toward a resumption of diplo- matic relations, The possibility of two peoples, one numbering 125 million and the other 160 million, resuming such relations is a matter of great importance. The domestic situation both in the United States and in Russi:'\ a;~ well as the prob- lem of international relations throughout the world make it a matter of even greater importance. For fifteen years the SovJet Gov- ernment has run Russia. Appar- ently the United States has just discovered that fact. The absence of official relations with Russia ha:s resulted in an abnormal and un- satisfactory situation although it has not prevented business activ- ities in Russia by American citizens who have been willing to carry them on without asking their gov- ernment to assume any responsibil- ity in their behalf. Obviously it would be better to have entirely normal relations between this coun- try and Russia-the chief objection to it has been the intimate rela- tions known to exist between the Russian: Government and the Third Internationale, a Communist party, avowedly devoted to revolutionary purposes. Full diplomatic relations have the effed of giving the repre- sentatives of a foreign government a prJvileged status, which obvious- ly an enemy may abuse. Roosevelt Desires Recognition However, it seems safe to assume that Mr. Roosevelt desires to ar- range a basis for recognition. In fact, we have, in taking part in in- ternational conferences with it, rec- ognized the Russian Government as de facto even th.1ugh we have not made the formal step. There Js little doubt that today we stand on the threshold of full recognition. It would be very difficult for {)Ur gov- ernment not to take that step and doubly embarrassing for M. Lltvin- off to return home without having 8lCcomplished that mission. Whatever other cortcoosions are made by Washington, the Ameri<Jan Government will not stand f{)r CommunJ.st propaganda in this country financed by the Third In- ternationale of Moscow. Perhaps the Commissar for Foreign Affairs Is ready to give assurances on that score. In fact Moscow has, in re- cent years, greatly curtailed its activity abroad for a world revolu- tion and has directed its energies toward internal development and stability. Then too, the Third In.- ternationale is not what it was ten years ago. But the American Gov- ernment should and must have ab- solute assurance that there will be no more of this sort of anti-capital- istic activity.

Collection Worth $25,000 The library of Judge Cullen, like that of his brother's now in the Union lil>rary, are beautifully bound in leather, morocco, or calf, with fine tooling. The cost of such bind- mgs today would be from ten to fif- ty dollars per volume. From certain markings in the books, and from the former owners' bookplates, it is evident that the Judge was a buyer at auctions. A conservative estimate of the value of the new addition to the Cuiien library by James Brew- ster, college librarian, is placed at \at least $25,000, even in this day of deflated values.\ The collection is mainly history, biology, general literature and some poetry but not a single work on sci- ence. There are many limited edi- tions of the standard authors like Poe (10 volumes), Byron (6 vol- umes), Cooper (32 volumes), Dick- ens (21 volumes), Fielding (15 vol- umes), Dryden <5 volumes), to name a few at random. Some of these are duplicates but library edi- tions cannot be compared with these beautiful editions. :Riogr<~,plty Prominent In history there are the usual sets of Parkman, Hallam, Rhodes, Carlyle, Guizot, Mommsen, and al- so the rarer Trevelyan, Lecky, Merivale, Curran, Lingard, and Na• pier. Biography is prominent in the gift, some of the titles of which (Continued <Jn Page 3) Dr. Edward Ellery, acting president, at the Alumni lunchoon at noon today made public the \Union College Plan for the Intellectual Advancement of Youth,\ as the climax of th an~ual college week-end festivities for the returning alumm. ~r. ~llery merely gave. t~e general summary of the plan and d1stnbuted charts outlmmg the organization of the col- lege under the new plan that will go into effect next Sep- tember..

Reason for Student Meeting Explained Acting President Ellery Says That Personal Discussion Will Help Understanding \My reason,\ stated Acting Pres- ident Edward Ellery in an inter- view with a Con()ordiensis repol'ter yesterday, \for h<>lding the Student Body Meeting Monday in Memorial Chapel is to present in person the Union College Plan for the Ad- vancement of Youth. As this plan involves the undergraduates, I wish them to be acquainted with it first. \By delivering the text of the scheme to the students personally and by answering quest<ons, I be- lieve the plan will be more fully understood. Phases of the idea which seem vagufl after reading the accompanying article in The Con- cordiensis will, perhaps, be mDre clearly discernible when delivered orally.\ Dr. Elleiy placed particular em- phasis on his desire that the entire student body parta·ke in the move- ment. As the plan concerns the class entering next year, as well as the present under~raduates, he wishes the students to aid in the success of the project by vii tually becoming \advertising agents for the college.\ According to Dr. Ellery, unani- mous attendance on the part of the students will be beneficial to their welfSJre, to next year's class, to the college, and to the eventual success of the Union Plan for Advance- ment ot Youth. In stressing the need for attend- ance at the meeting Monday, Dr. Ellery concluded the interview by stating, \If the students will attend this meeting I may never ask them to attend another-but I won't promise it!\ The five point plan )las been adopted following a year's survey of the educational practices of col- leges in the United States and the experience and results of Union's own educational organization dur- ing her 138 years. Dr. Ellery's announcement de- clared that Union's experience clearly indicates that the normal bo¥ of 1? or 17 usually shows pro- fiCiency m at least one subject of study. Union College, therefore proposes hereafter to admit and to place them in a curriculum on the basis of proficiency as exhibited in secondary school. Subjects in Four Divisions For this purpose subjects of ~tudy in ~h~ .college w.ill be. grouped m four diVISIOns: engmeenng (civil and electrical); language and liter- ature (English, French, German Greek and Latin); mathematic~ and science (biol.ogy, chemistry, geology, mathematics, physics and psych:>logy); and social studies (economics, history, political sci- ence, philosophy and religion). Each division will be presided over by one of the professors of the colleg-e and associated with him in the work of the division will be a group of professors in charge of particular fields of study. For admission into a curriculum in one of these divisions, fifteen units of secondary school work will be a pre-requisite. Three of these units will have tv be in English; the remaining twelve may ·be made up from subjects which the appli- cant win have pursued in school. In other words, the college wiii no longer demand· that secondary schools train their students in some special way to qualify them for entrance. Adapt Cuniculum tG the Boy Union College will henceforth adapt its curriculum to each boy admitted\. The division in which the boy will begin his college work will be determined by the school record.

Dr. Nott went back, picked up the snake, removed its splints, and since the creature nest.led af- fectionately by his side Dr. Nott adopted the snake, domesticated and made it a: pet. Eleven of a d<Jzen Union Alumni attended the opening meeting of the year last week in Richardson Hall, which houses the St. Lawrence University law school. James Fine- ga:n, third of Union's clan of five Finegans, was prev':lnted from at- tending through business and scho- lastic pressure. The repudiated Russian debt totals 750 miiiion, about half of which is an obligation to the Amer- Ican Government and the balance, a debt to private American investors. If this governmental debt of Eus- sia is handled on the same basis as the war debt of our allies, it should nDt be a burdensome task for Rus- sia to pay on the same ratio as our collections from Britain or France are made.

The Mountebanks will produce Maurice Maeterlinck's play \The Intruder.\ The beloved Dr. Nott, who was as renowned for his tenderness and breadth of sympathy as he was for his ideals for education, was in the habit of making extensive trips in search of geological specimens, freshmen and scenery. On one of his trips he chanced to pass through· a sparsely populated sec- tion of South America. One of the wheels of his famous three-wheeled carriage, in which he was journey- ing, passed over a sleeping rattle- snake. The poor creature writhed in agony. The doctor's heart was touched, he stopped, got out, and with his rare surgical ski11 dressed the wound and placed the snake irt splints. A week or so later the great edu- cator happened to pass by the same way. As he jogged along in his chariot he glanced back at the road. A bandaged reptile was following Our inventing president allowed his strange pet to sleep under the covers at the foot of his bed. Peo- ple are apt to frown upon such a habit. The good doctor, however, advocated the practice after the night a burglar broke into his room. The noise of the intrud!er awakened him. Before Dr. Nott stood a masked figure, in the win- d<>W the rattlesnake was poised in a position for striking, its tail hung out the window. The creature rat- tled its tail, and attracted a pollee- man who ha:ndled the situation ad- mirably, When Dr. Nott's pet died a photo- graph was made of it. The photo inspired the familiar cut which ap- pears on the coiiege emblem. And that is how \the doctor chose to immortalize 111s faithful pet. Professor Edwin W.

Cory, Jr. A GREAT STEP FORWARD (Continued from page 1) In the second place, the new plan is certain to interest a number of desirable students in Union College who have never before con- sidered this institution as a place to mati·ic- ulate from secondary schools. Union College now offers a candidate the opportunity to come here and engage in the work that is to his liking. Consequently, a large portion of the \carpetbaggers \brief case carriers,\ or call them what you will should be elimin- ated from the underg-raduate body. These students do not know that th.ere is any- thing more to our Alma Mater than the class room. They are not the sort that makes up a strong Student Body. Now, with the new plan in force, many more vital, interesting, many-sided young men will come here for their education. Everybody hates unnecessary restriction. Even college freshmen chafe under the defin- itely laid out courses of study which they must follow at present. With everyone do- ing what he likes best, a more healthy at- mosphere will be created. Our spirit, which has not been too good for the past year is bound to improve with the raising of the morale of the students. The new plan will not make Union College the home of \snnp courses.\ Just as much wotk is required afl in the pa::\t to be admit\ ted. The only chang-e is that a student can no\v follow his natural inclinations. The committee which has \vorked out this plan has been studying the situation for many months. The members should be con- gratulated for the fine piece of work which they have done. GEORGE R. CORY, JR., '34 IT'S GOOD TO S.EE YOU AGAIN We are always glad to have the oppor- tunity to welcome our alumni to the campus, and especially on week-ends set aside for that purpose. When you alumni were under- graduates, you, too, entertained your prede- cessors in a manner similar to that which the present student body of Union is trying to make your brief visit here pleasant. The various agencies of the undergraduate body have spent several weeks in preparing a program for your ultimate satisfaction. The varsity football team has spent two months in daily practice session.'3, not, of procured. At tomorrow morning's devo- Lional services in the Memorial Chapel you will have the opportunity to hear a fine speaker in the person of Dr. Percy G. Kam- merer of the Avon Old Farms School. If you enjoy the program that has been 1 H'epared for you as much as the students have enjoy.ed preparing -it, the week-end can '1ardly fall short of being a success. It is the purpose of the undergraduate body to keep the alumni inter.ested in the college and we hope that the current week-end will seTve .o strengthen the already strong bonds of union between the two factions concerned PLENTY OF MATERIAL The opinion that prevails at JJresent that there is little or no worthwhile discussion in Student Body meetings is perfectly true. The next question that naturally arises is whose fault is it that there is not much busi- ness brought up at these gatherings. The answer is not so easy, but if the Student Council would appoint a committee to pre- pare legislation for the Student Body meet- ings in advance the question would be solved. The Concordiensis has r-epeatedly brought up certain questions, some of which are quite important. Most of our suggestions have been ignored. It is not the idea of the edi- tors of this paper to run student affairs. I.t is our duty to investigate problems that may arise, and reflect undergraduate opinion con- cerning them in our columns.

IGNOTUS GRAY SUNSET Man, who calls himself the son of God, is the only known animal who engages in the organized destruc tion of his own species. He is a creature of instinct, impulse and emotion, and is a:ltogether impa tient with rea'Son. He disregards the lessons of the past and blun ders clumsily a]f)ng through his stupid existence to death and ex tinction. Fol' fifteen years he has been celebrating an armistice-a truce, not a peace. That armistice is ·symbolic of a great lesson, but man has turned a deafened ear. He prefers to rush blindly into the red hell Of war. Dread war, the murderer of youth, is a state of lunacy which transforms the world into a can cerous mass of filth. Strewn across the \field of honor\ are rotting corpses· which stinlt to high heaven --these the men \whose names shall live forever.\ It is this oomn able sentimentality about war which ca11s the young to die, w):Lich makes peac,J impossible, It is \honorable\ for men to hate, to torture, to kill and to be killed. The truth is, however, that men go into action well knowing that some of their number will die. But they think, they hope, they pray that death will not come to them selves but to some of their \bud dies.\ Man will take the risk of death gladly but to face the cer tainty of death is quite a different matter. Yet we call a hero one who, though longing for life, a:c cepts death of his own win. How many heroes are we comm·e·mor ating this armistice day? War is something of man's own contrivance. He can renounce it just as he has made it. But he never will. The generation which can boast of its loyal sons who freely gave their all \to end war\ has stepped aside andi we today must carry on their weird song of pr'!.ise t<> the heroic dead, Many of us now P,ere at Union will s·omeday lt.ill our fellows on the '~field of honor\ and some of us will lie in the mud among the worms and rot. And out of our dead hulks will spring a name which will be im m<>rtalized. And the fools that are born tomorr(}w will lift up their voices in song and we will Jlve. This is honor. -LESLIE R.

Groesbeck to Head Cast of Production Markman Also Has Import- ant Role in \The Intruder;\ Made the Lighting Effects The graduate council will pre· sent the Mounte·banks and the Glee Club in their :fifth annual produc- tion for returning alumni and friends of the college tonight in the Mountebanks' theatre an the campus at 8:30 o'clock. The Moun- tebanks will present Maurice Maet- erlinck's play, \The Intruder\ and the Glee Club will offer t·hree groups of songs under the direction of Dr. Elmer A. Tidmarsh. An Atm{)spheric Study The Maeterlinck piece Is an un- usual atmospheric study of the ap- proach of death Into a family. Di· rector Edward L. Carroll has achieved an unusual eff·ect by combining lighting and scenic ef· fects with the movement of the play in such a manner that the chief character, the bllno, sensitive gt<!mlfatll€r, will doll.linate the play despite the fact that he has llttle action to perform. Sidney D. Markman, of Brooklyn, who plays the part of the dominating but easily excited uncle, has designed and executed the sets. John E. White, Jr., has executed the light· ing design of Mr. Carroll. Roylance Has Part Harvey P Groesbeck of Schenac- tady will play the lead role of the nervous olo grandfather who is sensitive to death's appr<>ach to his house. Frank Dean Roylance of La Grangeville, has the difficult role of the anxious, restless father whose wife is dying after child- birth. Ferdinand Helm, Jr., and Robert J. McManus, and Thomas Ordway, Jr., play the parts of the small youthful, anxious daug·hters. Milton Schwebel has the part of the servant, and William H. Mit- chell is cast in the part of the sis- ter of mercy. The Glee Club under the leader- ship of Dr. Tidmarsh and Herbert ;F. Hausser, student leader, wlll sing a group of religious songs, a group of popular folk songs, and a group of college songs. There will be 45 voices in the Glee Club which will be accompanied by Charles Reid. Protheroe's \Lauda- mus,\ Jacques Wolfe's· \Short'nln' Bread\ and \the College on the Hill\ are examples of each group. ADDITION TO DEAN'S LIST The name of J. E. White, Jr. of . the Class of 1935 has been ad<led to the Dean's List for the second semester of last year. Mr. White's name was omitted from the orlg- .inal because of an error in the re-. port handed in at the Dean's Office. @ 1933, LIGG!m' lk M\'EU Tol!M:Co CO, :xes, .a .tragedy,\ London, 1699.

One ot these social insti-tution;> h; the trade union. To understand the trud\ un- ion the student must under:;t:md its' origins. This is called Hi~tmy. Also, the student must imow the relation of thes\ unions to the state; he must know that in Amer- ica, a member of a union is liable for damage committed by the or- ganization, while in England he i~ not. This study is called Political Science. The student must know that one of the chief aims of the trade union is to obtain higher pay for its members. He must know what wages a1 e fair, and how they are det.orminPd. This may be called Economics. The relation of the trade union.; to society as a whole, and to the life of the people, may be called Philosophy. \Thus a student who would un- derstand the existing institutions must h:\Ve a knowledge of many of the different fields of study. \This does not raise the issue of the general and the specialized knowledge but rather the issue of the interdependance of the various fields of knowledge vs. the pigeon- hole concept,\ explained Prnfessor Cummins. \There is no study comprehensive enough to be pursued by it~elf \ 'There is· no study comprehen- sive enou~h to be pursued by it:;elf alone,' say~ Profe:J:oor Keller of Yale, ·unle:.s all >cupe and mdeed. all truth of mme than fragmen.t:•rY nature, are to be renoun<:ed.'

' . THE CONCORDIENSIS, SATURDAY, NOVEThfBER 11, 1933 Seven Final Installment Of Cummins' Talk (Continued from Page 6) tendant of grounds and buildings; and in addition the large corps of assistant secretaries, and stenogra- phers which these officers require or think they require. But would you abolish oll of these offices? Certainly not. I only suggest that it might be possible to struggle along without one or two of them. The business of the college facul- ties is to teach and to study. Yet it is no exaggeration to say that many college teachers give as much as half of thetr working time to activities quite unrelated to these two essential functions. Committee service and petty administrative work absorb their enet·gy in amounts that are out of all propor- tion to the significance of what is accomplished. .A proposal is made to change the time of beginning classes from eight to eight-thirty; and so a distmguished professor of English, a mathematictan, a re- nowned football coach, an econo- mist, and a professor of music who is really gifted tn playing the organ spend hours going over the pros and cons of the questiOn. If the classes begin at etght-thirty, the morning classes will not close until twelve-thirty. With the mornmg sess10n of the public schools clos- ing at twelve it will be necessary for many famthes to ,;erve two luncheons. On the other hand, If classes continue to begin at eight instead of eight-thirty, two-thtrds of the students wtll go on sleeping through their first hour classes in- stead of JUSt one half. Cannot an authority on Milton make a real contribution toward the solution of such a p10blem? Some committee work is of course essential, but iG it absolutely necessary for a small college to have twenty-three stand- ing committees, (the college cata- logue I have here indicates that number) to say nothing of the many special committees which are appointed throughout the college year? Conununity Expects Much of Profs. College teachers are continually being called upon for speeches, comm1ttee work, and other services by community enterprises. Some communities seem to have the idea that the college belongs to them and that the faculty should be at the beck and call of anyone at any time. This idea is not always dis- couraged by the college authorities who use it as a means for advertis- ing the mstitution. The result is that many a teacher Is hardly dis- tinguishable from a Y. M. C A. secretary. Let it not be thought that I speak dzsparagingly of the latter, who is doing a worthy but altogeth- er different sort of work from that which the college teacher is expect- ed to perform. If college adminis- trators would defimtely and vigor- ously take the position that the best way for a college teacher to serve the community and to adver- tise the college is to do his own par- ticular job well. they would not only relieve their teachers of much unnecessary work thereby enabling them to do more of the things that they are supposed to do (that is where the economy comes In) but they would at the same time raise educational standards. A man hard at work upon a significant problem in his field is more apt to be a first-rate teacher tha11 one who is busy making popular speeches to community clubs. .Again economy and sound educational policy are found to harmonize. Much more could be said about ways and means of economizing without lowering educational stand- ards, but I have no thought of of- fering a complete program. I have called attention t0 a few specific actions that might be taken in or- der to show that it is possible to combine economy with sound edu- cational policy. If this should give rise to the discussion conc~rmng the meriis of college debating or any of the other points mentioned, I have not made myself clear. But if, on the other hand, it should pro- mote the discussion concerning the States Changes in Educational Plan (Continued from Page 1) normal intelligent boys may have 'lbllnd spots\ In some paiticular field, and hence will not demand a standardized preparation, nor re- quire students to take Etandardized courEes In other words, an appli- cant who has done well in language may be admitte-d to the language and literature diviEion even if he ha:: not done well in mathematics What if' more he will not be re- quited to tak( mathematics in col· kge although he mu::t choo£e wrne one ethel sc1ence, either biology or chemi::try, for Union believes that a man must take some science to live intelligently in this m-odern WO!ld. possibility of working out a pro- gram of economy which, because it lS educationally sound, could be in- troduced without injury to our ~du­ cational ideals and standards and would, therefore, meet the demands of a more or less permanent \emer- gency,\ then I have not written in vain. ----a--- PROFESSOR SMITH 'l'ALilS Professor E.

DSlJRI:NG FINE TOBA~~O FOR To Fursue 'Topical Majors' Once in a division the freshman will be directed toward pursuing a \topical major\ instead of t:he pres- ent \subject-major\. No longer will specialization be allowed, this will be left to the university. Union believes that the small college sh()uld fit men for more intelligent citizenship, business, the profes- sional schools of law, medicine, dentistry, secondary school teach- Ing, industrial work, and post-col- lege study in graduate school. This Is possible, he contended~, by a thorough general training, rather than by the specialized training of the present system where a stu- dent moajo1s in some one subject rather tllan in a general field where the inter-relationship of kindred subjects is emphru~ized. The final point of the plan at present is the responsibility now placerl upon the professors to aid his seniors in coordinating their pre-graduation with their post-col- lege careea:s. Union ·believes that instead of the usual mechanical placement bure'RU, professors wh'O know blle abilities of their seniors as well as the conditions to be found h1 graduate and professional scho-ols, buEiness and industry, should be the ones to place seniors after graduation.

It may be all well and good to extend a credit of a billion or so to Russia, but how and with what will she ever be able to repay the loan? It will be a p! oblem of the fttst magnitude to wo1k out a direct trade of such volume or even a triangular trade in the present state of the world relations. Recognit~on Would Have Influence The re-establishment of cordial relations between the governments of the United States and Russia would also have a spectfic effect in the Far East. Japan is today the greatest threat to world peace. Russta feats trouble from the East. She sees that trouble g10wing out of Japanese expansion in Manchu- kuo and she now ha;s on her hands ITS the Chinese Eastern Railway prob- lem. Anything may happen along the banks of the Amur. The United States has refused recognition to Manchukuo and bas strongly ex- pressed disapproval with the Jap- anese experiment in Manchuria. In view of these troubles0me condi- tions, Moscow cannot help but de- sire early recognition by the United States. Litvinoff is prepared to pay as little as he posstbly can for recog- nition, yet he desires it intensely. Roosevelt has defined the Russo- American situatton as \regrettable.\ Something tangibly eonstructive should be expected to result from the conferences now being held. History alone can prove recognition to have been the best possible course. And that history is not yet written. \if's toasted~'

Believes Yellowjackets, With Regulars Again in Lineup, Have Slight Edge on Union By IRVING GUTTENBERG Sport:> Editor of \The. Campus,\ University of Rochester ROCHESTER, N. Y., Nov. 10.-A University of Rochester team that will show its regulars in the start- ing line-up for the first time since it opeued the season will meet Union at Schenectady on Saturday in the only out of tow'n game on the Yellowjacket schedUle. Coached by Tom Davies, former .~.\itt star and all-America backfield ~hoJce, the Y ellowjackets will enter the field on ever. terms with the Garnet. The Rochester 1ecord, .;imila,• to Union's, shows four .oss~s. one win, anc one tie for the ~resent season. However, a 14 to 6 orerdlCt over Rensselaer gives the :divermen a slight edge as the Gar- net bowed to this same tea:m, 16 to 0. Spaiches Returns to Game The return of AI Spaiches, sensa- tional sophomore halfback, whose absence trom the Hobaz t game be- ~ause of a leg injury, robbed the Daviesrnan of a vJctory, will give the additiona:l punch that is need- ed by the Rochester outlit. The shift of Charles \Chase\ Geddes from end to quarter gives the backfield added weight and power on its defense. Geddes is the \wonder\ of the Y ellowjacket .;quad. He originally sta1 ted as a guard, but has played succe~sfully tackle, end, a:nd quarter. He is the Jnly senior in the backfield. Grice at End Captain Dave Grice, one of the best defensive en<ls ever to wear a :lelluwjacket uniform, will be in the starting line-up. This is the .;e<:ond game that Grice will play in since he suffered a knee injury that kept him on the sidelines for a month. The Rochester line will have Art Ticknor a:t center. Tick tips the scale under 150 pounds. The guard positions will be played by a pair of sophomores, Contryman and 2arker, while Jenner an<l Stewart .ill the tackle be1 ths. Barney Soeh- .1er fills the other wmg position. McCulley and 1\lcConnell to Play Fullback Jack McCulley a:nd Ken McConnell, a halfback, complete th(> Rochester eleven.

Many times they see their school elevens win. How pleased they are to know that they are alumni of the winning college. They :;pend the rest of the day celebt·atlng the fact. But suddenly the alumni discover that their team has not been win- ning as consistently as one would wish. Immediately they put up a howl for the scalp of the coach. Yes, these men place the blame for a losing team on the coach. He is the man responsible for its show- ing, e.o there can be no doubt that he is to be blamed. A good exam- ple of this is the football team of Notre Dame this year. Hunk Ander- son used all his excellent knowledge to produce a winning eleven, but his material is not of the same quality that Knute Rockne had a few years ago. The Coach is the Goat Now that Notre Dame faces one of the worst seaso;;:s in many yea1 s, as far as its record is concerned, Anderson will be fired. Everything depends on the record. No one even attempts to look at the original aim of football, or any other college ath- letic team. They were sponsored by colleges in order to give their stu- dents with athletic ability a chance to play students from other schools. Immediately the game becomes pro- fessionalized. No one wm pay mon- ey to see a losing team play! So the coach is the goat of it ail. Maybe the coach has not the ma- terial that will produce a winning team. Maybe the team itself has no desire of winning games. No doubt there is some truth in the fact that the men will play only if they like a coach, but does his job depend on the opinion of one or two players? About the only item for which a coach can be blamed is for not in- stilling new spirit in a losing team. But who can judge this trait? More rests with the team than with the coach,

Practically the entire student bocly attended the meeting, held in the Memorial Chapel, since it was their first chance to hear a descrip- tion of .the .new educational policy which is a.lready attracting con- siderable attention throughout the collegiate world. Divisions ATe Natw·al Pointing out the salient features of the plan, Dr. Ellery declared that the four divisions (engineering, social studies, language, and math- ematics and .science) into which the courses will be placed are entirely natural; and that there is nothing artificial about them. The new thing about the plan, Dr. Ellery stated, is that the four divisions of the faculty become directly respon- sible for work in that division. Heretofore, the faculty in general has formulated the curricula. Now, men who might be called expert,<; in their field, will lay out the courses to be followed by students in their departments. Referring the undergraduates to the article in the last issue of the Concordiensis or in the New York Sunday Times, Dr. Ellery touched lightly on the details of the plan re- garding admission requirements and choice of courses. Faculty ad- visors, previously of but little use to freshmen, will now continue throughout the four years to guide the undergraduate in his work. Students to Benefit From the student's point of view, the new plan assumes importance first because of a much wider choice of subjects in the first two years and secondly because juniors and seniors will be required to take only four courses instead of five. Since the plan is to go into ef- fect next September, present un- dergraduates who will be in college next year will have to adapt their courses. In regard to this matter, Dr. Ellery declared that adjustment will be made on a reasonable basis. When the time comes for each stu- dent to choose his electives for the coming year, Dean Garis will in- form him just what particular ad- justments must be made. Hall, 3:30 p. m.

The let- ter follows: The Editor, The Reru.selaer Polytechnic Troy, New York Dear Sir: I think I am safe in saying that the authorities of the Institute are not pleatied with the article in your issue of November 2nd in which you seem to approve the actions of some of our studentti who h'lve be- gun to create again the trouble be- tween the btudents of Union Uni- versity and our own school which the good sense of those of both in- stitutions in recent years had great- ly allayec;i. I certainly am not pleased with it. I am informed that nothing but the courtesy and moderation of Di- rector Wittner, head of the athletic department of Union, prevented the cancellation of the football game, for which there was ample justifica- tion. While a.lmost all our students are of fine character, among fourteen hundred there will always be found some hoodlums ignorant enough and perverse enough to destroy property and run the risk of the severance of our athletic relations with an institution with which there is every reason for U:l to re- main on good terms. Such students do not properly belong in this school. Very truly yours, PALMER C. RICKETTS. Outing Club Tosses Light Clothing Aside In Favor of.Heavier Garments By ROBERT 0.

The most difficult role, that of the blind grandfa-ther was capably interpret- ed by Harvey Groesbeck. Sidney D. Markman as the uncle, and Dean Roylance, as the father p~r­ trayed their characters very satis- factorily. Ferdinand Helm, a mem- ber of the freshma:n class, showed his ability as a female imperson- ator when he took the part of Ur- sula, one of the three daughters. Robert McManus, Thomas Ordway, Milton Schwebel, and William Mitchell did their minor roles in skillful fashion. ,' Thet·e was certainly no excu~e for the ushers' allowing people to come in a:nd seat themselves while the play was in pwgre::;s. In a per- formance like \The Intruder,\ ::;l- Ienee is demanded of the audience as an aesthetic necessity. For the first five minut.as of the play there were squeakings and whispering::; from the rear of the theater. Fur- thermore, the audience revealed only its own ignornncP. of drama- tic art when audible comments ac- companied the first two group movements of the three daughters. Bad taste is far worse than bad manners. Glee Club Gives Performance The Glee Club gave a mediocre performance. The first number, Cesar Franck's \Psalm 150,\ was sung in a manner equal to the Glee Club's usually high standard. Dic- tion, tone, and rhythm were de- cidedly praiseworthy. The remain- der of the program, except for \Why Don't You Try'' and \By the Light of the Moon\ is better for- gotten. \Short'nin' Bread,\ which could easily have been the best and most popular number on the progra:m was ragged and confu::;ed. The members of the Club ap- peared to be slow in following Di- rector Elmer A. Tidmarsh. Many of tb,e students apparently did not have a too great familiarity with the pieces they were singing. ~t times some parts were slow m coming in, and often the quality of the diction varied with different songs. As a whole, however, the evening was pleasant enough.

Godshall Mali:es Address At University of Buffalo Dr. W. Leon Godshall, head of the political science department, made an Armistice Day speech at the University of Buffalo this week-end, speaking on the subject of \Prospects of Peace in The Con- temporary World.\ Dr. Godshall reviewed the ex- isting agencies for the settlement of international disputes. The rights of states are attended by ob- ligations to observe similar rights of others, according to Dr. God- shall. He further outlined pres- ent day conditions affecting peace. Some of these are depressio·'l, fail- ure of the London Economic Con- ference, Communism, Fascism, Hit- lm·ism, Japanese aggression, the Bolivia-Paraguay dispute, and the Colombia-Peru dispute. In speaking of the possible ave- nues· of approach to peace, he men- tioned economic recovery of na- tions, successful economic confer- ence, non-recognition of conditions brought about contrary to the Peace Pact of Paris, recourse to committee of inquiry regularly, re- duction of armaments, persistent education to influence public opin- ion, and the cultivation and dissem- ination of the virtue of good faith. Under existent agencies for pacif- ic settlement he referred to the following: Commissions of inquiry, commissions of conciliation, arbitra- ti0!1, f!.dj'LH;Ucation, l,.e<J,gue of Nl'!-- tions, renunciation of war, public opinion through education, negotia- tions, mixed permission and media- tion or conciliation.

The public is invited to at- tend the lecture to which there will be no charge. Has Explored Archives Dr. Clark, Professor of Lan- guages in the College of the City of New York, has spent a number of years exploring archives for docu- ments connected with early Ameri- can Indian Civilization. During his student days he spent four years in Continental libraries gammg a knowledge of Latin manuscrips. In 1929 he was selected by the Smith- sonian Institute for a research pro- ject in Europe sponsored by Gen- eral Charles G. Dawes. During the three years which Dr. Clark spent in Europe as Research Associate of the Smithsonian Institute, he dis- covered in the Vatican Library an unknown Aztec picture manuscript of 1552, the lost histories of the New \Vorld by Vasquez de Espin- osa, a history of Yucatan by Car- denas, and an unknown copy of Columbus's will. In the history of the New World by Espinosa, Dr. Clark found what is believed to be the first written description of the Maya ruins of Central America. When Dr. Clark came upon the work of Espinosa he found it cata- logued as \Anonymous.\ The book consisted of about 80 pages in print and about 500 pages in manuscript. Vasquez de Espinosa died while the book was still in the malting and it is believed tilat work on the book was stopped at the time of the au- th1lr's death. Has Met Many People His research work in the libraries of Europe has brought Dr. Clark acquaintance with many interesting people and he counts among the many friends which he has made in Europe the present Pope whom Dr. Clark knew in young manhood as a librarian. The next lecture to be given on the Ichabod Spencer Foundation will be under the auspices of the Department of Music. The lecture will take place on February 16 and John Hazadel Levis will be the speaker. 'Love of Wisdom; the Guide of Life' I Is Phi Beta Kappa Society's Motto By CHARLES L. REID \Phi Beta Kappa originated as a Greek letter frateznity much the same as t91; ..(raten1ities here on the cafupus',' said Professor Mor- ton. C. Stewart, Secretary of the Union Chapter of Phi BEta Kappa, in an intnview ye:terday. \They were concemed primarily with de- bating and the t eacing of papers.\ \The name Phi BEta Kappa,\ he continued, \is formed of the ini- tial ldters of the motto, which was formerly secret. This motto, free· ly translated, is \Love of Wisdom, the Guide of Life'.\ The first chapter of Phi Beta Kappa was organized at William and Mary College in Virginia in 1776. In 1780, the Yale Chapter was formed and called the Alpha of Connecticut. In 1781, the Har- vard Chapter was formed and called the Alpha of Ma~sachusetts Bay. There has been a good deal of controversy between .these two chapters as to which one is the older, as Harvard secured its char- ter earlier, but Yale was estab- lished first because Mr. Parmelee. the organizer, ::topped at Yale on his way to Harvard. It was Mr Parmelee, who studied at both Yale and Harvard, and later trans- ferred to Wllliam and Mary on ac- count of his health, who pursuaded the authorities of William and Mary to establish branches in other states. The society stands for three principles, represented by the three stars on the key. These principles are: friendship, morality, and lit· erature. Dr. Stewart says that there was rather an interesting mis.conception of the significance of these stars. The records of the chapter at William and Mary were lost during the Revolution, and when the Union chapter was form- ed, the three stars on the key were taken to mean the three chapters already exiEting. They therefore added a fourth for Union. This practice was continued until there were seven stars on the key. As the ltey began to look a little crowded, the organizations went back to ihe original three. Years later, within the last 25 years, the records of William and Mary were found in London, and it was discov- ered that the stars represented the three bas.ic principles of the so- ciety. The meetings of the Union chap- ter were at first entirely in the hands of the undergraduate mem- bers, as the organization was a regular Senior Society, to which the (Continued on Page 4) I I 1. i l '

Ilatha.way \VHAT IS WRONG WITH THE FOOTBALL 'rEAM There i;:; a Cc·rtain group of interested alumni, and also a number of undergraduates who seem to have a prettr sound ide<l. about what is the trouble with om· footbal1 team this year. Dlll'ing the past week end some comments were made hy several alumni whose opinion is to be respected. One gTaduate who has seen Union football teams come and go for about tw~mty years hit the nail on the head when he said that coaching the team is not a ()lle man job. It is impossiLle for one man to coach t.he bacll- field and the line, figure out the plays, and do all the wonying- al.Jout the team and there is plenty of that; and still produce a winning combination. What Coach Hatfield neerls is a good line coach to assist him. lie hag proved that he knows football fl'om the ground up, Lut he cannot do a thorough job coaching both the bacl\:field and thE' line. If the powel's that be would see fit to hire an experienct>d line co<.~ch. the Garnet teams \\ould break into the winning colu!1m with more regulal'ity. The old story that winning games lli not the fundamental reason fnr playing football is still true, Lut there is no reason why \Ve should not get the best out of the material that is avaibl.Jle. H is only necessary to ex- amine the coaching staffs of some of the neighbming- small colleges to see why ther get results. As long as couching the Union Colleg-e foot- ball team continues to l.Je a one man job, we will get the same results. ;-.;either Coach Hatfield nor auyone ebe can du the joiJ all by himself. A SllCCESSFUL EXPERIMENT A real fighting spirit was renewed in the ut~dergTaduate body Friday night. That the rally was successful was made clear by the performance of the football team against Rochester Saturday. As Professo1· Wittner pointed out. the chief reason for the medi- ocre record of the varsity eleven was the lack of support from the students themselves. An ode of pl'aise is due those who insti- gated the pep rally and wet·e re::;ponsible for its success. It was by far lhe best demon- stration of spirit ever seen on Union's cam- pus by any student enrolled he1·e now. But that is past and the future presents a more serious problem. On Saturday we play Hamilton, the last and to some the most im- portant game of the season. We can well take a i€sson from the upstatet·s' exhibition a year ago when their student body came here practically li'll masse.

Perhaps they have nothing else to do, but we are inclined to believe that the reason for so many returning is because they are interested in the welfare of their Alma ;.\Iate1·. The amount or spirit that has thus fay been demonstmted Ly the class of 1934 doe.s not indicate any great interest in the college by members of that class. The seniors should wake up, or perhaps somebody should wake them up. Right now Union Colleg·e needs all the SUJ)port it can get from alumni. In the future it will need even more coope1·ation from the graduates. 1'he time to arouse interest in the college is while \Ve are still underg:rad uates. If such steps are not taken at this time the class of 193-l will l.Je just another class after gradu- ation.

The students of Union Colleg-e are indeed very fortunate to have these lectures presented to them and .should, therefore, take advantage of the opportun- ity thu,; afforrled them to acquire some knowledge outside of the classroom. Dr. Charles Upson Clark, who will deliver the initial lecture of the year in this series, is best known for his work in collaboration with the Smithsonian Institute. His search into the archives for documents ccmnected with early American Indian Civilization re- vealed to him some interesting- and extra- ordinary facts. His recol'd as an educator and some of the hono1's bestowed upon him stand him in good stead.

After Rochester kicked out of danger to it's 30-yard line a pass from Dain to Milano, and runs by Milano and Rotunda carried the ball to the 15-y·ard line. Dain faded back and threw a fo1ward pass to Milano, who took the ball on the 3-yard line, and raced over for Union's first score since October 10 when they defeated Hobart. Mi- lano failed to make the placement kiclt good. Forwards Threaten Union Goal The remaindel' of the fil:st quar- ter saw neither team able to go deep Into the other's territory. The second quarter was evenly played, the only scoring gesture being made l>y the Rochester Yellpwjackets. On one occasion they completed th1·ee consecutive forward passes, taking the ball from their own 20-yard line to Union's 25. These passes were thrown by Sapiches and Mc- Culley. Another pass thrown by Mc- Culley was intercepted by Van Wal- dron as the half ended. Soon after the opening of the sec- ond half, which was played in a blinding snowstorm, Unicm received the ball on Rochester's 41-yard marker after an exchange of punts. Daln made a yard through the line and Rotunda picked up five more. Dain then threw a forward pass to Milano on the Yellowjacket's 18- yard line. Rotunda again added five yards, but Union was penalized five yards for offside.' Faking a pass Dain carried the ball to the 10- yard strip. On the next play the Garne>t quarterbaclt tossed another · pa;ss, this one to Waldi'On, who with two tacklers near him, grabbed the ball over his shoulders past the ertd zone for a touchdown. Milano add- ed the extra point.

Coach Hatfield saw Immediately that his running was not J.l.P to par, and he was replaced by Jiggs Rotunda, who played <?ne of his best games. The entire 1Jruon backfield played inspired. football, Tom Acheson's blocking being an Important part of the> victory. The Dutchmen line also played a better type of ball and held the speedy Rochester backs many times. AI _Spalches, sensational Yellow- jacket sophomore, was the out- standing Rochester back.

Hatfield to Return During the last few weeks there has been plenty of rumors around the campus and the city that Union would have a 'new head football coach next year. These 1·umors start whenever a team loses more than two games in a row. To spilte all rumors before they go any fur- ther Professor Wittner was asked whether there was any truth in them. \Professor Hatfield,\ said Wittner, \is a member of the fac- ulty, and as such he retains his position the same as any other fac- ulty professor.\ Thus Union can ex- pect the same fine grade of coach- ing that it has had for the past three years. Hatfield's record at Union to date includes 12 victorie~. 8 defeats, and 3 ties. Union vs. Hamilton Saturday Hamilton plays host to the Gamet. Hamilton was defeated by Haverford last Sat- urday by a score of 14 to 7. Haverford holds a victory over Wesleyan this year. Union tied · Wesleyan.

Black to Speak A.t Chapel Service Is Author of Several Books Dealing With Art of Living And the Faith in Religion Dr. Hugh Black, professor of practical theology at the Union Theological Seminary, New York City, since 1906, will give the prin- cipal address at chapel services on Sunday at 11:00 o'clock in the Mem- orial Chapel. After his graduation at Rothesay Academy, Dr. Black entered Glas- gow University from which he was graduated in 1887. He received his training for the ministry at the Free Church College of Glasgow and was graduated in 1891. Honorary Degree from Yale Dr. Black received his Master of Arts degree from Glasgow Univer- sity in 1887. The honorary degree of Doctor of Divinity was conferred upon him by Yale in 1908 and by Princeton and Glasgow University in 1911. The University of Pitts- burgh also conferred upon him the honorary degree of Doctor of Liter- ature in 1917. Dr. Black was ordained in 1891, after which he was minister of the Sherwood Church of Paisley, Scot- land, from 1891 to 1896, and then minister of St. George's United Free Church of Edinburgh until 1906, when· he came to the United States. Has Written Many Books Dr. Black Is the author of \The Dream of Youth\ 1894; \Friend- ship,\ 1898; \Culture and Re- straint,\ 1900; \Work 1902; \The Practice of Self-Culture\ 1904; \Lis~ tening to God\ (Edinburgh Ser- mons) 1906; \Christ's Service of Love,\ 1907; \The Gift of Influence\ (University Sermons), 1908; \Com- fort,\ 1910; \Happiness 1911; \Three Dreams,\ 1912; \According to My Gospel\ (Montclair Ser- mons), 1913; \The Open Door,\ 1914; \The New World,\ 1915; \Lest We Forget,\ 1920; \The Adventure of Being Man,\ 1929. all their validity.

In 1929 the Smithsonian Institu- tion selected Dr. Clark for a re- search project in Europe sponsored by Gen. Charles G. Dawes. It was hoped that this research would un- cover documents pertaining to Maya and Aztec civilization, and would shed a new light upon their development. Vatican Library Findings Dr. Clark began his work by ex- amining the inventories of the Vat- ican Library, He was promptly re- warded, for he discovered an un- known Aztec picture manuscript of 1552, with 186 accurate drawings of medicinal plants bearing their Az- tec names, and a Latin commentary telling how the plants were used for medicine. The entire work was done by an Aztec Indian, trained by the Spanish Franciscans. A second and greater find was made 111 the Baberini Collection. It was the author's copy for the prin- ter of a huge volume. \The Lost History of The New World\ by Fray Antonio Vazquez de Espinosa, a learned Carmelite, who died in Seville, Spain, in 1630, presumably while his book was still in the mak- ing. With his death the publication, which Leon Pinelo considered the most extensive description of Amer- ica. yet written, ceased; and the book, with eighty pages in print and 500 still in manuscript, lay un- noticed in the Vatician Library un- til Dr. Clark came upon it. Is C. C. N. Y. Professor Dr. Clark, who has prepared lec- tures for the Bangor Theological Seminary, is now Profess<>r of Lan- guages in the College of the City of New York. He is a member of the American Philology Association, Phi Beta Kappa and Alpha Delta Phi Fraternity, and is a Fellow of the Royal Historical Society. Fray Antonio tells in his accounts of the christening ceremony among the Guaicurus, where the chief's son kept shouting his name as he killed several boys from an enemy tribe with a stout club; his account of the assembling of the various parts of the body of an Indian woman eaten by alligators in a Nic\ aragua lake, and how he himself said mass over them; and other in- teresting anecdote!i. ---0,--- Sidney Markman Elected Classical Club President At its first current meeting of the year held at the home of Professor George D.

In 1901 Union met Brown University and was defeated 24 to 5. Buf- falo University was also met once. Buffalo defeated the Garnet boys 26 to 0 in 1897. The only time Cooper Union (now Cooper Union Students Team) was mel was in 1930. This game was .played in Schenectady and Union won 32 to 0. City College of New York was defeated by Union in 1907 in Schenectady 35 to 5. Columbia was met many times on the Lion and the only time Union won or even scored was in 1916 when the Garnet won on a field goal, 3 to 0. This victory has always been a shining example of Union's football capabilities. In 1919 Columbia was held to a scoreless tie. All the games in the Columbia series were played in New York City. Clarkson Tech was met thrice from 1921 until 1923. Union won two times, 14 to 0, and 13 to 6, but lost the third contest 13 to 0. Back in 1891 Union played a team called the Clinton Liberal In- stitute which it defeated 52 to 0. Union played Colgate University, the- present classy Red Raiders, ten times from 1891 tmtU 1908. Union defeated Colgate five times, wltile once these two teams played a scoreless tie. In 1891 Colgate won 20 to 12, and repeated its victory in 1893 witb a 10 to 6 score, The second game was played at Sche- nectady. The 1897 game was cancelled, but in 1898 Union won 11 to o. The next year Colgate came back with another victory, 17 to 5. Three gaml's were played in 1900, and Unl~n defeated Colgate three times that year. The scores were, 12 to 0, 12 to 0, and 10 to 0. In 1901 the Garnet repeatE>d a 21 to 0 win. Colgate was not met again until 1907 when they came to Scht'nectady and played a scoreless tie. The last time the two ever met in football was in 1908 when Colgate wolJ., 24 to 4. Another Garnet rival of the past that no longer exist$ is the Columbia Athletic Club. In 1894 they played a 6 to 6 tie with the Garnet, but in 1903 and '04 defeat-ed Union 36 to 0 and 10 to 0. I have many more ancient Union football scores which I shall publish in the near future.

Four \Villingness to Use Credit Key to Monetary Problem (Continued from Page 1) elements which make it entirely different from a true specie system. The plan harks back to an ate which ended half a century ago. Although its proponents claim that the theory provides for a scientific money, it is based upon economic conditions which have been non-ex- istent in the Western World for centuries. The theory of the \new deal\ monetary policy assumes that prices are determined by a certam balance between the supply and de- mand of commodities and the sup- ply and demand of 15old. It \tlem.; much more logical to believe that prices are dependent on ~he produc- tion and turnover of goods and the amount and velocity of circulation of credit than to hold to the theory of gold or metal control which has a value and significance only as history. There is no necessary direct con- nection between the price paid for an ounce of gold and the price paid for a bushel of wheat, a pair of shoes, a pack of cigarettes, or any other article of use and consump- tion. Commodities are not ex- changed for gold. Changing the price of gold, therefore, does noth- ing to affect the price of commod- ities unless in some way or another the change provides the public with both more money and a desire to spend it. It is quite true that if the price of gold is artificially raised, the value of bank gold reserves will also be increased and will enable the banking system to issue more currency and credit. But this will never affect prices unless the public is inclined to utilize this credit in purchases on. the commodity mar- ket. This increased demand, pro- vided the supply on the markets is neither excessive nor increasing THE CONCORDfENSIS, FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 17, 1933 ahead of demand, will tend to raise prices. But without the ability or willingness of consumers to utilize expanded credit, and lteep that money circulating, the value of gold might be raised any number of times without affecting the pur- chasing power of the money in peo- ple's pockets and in people's banks. It is this problem of getting cur- rency and credit into use that pre- sents the greate;:;t difficulty. Either the administration does not realize the importance of this problem or else it feels itself un- equal to the task of solving it. In spite of all its attempts commodity prices still remain static at a low level. And U. S. bond:; :;old above par have slipped several points be- low 100. Monetary uncertainty is houling all bu;:;incss in u. :c<t:J.te of paralysis. .And winter is here. It is high time that the administration was aware of the fact that the Mid- dle Ages have passed and that mod- ern monetary problems demand modern treatment. Quite true that all Presidents have made some mis- takes and will make more. But an \experimental\ spirit on the part of the present administration will never remove from it the responsi- bility for avoidable mistaltes. The Hoover administration was criti- :m::m::::m::::::m:::::m:::m:::::::m:m:m:::m:::m:::: cized for its apparent inaction. The present administration promised ac- tion. It is keeping that promise.

Although they are retaining enough of the primitive elements nevertheless, the Mountebanks are stressing only the currently inter- estmg qualities of these early dr a1uas. c.ve1 y endeavor is being h1aae to ext1act tne universally Ia.!Crcal eleruent in the comic inter- ! ude or the · Second :::lhepherd s rla.y' an<! to accentuate the dram- atic 'phases of \l!.veryman.\ The spoken pru ts in these plays will be supplemented with inci- dental organ music.

Dr. Clark is very widely known for his research work in the various libraries of Europe where he has discovered many lost classical Latin and Greek manuscripts as well as those pertaining to the early civilization of America.

Oonditiops in the Camps The conditions in these camps, continued Dr. Doty, were very bad, particularly the food, which was appalling, but the men did not seem to mind the crudeness and repul· siveness of the cuisine nearly as much as the lack of equipment for their amusements. Each camp con- tained an athletic field and a rude theater, and equipment for them was much in demand. The camps were enclosed by very high barbed wire fences, and were comprised of rough barracks, a headquarters building, a theater, a hospital, a parade ground, and an athletic field, all of which were very crude. While the actual government of the carnps was, naturally, in the hands of the German officer in charge of the various activities of the carnp. The Chairman of the Committee, the executive, was as- sisted by the chairman of the vari- OUI:l committees, such as the com- mittee for the theater, and the com- mittee for the hospital.

SMITH, Delta Upsilon THREE PLANS Two proposed changes in the method of conducting Student Body meetings have been sqggested by the Student Council. One is, that these meetings be held bi-weekly in the We also beiieve that mo1·e interest would be shown in the student body meeth1gs if more of the business which the stud.ent coun- cil ·is undertaking were made public. To the average undergraduate it seems that the Student Council has accomplished little so far this sear. If one had followed clo,sely, the rep0rts of the Council meetings, he would see that outside of agitation about hockey, revision of freshman rules, and action on cer- tain taxes, nothing important has been done. But this is not the case. It was revealed in a thorough discussion of the problem with a councilman that much action of lively intel'- est g-oes on behind the scenes which is never heard about outside of the meeting. It was seen from this interview that this hushed-up action has often been of a type that would greatly al'Ouse interest in stud.e11t g·overn- ment. The Concordiensis admits that it is part to !JlC::tme ill not g·iving sufficient space to the reports of the Council meetings, and hereby revises its policy in this respect. In the fu- tln'e, the publicity chairman of the Council will be guanmteed enough space in this paper to make known all the important actions of hi~ organization. In l'eturn for this guar- antee, The Concordiensis asks that hereafter, to increase student interest, more details l>e published about what is going on in the Council meetings. ~===~ GREAT! !

Kendrick, University of Rochester, '89 Truth lives, the evil perishes. Time puts the test and adds the final touch to all that's good and true. Against the sky we see an oak that sways but clings. We know its roots strike deep to where beneath the barren rock there must be soil and moisture fed by heaven's dew. Time is the gardener, Life the soil, and Opportunities the seeds, which blossom forth in noble deeds, and ripen slow experience to firm and lasting good. The ship which now sails proudly, mistress of the sea, is built of hearts of oak.. Suns nourished them, wind~;~ tempered them, years strengthened them, to slowly lengthening stems which swayed nor broke, but gripped their tiny roots and stood. The heirs of sturdy virtues we, sons of Psi U, sons of sons, and sons of sires' sons, and sires of sons. Endeavor high, knit to enduring purpose, wrought the stock and sinew of our past; and may the present strength of consummated hope lead on from good to better, and from better to the dawning best, The Spirit of Psi Upsilon Forever-aye, Forever and Forever. Forever, live forever! Seems that idle hope? Thus grew the tiny grains of sand to mountain slope: And first faint flush of dawn, which has the day begun, Was rosy-fingered herald of the full-orbed sun. Time is the stern examiner. This hall which stands, Stands fast on rock foundation. And the clasped hands Are symbol that the race begun, from Sire to Son, Shall pass undimmed the Spirit of Psi Upsilon. The truth shall live, good conquer! Of the goodly past The present good is proof, and promise at the last, When yet another five and seventy years are gone, This good shall Jive.

Feb. 15th, 1933 -Bepdnted from The Diamond of Psi Upsilon Week's Best Editorial I<~XIT PROHIBITION Few present college students have ever taken a legal drink of intoxi- cating liquor in their lives, except, perhaps, as a medicine. Yet there are few college students who have not taken a drink of liquor for other than medicinal pur- poses. Herin lies the especial significance of the repeal of the Eighteenth Amendment, which was assured last Tuesday when the reputedly dry state of Utah became the thirty- sixth to vote for the repeal of pro- hibition. Prohibition, which failed because of method and not principle, was a crime, chiefly against the younger generation. It was a crime because, instead of deterring the practice of drink- ing, it offered to the thrill-seeking, excitement-loving younger people an added incentive to engage in bacchanalian reveleries. It made of drinking more of a sport than it ever was before. It destroyed all vestige of temperance. It annihil- ated the disparaging attitude to- ward drink, and substituted an at- titude of commendation. It made sport of drunkenness, and led y->uth to flaunt its disregard uf a consti- tutional law. Repeal will have no immediate effect on the collegiate world. It is not as though a long-lost person- al liberty is •being restored. !<'or, although long denied, the freedom to drink as well as to eat what he desired, was never lost to the aver age American. Secret agencies, op- erating sometimes under the pro- tection of the law, .supplied to the citizerus that which the federal government sought to deny. Whether or not repeal will have any ultimate effect on this genera- tion of undergraduates is debatable. It is probable that the harm done the present student, reared during the late era of farce and hyprocrisy-, IS ineparable. In the mistake of prohibition, however, there lies a .sound lesson for the future: the lesson that only through e·ducation, .and a slow an!l tedious process of education at that, can a solution of the .problem of drink ever be reached. So revolutionary a change in such an age-long and rudimentary habit as drinking, cannot be accomplished overnight. -u. of M.-

The Garnet backs were unable .to make a single first down, and gained only 14 yards from serimmage as compared to the 292 yard total for Hamilton.

Afte rUnion had beld for downs once more, but following a punt by Dain, McLaren, Scobie, and J.\.lcKenzie made two first downs on thi ee plays, and then McKenzie carneu tne pigskin around rignt end for the touchdown. The u·J for the extra point failed. Almost all the gains made by the Conti- nentals m the first half were end run:;. Repeatedly the Union ends were \sucl.ted in,\ and the Ham- ilton backs tore through until they were stopped by the secondary de- fense. McGee Bloclts Punt The second half was a repetition of ·the first period with the excep- tion of the fact that there was con- siderable more punting. Hamilton continued to keep the ball deep in Union territory, and late in the third period the break came. Cap- tain McGee again crashed through the Union line to block Milano's punt which he recovereiL and <?ar- ded to the Garnet one yard str1pe. Scobie went over for the second touchdown on the next play. ScQ- bie's attempt to malre the extra point by a r!l11ning play throug:tJ. the center of the line was checked. Union's offense was utterly hope- less. Not a single man in the back- field was able to get loose tor a substantial gain. In spite of this inability to gain on running plays, the Garnet did not open u:p its passing attack once. Although the field was in very bad condition due to continual snow, and the ball was wet it seemed that a passing at- tack might have borne fruit. Flayed in Snow The contest was played in almost zero weather, and snow fell throughout the entire game. In the second half it was a regular blizzard, and toward the close of the game, both teams resorted to kicking on the first play. Union played a hard game and fought to the finish, but with the complete lack of offense, the Gar- net was lucky to give as good an account of itself as it did. Lam- beth Fox and Moulton were tow~rs of ~trength in the line on the defense while the whole Gar- net backfiel'd did well in checking the Buff and Blue ball toters. 'rhe summary follows : Pos.

Dr. MacCraeken chose to speak about the obsolete code known as chiv- alry. His speech follows: \Western society is under an ob- solete code known as chivalry. Chivalry is the code of behavior of the armed knight. It is a code of· warfare and for wari'iors. It was imported along with oranges from . the OrLent by the crusaders. It ex- ists in its most perfect example In the bushido of the Japanese nobil- ity. No western soci'ety has reached. this full flower of chivalry. \To my mind, the code which it replaced, the social code of the northern European nations, was much superior to it. It is to be found in the narratives of the Scan- dinavians. The advantages which it possessed ovet• chivalry were the comparative equality of the sexes, the emphasis upon family and clan loyalties, as opposed to ·the gang loyalties of the brotherhood of knights, (which ran counter to the family), and its comparatively peaceful outlook. Chivalry as Domination \Chivalry is a code of domina- tion, based on the duel. as its en- forcing weapon. Ever since the duel was abolished, and since in- dustrial society brought women in- to competitive production with men, chivalry has been on the decay.

Moulton PSI UPSILON T ODAY marks the conclusion of the cele- bration of the one-hundredth anniversary of the founding- of the Psi Upsilon fmte111ity. Union is proud that she can claim Psi Upsilon as one of her children, and proud of the fine record that the fratemity has made, nut only here, but at other representative American colleges. Union takes pride in all of her fraternities, but she is especially proud of the six that were founded here. This week Psi Upsilon has joined Kappa Alpha, Sigma Phi, and Delta Phi in looking back upon a hundred years of successful history, and within the next few years Chi Psi and Theta Delta Chi will gather at Union to celebrate their cen- tennials. Union is grateful to Psi Upsilon for the beautiful memorial which was dedicated this afternoon. To the future generations this should prove an enduring symbol of what fraternity has meant to the men of Psi Up- silon. But, beautiful as it is, and g-rateful as we are to have it on our campus, we are still more grateful to Psi Upsilon for the men which it has developed at U11ion. Perhaps the greatest glory of any fratern- ity is its alumni. Judged by this criterion, Psi Upsilon has a record which is unques- tionably one of the finest in the Greek-letter world. Its chapter rolls include names of presidents, governors, senators and nationally known professional men, as well as those scores of other men who have played an im- portant, though not conspicuous part in the history of the nation. That a fraternity should be able to cele- brate a century of successful activity is \veil worth consideration. At prese-nt, when col- lege traditions und customs are being ques- tioned, it is to be expected that fraternities should be rather carefully scrutinized. To the critical, we present such a record as that of Psi Upsilon. A hundred years of success and steady grov.ih would seem to be more than sufficient proof that the fratemity has filled a vital need in undergraduate life. Fur- thermore, that a thousand alumni of twenty- six other colleges and universiti-es should cc;>me to Union from all parts of the continent to attend the centennial is indicative of what Psi Upsilon has continued to mean to its older men. Over a hundred years ago Union gave evi- dence of her confidence in fraternities. Peri- ods of change and readjustment may bring new problems to all societies of this kind. If this should prove to be so, may Psi Upsilon continue to have as great success in solving them as it has had in the hnndeed years just completed! C. \Vl\1.

His A Balanced Diet In this fast-moving age no cau- tion is more apropos than to keep a balanced diet. A thousand different, disconcert- ing interests confront the modern student under the system of mass education in the UnitecL States.

Each division is responsible for its cur- ricula, and the curricula within each division are ela:stic. That means that the large group of 800 undergraduates is divided into four smaller groups, on the .basis of the students' abilities and interests. The college students may ag~in be divided into still smaller umts, of which the fraternity group may be typica:I.

Advantag.es of Fraternity Union College campus in its fra- ternity houses presents for imme- diate profitable use what Harvard and Yale have spent millions of dollars to briohg to reality. Just as the fraternity in 1833 wa:s a ctistinct and advantageous influence in the intellectual advancement of youth, so the fraternity of 1933 has an im- portant intellectual function to per- form. A fraternity house with its large living arucl: lounging rooms and its common taJble is socially valuable to the undergraduate. The fraternity house can be of enorm- ous value intellectually, but isolat- ing one room, comfortable, conven- ient of access but secluded, as a read1ng room and a Iibra:ry. The larger college library is as essen- tial as a college laboratory-but just as most effective laboratory work in science is done in a small fraternity libra:ry, always open, in the house where the user lives his daily life, offers inviting opportun- ities for scholarliness that the large institutional library lacks. The col- lege fraternity can make no richer contribution to the intellectual ad- vancement of youth wherever her chapters are established. Union College, a-s the mother of college fraternities, with confidence and affection points Psi Upsilon and all her fraternity offsprings to this eminently fitting and profoundly valuable academic career.

Rightly interpreted, these public exercises are not to flaunt idly the banner of private privilege, but to recognize that special privi- !Pge carries with it esp~cial obliga- tion. If, in the long run, an insti- tution or a society is felt to have served solely selfish ends, and to have taken its profits at unfair cost to the common wea.J, it cannot evad·e an accounting with the body politic of which it is a member. Of its own accord. Psi Upsilon has opened its books of rpcord, offering by recounting our past history a means of testing the integrity and validity of actual achievement. Fu- tile would be any attemp to fore- cast the future in any such factua:l terms. But we can, with equal openness and frankness, offer a means of testin.; the integrity and validity of our outlook, as we face forward. We shall put plain queE- tions plainly, and seek to give hon- est answers. Ha~ Encom·aged Scholarship First, what is t.h~ attitude of Psi Upsilon as a national fraternity to the direc educational concernS/ of our American colleges? It is often said that college fraternities are in- different or even hostile to the in- tellectual purposes to which our colleges are dedicated. These very exercises have already suggested our ans·wer in their clear and un- constra:ined encouragement of scho- lastic effort and attainment. Our nnnunl scholarship awards are tan- gible evidence of a fixed intent to support the just demands of aca:demic work and to cooperate with the colleges In emphasizing their fundamental purp()se. Our fraternity is mindful of the memor- able convention at Washington in May 1929, and of the great meeting in honor of Brother William How- arrl Taft at which h>:J eloquently urged the mingled d·isciplines of scholarship and of character-of which he stood the b!'st exemplar. We are mindful of his warnings against indifference and apa,thy, and of his satisfaction that Psi Up- silon had taken definite stand to- wards the recognition and better- ment of academic work. To the initiative and leadership of our for- mer President Brother Earl D. Babst, to the generosity of the d·onor of our scholarship awards, and to the sustained efforts of many in office and out of it, the fraternity and the colleges concern- ed are directly indebted. No social fraternity can. 'Claim the single- minded devotion to scholarship which is the unique function and proud heritage of Phi Beta Kappa. But Psi Upsilon can at least dis- claim kinship with the heedless and the hostile_ It may, indeed, rightly profess what it has already practised-a sympathetic and con- structive attitude towards· the pri- mary educational aim of our col- leges. Citizenship Tralnilig Important Our American undergraduate col- leges commo<;,ly recognize a second educational purpose. To the educa- tion of th~ mind they a:d<L the edu- cation of the man. They regard the disciplines of scholarship and of character as alike educational. This second, rather tham secondary, function they often broadly define as training for citizenship. Our secoid leading question may thus be put simply-what is Psi Up- silon's attitude towards the obliga- <Continued on Page 5)

Fencing Club to Be Organized Here Will Not Be Connected With Athletic Department; Plan In t e r co II e g i a t e Meets A club, which in no way will be affiliated with the college, except that its members must be students, is being formed to stimulate and support fencing. The nucleus of the club will consist of members of last year's fencing class. Individual fencing instruction will be given by Mr. Kurt Von Forstmeyer, fencing instructor, and Mr. Jerome Winig, member of last year's University of Michigan fenc- ing team. Mr. Von Forstmeyer will also act as advisor to the club. The first meeting of the club will be held the evening of December 5 in Silliman Hall, and will be followed by semi-monthly meetings. Dues will be collected for the purpose of supporting meets with other college teams, and for keys for the mem- bers, Plan Intercollegiate Meets Tentative meets are being ar- ranged with teams from Williams, Colgate, Cornell, and Hamilton. Al- tl:lough no datell have beel'! set for tl:lese meets, they are certain to be held. A home-and-home series is anticipated with Williams. A fenc- ing team, according to the Intercol- legiate Fencing Association, con- sists of three foilsmen, two sabre- men, ahd two epee men. Tlie Club is now practicing in the use of the epee, which has never before been u;ed here. A meet is being planned with the .Albany Y. M. C . .A. Several of the more promising members of the club from the freshman class will be selected to participate in this meet. - --~-o---~-- HAMILTON GRID CAPTAINS Following the Hamilton-Union Union game last Saturday, the Hamilton team elE>cted William R. Jones and A. R. McKenzie, III, as co-captains for the 1934 season. Hamilton this year completed thei1· most successful gridiron season since 1900. They lost only one game, being defeated .by Amherst, whom they will not meet next year. The Continerttal grid forces will again play Union's eleven next year in their forty-second contest. ThE> game will be played on Alexander Field here on Nov. 17, 1934. THE BEACON GRILL Serving Delicious Sandwiches Fried Oysters and Clams On the Half Shell 766 ALBANY STREET \On the Crest of the Hill\ THE CONCORDIENSIS, FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 24, 1933 by Arnold J. Friedman Continuing with the report of the records of past Union College foot-. baH team,;, one finds that nine games were .played against Cornell Uni- versity on the gridil,on. These games were played between 1887 and 1920. The only time the Garnet was victorious over the Ithacans waB in 1887, the first game of the short series. The game was played at Ithaca, and Union won, 24 to 10. The following year, again at Ithaca, Cornell won 26 to 4. In !890 Cornell z·epeated with a 32 to 0 victory. Two more games were played in Ithaca in 1893 and '94. .Cornell won these two games, 16 to 6, and 37 t0 0. The score of the 1900 game was Cornell 11, Union 0. In. 1901 Cornell's margin of victory was 24 to 0. The next year it mounted to 43 to 0. From 1902 until 1920 Cornell was not .played in football. But in 1920, the same year Union lost to Army by a 35 to 0 score, Cornell de- . feated the Garnet 60 to 0. As can be seen, Cornell holds eight wins over Union as compared with Union's one victory over Cornell. The Crescent Athletic Club, probably of New Yo1•k City, was played in 1893. They defeated the Union warriors, 20 to 8. That was the only time they met. Union played Dartmouth College tlll'ee times. The first game was played 40 years ago in 1893, the same year of the Crescent game in Albany, and Dartmouth won 22 to 0. In 1900 Union held Dartmouth to a scoreless tie, but the final time the two met, in 1903, Dartmouth smothered .the Garnet under a 34 to 0 score. The Edison Club once played Union's eleven in 1904 here in Schenectady, with the college team winning, 12 to 0. Another strong modern team that once played Union was Fordham University. In 1902 Fordham defeated Union 5 to o, but the Ga1·net came back in 1915 and defeated the Rruus '6 to 0. This was only a two game series, but is indeed one of the few played with modern giants that did not end with Union on the short end. The year Union lost to Fordham, 1902, they also played Lehigh Univer- sity. Lehigh won, 41 to 0. They were never met again, .probably because of the score of the first game. The Laureate Boat Club of Troy, N. Y. once was Union's arch rival on the gridiron, for the records show that these two teams met no less than twelve times from 1890 until 1903. Play- ing at Schenectady in 1890 the Laureates defeated Union 34 to 0, and two years later again came to Dorp town to snatch a 4 to 0 win. That same year Union traveled to Troy, and again were nosed out by the Boatmen, this time the score being 14 to 12. But in 1895 the Boatmen came to Schenectady again, and the college boys managed to eke out an 8 to 0 vict01y. That same yca1 another game wa::; staged at Troy, but this ended in a scoreless tie. In 1896 the Laureates beat Union twice, 14 to 0, and 6 to 0. In 1897 they again scored over the Garnet, 16 ·to 0, but that same year Union turned the tables and beat the Boatmen 6 to 0. From then on the Boatmen were easy for the college boys. In 1898 Union won, 12 to 0. They repeated in 1901 with a 6 to 5 win, and again in 1903 with a 5 to 0 margin. The Laureates beat Union six times, while Union beat them five, the other game being a tie. Middlebury College was played ten times, Union winning four of the games, Middlebw·y three, and the other three ending in ties. The first game of this series was played in 1903, and was a scoreless tie. In 1904 Union defeated the Panthers, 41 to 0. In 1907 Middlebury again held Union to a scoreless tie. During 1909, 1910, and 1911, Mid- dlebw•y's eleven traveled to Schenectady three times, and each time Union tJ•otmced them, the scores being 18 to 6, 17 to 5, and 3 to 0. In 1916 Middlebury again traveled here, but this time was more success- ful, and managt>d to win by a touchdown, 6 to 0. They won by thP samP margin in 1920, Th€' last two games betwe.en thE' two were in 1923 and '24. The first one was a 7 to 7 tie, but Middlebury took the final contest, 19 to 0. · This by no means finishes the record of the Union elevens of the past against teams they no longer me!'l. Mor!' will be published in the near future. WINTER SPORTS CALENDAR BASI{ETBALL 1932-33 Score Daw Opponent Place u. Opp. Dec. 9 Middlebury Middlebury I Dec.13 Clarkson Tech.

It was the first non-sect- arian college in the United States and its charter still prohibits its control by any one church. The liberal spirit which marksd its birth made Union a pioneer in educational reform. During the presidency of Dr. Eliphalet Nott, 1804 to 1866, there were added to the usual classical cur- riculum a scientific course in 1820, instruction in civil engineering was begun in 1828, and in 1854, chemistry was placed upon a technical basis. Thus from an early date scientific and aca- demic courses have run side by side at Union Col- lege, each making its own contribution to the in- tellectual life on the campus_ Union College together with its graduate de- partments in Albany, twelve miles distant, con- stitutes Union University. The graduate depart- ments and the dates of their founding are: Al- bany Medical College, IS3.8; Albany Law School, 1.851; Albany College of Pharmacy, 1881: and the Dudley Observatory. The undergraduate courses at Union lead to the following degrees: Bachelor of Arts Bachelor of Science Bachelor of Science in Chemistry Bachelor of Science in Civil Engineering Bachelor ·Of Science in Elrctrical Engineering Bachelor of Science in Physics The Union campus of 97 acres, overlooking the Mohawk river and facing the Helderberg Moun- tains, is one of the beauty spots of the country. lnformai·ion regarding entrance requirements may be ob>tained from C.

Six Church and Theater Have Like Purpose Professor He1'11ick Speaks in Chapel on Common Purpose Of Church, Modern Drama By CHARLES L. REID, JR. The poet William Blake on-ce said \What is the Theater? What 1s the Church'? Are they two or are they one'?\ Professor Raymond H<>lTirk answered this question In Chapel yesterday, saying, \The Theater and the Church, the two social agencies for the advance- ment of man, share with each other the same subject matter. Both are deeply concerned with the battle each one of us must wage with &estiny, with defects in his own ~oul, with hereditary tendencies, and with environment.\ The ideas of modern drama, he continued, as well as modern the- ology can all be found in the Gos- pel of Christ: \In as much as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto Me.\ The \Me in the quo- tation, he said, refers to the spirit of Truth, Bea:uty, Justice, or any other noble synonym that stan<is for God. Hope to Gain Insight Into Struggle Professor Hem·iek added that both the Church and the Theater at·e concerned p1·imarily with the relation uf the one to the many, and with the claims of the individ- ual against the common welfa:x·e. Men ft·equent both Church. and Theater in order to gain an insight into this age-old struggle betsween the individual and the group. Nowhere is this struggle more apparent than in the United States, just now in the throes of a change from fierce a:nd ruthless individual- ism to a sort of commonwealth of cooperative members. Modern Theater-goers Different In contrast to the audiences of the early theaters, contin·ued Pro- fessor Herrick, present day theater- goers now participate in the action of the play. They see the working out of their problems, and indeed themselves, vividly portrayed in all ignominy. This type of drama started with Ibsen, in whose plays may be found all the pdnclpal ideas of modern drama. Ibsen. an ardent exponent of the theory of individualism, made one !'estriction on it. He expressed· the conviction: no individual ca:n save himself without first losing himself in an attempt to save the group.

Conventions come and go W'Jth the years, following a traditional order of visi·ts to the chapters, call- ing together delegates of the un- dt.rgraduate membership in the ex- ercise of the supreme power of Psi Upsilon. Catalogues appear at in- tervals, twelve in all. The General Catalogue of 1917, like Its Immedi- ate predecessors, was called \monu- mental,\ followed by the more mode~t but highly useful Directory of 1931, containing the names of 18,497 initates and the addresses of 12,132 living members. Song-Books, edition after edition, are worthy of a lyrical history which only awaits an appraising pen. The Diamond, a quarterly of widespread interest has already passed into its twen- tieth volume, and is supported by the Herbert L. Bridgman Diamond Memorial Fund. Guidanoo of the Fraternity While some organization, even in a brotherhood, seems necessary, the Executive Council, although gener- ously endowed by the Conventions with large disciplinary powers, guides the Fraternity through tradi- tion and precedence, relying on the chapters a·nd ·their alumni to main- tain and deserve the high privllege of membership in Psi Upsilon. The Executive Council of the present day, under the leadership of Ed- ward Living;.ton Stevens, Chi '99, carries on its responsibilities with the quiet effectiveness long char- acteristic of that group of devoted brothers. In late years annual Con· ferences of alumni representatives have been held, and more recently the Alumni Association of Psi Up- silon has been formed, to strength- en and to support the wori< of the Convention and of the Executive Council.

Men Divide Into Groups UNION•s OLD STANDBY Br·ing men together anywhere, es- pecially in college, and they begin to divide naturally into groups. Man is a social being. Friendship is a necessity. Psi Upsilon is an answer to that need. Its success has become a romance; its Ideals, a tradition. It interprets life to its sons through priceless companionships. In its ideals and precedents there are ac- tive and necessary forces of disci- pline which act and react on the individual as well as on the group.

LONG Business recovery demands, as a prerequisite, a moderate loosening of credit in the form of loans to industry. 'l'l;le pressure of increas- ing industrial costs under the NRA makes this demand all the more insistent. The failute of bank cvedit to respond mon promptly to this high p1 essure expansion pro- gram has been the cause of the charge that bankers are not dis- playing the Liberality which they should in dealing with applications for credit. This is an old charge which always bobs up in times of depression when a majority of business men have lost money and are in need of additional capital. Such persons cannot understand why the banks are not in a position to stake them to a new start in business. But business men do not stand alone behind this indictment of bank::; and bankers.

Dr. Holmes went on t<> say that all of our social and industrial sys- tems are built on violent irrational inequality. Our rugged individuaJ- ism, our ~erciless competition and our attitude of the survival of the fittest all exaggerate this inequal- ity. Unfortunately it works out in wars and depressions.

Following this Austin Fox moved that Student Body meetings be held every second Monday, following the regular Student ·CounciJ. Meetings, in ·the Old Cha·pel with voluntary attendance; that the business to be brought up be published in the pr·e- ceding issue of The Concordiensis. Donald Moulton then inquired if the student body could have the pr·ivilege of handing in a slip at the Student Body Meetings giving them credit for atte·ndance at daily as- sembly or the ·equivalent of attend- ance at a Sunday Organ Re·cita•l. President Flinn replied that it was impossible to do this and called for a vote on the original motion. Tripp Suggests New Chapel • Before .the vote· could• be taken, however, L. Reed. Tripp made the motion to amend the original mo· tion :by substituting \New Chapel\ for \Old Chapel.\ The motion was seconded and promptly forgotten. A vote was taken on the orig.inal motion and passed. Flinn an- n·oun'Ced that the first meeting would be held on December 11 and announced the order of procedure to ·be used.

Immediately, Her- bert Hauser rose and declared that ~his mo.Uon wa<a not necessary be- cause according to Parliamentary Law, under which the meetings were supposed to be conducted, the power is understood. Notwithstand· ing, the motion was put to vote and carried.

There is a story told of how President Eliphalet Nott Pot- ter, who was given to trying new administrative tricks, decided that it would be benificial to give the freshmen a weekly exam in math. The fresh of '75 and thereabouts were very much lilte the freshmen of today, they dislilted weekly quizzes. Some thing had to be done so a meeting of the student body was caJled. It was held in the grove opposite the site of the present Psi Upsilon housf!. A pet- ition was drawn up and presented to Rev. Potter, \a college profes- sor without educatio~, a preacher without religion\ The matter was brush-ed aside. No Response The day for the quiz arrived. The boys attended their class conducted by the beloved Isaiah B. Price. Directions were given, the boys did not respond. Rev. Potter came up and ru~ked why they were not do- ing their work. The response was that they w~;re without pencils, The president furnished them with writing implements, yet they con- tinued to refuse to work. They were without knives to sharpen the pencils. And so it went until Rev. Potter asked the president of the class, who was a very brilliant pu- pil, why he would not cooperate. The boy oi'.nswered to the effect that there were two reasons; namely, that he did not want to, and that he had signed a petition not to. The matter was evidently- put aside after that. Men of Action In the fall of 1889 \Tuffy\ Wie- rnans came to Union as an Instruc- tor of Mathematics. He was given a freshman class of about forty members who enjoyed his classes until one day the young professor gave a quizz. When the examina- tions were corrected it was found that ninety percent of the men had failed. Weimans' class were men of ac- tion. A freshman class meeting was called. The matter discussed. After a heated argument it was de- (Continued on Page 3) The article follows in part: \In these days when one has to be almost a chiseler to b.r eak into print, there is one branch of col- lege public-ity which wiU always find the latch string on the outside of the door. I refer to home- town publicity. In the good old days when it was possible to land general college star ies with ea::e, many of the larger institutions re- frained from carrying home-town publicity. Many of the larger col- leges felt that it was a waste of time to send out to the home-town papers the thousands of items which come up during the course of an academic year. My experi- ence last year, in giving every sen- ior who graduated from Cornell University a write-up in the home- town paper and furnishing the newspaper with mats of every graduate, leads me to il1e conclu- sion that home-town publicity pays greater dividends in the long run than the occasional 'big-story' which may land in the metropol- itan press ...• \For anyone Interested in home- town publicity along these lines may I suggest that Mr. Mi'lton M. Enzer, director of publicity at Union College, at Schenectady, New York, has worked out one of the finest systems that I have seen. , , o \

A great deal of credit is due to those who are behind the revival, and the Student Body should support the organization to the limit. It does not seem that any money will be necessary to put through the program out- lined by the committee. Therefore, it would be very unwise to have a drive for funds this year. Perhaps the Cabinet has no intention of endeavoring to secure funds from the stu- dents this year. There is no doubt that our spirit here is tcrriLlc. Pep wcdi11g::. awl all that gucs \\i th them arc a fine start in the right direction, but waving flags, shouting cheers and mak- ing a lol of noise in gencl'al will not inculcate into our undergraduates what they lack at present-a loyal devotion to their Alma · Mater. The Cabinet would do well to start to im- prove the first floor of Silliman Hall right now. Usually magazines are scattered all over the floor, and the place is in general disorder. The neutral group here needs to have a comfortable place to spend its spare time. At this time it has no such place. Silliman Hall could be made much more home-like with little expense. At least it could be kept in better order.

These three soph<l'- mores, George Melinette, Esmond Gifford and William Green are the first ones chosen under the rotary system of athletic managers adopt- ed by the athletic board last spring. Melinette comes from Brooklyn and is a member of the Chi Psi fraternity. Last year he was on the freshman football squad and a member of the board of The Con- COl diensis and at present is a can- didate business manager of The Mountebanks. Gifford, a member of the Beta Theta Pi fraternity, lives in Saug- erties. During his freshman year and this year too, he has been con- nected with the glee club and choir. Green is a member of Sigma Chi and lives in Brooklyn. (Continued from Page 1) cided to hang the good professor In effigy.

Dain Is Forwa·rd Passer Dain 's remarkable a:bility in both forw-ard passing and open field running has been an i·mpm tan-t fac- tor in Union's offense during the past two seasons. Dain scored half. of Union's eig'ht touchdowns this season and his passes wei e con- veited into four more, making him d-irectly re,pon:;ible for all o·f the scm es. ln the opener of the sea·son, against V\'esleyan, Dain scored Union's only touchdown going over on a line buck from the half-yard line. In the final minutes of the game, his pa.sses were car lied aero~~ for· touchdowns which were. however, not counted becau<e of o -s-ide penalties, and the game ended in a 7-7 tie. Scort'd Against Hobart In the Hobart encounter, which Union won 32 to 0, Dain scm ed three of the five touchd-owns. He threw an 18-yard pass- to Semerad went over for the first score, a-nd shortly after sco1 ed himself fl om the 20-yard stripe after sliding off right tackle and running through a maze of tacklers. He made his second touchdown on a lateral from Semerad followed ,by an 18-yard run. The fourth scme o.f the game came as a result of two Dain passes, one to DiLallo and· one to Stevenson· who -carried the pigskin across the goal line.
