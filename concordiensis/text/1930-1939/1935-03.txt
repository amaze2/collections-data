This tour takes the college singers to five cities in which they Wlll have g·iven seven concerts ·before they return to the Ignaz Frteedman campus on Monday. The first concert was given at T G• R •t } 1o:8o o'clock this morning at the .. 0 IVe eCI a State Normal School here. Three ·numbers were sung there under the l.rl'ire.\t.ion of Thornton W. Whipple, '35, student leader.

Following the concert a dance will be held to the tunes of the Garnet Goblins, college or- chestra which is increasing in pop- ularity after each engagement. The glee club secured the serviees of the college orchestra several weeks ago. Will Stay in Elmira The thirty members of the glee club and the ten members of the band will be housed at the homes of Union alumni in Elmira tonight. All ar:rangemen ts for this lodging were made by Donald C. Hawkes '35, manager of the glee club, who lives in Elmira.

No tickets are avail- able for either concert, admission being restricted as always to mem- bers.

College Favorably Located Proximity to Albany Mall::es Conditions Ideal For Planned Project At a testimonial dinner given Tuesday night in his honor by alumni at the Albany Law School, Dr. Dixon Ryan Fox disclosed plans for inaugurating a new mode in teaching government here at Union, a method by which students will be taught practical politics of 1935. It is his aim to fit college students for government service by modern- izing the study, bringing theory and practice together, and thus to raise Union to leadership in the entire nation in this study. Dr. Fox announced that plans have been made for the students to visit the various branches and offices of government in Albany to study at first hand the vast mech- anism of democratic rule. An ar- rangement is also being made for \interneshlps a .project by which at the end of the school year in June the most promising students will 'be taken into various state offices to work as special employees and also to .study. Union Ideally Placed \The college Is just far enough away from the capitol in Albany, and just near enough to make ideal conditions for the study of govern- ment,\ he said. \Nowhere in the nation is there a college so ideally situated, because at Albany we have the core of government for the greatest state in the Union. In Albany are presented all the prac- tical problems for the government of a great, rich commonwealth.\ He revealed that arrangements have been made for heads of prac- tically all the state departments to lecture to the .otudcnts as part of a planned cour~c of .practical poli- tics which will eventually bdn,s better trained men into government service. Tells of Advantages Dr. Fox also presented to the alumni a new project of activity. In eontrast to the established custom of having alumni scout throughout the country for promis- ing athletic timber, he urged every alumnus to scout for \promising students.\ He reviewed the great- ness of Union in history and tradi- tion, and described the advantages which the university offers in the fields of science, liberal arts, medicine, law, pharmacy, engineer- ing, athletics, social and fraternal life and others. As a result of the try-outs held Monday and Tuesday nights for the third Mountebanks production of the year, William Shakespeare's \Twelfth Night,\ the following cast has been selected: Orsino, :Ouke of Illyria ...•. ,_,,. ''Idol\ Founded by Group as Vehicle of Literary Expression He spoke also on the college's pioneering in the field of dramatics in the. n·a.tional theatre conferences on problems and prospects of the theatre called for July 1, 2, and. 3 on the campus; an eight weeks course on the theatre, and the Mohawk Drama Festival which will include production for the first time of Don Marquis' play \Master of the Revels,\ which concerns Henry VIII, in an outdoor theatre. ................

An article by Weeks later took third prize in the 1928 Phi Gamma Delta National Contest. Although all of these five men were instrumental in the founding of the Idol, first credit must go to Gelsleichter, as he was the first to concieve of the idea and remained a moving force behind the actual founding of the publication. Pro- fessor Herrick, iii whose study the idea of founding a literary publica· tion originated, acted as faculty adviser for the magazine. Gels- lelchter and Harry Lamberton were the first Editor-in-Chief and Busi- ness Manager respectively of the publication.

Leslie Schoolcraft, president of the Sche- nectady Alumni Association would be the toastmaster at the eighth annual Block \U\ rinner which will be held in the Alumni Gymnasium on March 18. As in former years George Daley '92, sports-editor of the New York Herald-Tr~bune, and originator of the banquet, will ·be present. The purpose of the dinner is to honor athletes, many of whom will be present to receive awards for athletic achievement during the year. The Student Council also learned that the college would be unable to support the proposal of Charles Dain and Harold J. Wittner, di- rector of athletics, that the college establish a truble for the two week, pre.,.season, football training period. All the <players will probably eat together as in past yeare but each man will pay for his own meals. ARTICLE I.

And if anyone v.ill take the further trouble to c<H1sult fit·st the calendar and then the files of The Idol, he will notice that March has come and that the first issue is RG far the only issue of the Literary Quarterly. The record of the Idol in the hands of the first board which was freed from the control of the English classes is by no means im- pressive and is far from what was expected of it. The appearance of the November issue late in December could be overlooked because an inex:perienced boa1·d had to publish the magazine unaided (and besides, we had dur- ing the last few yea1·s already beco111e ac'\ custon1ed to the pheno·menon of the Nov- ember issue appearing in December), But there seems to be no reason why the second issue has not made its appearance at this late date; for the thil·d issue should be out by this time and here we have a.s yet heard no -wo1·d about the second issue. We have no fault t() find with the men on the board as individuals. They are cap- able men and much was expected of them.

Although oth.er colleges have not adopted such a complete revision of educational pol- icy, there has been a definite movement to- ward integrating the \book learning\ and the practical, every-day realities of politics, eco- nomics, science, writing, and other subjects. Mere academic study gives the student a false sense of mastery. After several couTses in economics, he can cope with the problems of international exchange, but has difficul- ties with his own budget. There is the per- ennial story of the medieo, fresh from his textbooks, who diagnosed a case of measles as an abscure tropical skin disease. The Union students who a1~e privileged to work in the departments of the state government in Albany for a short period at the end of the school year will probably find that filing- re- ports and answering letters will give them a valuable perspective fo1· political the(}rizing. WATER COLORS EXHIBITED The Schenectady College Woman's Club opened an exhibit of American water C()]ors 111 th0 old Cym Dorm yesterday. Hecently the Geolog-y Department prepared an exhibi- tion displaying graphically the formation of the Mohawk Vallcy. There have been mans other displays of this smt sponsored by stu- nPnt groups and frirnds of the college. This kind of activity is a distinct addition to campus life and deserves the support and appreciation of the student body. Such ex- hibits provide opportunities for students to see or have demonstrated to them in an at- tractive form scientific or artistic phases which might otherwise be overlool{ed. To these ingenuous students, faculty mem- bers, and friends of the college we express our appreciation and a request for more such activities. You're the ties On the Balkan Zabee.

Although it is the ulti mate goal of bot'S the college and the fraternities, any attempt to in stitute such a pledging system might prove disastrous in this period of depression. It seems wise .and practical to conduct a thorough survey of the entire fraternity situation !before in traducing anything new, This is a problem which the fraternities and the administration must solve to gether, The administration should guide, regulate, and encourage fr~~; ternities along constructive lines and not just sit back and list the don'ts and can'ts which they must follow. Two metbods of approach have been tried at other universities with marked success, The most popular one provides for tho selection of someone outside the college to con duct a survey. A man such as Alvan E. Duerr, a staunch worker for the cause of fraternities, and a member . of the National Interfra ternity Conference, who has con ducted such investigations, would probably be able to present a pract ical solution to the problem. The investigator woUld have to formulate answers to the main questions arising from the instltu tlon of deferred rushing. WoUld it bring about financial hardships to individual fraternities causing them to drop their charters? Would the ones driven off the campus be the scholastically, morally, and socially weak, or otherwise? Would it be the best policy at the present, or is there some alternative? The other plan, which has been used successfully at Ohio State, calls for the appointment of an ad minlstrative official within the unl versity itself, to deal with fratern ity problems. The weakness of this plan lies in the necessity of appoint- ing a man capable of handling the position to the satisfaction and benefit of all concerned. This of- ficial would carry on a program similar to that of the outside man, but would continue in his position even after the immediate problems had !been solved. It would be foolhardy for Rut- gers, to institute deferred rushing without fully considering the con- sequences and investigating all other possibilities. Such a move without proper consideration would react unfavorably both upon the fraternities and the University. -The Rutgers Targum Cl<J Trc Stage The team c season night a custom! feat a quintet, broke 1 14 to J score tl since tl twelfth Joe : score fr for the Powers, this to1 though as sis tar and sta in unif< Unior ing oft two-poi' at 9 to Mac FeE TechmE He talli while, ~ foul sh side-sh< Moffett Union 1 onlan : Troy te Mi!aiJ half af1 a free t men c1 lead .an forth a Both t1 result two R. four pe and Se remove were tl Fros] Start Fresl have 1l Troph~ one o'c short c held ai son ou1 ,LaCl'l later il sions v at four Fred V squad. fundan practic weathe E Batt< and fr reques· ium t o'clock sea-son SP: All Sports reques of Atb CH.

Chosen By Students Dr. Fox was chosen by the stu- dents of Mrs. Davis to present the portrait to Columbia because it was he, while professor of history there, in 1926, who inspired them to adopt the policy of 1·eviving American plays in addition to a repertoire of Shakespeare and other Eng·lish playwrights, These students, now the Columbia Laboratory Players, have since achieved international reputation for their splendid re- vivals.

Voting at the May meeting of each year the Board and shall enter upon Idol Speaks in Chapel \Lo1·d What ShalJ This Man Do?\ Is Dr. Park's Theme In Sunday Speech To have the rare ability to dis- agree with people and yet to keep their esteem was one of the ways for a man to find himself, accord- ing to President J. Edgar Park of Wheaton College, who spoke at the services in the Memorial Chapel Sunday morning. Selecting the passage, \Lord what shall this man do?\ as his theme,. Pre)sident Parlt pointed out that \we t))e mickey-mice of some comic strip thrown on the screen of this planet,\ must learn early in life to stir the stagnant pools of thought into the activity that makes life, \Experience is not what happens to man, but experi- ence is what man does to w·hat hap- ·pens to him. The true ex:pelience which makes a great man is get- ting the mind to function.\ Ability to See President Park gave as a re- qukement for futul'e greatness, the ability to see. He said, \It is the great man who can see past the presuppositions of his day and em- brace all opinions. You must side- track this insistent desire to lie about in pools, and think about what is seen. \You must also have the rare ability to disagree with people and yet to keep the esteem in which they hold you. It is not enough to merely think !llbout what is seen, but to dal'e to question in order that some new way of activity be developed. It is only being able to divert the blood from its natural inclination for a pottering life, and to send it up into a creation of a new life.\ 1 m (Continued from Page 1) Junior class during the week next before the second Wednesday in May to serve one year; the Editor- in-Chief and the Business ManB~ger of the Concordiensis; the Editor-in- Chief and the Business Manager of the Garnet; the Editor-in-Chief and Business Manager of the Idol.

Although they were accredited representatives of the Union stu- dent body, the five men, Ralph Cohen, Guy Graves, Carl Olson, Richard Vosburgh and William Boyd, refused to vote in the organ- ization meeting for a · permanent committee to pursue other aims that for which the protest was call-ed. They were joined In this by the Skidmore, Bard College and other delegations. In a statement the Union men issued last night, they deplored the fact that, although they agreed heartily with the N. S. F. A., which sponsored the protest meeting in its opposition to the Nunan Bill, they felt that the actions of certain r.adica:l elements in the group itself and of representatives of other groups were detrimental to the ob- ject and antagonizing to the mem- bers of the Legislature. The gtoup brought to Albany 164 signatures for the petition which had circulated in approximately fifteen schools and which contain- ed more than 7,500 names. There were 187 delegates a:t the meeting, representing pel haps 20,000 stu- dents. The group statement follows: \As representatives of the Union Student body we helped to protest the passage of the Nunan Bill yes- terday, but at the same time we feel that Union could not affiliate <Continued on Page 4) PRICE FIVE CENTS 11 Seniors Named Associate Members Of Sigma Xi Group Scientific, Engineering Stu- dents Win Associate Mem- berships in Honor Society Dietz, Toppan Members Research Student Instructor Honored for Worl{ in Bio- Physics and Geology Eleven Seniors and two graduate students were elected to the Union Chapter of the Society of Sigma Xi at a meeting of the society held Wednesday night, Mr. Frank J.

His teams do not \\'Ill because he bulldozes his men into hurd work He com- bines a rare sense of humor with n. keen knowledge of the game, nnd then~by wins the respect of his squad. This great figure in the world of sport should have something revealing to say to us at Union College. We are not accustomed to nationwide athletic acclaim. Yet, in the na- ture of true Americans we are interested in athletics.

(Special to the Concordiensis) New Ym·k City, March H)-No greater performance has been given by the Glee Club than the one which it gave in the Hotel Astor here Friday night. Dr. and Mrs. Dixon Ryan Fox were present to hear the club sing in a formal con- cert for the first time. Close to four hundred alumni and their. guests were on hand to welcome the Glee Club under the direction of Dr. Elmer A. Tidmarsh and Thornton Whip1:Jle '35. Many of the younger alumni of Union attended the concert, which was followed -by a dance to the music of the Garnet Go·blins. This is the first time in years that this annual event under the sponsorship of the New York alumni association has been so well sup·ported by the young, as well as the older,alumni. The committee in charge was headed by Mr. Stanley Garnjoss '24. The trip to New York was made by ,bus; although it is a long trip .to make by motor, several games of ,bridge helped to lessen the strain of the lengthy drive. The need for study during the enforced absence from the campus of the thirty students making the trip caused many of them to attack their books early yesterday room- ing in an attempt to make up what work will be missed. Organized study hours are being held and every precaution is thereby being taken to help the students maintain their standings. Today, after a short broadcast over the WJZ network, the club headed for Philadelphia to give a concert under the auspices of the Philadelphia alumni association.

The trust- worthiness of his conscience, his ability to pruJs accurate moral ver- dicts, is in direct proportion to these two things,\ declared the Rev. James Gordon Gilkey, D. D., pruJtor of the South Congregational Church of Springfield, Mass., in his sermon Sunday mo1·ning at the Memorial Chapel services on Building a Trustworthy Consci- ence.\ Tracing the development of the moral faculty\ in the human race, Rev. Gilkey showed that in finding the solution to problems of society, men discovered that certain causes of action usually tend to produce social security and happi- ness, while other courses of action tend to produce insecurity and wretchedness. The first courses were termed right, the second wrong.'' As an example of the difficulty of deciding between what is right and wrong, Rev. Gilkey cited the case of a convict, who after escap- ing from a prison in the United States bad established himself in. Canada, under an assumed name winning through hi!! earnestness the confidence and friendship of the people about him. Twenty-five years after his escape, his past was disclosed. The question then arose ruJ to what should be done with him, He had proved his strong moral character but yet he had to pay the price of modern societies' laws. \Sudde11ly brought face to face with such a puzzling problem,\ Rev. Gilkey said, intelligent people try to figure out what course of action will-in the end-probably be most beneficial to the greatest number of individuals affected by it .. in \shorthand\ the speech which of Edward L.

We do not object to the Nunan Dill out of altruistic symp-athy fo1· our fellow student:-; in tax-supported colleges. Sympathy is un- wanted and unnecessary. But we hate to see the members of our state leg·islature make such fools of themselves as to pass such a bill. Aimed at the suppression of commun- ism and other subve1·sive pl'opag·anda among colleg-e students, the measure is as effeetive as punching- a moonbeam. What sort of a communist who sincerely desirerl to pmmote the World Revolution among his classmates would refuse to go through the formality of signing- an oath before paying his tuition?

The team has had a Vel'y succes.sful season this year, having- won three of four meets, the only loss being· to is worthy of recog-nition as a lninot· sport. ••;;;;;====;;;:;;;;;;;;;;;;;;===;;;;;;;==;;;;;;;;======;;;;;;:;;===i:;;;;;;;--'1 ~ . ~~======~~==~ Pl'ospects for successful seasons in the This week Fanago is just lazy, nouncement that anyone who sends By TONY SHAR.l'E) d I t 1 · t f'll th · 1 tl f th 1 1 Helen Henshaw, with her usual ruture are v-el-.Y !tOGd as the tean1 has a an a vo un eer co umms I. s e m a so u on 0 e puzz e, a ong. ~ space nicely: with a. copy of the chart of the U. calm assurance and her .accurate, number of sophomores who did exceilent While listening the other night .to C.

His engineering g-enius and phenomenal mathematical ability won for him the unwanted epithet of ''\.vizard.\ Dr. Steinmetz always objected to anyone's calling his achievements mag·ical; but who can deny that genius is so rare and wonderful that it must be described in extra- ordinary terms? Dr. Steinmetz was as much loved for his own sake as he was admired and respected for his abilities. His genuine interest in stu- dents and student activities, his dry humor, and his sympathetic and effective teachinK won him the aff-ection and friendship of the undergraduates to an extent to which few professors ever attain. He was, in the best sense of an overw01·ked word, an inspiring· teacher. At the annual Steinmetz Memorial lecture Thursday night, the General Electric Com- pany will formally present a portrait of Dr. Steinmetz to the colleg-e which he served so well. We are grateful for this fitting gift, and we look forward to its being hung in a prominent place so that future generations of Union men will not forget him. fcssor Rojanksy be requested to ing given to-day, in the form of slE-ep, likewise were om· c·ompan- prepare one of his ingenious phys- college promotion campaigns, a spe- ion.s.

No team was able to scm·e more than 33 points against Union, M. I. T. being the lone outfit to make this amount. In this game, however, the Garnet rolled up its greatest total of tht' suason, 59 .points, while the subs played aJmost half of the encounter. Perha.ps the greatest accomplish- ment of the season was the fine de- :ensi ve playing aga:inst Syracuse .md Amlwrst. Although Symcuse won, 28 to 21, they received some- thing of a scare. In a remarkable exhibition of guarding, the Union five held the highly-touted Amhent team to 13 points, including only fout· goals from the field. The Alumni ha1 dly did better, tallying only five times from the floor. High Point Totals Union's lowe,;t score was the 21 point>J obtained against Syracuse, while, as has been mentioned, their high!'sl was the 59 rung up against M. I. T.

This is the one opportunity open for e:Vet·yone to ex- tend a gestme e>f appreciation to each of the many campus athletic teams which have rep- l'esented the college, and to encoul'age the coaches who have spent so much time train- ing them. The 1·eception of nn athletic award ceases to be a mere matter of course and as· sumes a personal touch when the presenta- tion is made before a lm·ge group of the stu- dent body, and thai touch is the slightest token of appreciation that stude11ts should bestow upon a deserving athlete. In addition to the obvious attmction offer- ed by the speakers, this dinner is one of the few opportunities left for the college to gather together socially. On a campus as loosely bound as this where a large part of the student body lives within the city we are inclined to forget that we do compose a unity. Only a:t sueh functions as the Block U dinner can we combine our divergent inter· ests and aet as a single body. The Blocl< U dinner has always been a suc- cess. We have only applause for the commit- tees which have arranged this one and the others in the past. We do feel that certain students are not only shir1dng a duty they owe to teams which have represented them, but are actually missing a personally worth- while function. This yeu is an excellent time for the stu- dent body to prove that the spirit which they talk about so much, really does exist by sup· porting one of the few purely college func- tions of the academic year-the Block U dinner. IN HOC SIGNO VINCEMUS The student political movement has been tried by the fire of the reactionaries in high places, and has come th1·ough the ordeal vic- toTious, even if not entirely unscathed. The Nunan Student Loyalty Oath Bill, a target for student jibes and diatribes for the last month was cast out of the Educational Committee of the state Assembly Tuesday by a vote oJ eigllt to five. It had previously been favored for reference to the floor by a vote of seven to four, but it had been held up by three absentees. vincemus. CONGRATULATIONS The ten men who have just Teceived Com- mencement Stage Appointments have been rewarded for four years of constant applica- tion to their studies and for the high scholar- ship, they have gained through this applica- tion. These appointments are not given for fair work nor for excellent work done during part of the college course. The honor is awarded to a student on the basis of his scholarship throughout the full college course. The stag-e appointees have gained the lead- ership of their class in the most important of all the college activities. Eisenbud, Cole, Conlon, Elwyn, Hinman, Ho1-witz, Mathes, Semerad, Slobod and Waldron have succeeded notably in obtaining that education for which they came to Union. They have also been active in many of the extra-curricular activ- ities of the college, and it is of note that they have in numerous cases assumed the same leadership in these activities that they hold in the realm of scholarship. These men have SLlcceeded in an effort that has taken four full years to complete. The administration has recognized the effort they have made and have honored them for it.

Here we bave Kentucky emerg- ing from the shelter of the blue grass to play N. Y. U. in the jam- med Garden. And then there was Drake--! think it was Drake-- swinging around the circuit, plB>y- ing the cream of the coUlts to the tune of about ten games in two weeks. Their jaunt extended from railroad termina:l to railroad term- inal. Incidentally they seemed to have stepped out of their class, for they won only a couple of games. Well maybe they had a lot of fun. Oh, there have been intersectional tilts galore and the game bas be- come too much of a business and victory has become to mean more than victory. Now there Is talk of standardizing the referee so that visiting teams will not be penalized by strange rules. It seems fair and logical, but the rea:! truth of the matter is that certain aggrieved parties are trying to rationalize their defeats. For defeats are costly. Basketball is recapitulating stadiumized football, though on a smaller sca:le, of course. No gym can hold 70 000 people at specula- tors' prices.' But basketball is still a lucrative proposition, a healthy investment. Yes basketball is an investment. So fa~· it hasn't been paying as fat dividends as football. Yet it ha:s gone beyond the stage of self-sus- tenance. It's practical, some will say. Certainly, and there's nothing wrong with that, except that .the word is being used too flextbly when teams play ten games in two weeks. Many of us would lay out our last dollar to see one of those Garden double-headers. They a:re splendid exhibitions of how the game should be played and are worth the price. They are the typi- cal American sports event and ap- pear perfectly harmless. So they appear on the surface, yet even a superficial observation of the tone of the newspaper Iea:ds indicates a growing tendency towards exploita- tion. The fabulous \six:ty million- aires\ of the Madison Square Gar- den Corporation are adding the colleges to their performing troupe to delight the crowd side by side with Mr. Curley's wrestlers. \East is East and West is West and never the twain shall meet.\ Kipling's famous adage is no longer heeded. Not only do we have East meet West, but Southeast meet Northwest and all the other permu- tations. As long as the game is confined to a single section the op- portunities for exploitation are lim- ited. Once given the range of the entire country to make matches, then the promoters will run ram- pant. Then the condition that made stadium football possible with all its attendant evils exists. Then, like the Notre Dame Ramblers, we'll have the Westminister Wan- derE'rs and the Pitt Pullmans. There will be \basketbaH bums\ just as there are \tennis bums\ and \track bums.\ There Will be wholesale recruiting and Carnegie reports-all over a game which should remain a game and not be- come a business.

IDNMAN History \Ghosts\ Tells Of Freedom Struggle Ibsen Attacks Social Inequal- ities Existent in Nor- wegian Family Against the sombre background of a NoLWegian fjord the Alving family will make its way to the in- evitaJble tragic climax of \Ghosts\ by Henrik Ibsen next weekend, when the Mountebanks present the second production of the current subscription season in their theatre in Hanna Hall. One of the greatest social tra,g- edies of today, \Ghosts\ was written by the man who started the re- action against the sugary senti- mentalism of Victorian era as it manifested itself in England and America. In its place he put a series of plays treating· social prob- lems, lying deeper than the morals of any one nation. Ibsen has been translated into Ge1•man, English, French, Italian and many other languages, yet he has never lost his living force as a dramatist. Story of \Ghosts\ \Ghosts\ itself is the story of the revolt of a woman against the narrow standards of bet• lime. Forced to live with a dissolute and dissipated husband, forced to send her child away that he might not become polluted by the atmosphere that his father created in the house, she has come to question that which those about her hold to be the sacred truth. Hemmed in by the convention that kept her 'bound to a man who had caused her every unhappiness, she has resolved to do penance for him ·by using the money he left her in building an orphanage. Helping her in this is Pastor Manders a conscientious but hide-bound cler.gy- man, who typifies the forces against which she is struggling. Mrs. Alving is hopeful that the dedication of the orphanage . will remove the shadow of her husband from her home, but when her son comes home infected iby the father's weaknesses, the tragedy results. The cast for the production, which is directed by Edward L. Carroll is as follows: Mrs. Alving, Miss Mary :McGee; Oswald Alvlng, Wallace T. Foote; Regina Engstrand, Miss Bethia Doyle; Pastor :Manders, s, Ralph Cohen; Jacob Engstrand, Abraham Smith. The settings have ;been designed by August Swyka and lighted by Benjamin Brown. L. B. EISEN13UD, rhysics (Valedictorian:) S. HORWITZ Cltemistry R. D. SEMERAD English D.R. CONL@N Cltemistry Jonathan Edwards, Second Union President, Lived Among Indians Upon the resignation of Dr . .John Blair Smith, the trustees appointed a committee to nominate his suc· cessor to the presidency of the col' lege, and in February, 1799 this committee proposed the name oi the Rev. William Linn, of New York City. For reasons unknown, Dr. Linn declined the nomination, whereupon the board, in May, 1799, elected Dr . .Jonathan Edwards, the son of Jonathan Edwards the great New England theologian, who be- came President of Princeton just before his death. Dr; Edwards brought to Union the rare intellect- ual and spiritual traits, and the rich experience gained through thirty years of ·professional life. He was a man of unusual gifts, re- peating in his own person many of the remarkable qualities Of his dis- tinguished father. His death, in 1801, was a serious blow to the col- lege and deeply affected the whole community. Jonathan Edwards, the younger D. D., the second president of Union College was born at North- ampton, Mass., on May 16, 1745. When he was six years old his father moved to Stockbridge, Mass. to take charge of the Indian school and mission at that place. The boy Edwards live-d for nearly seven years among the Mohegan Indians, these ·being the nearest neighbors to the family. In 175-8 his father moved again, this time to Prince- ton, N.J., to assume the presidency of the College of New .Jersey, but died the following March. His wife also died -in October of the same year, so that the 'boy was left an orphan at the age of thirteen years. Determined to get an educa- tion he entered, with the atd of friends of the family, the grammar school at Princeton, in February, 1760. In September of the following year he entered t.he College of New Jersey, from which he graduated five years later. On leaving college he began the study of theology, and in October, 1766 was licensed to preach. The next year he was appointed tutor in his alma mater, which office he held for two years. He then be- came past<>r at White Haven, Conn., where he remained for more than twenty-six years, until 1795. In 1796 he ·became pastor of the cburch at Colebrook, Conn. Here he preached for three years, until his election in 1799 to tbe presidency of Union. He assumed the duties of this office in .July of the same year, but had only had opportunity to show his fitness fot· the position when a fever brought on his death, on the first day of August, 1801. \He was a mighty antagonist of all those who seemed to him to pervert the faith once delivered to the saints,'' a commentator on his life writes, \but his heart was tender to the poor and distressed.\ President Edward~; was buried in the churchyard of the First Pres- byterian Church of Schenectady.

Bob Crosby, the younger brother of the famous radio crooner, is himself a:n outstanding performel\ both on the radio and in the mov- ies, and bids fair to equal .the pop- ula:rity of the older Bing. Kay Weber, brilliant young Broadway charmer, will also be featured and together with Crosby wm· furnish a number of new and entertaining novelty numbers. At l'alais Royal The Dorsey Brothers' Orchestra has just finished a long run at the Sand's Point Beach Club, and is at present playing at the Palais Royal on Broadway in the heart of New Yorlt City. Both regarded as musi- cians of the highest order, Tommy Dorsey on the trombone and . .Jimmy on the clarinet and saxo- phone, have both served appren- ticeship on severa:l of the bette!\ radio bands, among whom are the original California Ramblers and both Paul Whiteman's and Jean Goldkette's orchestras. Setting the trend .for modern music they have been best-sellers on phonograph re- cordings for the last five years in their own right, as well as serving a:s accompanists for such lumin- aries as Bing Crosby, Ruth Etting, Connie Boswell and the Boswell Sisters, and other artists equally exacting in their orchestra require- ments. Accomplished Instrumentalists The Dorsey Brothers in building their organization have secured the services of only the most accom- plished instrumentalists, and under the direction of Tommy Dorsey they are not only creating the most favorable comment wherever they play, but are also establishing a wide national reputation for smooth sync-opation. Under the very same management which pushed Glen Gray and his Casa Lorna orchestra to the top, the Dor- sey Brothers are fast following the successful road blazed by their famous predecessors. They now have future engagements to play the winter season in the smart Col- onades of the Essex House in New York. Impressed by their brilliant per- formance at the Sands Point Club, the National Broadcasting Com- pany persuaded the board of gov- ernors of this private club to per- mit them to broadcast the Dorsey Brothers' scintillating rhythm, a style of music not only fresh a:nd up-to-the-minute, but polished to the nth degree. As a result this band has been malting a sensa- tional rise to national favor. \The likelihood, at present, of one not belonging to a fraternity being elected to the Junior Prom commit- Distinctive Music Unique arrangements and expert technique in exPcution have com- bined to make their music distinc- tive and melodiously smooth.

In the 1933-34 season he led the Garnet with 1Z8 points in 14 games. 0 Four Veterans Eepol't For Varsity Tennis Practice After the first week of indoor practice, the tennis team has limbered u-p to such an ex:tent that predictions for the coming season can be made. On the strength of t};leir showing on the courts last spring and fall, the four varsity holdovers are fairly certain to re- tain their berths. Captain George Stroebel, the best tennis player on the squad, will pro'ba:bly play number one singles and number one doubles, along with- Jack Moffett, the only two-year veteran on the squad. Joe Cohen and Austin Fox, the other veterans of the 1934 campaign, will have little difficulty in securing positions in both singles and double competition. Coach Aydelotte likes to arrange his doubles teams from the same classes in order that he can work his same combinations each year. This will be the second str.aight year the Stroebel-lVIoffett combina\ tion. Cohen did not play doubles last year, while Fox played very little. The remidnder <Jf the squad does not appear to •be too promising on the indoor court. Since three of the 'lleterans are facing their last cam- paign on the courts for the Garnet, it is prabable that Aydelotte will endeavor to devel<lp as many soph- omores as possible in an effort to build for future cam.]laigns. Bernie Salad and Julian 'D<Jc' Orton, bath of whom reac·hed the semi-finals and quarter finals 'respectively of the fall tennis tournament, are the most pramising prospects from the class of 1937. Salad has the larger repertoire of strokes, while Orton is a steady player.

Anderson Assistant Editors F. Gage N. Stewart Tuesday, March 19, 1935 WHERE WERE THE ALUMNI? The handful of alumni present at the Block 'U' Dinner last night is not an indication that that group has matched the pace at which the re-st of Union's family has swung into the tide of rising prosperity in the upswing- of Union's morale and prestige. The few alumni who were noted among those present are the old standbyes of the local alumni ranks. Ceriainly the event which honors those glamorous athletes received sufficient pub- licity in The Concordiensis and the two local dailies to reach the homes of the hundre<ls of alumni who live in Schenectady. Coach Cris- lel' spoke of crabbing alumni who voice their d,issatisfaction after defeats. Union is no ex- ception-many of our alumni expr.essed their disapproval last Fall when the varsity eleven found itself on the short end of the score afte1· three of its contests. Likewise many expressed their joy when the eleven came out on top in four games. Similarly appl'Oval and disapproval is voiced in connectio-n with other varsity athletic teams. The student body responded much l;etter proporiionately than did the alumni group as was evidenced by the attendance at the dinner. Those who prove that they can give as well as take on the athletic field are feted but once a year. It is only fitting that th-e alumni as well as the undergraduates should take the trouble to pay high tribute to Union's athletes. IMPORTANT WEEKEND COMING The forthcoming week-end is one <>f the most important of the calenda1· year for Union College. Close to one hundred second- ary school students will visit the campus for three days and in that time will form opin- ions of Union which may or may not deter- mine they wiil seek their higher education on this campus.

We believe that fencing should be added to the inte1·collegiate athletic program, but it is fair to take all relevant matters i11to con- sideration before making a definite decision. JOHN JOSEPH KUTTLER The class of 1935 lost one of its heartiest men on Sunday when John Joseph Kutt1er passed away after an illness of more than two months caused by an automobile acci- dent during the Christmas recess. He was not prominent on the campus for any out- standing e-xtra-cmTicular achievement, but he had many friends who mourn his passing. Quiet, studious, conscientious 'Jack' was one of the most faithful scrubs on the varsity football squad for three years. Seldom did he crash into the lineup, but he nev.ex flinch- ed in practice. The world needs more men like OUI' late classmate; he had what it takes to be suc- cessful,-tlle will to win and loyalty to the end. His cheery smile has been mis.sed by his friends and classmates since he has been con- fined to the hospital. Everyone has antici- pated his return to the classroom and hoped for his quick recovery from injury. Now that all such hop€ is gone, we ·shall miss him more than ever for he has gone to a place from whence there is no return passage.

It would indeed be easy to start another fraternity al- though it would not be awfully nice for the C()Jlege under the circum- stances. But the neutrals are just the pel}ple who from lack of In- clination, lack of funds or lack of time, cannot do it. To be a fratem- ity member takes a lot more than ·inclination and personality. It takes se>me money, more time than many students who are working their way through can afford and a. ':\illingness to submerge the in- drvJdual tD the mores of the group. The fraternity, moreover, sh()uJd be subor·dinate to the college, and as members of the student body, the neutrals deser·ve more than they az:e ~etting. Mr. Morrison's im- phcatlOns as to politics may not be founded, but the fact that the N':utra~s miss out ·on many other thmgs Js. They pay as much to the c?llege, ow~ it and pay it more drr~ct allegiance than do the frat- ermty mep. If they make their way and .get soone sort of prestige ~hey have done it despite a fratern- Ity rather than. With its aid. It is all very well to hold up Union as the \mother-of frBJtevnities,\ but it's not too well to have her the \step- mother of neutrals.\ ,. . . A collEge union, w·here· the neu- trals might meet, might entertain friends who come to see them or the campus, or might hold dance~ or entert.uinments is a definite need We are told that in the administra- tion building plans for a col!egt: union have been gathering dust for quite a time now. The cost is esti· mated at $25,0000. Even thouch we risk the chance of having th~ roof of Silliman fall on our heads, we are to ask this question. Why can't Uni.on do as Syracuse did and levJ a five dollar tax on each student for the next six years until the money is raised? Or why can't we borrow the money with the student body, not the college, as collateral? .. . .

BEDELL It .seems that the stal-.~,rart sons of old Union ran for more than the glory of their Alma Mater back in the dim days of the early nineties. The :Mid-Winter meet of the Union College Athletic Association was held in the State Armory, Match 19, 18~4. It was in this year that Kil- patl:ick, supposedly one of the co- holders of the pi esent mile record at Union, ()arne into prominance. According to the Cuncordy of that time, the most exciting event of the meet was the quarter-mile run. Kilpatrick: won the race, with Allen. taking second. For their efforts the winners received a pair of pants and a .pair of sleeve buttons.· C1>ntestants in the shot pat were awarded \·Macaulay's History of England\ and nickle-plated dumb bells.

Union College takes pleasure in welcoming its many campus guests this weekend. The Concordiensis takes this oppol'iunity to ex- press the note of welcome which the student body feels toward you. We hope that you will enjoy your visit and find it both inter- esting and educational. Union stands as a center of learning; to show you that this it; true, the students, together with th.e faculty II anniversaries. It wm :aot only begin the 131st II year in dramatics on the campus, but it will IJ mark the sixth birthday of the little campus l .. ltheatee which was opened March 21, 1929, following an intensive campaign, by a group of seniors, for funds. 1\Ir. E:azer, theH busi- ness manager of the Mountebanks, headed that successful campaign. What is perhaps most important is flower- ing of the ambitions held by the Mounte- : bnnks in 1929 during these seven. years under i the directioH of the able, likeable, and stimu- I'Jlating l\fr. Carroll. When th.e college drama- 11 tic society had to hire down-town theatres 1.1 for their play.s, few were the· rehearsals, ,., fewer were the productions. Mr. Carroll II promised that with a theatre on the campus, 1.1 at least three plays of high merit would be giveH each season in addition to other dram- • a tic activities. What is the record ? From a handful of · students in ante-1929 participating· in the various activities that coopemtively result in a dramatic production, the number has g-rown to about 100 today. In addition to II three regular productions, the Mountebanks ·present a monthly series of plays over WGY and letters (some from as far away as In- diana), indicate that this educational and en- tertaining series is appreciated. And then ·the road trips of the Mountebanks are an- other great service to the college, and of course an added opportunity for exciting ac- tivity for the students participating. But perhaps most important of all is the amazing increase in student attendance at the :\Iountehanks performances. Once the .Mountebanks were content with one perform- ance, usually not too well attended. Since Mr. Carroll became director, and €specially since the theatre opened on the campus, at least two performances were required to seat the increasing number of student patrons. This year a regular three perfol'mance sched- ule fol' each production has been scheduled to seat the 400 to ·150 students who attend.

Here are GeeBee's selections for the 1935 All-American dance orches- tra team: Without doubt a large percentage of the Class of 1935 will sever' their connections with Am-herst almost completely after Commencement this June. Either their distance from New England or a complete loss of interest will keep them from becoming alumni in fact as well as in name. To them .Amheust wili mean only the memo1-y of four years of undergraduate life. To a majority of the class, how- ever, Amherst .probably will con- tinue as m01•e than .a memory. They will return occasionally to the College; they will give thought for the welfare of the College; they wilt contribute toward the activities of the College as far as their income · permits. But the loyalty of some of them will never get bElyond an im- mature and unintelligent stage. To these \prep school\ alumni the fate of the College will depend on the result of the Willkuns game each fall. Their interest ;vii! .be almost entirely in the physical sidP of the College-in hovv many new buildings are being built and in how much publicity A.mherst is getting in the newspa.pers. When they return t{) their fraternity houses, their chief an:xiety will •be about how many \hot rocks\ were pledged during the fall rushing season and how many- members of the house are known on campus for their preoccupation with extra- curricular activities. This loyalty will be no great asset t<J Lhe College. * .. >I< Poot· M1·. Cole Potter, who wrote \'ou'rt> lotH' Top, as you remember, receives in a month 300 versions of his tuneless success.

Chip was a great asset to the 1934 nine be- cause of his great fielding ability and the fact that he was a steadier of the men playing· on the team with him. It is going to be hard to fill the hole left by Chip, al- though there are several men who plan to attempt the job. Coach Hatfield is going to try to juggle this year's nine as little as possible from the veterans of last year's team. The head mentor lost but two men from the fine com- bination he had last season-bain and Burg Garrison, captain of the 1934 nine. who was lost through graduation. The rest of the squad ha-s come back for another year of battle for the Dutchmen. Three Sure Positions As far as the coach can see now, there are but three positions and the pitching staff that are at all certain- Captain Ralph Semerad has his old center field position well in the bag and Jim Loomis seems :pretty well fixed in the left field post. Both of these men ha:ve fine throwing arms, are good at bat and know how to cover their places excellently. Loomis also ean be used as a relief pitcher if the going gets tough for the Dutchmen. The catching position is well taken care of by AI Stevenson as it was last year. Steve is a steady, de- pendable pla:yer who played every game last year and whose experi- ence is going to be a large factor ln the destiny of the 1935 nine. Among the other veterans who will return for service this year are the pitchers, Guy Griswold and George Clark. Clark -was used mainly on first base last year, but Hatfield is pla:nning to use him for pitcl1ing this year if Ernie Brown, a sophomore, can come through and hold down the initial sack satisfactorily. Griswold had an exeellent record for his: pitching efforts last year and is counted on a great deal for this campaign. ~ght For Second men answered the freshman men-. w1'll br··rlg h\ t· d t ? 02 I IS 1me own o _: · distance in 54.4.

The right field position is an- other question. Paul Campbell, Lloyd Clark, and Barbagaletta, all sophomores, are all trying for the position and here again it will be a question of which one produces.

The Gazette Press PRINTERS Greetings- The second ba-se position at pres- ent seems to be a fight between Mike Fiore, who held down that post last season, and Ray McDow- ell, captain of this year's basketball team, who has been a member of the varsity squad before. It all de- pends oB. which one produces the goods as t(} which one of them will be on the field in the opening game. Shortstop is a big position at pres- ent. This is the position left vacant by Chip Dain. There are four men who could play at short though some of them are as good on third.

Gage Tuesday, March 26, 1935 THOUGHTFUL RUSHING A proposed rushing plan for this colleg-e is submitted to the students a11d printed else- whel'e in this issue of The Coneordiensis under the title \In the l\IaiL\ In view of tile recent weekend during ·which close to two hundred sub-freshmen wet·e the guests of the fratel'llities and the colleg·e, it would be wise to consider the n-ecessity for a change at this time. It has been reported that several fratern- ities endeavored to emplu;y the most cut- throat means in order to rush desimble men who were the guests of other groups. The. purpose of the past weekend was to enter- tain our guests, not as we do nt the begin- ning of the college year, but in a manner in which we would assume tlwt our guests had no intention ·Of eve1· attending Union College. Fnder such conditions, it IS hardlr feasil>Ie to expect that o1·dinary eleventh hour rush- ing· tactics are conducible toward fostering good will. The plan presented by J\lr. Sherin is in- tended to wipe out all possibility of cunning tricks of the rushing trade. It suggests that theh system in vogue at Union College lacks peoper organization, organization which is e&sential to a democratic flnm of rushing. We feel that the proposed plan is too restrict- ing; it suggests that the frate1·nities cannot be trusted to do their biddh1g; in an efficient, honest manner. The fault does not lie in the method of bidding·; it Hes in the method of rushing which we feel is too wide-open. A system tltat provides for definite dates for each rushee, aiTanged in advance and without pre- judice from any somce would be commend- able to the ingenuity of the fraternities. It is sig-nificant to note that this is the first plan that has been presented for con- sideration excepting for the sug·,g·estions that have appeared in The Concoroiensis. During the Fall the Student Council appointed its own committee to look into the possibilities of a revision. To date no V!Ol'd has reached the student body to prove that that commit- tee has not been sleeping, We congratulate you, Mr. Sh-erin, even though we should not like to stand on the front porch and wonder what the 'fraternity committee' would send to us. THE OONCORDIENSIS, TUESDAY, MARCH 26, 1935 THE ARMS RACE The abrogation of the V e1·sailles Treaty by Adolf Hitler, although sudden, was n<Jt un· expected by students of history and inter- national affairs. The }lattern of succeeding events after the World War indieated Vel.'Y clearly the ultimate stage in European rela- tions where Gel'll11.my would do as she did a few days ago. l\Iost people who are acquaint- ed ·with the complete set of facts regarding the V ersaiHes Treaty realize that this docu, ment is the outstanding diplomatic blunder . of aU time. These same people will not COI1- demn Germany for failing to live up to a.n ag-reement that the other parties, whieh also pledged themselves, have ceased to cher.ish long since. The Allies have been fe~n·ing the reckoning day when they \vould have to deal with a strm~gly a1·med Reich. France and the other powe1·s have been arming th.emselves stead- ily since the War with this fear as the coll- scious m0ti ve. The arming· has not been UI1- duly extensive, but has been ever prese11t. Of course, as Hitler points out, this activity · wa& not in accordance with the treaty. Now, howevet·, due to Germany's open denunci- . ation of all obligations to the peace pact, a smouldering fire has burst into flam.e. Openly Russia, France, Great Britain, and numerous smal'ler Balkan nations which :fear theh return of the Hapsburg- era, are ex- citedly preparing for a coHflict which they feel must inevitably carne. We see a frantic search for allies just as before the Great Wat·. Armies and navies are swelling faster and faster. l\Iunitions stocks are rising. The situation is grave. No one knows ex- actly to what it will lead. Furthet·more, we in America are partly responsible for present conditions. The United States would not allow President Wilson, who, we t·ealize no\\\ had more foresight than any of us, t0 use the more sympathetic tactics to pe1·suade Germany to sign a peace pact that would be agreeable to her instead of forci11g an impos- sible set of conditions upon her against her will. Hefusing to take this sane and sensible viewpoint, Americans wanted revenge; they, and the other allies wanted to see Germany suffei\. Now we are 1·eaping the harvest of om unChristian efforts. Experience has shown that unlimited arming must even- tually be followed by war. l\Iust we pay the terrific price again simply because of the blind, unsympathetic animal hate inherent in mankind '! Can we not nfford to l0se the blood from a superficially wounded pride mon than the Llood from mutilated human bodies? UNION vs. SKIDMORE Tonight will witness the first showing of a Skid more play in the l\Iountehanks theater. The Omnibus Players of that college will pre- sent John 1\lasefield 's ''Tragedy of Nan\ thet\e tonight. The performance of \Ghosts\ at Skidmore Thmsday ha.s been cancelled be- · cHuse of an epidemic of measl.es there. The advance sale for the Skidmore presen- tation promises a good attendance. In all fail'- ness to the J\Iountel.Janks, who have done mo1·€ fo1· the campus this year than h1 any previous season, the student body should turn out in gi·eat nurnbers fol' tonig-ht's per- formance. The complaint was registered at the time that the Columbia Players pre- sented \Clari\ that the p1·ice of admission was too hig-h. Consequently the Mounte- banks have maneuvered to secure the Omlli- bus Players for the students st the low p1·ice of fifty cents per seat. Those who enjoyed \Ghosts\ will find great pleasure in tonight's performance. There is a striking note of similarity in the two plays and consequently those who at- tend tonight should reap g-reat delight in the Skidmore presentation of \Tragedy of Nan.\ We feel that there is an u1terio1· result to be expected from the interchang·e of plays tonig~ht. The success of tonight's venture holds in the balance the possibility of future performances. It is customa1·y for Uni()n College students to visit Skidmore-h€re is a chance to bring; Skidmol'e to our campus regularly. Here is an opportunity to pe1.·- pet11ate the friendly feelings which have existed fol' so long·. ·~~·. ==Fa~rr=ag=o====:;:t MUSIC Uy TONY SHARI'E ~~============~ These kids' diseases aren't aU over a lean, decisive jaw.

Friedma·nn's ltudy in thirds was nigh on to per- fect, and the Butter fly Etude and Black Key Etude wer·e particularly 'tohi:illing. All consider eel, Fr·iedmann 's in- ter,ptetations were authentic and highly pianisiic to anyone who un- derstood what he was playing. illveryone the writer contacted, was deeply moved by Friedmann, and . all left the concert well pleased with his performance.

We have since confirmed our opinio11 with people whose judg- ment we regard highly, so that at least we are not alone in our stu- pidity. And so we still maintain that Mr. Friedmann gave the most un-artistic, unsympathetic, boring, soul-deadening performance we have yet to hear, with the possible exception of Gordon Balch Nevin.

North Students are prone to feel that athl€tics • serve to cnny the name of a c0Hege farther than any 0ther function of the college. If this is true, the students should get behind.· this move and show the administ1·atioll, the • · bom·d of trustees, and the athletic depart-. ment that they want this additi0n. If the sentiment is stl·uug, and the powers that be'. realize the advantages of the addition of this spo1·t, it follows that al'l'angements will be made, if possible, to fulfill this desire of the Rtudcnts. THERE I~ NO SANTA C'LAUS Students do not always realize the extent to which private colleges .Ju,ve depended upon giftg, anct gifts alone, for the- improve- ment and expansion of their teaching faci'l~ ities. One good look around the Union cam- pus will show that this statement is true. Nearly every building is named either for the donor or for the person or group in ··whose memory the funds were given. Oper- · ating costs and current expenses swallow up both the interest on endowment and fees from students. There is nothing left over · for permanent improvement, for new build- ings, for long-term planning. For these we · still depend on Santa Claus. Right now there is a fom1idable list pinned on our college stocking for the good saint's attention. A student union is probably the most needed improvement, but freshemen's dormitories, an infirmary, an adequate li- bl·ary, better quarters for economics, political . science and psychology classes, and many other necessary little items would be greatly · View of St. Andrews University THE COLLEGE WORLD By FRED FELDMAN jlr=~T~h~e=Bo~o~k=C=o~rn~e~r=~ By JAMES BREWSTER, . IJb.rarian Union Collection (Cont'd.) The next class of gene1 al interest after history is· UJ-biographies of Union men. Naturally some of the lives of Union's numerous brood ate worth special mention. First, wlth~ out any ·question, is \Memoirs of Elipha·let Nott\ begun by Cornelius Van Santvoord but revised and ..completed by Tayler Lewis·. The ec- clesiastical side of Dr. Nott's life is stressed, his inventive ability is hardly mentioneq and controversial points a11e slurred over. With all its faults, however, it is the only real biography we have of this wonder- ful man. One of the great needs of the College is a new, full and· frank !Jiography of him. Ther-e is a rumor that such a biography was started once, but the author found so many unsavory dealings of Dr. Nott, he abandoned it. Eliphalet Nott may have been high-hande'd and a dic- tator but he needs. no apologist. The ·more his life is studied. the greater he becomes. Lately a nrure deter·- mined effort has been mad·e to leat·n of any new activities he may have been engaged in, and a number of important ones have been re-discov- ei·ed. ·The sources of· these· discov- eries, if they may. b.e .called s0, ai·e old periodicals and newspapers, not the college records, Raymond or Van Santvoord.

The list could be length- ened but it will suffice to pick out only one more name. for special mention-Philip Spencer of the class of 1843. His. father . was an a:lumnus of Union, class of 1806, and ve1:y prominent in s~ate and na- tional politics, being Secretary of War· in President Tyler's cabinet froin 18!U-3 and Secretary of the Treasury in 1843. ~hilip, however, remained in college only .one year but in that one year became one of the founders of the Chi. Psi frater- nity. On leaving college he. received an appointment as midshipman in {he Navy and was appointed to the U. S. Brig 'Somers' which shortly left on a foreign cruise. Spon after- ward the country was startled to hear that the Captain of the 'Som- ers,' Alex Mackenzie, had hung for mutiny Philip Spencer and three members of the crew. Such sum- mary punishment on the son of the Secretary of War raised a tremen- dous outcry and the court-martial of the Captain was the Lindbergh trial of its day. ·The library haB t11e account of the proceedings with a concise report by Jame.s Fenimore Fridar, March 29, 1935 THE QUESTIONAIRE REVEALS A plea.sant suqn·ise gleaned from the qmstionaire as pn•sented in chapel 011 Tues- day is the number of 1·equests for a crew at Cnion.

THANI\S TO A SUPPORTER Tangible encomagement was offered to future footLall players of .Union College when tmphy awards were pt·esented yesterday mo1·ning to two out::->tanding members of last semmn's team. The underg;ra.duate body owes to Mr. H. Laurence Achilles, the donor of these prizes, a debt of gratitude for the per- sonal interest he has always shown in the welfare of campus life. His furthee pledge of a permanent trophy to be engraved next year and every year thereafter with the Several of the more prominent prcpara- name of the player making the greatest progress in a single season expresses a still deeper concern for campus activities. That such whole-hearted support of an will be interested in attending a college that athletic team should arise from a faculty tory schooLs maintain cre\vs and natmally the students who participate in this sport has its own crew. Williams College attracted a larger number of students this year than member ought to rouse the student body and f.orce them to take a stronger interest in the p1·evious!y pt·inclpally because it has reduced campus life of which they are supposed to its age-old Latin requirement. Union could likewise attract a greater number of prep- aratory school men if it had such a sport as rowing on its intercollegiate athletic program. be a vital part. Howeve1; strong the .support which the faculty, alumni and friends of the college offer; we cannot develop undergmd- uate affaii·s to the utmost until each individ- ual student shows an active interest in the naany activities around him.

In the morning, though, it's dif- ·ferent ... You still like to think of her as a goddess, but if she's a new girl to your fraternity brothers they ask you if she's intelligent and can she speak and can she say anything . . . And if you've taken her to d:mces before she didn't look so good last night or she's lost a lot- too much in fact, or something ... There's always somebody W•ho thinlts she isn't intelligent, because she talked too much when she was dancing with him, or she didn't say a word or She didn't like the song especially and it's pretty good he thinks ... Anyway it doe.sn't matter whether there's anybody like that, or whether he does say things like that, because you know she's intel- ligent. That is, she danced as if she could read your thoughts, and .she was so understanding when you told her about your courses and your career and she certainly could see your jokes fast enough . . . Anyway, you probably wouldn't take a girl without bt•ains to a dance . . . And you know for sure that you wouldn't marry a girl unless you were sure she had an IQ of somepla:ce over a hundred ...

Tc wit: who are those public spirited ~entlemen who run theit· gas bug- gies over the lawns? Why have the g-entry ele~ted that spot of g1ound just south of South Dorms as a likely spot upon which to turn a1ound? And why do I always bog down going up the hill to the run- ning track'? I expect to leave a rubber or so there any day. Campus-cop Tom vvas in a qua.ndry the other day.

To Have Lively Club Despiteithe fact that there are a geeat ma~y men on the squad with a minimum of training, Coach Harkness· ·believes that he will have a lively club this season. A young and aggressive squad will heJ.p bolstei· up the lacL·os.se team which every year has been seriolllSly affected by the number of men who playecl as regulars for only one sea- son and then graduated. \One brig-ht feature of this sea- son's team,\ said Harkness in a re- cent interview, \is that many of the men out for lacrosse will be here for two years and will have plenty of experience as regulars before be- coming seniors. In the past fi.ve years every graduation almost -wiped out the lacrosse team.\ No Positioll,\l Safe . Although 11 men who returned to the squad this spring played on the varsity last year, none of the po- .sitions are safe. Freddy Wyatt's freshman stick-wielders are making strong bids for places and will probably secure varsity berths be- fore the opening game on April 20. The first practice during the spring vacation will be held Wed- nesday afternoon, and every day afterward until the end of the re- cess will be· taken up with drills and practices. Within the next ten days ot• so the squad will be cut in order that practice sessions will be facil- itated. Spil\:ed Shoe Society To Hold An All-Colleg·e Meet The fourth meeting of the reor- ganized Spiked Shoe society was held Wednesday evening in the 'l'I·ophy room of the Gymnasium. During the business ~ession, plans were discussed for a proposed All- College track meet to be held in the ,qpring and sponsored by the society. ll was proposed that members of the society act· as officinls during the meet and that cups and medals be awarded to winning contestants. It was also pt•opoHed to give a suit- able award to the fraternity enter- ing the largest number of men in the meet. A committee consisting of Leah- man Nestle and Mau.s Stearns was appointed to audit the treasurer's accounts. John Argersinger, Charles Krull and Leon Saiewitz were chosen as the entertainment com- mittee for the next meting. After being dormant for several years the Spiked Shoe ~ociety was reorganized this year, holding its first meeti11g on Feb1 uary 21. The society now has a merr.bership of eighteen track men. Meetings are held on the first Wednesday of each month at 8 p. m. in the T1 ophy room. Owing to the spring reces~. the next meeting will not be held until April 10. -------o----- Eighteen Candidates Try For Varsity Golf Squad Eighteen men reported to Coach Philip Stanley at the first me e. ing of varsity golf candidates Wednes- day afternoon in the Gym. Of this group, the largest to report since the inception of the sport nine year\ ago, two men are veterans, Captain Bob Langer and Bill Christian. Coach Stanley, is highly satisfied with the quality of matel'iai report- ing, especially that from the soph- omore class. The candidates are: Captain Bob Langer, Ken Brown, Jflarl Travis, Ralph Thatcher, George Truex, Bill Christian, AI Stewart, Joe Fields, Richard Vosburgh, Ray Casey, Phil Little, Monroe Froelich, Van Waldron, Willia:ni. Jenkins, John Emans, Jack Wittke, Art Sherin, ·Clark Cummins. In accordance with the arrange- ments made with the Mo:hawk Golf Club 1 the squad will be cut to eight men in a.bout th~·ee weeks.
