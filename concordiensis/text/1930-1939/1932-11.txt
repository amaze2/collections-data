Larrabee of the department of phi .. losophy at Union. The article deals chiefly with the father and grandfather of Willia!U James the phUosopher and Henry James the novelist, ·both of whom lived in Al- bany about a centu·ry ago. William .Tames, the elder, the founder of the family of fortune, is revealed for the fir.st time as the financial backer of President Eliphalet Nott in his lottery operations from 1821 to 1826, when Jam~s held a mort- gage on all the rear estate owned by the college as security for a loan of $100,000.

Melinette THE TEMPORARY ABOLISHMENT OF SOIREE With the abolishment of Soiree this year aris- es the thought of changing the date next year, so that the dance may be better supported and be given at a more apprepriate time. It has been suggested that it be given on the night previous to one of the football games. If Soiree were held on a Friday night before a football' game, it would induce more men to bring guests to the campus for the week-end and there would be a better attendance at both Soiree and the football game. The Saturday night fra- ternity dances could be held as before. Solree has never been properly supported here,. because of the fact that it always has been held at the most impractical time of the year, particularly from a financial point of view, due to the nearness of Christmas. By holding Soiree before one of the home football games, it would .allow fraternity houses to hold dances on this occasion, which might be otherwise impossible, since they could not afford to hold dances after a football game and then following Soiree. There also arises the question of holding Sat- urday night dances later than twelve o'clock. The admin:tstration has ruled that this shall be for- bidden, but it might wen be abolished. It seems to be at the present time one of those in- describable \necessary evils\ which should be ab- rogated. Saturday night dances are allowed to ·be held until one o'clock during Daylight Saving Time, which is in itself only an admission of the idiocity of the existing evil. More dances would be offered on the campus, i.f the administration would allow Saturday night dances to continue until three o'clock, due to the .smaller proportionate cost for the longer period. TO COACH NlTCHMAN An ever driving, hard clean fighting freshman eleven brought to a close the 1932 season with a most enviable record. Much praise is due to the eleven and to the coach, Nelson Nitchman, who has been instrumental in turning out first class elevens during his two years at Union. Nels, as he is known to most of us, is a real ·coach. He knows how to work with boys and can gain their complete confidence and esteem, a most essential requirement in turning out win- ning elevens. Without a desire to fight hard for a coach and for a college, a team cannot win. Coach Nitchman's record while an undergrad- uate and as a coach is nearly irreproachable. Dur- ing his two years as coach of freshman elevens here, his teams have suffered only one loss, that to Peekskill Military Academy last year by the score of 6 to 0. · Some of the best men in this year's varsity eleven wel.'e members of last season's f.reshman team, clearly reflecting the training given them last year, and we are certain that there will. be many men of this year's eleven playing first string varsity ball next year. THE CONCORDIENSlS, TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 1, 19'32 .c=~======~~~======- : I I I I . i YE BOU.ND'ING BROUK.E Of ceurse it would only be appropriate to be- gin our col·umn with something concernillg the week~end's many achievements, and as everyone is still trying to assemble the st~.bsequent events which folloWed the historic football victory last Saturday, perhaps· I may be of some assistance, as I managed te attend a .majority of the func- tions, except for Sunday morning's service.

These little contests are car- ried on weekly, with Hal Wittner oft'iciat·ing. * * * * The Thanksgiving 'vacation was. voted upon yesterday morning at Student Body meeting, and result was practica-lly an anonimous bid for the affirmative. There is only one rub as far as I can see, and that is-what to do with the Rt. Rev. Charles Fiske, :Sishop of Central New York. Should we let him deliver a sermon to a handful of students who might not go home for the holi- day, or should we all return the Saturday night before for the occasion? * * * When failing with the appropriate amount of data to fill one's column, our r0und-fa;ced editor- in-chief suggests just rambling till we get to the end.-God bless him. Mr. Crichton spent another quiet week-end at home with his Aunt Myrtle. Weld Schoonmaker, of the Alpha Delta Phi grounds was seen Amsterdaming. James T.

THE NECESSITY OF A CAFETERIA Union is one of the few colleges which does not have a student cafeteria. A vote will be taken in Student Body meeting yesterday to determine the sentiments of undergraduates as to the advis- abi'lity of suggesting to the administration oul.'\ desire of having a cafeteria in Sillim:;m hall. A cafeteria operated under proper manage- ment would be an invaluable asset to the college. It would provide a place of meeting of all under;- graduates; at the same time allowing one to pur- chase food at a lower price than is the present case at nearby restaurants and sandwich shops. In additon, it would serve as a means of employment for some students, who might other- wise be compelled to leave college for financial reasons. It has been suggested that a cafeteria might offer competition to fraternity tables, but this does not seem to be the opinian of the majority of fraternity men. Instead it would serve as a place where inter-fraternity groups might estab- lish a more secqre bond of friendship and good will. It would also become a place where stu- dents might be.come better acquainted with mem- bers of the faculty, such as is not the present situation. WELCOME LIPPMANN Walter Lippmann comes to. Union as the first journalist and the youngest man to appear here as Honorary Chancellor. He follows a line of most distinguished men whom we are p.roud to have had at Union in this capacity. Dr. Day also is due praise for bringing to Union such an outstanding man of modern thought. Lippmann's .column . in the New York Herald Tribune is, without doubt, one of the most r:ead synd-icate articles appearing at the present time. His appearance here wiH be of particular sig- nificance since he served at one Ume as. secretary to former Mayor George R. Lunn, and present Commissioner of Public Safety of the. State of New York. Mr. Lippmann is :a leader in the field of prac- tical socialistic thinkers. His boaks hav:e received nation-wide acclaim, and we shall be proud to welcome him to the campus in June.

WHAT THEY DIDONS:A.~URDAY While Rochester was being de- feated Saturday, Hamilton was battling to a scoreless deadlock. Hobart, snowed unde:r earlier in the season by Union b:y a score of 46 to 6, whitewashed the Yellow Jackets 6 to 0 in the 45th meet- ing of the bitter rivals. Bad breaks prevented the Genevans from accumulating mol'e points. The superiority Qf .t11e winners evinces its€lf in the record of first downs: 18 to Rochester's 4. A tighter game marked the meeting of Hamiltou with St. Lawrence at ·Canton. The Conti- nentals lacked punch thr()ughout the contest, failing to utilize five scoring chances. A comparison of downs, however, g~ves the Larries 16 to the visitors' 4. The Buff-and-Blue eleven was unable to hold Becker, whose l'Unning and plunging averaged 5: yards in 21 plays. HE ENJOYS FOOTBALL GAMES The race was Union's from start to finish. The Garnet runners were not. extended to win in record breaking time and when they cross- · ed the finish line, they were talking to each other. Garnet Meets C. C. N. Y. Next Next week will end Union's dual meet schedule. The Garnet wiU run C. C. N. Y. here over a six-mile course on Saturday afternoon. The , New Yorkers lost to and Union defeated R. P.

Kazmierczak and Boerner are expected to shine in this race as they are better over the lc:>!lger · distance. :PSI U. WINS MEET Taking third, fifth, and sixth · places for the low score of fourteen . points, Psi Upsilon won the Inter- fraternity cross country race over a mile and Seven eighths course last Friday afternoon. Alpha Phi . Delta was next with a total of 23, Neutrals 35, Delta Upsilon 39, and Sigma Chi 42. Gottschalk, Lambda Chi Alpha, was the first rnan to cross the fin- ish line with the time of 9:38. Fif- teen seconds later Forpes, Sigma Phi, came in to take second place, and Hill, Psi Upsilon, finislied with a flat 10:00.

Dill to Munay, Provides Only Score in Hard Fought Contest With Williams A run Fox, twenty-yard by Austin L'nion een- ter, who recover- ?d the ball as 3onlon, William\! halfback, fumbled when hit by two Union players on an off tackle dash, paved the way for a 6 to 0 victory over Williams Saturday on Alex- ander field.

An incompleted pass on the foueth down knocked down in the end zone by Captain Mitchell, gave Union the hall on the 20-yard line; Williams had no other close chance. Purple Tries Passing Attack The two teams were evenly matched, line rushes netting few yards in most cases. The game or. the whole was a punting duel, in which a strong wii1d played its part. Williams used its heralded passing attack futilely, completing five of eig-hteen attempts.

A comparison of downs, ho-wever, gives the Lart'ies 16 to the visitors' 4. The Buff-and-Blue eleven was unable- to hold Becker. whose running- and plunging averaged 5 yards in 21 plays.

If you saw ihe Herald Tribune story Sunday on the Williams contest, you sho11ld know that Georg·e Daley, sports editor of that paper, a g-raduate in the class of 1892, wrote tbe very read- able article. M.r. DaiPy works independently, ases an uniqu~> system which. misses no point of the game, comj)iles by himself accurate statistics-these things I noticed in tl1e IJress box Satur- day. FEATURE TIES He graduated here as a Civil Engineer and five years later be- gan what was to become a bril- liant journalistic career. It was in '97 that he first wrote sports for the New 'York \Evening Post.\ From 1903 to 1904 he for- sook typewriter for ticker, but immediately after' joined the New York \Tribune\ staff as Sport- ing Editor. In the same capacity he transferred t& the New York \World\ in 1916. Within the past few years he has ])een associated with the \Herald Tribune.\ Of George Daley it is said that, more than any other man, he helped build the New York \Tribune's\ reputation for accur- ate sports reporting, for keen in- terpretation of sports world hap~ penings. His keen enjoyment of football games, Especially those in which his aim a :mater partici- pates, can be attributed to his collegiate career as a star quar- terback. I .

g-e to Gamet Court Squad Reports for Practice, Losing orrly one regular varsity n1an and strengthened by the addi- tion of the undefeated freshman !i ve of last year, the basketball . team is looking ahead to a success- ful 11i32-33 season. Last year Coach Hardman's tnea, ~t ftet· losin);\ five games in a row, hit their stride and linished the ,:t•ason with an even score of seven .· , ictories and seven defeats. The ream will have the same members this yeai·, with the exception of t\~rover Hotaling, a high sco·rer · who graduated last year. The four · renraining regulars are an seniors:. Ca}Jtain Bob Murray and Charles· Sing-le, g11aeds; Red Ackley, center; • <llld ex-Captain Bus Dill, anothe·r · ::;tar scorer of last year. Returning also from last year's squad are Dow and Higgias, both lettermen, and Parker, Barnett, Iver:oon and Rock~ , well. Expect M1:1ch of Sophomores The freshman team which won aH five games last year sends up to ' tbe var:oity its smooth working combination of Dain, McDowell, Sernerad, G-ain, and Rotunda. Four more sophDmores, who saw action last year on Coach Nitchman's quintet, McNab, Reed, Moffett and Schneidervrind, will probably turn out for the varsity squad this year. Bastedo Stars in Frosh Cross Country Season The freshman cross country sea- son is completed and the yearlings were victorious in both meets in which they contested. On October 15th they defeated Colgate over the Alex:ander course by a score of 24 to 31. A vreek later they registered their victory against R. P. I., 25 to 30, in a meet at Troy. In both races Bastedo was the first Union man to cross the line, but each time he was forced to come in second by a better man on the opposing team. In the early part of the season Ken Young gave promise of being a fast man, but an injury to his leg slowed him up a bit and he was not able to do hi::; best. Gawne and Neuman were also consistent runners on the fresh 1 team. The scores made by the individ- ual runners are: Bastedo, 4; Neu- man, 9; Gawne, 9; Fiore, 12; Tra- vis, 15; Young, 17; and North, 9, (in one meet). INTERCOLLEGIATE !'RESIDENTIAL l'OLL Univ. H.

Six DEBATERS PREPARING TO MEET ALBANY LAW At the I'egular Philomathean meeting, iast night, the subject de- bated was: Resolved that 50 per- cent of all state and local revenue should> be derived from othel' sources than tangible property. The affirmative was upheld by Milton Schwebel '34, George Paulus '36, Charles. Thomas '35, and Irving Lifset '36, while William La- Flure '33, William DeHes '33, Jos- eph Sa1del '33, and Gordon Bell '33, defended the negative. There will be another debate an the same question on Monday night at 7:30P.M. with Arthur Plummer '35, and .Arthur Greenberg '36, sup- porting the affirmative, and WiH- iam LaFlure and William Delles the negative. The negative team will debate .Albany Law school at Albany on the same question next Friday. Music By RANKINE HINMAN The lecture which Samuel Chot- zinoff will give this evening in Hanna hall' will probably be one of the finest cultaral opportunities of the year; Mr. Chotzinaff, himself an excellent pianist who has ac- companied some .of the greatest figures in the musical world, will play selections to illustrate his commen~s on musical appreciation. Arensky's :phantom waltz, which Professor Tidmarsh played last Sunday on a program of fantastic music, was one of the most exquis- ite numbers we have heard this year. For sheer beauty, it was the most enjoyable part of the pro- gram, being given, as it was, tow- ard the end when the chapel was in darkness with a lamp lighting only the bright, contrasting ivory keys and walnut woodwork of the ·con- sole and casting wavering shadows on the marble walls. Arensky's music shows an affinity to Tschaikowsky but lacks the lat- ter's technical versatility and con- summate mastery of the dramatic. His work is free from the mechan- ical quality that is a weakness of many of his Russian contemporar- ies. Arensky is most popular in his songs and piano pieces. In contrast to the melancholy which is likely to characterize Rus- sian music, Rimski-Korsakov's Sch- eherezade Suite abounds in bright, joyful pictures painted with subtle colours and brilliant effects. The entire suite was also. played yester- day over WEAF-WGY by a sym- phony orchestr-a under Erno Rap- pee, giving an interesting oppor- tunity to compare the two arrange- ments. We personally felt the or- gan br<'>ught out the exotic effects more truly. The Tales from Arabian Nights are as rich as the autumnal colour- ing that has just left us and are further distinguished by marvelous contrasting motions, now startling, now fluent; such music especially shows you the artist as well as the composer, for in the hands of lesser organists than Professor Tiqmarsh it becomes queer and uninteresting. Potentialities of colour and spirit cannot be written down in black and white for everyone to discern. The composer, R. S. Stoughton, is by profession a banker. Joseph Clokey's nature sketches were equally colourful, and in these, also, the tempo was interest- ing, especially in the syncopations of the Pipes of Pan and in the many quick arpeggios and run:;. As we anticipated the Stoughton number as one which we had never heard before, so in the familiar Danse Macabre we looked forward to discovering new effects which had escaped us before, such as the occurance of the diminished fifth, at times disguised by accompani- ment, that marks Death's efforts to tune his violin from time to time. The mighty theme of the anthem which the choir sang Sunday, All Praise to God Eternal, is taken from Moussorgsky's opera Boris Goudonov and appears in the Cor- onation Scene, -w:hich the combined choruses under Professor Tidmarsh sang in the chapel last June. The choir is working on some new Christmas music which wi'll be used at the special musical service in December.

Diamond ON THE APPBECJ:A.TION OF MUSIC Mr. Chotzinoff gave a most interesting lecture Tuesday evening, accompanied by ·illustrations from Beethoven's Symphonies. His 'lecture was ' sponsored by the Carnegie Foundation and was worthy of a far greater attendance than saw fit to attend. Mr. Chotzinoff \debanked\ some of the pop- ulal' conceptions of classical music. He attempt- ed to show, quite succes:sfully, that it is possible for the average person to understand music enough to enjoy it. Emphasizing by illustrations, he showed that music is not as complicated as many would have us believe, and that most of us are able to understand music enough to realize it's beauty, magnificence and rhythm. The interpretation of themes does demand a more intensive knowledge of the structure of mu- sic, but by careful attention, and a fair realiza- tion of the fundamentals, we are able to apprec- Iate the great masterpieces. Mr. Chotzinoff believes the cause of. ignorance of many masterpieces to be due to the conductors themselves. Various interpretations of the same works may lead to differed reactions upon aud- iences, and cause favor ()r disfavor of the work. Professor Tidmarsh has done a great deal here at Union to further musical interest among ·undergraduates. Through his infh1en.ce, he has brought many outstanding personages to the cam- pus. His programs on Friday art;! aooong tbose most enthusiastically received, and be bas done much to add to our knowledge in the field of music. CONCEB:J.'t!ING ADVERTISERS This paper and the other publications on the campus are entirely or partially paid for by ad- vertising. It is a very difficalt matter to dete:r;- mine the effectiveness of advertising, but there is one matter worthy of our consideration. Local and national companies advertise in our :publications in an attempt. to receive patronage irom the student body. These institutions do re- ceive a large part of our patronage, but there is :another el!.'ment which ,enters upon the campus, which should be considet\ed. There are a large number of peddlers, spec- ialty salesmen, and order seekers who {!Orne upon ·our campus and take a large amount of money irom us. These men usually do not support the campus publications by ad:vertising in them. Since our publications are financed to a greoat part by .advertising receipts, it is only fair to those who do advertise in our papers to give them our sup- port by our patronage. Many of these peddlers Ilre \fakes\ .and \gyps\ .and take our money by- misrepresentation and oth- ~r unfair methods, common to th.at practice. There should be some means, such a-s .approval by Dean Garis, or some other responsible person, to prevent this practice. If all salesmen were re- quired to receive the appro'V\al of this censor, be-. :fore being allowed to show samples at fraternity houses, this undesirable class of peddlers would be removed from the campus. Local concerns are able to give the. best serv- ice because of their proximity to the c~tmpus, and they are worthy of our patronage. THE CONCORDIENSIS, FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 4, 1932 .. •---------.

Coach Will- iam. Harkness was present two days ago at the practice of the squad, making his first appearance on the field this fall. He urges all men who want to . play Wednesday to came out for practice immediately. Some of the men who have shown up to advantage are Mauer, Bergman, Kneher, and Hesson .. This year no upperclassmen will be permitted to take part in the match as has been the custom in former years. It is expected that Bill · Harkness will referee the contest. According to George Codman, manager, the schedule of games. for the varsity lacrosse team Is al- most complete, and will be an- nounced soon. Full practice will come to an end with Wednesday's · game. to a 16-6 victory here at the be- ginning of the season. Overconfidence is apt to under- mine the morale of any gridi.ron aggregation. Last year the Union team went inte the Hamilton con- test a decided favorite. What · ha!)pened was totally unlooked for. The team. slumped and was unable to recapture, in that game at least, the fighting attitude which is so necessary to a win~ ning combination. Rochester and Hamilton will not prove docile by a long shot. No losing team can be the under- dog indefinitely. Repeated losses are bound to instill an added ca- pacity for fight in any team .. The \non-favorite\ really has the up- per hand as far as mental atti- tude is concerned. A team, accounted a sure loser before the contest, will often at- tempt feats which are daring, though none the less calculated in advance. Such a team has noth- ing to lose and everything to gain. ·The \ranking\ team, however, bolstered by overconfidence, is · apt to prove over-cautious. It is not willing to yield its all in an effort to achieve victo1•y. Its playing is spotty and mechanical. In short, that added ounce of push is lacking. To want to win badly enough and to be willing to give its utmost in the attempt, that is the mental attitude which · begets a winninc team.

Sitv Music By RANKINE HINMAN Professor Tidmarsh's recital this Sunday will be devoted entirely to compositions by John Sebastian Bach, one of the truly great com- posers of musical history. Bach lived from 1685 to 1750 dur- ing a period when secular musifJ was rising to share the position of importance so long occupied only by church music. In a non-partisan manner he reconciled the old and the new modes of treatment, as- suming a powerful leadership and initiative in development. In many ways he was rar ahead of his age. In one suite we find programme music, many lovely, picturesque passages of pure description; in his Passion music there are num- eraus dramatic operatic effects created from the agony in the gar- den, the sleep of the disciples, the macking of the cross, the period of darkness, earthqual~e, and the rending of the veil in the temple. Under Bach we see polyphony r.aised to heights equa:Jled by few if any composers. At Best In O:r.gan Music Many critics believe that Bach's genius soars highest in his organ music, \in mountainous fugues,\ uninhibited by preaching, in which the artist in Bach has full sway. But his genius really culminates in the dignity and splendor of his religious expressions, for religion was the foundation of Bach's char- acter, which is an integral and liv- ing part of his music. In addition to the finale from the St. Matthew Passion the progmm will include the Prelude and Fugue in A minor, the Passacaglia and Fugue in C minor, the Journey of the Night Watchman, Sicilienne (in the style of an old Sicilian peasant dance), and the Fantasia and Fugue in A minor, the last a marvelous example of Bach's abil- ity to unify his work. Mr. Chotzinoff's Lecture Mr. Chotzinoff, who\ Tuesday so valuably aided and encouraged us to understand music, devoted a portion of his lecture to explaining the detrimental effects of inter- preting into non-programme mu- sic pictures which the composer never intended to represent, of at- tempting to make literature of InlJ- sic. These statements have pro- voked considerable discussion since the lecture and have possibly been misunderstood. Mr. Chotzinoff does not direct his objections at pro- gramme music, or portions of other music where the composer intended to depart from the abstract; he re- fers, rather, to any depreciation of the great, purely emotional quali- ties of a number by the intrusion of such foreign elements. The lecture Tuesday was an op- portunity and privilege that we hope we may have again; we are deeply indebted to the Carnegie Foundation and the college. N. Y. Philharmonic Orchestra Mr. Chotzinoff's reference to be- ing firm in one's own intuitions, al- though one may know little about music, brings to mJ:nd two reviews of the first fall concert of the New York PhilharmonJ,c Orchestra; even the critics disagree in their reactions. Olin Downes writes in the Times, \The Schonberg tran- scription of tl~e music (the Bach E flat Prelude and St. Anne FugUe) Is a masterpiece,\ while W. J. Hen- derson considers it a desecration of Bach and remarks, \Of course the thing was loudly applauded ... loud music always incites audi- ences to make noises with their hands.\ Schenectady Orchestra The Schenectady Orchestra, a group of 42 professional musicians under David Buttalph, will appear Friday evening, December 2, at the Mont Pleasant High School under the auspices of the Schenec- tady College Woman's Club. Char- les Gilbert Spross, ndtelJ.. composer- pianist, will play the pojriilar Grieg piano concerto with the orchestra. LOST ARTICLES A black evening wrap trimmed with white fur was taken from the Delta Phi h-ouse Saturday evening, and another wrap of similar de- scription left in its place. An ex- change would be appreciated. A man's coat bearing a Richman Brothers' label was taken from the Psi Upsilon house Saturday ev-e- ning.

One frequently hears these days, 'I'd like to vote for Norman Thomas, but I don't want Hoover to win, so I am going to vote for Roosevelt,' or vice versa. Here is a way you can av0id the difficulty. Send your name and address to the undersigned, indicat- ing that your first choice is Thom- as, and that your second is Roose- velt, or Hoover, as the case may be. You wHl then be paired with same one whose second choice is the reverse of yours, both of you will be notitl.ed, you can exchange confirmations, and then go to the poHs with a carefree heart and vote for your real choice, Norman Thomas.

McGe~e WHY STUDEN.I:'S FA¥ The fourth annual discussion as to w-hy the students should pay admission to the College Day program offered by the Mountebanks and tbe Glee Club is now underway. trninformed .students grumblingly demand to know why theix tax is not sufficient to cover admission to this. special production offered by these organizations,, at the request of the Graduate Council, for the JJeiurn- ing alumni and friends of the cellege. Since the uninformed have grumbled about paying admission to the Coll~ge Day pr<Jtluoetion since its inception in 1929, woe will expla.i!L. The Mountebanks and the Glee Club have t\egiElarl.y scheduled performances during the year to which no admission is charged the Student Bcdy-. The Mountebanks give three such productions, two or three one-act plays in December; a serlou:s play in March, and either a full leng-th comedy- .or two short comedies during Junier Week. The Glee Club gives a concert in Decoember and another. concert, sometimes two, in tll.e spring. It is only to accommodate the Graduate C:oun- cil, seeking some effective entertainment to ()ffer alumni on Saturday night of College Wee.k-end, that the Mountebanks and Glee Club join In pre- senting this special program. Naturally the ex- penses must come out of the receipts from tickets, since neither organization uses any of the student tax revenue to liquidate the ~X:penditures incur- red. Last year $1 a ticket was ~harged and s,ome $80 profit was made on tile pr()gram. Both clubs split the profits. ':['his year the tickets ha-ve been reduced to 55 cents and if a fllll house of 221() ]>er- sons attend all .the expenses will be paid f<Jl\. The :Services of the directors of the plays and the Glee dub and the graduate manag::er of the Nounte- :bari.ks are donated to the cause .. If what has happened at the perfol\llLances in the Mountebanks Theatre during the past year <Occurs again on Saturday nigl.t, and we b.a\Ve no reason to believe to the contrary, the wi£e :stu- ·dent will reserve his seats at the News :Bul\eau in Silliman hall without delay.. Otherwise lle may not be able to procure a seat in the theatre and hear the Glee club sing some fine songs, th·e quar- tet harmonize in some delightful ,pieces, an.U see the Mountebanks put on two fullny sll;etches. Incidentally, we are glad that the seat:s are all reserved for this performance. Last ye~w at College Day there were no rese:rved seats, eaus!ng some difficulty in sitting near one's partn el\ if one had not purchased seats ea:rly in the week. CAMOUFLAGE There has recently been published a bo-oklet 'Cntitled \Union College Bulletin,\ which is pro- curable at the office of the dean of studeD.ts. It contains general information relative to :aamis- sions, courses of study and subjects to be :fo1llow- .ed, along with general regulations of the eollege, as pertaining to student affairso. On page 85 of the booklet. under the main I \ fORSOOTH AND ANON Well, tonight is the big night, before midnight we will Jearn wh0 is to he our next president. There a!\e no less than ninety \purties.\ What should we call them, \poll•resultin' purties,\ presi· dent \pur-ties?\ Most ()f them wiH pe repeal \pur• ttes,\ whjch wiJil precede the final returns, and there witl' be· much rejoicin' on one side or the other {t()o bad ,Socialists, ~aybe in another de- cade), a:; either President Hoaver or Gavernor Roosevelt yvill attain the majority. * * .• * In line with this propaganda comes the sa4, sad news that \ Goo-Goo\ Cantor ha!'l withdrawn from the' race. Already disaster is in sight.

Whel\e is that \Unforgotten Man'' who said that Union would not bave a footbrull team this year? RunJ.or has. it that two of Rochester's fore- most banks failed to open their doors yesterday :;tfter the bets· on Saturday's game had been paid, We onl31 hope that ;the aforementioned .man doesn't drop around Saturday to cause a repeti- tion of last year's Ham.J:Iton game~ Many of. the more virne Union men took to the woods over the week-end to take advantage of the deer season. j.im ~oung has his prize ·dangling from a tree near the Chi Psi Lodge. * * * • It has been brought to our attention that H. William Smith of the :Sig Place and the Q. M. (at which pla.ce ·he is. hom.e to his friends during the afternoon) is again assisting the Civic Players with his anquestionable talent in their latest play \Up Pops' the Devii.\ We are informed that, un- doubtedly due to false rumors or possibly mis- taken identity, he is taking the part of a drunk. What a distasteful word! We assure our friends that the ])lay will be well worth attending if only to see BI\other Smith in such an inappropriate role. * • * * We of the cleaner living group of Union men who are able to recall the Hamilton week,end two years ago look forward to the rapidly approaching week-end with fear and trembling. Rumor has it that Captain Mitchell, Jerry Barnett and the latter's sh.ort friend will procede immediately; to the library after the game. Here they will in- dulge in deep research until the wee small hours of the morning. We appreciate the intellectual aspirations of ·these gentiemen and offer them our whole-hearted support in their efforts. How- ever, as a. .purely precautionary measure we ad- vise all those houses holding dances this week- end to nail down all movable objects. If you men must get over-enthusiastic, a condition brought on, we believe, by the tense excitement of the game, we suggest that you get it out of your sys- tems during the tea dances. Brother Schwenger known to his friends as \Teeter extends the hospitaHty of the Alpha Delt House to all men thus inspired and guarantees personally conduct- ed tours thro11ghout the House to those who have not had the honor before this time. His fat friend, John Gard,iner, will attempt to aid in these tours, but we know him better (much to our shame) and question the extent of his usefulness at th~t tim e. * • • • Looking fo1•ward to meeting you all under the bleachers Saturday, I remain, Very truly yours, \Jake.\ heading Attendance a.nd Standing, there is a sub- head entitled Daily Assembly. To quote the ex- planation g-iven of this ~oncerns an of us. \M:orn- ing worship is held in the chapel every college day except :Moadayr, and attendance is required of all students.\ Is the administration attempting to camou- flage the practice at Union by terming daily as- sembly as \worship\ ? When the name daily chap- el was changed to daily assembly, as a result t)f the nature of the program, ~t would seem that such propaganda as the above would also be re- moved from tbe college publications. • REAL ED'UCA'.l'ION \Prejudice is the badge of tlie uneducated man,\ Newi:on D. Baker recently stated. How often is the so-called educated person, the college graduate, p·rejUdiced? During his ()ollege years he may have unconsciously learned to scotT at the opinions, afliliations, and customs of others. The era-dication of prejudice becomes one of the 'major task:s of education. T:P,e capacity to hold one's judgment in suspense until the true facts a.re k11own is a lesson which all must learn. If all COtllege people could acquire· the detach- ed unprejudiced habit of mind, they could be in- valuable contributors to a nation, as Its ci'tizens. Too often, .American thought is soiled by the prejudice o:f race against race, creed against creed, class against class. Our task is riot to con- demn individuals because of our prejudice again!'lt the whole bqt gradually to learn that, in order to be tolerated, we must be tolerate. -SYRACUSE DAILY ORANGE ~--~--~---------==========;:======= Tbe Acme Barber Shop . · Louis di .Lorenzo, PrQp.

MeUnette WELCOME ALUMNI We welcome back to the campus all alumni of the college, whether they were graduated last year or fifty years ago. The administration has done it's utmost \to make your brief visit to the campus most enjoyable. We also extend our most cordial hospitality to other week-end guests and friends of the col- lege. If this happens to be your first visit here, we hope that you will leave with a kind feeling of the college and .its members. There are many activities on the campus to make \your stay a pleasant one. The football game tomorrow afternoon promises plenty of ac- tion and excitement. Both teams are ready to defend their glory iu this traditional battle. Our team has had a well earned brilliant season this year- and will do its utmost to close the season with an overwhelming victory. The Mountebanks have exerted much effort to make their .first production of the year one of the best to be presented on the campus. New sets have been purchased for this production and previews of the two plays reflect the excellent choice used by Mr. Cl't.rroll in the selection of this year's productions. The college glee club with approximately sixty voices, the largest in the history of the col- lege, will sing three groups of songs between the Mountebanks productions. Ten fraternities are offering dances to their alumni and friends tomorrow night. Although these dances only continue until twelve o'clock, all of the houses are attempting to make the three hours most pleasing ones. Dr. Bernard I. Bell, warden of St. Stephen's College will be the speaker at the Sunday morn- big service in Memorial chapel. Dr. Bell is one of the most .interesting speakers of the year, and one is assured of a most intelligent and inspiring sermon on Sunday morning. Professor T.idmarsh will bring to a close the week-end activities with his regular Sunday afternoon concert. The college may have changed to some ex- tent since your undergraduate days at Union, but we are certaip that you will still find here the same spirit of fellowship that has and does make Union one of the greatest small colleges. ~OREIGN STUDENT BENEFIT SALE The International .Foreign Student Exchange is sponsoring a sale of rare and unusual articles, suitable for favors, prizes and gifts to be held Tuesday and Wednesday at the home of Mr. and Mrs. H. L. Achilles on Avon .Road. This international exchange receives a small .commission for their sale of articles which are received from all parts of the world, and are then offered to the public at a figure much smaller than would be asked at gift or novelty shops. Dr. Day is the honorary chairman of this sale and urges all students to take advantage of this unusual sale. There are a number of foreign stu- dents in American colleges who are in dire need of money, due to the deflation of foreign money. This sale will make it possible for more of these students to continue their schooling here in Amer- ica and abroad, gaining the sarne valuable knowledge that we are obtaining. There are foreign students l:1erc at Union who are in like circumstances, who will be benefitted THE CONCORDIENSIS, FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 11, 1932 Pee~ng . Thm the Keyhote l As I passed by the football field yesterday I observed that those <;:haps who aspire to be man- ager some day were busiiy engaged in taking the water off' tbe field by means of buckets. r was led to believe ,fhat instead of a feotba:U classic the college would ,sponsor a water carnival on Satur- day. It is rather late but I am inclined :to believe that the authorities could persuade the neighbor- ing colleges to sen:d a representative to· Union for the .unique a:tfair. Of course it would be quite es~ .sential that we have at least se:venty ·er. eighty inches more of water. Why it would be just the thing under the prevailing conditions. There would be out-board motor boat races, water•poio, and in the ·case of a good wind there would preba~ly be sailing races, fo·r effect. The main .event wHI be .a :swimming contest by Doctor Mavor's web~foot­ ed frUit flies~ In the event that the dear little brats become bashful or awe-stricken by the huge multitude, and refuse to perform, perhaps the master wUl d:G a high diV'e to thritl the crowd. Of course it would be very necessary that the spec• tators in the lower ro.ws of the bleachers· purchase tubber suits at the gate. As an added attraction for those who become bored a ~nique race will be staged by forty or fifty squirrels on ·the out.,board track. (Yo11 may leave aU wag.ers with the Re- publican boss who is attempting a comeback af- ter his recent losses). What is the answer to all of this· anyway? Simply a new tile drainage sys~ tern. beneath the football field. Nels Collamer, and !Bob Wi'ley drove over to a social function sponsored by Mt. Holyoke Col- lege last week-end. As usual something- always happens when this pair become allied with one ailOther. It happened that Nels had to attend the dance in informal clothes, It seems that he had intentions of going formal, but when the time came to put his, shirt on, he discovered that in- stead of a Tuck shirt, he had brought along one of those exquisite dicky shirts. He m~.de three attemJ.ts to get his vest on over the shirt IJut each time the shirt popped. On the third attempt the shirt flew out with such rapidity and power that four buttons .f1ew off his vest. Heard of a case whereby two seniors were re- fused admission to chapel services last Sunday morning. Persons in mind each had a book <(not a hymn book either) when they approached the chapel doors. The attendants informed the boys that they could either deposit the books (You know sort of a hat check procedure now- -great .stuff) or return (I suppose to bed). The 'boys turned about and departed. Some one voiced the ·opinion that the boys might just as well pe per- mitted to read in chapel rather than to have them conversing quite freely or fall asleep. 'rhe latter is very ann()ying and quite nerve racking to those sitting behind the sleeper, or sleepers as the ca!ile might be, because one can never tell whether he wiH faU forw:ard or on his side. As every one knows by this time on March fourth, nineteen thirty-three we are to have a new administration In power. It was a great ·election for many and for others it was a humiliating, blow. The new President has some mighty tall trees to cut down in his forest, and wh.ether or not he will be able to utilize the lumber will de- pend upon the direction in which the trees fall. Speaking of election, this afternoon at two-thirty John King Sullivan was to have paid his ·election wager to Larry Dugan also a Beta. It seems that .John voted for Hoovet' and as a rPsult be must fulfill his share of the bal'gain by pushing Larry in a wheel~barrow from Crescent Park (directly across from the Plaza) down to the overhead crossing on State street. The exciting and fatigu- ing journey (for Mr. Sullivan) probably held up traffic for an hour. At last after searching diligently for weeks I have found out where Professor Doty gets his big cigars. It seems after his afternoon classes or his research work he goes over to the :Brand- horst drug store. Here he is able to score a Win- ning c'ombination on the marble machine for the cost of five cents and in return receive ten cents with which he can purchase his comfort for the next half hour. I wish I was so fortunate and I might say so consistent. A neutral not knowing that Alex Stephenson was a Phi Delt told fiim that Ricky went up to the Phi Delt house every morning this past week and carried away discarded, hug~ soup bones (notice I say huge, boy those boys up there have large market bills) to his fraternity house. Now I know why the good old Betas make no bones about letting people know their position on the campus. Charles H. Baldwin, State Commissioner of Agriculture and Markets issued the following plea, \eat an apple a day\ and help the farmer. He said if every .person will eat an apple a day be- tween now and New Year's most of New York State's crop of 20,000,000 bushels of apples will be consumed. Phil Huested at the Delta Phi House is certainly aiding the state. Why, that ambitious youth must have surely surpassed the number· of bushels above. Of course, Phil's a.pples are in solution. Never let a fool kiss you, or let a kiss :Cool you. (.Tust .oa, little advice for the week-end). -Tee Pee. by this sale.

'' '' '' 'i 1 I Four HamUton Expected to Put up Stiff Fight in 40th .Annual Encounter .Alumni returning for the an.nual CoLlege Weekend, and students wlll mingle tomorrow on Alexander· field when Union and' Hamilton clash at two o'cleck in their 40th gridiron battle since 1889. 'Thir~ ' teen Garnet seniors will llon uni- forms for the last time. Union, riding on the crest of a . wave which engulfed Hobart, R. P. I., Williams, and Rochester successively, is the favored combi- nation. Hamilton, •however; having won 14 contests to the U\l.lion 15, • · will have an added stak:e for which· to battle. In the clashes between the two elevens it has been tradition that, the \underdog\ has usua:lly man-: .aged to rise to an equal level. Ten · of the 39 games wl:l.ich have been, played were ties. Eight .of these· were :scoreless. Barnett in Backfiel-d Gerry Barnett, a senior, who has been in Garnet line since h.is fresh~ man year, has always looked for~ ward to the day when his 290 pounds would not be needed to bolster up the forward wall. To- morrow his chance may C()me. 'J,.'he discovery last week, that Barnett is a potential ball-carrier, indicates a change in the Union style of play, although he is not starting tomor- row. During a greater portion of the season, the Garnet backfield func- tioned on passes and based its at- tack around that department. Witll the inception of new weight in the backfield, it is Ukely that tomor- row's contest \Vm feature straight line-bucking with Barnett doing a good deal of the ball-carrying. Original Backfield Combination The backfield combinati9n which opened the season will on:ce more be seen in action. Captain Mitchell will be stationed at halfback with \Bus\ Dill, as his running mate. Dill, who, for the latter pa:rt of the season, received special training from Assistant Coach Erne:st Ligon, will display a new runni11g style which should prove highJy effec- Uye. Don Nitchman, a senior, will call the signals for the Garnet. \Chip\ Dain who ran the team dur- ing the xp.iddle of the sea:s()n,. will be held in reserve. Ralph. .Sem- erad, who started the seas<ln in the quarterback post, will play full- back, at which position he worked during his freshman year. SP.m- erad has .been on the field during a ~ajor part of each of tlie Union battles this year.

It was in 1889 that the first game be- tween these two old rivals was played at Clinton. Since that time the Garnet. and the Buff and Blue have met almost every year for a total of 39 games. Although Union has scored almost twice as many points as her rivals from Clinton, the Garnet has manage4 only to win one more game than Hamilton, Union has been victorious 15 times, while Hamilton has been the conquerer on 14 occasions. Ten games have resulted in ties.

CHESS TEAM SELECTED IDSTORY REPEATS ITSELF The day before New York, usually a Republican state, went De:mocratic in support of Frank- lin D. Roosevelt, Union students went on record as favoring a college lunch room. A search of college records reveals that twenty years ago on the day Jlrevious to the national elec- tion, in which Woodrow Wilson alsc carrie¢ New York .state, the student body voted on the ques- tion of whether or not the col- lege should establish a lunch room. At that time the proposi- tion was voted down. \Postmodernism and Other Essays\ 1925.; \Common Sense in Educa- tion\ 1928.

Six Music Dy RANKINE HINMAN G:ovanni Trombini, cellist, will be the guest artist at the organ re- cital Sunday. His generous con- tribution to the musical life of the campus, to the increasingly popu- lar Sunday afternoon organ re()it- als, is a major one. He will play one of Schubert's lovely, melodic son.gs, \Le Desir,\ Von Gaens' Scherzo, Massenet's \Elegie The latter, one o~ the composer's most famous songs, is written upon an air from his unsuccessful opera, \Les Erynines\; in this number Massenet's graceful, elegant charm is suffused with a melancholy touch that adds much to its appeal. Professo•r 'Tidmarsh will play Vivaldi's Concerto in .A- minor, ar- ranged by Bach, and a Sonata of the Ninety-fourth Psalm by .Julius Reubke. Bacll has arranged four organ and eleven string C()ncertos of Vivaldi's, thus helping -to per- petuate the earlier mu:Sician's fame for mastery of form and its application in developing the concerto. Viv.aldi, a violin virtuosa, illustrates in his original composi- tions a somewhat harmful striving for display that at times clouds the mastery of his work, which Bach has uncovered. Reubke's Sonata. The Sonata, Ninety-fourth Psalm, is Reubke's only really widely known work, for he died at the age of twenty-four; its originality and power, however, would indi- cate what a loss his premature death was to the world. In pic- turing the strong emotions and portions of this psalm Reubke ex- ercised considerable influence on the camposition of furthel' pro- gramme music for tlle organ. There are th11ee parts to the piece: 'a fantasia, a brief adagio, and a very free fugue. For any who might be interested in following it from the psalm, the verses used are believed to be dealt with· in this order: 1, Z, 3, 6, 7; 11, 19; 2:2, 23. Conce:rts at Skidmore Skidmore College has announced a course of four concerts: Novem- ber 14, Charles Neagele, pianist; Sun-day, December 11, Detroi-t Sym~ phony under Ossip Gabrilowitsch; .January 12, George Enesco, violin- ist; and Mareh Goeta Ljungberg, soprano of the Metropolitan Opera Company. Tickets are procura'!;lle at the college, Miss Starbuck's of- fice. We notice th.at the piano in Silli- man hall is in almost constant use, giving forth almost anyth.ing from a one-finger jazz tune to the clas- sics. At times a radio may b.e more pleasant to listen to, but this per- sonal form of enjoyment must be far more saUsfying. Last Sunday's Recital The Bach program which Pro- fessor Tidmarsh played Sunday was of a highly intellectual, non- programme nature, a marked con- trast to the \fantastic\ mtisic of the Hallowe'en program; it is mu- sic during which one must be con- stantly alert lest be miss the deli- cate gradations, masterful varia- tion of themes, and contrapuntal combinations that constitute so much in a Bach number. We must confess that -we sha;ll have to hear the Passacaglia and Fugue in C minor many more times before we shall be able to recogniz;e the twenty variations of the Passaca- glia theme and the subtle changes of mood connoted in these repre- senations. The constant delight in analyz- ing such a number is not the mere joy of dissection; treated thns the music would soon lose its eharm, our delight is rather in the antici- pation of how much more the piece will hold for us when we have de- veloped a full appreciation for it. We felt that much of the music was permeated very quietly, but ne:ver the less really, bY\ a joyous earnestness that re~lected :Bach's own character, especially in the Prelude and Fugue in A min()r, Wldor Arrangements The Journey of the Night Watch- man, SiciliennE, and the Finale from \St. Matthew Passion,\ all ar- ranged by Widor, formed a balanc- ing Interlude f(lr the abstract mu- sic of the remainder of the pro- gram. The beautiful, mellow tones of Sicilienne still linge.r in the mind. THE CONCORDIENSIS, FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 11, 1932 The Passion music becomes more real to us when we realize that at the time it was written religion played a vital part in the life of any community; the peGple in a cathedral felt themselves a virtual part of the great mystery unfold- ing before them, sharing it so fully with the choir that they might e:ve11 'hum or sing portians of the music. In the dignity and splendor of the Passions many critics believe Bach's genius soars to its greatest heights. Religion was a very ser- ious and. most fundamental element of his character.

Diamond 'TO THE FACULTY Mr. James E. Finegan gave one of the most enthusiastic and sincere addresses that we have had the pleasure of ·hearing in the chapel this year. His opinions may be taken to represent the sentiments <lf the alumni of the college, and more particularly, he expressed the feelings of the un- dergraduate 'body, unlike most .speakers who at- tempt to nurture us with their words <lf wisdom. \Too many fellows teach because they want a job,\ was Mr. Finegan's way of saying that the teaching profession is overcrowded, and, in many cases, is made up of men unworthy of holding such a resp()nsible position. Teaching is a most responsible position, since it's importance is not self enclosed within the professor. The actions of a teacher share a di- rect bearing upon the undergraduate in any of his classes. It is not only harmful to the teacher to be incompetent and disinterested in the work of a student, but more important is the harm that is done to the student. Our teachings have a very important and lasting influence on our trend of thought at the present time and undoubtedly for the. rest of ou.r lives. We are quite susceptible to varied opinions, but this responsibility may be harmfully 11sed by the faculty. There are certain teachers here, some of whom are heads of departments who do not have any apparent interest in the men of their classes. Their only purpose seems to he to put in a cer- tain amount of time, in order to receive the monthly pay check. Such men are no asset to any college and contribute nothing beneficial to a .college or to its student body. It would 'be well for some members of the faculty to ask themselves \What is the purpose of .a college?\ Without students a college cannot ex- ist, and a faculty member should realize that .he is hired to teach men those fundamentals necessary for an education. It is true that endless effort is unable to make some men study, but these are in the minority. When a professor becomes unin- teresting he loses the attention of the undergrad- .uate and a barrier is 'built between the student and him. This breach usually does not lessen, hut tends to increase until finally a reputation is built around a professor which causes remarks such as \He is the driest man on the faculty,\ \He thinks that the world is built around his course,\ \Keep away fr<Jm his courses,\ etc. Such a condition is deplorable and should be ·considered by the administration. Tenure of of- fice should be the sole requirement for keeping certain men on the faculty and if this were made less important, men who are really interested in students could be added to the faculty and the college greatly improved. THE CONCORDIENSIS, TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 15, 1932 l Chapter Chatter Now that the election is over perhaps we will he allowed to re~ume our erstwhile vicious :pas- times of Hstening to Yowser Berni:e 1 Okay O'Reefe. and cacophonous Cab Calloway, who for the past six weeks hav:e been: crowded off the airlane!'l by such sterling ·comedians as the Hon. Thaddeus Z. Pussyfoot, ·Congressman from the uptee:nth dis'tric'~ seeking re--election. l?erh8ips there ave some who prefer the traditional banalities of S'enator Strad- d:leissue, but in our judgment even Banjo•eyes Cantor would be a more desirable radio featut·.e. Speaking of election ·reminds. us of that well~ known campus politican who .dr-opped ten backs when the donkey left the elephant :J)eb,ind: in the quadrennia;! steeplechase last week Our hero, ever on the alert, immediately proceeded to break even ·by hunting up a staunch Jeffersonian '(Dem- ocrat to you) and wagering a ten spo.t th:at th..ere wouldn't be a bank in the country- open :fou.r months fi'om the day Roosevelt took office. Why Cuthbert, don't you know that the banks are· ·al\ ways closed on J'uly· 4th?.) Hats off to that leather~lunged Hamilton cheerleader who doubled with the bass drum in the band. He put just as inuch effort into that game a:s the pigskin-pushers themselves. That \Beat Union\ yell of the Buff and Blue is cer- tainly a honey! Why is it that our own Alma Mater always sounds ·much better when a ba.nd from a rival college plays it? .And that demon- stration of spirit of the Hamilton rooters should '!;>ring a blush of shame to the cheeks of ma:qy- a Garnet supporter! While we are at it, let's doff our bonnets to· that sterling lateral and forward pass combina- tion that netted Union her six points Saturd'ay. and that double lateral of Ollikainen, McKenzie .et Cie. was one for the book. But we coal4 we,ar out a whoiQ new typewriter ribbon talking. ab()out that game and stiU not do those boys op. the fl'eld justice. We noticed a sign on a theater marqu.ee downtown: \Life Begins with Loretta Young.\ Personally we prefer that gorgeous .tittle Titian haired miss whom we escorted hither and yon Saturday P. M. Pardon us, we mean the one we started out with, not the discard we picked up in the shuffle. Why is it that the band is always just a bit better, the floor a little less crowded, and the party slightly more congeniai at some house that we never do get around to visit when our frater- nities are holding dances? It must be an illusion -all done by mirrors. Undergraduates are not what they used to h·e. We spent an hour at the Waldorf and no one even made a derogratory remark. We remember when aspersions were not the only thlng.s cast at that rendezvous after an evening of rnerrimen.t. There was one night that ... Oh well, let's forget about the broken ketchup bottles and the skinned knuckles. It must be the depression; everythin.g else is blamed on it. Our candidate for the most blatant inconsist- ency: the driver who bewailed the fact that som.e one had parked next to a fire hydrant, because sh:.e didn't have room to run hE!r chariot in beside his. If lmiger chapel speeches are going to mean the postponement of history quizzes, as Satur- day's program did, we're for them, mae and boy . . . we're wondering what happened to the an- nual training-breaking party the football squad usually throws the night before the last .g-ame. 01' did the gridiron warriors really hold their usual smoker? You can't prove anything by us? . , . who was the freshman who risked pneum011ia by falling asleep on the porch of the-hou.se? ( We left out the name because there is such a great bunch of fellows jn-. Ouch, we nearly gave away our little secret.) .... Incidentally a reward will he paid for information leading to the discovery of the culprit who let the air out of two of our tires while our car was parked near the Idol, We have a strong suspicion 'but we can't p-rove any-- thing. We'd like to apologize to that alumnus whose name we couldn't recall Saturday afternoon. He used to sit in the northeast corner of our philos- ophy class, and just to pr<Jve we did remember hiin l:lis name is J\oe or was it Bin? ... Well be cailed us Art, so he can't complain about our i ·. slipping up. Quite seriously, however, these alumn-i week- ends are ,great stuff. Good .football games, swell parties, and congenial little gatherings to-well, to talk over old times. Let's have more <lf them! We're very glad we met the grads that we did, and we're sorry we didn't see the fellows whom. we missed, all except that so-a:nd-so wh<:> snakecl. our woman at the Junior Prom in our fres}lman. year after he had sent us over to the house for' his cigarettes.

McGee ON SELECTING CAPTAINS This is a good time to review the method by which we select team captains. Perhaps there is a better way to choose our athletic leaders so that the teams take less r-isk in being \disorganized'' by the disgruntled members who believe the let- termen made a poor choice -the previous year. At present the lettermen, immediately after the season is over, choose some junior to be cap- tain in his senior year. There is no sure way of knowiltg that the man elected will be certain of making the first team the following year. For example, during the past five years, only two foot- ball captains have been ·outstanding players, while three others have been, weU, fair. It was no acci- dent when fair captains were elected that their teams had \difficulty in becoming organized units eaz1y in the· season; the men who were better quaiified for the responsible leadership of the te;:tm l:iad sympathizers on the squad and it took a long time for th!'lm to realize that \for the good of ~he team:• they had to pull together. . WJ:ay not avoid such friction in the future on !Lit our. teams? This mortgaging the future of the · · teain$ by choosing a captain one year in advance has hurt not only the football team but most of · tlie' other teams. . ,, . Rutge:rs and Lafayette have found a solution . to this problem and their experience warrants seri.Q.tfs consideration. .!nBtead of electing a junior to be captain the following year, both Rutgers and Lafayette team::; , .. at the .en!l of the season, el~ct from among the · .. seniors: one to be honorary captain of the team. During the .season proper, a field captain is ap- pointed for each game by the coach. It may be ~1:\e same player, or it may be a different player •, ,e~u;:tl ~ame. !' .. · What are the advantages of this system? For on~: tb.ing, everyone on the team considers the · teaJ;IJ. first, even the seniors, for they all have thll ~-,opportunity of being chosen captain at the end of tb.eir athletic careers. There is no longer any of that \well I have my letter, and I should have ···been captain ..... \ stuff to hamper the team. . · W:e are!' all human and by holding the great honor ·of\oaptaincy to the last, all members of the team 1 from· sophomore to senior, hold themsel~es con~ ... t>tan~ly: alert to any opportunity to work for the 4J,e~ .. a,na thus· qualify fu the prize of most ath-:: . ·.letes~captain Of the team. 'j :· I I I' li>efol\e we come to college, while the other groap expect to acquire in colleg.e the rudiments of a training which are :supposed to he obtained at home, No co'llege is supposed. to furnish this. F0r those of. you who were in chapel a week ago this mornhtg, must recall that Mr. Tidmarsh. was rude- ly 'inteT·rupted. it has been his custom for so:tne t.lm·e to play one or . two deUghtful organ seiec\ tions on every other Friday .of the month. Re had proceeded to play only a few notes when he was most impolitely d·isturbed. The cause of the dis~ turbance beinr,- the whimperings and snickerings of so:nw of oar uncultured companions. There is no question of doubt but that most o:li us thar- oughly enjoy Mr. Tidmarsh's efforts and for the most paM, will gladly· repay him---.-l;ly acting like gentlen:Ien. I'm sure he is offering his ·valuable moments to the studenili body not because se seeks applause ·every so often but r.at.ll,ex •. ,J;)ecause he is interested, heart and sowl In Union students. If my j>owe1·s of memory funetien correctly, .this Is the sec()n.d occasion of disturbance within a year. One can~ot blame l'):im for refusing to play if a thi·rd time occurs. The :musicians playing for the dance at the Beta house last Saturday night complained of a terrible noise from the outside. One of the boys at the house managed to qUiet the dancers and as a result the noise was heard by everybody. From the rear of the house cam~ a chug, chug, a grind- ing; allod a scraping seund. Everyone thought that the disturbance eminated from a steam shov- ·e'l. Some inquired as to whether or not the col- lege had instituted a course in Mine Engineering. Some of the more curious members rushed to the window. What do you think they saw? Why, Mr. Robert Wiley, alias \Barney Oldfield./' was trying ill vain to get his father's big sedan out of the young fo·rest with its g:ulleys and rocks locat- ed in back of the fraternity. The wheels were sunk S<> deep in the earth that \Ricky\ was able to stand on the fenders and howl at hi;S master's ill luck. Heard about twa interesting events which happened after the recent Colgate-Syracuse game: The :first concerns a Colgate scholar who be- 'c~me so jmbued with the spirit of-shall I say vmtory. Anyway he felt so wonderful that he en- deavored \fo tackle a concrete post and as a result broke his shoulder. Ah, ha, material for coaches who seek brute force. The second concerns another Colgate youth with pugilistic aspirations. \By the way, Phi Delts, here was a brother Phi who did not try to throw a. goat.\ During a dance which was held at ohe of the fashionable haters at Syracuse after the game, the person in mind proceeded to attack a .Syracuse football piayer. The little old Colgate pugilist was doing nicely, and he seemed to have ti:e better .of the fracas when the foott>all player'e girl appeared on the scene. Realizing that her big hero was in dire need of assistance, she im- mediately .took off one of her shoes. After leath,.. er:11g the unfortunate fellow around f()r a fev; moments, she finally brought him to the floor with a beauttful blow on the head with the aid of the slipper and thus sent him out of the land of the PINK ELEPHANTS. Capitalists, take notice-John D. Rockefeller has a nephew ::tt Princeton. However, this youno- chap1s name doesn't happen to be the same a~ uncle's. U.ncle Jehnny sent him a check the other day for a goodly sum. When the young fellow tried to cash it at the treasurer's office he met with the following reply, ''For :>rapol~on I've cashed them, but not for that one.\ I was talking to a friend of mine who has just purchased his tickets for the Yale-Harvar·d football classic tomorrow. I asked him now the ~eats we rc ? \Why old fellow,, they are wonderful,\ hP replied. \Have you ever tried to read the Lord's ·prayer on the head of a pin?\ For several years I have watched the owner of the \New Baby Racer\ and the other day I caine upon a few lines wll.ich ~::t:re .. qi,Lite .fitti,ng tor many of his fifty minutes or· c1asi! work: No fame I crave; before my eye A simpler goal I keep [ hope just once; before I die To get sufficient sl~ep ..

Nine undergraduates out of ten will veply when asked that the plan is a good one and that it would be nice to have a place on the campus where one can get something ta eat at night or a.t noon, but these same students would seldom plan on eating at the ca:lleteria. The Student Council proposes with the help of The Con- coTdiensis to determine what pel·- centage of the student body would patronize the new cafeteria regu- larly, for, unless the project is as- sured of the support of the under- graduates, it would be sheer folly Three its opmwn. Just what methGd will be employed is yet to be det.-·r- mined, but the most probable means will be to have a brumot printed in The Concordiensis wioh- in the next few issues. To point out just how necessary it is for the Student Body to co-operate is unnecessary, for every undergrad- uate realizes the need for adequate and accurate information before any steps toward a cafeteria be taken. If there is a real demand for a cafeteria, this is the oppor- tu.nity to register the wishes of tbo Student Body; if such a project wou.ld be unsu.ccessful, now is the time to discover it, not after the college ha:s gone to the expense f>f refitting Silliman ha,ll DEAN'S LIST CORRECTION In the dean's list published in last Friday's issue of The Concord- iensis, several sophomore civil a.nd electrical engineers were omitted by mistake.

Six Music By RANKINE HINMAN ()n the Sunday afternoon pvo- gram, which is co10posed of music of pxaise, Prafessor Tidmarsb. will be assisted by a clhorus from the Fixst Presbyterian Church af Al- bany, of which he is organist and choir director, and \by- a number of vocal soloists. Tlle voices will be used in J. H. Maunder's \Song of Thanksgiving,\ a ~£umber contain- ing chorus parts, duets, trios, and a recitative and other solo portions. Tb.e p,rogram will open with Sil- ver's \Jubilate Deo\' (Praise God), Percy Grainger's \Colonial S011g,'' and Edward Mac DO> well's \Maes- toso.'' Silver is a contemporary English organist, m1:1sic editor, anrl composer of music :for the church and school. The music of Percy Grainger, who is an Australian by birth, is permeated with the spirit of his natal land, of England, of its folk music, and of its na.tive scenes. Edward Mac Dow~ll, one of the most characteristic and indepen- dent of American composers, is conspicuous for his })Oetic, roman- tic feeling, keen freshness, and beautiful harmonies. His program- matic titles indicate the poetical suggestiveness of hi:s works, a sug- gestiveness not, however, of ma- terial objects but of their moods and the emotions wnich they evoke, especially through the medium of tlJ.e supernahtral in nature. The twenty-fifth anniversary of the :f!ounding of the Mac Dowell Colony in Pete~bo:mngh, N. H., will be observed in New York on De- cember seventh in Carnegie han and also throughoat the countlji'. Among the conductors announced to talre part in the observance are Stokowski, Tosca.ni:ni, Koussevit- zky, Sokoloff, Von Heogstraten, Stock, ande Gabrilovi:ts-ch. It is interesting to note that, while occupying the chair of mu- sic at Columbia 1Jniversity, Mac- Do-well included anLOng his works a number of songs for Columbia. Swinn's \Sunshine Toccata,\ which is described by its title, will close the program. ':I:'hose who went over to Albany for the Theater Guild's production of O'Neil's \Mourning Becomes Electxa\ were able to obser~e an excellent utilization of music to sup]lly atmosphere and background, especially in the dock scene, one of the play's most effective settings. The music is woven. so artistically with the lighting, scenery, and act- ing tbat it does not in the least distract one's mind from the drama in spite of the full, mellow richness of the chantyman's voice.

'I'homas THE CAFETERIA A ·ballot is published in this issue of The Con- cordiensis to determine the number of students who would take advantage of a cafeteria, if it were established. The financial position of the college does not permit the remodeling of Silliman hall so as to mil.ke a sumptuous, first class cafeteria. :However, Dr. Day has said that he would make possible a sanitary, clE!an place where a student may obtain ·a wholesome lunch for fifteen or twenty eents, if the j>atronage will warrant it. The Student Council is attempting to deter- mine the a:pproxitnate number of undergraduates who wou}d use this cafeteria, if it wez-e to become a reality. .

One of the frosh testified· that lle would rather try to open a hole through . any portion of the line other than that section guarded by Waldron. Steady and dependabl~, Waldron should dominate the varsity line next year. FOOTBALL CAPTAIN::, DECLARED NEE-DLEss· The \foolish little drama;' of electing a football captain should be abolished because there is no need for a captain in modern foot- ball, states \The Pennsylvanian.\ student daily at the University of Pennsylvania, in a recent editorial. The editorial declares, \However if it is felt necessary to have a. specially appointed man to face the barrage of newspaper cameras while he calls the turn of the eohi ... let the coaching staff pick three eligible candidates and allow the, team to make the final selection from these. \Politics and football cannot be mixed. Friction is the result. The animosity growing out of the de- feat of several candidates and the selection of another does not quick- ly die. It often carries far into the succeeding season.\ CA.NDIDATE HAN AGERS the reserves, are expected to con-. tribute much to the caliber of the playing. The first squad cut was made this afternoon. Those who reported for the first SOPHS IN BACKFIELD time yesterday are Kendrick, Dill, Rotunda, Coppola,. Single, Semerad, Clem Smith, Parker, Kuttler, Mur- ray, Barnett, Iversen, and Connelly, all members of the football squad. Two of this year's newcomers to the outfit have been showing up very well. They are Ed Barna, '34, and Joh,n Moffett, a member of last year's frosh team. Sam Jack- son, tL member of the freshman team two years ago, is tun1ing in some outstanding performances. Among the most promising veter- ans are Frank Higgin!'l, '33, Harold Ackley, '33, and Purcell Dow, '3zt. INTRAMURAL BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT Entries for the annual intra- mural basketball tournament will be received until 5:00 P. M.,, No- vember 30, at the gymnasium of- fice. .All managers are urged to· file their entries promptly. 20 YEARS A.GO Ralph Sem- erad undClubt- • edl:V turned in the m()St note- wortb.y bits of · acti<~n in the backfield. His · efforts were · not gallery winners, but , to thfrse \in : the· know'' Semerad ac- counted for the most solid work of the R. D. Semeracl season. Disap- pointed in his play dul'ing the early portion of the season, we were forced, after thinking a bit, to concede his true worth. In -backing up the line Semerad could be counted upon. He wa.:s labelled, by one of the ,oJcltimers, .the best defensive baelt seeg on Alexander ft.eld in years. On the ·offensive, especially in -the aerial department, he. turned· 1iJ. some splendid work. Seen on the re- .oeiving end of many a shor:'t pass, he netted the Garnet.a great deal· of yardage. His punting was timely and steady. !~oUT 1864, farmel'8 began to grow White BurleyTohacco. A few casks were taken to the St. Louis Fair in 1867 and sold for 58c a pound. White Burley Tobacco is used to make Granger. It is the best pipe tobacco that grows. You will notice the dif- ference as soon as you light up your pipe of Granger. It hums slower, smokes coolet and never gums a pipe. ~rrs-rc~ All sophomores who are desirous of becoming candidate assistant managers of hockey are asked to report to John English at the Phi Delta Theta house or to Bill Buchan- an at the Delta Phi house at once. Because of the unusually crowded schedule of games this year, a large number of candidates is needed. Union College's 'football' record for the season was announced as five victories, one defeat, and two no-score games. Wesieyan won the only game the Garnet lost but captured it by so wide a margin that the season's point score was 49 for Union to 58 against it. \Chip\ Dain is another \com- .er.\ Seen in action during the middle of the season for tbe first time, has ball-carrying leolr::ed im· .pre$slve.

Six !J: ______ M_u_s_ic---~ l By RANKINE HINMAN The ve1y polished presentation of Maunder's Thanksgiving can- tata which was given Sunday by a chorus from the First Presbyterian Church, Albany, added a very pleasing variety to the program. The gr-oup was well balanced and their enunciation and tone uH.usual- ly careful. F1or us the high point of the work was the equisite te- ner-soprano-centralto trio, \God the Lord Hath Spoken,\ with its beautiful pianissimo rendition. Maunders has supplied an unus- ually effective accompaimnent for the work and exceptionally artistic interludes. Swinnen's \Sunshine Toccata\ reminded us very much in its opening and closing part o:li the Toccata from Widor's Fifth Sym- phony and, in one or two other por- tions of Clokey's music; it is a re- marl~able example of power inter- mingled with more delicate shades. Incidentally, Profes~9r Tidmarsh has studied the \Coldii'ial Song\ on the piano with its fQOniposer, Percy Grainger, whom he....knows person- ally. \Thievish Magpie\ Last week we had the opportun- ity of hearing for the first time a delightful European recording of the overture to Rosinni' s \Thievish :Magpie\ (Grazzo Ladr,oj, of which there is unfortunately no record available here. The work, done by the Berlin Philharmonic orchestra, is of a highly witty, humorous nat- ul'e with charming contrasts and mock seriousness and pomp, just the thing to listen to while one sups tea and consumes slices of sponge cake. Hamilton Musical Art Society It is occasionally interesting to consider notes on musical activity in other colleges. At Hamilton the Musical A11t Society is offering eight programs for t.wo dollars, artists to include Severin Eisen- berger, one of the ten leading pian- ists in the country, and Louise Bernhardt of the Chicage Civic Opera Compan~r whose personality made such an impression here when she appeared last year with the Schuberts. The Russian Symphonic Choir recently opened a series of concerts at Rutgers. Wesleyan is holding a series of Sunday afternoon ves- per recitals, the first of which was given by the Zimmer Harp Trio. A new edition of the Williams College Song Book containing only currently used songs is to appear this week. At Colgate the music appreciation lecture by Chotzinoff, who appeared here several weeks ago, was held in the Delta Upsilon House. Walte:r Dam:rosch's Program Walter Damrosch's Friday morn- ing program will this week illustrate the use of the oboe, Enclish horn, and bassoon and music of sorrow and happiness. It included: the Largo from Dvorak's \New World\ Symphony, Intermezzo from :Men- d~lssohn's \.A Midsummer Night's Dream,\ Allegretto from Brahms' SYmphony II in D, FUneral March from Beethoven's \Eroica\ Sym- phony, and works of Saint-Saens, Bizet, and Johann Sfra:Uss; Jr. Wednesday afternoon the West- minister Choir program will include \Summer Is I'Cumen in,\ Brahms' \Grant Unto Me the Joy of Thy Salvation, \0 Lovely Peace\ :from Handel's \Judas Maccabeus,\ and an arrangement of \Oh Suzanna,\ by Clokey, whose colorful, modern programmatic organ numbers Pro- fessor Tidmarsh has played occas- ionally. ACKNOWLEDGE GIFT The Mountebanks, Union <.Jollege dramatic organization, gratefully acknowledge the set of drapes which was presented to it by the Delta Upsilon fraternity. The gift was made jointly to the Mounte- banks and the Schenectady Civic Players. FRENCH CLUB MEE'I'S There wm be a meeting of the French club tonight at 8 o'clock in Silliman hall.

Melinette UNDE:RGRADU ATE SPIRI'l' AND THE CAFETERIA The m.ost complete lack .of undergraduate ac- tivity bas been shown in regard to the interest of .students. in voting their favor or disapproval of the proposed cafeteria. It is almost incomprehen- sible how so many supposed intelligent men can express such an unusual display of inertia. ·Au students were asked· to ex:press their opin- ions by filling- out the ballot printed in Friday's iB$Ue of The Concordiensis. Announcement was made of this last week in. Student Body meeting and again yesterday. In reply to this request, ONE ballot w.as turned in. at the Publication of- fice. What is the cause of this apparent decided disinterest in undergraduate affairs? Are men too busy with more important taslts to take an active interest in their own welfare? How can undergraduates expect an administration to at- tempt to help the undergraduate conditions here at Union, if these same men are too busily occu- pied to ex:p:ress their sentiments toward this prop- osition wllich is of immediate importance to all of us. The Student Council cannot carry student .opinion t'() the administration in an attempt to improve undergraduate conditions if a passive in- terest wh:ich might well not exist, as far as its .benefits a.re concerned. TJ:J.e l>allot is again published in this issue. If .enough men express their opinions favol,'ing tho proposed cafeteria, Dr. Day will attempt to estab- lish it, bat he certainly will net take any action until a more active interest is shown by the stu- .dent body-. EDUCATION-AND AID NOT AN INSURANCE Statistics. taken in the correct light often lead on to fortune, given the wrong interpretation these same sta.tistics cause ruin and destruction. According- to a recent statistical report of the Em- ployment Stabilization Research Institute, only one percent of the unemployed In November, 1930, were college graduates. Nevertheless, this state- ment does not insure the present student again:'ilt ever being unemployed. It does not even guaran- tee that the chances are 100 to 1. In the same report was. the fact that less than one-hundredth of one percent of the unemployed The Column II When Column Is Supposed To Written And No One Writes It. 'l1his Is What Happens were shoe-makers. We hasten to say that in neither case is this an assurance that by belong- ing to a pa.rticular g1:oup one need not fear unem- ployment. Education is merely a tool placed in the hands of a particular few by which these few may pro- tect themselves against the wiles of misfortune. Exactly the same as a hammer and a few meagre tacks aid a cobbler in shoeing himself out of the clutches of unemployment. Every day the group of college graduates is increasing and the various types of people who have enjoyed this honor have taken advantage of it to its fullest capabilities, as shown by the above statement from the statistical report. /1. report of this sort merely shows what has gone before and does not take upon itself any power or ability to predict what will come in the future. It is entire- ly up to the individual what he makes out of his education. Education is merely an aid in avoiding unemployment, not an Insurance against it. Syracuse Daily Orange. USE OF SILLIMAN HALL Silliman hall is being used in a most disre- spectful and ungentlemanly manner by a few men of Union college. The use of the magazines by these men, in defacing them and in some cases doing away with them, has reached such a point as to necessitate the immediate removal of this privilege if the condition is not removed. These magazines are purchased from the bud- g-et of the Y from funds contributed by under- graduates. The magazines are placed there for the benefit of all undergraduates, who otherwise might be unable to enjoy the priviledge of read- ing these books. To remove any copy from Silii- man hall is to deny all of us the privilege of going there and being able to read it. Unless this deplorable condition ceases to exist, no more magazines will be purchased · for Silliman hall. i: ' i I J· I ; : :; '. I Gentlemen's Clothing F .. hi.

Brooklyn Union College end Ashmore Mitchell believes that if enough students would patroni:ze · it, it would .be all right, but if they didn't support the cafeteria, it would be useless to have one.

'I'homas Wade agrees with Ash Mitchell, but he reminds the stu.., dents that the proposed cafeteria would be more like the Sunday Pantry than the College Union.

Sitc LOCAL SCIENTISTS PRAISED BY DR. DAY Whit\ney Langmuir, and Cool\\ idge, Famous Research Men, Honored at Luncheon 'l'hur.sday Dr. Day spoke at a luncheon at the Rotel Van Curler given in honor of three nationally known scientists, Dr. Willis Rod- ney Whitney, retiring director of the General Electric research lab- oratory; Dr. William David Cool- idge, who is to succeed him; and , Dr. Irving Langmuir, their assoc- iate who was awarded the 1932 Nobel prize in cl:;lemistry. Among the other speakers was Count Clar- ence Rosen, equerry to King Gus-, tav of Sweden who representee!. the Swedish government under whose supervision the Nobel fund is administered. Speaking for the people of Sche- nectady as well as Union CoUege, President Frank Parker Day con- veyed to the scientists the city's deepest appreciation of what they had done in the past, its congratu- lations for their present achieve- ments and its belief and confidence in them for the future. Dr. Day Praises Scientists Dr. Day described the origin of the Nobel fund a.nd the provicsions for its distribution, and named the Americans who have won the award. Dr. Langmuir is the fif- teenth American to be so honored. During the course of his talk, Dr. Day outlined the lives of each of the scientists and their scientific t~~:'::IIEI?!!s. He said in part: \Schenectady is a s.mall city but it is rich in a number of. men of fine minqls and line . characters. Nothing ih the world is so impor- tant as a man o:f distinguished ll!ind; he is at once an insignificant pa:r~ of. the animal kfngdom and at Music By ~ANKINE I;IINMAN The first Schubert Club concert of the season will be given Thurs- day at 8:30 P. M. in the Memorial chapel. The repu.tation which the Schuberts have developed under P1·ofessor Tidmarsh gives promise of a thoroughly enjoyable evening. The guest artist, Mary Becker, is a young violinist who is rapidly achieving notability. The program, en which Miss Becker will play groups two, four, and six, is: I-\To God on High,\ Decius; \Ave Maris Stella,\ Greig; \March of the Wisemen,\ Gaul. ll -\Ave Maria,\ Schubert; \Cos- sack,\ Kroll. III-\Calm and Storm,\ Gibb; \Forest Harps,\ Schultz \To the Sea,\ Kramer. IV -\Siciliano Rigauden,\ Franceur- Kreisler; and \Caprice Crinois- Kreisler. V-\Gently John,\ Eng- lish Folk Song; \So Softly Sleep, My Love,\ Goldsworthy; \Chalita Schertz. VI-\Poem Fibich, anfl \Zigeeuner Weisen,\ Saraste. VII- \0 Come All Ye Faithful.\ The Schenectady orchestra will appear in the Mont Pleasant High School auditorium this Friday at 8:30 P. M. l'he first and major number will be Robert Schumann'~:~ First Symphony, kn.own as the \Sparing Symphony.\ The guest soloist, Charles Gilbert Spross, will play the Grieg piano concerto with the orchestra. Last spring a local pianist com- men ted to a group returning from the Empire State Symphony or- chestra's concert in All Saints Ca- thedral, Albany, that the concerto is an unnatural medium and will be used less and less. One might agree with him after hearing the performance then given of Rach- maninoff's C minor Concerto for piano and orchestra, in which Mr. Young almost ignored the soloist, but one could hardly feel so after listening to Mr. Stokowsky's per- formance last Saturday of Brahms' third concerto for violin, cello, and orchestra. This fusion of strength and beauty, of boldness and mel- ody, that is Bral!ms adopts itself to the concerto in a manner to completely dispel any doubts what- soever concerning the position of this music form, especially when it receives such a sympathetic beauty of treatment as was given It in Mr. Stokowsky's broadcast last week. the same time a god-like observer and creator in the universe. Sche-. nectady is indf)ed fortunate in hav-· ing Coolidge, Langmuir, Whitney. and rnany ether men of note- as cit-·' izens; Union College in havingi Whitney as a trustee, Coolidge and Langznuir as occasional lecturers. Speaking for the people of Sche- , necta:dy, for the faculty and URder- ' graduates of Unian College, for the: service clubs of Schenectady who have arranged this luncheon, I convey to these men our deepest appreciation of what they have , done in the past, our congratula- : tions for present achievements : and our belief and confidence in them for the future.\ McKIBBEN 'I'O SPEAK F!'ank P.
