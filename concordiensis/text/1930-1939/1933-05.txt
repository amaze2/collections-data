WHY THE COUNCIL REJECTED THE PROPOSED NOMINATING PLAN The Student Council, in spite of the vote of the Student Body, defeated the proposed amend- ment revising the method o:f nomination of Councilmen which the students passed Nearly two to one. The Council feels that, in view of the apparent opposition to the \'l'ishes of the Student Body, an explanation of the reasons for its action is in order. The Student Council does not wish to force the undergraduate body to abandon any reform or constitutional revision suggested, but opinion on the Council was so heartily against the nominating plan that it was deemed wise to defeat the measure. If the Stu- dent Body still wisl1es to incorporate the new nominating plan into the constitution, it may easily nullify the action of the Council next Monday hy repassing the measure by a two- thirds vote. The Student Council believes that very few of the Student Body would take the trouble to consider every name on the roll of the class in \he manner that the various boards do. Peri:Japs if the undergraduates understood just how the different class boards decide upon the nomina- tions, popular sentiment would at least be sym- pathetic toward the action of the Council. The outgoing senior hoard met for an hour :last Weclnesday evening with a complete list of the Junior Class hefore them. Each name was read and those men whom some one of the senior board recommended was marked for future con- sideration. The first reading resulted in over fiftv names being considered in detail. A second reading reduced the possible nominees to thirty- six and a third cut down the number to twenty- seven. Last night the senior hoard deliberate({ for an hour and a half over the elimination of nine men from that list of twenty-seven and we feel tl1at a more representative choice than the list of nominees to he presented to the Stuclent Bodv could only be selected with a great deal of difficulty. The Council felt that few members of the present Tunior Class woul~ spend two ~ou;s. and a half discussing the ments of the mdtv1d~1al possible nominees and that personal acqu:un- tanceships would play a more important role than estimation of real ability in the proposed nominating system. The Council excluded as far as possihle all personal opinions and Y'?t.ed strictly according to the fitness and capab1hties of the candidates, and this exclusion of personal llias will he apparent in the list of nominees, for some of those men selected have bitterly op- posed the present Council throughout the year. The Council has selected a slate for the Student Body's approval, and the Council defends its po- sition on the nominating plan. The Council's reasons for rejecting the proposal have been ·set forth. The Student Body, having heard the ob- jections, wiH still have an opportunity to put in- to effect the proposed scheme, although it is to be regretted that no action can be taken that will affect the nominations this year. THOMAS J. WADE ASSEMBLY COULD BE IMPROVED The nine students who. were interviewed by a reporter yesterday presented some excellent ideas concerning the improvement ·of Daily As- sembly. Since .only five ·OUt of nine do not ap- prove of the present manner of conducting the exercise it cannot be said that Daily Assembly is the dreadful bore that some students claim it to be. All nine,however, have offered some sort of constructive criticism, or at least, their re- marks represent th·e opinions of some group .. There seems to be a strong feeling that our exercises shouJ.d be .participated in, for the most part, by the coUeg-e. Some go as far as to say that students shou:Jd take part from time to time. It might he Worth trying. · There are a number of members of the facul- ty who never appear in the Chapel. Some of these absentees are capable of giving very in- teres-ting talks, and an effort shouJ.d be made to get these men to take part. We do mot feel that the religious element should be elim.i.n.ated entirely. Whatev:er may be a man's :beliefs, he ii:ann.ot be called educate@ if he has not a know;J'edge ·of the Bihle. It might be a goud pl'an, hocwever, to confine the conduct- ing of the religious services to members of .the faculty. Dr. LIGON is always popular, and Dr. JONES always chooses Se'Jiections from the Scrip.tures tha:·t are worthy o.f attention . It is too late t0 make any changes this year, but realizing that the committee is doing i:ts best to make a worthy institution as worth whi:le as possi!He, we should expect an improvement next year. LEGALIZED DEALS THE . WORST OF ALL. The •legalization of deals wotl'ld only seFve to hri,ng politics back to the U nioB College ca~pus. Since the formatiorr of the Student Council we haV:e been free from politics. Legalizing deals would pr.ofuably be the worst thing that could happen. In the first p•lace· many of our so-callecl hon- orary social societies which ate now defunct would again spring into prominence. They would proceed .to con.tro 1 elecHons, and everything would 'he sacrificed to br.ing success to the or- ganization. Recent elections of managers of teams have also heen comparatively free from politics, but legalize deals, and once again we would have the same unhealthy situation in these elections. There is enough hard feeling between the on- campus, off-campus and neutral groups now, b_ut by legalizing deals an open break would result making the situation much worse than it is now. There seems to, be a trend at present to give each o.f these groups a square deal. The pest thing to .do is leav-e things as they are as much as possible since there is evidence that efforts are being made to give every group representa- tion on the Student Council. j,1= 1 =H=ou=rs=T=ha=t s=· h=ine=~~ Paper, a typewriter, and an assignment. Tee Pee was two-thirds right. Somebody gave him a typewriter and some paper, but I wonder what became of the assignment. We'll have to admit though, that \columnist- ing\ is a task requiring all the hokum and arti- fice of a 1929 Junior Prom chairman. You have to write only stuff that makes the campus cow- boys thrust out their chests, and say, \Now I am somebody.\ Rather than point out the failings 'Of the has- beens, it would be more appropriate to give them a great deal of credit.

They didn't write too much that was mendacious; but even if they had, you can't expect a couple of rheumatic sons to chase all over the Mohawk Vale, and yea, even into the far north country to check up on some wo1·thless but exciting hit of scandal. Anyhow, far be it from me to judge the dead. Bravo, Elmer! Those of you who were in Chapel Friday morning must have enjoyed it: we ·did, immense- ly.

' Four Glee Club Scores Hit <Continued from pag-e 1) The dance following the concert was well attended. Everyone had ample opportunity to test their terpischorean skill, because there were only seventy-ti.ve or a hun- dred stags. The Union men were lodged for the night at various fraternity houses or with Union alumni. Mad Scramble, Mad Dash Sunday night witnessed superb efforts of all the clubs and the Ro- chester Civic orchestra. Following ,the \Star Spangled Banner,\ which the audience jeined in singing (the words were printed on the program) there was a mad scram- ble to the dressing rooms, hasty fareweHs, and a mad dash for the bus. As the Unien men sauntered into the Waldorf in Syracuse for breakfast they presented a motley appearance. Pajama tops, dressing gowns, bedroom slippers, and wrinkled and creased tuxedo trous- ers were much in evidence. The same bass who caused so much difficulty on Friday night insisted on sleeping formal; when he ar- rived at the campus, although he had worn the shirt at three affairs, it was in perfect shape. It was suspected that the rest of the bavelers didn't afford him much opportunity to sleep. HERE 1 S' A fUNNY OtvE THAT t-IA'P'P£NfD TO ME LAST NIGHT AT 4 MAGIC. S'+IOW. HE GOT THE.

One is the way of suspicion, the way of greed de- manding its pound of flesh, the way of the lust of the flesh and the pride of office. The other is the way of magnanimity, the way of generesLty to the debtor, the way of th.e man who does justly, loves mercy and walks humbly with his God. The one is the road to war, the other the path of peace.'' SENIOR NOTICES All Seniors must purchase their Commencement announcements and invitations before noon Saturday.

Larrabee who is at Harvard on leave for this semester spoke at the April monthly dinner of Leverett House Thursday. His subject was, \The Background of a Fameus Ameri- ·can Family,'' dealing with the Jameses, a family connected with both Union and Harvard.

Played For Charity A few days ago Ozzie Nelson finished play·ing his dinner session at the Hotel New Yorker at promptly 9 o'clo.ck. A police escort was waiting to take him to the air- port in Newark where he and his pianist immediately bordered a speed plane for Philadelphia. Twen- ty-five minutes after leaving New- ark, he was on the band stand in the city of brotherly love. Follow- ing an appearance there of one hour, he immediately sped back to New YQrk where he was again leading his own band at mid?:light. His total expenses including the plane, were $86, and his sole re- muneration was-happinese;. Yon see, it was a benefit affair for un- dernourished children, !l,nd in De- cember while in Philadelphia on tour, Ozzie had promised one of the patronesses that he would ap- pear. That's the real O~ie Nelson. Nelson has refused lucrative of- fers for the pictures, because he likes band leading and wants to stay with his men. His men swear by him, and in the last two years have never.' failed to draw a full weeks pay.

Painter ASSEMBLY WILL BE IMPROVED f'h,:=tt Dean ELLERY is anxio\ts to give the majonty of students what they want in Daily As~embly next year is conclusively shown by . his appointment of..a committee to outline plans for our daily exercises next year. It is hoped that the Student Body will show the same spirit of cooperation by offering a large number of criticisms and suggestions. It seems that there have always been a num- ber of complaints about Daily Assembly, but the undergraduates have never taken the trouble to take any steps to improve the situation. Now that an opportunity is offered, there is no rea- son why a number of desirable C·lunges. cannot be made next year. Some students seem to be of the opinion that Daily Assembly should be conducted by the un- dergraduates occasionally. This suggestion is very worth while, and there is every reason to believe that it wiii be followed next year. The only way to please the major:ity is to se- cure a larg-e number of opinions. A great many students would prefer to suffer almost any tor- ture rather than write a letter to 'f'he Concordi- ensis .. A g-reat many more are· satisfied if they , can offer destructive criticsm an(! let it go at that. Again we urge the entire Student Body to consider the Asilembly situation carefully, and to take the trouble to offer suggestions. All opinions wi11 be considered, and any good ideas will be adopted. I AM GOING TO PROM I am going to attend this year's Junior Prom, because I sincerely feel that this year's dance will be the best that I have been able to attend. The committee is working earnestly to make the dance a·s enjoyable as possible. All arrange- ments have been completed with Mr. Nelson and the decorators, and the committee will clean the entire floor for the dance-a ml!lch needed improvement. · Tickets are selling well, with . a great flood of buyers expected tonight and tom(lrrow morn- ing by the committee, since the price scale will jump from six to seven dol:lars after tomorrow at two o'clock. Stag tickets are selling at four dollars. Some comment has been heard ,by those who have only 'liste:ned to Nelson's ba11d over the radio. The consensus of opinion seems to be that a louder band should be engage<l, since he seems to play only slow music, 1'<>rn Acheson wishes to clarify this po.int by saying that the management of the Hotel New Yorker does not permit Nelson to broadcast any fast music .. Nel- son will play the latest foxtrot numbers here, in teal foxtrot manner, at the same time varying the dances with some of his slower rhythms. Nelson has also planned a series of novelty ar~ rangements, never before used, for our Prom, and this alone will be well worth the price of admission. He has also arranged some very pleasing duets for Miss Hilliard and himself. The decorations are going to be better than ever and this alone will add to the .enjoyment of the evening, Fraternity booths will be dec- orated more artistically than in form~r years. That's why I am going to Prom. · · W. E. . . -~ ·THE. ·CONCORDIENSIS, FRIDAY, MAY 5, 1933 . ) ' ;.

THE FAT BOY JS THE CAUSE OF IT- The members of ·the Senior class who are registered in the Appreciation of Music course will be subjected fo·r the first time in the history of the course to a final examination. It seems that a certain rotund member of the class (I shan't mention his name because it might not be conducive for his good health in the future) revealed to certain we'll known personages a·bout this fair campus that he would not have to worry about a final in the Music course. Acco.rd- . ing to the very latest report Dean Garis insists that all Seniors in order to graduate must take the examination. WHAT THE SPIRITS OF SPAIN DID FOR ONE OF ELMER'S WARBLERS- Larry Dugan became highly sensational or melodramatic during the recent trip of the Glee Cluh to the western part of the state. It was brought to my attention by a \Big Irish Cop\ in Syracuse that Dugan was menacingly roving about the Salt City in bedroom attire. It was further impressed on me, that he was driven to such :ludicrous conduct by the exhilarating spir- its of Manzarilla. A PANSY TO EACH FOR THEIR PERSEVERANCE- It was called to my attention that \Pierce Arrow\ Gillette and his co'hort Smith made· nine errors between them during the recent Delta Chi-Sigma Phi softball game. THE PROFESSOR IS A GREAT MASTER OF FINE POINTS, SAY YOU? Professor Jagu's star French pupil Jerry Bar- nett, translated the ab'ove sentence in the fol- lowing manner much to the dismay of the Pro- fessor and delight of the class-Heta rofessorpa isa aha reatga asterma ofha inifa ointspa, eysa ouya? That's advanced st'Uff for Jerry too. DID YOU KNOW THAT- Tom Wade is simply furious because of the way the Idols are being put into use-the Psi U's use them for bases, the Phi Delts for pro- tection from the cold stone and Bill Buchanan stuffs the· shoes which he has on display in Washburn with the pages from the Idol. That- a maniac rushed up to Bay Hutton and said, \I didn't know that you had an Insane Hospital at Schenectady.\ That-the Dean of Russell Sage is diligently searching for Reginald James Wal- rath for disfiguring the \sign oat book\ with his John Henry. That-the Swarthmore students were absolutely wonderful in regard to the hos- pitality which they extended to our Lacrosse team last Saturday. That-it was a lun:;ttic which caught the fa11cy of Markel and not one of the secretaries at the Utica Hospital for Insane That-Gerard Neumann was seen sauntering across the campus with an African Game Hunt- ers Hat pulled down over his eyes. That- John English will rent his fratt~rnity pin to ;my unattractive co-ed or Skidmoreite for the week- end of May, thirteenth. That-the music of Oz- zie Nelson should he broadcasted from the gym; publicity of this tyr>e would add plenty to the reputation of the college. 1t would be worth the added expense. Tee Pee MUSIC By RANKINE HINMAN Sunday Professor Tidmarsh will offer an un- usually varied program, on which Miss Lillian Ross, solo soprano of the First Presbyterian Church, Albany, will be the guest artist. The organ program is .composed of Mendelssohn's Sixth Sonata, Reene Becker's Sonata in G minor ar;d, May songs by composers of three nation~ alttJes. The Mendelssohn Sonata, the last of a group composed for the organ in an effort to revive intel'est in that instrument and especially in the works of Bach, shows a close affinity to that coml?oser although lacking his profundity. It cons1sts of a Chorale based on \Our Father in Heaven,\ followed by flve variations, a short Fugue, and Finale. Mendelssohn's music is in many respects the most perfect ever composed, reflecting the unusual opportunities he had to develop his art, uninhibited by the worries and strife more dominant in lives of other compos- ers. His happy life and natural penchant for neatness, good taste, and efficiency have pro- duced music unsurpassed irt refinement, bril- liance, and firmness. But we must not . .think ot Mendelssohn as fo.llowing a life o:f leisurely ease; he was ex- tremely fond of all sports, billiards, chess, danc- ing, and an adept at drawing and letter writing, but the attention and labor he devoted to music were tremertdous'-not only in playing and com- position, but irt establishing a great conserva- tory. In order to i-nsure a ,closer con- tact between the Amherst Student ' CounGil and the President's office, \th.e trustees appointed a sehior . Dwight W. Morrow,. as assistant • io the President for the coming • .academic year. \The Amhel'st Student\ says in an editoria;l, '' '!Student feeling, while often radi- : .car, frequently is the expression of .a necessary change. On ·the other · liand steps taken by the adminis- tration are frequently- misunder- stood by the students.. A young .alumnu~ in the positio·n .of assist- ant to the President should be able . to reconcile the two p()sitions with resulting good feeling on ,both .sides.\ * * * \' N able Sissie. and his A.mbassa- deurs are playing at the Junior Prom May 12.

At times bright unexpected comets have been found by casual observ- el's of the sky. Such may possibly be the experience of anyune who is on the job.

Herbert's ••Two Gentlemen of Soho\ which the Mountebanks will jointly present on Fr~day and Sat- urday night began last Friday. It appeal's that the Mountebanlts theatre wHI again have capacity audiences as t.t had for Hamlet last March. The fir13t d:ress rehearsal was . held in the Mountebanks theatre last night. A fun orchestra under. the direction of Mr. Tidmarsh : which has been rehearsing with- , out the cast for the last month ac- companied the cast of \Trial by . Jury\. H. William Smith, '33, due to an injury to his foot has been forced to drop his part which was taken up by Nigel P. Altman, '33. The part is not new to Altman, who is an experienced and finished actor, since he has taken parts in numerous Gilbert and Sullivan op- erettas both in this country and in Eng}and where every schoolboy has the songs of these colorful and humorous operettas on tip tongue. From .all indications of the rehearsal this production ought to be better by far than the pro- duction of this same operetta giv- en three y(,'!ars .ago under the di- rection of Mr. Carroll, who in this production is concerned with the staging alone leaving the music to Mr. Tidmarsh. • UNION COLLEGE, SCHENECTADY, N.

Katzberg \REVIEW PERIOD\ rt. seems that a number of the faculty intend to continue holding classes threughout ;t.he so· ca1Jed review }1>eriod. It is thei·r privileg~ to d.o S(), but if we are going to have two weeks set aside for the purpose of review, either aU a.cade· emic classes should be :discontinued, at the be· ginning of the period, or all classes sho'1:l:ld he C()ntinued until tl'l.e peginning of exam week. Many professors fear that if they do not hold classes their students will not review. Conse- quent!;, they devote the two weeks to su}lervised re¥iew. This plan is seldom satisfactory. Each student is forced to review in accordance with the outline provided for by the instructor rather than study the subject when and how he chooses. There is a number of students at Uni()n Col- lege with intelligence enough to pass a final ex .. arnination with little or no review. Thos:e who ai\e not anxious to make :first grades often' take their finals without opening a boCJok. There is no reason WhY they should review i.f they calL rnake grades satisfactory to themselves without doing so. The policy for tl:te review period, whatever it isi should be con:oistent. At present it is not. If we are going to have two weeks of supervised study in some academic courses, why not u:se this system in all classes in the A. B. courses. If we are going to have two weeks to ·do as much or as little ·review as we choose, why not discon- tinue all classes Monday? One thing is certain: classes during the review period are not popu- lar among the students. ------------------- WHO COULD DO A BETTER JtO:B? The list of nominations presented by th.e Stu- dent. Council yesterday morning should comvince all students that the present system of nomina- ti()n for the Council is the best. Ten fraternities are represented on the lists of the three classes. At least one neut.ral is no.minated from each class. Practically 'every nominee is well known by the majority cnf tht;l ·members of his class. · As long as it is evident that the best men on the campus are on the Student Council,· any at- tempt to change the nominations system should be disregarded. M'U SIC By RANKINE HiNMAN Friday evening the Schubert Club of Scihenec- t::jdy combined with the Troy Vocal Society to give one of the most inspiring concerts of the year. Beginning with the majestic strength ·of Handel's \Why Do the Nations,\ the two clubs carried their audience through every emotion vcca.I music can actuate. The p<>werful >Cesar- Franck arrangement of the 150th Psalm. :was magnificent, but no more effective than the gen- tle, .romantic \Where'er You Wallt\ and •~Music When SOft Voices Die,\ sung with a beauty of e:xin·ession and warmt1l of tone, even in the most e:xquisite pianissimo passages, that was inc:vedi- ble for such a large chorus yet impossible wlth.- Ollt it. We have heard the Schuberts give many ex- cellent concerts, hut none greater than thi.s. As w~ watched the singers we felt ,they too were u:irusually inspired; the two clttbs seenl~Ctl to mutually effect each other, much aE;J occurmed in R.()ohester when the Colgate and Union clubs sang- ..

Her voice, however, was distinctly pleasant and well-controlled; it occasionally seemed to de- crease in resonance and clarity in the lower reg~ isters, and· was forced at times on extremely high notes, as in the \Blue Danube\ and the ·.11 \Russian Nightingale,\ but for the most part her ·. 1 voice was unusually good, especially in. gentle, soaring parts.

We appreciate greatly the efforts of Professor Tidmarsh to bring Miss Passmore to u:o Friday morning; we may be somewhat critical of her, but nevertheless we thoroughly enjoyed her work at both appearances. As ·these Friday morning musical interludes 1 which have consti- tuted such an appreciable a:nd eagerly anticipat- ed part of life on the campus, are concluded for the present semester, we express. our gratitude to Professor Tidmarsh. We have enjoyed the music he has brought us, but, more than that, we have felt the strength of his character. It is not without reason thal he is one of thi=l most popu .. lar men on the campus; he is one of those pi\O\' fessors who are an i'rnmeasurable 'asset to any college, one of t'hos.e whose personality permeates the student body · and whose influence lingers upon its students iong after they have forgotten book knowledge imparted in the claSsroom, • PETERS DAIRY Nearest to College SERVICE ALL DAY MILK BUITER MILK CREAM FRESH EGGS PHONES--.4-0947·2·0411-.R· Ketz''s C lrinity J Garnet Takt: W .. 1ns .

Remember when Swarthmore,· our new Garnet opponents, de- : feated our Garnet? The Pur- ; pte team consists of practical- ly all sophomores. The letters they wore were awarded in· basltetball.

It is an indication of ·-what ·Can be ac- complished under our new system in the new Publications Offi~K.e• CHARGE TO THE STUDENT COUNCIL You who have just been elected to the 'Stq.- dent Council a~e now in a. position of great re- sponsibility. The work <lone \by your predeces- sors is worthy of the highest praise, and the Stu- ·dent Body expects equally as much from you. The chief duty of the C<>u.ncil is to work hand Jll hand with the Administration with one object in view-the betterment of t.Jnion College. If you can accomplish something in this direction your work will be well done. Your authority will undoubtedly be question- ed by a group of chronic complainers. They will seek to change your cC>nstitution. Don't let ,them. As a whole you are an excellent group. The best brains on the campus are among your num- bers. We must admit, howe-ver, that some of your organization are not expected to be of any :great aid. TO OUR GUESTS To our guests for the week-end,, we extend, in · behalf of the Student :Body, a most cordial wel- come. We hope that you will enjoy your short stay with us to the limit. The college has arl\anged tn~ most attractive program possible. We are sui:1e that it will meet -with your approval. The ath'letic program has been arranged very cardul1y, and all the .con- tests are expected to be close, and well worth :attending. The Mountebanks and Glee Club have been rehearsing together for a number of weeks. 'Those who have seen the reliearsals assure us that these two organizations will present the ,best entertainment of the :year. TO NEXT YEAR'S TERRACE COUNCIL. We ex:tend . our heartiest congratulations to the newly elected members of the Terrace Coun- dl. It has been said that with the inauguration of the Student Council, th.at the 'Terrace Council would slowly die out. So far there has. been no indication of such bein,g the case. The Terrace Council is a valuable org-anization. Keep it as such. other weebends w.ere too much for hhn, not to mention that trip into Connecticut last fall- Guilty or not guilty? Guilty. Fifty dollars! But truly he is, a ·real sort of person, and we are cer- tain that the Mountebanks will be proud of him some day, we hope, when the name of Smith is fla~hed th.roughout Broadway in forty foot lights. We on the $taff do wish, however :that he would learn to use a typewriter as that scrib- ble is terribly hard to read, especial:ly when, we receive the copy at the last minute. Thomas J. Wade It was ottr sincere hope when we asked Tom to contribute a column to the Concordy to have at least one man on the staff who could turn out a sensible one. After reading the first one, and other-s, the signature of Toby meant ,noth~ ing more elevated than the rest. Not to degrade the others, of course, but we really did feel that some of you mugs should get a little of this here culture, hut what the hell, who cares .about that anyway, especially so this week-end! Tom also took the bat to Clinton, but may he be fo-given, or should he·? Aside from this sad attempt at humor, J do wish to state to t'he readers of The Concordien- sis that I have enjoyed working with the men and take this means of thanking them for the splendid. cooperation that they have afford~d me on the. paper. . W. T, ELDRED CONGRATULATIONS TO THE PROM COMMITTEE A great deal o£ credit is .due to the Prom Committee in general and MR. ACHESON in particular for the excellent work they have done to insure the success of the biggest dance of the year. Ins:J?fte of the bad times, cutting of the budget, and other such difficulties, the Commit- tee expects to make the dance a success. In spite of the general feeling of good will that is arou:nd the campus. at this time it must be said that the Junior Class as a whole has not · . supported its committee in the way it sh<>uld. At a meeting several weeks ago about one-fif- · teenth of the class was present. Prom was dis- ~ussed at that time, but very few Juniors s.igni- fied their intention of going. It n1igbt :be well for the Sophomore class to bear in mind that 'flext year it will be their dass that will be running the dance,, and that si11ce it is their class, they should support it .one hundred .per cent. made of coal I Typical of Western Electric care and precision in manufacturing Bell Telephop.e apparatus, is the making of the transmitter button which transforms spoken words into electrical impulses. This transmitter :button-the telephone's vocal cords-contains coal. Only a fine grade of se- lected anthracite, specially treated, is suited for this delicate work. First the coal is ground into fine granular form- next it is carefully sifted and washed. Then, after be,ing roasted in special ovens, it is put into the transmitter button. Approxi- mately SO, 000 tiny grains must go into each button . -too few or too many would impair transmission. Such infinite cate with ''little things'' is one rea- son why Bell System apparatus serves so faithfully. BELL SYSTEM ® .

Carl Clem Outstanding Athlete Clem is an outstanding athlete at Boston University-. He has earned seven major letters a.nd six minor awards. In 1932 he cap- tained the grid team and was vot~ ed the most outstanding athlete at the university; Wight was hon- ored with the captaincy of the Boston racquet wielders after only one year of varsity competiti()n and shauld prove a tough oppo- nent for Reggie Walrath. Coach Bill Aydelotte's eharges are in the pink of condition for this afternoon's match, their sixth of the season. Three outstanding men have been developed this spring, Higgins, 'Walrath. and Minch. The first two are In their last season on the courts fop Union, but Minch is a so)lb()more and has developed a keen eye and an accurate stroke. · Minch and Moffett Paired Minch pairs with Jack Moffett, another sophomore, to form the second doubles combinati()n which . has been a bit slow in getttng started, but it now shows .promise of being capable of becoming one of the best that Union tennis en- thusiasts have ever seen. All they need now is more experience to- gether. Grif'ti~h . has been . t)le J;'I);;M sur,.. · ])rise of t}Je spring- for Uni()n fans. He is a senior, a transfer from Mississippi College, and this is his only season of service for the Ga.r- I1et. Ev:er since the opening- match on April 28, he has played iL steady game, and has been a consistent perform.er. Iversen,. t()o, has play- . ed fine tennis, being one of the re- turning veterans of the 1932 outftt. Sam Keats, a ;Junior, is the re- maining veteran, who got off to a slow start, but turned in an easy victory in the Middlebury ~ontest. Keats will combine with Griffith for the third doubles team. Chrys- ler and Moffett, the remaining members of the team ha.ve not · eeen as much action as the rest, · but usually- -can be counted upon for good performances. Fraternity Softball Results .

Nitchman declared that, had tb.ese rules been in effect this year, \tlJe saving which would have ac- <lrued by these changes would have· been $1,129.50\. The committee was highly complimented by the board for its efficient action. For Better Cheering In order to improve the cheering at the athletic contests, the board authorized its secretary, .John Dearstyne, to recommend to the Student Council that four men be appointed to act under the guid- an~e of the board to \give enthu- siastic support in the promotion of student body cheering.'' The board :feels that cheering at •tJnion has sunk to a disgraceful level in the past year, and that the time for a change for the better snould take place. In the words o:f the secretary, \drastic steps will he taken to build up enthusiastic clteering; the board is going to n:Jake an earnest effort to bolster u.p the student body spirit\. The Athletic Board also dis- ·C1lssed in great detail the prac- ticability· of changing the mana- g-erial election system.

CARROLL and MR HISLOP have done m:uv:elous work all year, and they are largdy n!s]lonsible for the Mountebanks rising to their present .p:mminent position on the campus. W:hile we cannot mention everyone who took .part in the recent performances, we feel that several of the players must be mentioned. .MR. STANTON was excellent, as was MR. ALT- MAN and MR. CRANE. Anything PROFES- SOR TIDMARSH does for us in the way of en- terta.inment is always of the best. Union College is :most fortunate to have a man of his calibre. MUSIC By RANKINE HINMAN The .program of Sunday's organ recital was qui!e · aJ.>propriate to the mood of the week-end, consis'tiog of light, refreshing music. The re- cital was one of two given each year for chil- dren,'but the attraction of such music :;~.s the \Peer Gynt\ Suite and Cyril Scott's lyrics from \S11mmerland\ is for all ages. Sunday's program . was esp-ecially interesting because of the oppor- tunity it provided for a display of color in mu- \ sic and for the various types which the organ 'can produce. Mr. Trombini included in his group an ori·ginal number, \Cappriccio played without . accompaniment. . An extremely difficut number to .e.xecute, it brougl1t out the full resources of the i.nshument and was played with great skill. ·Unfortunately, we do not personally enjoy double stD.pping, which occurs frequently in the work. \Dedicatinn\ by Popper, with its melod- ic beauty and elegance of rhythm, was practical- ly appealing. It was more confined to the low- er, richer notes of the cello than are many pieces. Mr. Trombini's playing repeatedly reminds us of a passage of \The Autocrat of the Break- fast Table\ in which Holmes thinks of such an ins-trument as being impregnated down through the years with the beauty of· renditions by artists mb.o baNe !)reviously 'J)layed it until the v~ry resonance of its· wood has become an expresston of each owner's personality. Are we too mate- ria.listic, too rational to hold such a satisfying belief? Trial By Jury f f .\T'l'b J\ The Prom per ormance o · na y .ury · -wa:s one of the most enjoyable productions of .. the year, so thoroughly was it permeated with ·spir.it .and vigor, so thoroughly balanced and ·contl'Olled was its humour. Burlesque was never · -carried too far; intentionally wrong singing was nevef a:llowed to deteriorate into pQor or care- . · less singing. The orchestra contr'ibuted -con- .side1·ably to the success of the performance, as it did to the effectiveness of \Two Gentlemen o£ Soho.\ One might easily 1;>ick flaws in the work here and there, but to do so would be to lose sis-ht .-of the completeness with which the group met the prime requirement of Gilbert and Sullivan, oen:thusiasm and spontaneity. The audience's · unusually eager reception of the operetta, its . . Fr.iday, May 12 lt certainly was a long wait for the 1 :0) train tb.is afternoon. Gosh, ftom 12:30 on it seemed as though each minute lasted an hour. However, the train arrived on tim,e and -there were thous~ ands of people on it, ·but where is Dot? Ah, . ! there she is-down at the other end of the p:lat- form. What is she do'ing~movhrg into town? Guess I'll need two taxis to ;get all that jank to the Van Curler. \Ah heU0, deat, how are you?\ and with outstretched hands we met. Suild'enty I began to feel that there wou.rd lbe nothing bet- ter for me than a bit of .privacy with Dot. \Ytes dear, that is the best hotel in the city. Wa.it un- til you see yoor room.''

Gosh, I didn't like the way that she and. J ad~ looked at each other at the dinner tahle-we can't each one of us be an Adonis. We almost laughed ourselves sick at \Trial by J.ury-.\ That Shakespeare guy must have been quite a boy in his heyday. And then PROM ! ! Sway-ing hips, flashy eyes, dreamy tunes, happy people, pleasant aromas, ·lovely smiles, sweet Harriet Hilliard's singing-presto! \Let's get out and gei some air, you must see Jacksori's Gar- den.\ Gosh, I thought I'd never come ou:t of it in there. * * * * * Well, after we went b:ack to the gym, I excused myself to ask Miss Hilliard for a dance, btJ.t Ozzie s:;1id no, as he had to so many others, the old tightwad ..

M. :Saturday, May 13 Gosh, I felt like apologizing to Dot tod.ay for fhe trimmings we took in track, baseball attd la- crosse~ I couldn't think of enough alibis ·f<>r- los- ing all three. The Psi U tea dance came in handy, .after sports became rathe.r boresome. And then the dinner dance; gee, the m.eaJt was swell, and the music was divine to say the least. One thing is certain, next year I'll have one of those swanky mess jackets that so mauy of the boys ue wearing. The Betas put on a smooth dance, so did the Kaps, Alpha Delts and D U's. Six: of u.s piled into Bill's roadster and went out to the Gay Gull afterwards. It seemed as though the whole college was out there. Every- one was feeling happy, dreamy, ----· Th(}se few minutes out in the car were a tonic, b\lt they made :me yearn for more, more, more ------· There's nothing li~e all night dances t(} bring back !)rosperity, or happiness at least.

Tha.nk the Lord someone else made the break. Once again :f hit tbe hay at 7 A. M. What a life! Sunday, May 14 A£ter but a few short hours' sleep, a bunch of us piled into three cars and drove out toward Altamont for a picnic. What a ·.day, what a picnic, what a girl! Hiking through. the woods was fttn, but the best of all was when AI fell overb<>ard and then pulled Sam in with him. The e.xpressions on theit· faces drew a. laugh from all of us. · Since the· 5:35 was the last train of the day to home, Dot had to leave early, and that me~nt me to.o. Gee, the week-end went fast. A quick kiss, and then she hopped on the train and was off for a long time to come. Just think, it will be twenty-four .days before I see her ag.ain·. It took me just ten seconds. to realtze that the week-end cost me twenty-three dollus, and I haven't yet figured out where it all went. Lights out at 9 :30 P. M.

And in the event that such a case of mis- , labeling is found, the action is brought, not against the manu- facturer, but against the goods themselves. Witness such titles of eases as \U.

S. vs., 24 eases of salmon.\ The defend~ ant may, by paying a nominal fine ~the average being twenty-five ddlars), receive back the confis- cated goods, and by re-labeling or reprocessing, ship them out again, even though they still contain harmful ingredients. Needless to say, the amount of . faulty goods found is only a small percentage o:f the .total volume of faulty goods passing in interstate cammerce.

JUNIOR BOARD Associate Editors M . .A. Berger R. M. Diamond C. Groesbeck C. F. Hathaway D. B. Moulton J. Woolman WAS THE ATHLETIC BOARD JUSTIFIED? While the .Athletic Board was technically justified when it abelished varsity hockey Tues- day night, it does not seem that it took the wisest course to settle 14~ matter. The meeting might be called too secret. No member of the hockey team was there to present the skaters' side of the case. The committee appointed to investigate the advisability of maintaining a hockey schedule did not question the .members of the team. When the Boa;rd recently decided to abolish freshman sports, both .the Student Council and the Student Body were asked to sanction the move. It seems that the same steps might have been taken in the case of hockey. The members of· the committee of investiga- tion were indifferent about hockey to begin with, so it was natural ~bat they should take an indif- ferent stand about it. No way of c~nducting hockey at a reduced cost was discussed. It would seem that it would be possible to run the t;eam at a lower cost. In looking over the personnel of the hockey teams for the past few years, we find that it is a group that makes a :ptost favorable impression wherever .it plays. So do all. Union teams, but hockey is an inducement for students from cer- tain very desirable preparatory schools to come here, and for that reason should not be ahoUshed. It must be admitted that a large majority of varsity hockey games had to be cancelled because of lack of ice, but hockey was just beginning. to become popular here, and someday when adeq11:ate facilities could be installed, the game would rival basketball in popularity as it does, for e-xample, at Hamilton College. The whole question should be reconsidered.- A committee should be appoi:qted either by the Ath- letic Board or the Student Council to investigate the matter, then draw up a plan whereby hockey could be continued a.t a greatly reduced cost. A SUB-FRESHMAN WEEK-END NEXT YEAR The . list of names recently sent out l:lY the Secretary's office to fraternities, containing the names of all those who have made inquiries .about Union College to date, is a step in the right direc- tion. The one difficulty is that it came out too late. For a good many years there has l>een talk of setting aside a week-end for the sole purpose of entertaining pros]lective candidates for admis- sion. The value of such a. w.eek.-end is obvious; it wo'!ld serve to acquaint many desirable pros- pective students with the college.

Symphony, the intermezzo from which is on Sunday's program, is one of Widor's finest works. This third movement, less serious than the rest of the symphony, possesses .a l()vely, clear beauty, especially in its quieter middle sec- tion, the theme of which is presented in three voices as in a canon. Other numbers on the program are: \Marche Champetre,\ \Boex:; \Little Bells of I.,ourdes, \Gaul; \Humoreske Dvorak; and \Fansare Lemmens. A few fraternities have made some sort of effort to invite a fev sub-freshmen up .here, but very little success has resulted. In the first place, the fraternities are so afraid that some other house will see their freshmen, that they do not permit them to get around to see the college at all. One house even goes as far as to keep their guests from going to dam~es in the other houses for fear that the ho11Se giving the dance might know tba.t they are having freshmen here for the week-end. Such a -procedure is childish to say the least. Other colleges hav:e these. week-ends, and the fact that they h&ve them year after year proves their value. There is no reason why Union should not adopt some sort Of pl.tii and reap the bene- fits. We suggest It .now so the &.thletic schedules for neJCt spring can be made up to fit the needs Df an event of this ,sort. Only- whole-hearted coo]leratlon on the part of the fraternities. would insure the success of ·a. sub-freshman week-end, There could be no sec- ret understanding'!, and no pledging at that time. The St11dent Co~ncll w-ould have to see that these regtllations were e11forced. Any house which violated these rul~s,. and we r~gret to say that some probably would, should be punished by the Council, For one weelt;..epd fraternities should forget their own rushing, .a.nd devo~e ali their time and energy \to aiding the cpllege to secure a better freshman class. lJ?. th~ end; It would be to their adva.nta.ge.

E. V. CONNOR. To the Editor of The Concordiensis: In response to your request in recent issues of the Coneordiensis for comments on the Chapel pro-· grams, • I shall state. briefly my opinions and suggestions. I consider that most of the pro- gr~s recently have been very satisfactory. Most of the G. E. speakers really had something to say. The Friday programs are al-; way.s .good, and many times the devotional services are worth· while. However some programs are ab- solute failures. When a minister, comes and reads a selection from scripture an4 then reads 1'\- .prayer,' and says absoiutely nothing that· we don't already know, tt is just a waste of time. There have been numerous devotional serviees which I did consider worth while: those in which the speaker told sometning sipi:ftcant from his own ·experience. In any case when an assembly speaker is being chos- en, he should be asked \Do you have something that you would like to say to the students of · Union College?\~ not merely \Do . you wish to speak to the stu- ' dents?\ It might be better to hold as- ' setnbly less :frequentiy, perhap$ , three times· weekly, and have the·· Chapel period twice as long. This · wouid make it moJ\e worthwhile for students to attend. If the improvements which have been s-qggested within recent weeks by dift'er.ent persons are put in practice next year, I ·will con- · tinue to be in favor of the contin- uation· of compulse:r:y Chapel.

Woolman 1 · ·B~ING HOCKEY BACK The fact that such a large number of students think that the college should continue hockey is one that ·the Athletic Board cannot overlook. It must be admitted that the expression of so much sentiment favoring continuance of the sport is a trifle late; but then our students never seem to wake up until something that they don't like is passed. We do not know why the chairman of the committee which was appointed to consider the advisability of continuing hockey was absent from the last Athletic Board meeting, at which time the matter was voted upon; but it seems that he should have been present. Since he was not there, the matter should have been tabled until the next meeting. There is no doubt that too much money is spent on hockey, but has any effort been made to cut this expense? Members of the team, and others who have considered the problem seem to be of the unanimous opinion that the si;>ort can be conducted succesfully at a much lower cost. The varsity hockey team last year was the best that has ever represented Union College. Another good team is expected next year. The trip to Canada, taken during the Christmas re- cess, was made at the expense of the irtdividual members of the team. What other team would be willing to take the same steps in order that it might have a more successful season? . Varsity hockey should not be abolished. It should be continued under a reduced budget as all our other sports. Students should give the team all the support possible, because the day will come when the game will be the most popular winter sport at Union. THE BAND The hand is probably subjected to more de- structive criticism than any othel\ organization on the campus. Perhaps it deserves some of this unfavorable comment. There is absolutely no reason, however, why every member of the band should not wear the same outfit. It is possible to overlook a few flaws· in the music if all the members dress well, and alike. They all must have white trousers, and certainly each musician possesses a necktie. The band pas looked worse than it did last night, but it has never put up a real gc:wd ap- pearance, and there is no excuse for it. AND WE HAVE OVER TWENTY We congratulate the Kappa Alpha Fraternity on winning its second leg on the Frank Parket' Day cup. The competition, althottgh limited to a few was very keen. It is too bad that more fraternities do· not avail themselves to the opportunity offered by the Day cup competition. Last night only four sang, and we have twenty-two or so Greek Let- ter societies. Cooperation among the fraternities at Union Coltege is nearly always lacking in any proje:ct that demands working togdher to insure its suc- cess. The fact that only four houses entered the competition this year is just one mote· example· of a bad situation. ' Practically every house has se¥eral members of the Glee Club in it. A little initiative on theit· part would bring more fraternities int0 the com- petition. Perhaps next year mote houses wibl sing at the Spring: Night exeFcises. _In keeping with tihe Re11ding period. we are gomg: to tahulate a list of things that ~e never knew untH now but, as W.

Publications Office Starts Own. Library To Be tJ sed by Conc<>rdiensjs, Garnet, Idol Staffs The library for the Publications office has been started with the purchasing of forty-one books cov- ering all fields of journalism. More books will be added to the list later. Topics included in the new set of books are volumes on the art of writing, editing, feature story and magazine writing, headline writ- . ing and advedising. The .purchase of these books is in keeping with the plan of mak- ing the Union College Publications oice the most modern in every re- spect. Books for The Garnet are also included on the list. The editorial staff of The Con- cordiensis is now working on plans ·for next year, and the ·boolts are expected to be a great aid. Some of the changes contem:plated are . the enlarging of the· paper to a six column sheet, and an entirely dif- ferent style of topograp'hy. Many fraternities will undoubt- edly hold dances on Thursday and Friday nights, and teas ancl dances on Friday and Saturday after- noons. On Sunda.y at 11 A. M, in the Memorial Chapel, the J3aecalaure- ate .address will be delivered by Dean Edward Ellery. In the af- ternoon, Professor Tidma.rsh, as- sisted by several vocal clubs, will' give his organ recital in the Me- morial Chapel. The activities will be brought to a close on Monday. Tb.e Com- mencement procession will form at 9:30 A. M., and the exercises will begin at ten. The Honorary Chancellor's address will be de- livered by Walter Lippmann, L.L.D.

Woolman APPOINT ANOTHER COMMITTEE leave again on Monday, The Concordiensis asked Dr. Day to write \a message.\-'t'he editor. One Saturday afternoon, two or three years ago, as I was writing in my office a thuncliering knock came at my door. I called \Come in\ and a curious look:.ing person entered.· He was short and fat and ba.\d, about sixty-eight years old, with sunken ·chops ;LS if his false teeth had been badly fitted. His waist-coat suffered from a bad case of porridgea. · \What can I do fo·r you'', said I. \I want to be your profes·sor of PuMic Speaking\ said he. \Dr. Hale teaches whatever public speaking we have now\. \Dr. Hale\ said he, \that ·long drawn out gawky fellow, why he doesn't know the p·roper inoverhents.\ Here he gave a curious double shuffle with his feet and struck an att·itude as if he were goin·g to knock o.u.t Jack Dempsey. '\Well you know\ I said apologetically \We (I tnay have said us) professors are all odd\look- ing birds\. \There's no need to be\ said he \if you know the movements of grace and beauty. Look at me:\ Here he executed another .pas seul. \Speak me a piece\ said I. He stepped over to :the window, assumed a rl<retnrical or elecutionary attitude that was a kind of cross between Rodin's 'Thin.ker, The Dy- ing Gladiator and Lacoon in the grip of the python, and thundered forth: \Breathes there a man with soul so dead Who never to himself has said; This is my own, my native land, etc ... :\ I took his name and address and he departed.

For while Schenectady and Union College did not constitute my native land, yet as these dreary lines went thnmgh my mind, I realized that Union College had become my home. For it my soul was not d·ead, it was a; Union College that I longed to be. The better I became in body, the more home.-sick I became in mind. When my birthday came on May 9th and some telegrams came from Union CoHege, I gulped at the brea:kfast table, suddenly began to sniff and only covered IIl-Y confusion by blowing my nose violently. For while there are many elements of home scenery, atmosphere, climate, shelter, safety, the essence of home is that it is a place where your friends are. tain an essay by Abraham Schnip- . elsky, \Liberty-the Essence· of ':;;;;;;;;;;;;:;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;~;;;~ Romanticism,\ and an essay by· 1: ·The work of the committee appointed by the Athletic Board to investigate hockey was far from satisfactory. Another committee should be appointed, and report next fall. The present rink is not the place to have our hockey games. In addition to spoiling the ten- nis courts, it is seldom frozen. The games should be played at Mariaville Lake which is over a thousan.d feet higher than the campus. There is ice there most of the winter, and it is on this lake that the team does most of its practicing. While it is agreed that almost any one will sign their name to a petition, the fact that over two hundred names appear on the list must not be overlooked. It is expected that a great many more signatures wiii be obtained before the end of the college year. PROFESSOR CLARK and MR. ACHIL- LI ES have both offered to donate their services as coaches of the hockey team, thereby eliminat- ing one of the heaviest expenses. Both of these men . have had: considerable experience, and should be able to produce an excellent team. TOO INDEFINITE It seems that the past two weeks were sup- posed to have been devoted to review, study or almost anything. Very few students, however, seem. to feel that the period has been a success. · In the first place, some instructors have used the time to ass1gn work that should have been dpne earlier in the term. When these assign- ments are added to all the work required to re- :view a year course, the result is that the student does none of his job well. The difficulty seems to be that nobody knows , ., \ . .j,us.f what is supposed to be done during this periqd. Some members of the faculty have frankly admitted that they don;t know just what is the best thing to do. · ,. · · What we shou1d have is a full two week t>e- rl?d 'during which time no advance work shoulcl. . be a~signed. It is impossible to review five year c~urses, read several extra books and do ad- vance work all in two weeks. A definite plan should be drawn up for this time next year. j~EEPING THRU THE KEYHOLEj FOR KNOWLEDGE OR SILLY OLD MARKS- . Good evening gentlemen. How many of you and you have not been districted from the true purpose of your studying? You all know the true collegiate labor. \We study that we mav know\. What a pertinent riddle. D ______ thi's temporary lull that intervenes between the end of regular class session and the finals. The pe- riod during which a small portion of the student body labors for information, while the vast ma- jority pursue \Professor's Courses, simply for marks. It is a fact~most of us study in order to pass a quiz-in order to obtain a mark. ADO:LF RENDERS A LITTLE DITTY- Perhaps some of my gentle readers will re• call the little P'aragraph which appeared in one of my columns last March. It co.ncerned a prominent fast ball player from Union who of- fered to aid a lovely young thing, after he heard her frantic cries from a darkened fraternity house while . he was out for his evening walk, about (12:15). How she chased him off the grounds! How she used. horrible language right in his presence! Well, that same genial gentle- man has fallen within my bounds again. This This was intended to be a brief word of greeting to Union College men; unless I stop generalizing and sentimentalizing it may grow into an a·rticle. Greetings, good wishes and good luck to you all. When people have asked me why I wrote a book on fishing, I have always replied \1 don't think I'm a great fisherma.n but no one likes fishing better; so now I say to you I may not he a great president, but no president likes his faculty and undergraduates more. I am .particularly sorry to have been away in the second semester, for in that semester i11 the last four years I have tried to become well ac- quainted with the seniors. I have lost that op- portunity and there are many boys in the class of 1933 whom I will not know well. That is mv mis-fo.rt.une, a misfortune unavoidable. Let m~ congratulate you upon all your ac;coinplishments of the year. I am getting better, but I am not going to stay for Commencement. I am still too lame to hobble up the chapel steps in the academic pro- cession. But I am getting well and in Septem- ber I expect to be in perfect health to greet you when you return. time said brute played the role of road tiouse en~ tertainer he£ore a huge gathering.
