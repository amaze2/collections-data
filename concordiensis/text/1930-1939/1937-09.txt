Retartyk PRO AND CON Although many members of the class of 1941 have proved themselves worthy oppo- nents of rushing committeemen, the question of joining a fratel\llity or not still remains unanswered. The advantages of becoming a member of a Greek letter society-especially at Union College-are many. Yet there are di~dvan­ tages. There is no easy way of determining which is more convincing than the other.

It i~: tli~ ·iiuri>6se: here to present in very brief outline the arguments for and against the joining of fraternities. Outside of the financial obj.ections and the over-sentimental fratel\llal exhortations, there are a few other important things to be said for both sides. That fraternity life develops personality may or may not be true; that it prom<>tes mutual understanding is another moot ques- tion; and that it broadens outside interests and encourages scholarship seems contradic- tory. But that it furnishes a college home where usually a discipline is maintained and in- duces cooperative living is obviously tTue. For the making of contacts, in and out of college, fraternity provides many fine <JI>:P()l'· tunities. It also increases social poise and ove1·comes provincialism. The non-fraternity argument mai11tains that living with one group of men intimately THE CONCORDIENSIS, TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 21, 1937 ecuted\ or \the supp?rt and taste ]I of the public are llt~'rellable, and the for four years curbs individuality.

The net result, in other words, is a bit hard on the ears, but definitely easy on the eyes. In general, criticism has limited itself to self-conscious mumblings about the exaggerated opulence of the Hollywoodesque lamasery, and about the unsuccess- ful rehashing .of Hilton's philoso- phical fantasy. It is true that the Shangri-La set is reminiscent of D. W. Griffith's pictures, but since, once seen, it doesn't intrude upon the action of the story, its expensive expansiveness can be tolerated. On the other hand, it seems to this writer that H. B. Wlarner and Sam Jaffe handle long- winded speeches so very deftly that the author's metaphysical didoes scarcely annoy the audience.

GltA~TED LEAVE ~F ABSENCE \For the student of 1937 doubt is necessary and inevita.ble; but so is action if civilization is to en· dure,\ said Dr. Harold A. Larra- bee during the fir'st daily assem- bly program for the year thjs morning. :Beauvais Fox, one-time city editor of the New York Sun and drama editor of the Herald Trib- une, was director of public rela- tions with. Milton JY.L Enzer, assist- ant to President Fox for' public announcements, as associate di- rector, editor·in-chief of the weekly \.!Mohawk D1·arna Festival Maga- zine\ and registrar of the Institute of' the Theatre. The speaker drew a correlatie>n between Davy Crockett's philoso- phy and the modern outlook. He pointed out that the Kentucky bear-hunter's slogan was: Be sure you'1·e right, then go ahead.\ . • . \In our day, however,\ he said, \the advice to 'Be sure you'xe : right, then go ahead' takes -us i squarely into one <Jf the chief dilemnas of modern thougbt, which may be expressed in two queries: How can we possibly any longer be sure that we are r-ight? And if we cannot be sure, how can we go vigorously ahead?\ The allied Institute of the Thea- tre, with a student body of more than 55, was Wlder the chairman- 'Doubt Yom·seH' \In the words words of the late Justice Holmes: 'To have doubt~d one's own first principles is t:he mark of a civilized man .. ' That same great American jurist said in later life that he could wrjte everything tha.t he knew on half · a sheet of note-paper; but that·' he would want to have the other · hald in order to write on it. 'I. am not sure' about what he had ' written on the first half. Thomas A.

Part of tl:ac i.ncrease in efficiency that has come ahou t in 'the pomver-generating field in the last ff\w years bas been due to increased steam temperature<! and pressures.

It has been largely due to this research carried on by ~neral Electric that the temperature and pressure of steam used in power generation have been raised to unexpected highs lo the last few years. ICE WATER N EW electric drinking-water coolers in- troduced by General Electrie have re· :placed the anti qua ted ice•coolcd type on several prominent Midwestern railroads. This is an· other step in the modernization program being carried on by railroads to increase passenger traffic. The new coolers are desigucd to overcome many disadvantages of tb.e ice-cooled units. With foot operation of the self-contamed units, only one hand need be used to get a drink. Cleanliness is promoted because of the absence of icc-filling operations, and tb.e expense for maintenance and service is reduced to a mini- mum. The water is automatically maintained at a b.ealthful and refreshing temperature through ~crrnostatic control. Coolers are designed .exther as self-contained units or as sepArate cooling and ref~igerant condensing unita for remote installations in Ine car. (!ENERALfl ELECTRiC '' . I.

Day '38, president of the Student Council, offered a set of plans for the transformation of the Student Council into a func- tional representative 'body today in daily assembly. Under the pro- posed functional set-up, membe1 s, of the council would be represen- tatives of the various college organizations 1 ather than of the classes as is the case under the JJI\esent system. Three Recommendations President Day also mad.e two other drastic recommendations for the continued governance of the student body. He suggested that some sort of !rash-sophomore g-ame should be devised to take the place of the recently discarded scraps. He also recommended that an interfraternity council be estab- lished. Under the present system, the Student Council Is composed of various membet·s .from each class. The senior class is allotted seven members, the junior clas.'l five, and the sophomore four. The only other member is the chairman of the Student Tax Committee. These men are chosen at annual elections by tbe student body. Two Bodies If Day's recommendations are accepted In full, there will be two bodies, an assembly and a senate, which will govern student affairs jointly. The assembly -will necessarily .be larger than the senate. The neu- tral group and fraternity units· will all be given a share in the representation. Every forty mem- bers of the fraternity group will -be given one representative as will the neutrals. The assembly will also have a representative from every tax supported organizati<m in the college. This body will elect its own separate body of officers. The senate will •be a smaller ·body than the assembly under the present plan. The president and vice-president of each class will be given membership. The secretary of the assembly will also be a member, as will the chairman of the Student Ta:x Committee.

Union Graduate Says War Futile Chinese-Japanese C o n f l ·i c t Cited by Walser '10 As Good Example Thursday, September 23~\Close your ears to the subtle, sinister voices, f10m hell itself, which are urging the democratic countries, with the support of Russia, to war against the Fascist countries,\ urged Theodore B. Walser, '1(), in speaking to the students and fac- ulty of Union College in daily as- sembly today. War today Is a \slaughter of innocents and no one can win,\ he added.

First Impressions of Union College Satisfactory to Puerto Rican Frosh Feliciano J. Gonzales of San Juan, Puerto Rico is a full fledged member of the Class of 1941. Feli· ciano is the third student In the pa.st two years to come to Union from our Pan-American neighbors. Last year Cuba. and Columbia were represented in the student body. Feline, as he is called, has made only Qne other visit to the United States prior to his coming to Union, and that was a short visit to New York City. When asked why he chose Union as the college for which to continue his studies, he answered that he had looked over other colleges but he liked the way of living here, the teaching, and the organization of Union College better than any other coilege that he had considered. Previous to his college days, Feli- ciano studied in the San Juan High School. English, contrary to popu- lar belief, is not difficult for him. Besides speaking Spanish, which is the native language of Puerto Rico, English conversational classes are held in which the students gain a good knowledge of English diction. Gonzales is taking a pre-medical course but at present has no idea as to where he will take his grad- uate worlL Classes, he says, are run very much the same in Puerto Rico as they are here at Union, and consequently he bas no difficulty In that field, The one spot on the campus that Gonzales took an immediate liking to was Jackson's Gardens. \The . beautiful flowers and above all the fragrance make Jackson's Gardens outstanding in m:y memory,;' said Gonzales. The unusual architecture of Washburn Hall impressed him very much as well as the simple beauty of the Memorial Chapel, The most interesting thing that Gonzales has found is Daily Chapel. and he has declared his intention of attending every day. The most unusual thing to our minds about Gonzales is the fact that he has never seen a football game. Football is not played in Puerto Rico, and thus he is looking forward to the Hobart game with more anxiety than any other stu- dent. Dutchmen Trek to Waterville, Me. for First 0f 1937 Tussles; Mules Expected to :Be Stubborn Foes for Garnet to C()nq11er With prospects ~ bit brighter than they were last week, the varsity fo@tball eleven moved up into N orthexn tetTitory Thursday to engag-e the ;\Jules of Colby at Watervme, l\Iaine, in the seasonal up en et· for both tean:1s on Saturday.

Frosh Y earb~ok Nearly Completed To Contain Short :Bi()g-raphies And Individual ?'ictures Of Entering Class Wednesday, Sept. 2:2-The Fx esh- man Record, newly inst.ituted year- book of the entering class, will pl'Obably appear the last week in October, it was announced today by Edmond Arundel '38, editor-in- chief. Although the staff Is completing the work as rapidly as possible the final arrangements can not be com- pleted before Septem.ber 27 as freshmen may registe:r any time before that date. Pictut·es of the class of '41 and their faculty asso- ciates have already been taken and the descriptions and 'VIriteups of the different activities in which freshmen may particip.ate are now in their final stages, The purpose of the !>Ul>lication is to assist the freshmen in be- coming acquain.ted wit!:l each other and with the college. Copies will be distributed only to rne:rnoet'S of the freshmen class. The book will contain a picture of each entering student, a record of his school activclties, his nick- name, his college a11c.ct home ad- dresses. Also included will be pic- tures of the fresbm..en advisors, college officers, freshmen camp leaders, freshmen ath1etic coaches, freshmen teams, and familiar cam- pus faces. The book W\ill begin with Dr. Fox's message of welcome to the new class. The staff worlting on the book consists of Edmund R. Arundel, editor-in-chief, and Wililam O'Con- nor, Robert Walter, ..Jr., and Alan Wrana, associate editors. Record Grou),) ()f Frosh Report for College Band With over twenty-:five freshmen reporting for tbe first rehearsal, 'Professor Charles '1'. Male, director of the ·band, is looki:ng forward to one of the most successful seasons in many years. Many experienced players from last y~ar are again available and are already prac- ticing, New uniforms hav-e been ordered to replace damaged ..:>lder ones and for the additional members and will be delivered in. time for use in the Hobart gaDte. Professor ·Male expects to sta.rt drilling the men in their marC'J:i!ng and field formations next week. Approxi- mately forty men a.re expected to play this year. Student officers a.re Roger Bur- gess '38, student leader, and Will- ard Male '38, student manager. The Union squad left yesterday evening on the four-day, 400-mile trip, and w.ill practice thi~ after- noon at Bowdoin in a last light workout before the fray. Having scrimmaged Tuesday against the freshmen, and having had but two very light sessions since, the team should be ready to go with the sluggishness of last week's practices completely wiped out. The Dutch- men ran thr·ough the yearlings with apparent ease on Tuesday, with Brockmeyer', Hammerstrom and Thoma.s doing most of the ball- lugging. Van Vadd looked like the best bet to do the place-kicking, for his tries met with success, whereas Sammy had trouble in lo- cating t:he crossbars. Adams ap- peared to fit well at his center post, and Amazon did a nice job at quar- ter, apparently finding a scoring play after a year of search, for a double lateral worked to perfec- tion after a couple of bucks into the line failed to gain yardage at the f.roslt goal line. Lineup Uncha.nged The lineup will be practically the same to·morrow a.s it was in scrim- mage. Stubby Adams will be the pivot man, with Bill Lynn on one side and Jim Mulcare on the other. Van Ladd and Kluge, a sopho- more, will perform at tackle, while Ray Lewis and Bill Busino will flank the line. Jake Amazon will handle the judgment end, Billy Thomas and Larry Brockmeyer will fill halfback roles, and Sam Hammerstrom will round out the backfield at full. Colby football this year is greatly changed. Alfred McCoy, the new mentor from Northeastern, has been experimenting with all of his players, and apparently has found a suitable combination. Maurice Rancourt, a 175-pound back, is hi!3 only veteran in the backfield, so he bas inserted Dick White, a cen- ter, into the quartet which includes Robert Bt·uce, a sophomore, and Joe Dobbins. The line is completely renovated from the last year's for- ward vvall which helped to win one game out of eight. McCoy has backs in tackle positions, guards at end, and ends at center, in the attempt to find the best working outfit. New Deal a.t Colby The VV:aterville boys this year are sporting new royal blue jer- seys and silver helmets and pants. In addition, they have erected new goal :posts, have grown grass on the formerly barren field, and all in all, are primed to begin a suc- ?essful seaso?. Football at Colby ts much as 1t was at Union last year. With a new coach and the possibility of having a good season, the vvhole college is pepped up, (Continued on Page 3) ' .~ Probable Union Starting Lineup For Colby Game Tomorrow AmJtz()n Quarterbaclt Thoma.s Left Halfback Rroclmleyer Right Ha.lfbaclt Ha.:mni.elstront Full Back Busino Right End Ladd Right Tackle Mulcare Right Guard Adams Center Lynn Left Guard Kluge Left Tackle Lewis Left End·

Among ~ther things we've no- ticed the apparant lack of scraps, hair cuts, trouser taking, and that sort of thing between the sophs and the rl'Osh. Time was when the Monday f o ll o w i n g registration would see many a heckled frosh posting notes on the bulletin board inquiring about his late lamented trousers with black belt. However, the other day, the mention of the frosh did bring about the horse clucking so prominent at Student Body Meetings last year. And now we see that a Discipline Commit- tee has been appointed. Which makes us wonder just which frosh will be made to write 1()0 times or more \I didn't mean it\ to an infringement of the much abbre- viated rules, and also to wonder what the Ghost of Cohen would say to thi.s new rebellious ram- bunctious feeling of rivalry.' FUNCTIONAL !REPRESENTATION Phlegmatic student government has been characteristic of the Union College guiding body ever since the formation of the Student Council in 1933. Prio1· to that time the Ter- race Council was the undergraduate legisla- tive g-roup. The transformation of that coun- cil into the honorary society of the campus was due to the fine public appearance of Union's athletes. For about one year, immediately after the org·anization of the new council, there was interest, efficiency, initiative and all the other deserving signs of intelligent adminis- tration. Some excell€nt after-effects came from that first council, for example, the organization of the Student Tax Committee in 1934 by William A. Waldron. Early ill the fall of 1935 George .Stroebel, then a senior, began another fight for the reorganization of the Student Council into a more representative body. After months of dickering by the committee which. \studied\ the problem, the alternative was presented. to the students of enlarging the number of nominations to the council under the old sys- tem of elections or of a complete change which would permit popular nomination and election. The indifference of the council to the suggested reformation and its prejudiced attitude was typical of its handling of stu- dent affairs. Needless to say, after a deaden- ing period of incubation in cmnmittee, the original proposal was discarded b-y the stu- dents and the council's own \reform\ was substituted. Last year, inspired by a lesson learned at the National Student Federation of America· conferences, the· Union College Student Council sincerely considered the reorganiza- tion of itself into a body more rep~esentative of the college activities. Earnest and sincere as were the intentions of P1·esident Robert and sincerely appreciated for it.

The exchange with St. Andrews has func- tioned with cmrunendable results, and we hope has become firmly established in both institutions. Further exchanges with other universities may be contemplated and it seems entirely worthwhile from the success o-f our first at- tempt to further academic !'elations of the same kind.

Contributions from any member of the college who feels he has a \hot tip\ or a worthy column which should be printed or a criticism to make, will gladly be read- and perhaps used.

Nearly twenty men have reported at the pool to Mr. Wheat- ley, who :pla.ns to hold daily prac- tices fr<Jn. now on. .of the college wh<J are unable to participate in the more strenuous contests. The bowling league, which last year was unofficial, would be cer- tain to gain widespread approval, and would also cater to those whose, idea of athletics runs along milder forms. · :,\ 'i.i ; ,::; .. . . Ed Roundy, who has coached Colby football teams for the past 13 years, is now assistant to McCoy, and is giving his cull co-operation. This certainly is an example ot good sportsmanship, for the case generally happens that a replaced coach goes away with a few not so tender feelings toward his sue- cess or. Colby's backfield, while not ex- perienced, nevertheless carries a lot of weight. All <>f the backs range in the vicinity of 180 pounds, which is considerably heavier than the Garnet troupe. However, the lines will average about the sarne, both teams having but one man in the forward wall who tips the beam at 200 pounds. For Colby, the man is Hersey, a tackle, while Adams is Union's conrtibution to the heavyweight ranks. * • * There is a lot of talk about the scouts who have been appearing at scrimmage lately.

Forty-five students, including twenty fresh- men, were present to heax· reports of last year's activities, appoint- ments to committees and plans for the forthcoming year. Vaudeville: Like most amateurs, the members of \Major Bowes' In· ternational Revue\ at•e talented but lack t11.at vital spat·k of show· manship which is essential for awaken.ing audience interest. Ail, that is, but one: Danny Drayson, the tap dancer, adds a few dew twists to a. familiar routine, man· ages what looks like a genuine smile, and corners most of the ap· pla use. 'Th 'l rest of the show is pretty well bed-Iidden. Robert Smith, who addressed the Union student body last spring, wil'l talte a leading part in the con- ference. Mr. Smith has just return- ed from Europe where he hiLS been studying cooperative movements Rnd is expected to report on the status of the movement a:l>road. Thursday, September 23.-8che- nectady stock company, to have headquarters in the old Erie Thea- tre, is now in the process of or· ganization and will open its season on October 11 with the recent Broadway comedy success, ''Boy Meets Girl,\ it was announced to- night by Frederick Calvin, business manager of the Mohawk Dran1a Festival, and one of the promoters of the· new enterprise. • • • ·= I BOOK STORE i • • • • • • • • William Swanson, president of the club, explained the club's method of operation to the fresh- men and announced that there would be a hilting trip to Plotter- kill leaving from the Old Chapel at 2:00 o'clock Saturday afternoon. It is hoped that many of the fresh- men will participate in this first trip as it will pave the way for more interesting outings to come. Reports indicate that Varsity Show, now at the State, is no world-beater; nevertheless, what with Ted :Healy, the Lane Sisters, and Fred Waring & Company, It can's be b-ad. lncide:tllally, if you see the Uni- versal newsreel of the Chinese war ad vet tised at a 8econd-run theatre, be sure to drop in to see it. Violent is the word. Bergstl·om Reporis Jeck Bergstrom, secretary of the Intercollegiate Outing Clubs of America, reporting for the recently completed College Week held in the Marcy region, said that twenty-nine colleges . were representett by the one hundred-sixteen students who attended at one time or another. This is the third year that Union has had charge of directing Coll<>ge Week. , Fred Wyatt informed the gather- ing that plans were almost com- pleted for the renting of the cabin at Noeth Creek and that there is a po:lsibility that the Outing Club will purchase land on which to build its own cabin. The sketchy condition of the abovs has led you, no doubt, to suspect that we have something up the columnar sleeve. True. One of the grapes from the well-known vine informs us that the Mounte- banks are considering acquiring a portable ••talkie\ projector for the purpose of bringing foreign films to Union. Obviously, this means that La Kern\Acsse Heroique, Man o:f Aran, ~[, and other European favmites which have never ap- peared lo.cally, could be seen on campus for the Uf!Ual sUlll. Not only are we highly In favot of this p1an, but we suggest tbat those of like mind signify their In- terest through the <Jonemdi tnail- slot.-J .Jv'l. ----0<·--- Gylll. Being Repaired The Club voted to join the Sche· nectady Wintersports Club and the Gore Mt. Ski Club, and it was re- quested that all who ate interested in skiing get in touch with Fred Wyatt as there is much work to be done on the Rotterdam trails. The newly appointed committees are as follows: Executive committee, Howa·rd Sanderson and Warren Gammons; outing committee, Elliot Dodge Jr. and Howard Sandet·son; wintersports committee, Jack Berg- strom, Warren Gammons, Rollin Wt ight and Richard Angle; faculty committee, Peter Owens and Rollin Wright. Profess<Jt' J. Harold Wittner has announce-d that the gymnasium floor \Vill not be open for use until the varnishing of the float· and the renair·ing of the skylight has been completed.

The capital for the project is being furnished by loc~l business men, who prefer to remam anonymous. Although It has been nearly ten years since Schenectady has had its own legitimate theatre, the sponsors are confident the city which has always been accorded \a good show town,\ will support the venture, and point for proof to the phenomenal response to the Mo- hawk Drama Festival. The Empire Players plan to do the best obtainable plays from the last of recent Broadway hits with emphasis on the fast modern com- edies. There will be a weekly change of bill each Monday, and eight performances a week, includ- ing matinees Wednesday and Sat- urday. The plays will be staged and di- rected by Mr. Addison Pitt, direc- tor of many New York successes, who is now in that city assembling his company. ----o---- Opportunity Knocks All students interested in work- ing with the editorial and business staffs of The Concordiensis are in- vited to attend the organization meeting of the underclass staffs this afternoon at 5 o'clock in the Publications Office, Silliman Hall. . ,,·· -·-. -~-··: • • • • i and SCHOOL NEE'DS 5 • • • • • • • • : FOR AU COURSES : • • • • 5 COMPLETE LINE OF BOOKS 5 • • 5 DESK LAMPS 5 m • • • : LAUNDRY BAGS : • • • • : FELT GOODS and STATIONERY : • • • • • • • • • • : Regular Hours Hours 1st 6 Weeks : • • • • • • = 8:45- 12:00 8:45- 12:30 = • • • • • • 5 I : 15 - 5:00 I :00 - 5:00 5 • • • • • • 5 Room 5-Administration Buildin9 5 • • • • = . ~············································~-~ ••. only Chesterfields give smokers that refreshing mildnes~ and delightful aroma -that taste that smokers like . . . . .. it's because Chesterfield links together -blends and cross-blends-the finest aro- matic tobaccos from Tur.key and Greece and the best mild ripe ciga.rette tobacc()s from oqr own Sunny Soutb.- Enjoy Chesterfields' • • THEY SATISFY < \ l l :t ! \ '' l Idol Staff Appointrru Announc• ===- Vol. LXI., N< Record : Added a: Plans N Tidma·l'sh se· 1937-38 St'!

That doesn't speak much for Lhe country. But there is considerable hope for a vigor- ous scholarship here in the attitude of the present administration. The freshman classes of the past two years have typified this attitude. The number of upperclassmen \\ ho were dropped ft·om the college curricula for scholastic reasons this year was thL greatest in recent years. There are many signs of tig-htening up the courses o-f .study at Union-all favo1·able signs for better scholarship. Not only does this principle apply to the student, howevet·. Pt·esident Fox in his ad- dress at the faculty dinner this year-and also last year at similar occasions-stressed the need for continuing scholarship among members of the f~ulty. The assumption that the title of assist- ant or associate professor is the ultimate in scholarship if not in academic rank is just as silly as the belief of a college g-raduate who says, \now my school days are over and I won't have te read another book.\ Scholal'ship never ends. habit. Last year the Glee Club, under the direction of Dr. Tidmarsh, gave a concert on the campus and we hope that this popular event will become a yearly affair. As bas been announced, the Glee Club will spon- sor a conce1 t on October 8 by Mar- cel Dupl·e, organ virtuoso and itnprovisor. Mt's. Earl E. Rice of Schenec- tady is sponsoring a lecture-recital series on opera to be presented by Rudolph Thomas, conductor for many years in Europe and in this country. The series will include twenty-one evening talks on fifteen popular operas, seven of w.hlch will be held in the Old Chapel. The others will be given In Albany and Troy. The first Schenectady lecture will be on October 20. The Schenectady Civic Music As- sociation has announced that they will' adopt a more ambitious pro- gram this year, the details of which will be announced at a later date. Schenectady has a small but en- terprising symphony ochestra which will' give three concerts during the year. Albany and Skidmore College also have symphonies. Dr. Tidmarsh conducts two vocal gl'oups ,in the city, the Thursday Musical Club for women and the Shubert Club for men. These or- ganizations have concerts in the Memorial Chapel and bring many outstanding artists to the college. , Last year the outstanding event on the campus was the complimen- tary concert by Friedrich Schorr, premier baritone of -the Metropoli- tan Opera Company. We hope that other similar all-college concerts will be 11rranged for this year.

With th members of both teams practically exhausted .from the heat, the garne became a survival of the fittest after the firs quarter when Colby capitalized o:n a blocked punt and score the only touchdown. Earlier Ladd had booted a 13-yard: field goal for Union. : fo1 tunes that the chan.ge was a good one. Colby was somewhere up in the woods of Maine, where cold weat-her ha~ a reputation for coming eally and staying Ia te. If the ·opener· were to ·':Je in Schenec- tady, t'he usual heat of late Sep- tember-though fin·e for the ~pec­ tatovs-might prove slightly op~ pressi ve to the combatants. The schedul<:> ·makers had remedied all that. As for the weather the only worry- was the possible threat of Both teams were p1•actically of~---------------­ eq.ual strength, but Colby had the advantage in numbers, and was able to reinforce her squad from time to time, while the Garnet had to use practically the same team throughout the game. It was this numerical superiority which gave the Maine team the decided edge, for the sun took an enormous toll and left those who had played the entire game, weak and unable to stand. Union was able to put across the first score, when, after two unsuc- cessful tries at running plays from the Colby 13-yard line, Acting- captain Van Ladd stepped back and place-kicked a perfect field goal. The lead was shOl't-l!ved, however, for Colby, taking advantage of one of the many blocked Union kicks, completed a 25 yard forward pass, from MacGregor to Burriil, and gave the Mules the margin of vic- tory. After this short flurry of scor- ing, the game became a see-saw affair, and neither team was re~lly able to make any definite bid to- wards a score .. Ray Lewis, who played a stellar game for the Dutchmen, provided the most ex- citing play for Union, when he took a pass and headed goalward, only. to be stopped by the last Colby . back. The visitors were unable to go further, however, and were· forced to hand the ball ·over on downs. Colby made two threats late· in the game, but did not possess the stamina to push ().Ver another score, :and the game ended with both teams practically on the verge of collapse. * * Billy Thomas, suffering from a heavy cold, was seriously affected by the heat, and was able to play but half the game. Tyler Dennett played in his place and did most of the ground gaining, -as Hammer- strom could not hit his stride. .. * • Stubby Adams was another vic- tims of the heat and had to be re- moved in the third quarter, after putting up a fine exhibition of play- ing on his nerve. In fact, practically the whole team was slowed up by the 85 degree temperature. Ray Lewis, who gave a brilliant .per- formance, had to be left in Bruns- wick over night, to return home via train with Jim Mulcari! on Sunday. * * • Lal'l'y Brockmeyer and Ty Den- nett were the most consistent ground gai:ners for 1Jnion, whils Rancourt and McGee stood out for Colby. Besides. these two backs, the Mules' most outstanding player was Wjarren Pearl, giant tackle, who was in on almost every play. This versatile athlete was one of. the Gamet's biggest obstacles. • • * Fumbling was extremely evident by both teams. In one instance, eolby receovered the errant ball and ran 30 yards for ·a touchdown which was recalled. Colby was penalized 80 to Union's 40 yards. This. clearly shows the nature of the fracas. Bu.lwark On Line Freshman Eleven Developing Fast Coach Lawrence Grows Op- timistic as Green Squad Re- sponds to Daily D1·illing Coach Art Lawrence may n()t produce another' undefeated, freshman football eleven as he did· last year, but the way the team is shaping up now, all indications point to a smart, fast working ·ball club. The team is still green, as only four men renorted with very much previous experience, out sev- eral of the new men are de'Velo.ping fast. This year's frosh eleven will probably be built aroun4 the run- ning and passing of Jack Vannier. Vannier, who resides in Hudson· Falls, has shown up as the best ball carrier to date, but Billy Wardwell, his understudy, can also show a pair of elusive heels. Dia- mond Marotta will do the squad's punting with Gordon Semerad; late !Jf Mont Pleasant High School, the blocking back. Dick Balch will do the quarterbaclt:ing.

For the the varsity football men, notably Ray Lewis', Stubby Adams and Jim Mulcare, any- t:ales of the frigid Maine eli~ mate will be m.et with sneers of derision. For Nels Nitchman, starting his sec()nd year as head coach, it must ha.ve ·been discouraging to lose thr()ugh the identical medium which led to last year's opening day defeat by Middlebury - a blocked kick. The scoring play came when Bu~Till scutted over the goal line and MacGregor threw him a pass. Ho-wever, it was the partially blo<!ked kick which gave the ball to Colby deep in what Bill Munday, the veteran southern announcer, used to call \the land of milk an' honey.\ If flaws were to be picked in the Garnet armament the punting-or lack of it-was what hurt.

Y. are new rivals. Vermont, R. P. I. and Middlebury continue lo renew their rivalry with the Dutchmen . Two of the candidates are ineligi- ble for the Hl37 edition of the Union han·ims. Captain Bill Hawkes, three-year veteran, is the only sen- .or squad member. Howard Sheffer, Franltie Myers, Ed Wells and Joe Annese represent the class of '39, ~ncl Bill Johnson, Paul Santoro, 1•'.rank Melewicz. Gale Hoffrr.an and John Fi;;her are the sophomores .tying out fot the hill-and-dale ;quad. Fisher and Annese are the t;,o ineligible candidates. Ray Denton and Harry Myez·s, team members last year, are not re- turning as expected. Denton is in- 'ligible, and Myers is working. Hawkes distinguished himself last year by cutting 21 seconds off the standing ·record for the 4.7 mile course, and Paul Santoro made his reputation by shading the frosh record. Ed Wells retm·ned late for prac- tice this year. He worked at his summer job for a time after the ~allege opening. Wells, Santoro and Johnson are the only squad mem- bers known to have steady work during the vacation months. John- son was the only man to get in any pre-season work-outs, and is show- ing up the better for it. Ketz has devoted his efforts to getting the men in condition and will hold the first time trials tomor- row afternoon. The season gets un- derway with an away set-to with Vermont University on October 9.
