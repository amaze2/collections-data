Although many ugly rumors have been circulating to the effect that the decision to drop foot.IJall had been made prior to the meeting last month, when it was announced that increased interest and squad participation were neces- sary for continuance of the gridiron .sport.

The Presi- dent explained that the papers were given the news before- hand to prevent garbled reports and incorrect accounts, especially as word had somehow leaked out Monday night, after the meeting, despite all efforts to keep the matter secret until Wednesday morning. However someone made an error and the story was released to() soon. A large number of students were greatly incensed be- cause coaches Rein and Ciampa received their first news of the abandonment of their pet .sport while on the prac- tice field Tuesday afternoon, througll the medium of the erring newspaper. This occurrence would have been avoided had the news release been held until after the announcement in assembly by Dr. Fox. The whole situation showed poor management, both in regard to releasing of the story and informing the coaches.

Here is an orga:1i;mtiun which is often tal,en for grnnted, but which adds more to college life than is realized by many, particu- iarly to the dignity and beauty of the Sunday chapel services. Strange as it may seem to the layman, sing- ing is work-hard work-for an or- ganization such as this which strives for perfection in · interpret- ing music to us, however difficult that music may be. This year the choir has had add- ed to its other difficulties the fact that Dr . Tidmarsh has been sick and will be so for several weeks more. Only those who know and appreciate the fine and truly in- spiring leadership of Dr. Tidmarsh and the mutual devotion between him and the members of his musi- cal groups can realize what a blow this was to the choirmen . But the men in the choir still are carrying on-as Doctor Tidrnarsh would want them to. Herb Houghton came forward in the choir's hour of need and is now lending his efforts to the maintenance of the choral groups as going organiza- tion. Miss Helen Henshaw, too, has t-een a great help at the organ . Bill Lasser , glee club manager, revealed yesterday the fact that glee club trips wm start in two months . He also reptated the omnipresent statement of a glee dub manager \Come around to z · e- hearsals.\ (Thursday and Friday) 1645-1730. Lasser also wishes to re- mind those laggards who have been missing rehearsals of the good times enjoyed by all on the trips. Gray's Band Popular Those who attended last year's Freshman - Sophomore dance, and those who live in the capital dis- trict, know the caliber of Fr!ldd;e Gray's band. The music will be good, the committee under Ver- saci and LaPann is working huz d, and prospects arC' bright. All that is needed is complete supp0rt in the form of attendance to make this dance an outstanding success. Therefore, students are advised to get dates, buy tickets, and .:;how up at the Gym at 8 : 30 p.m. on Satm·- day the 18th. The committee has also extend- ed an invitation to the V -5 stu- dents. All flyers who wish to at- tend should get their tickets a: th0 college bookstore.

Ever since reduced costs and t·edueed manpower made it necessary to decrease the size of the paper, we have felt that return to the former size as soon as possi·ble was high!~· desiraible. B~· dint of proddigious effoet, the Business l\lanag·er has been able to get a recmd amount of local advertising. However, due to lack of national ads, resumption of the fo1·mer six column pape1· was out of the ques- tion. When an appeal was made to Student Tax Committee to grant more money to the Con- cordiensis, to approximate more closely the budgets of former years, the reply was made that their funds were already over allotted. Prospects \\'ere dim for the large size paper, although news items occasionally had to be omitted from the F>mall papet· due to lack of space. A guarantee by President Fox, that the College would make up an,\· deficit fo1' the year, up to a certain amount, caused by the inct·ease in size and printing costs, changed the outlo0k, and made possible the present form of the paper. We wish to thank Dr. Fox for this gen- ei'OUS offer. \\'ith good luck and hard work we may be able to J~·et along without using a great part of it. It is very comforting, however, to kno•w that the college stands back of the papet· in case of financial dif- ficulty. TilE LAST DYING GASP The announcement that the projected in- tra-squad football progTam has been aban- doned comes as no sut·prise to those of us who attended the first and on!~· of these games between two parts of the football team. The miserable student turnout, after so many statements were made to the effect that they did want football, even in the intra- squad form, coupled with ever-diminishing attendance at daily pmctice, and waning in- terest on the part of those few who did at- tend practice regular!,\·. made it futile to con- tinue, so Coaches Hein and Ciampa took the only logical course of action and proclaimed yesterday :that football, has been completely abandoned fm· this year. Those who feel the loss of football on those ct•isp autumn Saturda,\· afternoons have only themselves to blame. Had they shown the interests that their previous state- ments indicated was present, and, either by word ot· deed, supported football, we would still have contests in that grand sport on Satm·day afternoons, either in intercollegiate competition or in intra-squad form. How- ever, lack of manifested and sustained in- terest has forced the complete abolition of football on the campus for the first time in many years. though it proves to be no excuse. scot·ed by Steve Bulmer. . .. .. .... . ..

Carside, vice president and secretary of the United China Relief and for many years a mcm- her of the faculty of Cheeloo uni- versity in China, will speak at the Empire State Town Meeting in the Old Chapel of Union College on Sunday afternoon, Sept. 19th f.rom 2:00 to 2:30, advocating repeal of the Chinese Exclusion Act. Dr. Carside has done much to build up the. central office in this country of the Chinese Universities and is widely known as a friend of China. During the first world war he served in the United States Navy as a Chief Petty Officer. It has proved impossible to ·bring to the Empire State Town Meeting an advocate of Chinese exclusion under the existing act of Con~ress. So Dr. Burges Johnson will take from the published records of a hearing before a Congressional committee the arguments in fa:vor of continuing exclusion and will ask Dr. Carside to answer them. over the Lions, winning 22-6.

History of 27 Years of Radio Told As U CRS Celebrates 2nd Anniversary By PAUL F. YERGIN q>--------------- For almost thirty years radio has been a center of student in- terest at Union College. Before the last war there was a Radio Club at Union and it has continued ever since. 1n 1916 the college radio sta- tion 2YU operated by students, did research work on. loop antennas which resulted in the adoption of this type of aerial for direction finding and other work. After the war the Radio Club was reorgan- ized under the leadership of E. D. Cook, now an executive in the GE: Company_ Junior Prom, the Radio Club built a receiving set into a baby carriage and pushed it up and down State St. and other parts of the city, with the set tuned to W2XQ. This event was written up in almost every newspaper in the country, and in many foreign countries. A~ noted in another item in this is- sue, this feat will be simulated by UCRS at the Junior-Senior dance this Saturday night. It is interesting to note that in the winter of 1920-21 a man wrote to the Radio Club stating that his wife had held a dance for some friends in her house, the music having come from. a receiving set tuned to W2XQ. Other reports in- dicated that the programs were well received in the whole eastern United States. The reborn society quickly be- gan a vigorous program. After a. year of experimenting, they began. in 1920, a regular series of radio broadcasts. These were the first musical pjrograms put on by any college station, and some of the Two Stations Operated first in the country by anyone- In the following year the station At that time there were only two continued its broadcasts, but did other stations of :my importance little wm,thy of note.

The Girl of :\1y Dream», solo, Steel years or more the Radio Club came out of its \splendid isolation\ in the Electrical Engineering Labora- tory and again became a real part of college activities. About the same time a new so- ciety was formed, known as the Radio Wo1·kshop, primarily inter- ested in the writing and producing of radio programs. For several years the Workshop put on pro- grams of its own over the short wave stations in Schenectady. About 1940 the two radio groups became interested in the new form of broadcasting which had been started at Brown University in 1935. This system, known as intra- mural ·broadcasting, operates with- out license on regular broadcast frequencies under a provision of the Communications Law which al- lows unregulated broadcasting at very low powers if the signals do not interfere with licensed sta- tions. The power permissible is so small that in order to reach even the college campus it is necessary to distribute the signals to the val'ious buildings by wires, where- upon they can be picked up by any 1 actio in the near vicinity. Intramural System Started In 1941, largely through the ef- forts of David W. Borst, one of the founders of college intramural· broadcasting at Brown, a \wired wireless\ system was put into operation at Union College. The first broadcast took place on Sep-. tember 22, 1941. It was heard· only in North College and the Kappa. Alpha Lodge. In a few weeks the network of wires had been extend- ed from the studios in the Elec- trical Engineering Laboratory as far as South College. In the last two years the system has been. improved until now it reaches al-· most every house on campus. Fur- ther extension only waits on the termination of the war. At first the station was called UBS, the Union Broadcasting Sys- tem. After one year of operation, in the Spring of 1942, the three radio groups on campus combined and have since been known as the Radio Society, with the call letters of the intramural station UCRS. This organization has with- in itself the possibilities for ac- tivity along any and every line of work or pleasure connected with radio; amatem· radio <suspended fm· the duration), regular broad- casting, both from the program and technical sides, and experimental work in radio. It has come out from its hermitage in the E. E. Building to take up quarters in the basement of the Psi Upsilon house, for the duration. In a special broadcast com- memorating the second anniver- sr.ry of the college's intramural broadcasting system President Dixon Ryan Fox and D1. Charles N. Waldron will reminisce on the early days of college broadcasting, This program will be heard on Wednesdya at 7:30 p. m. <1930) over Station UCRS. WSNY. For the benefit of dance goers, the Scuttle-butt will remain open •mtil 11:30. This will enable prom- enaders to refresh themselves con- veniently during the intermission. Since this is the first all-college ~ocial function this year, the com- mittee expects that attendance will be good. The committee has extend- ed an invitation to all V-5 students to participate in this affair. 0---- Kiarman Appoints Council Group The appointment of the Execu- tive Committee of the Student Council waB announced recently by Karl Klarman, president of the student body. In place of represen- tatives from fraternity and non- fraternity ~roups, as provided for in the constitution, one V-12 and one civilian representative were ap- pointed. 'Those named include, in addition to the president, Klarman, Robert B&rnes, '44, chairman of the Stud- ent Tax Committee; E. Carl Smith, '44, secretary of the Student Coun- cil; Reginald Carroll, '45, repre- sentative of the class presidents; James E. Smith, '44, representative of activities; Eugene Whitaker, AIS, representative of V-12 stud- ents; and John Mason, '45, repre- sentative of civilians. Male's Melody Makers Acclaimed in Chapel Under the leadership of Prof. Charles T. Male, the band is con- t;nuing on its way with great suc- cess. In the past two W€eks the mu:;;iciaps have elected officers and are now settling down to the busi- ness of building a repertoire for future concerts and parades. The concert that the band pre- sented in Daily Assembly last Wed- nesday included selections from \The Chocolate Soldier\ by Oscar Strauss, and the march, \On the Mall\ by Goldman. On the preced- ing Saturday. the band appeared on the \Through a College Win- dow\ program broadcast over WGY. ----o·---- Baby Carriage Commemoration Tomorrow night UCRS will pre- sent a special broadcast in tri- bute to those who performed that memorable feat of pushing the· ba·by carriage down State Street playing music from W2XQ. A doll carriage haso been prepared by members of the staff for this event. During intermission at the dance it will be pushed upon the floor. ' a---- Schroeder Preaches Sunday The guest preacher for the serv- ice this Sunday, will be the Rev. John C. Schroeder, Professor of Homiletics at the Yale Divinity School, New Haven, Connecticut. The anthem for the service will be the \Celtic Hymn\ by Rob- erton. As usual, the choir will be composed of the Naval cadets and the civilians. The service will be broadcast over station WGY. \

Tomol'l'ow nig-ht, at Alumni Gymnasium, the Junior-Senior Dance will be held. This event marks the culmination of the efforts of a large number of students who have agitated for social functions here at college fol' Navy and civilian gToups combined. The success, social as well as financial, will de- tennine whether Ol' not similm· events will be held in the future.

ON ITS SECOND BIRTHDAY Congratulations to LT.C.R.S. on its second annive1·sary. This all too little appreciated organization has become, in the brief period of its existence, one of the most active stud- ent organizations. Under the able leadership of its president. Paul Yergin, this neophyte activity has de- veloped into an integral part of the life of the college. Few students realize the tl'e- mendous amount of time lavished unstint- ing-ly by the members of the Hadio Society in trying to bl'ing high class entertainment to every student. In the short period of time from the mer- gel' of the Radio Club with the Radio Work- shop, tremendous strides of progress have been made in radio b1·oadca.sting here at Union. The p1·esent varied setup is a fm· Cl'Y fl'om the first feeble blares which reached only North College and the Kap lodge. Xatumlly developments have been serious- ly hampered by lack of matel'ials, and the ever present manpowe1· shortage which has attacked all activities in these times, leaving ~ most of the work to those few who will z never say die. \Vith the end of the war, ~ equipment should once more be obtainable, ~ and the ever increasing· interest in 1·adio should assme the LT.C.R.S. that their 01'- g-aniza.tion will get its full quota of interested participants when student life returns to nonnal, and more men can find time for ex- tmcul'l'icular activities. \\'l' salute, however, the present organiza- tion, especially its president, whose guiding genius has made possi,ble developments up to the present . .May the ether continue to be permeated, in ever increasing intensity, by the waves emanating from the transmit- tel's of the l'nion College Radio Societ~·- DOING OUR PART Tornorrow night's dance in the Alumni Gymnasium is the first in \vhat \ve hope ·will be a long series of All-Union functions. The Junior-Senior Dance committee should be congratulated on recognizing the need for thi-s kind of affair, a need present ever since 1 July. The two upper classes, the first undei·- graduate group to take action in cementing- closer relations between the two divisions of the student body, deserve our heartfelt praise for giving civilians and Navy students an opportunity to mingle together socially_ As we have already seen, no undergrad- uate enterpnse can succeed without strong support from the V-12 students. Few indeed are the <tctivitit>~ functioning without Nav;r support, financial and physical. .Xo success will be achieved unless the united effort of the college backs future student activities. As members of the V-12 program, which aims to furnish us with as ' nearly normal a liberal arts and science cur- riculum as possible, we must do om· part to maintain student activities, not aloe by financial support but by participation as well. Tickets are stHl available from Student Council representatives. If you have not al- ready done so, get yours either tonight or tomorrow morning and let's pack the gym to the rafters tomorrow night fol' a swell time. -L.G.P.

Union became the mother of fraternities with the creation of the Kappa Alpha society in 1825, and since that time a large percentage of the national fraternities have estab- lished chapters here.

POWERS Powers Preaches In Sunday Chapel William Hanison Powers.

Prizes for Seniors In school, he was a \natural ~tudent.\ He was then, as now, very active and belonged to the usual multitude of high school clubs and societies.

Listed below are the fraternities and the names of those who have pledged. In 1933 Dr. Powers was acting president of Cazenovia seminary, declining permanent election be- cause he preferred work in the field of college religion. At Syra- cuse he has organized an extensive program which each year brings together hundreds of students of Protestant, Catholic and Jewish faiths who work in harmonious co- operation. He is also a teacher in the department of Bible and Reli- gion. Prize CompetitionS' which are open to seniors only are: Allen Essay Prizes-awarded for the three best essays written by seniors.

Army Bombers to Simulate Destroying of Model Street For Instructional Purposes Tuesday at 1930, Alexander Field will be subjected to a simulated air attack. The demonstration will be staged by the chemical warfare de-, partment of the Army. \Action Overhead\ as the show is called, is a travelling unit utilized to in- struct the civilian defense units and to show them the conditions which they at•e liable to face. The demonstration is coming here di- rectly from Cleveland, where it drew crowds amounting to several thousands. The main event of the show will be the destru.ction of a city \street\. This will be accomplished by the means of explosives and fire bombs. The buildings will -be put up on Alexander Field and will talie the form of a three storied hotel, as well as a drugstore, a tav- ern, and various other structures. Realism will be added by the roar of low-swooping planes and the de- tonations of exploding bombs. Fol- lowing this hostile attack, the part of the Civilian Defense Officials will be shown. Students desiring to watch this grandiose spectacle, should be sure to get in the vicinity before start- ing time as a large <!rowd is ex- pected.

Dorm Giants and the Fox Off-Campus Redskins tied for first place each with six wins and one loss. The Redskins suf- fered their only loss at the hands of the Giants last week, and last Monday the Alpha Delta Phi Dorm CardinalS' spectacularly upset the high-flying Giants, 15-12. The Card- inals jump into a first place tie with the Giants and Redskins was rather brief as they lost their next game to the Redskins 6-0, in a very tightly played game.

All games were rained out on Friday but Monday provided enough thrills to make up for the loss of these games. The highlight was of course the upset of the previously unbeaten D.U. Dorm team. The Giants opened the scoring with a spectacular catch of a pass by Platt. This was later nullified as the Cardinals scored a touchdown and a safety to take the lead. The A.D. Phi Dorm scored what pt·oved. to be the winning touchdown after the Giants received a 25-yard pen- alty, which set the winning goal up.

The financial reports ft·om the dl:lnce indicate that it was successful in another aspect also. From all accounts, the music was well re- ceived, the weather was favot·able, and the e11tire function admira,bly planned and cat·- ried out by the committee, especially when the short period of preparation that it had is considet·ed. The committee thus desenes the hearty congt·atulations of all who at- tended, and the high esteem of all the stud- ents for the fine job it did. away, and cannot afford to joumey to the familiat· hearth wheneve!' vm·iety is craved. It thus appems that the most desirable mode of entertainment that is pla,usi'ble and ac- ceptable as well as inspiring is the dance. llnfol'tunatel,\·, for a variety of reasons, it ha;,; been impossible to hold the tmditional1 dance weekends this year, but substitutes I are far !Jetter than Hone at all.

The support by the students was sufficient!,\· larg-e to indicate the '\vide- spread desire and need for such a dance, and the planning of all future dances should take into account the apparent willingness of a la.rge prorportion of the college commmtitr to attend inf'onmt.J social functions, which have been held in the past only with some apprehension lest the members of' the stud- ent bod~· should consider the infonnals un- worthy of theit· august presences. However, this support, although by no means as great as pt·evious vocal sentiments tended to de- note. certainly demands the frequent and quick repetition of this type of function. the nava;l trainees, and which has been a principal cause of the dem'th of informal dances in years past at Union is the dif- ficulty of ol.Jtaining suitable dates for these affaii·s.

Ileretofm·e it was much more feasible for students to relieve the strain of continuous grinding awar with their noses in their books by taking- a day off. going home for a long weekend, or simply \Viii- fully neglecting their studies for ~l few eYenings. \Vith the present intense, concen- trated program class-cutting is a much mo1·e sel'ious offense than in the halcyon peace- time days, and skipped assignments are much harder to mal<e up because, especially under the rigid naval tt·aining program, there just is not time to do any more than the 1·eg-ular daily work. Such weloome interludes from the ennui of continuous scholastic effort are perhaps the most enjoyable to the greatest numbe1· o.f students.

It is emphhasized that, while exercise is essential for genl'ral conditimung, the best way to eliminat€' excess weight is to kf'ep a sharp eye on the numiber of calories takt'n into the bod·y each day. The .question of overweight is a problem to some of you. An aver- age man of 155 pounds needs about 3000 calories of food per day. (This may be 4500 calories if he is very active.) If he takes more than this, the excess will be stored in the body in the form of fat. If, on the other hand, he consumes less than is necessary. he will ,burn ur some body fat and thus reduce weight. Exercise is not a suitable or easy way to ·reduce weight. To burn up one pound of body fat you would have to do one of the following: (,a) wrestle for 5'J~ hours. (.b) play strenuous football fer four hours and 48 minutes.

Beta Theta Pi brings up the rear with 21 men, 52 per cent of its complement, pw·chasing Bonds under this plan. Of thl' 462 men in the unit, 310 have alrPady made provisions for monthly <leductions for War Bonds. The total o1 their contribution is $3,403.25, a figurl' which is well over 10 per cent for the entire en- liste:l f.el'sonnel of the station. Red Rooster Delt:t Phi l>ept the Red Roos- ter in Company C last week, winning the prized award in the regular Saturday morning Bar- racks Inspection. Psi Upsilon is still in the lead for the honor of winning \the Rooster\ the most times, with two victories to its credit. So f'ar as the boys in Delta Phi are concerned, however, none will beat them this week without a strong fight. ALMANAC FOR COLOR GUARD: Sunset next week comes at approximately 1845. According to Lieutenant Zenti, d:irector of the physical training. program, \Those who have observ- ed the V-12 unit here both in July and today. noted a distinct im- provement in both the ·individLal trainee's military bearing and mus- cular tonicity. I think the results of the check strength tests indicate clearly that a worthwhile improve- ment has been made.\ Although i·ncreases were register- ed in the percentages achieved in each of the five events, officials pointed out yesterday that the im- provement made in push ups and pull ups was unsatisfactory. In an effort to boost trainee scores in these latter tests by the finals in October, special remedial exercises like chinning and rope climbing will be undertaken immediately on an intensified scale. The new features of the obstacle course have been designed, in large meast:re, to aid in developing bi- ceps, it was stated'. A final conclu- sion based on the results of the strength tests is that leg work, as compared with bicep development, has produced highly satisfactory scores. Status of Varsity Men A letter received recently at phys- ical training office here from dis- trict headquarters states that boys on varsity squads will not have to take their regular hour of physical training. This ruling, which will probably go into effect next term, will not apply to men beginning their ·basic tiaining period then. Following is a detailed picture of the strength tests scores in July as compared with those registered this week (all scores are percentages based on 100 as perfect): July Sept.
