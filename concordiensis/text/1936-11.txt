AN EDITORIAL The sophomore committee on enforcement of freshmen rules, an. o1·ganization in name apart from the Sophomo1·e Disciplinary Com- mittee, ran amuck several freshmen, and in a forcible manner punished them for failing to obsel've freshmen rules. Hooded and dis- guised like members of the Black Legion, ten or fifteen hoodlums raided Old Gym Dorm and the freshmen section of South College, overpowering their victims and cutting their hair, a custom of the dim past. These measmes ove1·step the bouNds of COllllUOll deCellC,Y a11d should nut ue COlJdoned with in the futme. If the sophomores cannot find a more sane and int.elligent \Vay of en- forcing theil· 1·ules, we suggest that they abolish them altogethet·. At the same time it seems evident that few if uny of the fresh- men intend observing them, and after last night's episode few respectable upperclass- men will want to see them enforced.

Martin Loder, Donald Roberts, Edward Gagen and Leo Kupecki were attacked by the group and given hair-cuts. In addition, Loder's eye was swelled and Kupecki suf- fered minor scalp injuries. According to information re- ceived at The Concordiensis office, the gang allegedly started out from the Phi Sigma Delta House on Par·k Ave. Going down Union St., they met Leo Kupecki, who was wall<ing to Park Place in search of a promised job. They attacked him in the street, cutting his hair, and injuring his scalp near the back uf the head. They left him there, to be treated for hi~ injuries at a nearby pharmacy. Taken for \Ride\ Entering the Old Gym Dorm at 8:30 o'clock, the men, masked in 1 ed, white and blackhoow, Halllow- e'en masks and handkerchiefs, and carrying C'lippers, went to Loder's room, number 10, on the first floor. They carried the struggling ft·esh- man to the Memurial Chapel, where they cut his hair. They tllen put him into a car and drove ·UP Unior1 St., dropping him some blue!<:> away irurn the campus.

Wilbert Heinz '40, who -..va:> ntuming from band practice u.t the Gymnasium, was forced to knock on the door, asking admit- tance in his own name, and threat- ened with a haircut if he refused.

Our Landon Club, Roosevelt Club and Hoople- for-Happiness League. are but 1936 versions of an old idea begun in 1896. Since that time, all but three presidential elections have roused the students to voice their opinions (more or less violently) as to the virtues and vices of the candidates. During this peiiod the Concordy has talten five straw votes. Of these the Republicans have captured three while the Democratic nom- inee has taken the other two. But in every case, except the Hoover- Roosevelt election of 1932 when Union favored Hom~er, the man who won the straw voting was the one elected president. Practically every kind of political device has been used in these cam- paigns to sway the minds of the students. In 1928 the Hoover Club even .persuaded Dr. Charles Alex- andel' Richmond to back their man with a speech. On the other hand the opposing Democratic organiza- tion on the campus, the Smith-for- President Club, not to be outdone, drafted Dr. Waldron as their leader. It was during this same cam- paign that the Smith-for-President Club was host to Franklin D. Roosevelt, then candidate for gov- ernor of New York State. A mon- stel\ celebration and mass meeting was. held for him. But of all the presidential elec- tion campaigns that of 191G was by far the biggest for Union. Wilson and Hughes clubs were ·formed with each side having a member- ship of neal'ly 100. Even the Con- cordy urged on the battle with edi- torials deciaTing \our children will find a whole chapter in their his- tory books devoted to these ·big years.

Both sides held torch light pa- rades and attended local political rallies en masse. Led by the Col- lege band the vVilson Club marched from the Campus to the Hudson Theatre to attend one of these ral- lies. But the Hughes men wet e not to let the matter pass so lightly. They gathered nearly 100 followers and made· an attack on the line of march, but after several repulses, they retreated, defeated. Roberts was threatened into practical hysterics, and his hair cut. At that point, Walter Williams, '37, dormitory proctor, returned from another section, and drove the in· truders out. Rollin Wright '39 and John Kruesi '37, upperclass resi- dents of the dorm, were out at the time, while Vaughn Alexander and Sidney Brayton '39, and John Karu- zas '37 watched the pl'oceedings, unable to do anything. After being forced out of Old Gym, by Williams, the self·consti- tuted disciplinary committee went across the courtyard to the room of Edward Gagen on the first float· of Middle Section, South College. There they held the fre:>hman down and cut a cross in his hair. Gagen is dependent for his board upon. a job in a downstreet restaurant.

Ray Lewis, a superb end in the second half, tlagged a Bwwn pass on a cross over for Union's second touchdown. The .place kick was wild. ·So impre>;;;ive was Union's second half drive that their uninspired play i.n the opening half was hatd to explain. Of couroe it could be explained by saying that Williams let up after piling up an early lead; but that, most ce-rtainly was not the case. The game was won and lost in the fiFst ten minutes. If Union had gotten the jump they very con- ceivably might have won. Williams is a .front running team. When they are beaten to the punch they have a very inconvenient habit of folding up lilte accordions. You can't take away the fact that they had an impressive squad, glutted with splendid backs and good line- men like Stanley, Simmons, the Stear'nS twins, Stanton, Lewis, Col- man and King. They were well coached. The interference on the sweeps looked like a Pitt play all tlre vvay, but there was something lacking. Their spirit was forced and wh.en the going got rough and Union began to move they lost their temper-s and statted to haul back long lefts and rights. The best back on the field was not Stanley, but Brown.

A NEUTRAL I Last night really put the cap on the colossal faretl that has been the subject of much recent com- ment, for last night the \Sopho- more VigHantes\ decided to put the · scre\Vs on the unruly yearlings. ·with· that in mind numerous masked and hooded sophs removed certain marked frosh from their lares for tonsorial readjustments. At least three unhappy lads were divested of portions of their crown- ing glory. That is not too funny- at least for the Frosh. What is humorous, though, is the fact that this action may be attributed to the failure of the upper classes to make student body a serious affair. How can one blame the boys in the up- per deck .from joining in to what is the biggest laugh on the campus? The funny part is that the Frosh must pay for the mistakes of their seniors, though we fancy that some We fail to see why so much em- phasis should be placed on fresh- man rules after so long a lapse in their application. We think that thio rebil·th of the uld idea of class z ivai! y is most desirable, but the manifestations do not seem to .1Jt in with the pre~ent scheme of college life. In short, the rah rah days are generally conceded to have passed. Why not let the dead past keep its dead?

Thursday morning he will ad- dress the student body in the daily assembly exercises, and at noon he will be -entertained at luncheon in the dining room of Hale House. An informal discussion will follow. Wrote \Alllla Ma.ter\ At his first appearance in his capacity as honorary fellow in March, 1935, Dr. Canby advised Union students not to be \profes- sional youths.\ His recent book, \Alma Mater,\ describes in detail part of the professional youth of the 1920's who felt that to be young was to be important. Dr. Canby is known as an author, editor, contributor and lecturer. He received his Ph.B. and Ph.D. from Yale University, and the degree of Litt. D. from Knox College in 1927. He is director of the editorial board of the Book-of-the-Month Club as well as editor of the Saturday Re- view of Literature. He served as literary reviewer on the New York Evening Post from 1920 to 1924, Dr. Canby was one of the first seven distinguished men in public affairs who were appointed as honorary fellows to Union College for three-year terms.

Mr. Stebbins, originally an engi- neer. has become noted in this country for his productions, which include \The Green Pastures\ \The Pursuit of Happiness\ and \White Horse Inn\ whicll is at the Rocke- felle:r.· Center Theatre in New York. Miss Doyle is a vice-president of his corporation, in charge of pro- duction work. Sh:e will stay at the college until after the opening night, conducting dally rehearsals. Work on the Soviet farce on love amidst adverse housing conditions has been going on for the past three weeks, but members of the cast predict that the lights in Han- na Hall will burn with a purpose e'ver;y night from now on. Student reservations for the play will be open nex:t Wednesday. Carrell' A. Gardner, formerly a mernber of the college athletic de- partment and once sheriff of Sche- nect4:tdy County, was a:lso elected into ,office. He won the county clerksb.ip on the Democratic ticket by a ·Pl,urality of 2,796 votes. Bray, of the cla,;s of 1911, was reel\'ctEd lieutenant-governot· of New Y'\01·k; Heck '24 was reelected a:;sernblyman; and Dr. Treder '04 was reelected col\Oner. Both Heck and Treder are Republicans. D:t·. Cummins' 1,872 majority in Schenectady county was an over- whelming victory for the Demo- crat.s here, but the 14,045 votes given Cr-owther in Fulton County was almost twice as much as that received by Cummins in that county. Montgomery and Hamilton counties also supported Crowther, who 1vas returned to the House for the te·nth consecutive time. G~udnel\'s victory is regarded as the outstanding accomplishment of the Den1ocrats in this county. He fills th.e vacancy left by George T. Bra-dt, indicted clerk. He defeated Lou.is F.

Fr()sh Are Told Red Cross Begins Value of Rules Drive Tuesday Ev~r~st Explains Purpose of Rules and Stresses Usefulness F\reohman rules are not a chal- lenge from upperclassmen but are designed to acquaint freshmen with college life, Robert Everest, '36, Presi<len t of the Student Council, tole! members of the class of 1940 assoen1 bled this noon in the Old Chape 1. Neither the Student Coun- cil n~r the college administration wilt tolerate any more violence or destru:ction of college property, he warned. The strong spirit of the class of 1940 has been noticed with approv- J.l, .said Everest, but it appears now to be beaded in the wrong direction. He urged the freshmen to put away all feeling of antagonism and to forget. the unfortunate incident of Monday night. The episode was the act of a.n unofficial group and in direct violation of the rules of the Stu.dcnt Body and the college. The per-pe\tr!Ltors will be suitably pun· ished.

Roll Worl{el'S Named Various Careers In Public Service Internships Stimulated By Union The first stage of an important~-----­ experiment in practical education was started in the past summer when 13 Union College students studying the inner workings of state and local government were given the use of the facilities of the New York State government to carry out the Union program of internships. Tuesday morning in daily assem- bly Dr. Patterson H, French, asso- ciate professor of government, who was appointed to the faculty with Dr. Douglas Campbell in 1935. fol- lowing the pronouncement by Pres- ident Dixon Ryan Fox concerning the institution of a course in prac- tical government, made the first official report on what his students had been and are doing. \Our Union College program,\ Professor French said, is worked out on the theory that some stud- ents will want to supplement their study of state government with some direct experience in state offices In Albany or New York. By direct experience I mean more and more than mere observation and study; I mean these elements plus dirct contact with the work of gov- ernment. \This does not .necessarily mean a paying job; four of the thirteen internes last summer had paying work while the rest did not. \One important feature of the work is its entirely voluntary char- acter. All of the internes had taken the course in s,ate Government, but they had teceived theit· grades and were given no additional schol- astic credit for this extra worlr.\ At Albany seven men received jobs in the department of law. The;y are William Freedman '36 of Albany, Laurence F. Paulus '36 of Rhinebeck who is doing his in- ternship this fall while he is at- tending Brooklyn Law School; Irv- ing Br-ownstein '37 of Albany, Mal- colm M. Arny '37 of New York, Marvin Katz '37 of Troy, Wilford A. C. LeForestler '37 of Troy, and Henry B. Whitbeck '37 of Cherry Valley.

Benjamin H .. Ripton Dies This Morning Former Union College Dean Was Here 35 Yea1·s; Beloved by All Dean Emeritu:; Benjamin H. Rip- .on, who wa.s dean of Uruun College ;ur twenty-live year:;, and a men1· ber of its faculty for thirty-flve years, and for a time its acting treasurer as well as dean, died this morning in White Plains, where he made his home with his daughter, Mrs. Thomas Glenn Hoffman. Dean Dipton was at the helm of Union College during its \recon- .:ltruction period\ from 1894 to 1919, when under the p1 e:;idencies of Andrew V. V. Haymond, '75, and Charles Alexander Richmond, the college regained its position among the foremost small colleges, a posi- tion it had held until 1866 when the rllustrious Eliphalet Nott died after J2 years in the presidency. A ver·satile man, a great adminis· tr a tor, and an out,;tanding teacher of history \as a recm u of humdn rife,\ Dean Ripton left his indelible mark upon Union College, said Dr·. Charles N. Waldron, secretary of ,hf' college and of the Graduate Council. Dean F:.ipton joined the Union :'allege faculty in 1886 as adjunct pr·ofE'ssor of mathematics and from 1887 to 189·1 he was professor of mathematics. He then became pro- fessor of history and sociology, a position which he held until 1910 from then until 1921 he was profe,.;. sor of history and government. He was appointed Dean of th~ faculty in 1894 and served in that capacity until 1919, when he re- ,;igned his administrative office to devote his entire time to teaching Rtlles An~ foll'sidered l.T~eful Concordiensis Survey Reveals Damages to Be Paid (.'() lh.•gf.\ Discipline Committee P'lans to Take Further A.ction V\'hile a Student Council commit- tt'<' 1s taking deHnite action against the ,;tudent<> who at taclwd fresh- men l:>.londay night, general opinion on the ca.rnpus favor:; the useful- ness of freshman rules and ap- pvoves of their enforcement. A sur·vey made by The Concotdiensl5 rcvealed ideati for enforcing th\ regulations varying from the estab- lishment of an upperclass di~ciplint! comn\littee to leaving the freshmen on th e!r honor to obey them. 'I'he men involved Monday night will pay for all damages, accord- ing to Robert D. Everest, president of the Student Council Council and chairman of the College Discipline Committee, composed of himself Benjamin Rathbun and Winterto; U Day. Other meamres will also bf taken and will be made public very soon, according to Everest. Agree Rules Are Useful Everyone seems to agree, the Concordiensis found, that the fresh- man rules are de fin it ely useful and. that if they ar-e presented to the freshmen in that light they will be obeyed. President Dixon Ryan Fox: sug- gested that perhaps each freshman should make a deposit of money at the beginning of the year· and .should forfeit it, if in the opinion of an upp~rclaas committee, the frcsll- man has violated rules deliberately and persistently. President Fox b··- lieves that the usefulness of the freshman rules should be explained at the beginning of th12 year and that the present f1 eshmen be shown that e;ome ot.her cuUJ\l!P frol!l the one they are !liking wuuid be soeially tlet>irable.

Log Book of Outing Club Narrates Colorful Story of Club'~ Career Strang.c as it may seem, the most prizetl possession of the Outing Club is a rather unattractive grey and red notebook. Every organization has some pos- session which it prizes more high- ly than anything else. This note- book is the Outing Club's tJeasure for it contains the history of the club since it acquirC'd its first cab- in In September 1935 and began a really active existence. The book contains the membership li~t of the club, the signatures of all who have stayed at Ski!habn on Gore Mt. and press clippings of ali the club's activities. At the beginning of 1935-36 the membership of the Outing Club numbered fifty students. Nine members made the first trip to North Creek where the club's cabin is located near Thirteenth Lake. Nineteen subsequent trips were made during the colle>{e year, and altogether the register was signed two hundred and thirty-four times. The largest number of people to stay at the Sldihabn Camp was sixty-seven, who attended the Ski Weekend which the Outing Club held January 31-February 2 for members of the Intercollegiate Out- Ing Clubs Association. The small- est number to stay at the cabin was one-Bob North. Students from sixteen colleges stayed at the cabin during the course of the year. Four of them were from foreign counh·ies- Cze- ch.oslovakia, Ath>tria, Germany, and M€xico. Sevet·al were from dis- tant states--California, Michigan, and Virginia. 'The most lntere,;ting items are, of course, the press clippings on the variou:il activities in which me1nbers of the club participated throughout the year. Besides many weekend jaunts for skiing, five je>int outings Vlere held with other clubs. The Vassar Outing Club cabin in the Catskills was the scene of two weeltends in which Union participated along with Skid.more, W-Illiams, and Yale groups. Union twice played host to tne Intercollegiate Outing Club Asso- ciation at Mt. Marcy in the Ad- Irondacks at its annual College Wee!{, before the opening of the fall terms in 1935 and 1936. The unofficial ski team which was organize<! last year partici- pated in a number of meets with other colleges and laid the found- ation for the establishment of an organized team. Invitations to piLl'· ticipate In s]{i meets this year have already been received from Brown and Yale Universities. Looking for·ward to an even more successfUl season this year, mem- bers of the club hope the red and g-.r:ey bool' may be filled with an even more in:terest!ng record than It now contains.

These are tht> :-;pntiments which many of us would lil\e to express. \Ve feel that all the editors of this board have done in the past is to pilfN· the g·enerosity clll<l goodwill of the students. They have printe<l a manner of intellectual dribule which would embarrass the faculty advisers of many hig·b school periodicals. Now we have the goo<i fortune of having on our faculty a ma 11 whose name has been linked with contetn- porary American fiction am! journalism f<>r a decade. To think that he must humiliate himself by acting as faculty adviser to th.e Idol Board prompted us to direct our jibes at this defunct magazine. Furthermore tile housekeepers of Hale House are complaining about it; when literary giants of the cate- gory of Hem·y Seidel Ca111J~' visit the cain- pus, the administration warns these wom~n that they must make certain that all copies of it are secreted in the furnace of tlu boiler house or some other convenient spot where it is not so available as in the mag-a- zine rack of the Student or Faculty Loung-~. This virulant attack may be guilty of gross hyperbole; in truth it is. However the es- sence of it should reveal that certain phases of theh Idol will not stand inspection. When the students regard its issues as objects most appropriately designated to the waste- paper basket, when they in fact anticipate its publication S{) that its cover can be used as a third base, when the editors themselves do not understand nor make any effort to understand how they can publish it, the time has come for a shake down and investiga- tion. There is a place for a magazine on ear · campus :providin.g it is a good one. Why not let th.e Idol die, and in its place publish a periodical of the best exampl~s of the Eng- lish composition courses. N. R.. S. N. R. S. EVERGREENS, SHRUBS, AND ClftOCI In an institution such as this, there is always a considerable amount of work done that is accepted as a matte1· of comse. Though the improvements resulting from this work an:! recognized, little thought is given as to just what happened to bring about that work. Amo11g such impl'ovements at Union is the work done recently in im- proving the general appearance of the cam- pus, particularly in relandscaping it. The gardeners have replaced the old hiRh lilac bushes around the Old Gym Donn and \Vashuurn Hall with suitable low evergreens. They have also planted new evergreens and shrubs around almost all the othet· college buildings, and have provided evergreens fo1· the various fralernitie:s to plant. In addition, they have made many improvements in Jackson's tlardens, and completely !'ear- ranged 1\Irs. Perkins' Gm·den. The result is that even now, when the late autumn season adds little to the natural at- tt·activeness of the campus, the appearance i:>. vastly improved. In the spl'ing. the im- provement will be eve.n more apparent when the crocuses and other spring flowers set around the campus begin to bloom. Chaugt>s like these do not just happen ; they must be originated and planned by someone. In this case the pe1·sons respom;iule for the gem'ral improvement in the appear· ance of the campus is Mrs. Fox. To you, Mrs. F'ox, we extend the sincere thanks of the student body for the fine work you have done in planning the many improvements in the landscape of the campus.

The club plans a trip to Skiihabn at North Creek this weekend for all those interested in hunting, The Gore Mt. territory offers excellent hunting ground for deer. Anyone interested is asked to be at the Old Chapel at 1:15 tomorrow. A trip to Skiihabn dul'ing the Thanksgiving recli!ss is also planned. The club further voted to invite various fra- ternities to the cabin for weekends. In spite of the fact that Roches- ter stands as the favorite to win, the se.,·enth team to hold that hon- ored position· of favorite against Union this year, the Garnet is con- sidered by native prognosticators to have the advantage in tegained spirit and enthusiasm. There is something more tangible than that, however, that throws the balance of favoritism to the Rivermen. LG Riggs . .. . .. . . .. .. . .. Ferraro C Barton . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

It is, he said, non-com- petitive and anyone may join. The team will enter several meets and carnivals this year besides sponsor- ing meets itself. Union has been hampered again this week by many injuries and will undoubtedly miss the full serv- ices of weakened linemen and backs. Added to that dismal situa- tion is the long-anticipated loss of Clayton Adams and Charles Chapin at guard and tackle, both of whom are to be replaced by Jimmy Riggs and either Van Ladd or Rick Angle. There is some belief that Jack Smith, who is making his first ap- pearance with the team since the Middlebury engagement at the start of the season, will play in at least part of tomorrow's game. His old post at halfback will be taken at the start of the game by Tyler Den- nett, still with a splint on his little finger. In case Dennett cannot make the grade Coach Nitchrnan will have George Ha.sltell, Wally Hughes, and Howard Smith on hand besides Jack Smith. Yellowjackets Trlcl!y Rochester has had a fair season thus far, winning two games and losing three. Oberlin. and Hamilton were the two teams defeated, both by pretty big scores. Last week Rochester played a bang-up game against the strong Hobart steam- roller, the same which flattened the Union machine at the sta1t of the season. Rochester's 13 points in that game means a lot In the pre- dictions for tomorrow's game. \Dulte\ Nelson, who scouted the Rivermen last Saturday, declared that the Union-Rochestel' fracas will probably be a high-scoring game with both teams wide open on all their plays. Trick plays will be the special forte of the Yellowjackets on their field tomorrow. In the Hobart game Rochester didn't use a single straight-running play.

At the season's outset the var- sity's hopes looked dubious. Bill Ketz had a swarm of untried soph- omores and the long-limbed captain to build a team around. The soph- omores came through with a quiet bang and as a reesult the team ha.s won two meets out of four. Ketz also issued vague reports about his freshmen although he did confess having a find in Santoro. His attitude however was -non-com- mital rather than denying. 'Two of the men, Jack Fisher and Blll Johnson, proved to be in the same league with Santm·o and the team was set. Of course tomorrow it can be upset, but that is only a possi- bility not a probability. Indominable William At Rochester the varsity will have to run home in a. -hurry if only to get out of the cold'. There have been reports of snow but the course will probably be cleared if the fall is at all heavy. Hawkes bl'Oke a. long standing record here last week under balmy conditions, and provided the footing Is secure Long William should ha.ve some- thing to sa.y about the Rochester course record tomorrow. Coach Frank Gordon-'s Yellow- jackets have been. .depending on three veterans Don McPherson, Joe West, and Sumner Kircher. The new men are also worth worrying about since in their num.ber :·s Wallie Erskine, a sophomore, who was rated one of the best distance men in the Rochester high schools for two consecutive years_ Bob Williams, a transfer from Wesleyan who won his letter at Middletown last year, is also one of the finds. Walt Bond, another new :rnan, Don Kreide!, Lew Delaney, and Ed Bowerman form the remain.der of the squad. Dud Cornish, of last year's team, is unable to n.m be- cause of an injury he received this summer. This green team has wins over Colgate and Hamilton, which doesn't seem to be doing anything right on the athletic fields this fall. The same team will appear for the frosh which started the year . They have been singularly :fortun- ate in that they haven't been plagued by leg injuries. Jack Fisher has had to have his leg tightly taped before each meet, but this hasn't prevented the Buffalo star from consistently placing behind winning Santoro. Joh11sen, Ross, Melewicz, Murray, Hoffman, and Lol'd will be the other Garnet rep- resentatives. The meet will start at two o'clock, and will m.ark -the close of one of the most successful frosh seasons Ketz has had since coming here. KODAKS RA:IJIOS FOUNTAIN PENS Expert Repairh1g J. T. & D. B.

With Middlebury invading the Alumni Gym for the fiL·st game only a short month from nov;, Coach Nels Nitchman Monday ts· sued the initial call for vatsity basketball candidates. He was t·e· warded with a group of about twenty-five, which has increaseJ and decrea.aed during the fit·~~ week of practice. Handicapped by the loss of several vetetans whu held down key positions, Nitchman has a tough job on his hands in at.tempting to mold and shap€ an outfit which can compare with the highly successful aggrega tlun <Jf last year which won most of it\ games, dropping but five hard con- tests to big opponents_ Captain Teddy Podbielski heads the list now worldng out daily in the gym, but there a.re other men about whom Nels will build. Grant Smith, rangy center, was the pivot man of last year's quintet, an.d Ken Brown, George Doyle and Vince Smith-who has not yet rE· ported because of football work- all saw plenty of action last winter and will, in all probability. be among the first six players. Johnuy Schultz, who played freshman ball two years ago and who is now rE· turning to start his sophomore year, is another prominent conten· der for a berth, and at this early point, seems assured of getting one. Several Hopefuls The remaining candidates include several hopefuls from last season's frosh team, namely, Halpern, Rathbun, Lubansky, Stewart and Miller, in addition to about fifteen others, including sophomores, jun· iors and seniors. Nitchman may select four or five of these men to round out his squad usually num· bering about ten or twelve men. Practice has been limited to the learning of fundamentals, lay-ups, cutbacks from the sidelines an.d corners, fakes, and reverses, in ad· dition to the learning of the \weave\ which is employed by the CONNELLY BROTHERS DAIRY, Inc. 1858 HAMBURG STREET PHONE 2·091 0 will please you in $5.00 to $7.00 a. pair for all occasions Patton & Hall 245 State St. For Deluxe Coaclles Call G.

As yet there has been no scrim· mage except short se<Ssions of about live minute<i duration in which the sevet·al teams run through a rou- tine \weave.'' Prospects for a successful season, while not what they might be. nevertheless, are not too gloomy. Teddy is one of the cleverest play- ers in any league and has an eye which rompart'<S favorably with that of a hawk. Grant Smith has height and plenty of ability plus a year of varsity experience, and should be a vastly improved player this year. Brown, Doyle, Vince Smith and Schultz all are men of experience, and with a bit more coaching should turn into reliable players. The soph candidates, while a bit gt·een, should be able to land one or two of their number on the squad, filling out a team which will have height, accuracy, and above all, a thorough knowledge of the game. Nitchman will see to that. PERSONAL DEAR DAD: I don't need that extra money I as~ed you to send me.

Y., Nov. 10. Dr. Ernert E. Dale, assi:stant professor of Biology, has been invited to ex- hibit the vesults of his petunia re- search at the Seventh Intei·national Congress of Genetics, whi,ch will take place at Moscow, Russia, in . August 1937, it was announced by Dr. James W. Mavor, chairman of the field of biology at Union Col- lege. Dr. Dale has been conducting research on petunias for several years, especially on the problem of variegations (which are genetically unstable characters.) These results are to be included in the experimental work on pe- tunias at the Congress. Dr. Dale has conducted his re- search on petunias since his grad- 'late work for a doctor's degt·ee at the Umversity of Michigan, to which he has returned for ad.di- tional ex.perimental work nearly every summer fot' many years. During the summer of 1935 he worked on petunias at the experi- mental gardens of the California Institute of Technology, Pasadena. T'J::e results of Dr. Dale's re- search, said Dr. Mavor, will have important bearings upon genetic problems in general, especially upon the study of variable char- acters in heredity. ------o----- Union, Slddmore Froslt Mix Freely at Frolic Approximately four dozen Union freshmen swarmed over Skidmore Saturday afternoon and evening. Confused: and excited by the prob- lem of locating their designated dates at their tespective dormitor- Ies, they soon found themselves in the gay company of an equal num- ber of Skidmore freshwomen. After meeting their dates, they went to the gymnasium and. then started o.n a treasure hunt -which was divided into four groups each competing against each other. The winning group was awarded a package of cigarettes for each member of the group. The entire group dined at South Hall. The dinner was broken up when it was announced that the Union varsity and freshmen had both won. their football games, the Hall reverberated with the cheers of the Unionites. Following the din- ner there were songs by both schools. When the dance started about nine o:clock, the girls picked their own partners,. while the music of the Garnet Goblins began to fill the hall. Several ingentous methods of picking the crowd were employed. In one dance, the girls took off one shoe put it in the middle of the flom:, and then the boys each pick- ed up a shoe and danced with the owner after she was located. In another, Slddmore stickers were cut in half and distributed among the guests. The recipients of each enu then became partners the next dance. -----o------ Outillg Club Gets Ski Jf' ol'kout at Lake Placid The second installment of dormitory rent is due on the same date as is also the second quarter dining hall fee. Bills have been issued covering these two payments. The comptroller's office will be open for payment fwm 9:00-11:45 a. m. and from 1:00- 4·45 p.m. on Monday. Fellow in I .. etters Pays Second Visit Hemy Seidel Canby, Editor, Will Hold Round Table Literary Talks Henry Seidel Canby, who will be- gin his visit as honorary fellow on the campus Wednesday afternoon, is undoubtedly the chief adviser to the American reading public. The well-known author is the former editor of the Saturday Review of LiteratLll e but also is the chief of the editorial board of the Boolc of the Month Club which helps select the reading material of ove.r a hun- d! ed thousan<l people. During his visit at Union, Dr. Canby will conduct at least two round table discussions for stu- dents interested in literature; he will address the entire student body and meet with at least one class in Bailey Hall. First Talk in Silliman Dr. Canby will first attend a tea of the English ·staff at Hale House Wednesday afternoon, it was an- nounced by Dr. Burges JC>hnson, head of the field of English. On Wednesday night he will have din- ner with President and Mrs. Fox at the President's House. On Wednes- day evening at 8:30 all students studying English litetature and any others interested may avail themselves of a round table discus- sion with D•r. Canby in Silliman Hall. In roaming throl:lgh the ftles of The Concordiensis that were edited in pre-war days and during the World War, it was tound that the world-wide contHct had a great ef- fect on the campus life. President Charles Alexander Richmond, fac- ulty members·, and the :;tudent budy were ~;wept along with the swelling tide of patriotism as the college formed a batallion and drilled two hours daily. Athletics even came after drilling, us many a football pmctice was held after suppeto. As. early as September 1916, the eollege ,;tal ted p! epal'ing fur war. 8everal giaduateo and student:; were list~cl as National Gumdsmen with their headquarteu; on the Rio Grande in Texas. Speaket·s spoke on war conditions in Europe, and edito!ial8 appeared in the college paper urging the stut.!Pnts to take up military training. On February 16, Hl17 Piesident Charles Richmond sent a personal message to the President of the United States, Woodrow Wilson, of- fering the services of the college to the government if war was de- clared against Germany. On March 3, President Richmond and 24 fac- ulty members sent telegrams to Wilson urging the declaration of war. President Richmond followed this manifesto by touring the south and eastern tier of state.s, spealting on the necessity of a common front against Germany. The student body participated eagerly in the usual collegiate \'pre- paredness' activities. Three hun- dred students joined the college ba- tallion, which was outfitted by money donated by a number of the alumni. A machine gun cotps was also inaugurated and a course in map reading given. Finally, the faculty allowed students to substi- tute military training for any three hour course. By May 11, 43 mem- bers of the student body had left for Madison Barracks. In fact, three members of the Tel-race Council were \tapped\ at tiaining camp. Patriotism was the keynote of Commencement. Sixty percent of the students r·e- turned to college in September 1917.

Robert Doig Assistants H. Hartmann F. Hequembomg D. ::\liller Tuesday, November 10, 1936 IS AMERICA WAR MINDED? In a small French transport railway ear eighteen years ago today far in the lines of the Allied forces an emotionally spent dele- gation of milita1·y and diplomatic officials met to discuss terms for armistice. We commemo1·ate the meeting of these foreign powers with solemn demonstrations of rem- onstrance against war and at the same time laud the memory of great military leaders by recalling their tactical skill and deeds of valor. It all .seems so pmadoxical. Why does New York City shower confetti down on the heads of the parading ex-servicemen 'I Why will the President receive the hysterical plaudits of a peace loving populace for a preparedness speech? At a time like this why do the veterans of foreign wars try to recall the gory details of life along the Hindenberg Line'! l!'\ there not something inconsistent in this attitude? We do not mean to decry armed preparedness. Only a foolish individual would say to America- Throw down your arms-without knowledge that every other country was pledged to do the same. Indeed the best way America can keep at peace with the world is to show Europe and Asia that it can exist in isola- tion of them, and to temper its sword increasingly stronger so that they will fear trying to break this isolation. Th.ere are two .states in the relationships of nations, peace and war. When one is not at war it is said to be in a state of peace whether or not it gives every indication of being a1med to the teeth. In this respect a military state compares with a highly developed muscle man. As long as Prome- theus does not exert the superiority of his physical .equipment over his neighbor no one would include him in the category of bullies. No less true ought this to be of nations. Just so long as a nation maintains a non-aggresive attitude towards other states we ought to ness, which condition is. healthy. The people TENTIONAL.

Outing elubs, scavenger hunts, hall danc...,s, and afternoon teas will be a matter of course with the collegiate da~rLSels from now on. A ne\V chapel, capable of seating 2,000 people, has been started at M:<lUN\l' HOLYOKE by the gift of an a11onymous de>nOol'. Led by President Mary E.

The role of the spinster, Lorinda Channing, provides unlim- ited possibilities for an actress of talent, and Miss Packer made the most of them. Her splendid per- formance, more than the very clever and exciting plot, furnished the tenseness and thrill necessary to a successful hol'ror play. ·t Our Congratulations to Mcs:ors. G. Smith and A.

Despite ~orne poorly-created minor charac- ters and several flaws in the struc- ture of the plot, thrills and chills :>bound In the play. Certainly, secret panels, treasure, a woman returned from death, are enough to keep any audience on edge. From a technical -point of view, the main fault of \Invitation to a Murder\ is that it is overbalanced. The personality of the principal ~haracter, Lorinda Channing, is not off-set enough by lhose of the minor .personages to provide the halance necessary to a good drama. This fault is the result primarily )f poor Cl'aftsmanship in the crea- tion of the minor roles. Collectively and singly they do not compare in dramatic power to that of the domi- nating spinster. Donald Foster in the only role, b~side that of Lorinda Channnig, w1th real dramatic possibilities, gave an effective performance only 'n the last act, when, as the doctor wrongfully accused of murder, he equalled Doris Packer in the dra- 'llatic intensity of his performance. Previously his acting was faltering md, though not lacking in sincerity, was not as good as the part de- served'. In contrast, William Valen- tine and Bran Nossen Cwho ap- peared in the :Mohawk Drama Fes- tival at Union) did fairly compe- tent acting in poorly created roles. vym!am Valentine was very con- vmcmg and clever in the part of a dilletante except in his final scene the dramatic possibilities of which he unfortunately failed to fulfiil. The creation of suspense in \In- vitation tD a Murder\ was cleverly handled, particularly in the use of lighting and in the make-up and costume of the sinister Miss Chan- ning. Her anemic appearance and. pale purple gown gave her a ghost- !?', sinister ~ppearance quite start- lmg I~ the dimly lighted scene. Also effective were the swayjng branch-s of a palm tree in the darlmess out- side the center window of the set :Vhicb gave the ·impression of a sin~ 1ster figure ready at any moment to enter the room and commit murder. In fact the stage effi!cts and well- timed action created as much of the thrill and suspense as the plot itself. I ! I.

PHONE 4·9444 The Union Varsity Cross Country h•:~m closed a su'ccessful season :-l<tt unlay when they outran the hat·I iPrs of Rochesler, winning by thl• ,;cure of 24-31. Led by Captain Hill Hawkes, who captured his futll th fil'st place out of five meets, tlte Dutchmen allowed only two Yl•ilowjacltet,; to gain a low place. Harry Myrt·s pulled the surprise of thP day, running fourth for Union with Dun Thompson rounding out the victol'iuus five. Walt Bond and Howard Sheffer gave t!H· spectators the thrill of the day when they battled It out for second place. Erskine was leading Wells by 50 yards until the sprint aml then it was a neck and neck affaiz· with Erskine winning out by a no:<e. Wa.!t Erskine of Rochester led Eu \Vells to the tape by a IPngth for second place. DPspite the snow-covered four and three-tPnths course, Hawkes ran a beautiful racp in the time of 23: 1:>. This meet at Rochester closed a season of three victorels and two defeats for the Ketzmen. Opening the season by losing to Vet·mont the Dutchmen hit their stride and took Middlebury into camp by a perfect score. R. P. I. then conquered the Union harriers by a score of 19-36. The Purple runners of Williams then came to SehenPctady to fall before the Gar- net and White, losing 23 to 32. Sat- uz day the Ketzmen traveled to the Kodak City and won their last me<>t of the season. Captain Bill Hawkes was the out- standing performpr for Union. He broke the home course record and took first place in four out o.f five meets. Howard Sheffer and Ed Wells ran consistently well throughout the season. The sum- maries: 1, Hawkes, U; 2, Erskine, R; 3, Wells, U; 4, Bond, R; 5, Shef- fPr, U; 6, Delany.R; 7, H. Myers, U; 8, Thomson, U; 9, West, R; 10, Annesse, U; 11, McPherson, R. Union \s offensive, however, when presente-d with opportunity, was marvelo:us to behold, and with no errors in judgment or decision, moved forward in the style which has bee:n displayed by Garnet op- ponents during the early part of the year. 'Tyler Dennett, who evi- dently likes to start things for his touchdov;n against Williams in the mates (he paved the 'Way for a same manner) entered the game in the closjng- minutes of the second period, He then. trotted with the ease of a v---eteran back to the twen- ty-yard lin-e, cutting inside an end and faking a back with a surety that looliecl mighty pretty. His next effort w:as a 17-yard pass to Ernie Brown who was brought down just three yards short of a score. It was a. tense mO<ment for the Union sup- porters, for the :scoreboard showed but two minutes· to go as two run- ning pla.:ys into the line were halted. But Billy Thomas tl1en scooted through right guard as Barton and Potts .provided an opening and the t eferee's hands went up. Brown place-lticked the extra point, kicked off to R.ocbester, and the half-time whistle llle-w. through tackle and Brockmyer failed to gain on a simil.at• play, Passe took the ball for the re- mainder of the distance to score. Hammerstrom split the J>·Oles for the final point of the season and the 20th point of the game ..

Page Four 'Chanticleer Hall' Debut A Success Local Light Opera Company Makes Promising Start With Operetta Friday, Nov. 6.--'fhe Schenectady Light Opera Company tempted PrnvirlPlH'P tnnight wh<'n thPy pr<'- sented as their initial effort the I premiere of \Chanticleer Hall\ an npPnl hy HnhPrt R ~tnnP Rt thP Mont Pleasant High School. The cast was facing tremendous odds in the form of an attempt at an untried perfoz mance, a Ia cit of experience, and a scarcity of enough strong voice$; yet the oper- etta was more than a fair success, and drew a capacity audience. lnculca ted in a trite plot, as old as Shakespeare, in which Colonial ladies masquerade as country dam- sels, thereby inducing a number of complications, there is very original dialogue, and a clever technique that does not allow interest to lag at any time. The authot' employs a humour which, although full ol anachronisms, enlivens every mo- ment of the play and does not re- tard the progz eo,; of the story. Most of the characters move with an unrestrained freedom. Only a few, lacking expel ience, can y the it roles in a fm ced, affected tashiun. One young artist, John Carruther;:, in the role of a ribald Sheriff's offi- cer, steals many ot' the scenes in the play and draws much sustained aplause from the audience. By and large, the acting was exceptionally good. It is the music, however, which gives the opera its charm. Written in the Gilbert and Sullivan tradi· tion, and based in large measure on an old English folk song, ''What Shall We Do With the Drunken Sailor\ it has a jovial rollicking quality, and a simplicit~· of appeal that even the severest critic might enjoy. Although there were few notably excellent voices, the singing was certainly a::; good as might bP ex· pected from as young a cast. Out· standing solo wotk was t!one by Keneth Hallenbeck as Squire Ban· tam of Chanticleer Hall, in a Vl'I y jolly drinking song. Ashley Dawe;:, as Harry Sherwood, the companion of the Squire's nephew, showed re marllable sincerity in a solo bit, while Phyllis, landlord Tuppit's daughter, played by Beth Walsh, without doubt displayed the most talent of the evening, in several solos and quartets. Although th\ chorus of thirty voices lacked strength, it was on the whole very pleasing. All in all, this production of the Company made an auspicious be- ginning. Certainly such effm ts should be encout·aged. \Vith a few more voices and mot·e conthlence, their next opet·etta should be sonw- thing to look forward to.

As arranged so far, seniors inter- ested in various professions will hear repretientatives fron1 the pro- fessions at dinner meetings in the fraternity houses. Those seniors who are member.; of othet· fratet- nities will be able to attend on an exchange basis; that is, by having men from the fratet·nity at which the meeting is to be held eat at the other house. Independents will be asked to pay a small amount fur the dinner. Attendance at the din· ner is not required. However, it may prove beneficial, the Placement Bureau states. Following the dinner, thP speak- er wilJ meet with the seniors in one of the club rooms for a short tall' and period of questions. Two meeting,; havP alrt>ady bc<>n arranged.

For some ·16 years now this lone statement has -been enough to arouse something with- in every student, alumnus, and friend of either Union or Hamilton to the bul'sting point, for these l wo anc-ient but friendly rivals · have met 43 times on the football field, and the colorful series has come to mean much in the souls of those affi.liated with l>oth schools. this year is no ex:.ception, for a victory will mean. a great deal to either team. Union. will be seek- mg to continue its winning streak u.nd to round out its season with four wins and four losses, while Hamilton will strive to make up for a rather disastrous season, since it has won but two games. A victory ovel' Union would practically avenge all defeats suffered so far. In the series which started with a conquest by Union in 1890 to the. tune of 26 to 10, the Garnet has a slight edge in the matter of games won. Union has taken 17 of the battles, Hamilton 16, while ten games were tied, seven of the latteJ' being scoreless con tests. Union's scoring powet· is also cle~rly evi- dent when it is pointed out that 506 points have been run up by the Dutchmen over the long siege, while the Continentals have ac- counted for 272. However, the ad- vantage of Union in this respect is considerably due to one-sided victories rung up in 1895 (96to (}) and in 1924 (()2 to OJ. Much of thus data is practically worthless in predicting the winner of tomor- row's fray, for past accounts are not valid in such a ga.me. The fact to be considered is that Hamilton trails Union in the matter of games won over the period by but one battle, and it is to be realized that the Clintonians will concenti•ate all their efforts to cop the game which would even the count and make next year's scrimmage the battle of the century. Records Compared To compare the seasonal records of the two teams, we see a slight favoritism in favol' of the home team. Union started the year by playing mediocre, listless football,· and was set back on its heels three times in a row before the machine finally began to click and two games were won. The three lost· were to Middlebt!l'Y, Swarthmore, · and Hobart, while Vermont and R. P. I. were taken i'n order ~ Ooach Nitchman ironed out defects and inspired fight Into a team that seemed destined to {!. disastro~s season. Against Williams, the next . · opp~;>nent, the Garnet played fair ball for a half, then, whipped and stuhg by a pep talk during the half, turned about and outplayed the Purple invaders, finally suc- cuml>lng after a hard fought game. Rochester was next muzzled as the Dutchmen set up a solid defense and won, 7 to 0, making the seas- on's x•ecord to date, tht'ee won and four lost. Hamilton, on the other hand, has- been experiencing setbacks· . right and left. Ol>erlin beat the Contin- ental>:~ in a bitter feud, 13 to 6; Rochester, another arch rival of the Clintonians, whipped them 18 tu 7; Trinity and Hobart each took one-sided games from. them. But then, as was the case with Union, Hamilton about-faced a.nd took two ;;traight gaiiles, um~ fi om Swarth- mot e, 7 to 0, and one last Saturda-y fl'om Haverford, 2 to 0, as a safety wu.,; scot cd ·in the closing minutes.

Enzer Friday, November 13, 193& IN RESPECT FOR A GREAT TRADITION From the hills of Clinton, New York four- teen young college students strug-gled in horse and buggy and trains to om· campus, where before a handful of curious spectators, representatives of both colleges battled back and forth over Library Field to see who could push an enflated, potato shaped pig-- skin across each other's goal line the most number of times. The Hamilton boys might better have stayed home that day, fot· the men of Union rolled up twenty-six points to their opponents ten, and that was in the days v;hen a touchdown tallied five points. But the fact that this g-ame was played then made possible the two colleges competing the next year, which in turn gave precedent to another game, and so on till the present day. This series is now one of the oldest contin- uous ones in this country, and certainly the mo.st important in New York State if Mr. l\Iorris' article of the New York Herald-Tri- bune evaluates the historical evidence cor- rectly. Behind these many years of association lies a deep eooted feeling for tt·adition, tradi- tion which keeps alumni returning year after yeae to their alma mater, tradition which reaches the interested outsider as the vital spark in collegiate relationship, tradition which lends atmo,sphere to our learning methods. The annual game has built aeound itself a rivalry that at once is bitter and friendly. Nothing could wreck a successful season at Hamilton more than a defeat at the hands of Union. If Hamilton won every of them, full of wit and wisdom, and 1·eally eagee, we think, to help their student charges in some way. In themselves, they fulfilled eve1·y expec- tation. They were sincere, they knew their fields, and they tried to give out some of their accumulated experience. However, their efforts, insome cases, have failed, through no fault of their own. The visit of D1·. IIemy Seidel Canlw to the campus this week is almost an exagger- ated illush·ation of this. Dr. Canby met with students, spo1\e \Vith them, and even spoke at them, bul the concensus of opinion among theh English rnajors seems to be that they got little out of it. This is by no means Dr. Canby's fault, for he very evidently tried his best, and was rather evidently not too much a.t ease in some of the cit·cumstances in which he found himself. The fault, according to students who were in at the death, seems to lie with the faculty. The member~ ~f the division interested mon- opolized the visit, both at the round-table and to a lessel' extent at the after-luncheon conference yesterday in Hale House. These gentlemen evidently did their Lest to impress D1·. Canby with their immense lmowledge of any given field of English liteatm·e, even to the extent of j mnping down the throats of their own classes with all four feet. At Silliman Hall, tJ·eating the topic of Pur- itanism, one tmlucky wight who had stayed up for nights writing a paper on Cotton Mather was intellectually mauled to a prac- tically shameful degree, while the rest of the students looked on in feozen horror. Dr. Canby, we know, was not amused. After the luncheon yesterday, the ques- tioning was not done primarily by students, but by the faculty, and Dr. Canby was asked about the pmper way to run an English de- partment and \d(}n't you think ours is nice?\ game and lost to us, they would call a meet- 1Under such conditions, the Honorary Fel- ing of their board of trustees to investigate low is certainly not at his best.

DOWLING Craig·'s Wife (Columbia; Director, Dorothy Arzner; Proctor's) adapted from George Kelly's Pulitzer prize play of the same name is a faith- ful tt·anslation of the play in lines and spirit. Using a smallel' canvas than did Dods,vorth, it makes its point, that a woman going into marriage only for material security is essentially dishonest, just as surely, though by different means. Harriet Craig <Rosalind Russel) has been married to Walter Craig <John Boles) for two years when the picture opens. By her contacts with various people and her explicit conversation with her niece it is plain that she married him only for the material security which he could bring her and that she has translated that into social security by making her home a temple of good taste, cleanliness and exclu- siveness. When she finds that her· security is threatened because Wal~ ter, who is romantically in love with her, has been circumstantially involved In a murder, she fights to preserve the home she has built. But in her fight she knows her true spirit so that Walter's aunt (Alma Gruger), the niece <Dorothy Wil- son) and the servants find reason to leave the house. Walter also realizes the inhuman nature of the <Continued Pll Pa-s-e .1)) HIS job is to look for trouble be~ore it happens.

Johnson Flays Magazine Editors Blames Modern Periodieai for Careless Writing in New Jersey Address Atlantic City, N. J., Nov. 14.-\If 0. Henry fell short of great.lless the fault lies with th.e magazine editors of his time,\ decla1 ed Dr. Burges Johnson, professor of English, in an address here today before the New Jersey English teachers. \We have destroyed man:y of our potentially great writers in the same way,\ continued Dr. Johnson. \Our vast magazine circulations, the high prices paid for manu- scripts, and the pressure upon the popular author to get his story fin- ished in time for a certain issue all tend to produce hurried work. The idea that might develop into a great novel is hurried into short- story form to catch up with sched- ule; and even the short story which might be a literary achievement if allowed to ripen., is picked green from the bush and gGes into print as merely a synopsis of what the author dreamed of writing.\ Tells Reminiscences In his reminiscent talk to New Jersey teachers, Dr. Johnson told of his friendship for 0. Henry, and read one or two unpublished let- ters \written when we lived only six bloclts apart, just because he had thought of something he had meant to say when we were to• gether the night before.\ In speaking of Mark Twain Dr. Johnson recalled his habit of \cuss- ing,\ which he said had no moral sig-nificance but was a \disease of the vocabulary\ not mo:re than \tongue deep.\ Dr. Johnson when he was a small boy met the .poet Whittier. \My brother and I\ said Dr. .Johnson, \had been taken by our mother to call on the poet at his summer home in New Hampshire; and we were carefully instructed to re- member everything that the great man said to us, as we would want to tell it some day to our grand- children. But all he ever said was \ 'Here, get down out ()f that tree!'\ ~~~-10--- Sunday Times Shows Pads Unveiling Memorial Bench A picture of Francklin Wynne Paiis '39, which shows him unveil- ing a stone memorial bench erected in memory of war-time ambassador Jules Jusserand of France in Rock Creek Park in Washington, D.

Glenn Sees Life As Misinterpreted. Rector Says Christ's Parables Are Misconstl'ued by Those Seeking to Understand Sunday, Nov. 15.--Christ's para- bles, illustrating the spiritual sidE' of life, are too commonly misinter- preted by the man who seeks to understand the ways of G<>d, Rev. Leslie Glenn, rector of Christ Church, Cambridge, told h.is listen- ers at the Sunday Chapel service this morning. \We are always trying to inte1~ pret the stories, with which Jesus made his points move obvious, in terms of ourselves. We see them only as practicaJ. stories which merely teach us .a moral about de- tails' of living,\ said Dr. Glenn. \If you would uncl.erstand them, catch the full flavor of their mean- ing, compare the parables with other stories like Aesop's fables which are mainly little moralities about how the details of life should be conducted.'' Not Meant to Be Practical Howeve1•, the Lord is not telling us to be practical; he is not giving us ways of arranging the small parts of our lives, even though no one better understood how to live the practical life than He. A modern rnoving picture of the parable of the Prodigal Son would have the wastrel as the principal character. That is in accordance with our way of thinking. But it is really the father, keeping his eyes on the road, wat{:hing and waiting for the return of his son, who is the real hero. Similarly, in. the story of the Vineya.rd, it is not about the laborers, who have been paid un- equally, that the story centers. The parable deals with the owner, I E'p- resenting God, and his problem of distributing as best as is in his power a livellhood to all who work. \I think it is best to know the spiritual side of things first,\ con- cluded Dr. Glenn, \for that we can always have with us.

G. Morley \Because their problem was an agricultural one,\ said Dr. S. G. Morley, Spencer Lecturer, in Daily Assembly this morning, \the lifayans turned their atten- tion toward the manifestation of time. They determined the length of the year, the time for the planting and the reaping of crops and the time for the for- e:;ts to be felled. Probably by the method of trial and error, they discove1 ed that the year was Ionge!' than 365 days, and short- er than 366 days. \Tbe study of the Mayan Civili~ation has not only em- ployed archeologists,\ statecl. Dr. MorlEy, \but has brought in lin- guicts, botanists, zoologists and agronomists. The study has re- vealed that the civilization reached its first zenith in the South in the 7th century after Christ. A collapse of the agr i- cultural system caused .the quick decline and a subsequent removal of civilization north- ward to Yucatan where it achieved a Renaissance.\ Consumer Problem Is Topic of Forum Terpenning Will Lead Talk on \Chain Stores m· Local Mel'Chants\ Dr. Walter A. Terpenning will present the second in the series of Schenectady Public Forums in Old Chapel tomorrow night at 8 p. m. when be will discuss the problem o.f \Chain Stores or Local Mer- chants'!\ This forum is one of a number dealing with the general theme of the consumer and his problems. Dr. Terpenning is considered one of our leading American sociolo- gists. He obtained his Ph.

Spencer Lecturer To Describe Mayan Culture Tonight Morley to Speak on Earliest American Civilization in Second Spencer Lecture \Vill Be Illustrated Lantern Slides Include Some Taken by Mrs. Lindbergh In Aztec Flight The Mayan Civilization repre- senting \tlle most brilliant cultural expression of ancient America and the highest point reached by the American Indian in his centW'ies of existence\ will be described in some length when Dr. Sylvanus Gl'iswold Morley of the Carnegie Institution, delivers the second Spencer Lecture of the year. The lecture will take place in the Old Chapel tonight at 7:30 and will be supplemented by hand-colored lan- te.rn slides. HistOI'Y Once Unlmown Twenty years ag-o, according to a long illustrated article of the National Geographic magazine, by Dr. Morley, the Mayan Civilization was a sealed chapter in earliest American history. It is to Mr. Mor- ley and his associates that we owe the greater part of our present understanding of the astonishing achievements of the Mayas, those \Greeks of the New World,\ whose cities flourished in Central Amer- ica from the 4th to the 8th cen- tures A. D. In this civilization, the greatest intellectual accomplishment was the working out of a chronology using the abst:mct mathematical quantity of zero at least five cen- turies before the Hindus devel- oped the fundamentals of our Ara- bic notation in India. Work in Chichen Itza Dr. Morley's own work has been centered since 1924 in Chichen Itza, the most holy city of the so-called New Empire of tbe Mayas probably founded toward the end of the 7th century A. D. in nm·theastern Yu- catan. Chichen Itza was chooen for extensive study by the Carnegie Institution because \it presents a blending of the two most important native cultures of North America, the Maya and the Aztec.\ Excel- lent air views of Chichen Itza and other Mayan cities in the Yuca- tan and Guatemala, taken by Mrs. Charles A. Lindbergh during a flight of her husband's in 1929, will be included among the colored illustrations. (Continued on Page 4) Miss Doyle Doesn ~t See Everything; Finds Dance Goers \Well-Behaved'\ $-------------------------------- By WILLIAM W. MULVEY \I was quite surprised; there was little drinking. In fact, everybody was very well behaved\ commented Miss iY.Iit iarn Doyle, Broadway thea- trical director, now on the campus directing \Squaring the Circle,\ when asked yesterday about her im- pression of Saturday night's frater- nity dances. Miss Doyle, it must be explained, was taken on a tour of fraternities Saturday night by a group of the more representative members of the Mountebanks. Questioned as to how the dances at the different houses impressed her, Miss Doyle answered that she remembered the Alpha Delt-Sig Phi dance as being \very nice\; the Psi U's as having a \good dance or- chestra\; and the D, D.'s as having the \loudest gayest crowd.'' What Miss Doyle meant by \gayest\ we never did find out. We are afraid there was quite a bit of capering Miss Doyle did not see. For example, a Phi Gam fresh- man in the process of dressing, opened the door of his clothes closet and out fell Brother .......... with an ernpty bottle of Scotch in his hand, and as the frosh put it \stiff as hell.\ .All this took place at 8:30 ih the evening before the dances had even started. Then there was the two Alpha Delt's wbo, in a generous mood, de- cided to bold a party at the Mohawk Hotel following th.e dances. They hired a room; procured a band; and George Heraths, Joe's, Van Curler mtd Tony's all did a rushing busi- ness before and after the dances. The genial George held sway at his tavern on W~hington Avenue, and by the sheer power of his magnetic personality kept everybody satis- fied. One of his classic remarks was: \The skys the limit tonight fellows, .but please, please don't scale the beer pads.\ bought confetti and noise makers. The affair never came off, however, because they were waylaid at a bar and forgot to invite any g-uests! Now, we ask you. did the Mounte- banks show Miss Doyle everything? Much of the entertainment of the evening must be attributed to the Hamilton boys. Blum and Patten were riding merrily down Union Street about 1 o'clock. Sunday morn- ing when they spied a fellow lean- ing against a tree on the corner of Seward Place and Union ~treet. He was clad in tails but coatless, and was attempting to flag passing cars. Thinking he might be a fraternity brother in distress, they stopped. He turned out to be not a D Phi, but a Theta Deit from Hamilton. He was however, in distress. He had lost his coat, he was very much inebria- ted, and he was hitch-hiking to Clin- ton. Well, they poured him into the car, brought him to the D Phi house a:';ld, kind souls that they are, put htm to bed. Everything went fine unlH about 6 o'dock Sunday morn• ing when the whole D Phi dorm was awakened by the Theta Delt'a very loud and puzzled question: \WHERE IN HELL AM I.\

What was it? Why, it was the answer :to Nels' call for freshmen hoopsters and was answered by 3& aspiring yearlings. Nitchman took one look at the mob and a smile of satisfacti.on tinged with dread ,e<:rossed his face. His job it was to weed this group out and to pick the :best ten playe1·s to carry on the fortunes of Union's f1eshman basketball team for the coming sea- son. Practice ]!:wtdamentats Nels imme·diately put his new charges to work pivoting, shooting, pasblng and going through. the base fundamentals of the game. H(}arse cJies, gtunts of approval, muttered execr·ations, and fitful laughs were rampant in the gymnasium for the next 60 minutes as he tried. to pound eentie into brains that were either blank or filled with the cogwebs of disuse. The afternoon's blunders were finally concluded with short scl\irnmages bet ween six quartets wo.rking at different end,s of the coUI t while he triE:d to keep track of all six. However, Ned.s does not C()nsider the material poor and feels confi- dent that the group of 38 will pro- duce ten players for the permanent squad that will go far In the coming seaBon. Among those 38 who turned <lUt are Lescohier, Kozievcar, Watson, Mnier, Tanner, Murray, Melewlcz, Mould, Brockmeyer, Busino, Patrie, Perry, Pintaval, Isabella, Britton, Jenkins, Underw.ood, Buchanen, Fay, Hansen, Johnson, and Arnstein. ---o Spirit Sllown by Students In Pre-Game Pep Meeting Cheering and singing, over one hundred students paraded about tile C!).mpus and the streets of Schenectady in a pre-game Beat- Hamilton pe]J rally Friday night. 'l'he mad procession started at the gymnasium and ended wlth the singing of the Alma Mater on the steps of the Van Curler. After opening the meeting- in the gym with college songs and cheers, Co-captains Ernest Brown and Wil- J!Rrn Potts were introduced amidst great noisemaking and botl:l spoke briefly about the forthcoming game. More cheers followed where- upon Coach Nelson Nitchman de- llvered a short talk about the ex- cellent spirit the team had shown during the season and predicted that they would be at their best for the classic battle with Hamilton on the morrow. \Duke\ Nel~on told of the personal pleasure he would derive from seeing this game as he had missed the la:st five contests. With a few more cheers the meet- ing broke up and the snake dance downtown started. under police es- cort. With horns blowing, ccowbells ringing and toy bombs ex:.ploding the group varaded down Union Street delaying traffic, across Erie Boulevard to State Street and thence to the Van Curler. There, after a period. of singing the greater part of the fellows retired to the Tap Room .to complete the evening and do a little personal pep-rallying. Final Cut Due This Week; Ten or Twelve Men Will Comprise Squad Get your man!! Aim For His Chest!! Steady Your Shot!! A G-Man story? No, just the shouted commands of Nels Nitch- man, flel'y coach of the basketball court to his charges every after- noon. Evidently these c-ommands are having the desired effect becau.;;e the squad ha:: i·roned out those early season rough spots and is rounding into a smoothly running machine. To date the squad has been wm k- ing primarily on fundamentals, with special emphasis on passing. Pivot- ing, faking, guarding, and switching are all being stressed by Nels and the team is a witness to the profits of his teachings. Captain Teddy Podb:ielski is get- ting his old eye again and is put· ting the apple through the strings with his usual consistency. Much in the way of scoring will be demanded from him this winter and Nels is putting a great deal of hope in Ted's eye for the hoop. Stlarting Five Improves The combination of Ted Podbiel- ski, Ken Brown, Gl'ant Smith, George Doyle, and Johnny Schultz is showing rapid improvement and will probably comprise the starting line-up against Middlebury. Follow- ing them are Vincent Smith and Charlie Wiberley who are making themselves conspicuous by their ef- forts and will give the- first five a hard fight for the positions. Next in line axe Dave Miller, Ben Rath- bun, Frankie Myers and Arby Hal- pern-ali of which are showing ra- pid improvement and shGuld see quite some service befo1·e the sea~ son ends. At present the squad numbers around 15 members, th~ first cut having been issued a couple of day.s ago, Nitchman expects to reduce the squad still further to about ten play- ers and will probably malte the cut ln the near future. It i.s still too early to predict but rest assured that the Garnet will have another A-1 team and will go far on the basketball courts this season.

Running Doesn't Curtail Life's Span Says Hawl{es S:ilU! day, Nov. 14.-The long- ~tanding theory that distance run- ning, mm e than other sports, weak· ens the heat t and curtails the span of life was disproved by William H. Hawkes, lanky captain of the Union College CI·oss-country team, in a ~hapel talk this morning. Hawkes declared that \a rather remarkable fact is that a fellow weighing over 150 pounds ve1 y sel- dom makes good cross-country ma- terial. This is because light men have light muscles which develop ~ueh more .easily and do not tend · o knot up in p1-actice.\ Though rangy himself, Hawkes ·ddcd, \anothez point is that lanky :um with a long ~tride are not a.l- .\'a.ys essential to a CJ css-country 'earn. Slender leg::; are evidence of light mu~c!es which are the type vhich stay loose and pliant after levelopment. And it is this looseness 1f stride which is one of the requis- ites of cross-count! y running. \Strange as it may seem, the tor- tor us expression so often registered on the face of athletes, and partic- ularly at the finish of races, is not the result of severe muscular strain or physica;l exhaustion, but is found to be caused by more intense men.- tqJ concentration, known as game- pitch.\ The Union ha1riers ran a com- bined distance of 1,881 miles in their five meets, this fall, Hawkes esti- mated. -----()1--- Hawkes Runs 42nd At N~ YG in IC-4A Union Runnel' Finishes Sea- son With Good Showing Against Country's Best William H.

Passe of Pittsfield, Mass., Frederick (Ccmtinued on Page 4) Wednesday, Nov. 18-Ten junior and senior students in the B. S. in Chemistry division, accompanied by Dr. F. C. Schmidt, left tonight for an extended three day inspec- tion trip of the chemical indus- tries In the vicinity of Buffalo and Niagara Falls. This is the first long range in- spection trip which the Chemistry department has undertaken since 1931. The party will visit the fol- lowing places: Spencer Kellogg and Sons, Socony-Vacuum Oil C(}m- pany, Larkin Company, Dunlop Tire and Rubber Company, Na\ tiona! Carbon Company,- Carborun- dum Company, Hooker Electro- chemical Company, Liquid Car- bonic Corporation, and the Niagara Hudson Power C01·poration. Transportation fot• the trip is by automobile, each member of the party being responsible for his own expenses. Those making the trip are Weils C. Denison, William Cap~ynski, Jr., Angelo Marrotta, Philip Moore and Harris Paton of the class of '37, and Winterton Day, William Jacober, Jr., August E. Laurenski, Louis Thomp;;on, Jr., and Matthew Wilson of the class of '38. This trip is being conducted with the idea of giving the students some first hand insight on the ac- tual working conditions· in the various chemical industries. By ac· tually seeing chemical operations, more can be leat·ned in a few hot1rs about this phase of chemis- try than could be learned from te:xt books in several weeks. ---o------- Frosh to Publish Issue The Concordiensis for next Tues- day, November 24, will be edited and published by members of the paper's journalism class for fresh- man reporters. TJ:J.Is class, which is taught by Mr. Milton M. Enzer, as- sistant to the President and head of the News Bureau, will have en- tire charge of the edition, from the fir;St phase of news-gathering to the final stages of make-up at the p!•in- te:r:'lif, 'l'he Skater Was Willing But the Ice Was Weak Or. Fox Pre~icts. Council Abolishes The Idol Curb on Liberties • The I ur.e ·Of the ice proved too strong for Joe Paul, 38, last Tuesday. Drawn by an irresistable longing to do a little pre-season skating, Paul, accompanied by a fl'iend, Fred Fagal '38, donned his skates and ventured out on the thin ice barely covering the Hocke~' Rink. Nothing happened. \Do yell ~think I can make it across?\ he asked Faga!. \Sure his .companion replied from the bank, \if you go fast enough.\ Taking him at his word, Joe started across the film of ice. Halfway across the already protesting ice gave way, and the skater found himself chest- high .in fl'eezing water. Once on shore, Joe did not pause. He dashed back, over grass and ·dirt and cement to his dormitory room in North College. And probably because he felt that since they had gone so far with him, they might as well go all the way, he left his skates on his feet. EnglishDe:partment Plans Union-Williams Meeting P1·esident Assures Columbia Alumni That Science Will Bar Guesses NEW YORK CITY, Nov. 17.- \What we knew as the 'old Amer- ica' is not going to be repeated,\ President Fox said today at the an- nual fall luncheon of the Alumni Association of Columbia College in the Lawyers' Club, 115 Broadway. \It is certain,\ he added, \that in the future we must have a greater amount of training and experience in the public service. There is no greate1• responsibility for the col- lege than preparing persons fo1• public careers. Fox Is Columbia, '11 Dr. Fox, who was graduated f1om Columbia in 1911, said that the chief worry of those who had op- posed President Roosevelt's pro- gram was that the personnel lacked sufficient experience and education to meet the responsibilities thrust upon them.

It will provide a place for students to say what they think about things anc! personal- ities at Union College. \Nevertheless its horizon will not be limited to the 95 acres of the will have there a chance for publi- interesting to say about anything campus.

Hitchcock Friday, November 20, 1936 A BED-Til'lE STORY FOR COMPTROLLER'S CHILDREN \Once upon a tillle, in the long, dim ages past,\ reads an old legend engrav~d upon a stone still in South Section, South College, \King Eliphalet reigned benignly over an educational institution called Union College.\ \And lo, there came to the college one day a man of mysterious garb and occupa- tion who proclaimed himself a 'plumber.' He entered the court o·f King Eliphalet, and claimed primte audience, which the King, being a curious man and of an original turn of mind, granted. They spoke for a long time, and as a result, the King issued a royal de- cree that there should be installed in the barracks of his retainers an infernal machine called a 'shower.' •·There was much 1·ej oicing over these strange machines, when the retainers had learned not to use them with their best clothes on, and sho·wering became a habit.\ '·But then one day, after King Eliphalet haJ gun~. and his successor, whom some call Eliphalet II, or Pot te1· l, reigned in his stead, the plague visited his realm, and some ro- dents, infected with it, crept into the show- ers. Once more there miraculously appeared the 'plumber', and the showers we1·e fixed.\ \But Union forgot all about the plumber in South Section, and the showers were never repaired, or brought in accordance with the scientific advance which the- realm made. And generations of the dwellers in the reaches of the section trod ()n concrete floors under water faucets and cursed the Fates.\ \There still exists the prophecy that when a man with white hair and spats shall come to Union to reign, the showers, and indeed the section, will be renewed and restored.\ Evidently the Administration has never heard about it. .tlody, dissolve the Idol. Now at no time were either parties trying to cast slurs on the editors of The Idol. No body wanted to or did question their abil- ities. What ev.eryone sought to do was to eliminate a sore spot, a thorn in our side, and it was thought that the fester would best oe healed by drying up the sore, The Idol. We hope that the students will try to find some medium of expressing their literary talents in the near future. Already a move- ment i.s afoot to supplant The Idol with an- other magazine. If its organization is justi- dable, it must prove itself free from the ills of its former counterpart, and it must meet Lhe approval of its public. THE DOLOROUS DEPARTURE OF DOYLE There will be weeping and wailing in the i\Iountebanks Theatre tomorrow morning when a train departs for New York City bearing with it ~Iiss 1\liriam Doyle. Though the1·e will be a play given there tomorrow and l\Ionday, and others probably for years after, there will be for the members of the present staff a little feeling of emptiness. When Miss Doyle goes, there will be no one to be nice to, no one to look after, no one upon whom to practice being a gentleman. Most of all, a .. swell person\ will have left the college. The Conc(Hdiensi.s would like to add its little farewell to that ·Of the Mountebanks. It has been a pleasure to have Miss Doyle here, especially a pleasure because she is im- measurably superior to many of the theatre people who have in th.e past visited the cam- pus. And we look forward with pleasure to seeing the play which she has directed. There is little the Mountebanks or The Coneordiensis can offer Miss Doyle in return for her work here, but she can always be assured that the doors of the Theatre will swing open at her slightest command, and the Concordiensis will not, if she so wishes, send any more interviewers to pry into her private life. AND AT OTHER COLLEGES- At WESLEYAN the various fraternities on the campus are cooperating with the Christian Associa- tion In an embassy on Religion. A dozen younger clergymen are each entertained by a fraternity. The idea is popular and generally successful. At the UNIVE-RSITY OF MICHIGAN in Ann Arbor, Gillett and Johnson, an English firm of bell- casters, have this week finished the installation of a 53 bell carillon In the newly constructed carillon tower. A young American student, recently qf L'Ecole de Carillon; famous Belgian school, is to oc- cupy the place of Carilloneur, and to organize the first American school for the carillon. The students of the organ at WESLEYAN UNI- VERSITY are given opportunity to perform In re- cital at regular Chapel services.

MUSIC By LESLIE PAFFRATH 'Last Tuesday evening the Sche- nectady Symphony Orchestra, unde::r the direction of Kenneth G. Kelley, direct03' of music in the Schenee- tady Public Schools, offered si::x works worthy of consideration. Humperdinck, Mendelssohn, Wag- ner, Glazounow, Grainger, an<l Grieg were the composers repre- sented. A little stage struck at first:, the orchestra found itself quickl:y and rendered a well organized anod delivered concert. The audience applauded the or· ches.tra. enthusiastically and seemeod pleased a:nd surprised at the finish- ed pel\formance of the musicians. The <>rchestra deserves the UD.· stinted support of the music lovers of Sch-enectady and the college i:n its future concerts. Both the repertoire and the exe- cution of the selections showed .a decided improvement over last year's concerts. Mendelssohn\s fourth symphony is the most am- bitious work that the orchestra ha.s yet attempted, This work requires· quick and accurate playing on the part of the strings and careful phrasing to be effective. The string section. was very sensitive to th:.e baton and deserves credit for its perforrna:nce esnecially in this nun- ber, and throughout the evening. fhe woodwinds, however, were rather uncertain and there is mucll room for improvement in this sec- tion. The pr()gram was well balanced; containing both light and heavy compositiOns. In the former cate· gory were the overture to \Hansel and Gr-etel\ by Humperdinck \L'AUt()mne\ by Glazounow, an-d \Mock Morris\ by Grainger. Th.e heavier selections were Mendels- sohn's Fourth Symphony, IntrodUc· tion to the Third Act of \Lohen· grin\ by Wagner and, \Huldigungs· :narscb\ by Grieg. Notes on Contemporaries No :Ro-11?

Smith Annulled There is a very distinct possi- bility that Giant Smlth, the tow- ering centre, has been rendered null and void and· will not be available for away games until the next set of marks appear. Since Smith is one of the three men who appear likely to do much scoring in the first six his loss will be a serious one. The otl::er two, all three are Schenectady high school products by the way, are Captain Ted Podbielski and Johnny Schultz. In the scrimmages against the second team Ted has been able to score as he pleased. Whenever he wanted to make his guard look good, he forebore to shoot and set up plays for his teammates. Jobn Schultz has apparently pmfitted more than he has lost in his yeat· away from Nitchman's restraining hand and Is the standout guard on the club.

But tbe scrappy :Kenneth although a cutter and retriever of the first water has not shown an ability to score comparable even to some of the second team. Of course he may come around but his shoot- ing has been definitely off the mark thus far. The supplementing member of the starting team. will be either George Doyle or Vincent Smith with Smith having the edge, if any, due to his· greater aggres- siveness and experience. Many Question Marks Ex.cept for Dave Miller and Arby Halpern the second team is an un- known quantity. Several men who have not looked over impressive in scrimmage may very possibly turn out to be better• than the ranking men who have the needed Strong Array of Opponents Puts Nelson in Quandary For His First Term Having accomplished a great job in molding a line for Nitchman's backfield on the football field, \Duke\ Nelson is now well started on the task of building a line de- fense and offense for his varsity hockey team, which has already at th'is early date begun daily practice. Nelson has the boys out- side on the outdoor track, wbere they are busily engaged in learn- ing the Nelson fundamentals, which, he explains, will take about a year to master. Faced by an extt·emely difficult anay of opponents, Nelson's job is definitely cut out for him, for lack of enough strong matez•ial to form more than two lines is again the obstacle to surmount just as it has been in past years. rhe standouts of the candidates ar.e I<'l'itz Hawley, Joe Paul and AI Borden, the latter two having come up from last year's success- ful frosh team, and atound these \Dul{e\ will have to f01·m hi:; out- fit.

With the lack of ice always a hindrance, plus a laclt of great interest in winter sports, it is rathet· difficult to forecast a good season for hockey, although the brealts may come and work for the best. ---o--- Letter from Nels poise in scrimmage which can only I should like to here and now ex- be acquired in competition.

Hawld Wittner announced yester- tlay that an official freshman swim- ming team would not be formed at Union, in spite of the fact that sev- eral freshmen have been drilling regularly with the varsity in Foote Pool. The growing interest of the fresh- men, however, has been an impor- tant factor this yea1· in stimulating the greater activity of the varsity swimmers. There is sufficient good material in the freshman group of swimmers to provide the varsity with practice opposition in daily workouts. Among the men who have been working out in the pool and who have expressed their desire to be members of a swimming team were B. Brittin, W, Shaill, C. Passe, J. Colby, D. Wilder, R. Miles, R. King, J. White and J. Cone.

For out of the first welter of blun.ders and misplays has emerged a group of youngsters that has shown so much promise and ability that Nels is undecided as to whom to eliminate. A.lready he has put the frosh througb. three scrim- mages to see how they look undet· fire and the giUdging grunts of ap- proval which someti1nes grace his lips coupled with his repeated switching of men from position to position speaks for the wealth of material which has tu.rned out.

To RA.ltain Te-n 1'laye1·s Nels ·expects to retain ten or twelve players which rneans that he must cut in the vicinity of 25 men from the ranlcs of the aspirants. Consequently, he is in the throes of dread and indecision as to who will make the best ten. Very few of the frosh are too inexper-ienced to be cut immediat.ely and so many of them have had high school experi- ence that it is well nigh impossible to pick the best ten or dozen. It would be much easier to pick around three quintets to carry on the yearling fortunes but Nitchman is hampered by the necessity of holding practice with the varsity and must therefore cut b.is squad to the sma11est number possible and still have the .,cream of the crop.\ Best Prospeds So far the prospects who have shown the most pro1nise are Koz- levecar, Watson, Miller, TannE.'r, Britton, Mould, Busino, Grapicki, Fay, and Brockmyer. Howe\;er there are many others followmg these men wh<> may taJte their posi- tions before the permanent squad is designated.

ON NIGHT DRIVING Death stalked at Union's door as four of her students narrowly averted its grasp in two serious automobile accidents ove1· the weekend. Two of the students, anti a. grad- uate of last year sustained major injuries to themselves in wrecks which happened at dif- ferent times and diffe1~ent places. One car rolled off the road at a curve when the driver, overcome with fatigue, failEd to make the turn properly. While a car, driY.€11 by an inebriated negro operator, c1·ashed inh the others, who had waited until late at night to start their journey home, expecting in this way to avoid traffic; and anothel'l€S'S serious accident, but no less important, happened this same weekend. That they all occurred at night is reason enough to believe that night- driving is a dangerous pastime. We cannot urge too strenuously the .stu- dens to limit their driving to daylight as much as possible. The heavy toll of dl'iving in the dark hardly makes it worth.while. ~N. R. S.

Don't turn your attention to some other column with the bored remark, \Still harping· on the old subject.\ It may be harp- ing on the old subject, but this time let us try it f1·om a different angle. rmstead of om doing all the talking, you do it. Get out and let people know that Union is on the map; show thern that our student body is solidly united and behind their college. Which is more fun-to g·o to a school where everyone yawns and absently says, \Yeah when his alma mater is mentioned, or to attend a col- lege whe1·e real interest and whole-hearted enthusiasm are shown'? A few weeks ago, we had the pleasure of spending a week-end at Colgate. Our aston- ishment soon gave way to admiration at thE splendid spirit which prevails there. Stu- dents, walking to classes in groups of two or three, wel'.e enthusiastically sing·ing school songs. Others vied with one a11other to see who could cheer the loudest. This, it seems to us, is a laudable condition. Some cynics see fit to deplo1·e it as a \rah-rah\ attitude. But of what possible harm can such enthusiasm be? It certainly makes life more ha.ppy, cheerful, and inte1•esting. Spirit cannot be inspired by one person, however. lt is up to every stud.ent to talk about it to his friends. Each man must feel his responsibility and do his part. Don't just say, \sure and forget it. Show some en- thusiasm and make life here a little more in- teresting for yourself and everyone else.

Sit'S: There seems to be some agitation over the IDOL, Union's Hterary magazine. This is, I am sure, a desirable condition of affairs. Last year, when I was asked to act as that magazine's \faculty advisor\ I was told by its ed·itor s and others that it suffered from student apathy If action taken by any committees induces the students to take great- er interest in their own publica- tion, and in the use of their own money which is appropriated to pro- duce it, surely eventual good must come.

A run of a half mile was finally completed at the top of Rabbit Pond and the ·>kiers spent their afternoon there. The other membe1s of the party spent their time skating and wood cutting. The pa1ty was nearly led astray by Ft ed Wyatt when he chose a 3hort-cut from Warrensburg to Weavertown. The road proved to be extremely muddy and rutty about half way in, and it looked for a while as though the group might not arrive at their destination. The club will be at home at North C1 eek, November 27, 28 and 29 . to any students and faculty who desrre to visit. Transportation to the cabin will be available for a limited num- ber on Friday morning. Anyone in- terest~d should see Fted Wyatt by tomorrow noon.
