Lieut. Michalsen is of the be- lief that the visual aid method of instruction is undoubtedly the best and that one hour of movies on a subject is worth ten of lecturing. He feels that since so many men know so little about the Navy and·. its practical operations, that the more they Jearn now the better off they will be in the future. When Lieut. Michalsen attended Midship- men school most of the instructors had not any sea duty at all; at the present time however N.R.O.T,C. candidates are f.ortunate in that the majority of their teachers will be officers with a background of sea duty, and the necessary prac- tical experience. He is vehement in his belief, and with due rights, that It Is the duty of an officer not to know just as much as hia men but to know more so that he ·may' act as a teacher. If an officer does .this he wili gain not only in actual knowledge but in respect, and the latter is of the utmost im- portance. Lieut. Michalsen was commis- sioned an Ensign on February 17, 1943, and recei-ved his promotion on April 4, 1944. Lt. Arthur R. English was born in 1 3U '325 ~-.: Dr. Ernest M. Ligon, professor of psychology at Union Colle~e, has announced a third large g1~t of $5 000 from Dr. Eli Lilly, presi- dent 'of the firm of Eli Lilly & Co., manufacturing chemists, of Indian- apois, Ind., to be devo~ed to the character research proJect begun by Dr. Ligon at Union College. Dr. Lilly, a generous don?r. to scientific causes, first subs1d1zed this project in September, 1941. A second gift was made hi June, 1944, and a third was announced June 13, 1945. This study, under the guidan.ce of Dr. Ligon. is the only .one of 1ts kind in the country. and is direct- ed from the Psychology Laboratory at Union College, the Westminster Church in Albany, and the First Reformed Church in this city. . The first gif.ts were used to eqUIP the college laboratory wit?- the n~c­ essary materials and ·OfflCe eqm;p- ment to carry on such research. Two 8 eparate studies, called by Dr. Ligon \The Attitudes Study and the Curricular Study.\ were begun un- der these first two subsidies. The Attitudes Study was an attempt to discover traits needed to be taught children, and the best age levels at which to affect them. The Cunicular Study is a search for materials which can be used in the t)1ree main character building institutions-the home, the school, and the church.

Granger Tripp, '43, has informed Professor Harold A. Larrabee of a bit of history making in which he participated. \Vhenever, conseq~1ently, v·:e are moved to cancel our pa~·-roll deduction pledge or our military bond allotment, we are facing the decision as to whether or not ·we will keep faith with ourselves and with the future which will determine so much for us m- dividually. This should be especially encouraging to a lot of men on the Union campus. <1) ESQtJmE, JNC .. 1.945 Reprinted from the July issue of Esquire Careful consideration should be given the alter1~atives before we thro\V overboard our established saYings programs by cancelling· our IJond allotments or pay-roll deductions. If our need is for immediate funds, it is recommended that a bond be' cashed, rather th1m disrupt ot· d.iscontinue our regular sav- ings plan. If the purpose behind the desire to cancel is merely temperamental; that is, if we don't like our chow, our present duty or the cur- rent liberty regulations, we should not take it out on our own savings pmgram by re- questing an allotment stoppage. Or if, as civilians, we convince ourselves that the end of the wm· is practically al'Ound the corner, ot· that we could use some extra money fo1· items we can just as well do with- out or postpone, we should take advantage of sol.Jer second thought l.Jefore we cancel our IJond deductions.

POLICY OF OFFICER PROMOTION A note of encouragement for Naval of- ficers and future officers has been struck -with the revelation of a trend toward the more rapid promotion of younger officers to responsible commands. Ilanson W. Baldwin in The New York Times has stated, \That a definite and lib- eral policy toward naval reserve officers are among the Navy's most pressing personnel needs as the war against Japan approaches its apex. Some of the details of the urged reforms are: (1) Elevation of younger officers to high command more rapidly. Promotion during war-time years in the Navy has been far more rapid than in peacetime, but the Army has been far more liberal in its promotion :of young men to high rank and responsibil- jty than the Navy. This is true not only of the Army Air Forces but of the ground 'forces. (2) In relation to Naval Reserve Policy, it is noted that more than 84 per ce11t of the active officer personnel of the Navy and Marine Corps are now reserve officers.

Poly Prep also boasts of a City Champion- ship in soccer. · For two years Jensen tossed his opponents around on the mat- or rather, he wrestled. He did come through with an intramural cham- pionship in his Sophom.ore year. In his Senior year \Butterball\ bounced over the high hurdles in track. Jensen enrolled at Princeton but at that time the Navy and Prince- ton had a little difference of opinion. The Navy came out on top and Jensen reported to the V-12 Unit at Union on July 1, 1944.

Art Caplin's C-2 boys lack the fast ball hurling which can make them a pennant contender. Ross Spicer's team has the pitching with Don Issaacson on the mound •but has lit tie strength elsewhere. With the Dutchmen, Harvey played second base during intra- mural softball, and helped the A-2 squad to an intramural football championship last fall. During the snowy season, \Butterball\ played with the C-1 Hogans on the court in the Alumni Gymnasium. The Hogans were one of the m.ost col- orful teams in the league and were runner's up for the championship.

Whitaker, acting president of the college stated that it was with great regret that he found it necessary to announce the discon- tinuance of the Union College Band until further notice, due to lack of candidates. The band under the considerate leadership of Charles T. Male has in past terms played for the naval inspections held on Saturday after- noons as well as for bond rallies, patriotic observances and blood donation rallies. A welcome feature was the appearance of the band at weekly chapel at which time the selections were well chosen and expertly presented.

Arcand, who was drafted from Union last March, has been ordered to the military academy at West Point as a result of the final competitive entrance examinations which he took the week before he was drafted. Arcand entered Union last July in the civil engineering course on a Jour-year scholarship from the \Vhttc Plains High School. When dt·afted, Seaman Arcand was ap- pC'inted to the radar technicians' training school at the Great Lakes Naval Training Station. Following this training, he was sent to Wright Junior college in Chicago wh~re he is now awaiting his trans- !'er from the Navy to the Army.

This fact in itself is highly indicative of the strong will and desire for the continuance of fraternity life at Union. Fraternities are considered as much a part of Union College as the class 1·ooms and lab- oratories, or as the ivy-covered walls of its historic buildings. The social fraternity system. which has become a force in Ame1·ican education, orig- inated at Union in 1835; and in addition to the first Greek letter society founded here in that year, five other national college fra- ternities have claimed Union as their l.Jirth- place. Union College according!~· has good reason to be known as \the mother of frater- nities\. The strength of an~· fraternity depends upon the character and al.Jility of its mem- bers. Fraternities are interested, therefore, in electing each year a numbe1· of good all- round men who can be counted on to contrib- ute to the welfare of the group. The aims of the different fraternities, on the other hand, are by no means uniform. Fraternities offer \pledges\ to men who they believe will find themselves in congen- ial fellowship and both give and receive something worth\vhile as members. The ternitr offers the candidate prospective strength of a nation is brought to bear 011 a treacherot s and immoral membership, with accomrJanying rights and foe.

Individual members of the fraternity are personally interested in each other and in the welfare of the group as a whole. l\leml.Je1·s of a fraternity refer to their associates as bmthers, and that term describes quite ac- curately their relationship to one another. Thus, we wish that the pledges and their respective fraternity brothers continue their good work in making fratemity life the es- sential part of college life at Union that it has always been.

Noted Tenor EmbeiUshes Glee Chub Relinquishing his previous reti- cence, Otto Reisig, noted tenor, has agreed to be billed with the College Glee Club, his press agent announ- ced today. Refl sing a direct inter- view with Mr. Reisig, who is re- hearsing for his engagements, his press agent released the statement that the \Baron\ has returned from his retirement to assist Dr. Tidmarsh and his organization through a particularly difficult sea- son. In professional circles Mr. Reisig, renouned star of stage and screen. is noted for his tour of the New England coast several years ago which included a command per- formance in the Victoria Hotel in New London, Conn. Billed on this program was Mr. Reisig's famous interpretation of \Adagio Supreme\ an exotic, oriental dance depicting a chinese man-servant who is in- fatuated with a dazzling princess. Driven by jealousy, the servant at- tempts to drown a prince who is flirting with the princess by swamping him with a tray loaded with food. This maneuver is grace- fully executed, but the attempt fails. Mr. Reisig, or rather the ser- vant he is portraying, is instantane- ously decapitated by the infuriated prince. Following this performance M-r. Reisig was removed from the hotel under a police guard. With the release the press agent included a photograph of Mr. Rei- sig, but is unsuitable for publica- tion. · FOUR BARBERS.

Once a college extra- curricular activity is suspended, it is almost next to impossible to start it going again. Charles i.\Iale, who has been in charge of the band since 1916, is willing to begin the band again as soon as he is satisfied that it can exist. Professor l\Iale has given unstintingly of his time in the past and the band recitals under his direction in the past have always been looked forward to. Far-sighted American leaders asked the Congress of the United States many months ago to provide adequate provisions for the period of temporary reconversion which must follow the cessation of hostil- ities. The bill which was passed. sponsored by Senator George was not then, and is not now, at all sufficient to .allay the just fears of any workers; it is a patched quilt- work of halfway, and half-hearted measures. THE GAZETTE PRESS The Union College Band has folded up ap- parently due to lack of membership. As far as we are able to determine, a number of freshmen had indicated their desire to play in the College Band but their fai,lure to show up at rehearsals necessitated its discontinu- ance. It seems that Union has a .considerable record among- college bands which we \Viii lose unless the band is rebuilt before the middle of the term. A nucleus with which to continue and to keep the band alive is at hand among the older members of the band who get together by themselves in the hopes of the existance of their band. To these men, we say that it is an excellent example of col- lege spirit and they are to be highly com- Since the continuance of the Band seems to be so very dependent upon the Freshmen, may we be allowed to urg-e all Freshmen who play musical instruments to meet this Wed- nesday evening in the Band Room of Wash- bul'n Hall in a large enough group so that there will be no doubt as to the further ac- tivity of the Band. Extra-curricular activity is a highly valuable aid and part of college life. So, come on, Frosh, do yom· stuff and let it not be said that the Band was discon- tinued partly because of your lack of interest.

He began swimming in junior hig,h school' at Norwich New York. After competing for honors i,n the ct·awl stroke, his fancy turned toward swimming under water. His success in the tank is Pvidenced by the position as Hfe gua1·d which he held for two yeat·s in a Boy Scout camp at Camp Spaulding in Smithville, New York. Here Marsters was a counselor and member of the staff and was elect- ed to an honorary camp society. Jj,m also served for a year at Camp Kiwanescha in Warner, Pa. ,Jim Lparns FPncing Marsters began high school in Wt'ight Oral School, a private school in New York. Jim used to box but began to devote more and more of his lime to fencing. \I thought at first it was just a sissy sport,\ t·eminisced the present Mel Hein thrilled the as-' sembled student body i,n Old Chapel' last Wednesday with a lecture on' footbal1 and also a fine film, called: \Thrills of 1943.\ Mel explained the T fot·mation before the film and explained its liner points. The N. Y. Giant star indicated: the trouble that Steve Owen had, with the powerful Chicago Beari outfit when the Chicago Bears adopted the new T formation. The, Bears Wel'e the first to bring this' quiclt opening formation into the pl'Ofessi0nal game and it is dis-, ,placing the Navy single wing back: formation and the Notre Dame box formation aH over the country. Meli stated, however, that the T wasi no better than any othet· forma-! lion unless the men involved were, better players. The Bem·'s Sid Luck- man for instance, was an ideal T, man-a good ball handler and passer as is essential for the up, man in the backfield. The Giants tried a live man line as a defense against the Chicagoans which kept three men backing up. The line which was spread, as a re- sult, was ideal for the angled bt·ush blocl's of the Bears but the secondary was designed to keep gains down to a two or three yard maximum. Mel then went on to ex- plain the defence for the man-in motion which is an integt•al part of the T and which occurs in about 213 of the plays. The several line aJignments and the Notre Dame double wing and the single wing wet·e touched upon. Mel ran the projector ovet· the important sections of the film and indicated offensive and defensive BHI Johnson's Custodians suc- c\lmbed to the SAEE's in a riotous play -ti-ll you're exhausted softball game. The score was almost un- believable with the SA's on top 20-10. No brew was a.t stake but a good time was had by aH. The Johnson bolters were held scoreless by the SA pitching staff for seven full innings but recov- ered in Urne to clip ten runs in the last three frames. \Lover\ Joe Hinchey contributed to this by al- lcwing a Custodian hit to drop over his head for extra bases. The outstanding fielders for the Joltet'S were Ross Capra and Joe Pollack. Centerfielder Joe, however, stood out in the wrong way, Con- fusion seemed to be the keynote as Pollack scurried about the field on his sturdy legs, making mag- nificent leaps that brought down' nothing &t a.ll.

New Ckange of Rules Ties Not Played Off Because of the two tie games in the Navy league, Intramural 'di- rector Mel Hein has ruled as fol- lows: right, to scere 2 runs and push the B-1 squad into the lead. In the top half of the third, 3 C-1 singles com- bined with a walk and Leu 'Zan· garis' error enabled the Brewers to shue into a 3-2 lead. The next 3 innings was a pitchers battle with not one ball being hit into the outer gardens by either team. In t:he bot- tom half of the sixth with the score 3-2 against them the Bees loaded the bases with only one out. Wil- liams again singled to right to score one run and tie up the ball game. C-1 then steadied down and left the bases full of Bees to enter the last inning. Both teams went scoreless in the last frame and the game was called on account of darkness. Fischer was best at bat for the Brewers garnering 2 for 3 while Jensen shone in the field. Wente and Williams sparked the Bees with 2 for 3 apiece. The second OG victory of the week was racked up when the freshman defeated the Off Campus men 8-3. Ingraham opened up the scoring for Old Gym with a re- sounding homer to right center. The next two men walked and then Clark stepped up and duplicated Ingraham's trick with a 4 basP wallop to right. In the second inning 2 walks, 2 singles and 2 errors pushed 3 more OG's across the plate with a 7-0 lead. Off Campus countered in their half of the fifth inning when several OG el'l'ors enabled them to tally 3 counters. Ingraham's horner and 2 singles, Dorseys 3 singles and Godfredos homer and double sparked the Old Gym team. mistakes as well as several illegal' ------------- All tie games will go into the rec- ords as suhc. No tie games will be replayed, once the game has been called it will go into the records as such. All batting, fielding and pitching records will be figured as usual. C-1, A-1, Tie In the second C-1 game their op- position, Art Schmidts A-1 squad, completely baffled the Brewers- for 3 innings. With Schmidt stt·ik- ing out 5 men in three inning·s ,and the fielders playing errorless ball the bottom deckers got off to an early 2-0 lead on 2 singles a walk and an error. In the fourth inning C-1 finally hit their stride and tot.ched Art for 3 singles in succes- sion to push across 2 runs and tie up the ball game. In the fifth in- ning the fireworl{S really started with the Brewers getting six suc- cessive bingles including 2 doubles to right center, to tally 4 big runs and coast to an easy victory. In the remaining 3 innings only one A-1 man could solve Fischers slants for a single. Ianella had a perfect day at bat for the winners -..vith 3 for 3 while Jarboe touched the A-1 hurler for 2 for 4. Kelly and Schmidt sparked the losers batting attack. Pitcher's Battle In the second feature of the Navy loop A-1 tripped B-2 by a score of 2-1. A walk and 2 errors enabled the A-1 boys to push across a run in the top half of the second inning, and take a shortlived lead. Lowell Browns long single to right drove in the tying run for the B company boys in the bottom half of the same inning. In the third inning A-1 again scored with what was to be the winning run. The remaining 5 innings was a pitchers battle between Art Schmidt and Lowell Brown with the former coming ov.t on top. Hickey was best for the winners while Brown sparked the losers. In two more games the B-2 boys made an about face to trim a win- less, hapless C-2 team 6-5 and trip Ross Spicers A-2 squad 6-4. In the former game Filipowski substituted for Brown on the B-2 mound and twirled against Dempster. B-2 got off to an early lead and coasted to victory despite the determined at- tempts of Art Caplins squad to close the g.ap. Against A-2 the B company boys were forced to come from behind to mark up their sec- ond victory of the year. Galvin sparked the winners while Spicer and Iccason were best for the van- quished. DU, strongest contenders for the OG leadership recovered from their early season defeat to win two more games this week and slide into second place. In their first game since Concordy last went to press the DU boys set a league record when they swamped Middle Section 20-8. In a game that was marked by many errors on both sides the freshman garnered 27 hits, another new loop record. At the top of the fifth inning the DU boys were behind 4-3 and playing miserable ball, but in this inning they touched the North College hurler for 14 bingles, six in a row and then 8 to push across 10 big runs. They followed this with 2 in the sixth and then added 5 more in the sevl'nth to completely Rew up the game. North Middle could get but 7 hits. Westland had 5 for 5 for the winners in- cluding 3 singles, a double and a homer. Portz also shown with 4 for 5. In the second DU game the Del- tas tripped the North South boys 8-5. As in the past their opponents got off to an early start with 2 runs in the first inning, but 6 singles in succession tallied 3 runs for the freshman and push them into the lead. The Southerners countered with 2 in the bottom half of the fourth but DU came through with 3 in the sixth and 2 in the seventh to notch their third victory of the season. Mod- lin, Portz and Hochuli had 3 for 4 for the winners. In the only remaining civilian game of the week Middle Section finally got into the win column with a 5-3 victory over Off Cam- pus. The Middlemen got off to an eai'ly lead. and were never headed. Numerous errors plagued both teams. The only remaining game in the civilian league, North South versus Off Campus was postponed. JAMES F. BURNS In the only remaining game of ·the week C-2 again hit the lost col- umn when they dropped a 1'0 to 4 decision to A-2. Spicers men got off to an early start and were never headed. Behind the master- ful twirling of Iccason the A-2 men played almost errorless ball afield.

It was one of the potent weapons necessary to drive the enemy back to Berlin. The shell's core is cemented tungsten carbide, improved by G-E reseat·ch and manufactured by the Carboloy Com- pany, G-E affiliate. It's a material second to diamonds in hardness- commonly used for the tips of cutting tools and wear-resistant dies. Pro- jectiles using this core weigh less than ordinary shells because of their light- weight aluminum housings, and so have higher velocity. They often stopped German Tigers with a single shot-at ranges up to 3000 yards. The core does the actual armor piercing. Because of the extreme hard- ness of the carbide, it doesn't flatten out on impact. Instead, it goes right on through the armor plate and then breaks up into lethal pieces inside the tank.
