Poot Bly attacked the present ad- ministration : by what he . termed the \degeneration\ of the American peo- ple and ~ts \lack of compassion.\ He said that .the whole country really despises Vietnam, '~but we want to think we're helping.\ Defy G()vemment Rodham Tul!Gss, a senior math major at 'Union, supported Ely's de- fense of the right of protest by quoting as effective . p()em by Wolf- g.allg Borscher which said, in essence, if the government orders you to do something against your will, \Say no!\ \U · ni · on English professor Bruet> Clements quoted an account of Caesar's i·nvasion · of Gaul in an art:- tempt to eompare Caesar's atJtitude towards the barbarian Gauls with our a:ttitude 'bo-\vards the Vietnamese.

Was Chief Strate9ist Working closely with Kennedy in the latter's 1960 presidential bid, Mr. Sorensen, a master of political strategy, helped create one of the most successful and effi.d-erut cam- paigns in Unit-ed States nistory. Once Kennedy was elected, SBren- sen dedicated himself to noa'king the Chief Executive remembered as oo.e of the greatest AmeTican Presidents. Next to the Presidernt, S·orerusen was the chief .political philoso.t>her, stra- tegist, and policy maker in the ad- minishatton. Sorensen was influential in deciding United Sta.tes involv€ment in the Berlin and Cuban crises. He hll>s been called by many ''the man behind President Kenne-dy's rocking ('hair.\ An excellent writer and speaker, M.r.

Manuscript Exchanges Commenting on the purpose orf The Idol, Mr. Abood stated that it is \fo·r the Union student, but not necessarily by the Union s'tudent.\ A pl'ogram in~ v.olv1ng the exchange of manuscripts between Union and oiher c0lleges is beoing ·considered a:s one w~y to increase the variety of The Idol. Also, Mr. Abood said that he saw no reason why professors could not contribute to The Idol and there- by increase its range of materia<!. Another role of 'fhe Idol, Mr. Abood said, is as a \supplement to U1llion''s conve>c·ation system.\ This spring, The Idol is publishing a poaperbaclc edition of a taped interview conducted wi·th Glenway Westcott. The book contains a foreword by the Idol eddtors, and an afterword by its faculty sponsor, Mr. F1~nk Gado. Garnet Plans Jack Stokvi's, the editor of the 1967 Garnet, plans to make that publication \ a full year event, rwt just a spring time bust.\ Guy Lescault will be the bus.ines·s manager •and Jim Rubenstein the associate editor. There are still other positions which have not yet been ii:lled. According to Jack Stokvis, the 1967 Garnet wiU corutain some color picturoo.. He hope'S to make the yearbook more repr.esentative ·of the whole oompus life arud will try to keep it \away from the party kick.\ The 1967 Garnet will have the stanoord format of 9 .by 12, but \there will be several speciats and different etfec<ts along with a general improvement of the whole yearbook.\ The new editor will try to get the Garnet on school-wide basis like WRUC and the Con- cordiensis. It i:s hoped that meetings can be held on a regular twice a month basis throughout the :full school year in the Concordiensis office. There is still a need fol' s.taft' members and any.one interested is requested to leave his name with Jack Stokvis who promises that \tthere will he a. lm of fun, <lo.lor, an<l imagination\ in store.

4 Mountebanks Enliven Unexciting Plays Pictured above are scenes from the Mountebanks productions of Sartre 's NO EXHlT and W. B. Yeats' PURGA10RY.

'This play, which as presented La&t night lasted fifteen mifliUtes, ha,s enough potential material for a thr-ee act play. The supernatural element and the father-son relationships were far too sketchily drawn. The~•e were glimmer- ings of possible real drama, but none rof the themes were at all develo!ped.

Translated by Mario Pei in The Ct>l· umbia Unive1·sity Forum Friday, May 6, 1966 Jazz: Three Musical Greats Rock The Big Piano By Cliffol'd Safa.ne From Dixieland to the latest aVlant garde, the piano has usually been an impor!Jant IJart of the jazz combo. Mo-st of the time, the pianist's function has heen to help the drummer and bassist 'keep the beat. It was also his job to stimulate the 'soloists by playing t>hords while the other membet·~ c.rf the band were pbying. C~rlain pian·ists surh as Art Tatum, Bud Powell, and Erroll Gamer, how- evet·, haYe changed the role of their instrument. They made the piano into the arcepbble solo imh1.11nent whirh it is today. Art Tatum is completely unrntng-ol'izahle. Although he alrno·st exclusively .played during the swing era, he ('()Uld play anything from boogie woogie to bop. He could ·shift tempo~, change :keys, and juggle several musical figures simultanenusly with the greatest of eflse. Tatum wu~ so great that most musicians considered him to be in a cla:ss by himself. For this reason, there is no precise \Tatum school of piano playing.\ \Moon glow\ There are so many good examples of Tatum's playing th:at it is extremely hard to pick any one selection or a1bum to be repl'esen- tatiYe o·f his work. \Moonglow from the album Still More of the Greatest Piano of Them All (Verse 8360), however, is one of the better selections that I helieve Tatum has recorded. Tatum's tech- nical abiliiies are so overwhelmingly evident on thts track that the Hstener is completely awed. He plays arpeggios at a blinding speed that ruost pianists would shy away from. Tatum takes the tune and shapes and reshapes the melody until it practically becomes a new piece. And no matter what the pianist does to the tune, it always swings. One pianist to fall under Tatum's influence was Bud Powell. Yet th~s pianist was just no mere imitator of Tatum. He in turn wa:s one of the major innovators during the late 40's and early 50's. Ju_s.t as Charlie Parker and Dizzy Gillespie created the bop style of :playing for the alto sax and trumpet respectively, Powell did the sam.e for the piano. Powell's pianistic ·style was very muscular. He was ·capable O!f creating dazzling and daring single noted lines wh1ch many times contained the element of surprise. A good example of his work can be fC>und on the album Jazz at Massey Hall (Fantasy 6003). Erroll Garner Although not as an influential player as Powell, Erroll G-arner can still be considered an excellent pianist. Unlike many of our con- temporary pianists who sound alike, Garner has quite an individualis- tic style. His use .o.f the tremolo and the four-beat left-hand <>ffset are two of his more famous pianistic charaeteristics. Probably Garner's best album is Concert by the Sea (Col11mbia 883) which was recorded at a 1955 concert in Carmel, California. Although Gamer plays very well throughout the entire coneert, there a·re certain tunes which stand ourt from the resrt. \Autunm Le.aves,\ a popular tune that has been .played intC> the ground, is transf<Jrmed into an impt·essionistic v.~ork of art; \Where or When\ beco·mes a ::>eries of well constructed improvisations played at a bli'Ilding tempo and i\s highlighted by single nOited lines which seem \to be pulled from the piano by brute :force.\ Art Tatum, Bud Powell, and Erroll Garner are three great pian- ists. Collectively, their influence can strongly be seen during the late 50's and 60'·s. Most pialliists have encorporated some aspects of these pianists' styles in their playing. It would be a great tribute to these three musician·s ii in the late 60's and 70's future jazz musicians obtained some of thedr in:spiration from these men. They wo11ld be doing themselves a favo-r too. ~1··~:@~!Z~;t®~~\'tllli:t~~W~~~~W:f.~-$}ffiW~J«~~i'&1&t~~i~f.li~~t:~it®fM*R®iW::\k%&W:ill~V:OO~~--~k~f.!J~~j}~~~m::~~(!&\tmJ~&mmk\li&Mm&i!ffli!M&\llW~ifmmi~-e&~lil~~-:[~By Eric Cohen Illanchild in the Promised Land is a moving, tt-vubled book. It deals with the problems of grow- irrg up i•n the terrible New York slum, Harlem, and v.ith the pain!ul p1·ocess of eleated a civiliza- ti<>Il in what is little more than a jungle. For Claude Drown, Harlem was home. It did not matter to him that it is filled with prostitute>; and jungles, complaining alcoholics and brutal killers. After all, he knew no othet• life, and, he too, tumed to the ~trect,. ln the early pages of h.is book, he presents the grO\vth 0f a manch'ild, 1\-ise and pwcoC'ious in the m·t of survival. He 1lepirts the people about him Ln vivid terms, and tells a story of parents living within the morality impoarted upon them by a world which their chil- rt.ren are rebelling against: of girls selling their llodies fo1· an hour of dopC'. of youngsters resort- ing- to violencc tn ju,;tify their own existence to t 'hern~<'lves. Anger Accomplishes Nothing Running through thr book is a central theme: that one cannnt achie·ve anything withln the code nf Harlem. Pa.ge after pa;ge is filled with the failures of t hoi'e who have tried: A petty thief tul\lled dope arldict, u \nice\ girl turned oallous p1nstitute, and a pr·i.ze fighter turned homosexual. F(}r Brown, anger, h~ti·ed, and fear accomplished nothing. But to sucC'eed, one had to rise above himself and adopt the more's (}f the world that had created the p;het to. There is no rebellion in fkown's wri.ting. All of this would be quite banal if told on the conventional protest fas·hion. The Nebro-boy- rnakes-good-in-white--world is n(}t a new theme to 111odem literature, nor is .the study of a ghebto. What is refreshing-ly different about this book is its colorful, eareful tenninology, and its eomplete laek of conde;;renti-on, nr moralizing. Brown does n()t resort to polemics, violence or sh(}ck in his Let the lager freely flow. Down to Louis\ .let us go, approach to the Ne~t-o ghetto. He shows no frulse pity for those left ·im the slums, nor any hatred for those outside it. lHi\s language is tempered by love: for Hal'iem, ihe people in it, and even the gociety beyond the gutter. He even finds, and re- flects, humor in the pitiful life of the depraved minions o.f the eity .. New Sen.se ofComprehension The object of Br()\Fn's efl'lll't is to gi\•e the read- er a new sense of ide-ntity and comprehension of a life he has never kn01vn. However, the speech of his twelve yea.1· old self i·s too literate, too remin- iscent of the authm benind the book; it gives an air of the suc<\e;tJs story that detract~ from a book of this sort. Still, tnis amounts to a relatively minor fault, and Dllc> \vhirh in no way spoil\ the flow of the work • • * * The Autobiograph::y <Jf Jlalcolm X i·s an entit·eiy diffe-rent treatm~nt. '!'he main character, here, ex- re-rienced many ()f .the same problems as did Claude Brown, but a.fl'ected him in a different fashion. While B1•mv-n became an author who rhos-e to live in tlu society which was responsible for the conditions of :his early life, Malcolm X. decided instead to attenpt to destroy that society .. The Autobiog-ra.ph!y clearly brings out this differ- ence. D~!Jeneralion As a youngster, Malwhn X (nee Little) strove to overcome th.·e di.sabili'ties of his race by out- standing academic success.

While in prison, Malcolm X became a member of the radical Black Muslim creed, and developed the conviction that it was his duty to help them overcome his peoples' restraints, thrcrugh the means of Isl•am. The result is a great bo(}k. In it, one \IYllay read ~he ~ng~: of an entire people in their search for Identtty, and the pnwer and poassion o·f the tor- mented semi of a criminal turned saint. \The reader must put aside any prejudice he may have about a book 'as told ro' someone. You ean hear and feel Malcolm X in this book; it is an excellent job of transcripti·on.\ Certain Flows Yet, several flaws ma1· the Autobiography's ef- fect. Although Malcolm writes about the Muslim philosophy, he does not really discuss the reasons for his conversion. Malcolm's major message to his peaple is that no Negro is alone when he thinks in terms of action with others -of hi·s race el'sewhere in the world; this fails to- s.trike as sharply as it should. And, while Malcolm X talks often. of hi·s soul and his anger, he seldom sheds any real Hght on his inner being. His role as a political leader were not analyzed, no-r the motiva- ti·Dns that drove him. But despite all this, the honesty, paS!sion, and even flaws of the wo·rk serve all the mo-re to ilium· inate Malcolm X. ART EXHIBIT A group of 12 paintings of Onofrio Vitiello, contemporary Italian artist and winner of many art exhibitions in Italy, will be exhibited in the Mechanical Engineering .Conference room on the main floor of Carnegie Hall all day Friday and Saturday _an~ Sunday from 10:00 f\..M. to 12:00 P.M. during Parents Week- end. Each pamtmg comes complete Wlth frame and documentation. The follow- ing are commentaries from the art editors of the Albany Times Union and the Schenectady Gazette: \Vitiello paints landsr:apes and still-lifes in dark heavy shades through which bright bursts of color capture the eye. A thorough-going impressionist, his images appear warm, intense, and almost fluid. One expects some glis· tcning scenes to slide down the canvas, as they appear so wet, fresh, and spontaneous. His florals are thick and lush and rococo.\ \The later works, primarily landscapes, reveal a strong and original use of color, line and composition.

If , ,vu arc familial' with the · 'J'imes' education covet'age you know that reports of similal'ly significant events at the seven :nsters and the ivy .schu·ols t~uze upon its pages with re- lentless regularity. The revertlll puLlication on '4:Yrd Street, however, would ·'quiver at the suggestion of de- voting a column to s.o gauche an occurence as Parents' We·ek- end at Union. Parents of Union n1en .shouldn't feel slighted by · this unaffecti·onate tl.'eatment, hut they should come to the un- avoidable realization .that their &ons are revolving in an orbit a wee bit removed from that of the ivy lea-gue. \Old Gray Lady\ This is not to say that Union • i::; a poor school.

Delirious Daddy There is an outside, if not outlandish, chance that Union may gain wider favor in the near tutute, and possibly even be·come the Hu.la Hoop of the mid-sixties. Our hopes were heightened this week when Mount Holyoke received a spread on its Delerious Daddy weekend. The frustNt:ted Smith- ies, despite tll.•eir muErt;y ball gowns and Cl>nventional, mid- dle of the road. shoulder length hair, were .aff<>rded a big pic- •ture on the f.asbion page. Also this week, Hobart Col- lege, o.ne of Union's traditicmal rivals on the athletic field, charged in·to the hcllowed ground of the seco-11d section's first page with an a1-tide about studerut agill;ati<()n for more per- m1ssive social rules.

Nevertheless, we are gaining ground all the time. Read-in at Harvard J·ust the otheT day there was ·· lengthy al't kle on pnge four of .that venerable publication all about a poetry read-in on Vietnam which Union was spunsol'ill'g. The headline wa::; \Re:ul-ln For l'eace Held at Harval'd.\ The Times ca1mot he expected tu change its policy tvo qui~kly, but the article <lid represenc a landmark of edi- torial radicalism, despite the stodgey stand-patters at the headJ.ine desk.

Th~ Albany Symphony Orchestra, led by Edgar Curtis and backed by the Union and Marymount glee clubs and soloists, gives an inspired rendition of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony in the Chapel. Mother's Day Riot There are a f.ew unlikely ·paths which we may f~llow to achieve the reco-gnition of the Times. We could hire some professional \hard oore\ stu- ·dents to cook 'something up a la Berkely. We could import a few giTls from Sarah Law- Tence to hang :around outsLde ElectrLcal Engineering, ready to trap a hapless phortogvapher. We could dress up Parents' Weekend, making i•t inrto .a \Merry Mommy\ weel~end, and . staging oUT annual MOitlher's Day riot as a cmwning touch on Sunday evening. By Charles Fenimore This Tuesday, The Albany Symphony, directed by Edgar Curtis, gave ~ts last concert O<f the sea- son, together with the Marymount and Uruon Col- lege Glee Clubs. The major work was Beethoven's Ninth Symphony. It is, of course, a monum~mtal composition making great demands on the sing- ers., players-, and oonduct()r. Cevtamly aU were up to the challenge at this concert yet it is O<ften tbe cast tha.t the Albany Symphony requires a move- ment or tw() to warm up. It is unf()rtunate that in a C().ffip()sibion .of such unity and magnitude as the Ninth Symphony that this sh.oul{]. happen. But in this performance the first movement especially was plagued by problems of dynamic balance, iln- precise entTances, and at times, just wrong not-es. Yet while th~s was the ca'Se in the first and to a certain extent the second movements, the l~st two were played with clarity, precision, and great feel- ing and unodel'Standing. Turkish march was unabashedly funmy, a real gem. The members of the \band\ did everything needed but strut around the stage. The solo quartet did a very 'Aron·derful job. The soprano; Claudia Lindsey, and alto, Anne Graff both have magnificent voices. M·iss Lindsey projected well and sang witll great beauty. The baritone, Mar- vin Hayes, has a rich and full voice, and sings with the sincerity ()l a gospel singer. The choir rnakhed the other sections with fine singing. The g-lee clubs exhibited the clarity and be·auty of tone which has marked each of their performance's this year. Mr. Curtis achieved a very fine balance between chorus, soloists, and orchestra . High C's Warm and Tender All these ideas have their merits, but the best solllltion would probably be to diTect the admissions depavtment to begin ~ccepting as many stu- dents as possi:b1e with Ithe names Ocbs -or Sulzberger. Until then, if any of yoou par- entbs know someone at the Times, let him know what am \in\ •tiliing Parents' W•eekend was !!It Union. In the tTemendously W'arm and tender Adagio the orohestra seemed for the first time to elimi- nate the technical problems and to lose itself in the music. The ·st11ing'S and woodwinds were es- pecially fine; they played with beauty and sim- pHoity. In the Finale the orchestra, soloists, and ehoh again captured the ·spirit of the movement. The The Beethoven was preceded on the program by Bruckner's Te Deurn Laudamus. The Mary- mount GLee Club had to do a certain amount of shouting to get to high C's and, at times, had a hard tone. Th.e Union group distinguished itself here even more than in Beethoven. This performance was Curtis' fayewell to con- ducting the Albany Symp-hO<ny. Next year he will direct a smalle1• Philharmon:i!a. The success of this C(}ncert hopefully will convince the Glee Club and the Phil:harmonia to :put on at least one joint per- f(}rmance ne:xt yeu·.

During their stay, they will see great changes in the physical plant of the college. But we hope that the changed attitude of the students, a change of far more importance to the college than the ad- dition of several new stuccoed walls, will also gain their notice. During the last three or four years, and especially in the two years which have seen the arrival of Dean Lock- wood and President Martin, the apathy and generalized indifference which characterized the typical student have been eroding. The student ferment which led to the new social rules and the creation of the All-College Council bear witness tu this. The anti-Vietnam activity and the reaction to the gym requirements, whether we agree with them or not, are hopeful signs of interest and concern. These are concrete signs of an intangible thing. But this spirit is the most valuable acquisition an institution of learning, and learning in the broadest possible sense, can have. It is encouraging to watch its development. Faculty: Act I The members of the Faculty will meet nex:t Thursday. At that time they will decide which students will graduate from Union College this year. Normally, it is a mere for- mality: they are handed a list and it is approved. But this year it will not be just the formality. Daniel McLister's name will not be on that list. The CONCORD- IENSIS calls upon the facu1ty to add Mr. McLister's name to the role of those who will be granted degrees this June. The arguments for and against this are reported in last week's issue and they are reviewed in the letters to the right. It seems clear that, at the root of this compli- cated controversy, is a case of injustice: a married man, due to a combination of ignorance, misinformation., acci- dent and poor communication is being deJlrived of the dipl~ma fer which he has completed all his academic re- quirements. We hope that the strict legalities which would normally make McLister's graduation impossible will be set aside in light of these irregular conditions. But beyond this individual case, we feel that the in- adequacies of the present system have been clearly drama-. tized. Thus, despite the fact that a study has just recently been completed, the CONCORDIENSIS calls upon tbe fac- ulty to form a new committee of both students and faculty to investigate, publicly, the alternatives to the present pro- gram. Perhaps, it could be organized under the auspices of the All-College CounciL But, at present, the faculty should right malfunctioning of various administrative bodies and allow this student to graduate with his class- mates. Sterility in Vietnatn It is ironic that before riots and insurrection destroyed the hold of the Ky government in South Vietnam, the State Department held that there was too much unrest for elec- tions in that unfortunate country. But U()W, apparently, there is sufficient peace for those very elections! This is only the most blatant of a long run of ironies the government would foist on us. In a blind fit of anti- communism, they have totally lost sight of the basic prem- ise on which this country was founded, namely the right of self-determination. In a mad attempt to halt a move- ment based on the inadequacies of the American-supported government in Saigon, Washington has poured hundreds of thousands of troops into the country, while postponing indefinitely the only thing that might possibly make our position there tenable: massive economic aid. Until Americans realize that our basic interest lies with the economic well-being of the underdeveloped parts of the globe, rather than a policy of sterile and negative anti-communism, we cannot hope to be successful in aid- ing the rest of the world to a better life. We hope that those individuals who determine this country's foreign policy recognize this basic fact of international relations before it is too late. Friday, May 6, 1966 Letters To The Editor Mclister Speaks Up To the Editor: My po.sition, \the fll:l.Cts\ M! I know them ·are as follows: I entered Union as a Special Student, Spring Semester, 1961. I had not been at .thart: time notified of any Physical Educa- tional requirements. A.fter an absence of tW'O years, I re- turned to Union in the Fall of 1963, as innocent of the P.E. requirements as .before. At thwt time I knew only that there was a ge'lleNl compl·aint eir- cukuting as to the ad<l1tion of one more year to that depart- me·nt's demands. t took little part il1 'bh·e dis- cussi-<>ns circul81ting around the valid~ty of that department's program. I was twenty•(}ne years old at the time. I was planning a summer marriage. I W.':IIS planning to graduwte f1·om night school. 1 was in no way rebel'ling. I was in no way \goofing off.\ My friends and my advhsors told me <that e\T'OO. one of the above was enough bo exempt me from >the Nquire- ments .of the P.E. departmerut. I was married. I l.\eceived permisison to attend and grad- uate fr'Om ndght school; I was happy. Last Spt•ing, about a year ago this time, I received a nOibe from Professo·r Ketz as to the fact that I was deficient in my P.E. requirements. I knew he must be mistaken, and .':ligain, thought li!ttle of it, so liut1e in fact, tlrat I made the unforgiv- able mistake 'Of forgetting all about it. Last summer, and with the consent of my ll!dvisor and tlhe head of my departm:en!t, I .at- tended the University of Col- orado. This Wl)uld enable me to obtain the neces·s•ary cr·edirt hours so as ~o insuTe my grad- ua-tion from night !'1rhoo1. In July I received ·a letter from Professor Ketz stating that I would be unable 1io gred- ua:te. I wws quite honestly ·ta.k€'!1 abaek. I wrote 1Jo h1m of my position. He inf.ormed me thrut I o>Ved three years to his de- partment and thwt the cut-off age for adults ils t¥,renty-five. To this point if you 'f1l\e the kind of person who regulates his life by logic, and believes that this world is a resoMble and rational ()lie, theJ1 Y'ou may certainly .accuse me of illogic, unreason:ablenes.s, an-d itTation- ality. Myself, I wa:s hm.oeent, naive, and SJtupid-I 1JoO'k the word of my advisOTS and fellow students; and was wrong. Personal Meeting My first personal meeting with Professor Ketz W'as in early September, las.t year. He admitted everything mighrt have been different if I wertl twenty-five instead <>f tweiJJty. three. He sarld he was sorry about the practical wli!Site in- curred by my summer studies, but that I was a fully ma- triculated student and could not g11aduate from night SC!hool. I would lllot be able to work this semestoc as I had plan:ned. It was a shame\ I was to attend Phy!Sical Ed- ucation Instruction four days a week. I was not to graduate with my class in Jun·e. I was to return this summ,er to make- up the final ye·ar. I passed Physical EduCiati<m last semester. On January 25, over the holi- days, I sustained a knee injury while skiing. I spoke with Pro- fessor Ketz. He hoped thM it would quickly heal, for all the while I was getting fu;rbher and furthel' behind. I asked to be excuS€d f.or medical reasons fram the three weeks attend- ·ance I had missed. No, thetoe wws nothing I could do about it. I took my case to Dean Lock- wood. He was sympaJtheic. He- would bring it before the <Jo.m- mittee on Student S~andings. In the mean time he directed Professor Ketz to :allow me some credit for the dumllbion of my convalesce~ce. The knee injury tul't1ed out mOO'e serious than expected, and the G(}cior said I would need an operrution. I wrote to Professor Ketz, explaining <the need for the opeTllltion and out- lining at the same time a plan by whi·ch I could, despite 'bh.is operation, finish my requhe- merrts this semesrter. It e111tailed P.E. six times a week I W(}Uld alS'o stay during Spring Break. It could not be done. The firSit reason was \moth·ational\· that the students were to b~ \conditioned\ by three yeaxs of P.E. But then Professor Ketz tol<l me I was beyond \eondi- tiO'ning.\ Secondly, this W()Uld be .setting U·p a dangerous precedent. But I was twe:nJty .. three, married, expecting a fami.ly-and I had :been C{)m- pletely innocent of 'bhe require- ments. Too bad. Third, I was a bad r~sk. Proba·bly true, but my .attendences rested entirely upon myself. In the meantime my peltition had ·been turned down by the Committee on Standings. No explauation. Hospitalization I entered the hospital. The operation was of a truly serious natUTe. I would be in a cast until mid-May, my leg, and for a go(}d pa11t of the time, my- self, immobile. I was visited h1 the hoopital by a professor. He asl{ed about my P .E. I told him I had wbout given up. H€ said \NO but that he personally would carry my case to D~an Lockwood. He did. He ·told me not to worry, to write a second petition , .• that despite its faults, this sehoal is at least run w~bh jus- tice; that rul-es must be de- signed with a cet·tain amount of flexiJb:iUty. Des·pite the aS~Surances .of th1s professor, a:nd my domor~s letter, my second petition was tuTned down by the com.mitbee ; last week • . . no o0'll11Ille:nt. I saw Professor Ketz He was going to help me out; I would only need stay for tweruty-eigh.t days after graduation. Durirng that period I was rt;o oom:pl,ete, against my doctor's recom- mendations, a program whicih had been turned down ·as im- possible when spread over :a year, or even ove~· four moruths. The newspaper interviewed me. I was bitter, I was dis- illusioned. I spoke to my friends, and one of them sug- gested a petition - in l~Sit re- ISU1t ta appeal to my fellow students. I agreed. Tuesday night a student stood up in the I.F.C. me€'bi.ng, slandered my reputa<tiu.n, lll.Y name; he .stood and urbteT\ed M! truths rumors which upon his own investigati()n proved lies. Thls is ifue oOUJtlirne of my story.' I have no doubt but thalt ~~J.re obher outlines; it 1s very difficult to be obje~tive when you are S'O completely involved. But you must g{) elsewhere for these O'ther outld·nes. Daniel F. McLister Partial Apologia To the Editor: On Tuesday night MIRy 3, 1.966, I appea1·ed before tihe In- ter-Fraternity Council ~ .an at• terested student regarding the controveil'S~ ~ver Damel M.c- Lister'·s case.

Mr. McLister had acquired substantially more then the three attendamces I credited him with, Tuesdiay night. However, I do wish to re- emphasi7ie that my purpose in appeaTing before the Inter- Fraternity Coun-cil was in no way meaillt to detract fl\'lll Mr. McLi.ster's p(}Siftion.

'l'he establishmoo.t (very small \e .several points should ·be made clear to the College campus. The reason thrut a }leti'bi()n wa'S circula-ted on Dav.'s mhrul:f was simply that many Sltudents felt that an in,j'llstice 11·ad oc· curred and that the College's adminisil'altive machinery !had malfunctioll'ed. Since tthere were no meams ·of .appeal left frpem. to Dan, we decided tJhrut :a stu- dent petition might induce 1Jhe Administration to rec():nSJide;r their dedsion. But a much ffil()re fundamemtal question hMl also been raised: W'hether Mcl!iJster deserves his degree or nDJt, our student body is toiJally subje-ct ta the whim of Mr. Ketz and his department. The important geneNl prin- ciple at $ake here roncemJll the rather unrestricted tech- niques available to Mr. Ketz ion deciding who will, O'r wm noct graduat€.

Inflexibility Pers[}nal beliefs C(}ncerning the advisability of phy,sical con- ditioning are secondary to the more important idea -of clarify- ing the importance of suc·h a program as an inflexible facet of ·CoHege life. It seems obvi- ous that bhere is a fundame·ntal diffeTence between a man com- pleting his· maj.o.T requirements and finishing all of his P.E. dasses. I realize that a studoerut may appeal the Phy.sical education (.small \e\) De>pa1~tment's de- ciecis1ons, but more tihan the e::1eamination ,of •specific cases is needed. The faculty, which has the ubtimate decisio.n in su::h matters, should re-examine a code of rules which has no huHt-in clauses dealing with 'special oases.

Braff, '66 Oppositional Stance To the Editor: Never have I re:ad a ne'WIS- paper a.rticle which h.':lis more deverly twisted the facts. then the one titled \Student Ketzed\ in last week's Conco:rdiensis. That article and the editorial in Lhe s·ame issue imply that Mr. Daniel McLister ha:s been un- :airly t1·eated ft•om start to fin- Ish. As one who has read the ~orrespondence between Mr. Me- Lister and Mr. Ketz I can aso- mre you that Mr. Ketz has bert:t >Yer backwards in allowing Mr. .'vlcLister to satisfy the Col- ege's physical education re- jUhement. In fact it is hard .:or me to undet•stand how Mr. '(etz could be so patient w:ith a 3tudent who has shown by his :~ctions that he intends to ig- :\ore one of the College's regu- latiom and get away with it. Simple Arithmetic The article's statement that the physical education require- ment had been increased from two years to three during Mr. McListet•'s ·absence from school is true, hut it is also true that the number of hours per week were simultaneously reduced from three to two, Simple arith- metic shows that the require- ment had merely been spread: out and not increased. In any case it was Mr. McLister's re- spon:sibility, w:ith help from his faculty adviser, to read the CoJ.- lege catalog and to detennine his graduation requirements. Of course the crucial question in Mr. McLister's case is, \What did he do to make up h:is defic- iency between the time o1' noti- fi·cation early in the spring of 1965 and the time of his skiing accident last winter?\ The an- swer is, nothing. (Incidentally, one is led to wonder whether Mr. McLister would have suf- fered his accident if he had been \in condition.\) A Bind A comment is in order co-n- cerning the implication that the College does not accept Mr. Me- Lister's medical excuse. A stu- dent L; allowed credit for physi- cal education classes mi:ssed for medical reasons, but only at the normal rate of two per week. It is too bad that Mr. McLisber has put himself in a bind by his earlier inaction but, judg1ng the case \upon its individual mer- its\ as the editorial urges, it seem's that Mr. McLister is get- ting exa0tly what he asked for. \Coercion\ In last week's editorial you are quick to condemn the ele- ment of coercion in the physi- cal edu0ation program. Unfortunately, experience ha>s shown that the members of any s·ociety must be \forced\ to comply with a list of require- ments and pr(}hibitions. When a student arrives at Union College he finds. that he i's \fo·rced\ to Cont. Pg. 7, Col. 3 Picture of Perfection DEANSGATE is the greatest natural shoulder in America. And much more, too.

After managing ortly one hit iu his first thirteen at-bats, the center fielder h~ been producing at the plate and already has brok- en a 1In1on Tecord with fou1· stolen bases in one game. Once approached \very info1•mally\ .by the Minnesota Twins, Williams has strong opinio-ns about our team and Union sports in general, opin- ions which are only .partially modifi-ed by a ready laugh and the fact that he is not fmm dogmatic Baltimore. Concentration Factor The obvious que-stion to ask him was why the team had looked so poor aganst Pratt and Middle- bury and yet had come on so well since then, the loss to Hobart notwithstanding. Williams men- tions several factors. \I'd attri-bute our initial failures to a lack of experience, not only with the sophomores but also the veteran'S, since we did not have a &pring trip.\ But we must no-t, he cautions, over-simplify the problem. \Men con- centration\ is crncial in a slow game like base- ball. Thus he was caught napping in the Norwich game and thr,own out when he did not keep alert on the front end of a double steal. \The game wa.s lagging; it was getting kind of bo-ring.\ But m(}st imp(}ltant ts for the team to have confidence in itself. As attested to by one of his ruickn-ames, \Ego this is one quality Jim Williams does not lack. \To succeed in any sp(}rt you have got to have c(}nfi<dence. In my pel'sonal case I have car- ried this over into my social life. In Union to-o many athlete's carry nice guy attitudes (}nto the sports field. This could be a rea-son why we don't have consi<~tenrtly winning sports teams.\ Big Time Just what does he think of the baseball team at present? \Our pitching is adequate. We have two stoppers in Bill Neidel and Bob Hallenbeck, and Charlie Cre·sswell and Gene Hoerning both have proved they can win games for us.\ As for the hitting, Williams is opti:mistic. \Ostensibly it a[)pears that we need hitting, I would like to re- fute that!' Bernie Mulli-gan, Bill Toth, Greg 01- S(}n, Bob McAdams, and Larry MacDonald are all, he feels, .300 hitters, while Dave Hourigan is an \amazing leadoff hitter\ and Ken Mercllant has looked good. The defensive p-loay ha:s been diSiap- pointing so far, but all in all \Union College is definitely not small college baseball. I think we could play against so-called big time schools and d()< quite well.\ 'While drawing eonclusitms frmn comparing s<lores is haz.ardous, J·im poiruts out tha.t Rochester, whom we beat 3-2, has defeated both Princeton and Cornell this year.

Following the Kings Point game, the Garnet ta.kle a two day Toad trip that takes them to Drew on Tuesday and Stevens on Wednesday. After this the Garn~t return home to play Hamilton on May 14. Getting bUick on the winning track after losing to Hobart, Union's \nin~\ defeated Hamilton 8-2 and RPI 5-l. These victories give the Gamet five triumphs in eight starts as they prepare to host Kings Point. Winning Combo In beating Hamilton and RPI, the Garnet put together the winning combination: good pitching, a tight defense and timely hitting. Bill Neid-el came up with his third straight impressive per- formance on the mound as he held the tough Ham- ilton club to just tw.o runs oo.d 6 hits. Behind Neidel, Union hammered out 13 hit's in an att!l!Ck which featured Dave How·igan's solo home run to deep left field. On Tuesday, the Garnet traveled to RPI to show the Engineers how to play baseball. It 'vas Union all the way a.s southpaw B(}b Hallenbeck limited the Engineers to ju~t two hits, a simgle in the first and a double in the sixth. On the way to his first victory, Hallenbeck fanned three and walked but two. 9 Garnet ffits union scored in the first inning, the fifth and again in the ninth, as they collec-ted a total of nine hits. In the first Jim Williams walked with two outs, stole second and went to third as the throw went into center field. Moments later Bill Toth ·singled and the Garnet were ahead 1-0. After RPI countered with a tainted tally in the bottom of the firs.t, Union went ahead to stay in the fifth. Ken Merch-ant singled to life and Dave Hourigan drilled a 2-1 pitch to deep left field for his second home run in as many games. The Gar- net picked up two more insw·ance runs in the ninth.

The most significant has been the arrival of Harold C. Martin. He has brought a spirit of change to Union, a spirit that has all too frequently been missing in the past. For the first time in our memory, suggestion of change has been accepted as a real possibility. This, more than any- thing else, has helped the Union student take a personal interest in the college. The college will prosper or fail on the basis of its students' coneern and for that reason this is of the utmost importance. The cause of this lies in the administrative response to student initiative. Most important was the passage of the new social rules. While they still insist on administra- tive control of individual matters, they are an immense improvement over the official monasticism which had reigned before. We hope that the coming year will bring a new evaluation of even these relatively liberal rules. The passage of the All-College Council is, potentially_ nearly as important. Although it has yet to make its effect known, a forceful stand on the issues will make it a power- ful body for the improvement of Union. Also worthy of mention has been the excellent pro- gram of cultural events which have been available to stu- dents. Ivan Boldisjar, Raja Rao and the trips to New York for the German plays stand out, but the productions of Mountebanks, especially The Emperor, the Glee Club, and the Lectures and Concerts Committee all added significantly to the vitality of the campus. Several matters must, however, receive careful consid- eration in the fall. The most important of these is the program offered in physical education. Whatever the mer- its of the McLister case specifically, the response it aroused has proven that there is a need for a thorough and public investigation of the philosophy and performance of the present system. In the fall the new curriculum will finally take effect. We are confident that it will prove successful, but the en- tire college c()mmunity will have to continue to watch it critically, to iron out the inevitable malfunctionings and make the program even better. The college's annonnced policy of forced filling of the new dormitories is, we feel, unjustified and dangerous. Coercion at this time would tend to undue much of the good will which has be€n established between the student body and the administrators. It would also take some of the luster off the vast improvement that these dorms are over what has gone before. For these reasons we hope that the administration will reconsider its stand on this issue. But recognizing these pro-blems should not obscure the more important fact that a start has been made. One can- not expect that the prejudices which have grown up over the last 170 years will be eliminated overnight. Meanwhile •. one of the traditions will be celebrated when the seniors graduate in June. To them, who have been so important in obtaining the advances made during the past year, the CONCORDIENSIS gives its congratulations.

By Paul Grayson I have no wi·sh to- add my name to these who would pass judgment 001 the Daniel McLis~e:r situation. It is apparently very much a legltl- mate questio-n a:s to whether Mr. Ketz and/or the l'ules themselves have been too ri.gid with McLi,ster and as is true of most of 'US I am in- terested 'in finding out how his p1·oblem will be solved. But recognizing a posible injustice in the case of one studeni i's quite a different thing from using it as a springboard ~ ~verthrow the whole mai-ntenan · ce program. Thi.s xs not to say that our physical ed'Ucation syostem could .not ronceiva;bly profit from a careful evaluatxon; ce1tainly no department at Union .should be al- lowed · to become soaero-sanct. But it surprise'S me that anyone can . react so strongly agaimJSt maintenance. Personally I have always thought of it as one of the more progressive features of the college. m· t'Wice a year he is given a liberal l.'\' a nge of aC!'t i vities to · satisfy the l'equirements: bowling, g<>'lf, skiing and whatnot, as well as the more traditional basketball .and we-ightlifting. N orw Sti.ch.. is not the ease everywhere. Tlte beshma.n pr-<Jg-l'allls at many schools incorporate into theoi.r man<latory -courses old higll school f a vor-ites like wrestling , gymnastiC's, dribbling drill -s in basket- baJI; a.nd tests on soccer r'llles. Perhaps in the so-paomore year the student is then p -e rmitted Se>llle latitude in determining what he would like t() d<>, but even then -there are classes t.<l attend at l'El[Ular hO'Urs and there i s th€ OllUJS •of being gvacl-ed in the subject.

EASTERN AVENUE PIZZERIA Strangers When They Met Union students are no stranger'S to unfai'l' limitations on their freedom. The new social rules have alleviated an anachronism which probably deserved mm'e .atte!ltion tha~ it re- ceived. Next year, when xt will be fot·bxdden to move , off campus onee the new dol'Ill!s are up, criticisms of the school's policy as being unrea- sonably restrictive will again be justifiable. But the maintenance prograiiil if anything accords the student too muC'h freedom. Improved lnsfrtJction? 860 Eastern Ave .
