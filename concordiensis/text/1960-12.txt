Another proposal, enthusiastieally endorsed by many students, faculty mem- bers and administrative personnel, would utilize the shell 504 State St. FR 2-2l10 of the building for a Fine Arts Centre. A secondary, but provocative subject of controversy, concerns the anticipation of a possible renov~tion of the exterior c.f the N ott landmark to conform With the neo- classic design of the campus. The interest which the Nott Memorial discussion has 1 created on campus should .be of speci~ ~portance ~o ·alumni and to the College Trustees, for It IS a dramatic indication of the widening scope of student interest in college problems. Today's student is making himself and his class mates aware of the many considerations involved in the long range program to make Union an even better center of higher learning. Of prime importance in any dis~ussion of campus architecture is a complete understanding of the role of the College Trustees in any anticipated change. As the group which holds final responsibili~y for overall college planning, they are the only body which has access to the facts, figures, estimates and plans necessary to make an futelligent decision regarding the future use of the Nott Memorial, or any other college building. Student participation in. next we.ek's Undergraduat;e Alumni Fund Drive emphasiZes the Importance of their present and. future role in achieying ~he ~timate goals of Union College. An even closer Identification between the student and the college is necessary for a realization of his future college responsibilities. This vital end could be achieved by a closer line of communication between the · Trustees and ihe S~\ldent body. Owing to the grave and welllmown need on this cam- pus for a Fine Arts Centre, a central Administration build- ing, a Student Union, a Language Building and a new Stu- dent Activities Centre, the decision as to which proposal, or combination of proposals should be adopted is of prime significane€. Give and Take The start of the third annual Undergraduate Alumni Fund Drive on Monday comes at a time oif widespread student interest and discussion of campus building plans, the necessity for faculty salary increases, and the desira- bility of expanded programs in several areas of campus life such as athletics, scholarships, library, .and student activities. ' An examination of the latest \State of Union\ report, published just this week, reveals that college income from tuition and other student charges covered just half of the college's expenses for the :year 1959-1960. The other half, which permitted the college to barely operate in the black (by a hair-splitting $493.05 on a $2,500,000 budget) was derived from gifts of alumni, students and friends. Whether one prefers to think of this situation (com- mon to all private colleges) from the viewpo~nt that every student now at Union is on a 50 percent annual scholar- ship, or from a more sophisticated fiscal viewpoint, the need remains the same. In addition to being a graphic portrayal of the great importance of the Alumni Fund, next week's drive con- stitutes the sole method of effective expression of stu- dents' desires regarding present and long range college plans.

President-elect Kennedy will take office {assuming that a dis- gruntled group of southern con- servatives will be unsuccessful in throwing the ele~tion into the House of Representatives) in January with an unprecedented~ lack of political debts to pay off. Unlike most seasoned big-time politicians, Kennedy's campaign was managed by members of his dynamic family and a staff ·Of · dedicated, but non-professional advisors. Observers Speculate .As newspapers and experienced political observers spec u 1 ate, often with little basis, on Ken- nery choices for his cabinet, cam- pa.ign aid Lawrence 0'Brien is. busily compiling a list of faith- ful Kennedy campaign workers who will fill most of the ad- ministrative jobs just below cab- inet level. An unfortunate by- pr()duct of the anti-Catholic bias which was frequently mentioned dlll·ing the campaign is the cau- ti<>n which Kennedy feels com- pelled to exercise in appointing Catholic officers to his adminis- tration. Among those well quali- fiea in this category are J olln Bailey of Connecticut, who with Governor Ribicoff was one of the earliest Kennedy backers. Additionally, Bailey, Ribico:ff and Diplomat Chester Bowles, who like this columnist are all natives of Connecticut are being serious- ly considered for cabinet offices. Ribicoff appears a good choice for S~retary of Health, Education and Welfare at least until his arodously awaited Supreme Court post becomes vacant.

It is a sequel to the preced- ing show which dealt with Amer- ican art of the 18th and 19th centuries. ments in the U.S. Artists in this group use .a wide variety of media. including jurik, worn out ma- chinery, and various odds and ends, often intricately put to- gether and perhaps expressive of a disorderly world.

During my two year stay in India, I witnessed a change of sympathies in the English lan- guage press.

Council Adopts Severe f!enalty The adoption of a r\solu- , tion to severely penalize , a fraternity, some ot whose i m e m b e r s were accused i of participating in illegal 1 \dirty rushing\ procedures, 1 was the main order of busi- ness at the Interfraternity ' Council meeting of Tuesday night, December 6. Charles Schott, Chairman of the IFC Rushing Rules Enforce- ment Committee initiated actiQJI I by introducing evidence of t·ush- ing infractions by the accused fraternity and recommend.lng, on behalf of his Committee, that the ~ouncil penalize the hou<e by I \rev. oking its priviledge to pledge until the second Sunday in May.\ (May 7) I Discussion reveaied that other Council members regarded the the charges against Kappa Sigma ·as we11 founded, and the motion to penalize passed 14-2. Schott emphasized that infrac- ti0n must be punished if the system is to survive, and stated that the Enforcement Cpmmittee would continue to prosecute fur- ther instances of \dirty rushing.\ The Committee is known to have several other cases pending in- vestigation. Earlier iu the year, another fraternitw was fined fifty dollars on a rushing charge. Bidding Is Postponed In answer to the queries of some house presidents, Schott asserted that the penalized fra- ternity can carry out its sched- uled rushing program, but that it cannot bid new members be- fore May 7. It was implied that anyone wishipg to join the house would easily be able to do so, if bid, at that date. This decision was modi.li~d on Wednesday. See other story, this page.

Equal Justice Under Law Tbe Interfraternity Council met twice this week, par- tiall:y 1o consider an appropriate penalty for an alleged \dirty rushing\ rule vi?lati~n. Both meetirl~s were char- acteriz:cd by excellent directiOn from the cl'trur, an encour- agillg abundance of discussion and debate, but also by fallacious and ill founded conclusions, roesoh1tions and motions. Failure to properly grasp and differe11tiat€ between two basic questions caused many TFC m('mbers to act witltollt rt>gard for prupl'r substantiation ·Uof fads. At issue was not only the designatior1 of a rushing penalt~· to be invol{ed upon an errant ~rat_ernity, but the ques~ionable procedure. employed t~ md!ct the ~ouse, mainly on hearsay or madequate evtdence. and without even a pFrtense ot anything resembling a proper: and equi- tablE hearing. The same suspicious circumstances sur- rounded the fining of another fraternity earlier in the semester on a rushing charge. Furgottcn was the paramount stipulation of parlia- men.tary procedure that any action by a constituted body is automatically and inherently invalid when it is in oppo- sition to the laws of the land. Particulady unfortunate was, tiJC failure of the ll:<,C to adopt the suggestions of Cou11dlmember August, who unsuccessfully attempted to call attention to the injustic:e which was taking place. A.ny one of three courses of action by th.e major par- ties t() the controversy would have rectified the inequitable situation: 1. The president of the errant house should have spe- cified that he would not. accept the change in :penalty on Wednesday night. He should hav~ dema_nded a proper hearing and agreed in advance to abide by any punishment indica ted by such a hearing, however mild or- severe. One can.not bargain away one's lawful rights even for one's oua gain. 2_ The IFC should have tabled the r~co:mmendations of its Enforcement Committee until it was satisfied that the indictment was fair. Haste is a pool\' sul>stitute for justice. 3. The Enforcement Committee should have clarified and o.l'ganized its investigation and prosecution before it acted. The ends, however righteous, are ra_rely justified by the means. Excelsior!

Christmas-time is an occasion of joy .and good cheer, but most of all for the college man it is a long-awaited op- portunity to be home with one's loved ones. Across the length and breadth of our country, college students, barely out of their teens, will be tra veiling home for the holidays. Many will never reach their destination; America's highways and byways wilJ take their toll. In the homes where a life was lost the festive holiday spirit will be replaced by berea veme9-t and sorrow. What will your family have to look forward to this year -.a Christmas wreath or a funeral wreath? The National Traffic Safety Council's statistics for 1959 paint a bleak picture of mmder and mayhem on America's roads. Last year 45,800 Americans lost their lives in traffic accidents. But equally appalling is the fact that 3,250,000 other people were seriously injured, because someoNe ignored the basic rules of traffic safety. In 1959 the sceptre of death tolled for 13,430 people below the age of 24, while 702,000 other American youths were involved in non-fatal accident$. Ail college students and \the leaders of tomorrow\ we are credited .with the capacity for intelligent, rational thought. Let us use the intelligence we were blessed with when we ,enter upon the roads next week. Let us be mindful of the traffic rules and observe them. Don't sacrifice a life~time in a vain attempt to save one or two insignificant minutes. It takes nearly a quarter of a century to grow to manhood. It takes but a split second, though, to destroy a man. Of what use are the planning and effort that have brought you from infancy to early manhood if you de- stroy yourself before you have had the chance to test the dreams and ambitions you and your parents have shaped? At a time when World War III looms around the cor- ner in Algeria, the Far East, and Cuba in the Western Hemisphere, we must not forget the 365 day war that is taking place, right now, here at home. This is a war that kills far more people than have given their lives on our nation's battlefields and wrecks more homes and families than all the world's wars combined. What was accomplished by this monumental loss of life and limb on our highways? What were these men and women fighting for? It was not for any particular goal or ~a use. ~or did their deaths brin~ :th~ world an~clo.ser to mternahonal peace. They were f1ghtmg for somethmg as futile as distance or time or speed. They all lost the battle -there were no winners. Everyone loses in the Highway War. Schenectad\ holds the enviable :position of having no traffic fatalities for 1960. Let's not mar the l'ecord this vacation. Drive with care so this will be a truly Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year.

Equal Justice Under Law The lderfraternity Council met twice this week, par- tially to consider an appmpriate penalty for an alleged \dirty rushing\ rule violatiC?n. Both meetin&\s were char- acterized by excellent directiOn from the chair, an encour- a~ncr abundance of discussion and debate, but also by f:'lla~ious and ill founded conclusions, r·csolutions and motions Failure to prop0rly grasp and differentiate between two basic questions caused many IFC membPrs to act without rP~arrl fnr propt•r sub::;tantiatiun uf facts. .\t issue was not nnly the dPsignatinn of a rushing penalty tu be invoked upon an errant f_rat.ernity, but the que:e~ionabk' procedure L'mployed t~ md1ct the ~ouse, mainly on hl'arsuy m· madequatc endPnce. and \'-'llhout even :i )H'Ptem:w nt anything resembling a propel' and equi- table hearing. The same suspicious circumstances sur- roundL·d th.~ fining of another fratemity earlier in the semester on a rushing charge. Forgotten was the paramount stipulation of parlia- ntcntar),:- procedure that any action by a constituted body is autumatil'allv a.:1d inlwrentlv invalid when it is in oppo- sition to the lim·s of the land. Partiwlarly w1fortunate was the failun: of thl· IFC to adopt the suggestions of Councilmember August. who unsuccessfully attempted to call attention to the injustiu.• which was taking place. Any one of three courses of action by the major par- ties to the controversy would have rectif1t•d the inequitable situation: 1. The president of the errant house should have spe- dficd that he woulJ nul accept the change in penalty on Wednesday night. He should have demanded a proper hearing alH.l agreed in advance to abide by any punishment indicated by such a hearing, however mild or severe. One cannot bargain away one's lawful r-ights even for one's own gain. 2. The n~c should have tabled the recommendations uf its I::nfun:cment Committee until it was satisfied that the indictment was fair. Haste is a poor substitute for justice. 3. The Enforcement Committee should have elarified and organized its investigation and prosecution before it acted. The ends, however righteous, are rarely justified by the means. Excelsior! A CHRISTMAS WREATH •••• ... Be Here Next Year Next Saturday marks the inception of Christmas re- cess for the student body and faculty of Union College. Christmas-time is an occasion of joy and good cheer, but most of all for the college man it is a long-awaited op- portunity to be home with one's loved ones. Across the length and breadth of our country, college students, barely out of their teens, will be travelling home for the holidays. Many will never reach their destination; America's highways and byways will take their toll. In the homes where a life was lost the festive holiday spirit will be replaced by bereavement and sorrow. What will your family have to look forward to this year - a Christmas wreath nr a funPral wreath? Tlw .::\alional Traffic Safety Council's statistics fur 1959 paint a bleak picture of murder and mayhem on America's roads. Last year 45,800 Americans lost their lives in traffic accidents. But equally appalling is the fact that 3,250,000 other people were seriously injured, because someone ignored the basic rules of traffic safety. In 1959 the sceptre of death tolled for 13,430 people below the age of 24, while 702,000 other American youths were involved in non-fatal accidents. As college students and \the leaders of tomorrow\ we are credited with the capacity for intelligent, rational thought. Let us use the intelligence we were blessed with when we enter upon the roads next week. Let us be mindful of the traffic rules and observe them. Don't sacrifice a life-time in a vain attempt to save one or two insignificant minutes. It takes nearly a quarter of a century to grow to manhood. It takes but a split second, though, to destroy a man. Of what use are the planning and effort that have brought you from infancy to early manhood if you de- s~ruy yourself befor·e you have had the chance to test the dreams and ambitions you and your parents have shaped? At a time when World War III looms around the cor- ner in Algeria, the Far East, and Cuba in the Western Hemisphere, we must not forget the 365 day war that is taking place, right now, here at home. This is a war that kills far more people than have given their lives on our nation's battlefields and wrecks more homes and families than a.ll the world's wars combined. What was accomplished by this monumental loss of life and limb on our highways? What were these men and women fighting for? It was not for any particular goal or cause. Nor did their deaths bring the world any closer to international peace. They were fighting for som'ething as futile as distance or time or speed. They all lost the battle -there were no winners. Everyone loses in the Highway War. Schenectadv holds the enviable position of having no traffic fatalities for 1960. Let's not mar the record this vacation. Drive with care so this will be a truly Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year. Monday morning's Convocation, at which Ian Forbes J:i\'rascr spoke on the Algerian problem. was the finest ex- ample of a truly worthwhile assembly program that has appeared in I\lemorial Chapel since the inception of t.he new system. The combination of an articulate and informed speak- er, an intensely important topic and precise timing were the invaluable constituents of success in Monday's pro- gram. An example of such excellence evokes both hearty applr.use for the sponsoring Lectures and Concerts Com- mittee and discouraging lament that few of Union's as- sembly programs compare with this vitally interesting , program. Assembly programs which increase undergraduate ' exposure to the world's perplexing dilemmas are prefer- ' able to those which can offer nothing but entertainment.

It can be organized in any large basement 111 small coliseum within a mat- ter of minute,;. If utter chaos is not desired (no extra ch;u·ge) this nroredure might take a while longer. 1ne ground rules are as fol· lows; a small number of cards are ::;elected at random face down representing every major coun- try, city, principality, ghost town, river, mire, tundra, forest. and candy store in the world. When each participant receives his cai,ds, he becomes their proprie- tor and must assume all char- acteristics that his cards 1·epre- sent.

This offer is the sign for all other players to tender any or all of their cards in what has been sometimes called a \shady deal.\ If any participant can peddle all his tickets. he is the winner.

Why must Union he chamed to 1ts old and antiquated system of study'? Whv not give \haggis\ a tt•y'? Until I arrived in Edinburgh I sincerely believed that thei·e 1vas no city on this earth as re- actionary us s~henectady. In comparison to Edinburgh, how- ever, Schenectady might be likened to Babylon; and \haggis\ has prospered in Edin.bur~h. \Vi~h­ in six months of 1ts mcept10n here things began to happen: (1} the closing time for the pubs wa~ changed from 10 PM to 10:3P ·PM· (2) the \nouYelle vague\ the~tre sprung up again after its suppression by the labor gov- ernment; (:ll Her Majesty, Queen Elizabeth 11, diminished the num- ber of her royal visits consider- ably (which is quite a feat, con- sidering that her husband is The Duke of Edinburgh), I can confidently guarantee that if you ingtitutl' \haggis\ at Union, you will find that educa-: tion is a new and exciting experi- ence. You t-dll !'ee the forces of' progress at work, weeding out· the old. out-dated institutions that have kept l:nion from her place in the sun. Why, in fivr years time you won't he able to recognize the \old Union,\ sc quick and swE>eping are the re· ~ults of \haggis.\ Let Union be the first, and the remuinder of the American universities will foreYer be indebted to her.

There is no particular reason for making this point, except that whenever I think: of Fort Lauderdale, I think of rye bread. There is no particular·reason for that either, but I have been thinking of Fort Lauderdale. Fort Lauderdale is \where the boys are.\ Right now, that is. Most of the time, sereni!;y reigns in Fort Lauderdale. {The Chamber of Commerce will hate me; they say it never rains in Fort Lauderdale.) But, for .two weeks, , twenty thousand collegians descend on this peaceful comrnuriity and take it apart, peace by pe!lce. They call it Spring Vacation, but it's more Hke amateur night at Cape Canaveral. They capture Florida and throw the Keys away. But I sh()u!tln't joke- not while people arc holding mass prayer meetings for an early hurri· cane season. This is \where the boys a;e.\ And girls, too. Such girls, it :makes you dizzy to look at them. If ycm look long enough, you reach an advanced ·stage of dizziness called aphro· dizzier. It's like being in Jove. That's what happened to me, and it will happen to you, too.

Ah, bathing suits ••. when the man said, \It's the little things in life that count,\ he must have been thinking of bathing suits. But mostly, it's the girls.
