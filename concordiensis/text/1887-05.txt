VOL. X. UNION COLLEGE, MAY 20, 1887. No. 8. Trailing Arbutus. T HE maples wave their beaded twigs, Against the chang·ing· April skies, · Wherein alternate tears and smiles Are wooing earth to life and joy; The builder's art the robin p.Jics While he with song· the task beg·unes. The pussy willow's silvery tufts Are nodding· o'er the marshes' verge, And near, the aspen's velvet fringe Sways ne:tth the starling's quick alight; The lengthening suns the hillsides urge To take at once a geetner tinge. Now where the snow drifts ht·~ have lain, And faded Autumn leaves still lie The sweet Arbutus dimly feels, New life awakening in her Yeins, Stretches her leaves toward the sl\:y, 'rhe sunshine's kiss in flowers seals; White, where retreating Winter trod, Pink, where Springtime's rosy reet Stirred the dead leaves as on she passed, Fair plcdg·e, to an impatient world, Of flowery dells with fragTance sweet Of fields with blossoms sown broad-cast. 'l'hou Edelweiss of western.Alrs. Close to our transient g·acim·'s edg·e I pluck thee, where thou bloom'st alone, And like the Alpine suitor bold Do takethee-my affection's pledge- To her I hope to call my own. And if my suit she doth accept, Doth give me answering love for love, She~n fasten thee within her zone, Then breaks the Spring· upon my life .And brig·ht the hoa vens smile above- 'l'hen will she sometime be my own. The Mysterious Student. I T was during last Christmas vacation that I heard the tale that I am about to ralate. I had accepted an invitation from my chum, Harry, to spend Christmas with him, my parents being in Flo,rida ~or the winter. I must adm-it that I accepted his invitation the more readily -when I learned that his sister Gracs, would be ho:n3 fro1n bo::trding school during 1ny stay, for I had seen her picture nnd was quite anxious to meet her. I founJ her even more baautiful than her picture and was becoming, to say the least, very much interested, whsn on3 evening during the latter part of my visit we were sitting in the parlor chatting when her £athe-r entered and patting her g antl y on the cheek inquired what we were talking about so earnestly. Grace answered, \W a wera aTguing the rel- ative fiJelity and C.)ll3Gancy or th3 S3xes, papa, each taking the part of his own sex, of course.\ The old gentleman looked as if he thought this. rather a dangerous topic for us but he said ; \I have often ·wondered if any wo1nan could be 1nore constant than poor Donald Moore was to his fianc~c, I believe that I have n3v Jr told the sto1·y with all of its particulars to anyone for years, perhaps you -would. like to hear it.\ O..E course Grace begged fo1· the story, sec::>nded but 'veakly I 1nust confess by myself, for I rather resented. the interruption. The old gentleman drew up an easy chair, sat down and gave hi1nsel£ up to reflection for a few moments and then began. It was when I was in college at Yale that the event or rather series o£ events happened. When I returned at the beginning of Junior year I found that the roo1n directly across the hall from mine had a new occu- pant, but I did not see the man until I had been back several clays, then I 1net him in the hall. He ·wn,s o£ magnificent build, tall, deep chest9d anJ n1uscular, with black curly hair and a blac1r mustache, he was drassed ... not elegantly but vaTy nicely and had the air o£ a perfeJt gantleman, but the strange.st feJ.ture was his £ac3.

I left· him just as he lay, only closing the black eyes; as I knew that an inquest would be held. As I passed by the table my eyes fell on a paper fastened to the lamp. It was addressed to me and read, \I am alone, you are the only friend . within 100 miles of me, telegraph to my brother (giving ·his address). You doubt- less would know my secret.

I look back upon that scene now and think o£ the story o£ poor Dona] d and his great grief and thank God from 1ny heart that I ·was not in his place. For my life is as happy as his was miserable.

With this stream is connected many romantic and interesting associations, 1nost o£ which relate to those ' deeds of Indian ·valor or of Indian cruelty which distinguished those tribes who once · dwelt upon its borders. On its eastern bank there stands a solitary and wide stretched tree, which is said to · have sheltered a whole family from the ferocity of the Indians on the . night o£ the burning of Schenectady. ·The tree is hollow, and the opening is large enough to admit a person, tho11gh he cannot be seen from ·without. The city of Schenectady appears from the college hill to good advantage, and gives . additional interest to the beauty of the pros- pect. In the rear o£ the college buildings, to the east, stretches a long and luxuriant wood, and in such a day as this, when Faren- heit stands 80 above zero, may be seen through the trees many a group of students reclining upon nature's velvet, engaged appa- rently in the arduous task of unravelling the · mysteries of some abstruse science-or, more likely in reading, and feeling too, the beauty of the sky, and the balm of a breeze, as described in some of our poetry. This · wood stretches to the east a great distanc~, and in the sum1ner days its cooling shade renders ..it a most delightful retreat from the · scorching rays of a mi~-day sun. A strea1n 9£ cooling and glowing water winds its way through~ its bosom between its rocks and hills, at intervals widening and decreasing, and sometin1es lost beneath its verdant carpet. It possesses many springs of cool and re- freshing _water, ·which can be raised to the height o£ seventy -five feet and could easily supply several fountains in front of college, which would give a new and beautiful addi- tion to the grounds. There are also in the wood several sulphur springs, which possess many excellent medicinal qualities. Such is an impe·rfect description of Union College. \\V e fear that no one can conceive .a correct idea of it from what ·we have written, and that the reader, if happily there be one, will have as just an impression of it, as before perusing this hasty sketch. To realize the beauty o£ the view which the college hilJ commands, and the peculiar adaptation o£ the situation for a college, it must be seen. There nre many fine natural advantages possessed by it, which we have not enumerated. rrhe scene which we are now gazing upon defies the power of pencil or pen. The vall~y, glowing with its sumn1er fruitfulness-the river, ·which appears as a dimple upon its face-· and the line of hills overlooking the scene, give to it a beauty which can hardly be surpassed. It is im- possible to in1agine a more beautiful sunset than that which gilds our evening sky. The \God o£ gladness'' sheds no where his part- ing smile in a more gorgeous stream of glory than on the valley of the Mohawk. The heavens, to the meridian glow, with the bright- ness its fading beams impart, as over earth and on the wave is flung the dying effulgence. A Query. I .F stars can clasp their myriad hands AC'ross the boundless fields of space, And while in circling dance they sweep Hol<l each the other in his peace: If 'neath her lunar partnet·'s smile The earth'E~ bt·oad ocean-bosom heav(;, And mighty forces, all unknown, Through (:'arth and heaven interweave: If light can wing het· groping· flight Down darkness' measureless abyss, And bear to the most distant orb A gTeeting in the sunbeam's kiss: Why may not, then, a subtler force Bi r1d hearts that beat in unity Of iove. though they be parted far By miles of land or leagues of sea? Why may not sainted hands extend Down from the spirit-world, and hold Aloft the would-be murderer's knife~ And turn the miser from his gold?

While we believe that on certain occasions college spirit cannot be so well manifested in any . other way as by a spirited yell or the chorus o£ a college song, still noise is not spirit. College spirit is an active interest in college matters; it may be shown in athletics; it may be sho\\rn in class affairs; it may, in a word, b3 shown in any college organization. • SCARCELY a man has spoken in Chapel upon a subject, however remotely related to our government in any o£ its phases, but seems to have felt it his imperative duty to score some kicks at the basis o£ our govern- ment, or to strike some blows at the heads o£ our departments, or to aim some thrusts at the vital principles of our institutions. Each speaker seems to £eel it incumbent upon him to assume the position o£ critic, and with ruthless hand to lay bare the weakness of this political measure, or to undermine the structure o£ that governmental policy.
