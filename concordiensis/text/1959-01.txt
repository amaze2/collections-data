We are deeply appreciative that he has made possible the attain- ment of one of our major post- war goals. We shall endeavor to justify Henry Schaffer's confi- dence.\ Schaffer Well Known A prominent local businessman, Schaffer ha.s also become well known in the local community for his interest in civic enter- prises and for llis many philan- thropic activities. In addition to his contributions to Unon, he has also contributed to Albany Med- ical School, the two major local hospitals, Congregation Temple Gates of Heaven and other area institutions. In o:ther civic affairs, Schaffer is a director of Sunnyview Ortho- pedic Hospital, and St. Glare's Hospital. He is a charter mem- ber and past director of the Na- tionai Association of Food Chains and a past president of the New York State Chain Grocers and of the Schenectady Chamber of Commerce. Henry Schaffer has been prom- inent for many years as a p,i.oneer in the field of super-marketing and as the founder and president of Empire Super Markets, one of New York's largest individually owned food chains prior to its re- cent acquisition by the Grand Union Company. Is Schenectady Native A Schenectady native, he open- ed his first enterprise, Standard Grocery, in 1911. The business proved to be the first link in the 163-unit Schaffer Store chain, which extended throug'h<>ut the Mohawk and Hudson Valleys. Fol- lowing the opening of his first super-market in Schenectady in 1932, he gradually e<>nsolidated the smaller Schaffer ·stores into the larger Empire Super \Markets, which eventua.Hy covered the en- tire eastern part of the state. The 41 store ochain was acquired by Grand Union on June 2, 11}58, and announcement was made recently of Schaffer's election to the Board of Directors of that firm.

Will Discuss Rushing By Robert Goldenberg In a very short meeting this past Tuesday evening, the House President's Council decided l:.o dis- cuss the Report on Rushing, written by a committee headed by Larry Kahn, that w~L be pre- sented at its next meeting. Also at the next meeting, the sugges- tion put forth by Mr. Theodore Mcii!waine of buying a new lec- tern for Memorial Chapel would be discussed and elections for new offiocers will be held. Rep()rt Is Ready The Rushing report, finished over the Christmas vacation, is now ready for presentation. There are some minor .changes to be made and these are J5eing worked on now. Not much information was disclosed about the repoTt, except that the committee \had done a very fine job.\ The report is ten pages long, but is far from being complicated. It centers on mainly two topics: Deferred Rushing and Co-operative Bid- ding. The bidding is practica11y the same as it stands now, but many more pledges will be ruc- cepted. Mo1'e Will Be Bid A House that does not want a .person as a pledge does not have to accept him, but it .is assured that many more boys will receive bids due to this system. When the report is presented, one can then formulate his own opinion. The report has already passed the Faculty Council and should have no trouble being passed by the Student Council and the Hf'IC. It was also mentioned that the HPC would have a good deal of ·con- trol over the new plan. Founded at Union College in 1877 SCHENECTADY, N.
