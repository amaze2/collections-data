THE CON.CORDIENSIS VoL. XX\ 7 11. UNION COLLEGE, JUNE 15, 1904. No. 28. THE ONE HUNDRED AND ElGHT.H ' . . ; ' .. COMMENCEMENT. Detailed Account of 'Events. SUNDAY, JUNE FIFTH. Baccalaurepte sermon opens t~e week. Graduates, mothers, fathers, sisters and friends gathered in the First Reformed church, Sunday night, to hear President Raymond preach the annual baccalaureate sermon, thus beginning the exercises of the 1o8th com- mencement of Union College. Hot and op- pressive weather did not prevent the attend- ance of an audience that packed the church. On the rostrum with Dr. Raytnond, sat Rev. George R. · Lunn of First Reformed church, Rev. A. Russell Stevenson of, First Presbyterian church,. Rev. F: vV. Adams ?f State. Street. Method~st church, and Rev. W. B. Allis of Congregational ch u reb. The- text· of t 1-le sermon was from I Cor. 3 : 9, '' For we are laborers together with God.\ The president warned the graduates against a wrong use of their power as college men, and severely scored the evil methods of the monster corporations. At the conclusion of Dt. Rayrnond 's address Dr. Lunn made a prayer, the service ending with Dr. Raymond pronouncing the benedic- tion. MONDAY. Ivy exercises-Oratorical:::; and exten1pora- neous speaking-Fraternities entertain. A little b~fore three o'clock, the members of the class of 1904, headed by the president, E. v.' Mulleneaux and their marshall, G. V. Sherrill, marched across the campus and enter· ed '' Captain Jack's Garden \ by the little gate in the rear of Old North. Proceeding down the garden path, across the \Brook that bounds,\ they gathered around the Nott Elm, singing their class song, which Gioscias Or- chest.ra had started; and there under the grand old tree which has heard the farewell greetings ·of men now 'vhite with age surrounded by in- teresting friends in the n1idst of beautiful foli- age and June blossoms, the exercises were held. President 11 ulleneaux then introduced the the speal{ers and Thaddeus G. Cowell respond- ed with the ivy oration. rrhe Ivy poem was then read by Carl C. McCon1bs, and the pipe onttion de:l ivered by Stephen C. Fiero. 1.,h~ con1plete progrom was as follows: Orchestra. · Ivy oration, Thaddeus G. Cowell, Albany, N.Y. Ivy . Poem, Carl E. McCoombs, ·Frankfort, N.Y. Orchestra. Pipe orati<On·, Stephen C. Fiero,. Saugerties, N.Y. Orchestra. Planting the ivy vine. Orchestra. · Con1petition was not particularly keen in the annual oratorical contests in the evening in the First Reformed church. However the general work of the contestants \VaS fine. rfhe progran1 opened with the oration \Our Coun- try \ by George Francis Hall of the Sopho- mores. He was followed by Edgar Stone Closson speaking on ''The Patriot's Attitude toward Unionisn1, '' and Byron '\Yilliam Reed with the oration, \Benedict Arnold: Soldier and 1.,raitor. '' After the n1usic and announcetnent of the subject for the extemporaneous speaking, the Junior contest began with an oration by Ernest Judson Ellenwood on.'' The Unsolve.d Prob- lem.\ Then came Louis Chrisler Hart with an addre_s;:; . on. '' The Struggle in ·the Far

6 THE CONCORDIENSIS. East.'' Thomas Milton Holmes, another of the Junior speakers., was unable to be present. As is seen, each of these contests did not present four speakers as was intended when the prize oratorical'S were instituted. Jn the extemporaneous contest only two speakers ap- peared. These were Tviorris Thotnas Raymond 'os and Cornelius Lansing Hays 'o4. William I-Ienry Guardenier 'o4 was unable to take part. The special subject for discussion was resolved that the United States should give up its pol· icy of isolation and take a position in the poli- tics of the world. Rev. Mr Lunn announced the a wards. Messrs. Reed and Closson took first and second respectively for the Sophon1ores, and Messrs. Ellenwood and Hart the same for the Juniors. The judges were unable to decide definitely on the winner of the extemporaneous speaking and the prize of $so was divided be- tween Messrs Raymond and Hays. Informal teas were given in the afternoon by Kappa Alpha and Psi U psi Ion fraternities. Many of the students and friends frotn the city were present at these two delightful func- tions. In the evening, there took place the annual dance of Sigma Phi in Yates Boat House. The hall was prettily trimmed, and as is the usual case the affair was one of the noteworthy events of the week. TUESDAY. Alumni to the front-Pledge money-Re~ unions~Meetings-Class day exercises. The Alumni dinner was held in a large tent on the campus Tuesday at I p. m. As Dr. Raymond said in his remarks it was far differ- ent from previous years ''for we have left those inspiring walls of Memorial Hall for- ever.'' There were large delegations from the class- es '44, '54, '64, '74, '84, '94 and each respond- ed in words of love for ''Old Union\ when called upon by the toastmaster. rrhe class of '84 pledged $3,200 to be paid at the end of five years and this amount to be doubled if possible. The following classes also pledged· class of '64, $1ooo; class of '94, $soo or a possible $tooo; class of 1903, $5oo, payable Jan. 1st 1905. The report .of the Board was given to the great satisfaction of all, principally because Old Union is doing what IIarvard and Colum- bia are not and that is, she is living within her means. Much praise is due to the trustees. A very heavy rain storm came up toward the close; the tent was soon wet through which made it seem far more necessary that a more substantial place of n1eeting should be provid- ed. The meeting of the Phi Beta Kappa Frater- nity was held at Washburn Hall , at 9 o'clock. The following officers were elected: l'he Rev. Phillip H. Cole, '88, of Syracuse, president; Prof. S. G. Ashmore, vice presi- dent; Prof. Frank S. Hoffman, secretary; Robert J. Landon, '8o, Schenectady, treasurer; John C. VanVoast, '87, Schenectady, corre- sponding secretary. Carl E. McCombs, George E. Smith and Walter C. Beadle of the class of 1904 were elected members. At a meeting of the Sigma Xi society, Le- land W. Irish, Andrew W. Lent and Elbert G. Rulison of I 904, were elected members. C. P. White of the class of '79 was elected life trustee of the college by the board of trus- tees. Nearly all the fraternities held their reunion banquets in the evening among them were: Kappa Alpha, _Sigma Phi, Delta Phi, Pis U psi- Ion, Chi Psi, Alpha Delta Phi, Phi Delta Theta and Beta Theta Pi. The Delta Upsilon Fraternity held a dance in Yates' Boat House. Over Ioo people were present. Refreshments were served by Dober~ mann. At four o'clock on Tuesday afternoon the class of 1904 held their class-day exercises at the First Reformed church. The exercises were well attend~d and thoroughly enjoyed. Selections by the orchestra were interspersed during the program and helped to enliven it,

GLOBE HOTEL, A.Ll3ANY.--Adv. The President, Elbert V. Mulleneaux, open- ed the exercises with a,a :address on the class of nineteen-four, in which he proved him,self worthy of his subject. The class oration, delivered by \VUHam H. Guardenier, was a marked success, and the class prophet, Charles G. Stiles, predicted a startling and successful ;future for his class- mates ; according to his prophecy there will be famous doctors, teachers, ministers, poets and policen1en among then1. Archibald H. Rutledge, the class poet, read his serious-sounding but inwardly humorous ode, as certain irrepressible outbursts from his classmates testified ; and his effort was received with hearty applause. WEDNESDAY Graduation exercises-Degrees conferred- Prizes awarded-Citizens of Schenectady to beautify campus-President's reception-Sen- ior ball. The exercises were he:ld in the morning at ten o'cl.)ck in the First Reformed church of Schenectady where a large audience was gath- ered to attend graduation. The class left the college grounds at ten o' dock, headed by Mr. Elbert V. Mulleneaux, president, and the mar- shall, Mr. George V. Sherrill. Following were faculty, several of the older alumni, President Raymond, Honorary Chancellor Bishop Doane, the Reverend Richard D. Harlan, and the Hon. Amasa J. Parker. The program was begun by singing the I r 7th psalm. After a prayer, President Ray- nlond introduced Cornelius L. Hays as the first speaker. His oration, ,entitled '' 'T'he True End of the State ''was n.cticeable for its clear and earnest delivery. John Aloysius Mahar followed with an ora- tion entitled ''Emerson, the Philosopher,'' an oration evidencing much study and thought on the subject, which he placed in a very interest- ing light. '' Heredity no bar to progress, '' Carl E. Mc- Combs' subject, though rather a difficult one, was :excel! en tly treated by him, THE '00NCORDIENSIS. 7 After a short interlude enlivened by music by Gioscia, Dr. Raymond introduced Elbert T. Rulison. In his oration, afterwards awarded the :first Blatchford oratorical medal, he said, \The view r.egardingthe contents of the Bible is undergoing a rapid change. On:ly the ultra- conservative persons still insist on the literal interpretation of all its passages. The demand of reason that our Bible receive a careful re- vision is being met by the clergy with an ex- cellent spirit and many of its inconsistencies are being adjusted. We have to £ear to-day what one writer has called ''Over intellectualism,\ that is the elimination of everything of an emotional na- ture from the cult. But this is not likely to be encountered; as man by his very nature is en1otional and will never cease to worship with awe and reverence, pouring out from the depths of his soul, his feelings for the God of infinite love and righteousness.'·' The valedictory oration on ''The n1unicipal question,,, was then delivered by Andrew W. Lent. After concluding his oration, he spoke in appreciation of the president, trustees and faculty, exhorted his classmates to be ever loy- al to Union and then addressed the undergrad- uates as follows: ''Undergraduates of Union, in the past years, we may have done those things which were not wise nor for the highest honor of Union. 'I'hose things we ask you to forget and to follow us only in our intention of acting for the best interest of our college. We have now turned over to you the last remnant of au- thority in undergraduate affairs, and as we go out we still look back expectant for greater things from our college with a hope that what- ever good we may have done will form only a slight part of the foundation for what you will do.'' After some tuore music, Right Reverend William ,Croswell Doane of Albany delivered the chancellor's address. He chose as a title, '' Citizenship'' and delivered it in a most com- prehensive and exemplary manner. Dr, Raymond then in the exercise of the au-

Rev. vViUiam Croswell Doane, bishop of AIM bany. Doctor Laws (LL. D.), the Rev. Richard D. Harlan, president of Lake Forest College; Daniel M. Stimson, M. D., Union '64, New York; the Hon. Amasa J.

It was signed by a number of Schenectady's most prominent n1en as a com.- mittee for the oity. In closing, the entire audience joined in singing the ''Song to Old Union.,, Over 150 peopt:e w·ere present in the evening at the annual reception given by the President and Mrs Raym~ond at thetr spacious home to the faculty, alumni, graduates and cit-izens of Schenectady. Gioscia's orchestra furnished the music and the affair lasted from eight until ten. It may be put down as one of the mo~t delightful fpnc.tions of. the week. Brilliant and long was the conclusion which the senior baH gave to the festivities of the week. Gioscia, decorations, dances, costumes --everything and everybody-was out for the best except the weather, and that did little to prevent the enjoyment witl1in. Five o'clock saw the biggest society event of the year still in progress, and daylight had appeared long before the final function of 1904 was at an end. NOTT MEMORIAL CELEBRATION. President Eliot May Speak-Many · Alumni Expected. It is no doubt a delight to the heart of every Union man to know that a celebration in honor of the memory of old Dr. N ott is to be held. For a numbe'T of years it has been the desire of the Board of Trustees to hold such a celebration as a fitting recognition of Dr. N ott's glorious ·career and his deep leyal- ty to Union. Now that Memorial Hall has been turned into a beautiful library there is no better time to honor our illustrious president. To no other man does Union owe as much as she does to Dr. N ott, and for this reason every effort is being made to make the com- ing celebration a magnificent affair. It is to be held 011 Thursday, September 29, r 904, and continue the whole day from 10.30 in the morning. Undoubtedly one of the most in- teresting features of the day will be the per- sonal reminiscences of Dr. Nott of a number ..

Judge Parker Gives last Lecture-News- paper Men Disappointed. Before sixty l.a w students of the University, Judge Alton B. Parker, the probable Demo- cratic nominee for president, delivered on the morning of M'ay 31st, tl1e final lecture of the course, on the \Origin of the Civil Law.\ In the hope that the chief justice would depart from his usual rule and say something on poli- tics, a large crowd of newspaper men were present especially from New York City. The lecturer apparently saw no reason for any such remarks as he did not even refer to the con- ' gratulations sent hitn by the students on his nomination at the State Convention some weeks before. Judge Parker graduated from the Albany Law S.chool in the class of '72 and has been a COMMENCEMEN'T.

Address all communications to THE CONCORDIENSIS, Union College, S<:he!lectady, N. Y i Never has the college had as much respect and love for the class of 1904 as now. It is the one hundred and eighth dass to hGnor the illustriom~ roll of Union's alum- ni. To bid it farewell would be to disparage the great- ness which it has still to achieve, · and scoff at the very object of· our alma mater's efforts. The class has left us, .but its greatest work for the old college is yet to come. Union expects it. She has given freely of all she has, and 1904 in future years will make good the sacrifice. It is by their works that the college will, for the first time, best and most truly know them, 'N e, their companions for one, two and three years, watch with great interest and some anxiety the men of 1904 make the plunge into the pool which we all some- time have to enter. It is full of turmoil, strife, sorrow, care, some joy and many other things, it is said, but it is· mostly joy that we swim in inside the :Blue Gate. We know that 190'-1- will not draw back, even if the water is cold and the men unused to long ventures. They have manifested already on the campus and in the class room enough of what are called the principles of success to make their progress sure and glorious. They may not always have been over particular guides, phUosopbers and friends, but they have ever stood, in their <>wn way, for the welfare of our college. 'l'he way has been a good one and that record is enough. A full review of the 1904 track and baseball seasons wm come out in the next issue. Commencement reports forbade its publication in this number. 1904 CLASS POEM. I Time after time and yet once more again Your songster must unhinge l1is rusty pen, Blow thoughtfully upon his phalanges And tune him for this last jocund refrain. 2 To Feminre Divinre first is due Vast tribute for we ever found her true To him who called upon her certain days ; Sometimes 'twas I, my friend, sometimes 'twas you. 3 And yet I think that we had never grown \Vise in affection or to loving prone Had not old Father Adam, long ago Been robbed one night of a thoratic bone. 4 Oh little bone that innocently grew Beneath the first man's breast, if you but knew The wonder of your love, the sorrow caused By fickleness, you would be always true. 5 Each Senior when a Freshman oft would start And brace himself and fancy he loo'ked smart At sight or sound of feminine attire And think surely someone had lost a heart. * * * * * 7 Now one's sufficient for his joys annd tears, One little woman, just to share his cares, One, only one, for oh, should marriage come He must attend to what that lady wears. * * * * *

At present it has a membership of thirty seven. Any non-fraternity student at Union is eligible to membership.

'This is the first year that Union College has had a systematic way of aiding needy students to se- cure employment for the college year. In or- der to secure places for students, the men1bers of the :commi~tee thoroughly canvassed the business places in the city and placed the names of such as needed help in the hands of Dr Stoller, who communicated with the stu- dents. Over thirty men secured po-sitions during the year, through the instrumentality of the bureau, as clerks, waiters, taking care of houses, etc. Already several men have applied to the Bureau for work. next' ye.ar and everything is pointing to a successful year. 'The Teachers' Agency is also a part of the Bureau and is already gaining a reputation for sending out reliable Union n1en as teachers in the various schools throughout the state. There is an advisory committee of twenty-five alutnni which keeps informed of vacancies and ' notifies the Bureau which immediately refers to the waiting list and notifies the applicant f()r the position that one is open for him. As tbe Bureau is exclusively for Union graduates and as there is no fee whatever charged for , I . - tl b b t t \ (

The Bureau intends to keep, next year, a tabulated account of every person assisted to a position and the amount earned each week. Salaries ranging from $r to $4 for a few hours per week were paid this year. The Bureau is filling a great want of the University and by next year the plans of the committee in charge are intended to broaden its work and help· 1nore young men to a col- lege education at Union.

14: THE CONCORDIENSIS. BRIEFS. George Clute Injured-IQ08 Register- New Painting for Silliman Hall. George Clute,. the esteemed superintendent of the college grounds, while adjusting some electric lights in Memorial Hall, in prepara- tion for the Senior Ball, was thrown, by the breaking of a rung, from the ladder on which he was standing to the floor fifteen feet below. He received a severe cut over the right eye and was unconscious for some titne. The latest reports asserted that 1fr Clute was greatly improved. The class of 1908 began its career Thurs- day when thirty-four filed their way into the office of Mr Pond to register and then take th \ \ Th' . ·. e exams. ts 1s a somewhat larger number than has re~istered in recent years for the June examinations and conditions strongly point to a large class in the fall. \Morning on the Lake'' is the subject of the new painting presented by the College Woman's Club to the college to be hung in Silliman Hall. -------- Prof. Frank Coe Barnes has been advanced from instructor in the Modern Language department to that of adjunct professor. At the recent meeting of the trustees, a liberal sum was voted to equip more fully the r physical-and chemical laboratories of the col- lege. At the coming celebration of the 1ooth an- niversary of Dr. N ott's acceptance of the presidency of Union College, the faculty wilJ wear the cap and gown, the regular academic costume. This is contrary to the custom of the college. UNlONUNIVERSITY QUARTERLY The .first number of Union's new maO'azine b appeared the week before commencement. It is a book of some sixty pages, devoted to liter- ary and scientific articles; happenings around college and news of the alun1ni. Its purpose, as stated in the introduction, is to complen1ent the college weekly and to be, for the most part, a magazine \of the graduates, by the graduates and for the graduates.'' There are four long contributions in this number by ~rofessor Stoller, Frederick ... W. Seward, David Murray and Professor Ash- more. The remainder of the magazine is de- voted to a tribute to the late Mrs Peissner, University notes and alumni matter. Not the least gratifying feature of the Quar- terly is the Board of Editors, and the interests of the college in this direction may well be trusted in their hands. They, as well as all contributors and promoters are to be congratu- lated on the creditable suceess of their under- taking, Shoes that ma.rk the ewell clressecl man~ Fea.rey's CJRUFITT a.t $3. 50 ]os.

Catlin, ex-'67, banker and mil- lionaire, of Scranton, Pa., was .married in New York, to Miss Ellen vValsh of Carbon- dale, Pa.. Mr Catlin is fifty-nine years old, an active business man, one of the leading citi- zens of his city. His fortune is estirnated at $3,ooo,ooo. Some years ago, Lafayette ·Col- lege conferred on him the degree of Master of Arts. •' \'\.4-_., \.r~· William Chauncey Yates, '98, was married in the Union Presbyterian Church of Sche- nectady, to Miss Grace Phillips Lawrence, daughter of the Rev. :Egbert 'C. Lawrence,\ of No. 36 University place. The ceremony was perfonned by the father of the bride, who was given away by her brother, Arthur B. Law- rence. Mr .. Yates is a tnember of the Kappa Alpha fraternity and the University Club, and is in charge of one of the departments of the Rheostat plant of the General Electric Com- pany. in cases and an elaborate system of red tape had to be gone through to withclraw a book or two at a time. 'I'he student felt that he was an enemy of the books and his only re- source was to go without them or to go to ~;ii:'e'\-·'other library. With the opening of Nott Memorial H:aU during the past college year, conditions were changed. rrhe building with its new furniture and equipment was at- tractive in itself. :But to the student the open book shelves, which were free to him ~!Uore inviting. Every e£fort has been made to get the students to use the library. The ·whole library was open to his use and he might with- draw as many books as he needed for an indefinite period unless called for at the library, and this without a deposit. 'fhe wisdom of this was shown by the circulation which was doubled, although it is not now what it should be. Although no record was form.erly kept of the number of books used in the library, it is certain that this number has been multiplied many times. It is interesting to know that the library has lost but two books to the knowledge of Librarian and the value of these is less than $1.00. i>\ The following is taken from an Albany paper: A very quiet wedding occurred at the M. E. The library has received many valuable books by gift through the year.

The books were locked The ce>llection of books written by Union college alumni ; books about Union college alumni, and books about Union college has been begun. rrhis collection will be given a separate alcove on the first floor and will be of great interest to Union college alumni. It is the desir~ of the Library authorities to make the Library the centre of the intellectual life of the college. This is possible only with the co operation of the faculty and students.
