The game was hard fought throughout and was not decided until the laEt two minutes of the last period. Sfarbuck carried off the honors for Union, with Fair- back and Logan, right half, were the \star\ men. Welsh worked a fake punt play for decided gains several times ani booted the baH forty or forty-five yards every time he was called upon to punt. Logan was a terror when it came to carrying the ball and pt:obably made two thirds of the ground the Scarlet covered. Williams deserves. credit for the way he ran the team and for some effective quarterback runs. The two teams were about evenly matched as far as. weight is concerned with the exception of the backs. In the back field the visitors had considerably heavier men and the extra weight was noticeable in the line bucks. After a fumble in the last quarter, Union's line was unable to stand the battering of the heavy St. Lawrence backs, a fact that added consider- able in losing the game. Coach Kuolt and Assistant Coach Brown have found the we-ak places in the team and they expect a great improvement before the Stevens game on Saturday of this week. The teams lined up as follows: ST.

The freshrn.en did not yet lose courage and put up a number of good wrestling matches. While these were in progress the sophomores suddenly discovered that a freshman was painting the Idol red. A great rush to the scene was made by everyone. A snappy con- test ensued during which the sophomores managed to wipe the red paint from the id~l.

The opening week of College this year was as usual made especially interesting by the series of underclass scraps. Both classes showed up well and it was quite uncertain at the start who would win the contests. The first night witnessed the usual worship at the Idol. The sophomores were out in force early and grew impatient for the arrival of the freshmen. However, they were not long in waiting as the enter- ing class soon appeared and made things very inter- esting for them. At last the second year men pre- vailed and the Idol wore a green coat of paint that evening. On awaking next morning the second year men were surprised to find the green coat of paint ex- changed for a red one. In the evening the odds were found to be in favor of the freshmen as far as num- bers were concerned. This was the best scrap of the week and afforded no end of amusement to the crowd of spectators assembled. The fight finally resulted in a victory for the freshmen, though the sophomores battled in a creditable manner. INVITATiON TO UNDERGRADUATES _Sept. 30, 1911 To the Editor of the Corcordiensis: My dear Sir: May I extend through your paper, in be- half of Mrs. Richmond and myself, a cordial invitation to students in all the classes to call upon us at the President's House? We shall be at home every Sunday after- noon from 3:30 until 5, to receive informally any who may be disposed to honor us with their presence. In the past two years it has be_en our- privilege to meet and know many of the undergraduates, and we should be glad that if in the course of this year we might make the personal acquaintance of evyry student in . college. Faithfully yours, CHARLES ALEXANDER RICHMOND. ATHLETIC BOARD MEETS At a meeting of the athletic board held last week, T. S. A. Fairbairn, '12, was reelected manager of the tennis team, and J. A. Royce, 13, was elected assistant manager of the base ball team. Early on Friday afternoon the town people began to gather about the terrace wall to witness the cane rush, the fight which was to decide underclass suprem- acy. At four-thirty, the two lines began to approach each other and in a moment the air was full of tom a- toes and salt bags. The firing continued for a little About eighty Union College freshmen were pleas· antly entertained recently in the parlors of the Union Presbyterian Church by the young people of the church. The church parlor3 were decorated w~ith over five minutes at the end of which time the affair college banners. Games were played and refresh- was called by the officials. The cane rush immediately 1nents were served. \ .. l !

, t THE CONCORDIENSIS 7 PROFESSOR HOFFMAN ·ON COMMI'SSION GOVERNMENT than Boston. This city is also managed by a small board of experts. ''The next city that I visited was Berlin, now the Dr. Frank S. Hoffman, head of the Philosophy De- partment of Union Ccllege, has just returned fvom Eurepe, where he has been making a careful study of municipal conditions. Just before he left this country three months ago he vvas appointed by Mayor Charles C. Duryee as a member of the commission to make recommendations for the revision of the charter ·of .the City of Schenectady. Robert J. Landon is chairman of the commission and among the other members are Prof. Charles P. Steinmetz, ex-Mayor White and Judge Cutler. Dr. Hoffman was selected as the one to visit the European cities and make observations. The commission will meet in a week third largest city in the world, being surpassed only in population by London and New York. The present mayor, now an old man of 70 years, has been in oftice during a large part of its rapid increase in population. He has two .assistants, and in connection w~ith a relatively small city council) manages the city affairs. No whisper of graft or misuse of power came to ,me from any quarter of the oity as [ ·mingled with the or two and at that time Dr. Hoffman will give his report. He is very enthusiastic about the advanced con- ditions of municipal government in Europe and spoke at some length to a reporter for a local newspaper concerning his observations. He said in part : \I began investigating the subject of commission government almost as soon as the steamer left New York, as the mayor of Christiana, Norway, was on board and glad to talk. He had been in this country studying our institutions, particularly our municipal affairs, for the past three month8. For seventeen years he has been n1ayor of Christiana and said he had no idea of resigning his position unless he should receive a higher appointment. He has since been appointed judge of the supreme court and will assume his new duties in October. \Christiana is practically governed by commissiOn. It is a beautiful modern city and no adverse criticism on its government, so far as I know, have ever been made. \On landing in Germany I immediately interviewed several prominent men in Hamburg in regard to their municipal affairs. In 1897 the city was almost devas- tated by the plague. Now it is said by n1any to be the most sanitary, most progressive and most beauti- ful city in the world. It has a population of over one million people, including its suburbs. Over $30,000,- 000 have recently been expended on its harbor. It is governed chiefly by a small body called the senate, whose members are c:.lected for life by the city council. I found no desire whatever on the part of the citizens to have the method of city government changed. people. \Similar experiences I had in Dresden, Leipsic, Munich and other large cities in Germany, wliJ:ich have grown enormouEly in population and conse- quently in difficulty ·of administration in the .last fifteen years. In Germany no one would think of be- incr a candidate for mayor who did not prepare fer it .::> by a university course, and did not have the intention of making it a lifework, like any other profession. \The amount of money some of these cities handle is enormous. In the city of Leipsic, for exarn.ple, there is being built the largest and most expensive railway station in the world. vVhile the state owns the railway, a large share of the money is being handl ~d by the L:eipsic city officials. These officials, being appointed for life, can not be approached by corporate interests with the promise of help in future Elections. \In Germany, only those who pay some taxes have ~ vote for member of the city council. The people be- lieve that every man, by virtue of being a member of the body politic, has the right to vote on what we call state and national issues, but no right to vote on the expenditure of money for local affairs unless he contributes something toward the expenses. \In England, I, of course, made as much of a study as my time albwed of the city governments of Lon- don, and such other cities as Manchester, Liverpool, Edinburgh and Glasgow. All of these cities are gov- erned by a city council, which chooses a smaH nuin- ber of experts to administer the affairs of the city . The mayors are unpaid, and perform chiefly a social function. They are usually men who have served long in the city council, and receive this honor as a reward for long and beneficial service.\ \From Hamburg I went to Copenhagen, and to my surprise, found there one of the most attractive and beautiful cities in Europe, with a population larger In concluding, Dr. Hoffman declared that this country is now passing through the stages of munici- pal government that Europe faced a half century ago. He declared that we must finally come to the same conclusion as they have.; that a small number of paid and permanent official3 is the only way to have a stable and efficient government, and that continual changes of administration are demoralizing.

In the course of his remarks Presi- dent Richmond added a few more words to, as well as endorsing, President Taft's recent contraditions of Richard T. Crane's wild assertions as to the .moral degradation of the students in our American colleges. President Richmond's words on the subject were as follows: \I am glad that President Taft took occasion to con- tradict the wild, muck-raking, crazy statements of Crane. \The a!legations of that man were not at the time true and they are not now. They were simply manu- factured by Crane and if the other manufactures for which he is famous in Chicago were of the same calibre, his name would be unknown. \There is a great improvement in college life all over the country, and in particular right here at Union. The drinker is no longer the idol of the stud- ents, but the clean, upright boy has taken his place. If any of you like a student who imbibes too freely and is a sport in other ways, it is not because of these characteristics, but in spite of them. \Furthermore the sending of private detectives to Harvard college to unearth and expose to the public view all of the nastiness that might exist among a few of the students, was by no means the part of a gentle- man. I have a suggestion for Mr. Crane, although I Garry, Cleveland, 0.; Comerford McLoughlin, Rye; have slight hopes of it ever reaching his ears. If Mr. William C. McMichael, Scotia; George R. Moore, Crane would devote his time, emergy and vast money Scotia; Merton Moore, Potsdam; Edwin A. Norton, Derry, N. H.; Ross E. Nye, Jay; Russell A.

WISE AND OTHE:RWISE Welcome to the class of 19151 The student who· a member of the faculty said got into college on his face must have had crow's feet. \The way to win -the respect of your collegernates is to be a student.\ Prexy. We are glad to be a)Jle to know that a Union man would never be guilty of such an exhibition of low 'Sportsmanship as was shown by a member of the visiting team Saturday, when he cressed the line a little ahead of several Union men who failed to overtake him. That the score did not count must have made him feel rather flat. The spirit shown by the student body Saturday afternoon could not be criticised unfavorably. V. R. Tremper, '13. A. G. Duane, '13. F.

'<IT4c Jlfrcz4matt (!Ilazcs That the registration for first year men is but slightly below the average of freshman classes of the past four years is a source of gratification to the faculty, inasmuch as the requirements and tuition in all courses have been considerably advanced over last year. The class numbers ninety-seven .. at the present time and every man now a member of the first year class has fully complied · with the raised standard of admission. Many applications for admission were rejected because of insufficient preparation on the part of the applicant and it was expected that the freshman class would be consider- ably small~r. It is a significant fact that the slight falling off i.P .. numbers is f~lt in the engineering departments and further, that the proportion of academic students is materially larger than last year. The raising of the requirements for admission will eliminate the wholesale dropping of ·students at the dents were commented upon by many spectators at Saturday's game and all had nothing but complimentary remarks to make. What's in a name? We wonder if there isn't something in Star-buck's name that helps to make him the football player that he is.

THE CONCORDIENSIS 11 end of the fall and subsequent terms. It is affirmed that the present freshman class will enter as large a second year class as the present sophomore class. This, of course, will be due to the fact that but few men will be dropped during the first year. UJ~c ((Toucnruitusis Th.e first issue of THE CO·NCORDIENSIS for the fall term is published under new management. The present board of editors was elected at the end of last w!inter t~rm and will continue as such during the fall and winter terms of this coUege year. With the new business managen1ent come changes of more or less importance. Perhaps the greatest change will be no- ted in an increase in reading matter. As now planned the publication will this year present more than fifty inches of reading matter in excess of the paper issued last year. Money is to be expended for cuts and a special cover design will be used within a few issues. It is hoped this season to excell in both quality and quantity all previous volumes of the college weekly. ~rut lUarl ~lllleller, 3Journalist THE CONCORDIENSIS has secured the services of W. ~arl.W eller, a prominent journalist, who will cover the games that the Union football team will play this fall. Mr. Weller will accompany the team on the trips and give an impartial account of all con- tests. By this arrangement the readers of THE CONCORDIENSIS will get accurate reports of the games which will be written by a man well versed in football rules and one who has had wide experi- ence in nevvspaper work. 0\Ying to the cha-nge in proprietorship of the pub* lication office of THE CONCORDIENSIS, new forms had to be made up causing many delays in the first issue. It is expected that future issues will appear Tuesday of each week. A couple canoeing, To change seats essayed;. And these are the bubbles, 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Which, sinking, they made. B. M.

The football team appears to have a snap and aggressiveness that has been lacking in the Garnet elevens of recent years Freshmen must not forget to salute the members of the faculty and speak to all undergraduates whether on the campus or on the street. Freshn1an caps must be worn at all times. TO THE FRESHMEN The freshman, who hired a locker in the aviation shed, should have his money returned for it is understood that the building is up in the air. It has been announced by the sopho- mores that all freshman chapel seats have been sold but there is still some choice standing room left that may be purchased at slightly reduced prices. The freshman, who looked inside the piano in Silliman Hall for his green cap should have considered, before putting the instrument in such an enbarrassing position, that it was an unlikely spot to find stolen goods, for it is an upright p1ano.

PIANOS ELECTRICITY SUC·CEEDS ONE OF UN:lON'S OLDEST CUSTOMS Union will have no more bellringers to toll the col- lege bells for marking the beginning ·and end of reci- tation hours. H. M. Stoller, '13, son of Professor James. H. Stoller of the college faculty, has installed an electrical system· that will ring the bell automatic- ally, doing away with one of Union's oldest ·customs. For years back there has been open to two students each year the positions of bellringers at Union and by this means a large share of their college expenses would be paid. Many students have been enabled to complete a college course by this method, when with- out it graduation would have been impossible. For the' past few years there has been considerable trouble caused by the irregularity in ringing the bells and the recitations were alternately long and short much to the inconvenience of both faculty and stu- dents .. The installation of the electrical apparatus will do away with these annoyances of the past. In speaking of the work to a newspaper representa- tive a few days ago Mr. Stoller said: \'The system will be arranged with a central auto- matic time clock which, by brush contact, will close the circuit. This circuit will in turn close a relay cir- cuit and the current will then go to a regulating pen- dul urn which, by means of a solenoid at the bell, controls the vibration of the clapper. Of course there is an element of experiment about the work, and it will take considerable time to get the system in running order, but it is entirely practical and should be easily perfected.\ The two bells which will be rung by this device are of different size, the larger one on South College being about three feet in diameter at the opening. This bell was made in Troy in 1843. The other bell is on North College and in only a foot and a half in diameter. The bell carries the information that it was made by Meneely, West Troy, N.Y., in 1860. DR. RI'CHMOND HAS MANY DATES Dr. Richmond has the following dates planned for the coming fall : He will be at N.ew York City on October 4, to be present at the 1neeting of the Board of Trustees. On October 5 and 6, he will visit the Univers- ity of Vermont to be present at the inauguration .of President Guy Potter Benton, A. M., LL. D. On October 19, Dr. Richmond will go to the University of Minnesota for the inauguration of George Edgar Vincent as president of that Univers- ity. The next date will be at Wellesely College where Miss Ellen Fitz Pendleton will be installed as presi- dent, on October 19. 'On November 9, 1911, he will be present at the installation of Elmer Ellsworth Brown, Ph. D., LL.D., as chancellor of the University of New York. ~ MUSICAL CLUB COACH CHOSEN The committee in charge of the selection of the coach for the Musical Clubs at Union College has announced the appointment of Charles B. Weikel of Troy, who is connected with the Schenectady Con- servatory of Music. Mr. Weikel comes ,highly recom- mended in musical circles and those who have the affairs of the club in charge have great confidence that he will be able to produce the high quality- of singing that has distinguished Union in years past. .The Musical Association has also selected Eugene D. Fink, last year's manager, to take charge of the business affairs of the association this year. Owing to the fact that L. S. Churchill, who was to have taken this end of the work in hand, has left college, there was no man who had had the experience neces- sary to manage the tours as thoroughly as might be desired.

THE CONCORDIENSIS FOOTBALL RULES INTERPR,ETED Officials Define Forward Pass and Onside Kick --- Protec,tion: :for . the Runner New York, Oct. 3. -The annual conference of thh Football Rul~s Committee with officials, ,coaches and others interested in the sport, for the purpose of explaining any confusing wording of the rules, was held at the Manhattan Hotel and was attended by upward of 125 persons, most of them prominently iden- tified with the game. The attendance was the largest in the history of these annual conferences, and the meeting was one of the shortest. The Forward Pass The forward pass and the onside kick came tn for the greater part of the discussion, due to the fact that ' in many instances the rules regarding these plays may be construed as conflicting with other rules in book. The question of an incomplete forward pass from behind the goal-line brought out much discussion and the interpretation given by the committee was Steefel Bros- ALBANY Buy your new Fall Suit and Topcoat at the Steefel S'tore.

Mailed by request. 2 ; that such a pass would hereafter constitute a safety, whether on first, second or third down. Rules Explained The committee made no new rules, but it explained many points which had. caused uncertainty. Some of the explanatbns were as folbws: A forward pass which goes over the goa 1 1 line or strikes the goal posts is a touchback. A ball is not dead when it strikes an official, and the play must be continued as if the incident had not occurred. A forward pass illegally touched or recovered shall go to the opponents on the spot of the preceding down, instead of where the foul occurred. If a player 1 Jses the pass as he is making a forward pass the official must decide whether or not the ball in leaving his hand goes backward or forward. If forward it constitutes an incomplete forward pass, if backward a fumbl=. If a foul is declared, for which the penalty would carry the ball over the goal line, it shall be placed on the one-yard line. The attention of the officials was called to the rule relating to the protection of the man carrying the ball. It was the consensus of opinion that last year this rule was much abused both by players and officials. Walter Camp interpreted the rule, saying. \The man carrying the ball cannot be helped by any other player, and any man who, whether accident- ly or not, places a hand on the player to assist him, should be imposed with the penalty in every case. This rule should be strictly adhered to in both large and small games, or else roughness will crop out in the game. It is up to the coaches, captains and official3 to insi3t upon strict interpretation of the rules at all tin1es.\ It is claimed that L. V. Redman, a professor at the Kansas University, has discovered a coating for steel and iron which will make it impervious to the ele- . men ts. The coating is enamel. It is claimed that in fifty years the steel skyscrapers will crumble because of oxidization in air and dampness. Redman's invent- ion is said to be a preventive of this. It is claimed that because of the invention the main trouble of steel and concrete makers will be over.

PATTON & _HALL --------- --- -- --- ------ ------- -- CROSS COUNTRY AND TRACK The prospects for a cross-country squad even faster than that of last 'year are bright. Travis is the only man who was in the runs who will not be back. La- Barron, Rogers and Streever are already in good shape and several other men are fighting hard for a place on. the team. Recently LaBarron led a squad around the two mile course in time that was remark- ably good. A large squad has been worked up for the cross-~ountry tramps Dr. MacComber has instituted, and it is hoped even more men will take part ~later. Dr. MacComber said in student meeting recently:~~ There is hardly a man in college who cannot take part in these walks and the shorter runs, and every one will surely be greatly benefited by the exereise.\ Four men will represent Union in cross-country meet against Colgate at Hamilton on Oct. 28 and a week later theywill meet Williams on the home course . Besides the cross-country squad, other track men have been out on the oval. There will be two novice n1eets besides the sophomore-freshman meet on elec- tion day and these will probably bring out much track material. g WHO'S WHO AT UNION.

The Concordiensis VOL. 3'5. :OCTOBER 11, 1911 NO.2 UNIO:N AN'D STEVENS FIGHT TO A STANDST.lLL Each team has chance ,to score but is found wanting at critical moment. By W. Earl Weller Union and Stevens played a no score game on the campus on Saturday. Each team had one chance to score. Stevens' chance came in the :first period of the first half when the Red team brought the ball to Union's twenty-nine yard line and tried for ~field goal. The visitors' line held, but Hen.ry was over anixous and missed his try by a couple of yards. The Union team had its chance in the first period of the second half. Starbuck, working the so called \shoe string\ trick, dodged out of the line and over to the left side line. Stevens' end and tackle did not notice Starbuck's absence and it was only Unions's wide pass that saved them from ignominious defeat. Individual Playing Starbuck again demonstrated his worth. He moves like a streak of lightening, shows wonderful football sense in guessing what the other fellow is going to do and plays the game from start to finish. Pangburn, right tackle for Stevens, appreciated Starbuck's worth and tried to put him out of the game by the some- what questionable method of kicking him in the face. Dewey and Sarvey played their customary fast game, but lack ,of interference gave them few opportunities to cover any distance. Dewey made a couple of sensational plays in running back punts and was warmly cheered once for cutting in on a forwaad pass by Stevens and carrying the ball back fifteen yards through the whcle Red team. Veteran Wing Strong The veteran left wing of Union's line was inpreg- nable, but the more inexperienced right wing was exceptionally weak at times. Ulrich allowed himself to be boxed several times, giving the runner every opportunity of slipping between tackle and end. Most of Stev-ens' ground was gained in this manner. It must · rtot be inferred from this that Ulrich played a poor game. The fact indeed is quite the contrary and individual honors on the line must be apportioned about evenly to Ulrich and Jasolowski. The Stevens team was Elightly heavies than the Garnet eleven, the difference being especially notke· able in the back ,field. The added weight of the Red backfield was a big asset on the slippery can1pus. The Hoboken boys did not act as though they were perfectly acquainted with their own signals and they also showed a slowness in starting their plays that might have been disastrous. Their interference was of the best, however. and their use of the :£orwarcl pass could scarcely be excelled.

President Schurman added that he had made investigation and had watched the conduct of students at Cornell for a long time, and knew there was no intemper- ance at that institution. The American newspapers caine in for several remarks by President Schurman. He said in part: \Imagine a visitor from the planet Mars, who had never been on the earth, trying to ascertain fro1n the newspapers what were the objects and purposes of the institutions called Colleges and Universities. The Martian visitor would be at a great disadvantage to determine this question. The newspaper exists for the sole purpose of giving news. If that With two of the eight football games scheduled for this fall played, Union now faces five consecutive games with the most formidable opponents of the season. The defeat by St. Lawrence by the score of 5 ~ 0 in the opening game of the season brought dis- appointment but not discouragement. The weak points of the team were discovered in this game and towards the elimination of these the coaches worked throughout the week. A marked improvement in the general playing of the team could be seen in the game Saturday. The critical moment in the season has been reached and it is now the time for the Union spirit to assert itself. The squad must not diminish. The enthusiasm of the student body must not decrease. A fast scrub and the support of the student body are two of the greatest factors in n1aking a team. The coaches need these and the team will be a failure without them.

It is frankly admitted that factions in the three upper classes exist and it has even been said that one of these factions in the senior class has been working on a Hdeal\ since last summer. There is a great need of reform at Union in this respect and the only apparently practical method yet devised has been defeated. Those who defeated the ~(no-deal'' compact · have found that the conditions are still ·. unsatisfactory. Why not give the system a chance to show its good points? If, after a fait·. trial of the possibilities contained in the ((no- deal\ it is found that the conditions are worse instead of improved then the repeal of the meas- ure will be in order. big distances. Stevens' signal system seemed to afford amusement for many of the fair sex. Union is especially fortunate in being able to obtain officials thoroughly familiar with football rules. At Rutgers last Saturday ignorance of ,rules on the part of officials caused many disputes and the loss of much time. Sarvey is always a good ground gainer. Union used but one substitute in the game Saturday. Stevens used six. One of the biggest crowds ever gath- ered on the campus witnessed the Union- Stevens game. ~ SATURDAY'S SCORES OF UNION'S OPPONENTS St. Lawrence 5 Rochester 19 Wesleyan 0 Amherst 0 Rutgers 10 Haverford 6 Hobart 0 Colgate 29 Hamilton 0 R.

), THE CONCORDIENSIS ---- -_:_cc:::::-:- :--c- :-.- ------------· :::_-_:-_;:::--- =====================-· ___ . --~_:,_ __ _ 'TIS WELL The following was printed in a recent issue of the A1hany Argus. THE COLLEGE WELL AT UNION Not :long ago I chanced to be One day in old Schenectady, And near the university A sudden, swift thought came to me: Here is a fount of learning I Have even and anon passed by; Right here beneath my very nose The goodly stream of wisdom flows, And I have wandered far afield Neglecting what this stream might yield. ''fis strange what people will ignore The good things at their very door And seek abroad with vision dense For that or far less consequence. Let me explain this for your knowledge. I have a passion for the college, And it impels me to explore Some genial haunt of light and lore Whenever leisure l:ets me roam In quest of change away from home. I have gone far out of my way This tribute of my soul to pay; To feel the spirit that is rife In all the ways of college life. I love to browse in shady nooks Where students congregate with books; I love the walks and haunts and halls And the old, ivied college walls; The work, the sports; and ev'n the don Seems something good to look upon. I knew the students, one and all, Had gone forth from those classic halls, And that, alas! I should not hear The sound of song and college cheer; That I'd not see the busy n1ill Grind out the tasks on College Hill. But stone and greensward were so fair As when the students revelled there; I'd tread their cld accustomed haunts And sense their joy in each plaisance. And so I wandered here and there With loitering footstep, free from care. I marked the sign of progress shown In buildings fair and gate of stone Graven with verses and a name That lustre lends to Union's fame. Tree, shrub and grass and roadway claimed A lingering look; and even the famed Old patient Gargoyle seemed to cry As lonely, grimly he looked down; \Stayi here I am! Don't pass me by. They' ed rather paint me than the town.\ After long rambling midst the halls I strayed beyond the garden walls, And found shut out from strangers sight, A panorama of delight. Flowers lovelier than all the hues That Iris wears swayed in the breeze Aganist the green of shrubs and trees; While wooing winds brought strange per- fume (Soft hint of southern orange bloom) From pale syringa thickly set Near path and wall; and rose-vines met And clambered high and kissed and clung The riot of sweet growths among. A lily bending on its stalk Pointed an Addisonian walk, Green-arched and winding by a stream Bridge-spanned and clear---a place to ·dream And dream again as young hearts do Of fame and power, deeds brave and true, When pondering on the thought of ages Revealed within the printed pages. When elm and chestnut spread their crowns Deep in the woods where whispering sounds--- A dove's low note and down the hill The laughter of a little rill; And. restful seats along the way Beckoned the wayfarer to stay, But too enchanted with my quest I wandered, on nor stopped to rest. At length there rose before my sight A curb of stone with script bedight, So .fitly placed, at first I thought It was a thing by nature wrought; But as I neared it---j.oy to tell, I found it was the college well! Students, my heart went out to you In throbs! So fine a thing to do To build this deep, protecting wall To shield the old spring's rise and fall! For never was there such a drink As gurgles from a spring's cool brink; I knew your loving hearts had lent To every stone a sentiment, And that the waters, crystal-clear, (As to their limpid depths I bent) Would sing your praise for n1any a year. Y e gods! Was ever such a sluice This side the pond! Old boots and shoes, Sticks, mud and ashes, frogs and bugs, Old cans and pitchers, broken jugs, A glove, two footballs, pipes and keys! The cupboard of the Jellybys Was not a circumstance, I swear, To all the truck I saw in there! \It ain't been used since long gone by,\ A gardener said, who heard me sigh. '\Twas the best water hereabout; I wish the folks would clear it out.\ I listened and I turned away Somehow the place seemed not so gay, For that which most my heart did stir Had proved a whited sepulchre. Oh, Prexy! Well we know that you Have many another thing to do; And that to straighten out the coil And loose the knots require some toil. We know that what you've done is more Than ever has been done before; That hand and heart and searching brain United are for Union's gain. We can't expect you in six days To level chasms, mountains raise; But---when you have a breathing spell, Get busy at the College well! Raise havoc with the motley store, Haul out a quart of frogs or more; Fling to the dump the sticks and strings, The crockery and the other things. Sound the deep bedrock, clean and true! Let the bright waters gush anew With old-time zest, and in their freeing Fulfill the purpose of their being. And that the Fates may speed the day Let your petitioner humbly pray. Albany, N.Y. L. S. MAYER. 11

The Garnet teatn also won it in 1908. Other awards of pennants were as follows: track, Colgate; basketball, left open as all cclleges were even; football, Hobart. The selections of a place for the intercollegiate track meet next spring was dis- cussed at some length, but no decision was made.

Pharmacy REMARKS .. _TO FRES:HMEN PRE3IDENf LOWELL OF HARVARD:---\A3 to m~n, you must be able to interpret them and answer their needs without their telling you the whole probl~m; and there ar,e few places where a man has a better chance of learning wisdom by seeing and meeting men than he has here in this university, and most men go through college with:out finding it out a~d a great many find it out only twenty years after they have left college. The only trouble is you do not try hard enough and open your eyes to what is going on about you. The two things that men suffer most from in college are a swelled head and a contracted heart, and these two things are very largely within your own power, and can be easily overcome. Know as many men and as many different kinds of men as you can. You will find it not p~rfcctly easy, but it is be:aus~ there are two dif- ferent factors in the proposition---one is yourself, and the other is the other man. You think you are a lit- tle different from other men. You think you arc more shy. You are not. You are shy, but everybody else is just as shy. I rarely meet anybody who does not think he is a little more shy than other people. But that is all error, for the one thing you learn as you get older is that the world is a great deal warmer- hearted than you thought. It was your own icy ex- terior that caused the trouble. You were freezing the other man and of course he was co 1 i because you were near him. Do not forget that. It is a common idea that people are not very kind, but this is genera- ted largely by our own attitude toward others. The other man is looking out for you in just the same way.\ ---The Harvard Crimson. SECRETARY STOKES OF YALE:---\The greatest hind- rance to making the best use of a university is a false sense of proportion---'! cannot urge you too strongly to get right standards at the outset of your course.' ---Try to' measure values, to test ideals.---Do not let your whole career be hindered by any wrong sense of proportion now.\ SECRETARY STOKES OF YALE:---''The student who does not enjoy the friendships of college life is to be pitied. But friendship 'is to be thought of as a means, albeit a noble one---not an end.' Enjoy your college friendship, but look upon them mainly as a delightful method of increasing your power to help.\ ---Yale Daily News. Y. M. C. A.

OCTOBER 18, 1911 NO.3 WES;LEYAN DEFEATS UNION IN LAST FEW MINUTES ;QF PLAY The Gar-net .·leads heavier tean :by 6 • 3 Score until last period-· Sarvey runs 105 yards for a touchdown. By W. Earl Weller Captain Sellnow's men put up a game fight against Wesleyan ·in Middletown last Saturday and were only defeated in the last period of the last half. For three periods the Tighter Union team withstood the battering of the Wesleyan backs. How well they played is evidenced :by the score of 6 to 3 in favor of the Garnet at the end of the third period. In the last quarter of the game when Union's tired line simply could not hold, Wesleyan was able to carry the ball over the line three times and to kick two goals for a total .of seventeen :points, making the total score 20 to 6 in favor of the Red and Black. Wesleyan Uses Direct Pass Every man on the Union team played football all the time and it was football against odds at that. The Wesleyan backs were big, strapping fellows and n1ust have averaged about 185 or 190 pounds in their football togs. They used a direct pass from centre to the man who was to carry the ball, a method that goal, Ross doing the kicking. This was the only score until the middle af the third quarter. Then Union after a desperate defense on its own five yard line captured the ball on a fumble .and carried it 105 yards for a touchdown. Sarvey's quickness was accountable for the score. The little half-back had the ball before it had touched the ground and was around the Wesleyan line and part way down the field before the Red team realized what had happened. Riley and Coward raced the whole distance behind Sarvey and were ready to render assistance had it been needed. Two blocked punts and an intercepted forward pass gave Wesleyan seventeen points in the last period. The game was well played and the defeat brings no discredit to Union's eleven, In spite of the fact that the contest was a hard fought one and penalties were a frequent occurance, it was nevertheless remarkably clean, neither team resorting to questionable tactics. While a year is some time to look ahead and while many things may happen before next fall, Saturday's game seemed to say one thing rather plainly and that was that Union will trim Wesleyan on the campus next season. This is a prophesy that will bear watching. The teams lined up as follows. WESLEYAN (20) UNION (6) seemed to give every opportunity for the formation of Diamond, Halvorson Riley effectual iN.terference. The result was that the whole right end backfield hit the line like ·one n1an and it was this Durling, Steebe Ulrich constant hammering that wore out the Garnet team. Twenty-one Wesleyan men figured in the game, practicaHy a fresh team facing the exhausted Union eleven in the last period. Individual Playing Wood at full-back played a great game for the Garnet. He hit the W esley'an line hard and for substantial gains but his chief strength was shown on the defensive. Here he seemed to figure in every play, smashing the red interference and breaking up attack after attack. Ulrich also deserves credit for his defensive work which several times won for him the cheers of the Wesleyan crowd. Dewey, Sarvey and Coward played until they could barely stand.

No coach has been secured as y;et, but it is very probable that \Okie\ Koult,. the football coach, will coach the bask- etball team again. The Armory has again been se- cured and the eight home games will be played there. honors on the home campus. Of these games as many as possible will be played in Baker, manager, and Rice, captain, of the freshmen the evening, as it is not possible to get large audiences football team have written to secure games with Johnstown, Albany and Lansingburg high scnools. GLEE CLUB PROSPECTS The Glee Club under the direction of Leader Van- Arnum and Coach Weikle has been hard at work for the past two weeks. Prospects are very bright for an excellent dub this year but there is still a scarcity of second bases. By the time scheduled for the first concert, the club will probably be in tip-top shape. A new finale and a four part chorus effect are now being tried out. Several cuts have been made and another will take place shortly. But twenty-one men will be taken on trips, seven of these taking double parts. Manager Fink is hard at work on the schedule and prospects are tnost bright for an excellent season.

After several years of unproductive efforts on the part of those interested in forming such an organization, the club pleasantly disappointed sceptical students by staging a huge success during the winter term of last year. Tristram Coffin, (11, president of the association during the period of reconstruction, deserves much credit for. the final self-supporting basis upon which the club now finds itself. Harry R Sawyer, '12, a star in last season(s success, has been elected president and the members of the organ- ization are enthusiastic over the prospects for the coming year. S€veral plans for the presentation of performances are already well under way and now the ultimate success of the present season rests with th.e students. A professional coach will have the club in charge again and music, not yet produced upon the stage, has been written by the author of \The Isle of Spice\\ which may be used in the performance. When the call for candi- dates is made it is hoped that two score or more wilL be forthcoming .from the student body.

THE CONCORDIENSIS f\ Jri~t fnr 1Jlittrar~ ~ark. A prize for literary work in connection with THE CONCORDIENSIS, which is announced in the current issue of the paper, is something of an innovation in the history of our college weekly. [tis through the courtesy of President Richmond that the sum of ten dollars has been turned over to the board of editors for the purpose and the contest will be of great benefit to the publication in fulfilling the idea contained in our aim to be a literary, . as well as a news weekly. As a member of the faculty recently said, our publication should be considered more in the light of a distributer of di- gested news. We realize this and it is veadily seen by :our subscribers that THE CONCORDIENSIS can seldom contain news that 1 has not been pub- lished in the city dailies. The board of editors sincerely appreciate the donation of the prize, which will be an incentive to an increased activity along literary lines among the undergraduates. ~ W~e ~att of tqt J\lliznn- Jffoott ~tbate. The change in the date for the annual Allison-Foote debate from the winter to the fall term will undoubtedly be greatly appreciated by the an- dergraduates, especially those who are directly connected with the debating societies. In making the change the debating council reasoned that, by having the inter-society debate in the fall term, it would give more time to pick carefully the varsity men for the intercollegiate debates. It will a'lso give an opp~rtunity for debating on questions that will later be subjects for these debates. The winter term seems to have more than its share of big dates and to transfer one of the most important events to the preceding tern1 will be appreciated both by the faculty and the students. Because of an increase in matter contained in THE CONCORDIENSIS it has been found impracticable to issue the paper Tuesday. Hereafter Wednesday will be the day of publication.

Abolishe;; Hazing The sophomores of Massa- chusetts Institude of Tech- nology fell in line with the up-to-date trend of college thought by putting itself on record as abolishing all den1onstrations against the freshmen which can be brought into the category of hazing. .

'· 12 THE CONCORDIENSIS NEWS OF THE DEBATERS Union to debate with St. Lawrence-Plans· for the Allison-Poole· Debate At a meeting of the Debatil!l:g Council on 'Thursday, it was decided to open debating relations with St. Lawrence Univer.3ity in accordance with a :Dequest recently received by the Council. WhiTe no definite arrangen1ents have been 1nade as yet, it is probable that a debate will be he'ld at the beginning of the winter ter,m. The annual tri-angu~ar debate will be he1d at the end of the winter term. Hatnilton will send a team here and one of Union's tean1s wiH go to Ccl~ate. It is not definitely known yet whether or nGt there will be a debate with Cornell. The date of the Allison-Foote has been changed. It will be hEld this year after Thanksgiving recess. This will give an opportunity for picking the teams for the intercollegiate debates but it will also cause smne crowding in the schedules of the societies in order to have the requisite number of debates to compete. The outlook for both societies is bright. There is some promising material in the freshman class and new men have also come out from the sophon1ore and upper classes. Each club has had two debates this term. News-photos of Union events sold by Doyle, '10, North Colonnade. Amateur work, special rates.

The gan1e although marred by conEiderable roughness was hard-fought and .exciting throughout. The high schocl was out-played during the entire game, both ort the offence aN:d defense but won on the inability of the sophomores to handle punts and the failure of several forward passes. In the second period the high school recovere::l a fumbl~cl punt on the sophomores fifteen yard line. Here a pretty forward pass was executed for a touchdown. The only allowed score of the game. In the third quarter the sophomores continually threatened Al- bany's goal line but were unable to sccre, being held on the one yard line for downs. The fourth period was a repetition of the third, the sopho1nores scoring a touchdown on a free fumble, Hagar covering the ball. The referee allowed the touchdown only to re- verse his decision on a doubtful technicality within a few minutes. The hi·gh school was given the ball punting out of danger, time being called after the next play. 0 TWO TH·OUSAND VOLUMES FOR COLLEGE LIBRARY Mrs. Sidney G.

= The Concordiensis Vo , L' 3;5 . .. ' ' . OCTOBER 25, 1911 NO.4 UNION LOSES TO RUTGERS IN WELL FOUGHT CONTEST Weight of Opponents and Slippery Field is Cause of the Garnet Defeat B·y W. Earl Weller Union's football team lost to Rutgers on Saturday by a score of 6 to 0. The defeat was due ,mainly to the condition of the fi:eld. Four days steady rain had converted the gridiron, which was only partially cover- ed with sod, into a veritable quagmire in which the known speed of Union's backs and ends was of no use. Their lightness on the other hand was a great dis- advantage in stopping the rushes of their heavier op- ponents and many a time Union's secondary defense was pushed back over the slippery ground for several yards even after the Rutgers runner had been tackled. Rutgers early started to hammer the light Garnet ends. Riley and Starbuck did everything possible to stem the tide, but, unable to side step the inter- ference, they were merely bowled over, the play going through then1 by sheer momentum. Vedder.and Wood were unable to render much assistance in breaking the interference because of their inability to wade through the mud before the play reached the end. Rutgers coEld do nothing with Union's line and made few attempts against it after the first period. Ulrich played a grand game at right tackle, his work being noticeable especially on the defensive. Union tried out the new defense against Rutgers. While the game is a poor one on which to base any conclu- sions, it would seem that the new defense is most successful. One thing is certain. Rutgers could not work a forward pass in the whole game and they tried it five times. Three ofthesepasseswen:notcon1pleted and two were intercepted. Union also tried a new at- tack, all four of the backs forming a line behind the scrimmage: line and the pass going C.irect to the man who was to make the run. Apparently this method is going to work, as Union's interference was the best of the sca~on, r..ot ev.:::n discounting for the condition of the fie:ld. Dewey and Starbuck nearly worked the \shoe string\ trick on the Rutgers team in the second period. The end had drawn away from the line and had a clear field, but the ball was too slippery for good hand- ling and the pass went wrong. A srnall crowd of Union alumni braved the elements and were on the side lines cheering the team. They all expressed satisfaction with the team and were ap- parently agreeably surprised with the spirit the Gar- net team put into the game. When Rutgers scored the first touchdown after a very short period of play- ing time, the hearts of the Union rooters landed in their boots with some of those \dull sickening thuds\ we read about; but the hearts of the men out on the firing line stayed right where they belonged. This· is why the score was six to nothing rather than the 48 or mon~ to nothing that Rutgers expected. The game was studded with those little exciting mom:ents that make football \the\ game. Twice in the third period Rutgers brought the ball deep into Union's territory only to lose it on downs to the Union eleven. 'Once Martin circled Union's right end, avoided Coward's tackle and started down the field for what looked like a certain touchdown. Dewey did a little fast work and nailed Martin from behind on Union's ten yard line. Sarvey did son1e fine work in the punting line, placing his kicks in a manner that was n1ost be- wildering to the Rutgers backs. On a dry field Union would have made considerable distance on on-side kicks. The officiating in the game was most unsatisfac- tory. Penalties were frequent, but the officials seemed unable to hold the players in check, especially in re- gard to holding and off-side work. The teams lined up as follows.

This year they .expect to reach twice that number as the various toreign clubs of the city have offered the use of their rooms while the use of the night school rooms has been promised by Dr. A. R. Burbacher, city superintendent of schools. The work will be carried on among the Italians, Poles and Austrians. Last Sunday, October 22, Rev. Charles G. Sewall, Williams '93, rector of the State St. Presbyterian Church, spoke on \The coUege man and his doubts.\ The coming Sunday, October 29, Mr. Ralph B. Colson, Hamilton '11, will speak on \What it tneans to be a Christian.\ The Y. M. C. A. has also lll.ade .plans for securing noted lecturers to give talks om immigration and other phases of industrial work. A few of the speakers who have been secured are Dr. Edmund A. Steinen of Grinell College, Dr. Peter Roberts who invented the present system for teaching English to foreigners and Mr. Charles Towson, chairrn.an of industrial service moven1ent. A conference was held in Sillman Hall, on Tuesday, October 17, by representatives from all the fraternities and from the neutrals, at which time it was decided to pursue the same plan as last year in the course of Bible study, viz: that all meetings, both of the neutral body in the dormitories and of fraternity men in their respective fraternities, should be led by upper classmen. The normal course for leaders will be a discussion of \The Life of Christ\ o11tlined by Dr. George Kel- logg, head of the Latin department. 0 Johnny-. \Pa what's a bustle?\ Father-((Hush, my boy.

CIVIL ENGINEERS' T:RI!P TO NEW YORK Twelve students from. tne Civil Engineering depart- ment left for New York City last Wednesday evening on an inspection trip to various engineering works in and around New York. The party was accompanied by Professor Lyon, and returned home Saturday evening. Some of the men went to New Brunswick Satu:rday to witness the R.utgers-Union football game . Among the works inspected were the subway con- struction work in Brooklyn, the East River bridges, the United States Navy Ya\I:d in Brooklyn, the garbage disposal plant in Rich:tnond borough, the dock de- partment, and the Pennsylvania railroad yards at Greenville. 9 BUFFALO CLUB ELECTION At the annual meeting of the Buffalo Club of Union College the following .men were elected to office: president, T. S. A. Fairbairn, '12; secretary and treas- urer, W. M. Beck, '13 . The club was founded two years ago. It is now in a very prosperous cond.ition and is recognized by the college as an organization which has a bright future. The following Buffalo men are members: Graduate member, Charles W. Waldron, '09; Beck, Fairbairn, Coward and Shade, '12; Fischle and Dickinson, '13; Ewens, Morgan and Wadsworth, '14; Hauenstein, Vought, Persons, Fischer, Doyle and Baldy, '15. UNION VICTORIOUS IN CROSS CO~UNTRY RUN Although the weather conditions were unfavorable a good sized crowd turned out to see the cross country run with Hamilton on Saturday. Union won by eight points, the score being 18-10. Eggleston of Hamil ton crossed the line first but the next four were Union men, LeBarron, Elmore, Rogers and Tremper. After them came Dayton, Keddy and Matton of Hamilton. The winner's time was twenty minutes ·and fifty-nine seconds. ~ UNDERCLASS FOOTBALL The sophomore football team played its first game in Albany on Columbus Day. The Albany high school won the game by the score 5- 0. Last Friday the team played in Amsterdam. The score was 5 to 0. in favor of sophomores. The freshmen won their game from Lansingburg high school in the first period of play. After this goal no further score was made so the final result was 6-0. Huthsteiner carried the ball over the line for the fresh- men and then kicked the goal. The freshman team went to Saratoga on Saturday, October 14th. The score there was 16 - 5 in favor of the freshmen. The team has a game scheduled with Lansingburg high school to be played soon. Both the sophomore and the freshman teams will play the Edison Drafting school and the games will take place on the campus but the dates have not been definitely decided upon. NEW RECORD SYSTEM FOR UNDERCLASSMEN At the suggestion of Dr. Rogers '77 and Dr. Duane '78 the faculty has adopted a system of keeping an accurate record of the scholarship of the two under- classes throughout the term. At the end of every n1onth the members of the faculty will send the marks of each sophomore to the office where such marks will be kept on record and at the disposal of frater- nity upper classmen and others interested in them. Much the same plan will be followed for the fresh- men except that their reports will be turned in every two weeks. This should prove very beneficial as it will enable a man to find out just how he stands with- out causing any inconvenience.

Competition for appointment is neccessary to carry on the work of the paper in an efficient manner, and it naturally follows that the greater the competitiom the greater will be the efficiency. There is room for several more registrations from among the freshmen and sophomore classes and it is hoped that those among the first and second year men who are interested in literary work, especially along newspaper lines, will appear at the next meeting of the board, which occurs in Silliman Hall, at 7:15, Monday evening, October 30th. There is probably no other college activity that has more advantages than the competition for positions on THE CONCORDIENSIS board. To those who have previously been engaged in newspaper work the competition should particularly appeal; and those who take up reporting for the first time will find ample opportunity to get practical experience not found in

THE CONCORDIENSIS any other college activity. There is doubtless much dormant ability to be found in scores of students, who have never suspected that they have even the slightest leaning towards newspaper work. THE CONCORDIENSIS competition will develop this ability and may disclose talent unkown to the possessor. CONCORDIENSIS, competition keeps a student continually informed upon matters of interest to the undergraduates. It does much to bring him into personal contact with the members of the faculty and affords hin1 an opportunity of meeting many students in all classes. [tis valuable training in the expression of ideas and is found serviceable throughout the literary side of the college course. It is a training in accurate thinking and accurate expression, and it is one of the best ways of showing loyalty to Union. ~ Wire ~curti1£ of tl1e ~r~£n. Considerable comment has been made recently in regard to the regu- lation freshman cap because of a tendency among a few of the first year students to discard the green head piece upon frequent occasions. It seems almost unnecessary to have to remind the members of the class of 1915 that there is an existing rule compelling freshmen to wear the designated cap. The ruie was passed some years ago and strict compliance with it is expected. The recent amendment to the rule, by which the first year men are permitted to discard the green cap on Sunday, is a decided concession and due appreciation of the seventh-day relief shoufd be shown by rigorous observance of the six-day rule. As it was stated at the meeting of the stu- dent body, violation of the rule will result in the w~ithdrawal of the Sunday privilege. SMOKING RESTRICTED Smoking ic;; un<der a ban at Cclumbia University, except within certain restricted areas. The incoming horde of students who arrived at th~ university found posted in conspicuous places in ~n of the university buildings the following notice: \At a meeting of the com- I\!littee of bui-lcings and grounds hdd on F cbruary 28, 1911, the following resc- -- ~------ ~--- ---~----- lution was adopted: Re- solved, That on and after July 1, 1911, smoking be pro- hibited in all parts of the library building and in all lecture-rooms, seminary- rooms, reading-rooms, lab- sratories and store-rooms and also in all halls, lava- tories, corridors and stair- ways above the basement in all other university buildings, except Earl Hall, the Faculty Club, the Com1nons and the residence halls.' The trus- tees ask for the loyal co-oper- ation of alt members of the university in the strict en- forcement of the above reg- ulation.\ Hitherto smokers have en- joyed practically a free rein in the Morningside Heights buildings, and even during examinations it was not un- common to see half a dass in shirt ~leeves pulling at pipe, cigar or cigarette. 11
