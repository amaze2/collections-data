President Hull Releases Top Ten Goals for 1991-1992 By Love Dog Snooze Editor 1 0) During the early rounds of the 1991-92 supplemental administrative players draft, Union will seek to trade Fred Alford, dean of students, for a 15th round pick in the 1992-93 entry draft, and 56 1/2 tons of surplus Soviet grain (to be strategically transferred to the meal plan for use in low cost, high fiber dietary meals). 9) In an attempt to curtail spending by trustees and traveling members of the administration, Union will lay down a $15 million retainer fee with Sununu Travel Inc., which will make all travel arrangements. 8) The Greek system will be eliminated by name; thus allowing other Union College organizations to take credit for the $30,000 raised annually for charity. This in tum will help promulgate the idea that Greeks really don't do anything and allow the administration to peacefully eliminate the Greek system altogether. 7) As complaints about the Issue This In Not: current housing situation continue to run rampant, Union will begin construction on a new dormitory next year. The new project will be built underground creating a twofold subliminal effect on the Union students. First, placing the housing underground will cause students to believe that there is still a housing problem, thus making them believe that they actually want to live on campus. Second, by living underground, most students, particularly freshmen, will develop the belief that their views should stay underground a moment to ponder? as well, thus creating a politically peaceful climate on campus. 6) With the entrance of a mandatory term abroad program, the following new, exciting, and challenging tenns abroad will be added to the Union list: University of Pickham Notch New Hampshire; The Lake Nosbonsing Aquatics Institue of Ontario; Truck Masters of America; APEX Technical Schools: Governmental Continued on Page 4 Sports section dum;ped for Liberal Sound--off ... page 47 The True Meaning Of Life by Mutt Sanderson's Brother Assoc. Green Eyed Lady Last week a letter was written to the Concordiensis which criticized a reporter's inaccuracy pertaining to an article that was written two weeks ago. This reporter went to all the right sources but was given the wrong information. This article is not only a response to that letter but it is also a message to those people who find a sort of ecstasy in criticizing the actions or work of others. The message here is a simple one. Relax! It seems that the critics of Union College need to slow down and look positively at life before it's too late. So I made a mistake. I'm sorry bat now I feel it's my duty to steer the critics in the right direction. Don't get me wrong; without critics we would probably live in an imperfect society. However, my point is that an abundance of criticism is unhealthy so more attention ought to be paid to the more pleasurable things in life at good old U. Don't forget your friends, or blue skies, or the flowers in front of Schaffer Library. Don't forget dew glistening on freshly cut grass, Marge at West, or spring time sunsets.

U.RII\IAL Y!il!i Frank Drebin Distordy's Ultimate Game by Knox Overstreet Administrative Rile Censor The stage for this contest ha.d to be an arena that encom- passes both the magnitude and regality of such an event-. a sight of unmatched glory, tradition, and size. The choice must warrant the expos.ure and attention of a worldwide spectrum, for the h<lppe-nings here will serve as a microcosm of current global status. The decision is simple: the L.A. Coliseum in Los Angeles, California. A place where Olympic records and gold medals have been achieved, Super Bowls decided, and (hopefully in the near future) where Hulk Hogan wiU defend his World Wresding Federation title. A record crowd of 150,514 has gathered to witness an aggregate test of will that travels far beyond the game of basketball and its 90 foot parameters. This partisan, flag-waving mass is here to attest to a clash of culture, East meets West, the virtue of democracy against those who despise it. The United States will field a five man hoop team that includes our most visible public officials-a cast that will no doubt incite (for very different reasons) an already partisan crowd. The visitors will send a squad that will resemble the sordid tactics of the NBA's Detroit Pistons. It should prove to be a memorable summer afternoon-Dick, Vitale and J()hn Madden (who else?) han<lle the television and radio broaclcast amidst a now frenzied background .... (Madden) \Welcome sports enthusiasts and political watchers alike for this unprecedented display of athleticism afld national spirit. Never before has such a wide array of pD'Iitical talent come together te> demonstrate just which cultttre is better, East or West.\ In a symbolic game of basketball, al'l questions will be answerecl, all debate quelled. In its wake, a victorious team Pong Result: Cooter 15 C.A.K. ll (and country) and a world over will know exactly where the truest ideole>gy stands. Following a rousing rendition ()f 'America the Beautiful' sting by Whitney Houston a11d Billy Joel, center stage is turned 'over to renowne<l ring announcer Michael Buffer for the starting lineups. (Buffer) \Ladies and gentlemen, a hearty American welcome to each and every one of you for this cataclysmic clash of wilL Now, from the L.A. Colisettm in the great state of California .... LLLLLLET'S GET READY TO RUMELLLLE, forty minutes of ftirious basketball to decide once and for all who teaches and fosters the most virtuous cultural thinking.\ \Introducing first the visitors, known as the Eastern Invaders (chorus of boos). Tbis five includes a frightening cast of Iraqi military members: at guard, Colonel Mustafa and General Adnan. The forwards include Captain Aziz and Sergeant Slaughter (a former drill sergeant-turned Iraqi sympathizer). \The center is straight from Baghdad, 6 foot, 1 inch number double zero Saddam Hussein (you'd think that this guy has had enough from us).\ \Now for your American Patriots (crowd erupts). At guard from the Hoosier state of Indiana \Dashing\ Dan Quayle. The other guard is straight off of a nearby Colorado ski slope, \The Enforcer\ John Sununu. \At forward, is the \Galloping Greek\ Mike Dukakis (after all, he has nothing better to do these days). The other forward thrives on challenge though this time its an athletic one), Stormin' Norman Schwarzkopf. The center is the kingpin himself, number one, George Bush.\ The stage has been set, the two officials assigned to keep things in order, former drug czar William Bennett and once head of the FBI J. Edgar Hoover are ready to toss the first ball up. The opening stanza, as expected, is dominated by the finely tuned American machine.

Dan Quayle, using his superior intellect and precision passing, vaults his team out to a commanding 26-10 lead (after all he is a boy among men). Bush and Stormin' Norman play the role of psychological instigators, threatening yet another blockade against the Iraqi mainland. Dukakis attempts to chorus in on th.is verbal warfare, but as usual few are listening. Finally, using an arsenal that involves exploitation of Sununu's weak cardiovascular NEWS FLASH: Idel stolen by Brooding Bunch of N.I.B.s. system and roughhouse tactics that slip the eyes of Hoover (I wonder how?), the Iraqi's climb back into the game. A last second, running one- handed buzzer beater by Saddam closes the scoring and half amidst a collective bevy of jeers. The scoreboard reads: Americans 48, Iraq 46. The second session has all the makings for a classic and unforgettable battle. The U.S. has different ideas, though, as they slowly take complete charge of the afternoon's festivities. Vitale's call: \Here comes the green, black, and red attack. .. Adnan at center passing it in far side-it gets by the hands of Slaughter aaand Dukakis to Norman up the middle to Quayle back 'to Norman he commandeers a break Back to Danny Quayle who dribbles behind his back away from Aziz, he gets a break, brings it in over uhe foul line, flips it over to Stormin' who scorrres! Ex:tend·ing his arms, Norman yells, 'you don't need any more proof, right now.'\ As the final seconds trickle down, here is just a microcosm of the bad fortune and terrible humiliation suffered by the Iraqis. Madden's call, as he describes how Saddam had an open chance to score the game's final tally but-predictably-failed. \Bush is advancing over half court.. .oh no he fell! Saddam is in alone, he shoots he score- ohhh he should have put the ball in the unguarded baske- now he does ... shoot it wide. It doesn't matter 3-2-l it's all over.\ The Americans win in a convincing 92-70 thrashing. The MVP of the con test, you're wondering? None other than Dan Quayle-proving beyond a shadow of a doubt that he belongs in those crucial Cabinet meetings. As for Saddam and his crew they must retreat once again (seems to be happening often lately). They were the losers in Distordy's Ultimate Game. Good Riddance once and for all!

June 6, 1991 Administration Surprises Geeks by Spanky Lil' Rascals Corre~pondent The administration this past weekend confro.n ted the eighteen fraternities in a startling change of sttategy. In an open meeting, the administrati.on surprised fraternity leaders by submitting a concise, yet powerfu1 1 proposal. Rather titan work underhandedly, as.rnany critics have argued, tbe administration dropped the facade and approached the leaders with the following proposal: \In accordance with the rules of the college, both standing and ad-hoc, it appears to be in the interest of the college community to henceforth ask that the eighteen recognized fraternities evacuate the campus in any expedient manner to insure that all non-Greek members' social and academic growth be augmented to its maximum.\ At first the fraternity leaders were pleased with the administration's forwardness, but after sifting through the proposal, it was found not to be that advantageous. When questioned, one fraternity leader remarked, \It's about time they're being honest, but things seemed more placid when (the administration) lied to everyone.\ Critics of this proposal argued that the fraternities are a necessary part of Union College. It was pointed out that the fraternities helped raise approximately $35~000 this year alone. Further, it was cited that fraternities s11pply the social life, often free cf charge. ' In a random survey, 90% of all students approved of the existence of fraternities on campus. 6% did not care if fraternities existed or not, and a minor 4% strongly disliked fraternities. Nevertheless, . armed with these arguments, the proponents of tile proposal ~( appeared stronger. To refute the philanthropic tendencies of the fraternities, the administration argued that because none of the money raised directly benefited the college, the charities raised are inconsequential. Furthermore, as for the fraternities being the social magnet, the administration pointed out the college supplies more than enough social life. It is the student's fault, they argue, that he or she does not take advantage of the ample coffeehouses, cabarets, or guest lectures. If the student chooses to do something else, it was also noted, there is an entire city to explore. The administration suggested an off-campus movie, a visit to Proctor's, or a casual stroll through the Schenectady Community Library. \Be imaginative,\ an administrative official commented. As for the survey, because it was done by amateurs, the results might be too erroneous with which to work. If the fraternities leave, the proponents of the proposal will win a great battle, for they believe that they would make Union College a better learning · environment. One student favoring this mandate commented that once the fraternities are non-existent, \there will be no alcohol abuse, no sexual harassment, no fights, no elitism, no racism, no people flying through glass windows, everyone living in a coeducational environment and there social harmony would run rampant.\ When asked what he plans on doing to fulfill his social life he remarked, \There . always is time to correct other wrongs here at Union. For example, the statue in front of Science and Engineering . belongs in a land fill. Another tradition to be lost? INDIAN BLANKET.

The Year In Review Continued from Page 1.2 drinking man myself, 1 think it's great that in spite of the fact that the school is aware that all of the fraternities serve minors, the college plans to t.:·eat this one case as ·an isolated incident.\ The senator added that Union might have broken into the top five had President Hull not dismissed rumors that he was plmming to open a ·campus bar. As for next year, Ted stated that Union's reputation and status on his list will only remain high if Hull acts accordingly. Lastly he urged that \the school strongly reconsider its stance on CAMP UNION.\ In other campus news, Distord iensis has learned that the missing workers, who are supposed to have been restoring the Nou Memorial, are actually in Paris, France. While the crew desired to complete the work on the·, historic monument, they had no choice in the matter. Apparently, in the fine print of . the contract which they had signed with Union College, President Hull had inserted a clause which mandated that they take a term abroad. That Hull was able to enforce the terms of this contract is proof that \if at first U don't succeed, try, try again.\ The last bit of big news to hit the campus this year was the retirement of Dean of Admissions Ken Nourse. In his place the school has hired Daniel ·Lundquist who is leaving behind his post at the University of Pennsylvania. Lundquist was spotted moving into his new office this past week, adorned in a Chi Psi sweatshirt and a Union Hockey cap. The new dean seemed very enthusiastic about the new Division I hockey program, slating that he believed there to be about twenty new hockey players coming in with the new freshman class. When asked if he had any specific philosophy about the admissions process, Lundquist replied that his slogan would be, \If you can't beat us on the ice, beat us off.\ In a demonstration · of unselfishness, helping Lundquist unload his things, was none other than Union College Hockey coach Bruce Delventhal, who openly responded to circulatin& rumors that these new players might not meet Union's academic standards. \It's been a load off all of our backs that we don't have to take SAT's into consideration.\ !il\lEW!i Heads Up For New Goals . Continued from Page 1.2 Internships at the U.S. Institute in Baghdad; Idaho College of Potato Cultivation. Despite rum.ors, none of the aforementioned programs were chosen as a result of Roger Hull's financial and spiritual ties with them. 5) Students returning from term abroad programs will not be granted en-campus housing due to the housing shortage. Students may apply to live on campus. The application process involves personal interview with Roger Hull, student evaluations of the returning student, personal interview with James Underwood, a one-on-one iron man triathalon vs. Roger Hull, and a faculty vote which will have absolutely no bearing whatsoever on his decision. 4) In order to cut costs in the fiscal budget, the current meal card system will be scrapped and Union will return to the more cost effective barter system. Prices for meals will vary depending on mood of barter collector, the current climate, and if you have good stuff. 3) As the College moves towards Division I hockey, Union continues to support the purity of amateur athletic status and thus stands firm by its policy of \no scholarships.\ However, in order to generate more capital and make the College more well known, the players' jerseys next year wm sport sponsorships from Slim- Fast, Goodyear Tire, Mike's Dogs, and •Red Man Chewing Tobacco (long ·cut}. 2) In an attempt to expand . social alternatives at Union and simultaneously promote the revamped use of the old Beta Theta Pi h<)Use, Union will : · offer three new ])rograms at the facility.

Union College will be hosting various seminars related to these events. A crosstalk will center around the theme, \The Roommate·- You Never Know Who.

Here he made such a commotion about a stupid chain link fence having to be removed, but he was unable to involve himself in some of the more serious matters; i.e., international espionage, that were developing on campus. The future of Ed Menke and Margie will certainly be a prosperous one. Both have a special diplomatic immunity and will be subject to n() punishments, except an overdue parking ticket Ed owes to campus security for parking the van witlt the supersonic radar transmitter on the grass. Margie has already begun to write her life story entitled .'Boy Did I J>tit One Over on You Guys.' Ed has been hired by Washington for a high paying positi()n with special intelligence. Both Ed and Margie will be appearing next week on the. Oprah Winfrey Show. When asked for a comment on the situati()n, Ed summed up his feelings by saying, \College is a place to basically drink a lotand experience life.

Her head was turned in .l he other dir~ction, but she is sly and managed to see one criminal att0mptlng an escape nut uf the comer of her eye. The culprit was sneakily making his way out the door with bananas hidden b~neath his black leather jacket No it was not James Dean as marge was hoping, but our vc~y own Russian exchange student Andrcy. \Aha said' Marge wtth devilish delight, \I'm gonna bust his little banana smuggling butt ... \ Her screeching voice wailed throughout the cafeterill, \'What are you doing?n \Nothing came tile reply from an innocent f~ce shyly looking downward.

Although Trish had had her eye on the hot stud we have come to know as Andrey since fall term, she did not a.pJJeal to him for reasons he did not want to go into detail about. Andrey's only reply \Vas that his attraction was for his 'beloved Margie' as lle fondly refers to her. (Too \bad for Trish, she will have t<l find another unsuspecting young male.) It did not take too }()ng for Andrey to realize the great opportunity that this lo-ve affair opened up for him. N()w he found someone to mury so that he could get his green card to stay in the U.S. Ancl with his wife being a West · 'Orker he could attend Unio11 fur free~ His plot was perfect except for one thing: Marge did not want to reveal the relationship publicly due to the extremely large age difference. So Andrey thougltt and schemed very carefully. Holding her at gun Jloint with the watergun just woald not work for this situation. He invited her up to his r<Jom one Friday evening while tbe rest of Webster's party animals were out having a wild time. It was his claim that he wanted to defrost a loaf of Russian bread for her to taste, but he had ulterior motives for asking her to his bedroom, as we know all men do .... Opening his only authentic bottle of Russian vodka, he began to ply her with White Russians, until pretty soon she was doing straight shots and taking a swig or two directly from the bottle. When she wailed with delight and flopped her drunken body down on the red satin sheets of Andrey's bed, he took advantage of the moment. .. \Margie darling, will you marry me? I promise there will be no problems regarding my past work with the KGB ... \ Marge looked up at him lovingly. \Wheeeeeh!!\ shouted Marge with ecstasy. Of course Andrey assumed this was her American mating call and. .. \ - slow as usual. As for Andtey's best man, he desired a guy who represents all that Andrey admires in American society: money, food, and good women (pretty much what every man values). It was a long selection process, as Andrey is not used to having a choice in decisions like these, but he found a perfect candidate right here in wonderful Schenectady. He chose the fry cook at Wonder Eurger, not only a fine entrepreneur, but· one who loves food and knows the art of showing the Albany Street women a good time (if you get what I mean!). There is debate over their choice as a first song to dance together. Marge has her heart set on\These Boots Were Made for Walking All Over You ... ,\ but Andrey is still partial to \Shout at the Devil\ by Motley Crue. It will be decided at a later date, but the couple '·\·• .... ·\.·· .J \ .-r . • -- ~:f.. \Margie I'm your super he.ro ... \ rushed to grab her and kiss her. Many plans had to be made for the wedding. Although Marge wanted the jealous Trish to be maid of honor, Trish refused to tone her hair down for the occasion which was to be a \small scalen affair. She had to choose the evening Dutch Hollow women to be her bridesmaids; at least they would take their sweet time going down the aisle ... nice and would like to invite everyone to participate in a campus wide conga line around the Nott Memorial.

They hope to win an all expenses paid trip to the 'Banana Republic' to commemorate the unique way in which they fell in love. Andrey is very anxious to teach Margie how to 'get the most out of your banana' by eating it from bottom to top. Although Marge's dream of Marrying M.C. Hammer will have to be put on the back burner, she is certain that the marriage will be her best career move yet. 'Better than West Dining' you ask yourself. Yes, h'er new job will be modelling for centerfold pinups in the famous Russian magazine Andrey. (Editor's Note: There really is such a magazine--the equivalent of Playboy in America..) Marge will also b~ Andrey's main subject for testing out experimental products from his very own \preservative\ factory. Marge prefers her traditional white West jacket to a formal wedding gown, but Andrey has other plans for her attire. He says with a leering grin, \If she HAS to wear something at all, I would prefer her outfit to be something lacy, but slutty Get a new position on life I from Madonna's summer 'Immaculate Seduction Collection'. n Perhaps President Hull will take this opportunity to congratulate the newlyweds and follow up on one of his infamous ideas, \killing\ two birds with one st;one as they say. He should \open the college to the community .. by hosting a reception at his own house. The guest list should include of course all of Schenectady's finest: drunks, druggies, illegal weapons operators, the rapists, and the murderers. It would be in the best interest of campus safety though, to leave the serial killers off the guest list as we would not want a tragedy to occur with HuH's kitchen knives. And physical vlant had better start nailing everything down. Of course, it would not - be totally ridiculous to think that a professional hit man may be hired by any number of people on campus to enter the ev'ent as a mere grand larceny criminal in an attempt to eliminate the controversial Roger Hull ... It is true what they say-- opposites do attract. How else can you explain a handsome, young, carefree, fondling, heavy metal loving Russian to fall in love with our Marge. Andrey a~d Marge are very happy together and are wished much happiness as husband and wife. May there never be a dull moment in their future. May they both get earphones as a wedding gift so they won't have to fight about music on the stereo. May Andrey's \Book & Video Society\ catalog arrive promptly every month just in case Marge has a headache. May Andrey's supply of 99 \preservatives\ be enough to last at least through their honeymoon. (You never know, Marge could turn out to be an animal!!) And may all their troubles be \little ones.

6, 1'991 II\IVIROM'II\IT IDistllrbirttnis 9.6 WHAT CAI\I U O,O? Bookstore and Dining Services Bogged Down With Work 1995 Slated as First Year To Care About The Environment By Greta Greenthumb The Directors of the School Bookstore and Dining Services have announced an innovative new plan to bring themselves in line with the environmentally responsible behavior found at other schools. The plan, affectionately called Getting Off Our Lazy Asses (GOLA)~ is scheduled to be phased in, with phase one to beg.in in 199 5 and phase two to be initiated. in 2005. Environmentalist students had hoped to convince Dining Services and the Bookstore to begin phasing out their current wasteful practices, but threw up their lunches (and arms) all over everyone after Janet Grey had purposely served meatloaf at the negotiations .session. The negotiations took an unexpected tum when Jon Meier, Student Trustee, decided to head the s~udent environmental lobby. \I decided that it was time .to take a firm stand on this ever so important issue,\ said Meier, who also added, \besides Norton Reamer told me it would be a good idea.\ It is believed that Meier is trying to dispel the popular conception · that the student government is an ineffective ann of the administration. \It's good to see John fmally taking a stand and shouting for what I believe in,\ commented Reamer. Reamer is a respected environmentalist, known e~ially for his staunch opposition to the use of Chem-Lawn treatment on .campus gt:ounds, particularly prior to Homecoming, ReUnion Weekend, Parents Weekend~ and other money-grubbing opportunities. The Bookstore requested that any plan be put off until late in the decade, due to the extensive retraining of employees that would be required. Student advocates were seeking the replacement of the disposable (and rarely recycled) plastic bags currently used. Eli Majlaton, Manager of the Bookstore, stated his opposition to this demand. \It's ridiculous! Today they want us to switch to canvas bags. What next? WiU we be required to sort our trash? Stock recycled paper at reasonable prices? Stop gouging students for the books that they can't buy anywhere else?\ Reamer cringed at the'talk of potential profit loss at the store. Subsequently, student advocate John Meier acknowledged that the demand was perhaps too extreme. Meier and his stalwarts, affectionately known as \Meier and his 'warts',\ eventually reached a compromise, .in which the Bookstore will raise prices by 50% to offset the costs of buying canvas bags. The price increase will go into effect immediately after the Cash for Books Team\ leaves. At the other side of this two-front war, Dining Services announced that it would consider replacing the plastic utensils used in the Dutch Hollow, provided that next year's senior gift drive g()es toward the purchase of a new fluorescent menu board for the Dutch Hollow. Proceeds from the drive :had been earmarked for the purchase of new light bulbs to replace those burned out in classrooms. Janet Gray refused to back down on another of the student demands, that of reducing the number of disposable cups used on cam}Jus. Riding the recent bandwagon of ignorance, Gray called tlte measure \a quota bill.\ In what Meier has called a \counter-demand Gray issued a plan that would tal::e current policies one step further and require all faculty and staff to be on the meal plan. Meier originally opposed the proposal unconditionally, but when Reamer outlined the potential revenue boon, the student trustee grinned and, in what could almost be called a touching scene, embraced Gray. Roger Hull, the president of the college, issued a statement to the Concordiensis in which he said: \I carefully and extensively reviewed the situation during my morning coffee break, ~nd then I thought about it a little more during my afternoon jog. I have decided to reject all decisions of the concerned groups out of hand. If they want to make a stink about it, let them. Protest is a good thing. I brought it to this college. Actually, bringing activism to campus was the fourth major achievement of my frrst year here.\ When pressed for a more fair solution, one that would have widespread benefit among tile entire community, Hull said, \Sometimes you have to accept mediocrity in order to save face.\ The Ozone Layer • • • Why the Worry? Why The Fuss? by .Isabel C. Liriano Environmental Editor I never thought it would be so easy to convince much of the American population of .such nonsense as the depletion of the Ozone Layer. The ozone layer is the best protection we llave against the sun. When I say best I mean it. Mter all don't we have the best of everything? Our ozone layer is so strong tllat substances which are said to cause its destruction such as aerosol cans, car smoke, gaseous chemicals, p{)llution and CRC's in the environment are what help it test its strength instead. When all these substances ~e used, they are done with the purpose of helping the ozone acquire immunity against bigger and more signiticant threats. For example, if the ozone layer is strong enough to handle so many different chemicals and pollutants at once, the chru).ces of it surviving a nuclear bomb would be greater. The ozone layer is a tightly secured bubble which surrounds OIIT earth. The explanation to the hole which everyone seems to be so afraid of is that it is not permanent. The reason the layer makes a hole is because that is the only way it can release and allow the pollutants to escape. It does close up again. On the other hand, if the ozone were not able to make · that temporary hole and we kept the pollutants it might even be a good idea. We as well as the ozone would become immune, which means we should be prepared for the nuclear bomb ... anyway that's another story. I think that the more we continue these methods and teach children how to in a sense \pollute we would be helping this bubble become tighter and tighter which in the long run will only help us. To many people it may seem that these measures are pretty drastic but we must remember not to judge a book by its cover. Although what we are doing may seem rash and harsh, this is not all it appears to be. Didn't You Know? • That the more you let your water run in the shower, the more of a chance it has got to go through the sewers and recycle itself. The next day you shower with the same water .. • The only reason why stores want you to recycle bottles and cans is so they can refill the cans and keep it for themselves. • Dolphins aren't really killed for tuna. People just say that so eventually others feel pity for them and let them take over the countlry. Soon you will see \Main Language in U.S. -DOLPHIN\. • The same company that makes brown bags make the good to the earth bag. The more good to earth bags you buy, the more money they get. • Aerosol helps tests the strength of the ozone layer and its ability to resist a nuclear bomb. :; ~ - ' . . . Gone.

Basically what we used to know as quality fast food has taken a turn towards being healthy. It all started with Wendy's big promotion that they used 100% real meat in their hamburgers. Then. like wild fire, every single fast food place started watching what they were serving to their customers. Burger King began cooking real chicken in their chicken tenders and serving salads there. Pizza Hut uses lowfat cheese. McDonalds has made the most changes though. They now have 5 varieties of salads, and a hamburger called \The McLean Deluxe.\ They also use vegetable oil when they cook, for less fat in the food. They even have recyclable bags now, so they arc not only adding years to your life but years to the environmen.t as well. Things have changed so much, I bet the people who work there actually throw out the food that falls on the floor these days. All this makes me wonder what this world has come to now that people actually go to fast food places to stay on a diet. So, this article is dedicated to the memory of Wonder Burger. It was the only place left that had the true characteristics of fast food. The food was the way it should be, with unknown substances for meat, and a lot of chemicals and. grease. Customers could care less \where the beef was.\ Wonder Burger was never concerned with high cholesterol or the greenhouse effect, and that is the way fast food should be. With the condemning of Wonder Burger came the end of. the true, quality fast food era. HAVE YOUR ORDERED THE 1995 FRESHMAN RECORD VET?

June 6, 1991 fDfstnrbirttsis ART!i AI\ID 11\JTERTAYI\IMII\IT ts & 2 Susie A Does Schenectady Movie Review by the late John Holmes Just because I died of AIDS in 1988 doesn't mean I can't still write a decent review of a cult classic. As you may or may not know, in my prime I was one of the greatest porn stars of all time. But I didn't practice safe sex, and so my career took a turn for the worst due to an unforeseen occupational hazard. \Bop 'till you drop.\ That's my motto. Susie Does Schenectady was originally released in 1937 when Schenectady was still considered one of the best places to do it. The movie will be re-released in July, but since I have an \in\ with one of the producers, I was able to get it prematurely. Because I am so excited about the project I just can't keep it under control any longer. So here comes my • t review .... First of all, Ted Turner decided to colorize the picture, which a'l though it is a nice touch, was sort of unnecessary. I mean, skin is skin, rig-ht? Turner also took the liberties - ROTTENDAMN SQ. - . ' . Spring Fling Soapscum The Morning After Stoned Cold What About Up The Butt Bob? Still Out for Justice of making Susie a redhead .. .! could hav.e sworn she was a bleached blond. No matter. Keep your eyes dosed, and it's the same thing. As part of the modernization of Susie does Schenectady, Turner brought a new crew to Union College and spliced the existing film with some updated shots. Turner interviewed students and faculty in order to find out the sexual truths behind the workings of Union, and came to some interesting conclusions. He and his crew went on location with a hidden camera on a Saturday night, this is photo-journalism at its finest. The clips are fabulous, and take you from the \U\ to the gardens of the President's lawn. There is even one daytime shot, during which the administration screws the entire school. Apparently, it happens all the time. As for the acting, I think it's some of the finest I have ever seen in a movie of this quality. I'm sure that members of the Board of Trustees will be recognized this year when the MOHUNKM~L. . . . Roger and Me The Last Dictator Wild Hearts Can Be Broken Roger & Kit Call Theaters for Show Times. r-- m-----------------, I I Idol (or is it Idle?) Awards are announced on June 16. AJ,though they are in Susie Does Schenectady, they constantly claim that they have no control over what happens in the film. The new Susie is also quite outstanding. She is shy about being interviewed, but she did comment that \If it wasn't for Union's fine Liberal Arts program. I wouldn't be the woman I am today.\ Inspirational words from such a down-to-earth kind of scholar. 1 do have on complaint about the movie. The male leads did not seem to have the know- h()W to successfully complete tllis project. Although there were times when tension was built up between the characters, these men did not have the stamina and ability to achieve the correct effect. Their performances were less than consistent. However, overall the film was very fulfilling. Please tune in next week when I will review the sequel to one of my favorite movies, Roger Rabbit Gos to College. I heard it was a let down.

Starting next year, Union will be a part of the ECAC Atlantic Division. The other schools in this league are Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Oxford, Cambridge, and the University of Tampa. \We are pleased with the company we are in,\ says Sak:ana. \It will bring added lustre to our own fine institution.\ After the decision came out reporters stormed the President's bouse to demand satisfaction. Hull was unavail- able for comment, but his wife was quoted as saying, \Well he's the President!\ Many people are not well versed in the game of Tiddly- Winks. It takes razor sharp precision to send the projectile into its final goal. Once people found out about the need for extraordinary dexterity, es- pecially since they are going to the Division I level, it brought up many different questions as in the friendly confines of the Tiddly-Winkarena The Women's team is being looked at under mucb more scrutiny. An investigation into the recent class of recruits is sure to find its way onto sports sections across the nation. This year the Athletic board by- passed Canada, by-passed Europe, and went straight for the gold in Asia. Unicn was blessed with the acquisition of three fine athletes. This triumvirate, also known as the Far Eastern Express, will make up Union's top three spots. At this emotional press conference, many members of the Union voiced their opinions about the radical development. The press was extremely livid at the decision which appointed Lee Bloomrosenrosen as head coach. A local sports enthusiast, who wished to remain nameless, commented on the need. for a tough, demanding head coach who was not afraid to let the chips fly (pardon the pun). He agreed that Rosenrosen's time would best serve the Union community if he arranged tables in the College Center instead of taking on the rigors of this new Olympic sport. Kit Hathaway was the other candidate for head coach who was given strong consideration. After a study which revealed that 92 percent of the student body supported Hathaway, and 96 percent of the Athletic department begged for his appointment to the position, President Hull came out with a decision of his own. Hull believed that a head coach's appointment should be based on past performance, looks, and well basically his whim. Women's Starters Heza Bobo, Jen Joyce, and Besu Foley. to recruiting procedures. The Men's team is looking good with many on campus acquisitions. The Varsity squad is made up of captain Neal Walkoff, a steady competitor who should provide much leadership. The second shooter is Paul Sullivan. This kid is a Natural athlete who fills in the number two spot rather nicely. Freshman sensation Mike Andelman is the first man off the bench. After a career threatening ankle injury diverted him away from basketball, Milce found solace Support Heza Bobo, Jen Joyce, and Besu Foley are pictured posing in their warm-up attire at the recent press conference. They . are holding an open practice on Saturday, June 8 and if you think that these warm-up suits are sexy, just wait until you see the unifonns! The outlook for this program is still up in the air. The opportunity is there for Union to be thrust into the limelight. This sportscaster waits with baited breath as the Union Tiddly-Wink team heads out into its virgin season. Union Sports
