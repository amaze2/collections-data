__ , I : I I I COLGATE FIRST Vol. LXXIV, No. 12 Mountebanks In Post-war Season Feature O'Neill's One-Act Sea Plays The Mountebanks opened their post-war season in Hanna Hall this week as the curtain rose on their first production since 1942, Eugene O'Neill's \S.S. Glencairn\ series The nightly performances of the show, which opened on Wednesday, Decemb-er 4, will continue up to and including Monday, December 9, with the exception of Sunday, December 8. The two and a half hour show consists of three of the four one- act plays which O'Neill wrote un- der the title \S.S. Glencairn.\ The series portrays life as it exists for the mixed nationalities and person- alities of the merchant marin.ers of a British tramp steamer. The three acts are entitled \Bound East for Cardiff,\ \In the Zone,\ and \The Long Voyage Home,\ and the time of the action is the period preceding and during the :first World War. Buren Robbins Coaclling Production manager for the show is the Mountebanks' president, Roland Baldwin, who was a mem- ber of the group before its dis- bandment in 1942. Assisting him are Vincent De Baun, Robert Sherwood, James Lemke, John Hebert, and Robert McNulty. Fac- ulty adviser for the organization is Mr. Buren Robbins, who joined the faculty in September as assistant professor of speech, radio, and theater. Besides assisting in the produc- tion of the show, Vin DeBaun also carries a dual assignment in the cast, playing the parts of \Cooky\ and \The Captain\. De Baun has had previous experience in summer theater work. Jack Hebert also has a role in the show, being cast a:; \Smitty\. Opening Date Delayed Earlier in the season it was an- nounced that the show would be presented for six nights starting November 20th. However, the dif- ficulties attending the refurbishing of the group's playhouse, Hanna Hall, after it had suffered the ravages of three years of Navy use as a storeroom, were so numerous and complex that the opening date had to be delayed two weeks. One of the chief obstacles was the proscenium arch, which was in a dilapidated condition. Promises of the Administration that a new proscenium would be construded have been unfulfiU.ed so far, and it was decided to stage the show without it. Other difficulties were encoun- tered in properties, sets, and elec- trical equipment. Carefully stored away when the group disbanded in 1942, most of the equipment and properties were lost or stolen dur- ing the intervening years, and the small amount recovered when the thespians reorganized in September was in need of a considerable amount of overhaul. Much equip- ment had to be purchased or con- structed from scratch. trnsts The Student Newspaper of Union College SCHENECTADY, N.Y., fRIDAY, DECEMBER 6, 1946 DA·RTMOUTH SECOND Pric:e lOc: Baske.tba/1' Seating There will be no reserved seats at the ho.me basltetb-ll games at the Ar.mory this sea.- son, but Stndents are lll'ged to si-t in the Student Stction on the east side of the Main Flo01r so as to unify their cheering efforts.

Under Buren Robbins' able guidance the neophytes were organized into a smooth working team that did a remarkable job in getting the show and the playhouse ready in so short a time.

The result has been two teams of almost equal ability, either one of which might have made court his- tory for the Garnet in other years. Practicing for Month Practice officially started a little over a month ago, with about 80 men reporting for the initial ses- sions. Boehm gave his charges · daily drills and gradually pared the squad down to about 20 in number. Last week, when the organization of a junior varsity took place, the number of men on the varsity was slashed to 12 and 11 men formed the nucleus of the J. V. quintet. The Garnet has already engaged in a number of practice games and Boehm feels that he has the team in the best possible shape for the lung stretch ahead of it. Early sea- son workouts were limited mainly to conditioning and basket shoot- ing. Plays and teamworl;: were then introduced and have been the basis of every drill during the past few weeks. Fine Quintet Developed Out of the tough pre-season prep- arations has come a quintet which is well versed in basketball and which also works together as a unit. The starting five will prob- ably pack more height than any Union team ever has. Four of the first stringers are 6' 1\ or better, with the fifth member hitting a mere ·5' 10\. This team will aver- age a little better than 6' 1\ when it is on the court. In addition to height, the squad has a great wealth of basketball knowledge and know how. Boasting of speed and height, the Dutchmen are experienced in the game. These three factors are essential to a winning team and will go far to- wards gaining Union the coveted victor's laurels, Trio of Veterans Three lettermen will team with a brace of freshmen to form the first five. Topping the list of the returning veterans is \Mule\ Haas, Cleaners and Dyers Balt·•s Shoe Inc.

He ente!'ed Union this year and his speed and calm- ness on the court may be decfding influences in the Dutchmen's favor. Jim Pemrick, the second fresh- man on the team, will statt at guard. Pemrick hung up a brilliant record at LaSalle Institute in Troy and should continue an outstanding court career at Union. An abundance of top-notch re- serve material is another factor giving added strength to the cage team.

Baritone, Ten or Soloists, Organ Music and Quartet Feature Holiday Musicale The annua.J Christmas music pro- gram wHl be held this 'Sunday, De- cember 22, in :.Vlemorial Chapel. The program for the entire day wiU be under the direction of Dr. Elmer A. :. 'Iidmarsh, Director of Music for the College. At the regular 11 o'clock morn- ing service there will be no sermon; lhP hour will be devoted entirely to L.hrtstmas carols and music. The choil' will present a varied program ot Christmas carols ranging trom ~ume vet·y old compositions down lo more recent ones. One of the oldest carols on the pl'Ogram is \Oh Conw, Oh Cume, Emmanuel,' which dates back to the 13th Century and \\'d.S originally used as a chant in the Catholic l-hurch. As a contrast m time, Katherine Davis' \Shep- herds Walw,\ composed in the 19th Centm·y, will also be presented. Soloists Featured Included in the program will be two baritone soloists, Harold C. Luvaas and William V. Johnson 'H; and t.wo tenor soloists, Win- thl·op Stone '50, and Richard Mayer '50. A quartette made up of Harold W. Grinell, David H. Robinson, Gilbert Corwin, and Richard B. Williams, all of the class of 1950, will round out the vocal offerings. Orga nmusic will, of course, sup- p!Pment the vocal numbers. Dr. Tidmarsh will play two groups of Christmas organ music, including \Noel Ecossais,\ an old Scotch ca1·ol; and \March of the Magi Kings,\ which is becoming a tradi- tional number at these services, having been included in the pro- gram for the last five years. In the afternoon, from 4:00 to ~:00 o'clock, the choir will offer a progran1 of its own. This wi'll hf' mainly a repetition of some of the selections on the morning program, but will also include several other compositions. Carol Sing in Evening On Sunday evening, from 7:30 to D:I)O o'clock, a public carol-sing will he held. Twenty-two Christmas carols are included on the program and the audience will join in the singing. Interspersed in the gen- eral singing will be several selec- tions by the choir. Guest organists will be Miss Helen Henshaw, or- ganist at the First Presbyterian Church in Albany, and at the Al- bany Academy; and Miss Hazel Roberts, who is assistant to Miss Henshaw at the First Presbyterian ChUl'Ch. These Chdstmas music programs are definitely established as a tradi- tion at Union, this being the twentieth year of presentation. Up until five or six years ago the serv\ ice was held on two or three con- srcutive Sundays in December. On at least one evening in the past the attendance was so great that Old Gym and Alumni Gym had to be opened to take up the overflow from the Chapel. Originated by Tidmarsh The holding of these annual services was originally instigated by Dr. Tidmarsh, and to him goes the credit for seeing that the pro- grams have been continued each yeal'. Another annual program started by him last year, and con- tinued this year, is the Monday :Musical Club Concert given by Dr. Tidmarsh and the Glee Club at the Fin:>t Presbyterian Church in Al- bany. Miss Henshaw assists at the organ at these concerts also. ----a---- MAKE-UP TESTS Registration for make-up tests to be given on Monday-Tuesday, Jan- uary 6 7 must be completed at the Office ' of the Dean before five o'clock Wednesday, December 1~.

Ryan The Union College Newman Club will hold its next regular rr.eeting m the Old Chapel on Tuesday eve- ning, December 17. The Reverend William M. Slavin will be the guest speaker. Father Slavin has been the college Chaplain at R.P.I. and moderator of its Newman Club since 1936 except for three years whic·h he spent in the Navy. He is also Diocesan Director of In- formation. In this office, he con- ducts a Sunday radio program on station WTRY entitled \News of the Week From a Catholic View- point\ which he started in 1940. He is the founder and still director of the Catholic Forum .of Troy. Dinner !or Executive Council Monday, December 9, the Execu- tive Council of the club were guests of Father F. X. Ryan, Union Cath- olic Ch;~plain, at Stella's Restaurant on Barrett Street. Joe Fuscigna, temporary president, presided. The Senior Officers, the finance commit- tee, the membership chairman, and some pre-war rr.embers were in attendance. Plans for next week's meeting were discussed and the calendar for the year wz.s prepared. Among the plans discussed was that of invita- tions from local girls' cclleges for joint social events. OommuniQn Bnal.:fast The next item on the calendar is a corporate Communion at St. John the Ev3ngelist Church followed by breakfart at Hale House on Janu- ary 12. Owen M. Begley, Assistant Attorney General and Union alumnus, has been asked to give the guest speech. Guest of Honor will be the Very Reverend John J. Finn, V.F., who has been instru- mental in refot·ming the org&niza- tion. Future plans call for discussion groups which are to be divided into three general topics. Father Ryan is to be aided by two Franciscan professors and the discussions, on s-ubject to be announced, should prove interesting, according to the group. Future speakers will include the Very Reverend Joseph A. McSorley, C.S.P., f!lmous Church historian, whose recent book was acclaimed as the outstanding history written in this generation. The Reverend Ignatius Cox, S.J., has also been contacted. Father Cox, a profess.or of Religion and Ethics at Ford·ham University, is known for his talks on malTiage and all it ilrplies. Figures from the last meeting showed a drop in attendance from the first meetings. It is expected that next Tuesday there will be a substantial increase.

Cam,pbeiL'40/ Discusses Servo Back From Grave In Daily Chapel Foresees Widespread Use Of Robot Mechanisms In Post-War American Life Choosing as his chapel topic \The Implicatiens and Philosophy of Thought in Servo Mechanisms,\ Mr. Donald P. Campbell '40, Tuesday's speaker, presented a variety of possibilities in the use of robot machines. The speaker stated that although the robots were originally devised to take up the slack in wartime manpower requi·rements, the ulti- mate results carry far greater im- plications. Acknowledging the fact that radat·, jet propulsion, and other marvels were accorded more spectacular, and speculative, pub- licity, Mr. Campbell still seemed positive that the philosophy devel- oped in the servo invention would hold more significance for the pub- lic's future existence. Essentially, he maintained that since the servos, in construction, had been made to approximate hnman performance, and since the complexity ef wires and gears could compensate for chance errors, the concepts upon which they are based can be applied to other fields. These would include the business world, where cylical depressions could be averted, and perhaps even the medical field in predicting blood pressure cycles. The basic funda- mentals for any analysis of this sort would be the laws of mathe- matics and .physics evolved in the servo research. • . • good things will never die The speaker concluded by empha- sizing the great future scope of servo use in producing a more evenly balanced life, by offering its services to Bology, Bioelectricity, and the Humanities. Mr. Campbell, after graduating from Union, obtained his M.S. in Electrical Engineering at the Mas- sachusetts Institute of Technology in 1943, and is now instructing there as Assistant Professor in the Electrical Engineering Department.

D. Killian Elected IFC Vice Presid~nt The office of Vice-president of the Interfraternity Council was filled this week by the election of David J. Killian, who will fill the vacancy created by the recent resignation of Henry W. Hochuli. Hochuli, vice-president since Sep- tember of this year, resigned so he could devote more tilr.e to academic pmsuite. Killian, a member of Beta Theta P1, is in the sophomore class. He was on the football team in 1942 and at present is a member of the Student Council. The question .of formal house parties Saturday night ef prom weekend in February was placed on the floor for discus-sion, but was tabled until more definite plans are released. This is expected follow- ing the .Student Council Meeting next Monday night. Had Enough? Geology Department Opens Uranium Mineral Exhibit A large collection of minerals<e•>-------------- from which the uranium used to make atomic bombs is extracted, has been on display in the Geology Showroom during the past week. The exhibit will be open to the public for an indefinite period. Minerals on display come from many widely dispersed sections, in- cluding Cornwall, England, Canada, North Carolina, Colorado, and Mad- agascar. Specimens from the Jacynov Mountain Range in Czech- oslovakia are also being exhibited. The pitchblende extracted from ma- terial in this section was used in the original Curie experiments. Important De-posits Represented from which uranium and plutor.- ium are extracted. Two of the lat- est books on the atom, \Atomic Energy for Military Purposes\ by Henry Smyth and \Uranium and Atomic Power\ by Jack DeMent make up another part of the dis- play, along with a photograph made by exposure of film to gamma rays. Dr. E. S. C. Smith, Chairman in the Field of Geology, in describing the size of the coilection, stated that at least 200 grams of uranium could be extracted from the min- erals on display. By way of com- parison, he stated that from 200 to Another of the specimens is from 1000 grams were used in making the Great Bear Lake Region of the atomic bomb. In other words, Canada, one of the most important according to Dr. Smith, there is sources of uranium-bearing min- enough uranium in the Geology erals in the world, and considered display \to blow .up the entire col- by some to be the greatest.

Phi lomatheans To Debate With RPI Plan Discussions, Future Meets With Other Colleges After their regular meeting last Monday night, Union College's Phi!omathean Society announced further plans for debating action this year. At present these plans are being developed beyond the formative stage and give promise of lively action in the near future. In a discussion aimed at deciding what topics will be offered to RPI when these two debating teams meet here at Union in February, the suggestion was made that two choices will be afforded, as follows: 1. What should be the new Con- gress' policy toward organized labor? 2. Should the United States work for a break in diplomatic t·elations with Franco Spain in the United Nations' Assembly? At Sage Too At this time, it was also an- nounced that the society also plans to meet with Russell Sage and vari- ous other neighboring colleges. During the coming yeai·, the Philomatheans are planning to in- vite various members of the Social Studies Division to the meetings to act as advisers or authorities on the topics under discussion. In this manner, it is hoped that the par- ticipants will be able to gain much from the topics presented. Nestle Hallahan Successor President Jack Hallahan an- nounced that his term of office would be terminated in January when he will graduate. It was decided that his successor will be the present Vice-President, Ralph Nestle. President Hallahan also stated, in regard to the oppor- tunities offered by the Society, that, \This is the opportunity for many men at Union College to spend many enjoyable evenings in fellow- ship, and at the same time, to ob- tain valuable information about the causes and effects of many of the present world problems and their possible solutions.'' The next meeting of the society will be held on January 6 at 7:30 in the English Reading Room in Bailey Hall. At this time the ques- tion for discussion will be Franco Spain from the Spanish Civil War to the present. We Told You So! Pric:e lOc: Cam.pus Magazine Publication Date Set December 19 First Issue of THE IDOL Since 1943; Again Out!et Of Undergraduate Authors It has often been o'aid that good things will never die. The truth of this may be seen in the revival of old songs, old plays, and old litera- ture. Many forms of the arts are suppressed at one time or another due to a change in the school of thought that nurtured them, or for lack of a receptive public at the time of their debut. When the latter is- the case, there is usually a deficiency in financial backing which inadvertently causes the fail- ure of the publication, musical score, drama, etc., which has the misfortune to run afoul of such a reaction. What Idol? On our Union carr.pus, we have an excellent example of just such a predicament. For those of the stu- dents who are new to this campus, the name \Idol\ means little or nothing. At best, the only meaning it might have is connected with that weird, tradition-bound statue reposing behind the Alumni Gym. However, for the edification of the new men, and as a reminder for the old men, there is another \IDOL\. Thirty-six years ago, a group of Union men compiled what w~;.s to be the first edition of a new type of student literature which they called THE IDOL. Unfortunately, there was insufficient financial backing for the journal and it soon became a non-entity. From that tin:e until eighteen years ago, there were many and varied publications, all more or less in the same vein, and all meeting with the same or similar fate of THE IDOL. Then, in 1928, a second IDOL was pub- lished. The duration of this pub- lication was slightly longer than the first and managed to survive until 1932, at which time it again failed, not to be revived again until the spring of 1936. Since then, with the exception of the war years when many of the college's extra- curricular activities were a bandon- ed, THE IDOL has been a success- ful publication meeting with much approval at each of its quarterly printings. All to New During its many frenzied years, attempts have been made to pattern THE IDOL after some well-known and well-liked na tiona! magazine, such as the New Yorker and others that are still popular today. This current edition, which will be re- Ie- sed on Dec en: ber 19, will be strictly a student magazine, insofar as that is possible. In it the reader will find fiction seasoned with some cultural articles, but these will be college efforts. THE IDOL is a student project and as such, is m~ de up of as many student con- tributions as is possible. The student board that now handles THE IDOL has as its of- ficers E. C. Stefic, Chairman; W. F. Broolts Jr., Managing Editor; Will- iam EiE\eman Business Manager; F. V. Bronner, Associate Editor; R. W. Fing3r, Advertising Manager. On the Editoi'ial Staff are: J. Enzer, H. A. Nelson, J. F. O'Neill, and C. H. Weissnet· Jr. The Business Staff has as its members W. B. Curtis-s. W. Gietz. D. H. Houghton, J. Morse, E. Nachison, D. B. Robert- son, A. G. Sullivan Jr., and A. Westerland. E. Richards does the photography, while J. W. Lemke is the student artist. Arthur G. Phil- lips is the faculty advisor. Since this will be the firet edition to come out in some time, there is no doubt a question as to how and where the student will be able to obtain his copy of THE IDOL. Men who live on campus will receive their issues by direct distribution, while those living off campus rray obtain their copies at the Student Activities Office. UCRS Meeting Wednesday There will be a geneml staff meeting of the Union College Radio Society next Wednesday eve- ning, December 18, at 7:15 P. M. in the studios in Washburn Hall.

In the Nott Hole he saw ice cream cones rise from five to seven cents; hot fudge sundaes went from 20 cents to 25; milk shakes from 15 to 20; and man,y other increases. In Hale House breakfasts became a Ia carte; lunches were served fo1· 55 instead of GO cents; and dinners became 75 cents instead of 70. All considered it was a good substantial boost. to integrate the dozen or more fed- eral agencies now adn.inistering the laws pertuming to veterans. In the college at ea it has been ruled that suosistence allowances received by veterans in training under the G.I. Bill of Rights are not subject to federal taxatton. All wages recetved from other sources, however, are subject to taxation. Where the wives are working, she may claim the husband as a de- We would lilte to protest this de- cision. If a man is bringing a girl here for a dance and a weekend, he must offer more soci I activity than the proposed dance would. This FaH, we had a football weekend which contributed t0 the entertain- ment. In February there will not even be a basketball game to watch. Thus, the dance is the main and nrob~bly the only social function of the weekend. If it is to be such, a band with some prestige should be obtained and the dance a formal one·. There are a number of good and well-known bands that ought to be obtainable that weekend and we feel that the Council should make an effort to sign them. There we1·e, however, reasons. President Carter David- son announced in an open letter to the Student Body on November 22 that Hale House was losing approximately $100 a day. Everyone was aware of the fact that food prices were skyrocketing throughout the country. Naturally the price raises were fair. But were they'? Certain other factors were being overlooked. According to rather strong evidence the Nott Hole was, previous to the price raise, if not a profit making organiza- tion, at least breaking even. Its cash register is punched from 700 to 800 times a day. Its coffee sales alone reaps a good profit. Its servings have never been more than average, A great deal of its supplies come directly from Hale House. Yet it has been found expedient to increase its prices and fire two of the five women employed there. Was this necessary because of the increased costs? Is the Nott Hole now, under the present circumstances, just barely breaking even; or is there a sizeable net profit being brought in with the price boosts and new economy cuts'! An excellent example is the case of the hot fudge sundae: a dish of ice cream costs the customer 12 cents. A hot fudge sundae consisting of the addition of a lade! of hot fudge sauce costs 25 cents. In other words the customer pays 12 cents for a dish of ice cream and 13 cents more for the addition of a few spoonfuls of fudge sauce. Is the Nott Hole making a profit'! Then there is Hale House. According to Dr. Davidson, Hale House was losing $100 a day. In order to alleviate this condition prices were boosted so that the average student paid from 10 to 15 cents more a day for food. Such a move could not possibly remove the daily deficit. If all those who eat in Hale House were to be averaged together an extremely pessimistic conclusion would be that an approximate 500 breakfasts, lunches, and dinners are served a day. This being the situation Hale House is now increasing the daily cash receipts by from 50 to 75 dollars, yet they were losing 100. The question arises: what is taking care of the deficit? pendent The la1ge number of babies being born to couples where one or both of the parents are attending college is beginning to present a consider- able problem. In the first place the couple generally has great dif- ficulty in balancing their budget and the new born babies are ag- gravating the housing problem. There definitely will be an appeal to Congress to make some financial concessions to married veterans in school under the G.I. Bill, possibly similar to those now in effe<!t under Public Law No. 16. Former officets .of the Army of the United States, as distinguished from the regular Army, are eligible to apply for a commission in the A.G.F. not later than Decerr.ber 21st. There has been cons·iderable dis- cussion as to whether or not a veter·an can claim the period of If a rr:an is bringing a girl here for an event, the ·Council should see that it is an event, and not just another weekend. There are ~ number of others that share our feelings and we urge the SC to consider them before proceeding on their proposed plan. Sincerely yours, H. K. S. and others H. K. S. has an argument there. It probably won't be much Qf an affair if there is no other event and not even a I rge (in reputation) band. But, we sugges.t that H. K. S. withhold his protests until plans~ at least tentative plans-are an- nounced. It isn't very good form to protest rumors. - ED. tirr,e spent in A.S.T.P. and N.C.T.P.

South stated that this would not be necessary. What then was his solution? Is it far from conceivable that he proposed that by price boosts and cost cuts in the Nott Hole he would subsidize Hale House with the profits to be realized? If this is true it means that the hundreds of men who eat in the Nott Hole everyday, but do not eat in Hale House, are helping to support the latter. A rather shady al'l'ano·ement to say the least. Where the question of \a con- tinuation of his civilian course\ is There is more, however, to the Hale House situation. Today Mr. South puts before the customer three meals a day at a cost of $1.60 while fraternity houses on campus are able to put before their members meals which are certainly more satisfactory at $1.50.

The Nott Hole, which from all apparent sources was at least breaking even, also increased its prices and dropped two ft·om its staff of five.

No (!efinit!? word as to what band· would be hired .for February 21 was to be had. The two March dances will be held on- the first a;nd fifteenth of the month with the first under the chairmanship of B. Phillips Barnet, and the second dance being spon' sored by the Freshman Class. Both affairs will come after home basket- ball games in the Schenectady Armory. Buses will be hired to· transport students and dates from the games to the Gymnasium. Walter J. Wiggins, chairman of the prom to be held next February 21, 194 7, stated that no definite word could be released as yet re- garding what band would play at th-e coming winter prom. The Council was assured, however, that contracts should be signed without fail by the close of the Christmas recess. Other members of the Council prom committee are: Robert Breil- ing, Paul Fitting, Charles Weisner, Edward Williamson, Eugene Sulli- van, and· Hubert Titus. Representative Harry :i?. Hawkes raised the question as to the date set for the Prom calling it \un- fairly cheating\ the basketball squad out of an opportunity to at- tend because of away games that weekend. Wiggins informed the Council that change of date, how- e¥er inconvenient the present one was, was impossible. The Admini- stration had approved the present date, he explained, only because of . the Saturday holiday.

Catholic Releases Group Plans The Union College Newman Club held its regula!' genet a! m£eting !act Tuesday, Decen.ber 17. The .Reverend William Slavin, Chaplain of RPI, delivered an inspiling talk on the necessity of the Catholic college student to be v.ell educ,ted in his religion. This education is the chief purpose of the Newman . Clubs. Father added that there was no reason fm· a college student to ~hy away from inquiries about his religious beliefs. There are many who have very e1 ron eo us opinions ~bout Catholicism and who are very anxious to find out what is truly believed and practiced by Catholics. In Gramrr,ar and High .School. the average student is not mentally qualified to fully under- stand the te chings of the Church. But college students. especiaiiJ' vet- erans, have an obligation to find out more about their teligion. Chi Psi: ne,;ly initiated-G<eorge Wheeler and Ed Kirches.

SEASON'S GREETINGS Lionel The time has come for all of us to wish each other the traditional season's greetings. It may not seem much like Christmas outside with the scarcity of snow (although there certainly hasn't been any shortage of snow on the inside.) But, in five more days we will celebrate the nineteen hundred and forty-fifth anniversary of the birth of Christ. Let's make this last five days the forerunner of many more days in the future-expressions of our good will for and to our fellow men. tral or fraternity member·s. Our ef- forts have been beneficial to neu- tral as well as fraternity men. The free dance which the Council spon- sored the Saturday night of Grid- iron Ball weclt end and the open house parties were measures which we promoted for the benefit of all, but Bupported solely by our own tunds. In addition to the above, the Council also r·ecently voted $300. of its own muney to buy a band stand and other neces:;ities for dances in the gymnasium, a measure which will benelit ALL students on the campus. We might enumerate fur- ther but this should. suftice to show that our elforts have not been .di- rected only in the iield of further- ing our own interests.

This is Admonition brings fruition; Apprehension leads to tl'nsion; the last issue of the ·CONCORDIENSIS before Christmas. Condesct>nsion brings dissPntion; Now is the time for us to plan for the future-ours and These are things we didn't mention. the college's. In the future, we sincerely hope that we, the college, the students, the faculty may join hands in making Union the place we all want it to be. We hope that there will no more occasion for us to rant and rave-as our advisor says, to become frenetic-over the misdeeds or misconceptions of deeds which don't lead to harmony on campus. We are little different from the outside world. There is no Utopia to which we may retire-excluding mundane affairs. All of us have our faults and the problem is to recognize our own as well as those of our fellows. Our only advantage over the baser animals is the ability to reason. With that faculty, let us strive for a closer union at Union. Let us cooperate with one another. Let us face our problems as a solid, united body and not, as has been the case in the past, as individuals. It takes but a glance at the daily newspapers for any of us to realize that our attempts at unity can do little to aid the chaos in which we find the world. But, unity on a small scale is a step towards unity on a large scale. Therefore, let's turn to the next guy and offer our help instead of a snarl and the comment that \You've messed up the deal/' Let's pick up and hold the Christmas spirit of benevolence to everyone. In that light, we c11n find, far more easily, the common 'measure of endeavor. So, a very Merry Christmas to each and every one and a wish for a more harmonious, profitable New Year.

The citation for the ind·ividual having done the most for 1acr·osse in 1946 was awarded to Victot· Star- zenski, who coached at Union from 1922-1928 and was responsible for starting the game on the Union campus. He is credited with having brought the game back to the Indians. He inaugurated the sport at the University of New Mexico and started several Indian Reservation Schools in that area playing the game. players, two each from Princeton Army and Hopkins, and one from Maryland. Union will have an op- pot·tunity to match wits with the majority of these men during their spring recess.

Changed Line-up Due Markes, Roberts, O'Neil Likely Starters In Tilt The Union five meets the St. Lawrence basketball team on its home court in the state armory to- night. The Larries have a str.ong team and may upset the Union team which is favored after its last two victories. The Garnet hoopsters will be out for their third victory of the season to put them back on an even !tee! in games won and lost. Coach Boehm will probably start the five men who were most ef- fective in the Hamilton game Wednesday night. They are O'Neil, Pemrick, Schultz, Markes, and Roberts. It was this quintet that did most of the scoring and held Hamilton when it threatened near the end of the game. This combination is by far the best Boehm can put on the court. With some practise working to- gether they have the makings of a very bard to beat team. Schultz is high scorer for Union so far this s·eason. He also bas been high scorer in all but one of the games. Having previous experience with a General Electric team, Schultz has the knowledge to be the backbone and strong man of the team. His keen eye makes him a constant danger on both set and lay-up shots.

C. at Man- hasset and April 5-Montclair A. C. at Montclair.

C. at Schenectady May 21-Sampson at Schenectady; and May 24-Stevens at Hoboken. In January individual instruct-ion will be started in the gymnasium for squad segments; goalies; inside defense men; midfielders; and at- tack men. Cage scrimmages have been suggested vs. Yale at New Haven and Army at West Point prior to the spring trip. This is the most active program ever scheduled for this major sport on the campus and the spring should see the local INDIANS in fine form. ----o---- Following a football game at the University of Rochester in the early 1890's when spectator's took a personal interest in each point scored, Union College's football manager bad to draw a g:un to get his team safely off the field after a 96-0 victory. * Union College has won 60 per cent of the hundred of games play- ed by Garnet teams in 48 years of basketball. ~ ~ Ul ~ \' ~ 0 I t;; ~ \\ I 0 0 ; ., \!) . z .: :I: ... \' ... ·= O'Neil playing center has both the height and skill necessary for a good pivot man. He is under the basket on all plays and seldom 'lets an opponent get a ball off the back- boards. His skill at making lay-up shots from the pivot position also makes him one of the high scorers for the Garnet hoopsters. Pemrick, who plays forward with Schultz, is second high on the Union squad. The combination of these two men under the basket form a scoring threat whenever they have the ball. Being tall and fast Pemrick is very good at work- ing 'the ball into scoring position. He also rates with Schultz in set and lay-up shots. Coach Boehm, in changing his opening lineup, seems to have hit on a better combination than he opened the season with. Schwartz, Schultz, Pemerick, Markes, and Haas opened against Hobart; but O'Neil replaced Haas in opening against Hamilton. The quintet that seems to have the most control over the ball, however, consists of· Schultz, Pemerick, O'Neil, Mar]{eS, and Roberts. Although the Garnet men tend to be slow on the offense and do not seem to be working enough plays, they are picldng up momentum. With good handling they can chalk up a good season's record.
