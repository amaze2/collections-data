I '. ·THE CONCORDIENSis· VOL. XXX. UNION C'OL.LEGE, MAR. 2, 1907 No. 17 THE .ALLISON-FOOTE DEBATE. Adelphics Once ~[QI·e Vieuoeious Fully vindicating the position . n~at Union's o:Id literary spirit was dying out, the recent Allison-Foote debate between the ::Philomathean and Adelp'hic Societies was one of the best held in recent years. Enth usi.asm was the marked feature of the.. evening-enthusiasm not only of speakers, but of spectators, and such enthusiasm as has been rather rare before at events of sueh a nature. Every one entered with zeal in the singing of college songs before the debate began, and \=ornetbi ng very like a revival of co'lh·:g.~ spirit was evident. President Raymond opened the ex€rcises, first stating the terms of the debate and the r.easons fnr its being held. T'he question, he said, was, \Resolved That the United States government should lilnit the acquisition of large individual fortunes by means of a graduated inheritance tax.\ Hill. '07, introduced by Raymond, '08, the presiding officer of the Adelphics, then opened the debate for the affirmative. He first of all clearly defined the question and stated the grounds on which the affirma.rtive would base their side of the debate. He then showed how the acquisition of large fortl:l nes should be limited because of the benefits it would bring to politics; now it would alleviate the im- pending class struggle and ·how such a course,. by the adoption of an inheritance tax would bring more 1noney into the government coffers, from there to be more ably circulated than from the hands of individual phila.n thropists. Tiffany, '08, was the first speal\er fo-r the negative, and was introduced by the Philoma- thean's presiding officer, Hanigan, '08. Tif- fany's argument was one that consisted mainly of the r€buttal of his opponent's points, and he endeavored to establish the fact that the limiting of fortunes wouid take away the in- herent right of inheritance; that it would be a blow at our democracy by aiming legislation at a certain class., a'nd that, on the whole, the step was :entirely too radical. · Weyrauch, '08, then spoke for the affirma- tive. He showed how the limitation· of fortunes was not a radical step, but was necessary for the preservation of America's dem·ocratic ideas· and ideals. Quoting from well-known authori- ties, he established the fact that inheritance was not an inborn right, but a \creature of the hunTan law,\ according to the United States Supreme Court. He also laid ground for the position that the inheritance tax ·was the one way to limit fortunes, by showing that it was advisable. The next speaker for the negative was H. W. Bell, '08, who took exception to all of the pre- ceding arguments; said that the taking away of the right to bequeath property was radical; and, in any event, he 'held that there were many other ways of restricting fortunes that would be much more successful, bringing forth as a case in point the income tax, as used in many European states. King, '08, the third speaker for the affinna- tive, then took up the final arguments for his side in an €arnest and extremely clear address. He showed firs.t that the income tax was no just substitute for the inheritance tax, and brought forth arguments to show why the in- heritance tax should be adopted because, he said, it would be just and feasible. It would limit, he pointed out, by the mere wording of the question. Any tax, he held, would serve to cut off .some of this enormous fortune, and, no 1natter how small, would, in consequence, limit· the acquisition ther.e by.

THE CONCORDIENSIS Waldron, ~os, closed t 1 be debate for the hega- New York City. President R~ymond will pre- tivef endeavoring to ref,ll.te his o.pponent's posi- tion that the tax wouLd be just, saying that class l~egislation is neve:r just, and the affirma- tive, in proposing an inheritance tax, was hoping to aim at a ce:etain cla,ss. lile then carefully summarized all the arguments for the negative, ar1d showed the salient points on which they based their debate. The rebuttal that foUowed was marked by particular zeal and ,eJoc;taence. Every speaker seemed to catch the infection of :enthusiasm, and the fire of repartee was remarkable. All the points were brought out and thoroughly dis- cussed before the last S]l()aker had finished, and then the judges retired. \.r'he decision.. they ren- dered was considered just by all. The Adelphics were awarded the debate and King the indi- vidua.l P'rize. ---- UNIVERSITY DAY Afte•·noon a.nd Evenblg of Ma~ch 7. As yet, arrangements nave not been entirely eomple,ted for the exercises of University Day, which comes on March 7th. Invita.tions have been issued to the Govern- ors, of:ticers and alumni of the University living in this vicinity, to Justices of the Court of Appeals, and Members of the State Legislature, as well .as to representative citizens.

Tickets for the dinner may be obtai,hed fro·m the class officers and .a special price of two dollars a plate has been made fot all students who attend. Thjs occasion is one that demands the loyal support of every man. in College, and it is espeeially desirable that there be a large rep- resentation from Schenectady. It is highly prob- able that at least a hundred men will go over from here. The singing and cheering will be a distinctive feature of the dinner. Mr. Dickinson Resigns 1\!fr. Asa. Don Di·ckinson, who has h::en in charge of the IAbrary since the beginning of the College year, has resigned his position and will assum.e the duties o·f Librarian of the Public Library of Lea.venw:orth, Kansas. During his short stay Mr. Dickinson has WlOn. m.any friends, who are sorry to see him leave. His work in the Library has heen m1ost satisfactory. It was almost entirely due to his efforts that the deci- n1al system was ina Ygurated. Mr. Dickinson is succeeded by Mr. D1eWitt C'linton, fonnerly of the Troy Public Libra,ry. It is expected tha.t u.n assistant will be a.ppointed a bOl1t the middle o,f March, since, the work re- quires the attention of more than one man. H, B. Silliman Scho.Jarships Dr. HoracE\ B. Silliman of the Class of 1846 has given the CollCBge the sum of $6,000; the interest of which iS' to be devoted to the main ... tenance of three new scholarships, which are to be known as the \H. B.

The scholarships are to be awarded each June to a member of the Junior Class, a member of the Sophomore Class and a member of the Fr-eshman C~as.s. This year, however,. a different plan was devised: in order that tfu.e .scholarships might go into im- mediate effeet. 'The committee of a.ward is to be composed of the President of the College, the Dean. and the President of the College Y. M. C. A. The scholarship~ :are to be a.wa..rded to a.ctive mem- bers of the Christian Associati.on, preference being shown to students of the classieal course ..

The gam,e was hotly contested from start to finish, and the result was in doubt up to the very last moment. In the first half neither team played a strong nffensiVE! garr1e. Union had somewhat the better of it, the half ending with the score 10-8 in our favor. In the second half Ham.nton began to play a strongly of'f ensive gan1e, and toward the end the tomE' t·~am weakened, thus allowing the visitors io make several much-needed baskets and thus to win the- game. Although all of the Union team played well, the tearn w·o1·k was weal{. Han1ilt.on, however, excelled in strength, as she ::l'lso did in skillful passing. During the game the students, directed by Cheer- Leader Richardson, gave t~e best exhibi- ti:on of coHege spirit shown he·re in some tirn.·e. ·0f the game. 'l,he star game f0:r the visito~s was utH'ioubt- edly p[ayed by Kuomt. He made :t:our baskets, and one point on a foul.

We have already spoken of this occa- sion in a previous issue, but we do not hesitate again to n1ention it, for it seen1s to us to offer an exceptionally rare oppor- tunity for con1ing into personal contact with all the representative n1en of the University-. -for, unless we greatly err,. all the representative n1en will be there. J3 u t not only will every n1an of spirit in the University be present, but n1·en of pron1 inence in the outside world will have son1ething to say that will well be worth the hearing. Evidences of sharp con1petition in sing- ing and cheering between the Albany and Schenectady departn1ents are already very ntunerous. The chance is open to every n1an in College for gaining a new view- point and a new in1petus that will carry us over into a baseball season that is bound to be successful.

UNION COLLEGE, MAR. , 1907 9 No. 18 UNIVERSITY DAY .:\ Heiuarl{abl€ Garlhe1·ing of the Deparbn:ents- N otable Address by Dr. Draper- Highly Successful Dinn(-'I' University Day was celebrated in Albany on the afternoon ai'ld evening of Thursday, March 7. About 4·50 students representing Union Col- lege, Albany Law School, Albany Medical Col- lege and the AJbany College of Pharmacy, were in attendance for the aftern.oon exercises, which began in 0(1d Fellows' Hall at 3 P. M. Chan- cellor Andrew V. V. Raymond, '7 5, presided over the meeting. Upon the platform were seated the speakers and a large representation of the several Faculties. The exercises were opened \vith a brief address by President Raymond. Prayer was offered by the Rev. Dr. Battershall, rector of St. Peter's Episcopal Church. Owing to the enforced absence of Vice-·Chancellor St. Clair McElway of the State Board of Regents. acting Vice-Chancellor Beach delivered the ad- dress of welcome. Dr. Lewis Boss of the Dud- ley Observatory followed with a noteworthy address upon the work and aim of the Observa- tory. The notable address of the afternoon was given by Dr. Andrew S. Draper, State Com- missioner of Education. Dr. Draper's remarks were largely historical, with special reference to the founding and development of Union College. Dr. Draper spoke with great forcefu1- ness and treated the difficult portions of his subject with singular tact. The address was received with great enthusiasm by all who were fo~·tunate enough to hear it. The dinner was held at eight o'clock in the evening at the Ten Eyck. There were 24:1 covers laid. Governor Charles E. Hughes was the guest of honor and was introduced before attend to official business that could not be deferred. His remarks w,e:re brief and to the point. He spoke in .a pa~rticularly happy vein. At the close of the dinner President Raymond, acting as toastmaster, read letters from the Hon. Frederick W. Seward, '49, and Vice-Chan- cellor St. Clair McKelway. Toasts were re- sponded to by Dean Newton W. Fiero of the Law School; Dr. Samuel B. Ward of the Medi- cal College; the Rev. Dr. Jones of the Madison. A venue Reformed Church, Albany; and the Hon. William H. M:cElroy, '60, o:ff New York City. The evening closed with the singing of the \Song of Old Union.\ There was the greatest enthusiasm manifested throughout the entire day. The speeches were delivered with rare ability and many of them. abounded in pleasing humor. The singing and cheering were rendered with a spirit that was most admirable. We regret exceedingly that lack of time alone compels this short account of such a memorable occasion. We feel confident that the press and our contemporaneous college publication will do full justice and honor to this remarkable event, which signalizes a new era in the growth of the University. TRUSTEES' MEETING Grounds to Be Beautified - Appropriation for Museum The meeting of the :J3oard of Trustees which was adjourned on January 22 in Albany was continued on Tuesday evening, March 5, at the Hebrew Technical Institute, New York City. Two resolutions were adopted w'hich signify in a 1naterial way the new prosperity of the Col- lege. Both measures indicate progress in a the close of the dinner in order that he might long-desired direction, . I

6 THE C~ONCORDTENSIS The Board appointed: a coDmittee to· super- vise the improvernent of the College grounds. The committee ha~ at its disposal a special ap- propriation for this purpose, and work upon the campus will b·€g,in as early in the sp-ring as is possible. n is highly probable that a large part if not all o'f the improvements will be effected before eo·rnm.encement in June. The second im]l.Qrtant maUeF brought up for tbe Board's co-nsideration was tll,e question of the n1useum. A suitable appropriation was made to put the various coUections in good repair.. Ali the :specimens now in the RouRd Building will be restored and classified. The Lecture by Pro-f. Bracq Prof. Jean C. Bracq, head of the Romance language department a;t Vassar College, gave a most instructive address on '''The Present Rela- tion of Chur-ch and Sta.te in France'' in the Chapel ·on TuesCLay evening. The lecture was given under the auspices of the Fortnightly Club, and was weN attended by the members and students. \ T'he speaker dealt with the question from the French point of view, and was well qualified to discuss the subj:ect, since he was born in France, and lived ther€ for many years. He began by showing how the French are divided into two necessary pedesta~s. cases, etc., will be supplied great parties, the clericals .and the anti-clericals. so that visitors ma..y have the privilege of view- ing one part of our valuable possessions that has hitherto been reposing in obscur-ity. The Wheatley and Delavan collections of minerals will also be moved from the gallery of the chapel to the top floor of the library. The Board also took action with regard to tbe land on which the houses of professors and fraternities may be: built. For this purpose was set apart all that 1!> ortion of the campus bounded by Union Avenue, South College Lane and Library Lane, as the lane leading up to the library from Uniolil StTeet has been called. Al- though several fraternities have applied for sites on which to erect houses, no applicaUons were granted at tlUs meeting. It is understood that land will be leased to fraternities not in order of establishrn,ent, but in an order to be determined by their readiness to build. The lots will average 150 x 100 feet and there is room for some ten houses. 1\!.r. Pond has al- ready erected a 'house within this district. lY.[r. Edouard Lang was chosen to act as an instructor in the Uepartment of Modern Lan- guages. Mr. Lang is a native German and was graduated from the University of Zurich. He has also taken a course in theology in this country. Mr. Lang is at present te,aching in the T'roy Academy and will not assume his new duties until next a-utumn. The former, r,epresenting the extreme Roman Catholic views, are not noted for their love -of liberty. The latter compri·se men of all creeds, including many of the best Catholics of France. According to :Prof. Bracq, the greatest desire of the French is for religio-us liberty, and, after that, political liberty. He declared that, when the Catholic party has been in control, they have .given as Jittle liberty as possible, while the Republicans have given much when they were in power. For years, or until some time after the es- tablishment of the third republic the speaker said the prelates of the church controlled all political appointments, and this caused much discord. Among other oppressions, non-Catholic soldiers had to attend mass, the teachers Inis- represented history, Catholic teachers were not required to have diplomas, while other teachers were, and free thinkers cou.ld not open schools. The speaker then asserted that under the new conditions the church is 11ot oppressed; that money taken from the abolished orders is either returned to those who gave it, given to Catho..- lics who need assistance or to old members of the orders-in short, that the government does not get one franc, so its act cannot be called confiscation. When the se:paration law was being :framed, the Catholic committee which had it in charge 1 l ! ./ . .l 1 I ! ' \ ' S't a.J aJ n: lc 81 b; tr G tl a T 1: h: tl fc u. fc is gj SJ d: li.l t~ vl a ir d

When the na.tion was .app·ealed to, an overwhe~l:r.ning ma- j-ority vote·d in !favor of it. In closing, Pr.o:f. Bracq co·mpared conditions und-er the Concor'<l:at and un.d·er the present ar- rangement. He ·showed. that both church and State have gaine.d, the one being made a }.;)urely spititua'l, the other a. pur,ely temporal organiza- tio,n, and neither one controlled .or tnfluenced by the other.

8 1'HE CiQNCORDIENSIS Another Way to Mark T\ll.ere are many ways of determining how /'48. Alumni Notes .Judge Charles C. Nott has recently pre- much a student knows about his subject. Ther·e sented to our library the original manuscript are also many ways of determining what his mark shal:l be, Rumor has it that some of the methods employed by the Powers that Be are rather unique. For example, we have heard of a professor who marked his men according to the silk hat system. That is, he carefully set down against each man's name whatever grade appeared on a slip of paper drawn from his \topper.\ This system ·works very well when the knowledge of the subject is at a minimum. Justke to the class forbade the insertion of slips bearing the }.etters ''N. S.\ .or \F.\ :of an address delivered: by Abraham Lincoln at the Cooper Union, New York, during the Civil War. I '66.

Pater, ·being one of a committee to pass upon exam- ination essays, professed when it came to the giving of an account to be wholly unable to say anything at all, shaking his head wearily at reiterated questions, and asseverating, 'No, noth- ing struck me; nothing struck me at all; all the essays were very much alike.' Finally, his colleagues suggested that if they read aloud the names of the men who had submitted the essays he might be able to give some opinion. He submitted, fina.lly, brightening visibly at the name 'Sanctuary,' and saying with soft glee: 'Ah, yes, I remember. Give him first. I liked his name so much.' The tales of his special tolerance toward the pranks of undergraduates, too, are delightful. Being consulted upon meas- ·pres to be taken against students who per- sisted in bonfires in the squad, he objected that, on the other hand, 'they do light up the tower of St. Mlary's beautifully.' \ ment and found that the boHer house was on fire. The flue, which was supposed to be fire- proof, being lined with asbestos, had become overheated and set fire to the surrounding wood- work. The blaze was extinguished after doing about $100 damage. Again, at four o'clock Wednesday morning, the firemen invaded the campus. The blaze had been started from some of the refuse of the former fire. This time all that was needed was a bucket of water. Neither fire stopped the working of the boilers, so that the sections and fraternity houses did not suffer a loss in temperature. Safe A Missouri graduate in law, says a politician of that State, wrote to a prominent lawyer in Arkansas to inquire what chance there was in that section for such a one as he described himself to be. He said: \I am a Republican in politics, and an honest young lawyer.\ The reply that came seemed encouraging in its interest: \If you are a Republican the game laws here will protect you, and if you are an honest lawyer, you will have no compe- tition. \-Harper's Weekly.

THE B!J.1-0ADEI~ SPIRIT For the first tin1e in years there has be.en developed in this university a feeling of n1ntnal regard between the severa;l de~art~ 111ents. It is not for us to attetnpt to trace the cleveloptnent of this spirit-we content \ourselves with the fact of its welcon1e Jn·es- ence. Now that there is a bond of genui11:e good fellowship we should guard and pro- tect it with all care and tact. A single personal differenc·e between pron1inen t rnen of the different departments 1nay [ead to a breach that even the strongest S[)iri~t cannot tnencl. VVe would take this occa- sion to speak to the n1anagers and leaders of our various organizations in favor of concentrating the greatest attention upon whatever relations now exist between the departtnents. tfh e spirit of courtesy and the willingness to sacrifice a sn1all personal pleasure will do tnore to help this growing spirit wax strong and close-binding th.an anything else we know of. A trip to Al- bany now and then 111ay not be convenient! hut the effect will be well worth w:b.ile. It is within our powers to grant favors that will be received with greatest gratitude.

THE CO'NCO:RD!ENSIS iii a nratter over which we have no jurisdic- tion:. It rests i:n the hands of a few. A SIGN OF THE FUTURE By its action last Tu<tsday evening, the Boa:rd of Trustees gave a sign to the friends of the coHege that cannot be mis- taken in signi:fi:can-ce. The willingness of the Board to devot'e n1oney to purposes outside the pale of bare necessity is indica- tive of two in1portant considerations. The past, with its bttrdens of debt and lack of prosperity, has been torced out of our im- n1ediate notice:; the future, with its horn of plenty,. is britght before us. We have ahvays believed in the future of this insti- tut~on as firn1ly as we have revered the tnernories of the past. We have often looked fo=r so1ne token or outward n1anifes- tation of t'hat future, and at last we have found it exhibited in the n1a11ner desired. We are beginning to be able to do some- thin-g for ourselves. But in the doing it is gratifying to note that the itnprovetnents wiU be along the lines laid down son1e years ago. The spirit of the past will not be violated, we hope, in a single particular. \V e believe th.at no improvement will ap- peal tnore to our older graduates than the proposed repairs to the 'terrace. We un- derstand that other work of a similar na- ture is being contemplated. \Ve congratu- late t'he Bbarcl upon its action and feel confident that the work of beautifying th·ese historic old grounds will be carried on with un·erring taste and sound judg- tnent. Memory Somebody of a psychological turn .of mind once asked Lord Rosebery, \What is memory?\ \Memory Ros.ebery replied, promptly but somewhat pensively-\memory is the feeling that steals over as when we listen to our friends' original stori·es.''-Youth's CompaniDn.

It is a commodity which you very frequently borrow from your friends. Some- Limes you loan a to the F'aculty and sometimes the Faculty returns it to you with greatly in- creased value. Very verdant freshmen often use it as an outward token of their arrival at man's estate. Seniors and other wise men find it as restful as the \sleep that knits up the ravell'd sleave of care.\ The word in question will appear in next week's issue. A Wing· Shot 'l'he,re had been many speak,ers, the hour waxed late, people were tired, and the diners were one by one qu.ieUy pushing back their chai-r.s and leaving the hall, when Mr. Elder was called upon to respond to a toast. He arose, and looking around the lar.ge hall, remarked that the present circumstances re- minded him of a story told of a Methodist· min- ister. The reverend gentleman was offic:;iating in a strange parish, and when he rose to de- liver his sermon the congregation began stealing ' out one by one. Stopping in his delivery of his . text, he remarked quietly: \Well I have all my life been a traveling clergyman, but never before ha\\>'e I preac·hed to a traveling congregation.\ Mr. Elder.'s palpable \hit\ brought down the house, and the migration ceased until the close of his brilliant remarks.-'Boston Herald.

I4 'ri'!E C.ONCORDlENSIS Intevcollegiate Civic League Yale, Princeton, Harvard, the University of Pennsylvania:, Columbia, Williams, Dartmouth, a:nd a number of other Amherst, coUeges, have formed their respective civic or good government clubs into a League under the name given above. The co-operation of Union has been asked by :the secretary ,tn a letter in part as follows: \The League consists of non-partisan clubs formed for the purpose of helping their mem- bers to acquire information about public affairs. The clubs are purely student organizations and commonly caB themselves Civic, or Good Gov- ernment clubs. They hold periodic meetings, are frequently addressed by men from outside the college, and in many cases carry on o:dginal \vork in trying to ascertain the facts about some question of public importance, usually a local question.\ Next Saturda.y evening is not an ideal time for discussing the formation of such a Civic c1 ub here; bu. t it so happens that Mr. Charles M'. Jesup of New York, member of the Ad- visory Comm,i ttee of the League, is to pass through Schenectady on that day, on his return. frorn a trip to Chicago University, M'ichigan and Cornell.

The admis- sion ·Of Union into the Association was taken up and is now being seri•ously considered by Dr. Stroud and SUllivan,. appointed as a committee to look into the matter.\ The last sentence seems to imply that Union has made formal application for admission to the Association. The reporter was evidently misinformed, for as yet the student body has made no such application. However, we under- stand that a letter asking for information has been sent. * * * T'he proposed organization meeting of the Civic Club has been postponed for about three weeks because of the inability of Mr. Jesup to be here on the date originally selected. * * * Regular college exercises will be resumed on Wednesday, April 3d. * * * Winter term examinations will be concluded on Wednesday, March 27th. * * * In the book of Genesis it is said of Ishmael, \'he shall be as a wild ass among men.\ The Dean says this makes him think of the fellows who peek in at the Chapel door to see if the monitors are present, before they come in. * * * B.

Next fall he will enter the University of Pennsylvania. * * * The old blue gate, which has for so many years withstood the ravages of time, has been replaced by a new solid oak structure of the same pattern.

The Musical Clubs After a winter season of partial inactivity the Glee and Instrumental Clubs have taken on a new lease of life and the prospects for a fine spring season are excellent. The petition of the clubs to take a three days' trip during April was favorably consid- ered by the faculty, and a committee composed of Dr. Ellery, Prof. McKean and lY.Lr. Ferguson was appointed to consult with Manager Par- sons as to the standing of the Association. A director has been engaged, and already the Clubs are showing marked improvem·ent in their work. It was hoped that a joint concert could be held with Hamilton in Schenectady on March 30, but the fact that an Easter vacation had been gran ted rendered this impossible. Mianager Parsons has been busy arranging dates for the f0rthcoming trip and while defi- nite dates have not been set, it is more than likely that the tour will embrace Oneonta, Una- dilla, Sidney and Binghamton. It is an acknowledged fact that a good Musi- ,cal Association does wonders ior a college in the line of advertising, and Union ought not to be behind the other colleges (i)f her class. Leader Kline is doing fine w·ork. with the Glee Club, and they n0W have several selections ready for p,reseiD.tation. There are several good voices on the Club, and with proper training there are many more which will make good. '\i'he MandoUn Club is working well, and Leader Vandegrift has full attendance at every rehearsal. lt is imperative 1that every man be in his place on time at every rehearsal from now on until the trip. ~teps have been taken to have the Clubs put under the direct supervision of the Faculty, and it is expected that the Glee Club tax will be collected through the college office hereafter. 'lhe new committee has offered very good ad- vice as to :rehearsals, training, etc. The management is very .fortunate in secur- ing the services of Mr. Mau.sert t0 direct the Glee Clubs, and it is thought that his services will not be needed for more than three weeks to bring the Club into proper shape. Prompt- ness at rehearsals is essential. With the cordial sup.port of the student body Union will turn out as good an Association as time and care can~ and the rest of the year will see a change in Musical affairs at Union College. / ~3.

I. team were completely surprised when it was defeated by the \Varsity\ Satur- day night in the Gym. in the fourth game of the series. The game was hotly contested throughout, the first and last few moments of play being especially fast. At the beginning the play was very rough, a large number of fouls being called on both sides soon after the game began. R. P. I. took the lead at the start and held it for some time, the local players being unable to keep the ball a way from the home basket. The Garnet soon warmed up, however, and when the first half was called the score stood 15-7 in favor of Union. The second half was almost a repetition of the first, R. P. I. again taking the lead as soon as play began. 8he managed to gain such a lead at the start that the home team was un- able to overcome it, the score at the end of the half being 10--4 in favor of R. P. I. Walters played well for R. P. I., making several long shots from the side of the field and in showing skill in rushing the ball down the floor. Brown and Buck both played well for Union.

TTIE TEIU\1 11-EPORTS Now that N en1esis, clothed in the insidi- ous garb of ''exatns,\ is forcing us to the pace that kills, we steal a :spare n1on1e11t to ponder on the hereafter. Of course, we are unafraid, but son1ehow or other, a feel- ing of awe cotnes over us. All would be \Nell could we persuade our loving parents that \N. S.'' is equivalent to \None Su- perior.\ But since this has proved suc- cessful in only a few rare instances, we are not inclined to try it. If we were all \first graders\ our plea would have no point, but occasionally a few fellows fall flatly to lower \F.\ What would happen if all of us should hear of our descent to the depths within a week after the end of the tenn? \V e are sure that such a solution of this n1uch-vexed problen1 is an absolute in1pos- sibility. That's why we speak of it. Our conscience requires us to keep these great unsolved questions before the public tnind. Furthern1ore, as one stuclen t ren1arked the ot'her day: \If we do get 'stuck out,' think of the good we do to such charitable organiza- tions as railroads and boarding houses!\ r.ri-IE SPHING r.rERM SCHEDULE Owing to entirely unforeseen circutn- stances, we have been con1pelled to relin- quish our plan of publishing the schedule of classes for the Spring Term._ It was found that a great an1ount of space would have to be used and that the appearance of the issue would have to be delayed for at least three days. Because of other con- siderations we did not cleetn it advisable- or rather, the printer did not deem it advis- able-to follow out the original schen1e. I,

f t I, FINANCES AGAIN In a previous issue we wrote at son1e length in regard to the rnatter of the Mu- sical Club finances. In that article we advocated the coHection of an annual tax through the rnedi11111 of \the College Office. T'here appears to ·be a growing sentin1ent in favor of such an arrangetnent. 'To our 1nind it is a .sign of the right sort of spirit. Especially at this titne is the question a very real one. \IV e are going to start the new tern1 under new conditions and we earnestly hope that the n1atter will be brought before the student body at the earliest possible tno1nent. AS r:ro THE GLEE CLUB The very welcon1e news that the pro- posed spring trip of the Musical Clubs will in all probability be a tnatter of reality, is received with tnarked enthusiasn1. The re- hearsal held last l\!Ionclay was by all tneans the n1ost successful of any this year. With only a fair representation of the 1nembers, a noticeable in1proven1ent was at once tnan- ifcst. 'rhe singing was conducted with unusual spirit, every n1an apparently re- sponding to the inspiration of the nevv n1usical adviser. l\1r. Bernard Mausert is a musician of wide experience, whose services to the clubs will be of the greatest value. The need of such an authority has long been felt, and the n1en of the clubs were not slow to appreciate the exceptional oppor- tunity afforded then1. Suggestions for im- proven1en t were received with attention ancl cottr~esy, and every effort was made to assist the director in the perforn1ance of a task which is never an easy one. We are pleased to note that at the end of the even- ing's work Mr. 1\1ausert expressed hilnself as being well satisfied with the worth of the tnaterial constituting the clubs. The news of the rehearsal quickly spread II abroad an& everyone interested in the work received it with gratitude. We heard nHtch speculation with r,egard to the n1ethod pur- sued in securing the director. \Vhen it was announced that the Faculty had taken the initiative in the matter, the highest hopes for success were entertained. With such substantial hacking it seen1s highly pt-o·bable that unusually good results will he obtained. We gratefully acknowledge onr appreciation of the aid, financial and othervvise, that has been given. '. ·- )_ - . ' JOHN CARY GARRETSEE Union 1910 I > \ .fohn C. Garretsee, a fonner meinber of the Freshman Class, died at the home of his par- ent.s, Mr. and Mrs. John 0. Garretsee, Lancas~ ter, N. Y.} on Friday, March 15th. Death was caused by a two weeks' illness resulting in spinal meningitis. .Besides the parents, one sister survives. 'f'he deceased remained in College but two months, at the end of which time he was called horne by the serious illness of his father. Dur- ing his brief stay he took a prominent part in class activities and won a large number of warm friends, whe> have been deeply affected by his untimely end. The burial occurred at 3: 3 0 o'clock on the a'fternoon of Monday, March 18th, at the Lan- caster Rural Cemetery. The undergraduates were represented by Jesse A. De Mey of the Senior class, who acted as one of the honorary pall bearers. Floral tributes were sent by the members of the .Freshman class and by about twenty students of the other classes. Resolutions of Sympathy The Freshmen class of Un:on College, Sche- nectady, New York, at a meeting held on March sixteenth, adopted the following resolutions:

12 THE CONC:ORDIENSIS To M:rs. and Mr. .John 0. Garretsee,. mother and father of our friend a.nd classmate, John Garretsee, deceased: l{esolved, That whereas our kind and loving Heavenly Father has deemed it wise and best to take from us your son, and our brotbev, that we, his classmates in College, extend to you our most sincere sy1npathy in this your great be- reavement.

Intercollegiate Basketball relations between WiBia..ms and Yale are rather strained, according to an edi- torial in the \Williams R.ecord.\ It appears that Yale failed to send the 'Varsity as stipu- lated and the team that was sent suffered de- feat by the overwhelming score of 7 4: to 6. * * * Cornell University will soon celebrate the cen- tennial of the birth of Ezra Cornell, the founder of the institution. Among the formalities of the event will be the opening of a new agri- cultural building. Gov. Hughes, Andrew Car- negie, Senator Andrew D.

Dartmouth received second pla.ce and WiUiams third. * * * As a result of a recent appropriatio·Ii by the State Legis-lature the University of Kansas wHl receive $780,834. * * * Nathan Abbott, dean of the faculty of law at Leland Stanford University, was chosen a mem- ber of the law faculty of Columbia University. * * * Ames and Boston Tech have abandoned the practice of the wearing of caps and .gowns by seniors. Minnesota is apparently in favor o:f ad opting such a scheme. * * * A debate between Colgate and Syracuse Freshmen will be held during the last week in April. * * * ':Frainer Murphy, of Pennsylvania, has stated his desire to send a track team representing the University to the London-Paris Exposition, to be held in England in 1908. Pennsylvania ath- letes have competed before as individuals, but the University has never sent a represntative team to a foreign meet. * * * Syracuse University is to add a large and fully equipped botanical garden to its resources. It will occupy the Yates castle grounds, now owned by the university. * * * Illinois University has an enterprising com- lnercial club, composed of students registered in the Department of Commerce and those whose major work is confined to economics.
