In Mexico, romantic land of pretty senoritas and languorous minstrelsy, practical American engineers have harnessed streams so that moun- tains may be leveled. The winding thirty-mile Maltrata incline on the road from Vera Cruz to Mexico City is now elec- trified. Ten electric locomotives replace twenty- three steam engines. The electrics haul twice the tonnage of the steam locomotives-and in half the time, with obvious benefits to traveler, rail- roader, and shipper. Yet Maltrata is but an example of electrical progress. For electricity is conquering the grades of railroads and of industry alike, the world over. Impressive, no doubt, but still modest when compared with the possibilities of electricity in years to come. And it remains for college- trained men, with trained capacity for initiative and leadership, to become ambassadors for fur- ther electrical conquests in foreign l~nds.
