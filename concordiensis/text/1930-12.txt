As I was s·aying, psychology (1, 2, 3 and 4) was discovered by three young Greeks, Thucydides, Themis- tocles, and O'!Brien, in 456 B. C. and derives its. name from Psyche, the Goddess of the Psink. The first experiment to be per- formed was done by a chap named Diogenes• using nothing but a bar- rel andl a lantern. The problem wali· · how many people would ask him if he tnought he was Diogenes. The correlation between the number asking him and the total population of Athens was perfect and the ex- 1 periment would .have been an un- qualified success had not Diogenes got stuck in the barrel and decided to major in economics. Sp~slt•EngHsh Tests The scienee vras first given a pr-actical application. by the Span- iards in their \Inquisition Experi- ment\ whi·ch opened the vast field of psychology- in religion. Next we find the first ex.perimental labora- tory being es.tablis·hed 'by· King Ge9rge II of Great Britain. They were monstro11s affairs, as big as ships, and in .fact they were ships. The popular term a:polied to them was. \prisQn snips\ for some unac- countable reason. Here is a brief ac<:ount of an experiment perform- ed! a•boardr one of them: Problem: 'Yffect of Incre·afed Fpimulation on ye Various· Parts of ye Human :Bodye when Scienti- ~ic·ally applied'-by order of hys Majesty Kynge George of England.

White, Union College archi- tects, that plans are rapidly near- lag completion for the new College Co!Ilmons, to be erected on the site of the pre.sent Silliman Hall. 'l'.he buildi.p.g which has h@USI;ld• the Col- lege Chri'stian Association for so many years wm soan pass into the wreckers' hands to make way fo:r an eating place on the campus; a feature that has lon.g been needed on the college grounds. Proposed New Plans P:1ans for the proposed new build- . i-ng are being based on an antique des'ign of Jacques Ramee's, which was unearthed last summer whiie e:xeavations were being made in the rear of the Kappa Alpha Lodge for the original .groundwork of the famous Pritchard Memorial. It is pla~ned to have the proposed new building incorporate· all the salient features of the old College Union, the Library, the Memorial and Old SQUEALERS GET THEIRS Chapels, the heating plant and the new Psi U. house. The new pro- posed building which will cost $35,- 000 .. 00 will be three stories in height and the effect will .be heightened by a generous lobby as one enters the building. The name \College Commons\ will be inscribed in gold over the frant door, the letters be- ing- formed by duplicates of all the fra-ternity pins of all the fratern- ities in the college. As one enters the entrance lobby one will find a huge opal glass tank suspend·ed from the ceiling by wires. The ta!lk will be useful as well as beautifU'l, since it will contain all the varietie•s of d:og fish which may be used ·for dissection ·by the Bi- ology Department on occasion. If there are many occasions, Profes- sor Mavor will install his new r~ producing machine in the tank to reproduce dogfish when desired'. The ceiling of the lobby will be cov- ered with a gold' and platinum mosaic picturing typical features of ~ampus life, such as flies chang- ing sexes, babies crying at the ex- peri:!llents of Psychology professors and Concordiensis reporters sharp- ening pencils. It is planned that the wires suspending the glass dog- fish tank can also be used: by the faculty for wirin.g the students on occasion. Proposed New Plans The proposed 'new building, which will be five ::;tories in height, will cost .$125,000.00 and will be con- stl'ucted entirely of steel and stone with no apparent windows, and wiil contain a huP\e combination dining- room and cafeteria. The cafeteria DON'T CHEAT will employ all modern conven- iel).ces with a few new develop- ments such as rubber napkins, real sponge cake and the latest q:uarter machines. Miniature electric ·trains wiU convey food to patrons on bronze silver tracks, and a real station master will be on duty day an<l night to <holler orders to the kitchen. . The dining-room will be manned by a fleet of sixty Tiller an-d. Gertrude Hoffman girls, all blondes. The girls will be dress€d in a variety of costumes made out of silver, gold', lace, chiffon, silk, hajrnets and :aoleproof Hosiery. Tb:e waitresses will speak nothing but French and! the menus will be printed entirely in Spanish. Japan- ese and' Italian dishes·, such as · Sw:edish punch anrjl cheese, will be served exclusively. The new Colle>ge Commons, whicih will be nine stories high, an.d which wi11 cost $500,000.00 to build will be made entirely of plate glass, and ad'vance reports have it that it will be one of the most unusual build- (Contintted on Page Eight)

In addition to numbers by the Glee dub and: the Instrumental club, two groups of solos were rendered, one by George Van Wert, '32, and the other by Henry Froehlig, '32. Professor Elmer A. Ti-dmarsh di- rected both organizations in all their numbers, aDd in addition, ae- compaBied Froehli2' at Ute piano. The concert opened with a group by the Glee club which was follow- ed ·by two numbers render·ed by George Van Wert, violinist, \Sara- bande,\ by Carl Bohm, and \Souve- nir,\ by Drdla. Van Wert Plays Violin Solo Tb:e Glee club then sang three numbers, featuring \Daughters o.f Time,\ by Harvey GauL This num- ber is a modern c0mposition, writ- ten for four hands at the piano. The words are from a poem by Ralph Waldo Emerson. The Instrumental club n.ext offer- ed a group of numbers composed by G. F. Handel and Joseph Haydn, Clark's arrangement of the fotlr numbers was used, followed by \Al- legro Spiritoso\ from Haydn's Sec- ond SymphoBy. Froeblig Sings Thrt>f' Solos A group of Negro Spirituals of- fered by the Glee dub was very well received by the audience. All three of the numbers employed the rich harmony used so effectively by the negroes in all their folk songs. The first af these selections. was \The Promised Land,\ Moore's ar- rangement, the second a spiritual arranged by Hi<:rh, \Little David Play on Yaur Harp\ and the last the old favorite of all spirituals, \I Got Shoes.\ Henry R. FroehHg, soloist, sang several numbers: \Some Rival Has Stolen My True Love Away,\ a tra- ditional Surrey air, \Bird Songs at Eventide,\ by Eric Coates, and \Gypsy John,\ by Clay. The last selection was Edvard Grieg's \Land-sighting.\ This stir- ring Norwegian foJ:k song was pre- sented by both the Glee and Instru· mental clubs, and was so well re- ceived that it was used as an en- core. -------0,------- Professor Miller Speaks Before Cosmopolitan Club Professor Hugh Miller was the speaker of the evening at the an- nual social meeting of the Cosmo- politan Club held last Tuesday night. After the address members of the club served light refresh· ments consisting af ice-cream and cake to those present. Fifty people were present at the meeting. Professor Miller gave an address on Brazil, illustrating his talk with stereopticon views of cities in that country. He later showed some moving pictures that he took while he was· in South America, two years ago, many of which were interest- ing pictures of the harbor of Rio de Janero, taken both in the daytime and at night. President Tito Gomez-y-Gomez gave a short talk in which he brief- ly outlined the history of Brazil, comparing its ,great leaders with such men as Washington and Lin- coln in our country. He also told about the preselilt day govern- mental problems as they present themselves to South American countries· today.
