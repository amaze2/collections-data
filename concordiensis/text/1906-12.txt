T HE : ;- : . , ' .: '· . : CONCORD lEN SIS VO'L. XXX. UNION COLLEGE, DEC. 8, 1906 No. 9 THE. PRESIDENT'S ADDRESS. A Snn1nting of the Poilus Involved. On :Saturday mornir1g, the twenty-fourth of 1:\ovember, Dr. Raymond delivered an address in the Chapel, th.e :purpose CiJf which was 'llo de- fine the proper relations between the Faculty and students. Copies of the address ·were n1ailed lo the parents or guardians of all the inen in College with the result ~that sdme confusion arose al'ld still exi:s,ts. Mat1y of the people to whom. the address was se:n.t were entirely un- acquainted With the facts that consp·ire d to- gether to make such an ad deess thought neces- be maintained, whatever th.e cost. 'This is n.ot the decla~ration of a purpose concerning what has been doll'e, but indicah'S the policy wh.i:ch will be followed in the future to prevent any misconception of our mutual relations. If it was an atte1npt to bring the Faculty to tern1s, it leaves the Faculty no option. To yield to a show of force wou1d be to confess that they are afraid of results. and to confess that would be to lose self-respect and youe respect. I say all this in no unfriendly spirit, but that you 1nay see how the situation has been compli- sary. It was most unfortu.nate that more ex- cated, so far at least as you are concerned, by plicit details '\V·er,e not given for if such had been the case, much real anxiety and concern on the part of t:he parents would have been done a\Yay with. Very few of the 1nen in College ·wrote horne the full particulars, and for various sufficient reasons it was deemed advisable not to publish an account of th,~ matters in the col- umns of 'l'he Concm~diensis. It also happened that no really fair article on the matter ap- the means you took to emphasize your claim of unfair treatment. So far as the Faculty is concerned, the issue has bee orne clearer.\ Undoubtedly there is abso:l ute justice in thesQ words. There can be no use in discussing whether or not t'he students of a College are an1enable to rules of discipline as dictated by the authorities. It is a recognized fact that the enforcement of order rests with the executive peared in the daily press. Hence it w.as not or son1e committee to which power has been unnatural that e\On.flicting opinions as to the real facts existed in the minds of a great many people \Vh o are interested i11. the College. In referring t() the causes tl!at might have in- duced the setting up of Sunday night and the bolt from Chapel on Monday rnorning the Presi- dent spoke as follows: \If it was an act of reta 1iation, as some of you admitted that H was, it does not belong to civilized society, which never recognizes a man's legal or moral right to take the law in his own hands and inflict what t11ju~y he pleases in a spirit ef rtvenge. Concerni11g this, there is no room for conflicting opinions. If it was an attempt to show disregard of College authority, it was a dir·ect challenge which can have but one result. CoUege authority must delegated. In regard to the sptting up on Sunday night, we quite agree with the President when he says: \The right College spirit is certainly helpful. More than that, it is absolutely necessary, and the Faculty have no greater duty than to foster it; but the College spirit that issues in disorder and lawlessness and leads students to feel that what they want the Faculty 1:nust grant or there will be trouble, is not the sp-irit to be fostered.'' But on the other hand, there was one para- graph that naturally aroused resentment for it referred to the time when the President issued permission to resume the College meetings. On that morning many men who had done their best to s1nooth over the difficulty and who

.I 6 TI--1E CtJ?\CORDIENSIS thought that everything would he righted !by of it~ having been done on the spur of the rna- the students' acceptance ·of two conditions, were n1ent, perhapg, without a regard for how the a.mazed to lea..rn that three conditions were hn- posed. This third condition. was one in re:gar.Gl to n1aking the existence or non-existence Qf CoHege meetings dependent upon the possH> le lawless actions of a few--pot the solid oph'li10l.l of the entire student body. The President used these words in alluding to the matter: ''The privilege of holding College meetings jn the Chapel on Monday mornings was withdra:\vH because a condition which had been imposed was not regarded. It is true that the cond.iUon had not been form.ally accepted. It was not in- tended that it should be formally accepted. H was accepted, however, practically, for after it had been imposed and was understood by a:ll, College meetings were held and no -protest 'vas entered. If there was no intentipn to regard the condition, then it was not right to accept the privilege, or at least there was no just ground for complaint when the privilege ·was withdrawn because the condition was broken.'' Of course it was not necessary that this third condition should be accepted by the undergradu- ates. The President has the right to Jay down any dictun1 he wishes. \W1e do not deny h. is right, but we do deny the wisdom of such an added requirement after it was tacitly under- stood that there would be but two conditions laid down, both of which had been practically forced upon the student body by men who saw the crying need of maintaining CoilE>ge spirit in spite of all It is also true that no purely formal protest was entered at the office of the President. but it iR strange that some news nf the bitter feeling did not reach the President's ears very soon afterward. Furthermore, there '\vas a letter sent to this paper which was printed in the issue for October 27. ·we quote a poT- tion: \But MT. Editor, there is one thing thn t :.r~>­ pears to have been brought into the list of J'('- quirements that was not expected as it i~ un- fair. I honestly believe it was done without malice. This does not preclude the possibili-ty ~tudents would look at it. I cannot be:lieve that it i~ fair to hold the Senior Class liable for the \\'anton acts of a few individuals who reck not of the effect upon the best good of our loved CoHege. Such an irresponsible class exists in evcl':i' College and we are no exception to the rule. If we were, then the third restriction would fall upon us lightly. It is my firm con- viction that a great mistake has been made- the n1istake of placing our future in the hand~ uf a ff'w fellows bent on personal venge:nce for n·al o1· imaginary w:rongs.\ These lines we1·e very evidently written in a spirit of con1IH'Olnise. The ·writer ~aw clearly the inevitable result yet \vas not inclined to wax bitter as long as there was a chance for settle- n1ent before an out and out break occurred. In closing the address Dr. Raymond spoke at som.e length on the difficulties attendant upon Senior Eng:neers because of the newly required examinations. Several allusions were made to College spirit and smne reference will be made to then1 in the Editorial column. Freshman Banquet. At la~t the long-looked-for has come and passed. 1910's freshn1an banquet is a 1natter of history- one of the quietest most serene freshman ban- quets e\·er perpetnt ted on a smnnolent so phon1ore class. The Rensselaer Inn, 'I'roy, was the place eh·lsen by the committee for this affair of last Monday eveuing. That the freshn1en were not frightened was evinced by the '\.vay in \Vhich ahnost the entire class drifted into the hotel but an hour or so before the scheduled tin1e. A Jesson had been learned fron1 1909, and an icy fringe of policen1en excluded the first scouts of the· sophomore class, when they arrived at a late hour. Telephone calls soon brought over the entire class, but th<> buttref!B of 'l,roy's finest re- mained unbroken. So the sophs were left to the tender merG'ies of the unrelenting cops while the freshmen with their upper-class guests hied into the of the out c arrr gau spri t i.a li \VHS one prm 01' ' in p B bur spor cate chai Tl '0~ '0' chot, '08 Pres and '1 ( mich McG] 1 Free1 Pean wael1 Sean Ho· cur tl Aj 1Jnior POll to cu nighti Wje c~lnRsr

8 rCI:IE COl\fCOl~DIENSIS corporation is found in the banding together of the railroads fifty yeares 2.go. At that tin1.e only two per cent. of the industrial en terpi·ises of this -country were owned by .corporations and the renJa.ining ninety- eight pe'r cent. was distributed among the people. NO\\\T over sixty-five per cent is controlled by corporations; and, of this amount, over half is held by those that \Ye know as the great corporations. Speaking of the conditions of the public of to- day, Dr. vYilliams said that the common peopJ.e, rather than being lige a man cowered by the t~rusts, as represented by a paper published in New York State, the pubHc is a body alive to the present needs and conditions. He said that there are three relations 'Which every one holds, first to Religion, which inspires; ' . second, the State, which rules; and third, to economy, ·which supports. That the EJ.Uestion of the first two relations has been settled in the past admits o.f no doubt, but the question of the third is to be settled in the future, and those who are to settle it are the common people, acting through the advice of educated men. Continuing, the speaker said that the tendency of to- day in regard to the great trusts, such as the oil, steel, sugar and railroad trusts is, rather ' than vesting the power in a few individuals, to spread it out among the people. Twenty years ago the sugar output of this country was con- trolled by about 250 n1en. To-day 44 times that nmnber have a · share in the refining of the sugar used in the· United States. Twenty years ago firms consisting of about 1,600 people turned out steel rails in this country. To-day there are over 100,000 people holctt.ng shares in steel cor- porations. In fact, in many in.stances the number of hands employed by the. different companies is far less than the number of shareholders. But the fact remains that the big men retain a con- trolling part of the stock, and then, in what gond does this diffusion of shares result? Just as there is or has been an upheaval against the one-man power, the people have in the past few years, awakened to their responsibility and are gradually overthrowing power vested in a few men. Den1.ocracy and despotis1n can: not exist in the sa1ne com.munity. The technical student unde,r the old conditions, where the power was held by families the same as royal patents, has been unab-le to reach the top.

I. SPOKE'. \'The Lion and the Mouse.\ Today the den of the raging liron is warm enoug·h to suit even the lion himself. It \Vas not so some two winters ago. At that time scarce enough steam ever penetrated the abode of that worthy to keep the windows in a trans- parent condition. Naturally such a state of affairs \vas very uncomfortable and unpleasant to all parties concerned. Accordingly, one day the authorities respon- sible for this were notified. Then a consult- ation was held by the members of the steam trust as to the best method of raising the heat in the den without lowering the profits of the company. After some consideration a plan was agreed • upon, and put into execution. While the lion was out one day looking for more prey, the thermometer was taken out and changed. rt was fixed so that with the sam.e amount of heat it would register ten degrees higher than before. Then it was placed in its former position. W!ell, later in the day, the lion returned with his prey. After some moments, the air inside seemed rather chilly; he consulted the ther- mometer as to the amount of heat present in the den. According to the new schedule the heat \vas running some ten or twei ve degrees higher thalli. usual. This was too much heat altogether. Why, 9 anyone would roast in a room where the tem- perature \vas 8 3 degrees! The m1ly \vay to lower the temperature \\-aB to let fn some of the pure outside air. 'There- fore, the windows \Vere throws wide o;pen. At this sa.m,e Hme a member of the trust happened to be c~J?ossing the campus, and happened to see the opening of the windows. He, of course, was very glad that the lion had enough heat in his dien. Of course we do not know who were the authorities responsible for thiR piPeP nf \\·ork. nevertheless, it did work.

If ever there \vas a sentenc'e that is ab- solutely true, we have that sentence at the h.eacl of this colun1n. vV e are reluctant to adtnit of the existence of such a fact, bnt it is highly essential that we s!h.oulcL The only way any real defect can be ren1edied is by looking the n1atter sq-uarely in the face. This \Ve shall endeavor to do. \\r e have refrained fron1 pt~ b lishing any account of the setting up or bolt fron1 Chapel. ~o\v that two \:veeks have passed there has been tin1e for sotne serious con- sideration of the questions involved. Hence \Ne speak freely in regard to the facts, with the fi n11 conviction that· sotnething can and n1ust be done to retnedy this unfortunate state of affairs. It ought to be evident to an in1partial judge that all the error cou lcl not have rested on one side. I\'o\v that sorne days have elapsed it becon1es clear that a n1ost serious injury has fallen upon our college life, an InJury that de1nands the l)est possible treatment at the hands of all concerned if it is to be repaired. \iV e say this for at least two reasons. First, there is a feeling of unrest on the part of the nndergraduates that cannot easily be overcon1 e. Extren1e 13.ct and the unqualified assurance of a square deal are two things that 'will ac- conlplish son1ething·. In the second place, there is no activity in the college that will serve to bring all together on the co.tnn1on ground. lV[en in colleg-e n1ust have son1e interest that ahsorhs the natural spirits of youth, else those spirits are ho11nd to be exerted in the wrong direction. I-Iacl we played foot- hall this past season vve believe that such ;1 crisis \iVOuld never haYe been reached. Foot hall is the greatest ga.n1e that the i\tnerican colle~te knows. .A.s vve are p·oin~T 0 ~ (1 to cp: ch: < le1 pre act bal fin cnc col \Vh 11lt1 asr Yel 1 int~ ...., ~t1( aff< the Ina act of 1 '' fos1 . lS 1 Fac the -~ '' Spll Fac eve n1a1 \Vit: n our: . 111g\ ahh \' ace{ The Jl1('f ll<) C\11l t () 1! lo \ call

THE CONCORD1ENSIS II to play the ganl!e next fall we no\v take the opportunity of prophecying a cotnplete change r.·f attitude on the part of the stu- < lents. nasketball has not yet becorne pron1inent enough at Union to demand the active support of the n1en in college. Base- ball-a splendid gan1e in itself-·· lacks the fire and dash that sweeps aside all differ- ClH.'C~. Track athletics calls out the hest of college spirit hut once or twice durjng the vvhole .'-'.eason. So we again say that we 1nnst have son1e great and con1n1on enthusi- astn before a wholesotne spiri1: c ;n1 be de- Y eloped.

Until such a tnove is 1nade V•:i...\' helieve that n1atters will rest ex- actly as :hey are novv. The President spoke of this n1ov e whe11 h.::-: said: · ''}lour theory is that college n1eetings foster college S}Jirit and that college spirit is necessary to the college; therefore, the Faculty are under as great an obligation as the students to foster it.\ .And a little earlier in his address: ''For the cultivation of such a college spirit as I have indicated, you will find the Faculty of this college ready to lend you every possible assistance, to grant you all n1anner of privileges that do not interfere \vith the work of instruction.\ Dnt \Ve cannot expect anyone other than ourse 1 ves to take the initiative in attempt- ing to restore this privilege that is undeni- ably essential.

They surpass anything of previou:::; yean~ because of th~'ir large and vveH chosen assortment of pif'ture~. These ~houid be of great intere~t to r-\rery stu- dent. The Ca~endar consists of sev,en shc•ets and a very attractive cover of dark ga1·net with the Coilege Seal and Letters in gold. The pictures were all taken this fall by Pho- tographer \iVlhite, and there will be a great many views heretofore unpublished. Two slu:\et~ are devoted to the Alba r y departrnc nts of thE Universlt;v. It is vvithc nt doubt a representative collec- tion of CollegE photographs and no one should fail to get the set. rr-he Calendars can be obtained frorn Franchot, '07, upon the payment of $1.00. The Duck. Just why \they\ should bestow such a ·web- sterian appellation upon me, no one but my- self knows. Hence, I shall elucidate in orde'r that the curious minded may be satisfied. Th€ name was given me as a result of two circumstances. One vva·s agreeable enough but the other was a cause of sorrow, vain regret, and leanness to my fat purse.

THE CoNCORDIENSIS VOL. XXX. UNION COLLEGE, DEC. 15, 1906 No .. Io AS TO OUR FOUNDING A BI'T OF lNTERESTlNG :HIST'ORY. E'arly in the Coilege year the Editor had some co-rrespondence with Mr. Eidward Payson \Vhite, '79. the present Secretary of the Board of Trustees. Upon special request, Mr. White sent a most delightful letter, which we quote almost entire:- \In the spring of 1877, when the class of '79 was closing its Sophomore year, it occurred to some of us in that class that we should under- take the publication of a College paper. \T'he Union College Magazine,\ which had been a liter- ary monthly of excellent .standing for a number of years previously, was then about to suspend, or had actually suspended, because of lack of inter- est. \The Spectator/' a College paper somewhat like \The Concordiensis\ of to-day, which had · been conducted, I think by the successive Junior classes, was not continued by the class of '78. Consequently we found the College without a ' CollE'ge publication and decided that it would be better to start a new one, combining to a certain extent the functions of both its predece·ssors, rather than to revive either ·Of them:. The pro- ject was agitated and received with much en- thusiasm, which resultE'd in a class meeting and a decision to begin the publication of a paper with the opening of the College in the Fall. A Board of E:ditors was chosen from the classes of '79 and '80, and the class of '81 was to be repre- sented later. I had the honor to be chosen the first Elditor-in-Chief. Among the most active promoters of the project in my class were Fred Van Deusen, John F. Green, F. F. Chisolm, W. W. Childs and E. C. Hoyt. Most of these, If not all, were on the first Board -of Editors. I am writing without any means of refreshing my re- collection, but the old files will show how far I am eo·rrect in regard to this statement, as weH as ~vhat foUows. ··'The first thing that engaged the attention of the J:DcHtors was the selection of a name for the new pape:r. Many curious suggestions were made, some of \Vhich were ardently championed and as ardent:ly opposed. A1nong the suggestions which at fkst seemed objectionable to some of us was the Concordiensis. It seemed to have the un- couthness of a newly invented and barbarious LatinHy. It was long and difficult to catch up at first s.ight. Its advocates argued in its favor that itt expressed the name of the College ln a n.ew and distinctive form and comb-ined dignity with a.ppropriateness. These considerations had weigiht and finally prevailed. The .other names we theught of then I see now, would have· been ' quite :knferior. I was never sure to whom thP hono1· ,()f first suggesting the name was really due. but 1 :t:hinl{ it was credited to Mr. Chisolm. who certainly was one of its advocates. \'iV!ork on the first nurnber began before the sumrnel! vacation. Articles were secured or prom- ised: subscriptioHs and B.dvertismnents were ob- tained: and when the fall term began, these pre- parations were pushed along, and a contract was made ·with Weed, Parsons & Company, of Albany, to· do the printing. With the assistance of Mr. G.reene,. who before entering College had been a practiea 1 printer, we selected a \head'~ and a \dress\ which sho\;ed the style of a large first- class :printing establishment, and was as hand- so.me, ,i,t seems to Ine, as any that \The C'on- co,rdy\ bas had since. The proofs had been read and th€ first number was a bout to appear whel1 , trouble arose which terminated my official con- nection with the paper. \A Fr .. eshman, who had been initiated into my SocietY,. and for \VhOnl I had stO·Od sponsor, had be·en hazed with more brutality than was custom- ary eYen in those days. I had not been guiltless

6 ~fHE ·COKCORDIENSIS of such proceedings in previous years and, per- haps had no right to look at this occurrence as I did. Be that as it 1nay, in common w'ith ot:her m.embers of my Chapter, I resented it deeply, and was one of those wl:lo served notice on the ring- leaders, that unless they apologized, their names w~ould be reported to the Faculty. They were defiant, and after a :reasonable time, I was one of those who did report their names to the Fac'ulty. The chief offender was obliged to leave College. Great feeling was a:voused, and as I had made no 1 concealment in the maher, I had to bear the brunt of the argument. The friends of the man who had to leave were naturally embittered. One of these, W 1 illiam Wallace Childs, a brilliant fellow whom I always liked' and still like, was the only man to give me a reasonable argument against my action. He argued that in appealing to the College, I was like a man who brings a legal action for some personal feeling. I saw· the vici- ousness of hazing much more clearly when it was directed even remotely against me, that when I was taking part in it against others. So far as I erred in this, I have made apology to the man, now dead, who seemed to me to have the best right to it, if anyone had such a right. His de- parture from Union College was most to be re- gretted, and may account for the fact that the apology I expected from him was not made. In defense of my action, it may now be said that the practice of ha.zing at Union College has never since been what it was before. \T'his digression has been necessary to explain what happened. J\ly opponents threatened to O·P- pose \The Concordiensis\ if I continued as Elditor- in-Ghief, and I was urged to· resign. While it seemed that I could not make the paper a suc- cess, it was clear that I could wreck it, if I wished, but I did not. I resigned, and Volume I, came out as I had made it, without my name at the head of its columns. My recollection is that John F. Greene, whom I have already mentioned, was my successor, and upon his leaving C'ollege not long afterwards, Fred Van Dusen, my most intimate friend in the class, became the chief, and with his fine literary and executive ability, and great capacity for hard work, the paper was 'establlshecl upon. a solid foundation which it still ·endures.

Although the paper is the only one existing t0-day, it was by no Ineans the first periodica11 pu.blished at the CoHege. We took oc- casion tG examine some· of the library files and we found that no less than .eight or ten publl- caUons had been in existence, several being n10nth:lies and bi-we·eklies. A tull and excellent account of aU these (the first began in 1827), can be found :~n an article by Mr. Packard Palmer; '97, in Vol. r., of the Third Series of \The Par- thenon,\ :published in 1896'. It is highly likely that we sha!'l pubTish portions of this article be- for.e the year is ended. It is a peculiar fact that the early College mag- azines and papers were published anonymously, either through modesty or discretion. For this reason contemporary letters are the only source of information and the names of our earliest lit- erary men are in large part unknown. This is extremely unfortunate, for even the most hurried glance through the musty old pages, reveals rare merit in the writing-a wonderful ability and knowledge of letters, bursts of the nohles.t feel- ings of patriotism to Alma Miater and to Colum- bia. and the quaint spicy humor, that seems now ' to be a lost art-in fact, everything that could in- terest the most insatiable mind.

Hint3 on Tl:eory and Practice of Teaching (Some two weeks ago, Dr. Ellery, of the D·epart- ment of Chernistry, delivered a series of four lec- tureR upon this subjf'ct before the Faculty n1eln- bers of the General and El?ctrlcal Engineering DepartmE'nts. Th0 following article iR an abstract rf the fir~t t\Yo lcct. ure;::;.-Editor.) * * * :~ What should a teacher know? First, his sub- ject; second, method of presenting it; third, the ~tt udents. In addition, he must have a worthy d mractE'r. Dr. Arriold defines the essenbial quali- tics of a teacher as character, tact, and scholn r- .:-;hip and Prof. Horne, in his :most reC'eni bo·)k on ' }1~(ducation states U~.at he is the t·eacher Who is ' m:aster O'f the stt.!li>ject taught, :@f the student taught, of the science of teaching, and of himself. How much of the .subject tau:ght should a teacher know? '·'JP~' teach as much as you have to teach, you must know more,\ is a goo:d 1naxin1 for aH teachers to practice. H·e teaches lower branches of any s;u\bject better ·vtho knows also the h:igher brancl1es ·Of the same subject. It L:; not enough if the teacher's knowledge of the subject tauglrt stands only :a. little beyond the r:mge required of him in the eilass room, for he must continuany be at work adding to his Rtore of knowledge. \Why stay we on the earth here, unless to gro\-r?'' might we1:1 have been said of the teacher. As long as anythi Hg ~remains to be known., the teacher can not be said to know enough. A good learner and OHe who is a!r ... ways learning, makes the best t eaeher. And one's knowledge F:hould not be confi,l1ed to the singJ,e branch either, for the broader o:ne's knowledge, :the better he teaches, Ruch breadth of know'ledge affording more points of contact with the stHdents taught. Depth of knowledg-e in one subjeet, and breadth of knowledge in rnan y subjects begets enthusiasn1, which is sure to communicate itsei:f to the stu- dent and while ill~veloping self-eonfidence, pre- vents the true teacher from any feeling that he is infallible. No 1na11 can give the impression of \knowing it all\ llS' long as he hi1nself is con- Rcious that there is yet rnore for him to know. While it is true that a teacher must be \master of his subject,\ t0 borrow Prof. Horne's expres- sion, it iR equally true that he r.nust know the method by which he is to prE.s-:-nt .the subj.ect to the student. 'l'herc is no science of teaching a;::; far as any set l:a. ws are concern:ed, capable of universal application. in all branel:: es and in the case of every ind ivldual. One can not safely teach a subject as it \vas taught 11im or as he was trained to teae1J. it, for \7hile the subject rnay not change much, ti.w ind;viduals taught differ very g!~eatly. And the fHlly safe law of t<:'aching for a teacher to recognize is, \fit the method for the need (If the student.\ JGvery tE'ncher must have some ( i< s e n s d t~ v h w m vl m aJ an UI m, el: OJ so sh se' ev bli of ge1 wh

He gains very his tnental d~:fficulti<es, and the laws of the develop- m.uch, not only in inculcating knowledge of a ~ment and activities of the ~mind. given branch, but also in developing the power The ideal condition for a teacher is that ,in :to know, if he knows clearly and definite~y before- which he may cum:e in dose touch with the in-. dividual. All the great teachers by whose ~ex:­ perience we are benefitted to- day, gained their knowledge o:f teaching by contact with and study of the individuaL M,ost of us may not have the ideal condition; hence, we must deal with the student, not as an individual, but as a. class. Yet even under these circumstances, knowledge @f mental difficulty of any student should be eagerly sought, and the difficulty explained away. WhiJe dealing with a class, the teacher must always take into consideration, difficulties in the indi- vidual. One of the best pedagogues whom I have known is Prof. Rosenbusch of Heidelberg, who while a specialist and investigator always presented the princ.ipl,es and laws in his lectures on Mineralogy from several different points of view, \because as he once said to. me, \not an the young men will look at the subject as I do.·· But while knowing the individual, the teachEr must also know the class, \the general student,\ and here some 1\:nowledge of psychology is indis- pensable. No one can become the best of teachers who has not a worthy character. He must be well balanced; mentally as -vvell as morally honest: and positively righteous. Lest you should mis- understand me in the use of the latter term, let me .say just what I mean-positively religious, else how can he help educate \the spirit of man?\ Of the special qualities 'iNhich add to the per- sonal influence of the teacher, I will rnention, simply that of patience, which helps the teacher persist in his efforts with the slow student; per- severance, which enables the teacher to preserve evenness in manner, method and standard (A teacher must preserve his standards, without wob- bling. He will not accomplish much in the way of developing power in his students if he is strin- gent one day and 'lax the next); intelligence by which, I mt>an, that the teacher must intelligently :hand, how a day's topic ~is to be presented. Such a preparation of daily assignments of words dari- ,fies and makes definite the teacher's ideas about hi'S subject. While speaking of these qualities that add to a teacher's personal influence, I may take the oc- casion to say that I beHeve the teacher .should supply something of a stimulus to. work. He may by h~s own enthusiasm, which is always conta- gi,ons, inspire an interest in the work in hand. He .may arouse in the student a desire to know, possibly taking advantage of the fact that the subject may have a utilita~1'ian value. While that i.s not a Jofty incentive to work, it may lead to a desire to know for the sake of knowing, or to the still higher desire to know for the sake of being better able to perfor,m better service for others. A teacher may awaken in the student a sense of power, of ma:sterliness, which will :prove to be a strong stimulus. He must use ap- probation with great care and judgment, and never make use of sarcasn. The teacher must aim at a development of power, as well as imparting knowledge of truth, and in order to do this he must know some prin- ciples of psychology. Development of the mind follows a certain sequence. In g'leneral, sensation precedes preception; to preceive must necessarily precede reproduction. A concept must be form.ed before one exercises judgment and reasoning pre- supposes judgment. While sensation precedes perce~ption, the first real act of the mind is the latter. The mind first .refers the sensation back to the place from which it comes, and there to~ the body capable of producing it. The result of the two acts is a percept, or the presented object. Now, how can the mind refer sensations to any particular ob- ject and place, unless it knew such before, and hovY if lil\e causes produce like results does such such experience add anything new to our know-

ro 'rHE CONCORDIENSIS ledge? T-o get around smne of these difficulties, educators now use the tenn \appercep-tion mean- ing perception as related to previous knowl:edge, or in other words, ·~appreception is the mind's in- terpretation of the new in terr:ns of the old.\ (Horne). Hence the first maxim for the teacher, \Proceed always fro·m the old to the new, fro111 the known to the unknown.\ Knowledge con- sists in a discernment of agreernents or differ- ences, consequently, the necessity on the fact .of the teacher .being sure that p·ercepts are clear and distinct. Hence again, the necessity of deft.- ' nit·eness and concisness. The student should know at what we are aiming, what he is to be required to produce, within what limits of a sub- ject tests or exan1inations are to be set. Obvi- ously, the teacher should also be acquainted with the amount of the student's knowledg:e, for it is useless to proceed to something new if the stu- dent has not co·mprehended the old. If percepts result from sensation, the percept \Vill be as clear as the sensation is distinct. Whatever affects the quality of sensation will affect percE'ption. Among the influences affectil1g the quality of sensation I will dwell especially on \Attention.\ Whatever increases attention will prove an aid to knowledge. And that which seems best to increase attention is interest. Then the all important question is how shall the teaC'her sthnula te interest. (1.) A student will not he interested if there is not something new presented to him; but not even the new will be interesting, if it is not in- te1ligible. T'herefore, in developing the new from the old, the teacher's questions 1nust be so framed as to lead the student to answer by using what he already knows, thus awalreni11g a. sense of power; i. e., show him how he can use prese11t attainment as a basis for attaining to more. (2.) The teacher may stimulate interest by being interested and enthusiastic himself, intE'r- 8Sted in the subject interested in overcoming ' difficulties, interested in the student. (3.) The work assigned must be suitahle, if interest is to \be stimulated, suitable as to matter and amount, and the method of presentation rlear and defi:!1ite. AssignrJiJ.ent of :work n1.ust .always have reference to what has preceded, and hence, rnay not be left in any degree to chance or acci- dent; should always be regulated by what the student has alretuly done. ( 4.) New words must be concrete at first. Whatever point of contact can be found between the new, which ii. is desired to impart and any kno-wledge the student n::my alreo,dy have~ will very materially aid in comprehension of the new. (5.) The teacher, by every possible 1neans, 1nust compel application and concentration. All of these influences stimulate int.erest. In- terest arouses attention, and ''attention is the mot her o.f knowlPdge.\ The Branding Jack lVIason and I had ridden down to tht> A6 ho1ne ranch from our can1p to get our n1ail, som·e tobacco and a fE'\V other little nE'ces- sities. 01:1r camp at that ti1ne \\·as in a thick grove of quaking aspen on tlH· Hito Lean,lro, just below the point where it bn•ak~ through the Stonewall ty~·enty n'1iles fron1 the ranch house of the Vermejo R:J:nch in New l\llexico.

Only the male calves are dehorned, as later, when steers m·ore of ther:n can be crowded into ' a stock-car for ship1nent an.d with less injury to themselves. By the way, possibly, it might be said to be a wise and humane precaution. The cows are general:ly kept for breeding and not sold, and so their horns are spared :to them. T'his process was gone over with each calf until the enUre seventy-five were all branded and ear- marked and the .sight became almost sickening. ' Some of the calves were hardly a week old and weakly, and did not long survive this roundup. This is taken for granted, but what do a few dozen calves amount to on a ranch of 200,000 acres, carrying over 15,@00 head of cattle and a bout 1,200 horses? The only excitement of the afternoon occur:red in the branding of a three-year-old cow that somehow had escaped in former roundups. Aft_jr much difficulty, she 'vas roped and thrown and the branding iron applied, when with a great heave she threw off the man holding her down, jumped to her feet and 1nade across the corral just behind one of the men. Needless to state that there was a wild seramble among the punch- ers for the top of the corral fence. \We was sure plumb anxious to g.it ter the other side of that fence,\ as one of the men feelingly re- marked. The cow proved to be so wild (\locoed\) that one of the cowpunchers whipped out his six- shooter and \creased\ her. Creasing i.s shooting a steer or a horse through the :fleshy part of the neck, high enough to avoid hitting the backbone or vertebra, and usually has the effect of tempor- arily stunning the animal. A man must be a good shot in order to hit the exact spot and not hit too low otherwise the result would be the ' instant death of the animal. After \creasing the branding was completed, the animal was properly ear-marked and in the meantime she had app.arently recovered from the effects of the shot. Just as the men were about to release her and she was on the point of springing to her feet, one of the men grabhed her tail and quickly passh1g it between her hind legs, thre,;v· the cow completely on her back, and pressing the end of the tail on the ground on one side -of her body, held her fast in that posi- tion with the use of onl'y one hand. The animal struggled repeatedly to free herself but was un- able. F.i.nally the cowpuncher released her and darted for the corral fence, and none too quickly, as the maddened a~nimal was at his heels. This ended the branding,-all new to us, an old story to the cowpunchers. We mounted an_d rode up through the gap to our camp. The cow- Inen, qukkly rolling up their beds, threw them into the wagon svvl:mg onto their ponles and were ' off with a whoop for a repetitio·n of the recent occurrence on some other part of the ranch. .John D:.

He Si\-'iped the clappers from the bells one mo,rning and as a result \~illy'' kept h'is calculus dass until sundo\vn waiting for the bell to ~ing ::;o he could assign and discuss the work for next time. \'¥ es, Hank was a joker an right, buc that was before the incident occurred about which this tale is written. Late one night in the spring he got into his old clothes and left his room. His smile was sfill there but those whom he met and who looked closely at hhn could see that smnething unusual v---vas going to happen. For the past several days Hank had planned a scheme which he figured :vvo·uld go. down in the annals of the College as on·e of the ilnportan t incidents in her history. It 'vas briefly this:- He \vas going to reinove all of the 1narble sta- tues from the second floor of the Library and ·t1 is tribute them over the baseball diamond in the positions ·which they would fill n1ost appropri- ately. It happened that this san1e thing had been ~1()ne seve1·a1 years before, but Hank didn't know ~this, so he proceeded to carry out his plan. He waited until everybody was asleep and then made his way across the campus to the Library. 'The night was so dark that he could not see his Jland in front of him. He decided before he Teached the building that two could carry out the plan better than one, and consequently went lbaek and woke up his room-mate. The latter, J3ill, by n::nne, couldn't se.e it exactly as Hank did, .C:2\ren after he had wiped the cobwebs out of his e;res, but was finally prevailed upon to go and they started out together. They approached the Library, and fina11y after n1uch effort, succeeded i 1~ forcing their way in by n1eans of a window. VV?hen safely inside they found on g()i ng through t 11eir pockets they possessed just one match be- t\\' een thern. They resolved to save this until :t1ley arrived at their destination on the second H oor, which they finoJly ,reached by 1neans of their P.E?I1S€ off tnuch. rrhe darkness \\Vas SO intense and 13 the silence so oppressive as to cause both of th.en1 Rt first t& draw hack instinctively. As they stood thel 1 e apparently in doubt as to how to pr·oceed, the silteRce \Vas suddenly broken by a soRnd resemhllng a low 1noan and coming from somewhere in tne inky blackness ahead. Now Hank was a brave man, as was his companion, b:ut the effect of th-is ory, con1ing as it did, cat..A.~ed. 01em both to stand there spell-bound as if rooted to the spot. Hardly had the echoes of the sound died a\vay when a. sec0nd, n1uch luudf!r and more h ea>J:-\t- rending than Ute flrst issued apparently froFD somewhere allmost at their very feet. No f~ry frmn one undergoiing the bitterest pangs of agonizing to·rtur,e could have sounded :more un- canny and awful than had the last groan from that unknown a.byss of blackness. Hh:; blood running co 1 ld and his hand tremb- iing so that he could scarcely extract the one lone match frorn his pocket, Hank gritted his teeth. and nerve& himself for the task of finding 1 JUt if po.:;sible the cause of the cries. He fell upon his knees with the intention of striking ihe rnatch and as he did so his hand touched a :Spot 'vhich was wet and sticky. \Blood!\ he hissed to Btll who was close behind him. The ecl11.o was reiterated time and again, \Blood!\ \D'lood! '' \Blood!\ Hesitating to strike the light, not knowing what horrors its rays n1ight disclose, stood the two adventurers rigid from head to foot, their hearts a.Im0st ceasing to beat. Finally, with one supreme effort, Hanlr drew the head of the match swiftly across his trousers and the sight which 1net their eyes when the -tiny ftan1e burst forth vvas one, the imprint of which they -vvill both ca!::'ry upon their souls until their clying day.

It \vas with great sorrow that we learned of the awful catastophy of th:e seventh of Decen1 ber that occurred at Cornell Uni- versity. At first the news seemed hardly credib~:e-so sweeping were the effects of :t.he disaster. When the tnte facts became kno\vn the awfulness of the occurrence was only doubly itnpressed upon ns. Not only Cornell, but the nation and the entire Col- lege world were overcome with the sense of the disaster. 1-Iow deeply :Cornell her- self is affected is expressed by the follow- ing extract from an editorial in the \Cor- nell Daily Sun:\ \ 'Greater love hath no tnan than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.' It is in1possible to express the shock \vith which yesterday's. appaHing calamity ·was received at Cornell. The news of the destruction of one of our 1nost beautiful buildings and the deaths of those who had been in our n1idst but a few hours before, fell as a pall upon the entire community. i\11 undergraduate activities have been postponed, and all personal interests are lost sight of in the presence of a comn1on sorrow. \\T e are pl ungecl in to grief over the loss of cornrades who in life con1manded the love and respect of aU \vho kne\v them, and who in their last hours looked death in the face with courage that n1ade us wonder. Cotn pared to this, the loss of a mansion \'vVhich \Vas the pride and. beauty of our Campus, is as nothing.\ True heroism and devotion to friendship were the cardinal virtues attendant upon the sad affair. The exhibition of such qualities afford a striking cotnmentary upon what constitutes real manhood. All honor to thoes who gave up their lives in the endeavor to save their fellows! Syracuse is thinking of organizing a lacrosse team during the year.

THE CONCORDIENSIS 15 THE NEXT IS.StfE. With this present number we shall sus-- pend publication until the r2th of January. The throes of exan1ination of exanlination week and the prevaling happiness of the gladdest season of the year wili he suffi- cient to divert our attention frona· a labobr that is as exa·cting as it is fttll of joy for service to Aln1a l\1ater. 'To all who have worked with us we are tnost grateful, es- pecially to d1ose sons of old Ur1ion who in the stress of a busy profess~ional life, have evinced enough n1aterial interest to tnake the publication of this issue such. as it is. To these and to all others who read this little paper, we extend our sincere wishes for the tTI·erriest of Christmases ;. we joyfu Tly send you a \vord of good cheer. AS TO THE SCHEDULE. No clou bt many of the men in College ·will be surprised to find that we have not printed the schedule of exatn inations. We dislike to deviate fron1 custon1 but circt1n1- stances see1n to warrant our departure from the usual order of things. Our col- umns are taken up with such an an1ount of extra rna terial that the question of space plays an itnportant part. Experience too, has proved that confusion arises from the conflicting staten1ents of the bulletin board and the paper, due to the fact that many changes are n1ade between Thursday night -when we go to press-and :Saturday n1orning-when the schedule is due to ap- pear. THE QUARTETTE. It has lately come to our notice that the quartette is not recognized officially as a regularly constituted portion of our under- graduate organization. It is highly es- sential that sotne action be taken by tneans of which this excellent branch of our ac- tivities shall he placed on a footing of equality with our other College interests. ,, \1\Te take this view for the reason that we are acquainted with son1e of th·e eletn,ents that urge favorable action on the part of the a11thorities.. 1\s is well known the quartette in the past two years has ren- dered service that is highly deserving of an expression of fonnal approbation. Such an expression n1ay best be given by action that will restdt in the forn1ation of another regularly constituted body working for the honor of Old Union. In support of our staten1ent that the quartette has rendered service to the 'Col- lege, \Ve need refer to but two n1eans by which such service has been given. In the latter part of Novetnber the New York State C~onference of Religions was held in this city, partly under th'e auspices of Union University. For this Conference the 111en1bers of the quartette gladly and willingly did extra work to prepare them- selyes for an appearance' that would be creclitahle to the University. There is no question that this extra work called forth \vell n1erited praise. Fron1 the stand-point of many \vho are interested in the quar- tette this was an exhibition of College spirit that expresses itself in no uncertain tern1s. Thursday night too. the quartette acquitt- ed itself in a n1ost adn1irable n1anner at the A hunni dinner in New York City. This is a regular feature attendant upon the dinner ancl is son1ething toward which the Alnn1ni look with keen 1'elish. If it should by any possible chance be on1 itted we dare say that a large portion of the enjoyn1ent of the occasion would be elin1inated. These tvvo points have been considered largely fron1 the view-point of the effect upon the 1\h.ttnni and the immediate friends of the College as regards their own per- ~onal enjoyment. \1\r e confidently say that this enjoyn1ent is due in very large meas- ure to the artistic abilities of the n1en on

IO 'I'I-IE CONCORDIENSIS the quartette. 1'his year, as last, each tnan is a n1 nsician of no tnean ability; each is capah!e of rendering a sol:o with finish and precision if necessity requires. 1'hough hut tvvo concerts have been given so far, yet the success of these two is uncloubtecl. In each case the reception accorded \Vas \Nann and entlntsiastic. Al- ready the n1anager has received several re~ quests for concerts to be given, in the near future. )\llcl so we feel justified in. saying that the quartette has given an1ple proof of its worth not only as a source of pleasure to our .:\.lutnni and friends, but also as a body that is far frotn lacking the essentials that go to 1nake up an artistic success. Granting that the quartette is an artistic success, are \Ve not correct in rnaintaining that its abilities should not be confined solely to a few sn1all towns in the in1n1e- diate vicinity? ~ In other words, it is not a goocl plan to bring the College into fay- roable notice in as 111any places as pos- sible? \\T e are well a ware of th.e fact that ·we have touched upon a point that 1nay be called \'sordid\ or \1nercenary.·· but never- theless, \Ve holcl that it is a sound, solid business principle which is e:xpressecl by the words \Advertising pays.'' Every i1npression 1nacle upon the public n1incl reflects eli recti y upon the source of the in1pression. If then we are confident that we can 111ake a favorable itnpression why not try?
