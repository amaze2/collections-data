Union will field practically the same team as last Saturday when t)J.ey scored a 13-6 triuiil.ph over the University of Vermont. The backfield will consist of Ed Janulionis in the quarterback slot, Roger Olson at fullback and Don Root and Dick Lounsbury at left and right halfback, 're- spectively. Barring injuries, the line will be made up of Rex Saw- yer, Ton;r Coccozo, Sam .Arm- strong, Jerry Riggi, Gary Gil- more, Jerry Faeth, and Chet Ca- voli, starting from the right side and going across. As last week, the starting team will present a hard running at- tack and tough defense, especi· ally on the line. Union's chances depend upon the first string line's durability, as the Dutchmen a.re very weak in defensive bench strength. Only three substitutes were used against Vermont, and those. only at the· end of the game. In contrast, Amhel'st, who suf· fered a 28-7 defeat at the hands of Springfield, 'was able to al· ternate almost two entire teams. Union reserves who might see action tomorrow are: linemen Sawyers, Schenley, Sullivan; Carl- son, Johanson and Zangrando; and backs Reynolds, McDermott, and Cole. As Amherst threw 25 passes against Springfield, Hammer· strom hopes that the Garnet pass defense will be as successful as it was against the Catamounts, when seven out of 18 passes were intercepted. This, however, has much to do with Union's quick rushing line since it forces the 'passer to throw off balance. Field Experienced Squad The Lord J cffs, led by Captaan Bob King, stitr center, will field an experienced and hard hitting squad, including 14 remaining let- termen, trying to rebound from the Springfield defeat. King, a senior, is the team sparkplug, and should be out- standing although he saw no ac- tion last year, sustaining an in- jury in t:he first game of the s!).a- son. However, the Garnet can expect plenty of trouble from him tomorrow. The backfield will probably ·consist of Jim Connors,. a good left hand passer and haxd runner, Hutch Tibbets, an elus- ive broken field runner, John Deligeorge, the leading back ()n last season's freshman team, and Jim Krumsie)t, a strong defensive player. Th~;~ Jeffs will present a for- midable line, boasting nine let- termen. Three juniors, Dave Ste- phen,. Jim Sabin, and Pete Jen- kins, all with experience and good size, will alternate at the ends, while Jack Shepard and Bill Donahue, two senior veter· ans, will start at guard. · Overall; the Jeffs figure to be a better defensive team than last year when they whipped the Dutchmen 20-6 in Schenectady.

A Fairer Chance At this time of year, fraternity spilit is at its highest pitch and the import of fraternities on the lives of the first year students at Union is reflected in the tensions con- nected with, and the energy devoted to, rushing. This newspaper has often belaboreq. various aspects of the fra- ternity system because its more obvious evils afford prime targets for such attacks. Yet, the purpose of these criti- cisms is not the dest1-uction of traditions which have been entrenched at Union for over 125 years. Instead, it is hoped that changes which can be worked within the exist- ing framework will someday come to fruition. It would seem that any plausible alteration in the rushing setup, resulting in a fairer and more equitable treatment of a larger body of students than can presently be encompassed, would indeed be a welcome one. Deferred Rushing By Ira. Halperin The purpose of the fraternity system in American colleges and uni·versities was at one Ume dur- ing its history to promote friend- ship and, welfare among the stu- dents. As these institutions grew, the fraternity system grew apace, and, in many instances a smaller college found that this system be- came a useful means of pro~iding bed and board as well as the spirit of brotherhood for its undergraduates. An unfortunate tende:v,cy, however, developed con- currently with the fraternities and acted to deprive the majority of the students from deriving the greatest benefits from the advan~ tages of fraternity life. This tendency has manifested itself in the manner in which the incoming freshmen cla..s&es have been rushed and pledged and it usually involves means through which minority opinions can in- fluence a muc;b. larger group. Such a tendency is, however, in- herent in human nature and try- ing to root it out in Its entirety would probably destroy the fra- ternity system altogether. tant future, the date might be extended once again, and so ac- complish in a nu!lnber of years what f<ir many fraternities, would be disastrous in. ·One, The second :problem, or more precisely, obstacle, resides with the faculty, who feel that rush- ing in November would unduly disrupt the smooth course of aca- demic absorption. ';I'he faculty thus has consistently offered the student body a ~boice of two rushing periods. each equally un- desirable and each disregarding the November date entirely. But it has been my ex:perience that if the deferred date coincided with the two weeks ot• so immediately following the Thanksgiving re- cess, it would: also coincide with a period in which the majority of students ten.d to slack off.

Erie Elsewhere on this page is a suggestion for changes which, while not unique, are ones whose worth has been proven at other colleges. Their adoption would lead to a more relaxed initial contact between members of a house and prospective pledges. Both freshmen and the fraterni- ties would find that they had a broader perspective upon which to base their choices. The final bidding would be a process of reciprocal selection and would increase the prob- ability ()f happier weddings of rushee and fraternity in- terests. Along with this basic fault, we have at Union what I consider to be the least advantageous two weeks of the school year singled out for rushing, a period in which choices that will bind for four years are determined. Not only to the turmoil and excitement of a new experience are the fresh- rnen to be submitted in theit· first two weeks at Union, but to the immense whirlwind of fraternity rushing, and the freshmen are expected to digest all this with- out neflecting their scholastic duties. solution than that used by schools ''-============;:;!~ like Amherst and Syracuse with '\ THE EDDY DUCHIN STORY NAVY WIFE PAC J Be Prepared for Chapel 1\Tuch has previously been said in these columns about chapel programs. Another tirade at this time will add nothing to what has already been oftimes repeated. We feel, however, that some mention should be made of last Tuesday's \twenty minutes of culture.\ Dealing with first things first, it is too bad that so few under- graduates are familiar with most of Union's songs. They're certainly not as good as some, but they're better than many,-and once learned, they tend to grow on a person. The program, itself, reached a new low. With due respect to the speaker, who presented his topic well, \Careers ·in the Boy Scout Program\ is not a subject in harmony with the supposed aims of the entire idea of chapel programs. Well Done! Because it is easier and more controversial to write harshly critical items, praise for tasks ·well done is all too seldom handed out editorially. Here, however, are a few people who deserve it: To the members of the Freshman Orientation Com- mittee, who ran a fine program. To the iron men on the forward wall of the '56 Garnet footlJ.all squad. To Student Activities Director Finklestein- for the interest and enthusiasm he has shown in his new post. To any surviving rushing chairmen. To Randolph (Wally) Meyer, head of the Student Tax Committee, whose sharp business acumen has kept the Activities' fund credHs somewher~ near its debits. ESL Time Too Limited 'I\''vo weeks of rushing in which to form the lasting friendships of a college career! The individ- ual, who, at the end of this scant period, can claim to know a group _of men well enough to hazard the next four years of his life with them, is a rarity. And yet, this is the situation which confronts some 800 freshmen each year at Union. But to defer the period of ac- tive rushing to allow the fresh- men and upperclassmen time in which to become reasonably ac- quainted with each other, and not merely a;ble to recognize their prospective brothers at some arbitrary distance, entails two rnajor problem,s. The first is that many fraternities have been forced by circumstances beyond thelx control to base their an- nual financial security upon their pledges, and an extension • ot· the rushing period to a future date might deprive them of needed In- come, squeezing, in some ca.ses, the fraternity out of existence. The only ·solution to this prob- lem would be to defer rushing, at least until Novembe1·, so that the period of transition would not be inordinantly stringent upon these groups. In a more dis- surprising· success. In short, what these schools have done is to en- able not only t1l.e fraternities to rush the freshmen, but also the freshmen,. so to speak, rush the fraternities. Fl·aternitics Submit Lists After a period in which no ac- tive rushing has taken place, when students in all the classes have come to know each other as well as possible, the frater- nities submit a nwnber of alter- nate lists on 'Which they place the number and choice of their pros- pective pledges. The pledges, in their turn, submit first, second, and third choices of thl;l fraterni- ties they would like most to enter. Then ensues a :Period of clerioal \juggling'' and the choices are matched so that the most closely coinciding p r e f e r en c e s are coupled. The aim of t:his system is to achieve 100 per cent rushing, an aim which hits embraced not only the older purposes of brother- hood and student welfare, but also a definite democratic ele- ment, for if on the first \ballot- ing'' there are still' bids outstand- ing or fresh!men unbidded, an- other rushing period follows and these comparatively few unsatis- fied choices are eliminated as best as possible. As far as I can see, the only major difficulties to instituting such 'a system at Union would 'Qe the need for a. -defenoed rushing period and the clerical work it might entail. 'Th.ere is no reason why in the face of our present, rather confused ,and hapha<>:ard system of rushing and bidding, we can not establish a syste-m l,'e- sembling the one I have de- scribed. and dependable craft is ideal to introduce the enthusiastic student to the exciting air medium.· Activities ...

Paris streets with the reprieve The issue is not a dead one. It lies dormant. We do not wish at this time to spotlight the question. The glare would rouse it f1·om its slumber and we hope that that will not be necessary. We wish to point out again, however, by referring to the controversy here, just how important the library is. The modern audience, however, waving wildly in the wind. Last May we called the library the heart of the col- lege, and we would like to continue the analogy. It is a heart too small for the body it serves. At one time it was sufficient, but the body has grown and is growing as man's store of knowledge increases. The whole organism is handicapped by a lack of circulation and cannot continue to operate properly, In other words, we are in desperate need of a new library. On that point there is no argument. As a place to study, it is woefully inadequate. There is no more room in the great round building or in the annex for additional books. Some have had to be given away already. In a feature article in Concordy at this time last year, the desperate plight of Union's library situation was outlined. Since then the college has been moving steadily to- ward the goal of a new one. The $50,000 grant from the Kresge Foundation has provided the spur to a e0mpletion of the drive by 1957. Now is the time for action. Here is a project worthy of a united student effort. The lead story from the Colgate Maroon, reprinted on page one of this issue beal'S careful reading. A concerted drive on the pa1t of Union's student body, following Colgate's example, will move a new library that much closer to reality. It would not be necessary to utilize direct student con- tributions although this is a possibility. At RPI, the student body voluntarily taxed itself to obtain funds for a new student union building. The profits from the vari- ous college functions held during the year (i.e.-proms, jazz concerts, etc.) could be added to the Students' Library Fund. The HPC, which has had several hundred dollars burning a hole in its pocket could solve its problem in this way with little argument. Another suggestion is a varsity-alumni basketball game with admission paid by all and proceeds going to the Fund. Other similar events might be arranged. Pledges might be assigned to do several hours worth of odd jobs during Greek Week with wages being added to the Fund. If the entire student body backs the drive, the Fund could take on quite sizeable proportions. The facts are simple. The library is vitally important to the proper functioning of the college. Ours is inade- quate. Therefore, we need a new one. If the students don't care, why should alumni, or anyone, for that matter . In years to come we will be able to look at the new building .and know that we helped build it. Our labor will bear much fruit. ESL will probably no longer appreciate Will he get there in time to the spectacular in a cast that save the valiant heroine? or will numbers only in the thousands, the audience's craving for. blood but 34 years ago Griffith's por- be satisfied by Miss Gish's fair trayal of the Revolution in Or- head?

Meyer Hidden between the stalwart, ivied walls of the Chemistry Building and that young Goliath, the Field House, stands a small grey building. It is not a locker room or a SuJl'ply Dump. On the map it is called t.he !Modern Lan- guage Building. However by the students who attend classes there, it is generally called many other narr•es. The Language Building, like any other building on camjms, is steeped in tradition. Its stuccoed walls echo the sounds of past glory. They resound with the thud of military boots and sales- talk. It appears that the home of our Modern Language Depart- ment is a veteran of the Second World War. It Is l\eputedly t.he former PX building at the Rome, N. Y. Air Base. After the war it was given to the College as a present from the government. It had to be moved, however, to -the campus. It also had to be re- conditioned for use as a school building. This job cost approxi- mately thirty thousand ·dollat\s. The structure was officially open- ed to students 'in September o.f 1947. year in order to quiet many com- plaints, the College added a front porch. The Modern Language Depart- ment's residence is now officially classified as temporary. A new Language and Mathematics Building is expected to be con- structed after the eventual com- pletion of the library. However, the word \temporary\ In this case may be defined as an indef- inite period of time depending on the wealth and generosity of the alumni. In ot'her words, there will be a waiting stage of at least twenty years. In twenty years who knows what might happen. In twenty years, the •College might add a back porch. How- ever, in twenty years will the Langua.ge Building still be serv- iceable? •Moreover, if it is still usable, would not the cost of con- stant repairs be greater than the cost of a new building.

Figuring in the scoring for Union were Roger Olson, who bit pay- dirt twice, and Don Root and Andy Reynolds, who each scored a touchdown. Rex Sawyer kicked three of four E>xtra points. On offense, the Garnet moved the bal very well, picking up 253 yards, 150 on the ground and 153 through the air. Summary: Union (~7) EJXDS-Sawyer.

The program is three-fold.

On tbe program are two s·hort, experimental produc- tions. Tbe first will be a poetic tl'ag- edy, directed •by Mr. Forre-st Read and starring 'Richard Levine, a junior. Follcw.1ng this play will be a short ex:cerpt from one of the lesser known English come- dies, directed by Mr. Alan .Nel- son. The two pieces <w11! be present· ed tonight only, to a predomin- antly campus and faculty audi- ence, and will em.ploy C>nly the barest technical necessities of the theatre. They are basically 1\0rltshop productions, designed as a tralning area for future Mountebanks.

Unattended Meeting Are athletics at Union perfect, or nearly so? It would appear that way. A meeting with the Athletic Depart- ment, in which anyone could air his gripes or comment on the sports situation het·e, was scheduled for 7:30 P.M. last Wednesday in the Hale House Lounge. Faculty members at the meeting outnumbered the students by a 2-1 ratio, and only two professors were present, Messrs. Ketz and Lawrence. On top of that, the lone senior had admit- tedly come to cover any possible story which mig-ht result fm: Coneordy. The answer to the question posed at the beginning of this article is certainly not yes, and judging from the talk on campus, the students can't possibly feeLthat athletics here are as good as they could be. Student representa- tives, meeting with the Board of Visitors for the Athletic Department last Saturday, discussed in no uncertain terms the shortcomings of our sports system. Why, then, was the meeting virtually unattended ? The full answer to that question won't appear here. Rules by Which a Great Department May Be Reduced To a Ridiculous One; P1·esented to Any Would-Be Professor, As Be Ente1•s Upon His Occupation By Richard W. Lewis (witb. a.polog·ies t() B. Franldin) An ancient Sage, boasted, that tho' he could not fiddle, he knew how to make a great city of a little one. The science that I, a modern simpleton, an• about to communicate, is the very reverse. Merci, exactly where did the Knight at arms wal'e up froo.J • his dream?\ The evident an&\'o er to this question .can be found ·by the sc-holar in the eleventh stanza of the ·.poem, and is \. . . On the cold bill's side.\ This Is not to be confused fl'l ith the lipe in the ninth stanza, which states \. . . On the cold hill side.\ for this is '\\het·e the Knight \'i•ent to sleep. This point can be bril- liantly argued in class by any astute professor. Or a quiz on an entil'e play •by Shak·espeare might include the question, \Who said, in T.he Mercfumt of Venice, ... it is a 11ise father that knows his o\'n child?\ This is dassif1cd under the one-word-answer type questions a.nu the proper answer is unquestionably, \Lancelot Gobbo,\ the clown and minor character in the :play. Yott will see from these examples that the more minor a point, the more ridiculous the quest1on, and thus the more poseful the quiz. An ultimata feature of the objective quiz is that the student, after several failures, wm tend to t·ead the next •\\ork :l,'or the objective quiz, and thLls fail to gain any value from the work as a whole. If you would desire marc sample question.s of this nature, I '-'OU!d r-efer you to the depart:J•ent of economics, I address myself to all profes- sors '-'· ho have the management of extensive Ji'beral a1·ts courses, ¥1hich from their very content, are become troUJblesorne to teach, because the multiplidty of their affairs leaves no ti n·•e for fid· dling. I. In the first place, gentlemen, you at·e to consider, that a great departrr•ent, like a great cake, is most easily diminished by divid- ing it into parts. Therefore, you shou-ld atten•pt to include in your course both those students in- terested in the subject and those completely disinterested. II. Since the most interested students in the lifberal arts courses tend to !Je English and Humanites majors, these students should g·o to make up the min- ority of the class. The alert pro- fessor should take care to include a majority of \fl~-()Ut'' engi- neevs, industrial arts majors, and pre-rr.edical students; the first, w·ho w-ill do the •work in the course, content to achieve a med- ium grade; the second, who are merely filling elective courses; the third, who are more Inter- ested in achieving a high grade, rather than any appreciation of the literature. These classifica- tions are especially effec'tive in upperclass Hurr.anities courses. III. Once the class is estahlish- ed in this disseminated. fashion, the next step is to gear the course to appeal to the most dis- interested i1ashions. This may be deftly accomplished in several ways: (1) Assign large quantities of reading. This method is extreme- ly re-warding since the \flunk out\ engineers and industrial arts majors -wdll not bother to read any of it anyway, the pre-medical students will have a large quan- tity of material to memorize, thus keeping their rr.inds active, and the more interested students v.m be able to read it, althongh heing totally incapable of glean- ing any satisfaction frO\m such a large quantity of material. IV. The administration can be of. much help in accomplishing your purpose J:ly overscheduling the sections and th·us overcro~Wd­ ing the classroom. This is es- pecially effective since it usually limits classroom dlscL1Ssion to the more vocular pre-rnedic·al stud- ents. V. If the students should rebel against your methods and unre- s]lectf:ully propose alternate meth- ods; i.f they should COIIllPlain to their classmates and ad.visors that they as students have no representation in the classroon '• and that this is contl·ary to com- mon right, you must first punish them as small children are ,pun- ished-with additional excessive readings and quizzes. You mn,;t then flout their claims, reject their petitions, refuse even to suf- fer the reading of them, and treat petitioners with the utmost contempt. Nothing can have a better effect in :producing the alienation proposed; for though many can forgiv€ injuries, none Pvpr forgave contempt.

The meeting was announced in chapel Tuesday, but in the long list of announcements, was un- doubtedly rapidly forgotten by most chapel-goers. Notices were sent to all fraternities, but weren't placed in the Student Activities Office mail boxes until Wednesday morning. This is not an effective means of communication because many of these notices get lost in the shuffle. As late as Thursday afternoon at 4 P.M., two of these notices were still lying in their respective fraternity mail boxes. (2) This second method is per- haps the rroest successful for the purpose in mind. In fact, It has been in use at Union College for many yea.rs and has 'P·roven high- ly satisfactory, The method con- sists of giving highly objective quizzes, preferab-ly weekly (and on Saturdays if the sections per- mit). These quizzes shcmld take no longer than ten minutes at the most, although they may \test\ an entire play, a 950 page novel, or the corr.plete \\'\<lrks of a great poet. The questions should be so worded that they may be answered in a single word or phrase. This facilitates rapid marlting and thus leaves more time free for fiddling. Examples of snch questions that have -been tried and tested at the aforemen- tioned institution are rueh as, \In Keats', La Belle Dame Sans VI.

Yet in spite of the lack of proper publicity, many people did know about the meeting. Included in this group must have been some who had a gripe about athletics. Still, no one attended the get-together. Here, apathy raises its ugly head once again. A long tirade' on that subject at this point would have no effect other than to needlessly retrace a well worn path of arti- cles written about student lack of interest. The whole affair, however, should not be dropped with a \nothing-can-be-done-about-it\ attitude. A similar meet- ing should be called with attention given to proper pub- licity. Then, let the cards fall where they may. We hope the results will not be similar. Call to Action We were somewhat disappointed at the lack o-f action taken on our proposal of two weeks ago to establish a Student's Library Fund. We still feel, however, that it is a project not only worthy of the support of the student body but one which should be undertaken. · vn.

But before the motor could be put into automatic production, one clifficulty remained: to de· sign 11 protective end shield that would con- fine any possible explosion to the motor itself. The man who solved the tough mathemat- ical problems involved is R. A. \Pete\ Powell - a mathematical analyst whose job is to as- sist other engineers in math problems which arise in any number of different projects. Powell's Work Is Varied and Important Because he is not tied down to any one p~oject, Powell seldom has two similar as- signments. Taking established engineering and mathematical principles, some of them extremely complicated, Powell applies them to advanced engineering problems. In doing this, Pete is able to make such calculations as the distortion of a small part of a jet engine caused by vibrations, the deflection occurring in a turbine part when it runs at operational speeds, or the forces exerted upon a rotating shaft by lubricants. 27,000 College Graduates at General Electric When \Pete\ Powell came to General Elec- tric in 1953, he already knew the kind of work he wanted to do. Llke each of our 27,000 college-graduate employees, he is being given the chance to grow and realize his full potential. For General Electric has long believed this: Whenever fresh young minds are given freedom to make progress, everybody benefits - the individual, the Company, and the country.
