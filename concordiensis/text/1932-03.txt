This year's dinner in honor of aU Garnet athletes could not have a better speaker .than Mr. Bing- ham. He is a man who under- stands men and has worilted with athletes most of the time since his graduation from Harvard. He wa;s captain of track while an under- graduate, then coach at Harv3;rd and has been director of ath,lebcs since 1926 when he was appointed to that position. 'I'he toastmaster for the occasion will be our own director of ath- letics J. Harold Wittner. The com- mitte'e has deemed it advisa'ble t0 reduce the p1 ice o.f tickets for the dinner from two dollars to one dollar and fifty cents. This, it is believed, will make it possible for more undergraduates to attend the dinner. Larrabee Describes Bingham Mr. Bingham is of the same class at Harvard as Professor Harold A. Larrabee, and is ably described by Professor Larrabee thus: \I have watched the career of Bill Bingham for twenty yea::s, and while I am probably preJu- diced in the matter, I know of no one in this country who represents a finer or saner attitude towa:rd coliege athletics than he does.

In past years the report ha;s b~en .the subject of a .separate publtcatwn, but it was thought •best to devote a section of the .Alumni Monthly to it in order to economize as well as to bring the report into the hands of the alumni. The statistics of the report show that at the beginning of school in September, there were 842 students enrolled; at the end of the first semeste·r this number had been re- duced to 816. There are at present 25 students taking honours courses, while 226 students averaged 80 or better for the first semester.

The chaperones at the Famous Metropalitan :Bari- tone Shows Unusual Abil- ity in Chapel SINGS FOUR GROUPS Proceeds of Concert Add Abou.t $1~00@ te Student Loan Fund By ARTHUR W. HEPNER Music lovers from all over the Capitol District were not at all dis- appointed last night when they heard Fri1edrich Schorr sing in the Memorial Chapel before a capacity audience. All of the extravagant .otatements concerning the artistry .of this premier baritone 0f the Metropolitan Opera Company were not only fulfilled but also given further si·gnificance by the superb performance. It is· no wonder that Mr. and Mrs. Walter C. Baker who made ·the concert possible should receive the enthusiastic gratitude of the undergraduates, fa:culty and friends of the college who were given the unusual privilege of hearing this artist of the fi1 st rank. The col~ lege authorities were also grateful because about $1,000 was added to the Student Loan Fund. Union College has heard many voices this year but never has it heard so fine a quality of tone, un- derstanding in interpretation, and strength of character before. Al- though the program was composed of music which no deeply interest- ed music audience could deplore, the music was so diversified and so simple in its beauty that every one who heard the recital left with the feeling that they had heard songs which rank high among the ma·sterpieces sung in incomparable fashion. Schubert Given Mr. Schorr's first group was five of Schubert's most beautiful \lieder.\ One knew the power of this baritone when one heard his bell-like tones fill every crack of the Memorial Chapel with his first number, \An Schwager Kronos.\ We feel sure that the singer did not strain ilimself to bring his crisp, sharp tones to every corner of the auditorium. In contrast to this powerful work, the next three numbers, \Im Abendrot,\ \Wander- ers Nachtlied,\ and \Nacht und Traume,\ displayed the finesse and bea:uty of Mr. Schorr's voice. These selections, written for the delicate sotto voce style, gave him the op- \Above all things, be not as the hypocrites,\ was the advice of Dean Francis B. Blodgett, of the Cathedral of St. Paul, Erie; Pa., in his sermon at the services in the Memorial Chapel, Sunday morning. Rev. Blodgett showed that the hypocrite of former times has been replaced in modern times by three types of persons, namely, the thor- ough-going sophisticate, the poser, and the charlatan. Dr. Day also outlined futul'e pro- jects that would be undertaken. One of these is the building of a new porch for Silliman ha:J:l. The second project will improve the pasture. A thousand dollars for this purpose has been given by the great-granddaug:hter of Eliphalet Nott, and D1·. Day expressed the hope that the Graduate Council would appropriate a like amount. The work will be done by under- graduates who need to earn some extra money. d 'd if h' d' 1 d Sigma Chi house will be Mr. and 1 acy · lS name was lSC ose Mrs. L. R.

The ancient hypocrite was a person whose head was unkempt and whose face was unwashen, but one who looked very pious. At present I know no single hypocrite of the old order, the kind who pretend to be mare religious than they are. On the contrary, I know of many who pretend to be 'less religious than they are.\ Wol'ldiiness and Evil The President also pointed out that before the end of the semes- ter $12,000 wiH have been loaned to needy students out of college funds assigned to this purpose. Honorn:s Cow·ses An interesting feature of Dr. Day's trea:tment of honours courses is the proposed exchange of pro- fessors of other· sound colleges for . the purpose of conducting exam- inations, especially for honours stu- dents. \With :the prospect of out- side examiners, undergraduates may he stimulated to read more' widelv and to think mor.e deeply,\ . said Dr. Day. ---o--- DR.

The topic will be: Resolved: That Herbert Hoover should be re-elected Presi- dent of the United States. The Union team, composed of Milton D. Lifset, '32, and H. Milton Chadder- don, '33, will uphold the negative side of the question. The former method of awarding the decision will be swept aside in this debate because it was felt that a~y three men who act as judges m1ght be pre,iudiced by their own personal opinions. The former de- cisions were given by the judges who listened to the debate on their radios and then telephoned their decision to the studio. The new method to be used Thursday will involve the opinions oi' all listeners. Everyone will be invited to send in their honest opinions concerning the merits of the deba:te as pre- sented by both teams. According to the \Interscholastic Debater, \it is hoped that such a broad repre- sentation of opinion will eliminate the factor of personal partisan- ship.\

Maxon Tuesday, March 22, 1932 EIGHT O'CLOCKS AND CHAPEL Two perennial sources of grumbling-eight · o'clock classes and compulsory daily chapel- might be partially alleviated by a new program,· radically different from the present one. It would remove the eight's by starting class·es daily at 8:30; it would make chapel non-com-· pulsory and non-daily. The plan is offered here not as a panacea, but as a part of the progres- sive reform movement which wa,; rec·ently insti-. tuted. Classes would start at 8 :30 o'clock. The :first period would end at 9:20, a ten minute in- terhn following. The second period would begin at 9 :30, conc1uding at 10 :20; ten minutes would ·ensue for reaching the next class. The 10 :30- 11 :20 hour wou1d be devoted to Student body . · meeting on Mondays, to voluntary religious services on Wednesdays, and to Professor Tid- mar~1's music on Fridays. The proposal plans these changes : it would postpone eight o'clocks a half-hour; it would cut the maximum number of class hours m a week from forty-eight hours to forty-two; it would lengthen Student Body meeting forty minutes; it would end morning classes ten min-· utes later; it would substitute a :fifty-minute, weekly voluntary chapd period on Wednesdays for the ten-minute, daily compulsory chapel periods; it wou1d lengthen the Friday organ recital forty minutes; and aid m mjnimizing absences and tardiness m the first and third period classes. The most strenuous objection to sucih a plan will probably arise over the abolition of daily chapel. Daily chapel, as it 1s now conducted, s a paradox, primarily because o·f its compuls- ory nature; men forced to go to such functions are unruly, and disturb those who actually wis.h Monday March 28th 'Enioy Bl LL a good speaker BINGHAM leading sport authority, an entertaining toastmaster • • • • • • ·• ..

One night I listened to a complete debate on the \Merits of Al Smith,\ by the cam}>us orators, Smith and Cop- lon, with all present contributing many- pertinent and timely re- marks. The College Union was the rendezvous of an intellectual agita- tion that always found self-expres-. sion, and many of us regretted its passing, altheugh we never aban- doned the hepe that something finer would some day rep~ace it. Nothing :followed, however. Silliman Hall Unsuitable Today we feel the need for such a buUding more than ever before. Silliman .hall is not centrally lo- cated enough to remedy this handi- cap the abolHion of the College Uni()n produced. Two years of stu- dent privation has exhibited the fu- tility of Silliman hall as a suitable building for a College Union. The present Silliman hall might be tem- porarily repaired to contain .a lunch counter, but if we get a new library which we should have, the aut)lor- ities might turn the present library into a College Union. No matter what happens, inscrutable facts point to the necessity o£ a new building, and as students we ought to .enjoy such a building. ----a---- Paintings by Picken To Be On Exhibition Dr. Wold Describes Sino-Japanese War Japanese Attack on Shanghai: Is Clever Bit of Strategy, Speake1· Says in the past, seven dollars. · Professor Edward P.
