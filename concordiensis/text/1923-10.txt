It is only with ex:.em- plification of this sort ·of spirit that the Garnet players can ho?e to win games and with this honest, unfailing .confidence the Union eleven can not fail to crash through with one victory after another. In the .first play of the third quar, ter, the Garnet made substantial .gain·s after Pa\lmer received the kick-off. A first down was made by Chisey in a \hv off lef.t tackle. St:>n1f'\ an-i.

A man ·who is :: g-ood los<:r is far better than a good winner. for the latter' is easy and that which is possible of anyone. Did you ever think o.f the feelings of the men on the field as they nre pushr-d back yard by y~r1l? They are doing their best and it is up to the student body to do like- wise and support that team continuously. 4 The team needs the support of the students at this ti-me more than ever. The ·success ·of the team hence depends largely upon the Httitucle which the student body assumes. Nothing is more stimulating to the players than to see the students interested in their performances and the student body could impress the gridiron men much more by going out •on the bleachers eyery afternoon during the practice session and cheering them on. How in vi go rating and encouraging it would be to the players t0 see a 100 per cent attendance on the bleachers ea·ch after- noon. Here Crocker recovered a fumhle made by Gibson and .prevented St. Lawrence .from makitllg further S·core. A .punt by Davis put <the baH out of 1 the danger zone and from thert ·on the I Union .goal was no longer in imminent danger. The final Qlllarter consis-ted mainly of see-&aJwing back and forth in mid~ field. St. Lawrence was penalized for j coaching from the si-delines.

Oil Building New York City CARRERE and HAST.(NGS ArchitectS A PISTINCTL Y new tendency is apparent in architectural thought and design today. Architects are designing in masses - the great silhouette, the profile of the building has 'become of far greater importance than its detail. There is a new vigor and ruggedness even in buildings which are conven- tionally classic in their.detail. · Masses mount upward, supporting the tower, accentuating its height. The new architecture is tending toward great struc· tjlres rather than multiplicity of detail.

For some unknown I reason. howeYe.r. the freshaen this year are painfully lax in carrying out this spirit of democracy ancl friendliness-far more than in pre- Y iot1S years. Certainly the frcshr:nen cannot feel elatecl \\'ith their superiority which they failed to sho\\' in the scraps at the opening of the y.ear. EYery man on the campus should kno\\· every other man and make it a point to do so. The detnocratic feeling which exists at Union is one \\'hich \\'e all cherish and of \'·hich we are most proud. It is the duty of all freslnnen to speak to upperclassmen first.

When Henry rang the bell If any bell was ever heard around the world, Joseph Henry rang it in his famous experiment at the Albany Academy. The amazing development of the electrical industry traces back to this schoolmaster's coil of insulated wire and his electro-magnet that lifted a ton of iron. Four years later when Morse used Henry's electro-magnet to invent the telegraph, Henry congratulated him warmly and unselfishly. The principle of Henry's coil of wire is utilized by the General Electric Com- pany _in motors and generators that do light cities, drive railroad trains, away with household drudgery and perform the work of millions of men. tbfie The bible class of Professor Warren C Taylor is rapidly irtcreasing in mem- hership, and an extensive study of ]:apan and the far east is being under- taken.

Purdue University Checks Up Students frequently demand to know what the practical result of high scholarship is. After years of unsatisfactory answers to this question, Purcl ue University nade aH in Yestigation and determined the answer. The method of procedure was to select 50 g-raduates about whost> success there could he ahsolutel:y no question. \Success'' was deter- mined to mean \the achie\·ement -of an adequate and correct ideal.\ Elaborated further, it was deci4ed that a man to be entirely success ful must achieve this \adeqttate and correct ideal'' in three ways: self-presenation (wealth), presei-va tion o:f the race (valuable ser- vice), and attainment of a position of authority. Thus a man may, be successful in one of these, yet not be a complete success. 1 1 The SO graduates 'vere selected because of their success, and only after they had been selected w·ere their scholastic g-rades investi- 1 gated. The rsult was astonishing; 100 per cent. were found to have i scholastic grades of above 80 per cent. The correlation in detail. showed that 75 per cent. of th.ese graduates about whose success· there could be no question (among the number were such fig-ures as f Georg-e Ade), had maintained an average oYer the four years of their university work of from 90 to r00 per cent.; 19 per cent. had g-rades of from 85 to 90 per cent.; and 6. per cent. had averages :from 85 to 90 per cent. This sho\\'s clearly the correlation of success after g-radu- ation, and high scholastic grades while in the university. This inn·stigation should do much to combat the increasing ten- dency on the part of undergradnates to belittle high scholarsl1ip. Indeed, many promising- students soon become infected with the virus of \\\\hat's the use of high grades? They don't get a man any- thing,\ and rest content merely to \get by.\ To \g-et by\ is one of the greatest weaknesses in our national character today. Our students live by that plan, and many are destroyed hy it; they have not allowed a wide enough margin be-, tween \getting buy\ and the abyss of failure. Nor are the students t'ntirely to be blamed. Little by little the faculties have become lax' in the enforcement of those minor points of discipline which combine to form such excellent training for the students. Courtesy, punctual- ity and application must 'be @etnandecl if the best work is to be ob- t;dnecl from the undergraduate. Does high scholarship pay? It does. The teachers must work hardt r to instill the value -o.f high scholarship in their classes, and 1 this can best be clone by showing how the student can \cash in\ on 1 his efforts in later life.- The Christian Science Monitor.

Cpon suggestion of the Terrace Council \VeclN.esday and Friday afternoon have he en specialiy sc t aside for the entire student body to congregate on the field and watch the eleven in its daily practice session. Coach Perry Leary heartily endorses the plan. A regular game is promised for eyery \Yednesclay afternoon b~·· tween the varsity and either the scnibs or freshmen, or both. Cheer Leader Leslle Donald has announced that chetr leader~ will be present and the yells and songs will be rehearsed. It is neecile::;s to say that the upperclassmen can improYe their reHdiction d tht: col- leg·e songs and it is certain the freshmen can use th:· aftcnH.ons ::;et aside to good advantage in becoming better acquainte l with the songs and cheers. Nothing makes a better impression on Yisitors at a gallll' than the quality of cheering and singing which the students show. The majority of persons who attend a football game know little or nnth ing about thE' game, other than that one man runs with the ball ancl <dl of the others try to pounce on him. In regard to singing and .:heering, however, the appreciation of the general public seems.to reach a level of better understandiNg. Coach Ltary has requested that every student upon attending the practice sessions sit in the bleachers on the east side of the field across from the g;1mnasium and to keep off the B.eld entirely. The <.a-operation of the students is sought in carrying out this request, which otherwise wHI prove of considerable inconvenience to the players. The scrimmages on \Vednesdays will not start before 4:30 o'clock in the afternoon in all prabability and therefore there is little reason why almost every student cannot come out onto the field and give his support. Signal drills will cCimprise the chief vvorkouts for the gridiron nHn on Fridays, except \vhen the team leaves earlier for out-of-town g-ames, ancl it is hoped a majority of the student body will be on han 1 to cheer on the players on their final day of preparation. The team is in mid s~ ason form and is playing excellent football. But four games are remaining. Get behind that team for the rest of the season. start no\'\' to beat Hamilton, and win every intervening ga1ne. \Union Colleg-e has the best small college eleven in the east,\ says a \\Titer in the Rochester \Democrat and Chroni-cle.\ ~1uch praise is clue the whole squad and Coach Leary. The Garnet squad has sho\vn marked improvement since its opening contest against Clark- son ancl is no\\' going at top speed. Let every student go at top ::;peed. FROSH PEERADE COMMITTEE At the last meeting of the Frosh Peerade Committee, Chairman Gale T. · wh:tney announced that all students· who have not paid their peerade taJC should do so at once so that Costumes can be ordered and a greased pig se- cured.

He rendered religion a :service, and a notable one, when he refused to con- demn it, as some ·less able thinkers than he have, but truly stated that functioned in a different domain and separate sphere fr.om that of physical science.
