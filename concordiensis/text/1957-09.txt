The English de- pai·tment and othe1·s are planning a comprehensive exam- ination at Lhe erid of the senior ,year upon which a .student can show the extent of his independent reading- and re- search. Are these developments an indication that Union is to enjoy an intellectual renaissance? Certainly the Eli- phalet N ()tt Awards to our thirty-seven proven scholars should provide an added stimulus to the care and feeding of the minds of undergraduates. CARTER DAVIDSON Preside:pt From the Editor's Notebook The complaint that l'nion has been neglecting its more gifted students is one that seems to have been heard often lately. At last something has been done about it (see above). · Spurred on perhaps by the College's recent evaluation by the :\licldle States Association of Colleges and Second- ary Schools the school has given 16 freshmen an oppor- tunity to g-o bf';\·ond the minimum requirements and take fuller advantage of their colleg-e experience. • This is a healthy step in the right direction, but we hope that it is only a beginning in the intellectual renaissance which Dr. Davidson mentioned. A g-ood showing by the freshmen may give added impetus to the demand to give Union students the opportunity to enter into a full honors program. * lfo * On April 23, 1957 the Student Council unanimously passed a bill suggesting that unlimited cuts be given to all juniors and seniors. The motion was submitted to the Faculty Council at its May meeting. At the meeting of ~1ay 7, 1957, the Faculty Council discussed the bill and according to Dean William C. Hunt- ley the p1·oposal was met with favorably and referred to Presto Changeo By Mel Einhorn Suppressed chuckles, sly sneers and hidden gu:tfaws greeted the announcement in Chapel, Tues- day, that Dr. Franz Julius Polgar would enlighten and enliven ail c~mers to Memorial Chapel, to- mght at 8:00P.M. with the deliver- ance of a demonstration c-oncern- ing hypnosis, thought transfer- Economics 1n Szekesfehervar, and his doctorates in Economics and Psychology at the University of Budapest, where he was a stud- ent of the \·Father of Psychoan· alysis,\ the late Dr. Sigmund Freud.
