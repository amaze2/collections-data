THE CONCORDIENSIS NO. 18 VOL. 34 MARCH 4, 1911 UNION OVERWHELMS PRATT BY DECISIVE SCORE OF 3:1-17. Union defeated the Pratt Iristitute five on the Armory Court last Saturday afternoon by the s.core of 31-17. In the first half, Union scored ahnost at will and showed flashes of stellar work. Pratt, during this tim,e, wa.s entirely at sea, but during the second half the Garnet took a ten1- porary slump. Pratt then began to brace Ltl), but played an unecessarily rough game, the greater part of the second half being more of an exhibi- tion of fighting than of basketball. Union, for the most part, played clean, fast ball and did ex- cellent work in shooting and passing. McKh1stry excelled for Union, making seven goals from the field. Littlebail played well for Pratt. The game, which was played under the n-ran- agement of the Boat Club, did not start until nearly five o'clock owing to the non-appearance of McKinstry. Then it started with a rush and \Mac\ and \Chic\ were hard at work scoring. Pratt, taken by surprise, lost all their aggres- siveness. .During this half Union scored 20 points, holding her opponents to three baskets and two free throws. The second half started more slowly and with both sides covering closely. Union's passing ma- chine was out of order, though, and Pratt, taking advantage of this scored several baskets, aided by the roughest kind of playing. But after a few n1inutes of this, Union ca1ne back for blood. Hequen1bourg and McKinstry tallied twice ancl Union again took the lead. Pratt, under the Queens berry rules, played hard, but could do nothing. During the second half Schn1idt, one of Pratt's forwards, was disqualified on fouls, but through the courtesy of the Union players vvas allowed to ren1ain in the gante. The final score score was 31-17 in favor of Unio11. The sununary: PRATT (17). UNION (31). Little bail --------------------------- McKinstry Right Forward. ''' Schmidt ----~----------~---~----,...

The Union basketball five will meet Syracuse in the arm:ory this afternoon in the last game of the season. The tean1 has been practicing and training faithfully for the past week, and are in the best of condition for the ga1ne. The Orange tean1 is a fast one this year and it is expected that today's contest will be one of the closest that has been pulled off. Last Saturday Syracuse was decisively defeated by Colgate at Hamilton, but the tean1 was not in the b.est of condition and a faster game will prob- ably be playetl against Union. The annory court is about the sarne size as the one that Syracuse is accus ton1ed to playing on, so they should not he seriously handicapped by being out of town.

6 THE CONCORDIENSIS. THE TRI-LEAGUE DE'BATE. Union Loses to Both Colgate and Hamilton. In the second annual tri-league debate, Col- gate won both debates, Hamilton was victorious at Clinton, and Union lost to both of her rivals. In both contests the Union men were surpassed in oratory by their opponents, and this was in ~large tneasure the reason for their def~at. The subject was \For and against the Initiative and Referendutn for New York State.\ The Debate at Union. At Schenectady Union's team, which was com- posed of K. E. Walser, 'r2; James A. Barkley,\ '12; Walter D. Cavert, 'Ir, and A. B. Mann, 'r2, alternate, defended the negative against the fol- lowing debaters from Colgate: ]. H. Amberg, 'r2; F. E. Midkiff, 'r2; S. H. Conrad, 'r2, and D. T. Jones, '13, alternate. The Union debaters we·re especially strong in the direct argument. Walser showed that the Initiative and Referendum would bring into our government worse evils than those which it is de- signed to cure. Barkley showed th.at it woulG. not cure the existing evils in uur government, and then advanced the short ballot system as the best remedy for any adtninistrative evils. Cavert, in closing the direct argument, showed that the affirmative had failed to outline a prac- tical plan w·hereby the Initiative and R-eferendum could be put into operation, and then showed that the adoption of the direct primary system. would be the most satisfactory method of curing the legislative evils. Colgate, in their direct argutnent, confined then1selves to the advocating of a general policy. Their first speaker showed that there are ntany evils in our government at present, and the other two speakers devoted their time to showing that the Initiative and Referendun1 would cure these evils, and that it would be practical in a state like New York. The affirn1ative were all strong in their rebut- tal speeches. Conrad was especially effective, and it was n1ainly due to his strong closing speech that they won the debate. The decision, however, was not unanimous, the vote being two to one. The judges were as follows~ Hon. Ben- jamin E, Hall, Albany;. Dr. Eugene W. Lyttle, Albany; Prof. Edgar C. Morris, Syracuse. The Debate at Clinton. Un.,lon upheld the affirmative against Hatnilton at Clinton, the team being as follows: M. W. Bray, 't I; A. D. Marin, '12; J. H. Potter, ':i2, and R. L. Streever, 'I2, alternate. The Hamilton team consisted of T. D. Martin, 'II; G. R. Redenkapp, 'r2; F. R. Harp·er, 'II, and W. C. DuBois, 'r2, al- ternate. The Union team, 111 their direct argun1ent, showeJ. the evils of the present system; and then advance the htitiative and Referendum as the best retned.y. They showed that it wouid be prac- tical, that it was sound in principle and that there is strong precedent in its favor. The nega- tive confined themselves to arguments against the system for New -York State, and 1nerely sug- gested the short ballot and direct primaries as better methods of curing any evils than the Ini- tiative and Referendum. The Hamilton weekly paper, \The Life\ espe- cially commended the work of Potter, giving him credit for being the best de bater that appeared on the p1atforn1 at Hamilton. The negative won the debate mainly by maintaining that the sys- tem is entirely unsuited to a state like New York. The Debate at Colgate. Colgate, defending the negative, -vvon a un- animous decision over Han1ilton. It is said that the debctte w·as vvon mainly on a technicality, the two teatns differing on the real issue involved in the question. KAPPA ALPHA DANCE. The Kappa Alpha fraternity gave their annual formal dance at their lodge last Tuesday night. The chapter house w·as prettily decorated with greens, the tn usic was unexcelled and everyone present had a pleasant time. The follovv·ing ladies acted as patronesses at the dance: Mrs. S. B. Coffin, Mrs. L. Garnsey, Mrs. E. T. Lawsing, Mrs. Sellnow and Mrs. John I. Bennett. A SPORTING TERM. \Pa what is a football coach?\ \The am hulance, I suppose.\-Ex. = E 9

The n1en1bers of the Terrace Coun·ci~, at a re- cent n1eeting, discuss·ed the advisability of re- stricting students to the leadership of but one of the student activities which demand the greatest an1ount of thne during the sen1or year. It was thought that .one person is often at the head of so m.any organizations that it is practically im- possible for him to do full justice to any one of the1n. After carefully considering the question it was decided that it would benefit botb the seniors thetnselves and the underg-raduate organizations, if no senior is allowed to hold at :th·e same ti1ne n1ore than one of the following nine offices: Football captain, football manager, baseball man- ager, basketball manager, track 1111 anager, n1a n~ ager of the Musical Association, editor .... in-c~ief of the Concordiensis, president of the Christian A.ssociat.ion and president of the J?ress Club. If responsible for but one organization, a stud- ent could concentrate his energy on making it a success, insfead ,9f dividing his titne between two or three activities as n1any of the seniors are now doing. 11\! President Baker of the Terrace Council will bring this matter before the student body at the college rneeting on next Monday. If any stud- ents have any objections to this idea, they should be prepared to bring the1n forward at that tirne. BASEBALL PRACTICE BEGUN. Baseball practice has been start~cl in the g,yn1. A large squad of candidates has reported to Cap- tain Dunn,. and with the abundance of veterans on hand, there is no reason why Union shbuld not be represented by a winning- base ball tean1 this spring. As yet a cqach has n'Dt been decided upon definitely. Hardenbergh, IZ, edited the last nutnber of the Concordiensis. A call has been issued to sophon1ores who ·wish to becon1e candidates for as.sistan.t b-aseball n1an- ager to ·report to Assistant Manager Walser be- fore Monday, March 6th.

THE ~BASKET- ' T h e basketball season BALL SEASON. which e:Foses this afternoon will he the most successful on.e since the organization of that branch of athle-- tics at Union Co:llege. T·he success of our team is indeed gratifying to the· whole student body and all interested in the coHege, for while we do not consider success in athletics as the true criterion by which to judge any institution of learning, the fa.ct ren1ains :that victory or defeat in athletics tnaterially affects our standing in the inter-collegiate world. The victories which our tean1 has won n1ight be ascribed to various reasons, but •at the bottom of our success lies the abitity of the coach and the earnest and faithful work of the players. Never before have we had a coach who has been ahl:e to build up so strong a defense and instill in to the players so aggressive a spirit. Never before have we had a captain who has labored harder for the success of the team. Never before hav·e we had players who have trained and prac- tised more faithfully. Let the student body give praise to those to whon1 it is clue. s-TUDENT The tnembers of the Stud- PUBLICATION ent Publication Board, as the BOARD. Literary Board is to be called, has at last c01npleted the constitution and the by-laws. Much time has been spent by both the student and faculty mem- bers of the Board in drawing them up, ·and it is felt that when the Board i.s cotnpletely organized, a marked improvement will be shown in both the editorial and business departtnents of the student publlcations. The constitution and by-laws will both be presented for ratification at the college meeting 011 Monday. . Before that time they should be carefully read over, in order that any objections or criticisn1s tnay be made at that time. For while they are the result of. careful thought on the part of those by whon1 they were drawn up, there tnay be pro~isions which others may con- std.er detrimental to the success of the pub1ica- t10ns. When the class of 1914 graduates from Mt. Holyoke, secret societies will be a thing of the past at that college. al pt S< pl b< fc lc C< }@ o· b n c n v t

T'HE CO·NC·ORDIENSIS. II ~lumni ~tlu5. EDITED BY GRADUATE COUNCIL SCHENECTADY ALUMNI ASSOCIATION FORMED. On Monday night a tneeting of the local alumni was helEl in the college chapel and those present organized an association for the city of Schenectady and Scotia. In the past, these places were included in the territory of the Al- bany association, as w·as Troy. Last year Troy formed an organization of its own and by fol- lowing their exatnple Schenectady has given the college another active alumni association. The large number of graduates living in town, to- gether with its nearness to the college, should tnake this new organization a model one. No city outside of New York has so many Union tnen, the nun1ber here being 28.3. This first meeting v.ras most enthusiastic and was notable as regards the part played in it by the recent graduates. We hear much of the new spirit our graduates are showing and those who doubt the reality of this change would have been convinced by seeing this n1eeting. I:r. Richmond addressed the gathering and after short speeches by several alumni a constitution was adopted and its officers elected. This makes the eleventh Union College Alumni Association enjoying ac- tive life, an increase of six over last year. There are still three old associations that have not r·e- newed their .meetings and. there ren1ain many places where such organizations might be formed. The officers are: Gerardus Smith, '79, presi- dent; Dr. C. C. Duryee, '82, mayor of Schenec- tady, vice-president; Dann L. Wood, '97, secre- tary and treasurer; Joseph H. Clen1ents, Jr., '01, and Glawacld R. Parker, '03, tnetnbers of the ex- ecutive con1n1ittee. SPECJAL HELP. At various times this page has spoken about the kinds of help the alumni can give the college. On Saturday, March 4th, there will be a 111eeting or the alun1ni engaged in newspaper work, that ' we tnay learn the best ways of bringing Union before the public. The answers to this invita- tion have b~een tnost encouraging. Many of the tnen can not con1e because of the nature o£ their work but the interest shown by their answers to our letters has been of value. Our pron1inent New York journalists have all shown special in- terest and the college should get much valuable advice from these sons. Each al urn nus has some- thing he can give to Union which will increase. her usefulness. It is the purpose of the Graduate Council to point out ways in which this may be brought about. The newspaper n1en were the first called upon and they have ·responded loyally. NOTES. r86o. Wm. H. McElroy spoke before the an- nual n1eeting of the Missouri Manufacturers' As- sociation at St. Louis on February 25th. His subject ·was ''A Good Word for Optin1ism.\ Mr. McElroy is in demand as a public speaker, for hi.s sense of the ridiculous is most entertaining. During his career as a newspaper man in New York, he found titne to write humoTous articles for papers other than the Tribune of which he was the editor. r88r. Alexander M. Vedder, formerly County Judge for Schenectady, is now Surrogate of Sche- nectady county. r~gr. J arne~ W. Ferguson of Amsterdatn has recently been appointed transfer tax attorney of Montgo-tnery county. DEATHS. 1844. Walter S. Hubbell died recently at Can- andaigua, N. Y., in which town he had been a protninent pioneer. Mr. Hubbell left a large es- tate and gave liberally to many charities. Among these were The American Bible Society, Ameri- can Tract Society, American Board of Con1mis- sioners for Foreign Missions, Congregational Home Missionary Society and several local or- ganizations.

UNION C THE CONCORDIENSIS VOL. 34 . MARCH 11, 1911 NO .. 19 UNION C:LOSES SEASON BY DEFEATING SYRACUSE Union, rg; Syracuse, 15. Union closed a successful basketball season last Saturday night when her five defeated Syra·cuse's fast tea:~:n by the score of 19 to 15. In the first half the ga1ne was solnewhat slow, but both tean1s set a hard pace in the second half and gave a good exhibition of basketball. The game was played on the roller-polo floor and the play- ers were copsiderahly inconvenienced by the rail- ing around the court. Syracuse, heartened by their victory over Rochester the week previous played hard with the determination to return horne victorious. Throughout the game the guarding was close and many fouls were called, especially on Syracuse. These were promptly tl-.rned into points by Coward who was unusually skilful in scoring on free throws. Captain Ticlu1or play~td a strong game for Syra- cuse, while \Ton1n1y'' Fairbairn was Union's fast- est player. JVIcKinstry, who has been playing so \\\:ell for Union throughout the whole season, was in poor physical condition and did not appear at his best. Had he been able to locate the basket w~th his usual accuracy the score would have been several points higher in favor of the Garnet. The guarding was close, and for several min- utes after the ·whistle blew, neither side scored, Syracuse finally scoring the first goal. Then Fair bairn duplicated the stunt and the score re- n·.ained a tie for a few n1om.ents. Finally Union's sr.perior work pushed her ahead, and two minutes before the close of the half she was six points in the lead. Two baskets in rapid succession by Syracuse cut down the local lead, leaving the score ro-8 in favor of the Garnet team when the wh · stle blew for the first half. The second half started with a rush and it soon became evident that this half would be much faster and rougher than the first. As before the guarding was very dose and the playing hard. Neither team was able to carry the ball the length of the floor and· many of the players tried shoot- ing from the 1niddle of the floor. Syracuse, es- pecially, put their t·rust in long shots, but were not very successful, scoring but two of then1. The Orange coach made numerous substitutions in a vain attempt to stop Union's scoring. Three fresh men were unable to accomplish anything and when the half ended Union was again two points in the lead, the score for the half being 9-7. The final score stood I9-IS. Although at times the team work was a little ragged, the Union team played good ball through- out the entire game. Syracuse, too, exhibited fast basketball and good team work, but had difficulty in locating the baskets. Union, too, had hard luck in s!:ooting and but for this would have scored several more points. :fhe sumn1ary: UNION. SYRACUSE. McKinstry ----------------------- Giles, Blootn Right Forward.

HELD IN UTICA ON MARCH 4· Football Champi~onship Awarded to Hobart--Re- sign:ation from League Still Refused. A regular m·eeting of the New York State In- ter-CoHegiate Athletic Union was held in Utica on Saturday, March 4, to award the football charnpionship f<;>r 1910 and consider other busi- ness that n1ight be brought up. Hobart was awarded the gridiron champion- ship. Last fall her eleven defeated both Union and Hamilton and tied Rochester. Since Colgate was not participating in the inter-collegiate con- test last fall, the pennant was thus won by Hobart. Another matter which was discussed was the cancellation by Rochester of a dual track meet with Hamilton last spring. The Rochester manage1nent failed to present any adequate rea- sons for cancelling the meet, and consequently v,;as fined $roo. An a1nendn1ent to the constitution was adopt-- ed, which admits those who play summer ball on teatns other than those listed under the national c:gree1nent, namely, the major and n1inor lea- gues, etc., to full amateur privileges in the Union. In the past the rule which prevented members of the league playing on even amateur teams was repeatedly broken, and this amendment will prove very satisfactory to all the colleges con- cerned. The inter-collegiate track meet will be held in Rome again this year on Decoration Cay under the auspices of the Board of Trade of that city, which, also arranged for the meet last year. The Han1i:lton n1anagement will have charge of the meet. Invitations to participate in this meet have also been extended to the following col- leges not in the league-Rutgers, St. Lawrence, Swarth1nore, University of Vermont, Alfred Uni- versity and Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. It was felt that much more interest could be arous- ed in the meet, if tean1s competed from a larger nun1 her of colleges. The rneet, instead of being a state affair, would then to some degree cor- respond to the New England Inter-Collegiate.

The college 1i brary now has a copy of this publication. A complete account of Mr. Seward's life is giyen, special etnphasis being placed on his im- portance in the insurance world. One page .of the bulletin is devoted to his interest in and his work for Union College, his alma mater. A pic- ture of the engineering building is also given, the efforts of Mr. Seward being· instrutnental in obtaining the money for its erecti9n. Several quotations are given from editorial and press comments at the time of his Cleath. An edi- torial from the New York Evening Post is, per- haps, typical. It says, in part, \An insurance company president who knew precisely what an- swer to give to grafters and political blacktnail- ers, he was, where-ver he went, a standing refuta- tion of the· charge that all New York business men in high positions are there merely to subvert the liberties of the people or to tnake money illegally.

TI-IE CONCORDIE?\SIS. DR. ANGELL COMPLETES HIS COURSE OF LECTURES. By Talking on \Genetic Psychology\ and Re- viewing the Other Lectures. Dr. Jmnes R. Angell gave the last of his senes of lectures on ''Psychology' in the chapel last Tuesday evening. Dr. Angell is professor of psychology .at Chicago University and 1s con- sidered by many the foremost authority on this subject to-day, and Union is fortunate in having been able to hear him. This is the first series of annual lectures presented by an endowment to the college by Mrs. l{atharine Spencer Levitt 1n memory of her father. President Richmond 1n introducing Dr. An- gell Tuesday ,evening said that it would be ex- t1·en1ely difficult to obtain a lecturer for next year who would maintain the high standard set by this distinguished speaker, and also n1ention- ed the great intellectual value of such lectures to the college and the city of Schenectady. Dr. Angell's eight lectures will be published in book form under the seal of Union College and may be obtained at the office within a couple of months. Tuesday even1ng, Professor Angell divided his lecture into two parts, first discussing \Genetic Psychology\ and then giving a brief summary of his whole course. Genetic Psychology, he show- ed,. had to do with the evolution of the mind. He described the relations between the mind of the civilized man and that of the savage; showed the differences in the mental make-up of the human being and animal; and traced the evolution of the mind of a human being from birth to death. In summing up the lectures of the course, Dr. Angell pointed out the following facts that he 1:-.ad tried to make plain. He said that he had tried to show how the mind is related to the body; to describe the experimental method in psychological research; to narrate unusual forms of mental life and certain social aspects and their application; to show the extent of mental con- sciousness in animals and the development of this; to tell the great variety of fonns of mental life. Or. Angell also said that psychology leaves the question of future life in the real~ of faith. It teaches nothing incompatible with any one's doctrine and has no negative doctrine on this subject. A LETTER WRITTEN BY PAYNE SELLS FOR $Io.so. The foll<:)wing article which recently appeared in the New York Times will be of interest to Union tnen since John Howard Payne was a Union student in the class of 1812: \A letter 01f lohn !fliO<W!ard Payne, aUJt'hlor .of \Home Sweet ·Home,'' rerferring bo his fi.rst a,ppearance on ·the Philadelphia stage, s·old a.t auction for $10.50 i:n th>at city r·e.cently.

The second portrait hanging from the rear end of the balcony on the right hand side is that of Professor Jonathan Pearson. Professor Pearson was one of the fan1ous professors who was at Union during the presidency of Dr. N ott, and who helped to n1ake our college so fan1ous at that titne. Professor Pearson was born in Chichester, N. H., in 1813. I-Ie graduated from the college in the class of 1832 with Phi Beta Kappa honors and was soon after engaged as a tutor. Fro1n 1836-87 he was associated with the college as instructor, librarian and professor. He was a well known scienticist, his specialties being chetn- istry and botany. \The Danger of the Love of Gold\ is to be Mr. Martin's subject. Those who have been reading his \Passing of the Idle Rich\ in Every- body's Magazine will be especially interested in Professor Pearson was also well known as a genealogist, and he was the author of several books of especial interest to people in Albany and this vicinity.

BASEBALL The base baH team has started PROSPECTS. practice in preparation for the coming season, and indications at present seem to just1f:y ~the prophecy that our basebalJ nine will be aele to duplicate the suc- cess of the basketball five. Very few men were lost through graduation or other reasons fron1 last year's tea1n, and new material is showing up fro1n the Freshman class a1fJ.d frorn the Albany departments. The battery and bas,emen will un- doubtedly be the san1e as last year and the team should be strong fro1n the very start. But the fact that there are so many old players still 1n college should 110t discourage anyone from going out on the squad. If the Varsity team is to be at its best it is imperative that it have a live scrub to play aga:inst. There may not he as 1nuch fun or personal glory in being on the scrub as in being on the Varsity, but the person who is out on the squa<l doing his best, is ma- terially aiding the regular nine and deserves as much credit at the han.d s of the students. It is also important that all those who have any inclination or ability get out and practice in order to develop good material for next year. Those who have been practicing w:ith the college tean1 will understand the game be:tter than those who, like the freshmen, try for the team for the first time, and the vacancies caused hy gradua- tion can be more capably fill-ed. SENTOR BALL At an important meeting of the sen1or class which was held Thursclay noon, it was decided to hold the senior ball at the Mohawk Golf Club instead of in the library, as has been the custom in past years. The co1n11Ji ttee ~1ill then be able to reduce the regular tax from six dollars to three, and the price for the tickets will be the customary price of four dollars. Judging from the present indicat:ions the senior ball will be one of the rnost successful ever held. The dance, when held at the Golf Club, will loose much of its cttstornary formality, and those who attend will go for pleasure,\ a.nd not from a sense of duty.

1'1-lE CONC<Ji\.DlENSIS. 1 I EDITED BY GRADUATE COUNCIL PRESS MEE'TlNG. The first of what we hope will be many direct calls for professional help from the alumni, was that asked by the Press Club of the college and the Graduate Council last week. On Saturday a n1eeting o{ newspaper and advertising rnen was · held, that we tnight profit by their advice as to the best ways of keeping the college before the public Those present were: W tn. J. Kline, '72; Thomas C. Lawler, '86; Horatio M. Pollock, '95; F. R. Champion, '99; E. R. Cullings, 'oo; Dudley T. Hill, '07; Thomas C. Hanigan, 'o8, and Philip Hill, 'rz. In a session of two hours these men discussed with the Press Club the question of publicity. Several new fields were pointed out and the best ways of sending news discussed. A record was kept of what was said and from this, together with the advice given in letters received from those who could not attend, a report will ht> prepared which will serve as a guide for future work in this direction. Frc m the nature of this profession, it was llTI- possible for n1any alumni to attend. Among those sending-long letters of advice were: W n1. H. McElroy, '6o; Edward Cary, '63; Frank De Puy, '77; Conde Hatnlin, '83; Shennan Bishop, '84; Herbert Daley, '92; Edwin J. Webster, '93; George B. Laughlin, 'o7; Floyd Miller, 'o6, and C. L. Mead,. 'ro. Many of these tnen are beld- ing pron1inent places on city papers and the 111- fonnation that their letters contained greatly 1n- creased the value of our meeting. It has often been said that Union needs the help of every alutnus, each doing that which he can best do to help the college. The council in calling this meeting, was carry- ing out a policy that it is hoped, will tnake this sort of support possible. The results of the n1eeting are therefore of value as showing the present state of interest atnong alurnni. Invita- tions were sent to forty-four men engaged· in this work. While this can not be all the Union n1en thus engaged, it was all this offic.e had any record of. From these alt.1n1ni fourteen answers -w-ere received in response to our first letter. In response to a second letter, thirteen n1ore were heard from. A third letter was sent out which contained. questions which we urged the alun1ni to answer, tt at we rnight profit by their advice. 'fhis letter has, up to date, received nine answers. Allowing for duplication, twenty-eight out of the forty-four have shown considerable interest, either by their presence or through letters of advice. One other very pleasing fact is to be noticed; the 1nost pron1inent of these n1en all showed a desire to help, and the tnen living in towns containing an alumni association, respond- err tnost readily to our appeal. The question of alumni support ts still in its infancy at Union. The showing of this rather srnaH class of alumni is most encouraging; and while from the standpoint of what we should like to see it reveals a certain indifference, the hopeful features are clearly evident. It is just th:s sort of indifference that the Graduate Coun- cil hopes to replace with good college spirit, and meetings like this are one of the ways by which this 1nay be done. NOTES. 1847.

Y. The prize is given in n1e1nory of the uncle of the giver who graduated fron1 Union with the class of '39· The prize will be a warded annually and will be given in the form of a silver loving cup, the value of which will be the interest on $r,ooo. The prize will be open to all freshmen, engineers as well as acaderrtic students, and should stimu- late a new interest in the study of English.
