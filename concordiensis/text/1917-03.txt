The Legend of the Freshman Cap On a ~emorable mon1ing years ago Schenectady maidens \\ere as.to.mshed to see a ~lumber of young men wearing little caps bnlhantly colored with garnet and green.. They thought, perhaps, that a circus had co111e to town- for they could not know that the lordlv sophomores of \Old I Un~on\ had or~e~ed ~very freshman t~ wear a cap-a badge \Vhich would distmgmsh him from the boys of the town \Let us set t~en:, apart by means of a funny cap,;, -....the ~ophon;-?res had smd, and when they have acquired the college tangue m manners and apparel they may lay the~e caps aside.\ s? much for fact and theory in the past. 1 c:day the freshman cap serves only as a mark of dignity. . It IS no longer necessary to \distinguish\ the freshman ari- :ficlally becaus_e he h~s not assimilated the college \atmosphere.\ . Toda:y With .a httle taste and observation he may clothe hm~self with all the careful \touches\ of the most fashionable semor. College tailoring is largely responsible for this, and Hart Schaffner & Marx are the recognized tailors of the colleg~ world. · - Their Varsity Fifty-Five suits are the last vvord in fashion. From collar to pants' cuff they are representative of the style thought in UJJ:iversity life.

They thought, perhaps, that a circus had come to town-· for they could not know that the lordly sophomores of ''Oict Union\ had ordered every freshman to wear a cap-a badge \vhich would distinguish him from the boys of the town. \Let us set them apart by means of a funny cap,\ the Sophomores had said, \and when they have acquired the colle~e 'tangue' in manners and apparel they may lay these caps aside.'' So much for fact and theory in the past. Today the freshman cap serves only as a mark of dignity. It is no longer necessary to \distinguish\ the freshman ari- ficially because he has not assimilated the college \atmosphere.\ 1'odav with a little taste and observation he may clothe himself with a11 the careful \touches\ of the most fashionable srmor. College tailoring is largely responsible for this, and Hart, Schaffner & Marx are the recognized tailors of the college world. Their Varsity Fifty-Five suits are the last word in fashion. From collar to pants~ cuff they ate representative of the style thought in university life. Be sure that J;OU have seen H., S. & M.'s new fabrics and ·I styles before you purchase your new Easter suit.
