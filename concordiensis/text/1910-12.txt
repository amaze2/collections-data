Jackson. For not only was he one of the leading scholars and tnathenl.ati- cians of his age, but. it was his personal efforts, inspired by a deep intere_st in his Alrna Mater, that converted an un--- cultivated part of the· college grounds into ~ ga~-den luxur1ant with th-e beauties df nature. Dr. Jackson w a s born of Quaker par- ents in Cornwall, Or- ·ang 2 county, N·. Y., in 180~. Here he spent his c ~1ildhood and re- 'ceived his early edttt:a- tion. After the death 'of his father, he made l.is 1-.o-me with rel'a-..,..... lives in Albany and at- 'tendecl the A 1 b :a n y }_caclcmy. In 1822 he ·and his two ·most in- tirr ate friends, ·Dr. Thon1as Hunn and until his death in r877\ thus being a member of the college faGulty for fifty-one years. In. 1829 he moved into the section o,f North College noN occupied :hy Ptrof. and Mrs. Mc-Kean, where he resided until his death. The house now occupied by Mr. a.Nd Mrs. Benedi~t was erected with the understanding that Dr. Jackson was to occupy it during- his decline, but he was taken ill quite suddenly and never moved into it. Origin of the Name, \Captain Jack.\ Even by the students of the present clay Dr. Jackson is spoken of as \Captain Jack,\ and the garden 1s called \Captain Jack's Gar- d \ H fi en. e was rst g1ven this nan1e he- ca u.se of his n1ili tary propensities. A con1- pany of cadets was or- ganized an1ong t h e students 111 1810 by J an1es A. Bayard of Delaware, and Prof. J a c k ~ o 11 s t· c c e e c1 e (l :M r. Bayard as .captain of the c8n1pany.

Immediately on his graduation he was n1ade a Fellow, a position no-vv corresponding to that of the tutor, and after a few years he becatne professor of n1athen1atics. This position ke he 1d fered frorn dyspepsia, and for .the sake of exer- cise he began to work in a garden plot near the house. By his predecesso-r, Joel N ott, Dr. El- iphalet N ott's only son, the plot was used for ra1s1ng vcegetables, but Dr. J a·ckson used this space for growing flowers and tnoved the veg- etable garden ha·ck to wh~re .the flower garden . -now ts.

6 THE CONC:O·RDIENSlS. Tradition tells us that the original Jackson who moved to this c.ountry, had a dream of a beautiful garden somewhere in America and n1oved to this country expecting to find it. He setded in Westchester, Pa., where he dis,covered what he believed to be the garden of his dreams. Whether this tradition be true or not, it is said that :Cr. Jackson had no inherent passion for :flowers, but that the more he cultivated the1R, the greater his interest became. After having beautified this spot with flowers and shrubs, Dr. N ott happened to walk by as he \THE OLD SPRING.\ was working one clay, and stopping to talk said: \You are doing a good \Vork, Doctor; go ahead and use all the ground you want.'' Accordingly his work was gradually extended until the ga.r- clen assumed its present size and general nature. In Dr. Jackson's day the fence inclosing the ga.r- clen was not in its present condition, hut ran just back of the old spring. At this time the old spring, . the appearance of which h~s been greatly changed by the concrete wall constructed a few years ago, served a practical purpose, as it was the source from which the college stu dents all obtained their drinking water. The fence was taken down and moved to its present position some time during the Civil war, in order that a stretch of green might be made around the spring. The Old N ott Eim was, of cotuse, in its pres- ent position during Dr. Jackson's time. It was through his efforts that the ground beneath the tree was cleared away, and turned into the pretty stretch of green, where the Ivy and Class. Day Exercises of ea·ch s uece~ding graduating class are held during Commencement Week. Nothing certain is known as to the or.igin of the old tree. Union students ar.e pron:e to accept the \THE OLD NOTT ELM.\ tradition that it was planted by Dr. Nott's own hand, hut it is probable that it grew up in its present position by chance rather than design. Garden Had Wide Reputation. Extensive flower gardens in that day were not nun1erous, and \Captain. Jack's'' was quite a rarity and had a wide reputation in his tin1e. It is said that Dr. N ott's grancls<Jn, Mr. Potter, once read that an Englishn1an after returning from an extended trip to America said that the garden cared for by Dr. J acksoll at Union Col- lege was the only real landscape g-arden that he had seen in the United States. Tl:!e tin1e of this visit to the garden was before 1850, and thus the

TI~E CONCORI)IENSIS. 7 garden 1nust have presented a beautiful appear- ance at an early time.

THE LIT'ERARY The Literary Board, which BOARD. ts now being organized, is an institutio11 which the Concordiensis believes will prove of inestitnable value in raising the stand- ard .of Hie literary productions of the college. For many years the students have realized the urgent need of some organization to supervise the issuti,ng of the Concordiensis and the 'Ga,r- net, and to prevent the managetnent of the re- spective pnblications from runntng them in a selfish 1na 1il:ner and not for the best interests of the coHeg-e. ·that the :1D usiness tnanager B.as reduced the nunl- Too ()tten in the past it has been the case ber of issues or the size of the paper in order that he nriight gain the greater profit. Too often has it 'Bee,JQ the case that the business manager has used doubtful tnethocls in managing the paper, arNf he has never been willing to publish an iten1ized account of his receipts and ex- penses. 'f'oo often it has been the case that the managers of the Concordiensis and the Gan1et have not given the advertisers a square deal and have J,eft ~arge printers' bills unpaid, thus lu~v­ ering the reputation of the college in the eyes of n1any vron1inent business firms in Schenec- tady and .surrounding cities. In fonning the Literary Eoarcl, the Terrace Council believes that it is in suring the pennanent rem ova 1 of these e~Tilis, and many others, also. The r,eputation of a college is greatly affected by the character of their literary productions. The Gan1et is exchanged by the fraternities of clifferen t colleges; the Concordiensis is exchang- ed with t!J,e papers of other colleges and has a large cirotdation atnong the alumni. In creating the Literary Board, the Concordiensis believes that a step has been taken which will play an importaNt part in raising the reputation of the college i1n the eyes of the business n1en of this vicinity, of the college worlcl, and of the alumni.

The tnen received an enthusiastic recep- tion wherever concerts were given, and estab- lished a fine reputation for good music, The thirty-seven n1en selected to n1ake the trip left on a special car for Binghamton Tuesday bun. The place of the cof1cert was the Eltnira Girls' CoHege, where the clubs sang before the largest crowd of the season, over five hundred people being present. The last concert was given at the Buffalo Seminary, and was followed by a lunch at the University Club. On Saturday afternoon Chief McConnell of the Buffalo Fire Departn1ent took the tnen on an exhibition trip on the fireboat \Grattan afterward showing then1 the workings of a Buffalo engine house.

It has frecqu;ent- ly been the case that the managers of both the Garnet and the Concordiensis have left Iarge printer$' bills unpaid. Advertising rates have often been ·cut when the regular price c.o-ulcl not be obtained, and it has thus made it mor:e dif- . ficult for an honest manager to get advertise- ments at the regular rates.

lOb THE ·CONCORDIENSIS. q{umni jlc\us. EDITED BY GRADUATE COUNCIL PICTURES .. It has long been the custon1 of the different colleges to send fram·ed pictures of their build- ings, -etc., to the several schools from which they wish to draw students. This has proved an ef- fective forn1 of advertising, for such visible re- nlinders seldom fail to keep the name of the institution pictured, before the boy's attention. To do this very thing is one of our chief prob- letns. vVhen once a boy has an interest suf- ficient to inquire a·bout Union, it ts .compara- tlvely easy to make hitn see our great educa- tional advantages. But with our present mea-ns it. is very difficult to get this first attention. During the past six years the college has sent out fourteen such pictures to different schools .. Our. campus is so beautiful that well selected pictures are sure to attract attention and such a picture is an excellent investn1ent. The Coun- cil would surely meet this need, as would the college, if we had the means, for a picture in every school that has sent us m·en, as well as pictures in all those we would like to see tnen from, would be a benefit of great value and to this end we are even now slowJiy working. I: uring the past week the secretary received an order from Mr. \V. P. Adams, '79, for two such pictur~s. One was for his old home, Co- hoes, and the other for the Red Hook High School. If n1ore alumni would see to the plac- ing ·.of such pictures in their local schools, tnuch .. g-ood tnight come frotn this simple and digniftecl advertising. NOTES .. I8·53· Mrs. P. H.

J To record the life of Professor William \Vells is to record the life ·of an old lT nion College professor, who, through his activities as an ed- ucator, brought fame not only to hitnself, but to the college which he represent- ed, for so tnany years. Professor W e 11 s was born 111 New York City in the year 1820. His boyhood and youth were pass- ed in the city of Phil- adelphia, where he acquired his acadern- lc education and 111ade good progress toward that rnastery of foreign tongues which tnade hin1 fa- mous in later years. W h e n twenty - six years old, he made his first visit to Eu- rope, gotng to Vi- enna as an unofficial attache of the Amer- Interested 1n Revolutions. These wer•e the days when the revolutions tn Europe were agitating the world,-when Louis Philippe was driven from the throne of France, when the Crown Prince of Pntssia, afterwards Willian1 L, Emperor of Gern1a:ny, was cotn- pelled by popular hatred to flee from his conn- try, when Hungary was in open r·evolt against At1.stria, and when the Chartist agitation threat- ened revolution even in England. Profes- sor V\r ells was deeply interested in the great events that were tak- ing place, and the story of his personal participation 111 the history of the clay is an interesting one. After an exciting ex- penence in the Der- 11n riots, he went as s e c r e tar y to the An1erican en1bassy tn the Gern1an Parlia- t11en t at Frankfort- on-t11e-Main. He also served as correspond- ent on the X ew York Herald, heing the first regular foreign cor- respondent on any American ne\vspaper.

A few y,ears later his duties as professor were increase<!l by the ad- dition of a lectureship on current history. In the interest of this work, he n1acle an extensive study not only of the conditions in all parts of the United States, Alaska, Mexico, and Central America, but visited nearly eve,ry country of Europe, Asia Minor, Egypt and other parts of Africa. During his life he n1ade four visits to the 0'ld World and rarely found a place where he could not speak the native language. The results of his observations on these tours were en1bodied in a course of lectures ·which he de- livered. annually to the senior class and the gen- eral public. Other Educational Activities. His activities as an educator were by no means confined to his classroon1 work, for by voice and pen he was for a long titne known. throughout the country as one of the foren1ost tnen of cul- ture. He lectured in all of the large cities of the United States fron1 Boston to San Fran- cisco, and besides being at different tin1es the foreign correspondent for tnany leading New York papers, he was a frequent contributor to the Independent, Scribner's Monthly, and other leading periodicals. He was always interested in religious work and was for n1any years super- intendent of the Sunday School in the State Street Methodist Church. For over twenty years he was, also, in charge of the foreign de- partnlent of the Methodist Review. Called \Uncle Billy.\ He was always of a kind, genial disposition and showed such an interest in the welfare of the students that he early acquired the title of \Uncle Billy,\ and by the Union alumni and all who knew him he is still remen1 berecl by that natne. The following anecdote well illustrates his disposition: While professor here he al- ways lived in the section of North College, now occupied by Professor Bennett. One evening the students in the roon1 above his study be- can1e engaged in a wrestling 1natch and tnade so much noise that they disturbed the profes- sor's studies. Suddenly a sharp rap was heard on the door of the room where the disturbance was going on. The students opened it, and on seeing \Uncle Billy\ thought that they were to he s,everely reprimanded. The old professor, however, with a twinkle in his eye, merely said, \I would be glad to have you come and see me, boys, but I would prefer to have you come dowN the stairs instead of through the ceiling.\ Retired in 1902. Tn 1902 he retired fron1 active work, and re- rnained at the college a.s professor emeritus. At the ah1n1ni banquet that year he was presented by the students with a silver loving cup con- taining the inscription: \To Uncle Billy; fron1 Son1e of the Boys.\ Fron1 that tin1e until his death on December 12, 1907, he retnained quietly at hotne. Probably many of the students in the present senior class can remen1ber seeing hin1 walking up and down the path in front of North College, or taking short strolls about the can1pus. Professor Wells lived a long, useful, and hon- ored life, and was loved and respected not only by the faculty, students, and alum11i of Union, but far n1ore widely, ·for his syt'Jl.ifathy, and in- terests had brought him into connection with ntany persons and n1any institutions, and l1e undertook no work or occupation where he did not attain the affection and esteen1 of those with whon1 he was associated. ------------- SOPHOMORE BASKETBALL TEAM DEFEATS SARATOGA HIGH SCHOOL Under the leadership of Davis as captain and Dewey as manager, the Sophomore basketball team has begun a most auspicious year. The first game was played last Saturday with the Saratoga High School, and ended with a vic- tory of 25 to r 2 for the Sophomore tea1n. Stern, Davis, Lent, Dewey and Bran1an were the players and the form shown at this gatne giv:es prom.ise of a successful season. The schedule for the rest of the season has ' not, as yet, been fully decided upon, but a three- day trip during the Christmas vacation is prob- able. The nearby high schools, including Al- bany and Schenectady, will also be given games artd the freshmen, if they organize a team. So far, I9I4 has done nothing to organize one, but they expect to have one out for practice in the near future. I)

t, I) TI-IE C'ONCORI)IENSIS. 7 BASKETBALL TEAM FAST ROUNDING INTO SHAPE With an average of twenty men out for pra·c- tice every night, basketball prospects are the brightest that Union has ·ever seen. Coach Kuolt is sending the men through stiff practice every night and getting the1n in the very best of condition for the coming season. New 1na te-- rial has strengthened the team and there are many 1nen back from the last year's five. Micks will be back at center. For the forwards, Cow- ard, Hequembourg and McKinstry from the Phannacy School are doing fine work and are gaging the baskets. The guards are well repre- sented by Brum1n, Fairbairn and Noble, '14. With this aggregation Union has little to fear fron1. lack of good material. Micks is a good defensive player and the forwards are all very aggressive. Passwork and basket shooting, which have received special attention fro1n the coach, are excellent. Coach Kuolt 1s instilling in the tnen the idea that every gan1e this season means a victory, and to aid the n1en in their plays, a special study of the rules is being 1nade. The men are drilled in the new clause that gives the out-of-bounds ball to the first n1an that touches it. Strict train- ing is being adhered to and the men are all now in good condition. Manager Atkin has not yet comp1eted the schedule sufficiently for publication, but as soon as it has received the sanction of the Athletic Board it ,vill be published. The first game will be with the Army at West Point on January 7· The ho1ne games this year will be held in the Arn1ory in the afternoon instead of the evening. PHI GAMMA DELTA BANQUET. CORNELL AND TRI-LEAGUE DEBATE QUESTIONS CHOSEN Allison-Foote Debate Held on Cornell Subject. The questions have now been chosen for both the Cornell debate and the tri-league with Col- gate and Hamilton. The subJect submitted by CorneU for the debate in Schenectady on Jan- nary 20 is: ''Resolved, That the ownership of the for.est and mineral lands, now belonging to the United States in the several states, should be retained by the federal govern1nent.\ At the meeting on Monday, the Debating Council will carefully consider the question, and decide which side it would be best for the Union team to defend. The Allison-Foote Debate. The Allison-Foote clehate, between the Phil- on1athean and Adelphic Societies, will be held on the same subject, probably on January 9· Both societies are no:vv working on the ques- tion, and the Philomatheans have already chosen as the n1en1bers of their team, Gordon, W. D. (avert, and Potter, with A .. B. Mann as alter- nate. The Adelphics will choose their team ea-rly next week. It is probable that the Cornell team will be picked from those who make the best showing in the Allison-Foote. Tri-League Subject. The subject which 1- as been finally chosen for the triangular debate between Union, Col- gate, and Hatnilton, is \For and against the in- itiative and ref erendun1 for New York State.\ This debate will be held on Friday evening, Feb- ruary 24. One Union tean1 will remain in Schen- ectady to defend the negative against Colgate, and the other will uphold the affirmative against Han1ilton at Clinton. The n1.embers of the Phi Ga1nma Delta frater- nity fron1. Schenectady and surrounding cities held their annual banquet on Thursday night in A lba11y at the Hotel Hatnpton. THE MUSICAL CLUBS. Owing to the fact that the trips to A1nster- da1n and Johnstown have been postponed, there will be no n1ore concerts this term. At present the clubs are working to get ready for the trip to Hudson. The first concert here will be on January 7, and there will also be one during W ooclard and Wend represented the active Union chapter. Dr. Steinmetz was present as a tnember of the lTnion chapter and gave an in forn1al address. Dr. Hoff1nan was also present. Junior Week.

A UNIVERSITY For many years passed the PAPER. Concordiensis has heen call- ed a paper \published by the students of Union University,\ although: none of the Albany de- pa.rtnlents have been represented on the board of editors. A movernent is now on foot to tnake the Concordy a truly University paper. Several Albany students are showing an active interest in the idea, a.nd it is probable that after the holidays one page or a certain portion of the paper each week will be devoted to news from our other departments. Not only should this h11prove the Concordiensis and n1ake it more inter·esting, but it showld prove a valuable factor in k·eeping the college proper in closer touch ·with the Albany students. THE DRAMATIC The Concordiensis believes CLUB. tbat a successful I:ramatic Club has at last been organized at l.T nion. For several years in the ]_)ast the Dran1atic Club has been considered a standing joke, but the pros- pects are now bright for a club which will not only live down its past reputation, but will put dramatics on a firn1 basis for years to con1e. A Dra1natic Club is an organization which can advertise the college in a very efficient 1nanner, and should therefore be heartly supported by the whole student body. A trip such as the club in- tends to take during the Christn1as vacation will do far n1ore to advertise our institution than any other organization could possibly do in the san1e time, as plays will be given in seven cities, wbich are to be thoroughly posted for the play in ad- vance. This vacation is an t11H1SFally good time for the staging of the play and large houses are expected in all of the cities where ''\Vhat Hap- pened· to Jones'' is presented. SCHERMERHORN RESIGNS FROIVI CONCORD~IENSIS BOARD It is with deep r·egret that the editor an- nounces that Henry Schennerhorn, '12, has re- signed his position as associate editor of the Concordiensis. He will be greatly 1nissed by the board as he is a capable literary 1nan and thoroughly understands the work of the Con- cordiensis. '; ; . ) i' ; ) {

STEINMETZ DELIVERS LECTURE ON THE CORONA Dr. Steinmetz delivered a lecture on T:ttesday night to about five hundred members of the Schenectady Section of the American In~titute of Electrical Engineers, in Red Menrs Hall, on the high voltage phenomenon known as corona, or the blue luminous glow which surrounds the conductors of electric power transtnission sys- tems, operated at the higher potentials. He clearly demonstrated. that the f onnation of corona occurs at a defi.nite critical voltage for fixed conditions as to size and spacing of conductors, and that an appreciable power loss results, which increases with great rapidity he- yond this critical point.

On Tuesday afternoon a meeting of the Ex- ecutive Con11nittee was held in the office of the secretary in Washburn Hall. The election of a n·ew Treasurer, apportiotunent of the tern1s of office an1ong the members at large, and cer- tain minor changes in the comn1ittees forn1ed the chief business of the n1eeting. Dr. Willian1 L. Wilson, '95, was elected treas- urer to succeed Mr. Joseph H. Clements, Jr. This position while the rnos t difficult 1n the Council, is a vital one and the extent of the work done by the different committees depends largely upon the efforts of this officer. Dr. VVilson has proved a tnost successful class secretary and by dint of hard and continued •. < work got a record breaking attendance at his · class reunion last June. With such effort on the J)ar·t of half the n1em bers of the Council, it would 1;rove a greater source of good to the college than itsoest friends have ever expected. . . The metnhers-at-large w·ere arranged 111 the following order: Tenn expiring Septen1her, H)IO- J ohn Ash, James Bothwell, John K. Paige. Term. expiring September, 191 I- S. T.

The idea of a Graduate Council is new at Un- ion and it is taking time to get a foothold. The Co_uncil offers the advantage of giving the alun1ni an efficient means of helping in all lines where alurpni aid is necessary, and will serve the other great function of keeping the college in real touch with the graduates. This first year is· proving a hard one, but as the purpose uf the C:onncil becomes better known and hs metnbers better organized the great value of this new as- set on the side of progress will be felt.

The annual fall edition of the Union CoUege huiletin has app,eared and is now being dis- tributed. -As usual, there are several new things to attract attention, the' n1ost pron1inen t, per- haps, being an increase -of tuition w·hich affects only those classes that are to enter in the future. This increase, 111 the engineering courses, amounts to ten dollars per term. In the classical and science courses the tuition is now thi~rty dollars per tern1, an in crease of five dollars. The catalog this year appears in a neat brown cover and is rather thicker than those pub- lished before, this edition containing 2ro pages. It contains, as the previous catalogs have done, the records of the college for the past year, the list of students and many other things. Accord- ing to this book, the students in Union College number 338, divided as follows: Candidates for masters degrees. and graduate students, r8; sen- iors, 56; juniors·, 77; sophotnores, 81; freshmen, 107. In the Albany departments are 452 more students, bringing the grand tota'l up to 790. 206 are in the Medical College, 145 are attending the Law School, and 10.3 are registered at the College of Pharn1acy. Two of these are counted twice, tnaking the total 452. Taken as a whole the catalog is one of the best that has yet appeared and tnay justiy be called a work of art. Dr. Frank Coe Ban1.es did tnost of the work connected with the publishing of the book, and to hitn is due much of the credit for its success. THE SOPHOMORE SOIREE. The first Sophon1ore Soiree of the year wa~ held at the Schenectady Boat Club on Thursday evening. The dance was well attencled, especially by the students of the Albany departlnents.

DECEASED. It was with deep sorrow that the clas:; of 1912 lean1ed of the death of one of its former mem- bers, Arthur Schuyler, at his home in Patterson- ville. Mr.· Schuyler had been obliged to give up his course in college at the close of the fall tern1 last year owing to poor health .. The president of the Junior class appointed a committee to send flo-vvers and a cotnmittee to draw up resolutions expressing the sorrow of Schuyler's classmates, a copy of the resolutions to be sent to the family of the deceased.
