Union College, thanks to an t'K- cellent endowment prog-ram, is among the six most adequately en- dowec colleges in America, and cons<>quently has been able to main- tain a low tuition f<>e while in- creasing the salaries of the faculty, improving educational facilities, and, even ma.naging to improvt' the college g.roun ds. Last year· t hP col- lege was able to spend an average of $265 toward the cost of educa- tion of every one of its more than 1500 full-time students.

Local 85's statement was made in rejection of a four-point offer by the college which would have pro- \'ided: 1. That all-student orchestras be allowed to play on the campus without AFM interference, 2. That such orchestras be de- nied protection of the college should they accept off-campus en- gagements. 3.

It has been found that the majority of college students have a real concern over religious values, but feel critical and un- certain of them.

This step was taken in. order to fully protect the pro- fessional musicians. This decision culminat- ed a two-month dispute between the college authorities and the local representatives of the l\Iusicians Union. In Decembet·, the new- ly organized Union College dance band was contracted to play at a dance after the Union- Vermont Basketball game; Local 85 was asked to allow the band to play. Permission for that one occasion was granted pending further conference with college authorities which finally led to the present declamtion. This coming Tuesday evening the Student Council will discuss the decision and vote upon it; we feel that they and the student body must fully realize the many ramifica- tions that confront them despite the stand they may take. At first glance, it may seem that the union is taking a rather rigid posi- tion, and that it is extremely unfair to col- lege students who are attempting to eam a little side money for their education. The union, however, offered these men the oppor- tunity of becoming members of the American Federation of l\Iusicians; the college authori- ties were willing to take the proceeds of the first dance to pay the initiation fee and dues for the band members until they could earn enough to repay this sum. But the leader, speaking for the men of the band, stated that they could find g1·eater profit during the summer months as non-union players. It is believed by some sources that the precedent established by the union may possibly lead to a greater encmachment upon the freedom of the college; if the policy of the union is adhered to, other organizations in the future may compel students working at Hale House, and the men utilizing the services of the Student Employment Bm·eau to become union members ... or else. But by the same token, if the union were to allow a college dance band exception to their national rul- ing, it would create a precedent for other private institutions on the outside to demand special dispensations. Can an organization such as a local union allow an educational in- stitution to be free from the authority of labor regulations merely by virtue of their ivy walls? From the Presideat PRESIDENT'S OFFICE UNfON COLLEGE February 4, 1948 To Students Living Off Campus: Last autumn, when college opened, the gov- ernment dormitories in the pasture were not completed; therefore it was necessary for the college to ask you to secure rooms in town. VIe appreciated your doing so, and were thankful that your landlord opened up a place to you. Now, however, the dormitories are finished, and we can accommodate you on the campus. The housing authority insists that, in view of the continuing severe shortage of rooms in Schenec- tady, we must fill these dormitories. The col~ege catalog, page 85, states \All students are reqmred to live in college dmmitories unless they are living at home, or unless they are exempted. by the Dean's Office.\ This exemption was granted to you for the first semester, but cannot be con- tinued after March 1, 1948. Therefore, please make your plans to move into these dormitories not later than the end of Feb1·uary. We do not want this to work any hardship on the people with whom you are now rooming, and We shall be happy to help them secure a satisfactory roomer, probably a G.E. \test\ worker, in your place. Rental rates for the semester will be adjusted according to the date when you move in. Please s~e Mr. ~c­ Illwaine or Miss Fleming in the Busmess Off1ce I shall personally appreciate your cooperation. about a room assignment. To the Editor Cordially, Carter Davidson, P1:esident. Dear Sir: , Union College is bounded by Umon Street, Union Avenue, Lenox Roa~, Nott Street, and Seward Place; the honzon of the CONCORDIENSIS apparently ext~n~s no further. The policy of the paper-If It has one-revolves around petty problems which are of little note after the week or month is through. If such headlines as \Factory Boss Course Is Added\ or \N ewma,n Clubbers Told Reds A1·e Bad\ or \Engmee Told Facts of Life By Personnel Man carry implications of policy, n;aders would ap- preciate a fuller explanatiOn of s~me. Fac- tual reporting has Its place,, but It has the vitality of ancient manuscnpt. , The CONCORDY seems to come to hfe only when prodded by the appearanc.e of some piddling problem such as the failure of the College to remove ice from the cam- pus walks. Aroused briefly by the argu- ment surrounding· the advent of A VC, the CONCORDY stirred itself, received a letter in reply-and collapsed again in_to ~he ~ull recitation of plans for ticket. d1stnbub~n, etc. Such information could Just as easily be disseminated by the posting of mimeo- o'I'aphed sheets on bulletin boards. \\ World history is -being made. Our des- tinies are being- shaped by daily crisis. Mankind is reacting in violent and diverse ways. Does Union College have a policy in these matters'! Does the CONCORDI- ENSIS have a policy? Or will we continue to read the dreary recital of sports events and musical concerts a week old? The paper should assume the character of constructive criticism, not only on a local basis, but in national and internation- al fields as well. The writers of this letter know the edi- tol'S to be thinking and perceptive men, but the casual reader would never deduce this fact from the paper itself. Let us therefore offer these suggestions: 1) Give the readers of the CONCOR- DIENSIS a definite statement of policy. 2) Expand the area in which the CON- CORDIENSIS takes interest. 3) Reduce factual repol'ting to the mini- mum necessity. 4) Combine factual reporting with cri- tical comment. 5) Include feature articles and regular columns of a controversial nature; the author's point of view should provoke argument. Above all, take the potentiality of a living journalistic organ-and such the CONCORDIENSIS is-and bring it to life. Let it stimulate thought and precipitate argument. Sincerely, Vincent C. DeBaun '47 Kenneth N. Me Iver '47 John R. Tether '49 And since we are not discussing· the merits of union versus non-union, we believe that Local 85 was justified in declining the com- promise offer made by the college, even though such a decision will prevent a student group from participating in college activities. The fact that such a band in open competi- tion with men earning their livelihood would endanger the professional musician if such a policy were to become a widespread prac- tice by all private organizations and institu- tions in this area. The Editors of the CONCORDIENSIS would liltc to hear something from the rest of :the student body on the questions raised above. If more letters are forthcoming, CONCORDIENSIS will print its views on the inclusion of other than campus news in the near future.

No matter how able an editor may be, his horizons are definjte- ly fixed by the quantity and quality of the material FOR STUDENTS PLANNING TO ATT·END SUMMER SCHOOL, 1948 Tn order te plan fer the Summer Term, it is necessary that all stu- dents expecting to attend indicate now the subjects that they would Jiko.l to take this summer.

This holds true everywhere, As you may have suspected, the above glittering generalities apply specifically to the IDOL. I feel that the magazine has been fortunate in having vigorous, forthright leadership since its revival, par- ticularly in the person of Messrs. Brooks and Enzer. But this has not been enough. An editor and his staff cannot be expected, in fact they should not be allowed, to write a whole issue. A literary magazine such as the IDOL should be a sounding board for opinions and artistic emotions of the entire college. That is its function and its value. It is true that there is an intellectual dead calm on campus. But this is not significant. To para- phrase Thoreau, the mass of men lead lives of quiet apathy. What is tragic is that those who are not apathetic, who have things to say and know how to say them, are not contributing. I am not sure I know the exac~ reasons for this, One may be the burden of class work they are laboring under; an- other may be a natural reluctance to expose their works to the baleful eye of editors. If the first, may I suggest that there are sometimes better things for men to do than to memorize the sources of Shakespeare's ~lays; if the second, may I assure the wou~d-be c?ntnbutor that baleful eyes are strictly fo~b1dden m _the IDOL office, that in fact the editors. s_ometimes have to be forcibly restrained from .g:rhsh and unseemly giggles at the sight of an un~ohc1ted ms. _The fact is that we want your articles, yo~r s.tor1es, your poems, your cartoons, your what-ha~e-~ou s, If you have something which you are J?artlcularly proud of but which you feel couldn't J?OSSibly be printed, send it in, That is probably Just what we are looking for.

It Is a Pleasure To Work With UNION COLLEGE • The Student Council is presented with a difficult problem. It is faced with two al- ternatives; it can accept the union's policy or it can decide to reject the proposal thereby benefiting fourteen Union College students. But if the Council decides to flaunt the union ruling, it must be aware of the future retri- butions that the student body may possibly incur. In any future event where a student group decides to hire a union band for a dance, the local union ~~ould, if they so desire, prevent such a band i'Fom playing. We do not feel that the advar tages to the fourteen men in the band can t 1tw:eigh tli.e possible disadvantages to fifteer hundl'ed.

The way they satd lt meant very clearly that if there was any special field that interested me, they'd try to see that I got a crack at it.\ Con had an answer ready. He had heard a lot about Nela Park, Genetal Electric's \University of Light\ in Cleveland, Ohio. ''I'd like to go toNela Park,\ he said. It was a big leap for him. He was asking for an assign1nent in a field in which he had had no ptevious training-not at Union College where he had gotten his degree in 1941, not on \Test\ with General Electric. In the Army he had worked in electronics. Nela Park would be a totally new experience . . But Personnel said Okay. In the two years smce then, Con Bechard has contdbuted to bettel' production machinery for making the n~w . ctrculat fluorescent lamps known as Ctrcl1nes, and has helped improve their qual- ity and life.

Those who were given promotions were Mr. Cecil W. Byers, pro- moted from lecturer to assistant professor of physics; Mr. Henry J. Swanker promoted from instructor to assistant professor of chemistry; and Mr. }{arold C. O'Neil promoted from instructor to assistant profes- sor of library science. Sabbaticals Leave of absence was granted to Dr. William W. Bennett, professor and chairman of the department of economics; Dr. Phillip L. Stanley, professor of philosophy; Dr. Orin .J. Farrell, associate professor of mathematics; Dr. Alan C. Scott, professor of biology; and Mr. Buren C. Robbins, assistant professor of speech, radio and theatre. The leaves of absence thus granted are for one or two semesters, to be taken during the college year 1948- 1949. New Chairs Dr. Benjamin P. Whitaker, pro- fessor of economics and a member of the faculty since 1939, was named Armstrong Professor of Eco- nomics. Dr. Joseph D. Doty, professor and chairman of the department of his- tory, was named Bigelow Professor of History. Dr. Doty has been with the faculty since 1928. John Bigelow, a graduate of Union class of 1935, was one of tile most outstanding statesmen of his The John Bigelow fund was cre- ated by the \John Bigelow Memor- ial Committee\ in his honor, and granted to Union College in 1916. The income feom this fund, which now totals $50,500, is devoted to the \John Bigelow Memorial Profes- sorship in History and Political Science\. Economics Gift The Armstrong fund is a gift of the late Thomas Armstrong who died in 1895. A friend of Union for many years it was his wish that education and training in the field of economics be perpetuated and ensured at Union College. The income from this fund is devoted to the maintenance of a professor- ship in economics and the granting of scholarships to residents of Clinton County. There seems to be some confu- sion on campus as to the sig- nificance of these various endowed chairs. Some explanation is, there- fore, in order. Being named to an endowed chair lends prestige and honor to the professor so named. The purpose of the endowment is to ensure the maintenance of a professorship in a particular field of study, It was, for example, Thomas Armstrong's wish that (Continued on Page 6)

The recent band dispute illustrates another instance of poor dissemination of information on one hand and too rash action on the other. As Art Agnello, band leader, pointed out during various explanatory sessions held during the :past week, when the Student Council proposed that the band become an activity he assumed that this proposal would be relayed to the students. Instead, public opinion was \Unenlightened and the band was generally conside1·ed an entirely mercenary outfit. This indicates poor coordination of action between council and various other representative gTOups on campus. No one actually knows what the next man is doing. Consider also the fact that when the ques- tion of the band and its presence on campus with regard to the union came up, the stu- dent investigator did not wisely decide to consult the men such as Agnello who might have inside information on the union's in- formal policy. Instead, as oft times hap- pens, the student requested the advice of l\Ir. Ketz, who for all his ability to handle a multi- tude of facts, cannot be the oracle of all and Letters to On Basketball Dear Sir; At its last meeting the Block 'U' Society discussed the basketball article which appeared in the Feb- ruary 6th issue of the Concordiensis. We, lettermen of all sports at Union College, feel that the article was not only in poor taste but tha.t it was also unfair to the coach and the ·team mem- bers who are devoting much of their time to efforts to give Union a winning basketball team. If the team is not all that the Concordiensis would like it to be, it is certainly not due to any lack of effort or desire to field a winning team on the part of the coa<'h or the team. The Block 'U' Society feels that criticisms of this sort belong on the Editorial page and not in the news columns, which are supposedly devoted to re- porting facts and not opinions. \Ve also feel that any article uf this sort should bear the writer's name and not bestow upon him the privilege of hiding behind a cloak of anonymity. One of the ·ights we have in this country is the right to know our accusers. Does the Concurdiensis feel that it has the power to circumvent this basic freedom? We also feel that if the Concordiensis is looking for something worthwhile to do, it might better devote its attention to finding a means for promoting student support of athletic teams.

In talking over the recent basketball article with men interested in athletics, one point became primary: why does the college which shys away in horror at any suggestion of subsidization in its admissions policy, con- tinue to schedule \scholarship\ teams such as the four to which the basketball team can attribute its recent losing streak. Hockey is similar. Also, why bother play- ing RPI any longer; in size they are out of our class. realize that large quantities of good material are nowhere to be seen. It is evident that, unless sorrie great change occurs, the money incentive must be offered if we are to have publications at all. Pay Is Negligible This may seem to be a frankly mercenaq attitude, but realize this: averaging the hours spent at this ti~e with the largest cut given, we find a wage of fifteen cents per hour, and it may be added that this figure is not based upon the two or three years ap- prenticeship, without pay, without glory. Add to this the necessity for finding extra funds, which all, especially married men must face, and the situation becomes alm.ost impossible. Talk to those men, those few men, who work on, rather than ta:Ik about publication.s and you will find an esprit de corps, an interest in the school plus a love of writing which precludes a crass desire for mere money. They could be doing much better, as some are. \Sometime\ Isn't \Now\ Whether a \no cut\ system is employed in the future must depend upon the judgment of the students in their pa1ticuiar situation Our efforts are now in the direction of set ting up the old board system by which a steady stream of replacements will be avail able. When this is accomplished, enough workers may be ,in competition for this rath er dubious fame to enable some future tax committee to force this measure down their throats. But ...... there a·re only so many work ers available today, their time is worth much to them, as are their college studies, notwith- standing their desire to serve; consensus of opinion is that by: dropping the \cut\, stu~ dents are in l'eality making a choice between publications and no publications. But on further consideration of the obvious lack of any faint spark of interest in the majority of the students, it may well be their wish to drop publications entirely. After all they do cost much, in many ways, to all concerned. The college does not seem to realize that they cannot have their cake and eat it too. Either loosen the standards and give the athletes a break, or, play in our own league and rely on our intellectual giants to keep the college's reputation going. Angello Clarifies Band's Position in Disput€1 the Editor Taking the issue of February 6, 1948, and a ruler, there is: 220 Inches printed material 140 inches ndvertising 360 inches total space The printed material may easily be divided into two categories. a) 201 of the 220 inches are articles concerned solely with campus news, so old as to be of interest to few, even on the campus. bl The remaining 19 inches are two articles, themselves concerned with Union, but of general interest: the first, a review of Mr. William C. Yates' address on Schenectady's Sesquicentennial; the second, a letter from Troy on the new FM station in- stalled by the Veterans' Vocational School. The subject matter printed is so weak as to hardly be considered news, but is captioned with sensational headlines. \ Rears Its Ugly Head\ \Commit Matrimony\ Is it be- cause the editors feel that every paper needs a banner, or is it because the material is old and weak that this step is necessary? Aside from our depreciatory attack, we have what we believe to be constructive ;;~ugge:stions. As to news, print such articles as are con- sidered to be of national interest, with opinions of faculty members, students, and competent authorities. News of this nature surely would appeal to residents of the Schenectady area. AHunhi in particular wouid welcome an im- provement in this direction. An energetic publication appealing to a more general public would undoubtedly raise the esteem of Union College. The people want an Intelligent editor- ial discussion of pertinent national issues not laborious apologies fo rthe last hockey game. We are 100% behind school athletics, but can- not see the neces:o.ity of devoting one fourth of the college paper to this information which the interested reader gainst firsthand f~om the local sports page. Opinions of students on national and world issues, articles such as those written by the exchange students, and an occasional cartoon by _an artist in the crowd, would do much to enliven and impart reader appeal to \The Concordiensis\. The purpose of an institution of learning is to inspire and stimulate thought. Its newspaper sh?uld be a.n important vehicle of expression. With the help of the editorial staff, and the Interested co-operation of the student body our paper could fulfill its obligation to the cdnege and at the same time be profitable to the resi- dents of this area. Sincerely yours, Clarence F. Giles 1950 Thomas F. Stratton 1949 This is not a note of rebuttal, but merely an article for clarifying a subject which has attained impossible heights and uncalled for distortions. A few months ago I took over a musical aggrega- tion in its embryonic stage in hopes that with a lot of perseverance on our part and an equal , amount of support from the proper quarters on campus we could develop a Union College Dance Band. Last week and week-end saw an unex- pected culmination-Local 85's refusal of Mr. . Ketz's four-point plan; the new.s article and edi- torial in last week's Concordiensis, and my letter of rebuttal in answer to the Concordy editorial which I posted on campus Saturday morning. ' As I explained during the WRUC discussion Monday night !which involved Mr. Ketz, Lot H. Cooke, Jr. and myself) the point that displeased me most about the above mentioned editorial was its failure to make clear the issues involved. I was especially peeved with the fact that through- out the editorial one gathered that since nancial remuneration was so often referred to, we of the dar.J.Ce band had organized for that supreme reason. Th1.s was a.z; unjust conclusion, though one easily arnved at If one was not acquainted with each facet of the issue. At this point it would be logical for someone to say that the campus was never properly noti ed of what developed-to which I must answer--the Student Council knew as much as I,. did of every phase of development, including my statement of policy\! The Student Council is our representative body and as such it should be recogmzed as a sounding board and information bureau for campus issues. Another point which I felt was :misconstrued was that Which implied that the only reason we <the Dance Band) refused to join the AFM. was that we---\could find greater profit during the summer months as non-union players.\ This was an incomplete statement. Though the point men- tioned was instrumental in the making of our decision it was not mentioned that we also balked at having to commit ourselves to the binding rules and by-laws of the AFM, especially since none of us contemplate entering music profession- ally-unless driven to it! The last point which was cause for friction was that which referred to the problem's decision as one which would benefit either fourteen Union College students or fifteen hundred Union College ~tudents. Though this was theoretically the case m the face of the proportions the issue had ac- quired, I wanted to make sure the comparison of benefi~s was understood, If the controversy had been JUstly dealt with, the fifteen hundred would have benefited. All the points I've mentioned have been cleared up in conversation with the editor of the Concor- diensis and during the WRUC discussion. As to what will happen in dealing with the Local 85 refusal-this ls not for me to decide. At the Stu- dent _Council m~eting this past Tuesday I admitted wantmg to reJect the union's proposal, since I believe they are not in a position to practice a \black!isting\ of the campus. By the same token I admit.ted not wishing to be held responsible for developmg cons~quences. if such a policy were pur- sued by the umon. With this as a final note I repeat, the decision does not rest with me.

Each must be signed by a pen name, and the true name of the writer should not be revealed on the manuscript but placed in a sealed envelope accompanying the essay with the pen name of the author on the outside. The award, founded in 1911 by the late Wessel Ten Broeck Van Orden, of the class of 1839, is awarded annually to a member of the freshman class for excellence in English composition. It was won last year, from a stiff field of competition, by Phillip H. W. Geisler. The basis of the award is the class work in rhetoric and composition, and a special essay. The essays are based upon certain works of literature, the subject offered this year being: The Fictional Inter- pretation of World War II by American Writers, or The Reportorial Interpretation of World War II by American Authors. The books available in the library for this subject are listed in the files under the authors concerned .and hence no list is necessary for this an- nouncement. Among the eligible authors are such as Ernie Pyle, John Steinbeck, William White, Bill Mauldin, William Shirer, Leland Stowe, :Cecil Brown, John Hersey and John P. Marquand. The essay may be limited to two or three significant works or it may be a survey of a large number. A list of the books read should be attached to the paper.

Philomatheans List Boiler Plant to Be Debates to Be Held '!Jnlarged Bettered During This Term In Near' Future The t:nion College Philomathean Society is getting off to a line start this term with live debates sched- uled so far with some of the East's toughest teams. Debate d·irector, D '-' n a 1 d Fit g~nbaum announced that the group, composed of eight men, is due to debate the following teams: Albany State in Albany on Feb. 20, Elmira. sometime in early March, here, St. Lawrence on March 8, he1·e, Russell Sage on April 19 at Troy, and Hobart on April 2.11, here. There will be more deba.tes scheduled for the later months of the term, with possible return engagements with some schools. DebatPs Scheduled In addition to these debates the society will hold regular meetin?S every Monday night at 7 p.m. in the English reading room of Bailey Hall. At these meetings debates and discussions are he Id between the members of the organization. Anyone who is interestrd in at- tending and participating in these discussions is welcome. The topic for next Monday is \Federal World Government\. The Philomatheans will end the sPason b~· pnxtieipnting in a debate conferen<'e in Alb:my. They at- tended the conference last year when about 15 schools were· repre- sented This vear the conference is expected to· be ev!'n larger. It will take place in the mRembly chambers of the Capitol building. Construction on the new heating plant for Union College will begin as soon as steam is no longer re- quired. Mr. Anthony Hoadley, col· ]Qge comptroller has announced. Designed to meet the needs of Union now and in the future, the new plant will include several un- usual features. To be located in the present building the heating plant will still use coal but it wiil be gravity fed to the furnaces from a forty foot high coal bunker to be erected on the south side of the plant. A specially deeigned elevator will load coal into the bunker. Mechanical stokers will be in- stalled in addition to two new boilers which will allow the plant to deliver about 30,000 pounds of steam per hour to meet the needs of the expanding college. During the present cold weather the old system has been able to supply 18,000 pounds of steam per hour. One of the features of the new installation will be a dust collector which will by mechanical means remove fly ash and other relatively large particles that are carried out through the chimney draft. The collector apparatus, to be located in the present smoke stack, will not remove smolte, however. Washbul\ll Hall (Continued from Page 3) of the midnight oil on Thursday until about three A. M., that is, or much later. It seems that every- thing has to be done on Thursday night, proofreading, head-writing, cutting stories to fit the space, etc. But the paper isn't done even then. The paper is actually finished at the Gazette Press, where it is printed. On Friday mornings, the editor-in-chief and the managing editor and anybody else that has any energy left, go down to super- vise the printing. Although as much has been done as possible, there probably is more head writ- ing and cutting at the Gazette office than there is in the Concordi- ensis office. But when the paper is finally put to bed, the whole staff heaves a sigh, and then looks forward to another week of con- fusion until the next issue is due. Students interested in the paper are put on writing stories, and later, proofreading (the heart of a paper) and headwriting. WRUO Works Too!

A water softener set-up will also be employed to treat the water used in the boilers. A pneumatic ash removal system will be in- stalled and a large steel ash recep- ticle will be built. For the benefit of engineering students quite a few additional in- struments and control mechanisms are to be installed. The design of the n~w system was made by a New York firm, Burns and Roe Consulting Engineers. Last but not least, is the pride of Washburn Hall, the sound- proofed studioe of WRUC. The station is run entirely by students under the supervision of a faculty advisor. The staff of 71 students maintains a minimum of 46 hours on the air per week. The staff ie divided into two groups, 1/3 tech- nical and control men and 2/3 working on the programs. The operation of the station requires a large number of men, usually about . five men for a program originating in the studio, with the number in- creasing if a special program is produced or if a program is being broadcast from outside the studio.

Fretheim, a Junior pre-med student, won easily, show- ing remarkable form as well as good distance. His easy style and perfect control brought many favorable comments from the judges. What is even more inter- esting is that he has had no jump- ing practice this year, but in his favor was the fact that he has been jumping in his native Norway since he wa.s 5 years old.

Harvey last Wednesday evening at the home of Mr. and Mrs. Wilford Ketz. The guest speaker was Mrs. Wilma D. Scott of the Schenectady school system who spoke on marri- age problems. Begun last year in December the proposal of cooperative buying of non-perishable goods and other items met with immediate response on the part of students among which the American Veterans Com- mittee campus chapter took the lead and offered to aid the club in research on the matter and ap- pointed a committee under the chairmanship of Bruce Wallace to investigate further possibilities. Mr. Ketz, Student Activities Co- ordinator, al~o offered hi~ assist- ance. Student wives are very interested in the savings a campus cooper- ative store would mean, Mrs. Al- fred Bobts, Jr., recently elected club president, declared. A prob- lem that now exists is the inability of the club to bring its members together to inform them of the workings of such a store and the re~pon>~ibilitics that would appear with thl' adoption uf :,;urh u pro- gram as cooperative buying. Only approximately -twelve percent of the wives of Union undergraduates Idol Editor \Continued from page 4) stimulate contributions for the coming issue. The third problem, Idol Editorial policy, is easily resolved. The policy of the Idol is no policy at all. inu~­ much as the Idol will bring any material of literary worth. be it fictional, political, sci-enttfic, or humorous. The only requirement is that the material have some popular appeal, and have merit in the eyes of the Editorial Board. If it is felt that the Editorial board is not qualified to judge literary worth, it should be pointed out that competition for positions on the Editorial Board is competitive, and no competition at all was offered the present members. Apathy rears its head again! Every student here should consider himself both an agent of, and a possible contri- butor to the Idol. Only by seeing to it that h£> and his friends con- tribute their bright ideas and happy thoughts to their magazine, will that magazine remain on its feet.

This is as much as all other publica- tions combined, and there is con- siderable feeling that the value of the yearbook does not warrant the expense. The suggestion was made that cheaper production processes be used, hut investigation showed that the present price of produc- tion is quite reasonable, and that cheaper processes wou]d result in considerably inferior quality. Ris- ing engraving and photography costs will probably make the cost of next year's issue even higher. The form of the GARNET must be decided before the budget hear- ings are held in April. Alternativ!'s Stated Several alternatives are possible. The committee set up by the Pub- lications Board to study the prob- lem, headed by James Landry '49, editor of the GARNET, suggested that the GARNET become a class book, containing only material re- lating to the Senior Class, and dis- tributed only to seniors. The com- mittee felt that this was the only way to mnintain high quality, and reduce ~osts. AtH,ther possibility might be some form of subscrip- tion hook, with student tax funds paying some pnrt of the cost, and the remainder paid hy students who buy th<' GARNET. Neither plan is vet·y well received, but the problem is of such nature that it is not possible to produce a GAR- ::-.;ET like those of last year and pre-war years, whilo> the student tax remains nt $16 a year. The only alternnti\'es other than the two mentioned seetn to be a rise in the studPnt tnx, or considerably reduced quality.

Engineers Asked To Select Field Mr. T. M. Linville and Mr. H. T. Maser from the General Electric Company addressed a joint meeting of the Union College and Rensse- laer Polytechnic Institute Student branches of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers slast night at R.P.I. The meeting was spon- sored by the Schenectady Branch of the A.I.E.E. to .promote more personal contact between student and graduate engineers and to en- large the scope of technical ma- terial about recent developments available .to the students. Math Important According to Mr. Linville, who spoke about domestic opportunities in the field, students should empha- size basic physical and mathemat- ical laws since applications of these concepts to actual engineering practice vary from company to company and time to time. The student engineer should develop the habit of attacking his problems from manay different angles to <Continued on page 4) Earl Strickland, leader of the band that will be featured at the coming Winter Weekend, returns to the scene of his \big break\ when he plays in Alumni Gym on Friday night Feb. 27. That break came in 1944 When Jack Teagarden was playing a prom here at the college. Strickland was leading his local band in a job at the u.s.a. down- town. Due to a battered bass and an even more \battered\ bass player, Teagarden needed a man in a hurry for a broadcast from the dance. After hurried calls to Strickland to leave his band and come over, this was finally accom- plished. Earl played the show, had a midnight snack with Jack, was offered a contract and said he'd think it o-..:er. ·Musician Plus Every telegram he received. \upped\ the ante.

After the Teagarden experience there was a stretch with Sonny Dunham and other name bands, all of which followed the same route across the country. Today, back home and glad to be here, Strickland leads 15 men and a girl through arrangements, stocks, rhumbas, tangos, sambas \Zee Jazz hot!,\ with Earl Strlcldand ou the bass, Sonny Salad, clarinet, Bob Pratt ou the tromboue and AI Brown on the sparlding horn.

Symphonic Jazz The men in Strickland's first b<\11d we1·e considerably older than their leader, so at 18 years of age he grew a mustache, or reasonably accurate facsimile thereof, and did his best to look old enough to con- trol the outfit. Due to this early ~lassical iufluence the subsequent bands of Strickland's have all played the full, symphonic and slightly dramatic type of jazz, but with versatility in style and chang- ing tempo. While studying art at Pratt In- stitute, his band was accepted as the official coHege outfit and paid his way through school, with the food situation being well-in-hand through jerking sodas and waiting on tables. Despite a life devoted to radio and commercial advertising, music reigned supreme. He helped or- ganize the Schenectady Symphony Orchestra and has played bass with that organization for 14 years, while playing 'cello with the Al- bany Symphony.

She made it clear thnt the 90-95% illit- eracy does not mean that the peo- ple are dumb hut that they have not had opportunities to he educat- ed in modernities. They have a profound knowledge of the uni- VPrs~lities passed on by story- tellers and historians who travel from village to village. Another of China's problems is the great inter·pst tnken by Russia in the Chinese Communist party, according to Miss Buck.

This editorial mav be consioeJw! as an attempt to furthe1· b:tcigL'l' <lll old che:~tnut, Jmt \\'{'feel that th!s issue has ne\'e1· been clearly stated: Is It desirable t'or the entin• student body, that van·ue and unkno\\\n quantity, to know the in;jde \\\orking·s of campus affairs: also, if they did, would they be capable of handling them without thmwing additional monkey 'renclws into the already fitful, Rube Gold- !. rg-ian contraption '? So Sav the More Smug There is current in some higher quarters 1e pe;~simistic opinion that l'nion'~ \g:re~t unwashL•cl\ might better be left 111 then· pean'fnl, isolated quagmil·es of ignorance; and that an v nttempt to elevate them would, hon·m· of lloJTors, bring part of their en- \'ironment with tlwm. A case in point is the recent publicity of the cul system. \\'e have learned to our ctisma~· that most of the stu- dents had no inklimr of this compensation: but en>n more irritating was the expressed criticism that we \\·ere bringing up a touchy issue before the uncritical eyes of the college proletarint. We wish to make this point of policy cl0m·: the1·e is no valid reason why the cut s\·stem or any othe1· issue should 1Je treat- eel a~ an illt>gitimate child to be \Yhispered about and secretly bartered back and forth by the wise elite. So Sav the Statistics THE PLAY'S THE THING Jn lhPit• production of three ·one-act plays, \Strilce the Scene,\ the Mountebanks lay claim to experimental drama. or so the play- bi·ll infutms me. There is some doubt in my mind whether three plays as old and as mild as these constitute experimental dt am a, so I will assume that the wurd experintt·ntul was added because there was some duubt in ( hl' minds Gf those responsible for pro- duct ion about the advisability of these three as Union fare. I think the plotting board nPed not have ft·etted. To a people reared on movies, almost any play ean be con- I «idPrPd c>xperiml'ntal if it strays at all from tilt' pffortless banality of most movies. On I the othPr hand, l'Xperimental drama can hP an indirect scapegoat for the producers since in case of failure to please an audience, tht•y can easily make claim that the ncw- nPBs of thP production was too much for tilt' hnors who saw it and didn't like it. mnc(' I am not at the mom('nt in the posi- tion of bPing- able to read minds, I will accPpt thl' words of the play-bill without examination more. The three plays, \Aria da Capo,\ by Edna :'\t. Vincent Millay. \A Minuet,\ by Louis N. Parkl'r, and \\Vays and Means\ by Noel C<JII\at·d. were not gathered together because of any running thread of idea as far u:; l can H<'<', other than the old theory of \give evrrybody something.\ The plays in the ordt•r named. run from thought through emotion, to laughter. and very pleasant it is to be able to get those three for the price of one ticket. I am not quite sure l did. Miss Millay's \Aria da Capo\ is a fanciful little hodgepodge opening with a Pierrot and Columbine, who engage themselves in some rather strained and humorless comedy reminiscent both of the traditional and of Noel Coward at his most untied. They are swept off the stage by an odd and ominous gentleman, Cothurnus, who mounts a throne and calls in his players, two shepherd types named Thyrsis and Corydon. These two go through their pastoral paces until the game they start to play assumes propor- tiuns they hadn't expected. It was about here that the audience caught on. Gee whiz. this was symbolism! Since you can't take any pleasure in symbolism unless you reeognize the symbols, the audience now began to enjoy themselves. It was as if they were saying, \You'll have to be more obscure than this to fool me.\ Even when the two shepherds had finally done each i uthct· in and Columbine and Pierrot had rPaRsummed ·their inanities the public re- maim•d in the know. lt seemed a rather'· palatable bit of nonsense, but I am sure .ilb,; ~Hila v could haVl' been about better thing,; wh~n she turned this out almost · three decades ago. Ja~<]ueJ.ine Coplon as Columbine, and John .Milford as Pierret seemed just a bit em- barrassed and not too sure of why they· were saying the things they were saying.: Tht•y are both quite personable people, and were satisfactoril\• thalamic in their be- havior. Alfred Siesel, as Cothurnus, spoke a small part well. Jack Imrie and Robert :lliller, Thyrsis and Corydon, were by far · the best team in the play. They had a simplicity and a bucolic wonderment and a ~incerity that impt,es:;ed me. I think 1 can dismiss the class early after. my discus;;ion of \A Minuet.\ Louis N. Parker has written a bit of not very great · profundity in nut very impressive verse about two ci-devant aristocrats awaiting the tumbril. I find it hard to say more than that it is a pretty p:ece. Take your grand- mother. Cbrk Potter and Lucille Kenny as the :\Iarqui:; and .Marchioness showed a skill that seemed wasted here, and Hugh Wisoff, as a drunken gaoler, semed determined to li.ft the whole thing off the ground by brute strength. He was obviously enjoying him- self, and I enjoyed watching him. •.; \\\\ays and Means,\ one of Noel Coward's best, was notably done well by. This play about two suddenly impecunious social floaters and their amoral way out of their difficulties was a pleasure to behold. The cast never let it out of their grasp. Arthur Kean as Toby Cartwt'ight and Jane Camp- bell as his wife handled the Cowardian flip- pancies excellently, and Jacques Cassidy as Chaps amused me as much as the setting pleased me. The other minor parts were handled adequately, but with no particular brilliancy. This play ;vas for me the high point of the evening. Letters Whether the bill was experimental or nof, the el'ening was well spent. The Mounte- banks seemed to have hit a mean between ambition and the limitations on their abili- ties. I feel more hopeful than I had about the possibility of Union's regaining the posi- tion it once held in college drama.-G. W. Z. Dear 'Sir: On UMT to questions, to what avail are abstract, arm- chair soliliquizings about the Marshall plan, et al, when we haven't the ene1·gy or the ability to manage our own affairs'? For Your Information GOPers to Meet The Union College Young Re- publican Club announces, through its organizPt' Pat Sullivan, that there will be a m~ting of the group at a time and place to be aJUlotmced early next week. The tPmporary officers are 1\-law:iee HosPnstoclc, I' resident; Rio hard Foxton, Vice-presidPnt; and Assist- ant l'rofessor HPnry J. Swanl•er as .Faculty Advisor. One of the most controversial issues of our day, Universal Mili- tary Training, has been vividly brought to the attention of the stu- dent body of Union College through the concerted efforts of the mem- bers· of the American Veterans Committee. The feelings of this organization have been quite obvi- ous and quite prominently display- ed. They have consistently taken a stand against the proposed pro- gram. They have tried to discredit military training by conveying a quite impalatable impression to the student body of the aims and ob- jectives of this program. Any Questions? Then Answei'! STUDENT WIVES CLUB So far the issue has been pre- sented in a very one-sided manner, giving no opportunity to those who wish to speak out in favor of the program. In the spirit of this proposal, The American Veterans Committee is invited to a public forum by the Philomathean Society, with the avowed purpose in mind to give the student body the opportunity to hear both sides of the question. Ralph Nestle Pres. Philomathean Societ),' FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 20, 1948 UP! the Editor of the picture. In my experience on the ·C'oncordy as Editor dur- ing the Navy program and as Managing Editor during the past semester, I found that the main reasons why students worked for the college publications were 1.) primarily, an urge to write and to see their work in print, and 2.) a desire to participate more fully in college activities. The mercenary attitude entered the picture when it was found that it was impossible to hold an outside job and devote the necessary time to the publica- tion simultaneously, The thing that must be consid- ered is that the Concordy, for in- stance, takes U).} a great amount of the editors' time. making it next to impossible to hold any job from which a steady income is available. The editors must give up remunera- tive outside work to be able to give the required time to the publication. This means giving up a job at, say, sixty cents per hour (or up) with regular hours, for a job at approximately fifteen or twenty cents per hour. with crazy hom·s. As it turns out, the monetary angle is secondary and is there only through necessity; as great as stu- dent fervor may be (and it's not very great at Union), it is still im- Granted this pi·oc-edure may be expedient when mn·king in a large concern such as Gen- eral Electric-, hut what is overlooked is the fact that colleg·e men comprise the top 3~i­ of the mental population of the country. These are not the men who will be biasedly pulling all one-row leve1·s in an electio~ booth, but are ~upposedly the men runnmg for office, and more significantly leading their communitit>s. If, in the vital t1·aining ground of college, this opportunity fm· expel'ience is denierl, l\nion collep:e with all its beautiful ideals may as well fold up its circus tent and silentlv sneak away. Consider these questions, write us your opinions or voice them to your council: 1) Over a long span, does the college need new athletic facilities rather than a new Bailey I! all, a new Library, or better housing? 2) would an opinion poll conceming· the hour and content of chapel programs and the tt·end of religious need on the campus Le effective toward some change? 3) Are there any pos- sible alterations in the activities set-up which would eliminate unnecessary conflicts be- tween lectures and contests such as occuned last \V ednesday evening, among other things'? .f) Should Union take a greater interest in national politics and organizations? Your feelings count for much; as a group you can accomplish more than you might think ... the council and the administration are more sensitive than many imagine. Due to the basketball game Wed- nesday night, the Student Wive's Club will meet Tuesday, February 24 at 8 p.m. at the home of Mrs. Wilford Ketz. A record party and refreshments will follow the busi- ness meeting. The wives are cor- dially invited to bring a favorite record. On Cut System Dear Sir: Your case for publications cuts at Union is well taken, I feel, how- ever, that you have over-empha- sized the \mercenary attitude\ side . possible to weld financial necessity and school spirit together into a working combination for school publications without giving some money for work performed, In a'nswer then to those who wish to know the important functions of the newspaper, we state that the most pressing is to stimu- late student inte1·est, aid in its fullest expres- sion, and to keep facts before the campus eyes.

Union College and National Politics Apathy on the part of the people is often said to be rP\ponsible for the failings and evils that are apparent in thl' so-called democratic system of gov- ernment. Apathy in adult lif<'. particularly toward political issuPs, is C>ngendered by apathy that is fos- tered and prevalent during the formative years of the individual. Are Polities Bad? The college student is especially in danger of falling prey to apathy concerning political happen- ings as a result of his being exposPd to the realistic side of politics nnd the running!> of government in courses which portray pressure politics, political machines and a warped and powerful prPss. These forcPs, nil apparPntly working- for th(' overthrow of a citizen-rrprC'sented type of government under the guiHP of frPPdOnl of Pnterpris£', laiHHez-faire in gov- ('l'nment. and frC>edom of the prPss. tC>nd to influence tlw individual townrds the viC>w that politics and political life arp for a distinct type of an individual. It is oftpn believC'd to he inevitable by this same person that to he a part of such a s}·stem would mP'ln 1<ln•P:il1!\' him~rlf ~n thf' lr'\'f'l nf ~hf' IJnscrupu- lous persons now takin;.: an activo' part in thP gov- ernment, ft•dt•tal, state and local. Thugh he realizes that \the evil that men do\ is highlighted nnd that the \uncorruptible\ in politics is prnisPd ti1ough s!'ldnm Pmttlated, this pC'l'son is guilty of lethargy in his actions as a citizen. Voting is often as far as he goes with his civic activities, If he goes that far. Student Politics It Is with these above thoughts in mind that thi.g paper reports of the program and progress of the students of Park College, Missouri. as reported in the Government's Higher Education phamphlet re cently. In essence their program is this: Starting Dec. 10. 1947 the aims and objectives of the major political parties were presented to the student body. Participation as actual voters plus being an informed voter is the keynote of the program. Affiliation 1vith one of the parties is fostered. Ac- tive discussion and debate concerning the political issues of the day can not help but be a part of this program. National and local party leaders are schE\duled to speak during the spring semester. Al- ready local chapters of the Young Republicans, Young Democrats, and Young Socialists have been organ !zed along national party lines. Political Ieadet'll in Kansas City have promised interviews with national party candidates as they visit the city. This campus political campaign will mount in intensity until it is terminated on election day in NovPmber. HE\re's Your Chance A program such as the one just described pro- mote\ active interest on the part of E'Very student and apathy has no place in it. That such a program be inaugurated here at Union College is possible and feasible for surely there has been exhibited an in- terest in national and intet·national affairs. Witness the rPcPnt criticism by some who label campus k''\'\ \\' \]•iddling\ and uf bcmg of little ur nu im- port in t hf' life of the student today. The Concordiensis is very much interested in see- ing a similiar program set up on the campus. Steps are now being taken by staff members to contact the Government Department, the A.V.C .. the Philo- mathcans and those students who have shown by their actions that they are actively interested in domestic politics. It is hoped that these groups will take the neces- sary steps to establish such a program. Already the Young Republican Club of New York State has student members here on the campus who are rapidly organizing a group of students. Readers who want to become an active part of this proposed program are requested to write to the Concordy or drop in at the office so that their names may be submitted to the proper group.

However the fighting Troj- ans would not gi·ve up, and slowly started to close the gap. With four minutes gone Union was dealt a blow when Tim Shea drew his fifth personal foul and left the game. Near the end of the period the scare stood at 42-40, but suc- cessive shots by O'Neil and Pem- rick widened the gap, and at the end of the period Union held a· slim 46-43 advantage. The final period was the usual hectic battle that foHowers of the Union-R.P.I. series are accustomed to. At the start the Engineers closed the gap to one point, 46-45.

At the end, the Trojans put en a desperate effort to catch up, but to no avail. They managed to close the gap to 60-57 with only two minutes remaining, but the Garnet contro:Jed the ball in the closing seconds, and Schultz even managed to make his total an even 25 in the last seconds when he sank a lay up shot.

I'm so glad that th£> Athlet k Depart- ment ·has seen fit to l'PRUl'l'ect this ancient ('Ustom of having cher•r· leaders present at all athletic func· tions. Remember how voracious were our \defenders of school spirit\ last Fall. The Rochester rally started the grid season off with a hang; but after this initial noisy success it became more common to see these exponents of aggres- sive spirit comfortably ensconced with their dates in the grand· stand:l. Having finished their hot- dogs they did on occasion lead the student body in a \thundering\ cheer. Came the chill winds of winter our cheerleaders, like the leaves on the trees. dropped from view and were buried u:~der the first snow. With this week's thaw it was a real pleasure to see that our morale builders had ag-ain returned. The \fair weather\ spirit of the Union stands must have been a real inspiration to the returning cheerleaders. Isn't it odd when the Garnet is on top, long and loud are the Union cheers; but when the Garnet is on the light end of a score how feeble and sporadic the encouragement from the stands becomes? Lacrosse Chooses •47 All-Star Team W. Brooke Tunstall '45, captain of the Johns Hopkins lacrosse team, \\as named by the Inter- Collegiate Lacrosse Association as a member of the first All-American team for 1947. The release states, ·'Brooke Tunstall, star in prep school, at Union College, at Cornell, on the '42 and '44 All-North, for Mt. Washington and Hopkins, and All-South '47, a possessor this year of the cherished Jack Turnbull trophy, has a record probably not shared by any player in the coun- try\. In the selections two other Union players. James A. Flynn '50 and William R. Grant '50, are also given honorable mention; Flynn for his stellar defense play, and Grant for his excellent work in the goal. Grant led the 1947 Gar- net team, and Flynn was voted the most valuable player on the 1947 squad. What a real incentive the Dutch· men give to their teams! * * * One sport that r·eturned to the Gnr·npt sc<'ne last winter and has \inc£' grown hy lt'aps and bounds i, ~wimming.

It is unfortunate that Pete Nistad has to divide his time be- tween both the jayvee and the varsity ba,.;ket!Jall ><quads. Pete has given a lot of basketball to Union; but it is well nigh impossible in the limited space and with the limited time available for Pete to give the varsity all the coaching they need. One would think that since Union now has the largest Athletic Departm€nt in its history some ar- rangement could be made for a jayvee basketball coach. After all we are \among the six best endowed small colleges in America\'. * * It is gratifying to see that the effor·ts expended by Union soccer enthusiasts last Fall have at last achieved official recognition. This is one of the smartest moves the Student Council and the Ad- ministration have made. Soccer is the one really inter- national sport at Union as wit- nessed by the soccer squad roster, which included almost every for- eign exchange student on the campus. The intric-acies of Amer- ican football, basketball and base- ball are more than the student wt:o has never seen them can com- prehend in his short stay at Union. Howevt'r soccer, which America has imported from the \Continent\, is a game these visitors at Union really know.

1948 next meas· present The ·gave of last in stu. on ine:in- ication the out a pro- II e Greek Heads Hit House Party Edict An angry group of frat ern Hy presidents and influential fraternity members yeste1·day crowded into the Administra- tion Blililding and into SHlin:ran Hall, protesting insults they asserted were implied in a letter reflecting official concerN with conduct at house parties. To Crack Down C. WiHiam Huntley, Dean, after hearing compl'aints of ti:l·e greup. explained that the lett-er, written by him T1.1esday, resulted from a decision by an ad-mi-nistrative com- -mittee to crack down on drinking and sex at the house .parti-es. Rev. C. Vict0r Brown. Chaplain pinned down by the inflamed fra- tern-ity heads, defended the letter, which contained a warning that chaperones wm be asked to report in writing their observations of house party activities tomor1·ow night. Refusing to accept the bur- den of proof for their conduct, th~ house leaders, for whom R0bert Heideii, Pr-esident of Psi Upsi'lon, a:nd Bernard McGivern, member of Delta Chi, appeared to be spokes- men bluntly denounced the warn· ing as \grossly unfair\ and an \in- sult to fraternity memb-ers and thei-r dates.\ RPaffirm Stand \Vhile he denied thnt tlw com- mittee responsible for the letter m-eant to cast refleetion~ on the student~ and their girls, the Chap- lain reaffirmed cri-ticism of house party conduct which he made in a recent address to students at Green ~-----------~--~------------- Mountain Junior College, a girl's school in Vermont. Both the Dean and the Chaplain expressed doubt that any spot checks of fraternity houses would he made tommTow night by admin- istration or faculty members to put tPcth in the decision to enforce the year-old Interfraternity CouncH rules for hou~e parties. Picturing many of today's coHege gi·rls as insecu-re and anxious to please, the Chaplain sa·id that sexua·l prombcuity often results fnJm girls' wiiiingness to conform to what thPy beHev-e to be accepted patterns of conduct at house pa·rties. Rapid mobiHzation of student opinion in protest against the ad- ministrative edict was indicated by a \wHdcat\ single-page sheet writ- ten by unknown stud-ents and dis- tributed early today about the campus. Bitter attacks on Chap- lain Brown, Frederick Wyatt, Graduate Counci.J Secretary, and Helmer \Vehb, Librarian, were con- t:lin!'d in tlw handbi-ll, which was enti tied \Discordicnsist.\ Rev. B10wn and \Vyatt were mentioned only hy thinly-veiled implicution, 11hereas \Vebb was named out- right. Officials Comment on Issue From the Chaplain \I have bern concerned for some time with the fact that parties ha:ve net been up to standurd, and talked this over with various peo- ple before.\ \Vhen asked how thr matter urose, the Chaplain replied that \it was brought up more or less by common agreement at an administrative meeting ar.·d an in- formal committee was set up by the president.\ In answer to a question as to what was wrong with the parties, he stated that \the liquor clause has not bee,n· lived up to ... however, I know of only one case where a woman was in the company of a man above the ground ftoor.\ From the President The pre·sident, Carter Davidson said that, \The main point was the liquor clause since there have been open violators. If the IFC is not willing to enforce the rules them- selves, chapero-nes are the only way lo ever find out whether laws are obeyed.\ On whether the IFC had been consulted prior to the writing of the letter, he stated, \I assume the note was the means of notifica- tion; ... they had. not been pre- viously consulted.\ On the matter of the chaperone report on the parties, \No written reports have previously beC'n rrquired ... there was no intC'ntion of winking at ori1dnal rule\ ... we thought now was a good time to approach mat- ter . . . h3Ve not seen much d•runkedness at pa·rties . . . several Deans ~of area women's college have considered not allowing their girls to attend.\ From the Dean \Yes I wrote the letter, since these things are usually expected to be handled through a Dean's office . . . in all the parties we've attended, everything h!'s been on an even keel ... less liquor than any of the old-time parties.\ From Helmer Webb Asked for an explanation, the Librarian replied, \I can se·e no cause for complaint on the stu- dents' part ... questions are per- fectly proper ...

The daughter is irritably urged by her mother to be less shy and to bring home some gentlemen callers. A lame foot has always made the girl feel different from others and she reverts to sickness when her mother attempts to send her to busi- ness school. The daughter finds happiness in a collection of old record- ings and in a collection of little glass animals which her mother calls \The Glass Menagerie\ . Well, the mother persuades her son to Llring home one of his friends from the warehouse where he works (and which he hates). He does and the results are interesting, especially since the friend is a totally realistic person as opposed to the family and theit· glass menagerie. The end is a tragic one with the girl reverting to her former habits and the son leaving home only to be constantly haunted by the vision of his sister. Or Are They Just Rose-colored, Joe? ThC' pl:!~-. a comedy-drama, coH- t<<'l'tl;o; t lw ronflict between a Southern g·Pnth·woman and her child ret!,. a son, who i:; a srnsitive, amateur poet, and a dnugil ter. who is a neurotic, unable to fat'l' life. The story takes place in St. Louis and is related through the '11l'lllu!Y uf a lml'l'atot· who is also the ;;on. .~ppa1·ently the Southern wom- an'::; husband, who looms as a large l'harader in the play through the prominent rlispbty of his picture (he hiinself is ausent), had moved her to St. Louis and then went traipsing off to have a good time in parts unknown. She has raised the children, and even though she herself fi.nds life too much to cope with and lives in the memol'ies of n grand Southern youth, has definite ideas as to what her chil- dren should be, and have. The sensi- tive son reacts against her constant To tell the story is to tell too little of this play. The narrator method, the sympathetic portrayal of all the characters when the gentleman caller could have been so easily satirized, the brilliant stage lighting, the over- tones, the character of America in the thirties in the background, all these tend to make this. an exceptional play well worth travelling to see. Silliman Hall Dance A square dance will be held in Hale House on Saturday, February 28, at 2 p.m. Between dances entertainment will be given by a barber shop quartet. All Union men and their dates are in- vited. Admission will be $.25 per student, dates free. the Editor editorial 1 will give my solution for the prevention of conflicting programs. Gi\·e someone the authority to schedule all gen- eral intere:;t programs, and also the allotment of meeting places for any and all other meetings that are to take place. There thf'n will be at least one pe1son on the campus who will know wherf' all of the ~cheduled meetings. programs and contests are to lake place.

He was a little bored, she a little naive and so they were sit- ting it out. The evening had begun several houu; ear·l!er as he, his neck still >lllar ling from wrestling with his collar, called fer her at one of the women's residt•nces. The taxi had taken them to one of the small local hott>ls and they had made a ra!ht>r self-conscious· entrance into tlw dining room, their evening clt•th<•s stan,; in g out sharply a~:ainst the more casual clothes of the golfing f1 aternity who inhabit- ed the place. For the length of the dinner they conversed in low tones and after- wards repaired to the bar. \\'\'hat's yours?\ he asked. \A shf'rry please.\ \Suppose they don't have any sllf'rry?\ \Then I'll have a gjn,\ A few minutes passed and he re- turned. \Sorry no sherry or gin, only por·t or whiskey.\ She had dPcidPd on the port but a little while latPr he had come back bear- ing a whiskey. \Just run out of the port\ he announced apologet- ically. ln this way the hilarious evening had dragged on until, at about ten o'clock. they had! decided to look in on the dance. The ball was held in an enor- mous Victorian structure known as the Younger Graduation Hall which architecturally vies for honours with such masterpieces as the Albert Memorial and the Union College Library. Not for this ball was the endless repetition of the current fox trots, the programme was considerably enlivened by the introduction of Eightsome ·reels, Gay Gordons and sundry other manifestations of the Scottish spirit. They had tried to dance a reel but after the first figure bad been completed they had apparently lost the thread of the dance and stood simpering foolishly, in the middl~ ?f th.e capering masses. Nothing m this world looks so foolish as a couple who try to do the Eight- some reel and fail. They vacillate lhere, smiling vacantly, doubtless endeavourin~ to give the impres- sion that they are laughing the whole thing off, while praying for \r('Sentment when outsiders dictate \ . . . the music to stop so that they may escape to the comparative security of alcoves surrounding the floor. They were sitting it out, looking at the whirling couples on the floor. It certainly presented a colourful spectacle, the numerous tartans of those who were dressed in ~ighland evening dress, an oc caswnal sari of an Indian student. a few uniforms and the flowers o the American girls-the only ones who had corsages. There was real!~· very little to talk about so they sat there smiling vaguely at any and. everyone and wondering when it would all end. Towards one o'clock, (the ball was due to finish at two.) he sug- r.ested that they take a walk down the pier. It was certainly a lovely night, the tide was in and the moon full , . \What is there down on the pier?\ she asked. \Nothing particular.\ \Then why should we go down?\ she in- quired with a searching look. \Well I don't know, just that its ... Oh Hell!\ He collected his wrap and took her out into the night. The bars were shut, the street lamps were out. It was the end of the ball. by Pete Larson Southern Point of View nPyss.

The daughter is irritably CJ.rged by her mother to be less shy and to bring home some geBtlemeN. callers. A lame foot has always made tke girl feel different from others and she re\'eds to sickNess when her mother attempts to send her to bwsi- Ness school. 'The C<laughter finds haEJpiness in a collection of old recor<il- ings ~md In a coHectioR of little glass animals which her mother calls \The Glass l\Ienagerie\. Well, the nwther persuades her son to bring home oNe of his frieNds from the warehouse where he vvorks (and which he hates). He does and the results are interesting, especially since the friend is a totally realistic person as op).!losed to the fanlily and their glass menage1·ie. The end is a t1·agic one with the gkl reve1'ting to her fonner habits and the son leaving home oNly to be constantly haunted by the vision of his sis~ter. ~-\!1d thi:-- :-~ lt•d ;1,-it~. \\'l' l·~\t .\\ptt J.l.'tlplt·. .\i] ,\'t:tl' :tllll[J,,! \ll' J:,l' ,·.,1' t:.,. ti•llL' 1\lll'U \\t' Llll :,!<t/.l' <'II >lllllt't!Jin;~· t.·li; •' l<~l'd,\· [IJ;IIl studvn1.< ,.,~;,,,ju,.;t ''\ll't. :tr:d ~~~!:tr...: ·,·,i:uju:--t l'--tll't.

The narrator method, the sympathetic portrayal of all the characters when the gentleman caller could have been so easily satirized, the brilliant stage lighting, the over- tones, the character of America in the thirties in the background, all these tend to make this an exceptional play well worth travelling to see.

In this way the hilarious evening had dragged on Ulltil, at about ten o'clock. they had decided to look in on the dance. The ball was held in an enor- mous Victorian structure known as the Younger Graduation Hall which architecturally vies for honours with such masterpieces as the Albert Memorial and the Union College Library. Not for this ball was the endless repetition of the current fox trots, the programme was considerably enlivened by the introduction of Eightsomc reels, Gay Gordons and sundry other manifestations of the Scottish spirit. They had tried to dance a reel but after the first figure had been completed they had apparently lost the thread of the dance and stood simpering foolishly, in the middl~ of the capering masses. Nothing i11 this world looks so foolish as a couple who try to do the Eight- some reel and fail. They vacillate there, smiling vacantly, doubtless endeavouring. to give the impres- sion that they are laughing the whole thing off, while praying for the music to stop so that they may escape to the comparative security of alcoves surrounding the floor. They were sitting it out, looking at the whlr1ing couples on the floor. It certainly presented a colourful spectacle, the numerous tartans of those who were dressed in highland evening dress an oc- casional sari of an Indian 'student a few uniforms and the flowers of the American girls-the only ones who hnd corsages. There was really very little to talk about so they sat there smiling vaguely at any a11d everyone and wondering when it would all end. Towards one o'clock, (the ball was due to finish at two.) he sug- f•ested that they take a walk down t~e pier. It was certainly a lovely mght, the tide was in and the moon full ... \What is there down on the pier?\ she asked. \Nothing particular.\ \Then why should we go down?\ she in- quired with a searching look. \Well I don't know, just that its ... Oh Hell!\ He collected his wrap and took her out into the night. The bars were shut, the street lamps were out. It was the end of the ball.

Come now, Mrs. Prince, aren't you carrying things a little too far? And from the alcoholic point of view, is it a sin to drink somewhat too much on a weekend as a let-down from several hard weeks of study? Don't many of your friends have a cocktail or two after work each day? Figure then, Mrs. Prince, if they have two a day ,how much we have to do to catch up after three or four weeks. And, Mrs. Prince, people don't get horribly drunk at houseparties, nor do they get horribly seduced. If they get either drunk and/or seduced, they usually have a good time doing it.

That her views offended and irritated some of the already conscientious (in one way or another) men on ca:mpus is evident f.rorn letters (see Editorial page), comments and from the following serio-comic prom feature-Ed. Oh come now Mrs. Prince, let's be realistic. Let's take the wool from over our eyes and gaze at the world that exists around and about us.

It is prom week-end when every Union man is pledged to a good time. On prom night an essay on morality is as ap- propriate as singing hymns at a prize fight. But Anyhow Why is this especially true here at Union? One reason is that we are guilty of doing our best to change the mores of society to ac- commodate our sensual urges, basing our right to do this on a desire. to reduce life's frustrations which are psychologically harmful. In other words we l!ave attempted to rationalize sin into right. ~---------------------------- versation leading up to this week has centered on a low le·vel. Most of us are thinking seriously of marriage. We have invited a girl to the prom for whom we have a great deal of respect. This actual- ity and the loose vein in which we talk about these weekends hardly seem to be compatible to each other. Sex is good, because God made it. We should beg~n now to prepare ourselves to get the most fun out of il Next the leader of the northeast- ern Communist district speaks.

Foster, the national chairman of the party appears at a rear door and starts to walk to the front of the hall. Everyone claps hysteric- ally. The speaker bows his head and folds his har.ds, obviously in veneration of his idol. Foster is disappointing. He looks like a hardware clerk. Now he's talking. No need to listen to him, for I have my report of his speech already planned. It is no longer wrong to have sexual intercourse outsic1e the mar- riage bond; rather it is a joke. Is this really in the interests of re- ducing frustration? Countless sur- veys prove that frustration is ac- CEl'nted by such acts; and this is especially true whe:n an indi'vidual attempts to establish himself in the family pattern a little later in life, a pattern into which we all must adjust regardless of our own opinions concerning its merits.

SIGMA CHI Fish and Game News This week-end, due to innumer- able pI ann in g boards getting tangled up in each other, there is lit tie to do after the Big Dance is over. lRegularly planned activi- ties, that is) of course, spontaneous parties are always looked upon with favor; indoor sports and games of all varieties may be in- vented and time will pass rapidly with the introduction of stimulants such as good company and adrena- lin. Quiet, Please Tidd.ly-winlts is a good game to be played on a quiet Saturday aft- ernoon, some implements are re- quired but the most important things are a Union man and his date. The Union man proceeds to get his d~te a little tiddJy, then winks and the game starts. This is best played on the floor in front of a roaring, fire although some experts insist that to be really dif- ficult it must be played in pitch blaclmess on an uneven park bench. For those with automobiles, hop scotch is a very entertaining and been invented. The routine is the same as in elementary hop scotch but at each tavern a double scotch• is consumed instead of the baby- sized single scotch. This game usually doesn't last as long as the elementary one but is more fun while it lasts. You may just sit in a corner and swear to yourself, like when the fat lady fell in the little brook ·· .... . ~:: · . .:\·.1' .. One of the finest sources of en- tertainment for a weekend, such as this one is a qui-et corner and several copies of the Clipsheet of the Board of Temperance of the Methodist Church. Many items are good for tearful cries or pite- ous weepings such as \When you gaze at one of those beautiful whiskey ads just remember that advertisement may kill someone! backwards aJl year. Eat hog, and e ec a Y· root forward.\ Or, \Happy days! KAPPA Holly, mistletoe, Christmas carols ALPHA SOC liquor, murder, rape, mayhem and riot, Merry Christmas! On Creating On cold winter nights games of chance are fun, too. One of the oldest forms of this is that known as \taking a chance on an indian blanket\; however if you don't win you get a papoose as a. \consola- tion.\ If the lights go out sud- denly and you aren't satisfied with your date you can create a flurry of excitement and take your chances on what you find.

Union was slow in .getting under ·!> - -- - - - - -- - way in the first hal.f and it was 3 minutes, 20 seconds after the \pen- ing whbtle before Pemrick hit the hoop fur Union's first score. Ft·om then on, the game wa:s a: series of· thriHs ar.d :;pHI-s. At one time in U1e first of the 20-minlite _halves, Mohawl( was ahead 33-21. By baH time, the Dutchmen had hacked down this lead. to 34-31. In the first half, Mohawk made a totaJ of two substitut iuns of four men each, but always leaving in Tocci, its mainstay. Tocci was defin.itely a fine ball handler and play maker, but his ·hard· play l~d to five personal fouls and his d·!S- missal early in the second half. At this point, Union was behind 43-41. Almost immecliately, a field goal by Schultz and, a foul con- version by Markes evened up the score at 44-44, and from then o~, it was Union's game. Mohawk~ omnzu fol·lowed teammate Tocci shortly after via the foul rout~, further eJ.iminating Mohawks chance for victory. The final score showed Union out in front 67-59. Since Wednesday the Garnet has been gunning for the Continentals, and its sixth straight win, tomor- row night at Hamilton. The game is scheduled to start at 4 P. M. In its previous encounter this season, Union came from behind to rack up 28 points in the third quarter anc1 win 72-56. However, the· team can expect a hard battle if com- parative scores mean anything. Union barely got by Hoba:rt last Saturday with a 44-38 win, while Hamilton warped Hobart 62-51 Wednesday evening;. The scheduled March 3 game with RPI has been postponed until March 9 due to a National Guard inspection at the Troy Armory. Union defeated RPI here this sea- son 63-58 on February 18, a game highlighted by Schultz's 25 points. The Dutchmen will be out to break the RPI court jir:x that has hov- ered over Union in recent court battles there. In their last two games, the Culver and Whalen Enter 1C4A Contest Two Ga.rnet trackmen, Newt Cul- ver and Ken Whalen, have been entPred by Coach Bill Ketz in the 27th annual I.C.4A indoor track and field championships in il!ew York's M·adison .Square Garden to- monow afternoon. Culver, the ca·ptain of tlw Gar- net track squad, will participate in the 1000 yard run, while Whalen will be a contestant in the 16 lb. shotput. The two men will leave this afternoon for New York, and will be accompanied by Coach Ketz. Culver, Who has been practicing dHigently at the Y.M.C.A. f0r sev- eral weeks, ran last week in the Nationals in New York, and placed seventh in a hewt of nine men. He finished six seconds bebind the winner in a time of 2:25. How- ever, he got off to a bad start, and Coach Ketz expects him to do much better in tomorrow's meet. Whalen, who has shattered several school shot put recol'ds, is expected to place high up in the meet. The .ptelimina1·y heats will be run off toinorrow afternoon, and if Union's representatives make out all right they will run in the finals Saturday night. Ft·eshmen won from State Teach- ers 64-62, but lost to the taller Cobleskill Aggies 47-41, after lead- ing most of the way. This brings the Frosh record to 2 wins in 6 starts. They will accompany the varsity to Hamilton tomorrow where they will play in the pre- liminary against the Hamilton Frosh. Their game is scheduled to get under way at 2 P. M.
