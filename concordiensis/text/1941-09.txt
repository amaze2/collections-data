Pr·esident Fox Address Students ---~~ Students deferred by local draft Spoke This Morning· COMI\USSIONER LUNN Rojansky To Go To Princeton Plans to Return To Union Next Year Announcement of a one year leave of absence to Dr. Vladimir Rojansky, professor of physics and acting head of the physics depart- ment at Union College, to spend a \refresher\ year's teaching as visit- ing associate professor at Princeton was made today by President Dixon Ryan Fox. Dr. A. H. Spees, for- merly of the Detroit Institute of Technology has been engaged to teach during Dr. Rojansky's leave. Nationally known for his \contra- terrene\ theozy of matter, Dr. Ro- jansky leaves Union temporarily for the second time since he began teaching here. About 10 years ago, he went to Princeton as a National Research Fellow. Will Teach Courses boards were told today by Presi- dent Fox that they must \not em- bezzle the time that the nation has put at our disposal,\ as he dis- closed that college students were \under national appointment, as never in past year, to make each day count in our individual prep- aration for leadership.\ President Fox and George R. Lunn, public service commissioner and former lieutenant governor of New York State, were the prin- cipal speakers at exercises in Me- morial Chapel officially opening Union's 147th academic year. In their analysis of the problems confronting the country, both Pres- ident Fox and Commissioner Lunn inveighed against isolationists who ranged from \American Quislings\ to \Defeatists\ who \doubtless think that Democracy, as we have known it and practiced it, is not worth defending . Commissioner Lunn developed the theme that the Nazi blueprint for world power, as revealed by Hitler in his speeches and books, contains \not a syllable . . . that gives any weight to spiritu:il val- ues.\ After comparing the record of Hitler's promises not to invade I European countries and his actual surprise attacks of them, hl:l said, 'You cannot deal with a man like .Hitler on any basis of truth and in- tegrity. His word is utterly worth- less.\ Dr. Fox said that the many iso- lationists who \would defend their doorsteps, but would not go out to challenge an enemy on the way,\ were very much like \the people Df Schenectady, 250 years ago, who thinking that the French and In- dians were too fat· away to make invasion practicable, left the gates of their palisade open and bloclted only with snow! Four-fifths of these, despite their bravery at the last, died as a result.\ Urges Longer Bill President Fox urged favorable congressional consideration of the bill introduced by Senator Langer which would amend the present op- erating rule in the selective serv- ice under which \a student may be plucked out of the classroom in the middle of any week.\ He recom- mended that since the present se- lective military service extends two and a half years, \the country· would be better off if every college student were permitted to complete that course or show that he would not complete it in four years. He emphasized that \no one is asking for exemption of college students, only deferment.\ Turning to the college students themselves, Dr. Fox said: \The world is torn with war. America is in that all-enveloping war, how- ever we split hairs as to our legal status with respect to it ... With our fellows in military camps, with sacrifices being made all about us, can we keep even the shreds of self-respect if in our college life we validate in the slightest degree the charge of softness an.d fl'ivolity which has too often been levelled against American youth? . . . By their answers, steadily worked out, we shall show ourselves to be good citizens. not slackers.\ Commissioner Lunn, an honorary member of the Class of 1884 which \adopted him\ in 1905 when Union conferred an honorary ductorate degree upon him, advised the ;;tu- dents that \if the President of the United States has back of him the loyal' and earnest cooperation of the people, t·here is nothing in the in.terest of the common good which cannot be accomplished. America has never failed yet and she will not fail now.\ Hitler's attempt to kill democracy in other countries is the new challenge \to a new loyalty.\ He warned isolationists that ''De- mocracy in America ca·nnot survive if it is dead in all other parts of the world. You cannot coniine great principles and cabin them within a restricted area withou: at the same time injecting a death virus into those very principles:'

In some of out· cases this world at war is affecting our lives fm· more funda- mentally than any force of which we have ever conc::eived. That it is not an easy job is demonstrated by the numbers of men who were not big· e;wugh to face a retum to theil· collegiate obligations. Some college students, appar- ently convinced that the world was going tu end because the were facing the first stiff problem of their lives, decided against re- turning· to their 1·espective schools this fall. A few took maniage as an easy way out; others sought to bury themselves in \safe occupations\ not including, of course, those men who \Vere fm·ced into these by financial necessity. The fact that all of us are enrolled in Union today shows that we are more capable of grappling with our problems than those who have fallen by the wayside. As demon- strated by the experience of many colleges during the last academic year, however, the mere fact that we are he1·e certainly does not indicate that om· battles are won. Throughout the nation last year, some stu- dents took one form of an easy way out by burying their noses in textbooks for nine solid months. Others went to the opposite extreme and spent their time flunking out eithet· in worrying about the wrong things or by enjoying as long a spree as possi·ble. Neither of these extremes, but a middle course is the road that \ve must pursue. A major reason that we are here now is for the very purpose of following that middle course, to learn without forgetting to play, to carry on the normal existence that has been train- ing the nation's leaders for generations. In being trained to lead the nation on the \1·oad back\ we are students at and worke1~s in a defense industry just as surely as a General Electric engineer or an Army infantryman. A chief difference is that the results of our special brand of defense will take a great deal longer to become apparent. It is inevitable that some of the less pro- ductive but more vociferous comment of the world around us will seep in during the year ahead-hysterical talk, talk of hate, and talk of disillusion. Our job is to accept none of this, to do a good job of college while pur- suing our normal existence and reasoning out our normal thoughts as coolly and as thor- oughly as we are accustomed. CONGRATULATIONS Congratulations are in order for the Ad- missions Office, directed by Frederic A. Wyatt, .for the splendid job it has done in selecting the class of 1945. Few people realize the magnitude of the job involved in admitting a class to Union. A tremendous amount of work is required of the Admissions Office, both during the col- lege year and the summer. During the past year over three thousand inquiries concerning emollment at Union were received at the college. Of all those inquiring and the smaller num- ber actually making application over 250 men were finally admitted. Included in the number admitted were twelve high and pre- paratot·y school valedictorians and a number of other hig-h ranking students, several cap- tains of varsity teams at the several schools, I--~::.:'} · dPfinitPI> n<'<'t! fr:ttPlnity life .

Downfield blocking was btilliant in spots for both But·ns and Sherry Hillick, who did some sterling b::t!'l-carrying fer the first string. Unfortunately Durnti, a hard-run- ning, tough sophomore, is ineligi- ble for out-of-town contests this fall. Even Head Coach Ai•t Lawrence isn't certain yet what will be his starting backfield combination, but om· guess is as good as any. Caught informally by the camera.ma.n,. the above quartet seems to have the inside track for starting backfiPld positions at this stage in the game.

Art LeRoy, a junior, has been converted from gua·rd to round out the contingent of end candidates. Brilliant Bacldield Prospects Less than two weeks now lie be- tween the Dutchmen and their first game. A glance at last year's record of Trinity, the team Union faces in its opener on Sept. 27, is Iather frightening. The Nutmeg- gers dropped only one game last year and that was to Wesleyan by a 13-0 score, Among Trinity's vic- tims were Vermont, which beat Union, 19-7; Worcester Tech, Coast Guard, Hobart, which lost to Union by 13-0; and Amherst. Two years ago Trinity contribut- ed the only blot to an otherwise unbeaten Union record. The two elevens tied, 7-7, and both went on to score seven victories without defeat. It may be that Coach Lawrence can operate with the two-team sys- tem which proved so successful in 1939 for the unbeaten team. He has situation and should come up with some remedy by opening day, bar- ring injuries. Captain Robby Baker will un- doubtedly be the anchot·-man for the line and an inspiration for the whole team. Back at center after a ·:ear as guard, he's one man the coaching staff is putting all its chips on. Frank Jones, a junior, will be Baker's substitute. Lawrence is quite proud of the two dynamos he has developed to alternate at the running right guard position. Both Bruno Schulze, a sophomore, and Dick Hoffman, a junior, have been performing bril- liantly in practice sessions. Heavier men will be posted at left guard. Leading candidates at present are Big Stew <Stretch) Goldblatt, a senior, and Clark (Tiger) Alberts, a sophomore. The all-important tackle situation is bright. Two seniors, two juniors and an experienced sophomore are all on hand. The coaching staff has yet to make a definite choice on regular tackles, but the leading can- didates are Bill Hill, a sophomore; Bundy Shaw, and Abe Dorsman, seniors; and Johnny Adamzevich, Gazette Press Printing GUERRA'S PHARMACY for all • school supplies e prescriptions • soda fountain • tobaccos \we deliver\ 600 UNION ST.

Greg Mc- Kennis, a sophomore who wasn't out for the freshman eleven last fall, has pleased Lawrence with his work and will be Davis' reserve. At the other end are Bob Hallen- beck and Harvey Kayne. Hallen- beck, a senior, boasts lots of ex- perience and is a rugged, depend- able man. Kayne is a well-knit sophomore.

Then there's Ken Sharpe, who'll take Sherman's place as blocking quar- terback now that the latter has been shifted to fullback. Seniors Killian, Hillick, and Eddie Enstice will altemate at halfback.

Through one's aetivities there is ample chance to meet and malre friends with the others on the campus. These activ- ities are open to all. There are The GleP Club, The Mountebanks, The Concordiensis, and the many scho- lastic and professional clubs such Rs t.he Classical Club, or the ASCE. There are also the athletic teams. Surely out of the large selection offered there a1·e one or two groups which will strike anyone's interest. All these advantages are enjoyed by the neutral.

M. Furlong Says Tax Reapportionment Chance ls Sli;gbt Committee Head Fears Drop in Enrollment For Second Semester Possibilities of a t capportionment of student tax money in the light of increased income resulting from tne lar·ger enrollment in college this year seemed slight last night atter Ute resu1ts or a tax committee meet- ing held wednesday had been an- nounced. Chairman Joseph Furlong, speak- ing for tne committee, pointed out that, since a considerable drop in emollment after the end of the first semester .is probable, the in- crease in income will undoubtedly be considerably less than might be tmagined at lirst glance. \..oonse- quently, Furlong said, it seems un- wise to make extra allocations at this time. J:o'urlong. in a special statement on the situation to The Concordien- sis, said that the student tax com- mittee appropriations for the year 1941-42, made at the end of last year, were based on an estimated enrollment of \115 students. The un- certainty of the drait situation and other national defense factors made tnis conservative estimate seem wise, he said. The actual em·oll- ment for this year is 760. Outlook 'Nut Ro~y' \This increase in student body membership would seem to indi- cate that a re-allotment should be made of the tax money, especially in view of the fact that activities budgets. were pared ratner closely last ~pring, ' Furlong went on. \Uoser stuuy will reveal, however, that the outlook is not as rosy as it appears on the surface.\ Tne tax committee chairman quoted estimates of the dean's of- lice and various faculty members, showing that the number register- ing for the second semester will probably be about 40 or 50 students uuder the present enrollment. \This seemingly drastic decrease is ex- pected to be a result of the dratt, ror one thing,\ Furlong said, add- ing that more men may &rop for scnolastic reasons than usual. \The large number of freshman engi- neers is reason enough for this last argument,\ he said. \With a dropping off in the stu- dent body, the income of the tax committee for the second semes- ter wiH be less than it was for the lirst semester,'' Furlong pointed out, \and any net increase over the amount budgeted upon last May will not be great enough to warrant n rt-allocation.\ \The present allotments were de- termined after careful considera- tion,\ the tax committee chairman's statement concludes, \and it is felt by the committee that the various activities can, by careful manage- ment, cat ry out their pt·ograrns successfully with the amounts al- lotted.\ Translating Furlong's statement into figures, it may be seen that on the basis of an expected enroll- ment of 715, the tax committee planned on an income of $8,580. Since this would have been less ~han other years, it was necessary to allocate nearly all of it to avoid too drastic budget cuts. The actual enrollment of 760 would seem to give the tax commit· tee some $540 with which to make reapportionments. In view of the enrollment drop which is feared, however, the committee is counting on a minimum income of about $8,820, a $240 increase. This $240, as yet not allocated, is little more than might ordinar- ily be kept on hand to meet emet·- gencies and new requests, Furlong said. The presence of this money will make it possible for the com- mittee to consider petitions from organizations who feel that the sit- uation has changed sufficently in their fields of endeavor since the budget hearing last spring to war- rant a change in the budgets which were approved. 1 Northern Lights Mean Heavy Underwear, Stillman Tells Union I Freshmen Orientation Committe~ ·~ Radio Wo~kshop,, R~dio Cl~b Joi,n Plans· Active Rule Enforcement In Operation of Wued Wueless Nine o'clock episode: Phone rings in The Concordiensis of- fice, a usual Thursday night episode.

CAA Will Maintain Its Student Quota Despite a cut of one-third in the extent of the Federal Civil Aero- nautics Administration for the com- ing year Union's pilot training pro- gram will be maintained as usual, with its quota of student fliers list- ed at 50. This number, which in- cludes 30 elementary and 20 second- ary, or \advanced\ students, is one of the largest in the state, only N. Y. U. and the University of Buffalo ranldng above it numerically. The new program opens with the first ground school session on Tues- day evening, September 30, accord- ing to Prof. Everett Thatcher, co- ordinator of the local unit. Applications this year have been far more numerous than in the past, Mr. Thatcher said, and the quota will be filled in a short time. Applications may be filed with him yet, however, although applicants will be considered in the order in which they were filed. Physicals Given Physical examinations are now being given for the primary course which includes both ground school study on Tuesday and Friday eve- nings on campus, and flight in- struction at the Schenectady Coun- ty Airport under the direction of George C. Haven. Of Class of 1945 Starting with a meeting of Fresh- men in Old Chapel at 10:00 a. m. Monday morning, the newly .formed Freshmen Orientation Committee is beginning an active campaign for the enforcement of freshman rules. Although the purpose of the meeting has not been revealed it was announced that attendance would be taken and that the fresh- men should bring their songbooks. Headed by Andrew E. Reilly jr., '42, the committee is composed of Robert Carnwright, '43, Karl Klar- man, '44, John Clowe, '44, and America Abruzzese, '44. A sub-com- mittee has also been appointed to aid the main committee in enforce- ment of regulations. Sub-Committee Nam(o'd Members of the sub-committee are: Robert A. Smolka, Robert La Pann, Henry Holt Sturges jr., Her- bert H. Adams, Howard C. Parsons, Arthur Yeates, Robert Haigh, Bruno Schulze, \Valter Galuska, Harvey Kayne, and Wil'liam Hill. All members of the sub-committee are sophomores. The Freshman Orientation Com- mittee was founded by the Student Council last June to fill the impor- tant gap left by the gradual deter- ioration of the old Sophomote Dis- cipline Committee. The new committee aids the fre9hman by acclimating him to his new home. It is supposed to teach him the songs and cheers, insure his frequent attendance at athletics contests, instruct him in the varied and ancient lore of the College, and see that he obeys the college rules for freshmen. Freshman 1\,ules The following rules for freshmen have been issued by the Student Council and will be enforced by the Orientation Committee: 1, Freshmen are to wear a Fresh- man ·Cap until the Christmas re- cess except on Sundays, recesses, or w.hen out of town. These may be purchased in the College Book Store and are to be worn beginning Monday, September 22. 2. Freshmen are to remain seated in Da:ly Assembly until the upper classmen have left the building. 3. Freshmen are to learn all the <'ollcge songs and cheers. The course is open only to sopho- mores juniors, and seniors, and is considered by the college to be an official extra-curricular activity. 4. Freshmen are not to walk upon· During the past summer, 60 stu- the college lawns. dent fliers were trained at Union, The privilege of treading on the Professor Thatcher pointed out, college lawns, an honor usually re- fourteen being from Union.

' lntra:mural Debate Program Planned Philomathean Society To Sponsor Contesti Winner to Receive Cup A program of intramural debat- ing to supplement intercollegiate debating will start on September 30, it was announced today by the ex- ecutive committee of the Philo- mathean Society. Participating in the three leagues will be members of the 18 fraternities·, dormitory representatives and the neutrals, The scheme was developed by the Philomathean executive committee during the spring and the summer. The members of the committee are Edgar Fisher, '42, president of the Philomathean Society; Har·vey Fish- bone, '43, manager of debate; H. Melville Messenger, '43, and Mar- shall Yovits, '44. Messenger will be in charge of the program. Fraternity leaders expressed en- thusiasm for this program when originally contacted and promised full support in making the program a success. The various participating groups will begin preparation for the debates next week for opening forensic contests on Tuesday eve- ning, September 30. Program 01·ganization Each of three leagues is com~ po~ed of six teams which will meet in round robin style, Three de- bates in each league will be held on successive Tuesday evenings. The debates will be conducted in- formally in fraternity houses and other designated places. Two men will represent each group. Members of the faculty will be judges, one judge to each 40-min- ute contest. The highest two teams in each league on the basis of points will participate in the play- off rounds. The final winner will be awarded a 14 inch silver loving cup which will be on display in the library tomorrow. \Is our defense eJ;fort adequate?\ forms the genE:·al theme from which the sub-topics were derived. Three sub-topics are: <1) How effective is the administrative organization? <2) Are we making the best uses of our economic resources? <small business, big business, consumer, labor, agriculture, natural re- sources) <3) Are the essential val- ues of our democracy being endan- gered? Every member of the student body is eligible to compete in the progmm except students actively associated with the Philomathean Society last year. A final list of those ineligible for this competition will be posted next week.

Y. A. campus allot- ments through the Student Employ- ment Bureau, Miss Travis an- nounced :yesterday, The thirty stu- dents still in quest of jobs are being situated as rapidly as possible, heavy engineering and science schedules preventing quick a:ssign- ment in many cases. Supplementing her daily chapel tall<, Miss Travis reported that aside from 15 students on the spe- cial work program in private homes, 10 men are working for rooms and 35 for board. About 50 men have been given part-time jobs. Odd job workers are needed, however, and Miss Travis urged in- terested students to register with the Bureau for afternoon or evening work. Waiters are .still wanted at the Mohawk Golf Club, where sev- eral openings exist for ca·pable workers. The assignment of all N. Y. A. jobs will be completed over the week-end when seventy-six men will be allotted \work scholarships\ as against 106 of last year. Imme- diate placement was not possible due to the necessary study of the needs of the various departments and consideration of the $300 monthly cut in the appropriation. In her morning chapel tallt, Miss Travis stressed four points learned from the Employment Bureau sur- vey of last year. In order to hold jobs, students were advised Hl to be punctual, <2) to earn a reputa- tion for being dependable and co- operative, <3) to practice courtesy and (4) to avoid leaving jobs un- done. The obligation to do weii .for the sake of the College after ac- cepting a job was also cited. Miss Travis outlined reasons for giving and receiving the most out of any job with the advice: \If you have a job, however un- important it may seem to you it pays to put your heart into it. Doing a job weli h~s more than me·t cenary interests. Not only do you make friends for the college while getting an early start as a loyal alumnus, but you also have the opportunity to build up a rec- ord which will serve you in the near futm:e especially if the Place- ment Bureau is to secure you a job after graduation. As Mr. Wyatt has pointed out repeatedly, one of the favorite questions of employers re- mains, \Did ·he carry out a work program while in college?\ The re- sults of outside work done is trans- ferred to your college record at the close of each year, and is a .perma- nent mark of achieve·ment.\ Miss Travis has this to say of students in the engineering and chemistry divisions particularly: \Do not let heavy programs over- whelm you, Keep the goal of a col- lege degree and ultimate member- ship in a fraternity of educated men In mind as your guiding prin- ciplP,'' · Campus confined broadca:_sting, after more than a year of plans and speculations, will become a reaHty on the Union campus l\Ionday afternoon at 5:15 p. m., with the formal opening of UBS, the Union Broadcasting System, from its studios in the Electrical Engineering Building.

Killian, elected to the office by the Student Council last May, wel- comed the entire Student Body back to the college, on behalf of the Student Government on a hope- ful ·key, as he said that \ ..• over America we can see a dif-ferent spirit steadily coming to the fore. This new spirit is not one of wide eyed fanaticism, but rather one which springs from the heart of a mighty nation which at last is be- ginning to realize that there is a job to be done,\ Spirit at Union Connecting .this new spirit with the Union scene, Killian drew at- tention to the fact that, \This feel- ing has been echoed and re-echoed over the campus this fall. If it had not been, a lesser number of you would have returned or enrolled in Union.\ With regard for the Stu- dent Government's plans for the year, Killian promised reforming efforts along two main lines; first, a more systematic organization of social affairs on the campus, and second a new set-up for the band- ling of .freshman orientation. The matter of organizing the so- cial functions has been thoroug-hly investigated ·by the Student Council, the ·spealter said, and some measure of improvement is almost sure to be forthcoming. The old Sophomore Discipline Committee was abolished by the Student Council last year, Killian recalled, and a new Freshman Orientation Committee has been ap- pointed. Their aims will be directed toward such goals as the teaching of the college songs to the new class and the organization of a schedule of interclass rivalry. The new committee will move into action next Monday mot·ning at 10 o'clock, when they will hold a meeting of the Class of 1945. \At- tendance will be .taken,\ Killian promised the Freshmen, \and we expect you all to be there.\ In closing, Killian warned the Student Body not to expect any rlra.stic and noticeable improvement in student conditions. \We prob- ably will not be a<ble to put our fin- ger on any one .point and say 'this is better than it was at the very same time last year',\ he said, \but as the weeks pass we will discern a steady and unmistakable improve- ment. Let's get together and make this a banner year.\ ---0--- 'The Conc:ordiensis' Schedules Freshmen Staff Meeting Freshmen interested in becom- ing members of The Concordiensis are invited to meet the staff of the newspaper Tuesday evening at 7:30 p. m. in the editorial of- fice, second floor, Silliman Hall. There are a great many openings for news and sports writers be- sides photographers. feature welcoming messages from President Fox, Robert F. Killian, '42, president of the .Student Coun- cil, Armand Feigenbaum, editor of The Concordiensis, and John R. Sheehan, '2q, program manager of short wave stations WGEA and WGEO and frequency modulation station W2XOY. Mr. Sheehan, who has been for some time director of the Radio Workshop, will act as master of ceremonies. The program will also include a talk on behalf of the station ,by Myron Mills, '42, president of the Radio Workshop. The announcement of the sta- tion's opening came after a joint meeting of the Radio Club and the Radio Workshop on Tuesday of this week. The final work on the con- struction of UBS facilities is under the direction of Warren Perkins, '42, president of the Radio Club. Perkins is working with Donald Eldred, '42, and other membe1·s of the Radio Club in co-operation with David Borst, Brown, '40, technical manager of the Intercollegiate Broadcasting System. Concordiensiii> News When the station ·is in operation, the Radio Club will continue to maintain and operate the station's facilities. The Radio Workshop will .plan and provide talent for the programs, the listings of which will be carried regularly by The Con- cordiensis. Immediately after the joint meet- ing of the organizations planning to sponsor the network, held on Tuesday of this week, the staff of The Concordiensis, meeting simul- taneously, accepted the responsibil- ity of providing the station with material for all its news broadcasts. Present plans call or a five minute program of late campus news at 5:30 p. m,, and for a program of sports. The broadcast schedule for the opening week calls for one hour of programs every Monday, Wednes- day and Thursday, as well as occa- sional test programs. The regular scheduled broadcasts will be heard between 5:15 and 5:45 p.m., and be- tween 7:15 and 7:45 p. m., on each of the three days mentioned. Until the UBS facilities can be expanded, the programs will be heard only in North College dormitory. Wide Variety of Shows Program plans completed thus far call for a wide variety of shows, all aimed specifically at some phase of campus interest. Perhaps one of the most popular will be the ''Campus Caravan\ to be heard every Mon- day, Wednesday and Thursday at 7:15. This show will present fifteen minutes ·Of the latest, and liveliest, of the popular recordings. Other shows already scheduled for the first week's broadcasting includes a sports review for 7:30, featuring the \Jackpot\ commen- taries of Jack Pearson, Concordien- sis ;:;ports editor. The earlier pro- grams will also feature a selection of populat· classic, swing classic, and modern dance music. Arrangements have been com- pleted with the college librarian, Helmer Webb, for the use of re- cordings from the college library for presentation on the station's fa- cilities. Radio Cl·ub president Warren Perkins pointed out yesterday that UBS can be heard on any standard !'broadcast set which is connected to the North College Wiring system. As soon as the preliminary pro- grams have been presented, and the facilities perfected, work will be begun on expansion of the wir- ing hook-up to include an increas- ing number of college buildings.

'ON THE AIR'-ACHIEVEMENT It is doubtful if there are many ON. the campus unappreciative of the achievement represented in the ability of the men con- nected with the Union Broadcasting System to make the statement: \\Ve will be OH the air J\1onday night at 0 : lG p. m.\ Two years ago there was no radio program work on the Union campus. \\' e had a good Radio Club operating a campus station that was among the first to be established in the United States. Commercial mdio in any of its aspects, was, however, unknovn1. Today we have in the offing- a network exclusively fo1· Union, one that will be stu- dent o\vned, managed, and operated, and one that should fumish the college with a form of entertainment that it certainly wants. A radio tnmsmitte1· is rapidly taking form, scl'ipts for the first programs are being written, and p1·oduction plans are being de- veloped-all by undergraduates. Announcers, t·ecord spinners, control men, news broad- casters, sports commentatol'S, even those who will string up the wire from week to week will all be Union students. To develop the capacity fm· launching a purely student project like this one in the space of two years is a great task. And, as in the gTo\vth of all difficult projects, the results may be traced back to men who gave freely of their time and ideas: On the graduate side there was, of course, ~Iilton Enzer, '29, who had the original idea fo1· a Radio Workshop at Union, and John Sheehan, '25, who gave freely of time from a very heavy schedule of his own so that his experience and abilities might aid mdio at Union. Outstanding- among- students in the rapid development of radio here was Paul Ma- honey, '40, first president of the Radio Work- shop, who developed the p1·esent organization of that group. Then there are :\Iy!'On :\Iills, '42. Granger Tripp, '43, Warren Perkins, '42, Donald Eldred, '42, and a host of othet· mem- bel·s of the Radio Workshop and Radio Club whose efforts have made UBS possible. Working in a quiet and unassuming manner, these men have done enough and learned enough in the past two years so that they are able, with a minimum of fuss, to launch what may well develop into the most impor- tant addition in ;years to the family of extra curricular activities at the college. The student body can have reason to be pl'Oud of the Union Broadcasters. They have shown their organization one of the few ex- ceptions to the rule of lethargic-unto-death \small activities\ on the campus, and are, as a 1·esult, one of the few activities to carry out the real purpose of a student activity- that of giving a great deal of benefit to the men in the project, while doing a service fo1· the college as a whole. Our best wishes to 1\lills, Tripp, Perkins, and Eldred on their big broadcast on Mon- day. When the first vibration is carried over the UBS ·wires to North College, both they and their colleagues may well feel satisfied over one of the real achievements of a colleg·e cm·eer.

The ineptitude of Sophomore Discipline is one obstacle that we need no longer expect, at least as far as may be seen right now. The last Student Council, at the end of a yea1· in which freshman discipline had been obvi- ously unsatisfactory, took the only step open to it. The Council replaced the much abused Sophomore Discipline Committee with a Ft·eshman Orientation Committee. The advantages become immediately ap- parent. The very title of this committee clearly indicates its purpose. It is further qualified for its task by virtue of the fact that it has uppe1·classmen as well as sopho- mores as its members and chairman. These upperclassmen are expected to tempe1· the actions of the group with their experience and ability to regard the freshman orienta- tion from a wider perspective than that of freshrnan-sophomore rivalry. 1\Ierely that this committee is established does not, by any means, indicate that any or. all of the abuses of the Sophomore Discipline Committee have been corrected. To keep it- self a true \Orientation Committee\ the group will have to be constantly on its toes to watch for incidents that might, in one swoop, bring us back to last year and the years before it.

The stand-out for all sections this fa·ll will be the double-breasted with all-at ound belt and shoulder straps, in various modi.fications. And more and more college men are favoring the rain- coats in worsted gabardine, espc- daUy treated to resist rain. Acce,;series will be colorful. Wool socks, ties and mufflers are becom- mg campus \musts with partic- u'lar emphasis this year on the ties, highly styled in color and pattern, which have grown in popularity the past two seasons because of their durability and wrinkle-rcsistan t qualities. The curtailment of Eilk and shipments of European ties has also put additional emphasis en wool ties and socks. One of the favorite colors will be yellow, and yellows and reds against the som- ·bxe background of the browns in suits and coats. Color will be indulged also in underwear, wHh the now favorite shirred elastic 'Waistband shorts availa·ble in the entire color x·ange, and in designs that include solids, ~tripes, plaids, tartans, dots, ·pais- leys, and even ~plashy foulards.

Hats are better styled than they have been in years. Put out with an eye toward blending with the fabric as well as the color of suits and topcoats, the brims are some- what wider in the middle-price range and there is a great variety of brim edge treatments in novelty stitches, underwelts and rolled edges.

That's the cunclu ;;ion the Concordy reached last night after securing pre-seuson pre- dictions from managers of teams in the intramural league regarding t0uch football prospects. The seaHoa starts Monday. Most 0utspoken on the subj£:ct was the Phi Gamma Delta repre- sentative, who shouted into -;he phone, \We'll win again easily. \Ve have one of our ·best tea·ms at'd shouldn't find any opposition.

Stars include Joe Mudge, Ned Reilly, Joe Furlong and others. We've lost Bill Hill to the varsity and Jim Smith via graduation.\ Delta U-How D'ya Do? Delta Upsilon's team will \surely be in there,\ according to Bob Muther. He was reticent about de- scribing yesterday's practice game with the Phi Gams, but said the D.U.'s will have about the same team as last year, with the excep- tion of \Butterball\ Turchick. Psi Upsilon'~ freshmen, 12 good men and true, will be the key to that team's fortunes· on the gridiron this fall, though Charlie Clowe and Don Beal are expected to do well. The loss of Harry Crosby and Art Davis, will be felt. Bob Baker, speaking for Chi Psi, said he couldn't say just how his lads would go this fall, as he hadn't had the pleasure of watchi·ng them last faH. \Subsidization will help us this season,\ he said, pointing to several strong freshmen lying in a corner under a pile of sand- bags. \We'll miss Bill Hartt, Bud Keough and Jim Twining of last year's eleven, but we'll have a pow- erful machine,\ Baker concluded.

'II iBity is going to !Je tuug:1. Memories l·inger of 1939 ,vlwn the Blue a:nd Gold held Union to a 7-7 tie to mar an otherwise clea:n rec- ord. The fact that Trinity lost unly one game last year and had an un- beaten freshmacn team is also fur- bcding news. It will be anyt11in~,; but the kind of game the boys wouid like to open with. They threw a dinner in honor of Art Lawrence at the Governor's Inn last night. His former Sche- nectady liigh School teammates of the 1927 team werP hosts. Principal George Spain<> of Mont Pleasant High School spoke, as did Sig Malmfski, one of Union's all-time athletic grpats, now coaehing some of the nation's bt>st k>ams at Mont J>leasant.

Lim'UP Taking Shape First string be1·ths are practical!~· set, though tomorrow's scrimmage under actual \game\ conditions may alter the situation somewhat. The backileld has Ken Sharpe, Bob Killian, Ed Eustice and Lee Sher- man, all seniors ... and all letter- men, Sharpe having won only an \aUa\ hat, however. Acrocls the line are Bob Davis, Bill Hill, Dick Hoffman or Bruno Schulze, Bob Baker, Stew Goldblatt, Do·ug Sling- el\iand. and Bob Hallenbeck. Optimism Is Union's Watchword On Eve Of Intramural Campaign IV . \ a:rs1ty :Settling Runners Down Tomor1·ow's scrimmage should show just what Union has to offer for this season. Unio-n men will cress this tlngers and hope that it proves Union has a lot to offer and they also should hold their breaths and hope that it will not repeat the disaster of the \bloody Saturday\ ~c:crimmage of three years ago, when half the team hobbled off from the dlill on crutC'I\es. That was the ses- sion which finished the football ca- reer of Jimmy Mulcare and put Little Billy Thomas on the side- lines for half the season. Blocking of linemen has had Coach Lawrence worried this week. The lads don't stay with their men, he finds. Some key men have yet to get their assignments down pat. However, the backs have looked exceptionat:y good and the line does well on defense and fair on the attack. Several of the men, who go nameless necessarily, have been loa::lng a bit on the job, according to the staff. Two of the best varsity backs have missed much of this week's work because of injuries. Sherry Hillick, who'll alternate with En- stice, has been forced out by a heavy cold and was given Wednes- day and yesterday off. Lee Sher- man is still suffering conside1·ably from a heel bruise. Otherwise the physical condition of the squad is still excellent <tfter two weeks of hard practice. -----0- ---- Lacrosse Practice Begins Monday Phi Cams Predict They~ll Win Easily ffn Touch Football <Continued from Page 4) games with Phi Delta TheLa and is looking for a good season, though it lost Gordon Parker and Ed lA.' a! d.

Wednesday the varsity runners ground out 6 2 miles for Taskmas- ter Bill Ketz ... and liked it, for the most part. That was their longest trek since practice started last week. Behind Conly on the team at this point are Charley Snell, who, like Conly, is a junior; Holt Sturges, Bob Shepperd, Herb Adams Hard- ing Brown and Bob Reed. Team balance this year may be good. Balance is that space of time separating the first and last man on the team in a race. Less than a I minute separated the first four men in drills this week. By having team balance, a squad of average run- ners can often beat a team. which has one outstandio1g individual star and a group of mediocre har- riers. ---,0--- JACKPOT ON THE AIR MONDAY The Two in One Shirt At last, here's a d()uble duty shirt that • • serves you equally well as a sports shirt or as a regular shirt.

They are our fratemity brothers, our dormitmy room-mates, and our friends. 1Iany of them are forced to leave practice eal'ly so that they 1nay join others on the campus who are working- for board by \\'Hit- ing on table or washing dishes. Football is no more pl'ivileged an activity than this newspaper, or the Glee Club, or the :\Iountebanks. Practice starts eal'ly and lasts late. It started nineteen days ago when most of us were just beginning to come out of the lazy vacation haze. Well over twenty p1·actices have been held. They have been no pink teas. The team wants none. It realizes that stiff workouts are the on!~· means whereby Union can face its heavy schedule. Sp1·ing practice was held last year and was attended by most of this yea1·'s squad. Every attempt has been made to develop a strong, winning· outfit through conscientious coach- ing by Art Lawrence assisted by Ralph Sem- erad, and through effective leade1·ship by Bob Baker. We cannot \\Tite our friends that we are \three deep in every position, have a team that is bound to be great, led by sure All- Americans\ in spite of these efforts. Such pre-season golden days are rare for truly amateur college teams. We can be sure that these efforts by Law- rence, Semerad and Bakel' will p1·oduce a clean playing, hard fighting team that 1·eally represents Union and will never let her down. Coaches and players ask for nothing in re- turn for this assurance; it is their job, and they are happy to perform it in the lmowl- edge that the spirit of an entire campus is backing them to the hilt, fl'Om seniors right through freshmen. But the football team has had no oppol'- tunity to see a mass demonstration of this spirit thus far this year. Let's show the spirit behind the 1941 Union football team by seeing the boys off Friday \vhen they leave for Hartford to play Trinity in what may be the stiffest game of the year. Let's have a real rally then, to show Art, Ralph, Bob, Ed Enstice, Lee Sherman, Abe Dorsman, Bob Davis, Red Killian and the rest of the gang that there are seven hun- dred sixty-five men who want Union to \Beat Trinity' 'this Saturday afternoon. SENIOR DANCE OCTOBER 25? Union suffet~s a scarcity of social func- tions. That fact has been clearly demon- &tl·ated too many times. The need for social activity is most pressing of all times during the football season, in which no college dances are scheduled until the final home game with Rochester. Union students have generally had to be satisfied with \hit or miss\ forms of entertainment following foot- ball games, which has certainly been a factor forcing week-end migrations from the cam- pus. It has been proved that class dances, as indicated by the spirit they have aroused, in past years, are one of the essentials for the development of both class and college con- the gang· sought to brace them- selves clearly indicated that they sciousness here. These class dances are· were college men. scheduled for freshman and sophomore Members of the freshman class have pointed out that '45 last paint- yenor::>, with the trad•itional Junior Prom ed The Idol and campus gossip l'ounding out the third year. For the last, seem,; to have linked the uppei- clasemen of one house or the sopho- and probably most significant year of college, mores to the deed. there, however, is no class dance. A member of an off campus fra- ternity reported that a sophomore The Union-R. P.

It is no more than pro- to library field where it would be set up. priety for the student body to reciprocate Another upperclassman, a Hale the invitations issued by Rensselaer last year House neutral, accused a certain n<>arby fraternity of the deed. to members of this student body to attend its In terfra temi ty Ball. On the da1·ker side of the Union-RPI pic- tme are the flare-ups behveen the students of the two institutions: the sort of incidents which almost forced breaking off athletic relations between the two institutions. Some form of cooperation beyond the gridiron clash is clearly desirable for the two student bodies-even imperative. An informal Senior Dance on the evening of October 25, following the R. P. I. game would seem a solution to all these problems. The Alumni Gymnasium might be secured from 9 to 1. Several R. P. I. groups might be invited as guests of honor. Union fraternities with R. P. I. chapters might invite their brethren for buffet suppers. The senior class could decor- ate the gym and secure an inexpensive or- chestra in much the same style as it has in past Freshman and Sophomore Dances. Such a venture, to be successful, would have to be an affair of \all-out\ Union hos- pitality and would require co-operation from all campus groups. It might be possible to carry to a logical conclusion the attempt to do away with tickets made in last year's Glee Club dance. These tickets can be replaced with contributions from the campus' social groups, which would be given blanket tickets, or several individual tickets. Such a function seems a worthwhile idea for completing the chain of class dances, for improving of campus social opportunity, and for implementing Union-RPI relations. What does the student body, and, more p2rticular- ly, the Senior class, think? * * * What The Idol was pulled down for this column does not know nor can it guess. One suggestion made was that the whole gang was a little high, .felt full of false courage and decided to pull down the statue. The empty wine jug supported this theory. View of fhe Administration We understand that the Adminis- tration will take no notice of the overturning. This seems> to us to be a wise move. It is such things as the Idol burn- ing and overturning that make life on this campus interesting. 0 Condition \Not Too Good\ Rufus Burlingame, '44. underwent an appendectomy Saturday at an Albany hospital after becoming ill at the Kappa Alpha house Friday night.

The most gratifying thing of the whole afternoon was when his guitar player, Bobby Hackett, picked up his cornet to play. He held forth for only one chorus. In our opinion Bobby is> one of the greatest men with a horn in the country. Why does Miller only al- low him to take a few bars on his own? That same evening we made our way backstage in Proctor's theatre to watch the .proceedings from be- hind, having already viewed it from the front. There was the usual racket and this columnist found himeelf pushed out of the way from time to time by the leader of the alleged greatest swing band in the country. We are undecided as to whether we can call this a privi- lege. There are doubtlessly some people who would en.joy it. Luckily we proved our sophistication by not asking for autographs and were not thrown out.

Worth Answering DESECRATION OF THE IDOL Buming and overturning Union's tradi- tional Idol is an act of stUpid, wanton de- struction that is both contrary to the spirit of the college and to the sentiment of its stu- dents. Those who do answer it, will be welcomed by the staff into the journalistic fraternity that is The Concordiensis, or any daily or weekly newspaper. For many, many years inter-class rivalry has surged around the Idol. The ve1·y fact that never once has any large group seen fit to damage the stone figure is symbolic of the spirit this institution tries to foster: that of keen competition which leaves no destruction in its wake. The action on the Idol might have been 1 considered clever somewhere else; we do not want that sort of thing here. If college stu- dents attempted to start inter-class rivalry off on this sour note, they should be made to pay sharply; if people not connected with the college are responsible, the college should either take .steps against them, or should make provision against the recurrence of such an incident. An apology is the least that can be ex- pected from the perpetrators of such an in- cident. They will be trained in news and sports writing, in the tech- nic of taking news pictures and developing them. In their senior year they will have the chance to be one of the top executives on the campus for which they will receive a salary, a key and free subscriptions.

The cheerleaders can stHl get their sweaters cleaned. Freshmen have plenty of time to get some wooden outhouses together for a blaze on council field and pick out their best pair of pajamas for the trip downtown. * • Art Lawrence and Bob Baker might still have time to polish up on a few informal words. * • Schenectady Police may yet have time to make arrangements for handling traffic tie-ups which the rally would surely cause on State street . . . but we hope not. Tony might have time to stock up on some extra beer for· returning rally- ers ... we HOPE so! * * Anyway, lets think a bit about a pep rally. It can be one H- of a lot of fun! * * Did you know that Al Ciampa requil,es his freshman footballers to shave before they can practice these days? He says it's the best they can do. Have you seen John Alden running with the freshman country squad? He is. • * Some time today Jackpot hopes to see Art Lawrence and com.pare notes on what it's like to face a microphone. Many students heard Art when he took the air with Roy Shudt over WTRY last Friday. Not so many heard Jackpot in his debut over the campus UBS last night and maybe it was just as well. Jackpot found it harrowing, so what must it have been for the listeners? * * Saturday morning reports be- gan to trickle in that all was not so hotsy totsy at the gym. AI Ci- ampa was said to have that angry glint in his eye and was looking for a sportswriter. Naturally that sportswriter has made himself scarce ever since. Ciampa didn't like having Bill Lynn referred to as assistant freshman football coach. Lynn, we must point out, is not an official member of the coaching staff and is only helping temporarily. Nevertheless, he is currently the assistant freehman football coach. * * • It's a good freshman cross-coun- try team that Coach Bill Ketz is drilling- these days. We know that there are those who are becoming tired of the annual bright report on freshman harrier prospects, but these look really good. Ketz says that they could be the best all- around crew he has had. But they haven't been out long and may turn out to be only a flash in the pan. Those four meets on the schedule will tell soon enough. ---0 INTRA::MURAL TENNIS Firm-round tennis matches in the intramural tournament must be played off by Friday.

GRAUBART The Jay Street Jev:e/er 166 JAY STREET IT' atch and Jewelry Re pairi11g a Specialty PARKER & SHEAFFER PENS Dutchmen Expect· Stiff Opposition By Hartford Team Plenty Replacements, Experienced Regulars Present on Both Squads Trinity field ,in Hartford, Con- necticut, will :be the first proving ground for Art Lawrence's first varsity football machine at Union next Saturday, and Mechanic Law- rence and his \helper Ralph Sem- erad, are devoting this final week of production to the fine adjust- ment and lubrication of the newly assembled Gat·net outfit. Like all adequate proving grounds-, the one at Hartford is ex- pected to be sufficiently stiff to try the Dutchmen to the utmost. In fact, it would not at all be amiss to s-peculate that, in the event of a successful Hartford test, Union's football stock is due for a sudden rise. Davis Bacl• It's still a bit early to expect predictions from the immediate camp of the Dutchmen, but assem- bling the Garnet machine that will take the field on Saturday is just about complete. Bob Davis, last year's jaw injury behind him, is back with more speed than ever on his end-around specialty. Bob Hallenbeck is likely to be his run- ning-mate on the other flank. Bill Hill and Doug Slingerland form a pair of hefty tackles, with Abe Dorsman, Bundy Shaw and Johnny Adamzevich as adequate replace- ments. Two guards will be picked from the quartet of Bruno Schulze, highly-touted sophomore, Stew Goldblatt, Dick Hoffman, and Clark Albertso, with the first two mentioned likely to get the nod. The center of the line will .be as- signed to a gentleman named Bak- er and Union's captain is expected to welcome his old pivot job back after a year of guard duty. His booming tackles and keen pass de- fense are a familiar and welcome sight to Union fans again this year. So, Lawrence's forward line, with plenty of replacements in every po- sition, plenty of power off the tackles, and more than a little ex- perience, should acquit itself nobly. As to the backfield, the Garnet seems to be pretty well situated there aso well. An experienced quar- tet consisting- of Lee Sherman, Ed Enstice, Ken Sharpe and Bob Kil- lian, backed up by some excellent sophomore reservists, make Sem- erad's worries fade perceptibly. Sherman, Tail-Back Sherman, last year's alternate blocking back, has taken over his new tail-back duties well, and his replacement, Sophomore Bruce Burns, has shown to be an excep- tionally hard runner. Ed Enstice, at the Num•ber Three spot has plenty of experience and his run- ning and passing were familiar to all Union spectators at the close of last season. Ed Green, his re- placement has shown up well as a passoer, while his running has im- proved. Ken Sharpe, junior signal caller, and Robert <Red) Killian round out this first backfield. Kil- lian particularly, has been utilizing his speed to great advantage on reverses. Karl Ktarman and Walt Galuska, also up from the yearling squad of last year, are likely to see plenty of action as the cam- paign progresses. As for Trinity, prospects there are too good to give the Dutch- men any degree of comfort. Seven lettermen, boJste\·ed robustly by the best of an undefeated freshman team of last fall, bring smiles to the face of Coach Dan Pessee, starting his eighth year at the helm of Trinity's football destinies. Optimism at the Hartford insti- tution is based mostly upon the ex- pected performances of such men as Joe Beidler, triple-threat back- field ace, backed up by a superla- tive color combination of Bill Black and Paul White, which trio figures to take most of the \blue\ out of Trinity's traditional colors.

LEE .SHER.M/1/'J Bictured above is big Lee Sher- man, former blocking back, who is counted upon heavily by Al-t Lawrence this year as. a ball carrier. A persiatent foot injury has hampered the big senior in worlwuts this fall, and just how much he will be able to play is unknown. The situation is made particularly acute by the fact that Bruce Burns., Sherman's sophomore replacement, will be unable to play in road games, due to eligibility rulings. Dick Conly is stiU considerably out front in the varsity picture. His running has ,been consistent and he seems to be living up to all Coach Ketz expected of him. Two other runners seem to be a Httle above last year's standard. They are Charley Snell and Bob She.pherd. The latter has been do- ing the best running of his career for the pa~t week. Holt Sturges has also been coming along fairly well, but he is ineligible for out-of-town runs. Promising Quartet Four freshman runners are es- pecially o1:1tstanding. They reeled off a smooth 3.5 mile time trial yesterday afternoon, finishing up with something to spare. Two of the prospects are former Nott Terrace High runners. They are Jim Quinlan and Chuck Gade. Big Ken White and George Middle- mis-s were the other two members of the quartet. Both looked very good yesterday. Lawsing Rosekrans and John Alden also show signs of promise. Phi Gamma Freshman Explains Overconfident Intramural Forecast While thumbing through the~--------------­ mail the other morning, the man- Delta in a poor light with my cocky aging editor came across a start- assertions and suggest that, in the ling communique from a freshman future, you ask the advice of some- in Phi Gamma Delta. one who is in a better position than Avid readers of the Concordy will a freshman to speak for the house. recall the preview of intramural touch football which was run last Sincerely, Friday. It excited considerable comment. This particular comment from Phi Gamma Delta was, how- ever, unexpected and unprece- dented. Friday the Concordy quoted a Phi Gamma Delta spokesman to the effect that- \We (P. G. D.) will win again easily. We have one of our best teams and shouldn't find any op- position. Only today we walked all over D. U. in a practice game ... \ Judging· from the report, the Phi Gams were slightly confident Thus, it was a rude surprise to receive the following letter: \Editor The Concordiensis Dear Sir: It is my sincere wisoh that you publish in your next issue my apol- ogies to the fraternities and dor- mitories in the intramural league for my unauthorized announcement that Phi Gamma Delta will win this year's football tournament 'easily.' The head of the house and brothers were attending regular Thursday night meeting, so had no knowledge of the telephone call, or of my answer to it until the Con- cordiensis came out tonight. I re- gret having placed Phi Gamma best guards in New England in chunky AI Will. Trinity lost only to strong teams from Weslyan and R. P. I. last year, and the general opinion in the Blue and Gold.'s headquarters is that the Hilltoppers will get off on the right foot again this year at the expense of the visiting Dutchmen. Union holds the edge in the short series between the two teams, however, having won five of nine encounters, while tying one. That one tie, it will be re- membered, came as the only mar in the undefeated Union season in 1939. It will be a stiff test for the Garnet, but a stiff test, if success- ful, is sometimes the besot way to begin a new season, and such is the hope in the Dutchmen's camp this week. Freshmen··· Spencer Gowrie, Jr.\ Naturally, the staff was sorry to hea1· that the freshman had regret- ted giving an interview. The staff was also sorry to hear that Phi Gamma Delta had apparently changed its mind about winning the tournament again. The Concordiensois has always re- garded Phi Gamma Delta as the ideal and supreme example of ath- letic strength and it is a keen dis- appointment to learn that there may be some doubt about it. Mr. Gowrie, you and your com- rades may rest assured that you owe no ·one any apologies for your statement. It is fine to be confident and really not so very bad to ,be cocky. Just be sure you live up to everything you said about your- selves when you appear on the ath- letic field. You got off on the right foot yesterday. ---0--- Yearling Gridders Have Contact Drill Freshman football candidates put in a slightly rougher drill Satur- day afternoon. Putting on the big, white block- ing pads, one team acted as the defense against plays run by an- other team. It was :;tn :otctive ses- soion for the linemen and offensive backs. With nearly three weeks remain- ing before the opening game, the cubs still have a lot to learn. They are sotill slow and haven't gotten their play& as yet. If he can uncover an outstanding back to perform behind what shapes up like a good line, Coach Ciampa should put forth the best frosh team in three years.

Intramural touch football rolled off to a smooth start yesterday with not a s>ingle upset. There were four games, and all were dose, ,but the favorites triumphed in each case. Defending Champion Phi Gamma Delta clicked off a 13-6 victory over Sigma Chi. The downtowners put on a surprising show of resistance and the Fijis spent one or two anx- ious .moments. Delta Upsilon outgained Delta Chi in the overtime period of a game which ended in a scoreless tie at the end of the regular play- ing route. The D. U.'s completed three passes in the overtime and had gained the greatest amount of ground at the end, so were award· ed the decision, though there was still no score. Beta Theta Pi took advantage of several lapses by Sigma Phi's de- fense to win, 9-0. The Sigs man- aged to catch a Beta pass behind their own goal line to count up a safety against themselves. Then they suffered a let-down in pass defense which the Betas quickly took advantage of, scoring a touch- down and sending Ned Reilly a pass for the extra point. Psi Upsilon's juggernaut squeezed out a narrow victory over Delta Phi in the closest game of opening day. The Psiclones won, 7-6, after a tough battle. Commissioner Ketz has an- nounced the schedule for the rest of the week. It follows: <Field No. 1 is at the south end of Library field; Field 2 at the North end; Field 3 at the south end of Graduate Council field and Field 4 at the north end of Graduate Council field.)

Production plans call for the presentation of \Outward Bmmd\ in early Decem-· ber. No director has as yet been an- nounced but the organization plans to follow its usual custom of im- porting a well known stage director to handle the show. In former years such Broadway directors as Bertram Harrison, Miriam Doyle, Camille Staneska and the former faculty advisor, Edwa1 d Carroll, '27, have directed plays. The Irish play, \The Playboy of the Westsrn World\ by John Synge will be given in the early spring. Since there will be no third pro- duction, the prom play will be dl·op- ped. For many years the Abbey Players of Dublin have presented \The Playboy of the Western World\ in New York City as part of their Irish repertory. Join Executive Committee New additions to the executive committee of the Mountebanks are Edward P. Fliegel, '42, and Norman Fenster, '43. Fliegel succeeds James Hamilton Young, '42, as Business Manager. Robert Bishop, '43, was named Assistant Business Manager in charge of publicity. Besides the above two, other members of the executive committee include, Har- old Hendricltson, '42, President; Robert Dressel, '44, Secretary; Abe Bakel, '42, Production Manager Stanley Green, '43; Joseph Heaney, '42, Donald Houghton, '43, Wallace Morgan, '44, and Mr. Gordon Rust, Faculty Advisor. Stanley Green will design the scenery for \Outward Bound.\ Green last designed the scenery for \Three Men on a Horse\ given as the final play last year. Wallace Morgan will be stage manager and Robert Dressel, assistant electri- cian. Hendrickson reported a good freshman turnout but asked all Union students interested in the acting, technical or business side of the Mountebanks to come out for the organization or for the first play. Subseription Campaign Because uf a cut in the amount of money received from the student tax, the Mountebanks will conduct an especially intensive subscription eampaign starting next Monday. Through their subscription cam- paign they hope to offset the loss of tax money, Busine::s Manager Fliegel explained. He announced that the wives of faculty members will help the organization in their drive which will be directed at Schenectadians. Subscriptions to the two plays and to the Mounte- banks movie series will be sold for the usual price of five dollars. No tour is planned this year. Last year the Mountebanks took \Tbe Inspectf~r General\ on an ex- tensive tour of upstate New York during their spring vacation. Plans made for the Mountebanks movie series indicate a definite turning away from the traditional productions. They will be given on eight consecutive Monday eve- nings at 8 p. m. The series will start after the return of the col· lege students from their Christmas vacation. A serial much like the \Pearls of Pauline\ will be given as a binding factor. ----0---- Freshman Meeting Monday Andrew E. Reilly, Jr., '42, chair- man of the Freshmen Orientation Committee announced that an im- portant meeting of the class of '45 will be held Monday in the Old Chapel at 10. The freshman elec- tion proceedure· will be explained by Robert K. Killian, President of the Student Body. this fall, beginning with their opener against Trinity Saturday. Beyond all this, I hope tha-t you members of the student body will give the team the I 00 per cent support they deserve from the outset to ihe end of +he season. Yours is a great small college. You of the team, give it your best and you followers, give these representatives the credit and aid they deserve. As Union's most interested alumnus, I shall follow you all very closely and now wish each of you the best of luck. Sincerely, Nels Nitchman The student body of the college will see off Union's foot- ball team tonight at b:45 p. m. at the gymnasium. All freshmen must be present. Cheerleaders .under the direction of John Baas, '42, will lead victory yells for the meeting, while Edward Schulze, '42, will conduct singing of college songs. 1 Lehigh Admissi,ons Plan Adopted Here Order Covers Materials Needed to Make Vital Repairs, Hoadley Says Union College, as a result of its sta~us as an \educational institu- tion,.\ has been granted an \A-10\ ; pnfE>rence rating by the office of ~ product·ion management, for any 1 \materials required for repairs I needed because of an actual or im-1 minent breakdown of its prap- l erty or equipment,\ it was an- nounced· today by Comptt·olle-1· An- thony Hoadley.

Two Performances Planned Of Verdi's Famous Opera At Mt. Pleasant Oct. 23 \Rigoletto the famous opera by Guiseppi Verdi, will be presented at the Mont Pleasant High School Auditorium on Thursday, October 23, under the auspices of the Union College Glee Club. W. James Still- man, '42, will be general chairman of the presentation for the Glee Club. The opera, which is slightly shorter than the usual opera, is given as part of a double bill but in the ease of the Union perform- ance will be given alone. The American Civic Opera Company will give the complete perform- ance. They will bring their own orchestra, their own singers, cos- tumes and stage settings. The Glee Club will take no part in the performance but will merely act as the Schenectady agency. The opera company will also give per- formances in Troy and Albany be- fore coming here. To Be Given Twice There will ·be two performances. An afternoon matin.ee will be given at 3:30 p. m., for both grammer and high school students. They will be charged but twenty cents admission. The second and main performance will be given at 8:30 in the evening. Union men, high school students and Skidmore girls will be admitted for fifty cents plus tax. General admission for Schenectadians will be a $1.00 and $1.50. This includes tax. The $1.65 seats will he reserved and the $1.10 section will be the general admission. Seats there will be had under the first come, first served policy used by the Glee Club in its chapel concerts. The fifty cent stu- dent tickets will entitle holders to seats in the general admission sec- tions. Stillman pointed out that the Glee ·Club is setting up a new or- ganization to handle its concert performances. \The ·business man- ager usually is too busy to handle the concert, or what ever we do present, in addition to his regular duties,\ he said. \Leonard Bull, '39, when he wa.s manager, found it al- most impossible to handle the Du- pres concert we gave then. Assistants to Be Trained \When we decided last year to present our concert we had a mem- ber of the Glee Club other than the manager handle the show. This year we have furthered his organ- ization to provide for two assistant chairmen, who will be trained to succeed the present chairman. We hope to teach them the tricks of the game so that they will not be bothered by the usual headaches that concerts cause. They will be helped by a six man committee, each member of which will handle a separate phase of the organiza- tional work.\ StU!maJ;J, ~k!? al! junior, sopho- more and freshmen members of the Glee Club interested in man- agerial concert work to see him as soon as possible. The opera is being sponsored by the Glee Club as a cultural contri\ bution to the life of Schenectady rather than a profit making affair, Dr. Elmer A. Tidmarsh, faculty director of the organization, said, in explaining the club's connection with the presentation. He pointed out that most peo- ple in Schenectady ha.d very little chance to see opera. Their concep- tion of it from hearing just the music on the radio was naturally faulty, and he believed that the Glee Club will have rendered the audience which will see it a great service because they will be able to tie up the acting, the natural action of the opera, with the mu- sic. The opera company will pro- vide a narrator to explain the ac- tion which is quite involved. Dr. Tidmarsh said. Although Dr. Tidmarsh knew lit- tle of the company, he believed that it was excellent for such a small one. \I know some of the singers and the fine work they do,\ he said, indicating that it was the reputation of many of the or- ganization's singers that decided him in favor of the opera com- pany.

Every student in the college who can pos .. sibly make it should be there-and that does not mean freshmen or students living on the campus only. There are seven hun- dred sixty-eight men in this college, some of whom do not live on the campus. It is their business to come to this rally too.

The story of the sheep on Dr. Danton's porch is famous. That incident, we believe, occured in 1937.

The Interfraternity Council sponsors the fiTst of the campus' two large social func- tions, which is thereby known as \Interfra- ternity Ball.\ It has also, during- the past few years, performed various and sund.ry tasks which have diminished in frequenc;-.r, intensity and ambition as time passed. ..!.

The present state of the Council is clearly not what was intended in 1937 when it was first org-anized. The deterioration of lnterfratemity Coun- cil becomes all the more serious in times like these when means of fraternity coope1·ation are needed in forms ranging from sugges- tions on meal planning to discussion of rush- ing programs. What is the matter with Union's fratemal governing body'? Why has it, in fom short years, become almost meaningless in pur- pose'? 'The Matter, 1. There is almost no continuity of mem- bership on the Interfraternity Council. From the 1938-39 group, but one man carried over to the 1939-40 body. Not a single student who sat on the 1939-40 Interfraternity Coun- cil was a member of the group during its 1940-41 sessions. This complete lack of continuity becomes all the more striking in view of the fact that the .fiscal ye:;tr of the Council is the same as the academic year: that is, membership on the Council extends from September to June. This means that in September of 1939, the Council organized with eighteen men, but one of whom had ever been a member, and pre- sumably but one of whom had ever attended a meeting. In September of 1940 Interfra- ternity Council organized seventeen men, not one of whom had been a member before, and, we may safely assume, not one of whom had any particular notion of the procedure of the group. Each Council was forced to start all over again from the organizational standpoint. Were this procedure to be followed in muni- cipal, state, or national government, the chaos that would result may be readily im- agined. Why, then, should we expect results from such a system here on the campus? 2. The \power to do\ of the Interfrater- nity Council has never been clearly defined. Beyond a jurisdictional dispute with the Stu- dent Council three years ago, the result of which was the Interfraternity Ball, there has been no definition of the limits of the powers of the two groups. With the Student Council doing a good job of adding to its campu::; cedures. 5. The fifth flaw in Interfraternity Coun- cil is one that is more a result of the other four, than a fault in its own right. Leader- ship and interested membership have been at a minimum. Men have attended meeting-s- when they have attended them-merely for the sake of adding a \present\ check after their names. Suggested Remedy 1. Membership on the Interfraternity Council should extend from one academic year to another: that is, men should sit on the Council from one l\larch to another, or one February to another. This would help to prevent the lack of continuity that has plag-ued interfraternity organization here. 2. That the \power to do\ of Interfrater- nity Council has not been defined is the fault of no one; on a campus of eight hundred men it is not possible to lay down certain rules and state solemnly that those rules are the \power to do\ of the group. These powers can only develop by a process of trial and error, which process certainly has not been attempted in the case of the Interfraternity Council. To find out whethe1· or not it can do a thing, the Council must first try to do it. Its \powet· to do\ would be quickly and sen- sibly developed as an aftermath to such ac- tion. 3. Institutionalizing- procedure of Interfra- ternity Council is no difficult job. If the Council were to follow closely the successful experiment of the Student Council, a great step forward would be taken: .Mimeographed meeting t·epol·ts could be sent to members, a representative Executive Committee elected, and committees appointed. 4. The Interfratemity Council could do what it is supposed to do-consider questions of commodity prices, rushing cooperation, Last week the National Sports Equipment Co., of 366-370 Mar- quette St., Fond Du Lac, Wiscon- sin, mailed Ha:l Wittner an adver- tisement for gym suits. That was all right but they addressed their advertisement to the \Girls Phys- ical Director\ Union College. Ac- cording to the advertisement, the freshmen will find the gym suits this company makes \Action-cut for comfort,\ whatever this means. Mr. Bishop and DKE When this column tripped Bob Bishop, the ace reporter for the \Union-Star\ up (and one of the very .iew times we have ever been able to catch him in error). on the fact that there was a Delta Kappa Epsilon house here at one time, he responded by putting a correction in the afternoon daily and head- lining it \Fraternity Is 'Revived' at Union.\ Chester T. Marvin, '45, then re- ceived the following letter; from a Mr. George F. Clapp of {)0 How- ell Avenue, Larchmont, N.Y. Wrote Mr. Clapp; \My dear D. K. E., \I have often hoped I would live to see the D·KE Chapter at Union revived and I want to congratulate you on being what may be the be- ginning of this much to be desired consummation. \Here is my best wishes for your success in any undertaking and for anything you may be able to do to- wards the accomplishment of this end.

It was Dr. Johnson who first announced the DKE rushing pro- gram with a hell week in June.

It would be to the advan.tage of every fraternity on the campus Most everybody on the campus has noticed the great change and range of the Kappa Alpha cars.

His company on treks over the White Mountains, the Adiron- dacks, and the Catskills were a source of joy to us all. At North Creek, on the Gore Mountain ski trails, he tumbled around with us, other novices-joyfully and enthusi- astically. Walt was a true woods- man. His interest in conservation was far greater than that of the rest of us. The Intercollegiate Out- ing Club Association early recog- nized his ability and chose him one of their three officers. He capably administered the 'College Week ar- rangements for two successive. years. Later the Adirondack Moun- tain Club selected Walt to run John's Brook Lodge at the south end of the range trail.

He declared he'd still be there by noon tomorrow, so his choices for start- ing posts won't be definite until game time. Captain Baker will go in at cen- ter. Ends will be Bob Davis and Bob Hallenbeck, Art LeRoy or Gordon Semerad. Abe Dorsman and Doug Slingerland, Bill Hill or Bun- dy Shaw will be the tackles. At guard will be Stew Goldblatt and Dick Hoffman. Definite starters in the backfield are Ken Sharpe, quar- terback; Lee Sherman, fullback and Bob Killian, halfback. Either Sherry Hillick or Eddie Enstice will be the other halfback. Trinity's lineup is indefinite be- cause of injuries, but is expected to include seven lettermen and about four brilliant sophomores. Most likely starters fot• the Hill- toppers are Frank Fink and Dave Tyler, ends; \Red\ Viering and Frank Steers, tackles; Jack Fay and AI Will, guards and Frank Fasi, center. Probable starting backfielders are Charley Foster and Joe Beidler. ----o----- Three Harriers Battle For No. I Position Three men are fighting it out for No. 1 man on the varsity cross- country squad. Dick Conly, Bob Shepherd, and Charley Snell are turning in very close times in their trials so far. The problem is to find two other eligible men to round out a group of five men who will form a well-balanced squad. Bob Reed, \Schnozzle\ Brown, and Herb Adams are working hard in an effort to improve before the first meet. Dave Van Dyke and Holt Sturges are ineligible for away meets, which is another headache for Mentor Ketz. A darkhorse named Viglielmo .\'eerns to be shap- ing up well and may show his feet to others when he gets into shape. A time trial was held this after- noon over the 4.7 mile route which is used for varsity races. Ketz ex- pects the harriers to turn in better times later on, but he is still much concerned over the performance of the squad as he is seeking a well- balanced team. Several other men who are work- ing hard are Dandareau, McNulty, and Smith, but they have not shown too much in the early work- outs. Call Ball and Ball Will Call Maybe the selections of the astute members of the athletic department will ·help you in maldng your choices in the Concordy football contest.

This comes about because Captain-Elect Paul Quinn hasn't come out for the team. Frosh Gridders Still Need Speed Lamenting the lack of speed in his backfield, Freshman Football Coach AI Ciampa said that he looked for a strong defense from his freshman team. The line, which will average about 185 pounds, is expected to be the lifeline of the squad. Although a group of 35 men are out for the tea:m, only 12 of them have had previous experience. The first hard scrimmage which will be held next week will tell more about the prospects of the team, he indicated. With a good group of line reserves already on hand, Ciampa is attempting to develop the _lightweight backs who run, in some cases, slower than some of the beef trust in the line. However, Columbia AI hinte.d that he might have a dark horse or two before the opening game, which would surprise no one. He also said that he had a back \who could beat any footballer in a 50-yard dash br 20 yards.\ F•·eshman Cross-Countl\y Bill Ketz, who handles the af- fairs of the fre~hman haniers, is highly optimistic about their chances this fall. Time trials indi- cate that he has a fairly well-bal- anced squad. \Chuck\ Gade and Jim Quinlan, formerly on the crack Nott Ter- race team, George Middlemiss, Ken White, and Lawsing Rosecrans will form a strong quintet which should show up well against their oppon- ants.

In what have already· come to be called \the good old days\ the 'i:>ha·nces are that nothing would have happened. But those days, you may unde1·stand, are gene, at least ·for the academic year 1941-42. When Joe and his predecessors for the past niBe years missed classes, it was eBtirely up ta the professors of those classes to de- cide what, if anything was to be dane about it. Sometimes an in-. structor kept attendance, some- times he didn't. Sometimes he look- ed at hiti clatis buuk after he had filled it in, often he ignored it. The result, as any upperclassman will tell you, was simply that many a student stayed away from one or mure of his classes fur wcekti at a time. Saturdar classes became al- most farcical. It ·began to be diffi- cult to know whom tu call up fu1 tomorrow's a\signmcnt since one wasn't sure just who was in the class and who wasn't.

In an interview yesterday, Dean Garis explained that only two days' absence reports had been filled, and that thPse could hardly be E>xpected to give an accurate picture of the effects of the new system on class absences. The Dean pointed out that this system was used up to about 1933, when it was dropped in favor of the \leave it to the professor\ sys- tem. -\·---o-~- FRESHMEN Cli:EERLEADERS F1 eshmen interested in cheer leading are asked to contact John Bass, '42. at the Psi U house.

Then they greased the lowe>r part of the pole and tied the halyard into a knot fifteen feet from wherP the pole enters the state base. The college ground crew re- moved the grease with gasoline and took down the ·banner next morning. Members of the crew said that the sophomores must have useJ a long extension lad- ,:er to t·eacn as high on the pole as they did. They doubted that the ladders kept in the steam plant were taken.

The primary consideration in such cases, however, is that there must be a shortage in the occupation for which the deferred student is pre- paring. Under the new procedure a stu- dent who had completed half a quarter of his college year, for in- stance, when he was called up for military service, could obtain post- ponement from his local draft board until the end of the quarter. This same provision applies to any other fraction of a college term. However, selective-service head- quarters said that if a student knew in advance that he was scheduled to be inducted shortly after the school period opened he could not expect a postponement. It was suggested that he could either enter the Army immediately by volunteering or else remain out of school until time for induction. -~-o Hospital Bulletin Doug Everett, '45, an Alpha Delt. returned Tuesday from the hospital following an appendicitis scare.

Citing the fifteenth chapter of the Gospel according to St. John, to answer his query which has been pondered upon extensively by great thinkers of antiquity down to George B. Shaw and H. G. Wells, Bishop Old- ham said of Jesus, \He knew he came from God and went to God, and so took a towel and girded himself, conscious of his sacred duty to serve-and washed the feet of his followers.\ If men had faith that \man was made in the image of God\ he would not sink to serving as can- non fodder or mere tools of dicta- torship.

Subscriptions This Week Plans for the Mountebanks in- tensive subscription campaign are expected to be put into effect this week. The subscription campaign, which was made necessary by the reduction in the student tax allot- ment granted last spring, is intend- ed to offset this loss and make possible a program which will ap- proach in quality that of last year. As has been the custom in previ- ous years, the campaign will offer tickets to all Mountebanks plays, as well as the motion picture se- ries described above, for the price of five dollars. As a further move toward econ- omy, the Mountebanks plan no tour this year like that of last year's \Inspector General\ production. This tour took the organization through a number of upstate New York communities during the spring vacation. The Mountebanks undertook these voluntary economy moves in anticipation of the decrease in stu- dent tax money av~ilable to all stu- dent organizations this year. Tractor Thieves Not Concordy Men Seward Place residents, disturbed by the running of the \levelor-trac- tor\ left in the pasture, called the Schenectady Police early Sunday morning-. The police failed to catch the marauders but piclted up two Concordiensis staff members and three Sigma Phis, who were investi- gating the running of the tractor . The police parked their car on the road next to the Dean's house and, after turning out the lights, rushed the wall. Warned by a look- out, who realized that the police car resembled no student's car, the gang quickly shut off the tractor and beat the police to North Col- lege, escaping through the rear door. Concordi Investigates Told early Saturday evening that a gang would run the tractor around once, Solomon Blechman, 42, Managing Editor of The Concor- diensis, Jonathan Pearson, '42, Sports Editor, accompanied by Ar- thur Yeates, '44, Peter Sharpe, '44 and Bruce Gillies, '44, drove to the spot to investigate a possible news story. The police watched them ar- rive, drive to the Nott Street gate where they had been told the oper- ations would go on, turn around and drive back to North College. Yeates and Pearson discovered the tractor in mid-field, motor still warm. While the inquirers were gathered around inspecting the tractor, the police flashed their lights on the party and ordered them from the field. Agreeing with the party that they had not driven the tractor, the po- lice toolt the names of the five for possible \further action.\ There wHI be no need of formal speeches, since a good general knowledge of the field under dis- cussion will be ample. The deci- sion will be made on a point scor- ing basis, as opposed to the old \won\ and \lost\ system of formal debating-. The points will be kept througnout the program and will decide the winner. The finals will be held in a program much in the manner used ,by the athle- tic department for its contests. The winner will receive the cup now on display in the library. The topic outlined will be used throughout the year. The bulletin board contains a complete bibliog- raphy on the topic. Use of this suggested material should provide an excellent chance to brush up on forgotten material. 'D(\fens<:'>' Is Topic The topic: \Is Our National De- fen::;e Effort Adequate?\ 1. How effective is the adminis- trative organization. 2. Are we making the best uses of our economic resources. 3. Are the essential values of our democracy being endangered. The sub-topics are pointed for discussion on the make-up and efficiency of the various govern- ment boards, from the O.P.A.M. and O.P.A.C.S. to the priorities board. Since these treat questions with which the national govern- ment is now vitally interested, they are particularly timely for debat- ing, it was pointed out by Melville Messenger of the club. Under the second topic would come the vital aspects of the labor monopoly, in- flation, consumer, and allied situa- tions dealing with questions feeling the pressure of the national defense program. Finally there will be an open discussion on the effects of this program on democracy now and in the near future.

The membership of the club is as yet unknown, although Giant fans have been attempting to find the persons responsible for the birth of this group. They expect the demise of this club by late Sat- urday afternoon, which corresponds to the day when the fourth game of the series will be played. How- ever, a constructive program has been prepared by the Durocher backers, for a copy of the citation to be awarded him was found in the Concordy office early yesterday evening. The citation reads: Lippy Leo Durocher born; schooled in educational institutions; employed as the scrappy and col- .orful manager of the Brooklyn Dodgers with all the benefits and disadvantages appertaining thereto; thorough-going liberal wringing deadly words against injustice; im- pressed with the limitless future of the spoken word, he has held to certain principles which few can expound more eloquently than he; well enlightened by the lamps of Ebbets Field, he has also enlight- ened umpires on such matters as may pertain to or preclude the wel- fare of his motley crew; manipu- lating the language so as to vio- late every interpretation of free- dom of speech, Durocher has yet walked the tight-rope of Seman- tics; generous contributer to the National League coffers by virtue of periodic retributions; achieving the distinguished nickname of Lip- . py by his excessive and violent !an- guage; now with useful originality and with the cooperation of 24 bums, Durocher has brought back the bacon to Brooklyn, by virtue of the authority invested in us by ourselves we gladly admit you to the degree of Doctor of Letters, in token whereof you will receive this basebail bat. With campus opinion divided on the outcome of the world series, The Concordiensis has undertaken the task of sampling opinion both of the faculty, and students on this \momentous\ question. Moreover, it is rumored from a very reliable source that student listening groups have been formed to follow and analyze the games play by play. The significance of this, it was pointed out, is that afternoon studying, laboratory attendance, and movies especially, will not pre- vail for the next week. It is also rumored that in view of this pro- ject, undertaken with great mass enthusiasm, that the faculty will not conduct written inquisitions of any nature, except, in some cours- es, on the psychological aspects of the fans and on the techniques of the operations in the next week. President Fox-\Although I am not e:Jepert on baseball, I pick the Brooklyn Dodgers. I'd lilte to see them win. Dr. Bronner-I'm a Giant fan. I dislike both the Dodgers and the Yanks, but I pick the Yanks in 5 games. Their offensive and defen- sive strength is far superior to the Dodgers and I think that giving them one game is a gift. Dr. Philip Stanley-The Yanks in 6 games. The whole setup of rest and a more expensive team will re- sult in the Yanks' victory . Mr. Joseph Rotunda-The Yanks will win in 5 games. The Yanks are the Yank::; and they won't lose. Dr. Larrabee-! pick the Yanks. The series will go no less than four games and no more than 7 games . I'll g-o along with the crowd . Dr. Whitaker--The Yanks in four out of seven. Dr. Stubing-The Yanks in four out of seven. \Fletcher\ Platzer-The Yanks will win with their superior batting force and their better pitching staff. They are much better as an all-around team. Mel Messenger-I'm for the Dodgers. Fitzsimmons and Davis will carry them through. I have faith in them and the Dodger's spirit . Bud Green-! think that the Yanks will win in four games. The Dodgers have no pitchers to speak of. The Yankees hitting power will overwhelm the Dodgers. Besides that, Peewee Reese is a weak link in the Dodger infield. Dr. Augustus Fox-The Yankees hitting and fielding will overcome the Dodgers. The number of double plays that they have made demon- strate the fielding ability and hence their superiority. Myron Mills-The Dodgers will win the series by all means. No one can beat this bunch of .bouncing boys. What more do you want? Their pitching staff and men like Camilli, Lavagetto, and Reiser will carry them through to victory over the Yanks.

Jack S{'hulz ,~p Cc>llege Journalism Rewards Tuesday, September 30~ 1941 \The long history of American academic journalism shows many instances of the powerful in.fluence exet'ted not only upon student read- ers but upon the national press as well by carefully considered, well written editorials in college papers. A study of American biography would show that many successful journalists and writers of pure literature served their first appren- ticeship during their under·graduate days on college publications.\ great city dailies brought by swift transportation of rail or air, the radio and the news-reels. But there survives and we hope there always will sur~ive, a curiosity as to the homely details of the neighborhood life-the visits back and forth of relatives and friends, the birthday parties, the graduation exercises, floods, the Hres, the new side- walks and the U.ke-and though the local paper will never more be the entire mental pabulum of its read- ers, it will survive as the journal of the community. .Among its other services the local paper may culti- vate an interest in local history, fostering pride in a tradition which must be understood, enriched with c1:1rrent achievement and carried EASTON, Pa.-The f.i.rst coopera- tive house to pass the planning stage has been put into operation at Lafayette. With twelve active members, who live and eat there, the house opened its doors to stu- dents this week. There have been no backers for the house, and all the work of planning had to be done last spring by several of the boys who were captivated by the idea. Where Is the Interfraternity Council? FOR A SUCCESSFUL COUNCIL YEAR TomolTOW night vvill be held the first meeting of a Student Council which has al- ready demonstrated itself to be energetic and ambitious. This energy and ambition, particularly demonstrated in the current pro- gram of Freshman 01·ientation and in the de- velopment of several new committees, are re- freshing qualities in Union student govem- ment. They give us reason to believe that Officers Killian, Dorsman, Beer and their associates may well lead the 1941-42 Student Council to a point where Union student gov- ernment can again assume the active position it should rightly occupy. Last academic year this newspaper pointed out seve1·al defects in the system of student government which it felt were serious ob- stacles to success for the Student Council. We are pleased to see that many of these de- fects have been corrected this year. There is yet remaining one serious flaw in the Council system, without the correction of which student government here can never have complete interest and participation. This flaw rests in our elective system: -X ominations are closed, and membei'R of the class for which the nominations are made have no voice in these nominations. -but 3 1/31)( of the student body elects the President of the Student Body-Chairman of the Student Council. Possible Corrections a. :\lake nominations open and permit members of a class to nominate at least a portion of the men whose names will be placed before them, as against the present system when the small Student Council group in the class above makes up the list of nominees. b. :Make more than 5/( of a student body of 768 men eligible to vote for Student Coun- cil Chairman-Student Body President. c. l\Iake times of elections known suffi- ciently early that students may arrange their schedules so as to be able to cast a vote. d. :Make public the records of all men whose names appear on the ballot so that all voters may know all those up for election. Reorganization of this elective system, is one key to a successful Council year; an- other is aggressive pursuit of plans for small social functions-like the proposed Senior Dance after the RPI game-which the cam- pus wants more than any other single ac- tivity. REJUVENATION Debate and the Philomathean Society have undergone an amazing rejuvenation on the Union campus. Two years ago intercollegiate debating on the campus was confined to the actions of approximately five men, while the Philoma- thean Society was an empty shell that met once a year to elect officers. Today we have a sizeable, active debating team \\ hich di;:;cu:;:;e~ :;eu:;iol,r, rather than argues insensibly on the l'espective merits of the several questions with which it is con- fronted. The Philomathean Society has a steady membership that may be compared with that of any activity on the campus, and considers progressively and well the topics of the day. Debating has come back on the Union campus. Latest, and most amazing step in the pro- cess of I'ejuvenation, is the program of intra- mural debate which will get underway to- night. Every fraternity and neutral group is scheduled for competition for a cup to be donated by the PhilomatheaR Society. Two years ago, campus opinion would have generally agreed that the death of debate was near. Proposal for intra-mural debate would have been laughed down. The campus has only praise for it now. Our hats are off to the men of the Philo- mathean Society. Adviser Campbell, and Executive Committee members Fisher, Fish- bone, and Messenger have done an outstand- ing job on an outstandingly difficult task. SOMETHING GOOD A very neat package of Garnet ribbons to the crowd of Union rooters who followed the team to Hartford last Saturday and equalled both the volume and spirit of the numerically far supel'ior Trinity stands. The group was hardly bothered by the fact that its l'epertoire of Union cheers was lim~ ited to the sing-song; it developed several new cheers, the like of some of which have neve1' before rooted on a Garnet team. One of the better of the cheers that were spon- taneously developed might well be included in Union's book: U-N-l-0-N rah, U-N-l-0-N rah rah, U-N-1-0-N rah rah rah, followed, somewhat vical'iously, by a \Ray Trinity.\ We remembered seeing Tom Doyle, Bob Fitzgerald, Abram 11olyneaux, Howard Ber- ger, Art Yates, Bob Carnwright, Paul Dwyer, Bill Weller, Cy Thickman, Aaron Thal, Will Lakin, George Loomis, Ned Reilly, Dick Conly, Joe Jaycox, Bob Muther, Donald Blanks, Van Thomson, Barney O'Neil, George Shell, Stan Steingut, Bob Groundwater, Stan Greenstein, Kenneth Payne. There were many others, including alumni Dick Brickley and Dick Griffith. There, too, were Profes- sors Bennett and Whitaker. Best example of the entire afternoon took place when the Garnet stands gave their valedictory to a team that had fought well by shouting, \Beat Hobart!\ Union is built around attitudes like that. LETTERS TO THE EDITOR At the other extreme, Professor Larrabee emphasized the personal satisfaction derived from his per- usal of daHy publications. Speaking of his reading to the point of ob- session, he confided: The Newspaper Habit \The newspaper habit bas long had me i111 it.s grip. I count that day lost which does not bring three or four to my attention. Yet I feel about newspapers most of the ti:me like the gambling addict who, on being chided for playing a dubious roulette wheel, replied that 'it is the only game in town'. No news- paper has ever been half good enough in my judgment, but even the WOL'St one that ever existed is worth reading-if only to reassure oneself of the undying curiosity of man about men.\ on.

There isn't much worth remembering about it except some briUiant passing. Trinity Col- lege didn't require much time to discover that it was up against a much-befuddled opponent and didn't go too far out in winning 20-0 at Hartford, Conn. It was a hot day, but the Dutch- men cooled off as soan as the open- ing whistle blew. Trinity had a back who made the Garnet line look as if it had never seen a spinner before. The Dutch- men simply couldn't nail down Pal:ll White, big sophomore who averaged seven yards per play. For the most part it was simply a case of strat- egy, however. White was picking up mast his ground by going outside tackle. If the tackles had moved out, they might have forced White inside and thereby stopped him. White Runs Wild White scored the first touchdown in the opening period when he rammed over left tackle on fourth down from the one-yard line. Later in the third period he went 11 yards through the center of the line for Trinity's third and final touchdown. The other Trinity score was made by Joe Beidler, the only senior in an otherwise saphomore backfield. He went 24 yards around right end for the score late in the first quarter. Twice Ed Eustice led the Dutch- men down inside Trinity's five yard line, but both times Union was de· nied a touchdown. Once Abe Dors- man fumbled the ball ati he was passing it to Bob Davis on an end around play, which would have been good for a touchdown, and the other time, a few moments later, Trinity tightened its pass defense and held for downs on its own five-yard line. Baker Badl;r Injured Captain Bob Baker was in- jured late in the first period and never got back in the game. Late yE'ste-rday a.ftE'moon, after exam- ining Baker's injury, Trainer Ed Fitz blasted ugly rumors that \Baoke\ was out for the season. \Why he'll play Saturday,\ Ed predicted. He explained that it was not a leg bruise or a sPinal injury as previously reported, but a. pain- fully bruised hip. Baker was still unable to walk erect yesterday. Eustice's passing was phenome- nal. He completed nine of 16 tosses in the second half alone. Union at- tempted but 11 running plays in this half, while taking to the air on 26 plays, 21 of which clicked. Union dominated the second half completely, but didn't have quite enough to score. The Garnet made eight first downs to five for Trin- ity in this half. Trinity had six first downs to three for Union in the first half. Throughout the game Union reg- istered a net gain of only 34 yards on its running plays. The blocking was non-existent. Saturday's lineups follow: Union Pos. Trinity Davis ......... LE ..........

Union might have played a bet- ter game Saturday. In fad, there seems no excuse for the poor showing the team made.

Gym Staff Guesses Right on 32 of 36 Grid Predictions With Union's undergraduate body approaching perfection almost to a man, you could hardly expect the coaching staff to make many mis- takes in its predictipns on last Sat- urday's football contests. And, b'gosh, they didn't. With four coaches calling the re- sults of nine contests apiece, there were 36 choices made, 32 of them were correct. Commissioner Bill Ketz turned in the only perfect slate. Ar·t Lawrence called a Nor- wich-Dartmouth upset that didn't happen, Hal Wittner thought Bow- doin would best Tufts, and AI Ci- ampa missed out on the California- Washington State game and the Bowdoin-Tufts contest. Incidentally, there's no truth in the rumor that freshman coach Ci- ampa picked Brown to win the Tufts-Bowdoin game, and Bowdoin to win the Williams-Middlebury game. Let's just blame it on the typesetter and forget the whole thing. The coaches were so fortunate in their picking last week that they'll probably consent willingly to being polled on the subject of this week's Concordy football contest games.

These waves will carry several yards through the air, but since the station has only a 5 watt trans- mitter, they will not travel off cam- pus. \The transmitter consists essen- tially of three parts, the osciJlator. amplifier, and modulator. The os- cillator crPates a high frequency alternating current. The amplifier magnifies sound from the micro- phones in the studJos to a volumP where it can be used by the ire~ quency alternating current in such a manner that the volume of sound controls the intensity of the high UBS Programs 640 Kilocycles Wednesday, Oct.

The American Locomotive Company has a great hammer that lands with a crushing thud on masses of metal. Through the press of defense orders the hammer is on the night as well as the day shift. During the day when the campus is astir, the faint pound, pound, pound is not aud- ible but at night it comes through the ground, up the walls of dorm and flaternity, through the bed posts and into the head. .So If you were dis· tm·bed blame Thor for the ham- mer and Uncle Sam for the noise.

Others pick it up. Soon the whole country's whistling it. It's a hit. Somebody lights up a cigarette. Likes it. Passes the word along. Soon the whole country's smoking it. It's a hit. IT'S CHESTERFIELD. The big thing that's pushing Chesterfield ahead Is the approval of smokers like yourself. Chesterfields are definitely Milder, Cooler-Smoking and Better· Tasting. They're made of the world's best cigarette tobaccos Blended just right to give you more smoking pleasure. Copyright 1941, LmcETT & MYEns ToBAcco Co, But even these facts wouldn't count If smokers didn't just naturally like them. Once a smoker finds out from Chesterfield What real smoking pleasure is, nothing else will do. Yes, fellow smoke1·s, IT'S YOUR APPROVAL THAT'S PUSHING CHESTERFIELD AHEAD.
