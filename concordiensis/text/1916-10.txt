I think I was the only one who had the honor of conversing with this geliltleman while he linge.red among us. I had wandered back a long distance from the dormi- tories and stood on the upper side of 'the farthest bridge, watching the brook exult over the sullen dis- comfiture of the early snowfall. My thoughts had started from the remark a companion had made to me on the same spot, that he would some day have such a brook bounding through his own grounds, and had run on thence I do not know how long. I -was tiving in the future, when a hand was laid upon my shoulder. But the touch was so eloquent that I understood it, and did not look up untiL the spell, which had held me, gradually broke itself. Then I turned and found the old gentle- man gazing into the stream as dreamily as I had gazed. \Vhen I moved, his head slowly rose, he left off leaning on thi: bridg~, and presently took his eyes from the water and fixed them on me. For all that the look was so dreamy I know it searched me through and through. Beneath this passing cloud of disposi t10n was some- thing in him which would have follen from me had I not been hon- est. Perhaps I was under partial magnetic control. I had no desire to check his gaze. I remember only a phase of delicious frank- ness. He raised his hand from my shoulders and passing it with- in my arm, drew me along the path through the g.rove with the same recondite affectionateness which I now remember to have felt from the first. Returning by degrees from reverie to reflection, from reflection to conscious ob- servation, he came at length to relate substantially the following story. I can account for such con- fidence only by supposing that he detected and understood the in- tense sympathy with which I lis- tened to him: \Just fifty years ago I stood where you stand. I was a sopho- more at U- College. But that was before yonder buildings were erected. This hill, I remember, as a favorite walk, and a scene of ·a duel I happened to witness be~ tween two Virginians.
