Our men came to the bat determined to do some- thing, but the first two n1en were retired. Enders begc1n the fun by putting out a two bagger. Howe was afraid of Beattie and gave hhn his base on balls. Then Tilla- paugh came to bat. A sigh was heard to go up fron1 the crowd, for he ·had struck out . every tirne before ; but that sigh \Vas turned into a yell when the ball was seen to fly over the second base111an's head and roll by centre field out towards South college. Enders and 2 . ~cat tic caine hon1e, and Tillapaugh got third, but he was unable to score. No n1ore runs \vere n1ade, and the garne ended 5-3 in favor of Union, 'g6.

Beattie covered second as \vell as he always does, but the all round playing of Melius eclipses anything that has been done on the can1pus this spring. A gentlen1an among the spectators who has played on the Cornell 9 · teatn said Melius did the best base running he had ever seen. Melius had two base hits, three stolen bases, three put outs, and two of the five Tuns to l1is credit.

Union 5; Colgate 3~ Friday, the 9th of June, \Vas an unlucky · day for the Colgate baseball nine. 1'hey lost the second league ga,ruc with Union on their own grounds. It was not their own fault ' however, for they played all the ball they kne\v and some football. . A pparent]y they had resolved to win by foul q1eans if not by fair. They \kicked\ and struggled, did every- thing but play gentlen1~nly baseball. . But all in vain for Union won. ii The story of the gan1e follows. Colgate went to bat ,.f'irsl. The first man got first on error of Brookins and second on error of Sul- livan. Leebe, the second [nan, flew out to Merchant and Mills struck out. F. Munro reached first on an error of Enders and stole second but Brovvn struck out. That ended the inning and Union's errors did not avail Colgate. In Union's half, Brookins the first tnan to bat \Vas thrown out at first bv the Colgate third basen1an. Stnith \vent t~ the first on balls and the second on a \vild pitch. He took third on a passed ball and scored on an error of the third basen1an. Sulli~an made the circuit of the bases in nearly the same way, getting his first on balls. Mer- chant hit the ball to second base and reached second on the vain attempt to thro\v out Sul- livan at home-' He stole third.. Sigsby struck out. Talln1an hit to third who fun1bled the ball and Merchant scored and Tallman got first. EncJers went out on a hit to.first and that retired the siue with the score 3 to o in favor of Union and one inning played. 1~ ,_>r tbe next fiv.; innings Colg ~te could not score. They tnade three singles off Sigs- by but they \vere so scattered and judiciously tningled vdth strike outs that they did not count. Ur1ion added one run to her score in the fifth and another in the sixth. Up to the end of the Colgate half of the sixth Mr. W. ]. Ford, Colgate, 'go, umpired the game and umpired fairly. Then Colgate proposed to change and obtain a m-ore willing tool. They introduced a professional ball player who had. never seen the inside of a college but Captain Merchaut refused to recognize hin1 and after twenty n1inu~es argument Colgate yielded and Mr. Ford continued to umpire. [n the seventh Colgate tnade her first run after two tnen were out. Two hits and two stolen bases tnade the score. Colgate \vas retired in one, tvvo, three order ,in the eight but in the ninth they n1anaged to rnak:e two runs. Risley tnade a two-bagger \and Briao-s . bh made a· single. That combine-d with two errors by Union and a passed ball made the two runs but the gan1e 'vas lost to Colgate. Tallman tnade a n1agnificent running catch and Leebe on second made a star play, pick- ing up a grounder, and retiring Auchatn- pa ugh. The score : UNION. R. I B. S.B. P.O .. A. E.

The advertisetnent on page xxii should however be noted: There are a n utn ber of on1issions among the lists of n1embers of the various clubs. 1'he idea of giving each senior's and junior's offices, honors and societies is a good one and the exan1ple may vvell be follo\ved by oth-er Garnet boards. There are several literary features \vhich deserve especial men- tion.

I find n1yself waiting ,,,.ith expectancy each two weeks for its arrival. You l)OW have the rnost i~1teresting and best periodical Union has had within my ren1e01brance. I am delighted \Vith the late progress of Old Union.\ According to a Syracuse daily tlte little college in that city is considering the advisa- bility of cornpeting in track athletics with Cornell and University of Pennsylvania. This ren1inds us of the answer the ,old farn1er ga.vc to the question, \Do you think Hawaii will be annexed?\ \Well said he, \the Ryeville debating society has been arguing the question but they has' ent decided yet.\ One would ain1ost imagine that Syracuse actually believes that they are superior in track athletics to Union and all the ·other colleges in the league. We venture the asser- tion if Union had taken as n1any men to Utica as Syracuse the pennant would have been ours. As it was every n1an bLit one frotn Union took a prize. Yet ·what glory vvould there be in defeating a college whose continued cry is\ Not farmers enough.\ The official programme for com 1nencen1ent has been completed. The week begins with the baccalaureate sermon Sunday, June 25th, • at 7:30 P. M., in the State street Methodist church. It will be delivered by the Rev. Tin1othy G. Darling, , D.

The paper this year has been out on titne to a degree never before .equalled. This nun1ber was due last Wednesday but it did not appear until to- day, one ·week behind ti,me. Why was the rule of a year broken ?

N O\V this reason would never have been printed THE UTICA MEET. The ninth annual n1eet of the New York State Intercollegiate Athletic association was held at Utica May 30. Syracuse won first place, Hamilton second and Union third. Barnes, of U n !on, broke his own record in . thro\ving the hammer. Bad tn,anagement on the· part of Colgate was the tnost conspicious feature of the day. Van Schaick \Vas cheated out of second place in the n1 ile run, the judge ordering it to be run over again the next day. Union, doubtless, in proportion to the nutn- . ber of men started, did better than any other college. With twelve men eleven prizes wer~ won.

One of the most valuable and unique prizes for excellence in collegiate interclass athletics is that which is offered by 1'rustee John H. Starin, of Union College. 'I'his is a loving cup of solid silver costing over $250, which was recently offered by Comrrtodore Starin to that class which should win five of the six · gan1e of base ball each spring, and one game . of football each fall, with each of the other ·. three classes, making six games in all. Of . these a class must win at least five to secure , the trophy. The class which is so fortunate · as to win the cup has its nan1e inscri-bed thereon, and may either. r~tain it or rnay · again offer it in a sin1ilar con1pet.ition, in which case it will be known as the \Class of --athletic trophy.'' The trophy on a handsome ebony pedestal , is on exhibition in the windo\vofBenedict Bros., Broadway and Cortlandt street, and attracts much attention. At the college the incentive given to athletic sports by this evidence -of interest on the part of Commodore Starin has produced a n1arked effect. The inter- class gan1es .have been hotly contested, and enthusiastic interest manifested. It has not only brought out on the campus,. many students who would otherwise not derive the benefits of athletic training, and it has also been very effective in developing latent n1a- terial for the college tean1s. As a result Union won the foot ball cham- pionship of the State last fall, \Von fron1 Wil- lianls last \Veek the paln1 of supremacy in intercollegiate field sports and bids fair to secure the base ball chan1pionship this spring
