CONSIDER THE LOWLY DEAN Hecently many students have found oc- ca:,;ion to grumble about several of the an- Houncements made by the Dean's Office. Gl'ipes about the exam schedule made their regular appeamnce immediately up0n its pub- lication. Those with exams spread out com- plain that they have to stay too long, and will get ve1·~· little inter-term vacation. Others, ·with exams piled up toward the be- ginning, lament their lack of oppo1·tunit,v to Cl'Ul1l. a tremendous job on his hands figul'ing out possible combinations for scheduling exams and classes. The Blain object as fae as he is concemed is to cause no unnecessary con- Hicts and to spl'ead out the exams for the majm·ity of the students so that in general they will not have more than one pe1· day_ Everyone cannot be pleased. Some students must have exams on the last day. Courses for next term rnust be scheduled in such a way that all requh·ed courses in each curri- culum for mem.bet·s of each class come at different hours. Naturally some e'!ectives will conflict with requi1·ed courses or with other desired electives, but after all the range of choice is fairly wide. and there are other terms during which manr students may take these electives.

Economies had to be made, but we continued to live within our· budget. There were panicky suggestions about lowering our standards in order to secure students, and there were re- ductions in salaries and an unfor- tjlnate curtailment in Hbrary a.p- prepriations. Nevertheless, those m charge of the coHege made no seri- ous errors; and our recovery was rapid. In fact, today, in the midst of our greatest war, a careful list- ing of the total resources shows assets and a. plant worth over ten millions. When the course ~chedule appeared, dis- g-runtled students muttered fa.i11t damns un- der their breath at those in the Admi·nis- tl':ltion Builcling for the conflicts between cuur:,;es they wanted to take. Ancient Greek Pottery and \Vestbrook Pegle1· 37 come at the :::mme hom-, and both are snap courses \Vith likeable instructors, so why shouldn't they lJe able to take both'! One 1nan wants no 0830 classes, and finds that his one re- quired course comes at that hout'. Another hopes to rest and work on alternate days, but he has two required courses and they come on different da~·s. There are those who want all their classes in the morning- and those who want as many as possible in the aft.emoon. Freshmen are complaining- that they will have too many labs next term, etc. A big howl went up when it was an- nounced that the new term \ViH start Friday, :\larch :L A lmg-e number of the students fed that they should be given one more weekend of vacation. We do not claim that no one sh auld com- plain. We do, howevet·, wish to remind those \vho protest that they are being treated t·oughl~· and maliciou~ly, that the Dean has We do not know the principal reasoH for requiring students to retum for next term on Friday, the 2nd, but suspect that it is to gain time so th~1t classes will he in full swing by the following Monday. Were this vacalion period to be lengthened, that at the end of next term would undoubtedly have to be curtailed. You can't have your cake and eat it too_ It is principally a question of robbing Peter to pay Paul. The Dean must tr~· to make the vacation breaks approxi- mately equal, and this, perhaps, is the cause for the unpopular stal'ting date_ In summary let us sa~· to all students v.;ho feel dissatisfied or unhappy because of Ie- cent announcements emanating from the Dean's Office-put yourself in the Dean's shoes. Try to realize what a colossal task it is to work out satisfactory schedules, and remember that you can't satisfy everyone, no matter what ~·ou do. V -12 Men Leaving; More Com~ing in Approximately 52 men will termi- nate their Naval training careers at Union College March 1st when they lea,ve for rnidshipmen's school. The men ,will be sent to eithet• Norfoll{ Receiving Unit or to Columbia for their indoctrination instruction. Proba-bly another thirty men will leave Union for V-5 training. Twen- ty-two of these have already been selected and approximately five to ten more will be selected on the basis of the freshmen screening te9ts which were recently given. Union College's quota of incom- ing men for March 1st is 152, of which 65 will be pre-med students. There has been no change an- nounced in the status of V-12 A students who entered on Nov. 1. Union College's Naval Training program will include a number of deck officer candidates beginning :Vla1·ch 1, it was announced today by Lt. C. Brubaker. The quota for the initial vrogram will be 50 men. The only new course which will be taught in the pro- gram is navigation. ---a--- Physical Training As far as is known there will be one hour of gym a day during exam week besides the regu!ar cal- isthenics. It has not been definite- ly decided where the gym classes will meet, but the probable plan is that one class will meet in the morning for those having after- noon exams and one in the after- noon for those having morning exams. ---a--- WHERE TO NOW? It was announced yesterday from an official source in the Physical Education Department that gym classes wi!l continue next term on the same plan as they have been running this term unless the strength test averages run below this term's average, which was 63.9. If the tests are below average the classes will work harder on ·building the men up on those points in which they are weak As the end of the term approaches, a num- ber of us who are about to finish our college careers are faced with an unce1·tain situa- tion_ Some have been classified lA, some have had deferments shortened, some have not heard anything definite_ The new ruling on deferments in the age group of most of the prospective g1·aduates is somewhaht uncertain in its application_ Does it mean that we have been defel'l'ed just for our own convenience to get a de- gree before going into the army? That hard- !~· seems 1·easona~ble. Have we been defel'l'ed to go into industry to help produce war goods'? Then why are we apparently :being drafted now? The only reasonable answer seems to he that the needs have changed sudden!~-. and technical educations are not needed any more. We suspect, however, that the answer is not a reasonable one, but is tied up \\'ith some of the shady politics which plagues this country even in time of war. Whether we are drafted now or not, we cannot help reflecting that we have been \living on bonowed time\. While others have lJeen fighting, \Ve have been leaming, against the day when our learning would be utilized_ Now the debt is being called, and we will gladly pay. But what is the price? No one : seems to know_ And how should we go a:bout paying enough to meet the loan? By going into the Army as privates? By working in Industry? There seems to be no one in authority who will tell us. The Draft Boal'd will act, but do they know any more about it than we do?

HOME OF THE ZIEBRA BAR Now Featuring MARY PRESCOTT \Queen of the Keys\ Nitely from 9 The need for economy stimulated serf-criticism and le.d to simplifica- tion of our curriculum and its ad- minisb•ation. Our present divi- sional system is the result. There still remain unsolved problems and confused thinking about them; but this may well be a healthy sign, and in any case, it is a situation common to those American colleges which are truly alive to the rapid- ly changing world in which we are living. T-o the writer, the most disturb- ing feature of these years is to be observed among the undet'grad- uates. There has been a steady de- cline of interest in student govern- ment and in individual service to the co!lege, and this is visible in their ft'aternity responsibilities too. There have been exceptions, nota- bly the organization of the Stu- dent Tax Committee, which gave us one of the best systems of levy- ing, budgeting, and handling stu- dent taxes that undergraduates anywhere have established. The pi'cture, nevertheless, she>ws a de- ciine in that enthusiasm for the college and for their ·own affa-irs which had been so healthy a fea- ture of our student body in the twenty-five years which ,preceded the ·depression. These brief sketches )lave given the reader a glimpse, at least, of the long history of accomplishment which lies back of the co)1ege. We inherit this in the form of benefits we ,receive as undergraduates_ But it also involves an obligation to carry on t'he work of the alumni who have gone before. us_ We have a right to be proud of Union's his- tory and the service of her sons to the nation. 2026 are now ih uni- form, ill classes from 1889 to 1947.

Norm Schwartz, another Union stalwart, also suffered a very lean evening, sinking only one field goal and a free throw fcor a three-point total. The Ho·bart squad was ap- parently watching him closely, too, as he was bottled up each time he attempted his dash into the left corner of the court to toss up a left-hand hook shot.

This march to the mountains $~------------------------- The group of students who will receive their degrees upon comple- tion .of their courses this term in- cludes thirty-seven who were origi- nally in the class of 1944, and nine who are members of the accelerat- ed class of 1945. This is the last of the class of 1944 to finish. Other members of the class received de- grees as long ago as last June. The plans .of the graduates-to-be are still not all settled, but a sur- vey at the last minute revealed the following statistics: Eight of them are already in the Army. having en- listed more than a year ago in .the Electronics Training Group of the Signal Corps. The.se men will be· called to active duty soon after graduation and wm ;be given special training in .electronics, pr.esumably being accompanied by an officer's commission. Twelve have been offe1'ed jobs in war industries, which they will enter upon if their ·draft boards de- . cide to allow it. Three have aca- demic positions, which are subject to the same conditions. Of the re- mainder, several have no definite plans at present, while a few ex- pect to be drafted shortly. Finally, there are the twelve Navy students, who will receive their orders from the Navy. The degrees scheduled to be awarded include all the degrees ordinarily offered by the college. Five men will receive the Bachelor of Arts degree, nine will become Bachelors of Science, while sixteen brand-new Bachelors of Science in Electrical Engineering will be sent forth into the world. The remain- ing degrees to be awarded are·: Bachelor of Science in Civil Engi- neering, four candidates; Bachelor of Science in Chemistry, seven, and last but not by any means !ea.st, Bachelor of .Science in Physics, five men-a most unusual number foi' that d~gree.

It is not eas~· to bid farewell to the Con- cordiensis that we have loved and cherished and st1 ugp:led and foug-ht for during the past two :vears. It is new1· eas~· to leave an olrl friend whom one will never see again in the same intimate capacity. Several weeks ag-o \Ve feared for the velT existence of the pa.per.

Opinions may differ as to the best methods of set·ving these functions, but we hope none will deny that the need for a college newspaper here at L'nion exists and will continue to exist. J. E. S.

GOODBYE AGAIN! \Y e he;;itate to try to add anything· to the farewell remarks made by President Fox in chapel this \\'eek, but we feel that our effort comes in a diffe1·ent class. \Ve have no advice to give, no information to offer, aml no im-itation to be alumni. We only want to .say goodb~·e. \Ye will try to say it in less than three hundreds \\'ords, but brev- ity is not one of om virtues.

No do1:1bt some of you will be obtuse enough not to see the beaut~· of life at Union. We feel sorry for you if that is your case, but it's ~·our .funen1l. not ours. We once were naive enough to believe that the way to enjoy college was to lle ac- tive in extra-curricular affairs fo1· the fi1~st three years, and then to sit back and enjoy the position of a B.:\I.O.C. l\Iaybe that works in normal times, but confound the war, just as we reached the beginning of our last year the whole college tU1·ned over and sat down on the other side, and we had to begin work al! over again. Now, just as we might be' allle to sit back and enjo~· life again, we are 1 leaving. I' To be honest. we suspect that we had a· better time, and got more out of livin a· I '\ while here, because we did work hard all the time. Looking back, our predecessors i who really amounted to anything did the same. Tripp wet-nursed the Concordy for a year, Mills mothered the Radio Society tht·oug;h its first year, and others had their f\enior-year jobs. We promised not to give any advice. We won't.

How can a gun hit a plane going 300 miles an hour 20,000 feet up ... when it takes the shell 15 seconds to get up thete and in that time the plane has gone more than a mile? Besides, the shell curves in its flight. Wind blows it. Gravity pulls on it. Even the weather affects its velocity. The answer is the Gun Director- an electrical brain which aims the guns. Swiftly it plots the plane's height and course. Instantly it s~lves the complex mathematical problem, contmuously matching the curved path of the shell to that of the plane so the two will meet. It even times the fuse to explode the shell at the exact instant. The electrical Gun Director has greatly increased the deadliness of anti-aircraft gunfire.
