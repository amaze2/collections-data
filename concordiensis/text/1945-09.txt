Since the first quarter of the Nineteenth Century, the United States has played an increasing role of importance in the affairs of South America. In the Monroe Doc- trine, we affirmed that the inde- pendence of the revolted ·Spanish colonies was a specific and definite aspect of America's foreign policy; that Europe was to keep hands off, and that we assumed a benevolen·t, patriarchal overlordship in the af- fairs of South America. Although it never was pursL ed in the early decades of the Century because of the utter lack of power by the United States, and out· dependence on the British Sea Forces. the Men- roe Doctrine remained as the writ- ten policy of the Colossus of Hw Not·th.

Japan's surrendet·, at the end of a devious road that began with her arrogant and treacherous attacks upon Pead Harl.Jor and the Philippines. marked the beginning of a new era, one of peace and reconstruction. Looking· back on the :~ years and X months of America's particip.:ttion in the war, a num her of factors stand out as contributing· berond question to the final and Yictorious outcome. X ot the least of these was the role played by our steady and unremitting purchases of war bonds in building- and ·equipping a tremendous civilian army and the most powerful Xavy in world history. As still another effect of this steadr bond- buying, ::.ra\·~··s ch·i!ian and military person- nel will meet the problems of peace \\'ith an accumulation of saYings that will enable them to embark on this most important phase as sound, so]yent citizens, prepared financially to shoulder the new burdens fac- ing them. ~-~--------·-- :\'or is this the end.

Lohmann, Secreta.I'y, Yale Univt-rsity, New Haven, Conn. \UNION--A CENTURY AND A HALF\ A hundred and fifty years ago, a handful of citizens residing· in the ;\lohawk \'alley banded tog-ethel' to establish an institution of higher learning. They were men of all mces and faiths and they wanted this college -formed in a country that was still wilder- ness-to be for all races and t'aiths. Thus the~· called it l 1 nion College and it became the first nonsectarian college of its day. The nation was young then. The land was sparsely settlecl. Indians still roamed in the Valley. The count1·y had just won its in- depenclence and Washington was its first President. 1 t was a new era for America. An era full of youth and energy. In this em l'nion was bom. It grew up with the nation. Today Union is celebrating the hundred and fiftieth anniver.sary of its founcling. FiYe generations have passecl through its walls in these years. History has been written there. It is the third time that L'nion has celebrated its birthda~· annivel'- sary. The fiftieth and the one h undr·edth annive1·saries were the other two occasions. Those two times the celebmtion may have been more spirited, but today it is more glorious. The College is stronger than e\'er. It has just weathered the storm of another wat·. The future will see it blossom forth. A !ann'. ever-growing body of alumni marks its progress. The Campus is large ancl offers much space for expansion. The en- dowment is growing with the help of gener- ous fl'iends. A healthy student body and a versatile faculty are leading it to new and greater heights. A h undrerl and fiftieth annivet·sary comes but once in the life of a college. .:\ot many of the colleges and universities existing in Americ-a tocla~, can boast of one hundred and fifty ,\·ears of history. A sesquicentennial is no minor event. lt deserves some special attention. Few of the present alumni and friends of the College attended in 1R9il when Union celebrated the one hundredth anniversary of its founding. Few of those here today will be present to witness the two hundredth. For most of us, this celebmtion is the only one with which we will have personal con- tact. Let's try om best to mal\e this a re<lll;v worthy sesquicentennial. The anniversaries of the future are for others. This one is oun;. In the last one hundred and fifty years, Cnion has acquired a prominent place in the list of small colleges. Among its alumni are many famous people. l\nion's contribution of well-known personages to the wo1·ld is exceptional!~- large for a college of its size. It has a great background. Thet·e is no reason to assume that its future should not be at least equally glorious. \\'e have every reason to be proud of our College and to celebrate at its one hundred and fiftieth birthday. Tonight an informal suppe1· will be given in the Alumni Gymnasium for the alumni, faculty, students, and friends of the College. The supper will be a get-together for the entire Union College family. It will be no stiff, f01·mal dinner, but a simple birthday party. The unveiling of a portrait of the late Dr. Dixon Ryan Fox, president of Union from 193-t to his death, early this year, and the listening to a broadcast about Union from New York Cit~·. will be the main fea- tures of the \party.\ Perhaps this supper is not the most ideal \\'a~· of celebrating the sesquicentenniaL Perhaps some other, more impressive cere- monies could have been instituted. Fathel' Time, however, chose a poor date fol' this occasion. W ol'ld \N ar II has .i ust ended. It macle any large-scale celebration impossible. In fact there were feat·s that there mio·ht be no celebration at all. The obstacles \\~l'e so tremendous. To make everything more complicated, our president died last JanuaQ·. .:\Iore obstacles \Yere !aiel in the wm· of the celebration. l'nder the guidance of 'or. Fox, who undoubtedly had already former! plans for this event, a more impressive celebration might have resulted. X evertheless, we are having a celebration. In spite of the multitude of difficulties that !tad presented itself, Union will celebrate this day. The hundred and fiftieth anniver- sar~· shall not pass unobserved. The broad- cast about L:nion is a pioneer ventme in combining education and entertainment. It will carry a little of the spi1·it of the celebra- tion to those who because of travel restric- tions OJ' other reasons cannot attend the supper on the Campus. The broadcast is onr XBC ami people all over the nation ure able to listen to it. To many alumni this is an opportunity to meet some of their former classmates, fra- temity b1 others, and acquaintances. The\· can talk about the years now passed. Ther~ is a certain color in things that have gone. Like wine they ripen ·with age. Things that seemed common in thei1· dav mav be full of life when recalled years Iat~r. · There is thus a special significance to this :mniversary eelebration. To see even·one take part, to see the crowd at the suj;per, the students, the forme1· students, the faculty-all are there-makes one think of th~ behind-scenes of college life. What is it that causes people to take such pride in their college'? To show such genuine in- terest in its affairs'? College life is a tmnsition period for every student. He is out of high school, out of the boyish youth. And ,\·et life itself has not quite come to him. The joys and memories of co.llege life are thus more firmb· entrained. When he is once out in life those days when he prepared himself for life, are fo~d memories to him. ;\lemories that are awakened, affirmed, and reenacted bv the celebration of the sesquicentennial. · The sesquicentennial celebration was not arranged ovet· night. Weeks and months were spent in preparation and much thanks belong to the members of the committee and the many others who contributed to this event. Special gratitude must also be expressed to the many friends of the College who donated so generously to the Sesqui- centennial scholarship fund. It was a true expression of loyalty to their Alma l\later. Let the true Union spirit pervade and make this day into one of the greatest of Union's one hundred a!ld fifty years of history.

SATURDAY, SEPT. 15, 1945 TH;E SESQUICENTENNIAL POEM THE LOAVES OF UBERTY Four Sonnets WriHen for the 150th Anniversary of the FoUI·:Jding of Union College: 1795-1945 by Cod man Hislop, '3 ·I I. The Hunger Rut-browed, he chipped the first rude arrowhead, His dull, remembering brain devising here This f1ying stone to llreak the antlered head, To· fell the doe, to stop the gnawing fear Of empty belly and the summer's end. The plow was born of hunger, and the chase Forgotten; hunters left thek trans to tend The maize, to beg the oracles for grace. Bllt, when the loctlsts came, and totems fai.Jed, The men of measure, with thei.r gauge and tool Assayed the famine and the stars, assailed The GG>ds, and margined life by hour, by rule. At rast Man's towe:ved clocks rose everywhere, Their pendulums the pulse of his despair. --------0------ II. The Seed What •loaf can still the hunger of the heart? W·hat ·bread can nourish, too, the famished mind? Greece and the Isles sowed grain whose yield is part Of all our store; the seed they left behind For Rome to grow to her own uses failed The Christians, cultivating fear, by night, Begging dark husbandry of Him who, nailed Upon the Cross, had offered them the light. At last our fathers fled the famine. Here, Beyond the tribal hates, the ancient dread, They built in freedom, Freedom's house, where fear Of fear is shuttered out. Our daily bread Is on its shelves, and nations come to see The shaping of the loaves of liberty. 0 HI. The Sower ('In memory of Eliphalet Nott, great teache1· and great pt·esident of' Union College, 1804-1866) America lay west of him, a land Of green meridians, a map of hills And river latitudes. He knew, with hand And will to :1hape the earth, to shape the sills And doorframes, and the roofs of unnamed towns, Americans would fill the land, would clear The forest reaches, dam the flood that drowns The spring-plowed field, would root and prGsper here. The young men came, and saw, because of him, The huge design. He talked of Man; he taught Of engines, and of Ia ws to shape the rim Of fortune, and cf nations, and of thought, But always and at last he turned to Man And taught of Him who shapes the changing plan. 0 IV. The Harvest (ln memory of those Unio!ll men who have given their lives in this second World War for liberty) A thousand, thousand years were met in him: The hunter, racing famine to the kill, The plowman, trying to offset the whim Of priests and hearthstone gods that he might till And reap. Philosopher and king and saint And men of rule and measurement had life Tn him, and on him, from afar, the faint Unsetting star shone through the world's blind iiltrife. Inheritor of earth and sky and ·sea And legacies from every humble man Who helped to shape the loaves of liberty, From these he had the burden and the plan. Today, for liberty, he, too, is dead, And what was his you have inherited. Rugged Duty The V~il That Hides the Darkn'<lss:s>------------------ Lifted (N'<l. 8) This week we lift the darkness surrounding the life and times of one of the most unassuming gentle- men on campus. George \Little Monster\ Zopf has finally confessed that he spends all his time during leave holding hands with Alice while he ceremoniously wiggles his eyes. He has admitted that he and Alice are growing more and more intimate and she is revealing more :mel more to him each time he sees hel'. Geclt·ge, however, sa-ys that their last week-end together was sexless. Really, is that living up to the 170 I.Q. that Centerville High School gave you? \Casanova\ Niehaus is still hav- ing his troubles. He is one of the more fortunate of us who are being returned to civilian life and being forced into a 8ituation like that is not easy for the best of us. <We heard the \lover\ boasting that he had received .three air mail letters from one girl last Tuesday. Tough!·) Well, Mr. Niehaus has been making plans for entering a medical school. In reply for an application to the University of Cicinnatti, he receiv- ed this reply, \If you are a dis- charged serviceman or 4F please submit the full extent of your phys- ical disability.\ A T.S. slip is forthcoming. for Morg Glavin who placed his dun- garee shirt under the hood in Chern. lab. Morg was unpleasantly surprised to find that someone had dumped acid all over it. Mr. Glavin, of course, had the usu a! comments to make. Oh well, Morg, with all this weather you should have your own airconditioning anyway! The flagpole on Library Field was the scene of a very interesting incident duing the early morning hours last Sunday morning. Jack Edwards, Don Gray and his cousin felt that somehow they should work off their extra energy and, feeling in good voice, they proceeded to serenade the campus. This, how- ever, was not enough for Mr. Ed- wards for he decided that he want- ed to 'see the top of the pole. His excuse for his actions is that he was interested in finding out whether there is a gold ball or an eagle on top. His attempt was un- successful, though, since Mr. Ed- wards was unable to climb the first step on the concrete foundation. The trio thwarted by all attempts, finished off their performance by a song and dance routine. We shot:ld like to take this opportunity to con- gratulate these men on their talent and announce that we are sending a recommendation to New York in reference to a post-war job with the Rockettes. GEO. BOARDMAN & BROS. Manufacturers and Distributors of RESTAURANT and BAKERS SUPPLIES & EQUIPMENT Albany, N. Y. Established 1869 Governor Letter STATE OF NEW YORK EXECUTIVE CHAMB-ER ALBANY Dr. Benjamin P. Whitaker, Acting President, Union College Schenectady, New York Dear Dr. Whitaker: September 5, 1945 I am happy to send warm greetings to the facul-ty and members of Union College and to all guests present at the Sesquicentennial celebration on September 15th. Union's contri·bution to our state and to the entire nation duri-ng the one hundred fifty years from 1795 until the present has ·been beyond measure. The distinguished clerics, educators, lawyers, physicians, engineers and members of other professions who have gone forth from Union hav:e ca·rried her lamp of learning to every part of our Nation, and indeed, to every corner of the civilized world. In our national and state governments and in all of their branches-legislative, executive and judicial-your alumni have been, and today are in positions of ·responsibility and leadership. Rare is the institution which can, like Union, lay claim to having had among its graduates a President of the United States, thirteen governors of states, six mem-bers of the national cabinet and more than one hundred members of our na:tional Congress. When I was last In your Memorial Chapel with my good friend, your late President, Doctor Fox, whose passing we all so deeply lament, I could not fail to notice the two portraits which hung faciNg each other, the portraits of the Secretaries of State of the United States and of the CGnfederacy who served at the same time during our Civil War. Union is properly known as the \mother of college fraternities\ and it seems to me that in view of the nearly one hundred college presidents among your alumni, you might well share with your sister institution at New Haven the title of \mother of college presidents\. No listing of the living alumni now serving in the high posts in our own State government could be complete, .but to name a few of course I ,think immediately of Speaker Heck of the State Assembly; Doctor Wiley, our Associate Commissioner of Education and one of your Trustees; Doctor Brind, Counsel to our State Board of Regents, and Mr. Hiram Todd, in charge of the Legislative Investigating Com- mittee and one of your Trustees. In a very real way the history of Union College has paralleled the history of the State during nearly the entire life-span of New York State. While some of the other institutions of collegiate rank have fallen by the wayside and disappeared, Union has grown ever stronger, cl:!anging with the changing needs of the times. The development of your departments of engineering, the close and mutually helpful relationship maintained with the potent industry so closely linked with your city, the reinstated emphasis in recent years on the social studies, the pioneer work in welding technical and liberal arts training into a balanced educational program-all these are only a few of Union's adaptations to the changing demands of modern society. Union, in my judgment, does well to adjust its offerings in higher education to the needs, not only of the wide geographical area from which it draws students, but, also, and perhaps especially, to the requirements of the youth in its immediate area, the Capitol District. During World War II, as in all of our nation's other great conflicts since the Revolution, Union's contribution to victory has literally been beyond estimate. I refer not merely to your training of V-12 students ~or the Navy's officer personnel, or to the many graduates and students and faculty members who have served in our armed forces, significant as all this has been. I refer especially to what Union, through the late Professors Berg and Wold and through Professor Rojansky and all the others, has contributed toward our Victocy in this most scientific of all wars through carrying on and pushing forward the work of Steinmetz. I wish I could be with you on the 15th. Since I cannot, will you not accept this expression of my very sincere and genuine interest in and affection for Union College, my admiration for its past, and my hopes and expectations and sincerest -good wishes for an even brighter future. • Sincerely yours, (signed) Thomas E.

CALL 3-6036 THE GAZETTE PRESS Printers 3 CENTURY-OLD POEM LAUDS UNION SCJENCE Professor Emet·itus Bul'ges Johnson has unearthed and sent to the Sesquicentennial C0mmHtee a poem \written on the occasion of the celebration of the 50th unniver·sary of L'nion ·College\ in 1845 by the Reverend William McJimsey of the Class of 1819. It is entitled \The Prosperity of Science,\ and is contained in a Christmas gi.ft-book annual entitled \The Laurel Wt·eath,\ edited by the Reverend Samuel D. Burchard. The latter became famou:; later as the man who elected Cleveland in 1884 by his \Rum Romanism, and Rebel.Jion\ indorsement of James G. Blaine, Cleveland's opponent. The poem i;:; of p,u·ticular interest because of its blending of the theme of ~cience with the conventional religious sentiments of the clay. In 1829, President Nott had inaugurated• the first science curriculum in a liberal arts coJ.lege, and in 1845 ,at the time of the Semi-Centennial, he had just anno1:1nced a similar· innovation in engineering. The Prospet'ity of Science Near Mohawk':; river, Halls of Science stand, From which goes forth an impulse through the land. To fot·m the minds and hearts of .t·ising youth, And lead them on to Learning and to Truth. Bright Science here time's honored laurels yields, More dear than famt> won on earth's battle fields; Taste, Genius, Talents, Virtue, all combine, To spread their honors on its hallowed shrine. Improvement springs ft·om Education's power, Where friendship grows amid the College bower, Association's magic voice recalls The sct>nes of life that once did cheer its walls. More pure than waterf'J from Castilian streams, And bright as virtue with light's brilliant beams Should be the impulse h·om om College Halls, And all the honors that adorn their· walls. Oh happy impulse of Religion's light, That spreads around peace, freedom, science, bright, The fountains, pure the streams shall also be, And nation:; shall theil' influence feel and see. Where once untutored Indians wild did roam, The Muses find their welcome and their home; The rapid car, joined with the force of steam, Makes distant scenes like pr·ospects of a dream. Our Alma Mater, not unknown to fame, May still increase the glory of her name, And where sweet Mohawlt's silver waters flow, The tl'ee of Truth and Knowledge strong shall grow.

4 USO FUTURE? In a few wee!<~ the fate of the USO <United Service Organizations) Clubrooms on Clinton Stl·eet will rest with the people of Schenectady. This o1·ganization cannot ·be tl'eated lightly. The USO is one of the most important agrncicH of the Community Chest. Some people feel that, because the war is over, the functions performed by the organiza- tions are no longer neces~ary. These people are wrong to thin!< this way. V\'hy can't th~:y bring thl'ir hends out of the clouds, and· ta·ke a look at the earth'? The Arm~· and Nnvy a·re dis::-harging a huge num•be1· of men, but the process cannot, nor wm it be. as rapid as we imagine. The men who arf' to be d·ischarged will have to pa,;s through a period of ransition. .:\1any months we1•e devoted to train them to fulfill their miJi.tary duty. and it will t~l<e many months for them to readjust their habits befot·e they will be ready to tal'e up civilian life. Schenec- tady has sent many of her young- men tu war. When these men went away, they IPft thPir hom\\ confident that they would have their fl'il'nds and family to baclt them U·fJ in their efforts, and the efforts of their comrades. Don't let them down! They have given their lives so tha.t oui· country may continue a>< the stronghold of dl'mocraey, and 11tJ a land of plenty where all may live as they choose in happiness and peace. The USO has welcomed Schenectady Veterans, and has tried to help them find their way in ci·vilian life. Attendance records will show that your boys have been coming to the clubrooms and havl' enjoyed th<> hospitality supported by the funds you have so gene10usly dona ted. They have enjo) ed tht' wat·nl gn•etings of thP volunteer workers, who cl<ma.te their time fn•ely and ask no reward other than that of the happiness of the servicemen. The Army and Navy have announced that they have no intention of closing their esta.blishmen ts in the vicinity. At Union College the Navy Department is C'nlaq:ing the V-12 Unit. On November First 485 men are entering l'nion to begin their training. They will be in Schenectady for sixteen months undl'r a rigorous program. :Most of these men will be away from home for the first time in their lives. \\.hat has SchPnt>rtady to offl'l' in recreational facilitie~ for these nten in the servirl' of thPir country • There ar<' very few places other than the USO. wiH.>re n ~et\\'iceman may go for a few hours of relaxation. The college cann\t pro\·idr for all of the rPcreational facilities of the trainees, but all of the effort they have made is appreciated by the student;;. An editoria-l i11 a. SchenPCtady newspaper stated that, ''the USO should not bl' maintained rithei· foi· a few V-12s or for the benefit of a fpw servic<'nH'n who might wandet· in during the day.

The servicemen who have visited Schenectady are grat<>ful, r!ePply gmteful. f,or Hw fine welcome they have received from vour ag-enC'\', the l.TSO. M,;,ny pe<ople in·obably wond·et· why th~ CSO is so impo1·tant to the Navy V-12 Tra.me~s. Ther,· are two majoi· rea~ons. First the men find at tl1e cluhrnt~m'< an atmnsphPl'P of hospitality. and the kind of peopi•' with whlll!l till'\' ltl<P to assot·iat<'. Sprondly. the V-12er is paid $50 a mor.th out uf ~·hirh must eume val'ious d<·ductions. All of the me'1 allot a puit;,,n of theii pay for the purehase of a \Var Bond every month. or e\<'lY two months. AftE't' this drdUC'tion is made he still has to pa.y for lli~ laun<il·y, t·efeJ·enC'P ,extbooks. SC'hool supplies, personal C'lotilin>J; and toilet art iclc'S. Some of tlw men pven allot money to assist in the suppm·t of their families. S0 you see. there isn't much left of hh:; pay to u~e for recrea~ton.

Tickets for the Sesquicentennial Ball, featul'ing B0b Chester and his orchestra, went on sale Wednes- day evening. The cost for the tickets will be six dollars and Navy students may obtain them by con- tacting Jamie Dennis while civilian students may contact Phil Sottile of North College, North Section; Herb Standen of Old Gym, Paul Hochuli of D,U., Bob Riesner of North Middle, and Charlie Grimes of North College, South Section. Plans have been made to light the campus in the same manner used for the Sesquicentennial cele- bration of last weekend. It has also been announced that w,G.F.M. will broadcast a half hour program sometime during the dancP. Housing Arrangements Phi Gamma and Psi Upsilon have been set aside by the college authorities as a place in which the girls may stay Friday and Satur- day nights. Reservations must be made with Mrs. Briggs before Oc- tobet· 2. The charge will be $2.25. All men who desire to order flowers for their Prom dates may order them from the two repre- sentatives who will make the rounds of the dormitories. Phil Sottile is taking orders from the civilian students, and Jamie Den- nis is the Navy representative. In previous years various stu- dents have been selling the corsages for a little pocltet money. This year the Intra-Fraternity Council has accepted the responsibility in order to make possible the appear- ance of a big-name band at low cost to the students. All profit made on the sale of flowers is being turned over to the Prom Committee to help defray the cost of the Pt,om. Let's get behind the Prom Committee, and buy yotr corsages from the official repre- sentative. Important Garnet Announcement Robert H.

Since he became Faculty Advisor to the Concordiensis, we have come to depend upon him fm· support, both material and mom!. The undergraduates write, read and control the publication of this sheet, and J{ingsley Given has done much to insure that this policy continues. Absot'iJing the multitude of material issuing forth from his office, the Concordy has taken adva·ntage of h b amazing \nose fm· news\. On the other hand, the many snarled proulems that in- evitaul,,· arise in undergraduate or·ganiza- tions, ahnt~·s seem to find their f:olution in the Office of Announcements.

PHI DELTA THETA A week has now gone !J,r and we are still hearing favorable comment of the Sesqui- centennial Cele!Jration. The most mag- nificent part of the evening was the radio show, \150 Years of Cnion\. We no\v know that 6.G is the number of radio stations which took our NBC show. :\Iany more may have carl'ied the show and not have informed the Committee. Since at that hour 47 is the usual number of radio stations canying a national hook-up, Union College has done itself proud again. A quotation from the radio script of \Hi.O Years of UnioH\ introduces Union College to the nation in the September 24th issue of the magazine, \Newsweek\. On pages 96 and 97 of this publication in the section We believe that a public apolog-y is in ordet· from Professor Ribber for his infamous insult on o11r character. We would also like to remind him that the Navy is accepting enlistments ag-ain, and that if he feels that he would Iil\e to do his part in the occupation of Japan he need only apply fot• active duty, fol\ a man with his knowledge of Japan and the ways of the Japanese people, would be a \'aluable asset to the Armed Forces.

It is hoped that more is seen of Barker before he leaves in November.

The enthusiasm shown by the play- ers has been very gratifying, espe- cially among the large percentage of men which show up daily fer the driUs, said Milo. Stresses FundamPntals For the first week of ,practice MUo has been stressing fundamen- tals, fundamentals, and more funda- mentals! It's his earnest belief that .before any team can master the little tricks and habits which make a good college hoop sql ad, they must be weU versed in the funcamentals of the game. He has been stressing dribbling, particular- ly the fast and low type that mcves the baH down court in a hurry. In the passing department Milo has put the Clccent on accmacy first in throwing at a moving man. In that all important phase of shoot- ing he has been drilling the boys again on accuracy particularly on under the horp shots and one hand- ed throws ft·om the sides. On the teamwork side he has been im- pressing the players with the im- portance of working smooth with the ball being continuaUy in motion on quick, short and snappy passes. First Scr:m~r.ag-e Ht'lld In· one cf the first scrimmages held Thursday all men worked well on the court and although the play- ing was slightly ragged at times the Chief believes that with a little bit more practice t nder their belts the team will soon be working like a veteran outfit. Although the Chief has declined to mention any member in particular it is common knowledge that little Red Dingly should have one of his best years. The remaining four positions on the starting five are wide open with Bill Fisher, by virtue of his three years of college experience, having the edge on the second spot. At present there are 18 men try- ing for the c:weted 15 spots on the varsity but it is expected that more men, perhaps some returning vet- erans with service experience and some freshman with part of the C-1 24-13. A-2 Grabs 3 In the first A-2 game the only ;core came when Moder faded back and tossed to Kitchell as he stepped into paydirt for the first, last and winning marker. In the OG-A-2 contest \Toomb\ Calvin accounted for all of the A-2 sc0res when he took passes from Bjork and Fili- powski to romp into paydirt lot r times. Against DU the A com- pany men garnered all of their scores on interceptions from a vastly improved Delta team with Filipowski, Isaacson, and Spicer star ring for the winners. B-1 Takes 'l'wo B-1 hit the winning trail against DU when Ned Santerian, protected by an almGst impregn1ble line. . faded bacl~ and t0ssed two perfect passes into the waiting hands of Jerry Bongaard as he was standing into the end zone. In the second B company game a revitalized C-1 .tefrm playing under their new play- ing manager, Frank Iannella, forced the league leaders to come from behind twice before they finally ·put the game on ice. C-1 went into the lead when a Brewer intercepted a Santerian aerial and galloped into the end zone in the first minute of play. B-1 countered twice in a row on TD passes to Bongaard and Zwiren to take a 12-6 lead. In the second half Ian- nella tossed a long one to Smart who caught it over his shoulder as he was gcing into the end zone. Another Iannella pass to Glavin put the Brewers in the lead again 13-12. On the kickoff C-1 let Demp- ster run the length of the field to score without trying to touch him under the belief that he fumbled lhe ball. Referee Moder did not see the play and Syretle, umpire, ruled in Dempster's favor. The final B-1 score came when San- terian faded way back and tossed to 0Jt cette in the end zone. high school sport under their belts southE>rners \Vin will be out for the squad.

Number Six: Joe Bernstein In Bitterly Fought Game The Phi Omegas, youngest of the college fraternities, pulled a big upset Thursday evening when they held Chief Marvins All-Stars to a 2-2 tie in a h~rd fought s::>ccer game on Council Field. Phi Ompga Scorps The inexperienced Brewers from Phi Omega got off to an early start in the first pericd when Frankie Iannella dropped in a beautifully placed corner kick and followed it minutes later with another from the same spot which Neil McAllis- ter \headed\ past Paul Clapps hands for another score. The All Stars, led by Chief Marvin and Ned Santerian roared back but their ef- forts went for naught because of the wonderful goal tending by Cap- tain Wells Jarbee of the Phi Omegas. The half ended with the Phi boys on the long end of a 2-0 count. Marvin Tirs Count Late in the third quarter Chief Marvin booted in a long one to bring his team with'n a goal of a tie and minutes later the Chief scored on a penalty boot to !mot up the count. The way things stack up in the Inter-Mural football loop, it looks like D. U. Dormatory is the civi- lian outfit with the best chance to wind up near the top with the Bell-Bottom Boys. You can bet that extra clab of butter that •you sneaked in Hale House that one of the main reasons why is the fact that Joe Bernstein is running the team from the blocking back spot. The D. U. lads work with a \T\ formation, shifting into a single wing before the pass, and giving the tosser .one heck of a lot of pro- tection. It was Bernstein who drilled the squad in the \T\ and the shift, and it is Bernstein who does most of the protecting. Stocky Joe learned his football at Horace Mann High School in New York City, where he won his letter last sea- son.

NAVY TO PLAY IN LAST TILT The Custodians and Ships Com- pany softball teams will write finis to Unions ball season Monday nio-ht when the two rivals clash in th: last game of a four game series on Library Fie·ld. Custodians Improved The Custodians, despite the loss of the previous games will rate as close favorites to cop the one re- maining tussle. The Campus men have been playing steadily improv- ing ball since their first game back in last July. It was about two montho ago that the SA's rode roughshod over the Custodians 20-10 but it was less than three weeks ago that the same Custodian team shelled the SA hurler from the box, and went into an 8-3 lead that almost grabbed for them the game. There was a time when the Ships Company team could count on a secure 7 or ·8 run lead going into the fifth but less than a month ago this same Ships Company team had to put on a 6 run rally in the closing innings of the game to grab· the contest. All signs point lo a Custodian victory.

4 Station U C R S Celebrates 4th Anniversary This Week First Station to Present Program The Union College Radio Society celebrates its fotrth anniversary as an active organization on the Union College Campus this week. The histot·y of mdio at Union goes back some 29 years to 1916. In that year. a College Radio Sta- tion, 2YU. was put into operation, and did a large amount of re- ~earch with loop and directional antennas. During World War I. activities ceased, a·nd no recorcs are available showing any campus radio organization unti·l sPveral years after the war. \V2XQ, First Station up on the Union College campus sinlilar to the one on the Brown campus.

The llrst pt·ogram went out of the studios on Septembet· 22, 194.1, to the Kappa Alpha Lodge and to N01·tli college. A few weeks later, the line :;ystem was extended to in- clude South CoHege and most of the on-campus fral'el'nity houses. fhis was the start of the Union Broadcasting System, with the sta- tion call-letters UBS. After a year of opet·ation as Station UH!::l, the intra.muml sta- tion combmecl with the Radie Wot·kshop to fut·m the present Union College Radio Society, and the call-lE'ttet·s of the station were changed to VCRS.

In 1920, after a year of experimentation. the college station, then W2XQ, stm·ted a regular series of broadcasts of musical selections. This was the first regulat· serie::; of music pro- grams broadcast by any college radio station. Thus. Union College has the honor of being the birth place of regularly scheduled radio broadcasting. This series of musi- cal selections in fact. started several weeks prior to the first pro- grams of Station KDKA, usually thought to be the first station to broadcast music. In the fall of 1920, station W2XQ broadcast the presidential election returns. and also broadcast a description of the football game between Union and Rhode Island Sta.te for the benefit of State students unable to attend the game. Among the regular pro- grams were the Sunday evening sermons by Dr. Richmond, then President of the College. On October 27, 1941, the station. then l'BS, became an affiliate in Class A status, of the Intercol- legiate Broadcasting System. This organization. with member stations at many eastern colleges, serves as an agency for standat·dization of broadca:;ting procedure and ex- change of progmms and technical ideas. In addition, the IBS acts as a representative for the mem- ber •tations to national advertisers. At the present time, Station UCRS cal'l'ies progmms of three national advertisers, the Gruen Watch Co., the Gent't·al Electric Co. and the Radio Corporation of America.

YatPs, '98, re.ttring. ~rl\si- their hats to an upperclassman and In the spring of 1921. thP mem- bers of the club fitted a baby car- riage with a portable receiver and loud-speaker. During the Spring Prom, this rig was wheeled around downtown Schenectady while re- ceiving the programs of Station W2XQ. This stunt was widely publicized, receiving write-ups in newspapers and radio publications all over the country. The newsreel companies were also present and made several shots of the rig. By 1924, the RRdio Club was operating both a radio-telephone station. WRL, and a radio-telegraph station, W2XQ. With this equip- ment, they were able to reach the high frequency of 80 megacycles, which was a remarkable achieve- ment at that time. The activity by the Radio Club for the first few years of its activ- ity after the war was instrumental in interesting the General Electric Company in radio research and manufacturing. In the late '20's. interest in the Club fell off, due both to the de- parture of the men who had been most active. and to the increasing complexity of government regula- tion of radio broadcasting. Almost nothing is recorded about the Club until the mid-'30's, when equipment was obtained for use as a Public Address system at home games. Radio Workshop About this time, another organi- zation developed around a different phase of radio broadcasting activ- ity. The \Radio Workshop\ was primarily engaged in radio writing and acting. For the .most part, their work was broadcast over the commercial Short Wave stations with studios in Schenectady. In 1940, interest arose in a type of intramural broadcasting initiated at B'rown University. The Brown Network operated a station in the regular broadcast frequency band under a Federal Communications Commission regulation allowing unregulated and unlicensed broad- casting at a very low power, pro- vided that no interference with commercial broadcast stations is experienced. In order to achieve this, it was necessary to carry the lowpowered signal from the trans- mitter to the locations of the re- ceivers in dorms and fraternities by wires. New \Wirt>II\SS Method In 1941, with the guidance of David W. Borst, founder of the Wireless method, a system was set In July 1942, when the Navy V-12 program was inaugurated at Union, it became evident that the space in the E. E. Building would be needed for class and laboratory work. New studios were located in the base- ment of the Psi Upsilon ship, and the equipment was moved early in July, with only a brief interruption of broadcasting activities. The facilities in Psi Upsilon include a large room housing control and transmission apparatus, record files and workbench, and a smaller room used for announcing and special programs. On September 30th, 1943, Station UCRS carried a play-by-play ·broad- cast of the Union-Columbia foot- ball game from Baket• Field in New York. The program was con- ducted by the members of the UCRS staff, and was relayed by direct wire to the Psi Upsilon studios and broadcast to the campus on the regular frequency of 650 kilocycles. Thus, Union students who were unable to attend the game were able to follow the progress of the game minute by minute. The program was pre- sented with the cooperation of Station CURC, the member station of the Intercollegiate Broadcasting System at Columbia University. New Programs On March 26th. 1945, Station UCRS initiated a morning pro- gram, called \The Dawn Patrol\ for the benefit of the early risers on the Union campus. The main features of this program include a brief summary of the morning headline news, a report on the weather, and then a continuous program of popular music. dent, and Dicki·nson E.

The Japanese are smart, clever people and we need intelligent and competent officem in our occupying .forces. It does not seem to me to be a job to be passed around with no one willing to do it because it will be unpleasant. Yet if we fail to do it, we shall again have to fight a long exhausting wat· all over again.

A native of Detroit, Mr. Ketz came to Union College in 1931 as assistant profes- sor of physical education and ath- letics; and since then he has been coach of the track teams at the college. At Michigan he was the nati-onal intercollegiate hammer- throw champion. ~ince he fir:st came to L'nion College in :\lay, 19-1-t, Lt. Andreen has been an essential part of L' nion C'olleg-e and his willingness to cooperate \dth the c:olleg-e in evel'Y wa~­ possible is deeply respected. Always inter- ested in the recreation of the naval tnlinees under ].Ji::; command, Lt. Andreen wns ex- tremely generous of his time and effort to see that satisfying conditions \Vel'e met e\'erywhere. One almost might sa~· that Lt. Andreen has been adopted as an \alumni\ of l\nion so genuine is his interest in l..'nion Colleg-e. Whenever Lt. Andreen spoke in chape 1, ynu could almost always be sure of a well de- livered masterful oration of much interest. The Anclreens have fitted well into the life hl:'l'e at L'nion Colleg-e and we wish the entire family the best of luck and hope that they will always think fondly ol' the time that they spent at L'nion. While cooper·ating- in every way to make the publications-both the ·Concordy and Gamet-successful by sympathizing with their aims and their problems, he has made it possible for his men to work on publica- tions while performing- thei!· naval duties. Yes, indeed, all l' n ion is sorry to see Lieutenant Andreen relieved.

Because of a chHng-e in printers and our inabilit~· to date to secure another before the term ends, the .:\Ianag-ing Boar·d has decided that tonight's issue will be the last until Novembe1·.

We've \kicked\ about a lot of things all along, but now that we're sa~·ing farewell we also recall many fond 111 e 111 o 1·i e.s. First, we wish to express our appreciation to the facult~· members and civilian students for their fine coopenttion ancl the llo~pitality which they have shown us. There are few colleges where the \\:armth of fellowship between both Navy and civilian factions is as strong as here, or \\'here Navv men participate in as many student activities. We huve enjoyed this comradeship. We should like to thank the USO club workers, both volunteer and paid, and especially :\lr. Regnier and Mrs. Woods, and also many of the fratemal and civic or- ganizations of Schenectady and vicinitv for the recreation and entertainment which· they have supplied for us during our off-duty and liberty hours. Because of their un- ceasing efforts many a clull evening or week-end has been made a period of relaxa- tion and fun. Finally, we are very g-rateful to the thousands of people of Schenectady and the capital area who have welcomed us into theil· homes and have been our fr·iends; and the g-hls who have been good sports, accept- ing- the inconveniences of liberty hours and understanding the limitations of our in- comes. These are the people who will make us remember Schenectady as a friendly city, and the days which we have spent as pleasant ones.

RESEARCH AND ENGINEERING KEEP GENERAL ELECTRIC YEARS AHEAD ~~-7~~~1'1~&-:wd'.I&F.z~~ff~~~ .... -.:?1\'6.... f ANK WRECKER THE trail of tank wreckage from Normandy to Berlin is evidence of a super shell's effectiveness. It was one of the potent weapons necessary to drive the enemy back to Berlin. The shell's core is cemented tungsten carbide, improved by G-E research and manufactured by the Carboloy Com- pany, G-E affiliate. It's a material second to diamonds in hardness- commonly used for the tips of cutting tools and wear-resistant dies. Pro- jectiles using this core weigh less than ordinary shells because of their light- weight aluminum housings, and so have higher velocity. They often stopped German Tigers with a single shot-at ranges up to 3000 yards. The core does the actual armor piercing. Because of the extreme hard- ness of the carbide, it doesn't flatten out on impact. Instead, it goes right on through the armor plate and then breaks up into lethal pieces inside the tank.

The Chief has been putting his men through of- fense drills this week and is quite pleased with the ease in which the squad fitted in with his plays. The men are, without a doubt, a very green crew but they are in there digging and Sewards is optimistic. Bill Fisher and Red Dingley were on the Chiefs list for compliments and the former especially was com- mended for his hard work. Two newcomers were given darkhorse awards-Bishop and Markes the latter being an exceptionally fine long shot artist. Hansen, of course, leads the freshman basketball prospects which is quite a position to hold.
