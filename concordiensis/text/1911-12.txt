The Concordiensis VOL. 35. DECEMBER 13, 1911 N~o. 9 NEW y~o·RK ALUMN.J MEET AT MANHATTAN HOTEL The New Gymnasium is the Main Theme of Presi- dent Richmond's Address-· Dr. Ellery Speaks At the annual meeting and dinner of the New York City Alumni Association held at the Manhattan Hotel, December 7, President Richmond spoke at length up- on the need of a new gymnasium. He said in part: \There are two things about our athletics which I am sure you will be glad to hear. The fir.:;t is, that we have n~ athletic scholarships, and only one man on this year's football team, is on a scholarship and he is entitled to it because he is the son of one of the col- lege officers. This state of things is, to say the least, not invariably to be found in other colleges. \The second statement which I wish to make is that the scholarship of our athletes i3 distinctly higher than the average. Out of 34 men who held places en the various college teams only three men have conditions of any kind and 25 are ranked as high grade men. The faculty makes no concessions to athletes and the under graduates bok for no CJncessions and want none. Altogether the tone of athleti:s is not only healthy, it i3 di3tinctly high and I want to say it as earnestly as I can that we must stand by the boys in their effort to secure a new gymnasi :.1m. They need it and they deserve it. \We must get it for them an::l we must get it now. There is nothing at thi3 present moment which will do so much to encourage and help the work of building up the c 1::1 cc 11 ~ge to which we are all devoted. I have pledged my support and I know that you are ready to r;L~dge yours to the full ext\3nt of your power.\ There were a hundred and fifty sons of old Union present and the guests of honor included: President Richmond, President Elmer Ellsworth Brown of New York University, Dean Benjamin F. Ripton, Dr. Edward Ellery, Mr. Burge3s ] ohnson of Amherst Cdl::!ge, Rev. A. V. S. Wallace and Dr. George H. Downsey. Dr. Edward Ell =ry spoke upon the desirability of having a common meeting of the board of trustees and the faculty where the men of practical affairs and the men of more or less theoretical affairs cotdl get together and work for the best interest of the college. \In such m·eetings the demands of everyday_lirecan be presented by the men who know them. Hovv th.e college can be deve}ioped to meet the demands ca.n be presented by the m·en who know the departmeats of instruction most intimately. Such cornmon coR<J1ave would be mutually inspiring.\ John Bigelow, dass of '35, the oldest hving gradaate of Union College, was unable to be present. In a nete from him which was read he said: \Were I able to come I fear I should not meet (}ne of my class.\ At the conclusion of the dinner, annual el,ecticn ()f officers for the ensuing year was held. The foU'ow~~ng alumni of Union were elected: President, Rev. George Alexander, class of '·66; first vice-president, Han. Char- les E. Patterson, '60; second vice-president, E. L_ Par- ris, '57; secretary, William Allen, '95; treasurer, Fred- erick Klein, '95; executive committee for 1914:-, Dr. Daniel M. Stimson,. '64; W. A. A. Brown, '77; W:iU iam L. Kennedy, '88; H. D. Merchant, '93; Wagner \Van Vlack, '00; for 1912, Edward I. Devlin, '81; Conde IIarn- lin, '83; Leslie R. Pratt, '86; William J. Smith, '9~; Her- bert C. Bothwell, '02; for 1913, Edgar S. Barney, '84; Norman E. Webster, '96; Edward J. Prest, '92; George F. Allison, '84; Arthur B. Vossler, '96_ ~ BAND OFFICERS ELECTED At a meeting of the students interested in t:he ()r- ganization of a band held last Thursday afternooll. the following officers were elected: C. T. Male, '13, ,!}resi- dent and conductor; R. E. Lowe, '13, vice-president; D. R. Finley, '13, treasurer, and W. A. Mudge, '14, secre- tary. Those who were present at the meeting included: Male, '13, Lowe, '13, Finley, '13, Bisgrove, '14, Mudge, '14, Hawley, '14, Purdy, '15, Hunter, '15, and Sau erbrei, '15. Professor Bennett read a paper on his travels in Greece in 1903 before the Travel Class and others at the Y. W. C. A. in this city last Thursday evening.

8 THE ,CONCORDIENSIS GLEE CLUB GOVERNORS AT ·CHAPEL Joseph M. Carey, Union '67, governor of Wyoming and Governor Adolph 0. Eberhardt of Minnesota, two of the eight western governors touring the east in a special train, were speakers at the college chapel Wed- The Glee and Instrumental Clubs made their first appearance at Elmira, on Wednesday evening, Nove:m- her twenty-ninth. Thirty-one men make up the clubs, there being five nesday morning. President Richmond, as a member · men to each part. Each number was well received of the receptiorr committee to the western state extr. and encores were numerous throughout the entertain- ecutives, procured the speakers, who gave short ad- dresses following the usual chapel services. Governor Carey put most of his speech in the form of advice to the students and in the course of his address told of the conditions at Union when he was a student here in the sixties. Governor Eberhardt, a self-made man through and through, told of his efforts to gain an education. He said that he had had but three months school:ing at the age of twenty-one. In his speech he paid high tribute to the small college saying that the personal con tact with instructors meant more than the large university training. At present he is endeavoring to increase the education facilities of his state and is put- ting most of his efforts in the giving impetus to the work of the small college. William Henry Faust, '14 The funeral of William Henry Faust, who entered college with tfu.e class of 1914, was held in this city Monday afternoon. Faust was a graduate of Sche- nectady high school and completed his freshman year at college. Owing to ill health he was unable to con- tinue his course this falL He was a member of the Union Street M. E. church and in which he was presi- dent of the Epworth League. Faust was popular among his classmates and only his short time in col- lege prevented him from being leader in many ac- tivities. The student body unites with his family in sorrow over his loss. 0 DEWEY ELECTED CAPTAIN Hartley G. Dewey, '13, a member of the Beta Theta Pi fraternity, has been elected captain of the football team for next year. Dewey has played varsity foot- ball for three years and has shown himself to be a fast and consistent player. He filled the position of half- back his first two years but this season showed marked ability in generalship at quarterback. R. L. Beatty, a sophomore at Columbia, broke the intercollegiate record in the shot put when he made a throw of 40. ft. 2! in. m'ent. The Elmira papers spoke very highly of the concert and many people said that the entertainment was the best that Union College had ever g.iven there. These facts speak well for. the concerts which will be .given during the winter. The management has secured several dates but as yet the New York and Buffalo trips are not assured. 0 LIBRARY NOTES There was no business of importance transacted at the meeting of the library officials held last week. No gifts have been received since the last issue. Although not generally known, Mr. Clinton says, the library is open to the public for reference. No books, however, can be loaned to any but college men. New books are coming in at frequent interval.s. Among them are the following: Volumes IV and IX of Goedeke, Grundriss zur Ge- schichter der D2utschen Dischtung. The others will follow shortiy. Several voh1mes of the Oxford Dictionary, by Mur- ray are on the shelves. There are two volumes of Principles of Economics by Tausig, which will interest the B. S. students. Four books, published by Wiley and Son, on street pavement and upkeep should be welcomed by the Civils. One large volume of note i ~ th2 Glory of Greece, by V. C. Stobart. This book has many handsome illus- trations. The list includes numerous other works on timely subjects, such as food adulteration, purchasing power of money, wages, government, religinn and literature. Through the kindness of Mr. J. Havermeyer of New York city, three volumes of the Transactions of the Grolier Club have been placed in the college library. The annual orders for books are being sent out. Some are already placed and others will be taken care of later. The University of Pennsylvania offers a new course in reading of sacred books.

THE CONCORDIENSIS 9 PHILOMATHEANS' WINNERS OF ALLISON-FOOTE DEBATE P·el:ers, '12, Captures lndiv.iclual Prize But Opposiag Society Out-Arg,ues Ad·elphics On Friday evening, in theooUege chapel, the Phjfo- mathean Society won the a:Nntlal Allison-Foote debate. The individual prize was W()n by Roy W. Beters, presi- dent of the Adelphic Se>ciety. The question debated was: Resolved, That the :repea:l of the Sherman Anti- Trust Law would be detri,rnental to the best interests of the country. The Phil:!>rnatheans defended the af- firmative and the Adelphics tile negative. The speak- ers for the affirmative were: A.Han B. Mann, '12, Theo- dore W. Hanigan, '13, Janes H. Potter, '12, Arthur1L Mann,'l2, alternate. For tbe negative: Kenneth E. Walser, '12, Donald A. Cot:tliter, '15, Roy W. Peters, '12, Charles T. Mal·e, '13, alterna-te. Potter was the win- ner of the individual prize :last year, and so was de- ROY W. ·PE.'fERS, '12 Winner of Individual Prize barred from competing foT it this year. The jutlges of award were: Lewis Cass,. Esq., Albany, Joseph H:ar- mon, Esq., T~oy, HaroB J_ Hinman, Esq., Albany. Mann open ~d the debate. He stated the law and defined the question at issue. He discussed the de- veloplnent of trade and of corporations in this country an.d the causes which led to the passage of the law. He pointed . out that while the law, literally inter· Preted, makes all monopoly- illegal, the recent decision of the Supreme Court- n1akes illegal only tll0se mcnopclies which are un1air and lawless. Walser outlined the argu1aent of the negative. He stated that the history of the law showed that it had had unfavorable results. That it had f~iled t() ac- complish its original :PUrpose and would never ~aave been passed if it had been known how it would be ap- plied; that a law should be such that it could be in- terpreted literally; that the law is inconsisteNt; that a general law cannot be enforced but that we should have specific remedies for specific evils, and that the law is unjust. . Hanigan proposed that the law he amended and al- so proposed remedie3 for the drawbacks which exist now. Coulter brought forward proof to show that the law was fundamentally wrong. Potter showed that the repeal of the law would leave the corporations without any check upon them whHe the substitution of a commission for the law wouJd throw an enormous burden on the government. Peters showed that the enforcement of the law would be extremely detrimental to legitimate busi- ness. In rebuttal Walser sum·m.ed up and replied to the arguments of the three affirmative speakers. Mann stated that in the light of the recent Supreme Court decision the law would not discourage big busi- ness. Coulter stated that the law failed to accomplish its purpose and was, moreover, entirely destructive. Hanigan asked the negative to state the specific laws which they proposed and showed that the Sher- lnan Law was directed only against bad trusts. Peters and Potter each summed up the argume_nts of their respective sides. H STUDENT BAND ASSURED Charles T. Male, '13, has been appointed by the Ter- race Council to take charge of the organization of the student band. A tax of one dollar per man was levied at college meeting thus giving a sum of money suf- ficient to order instruments and carry on the details of preliminary steps. Th~re is great enthusiasm among the students over the idea of having a band and inasmuch as there are many who already play band instruments the success of the organization seems assured. It is expected that it will take two or three months practice before public appearances will be deemed advisable from the standpoint of both the players' safety and the hearers comfort; but at the end of that time it is asserted that the organization will be proficient enough to render music at any gathering. Detective William J. Burns lectured on \Citizenship and Municipal Graft\ recently at. the University of Michigan.

The Monthly fills a l()ng felt want in our college life in general and it is a worthy addition to Union's list of publications. THE CONCORDI- ENSIS, sheltered, as it is, within a thin glass structure 7 would dare not hurl stones, even though it were possible to sight a vunerable spot in the home of the publication. So we turn to praise. Passing over the other creditable features contained in the Monthly we stop a moment over what seems to be a feature supreme, the editorial section. The editorials accomplish what every writer of editorial strive for and but few succeed in, namely making an interestingly readable production. uu This is the ninth and last issue of THE. CONCORDIE,NSIS for the termp According to the contract with the printer there will be nine each term with a special issue at commencement making twenty-eight numbers for the year.

THE CONCORDIENSIS ~pt1linB J\mong <!Iollege c$len Below is printed a portion of a letter devised by Professor G. M. Whip- ple, of Cornell University, to illustrate the mistakes in spelling made by stu- dents in English papers submitted to the professor after they had been re- turned for revision with special demand for correction of orthography. No errors have been included that were simply slips of the pen. It need not be said that no student would make all of the mistakes, but it is a fact that no student of those examined would fail to make some of them. It seems almost incredible that such gross errors in some of the com- monest words could be made by university stu dents. In fact, none of the words could be said to be uncommon in a ooHege n1an's vocabulary. Jn treating the matter editorially the New York Times says: \In one sense the fault lies with the elementary schools undoubtedly. In another it lies with the colleges which fail to demand adequate attainment in the simple and in- dispensable requirements for admission to the higher grades of instruction.\ lt is true that there are born poor spellers; but more often the poor sp2l1er is a product of inefficient instruction, though carelessness figures not a little in the matter. Insistance by colleges upon a strict entrance rule re- lating to spelling ability would necessitate an increased effort on the part of the elementary schools to improve conditions along this line and voluntary a~tion on the part of the schools towards eliminating poor spellers by making the work a major subject even through high school would further the cause. The letter follows: Dear Aunt-Today I recieved n1y cliplon1a, and now, thank fortun, I am educated. I have not yet intirely detirmined my carere. Wheather I shall finaly earn my livlihood by going into the solliciting buisness as my uncle's pardoner will dipind on his perferences. At any rate, labJr0us and humuliating manuel pursuits are furtherest fro111 111y intention3, as I am concious allrea:ly that the university in- vironn1ent has prooved particularly valuable to me in evry way. My intellegual equippement ha3 been advansed harmonously; by imtne- tation of the best sholars my vocabular has been strenghthened; sub- erstitions al'l most as baJ as those of the heathern have been na.i:5ed and prooved incorect to n1e; my inaetiative has been arroused and in- tencified; socialy I am well acquip~d and in::identily the rough eges I used to show· have been el2n1in1ted; again, the discipline I have re- cieved from the pratice work in the labratories of physsics and chem- istery, where p2r::>istance, court3y, couragiousness and similar qual- lities are de:-in::ttely emphazed, and the knowledge I have recivecl from the lecturs and di3scussions of my proffessors in bonay, rhitoric, n1ath- n1atic~, phi~iology, ect. shoud be a sourse of inestimatible benifit to n1e frmn whatever angel it is regarded. c 11

l2b THE ,CONCORDIENSIS WINNER OF THE STORY CON·TEST The winner of the ten dollars for the best original story written by a member of the undergraduate body was won by Morris P~ Schaffer, '14. The story is entitled \The Fourth Inventi.on\. There was not as much interest shown in the contest as had been hoped for but there was a sufficient number of competitors to warrant the awarding of the prize. Of the number of stories submitted the winning contribution was chosen because of greater ingenuity in plot and more natural handling. The judges for the contest, whom THE CONCORDIENSIS management wishes to thank, were Professor Edward E. Hale, Professor Horace G. Me Kean, and instructor Stanley P. Chase. The winning story is published below. lt was the greatest day in the year-yea, the great- est day in his life. Conrad arose promptly at five o'clock, dressed, swallowed his buttered rolls, left the eggs untouched, and gulped down his coffee. His mother looked on him, her son, her joy, with a smile of deep parental love and satisfaction. Her husband had joined the silent majority and Conrad was now her support and her mainstay. Mother and son lived-rather existed-in a three room tenement flat in a big city. No, not THE big city! But a city which can boast of newspapers just as yellow as the New York Journal, of politicians just as openly corrupt as Charlie Murphy is said to be, of a police department just as subservient to gam- . bling den owners as N~w. York's is said to be, of drinking water just as pure as that of the East River where our Metropolis vomits her waste, of air just as delightful and exhilerating as the college . student breathes in his chemical labora- tory. It can bpast of scandals as prodigious, of divorce suits as sensatiDnal, of swindles as clever, of robberies as bold, Qf suicides as numerous, and of murders as intrepid as New York can boast of. Can you picture this humble three room tenement flat? Can you picture its inhabitants-the m0ther, the SQn? Do you. know why the son s~ems as happy as a boy when first he dons his long trousers? Because it is Election Day. For C0nrad, Election Day was always the most interesting cay in the year. Even at the age of seven he displayed great interest in the ballot and his interest advanced with his years. At the age of thirteen he knew what the salaries were of ·governors, the U. S. senators, and so down to the - . - - . members of the aldermatic board. He could tell you the approximate majorities and pluralities of success- ful candidates in the past five or six elections. How unl.ike most boys who measure their degree of intelli- gence by their ability to name basebaB players, tell in what teague they play, what salaries they draw and what their batting averages are. Election Day was THE red letter day in Conrad's calender. On this particular Election Day, however, he held more ·interest than ever. Today, he was going to vote fot the first time. M.oreover he took an active and important part in the campaign that fall and this instiUed in him added vital interest in the results of that day's. ballot. How it gladdened his mother's heart to see the part her ''Connie\ had acted in the campaign; to see with what impetus he started his party wheels rolling after they· had been broken down by party disruptions and clogged with the dust of successive defeals. Be stumped for his party candi~ dates, because he believed and claimed them to be \conscientious men, men of unstained integrity and men of discretion and ability.'' His words, his oratory and his youth swayed the masses that heard him. Moreover, he was a close student of economy and his remarks appealed to the reasoning as well as to the understanding of his listeners. Although he was severe in his attacks of the opposing candidates, he did not utter a remark which he did not substantiate, he did not criminate anyone unless he proved his accusations. His opponents feared him. After many years of victory and power, defeat stared them in the face. ' Conrad was most bitter in his denouncement of \Boss Bill\ Btlter. He was a rich liveryman and the boss of Conrad's district. Since he found politics more profital::le, the livery business became a \side line\. Encouraged and urged on by numerous party victor~es, he had the reprehen~i_ le boldness and utter audacity of nominating himsd~z for Congress. \Shame be on our political system which wouL:l allow such a man to be in the Halls of Congress. Are you going to sent him to Washington? Are you going to aid corrupt professional pcliticians and endorse r Jtten politics ? In these words Conrad Maxwell closed his last speech the night before election. It was 5:15 o'clock A. M. when Conrad stepped out of the front door to the street. It was a brisk, invi- gorating, ideal November day. He was to do \picket duty\ at the polls, which were situated in the schocl- house basement. Even at that early hour the street was hustle and bustle; for the working men of a big city unlike their more fortunate brethern of the smaller city, must generally leave for work an hour

I . r e a g > ···~ d n THE CONCORDlENSIS l2.c or so earlier because the :shops and .factories where they toil and grind out a bare Uving are far from their homes. From amidst thj:s ear;fy rush of human- ity, a young man stepped forth, handed Conrad a sealed envelope wi1th the eurt exp~anat·ion\ frotn Mr. Belter,\ and vanished as sud.den~y as he had appeared. Conrad opened the envelope and found therein a typewritten and unsigned note as foll'ows: '''Want to see you immediately on a highly important matter to you\. The yoang man read between these Hnes ''Wen't .. you come into my pHrlo~, said the spider to the fly.\ He was no fooL Belter was up to one of his political tricks. He would stay away from the B~ss. ''Now, young feUer, give us a chance t9 finish. W,e know you are hdding out for big stakes. We don't work for nuthin'. We don't want your servkes for nuth:in' neither.\ He ·put an envelope in Conrad's hand and conti!rilied, '''There is $1,000.00 in there, si·gn that' statement ancl. it is yours.\ \Y ~u h~s~, low ward hee.ler. You · public parasite. ~G~ i.mmoral briber. You dare offer me dirty money to turn against my honest comrades.\ Conrad ejacu- e~:ted each word with increasing ~age and finally gave vent to .his feeliFlgs by bringing his pugilistic powers to play and marring the facial beauty of our hitherto pleasant looking WiUiam Belter. Before Conrad could leave, the Boss was up again. There is something in our nat wre which leads us to - do exactly that which we have determined not to do. \Look ahere young feller, i told you to cut out that stage play, didn't I. I just want to say one thing. 'My Pinkertons outside took a snap shot o' you coming in my office. They took one when I handed you the en- velope with the money, but, of course, they didn't take one when you threw down the money. That will 'send you up': Besides, I can have our judges 'send you up' for attempted murder and can sue you for tb.at $45.00 from your father's funeral. These things As soon as Conrad decided not to see Belter, he straightway hastened to the Boss's office in the ;livery- stable. This n1ay t;ound contradictory, . but it i8, nevertheless, a fact. The politician was waiting for him. As soon as he spied the young man, he greeted him w·ith a \Hello Maxwell'.', and was about to extend his fat hand for the customary haRdshake, but perceived that Conrad kept his hands in his overcoat pockets, perhaps, pur- posely. Conrad was surprised at the good taste with which the office was fitted up. The things which par- ticularly attracted his notice were a picture with a sterling silver frame of the blind Milton dictating \Paradise Lost\; and the stenographer's desk, upon which he observed a telephone, a typewriter, a camera and a dictograph. Unconsciously his hand fell upon the last named instrument and involuntarily his fingers pressed the little disc. \I am going to be a pretty busy n1an today, Mr. Belter, so you had better speak quickly if you have anything to say. 1 didn't intend coming here at first, but I thought you had a confession to make which ·might interest the public.\ \The HEll with the public\ came back Belter. \Con- fession, nothing,\ he fairly .shouted. \I said I wanted to talk something of importance with you and I keep my word with everyone-except the public. Now, 1 ~ok ahere young feller, cut out that stage play and be sensible. You read what our papers said yesterday 'bout Clusker and the other angel3 of your party.\ He lowered his V'<?ice-, \Wel:l just sign this statement for our pa}jets:sa~in' those reports are true in your'sthna- tion.\ - ·· The younger man colild not refrain from laughing aloud. \Wh'Y pray, should I be so utterly foolish· as to do that?\ wouldn't be pleC;lsant for you; would they? Now, be sensible, I wouldn't like to see these things happen to you for your ,mother's sake, and, besides, your father was a good friend o' mine.\ \How' d you l:ike to be 'hind prison bars? Wouldn't like it very well, eh? Like to go back to college bet- ter and fool 'round and git wise, wouldn't you? We can send you there and will, if you behave. Just sign that statement, that's all. We'll take care of you! You're a good political .general and will fare better on our sea. Them fellers you're with 're pikers. Look ahere, see that satchel. There's $5,000.00 in there. It's yours, bag an' all, just put your name on that state- ment. We'll take care o' you fer life. Our papers will immediately issue special editions with that state- ment on the front page and your picture too, three columns wide and six inches deep. Have your papers done anything like that for you? You'll be the most popular man in town. 'The Man of the Hour' will be nix on you. You'll be the 'Man of the Minute' and after I have had a good whack at Washington we'll make you Congressman. Wouldn't that be grand?\ \l daresay you can use five thousand 'bones'. It took me a long time to 'hitch it' like that. Worked mighty hard :for the gang. That's the district 'kale' and it's in twos, fives and ten dollar bills. You can put it in different banks and none's the wiser. I would just as soon hand it to you in a heap as give it

12d THE CONCORDIENSIS to the 'boys' outside, 'cause you can win for us by sign- ing that statement. It's big money, but I know you are holding out for big stakes. Three years ago I of- fered<:>your father twenty 'bucks' for his vote and he act'lly felt hurt. I guess 'twas too small, but you're gettin' it big and besides if you don't put your name to that paper, it'll sure be prison for yours.\ With this ultimatum the Boss rolled himself into his spacious desk-chai,r, puffed on his big black cigar and keenly observed tl\e face of the young man. He chuckled with glee and congratulated himself on the way he had managed the whole affair. Conrad was trapped. He leaned against the big roll top desk for support; his face flinched; his eyes becam·e expres- sionless. The mentioning of the incident about his departed father brought back to his memory the events of the past three years, the trials they had gone through, the distress they had seen, the grief they had felt and the afflictions that were visited upon them. Three years ago the humble family lived in humble bliss and in their humble way. The father was a cabinet maker, who loved his work. His chief ambi- tion, his main purpose in life was to give his sons an education. His ambition might have been gratified, his purpose fulfilled, but for uncontrollable circum- stances. The father, who was ill for many years, finally succombed a victim of the white plague. This shattered all hopes of sending Harold, the oldest son, to college. He, therefore, followed in the foot- steps of his father and plied the trade of cabinet maker. Then, it was determined that Harold help defray the college expenses of Conrad, who was accordingly sent to such an institution. But he never completed his course. Harold met a young lady one evening who made his heart beat a million times per second. He needed no Davey to aid him in his love suit, but straightway hinted \That Barkis was willin.\ So was the young lady. After his marriage, he could offer little or no aid to his brother. The family treas- ury was low and more wealthy relatives who had promised pecuniary aid now refused it. The help he received from home was a mere pittance-hardly enough to keep soul and . body together. But, he lingered and hung on. He decreased his incidentals, put off his board bill, borrowed his necessary books and clerked in a store. However, when his source of money supply was shut off he fell by the wayside. These sufferings that Conrad experienced inspired in hi~ a fiery ambition to make a name for himself and yet bring sunshine into the life of his mother. These recollections passed quickly through his mind and .gave place to thoughts and visions .of the future. Conrad was standing on the Floor in the Congress- ional Chamber delivering a speech which was received with generous hand-clapping. He saw the delighted face of hi!s mother in the visitors' balcony. W~hy was she not sitting on the Floor within the raHing, he thought? At the condusion .. of his speech, his col- leagues as well as his opponents near his desk ap- proached him and warmly shook his hand. He lived now in a beautiful home and his office ad- mitted hi,m in the best of cultured society. When he walked down the street his friends would cross over to greet him. His cup of happiness was full to the brim. Then he saw himself in a striped suit. He was sit- ting on a stone bench in a little stone room. He was in prison. He heard the footsteps of the turnkey. He heard the clanging of his keys. Soon his cell door swung open. \Mother!'' He could utter but the one word and fell upon her weeping like a child. She was dressed in black. Her face was lashed with the pangs of grief. The convict knew his mother's days were numbered. Ah, he was responsible! Now, he was before the high prison gates. The warden gave him a-matter-of-course handshake and handed him the customary five one dollar bills. Ah, but the air of freedom was beautiful to breathe again. His twenty years of imprisonment had broken his am- bition and his physical power alike. He returned to his cld haunts. He was wearing the State's dark black suit and square toed shoes, which made him a marked man wherever he went. His former friends would hurry to the opposite side when they spied him com- ing down the street. His cup of bitterness was full to overflowing. \Going to sign?\ Thi .J cart den~and coming from Belter fell upon deaf ears. Conrad did not answer, but looked with blank eyes at the sterling silver framed picture on the wall. As he looked, there floated through his mind the idea of Temptation offering him the choice of Prison or Congress, the idea of Honesty urged him to sacri- fice everything to the right. \You go in' to sign?\ Again came the demand and this ti1ne more loudly. Conrad reeled. His senses slowly came back. He was about to shout the word \No\. His eyes fell on the stenographer's desk. Sud- denly the light came into his eyes and a t}l.dll of joy passed over his countenance. He seized something from the little desk and with the exclamation \I'll be .; :

i i ) 1 r e l1 1- d ~s 'd 1- THE CONCORDIENSIS 13 back in fifteen minutes~', hastened out of the office and away from the presence of ''Bill\ Belter. And now you ask: \Did Conrad go to prison?\ No. \Was he sent to Congress?\ Yes, he is in the Upper House now. \Did he get five thousand dollars\. Yes, twice that amount. ''Was he the 'Man of the Minute' ''? Yes, he was the ''Man of the Second\. \Did he sign the statement?\ Read on. Belter was waiting in his office for Conrad's return. He looked at his watch. It was 5:55 o'clock. In five minutes the poll3 would be thrown open. True to his word, Conrad made his appearance. But with him were two men. The taUer one acted as spokesman. \We're from headquarters\ he explained drawing something from his inside coat pocket, \and this is a warrant for your arrest\ he continued, \which charges you with attempt at bribery. Our auto's outside. Bet- ter come along without any noise.\ Imagine the purple face of Belter upon hearing these words. After he recovered his breath sufficiently, he turned to Conrad with clinched fists exclaiming \I'll have you with me. You can't prove nothin' on me. Besides headquarters is our auxiliary office.\ To these words Conrad did not think it necessary to make re- ply. Belter's last remark reassured the boss. To whom then did the judges belong, he thought? These happy recollections ~made hin1 feel rather good and put him in a talkative mood. He began by talking philosophy. ''There are three great inventions,\ he said, \which are particularly handy in political play. The telephone by which we can say what we please and none's the wiser; the typewriter, by which we may make typed and unsigned notes and none's the wiser; and the camera, by which we can take a: handy picture or two and make a big fool wiser.\ Qonrad said nothing. As they neared the polls, the auto slowed down because of the crowd of voters just outside the usual limit line. They were looking up to the second story window of the house next to the line. Somebody was evidently \putting in a last word.\ Belter caught such remarks as ''five thousand dol- lars.'' \Sign that statement!\ ''We'll take care of you.\ He j.umped up in the auto. Was he ,mad? Was this his own voice coming frmn that window? He looked up. He saw and then his strength entirely failed him and he fell in a swoon. At headquarters Conrad was approached by an agent of the Civic League, who handed him a check for ten thousand dollars, the amount they had offered for the first arrest of a boss accused of corruption. When Conrad saw Belter soon after he said: You were right. There are three great inventions: the telephone which felicitates the home and facilitates business; the typewriter which aids correspond~nce; and the camera by means of which we can always have near us faces .of those distant and which can carry us around the world. Since you have named these three, I trust you will penni t me to add a fourth and that is, the phonograph and especially one of its species, the dictograph which in case of necess- ity can convict a corruptionist and save an honest man.

The bulletin . comm·ittee is to revise its list of papers to which it is sending Union news and send bulletins only to those papers which will use ,the news. The Press Club cal- endar is ready and has been on sale now for several days. It is far superior to last year's calendar and yet is selling for fifty cents instead of a doUar as :formerly. The sale has already been quite large. The ·membership committee is to revise the list of members and cut off those men who are not working for the club. The advisory committee feels that the dub has not done its best this term and is determined to start a new order of things with the new term. More assignments are to be given out and a system of credits established. • AT • • $25.00 . • • fJI We'll give you a suit to your particular measure that will add prestige to your appearance and pleasure to your college life . . • STULL BROS., 158 Jay St. JOHN B.
